8609478,5,B00EUE9V9S,"A remarkable story about Baby Peggy, an early child actress I had never heard of. Saw the film on classic movie channel and was enthralled. If you enjoy history, especially of early Hollywood, silent picture days, the Depression era and the American film viewer of that era, you cannot help but like this film.
Mind boggling to think that it was acceptable for children to be used as commodity, far moreso than they are in modern day and age, and rather amazing that Baby Peggy, now an elderly lady called Diana, came through this early lifestyle of being the sole support of her family, mostly unscathed.
It's a fascinating, true life story and the 'elephant in the room', the fact that once her career ended, it and all the negatives it incurred were never mentioned amongst family.",1445817600,3,784,4.7299270072992705

CAPTAIN JANUARY is very good, however, the shorts included are crude and not all that rewarding.  Still, I am glad to have them in my collection and would like to see more.",1405209600,4,251,4.434782608695652
8609481,5,B00EUE9V9S,"Im currently fascinated by the history of silent cinema and how Hollywood evolved through the years. When it comes to child actors, only Jackie Coogan, Shirley Temple, and members of the Gang come to mind. So it was a surprise to learn about the legacy of another popular child actor of the twenties: Baby Peggy (Peggy Lee Montgomery). Baby Peggy: The Elephant in the Room is a little gem of documentary brought to us by the hard-working folks at Milestone Film, which will truly light your day.

Directed by Vera Iwerebor, the film basically takes us from the early years of Baby Peggy, to her later years, with Peggy herself doing the narration, almost always accompanied by her young granddaughter. Even though she was born in 1918, Peggys mind was very sharp and resourceful during the making of the documentary. Her career, we are told, was very brief and it lasted from 1920 to 1924. But what a career it was! She was huge during those times, earning at one point 1.5 million a year salary. Im surprised that I did not know about her contribution to silent cinema! In her early films, she was accompanied by Brownie, the wonder dog, but she evolved into a star by herself, with great ability to imitate stars from the era, like Rudolph Valentino, Pola Negri, and others. Her father, Jack Montgomery, was a good horseman (made a living as a cowboy), but Peggy was basically the main bread provider for the family  she also lived with her mother and one older sister. Her timing was also lucky, as Carl Laemmle, the venerated boss at Universal, hired her to do movies, because Jackie Coogan (from Charlie Chaplins The Kid) was already growing up. She was also one of the first stars of which merchandise was manufactured. Sadly, Peggys father infuriated a Hollywood director, and that abruptly ended the little, talented girls career. From then on, Peggy describes the sad years that followed, with flat-broke periods, her years in vaudeville, her marriage, and more. Somewhere between all this, she changed her name to Diana Serra Carey (Serra for Junipero Serra, a missionary, very known in California, and Carey, for her late husband). Her knowledge of the silent movies era has been very helpful to historians, and she is very much in demand for revivals. Its all here for us to learn and enjoy.

Baby Peggy: The Elephant in the Room was a great joy to watch, despite the misfortunes that followed Peggy in her adult years, She was able to move along and survive to tell her stories and document them on books. Sadly, though, only 12 of the 56 shorts she filmed have been recovered, mainly in Europe. In fact, this wonderful DVD includes the feature film Captain January (1924), as well as the short films Carmen Jr. (1923), Peg O the Mounted (1924) and Such a Life (1924), plus more. What a pleasure! (USA, 2013, color & B&W, 54 min plus additional materials)

This all-region NTSC DVD was released by Milestone Films on Nov-05-2013, and it contains the 55-minute documentary from 2012 called ""Baby Peggy: The Elephant in the Room"", which recounts the life story of silent film child star Baby Peggy (later renamed to Diana Serra Cary).  The disc also includes 4 of her silent films: ""Carmen Jr."", ""Peg o' the Mounted"", ""Such is Life"", and ""Captain January"".  A photo gallery is also included.

All the content of this disc has been shown on TCM last year.  The wonderful 55-minute documentary contains rare photos and new interviews from the now 94-year-old Diana Serra Cary, who started acting at age 3 in 1921 and later earned over a million dollars a year by making short films and feature films.  We see Cary speak poignantly about her quick rise to stardom and stunning fall to hard times (due to contract disputes her father had with the studio), her vaudeville career, her unfulfilling years in sound films, and later a successful career as a writer.  The title ""The Elephant in the Room"" refers to the fact that at one time, Cary and her family avoided talking about her Baby Peggy years.  ""Baby Peggy is like the elephant in the room that no one talks about at the dinner table,"" she says.  Cary herself at one time tried to distance herself from Baby Peggy (hence the name change).  But in her later years, she embraced it again, wrote books about herself and other child actors of her generation (notably Jackie Coogan), attended film festivals of her surviving works, and helped locating her lost films.  She is the only actor from the silent era still searching for her films.  Most of her films, sadly, did not survive.  But we do see, notably, a clip from Baby Peggy's first film ""Playmates"".  Also shown is a clip of Cary's speaking role in the 1934 film ""The Return of Chandu"".  (She has a nice speaking voice.)  This documentary, directed by Vera Iwerebor, brought me a whole new admiration of Baby Peggy and her works, and hopefully a whole new generation of movie viewers will re-discover this once-forgotten movie star.

The documentary does not come with subtitles nor closed captioning.  No liner notes are included.  And the publisher has said there won't be a Blu-ray edition.

The disc also contains 4 films of Baby Peggy.  She is a bullfighter in ""Carmen Jr."" (1923, 11 min) and outwits bad guys in the woods in ""Peg o' the Mounted"" (1924, 12 min).  Both of these films came from foreign prints with non-English title cards and burned-in English subtitles.  Print conditions are not the best, understandably.  ""Such is Life"" (1924, 17 min), where Baby Peggy is a homeless girl trying to find optimism, has a nice and clean, albeit slightly soft, picture.  The 58-minute 1924 film ""Captain January"" is about the great bond between a lighthouse keeper and his little girl, and it shows Baby Peggy's acting skill at its finest.  These films should make it evident to anyone that she was a once-in-a-generation child talent.

If you want to see more of Baby Peggy's films, Grapevine Video has released DVD editions of ""The Family Secret"" (1924, 70 min) and ""April Fool"" (1926, 67 min).  ""Helen's Babies"" (1924, 90min.), co-starring Clara Bow, can be seen on Youtube.",1380672000,18,3258,4.800718132854578
