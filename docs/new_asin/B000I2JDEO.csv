2652105,2,B000I2JDEO,"THE OH IN OHIO reminds us that late night suggestive sitcoms are still around only now they are becoming full length feature films: 20 minutes worth of idea becomes stretched beyond the elastic point in this silly and oh-so-pink little bit of fluff.  First time director Billy Kent and writer Sarah Bird with assistance from Kent somehow managed to not only get producers to pay attention to their project but also attracted some good actors to try to pull it off. 'Money makes the world go around...'

The plot is minimal: Parker Posey plays successful business woman Priscilla Chase who is known for her beauty, is married to a Biology teacher Jack Chase (Paul Rudd) who is on the skids from depression over the fact that his machismo is daily challenged by the fact the Priscilla has never had an orgasm.  This fact somehow demeans Jack who has always bragged about his triumphs in bed but his career and self-esteem are in a pit due to Priscilla's sexual dysfunction. Priscilla attends a sex therapy session for women hosted by none other than Liza Minnelli where she is encouraged to get to know her vagina. At the suggestion from Priscilla's friend Sherri (Miranda Bailey) concurrently with Jack's friend Coach Popovich (Keith David) and the counsel of a therapist, Priscilla buys a vibrator and the story from then on is how Priscilla's new-found satisfaction alters her life, pushes Jack into the arms of a student (Mischa Barton), and on and on with Priscilla finding outlets for her discovery with a sex toys salesgirl, a pool guy (Danny DeVito).  Everything about Priscilla and Jack is changed and for the rest of what's left of the standup comedy routine viewers will have to decide if they care to watch the DVD.

About the only thing that pulls this together is Parker Posey, unafraid to take on a script that asks her to demean herself in the process. This is definitely one of those films to perhaps rent when the video store shelves are empty.  Grady Harp, January 07",1169856000,3,1984,4.752906976744186

2652107,4,B000I2JDEO,"I agree with the first review, this movie was hilarious.  I am a student of film and I have to say that this movie was brilliantly edited and produced.  i know it's something many people don't pay much attention to (editing, shooting, angles, lighting) but I see the magic hidden within this film.  I'm very impressed. A+++++++",1165708800,32,327,4.701754385964913

2652138,5,B000I2JDEO,"OK, not nobody really, but this one really did seem to slip through the cracks somehow and I totally stumbled upon it somehow and was like ""how the hell have I not heard of this?!""
I really enjoy this movie, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to many people who have also never heard of it. I realize it might not be for a lot of people who are either too mainstream or maybe real film buffs, but I've watched it a number of times and always get a kick out of the characters. Also love some of the shots of the Frank Gehry building.",1308700800,,531,4.115384615384615
2652139,5,B000I2JDEO,don't forget we also have the great Parker Posey who always has great comedic delivery. This movie deals with sex and has a young Mischa Barton in it as well. Funny and very real in the sense it poses some situations that most movies do not touch. Definitely more for an older audience to get everything that is brought up in the movie. Watch. Enjoy.

2652141,5,B000I2JDEO,"I totally loved this movie. Paul Rudd is fantastic in it. At first I was hesitant because Misha Barton was in it.. who? Yeah, her. But she is actually pretty good. I also find Parker Posey super sexy and this movie she is really cute. She has a sex scene with Heather Graham (spoiler) which was great. Highly recommend.",1211932800,,319,4.423728813559322
2652142,3,B000I2JDEO,"The Oh in Ohio is the kind of movie you see for the stars as it was indeed saved by the cast. Paul Rudd is his down-to-earth-seeming self. Parker Posey is adorable. Within moments you too will believe her innocence in realizing her own sexual dysfunction. And DeVito is just a fantastic actor. Like Bill Murray, (and I don't mean to sound weird about this, but perhaps someone out there will get my meaning)I wish he were my father...sorry dad. To put it less creepily, I just wish he could be my friend.

For what appears to be director Billy Kent's first movie, this flick is not bad. However, it just doesn't feel whole. Keith David, for instance plays Paul Rudd's friend/coworker at school. I felt his character just didn't have the impact the filmmaker was going for. To put it simply, his character just seemed underdeveloped.  In fact that's a good way to describe the feel of the whole movie: underdeveloped or premature. Economically speaking, the movie is not worth the $19.99.  I picked it up for 5 bucks as a pre-viewed Blockbuster movie. I am not unhappy with that choice, perhaps a used purchase may be the better choice for anyone interested.

Aside from this, the movie does have some nice insightful discussions on the nature of a sexual relations (particularly when Rudd and Posey are at the Psychaiatrist/Relationship Helper Man). There is a genuinely airy feel to the movie which is good to know for people who need a pick-me-up from a gloomy week. For geography lover's, it was also nice to see a different city in the background. Lastly DeVito's ""Ok"" at the end of the movie is priceless.",1205625600,2,1610,4.678445229681979
2652143,3,B000I2JDEO,"This goofy little comedy with wonderful, talented cast is set in Cleveland, Ohio.  We learn of young married professional couple in their mid-thirties who are slowly but surely getting alienated.  While husband is gloomy about his career as a biology teacher in the local public high school, his goofball wife with cute smile and pretty face is earning her way to becoming a marketing vice president in her company.  Their life seems to be a comfortable except for the fact that their marriage is (ahem!) slightly disfunctional.  For a moment there I could understand husband's escapade in having relationship with his high school student in attempt to assert himself.  But I could not buy into a relationship between the wife (Parker Posey) and pool installer man played by Denny DeVito.  Before long I started to ask myself what is this movie really about?  Love story about the (modern) beauty and the beast?  Or did I miss something here?  As wife and husband realize that there is no reconciliation putting them togehter no matter how handsome they look together, we see a new liberated modern woman simply enjoying her life in her goofy, superficial kind of way.  But we are OK with it - because after all - this is a comedy, folks.",1201564800,,1238,4.797169811320755

2652145,1,B000I2JDEO,"This is a review of the OH IN OHIO DVD, rather than the film itself.  It's also a warning.

I first rented OH IN OHIO from Netflix.  The DVD kept skipping and stalling.  I couldn't watch it all.  I figured it was badly scratched.  So I bought a new DVD from Amazon.  It arrived looking pristine, still wrapped in celephone.  I even played it on a different DVD player.  Yet this DVD also SKIPPED AND STALLED!

My DVD player was even RUMBLING and GROANING when it tried to play this new DVD.  And it's not the DVD player, because when I put in another DVD, it had no trouble.

Seems OH IN OHIO went through some pretty shoddy DVD manufacturing ""quality control.""

Why do SO MANY DVDs skip and stall?  And if DVDs are so fragile, why don't CDs and CD-ROMs have this problem?

In the 1980s, VIDEO magazine published a theory that the studios were releasing poor quality VHS tapes because they didn't want consumers to build longterm libraries.  That makes sense.

Remember, the studios never wanted to sell their movies, they only wanted to rent tapes to video stores.  It was a series of court cases in the 1970s/80s concerning antitrust, restraint of trade, and fair use in copyright (such as the Sony Betamax case) that barred the studios from restricting the trade of independent video stores.

Yet the studios made a bundle when people built tape libraries. Another bundle now that people are replacing their fragile tapes with fragile DVDs.

I can see why the studios don't want to manufacture decent quality DVDs, lest consumers have permanent movies floating around for decades. Studios earn nothing on the sale of used DVDs. Better for them to manufacture fragile DVDs that won't last, so consumers will more easily replace their scratchy DVDs when the next format comes along.

I'm really tired of SO MANY DVDs skipping and stalling.  I wish there was more consumer outrage against these crappy studio practices.

Based on what I could see of OH IN OHIO, Parkey Posey is pretty and delightful, although the film is fluffy and lightweight, unlike her darker 1990s comedies (i.e., HOUSE OF YES, CLOCKWATCHERS).

My one star is no slam on Posey, nor even on the film.  It refers to the crappy DVD.

IMPORTANT: Google ""DVD rot"".  You'll be surprised and disheartened by what you'll find.",1174521600,5,2290,4.717171717171717
2652146,4,B000I2JDEO,"""The Oh in Ohio"" is a self-assured slice of life that can touch viewers while disconcerting them all the while. Its comedic aspirations don't come to full fruition and its screenplay is a tad undercooked, but the actors overcome this with suave, easy charm.

Poking sly, understated fun at the overemphasis of sex in society, it is neither for the prudish nor for those who need slapstick to find humor. Sex may be the centrifugal force of the film, but this is no ""40-Year Old Virgin,"" even though Paul Rudd plays similarly sympathetic characters in each.

Priscilla Chase, played by Parker Posey, is an ambitious, ditzy woman on the fast track to large-scale corporate success. However, to the dismay of her schoolteacher husband Jack, played by Rudd, she is the consummate cold fish. She may know the exact number of times they've had sex, but she has never had a single orgasm - ever - due to a ""sexual dysfunction."" Nor does she seem interested in doing so soon.

Things go up in smoke. She may have caused the problem, but Jack cannot get past the fact that the one woman he has not satisfied in bed is his wife of ten years. After moving to the garage and confiding in his friend and colleague Popovitch, played with cheeky delight by Keith David, he finally begins a full-fledged separation from Priscilla when she becomes overly addicted to a vaginal vibrator. He moves to the Manly Arms apartment complex - ""Why settle for the mundane when you can be the king of your domain?"" - and gives in to the advances of sophisticated 18-year old student Kristen, played perfectly by Mischa Barton, who lost her innocence long before he came along.

Priscilla is thus left to find her sexual identity. She pursues sex with random men, but she finds it unsatisfying. Sex with sex shop clerk Justine, played by Heather Graham, doesn't do the trick either. Wayne the Pool Guy, played with zest and warmth by Danny DeVito, however, puts an entirely new spin on things, awakening ""parts of Cleveland"" she never knew existed. In Wayne she finds

Liza Minelli is a hoot in her scene as an overzealous sex therapist, and Posey really brings it home when Jack finally gives Priscilla the satisfaction that was missing from their bedroom by merely calling her  cell phone during, of all moments, an important board meeting. It's where the phone specifically is, of course, that matters.

""The Oh In Ohio"" is equal parts raunchy and touching as it cloaks its characters in genuine humanity. Sex may come between them, but it's who they are, not what they are, that matters in the end.",1172102400,8,2573,4.704444444444444
2652147,4,B000I2JDEO,"You have to take this with a grain of salt. Full disclosure, I'm from Cleveland originally so I had a ball watching this satire. That's what it is -- don't take it for a comedy or a drama...it's a satire and a bit of a black comedy. Subtitled one woman's story is about to climax. About Parker Posey's sexual dysfunction, it's both naughty and nice. Danny DeVito is hilarious....the section of the movie where there's a slide into the pool is a good analogy for the theme which is about the quest for not only the big O but also personal fulfillment. Paul Rudd lets Parker take the lead, Mischa Barton is sweet and savvy and very sexy. And it proves that all is not perfect with the prettiest girl in Cleveland even when you marry her. Don't miss the hilarious and deleted scenes....completely mindless popcorn movie...for late night viewing instead of HSN....",1171152000,5,860,4.627450980392157

8143449,5,B000I2JDEO,"The Oh in Ohio is hilarious and heartfelt. Parker Posey nails it as Pricilla Chase, the ""frigid"" housewife who is sexually awakened by her revelation that she has a sexual dysfunction disorder. Her valiant attempt to break her disorder is not only terribly funny but one feels for her. As viewers we triumph with her when she finally breaks the cycle of her repetitive life and finds love. It is racy but not in a gross out humor way. We get to know Pricilla through her journey and find that letting go can be more help than harm.

Paul Rudd is charming and vulnerable as Pricilla's husband who cannot seem to give her the big O. He too goes through a metamorphosis and finding his true self. Although he falls in love with one of his students played by Mischa Barton, he comes out of the film a more fulfilled man.

The Oh in Ohio is raw, real, and a feel good film. After viewing this film one is left with a glow and a smile on their face.",1360540800,,943,4.262569832402234

8143451,3,B000I2JDEO,"""The Oh in Ohio"" had a lot of the ingredients to make it a successful film but it didn't quite do it for me. I enjoy the premise of the film as it centers on the Priscilla's sexual awakening. I enjoy Paul Rudd's performance. He is always likable. I commend the film for pairing an unlikely couple together, even though it is not within the norms of Hollywood. However, I found the film to be oddly hollow. While I appreciated the trajectory and character arc of Priscilla and Jack, I also found it difficult to pinpoint the point of the story. Priscilla's narrative felt confident. It knew where it wanted to go. However, Paul Rudd's storyline seems muddied. I wasn't sure how his narrative fit into the grand scheme of the movie. The ending seemed abrupt and unconvincing. It left us a void that the movie should have filled. That said, it is still an enjoyable film. Paul Rudd and Parker Posey are great enough actors to keep us captivated, even if the story doesn't do them justice.",1355184000,,985,4.53932584269663
8143452,4,B000I2JDEO,"The Oh in Ohio is a witty comedy about the complexities of an orgasm.
Paul Rudd plays the quick wit slacker character that we've grown
accustomed to seeing and Parker is the adorable know it all that we all
love. The film is surprisingly funny and heart warming. Danny Devito
plays an endearing lovable salesman. This film manages to take the
romantic comedy genre viewer into different, unexpected directions. I'm
a big fan of filmmakers that can take a date or couples film genre,
like a romantic comedy, and turn the genre into a film for all to enjoy. If
you're a Paul Rudd fan than this is surely a role of his that you don't
want to miss. This film is worth a watch if you like to laugh you wont

8143453,1,B000I2JDEO,"This movie gives us the profound absurdity of knockout Parker Posey falling for short, round and old Danny Devito. The camera accidentally catches Devito shirtless for one horrifying second late in the film. Don't say I didn't warn you.",1335139200,,236,5.076923076923077
8143454,2,B000I2JDEO,"There are few redeeming aspects in this showcase of irresponsible, unmotivated filmmaking.  The characters, dialogue, and situations were nearly as uncomfortable and awkward as the premise of a woman trying to have an orgasm.  I don't understand how a film mainly about sex can be so boring, slow, uninteresting and UN-sexy.  The pacing is far too slow for what is supposed to be a fun, quirky film, and the editing is loose with some confusing cuts.  The entire film felt unnatural, uncomfortable, and bored.  A few plot points and lines of dialogue were entirely confusing and unclear, and by the end of the film I felt lost.  The student and Sherri characters were poorly written and poorly executed - they felt like characters in a book I was reading.  They weren't dynamic and didn't feel truly alive and present.  Their comments were unnatural and strange, and didn't fit in with the rest of the film.  Also, a very confusing aspect of the film was the relationship between Priscilla and Wayne - I won't give everything away, but throughout the whole film I was confused about their past, present, and until the end, future.

So now you might be wondering about those redeeming qualities I mentioned earlier.  Paul Rudd is an excellent actor, which somehow manages to show through in this film.  However, his skill is weighed down, limited, and ultimately trapped and killed by the poor writing, directing, and overall execution of this story.  Danny DeVito is the only thing that manages to rise above this snooze-fest to make it somewhat enjoyable.  His character is developed, complex, motivated and real in a world of fake, tired, hollow shells of people.  Overall though, this film is slow, barely able to capture and hold attention, and left no impact on my view of the world.  I believe that each film is worth watching once - to watch this film again would be a waste of time.",1334880000,,1890,4.787037037037037
8143455,4,B000I2JDEO,"The problem with the ""Oh in Ohio"" is that it was `produced' and `marketed' as a comedy. At its core, it is not. It would be a much better film, and actually much funnier, if it were re-edited as a dramedy.

Many of it's comic moments work, and could be far more effective if the film was about 45 degrees more serious. But too often the comedy is either underdeveloped or overwrought. The film, as presented, tries too hard to be funny, especially with a cast so gifted at understatement.

Oh's cast, the skill of the director, et al, to capture their obvious magic and the film's story concepts make it, in many ways, a rewarding film. If you can forgive some of it's minor excesses, you will begin to feel what it's like to be kissed by Posey, Rudd, Barton, David, Bailey, Graham & DeVito. But it could have been so much richer: you could have begun to feel what it's like to be loved by them.",1330387200,,895,4.321428571428571
