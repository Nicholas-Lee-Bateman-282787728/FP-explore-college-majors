4891814,2,B005TMXY48,"The Thousand Plane Raid is a very poor film that looks like it was a made for TV effort, about the US Army Air Corps attempt to wipe out a target in Germany thru precision daylight bombing. The film is identical in theme to the movie and TV show ""12 O'Clock High"" and both of those productions are very well done. But this films action scenes are so poorly done, and the star Christopher George so awful it was hard to sit thru this film. As a fan of WWII films and TV shows (The Rat Patrol with the same Chis George was actually pretty good), I wanted to like this film but it really isn't worth anyone's time nor the $20 you'll fork over for the DVD-R copy. Christopher George is surrounded by a lot of 60's TV stock actors here like J.D. Cannon and Ben Murphy and they are no better than he is in it. The battle scenes and all those of the bombers flying are all poorly pieced together clips from other films or very badly done studio models and sets. This film adds nothing to your collection of WWII movies if you have one like I do. I purchased this film and sat thru it and can easily recommend you don't waste your time or money on it like I did--your not missing anything!",1330300800,4,1181,4.1615720524017465

4891817,5,B005TMXY48,"Great movie. But I am a bit biased as I have been a Christopher George fan since his days in ""The Rat Patrol"" and his other short lived series ""The Immortal"". Features a good supporting cast of familiar character actors from the 60's as well.",1417219200,,242,4.4
4891818,1,B005TMXY48,"I have no idea how good or bad this movie is - I purchased three (3) copies over time as prizes for an event I run, and all three did not play correctly (I didn't think to review them in advance for quality :-(  ). It took five (5) minutes  for any video to start (no menu), then the scenes would start in the middle of tracks. It took 30 minutes to play all the allowable video, THEN gave me a menu.

IF I could get a working copy, I'm sure I could give it at least three (3) stars; I mean, it has B-17s in it.  :-)

To Amazon's credit, they did refund my monies.",1414281600,,564,3.8275862068965516

We tried to play it on our Blue-ray player and it does not work on it (causing us to return the first one we received). When we received the second copy and the same problem was there, I tried it in the regular VCR and it worked.

4891822,4,B005TMXY48,"In this film Col. Brandon, the commander of a Heavy Bomber Group in England, is given the opportunity to carry out a plan he has devised which will result in a 1,000 American bombers hitting a single target in Germany. This target has a fighter factory which is about to be relocated and if it can be destroyed before then it may shorten the war. The plan involves three waves of bombers coordinated in secret and dropping the bombs with a minimum of in-air collisions. Because the bombers will operate beyond fighter range some of the bombers will leave their bombs behind and carry extra guns, serving as a gunship or destroyer escort. The film makes an excellent tribute to the American airmen who really flew those missions over Nazi Germany.

A good story but the ACTUAL 1,000 plane raid was Operation Millennium, an RAF show directed at Cologne. The movie shows all B-17s and NO B-24s... which would have been impossible as the B-24s made up a significant percentage of the 8th Air Force's bomber strength. Towards the end of the film the Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) is complete before Col. Brandon returns, which is impossible as BDA is a science and at the time would have been done via photos from a high-altitude recon aircraft hours or days later. Much of the footage is from WWII or from other WWII films but at least some of it is Vietnam footage, which was readily available at the time.",1403136000,2,1404,4.63855421686747
4891823,4,B005TMXY48,"An air attack of a thousand B-17 bomber planes over a target in Germany during World War ll, is the plan.  The Mirisch film stars Christopher George as Colonel Brandon, Laraine Stephens, J.D. Cannon, and Gary Marshall. The cast also includes stars Gavin McLeod, and Ben Murphy. This is a good movie, but since this was recorded for on demand in DVD-R, the picture and sound quality is not the best. This is because it did not use the DVD system which uses a variable transfer (bit)rate for its MPEG-2 data compression(encoding). The bit rate is the data transfer speed and refer to the amount of information that can be handled by the system in one second. The higher the bit rate, the larger the volume of information that can be tranfered or stored, and the higher quality of video image, as well as, sound can be handled. You can see digital artifacts in parts of movie, but otherwise a movie to watch.",1402876800,,905,4.552147239263804
4891824,5,B005TMXY48,"There have been a lot of movies made about the horrific air war over Europe during World War 2 focusing on the United States Army Air Corps 8th Air Force Boeing B-17 Bomber Wings, Groups and Squadrons. The names of the installations always seem ficticious as usually the destinations to bomb. You know them----12 O'Clock High, Command Decision, The War Lover, Memphis Belle and The Thousand Plane Raid.

Most of these movies seem to time period focus during the late summer period in 1943 when and an all out attempt to shut down the German aircraft and armament industries took place. The validity and acceptance of precision daylight strategic bombing was in doubt and the losses and morale of the 8th Air Force were mounting to unsustainable levels.  More men died in the skies of Europe then did on the islands and beaches of the Pacific during World War 2. Life expectancy for a crewman trying to complete 25 missions for his rotation back stateside was slim.

I like the 1000 plane raid because it does show how desperate the air war was and how leaders arose to overcome the Luftwaffe and destroy Germany's industrial capacity to wage war.

The movie features a bunch of surplus B17's being operated out of California's Central Valley. You can tell that the ground scenery in the movie is not East Anglia in England. There are some good flying sequences when an RAF liaison Wing Commander makes an unauthorized flight and hot dogs, stunts and stresses Col. Gordon's assigned / dedicated aircraft. The aircraft subsequently crashes with Gordon on it who survives intact but rips the RAF officer a new one.

Col. Gordon is the stereortypical iron tailed group commander who goes around imposing discipline over his mostly frightened incompetent charges. The only thing that tempers his iron will is a pretty Lieutenant who he's sleeping with.

The movie climaxes with the 1000 plane raid. The night before the mission, the 8th Air Force members listen to a Lord Haw Haw Radio Berlin broadcast where the propagandist tells them the operation security of their massive operation had been revealed and breached.

I liked this movie the best of this type story / genre.",1388793600,3,2170,4.86449864498645

8486394,5,B005TMXY48,"The basic theme of this movie, The 1000 Plane Raid, was a U.S. Army Air Force colonel convinced the Allies during World War II, that a daylight bombing raid of Germany will bring a quick end to the war.  Christopher George, Laraine Stephens, J.D. Cannon and Gary Marshall - plus a host of other well-known actors were superb in their performance.  I have read other reviews about the lack of detail due to a ""Hollywood"" presentation for the beginning of massive daylight bombing.  That is so noted.  However with the use of actual World War II movies in color - as well as the rest of the film - for the inexperienced viewer, this movie was an excellent introduction to basic information why such a military strategy became necessary.
Hitler refused to sue for peace - he was a maniac who destroyed his own nation.  This was one of many strategies used by the Allies of WW II, to shorten the war in Europe.  I am pleased to have this vintage movie in my collection and give it 5 gold stars!  The audio is good and the quality of the movie itself due to its age.  I have seen several DVD movies and documentaries on such plane raids; but this movie gave me a basic introduction about the strategy.  I was a field grade officer in the USAF and found it very instructive; that includes some of my military Veteran friends who watched it on my TV and arrived at the same conclusion.",1473206400,3,1378,4.41501976284585

8486397,4,B005TMXY48,"The Thousand Plane Raid, 1969 film

This story is about the Army Air Corps bombing campaign over Germany in 1943. It appears to use film stock from that era with new scenes for this movie. We see seventeen B-17 bombers return from a mission, there are casualties. An RAF fighter pilot will be assigned to a US bomber group for his expertise on enemy fighters. The enemy fighters are getting better, so too their anti-aircraft fire. The Air Corps wants a daylight bombing effort that will use 1,000 bombers for the same mission. Night bombing cant be that accurate. Precision daylight bombing that can knock out critical industry is the key to winning the war. They need 30 airports for bombers and another 30 airports for fighter escorts. It is an exercise in management coordination. The logistics are mentioned, so too the targets. Scheduling is a problem to prevent collisions or unwanted problems.

Is there a flaw in this plan? They must destroy the enemy fighter plants as the highest priority (strategic bombing). But this target is near the farthest limit for fighters and bombers. The Colonel will retrain his men to improve their efficiency and reduce the casualties. Their results are noted, so too their faults. The plan is approved by the High Command. They will attack in less than three weeks (by taking a short cut in the time-table). A head-on attack by fighters works against the B-17's weakest spot. Lt. Archer shows his flying skills on a borrowed B-17. Was he insubordinate? There is a shortage of parts. It is solved by recycling. What about increased losses? Two extra machine guns in the nose of the B-17 will defend against a frontal attack. A news broadcast from Berlin talks about a big raid. Is this another bluff? The crews are ordered to get rested. They are told about their important target just before the flight. The B-17s take off. One bomber has a problem and crash lands. Is there a replacement?

Colonel Gordon takes the B-17 that is not fully operational so he can direct operations over the target. The bombers were sent up in groups that would rendezvous over the target (would this confuse the enemy?). Anti-aircraft cannons are used against them, their shells bursting in black smoke. The first wave drops its bombs on the target. The second wave is late; the third wave is early. This must be corrected to avoid a harmful interaction, such as dropping bombs on lower level bombers. The Colonels bomber is hit, it falls out of formation. The target is totally destroyed. The Colonels B-17 reaches the Channel but is nearly out of fuel. It makes a belly landing, the crew survives. This operation was a success! Casualties were less than expected.

This is more of an intellectual story than an action movie. A better script and budget (and CGI) would have made it better. Was it meant to exploit the much better movie The Battle of Britain from that same year? Note how it uses WW II movies of B-17s as part of this story. You can compare this to Twelve OClock High as stories about strategic bombing, using military force for its greatest advantage.",1428969600,,3093,4.754189944134078
