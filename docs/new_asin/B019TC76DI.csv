8746012,3,B019TC76DI,My rating is not on the series. Buyer beware on UK versions because the quality went from HD to below SD. I believe there were manufacturing issues. I really love the series and wanted these to be great but the quality was so bad it had to be returned.,1461801600,,252,4.163265306122449
