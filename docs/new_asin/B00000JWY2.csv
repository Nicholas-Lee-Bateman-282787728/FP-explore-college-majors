Okay. To me, part four and five were both running a bit low on gas, but they are still a given buy if you liked the other movies. And I also strongly recommend watching it, only to understand part six better (whenever it comes out in West), which is in my eyes a much better movie than it's predecessors, both when it comes to plot, directing and cameography.
But you probably already know this, if you've seen one of the movies, and enjoyed it and found the characters likable and interesting, you'll watch this movie anyway.",982108800,,800,4.762589928057554
