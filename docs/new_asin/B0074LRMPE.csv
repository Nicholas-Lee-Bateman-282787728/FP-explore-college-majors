One of the main characters has trouble saying anything nice at all. The two main female characters are given clothing and body movements (despite being animated) that are clearly intended to be provocative. Another main character has a ""time travel"" machine labeled ""Little Wizard"" that is ""in your face"" for extended periods throughout each movie in this series. Please see the video review for specifics. None of this is necessary in order to Learn Our History. Shame on the producer.",1517702400,,986,7.891891891891892
