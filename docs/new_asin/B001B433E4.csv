Her teaching style is so accessible to someone like myself (I don't love the hippie spiritual aspect of yoga), she is down to earth and explains what poses work what muscles. Frankly, looking at the 50 year old's body is inspiring enough to get through class! I wanted to know more about what made her take her approach to yoga so I watched this DVD....inspiring even isn't enough of a word to describe what she went through to start her studio. I really admire people who share their stories with others.",1283126400,2,565,4.603960396039604

8281856,5,B001B433E4,I have to say that Kimberly Fowler has an amazing story.  Her message that you must believe in yourself and anything is possible really hit me deeply.  She overcame so many serious obstacles that it makes the things that I'm going through seem less of a hurdle for me.  Thank you for sharing your story!!,1214092800,2,304,4.490909090909091
