7062539,5,B00UNEJ7TS,Love this series! Wish you had the Complete Third season!,1442880000,,57,4.8
7062540,5,B00UNEJ7TS,"And here finally is season 2! I loved this show back in the nineties. Yes, it's often ridiculous, silly, and just plain over the top cheesey (that's the word everyone seems to use to describe season 1 and it gets even more so in season 2.) But what saves the show, and ultimately makes it, is the rapport and chemistry between the two main characters, Caine and Peter, father and son, played by David Carradine and Chris Potter. They are perfect whenever they are on screen together. I loved watching the evolution of their relationship after they reunited in season 1. Caine seems to figure out what Peter needs, and Peter lets go of some of the anger, and begins to train again with his father and remember his boyhood teachings. This show also had wonderful supporting characters too, like Kermit, Blaisdell, Mary Margaret, Jody, Blake, and of course Lo Si. (The Ancient). While the kung fu was often ham fisted (and very obviously stunt doubled), and the stories over the top, watching the Caines learn to become a family again was compelling and emotional and there was a wide variety, from mystical and fantasy to humor to straight up cop drama and lost in the woods stories. Love it. And I so hope they'll release the rest of the series. After this season, Peter is no longer defiantly declaring ""I'm not my father, I don't do kung fu, I'm a cop, that's who I am, that's what I do!""  Instead, in the credits they show father and son in tuxedos and Peter sheepishly saying ""We're a team"".  And Peter eventually becomes a Shaolin priest himself!

Please, whomever is responsible, please release the next two seasons on dvd soon. The warm nostalgia I have watching this show again is well worth every penny to me. Carradine and Potter made a great team!",1442620800,28,1757,4.625

It's been a while (3 years) since these releases, when are season 3 & 4 going to be released though.
Being from the U.K. these shows are rarer than hens teeth, so to make an old man happy (who has watched this show & the original 70's show from the pilot movie onwards) please release the final 2 seasons before I die!",1484611200,,385,3.948717948717949

7062569,5,B00UNEJ7TS,This series is great! I'm just wondering what has happened to season 3?! I thought that it was due out by now. It is not fair that they taunt us like this by keeping us waiting!,1480550400,2,177,3.9444444444444446
7062570,1,B00UNEJ7TS,I waited so long for this dvd to come up for sale.  and non of the disc will play in my dvd player.  so unhappy :(,1474070400,,114,3.3461538461538463
7062585,4,B00UNEJ7TS,"This show brings back memories of a time when AOL ruled the internet (and slowly pushed past BBCs and IRC channels), car phones and pagers were the ""in"" thing, and a cell phone was a thing of the distant future.  As corny as some of the dialogue and scenes are, the moral(s) and wisdom still hold true today - mayhap even more so as the world seems to decay into madness.

Not a lot of Kung Fu as today's generation may think of it but more of styled Tai Chi.  Still, for those that grew up with this show or those who don't mind a show the whole family can enjoy (cell phone free even, ahha!), it still brings a smile to my face.

One thing to note: the pilot does have female chest nudity (something I didn't know until watching the DVD as this aired on what was basically the equivalent of the WB of my home town.  Still a good series.",1472342400,2,838,4.116564417177914

7062588,5,B00UNEJ7TS,buying this from Amazon is a long time dream for me.  I grew up watching this show & was so excited to find the first two seasons on DVD.  I echo some of the other reviews in saying thank you to whoever is responsible for their release; and add my sincere hope & wish for the last two seasons to be released so I can relive the rest of this childhood favorite :).,1468022400,3,363,3.958904109589041
7062589,1,B00UNEJ7TS,"The second season of Kung Fu the Legend Continues is still terrible!  David Carradine is Not Chinese!  This show is about a half White/Half Chinese Kwai Chang Caine (David Carradine) , who is apothecary in the old west. His son, Peter Caine (Chris Potter), was a cop and suppose to be a quarter Chinese. None of these actors had any Chinese blood.  This show is in the 1990s is racist. It is not a true Asian-American TV series!  It never has been a true Asian American TV show.",1467244800,,478,4.3977272727272725

7062609,3,B00UNEJ7TS,I waited a long time to get the series. I'm glad I waited to get it at a cheaper price; I was disappointed in the story lines.
