In this case, the apple fell far from the tree, rolled down a long hill and into the sewer.  There are so many other quality fishing shows out there.  Don't waste your money on this one.",1317168000,,354,4.208955223880597
8535337,5,B002UNMWOC,"I ordered Trev Gowdy's Monster Fish Season 1;  I received my video within one week.  I have developed an interest in catching my own monster fish, this video has turned my passion into an addiction.  I have since booked two fishing trips with to of the outfitters used on the video.
I recommend this video for anyone that likes to catch big fish.  This video is a complete collection of Trev Gowdy's Monster Fish Season 1 T.V. show.  I enjoy watching Trev Gowdy and Dennis Braid from time to time. This video makes watching there show without interuption easy.",1280275200,,560,4.616161616161616
