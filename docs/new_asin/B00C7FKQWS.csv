5695982,5,B00C7FKQWS,"This story is based on one of the more recent volumes of Black Panther from Marvel comics written by prolific Hollywood director/producer and erstwhile BET president, Reginald Hudlin. It is based on the first six issues of his run as writer of the Black Panther and is almost a faithful adaptation.
The feature tries to introduce the viewer to Wakanda, the fictional African nation from which the Black Panther hails, its tradition, customs and place on the global scene in respect to more familiar sovereign powers like the United States.
The Black Panther is Wakanda's king and we see a young prince T'Challa (the Black Panther) assume the burden of leadership.
The movie opens with a rite of ascension to the throne and ends with the king's response to invasion and attempted regicide.
The story is well told and although it is more than an hour long, it leaves you wanting more. The ending feels a little rushed and I would have appreciated seeing a little more time devoted to the invasion and its repercussions but what is presented is adequate.
As this is an introduction, not much of young T'Challa's extraordinary abilities are dealt with but his character and resourcefulness are displayed.
Despite the the animation  not being traditional it more than suffices in telling the story and in no way detracts from your enjoyment of this decidedly non-conventional fare.
The range of human vice and virtue is on display and there is a small amount of the African -European relationship interwoven in the tale.
Like the best Black Panther comics, there is political intrigue, drama, gravitas, suspense, good dialogue and for this work, a dash of romance.
The production is sterling and the creators spared no expense in securing talented Hollywood veterans for voices. The score is brilliant and will reverberate within your temporal lobe for days.
Buy it or not, it is definitely worth watching and when the final credits roll, you'll be searching the internet for more Black Panther.
For Marvel Comics enthusiasts, imagine if Christopher Priest's first story arc was adapted in a similar manner.
Enjoy!",1295481600,6,2109,5.0085470085470085
5695983,5,B00C7FKQWS,"The Black Panther animated series has quite the difficult run behind it. It was broadcast in Australia and was available for a very short time on iTunes. Finally, it is coming to DVD.

At first glance, the animation takes some getting used to but once you're immersed in the storyline the animation, art, voice acting, and plot of the story are all perfect to complement the story of T'Challa, Marvel's Black Panther. Even though I've seen the series, I'm picking it up on DVD as well because the show needs to be supported. It was high quality, original, and powerful.

If you're in the least bit interested to learn more about the Black Panther, pick up this DVD. It's got a great story spread throughout 6 episodes. It features cameos of a number of other Marvel superheroes and teases a possible sequel at the end that unfortunately doesn't seem likely to be happening any time soon.",1294876800,46,887,4.67948717948718

5696018,5,B00C7FKQWS,"Marvel Knights: Black Panther is not really a movie, but an eight part episodic adventure of the titular character.  The animation is closer to a motion comic than a fully animated feature, but that is the only shortcoming of this otherwise brilliant masterpiece.

Of all the Marvel motion comic animated features, this is by far my favorite.  Not only does it put the spotlight on one of Marvel's most under served characters, but everything about this film--the music, the writing, the voice acting--is all perfect!  This is not a typical superhero story although there is plenty of action and adventure.  True to the nature of the first ever Black comic book hero, the Black Panther's story makes some bold political statements that abound with real world topics, especially the perception and treatment of Africa by the Western world.  This is not just a great superhero story.  It's a great story in general and will resonate with the viewer on an emotional and philosophical level.  Yes, it's deep.

But this show, to be fair, isn't trying to play some kind of race card or come off as an obvious lecture.  It's a grand adventure with memorable dialogue, impressive music, and overwhelming charm (think Zootopia, but for mature audiences).  I've shown this DVD to tons of friends, both comic fans and non-comic fans alike, and it is always met with praise.

Do yourself a favor and join the panther cult!",1463529600,4,1410,4.878151260504202

5696028,4,B00C7FKQWS,"This was a very pleasant surprise. I read up on the 'Marvel Knights' animation style, and was expecting something very limited. Having watched it, I almost prefer this to typical animation. Technically speaking this style has fewer frames and less-fluid movement, but the quality of the images is superior because this is taking frames from very good comic book artwork as the source. Great textures, tight stylization, very cool.

As someone looking to learn a bit more about this character ahead of the upcoming film, I found the story interesting and dramatic. It it s bit jumpy, due to being a series of short-burst episodes instead of a seamless longer film. That being said, this is quite high-quality for an animated adaption, and the African setting and style (to the music, among other things) which sets it apart from the typical Marvel stuff. Well worth the price.",1452556800,7,875,4.9523809523809526

5696038,5,B00C7FKQWS,"Wow! Just wow! I can almost guarantee that the U.S. would think this to be ""anti-American"" and ""anti-Capitalism""! This short series (which could have been a movie in itself) is littered with so much hidden truth about the nature of the world. There's a lot of ambiguity throughout to leave the mind to wonder about the messages; some well placed comedic relief; and lot of knowledge of the Wakanda tribe (especially hints of spiritual superiority). There's not a excessive focus on T'Challa, and it attempts to capture more of the larger picture - which emotes balance.

I kind of wished it was longer. Sighs. The voice actor selection was precise. The storyline was spectacular. Very sensible and fitting. This is a decent introduction to the Black Panther if anyone is not familiar with it. And since Marvel is releasing a movie for this in a few years, this would be a great premise/foundation for any new BP fans.

BP faced off against Captain America on here....although Cap lost, it was kind of a weak fight scene.

I like how the characters are constantly reintroduced in each episode; it helps prime the memory for those who are new to this series. My son and his cousins love this and have watched it 3 times already, and they still wanna see it again. It would be nice if BET could air this during Black History month again in conjunction with an actually brief historic capture of the BPP since there are some loose connections.

Aside from it being short and concise, I have no complaints. High recommend",1438992000,13,1516,4.709433962264151

I've never been big on motion comics so I actually came into this with pretty low expectations. Having said that, this was probably the best one I've ever seen. It really surprised me.

There are also popular celebrities doing the voices such as Djimon Hounsou (Blood Diamonds) as the Black Panther, along with Alfre Woodard, Jill Scott, Stan Lee himself and others.

5696080,5,B00C7FKQWS,"Marvel Knights is known for doing motion comics but this is an actual animated series.  While it is limited new artwork was clearly created for this project and there was a team of animators.  It's a bit closer to The Maxx or even the X-men cartoon from the 90s.  It's styled like John Romita Jr's Black Panther comic and I have to say it animates quite well.  This is what I wish the other Marvel Knights offerings looked like but I'm sure it was expensive.  Plus it had the backing of BET which none of the other releases did.

The story is written by Reginald Hudlin.  He has done a few Black Panther stories so it made sense that this pairing would happen.  The show has lots of racism.  Not even veiled.  Lots of white people putting their foots in their mouths.  Stan Lee even plays one of them.  It plays a lot like a 70's blacksploitation film.  The overall story is fun and has lots of Marvel Universe cameos for the fans.  Also has some well animated action scenes.

I like the voice acting.  It isn't the best MK has done but it's good. Overall this is a great addition to your collection and a nice bit of more adult animation.  It's not DC league in terms of animation but the sleek from the page look and raw delivery of the story is refreshing.  I hope MK picks up in sales so we can see more comics adapted to screen as well as this.",1404864000,,1349,4.223529411764706

5696095,5,B00C7FKQWS,"""Blood Diamonds"" actor Djimon Hounsou is the voice of Black Panter in Marvel Knight's motion comic based on the hit comic ""Black Panther Volume 1: Who Is the Black Panther"" written by scribe Reginald Hudlin and drawn by veteran standout John Romita, Jr.

I originally saw most of these episodes sporadically on the BET network.  I've always been a fan of the Black Panther, back from Kirby's wild run on the catman, and I was delighted to see our Wakandan monarch in an episodic motion comic on TV.  Hudlin's story, which oversees young prince T'Challa challenging and besting the Panther in hand-to-hand combat in order to become the new Panther and then has him facing off against the adversities of the outside world encroaching onto Wakanda to obtain their sole source of Vibranium within the earth, is dense with political and interpersonal intrigue, is tangled with racial and religious vines, and is packed with action and subplots spotlighting and balancing a variety of heroes and villains including a young and inexperienced Captain America (who gets his butt handed to him by BP), Storm of the X-Men, a decidely more human but just as lethal Klaw and a troupe of his lackeys (including Batroc the Leaper and...Juggernaut?).  The members of T'Challa's house and political cabinet are also given some space to breathe.  The series crams quite a bit into its episodes.  Run together they make quite a compelling story.  But they are also broken up smartly.

The special features don't do justice to the Panther's history but they do highlight how this series came to be and what BET's involvement was in doing so.  IMO this series shows just how fascinating and exhilarating a live action BP television could be.  Here's hoping that there's more to come!

Worth it for superhero fans of pithy stories replete with political and social intrigues, violent action, and engaging characters.",1370822400,2,1894,4.980952380952381
5696096,4,B00C7FKQWS,"Letting you know the history for the Black Panther was very educational.  I enjoyed the series and look forward to learn more about T'Challa's life in Africa, before he is known to the Avengers in America.",1368316800,,205,4.694444444444445
5696097,5,B00C7FKQWS,"Marvel Studios is INSANE if they choose not to make a live action Black Panther trilogy!  This animated series should serve as the storyboards for the movie, much like Frank Miller's '300' did for its film.

Reggie Hudlin and John Romita, Jr. gave us a story arc that rivals Batman: Year One in its reinterpretation of T'Challa's origin.  Definitely a must-see for Marvelites who have waited decades for someone to do justice to this revolutionary figure in comic book history.

Jack Kirby would've been proud to see this fantastic version of his character done correctly.",1368144000,3,572,4.989473684210527
5696098,2,B00C7FKQWS,"(WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS, but honestly, you're not missing much)

Let me start off saying that I love the Black Panther. I was first introduced to his world a few years ago when I picked up the graphic novel by Reginald Hudlin and John Romita Jr., an artist whose some of his work I highly enjoy. The dialogue and art by this brilliant team operated cinematically and took me on a journey from beginning to end just like an adventure film ought to, so when I heard an animated series was going to be created, I had high hopes.

Unfortunately, being a big fan of animated shows and a hardcore fan of the Panther, I honestly expected more from the DVD. I think animating Romita's art was smart since it does have a sort of tribal flair to it in certain scenes, but could have been done better. Watching the episodes it felt stiff, rigid and lacking fluid movement and I couldn't shake the feeling that certain parts of animation from earlier episodes and parts of them kept being reused. In short, the overall animation felt half-assed and like a Power Point preview.

Considering Marvel's other animated achievements through the years such as Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, Hulk and not to mention X-Men, you would think the same efforts would have been used on a powerhouse like Black Panther. Ok, so he's not a familiar mainstream comic hero like the aforementioned, but you can't deny the strong fan base he has if you do your homework and not to mention the overall concept of the character is pretty cool. Fair to say, the full potential of this Marvel Knight was not realized and even more heartbreaking is how since 2007, fans like myself kept waiting for more news on the then upcoming show. Instead, we got stuck with an 8 episode mini-series straight to DVD and hardly promoted...and the quality shows, especially in some of the voice acting.

Also, as much as I love to love Hudlin, I think he got too caught up in his writing and tried to glorify T'Challa more than necessary. For example, a teenaged Ororo (before she was Storm of the X-Men) and her fellow orphans were slaves to a cruel owner until T'Challa arrived? I was under the assumption that even as a thief in Cairo (I think it was) that Ororo was a capable young girl and I think making T'Challa her default savior was watering down her character just to make him look big. On that subject, after the way he left her years ago, what? She just falls back into his arms like that out of the blue at the end of the mini-series? Sexist movie trope anyone? And how can she use Cerebro? She's not even PSYCHIC.

Ok fair enough granted an adaptation of a comic book will not always be 100% faithful, I can accept that. I think adding Storm into this mini-series was neat, but a rushed idea that ended up being used clumsily. The other X-Men came off as inadequate especially when fighting Juggernaut and they used their powers, but of course, the all mighty Black Panther's troops were able to take him down with...knockout gas. Great.

I really wanted to enjoy this DVD, I truly did and I'm pretty open minded when it comes to new shows, movies, etc. but what it turned out to be was nothing more than a slump of what it COULD have been and still could be. That is if BET never touches it again and Marvel gets serious about this character. A lot of talented actors' efforts were wasted on this project and I can honestly say that I don't regret dumping the DVD in the trash after trying my hardest to find what's good about it.",1368057600,3,3497,4.490566037735849

Even if your not into comics this would still be intriguing if your looking to watch something different or if you're an art or animation fan of any medium, there's just something appealing here thats better than going to the movies.

The first black superhero in the marvel universe made plenty of noise.  As other reviewers have said, the animation may not be the best, bet it was enjoyable visually to me in HD 5.1.  The writing, storylines, and the voice acting keep you fully engaged and push everything to the top.  It was interesting how they tied other marvel characters into the storyline.  There was a good mixture of action, humor, religion, culture, technology, politics, and family lines to make this a complete little mini series.  At the time of this review there are 12 fourteen minute episodes on Netflix.  I may buy the DVD.  All marvel & comic book fans should check The Black Panther out!!",1356825600,,793,4.567375886524823

I did not really care for the animation style much; however, the series stayed true to the character and the series was so well done that the animation began not to matter at all by the second episode. The pros WAY outweigh the cons. This was well done, and I hope that Marvel will pick up some of the ideas, actors, directors, and maybe even producers, when they go to make a Black Panther movie for the big screen!",1346198400,,575,4.383177570093458
5696108,4,B00C7FKQWS,"I think the Black Panther cartoon storyline was pretty good, but I didn't care much for the animation. It seemed to be a bit controversial for some, but it is what it is. It's one man's interpretation of the story of the Black Panther, but what else is new. cartoons and even movies change themes and origin stories all the time. What i liked most, is that the African characters were entertaining, and portrayed as wise and intelligent, which I find, as Black man to be lacking in alot of television shows and movies. Some didn't care for the storyline because it was a bit  raw and less comic book-like, but remember one thing...It's just a cartoon! For example one person gave it a one because he thought Captain America shouldn't have been bested in battle by the Black Panther. All I can say is ""grow up""..how many comic books have you read where the lead character was beaten by his adversary in his own country? Seems a bit fishy to me to focus on that. There was also a few that complained that the story took cheap shots at the church. Again..GROW UP. There are in fact religious zealots in the world and it just so happens that there was one in the story..much like in many comic books I have read. It was just a story! You should be asking yourself, if you were so concerned with the way they portrayed Christianity in the cartoon, why weren't you just as concerned with the racist comments made by the characters in the cartoon?. As a Christian myself, I wasn't concerned with the bit Christian storyline, I mean God said Christians will be persecuted, get used to it. A better question would be, why the racial slurs didn't bother you as a Christian?..I think those who gave 1's did so because of other issues, not because of any percieved attack on the church.  You were looking too deep. If you expected Captian America to be the toughest man in Wakanda too, you're sadly Mistaken. The Panther is their hero. And since all these characters are ""fictional"" anyway.....get a life. All in all, it was entertaining, if you didn't look too deeply. The animation.not so great. If and when they make a Panther live action movie..to those who complained about Captain America not beating the Panther...he probably won't win the fight in the movie either.",1343606400,,2261,4.594059405940594
5696109,5,B00C7FKQWS,"This is a great series. I was excited on the title alone but it is not what I thought it would be. Black Panther has a great storyline but I feel like Crane as a villian should have been replaced. I like the Knight with the white horse. The writing was exceptional during that episode especially during the speech he gave.

I enjoy the theme song during the opening credits and seeing the rich African fictitious culture throughout the script. This is a high quality project and definitely deserves to be made into a movie or placed among the line of Marvel characters in other movies.

Keri Washington did a great job with the dialect. I could not tell which character was hers before looking at the credits and Jill Scott did well as Storm. i really like the Storm storyline and hope it develops into something more.",1342569600,,818,4.52027027027027
5696110,1,B00C7FKQWS,"It's really strange how so any people find the story deep, interesting and great. The Wakanda is advertised as the strongest country ever, with kick ass technology, super soldiers and apparently they have the secret to ultimate wisdom too. But it's actually a country like any other : Wakandans can be jealous, hate each other for no reason, and they shut up women when they get annoying (or express an opinion they don't like), also they  wear very classy suits with bow-ties, the TV speakers use the same expressions and comparisons as any bad sport journalist on the planet, and their secret services are as good as those of ""lesser"" countries.
It's hard to believe the Wakanda was never conquered when you see how easily it is done : you get a very well known super-villain to just run thought the Wakanda, literally, and even though they have all this advanced technology and intel, no one can stop him. Also, you shoot a missile at the most fortified site in Wakanda, and there are no defences ready for that either. If the missile was a A-bomb, good bye Wakanda. You can also get a radioactive villain to attack the vibranium, and again, the Wakandans are defences less against that. It's not as if they have been studying and using vibranium for centuries and knows exactly how it works and how to protect it. You can also send a man armed with a sword, flying a pegasus, he'll tear down all the super advanced air force of the country. And then you send assassins to infiltrate the most secured places of Wakanda. How do they do that with absolutely no information on the infrastructure and security systems? Meh, I guess they got lucky. And then one of these assassins can hack into the most advanced computer system on the planet, while said system is completely alien to him, just like that. And again, no defences are ready for that.
So the attack on Wakanda should have failed before it begins. If Wakanda can fall so easily, then it should have been conquered centuries ago. On top of that, what does the Black Panther do while his country is being obliterated? Well the man who is spiritually more advanced than anyone else abandons everyone, flees the battlefield, just so he can get his revenge on the guy who killed his father 10 years ago. Disappointing.
All of that being said, I like the graphics, it's interesting and I want to see more of that. The meeting with Captain America was good too. I don't have any problem with how easily BL defeated Cap. The Wakandans being so advanced, their army probably have a super-soldier serum of their own. They also follow an extraordinary rigorous training, and it is well said that Cap was just a newbie at the time, unseasoned and probably ill-trained.
In the end, it could have been good if the story was there. But it's just a bunch of cheap shots at the Church, the US and every industrialised countries out there.

5696120,5,B00C7FKQWS,"I've seen a few motion comics but this one has to be one of the better ones I've seen. Plus, it actually had a good story!

For those of you that aren't familiar with The Black Panther. He is an African king of a nation in Africa called Wakanda. A nation (in the Marvel Universe) that has a reputation of being fierce warriors and technologically more advanced than China, Japan, The Middle East or even The United States! Furthermore, they have never been conquered or defeated in their history!

As for the Panther title itself, it is a hereditary title that is usually passed on through the generations but can be earned by a Wakandan citizen through combat with whoever is the current Black Panther.

This story is of the current B.P., T'Challa. He gains the throne through this combat and in addition to ruling Wakanda, he is also looking for the man that murdered his father and younger brother when he was a child. Meanwhile, that man (who is a revamped version of Klaw) is assembling his own force which includes a version of The Black Knight, The Juggernaut and Batroc The Leaper to take over Wakanda and finish the job of taking out the whole Panther bloodline! The United States Government is also looking to move in for their own interests.

Storm of the X-Men, who in the comics becomes T'Challa's wife, also makes an appearance as she comes to aid B.P. and the Wakanda nation in their battle.

It has and makes an interesting commentary on how people view each other in the world and makes subtile statements and stances on many subjects, particularly racism, religion and faith.

There is some violence in it that is brief but at times graphic. I would recommend this movie to older kids to adults as this may not be suitable for young children. It stars Djimon Hounsou as Black Panther/T'Challa, Kerry Washington as Suri (B.P.'s sister), Alfre Woodard as Queen Mother & Doni Reese (the latter character is a take on Condolezza Rice) and R & B singer Jill Scott as Storm.

5696122,1,B00C7FKQWS,"Two things greatly turned me off to the Black Panther DVD. 1. Unnecessary foolish political correctness or propaganda sprinkled into the story and,
2. Characters whose powers have been greatly altered, decreased or increased from comic book portrayal.
Black Panther is one of the best characters in comics an I eagerly bought this DVD. Unfortunately, I found that every time I tried to get into it, I was fed blatant doses of propaganda. The DVD was littered with  shocking shots at Christianity, Bush administration and America. As a black man I was actually embarrassed by scenes where a general under Bush's command makes spear chucker reference about Wakanda, an when Obama gets on the phone with the Black Panther like they're tight homies an Obama is left to ""clean up"" Bush's diplomatic mess with Wakanda. Laughable, if it wasn't so pathetic. Id swear this DVD was made as an Obama campaign tool! I hear enough of that BS in real life an don't need to see it in an animated DVD. In addition, I was disappointed in how the characters Batroc and Juggernaut were used.

When I first saw Black Panther he was an unimpressive member of the Avengers.  The writer (Roy Thomas) didn't seem to like the character and hardly did anything of note with him.  When Lee and Kirby created the Black Panther in the Fantastic Four comic he was a wonderful character that was full of great potential.  Other writers just didn't seem to understand or care about the character.  Thankfully his story is now being told by writers that like and respect the character.

This sparely animated series is adapted from Reginald Hudlin's opening story that began his three year run as writer.  This DVD contains a great story with a very talented voice cast.  The story does contradict some of the panther's past history.  I also wish it could have been fully animated.

Marvel Comics' first Black Super-Hero returns for the first time in an all-new animated feature DVD.  Originally commissioned to air on Black Entertainment Television, unforeseen complications scuttled an American broadcast, but now this eight-part mini-series is finally collected on a single DVD!

5696131,4,B00C7FKQWS,"Reginald Hudlin's take on the classic Marvel character Black Panther gets the animated take with this series originally produced for BET (but sadly never saw air time in America).  Hudlin adapts his first Black Panther storyarc here, in which young Wakandan king T'Challa (voiced by Djimon Hounsou) takes the reigns of the Black Panther identity as the villainous Klaw attempts to finish what he started when he murdered T'Challa's father years before.  Along for the ride are T'Challa's life-long-love Storm of the X-Men, as well as the Juggernaut, hordes of murderous Dethlok soldiers, and even a few surprises as well.  I was never that huge of a fan of Hudlin's run on the comic, but this short-lived animated series not only wonderfully captures the political intrigue and action of Hudlin's story, but also vibrantly re-creates John Romita Jr's artwork into animated form, even if it looks too much like a motion-comic.

The animation (if you can call it that), was interesting.  It basically looks like someone took excerpts from the comic itself and spliced it onto the screen.  So it looks more like a comic book than a movie.  But despite that, the story is GREAT.  It's original and it includes cameos from the X-Men...my favorite Marvel superheroes.

I've always been a fan of Marvel mainly because they were the first mainstream publisher to integrate and show the world Black Superheroes. The ""Who is the Black Panther"" storyline is one that I urge all Black people to read comic book fans or not. Of course we all know that Wakanda is a fictional land that has resisted colonization by the Umricah (America), or any other country, due to their advanced alien technology and an abundance of a fictional virtually indestructable metal known as Vibranium. However, that being the case a look into the concept of Wakanda offers a look into the root of all problems in the countries of Africa. That problem being the Euro-Centric invaders that have divided the nations of Africa like a thanksgiving turkey and robbed it of its richness and resources. This is a good introduction into the de-conditioning of Black Americans, in my humble opinion of course.

5696142,5,B00C7FKQWS,"1. First, people should be aware that this is not a movie, but an 8 episode mini-series.

2. The animation style is different, somewhere between ""normal"" animation and a motion comic, but the art is John Romita Jr.'s and is first rate.  If you are the sort of person who gets upset that not all animation looks like your favorite ""cartoons"", this might bother you.  If you are the sort of person who can relax and appreciate a unique style for what it is, then do that, and you'll see it is appropriate and really well done.

3. The voice acting is simply STELLAR.  This voice talent and direction here is superb.  We even get Stan Lee himself voicing a crotchety, loud-mouthed general, and getting it just right.

4. Characters of almost infinite lameness, e.g. Klaw (the guy ""made of sound"") and Batroc (""the leaper"") are re-imagined in interesting and subtle ways, transforming them into both credible threats and working to build a Black Panther mythos.

5. Some people are upset that the Black Panther lays the smack down on Captain America.  It *is* clearly emphasized that Cap has just started out (he has the old, pointy shield to prove it) ... and this Black Panther of the WW II era has MUCH more experience.  And let's be honest, the Black Panther is in Captain America's weight class (I'd put Wolverine in there too).  And do you know a better way to establish a character as a formidable fighter than to show him taking down Captain America (after a hard fight)?  And as ""generic state department guy"" reminds us, the Panther did take out the Fantastic Four, all four of them, in his first appearance (canonically, in the comics).  The Black Panther is TOUGH, Cap was trespassing, assuming that an African country mainly counted as a stage for his fight with the Nazis, and the Panther showed him the door.

6. The music is remarkable, incorporating many African styles -- appropriate, since (nearly) all the action takes place in Africa.  I understand the composer even created elements of the Wakandan language, appropriate that area of Africa.

7. The series succeeds in making it very much a family story, placing T'Challa's mother, uncle (the previous Black Panther), and sister front and center in the story, not pushed off to the side.

8.  The series doesn't make any bones about taking place in a political context of a world where various European powers have felt that Africa belongs by right to them, rather than Africans, a history that is of course still very much with us.  If you don't like your super-hero stories to touch on actual political and historical themes, go rent a Super Friends DVD, this isn't for you.  (I take it back.  Even the Super Friends tried to make a positive political statement, as painful and clumsy as it seems today, with characters like ""Black Vulcan"" and ""Apache Chief '... *winces at the memory*).  Is it coincidence that that the super-villain team that attacks Wakanda (which lies basically at the heart of Africa) is led by a Belgian, and includes a Frenchman, an Englishman, an American, and a Russian?  (I also enjoyed Batroc's comeback to the Juggernaut's taunt about the US saving France during WW II, ""Yes, you owed us one for helping you win your Revolution."")

9. The portrayal of the Roman Catholic Church is rather absurd if taken at face value -- and we're left wondering why the Black Knight is a Catholic zealot, instead of, say, a good Anglican, fighting for the Church of England.  I believe the writers succeed in calling attention to the fact that political and economic imperialism rarely occur apart from religious imperialism.  My guess is that this was less sloppy writing than a convenient way to portray both the Catholic Church's history in Africa as well as Great Britain's.  ""Christianizing and civilizing the heathen African savages"" was a crucial part of the justificatory rhetoric of colonialism after all.  The portrayal of organized religion is rather absurd and unfair, and does a disservice to all the good that was been done by the Church in Africa.  There are more Roman Catholics in Africa today than in Europe, and it is likely that the future of Christianity will belong to Africa (at least the foreseeable future).

10.  Minor point of annoyance for me: the substitution of the Juggernaut for the Rhino (who was in the comic book run).  It's completely understandable why they did it: because it created an entirely plausible reason to work Ororo into the storyline.  But 1. you can't stop the Juggernaut with knock-out gas.  If you could, everyone would just do that, and he wouldn't be very unstoppable, now would he?; and 2. come on, who doesn't want to see THE RHINO actually in Africa?  It's too hilarious NOT to do.  Oh well.  On the other hand, I can't think of a better way to get Storm involved in the action either.

11. In sum, Art: 5 stars, Voice acting: 5 stars, Music: 5 stars, Characters: well written and complex, Story: some implausible parts, but succeeds on a deeper level, touching on more serious social, cultural, and political issues, without being too heavy handed about it.",1298073600,151,5099,4.771949828962372

5696146,4,B00C7FKQWS,"The actual DVD comes in a little slim-case like what marvel has done for their Motion Comic releases. Now I understand that this is done in Motion Comic style, but it is not a Motion Comic. It's a TV Show. And it's certainly not what I think of when I think Motion Comics. I think of ""Astonishing X-Men"" or ""Spider-Woman"" or ""Batman Black and White"". With really stiff, slow animation. Now ""Astonishing"" is the best motion comic I've ever seen, with it's pseudo 3D models moving around. But this is nothing like that. To me this looks more like animated shows like ""Archer"".
So, in short (too late) I'm rather annoyed at the flimsy little case, and wish that it had a real DVD slip-case.

Also, I guess this isn't the fault of anyone but the marketing people. But most sites I've seen list an interview with Djimon Hounsou as one of the features. It's not on my DVD case, or on the DVD. That ticks me off.

But anyway. The actual feature was good.

I really liked the visual style of this show. The somewhat slow/stiff bodies reminded me of the really lousy (but neat) 60s Marvel cartoons mixed with like Johnny Quest. And the actual action scenes and fights are pretty swift and fast paced. I really enjoyed how they copied the comic book art style.

I also like (for the most part) how the subject matter was handled. Very mature, though a bit heavy-handed at times.

I've heard a few people talk about how this show is racist and biased against white people in various reviews, but I absolutely do not agree. There are good characters, bad characters, nice guys, and buttholes, regardless of race in this show.
For instance, at the beginning we get a general (Stan Lee's cameo) calling Wakandans savages, and all the other white people in the room go silent and recoil from him in PC shock. But later we have a member of the Wakandan council calling the rest of the world ""barbarians"" and nobody bats an eye.
The majority of Wakandans shown in this show are just as hateful, narrowminded, and racially biased as everyone else. Even the former King T'Chaka. He is presumptuous and spiteful and condescending toward all of the outsiders he meets.
And some of my favorite bits come from a French Assassin, who is very respectful toward Africa, and the Wakandans (he's only there for the money), and Juggernaut dissin' the French (and their little argument).
I'm sad that it's only 6 episodes, especially because of how it ends. I wish it could have continued.

After watching it again, I have mixed feelings.
I think the misuse of some of the characters, and the lack of use from other characters (the X-Men), was annoying. The show seems to be a little too preachy at times. But over all it's great. I really loved the voice acting, and the music, and the visuals.

But the BEST part of the show and the DVD...
the theme music. And the music video that features the extended version. Oh yeah!!! I admit, I'm rather addicted to this song.",1296259200,3,2938,4.563567362428842

5696149,5,B00C7FKQWS,"I just want to say that I enjoyed this cartoon.  The art was very stylized and the voice acting was on point.  Kerry Washington made me like the character Shuri, even though I hate her in the comics.  Djimon was great as the panther and the villain Klaw was very convincing.  Based off the artwork of JRJR I think the motion comic captured the dynamic action of the comic.  I especially liked to see The Altruistic Captain America be something other than the 2 dimensional war dog who can do no wrong.  I think some people will be offended by the portrayal of America in the comic, but I caution these people to think from the perspective of the oppressed.  America may be the best out there but she is not without bloody gloves.  To Africans and other peoples in America and around the world we are Rome.  We need to see that instead of the right wing propaganda machine of the past 80 years.  That being said I don't think this show focuses on the negative of america only, it is just one story and in this particular story the american influence was negative; In others America would be in a better light.  Thats the thing about real life and authentic story telling; no character is all bad and none all good.  It would be foolish and out dated to portray them as such, this isn't the 1950s.
I also want to reassure white viewers that this is not about ALL WHITE PEOPLE BEING EVIL or CHRISTIANS ARE TRYING TO CONQUER THE WORLD, it is just showing what SOME evil Colonialists would and have done in this particular story.  Colonialism should not be defended in any forum I think that history has shown the perils of the Colonial outlook on life.

2. The US is portrayed as being some gov't run by unpowered supervillains who hire mercenaries to take out Black Panther. Why??? If the US wants to take over Wakanda, SHIELD, Nick Fury.

3. Black Knight gives some outlandish speech about Christianity being needed by the Africans, umh Christiainity has been in Africa since the time of the Apostles. Go read a history book Hudlin!

4. BP goes after the dictator of neighboring Niganda. Why??? HE LEAVES HIS COUNTRY UNDER ATTACK!!! Is BP simple?

5. The Catholic Church is still fighting Holy Wars??? Moreso, why are they even involved??

6. The Wakandans are portrayed as being oh so virtuous and not one of them, NOT ONE is a scummy lowlife. But the US, Catholic Church and the ""EVIL"" corporations of the world are. Why then is Wakanda still around. I don't care how tough and ""advanced"" they are. If everyone on the planet is out to get you. IT'S OVER, nuff said.

7. Black Panther comes off more as a simple-minded, angry angst ridden over-edumacated (yeah i spelled it right) juvenile with issues from one of our ""glorious"" politically-correct institutions of higher unlearning then the anyone I'd let run my toilet much less a country.
