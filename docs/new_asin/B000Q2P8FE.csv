8194046,4,B000Q2P8FE,"I love Charleston the city and this is a loving documentary of same. Its rather limited in its range of vision however, mostly close-ups that ignore the grime and the poverty. The old part of the city by the headwaters IS very nice, very exclusive and lush with history - I liked that a lot, and the old plantations, naturally, are ripe for daydreaming. Some really good film shots here using airplane - scenes you can't get even visiting. I did appreciate references to the rice plantation culture and how brutal it was to the slaves that were forced to farm it. Some great cinematic shots here also. Many of the planters, however, also died of the malaria infected mosquitoes, it would have been informative to have had some detail on that. What I thought was especially missing was images of the decay and grime of modern buildings, streets, neighborhoods. Blacks still seemed to me to be hostile and not very happy-go-lucky as this film projects. Also, I would have appreciated some focus on the biographies of the famous and very influential old families during the Revolutionary Period, such as the Pinckneys, rather than interviews with present residents. Except the old lady recounting how loud the plantations had been during slavery days and how ghostly quiet they were now - that was a very good scene. All in all, I enjoyed this film and thought the director did a good job. It makes a good introduction to those just starting out either traveling or researching the South.",1267315200,4,1485,4.782101167315175
