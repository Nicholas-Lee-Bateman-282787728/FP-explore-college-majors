3122546,5,B00144NHV0,"GREEN ACRES (SEASONS 1-3): No one in the sleepy southern whistle-stop of HOOTERVILLE seemed quite ""normal"" other than transplanted big city lawyer turned gentleman farmer OLIVER WENDALL DOUGLAS, brilliantly underplayed by EDDIE ALBERT. His perpetually dilapidated homestead also housed EVA GABOR's ditzy spouse LISA, who specialized in not-so-hotcakes, glamorous gowns, and fractured English. Spacey farm hand EB, county agent HANK KIMBALL, who seemed incable of completing a thought, and money-hungry traveling salesman MR. HANEY (played by ex-GENE AUTRY sidekick PAT BUTTRAM) rounded out the quirky cast; general store proprieter SAM DRUCKER pulled double duty on creator PAUL HENNING's slightly less warped sister show PETTICOAT JUNCTION. In spite of this collection of eccentric characters and colorful rubes, the spotlight was regularly hijacked by that lovable ham ARNOLD ZIFFEL, a precocious pig whose grunts everyone understood...except OLIVER, of course. The series' insanely catchy theme song, guest appearances from the PETTICOAT JUNCTION cast, and oddly believable characterizations all around sowed the seeds of GREEN ACRES' success.

3122558,5,B00144NHV0,"I love this old comedy series! The satirical humor is unequaled by any of today's sitcoms. The transfer quality of these DVDs are very good for shows dating back to the mid-sixties. There are absolutely no added feature on these DVDs, which would have been nice, only the episodes. Even so, that would have been fine if MGM had released ALL SIX SEASONS of the show, instead of only three! As both a fan of the show and a consumer, I find this unforgivable! In my opinion, a studio should release all seasons of a particular show once they have made the decision to start releasing them. Apparently, MGM didn't see enough of a profit margin to finish releasing the series (hard to believe since they can print DVDs for less than a buck apiece).

Then last week when we went to watch it, we found out that we were sent 2 of the first disc and not the second one for the first season.

3122561,5,B00144NHV0,"This is a very helpful series. For all those people that read ""Home and Garden"" you now have a program that shows the upside to farming.

This is the Complete third season, consisting of 696 minutes of run time; so I suggest that you start early in the day if you have to work tomorrow. And do not be too impulsive and rush out to buy that farm. The package comes with two DVDs and a pamphlet describing in brief each episode. However you better have good eyes as both sides of the DVD are recorded on, leaving no room for labeling.

Fort many this is the first time to be introduced to such strong acting characters as Arnold (rumor has it became dinner at the end of the series). For the rest of us, we have an opportunity to visit old friends and see an episode or two that may have been missed. With any luck we will have the opportunity to buy the next season.

Oliver Wendell Douglas, born on a farm, and stayed there for two days, wants to get back to his roots. The opportunity arises and he purchases the Haney place from Eustace Charleton Haney himself. His wife gets the opportunity to share with him the challenges to adjust to the farm life?

Go for it and get all three seasons now. It never loses that something that makes you addicted to the series and want more.

There is an urban legend that when the series finished Arnold became lunch.

If you appreciate this fine program than you will enjoy reading ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" by Frances Mayes, where the story is retold Italian style.

3357058,5,B00144NHV0,"This is a very helpful series. For all those people that read ""Home and Garden"" you now have a program that shows the upside to farming.

This is the Complete third season, consisting of 696 minutes of run time; so I suggest that you start early in the day if you have to work tomorrow. And do not be too impulsive and rush out to buy that farm. The package comes with two DVDs and a pamphlet describing in brief each episode. However you better have good eyes as both sides of the DVD are recorded on, leaving no room for labeling.

Fort many this is the first time to be introduced to such strong acting characters as Arnold (rumor has it became dinner at the end of the series). For the rest of us, we have an opportunity to visit old friends and see an episode or two that may have been missed. With any luck we will have the opportunity to buy the next season.

Oliver Wendell Douglas, born on a farm, and stayed there for two days, wants to get back to his roots. The opportunity arises and he purchases the Haney place from Eustace Charleton Haney himself. His wife gets the opportunity to share with him the challenges to adjust to the farm life?

Go for it and get all three seasons now. It never loses that something that makes you addicted to the series and want more.

There is an urban legend that when the series finished Arnold became lunch.

If you appreciate this fine program than you will enjoy reading ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" by Frances Mayes, where the story is retold Italian style.

3357059,4,B00144NHV0,Great deal for the money. I loved watching the old series. Only drawback is that you must have a remote to go between each episode. It will not allow you to play all. Good production of this family clean fun show. Its hard to find something clean and enjoyable these days that is suitable for children to watch.  This is it!!,1243296000,6,325,4.327868852459017

This is so much better than the dippy junk on tv today that there is simply no comparison.
Oliver Douglas is a big shot New York lawyer who always wanted to be a farmer. Lisa, his wife, doesn`t share his ambitions.
But they end up at Green Acres, a run down farm in the Hooterville valley when Oliver finally decides to live his dream.",1242518400,3,406,4.151898734177215

3357062,4,B00144NHV0,"These Green Acres episodes are delightful, in so much as they are exactly what they were in the 1960's, innocent, tongue and cheek humor, and characters you can love and loathe.

from 70's, dick van dyke as well as thriller mystery horror and cop shows. Most didn't last more than a few seasons and we only got to see the
cut versions in reruns until finally they released them on DVD and you realize just how funny and creative all of these shows were back then
and even better when you can watch the entire episode without cuts and over and over again. This show was and still one of my favorites
with the smart  witty comedy and great characters with great actors. Of course now comedy has to be crude and vulgar to be funny! No
these shows were written with great stories and one liners and are just funny! This show is what real comedy is and should be. A Classic.",1476835200,,836,4.291139240506329
