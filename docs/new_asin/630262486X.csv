7828138,3,630262486X,"The Great American West is a documentary narrated by Jason Robards. It shows magnificent landscapes from all over the west as it traces the expansion of non-Indians across the continent. For its gorgeous vistas alone it rates five stars.

HOWEVER, the photo which accompanies the listed product is for The Great American West OF JOHN FORD. It is a different video which shows various clips from western films that John Ford made, notably starring the likes of John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart. Those who sell one video or the other continuously confuse them. If the buyer tries to order The Great American West, the seller invariably ships The Great American West OF JOHN FORD. Could someone at Amazon PLEASE differentiate between the two???? Most sellers don't realize that they are advertising one product as the other, and Amazon has done nothing to rectify the confusion as evidenced by the product information listed versus the photo attached. Amazon rates ZERO STARS for this, and its Sellers ONE STAR for their sheer stupidity. PLEASE make sure that what you are selling is the appropriate product!!!!

It is a shame that Amazon can't get this straight, because The Great West American West is so good yet smothered by sellers who are advertising the wrong product under its name.",1271030400,,1283,4.962790697674419
