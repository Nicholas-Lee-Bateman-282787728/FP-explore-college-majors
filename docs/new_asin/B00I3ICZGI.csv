6248242,4,B00I3ICZGI,"With a Sesame Street vid, you have to judge on three qualities: educational, entertainment for the kids, and entertainment for the adults.

Great, non-preachy manners guide. Addresses how kids can be so excited they forget their manners (Rosita pushing Baby Bear because she just CAN'T WAIT for her turn) self-regulating, forgiving people who try to be polite but just don't have it down yet.

Very entertaining for my young child.

The celebrity cameos were uneven.  In a horrible miscalculation, they had some of the celebs film their bits in front of green screens, separate from the muppets and even the other actors. This led to a stiff acting style which prevented interaction with muppet performers. You didn't see the green screen line around the people but you could tell the actors were trying to remember where the muppets and set were. I understand the money-saving necessity of the green screen to save on set building (especially when they are not using the set but only standing in front of it) but when it hampers the performers interacting it becomes extremely irritating.

David Hyde Pierce was the highest billed celeb, and he had what should have been a wonderful skit as a cookie expert visiting Hooper's Store and running into Cookie Monster--trying to teach him to be classy. He's being Niles, of course, but it's off. Was he tired the day of filming? Niles's prissy fussiness was always funny because DHP performed it with a spark of irony, joy, even--and that's absent here.  He's just fussy, not ironic. But the SS actors, Alan and Chris, are warm and funny.

The best celeb cameo was Zach Efron, who actually DID interact with the muppet performer, and seems aware that he is talking to kids, and seems to love them. Colbie Smulders and Henry Cavill were also good, by which I mean they conveyed that manners are a way to interact meaningfully with people, rather than a dictate from mean ol' grownups.

A little sophisticated for the preschool crowd to understand (they cover putting your napkin on your lap!), but entertaining enough that from that age to even age 9 could watch it and find it interesting.",1422144000,3,2135,4.846153846153846

6248244,4,B00I3ICZGI,"We love Cookie Monster in this household, and was very happy to see him in this dvd. The pace was a little slower than what would keep a 13 month old engaged. There was more talking than singing. I think it will be enjoyed more as she gets older. I'm a fan of all of the new Sesame Street releases. This one didn't disappoint.",1405900800,2,326,4.109375
