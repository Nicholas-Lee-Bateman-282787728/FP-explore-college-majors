400979,5,6301976215,"the 1937 ""prisoner of zenda"" ranks among my favorite of all films.  colman gives a wonderful performance as the 2 rudolfs, the rightful king and the man who should have been.
there are flawless supporting  performances from raymond massey, c. aubrey smith, a young david niven, and  above all douglas fairbanks, jr. as rupert of hentzau: one of the finest  villains ever created on film, and the main reason for the dismal failure  of the otherwise acceptable 1952 remake (i refer to the miscasting of the  usually fine james mason).
there are sword fights galore, treachery,  romance, etc.: everything you would associate with a piece like this.  it  ranks up there with errol flynn's best films, and is the finest of colman's  wonderful costumers.
this is a MUST HAVE!",955756800,4,770,4.89922480620155
400980,5,6301976215,"This meticulous Selznick production is about as posh as movies come. The majestic sets and costumes are dazzling and  the technical details are spendid. Colman and Carroll are perfectly wonderful in the leads, in fact,  exceptional performances are given by all: Fairbanks is superb as the  lethal rascal Rupert and Massey is perfect as the scheming Prince Michael;  Smith is charming and heroically stalwart as the King's aide. Beyond the  flawless visual elegance provided by Cromwell, the script is witty,  literate and lyrical to the point of poetry and Newman's sweeping score is  triumphant. Patrician Madeleine is surely the most regally beautiful  princess in the history of the movies!",947721600,,694,5.302752293577981
400981,5,6301976215,"The reviews below sum it up--This is the most romantic movie ever made. Seeing Colman fall for Princess Flavia and how she fell in love with a king that she thought she despised really tugged at me.  Great style and  pageantry. I loved the supporting cast, especially Aubrey Smith as the  voice of duty and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as the swashbuckling villian.",932515200,2,358,4.741935483870968
400982,5,6301976215,"This is the only one and true version of this timeless classic. It takes you back when ""Politics had not yet outgrown the waltz"". Ronald Colman is outstanding in a dual role as both Rudolf Rassendyll and King  Rudolf. He should have received the Academy Award for this excellent  performance. Colman plays the role which such charm and flair. It is a  perfect portrayal of a King. The supporting cast is awesome: Madeleine  Carroll as Princess Flavia, the most beautiful princess I've ever seen on  screen. David Niven as Capt. Fritz Von Talinheim and C. Aubrey Smith as the  faithful Col. Zapt, loyal officers of the King. Raymond Massey as Prince  Michael, the evil half brother of the King and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as  Count Rupert, Prince Michael's henchman. The Coronation and Royal Ball  scenes are breathtaking! And the classic sword fight between Colman and  Fairbanks is exciting to say the least! Such a classic treasure of film  making. I highly recommend this classic film. You'll want to see it over  and over again!",930873600,6,1030,4.85632183908046

401064,5,6301976215,"An old ""Variety"" review described this 1937 classic as ""24 carat hokum"". That it is, with the emphasis on the 24 carats. The plot revolves around Ronald Colman, an Englishman on a hunting vacation in an eponymous Eastern European country. The about to be crowned king vanishes and Colman is persuaded to take his place until the true monarch can be rescued. (It's the missing King who is the ""prisoner"" of Zenda). The acting is outstanding all around, particularly by Madeleine Carroll in the role of the lovely young handpicked Queen with a strong sense of duty. An august C. Aubrey Smith and an astonishingly young David Niven ably play the good guys.  The roles of bad guys are equally well portrayed by Raymond Massey and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. The latter is actually a semi-likeable villain. A key character is that of Mary Astor but this reviewer won't divulge her actions. Viewers should watch her closely! The final scene with Smith, Niven and Colman is an absolute classic with a dashing fadeout. We all know they don't make movies like this anymore. Where could present day Hollywood find a cast of this quality and stature?",1059264000,7,1133,4.81025641025641
401065,4,6301976215,"A classic, old-fashioned adventure flick, featuring Ronald Coleman as a dashing young Englishman on vacation in a nameless Central European backwater.  When an attempted coup unfolds, his striking likeness to that country's reluctant, wastrel king leads to his conscription as a stand-in monarch, a task which he meets with typical British pluck.  Coleman's dual acting role is a negligible achievement, but he's fine as the hero; Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. gets in some choice scenery chewing as the oily baddie who backs the evil Duke Michael in his attempt to steal the crown.  Some great, artily arranged camera shots and moody, shadowy sets, and plenty of flashy, spangly costumes.  (Now... is it just me, or does Mary Astor, who plays a bad-gal-gone-good, bear a striking resemblance here to 1990s actress Julianna Moore?)  Recommended!",1041811200,,838,5.318181818181818
401066,3,6301976215,"The Prisoner of Zenda pales by comparison to some of the all time greatest swashbuckling movies like The Adventures of Robin Hood or Scaramouche.  Ronald Colman although oratorically gifted and aristocratic seems wimpy in his dual role of King Rudolph and his double Major Rudolph Rassendyll.  Douglas Fairbanks, playing the cocky, womanizing bad guy provides a more than adequate supporting performance.  Madeleine Carroll makes a beautiful and convincing Princess Flavia.  Raymond Massey miscast as the scoundrel Black Prince Michael reminded me more of a German U boat commander than a European aristocrat.  The absolute star of the movie was C. Aubrey Smith playing his usual role as a crusty old military remnant of colonial Victorian times.  That portrayal even worked as Eastern European Colonel Zapt, the trusted aide to King Rudolph.
Overall the acting was decent but even the sword fighting scene was rather limp.  I'm wondering if there was ever a story where someone is a double for the local dog catcher rather than the king?",1037750400,,1038,5.179640718562874
401067,5,6301976215,"The 30s and 40s were they heyday of the swashbuckler and The Prisoner of Zenda is certainly one of the finest. It combines the action, the intrigue and the melodrama that makes a swashbuckler so irresistable.
Based on the short novel by Anthony Hope, The Prisoner of Zenda is the tale of an Englishman (Ronald Colman) who discovers that he resembles his distant cousin, the heir to the throne of Ruritania, a small eastern European kingdom. The plot is of course very familiar, the use of look alikes as a plot device is older than the hills. But, in both the book and the movie, the plot is handled in such a jaunty manner that it is thoroughly charming.
Though slightly older than the character in the book, Ronald Colman as Rudolph Rasendyll brings a worold weary charm. He is an ordinary man thrust into extraordinary circumstances. Colman is also good as the drunked heir to the throne though this character does not receive nearly as much screentime.
Madeleine Carroll is a lovely leading lady. Raymond Massey plays a plotting villain. Mary Astor is marvelous as the woman scorned. A young David Niven is one of Colman's earnest friends.
But the movie belongs to someone who was a minor villain in the book. (Though the full fledged heavy in the sequel) Rupert of Hentzau, the flashy, wild and wicked right hand man to Massey's evil Duke Michael. Douglas Fairbanks Jr. was generally cast as the boyish hero, as Rupert he is still boyish but in a rather twisted way. While he works for Michael, he is still in it for himself. He wants Michael's position, Michael's lands and Michael's girlfriend. (Mary Astor who, ironically, was the leading lady in Son of Zorro starring Douglas Fairbanks Sr.)
The movie is for the most part faithful to the book, it's main departure is in making the final duel between Rasendyll and Rupert. In the book, Rupert was one of six henchman and Rasendyll battled and English rogue. I must say, putting Rupert in the spotlight was a very good choice.
It's not giving anything away to say that the final duel is just marvelous. As he was in the book, Rasendyll is no master swordsman. He gets by, but he is forced to cheat (throw furniture, etc.) in order to survive against Rupert. There is the expected banter between the antogonists and several close calls. Perfect display of 30s showmanship, right on par with The Adventures of Robin Hood and Captain Blood.
In short, this is the definative version of the classic. It is certainly not perfect but it is so enjoyable that any minor flaws are smoothed away. If nothing else, see it for Fairbanks's delightful acting and the great golden age sets and costumes. A swashbuckling fan's delight!",1027468800,10,2675,4.717948717948718
401068,5,6301976215,"This is the definitive adaptation of the Anthony Hope novel of the same name. The charming and velvet voiced Ronald Colman plays a dual role: that of Rasendyll, a British commoner, and that of Rudolf, a distant cousin and the man who would be King.

Rasendyll is vacationing in a mythical country where his distant cousin and doppelganger, Prince Rudolf, is soon to be crowned King. A chance meeting between the two shows the commoner to be the more noble of the two. When Rudolf temporarily succumbs to a plot that renders him temporarily unconscious and unable to make his all important coronation, the look a like Rasendyll is pressed into service and takes his place.

When Rasendyll shows up at the coronation as Rudolf, Michael (Raymond Massey), the jealous half brother who hatched to plot to prevent Rudolf from making his coronation is taken by surprise and constrained from saying anything as to do so would reveal his part in the plot. Michael's henchman, Hentzau (Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.), soon discovers that the man who was crowned King is an imposter. He finds and takes as prisoner the unconscious Rudolf.

In the meantime, Rasendyll, as the newly crowned King Rudolf, meets and falls in love with the Princess (Madeleine Carroll) who is intended to be his Queen. Soon after meeting him, she notices that he seems different from the Rudolf that she thought  she knew and falls in love with him.

When Rasendyll is informed that his cousin is now a prisoner, he loses no time in going to the rescue with Rudolf's two faithful retainers, Colonel Zapt (C. Aubrey Smith) and Captain Fritz Von Talinheim (David Niven). This is followed by some swashbuckling swordplay between the rascally Hentzau and the noble at heart Rassendyll, the man who should be King.

To find out how it ends, watch the movie. You will not be disappointed. Ronald Colman is divinely charming in his dual role. C. Aubrey Smith and a very young and delightful David Niven are terrific as Rudolf's faithful and loyal officers. Raymond Massey is appropriately sinister as the jealous half brother. Madeleine Carroll is beautiful as the story book princess who falls in love with Rassendyll but knows where her duty lies. It is Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., however, who deserves special mention, as in playing the role of the swashbuckling Hentzau he very nearly steals the show out from under Ronald Colman!

Fans of Ronald Colman and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. will especially love this film, as will all those who love classic films.",1009065600,2,2508,4.8870588235294115

When the prince keels over drugged by those trying to stop his coronation, the entourage convince common Ronald to impersonate the prince at the crowning.  That's just the beginning, as Ronald has to match wits (and swords, eventually) with Raymond Massey and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr while falling in love with Madeleine Carroll along the way before things can be set aright.

This movie doesn't need our 2001 technology to carry it or the unique style of filled with energy and life acting that makes you want to be Douglas Fairbanks Junior sword fencing his way to victory over evil. Superb viewing by anyones definition of family entertainment.  Old style craftmanship and moral chivalry that should never in our modern world be allowed to die.  It depicts what life is all about. Love, honour, duty, personal and social moral respect for one another that is sadly lacking in our modern times.

401071,5,6301976215,"'The Prisoner of Zenda' is one of the most fondly-remembered films of the '30s, and for good reason! It offers Ronald Colman, one of Hollywood's most beloved British stars, in the dual role of Rudolf, crown prince of a small European kingdom, and Rudolf Rassendyll, his look-alike British cousin, end product of a brief affair of an ancestor (as the Englishman puts it, ""Fishing in forbidden waters!""); the radiant Madeleine Carroll, best-known as Robert Donat's leading lady in Hitchcock's classic 'The 39 Steps', as the royal betrothed, who falls in love with the pretender; Raymond Massey, Canadian star of H.G. Wells' SF masterpiece, 'Things to Come' (and, 3 years later, the quintessential Abraham Lincoln on stage and in film!), as Black Michael, Rudolf's scheming half-brother; and, best of all, a youthful Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., son of silent Hollywood's greatest swashbuckler (and a pretty fair swashbuckler, himself!), as the suavely villainous ally of Michael.
The story is simple, and has been done many times before, but never with such elan; drugged monarch-to-be must be impersonated by look-alike for coronation, lest kingdom fall into hands of evil half-brother. In the hands of this PERFECT cast (with terrific support by C. Aubrey Smith, a young David Niven, and Mary Astor) the tale becomes a stylish tale of love, intrigue, and derring-do! High points include an astonishingly beautiful Royal Ball, where Colman and Carroll reveal their love; a very funny yet menacing meeting between Colman and Fairbanks, as they discuss the real King's potential fate; and best of all, a MAGNIFICENT climactic swordfight between the pair, as they lunge and parry furiously through the halls of a castle, while exchanging quips and one-liners!
  This is swashbuckling at it's finest, and is a MUST for any adventure fan's collection! If you are unfamiliar with Ronald Colman's work, you're in for a treat! Don't miss it!",974160000,24,1927,5.212903225806452

Directed by John Cromwell

Ronald Colman stars in David O. Selznick's classic production of Anthony Hope's swashbuckling adventure. The film takes place in a mythical Central European kingdom with Colman in a dual role as King Rudolf V and Rudolph Rassendyl, a visitor from England who's a distant cousin to the prince. Arriving in the city of Strelsau, the inhabitants are startled by Rudolph's resemblance to the prince. Spotted by two of the prince's aides, Captain Fritz von Tarlenheim (David Niven) and Colonel Zapt (C. Aubrey Smith), the Englishman is taken to meet the prince at his hunting lodge.

The two lookalikes have dinner together as the prince tells Rudolph of the preparations for his upcoming coronation as king. The next morning, Zapt wakes Rudolph and informs him the prince had been drugged the night before and is now in a coma. Because of their similar appearance, Zapt prevails upon Rudolph to impersonate the prince at the coronation, otherwise the prince's evil brother Black Michael (Raymond Massey) will be crowned in his place. With the assistant of Zapt and von Tarlenheim, Rudolph bluffs his way through the coronation, successfully fooling Michael, who is shocked to see his brother alive.

Crowned king, Rudolph then meets Princess Flavia (Madeleine Carroll), the prince's fiancee. As they proceed to the reception, Princess Flavia is amazed how kindly the prince is now treating her. Rudolph is falling in love with her, but Michael suspects something foul and dispatches Rupert of Hentzau (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.) to investigate the matter further, preparing to gain control of the throne at any cost.

Madeleine Carroll is heart-breakingly beautiful as Princess Flavia and Douglas Fairbanks, jr. almost steals the show as the rascal/villain Rupert of Hentzau.
