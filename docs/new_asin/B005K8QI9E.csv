4715629,2,B005K8QI9E,"I got this video because is was listed as among the more popular.  Well her celebrity makes her popular to a lot of Biggest Loser fans.  Yes, this is a very hard and intensive workout that will get you a toned body.  I do not think all of the exercises are adequate but they were add to counter the harder ones.  The problem I have with this video is that it is so-o commercial that she will even hawk electric toothbrushes as part of your ""health regiment.""  I am finding that the greatest annoyance of all is her nonstop patter.  A lot of videos have the star trainer demonstrate along with their crew members, Jillian will make any excuse to stop and point out what you should be doing so that she wouldn't have to do it herself and then she will laugh about the fact that she didn't have to do it!  Luckily, they do offer a no-talk version with music only, of course you have to stare at the screen the whole time.",1322352000,6,918,4.211428571428572

4715647,5,B005K8QI9E,"This workout really works. Take my word. After two workouts, you can see the flab whittle away. It is also a FUN workout. Jillian and her crew really make it casual and low key. There is so much variety it is never monotonous. This workout is perfect for my body type - I was an athlete all my life and now just want to keep in shape. The weights I use are 8lbs for the exercises where I can bump it up, and 3lbs for some of the moves that require more agility. The best part of this workout is you get leaner, stronger and feel like you actually get a complete workout - in the comfort of your own home and on your own time schedule. I do not feel like I am bulking up on this workout! I feel like I am leaning out and getting definition. I urge everyone to try this out and see for themselves.",1499558400,,795,3.975

4715660,5,B005K8QI9E,"I own a number of Jillian Michaels DVDs, and this one is my favorite simply because it's the most fun. All of her DVDs work you hard, but this one has more flavor than some of the other ones. Jillian combined a number of different forms of exercise here so you get way beyond the typical lunges, squats, and planks on so many DVDs. There are two routines here: the first one is challenging, but doable, the second one is a killer - but you feel great when you're done. She ends with a long, very calming cool down segment that I particularly enjoy.",1496448000,5,548,4.278846153846154
4715661,5,B005K8QI9E,"I have about 8 of Jillian's workout DVDs and I have been doing her workouts for several years.  THIS is one of my very favorites- it is the most fun workout that I have done yet.  She calls it a fusion style workout and what that translates to is doing a lot more flowing, cool exercises and not being so married to a particular routine of strength- abs - cardio like the Shred and some other routines.  This is just a nice change up where you can learn some new exercises and flow through a routine without counting down the minutes till it is over.  Individually each workout is hard- Level 2 is much harder than Level 1.  They are closer to 45 minutes each.  One day I did both levels and clocked in right at around 1hr 15 minutes and I really thought I might pass out or throw up afterwards.  It'll be awhile before I try that again.  If you like Jillian but get a little bored of the same old circuit training you should definitely try this one!",1492560000,2,950,4.209944751381215

4715666,2,B005K8QI9E,"This is not my favorite Jillian workout because I think the adapted yoga poses are a bit of an odd inclusion. I have a bad wrist and those are particularly challenging for me and there are a lot of them. I do like the feature that allows you to play two workouts in a row, I wish this was on all of her discs because her workouts are a little shorter than what I like to do and I usually do two workouts in a row. For all those things I would give 4 stars but I give it 2 because there is no meal plan to access that I can find. The front of the cover indicates there is, she says there is in the video, but the only meal plan I see on her website is a paid subscription. They obviously changed the website after they made the video, they need to go back and update the marketing for the video because it is not accurate. This isn't the only disc of hers that supposedly comes with a meal plan (30 Day Shred also touts a meal plan for example).",1488844800,,944,3.921875

I got this to add some variety, and I definitely enjoy it. I wasn't expecting the new circuit format that she presents in this one, and find going through 45 minutes of it in this way is much more tolerable than her other longer DVDs. I get bored easily, and doing both halves all at once seems to break it up and make it seem like it's going by a lot faster.
I'm in pretty good shape, too, and the following day (after just doing Workout Level 1), I was a little sore. My boyfriend--who hikes and lifts weights--can't even finish it haha! Anyway...definitely glad I could add this to my collection.",1484697600,,780,4.461538461538462

4715679,2,B005K8QI9E,"I own most of Jillian Michaels' DVDs, but this has got to be the most abstract workout she's put out besides Yoga Inferno. There is a DJ present, don't ask why, and the camera spends more time on him than it does on the ladies doing the exercises. Most of the exercises are ones that have been recycled from her other workouts, but others are just plain weird. Not one of my favorites, by far.

4715681,4,B005K8QI9E,"I am a big fan of Jillian Michaels and the original ""Ripped in 30"" shredding DVD.  I have been doing that workout for quite some time, and it is an efficient and excellent one.  That workout, if you're wondering, is about 30 minutes including the warm-up and stretching parts.  This one is more like 45 minutes, even without the stretching cool-down portion.  This one is also a great workout, and Jillian is tough, funny and encouraging as usual.  I gave it four stars because it's just not practical to do this long of a workout.  I have three kids, and I am always late for something.  I do this workout every once in a while, but I find myself going back to the ""Ripped in 30"" more and more often.  If you have more time to devote to working out, then I would highly recommend this DVD.",1476576000,,790,4.326530612244898

4715686,5,B005K8QI9E,I purchased this dvd almost a year ago and finally tried it tonight. This is a great workout.

4715701,5,B005K8QI9E,"I've been ""dating"" Jillian for 6 years, doing the majority of her DVDs. This one got me good!! Dripping sweat in places I didn't think possible!! I consider myself intermediate/advanced fitness level (to get an idea of my body composition I'm 5'7"" 130 lbs 20.4% body fat). I used 7 lb weights and 5 lb for the hard moves (i.e. superman angels). Level one I smoked through fairly fast, meaning I stayed on it for 2 weeks then moved to level 2. Level 2 made my heart want to explode and my legs want to get chopped off. I love her motivation throughout. People kept commenting on video quality, I didn't notice anything being wrong with it. They also mentioned the DJ. He bothered me at first, only because I like seeing the girls do the moves the entire time when I'm getting down form. However, once I got the form down after the first day, I didn't noticed the DJ. All in all, I love this DVD. Jillian, you never cease to amaze me, thank you!!",1466553600,7,944,4.338983050847458

4715705,5,B005K8QI9E,"Jillian is the best DVD instructor to work with. I have been following her dvds for years. And in fact, the last 2 months have tried other workouts from other instructional dvds, pinterest, bodybuilding.com etc. , and lo and behold I started gaining inches; not hot. So I am back to Jillian. Although this is not my favourite Jilian DVD it is certainly in my rotation. You cannot go wrong with Jillian. She has an easy modify and more advanced modified in almost every DVD and if not then she verbally tells you what the modifier is. I cannot say enough about this truly amazing instructor.",1464134400,4,590,4.5754716981132075
4715706,5,B005K8QI9E,LOVE this video. Jillian Michaels did it again. I love her work out videos because they really push me to go out of my comfort zone or try something I didn't  think I could do. 50 minutes but you really feel like you worked out at the end. Make sure you are stretching afterwards.,1462838400,,280,4.185185185185185
4715707,5,B005K8QI9E,"I have used most of Jillians videos.  This is by far my favorite.  It is not as intense as the highest level of the insanity workouts which bothered my back but it is more intense than many of her other workouts.  When I am finished with the 50 minute level 2 workout I am drenched in sweat and do not feel the need to do any further cardio workout as I have in the past with her 30 minute workouts.  It is the right amount of plyometrics and weight combo for a complete and true circuit training workout.  I am also a physical therapist and feel it is quite balanced other than the need to supplement with a few upper back and RTC exercises: reverse fly, roman chair back extensions, external rotation to balance out all of the push up and ab exercises.",1462665600,,754,4.244755244755245

4715709,4,B005K8QI9E,I have only done level 1 of this workout a couple of times. Wow it is different and will make you sweat. I love how she works multiple muscles at the same time. Love all her workouts,1461888000,,182,3.945945945945946
4715710,3,B005K8QI9E,"Didn't care for this at all.  I personally like the 3, 2, 1 and dislike a single long circuit that is repeated. I got it because of the great reviews and wanted a longer workout than just 30 minutes. Plus it was 5$.  I could get over the long circuit but the exercises were pretty lame. I like combo moves (NMTZ shoulder press and squat etc) but when you put too many moves together and only do it for 30sec there is no way you can get a burn or real workout even with heavy weights (well maybe if you used 20's). I will only use this as a recovery or light day workout. Maybe a good place to start out if never exercised. I haven't done level 2 yet perhaps it is better - if so than I will update. For the record I love JM videos and use a number regularly.
My Favorites
1. Ripped in 30 - truthfully the only one you need to get in shape
2. NMTZ
3. BFBM
4. Yoga inferno - no it's not super hard but nice to have dynamic stretching and it is fun
5. Killer legs
6. 6w6p - used to be my least favorite but hard body now takes that place

I recommend trying Jillian Michael's No More Trouble Zones, or Banish Fat and Boost Metabolism workouts.",1460592000,,324,4.158730158730159
4715712,5,B005K8QI9E,"As someone who considers herself a bit of a Jillian junkie, I know she's a little nuts, and that is exactly why I love her. I've been through no less than a dozen of Jillian's other work out videos and I do one of her routines 5-6 times per week, so I'm very used to the Jillian way. I saw a good price on this one and thought I might as well give it a shot, mix things up (even though the cover pic is a little creepy to me - like, why you look at me like that Jillian?)

Here were my immediate thoughts after completing level one for the first time: ""HOLY ****, JILLIAN! WTH WAS THAT?""

This is like all of her typical combo move circuits ON CRACK. I walked around cursing her name for no less than an hour afterwards. Which of course means that I loved it and can't wait to do it again, because us Jillian diehards are also a little nuts. I'm scared of level 2. Can't even bring myself to preview it yet. Gotta master level one first.

The DJ in this was awesome, really cranked it up when you got to the second round (this is 6 circuits, but instead of doing each circuit twice and then moving on, like in most of her other videos, in this one you go through each circuit once and then back through them all again - like she does in six week six pack - like two long circuits). The helpers she has in the video are fun to watch and I enjoyed her interactions with them.

If you are a Jillian beginner - THIS IS NOT FOR YOU. It moves very fast, the moves are sometimes several steps long, and if you are not familiar with Jillian's moves and style, by the time you figure out what a bridge-press-fly-banger is, the interval is over and she's moved on. this workout will just be frustrating for you. Go to youtube, check out some of her workout videos on there first, and come back to this one when you are used to Jillian.

This one was exciting and sort of exercised my brain as much as my body. I was actually pretty excited to see these wild things I could do, that I wouldn't have guess I was able to. Somehow, Jillian yelling at me always convinces me that I am wonder woman.",1460419200,6,2083,4.095588235294118

If you're not a professional athlete or already used to her style, it's possible you might really hate this DVD. I work out with her videos four times a week, and bought this for a switch up... and I couldn't keep up with the ""easy"" workout, LOL. This one has a lot of combo moves - I'm used to seeing most from her, but not in the same motion, so it was confusing at times.

In order to do the full workout you have to follow her through a cool down and then the exact same warm up all over again to reach the maximum time.

4715751,5,B005K8QI9E,"I consider myself to be in great shape from distance running and crossfit, but doing the level 1 and 2 of this workout dvd straight through really tired me out and gave me a great new challenge, different from what I get in crossfit gym.  The way she combines the moves really elevated my heart rate to the point that when I did make it to the last 2 circuits in level 2 I felt like I was totally wiped out and just barely hanging on.  I like the challenge of the balance moves like warrior two pose to warrior three, and the single leg squat to plank, because balance is a big weakness of mine and even though I'm not great at these moves, I know I will improve with this dvd.  I found some of the new moves I've never done before like the hip hists into a push up really got my heart rate cranking, and the bridge into wheel required great flexibility.  For me the hardest part of this workout was actually holding some of the static poses.  In the final circuit of level 2 when you have to hold the triangle poses and this is supposed to be considered a rest to get your heart rate down, mine shoots way up!  Holding these poses is painful!  I feel this dvd is a great challenge to those who are new to working out, but still challenges those who are experienced.  Just completing some of the moves is challenging enough, but then adding resistance or a jump to make them advanced makes them even tougher!  I own several of Jillian's dvds and in my opinion this is her most challenging one yet!",1448236800,10,1497,4.224561403508772

4715793,4,B005K8QI9E,"This is a solid workout video from Jillian - not my favorite but certainly in my opinion worth having in your library.

Starting off - I've done many of her videos, including 30-day Shred, Ripped in 30, No more trouble zones, Banish fat, boost metabolism, Yoga Meltdown, Body Revolution, Hard Body, and Shred it with weights.  Ultimately, after doing most of these videos, while I love all of them, I will admit that I've been starting to feel like many contain basically the same moves, just mixed up and maybe with small variations.  Ultimately, everything seems a bit of a letdown since Body Revolution, which I absolutely LOVE.

I have multiple reasons for liking this workout:
1) You can do each workout individually.  As many reviewers have stated, there is some discrepancy regarding the length of the videos - the first is 41 minutes, the second is 52 minutes, each of those including the warm-up and cool-down.  This is slightly longer than most of her other ""30-minute"" videos which all range in length from 27 minutes to 35 minutes, including warm-up and cool down.
2) You can combine the two workouts.  I found that individually, they were challenging but not overwhelming.  Together, they made for a really intense workout that I had difficulty getting through, even though I'm in excellent shape.
3) For those of us that are getting a bit bored with some of the same moves present in the other videos, this one contains interesting and challenging variations.  If you have done her videos (especially Body revolution) you will have seen many of these moves, just not all in one video.
4) It is a challenge.  I was finding that after finishing the higher levels of all of the other videos, that nothing was truly challenging anymore.  I'm sure someday I'll feel that way about this one.  But I sweated bullets, kept my heartrate up, and burned a LOT of calories.  I didn't use the lightest weights for anything, but I still feel that I could push myself with this video for quite awhile.

What I didn't like:
I have to be honest that I can't come up with a whole lot.  It's just a general, vague feeling that I don't like this workout as much as others I've done.  I just adore body revolution, and I kind of feel it's going to be difficult to measure up to.

In response to some of the negative reviews I saw:
1) ""This is too easy"" - this workout like any others is what you make of it.  Doing the entire workout, my heart rate stayed at 150 - 160 the entire time and I burned over 800 calories.  And that's a non-overweight person who works out 5-6 days per week.  I'm sorry, but I do believe that if you found it that easy you probably weren't doing the moves fully or with enough weight.
2) ""You could get injured"" - Yes, you could get injured walking down the street or doing any new exercise video.  This isn't the fault of the video.  You do need to know your limits and pay attention to your body.  There is a beginner variation for everything - use it the first time if you have any chronic problems or are unsure.
3) ""This isn't two 45 minute workouts"" - Actually, it is.  Really, do you expect them to label the package ""One 41 minute and one 52 minute workout?""  Some are upset they're not shorter, some are upset they're not longer.  You can combine the two for a longer workout.
4) ""Moves are confusing/complicated/don't flow"" - I can understand this argument from anyone who hasn't done Jillian's workouts before.  She is clearly trying to give people something different.  Truly I don't think that these moves are out of reach if you try them a few times.  But if you haven't done her videos before, I definitely would not recommend starting with this one.  30-day shred or ripped in 30 (or body revolution) are probably better in that regard.",1435795200,13,3772,4.545185185185185
4715794,4,B005K8QI9E,"I like this workout a lot. It blends different workout styles and moves, such as weight training, cardio, kick boxing, and yoga.

I recommend this DVD.",1435190400,8,302,4.716981132075472
4715795,4,B005K8QI9E,"The workout levels are a plus. I feel good sore and tired after one of these workouts, as I usually love to break out a heavy sweat every time I exercise. One of things I don't like about this workout is that some of the exercise moves take a long time to get used to (balanza and a couple other world martial arts move). It seems that Jillian was trying very hard to add yoga moves into these workouts as well. I don't have a problem with yoga; the yoga movements in these workouts just don't challenge me and, aside from a nice breather in-between, really doesn't do much.",1434067200,,574,4.275229357798165

4715828,2,B005K8QI9E,"I have several Jillian Michaels workouts and generally find them effective and challenging. Her workouts generally have a good mix of cardio and strength training. This is not one of them. In fact, I wish I could return it. Here are my problems with ""Extreme Shed and Shred:""

1. Very little cardio. Unless it's a yoga workout, I would think workouts with the name ""Extreme Shed and Shred"" would have a good dose of cardio for the ""shed"" part. Not to say there weren't some really challenging moves, but I was disappointed. According to my fitness tracker, for workout one my average bpm was 117, total calories burned was 239 for a 40 minute workout and I was only in the cardio zone for 13 of 40 minutes. I will say that I spent 25 minutes in the ""fat burning zone,"" so there's that. Level 2 workout was 52 minutes. Average bpm for that one was 110, with a 252 calorie burn over the 52 minute workout, with eight minutes in the cardio HR zone and 39 minutes in the fat burning HR zone. Compare that to the cardio portion of Jillian's One Week Shred (which I did last week) where I was burning about 300 calories a day for that thirty minute workout - MUCH more satisfying! The One Week Shred strength workout was also thirty minutes and burned about 163... but I KNEW going in that it was focused on strength training and not calorie burn. With Extreme Shed and Shred, I found it odd that I actually burned MORE calories on the shorter level one workout! That's just one confusing aspect of this video... but at the end of the day I was disappointed, barely broke a sweat from either workout. The ""One Week Shred"" I did with Jillian last week was much more satisfying, as are the 30-Day Shred and various other Jillian workouts that incorporate cardio with strength.

2. There's some confusion about the workout times. The cover of the DVD says there are two 45-minute workouts. On the intro, Jillian says there are two 30-minute workouts. Neither of these is correct. Level 1 workout is 41 minutes. Level 2 workout is 52 minutes. I think Jillian is not including the warm up and cool downs when she mentioned the two thirty minute workouts... but if I'm trying to plan my day accurately this is annoying. They encourage you to do the two workouts together - which Jillian says takes an hour. But in reality, when you opt to play Level 1 and Level 2 together, it takes 80 minutes, not 60. I work out first thing in the morning, and a twenty minute delay where I live can mean an extra hour of commuting if you're not careful, so I rely on knowing ahead of time how long my workouts will be so I can start my day accordingly.

3. I don't see what's so ""extreme"" about this video, and as I mentioned in complaint #1, there's not enough cardio to justify a ""shed."" This seems to me like a toning/strength-training workout. Let's call things what they are, shall we?

Since there's no returning a DVD that's already opened, this one will be gathering dust on the shelf...",1424822400,,2969,4.452205882352941
4715829,4,B005K8QI9E,"My all time favorite of Jillian's workouts is Ripped in 30. It's hard not to always compare her other videos to Ripped. That being said, this a good workout but I find some of the moves that she ""created"" to be awkward & lack fluidity. I loved being able to chose from 4 completely different workouts in Ripped, where in this DVD Jillian just combines workouts 1 & 2 for an advanced workout.  I alternate between this DVD, her new Yoga Inferno & Fitness Blender for variety. I don't regret this purchase but it's not my favorite from Jillian.",1424822400,2,542,4.474747474747475

I like this workout because it offers diversity. It consists of tons of exercises that are only repeated one time! And it gives you a 45 minute workout. It REALLY gets you sweating. Occasionally I will have to modify the exercise or march in place, as one of the girls does in the video, but my Polar HRM tells me this workout is really burning the calories.

This workout has helped out my upper body strength in addition to offering a great cardio workout.

This video has it all- w/ exception for alot of weight training; however, the body is one of the most efficient weight training modules there are.  If you are advanced, you should add this one to your collection.",1422662400,,545,4.454545454545454
4715839,5,B005K8QI9E,Love doing this 60 minute version of the DVD.  It is really about and hour and 15- but ce la ve!  More time to workout is always a bonus.  LOVE THIS VIDEO.... AWESOME. Jillian is always a fantastic instructor.  She switches it up on this one for the better.  I have all of her DVD's.  This is one of my favorites.,1422662400,6,313,4.049180327868853
4715840,4,B005K8QI9E,"I am 47 years old and have been actively working out since my early twenties.  Hard Body 2 is another great workout DVD by Jillian Michaels!  The workouts are fast paced which makes the time pass quickly without feeling as if you worked out 45 and 50 minutes.  The DJ did not even phase me in the least.  I was too focused on the workout.  The only reason I am giving this DVD  4 stars rather than 5 stars is because I like Ripped in 30 much better. Ripped in 30 offers 4 leveled workouts that are only 30 minutes long (including warm-up and cool down.) Honestly, my body changed in a positive way after Ripped in 30.  My abs, arms and shoulders became defined. I like the flow of Ripped in 30 better as well as the amount of time it takes.  With that being said...I will continue to use both DVDS 5 to 6days a week  and switch it up dependeing how much time I have to workout.  Always feel better after Jillian Michaels workouts!  (PS-  I complted the Insanity workous and was not impressed at all...sweat like crazy but Ripped in 30 provided same results in less time!)",1422230400,,1071,4.27363184079602

4715842,5,B005K8QI9E,"LOVE this workout...here is why, it is longer, but the moves are a little less challenging, making it easier to sustain the longer workout!  Some days 30 mins are all I have, those days I do the Shred or Killer Abs etc.  But some days I feel like working out longer, and this meets that criteria.

Ignore the DJ and background, kind of silly...pay attention to the moves, if you do them, you will get a great workout.  I feel like this is a decent DVD with a mix of traditional moves and also newer version or fusion moves.  Which, something new to challenge me?  Even better!

You also can't beat the price on her DVD's!  Especially since most you get more than one workout!  If you're looking for a great over-all body workout, I think this DVD will meet your expectations.",1421712000,,775,4.401408450704225

4715845,5,B005K8QI9E,"Background about me: I was very athletic then got sedimentary and gained the freshman 15 in college. So I got this on my winter break. I never did videos before except Fitness Blender on youtube at times.

After day 1: I did the first workout only, after half a year of not exercising except walking my dogs, and was sweating but I could get through it and even do most of the advanced moves albeit struggling! At the end I didn't feel such a deep burn in my lower body. My shoulders and triceps were sore though and still sore when I did the jumping jacks in the warm up the next day.

After day 2: I did the 2nd video, did I say I wanted more for my lower body the day before? I got it. Workout 2 kicks butt - no pun intended! It works out your stomach good also.

Day 3 I tried combining 1 and 2, but 2 starts you off hard so I only did bits through 2. My knees started hurting after day 3. There are a lot of lunges and squats in the 2nd video. I still didn't understand how to do one of the moves where you kind of flip your whole body over while in a table position and keep flipping.

Day 4: My leg muscles and knees were still too sore to do the 2nd workout, but I really don't think the 1st is enough for total body, so I went back to Fitness Blender.

Skipping a few days...in which I did either workout 1 or 2 only, alternately...

It's been a total of 2 weeks. I've lost 5 lbs but I didn't drastically reduce or watch my diet and I definitely look better than just 5 lbs in 14 days.

Overall, my body is getting used to workout 2 better, but my knees still get a little sore, I have to really watch my form on the lunges because it's the inside of each knee that hurts.

I want to get some of her other vids so this doesn't get boring but for now I have Fitness Blender too. I think it is tough, especially to combine both, but far from impossible.",1421020800,2,1860,3.967828418230563

I am in the best shape of my life because of them.  This DVD is not on the same level as her others. Even though there are ""2 Levels,"" you don't get two different warm-ups and cool-downs. It's the same, and the video cuts to whichever level you're doing.  Not that this is a huge deal, but it does make it more boring.  This workout doesn't have enough intense cardio (heart rate doesn't get up very high), and some of the moves are just plain weird. After hurting my knee twice after doing this workout (which has never happened in any other workout I have done), I will no longer even try this video.

4715864,3,B005K8QI9E,"I own a lot of DVDs by Jiliian & I like most of them but this one was ok. Some of the exercises have been combined to give a new look to common exercises which make them confusing and sometimes senseless. I also don't like the fact that you finish all circuits together and repeat them at the end. For most exercises I couldn't remember which side I had already done. If you do same circuit back to back as in Jillian's NMTZ, then you can balance your workout easily. Also I agree with other reviewers that they show DJ a lot. At times when Jillian is explaining exercises or you are doing exercise you actually want to see how to do the exercise and not the DJ. He's shown quite frequently for more than couple seconds. It's just a stupid idea to have him there in the first place and on top of that showing him when you actually want to see the exercise is just absurd. I do however liked Jillian's attitude in this DVD. She's not yelling, not cursing and not complaining about her Twitter and Facebook comments. I will keep the DVD and use it once in a while, but it's not among my Jillian's favorite ones.",1419206400,,1109,4.260663507109005

4715887,2,B005K8QI9E,"I'm sadly disappointed in this DVD and wish I would have read the negative reviews before purchasing it. First off, how is it advertised as ""two 45-minute workouts"" when NEITHER workout is even close to 45 minutes long? I wanted longer workouts because I've worked my way up to picking two sessions from Jillian's 30 Day Shred, Yoga Meltdown, Killer Buns, or Ripped in 30 (which are all fabulous DVDs).

Workout one, I felt was an odd combination of moves that didn't really seem to do anything for me, mixed in with some good stuff. But the odd moves left me feeling bored. For example; there's one move where you're in a squat and waving your arms back and forth slowly in front of your face, apparently some Brazilian martial arts thing. And another one where you just step back, swing one arm up to block your face, and swing your other arm behind you. It's not even as challenging as Jillian's typical warm-up moves like jumping jacks or high kicks. Jillian doesn't explain the format on the moves like she usually does, but this didn't bother me because I was able to follow along after a few reps.

The second workout, I actually took issue with a few of the moves because I don't think that the average person without gymnastics training could actually complete them without hurting themselves in the process of learning them. I've done the advanced versions of the other Jillian DVDs I have, and sometimes it takes me a few weeks to work up to the advanced version, especially on the yoga poses. But here's a move I would never attempt: Basheera was in a pose with her feet flat on the floor, hands flat on the floor with fingertips pointing towards her feet, and whole body arched in an upside down ""u"" shape with belly pointing towards the sky. How on earth does a person even try that? And if you don't have the strength for it or your hands slip, you'll crash down onto your head, which seems extremely risky! However, as in workout one, there were a couple good redeeming moves, such as the Russian twist, which I'll incorporate into my workout routine.

I won't return this DVD, but I'm not planning to work out to it like I do the other Jillian DVDs, except to get a couple good moves from it.",1411776000,,2209,4.503740648379052

4715892,4,B005K8QI9E,"I own most of JM's dvds and this one is good, but not my favorite. She has you complete 2 rounds of 7 circuits. Even though the workout is 45 minutes, since you're in constant movement, it goes by fast. Most moves are similar to ones in her other dvds (surrenders, burpees, etc) but she chains these familiar moves together, making it overwhelming to keep up at first. I highly suggest using a lighter weight and taking it slow the first time you do the dvd so you can familiarize yourself with the exercises. Keep your core tight and go at your own pace so you don't injure yourself.

As for the DJ: I didn't have a problem with the DJ cuts and actually thought it was a nice addition. I only wish they picked someone more motivational.

This one is 20 minutes longer, including the cool down, and definitely a good workout.  You can modify to make it easier or harder (I like to do high knees or jumping jacks between sets to really keep my heart rate up) and I don't mind the format (do the whole workout then repeat once). All in all, if you're looking for a pretty difficult workout that, in my opinion, is a step up from her other shorter workouts, this is a great option!

HOWEVER..... the reason I took a star away, like some other reviewers have mentioned, the production is pretty strange.  The quick shots of a DJ ""mixing music"" - he's probably actually doing nothing - is pretty bizarre and I found that it was breaking my focus while working out.  The weird cuts to the DJ and camera movements took my attention off of Jillian and what she was saying.  I think the producers were just trying too hard to be different and do something to pump you up, but it just doesn't work (for me at least).

Note to the director and producer: Jillian yelling and coaching is all I need to be motivated, don't take the focus away from my favorite trainer!!",1406073600,3,1253,4.370689655172414

4715915,4,B005K8QI9E,"First off I will say I'm a big fan of Jillian. I have several of her DVDs. She has a no nonsense and not boring or giggly personality that I really like. Hard Body is a DVD that I put off buying for a long time because of the disco appearance on the cover. Do not let that fool you! It has two great workouts with new moves not in her other DVDs. I was looking to step it up a notch because these workouts are 45 minutes each and my wish was granted! There's still a move, one arm mountain climbers, that I can not do. This is a total body workout that you repeat twice, and she has several ladies this time that show you beginner, intermediate, and advanced moves. The DJ shots are a little weird at first, but don't bother me anymore. The ad for the armband is within the actual workout so they don't stop the workout just to do a commercial. It's not that noticeable. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because I think it focuses a little more on arms, chest, and abs and would have liked to see a few more leg and butt moves. However, I also just got done completing Killer Buns and Thighs so maybe I'm not noticing the legs and buns on this DVD because that DVD is definitely 5 stars! I would also like her to point out or do a flash screen of weight size reccommendadtions for the different levels. Other than that, great workout, great price, fast shipping, and my shoulders and arms are looking awesome. Get ready to sweat!",1405468800,3,1444,4.160714285714286

4715918,2,B005K8QI9E,"I am a huge fan of Jillian's DVDs. I own about 6. I give this one 2 stars because of the flow of the moves and Jillian is just trying to do too much. As with her other recently released DVDs, she has to keep things new and different. A lot of people mention the DJ, but that is the least of your worries. I don't think ""beginners"" will like this DVD because the moves are just too complicated. It is not that the moves are too difficult for anyone, but the actual mechanics are off. I work out consistently and did not find this gave me the workout that I wanted. I recommend 'Banish Fat Boost Metabolism' to anyone looking for cardio and muscle strengthening workouts. The moves are classic but leave you drenched in sweat. This one was not a win for me, and I regret the purchase.",1404864000,4,782,4.22
4715919,4,B005K8QI9E,"Never thought I'd give Jillian less than 5 stars, but I honestly didn't like level 1 of this DVD (although I really really wanted to like it).  Level 1 just didn't flow nicely for me; too many complicated combinations (and no I'm not a beginner in fitness).  For example, traveling push-ups into standing lateral jumps?  It was too confusing for me, and I was disappointed. Which sucks because I am a die hard Jillian fan; I see Jillian as my life coach, not just my fitness instructor (I love her pep talks).  Even though I didn't like this workout, I do appreciate Jillian's attempt for creativity.

So, why am I still giving this DVD a 4 star? Because level 2 ROCKS!!!!  I was a bit fearful of trying level 2, but I did it today and it was amazing!  A total kick butt workout! I had to use the modifications for a lot of the moves, but I was still dripping in sweat afterwards!  Level 2 is completely different from level 1, it had a waaaay better flow.  I do not regret buying this DVD at all because level 2 is totally worth it!

I think I will do the Extreme Shed & Shred DVD for a couple weeks before adding level two to my regular routine though, because it was pretty intense.

Oh, and the DJ?  He didn't bother me at all.  I didn't find him distracting; kinda entertaining actually (but that's just me).",1404691200,2,1313,4.310204081632653

I personally love the fusion style workout; I have a friend who is paying tons of money at a gym for fusion style aerobics classes.  I guess fusion style is hot right now! I did break a sweat doing level 1, but I wasn't winded or anything.

This morning I tried level 2 and OMG I almost had to hit the pause button a few times!  It was a very fun, intense, whole body workout!  I completed the workout 6-7 hours ago, and the soreness is totally kicking in now (and I workout 5 to 6 x a week using other JM DVDs).

I am so glad I didn't do levels 1 and 2 together this morning, otherwise I think I'll be calling into work tomorrow!  Someday I will be brave enough to do 1 and 2 together. Someday.",1404000000,6,747,3.94

Like the 45 minute format and the I usually blend the beginner and advanced versions across the exercises to push myself to get better. All beginner moves will be too easy if you are used to Jillian. All advanced moves is very tough. I do both the workouts and alternate them with others. Good cardio and good strength. Definitely feels like it has helped me improve since I have been doing them.,1403913600,,461,4.435294117647059

She uses a combination of cardio, strength, yoga and weights so you get a pretty thorough workout.

Workout 1 is by no means easy, but I was able to complete the entire thing the first time through.  Workout 2 is tough!  I have been working out for a few years.  I've done boxing, boot camps, I run regularly and I still was not able to get through workout 2 the first time I did it.  I hit 30 minutes and called it a day.

This isn't a bad thing - just shows how hard core Jillian is.  I plan to buy more of her DVDs to mix things up.",1401926400,2,540,3.767857142857143
4715928,3,B005K8QI9E,"This is the second time I have completed this workout.  I did the more advanced version and while it was somewhat challenging, it's not a favorite of mine. First, I found some of her moves a little ridiculous and potentially harmful and I was asking myself ""Why?"" as I'm doing them.  Why do I need to rotate in a side plank? What's the purpose? Why not just lower and raise your upper body to work your side obliques? Why do I need to do a crow and a grasshopper pushup? Why not one or the other? Just because there are more moves doesn't make the exercise better. Why a one armed mountain climber? She even tells you that if you mess up your synchronization, you could fall.  I want to concentrate on getting a good workout and not worry about toppling over. Why do you need to pass a weight while in a superman? You can clearly feel the strain in your lower back.  The one I hate the most..why a one legged squat and then  lean forward to try to touch my head to the floor?  I notice that a knee can become compromised when I shift forward. Like everyone else, why the DJ?  I don't want to stop without saying something positive because there were some things I liked, but they were the more traditional strength training (one arm row in a lung, or sumo with plyo and row) and the cardio moves.  I know Jillian has the reputation of being a tough instructor, but in my opinion no one beats Michelle Dozois for a great, challenging workout.",1401926400,3,1441,4.311111111111111
4715929,5,B005K8QI9E,"I like Jillian's workouts and was excited to try a new (to me) DVD. I figured I would start with workout 1 and i was expecting it to not be super challenging, but for the first try at a new video I'm fine with an easier workout. I hate to say it, but I was really disappointed with workout one. I decided to be a little late to work and do another workout just to get in a decent calorie burn for the day. Priorities.

Next up workout two. I'm familiar with Jillian, so I was expecting a much more challenging workout with this. Eh. It was just OK. Definitely more difficult that workout one, and a little longer, but still not that great. At this point, I had kind of given up on this DVD. But the whole time she harps on you to try workouts one and two together, so over the holiday weekend, when i had a little more time, I decided to give it one last shot. I took back everything I said about the two individual workouts. Combined this is a tough workout!

The whole deal takes about 1:20. I always do my own cool down and stretch, so the full DVD may be a bit more or less, but give yourself a good 1.5 hours for the whole thing. If you're a beginner, then pace yourself. Maybe just do one of the individual workouts. But if you're in shape, this video is worth the time. I didn't add a lot of the weights where she gives the option. The main reason being is that she didn't mention them until the second circuit a lot of the time, and as I like to alternate which side of the body I work, I didn't want to be uneven. Next time I do the full DVD I'll try to note the sections where she introduces the weights on the second set. Regardless, as a body-weight based strength workout this is great. It's a nice change up from weights and your muscles feel like they're working. Cardio-wise, i burned close to 400 calories for the whole deal, but it's not a super challenging cardio workout. The length of time spent upped the numbers from my usual, but also a lot of the moves got your heart rate up without you really noticing.
I usually skip a lot of her ab moves and do cardio or weight intervals instead. In the name of science, i decided to just follow the whole video. there were not a lot of dedicated ab moves and i didn't feel they were a huge waste of time, so if you hate ab work like me, this video is fairly light on it.

So overall workouts 1 and 2 are not that great on their own, but combined the whole DVD is pretty challenging and a good workout, just make sure to allocate 1.5 hours for it.",1401235200,,2510,4.097560975609756
4715930,5,B005K8QI9E,"I have most of Jillian's DVD's, including Body Revolution.  This is one that come back to over and over again.  It's very difficult for me to do both levels back-to-back.  I usually opt for one or the other.  I'm always very sore the next day, and I love that!  I love every aspect of this DVD. The workout assistants are great and demonstrate great form, Jillian's attitude is fun and motivational without going over the top (i.e. Ripped in 30), and I enjoy the variety.  To some it may seem all over the place, but I don't mind jumping from yoga to kickboxing.  It keeps it interesting for me.  Just a side note:  I met Jillian Michaels at a restaurant one time.  I put my boyfriend on blast and told her that he thought he was too tough for her workouts.  She laughed and suggested I have him try Extreme Shed & Shred.  So if anybody thinks this is tough, like I do, so does Jillian :-)",1400803200,8,889,4.25748502994012

4715937,4,B005K8QI9E,"I don't do all of Jillian's workouts, but usually try them when they come out, because even though her style of exercise isn't what I normally gravitate to (I usually do kickboxing, pilates, dance or yoga) I do find her workouts to be effective.  So, I gave this one a go.  There are two workouts of about 45 minutes in length and level 1 is easier than level 2 supposedly.  I liked level 2 better, but probably because I liked the exercises a bit more.  I like this kind of training where you do the entire circuit, short and sweet and then do it again.  No endless repetitions, just get through and move onto the next exercise.  The workout uses light and heavier weights or no weights at all as is demonstrated by her modifier.  As you come to expect from her workouts they are well cued and the moves are done with good form and instruction.  There is always someone to show the easier or modified version of the exercise.  This is helpful and makes the dvd approachable for all levels.  I would say if you have knee issues, there are plyometric jumps and some moves that you may want to skip or modify.  Overall, I liked this better than most of this type of workout.",1400544000,,1172,4.354838709677419
4715938,5,B005K8QI9E,Excellent workout dvd. Jillian has many variations to help beginners. She also has two different segments. Over one week I have built up to completing both segments!,1400198400,,165,5.148148148148148
4715939,4,B005K8QI9E,"****UPDATE**** Ok so I gave this video another try. Although I still feel iffy about the production of the DVD which btw who cares if your really just looking to workout; I now feel like maybe I was too hard on Jillian for this. I do think this video is effective BUT if your someone like me who is used to DVD systems like TurboFire, than this may be a either too hard or too easy. TurboFire only uses bands and since I hadnt done Ripped in 30 in a while, I was so not used to using weights anymore so that KILLED ME, not to mention I have weak knees and a screwy hip. With all that said try to follow the modifier the best you can or make your own modifications without hurting yourself. Don't care for the quality of the DVD still, and moves are slightly faster than usual but overall its not that bad. If at first you don't succeed, try Jillian again, and again. ;-)

I have to say that I am not a HUGE fan of Jillian Michaels although, I did like Ripped in 30. I owned 30 Day Shred but gave it away fof it not being hardcore enoughbut in regards to this new DVD, I think the words Hardcore should not be the word to describe it, but instead perhaps DANGEROUS. The moves are all over the place and in the first workout's beginning segment, there weren't even any set of repetitions! I have weak knees as does so many so I tried my hardest to keep up with the modifier but that in itself was rather difficult because the camera seemed to stay more focused on the DJ and the advanced exercisers in the video more than anything. Again the choreography was scattered and dangerous so please beware and P.S.

So of the moves were complicated but this was only my 1st time. It also felt like you were doing a real gym class where you just figure it out as you go along plus she has several hot women in the class (as opposed to one advanced and one beginner). I refer to the hotness because I would very much wish to look like that one day!! I'm trying to lose some last baby weight and I certainly think this video will help. And ignore all the negative DJ comments - yes he is ridiculously annoying and it's extremely cheesy but just put the video on mute, use your own music & work your butt off!

I don't like the pace, I don't like the ""dance type moves"", I just don't like it much. It is not a horrible workout , you will still get a small sweat but honestly I am used to dripping sweat w/ JM's longer videos, especially when I do 2 levels back to back of ripped in 30. Perhaps it is just a preference thing, and I just don't enjoy this style of workout and I prefer her more traditional kick boxing, plyo, and basic aerobic moves verses these fancier moves.

I glance up quickly to see that I am doing it right, that is about it.
The DJ is there, but not bothersome!!

4715951,4,B005K8QI9E,"This is a classic Jillian workout. And by ""classic"" I mean that it includes moves you've never seen before; as an innovator, that's what she does. So, it pushes you.

I appreciate the format. There are, I think, 6 circuits of three moves each. Jillian coaches you through all 6 circuits, then, you repeat all 6 circuits on the other side. This format keeps it from getting boring. Plus, the sets are not long at all; uncomfortable, yes, but not so lengthy that you feel like a failure if you don't make it all the way through. You can make it all the way through.

Jillian has to have one of the best personalities of all the trainers out there. She's genuine and encouraging, and she made me laugh aloud in this video a couple of times. (i.e. her ""Flashdance"" move...You'll see.)

Finally, there are no annoying camera-hogging hams in this workout, nor in any of Jillian's other workouts. Jillian engages with the other team members, but there is none who is a distracting nuisance. The absence of hams (especially when they don't even have good form) is a prerequisite of mine when it comes to workout videos.

This workout is suitable for anyone serious about getting in shape and having a little fun while they do it. It's even suitable for beginners: there are very reasonable modifications for the exercises. You'll still get a helluva workout with the modifications. Myself, I dove into workout #2 (45 minutes, not including the cool down), and found that it was just my speed. I was even able to push myself quite a bit to try to handle heavier weights.

4715961,5,B005K8QI9E,I haven't even ventured to level 2 yet but level 1 is killer! I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great workout.,1395619200,2,129,4.416666666666667
4715962,3,B005K8QI9E,"I like Jillian's style of doing one move for 30 seconds before moving onto the next.  That way you're concentrating on one move without trying to get complicated choreography down.  This one is like that.

I also like that this workout video was challenging, but with enough modifiers to go easier or harder, and then an option to grab lighter or heavier weights.

At 45 minutes, it's a good length.  Due to my schedule, I prefer something closer to 30 minutes, like 6 week six-pack.

I was moderately sore the next day, so i know it did something.

There were a few moves that I think had too much going on at once.  For example there was one where you squat and curl, then kick one leg back in the air, while bending forward and doing a tricep kickback, and then back again to the squat and curl.  with the constant movement, I couldn't tell if my form was right or not.",1395532800,,872,4.333333333333333
4715963,5,B005K8QI9E,"Jillian Michaels' video is great.  It's 45 minutes and that's just enough time to really work out without feeling like the video will never end.  I feel sore after doing it, not to the point I can't walk, but definitely feel the muscles have been used.  I like her banter on the video with the other ladies too.  The cut away shots to the DJ aren't that big of a deal to me, just make me smile because he looks so involved in spinning music which seems a little out of place given it's a workout video and not a night club.  I think I might try additional videos now since I liked this one so much.",1395532800,2,598,4.076923076923077

I have only done level 1 and a little over half of level 2 and wow! It's fun and it flows so it goes by a lot faster than a lot of other fitness DVDs out there. I highly recommend it.

 I would, however, not recommend this to a beginner....or anyone who had never done a Jillian workout. I have done 30DS, Ri30, Hard Body, and KBAT and for me, it was harder than all the others (but hard body comes pretty close!) that I have previously done.",1395014400,,564,4.072072072072072
4715965,2,B005K8QI9E,"Jillian has taught me so much about how to work out indoors, and with minimal equipment. I love her attitude and push in those first few videos. As with any video, the impact you feel often depends on how hard you hit it. That in mind, I was so disappointed with this video. So much so, that I gave up on all subsequent Jillian videos. Why am I deciding to review this now? I was considering buying her new 'One week shred"" - but I'm so skeptical since this one sits in my drawer and never gets used. After watching the preview videos for it - I'm leaning towards not.
 If you want to hit it hard and feel worked over - this video is NOT for you. If you want a light, easy, very low impact and low heart rate workout - this one is for you. I have no problem with the whole fusion idea, but let's feel like we are pushing a limit. Any limit! Most of us who buy these videos have an hour or less to work out in a day, and need to make it count. I still love Jillian, but I have given up hope. Has she gone soft - gotten too commercial? I'd like to see some of the Six week Sixpack attitude again - until than I'm sticking with Cathe",1394928000,,1130,3.9344978165938866

This one took too much co-ordination and what happens to me when I am concentrating on getting the moves right is that I loose all focus on my form. This is especially important as far as positioning for lunges is concerned. A bad position damages the knees. It was too fast and complicated. As a result I damaged my right knee. It took a while for it to recover. I think I will stick to her other DVDs.

If you work out regularly like I do, you will likely find this to be a nice addition to you routine. You can't beat the price. The work outs are 30 minutes each and not 45.",1394496000,,340,4.074626865671642
4715983,5,B005K8QI9E,"First, my background/fitness level so the reader may be able to judge my review based upon where they are at.  I've been at it for almost a year after a rather sedentary lifestyle due to a health issue.  Health issue is still there but I've made some huge breakthroughs.  So I was overweight and way out of shape.  Now I'm obsessed, a fanatic - workout 6-9 hours per week.  I do kettlebell workouts 3-4 times per week, JM ~2-3 times per week and I'm on the stationary bike about 3-4 hours per week.  But I would describe myself as an advanced beginner trying to bust through to intermediate with about 10  more pounds to lose.

I am a fan of JM's workouts.  30 Day Shred and No More Trouble Zones were probably my favs up to now.  I love JM because she's got this down.  Her rhythm, timing, exercise transitions and strategically timed motivational shout outs are always great.  The production value is always excellent IMO (compared to other workouts/trainers I have or have tried.)  The workouts are well designed - they bust my rear anyway.

This workout continues with the same standards.  I sit here after my first workout with JM's HB (that didn't sound right) and my butt is kicked.  I'm soaked.  To be honest, some of the compound moves are tricky for me and I was at least one rep behind in every set but part of that was because I had to watch and learn for a rep.  For the first time in a very long time, I had to sit out a set (the plank rows with mountain climbers in the second circuit.)  But, I look forward to getting all the moves down and being strong enough to kick workout 1 & workout 2's arse.  And I'll get there.

So in summary, this is probably my new JM favorite.  I project that intermediate to advanced users may have plenty to work with here.  Brand new beginners?  Eh.  Not sure.  This was maybe, maybe too hard for me a year ago.  Try 30 Day Shred first?  Or not, dive in as JM routinely gives modified movements some of which I used today.

Anyway, this almost middle aged guy that really needs to stay motivated and enjoy working out appreciates Jillian's work and I think Hard Body is, for sure, an excellent chapter in an overall quality body of work.",1394323200,11,2185,4.352357320099256
4715984,5,B005K8QI9E,"This workout is tough! I really think the folks who reviewed this otherwise weren't doing it right, or are Olympians. I alternate this. DVD with Jillian's 30 Day Shred. Whew! I am sore somewhere new every day, and I feel strong and wonderful. I have lost a lot of weight and by body is most definitely getting toned.
I also enjoy the longer circuits this video offers, it seems a bit less repetitive. The mix of moves that some reviewers found weird I find fun and interesting. And still doable in baby's nap time! I went from push ups being my nightmare to getting through a whole set (on my knees) to almost being able to do real ones! In a couple of months! If you do this consistently you will get results.

4715985,3,B005K8QI9E,I have a LOT of Jillian Michaels workouts and was excited to try this new one. But I find myself not liking it as much as the others. Most other Jillian Michaels workouts consists of 6-7 circuits but you do all the exercises in one circuit twice through before moving onto the next circuit. In this workout you do ALL the exercises once then go through and start at the beginning again. The problem with that is that I forget which move is coming when and I forget which leg I used the last time (so I can alternate). The DVD is pretty fast paced which is good because you definitely don't get bored but the moves are so bizarre at times that by the time I figure out how to do it she's already on to the next move. The other problem is I don't see the point of the DJ. It distracts from the workout because I need to watch the girls to make sure I'm doing the move right and sometimes the camera cuts to the DJ which is annoying.,1393977600,2,930,4.087431693989071

I bought 3 of them at the same time, and this is my favorite.  At first, I thought it seemed ""easy."" As a fit person used to the beating from Insanity, I wasn't dripping sweat and wanting to die.  After just a week, I felt so much tougher and looked more toned.  I don't know how, but my lower-belly fat has almost disappeared since I started this workout (combined with running and other Jillian workouts, as well as other cardio workouts, but never at the same time.) I work out 4 days a week and eat my heart out.  Somehow, Jillian figured out how I can allow that!

One side note though...you really have to push yourself with these moves..if you don't...the workout will not really feel like anything as she does short bursts of each routine for a long time (6 straight circuits done twice).

I don't mean the moves were extremely difficult, but they are weird and the transitions between moves are not smooth. I would go with Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism if you want a good cardio workout. I only used Extreme Shed & Shred once, and I don't think I'll be using it again. I have been doing Banish Fat and am seeing results. It's a great sweat and I burn around 550 cals.

4716000,5,B005K8QI9E,"I am glad I found this workout. I have several of her other DVD's, and true to fashion, my body has adjusted to them. I have found myself getting bored, so I needed something new to try. Between No More Trouble Zones and this one, they are the top two hardest DVD's of Jillian's I have done... And hard is good since I'm needing a change in my workout routine.

She incorporates several classic moves from other DVD's as well as new movies I have not done yet. It is a 45 minute workout that keeps you sweating the entire time. I wore my heart rate monitor to see how many calories were burned, and it was over 300 for the 45 minutes I worked out. The DVD has two workouts, level one and two like most of her workouts. I have not tried level two yet, but if level one challenged met he way it did, I can assume level two is going to be an even bigger butt kicker. In this workout, there are 6 circuits that you go through twice - the second circuit she has you pick up the pace since you ""know"" the moves now. All you need are free weights and a positive attitude.... in fact, if you have different size weights, that's even better, as she wants you to increase weight as you progress through the workout. Also, if you're a beginner, just like other Jillian DVD's, there are beginner modifications so everyone can attempt the workout.

The only complaint I have about the DVD is that she has a life DJ there and the camera continuously flashes to him dancing to the music he's playing. I'm not sure what the point is of that -- maybe she wanted to try a different style with this one to keep pace up, but I found it distracting and deterring from the actual workout itself. I still enjoyed the workout and you will too if you block out the obnoxious ""live"" techno that the guy is playing.",1391817600,2,1788,4.2251461988304095

The video actually runs like this: Warm-Up, Level 1, Cool Down, Warm-Up, Level 2, Cool Down.  Jillian suggests you do both Level 1 and Level 2 together.  So once Level 1 is over you have to scroll on the bottom and just guess where Level 2 starts.  It's really annoying and I wish it had chapters or a way to select what part of the program to move to.

The Workout: Great!  The workout itself is really engaging.  I workout often and I thought this was pretty challenging but not undo-able.  I usually do Level 1 & 2 together.

Even though I have a lot of DVDs, I generally have always avoided Jillian Michaels because, well, I don't need to be yelled at in order to work out.  I enjoy working out and even when I don't, I make myself do it AND make myself enjoy it because it's great for me and makes me feel good (and LOOK good, of course!).  I brush my teeth, I wear makeup, I work out.  It's just a personal responsibility for me.  I don't need a drill sergeant to keep me in line.  I keep myself in line.

That being said...I finally realized that I never try her and broke down just for the variety of trying a new instructor.  I must say, I'm glad I did!  I really enjoy this workout!  It's not crazy, drag-out tough, but it's challenging, effective, and, at 45 minutes, just right time-wise. I'm not sure if all of her DVDs are like this, but I really enjoyed Jillian leading this workout.  Instead of being yelled at and insulted, which is what I expected, I found her funny and energetic.  She IS tough with a loud voice and a big personality, but I found it more of a refreshing, gruff teasing method than an army officer barking at me.  She made me laugh with her interactions with the 4 other women in the DVD and also was encouraging and positive.  Cool!

As expected from a fitness superstar like her, the DVD's production is top notch.  The lighting, the fab workout clothing on her and her 4 backup workout gals, the set, all very nice.  The music was great, I really enjoyed working out to it.  And speaking of, yes, there are some unnecessary shots of the DJ.  (He's cute though! :-) )  However, the shots are pretty brief, and the only times I noticed was when he was shown in between exercises.  During the exercises, I was too busy sweating/balancing/staring at the ceiling b/c I was on my back, often not even looking at the TV.  It didn't really bother me, and hey, he did a great job!  Love the beats!

There are 2 45-minute workouts on the DVD, a Level 1 workout and a supposedly more advanced Level 2 one.  As of the date of this review, I've only done the Level 1.  I will be doing this one for a couple months and then, when I do Level 2, I'll update my review.  Level 1 is nice!  One thing that I like about ""Hard Body"" that is different from most of my other DVDs is a lack of rigid, 8-count, choreographed reps.  I like that sort of structure, obviously.  But it was nice to just jump into moves and just start doing it, no counting, just going at your own pace until she tells you to stop.

As far as the exercises themselves, they were a blend of strength moves interspersed with cardio moves.  The workout definitely had my heart rate up the whole time.  In fact, with exception of upper body, I felt like I get more of a cardio benefit with a little bit of toning.  I felt this in my lower body a good bit, my abs a little bit but my upper body was really feeling it, with mostly 5 lb. and sometimes 3 lb. weights.  My upper body was the only part of my body that I felt was thoroughly fatigued by the end of this workout.  I actually work my lower body and abs a tiny bit more afterwards and THEN I feel like I've thorougly worked everything.

The moves are fun and effective, and are generally done at a good pace.  The girls try to stay synchronized in their moves while Jillian often walks around giving pointers on form and beginner/advanced variations.  However, I found it better to adjust the speed of a move based upon my personal preference.  While some moves I found really well-paced and a challenge for me to keep up with, other moves I felt were too slow for me personally.  I found that speeding up some moves made them much more intense.  Some of my favorite moves are Suicides (you know, that warmup that basketball players often do when they run to one side of the court, touch the ground and then run to the other side), weighted burpees, the pivot-lunge-punch with weight, the squat and pivot up with arms out and parallel to the ground (with weights).  The hardest move, for me, is that dreaded walking push-up with a hop up and hop side to side and then back down again.  Whew!  I still cannot do every rep!  Still working on that!  KILLS my upper body, and even my legs feel that hopping!

So all in all, I really enjoy this workout!  I'm very glad I gave JM a try, and I will definitely keep her in mind when getting new workout DVDs in the future!

UPDATE 03/19/14: So I finally tired of the Level 1 workout and moved on to Level 2...and wow!  It's definitely harder!  And it's not like just a step up harder, it's more like 5 times harder!!  Wow!  Whereas with Level 1, I had fun but needed more at the end, with Level 2 I am crawling for the finish line, yelling, ""Finally!""  This workout worked me all over, and fried my lower body in particular, which I loved.  I mean, my butt and thighs were burnt out.  I also got a good upper body workout with this.  The only part of my body that felt a little lightly worked were my abs, so I still add a few minutes of ab work after this workout.  But this workout is solid. Most of these moves are so much more difficult to execute than they appear to be when you're sitting on your couch previewing it!  :-) Some of my favorite moves include: the plyo squat with the front arm row with weights (Jillian reeeally lets you hang out here in this move the 2nd time you do it...I was cursing at her to let me stop!); the wall-to-wall plyo squat with one weight where you start squatted down facing one wall, then leap into a squat facing the other wall and then back (whew...the burn!); the ""pass-the-weight"" move where you're on your stomach and pass a weight from in front of you, behind your back...WHILE keeping your arms and legs raised up in a Superman pose...shockingly tough!; the two goddess squat exercises; the kettlebell swing while jumping into a deep squat forward and back; and my personal favorite, the plyo lunge while lifting your weight-holding arms out into a fly, palms down (I encounter a lot of plyo lunges in my workouts...it's a great, effective move but I thought I'd bounce right through this one...could not BELIEVE how much tougher this was than it looked!).  Some moves I modified because they were either too tough (I just can't do more than one of that outside knee to outside elbow/""grasshopper"" pushup...I try, but I usually do one cycle and then just hold a plank while I move my knees and legs...SO impossible!) or because they're unneccesarily complicated (the one-armed mountain climber just requires too much mental concentration to adhere to, and I'm a coordinated person!...I just do a regular, two-armed mountain climber...STILL tough because by the time I get to this point, I'm already sweating and panting).

Solid, challenging workout!",1389571200,11,6889,4.378250591016548

If you're not, I would suggest you start with the 30-Day Shred although Jillian does make this video accessible to everyone with her levels 1, 2, and 3 of training.  This workout is good.  It is an ""up-d"" workout from the moves in the ""30-Day Shred"" level 3.  Jillian really seems to try to give people what they want when she produces a workout video.  One of her first was ""No More Trouble Zones"" for those who wanted to firm and tone.  Then came the ""30-Day Shred, my personal favorite.  This video followed the ""30-Day Shred"" for those who lost weight using the first video and wanted to move on to strengthening and tightening their bodies.  I believe that Jillian made this video to help the ""30-Day"" shredders.  I started working out with Jillian after my second child was born because I realized that my body didn't bounce back as quickly as after my first child, and my muscle tone and movement ability were both going downhill.  I fought back.  I own all of Jiilian's dvds and thanks to her focus (to keep you going) and intelligent moves I have never looked better.  This workout is not just for women.  Men can easily improve themselves using this program.",1389312000,9,1276,4.5152838427947595

These circuits include all sorts of moves from yoga, kick-boxing, resistance and so on which keeps you interested.

Having qualified, I love this workout.  I've been doing Kettkeworx, Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred and exercise bike work and I've hit a bit of a plateau in terms of body change and boredom (the later has always been a challenge for me.). I picked up Extreme Shed & Shred as the price made it a no brainer - totally worth a try.

I am so glad I did.  This routine incorporates classic cardio & strength moves but adds some martial arts and yoga moves.  It seemed like a slower pace than 30 DS but don't be fooled.  My workout mat was wet with sweat.  I likely looked pretty silly at times but the martial arts moves and yoga positions make it really fun.  The day after my first new workout, I was sore in some new spots.

I know she's tough but doable and I have to say I was a little leery of a Jillian Michaels 45 minute workout.  I tried Workout 1 with 3 pound weights. I usually use 5s.  I don't know about a Hard Body, but my butt is definitely hard and I think about 2 inches higher than yesterday. Yowsa!  Also, usually I lose a little concentration by the end of her longer, 40-50 minute workouts.

I walked through most of it the first time and on the second go around I was doing it! I am in week 3 of doing level one and have actually increased my weights from 3# to 8# in some of the moves and 5# weights are now my average. I have seen almost instant changes in my body. Within 3-4 days I had indentations on my sides! I have surprised myself with my desire to keep going and to workout harder. Jillian has been instrumental in this process. I own almost all her DVD's and this one is by far my favorite. I really feel like I got a workout, she doesn't talk to much yet encourages and pushes well, and the music is good. Jillian mentions that the women helping her in this workout are advanced athletes and that actually was encouraging to me. Here I am, only 2 years into getting myself healthy and fit, and I am keeping up with advanced athletes in this workout. I think I stand taller when she says this:)
There are always a few moves I just can't do so during that time I do extra crunches or push ups to keep myself moving. Have yet to look at level 2. I will wait until level one begins to feel easy.",1384819200,2,1253,4.097560975609756

Jillian recommends you complete both workouts and I agree. The entire workout consists of 11 circuits that run roughly 10 minutes each.  That's right, get ready to work non-stop for an hour and ten minutes. She has a nice pace so you never feel winded. However, she covers the gamut regarding the specific moves. Unlike her 3-2-1 system, this workout is more cardio based. There are variations of squats, plank, lunges, ab work, kickboxing, martial arts, yoga, and body weight cardio.  This is my new favorite of her workouts and I just completed Ripped in 30. It pushes me to a level I didn't realize I could achieve.

The moves are just plain hard to execute and I find myself going back to see what exactly I'm supposed to be doing. It's as if Jillian wanted to push her routines to the next limit, but instead of just making them harder, she made them ""fancier"" and this, in itself, makes the second hard to get to.

4716058,5,B005K8QI9E,"I am a HUGE Jillian Michaels fan. I started working out with her videos regularly when I completed her Body Revolution program back in February. Since then, I've done most of her DVDs, including 30 Day Shred, Ripped in 30, No More Trouble Zones, Banish Fat Boost Metabolism, Six Week Six Pack, Killer Abs, Kickbox Fastfix, and Yoga Meltdown. I'm well-versed in Jillian workouts and had started to become bored with her, until I did this DVD.

I absolutely love this workout! It is truly tough and kicks your butt. She adds some new moves that you don't see in her other, older workouts. She puts together an exercise workout that really works upper body, lower body and abs pretty equally. As someone who has been working out with her 5-6 days per week for the past eight months, I can safely say that in terms of putting together a cohesive workout that works everything, this is one of her better DVDs.

I will say this: if you are a beginner, I wouldn't do this workout. This is an incredibly advanced, difficult video. I think you need to be in reasonably good shape to even get through it. She does offer beginner modifications, but in my opinion, that's not enough to get beginners through this DVD. It's very grueling, particularly because it's 45 minutes as opposed to 20 or 30, like most of her DVDs are. It's also fast paced. In her other 45 minute workouts, she gives you more ""breaks"" than she does in this one. I've become used to her workouts and am in fairly good shape at this point and have to do the modified moves the second time through the workout circuit because I'm so exhausted from going through it the first time.

My advice is to try 30 Day Shred and Ripped in 30 before attempting this DVD. I think this is a good DVD for athletic people or those who already workout regularly, so build yourself up to trying it. Some may disagree with me, but the bottom line is the fitness models in her video are visibly struggling to get through the workout when you watch it, which says something. I think if you're a true beginner, you would get hurt. So I give this five stars because I love it and was ready to try it, but for beginners, don't try this until you've been working out regularly for a little while :).",1381276800,16,2234,4.430656934306569

I was in my best shape when I only did Jillian DVDs, so I figured I would buy another one to throw into the mix. I LOVE HARD BODY. She does the workout a little differently than her others; she does 6 circuits back to back and then repeats all 6 workouts again. I actually like that she changes it up and I think my body likes the change, also. Again, a lot like Extreme Shed & Shred, this is an intense full body workout. I love that by the end of the workout, I am dripping sweat and I feel I have used every muscle in my body.

Honestly, if you alternated between this 45 minutes workout and Shed & Shred (the one I did when I was in my best shape), you would be in great shape if you kept at it.

You can use whatever pound weights you'd like, sometimes she will recommend an 8lb weight for some exercises (she does this on level one). I have done both levels of this DVD and love both equally. I do feel like both are heavy on using your own body weight, however, on level one it seems like there is more cardio related moves.

It is a great stand alone workout at 45 minutes each, and allows for modifications as needed. My heart rate was up for the majority of the workout, and I am often sore even after level 1. While I agree with other reviewers that the DJ is a bit distracting at times, it does not take away from a fantastic calorie burn.

Can't make an excuse to skip the workout due to time when you can choose a good 20 minute one to fulfill a short time slot.  Be prepared to sweat!",1376870400,,611,4.28695652173913

The first time I did it, I have to admit I felt sick afterward.  But after doing it several times I have come to enjoy the pain and sweat it brings.  There are a few moves which I still struggle with (weighted burpees, yuck). As for everyone complaining about the DJ, well in the beginnig it is frustrating, but after awhile you don't really care, because you aren't looking at the tv.

So many other videos explain to much so once you get the moves, you're bored listening to them explain again. Jillian is full of great energy as well as the other girls, they work hard and make you want to work hard too. It's just the kind of encouragement you want from a workout video and a decent challenge finally in a sea of so many videos that are too easy, too short or just aren't challenging or interesting. But the music is the worst ever. Why they put somebody's brother-in-law in the room and gave him a turn table is a mystery. It's too loud, horrible sounding and is the only thing bad about the video.",1376006400,,794,4.162337662337662
4716092,4,B005K8QI9E,Another great work out from Jillian. I own almost every one of Jillian Michael's workout DVDs. This one has a lot of the old Jillian moves as seen in her prior workouts but there is a fresh twist to this video. Its not easy but its not impossible either.,1376006400,,254,4.204081632653061
4716093,5,B005K8QI9E,"So, I have a vast collection of Jillian Michael's DVD's. About two months ago, I decided to really get serious and do one of her 45 minutes or hour workouts five days a week. I started off with No More Trouble Zones. I liked it but it felt like I got more of a burn when I mixed it up with two 30 Day Shred workouts back to back. I needed more cardio. So, to make a long story short, I ended up buying Extreme Shred and Shed. The first week on that baby was pure torture. I could only get through workout 1 and three circuits of workout 2 for three days.  Then I decided to push myself through the entire two works by giving it everything that I had. ""Dear Jillian"" No one is ever saying that ""it's just not hard enough."" :-) Anyway. I liked this work out a lot. I felt that it was extremely effective. But you see, I'm burning the last of the last inches of fat off my body. I'm trying to go from a swimsuit body to a bikini body. Jillian calls what I'm trying to lose ""vanity pounds"" and I guess so. Although I have a bulge that I've had since I was fifteen years old that I'm attacking. Plus, I watch what I eat. So... I decided that I'll need to add another work out with Extreme Shred and Shed just to change it up in my 5 day workout week. I purchased this DVD, Hard Body. I almost became swayed by reviews about the cheesy DJ and production quality. However, now I'm like, HUH????? What are they talking about???? I LOVE this work out. Why?

1. You do the first 6 circuits back to back and then start from the beginning. I prefer this format.
2. I like that the girls in the background are really working hard to get through this workout too! :-)
3. I like the variety of exercises and the mix of cardio and strength.
4. And I LOVE how good I feel afterwards. There are no ticks here or there. No owies :-)

Jillian always stresses form first. You don't have to keep up with her but you she does stresses that you keep moving. Also, since I workout with her Monday-Friday, I've adopted a new slogan for my life. I'm starting to ""get comfortable with being uncomfortable.""

So far I lost 10 pounds. I have about 15 more to go--I think. Could be less. It's hard to mark pounds when you do Jillian's workouts because the strength training builds much needed muscle, and muscle weighs more than fat. So although I see my body getting leaner, the hand on the scale ticks downward at a slower pace.

Oh. And I usually eat 1 hour before I workout because if I don't have energy in my body, then I'm zonking out halfway through.

And so I ate an hour ago and now it's time for my workout!",1375920000,112,2587,4.133200795228628
4716094,5,B005K8QI9E,"Thanks Jillian for another intense workout!  I use this in conjunction with Turbo Fire to mix things up.  She really knows how to work all the muscles in the body.

My legs, stomach and arms are slimmer and much better shaped than before. I will carry on exercising with Hard Body, I hope one day I will feel brave and fit enough to switch to workout number two ;) It is a hard but great workout and it does provide great results!",1374883200,,584,3.982905982905983
4716096,4,B005K8QI9E,"I bought this video as a way to workout after having my first baby 6 weeks ago.  I worked out and stayed active throughout most of my pregnancy.  This video was tough!  I only got into about 25min and felt lightheaded and nauseous and had to stop...very humbling! This video is no joke...but that is what I hoped for.  Easy will not get me the results I need and to lose this baby weight.  Even after only half of the video I am sore today.  And that feels great!  So I plan on continuing to try to complete this, knowing that each time I will get stronger.  Also I will it after having a. It in my stomach and after a good nights sleep(not often these days).

4716100,5,B005K8QI9E,"I pretty much love any Jillian Michaels DVD that I can get my hands on. This DVD in particular is amazing. Like any Jillian fan, I appreciate the way that she keeps the workout moving and incorporates different exercises to keep you from getting bored. The format was different from her other dvds, so if you are accustomed to her workouts be prepared for the change. Rather than several small circuits repeated twice, she does one long circuit twice which I found that I actually preferred. Also, there is a live DJ...which is sort of weird for me.

As a whole though, the workout is challenging and intense. There was never a point where I felt either bored or not challenged enough. I recommend keeping a few different pairs of hand weights handy. Some of the exercises are really tough to do with anything much heavier than 10s. But that's me! Also, I wouldn't recommend this DVD for small spaces. You definitely need a good amount of leg room and space for cardio.

Of course, like any jillian fan, I definitely appreciate her energy and her motivational spirit, which is so evident in this DVD.",1374019200,4,1100,4.635897435897436

Jillian helps with more toning to continue the background she laid in her last one. 30 days for me helped me lose a couple of inches, extreme shred is helping toning muscles which I didn't know I had, and helping my endurance. I have two cysts in my one wrist so the second level is a little harder. That and gees the second level is harder, she kept saying one more and it kept going!

4716113,5,B005K8QI9E,"I agree with everyone else that having the camera pan to the DJ is ridiculous but it still doesn't take away that this is an awesome workout! It's now my second favorite next to Ripped in 30. Thanks again, Jillian!",1372204800,,214,4.375
4716114,5,B005K8QI9E,"I actually was looking into buying Jillian Michaels' Body Revolution, but decided instead to buy 5 of her multi-workout DVDs. I ended up spending about $50 instead of the $100+ for BR.

After doing some research this is my conclusion on BR:
1. You only get about 15 workouts (comparable to the 15-20 you would get in just purchasing a bunch of her other DVDs).
2. A lot of the moves in BR are contained in her other DVDs so you're really not getting much that's new if you already own her other workouts.
3. The only thing you don't get is the workout schedule (easy to make one up on your own) and the diet plan (again, there are so many other diet/healthy eating programs that this isn't a problem either). Besides, most people whose reviews I read on BR said that they didn't follow the diet part anyway.
4. I may not know what I'm talking about since I've never actually tried BR, but I'm happy I just went with her other DVDs instead.

I bought this one along with 30 day shed and shred, killer abs, killer thighs, and 30 day shred-it with weights. They all have 2-4 workouts per DVD so I can rotate them to prevent boredom. Also, you can find levels 1 and 3 of the original 30 day shred on youtube (but not the 2nd level, curiously).

As a mom, I really don't have much time to get out to the gym even though I went regularly before the kid. These videos make working out easy since I can do them at home after everyone else is in bed. They're challenging enough for me, but then again I'm admittedly not the in the best shape.

I've been doing 4-5 workouts per week for almost a month and I am definitely feeling less like a lump.",1372118400,5,1637,4.237179487179487
4716115,3,B005K8QI9E,"I love Jillian's videos specifically No More Trouble Zones, 30 Day Shred, Shred it with Weights and Six Week Six Pack.  But this one was hard to follow. I agree with other reviewers about the distractions.  Not only that, but the moves were more complicated and too fast to follow especially if you're doing the workout for the very first time.  I have to say, I'm not really motivated to give it another try.  I must admit though, although I don't think I did a lot of the compound strength moves correctly due to the speed of it all, I was sweating a lot by the end.  I didn't feel that I got much of a weight training workout as much as a cardio one.  I still love Jillian and her videos in general and will continue to rotate them along with my cardio workouts.",1372032000,2,765,4.241379310344827

4716117,4,B005K8QI9E,"I have several Jillian DVDs. This one has some unique exercises, and she uses a different format than she uses in most of her others. Rather than repeating exercises twice within a circuit before moving on to the next circuit, she goes through a single set of an entire series of exercises and then repeats it, so that there is more time between sets of the same exercise. I think I prefer her usual format, but this is an interesting change. It is a good workout. There is a live DJ mixing music, which I find a little distracting, but, overall, it is a good DVD.",1371772800,,564,4.330188679245283

This one does. It's fun, hard, good modifications (which I need starting out!), and I don't get bored. I have been easily bored with the cardio portions of some of Jillian's other videos, though I always enjoy the weight work. On this one, I love the cardio! I managed to get up a great sweat without tuning out.",1371513600,,476,4.359550561797753

4716120,4,B005K8QI9E,Very challenging workout! Yes they show the dj which is weird but after doing the workout a few times it didn't really bother me since I knew the moves. This workout really hits all body parts and incorporates lots of moves I have never seen on previous jillian videos.

4716121,5,B005K8QI9E,"Where I am coming from:
- I go to 5-6 high intensity workouts a week, from bootcamps, sculpting, etc.
- While I still have a few more pounds I would like to lose (25% body fat, wear a size 6), I am in good shape.

What this video was like for me:
- While I have only done level 2, it kept my heart rate at 90% of max for 40 minutes.
- I push myself hard and am only able to do about 90% of the advanced moves, then drop to the beginner moves. This leaves me with room to advance.

Why I love this workout:
- I was so sore the next day and most workouts don't leave me sore.
- There were a lot of advanced moves that I have not seen before, but will be easy to incorporate into my gym classes, like one handed mountain climbers!

Last Words:
- I loved this workout's high intensity, new moves, and Jillian's encouragement.
- If you are a newbie, do not be afraid :) start with level 1 and the beginner moves. I was a complete newbie a couple years ago.

All the best!!",1370908800,4,967,3.9183673469387754
4716122,5,B005K8QI9E,"My DVD arrived today and I previewed the workout and it seemed as though it lacked challenge and was easy.  However, once I did the workout, I discovered it is a hard routine that really kicks your butt!  Half way through I was drenched in perspiration and thinking I would not make it to the end.  I agree that the atmosphere is different but in a fun good way.  Unlike others, I did not find the DJ distracting at all because I had to focus on my form to get the most out of my workout.  This is a keeper for sure and I definitely recommend that you try it and not be swayed by the opinions of others.  So far, I love all of Jillian's DVDs and I appreciate change and having this workout be different.

4716123,5,B005K8QI9E,"I have no problem admitting I am no longer in good shape, so naturally I expected this to be hard for me. But holy hell, it was awesome! I have only done level 1, and truthfully I am scared of level 2, but even just doing the first 30 minutes is, in my opinion, a hell of a workout. I won't go through all the exercises as they have already been listed, but there were some I had to skip (hello, sun salutations!) just so I could be able to do the next one.

The pace is great and there are no breaks. The video says the workouts are 45 mins, but Jillian says 30 and either way the time is packed with moves so you never really slow down or catch your breath (which is good). I personally liked the martial arts moves the best and there were a few that were new to me and used muscles I have not used in years. If you have only a few bucks to invest in at-home workouts, I really recommend this one.",1370908800,,899,3.9395604395604398

4716125,4,B005K8QI9E,"I am reading a lot of reviews about this video and people are complaining about the DJ and the cameras. My view is this, if you have done 30 Day Shred, and Ripped in 30, and 6 Week 6 Pack, etc etc....  You know what your form should be. For the beginners, this will be a very hard video to follow. The first time I did it, I was aggravated about not knowing how some of the moves worked and missing some parts of the workout because of it. I don't like the 2 long circuits, but find that starting with the side I write with each time makes it easier to remember which leg/side to work the 2nd time around. I'm right handed, so each time I do this video I start with my right leg/side. I try not say much bad about Jillian's videos since they are part of the reason I lost 30 lbs. I started with 30 Day Shred, then moved on to Ripped, then until I got a new video I alternated those each day. I now have almost all her videos, I don't have Yoga, or some other ones I can't remember their names. But the ones I have I really like. I alternate between videos each day, If I do the new abs video I will do the kickboxing right after so I get my 50min in that day. If I just do Kickboxing I do 2 levels which gives me 40 min that day. Use the videos as a starting point and make them work for you.",1370822400,,1292,3.8754716981132074
4716126,2,B005K8QI9E,"I love JM I really do. But this was just awful.... nauseating sideways and shaky camera cuts that seem to linger on the pale DJ. Too many girls trying to do the way too complicated moves and no one is in sync... and even when you TRY to focus on one girl you CAN'T because the camera shots are out of order and it's always jumping around. Music was sort of distracting. JM's moves are usually awesome- hardcore sweat inducing insanity BUT simple and easy to focus on getting them right. In this new DVD, you're stuck trying to figure out what the heck she's doing rather than focusing on your breathing or form. It feels like you're trying to learn a darn dance routine. Another problem I had was that I am doing these in my apartment living room in San Francisco. I don't have space to run silly laps and all that. I liked the ""easy"" and ""hard"" versions she usually has in the other DVDS. because then you can focus on one and move on with your life- this DVD made me so frustrated that I literally stopped 20 minutes in, and that's not what I want happening while I'm trying to stay motivated.",1370649600,8,1095,4.294685990338165
4716127,4,B005K8QI9E,I like this exercise video and the range of exercises included.  I felt the burn during the workout and definitely felt sore the next day.  I just wish that there was a more condensed version that could be completed in 30 minutes.

The two reasons I don't like this one are that, first, it requires knowledge of kickboxing moves. I tried it a few times and I was concentrating on coordinating my movements so much that I wasn't really getting a good workout. The footwork was too complicated for me and felt awkward.
The other reason I didn't like it was that the workouts were too short. The DVD said that they would run together but they don't and I can't figure out how to get them to combine without having to stop for a cooldown and another warmup before the second routine.

Definately not for beginners but a great dvd to conquer in JM's long line up of great dvd's. This work out is intense and involves so much body work that when you finish (if you finish) you feel incredible and accomplished. Work out one is new, fun, interesting and doable but still a good challenge. Work out two....I get exhausted just thinking about it! Workout two is amazing, fun, difficult, creative and keeps me entertained. I think JM did an excellent job of incorporating new styles, exercises, yoga and weight training and cardio into one. I've tried both workouts seperately and together...I can complete workout one (awesome), I can complete work out two ( but not without losing form and taking breaks which I hate!) and obviously I haven't been successful in completing both workouts together (my next goal after I can finish two, w/no breaks). Don't wanna make this two long, awesome dvd, congrats JM, my body is shedding and shredding as we speak...I definately see results! Love JM!",1370390400,2,1167,4.898989898989899
4716133,2,B005K8QI9E,"I've done a lot of Jillian Michael's workouts, but I couldn't get through this one. Not because it was too hard, but because the camera work was annoying. What I didn't like:
1. The camera frequently focused on the live DJ standing there bobbing his head and turning nobs. I need to watch the people working out, not some guy.
2. There wasn't a definite ""Advanced"" and ""Beginner"" individual to follow. Each of the women seemed to be going at their own level which they varied depending on the move.
3. It feels like Jillian needs to keep reinventing her workouts so the last two (Extreme Shed and Shred and Hard Body) she's making them more complex and varied. I spent a lot of time watching her trying to figure out what I was supposed to be doing. Example: 3 traveling pushups, then jump right, left, right, repeat.
4. She moves quickly from one move to the next and you don't repeat the moves. I much prefer the 3-2-1 system where you only do 2-3 moves then repeat them.
5. She assumes you know what you're doing so there's not as much instruction on correct form.

I love all of her girls working out with her, there bodies motivate you and every so often Jillian will say something so cute and funny.

The DJ wasn't distracting just totally pointless. The moves were new which is what I was looking forward to but each move seemed to be very short.

Her warmup is really good - really gets the heart rate up and some good butt and arm burn, and she does a really great cool down at the end too.

As in all of her DVDs she has an easy version and hard version to follow so you can work up to the hard stuff if needed. Awesome DVD!

I've seen some reviews complaining about the DJ in this one...I disagree with their complaint--the camera is NOT on the DJ enough to distract from the workout, nor to prevent my ability to observe the form of the move being done.  I really like the music the guy spins.  It was a fresh new ""spin"" to music (which, I typically really love the music Jillian has on her DVDs) and I think it worked well.

One tiny downside:  the cool down and stretch portion is too short.  But, now that I'm on my 11th Jillian DVD, I know the stretches I like and I will just do them anyway.  So, it's not THAT bad.  You just have to do some more stretches on your own.",1368662400,3,1175,4.375

4716159,4,B005K8QI9E,I have most of jillian's videos it was totally different than I expected but that was the point I wanted something different than her usual routines. I will be adding this to my routine and see if this works for me.,1367971200,,215,4.2682926829268295
4716160,5,B005K8QI9E,"Like many of the other reviewers, I am also a huge fan of Jillian's workouts and have done pretty much all of them. I wanted to try this latest one to add something new to my workout rotation. I am really impressed with this workout. A few points to consider:
-This is not for beginners, even level 1 is for those who are more ""advanced."" If you are just starting to workout for the first time or if you have taken time off from working out, I would suggest the 30 Day Shred or Ripped in 30 (level 1, of course).
-Most of the moves are combination moves, meaning that they utilize multiple muscle groups at the same time. Some can be tricky the first time around. Pay close attention to the cues the first time you do this workout so that you don't injure yourself. The moves themselves are different and innovative. I enjoy challenging myself with them.
-Yes, there is a DJ. Yes, it's a little strange and awkward. Whatever. That does not take away from the fact that this is a good workout. Just ignore him. I'm assuming that they brought him in because people on other DVD threads complained about the hokey music. They were probably just responding to that in an attempt to jazz it up a bit.
-If you are at all familiar with Jillian's other circuit training videos, this is a bit different. Instead of doing 3-4 moves then repeating, you will do 6 rounds of moves once, then start back over from the beginning. I like this format because it really makes the time fly by. Honestly, 45 minutes is up before I know it.

Overall, give this a try if you want to try something new.",1367884800,3,1579,4.352542372881356
4716161,5,B005K8QI9E,"I pre-ordered this video as I've really come to enjoy Jillian's DVDs! I'm a busy mom of a one year old and I do have a gym membership, but sometimes it's just more convenient to walk down the stairs rather than pack everything and everyone up and drive to the gym. Jillian has a way of making killer workouts enjoyable. This DVD is my new favorite! She delivers the same butt kicking workouts, but in two 45 minute segments (levels) where you do two different rounds of intense exercises back to back. I use a HR monitor and I burn about 350 calories (I weight 111lbs, so that's pretty good!) and my HR never dips below 120! If you're a fan of Jillian, check this out!

She could cut the workout time in half or double the reps and make it lots better.",1367193600,2,316,3.90625
4716167,5,B005K8QI9E,"I'm a huge Jillian fan and have many of her videos. While I'm a big fan of the 3-2-1 system, I like this one because it is so dramatically different from those. The moves are unique and challenging, unlike any workout I've done before. It's a solid mix of high impact (burpees in a few forms), isometrics, yoga, and martial arts. There are no crunches and (if I'm recalling correctly) no planks - but you definitely work every muscle in your body, including your abs. You'll find some Jillian moves you're used to seeing - high knees, punches, etc. - but a lot of new stuff as well. As someone who hates high-impact cardio (I'll do it, but I won't like it) I love that the intervals are only 30 seconds long, so you don't get that 2-minute block of killer cardio.

Some of the moves may take a few viewings to understand, but you'll get them eventually. I've done the first part several times and have it down. The second workout is uber-challenging - I feel weak afterward, and I'm in pretty good shape!! I honestly can't imagine doing these as a single workout, but I do want to try it one day, if I ever get a full hour-plus to myself!

Overall, I really like this. It's challenging, and you have to like workouts that are hard to enjoy it. I think you would see really solid results if you stuck with this. I'm mixing it in with Fast Fix Kickbox and Ripped in 30 and I feel like I get a good butt-whooping every day.

One note if you're viewing this via Amazon Prime streaming - it's broken into two separate workouts with no main menu and no bookmarks. It's a pain in the butt if you want to start at workout two, and if you want to run it as a single workout, you have to skip over the cooldown from workout 1 and the warmup for workout 2 to do that. Pretty klugy!

My insight in what makes it the best is that it is on the cusp of being ridiculously difficult at first but not enough to collapse. Then slowly it gets more fun, not easy but more doable. I no longer dread it but kind of look forward to it. I've improved my workout music playlist and keep the volume low on the DVD because the music is not at all funky but way too straight club for my taste...

I saw changes to my body quicker than with 30 Day Shred and found that it was a lot nicer on the joints (mostly the impact on my knees) than the Metabolism Boosting workouts (which are far more miserable than this one). I like the flow and find it mentally easier to talk myself into doing it and physically easier to go from one circuit to another than the Meta Boost and more fun than the 3-2-1 style of 30 Day Shred.

Jillian rushes through the moves. There is little instruction as Jillian just seems to laugh through the whole thing. The DJ is annoying and pretty useless because I really couldn't tell the difference in his music throughout the DVD. It was just one long track.

And to top it off, this DVD has to have the shortest cool down stretch in the history of any exercise DVD made. I work-out regularly and can say that I am at an advanced level. And even though I added some stretches at the end, the overall quality of the exercises, the awful instruction, the lack-of flow in general and emphasis on stretching gave me a really sore arm and shoulder for the next three days. I have not had a fitness-related injury in the past and I strongly believe that this DVD caused my pain. The only exercise I got during these three days was tossing this DVD in the trash.  I didn't even bother with Workout 2.

If you like interval training like I do, I would highly suggest ""Paul Katami Bootcamp 4X4X2"" and ""Mike Donavanik's Extreme Burn"" DVDs. I would NOT recommend this DVD to anyone.",1366588800,14,1297,4.391666666666667

So I purchased Jillian's Body Revolution. But, Extreme Shed & Shred came with the program.  While waiting for Monday to come along to start Body Revolution and feeling motivated to make some needed changes to my fitness I decided to make use of the free DVDs.
I have two words, HOLY CRAP! As I said, I'm out of shape and this kicked my butt, but in a good way. I only did the first workout, it comes with two and Jillian wants you to do both back to back, but I'm not quite ready for that, sorry Jillian! I only did the modified ""beginner"" on some of the moves that I couldn't yet do and although I can feel it, it feels great!
I know some people do not like Jillian's personality or style, but I love it. She keeps you motivated and somehow knows when I'm at my breaking point and jumps in with a ""you can do this, don't quit, only 5 more seconds.""

If they really wanted to show the dj why not wait til we were doing something simpler?? Also I found that the camera was very shaky in this disc. What happened????

I absolutely love the Insanity and Insanity Asylum workouts and I've been looking for something to challenge me in the same way. Level 2 of Hard Body is exactly what I was looking for. A lot of the moves are actually quite similar to Asylum but with a little variation, so when I get bored with Asylum I can go do a Jillian video.
Yes, the DJ is a little cheesy but he never actually gets in the way of the workout.
This DVD is definitely not for beginners, but she does have a modifier for level 1 and 2, and if you're not challenged enough, she doesn't have a set amount of reps so you can you do them faster than they go or add heavier weights.
For the people who have read it seems complicated, it's definitely no more ""complicated"" than TurboFire, P90x, or Asylum. But if you are only used to Jillian's 3-2-1 workouts, this will be a challenge! Watch the DVD completely through and test out the moves before you actually do the workout, and I promise that will help.

Don't get me wrong I was sore as anything the next day and I'm glad it was longer than the 20-30 min DVDs she has had lately. The cool down/stretch was wayyyy to short though.

I know some people don't like the new format, but I personally love it - it really mixes things up from her previous videos and offers something new. And I'm not gonna lie, I'm kind of diggin' the DJ. It's just something different and I enjoy it. I feel like it goes really fast because you're constantly moving on to new moves before you repeat everything again, as opposed to doing three moves and then repeating them again immediately.

I haven't tried Level 2 yet. I usually like to wait until I've mastered one level before moving on to the next. I'm still feeling pretty beat by doing all of level 1, but I'm hoping to start Level 2 next week sometime.

Overall, I've found Hardbody to be innovative, challenging and it really keeps my interest. I do enjoy mixing JM's longer workouts in with her shorter ones.

I liked the music and I hardly noticed the camera cutting to the DJ. At no point during the workout did I have trouble getting the form down because the camera wasn't pointing at the girls. The only time I struggled to get the form down was the first time going through the moves because some of them feel complicated when you're seeing them for the first time. Overall, I highly recommend this dvd!",1364947200,3,831,4.367741935483871
4716206,3,B005K8QI9E,"I am a huge fan of Jillian Michaels DVD's.. I own them all.  I got this one because I liked the thought of a 45 minute workout, as hers usually stop at 40 (Boost your Metabolism & Trouble Zones).  I found this one to be a little bit confusing.  I don't like the DJ nearby watching the girls workout, it's distracting.  Mainly though, I was a little confused by the multiple compound moves.  I'm all about compound moves, working more than one area of the body at a time, but some of these moves left me scratching my head.. and I'm not a novice when it comes to working out with Jillian, or any others for that matter.  I own it, and I'll probably work hard to keep it in my rotation so I don't waste the money, but I'm hoping Jillian goes back to her old ways of doing things.",1364947200,2,777,4.112582781456954

Only two complaints: the live dj is a little cheesy and distracting at times.  And as usual with Jillian's dvd's, no one is keeping track to make sure you are doing the same number of reps on each side. They don't, so I have to keep track myself... Other than that, a good solid 45 minute workout that goes fast, but works you hard!",1364860800,3,492,4.157894736842105

4716223,4,B005K8QI9E,"I got Hard Body earlier this week.  I tried level 1 the other day and I just finished level 2 today.  I own all of her workouts, and I always look forward to what she puts out. This is my second review for one of her workouts.  I also reviewed Killer Abs.

Like other reviewers said, these workouts are set up similarly to Six Week Six-Pack in that it's more like one long circuit that gets repeated.  She refers to sets as circuits within the one long circuit, but it's really one long circuit done twice.

Level 1 is about 45 minutes and level 2 is about 48 minutes.  Level 1 is slightly easier than her hardest workouts, but longer at 45 minutes.  I think weeks 11 & 12 of Body Revolution and Level 3 of Killer Abs are her hardest ones, and like I said, I own them all, but everybody is different, and so you might feel differently than me.  Level 2 is on par with her hardest workouts in my opinion, but maybe harder since it's 48 minutes.  Level 2 is harder than say Banish Fat Boost Metabolism and No More Trouble Zones which are both longer workouts of hers at about 55 minutes long.

I love Jillian's workouts.  They have challenged me to go beyond what I thought I could ever physically do, and I'm in far better shape at 40 than I was at 20.  I never was a fan of Biggest Loser or even saw it before, but I tuned in this season to see what it was like.  It's a horribly awful show in my opinion!  I am so glad I discovered her workouts long before ever checking out that show, or I might not have ever tried them.

I made a list of my favorite workouts on my other review for Killer Abs. So here is my updated list from my favorite to least favorite, but really I like them all depending on my mood. I am placing Hard Body at #3 tied with Ripped in 30:

1. Killer Abs
2. Body Revolution dvd set
3. Hard Body
3. Ripped in 30
4. Extreme Shed & Shred
5. No More Trouble Zones
6. 30 Day Shred
7. 6 Week Six-Pack
8. Yoga Meltdown
9. Killer Buns & Thighs
10. Banish Fat Boost Metabolism
11. The Biggest Winner 5 dvd set
12. The Last Chance Workout
13. Power Sculpt
14. Kickbox Fast Fix
15. Beginners Frontside & Backside

And a small recommendation and suggestion: Always watch her workouts prior to doing them.  That way you know exactly what to expect as far as moves, weight, and modifications go.  You might even want to try a new move just to get a feel for it without actually working out.  Some people complained in their reviews about there being a lack of cueing for moves, weight, and changes.  That's another good reason to preview your workouts first.  You can do it on fast forward if you lack the time!  For the most part, her cueing is good in my opinion, but I think previewing your workouts will help you to avoid any problem with what to expect in the workout along the way.",1364083200,10,2796,4.154275092936803

4716225,5,B005K8QI9E,"This is the perfect next step if you've been a Jillian workout fan for awhile.  I have used, loved and rotated a variety of her DVD's for a long time now:  30 Day Shred, Ripped in 30, Yoga Meltdown, Six Week Six Pack, Killer Buns & Thighs and Banish Fat Boost Metabolism.  I spent a couple of weeks recently focusing solely on Banish Fat Boost Metabolism.  Because that particular workout is more like 45+ mins. compared to the others where it is closer to 30+ mins., it was a stretch for me not only physically, but mentally as well.  However, it really improved my endurance so that when I went back to the shorter workouts, I'd finish and jokingly tell Jillian on the screen ""Is that all you got?"".  Ha ha...not that I'd ever say that to her face!  ;)  So anyway, I was looking for something new to add to the rotation and was super stoked to see this new one in the mix.

I love that it's about 45 mins. long. and that it uses weights (unlike Banish Fat Boost Metabolism).  It's intense and definitely a physical challenge, but it's just right.  There are some moves that I really love and some that are gonna take more practice for me to even like!  ;)  Jillian is, as always, good about offering a modifier to follow and all the girls on this DVD are helpful to watch.  I agree with some other comments that the DJ is kind of silly and distracting, but most of the time, I am too focused on not passing out to worry about him much.  Ha!  I love the different moves that build on what I've already learned from her other DVD's but still challenge me to move in ""new"" ways.  There is great variety and you definitely don't get bored!  I do wish the cool down was a bit longer.  She leaves out two stretches (triceps and quads) that she normally does.  I just added those on my own.  No big deal.

My recommendation is to preview the whole workout before actually attempting it.  And I always approach my first attempt at it at about 50% effort, just to be sure I am using good form.  Today was my first full-on run through and I really loved it!  I can FEEL that it moved muscles in new ways.

This is a great workout and I am so glad that I bought it and very thankful to Jillian for bringing it out.  It's the perfect next step for me.  I wish I could tell her in person how very thankful I am for her influence in my journey.  I have lost 50 lbs. and counting!  I feel strong and capable thanks to using her DVD's faithfully.

Sadly, this and the other Jillian Michaels DVDs that I purchased in this order are ALL PIRATED (I ordered Jillian Michaels Kickbox FastFix, Extreme Shed & Shred, Killer Abs and her Hard Body DVDs through Amazon).So frustrated! I will be returning these and buying from Walmart. How to tell your DVDs are pirated- Some pirated DVDs have the disc art, even include inserts and are wrapped as if they have never been opened... A great give away that it is a pirated DVD is that it doesn't have an insert. Your DVD has a code on the disc, you can call customer service and insure that the code on the DVD is legit. You may not mind that you have gotten a pirated DVD... so long as it works...

Every body part felt worked, and I am still feeling it! Once I got the moves down, I went to my zone and at my own pace. I don't feel the need to keep my eyes glued to the tv during workouts. The dj didn't bother me at all, and I didn't even notice that the girls were out of sync(and who cares about that?this isn't dance aerobics). And personally, I think Jillian's great.

As the camera was constantly moving I had to rewind to check I was doing the combination correctly. This got frustrating. This time she had new trainers with her who were not in sync with each other. It was a bit of a mess really.  There was also a DJ in the DVD. Who knows why?? But the camera kept going over to him. He was not working out or had any weights. I am not interested in DJ's if I was I would buy a DJ's DVD or go and watch him. Get rid of the DJ. This is supposed to be a workout DVD. I expected much better.,1363651200,3,833,4.018072289156627

I'd say the first time when I followed it, I was sometimes confused and also couldn't catch up with some movements (since I was still trying to figure out how to perform the previous one....) Unlike the other Jillian's workout dvds (I owned many of them, actually), this workout DVD contains many new and interesting movements. It also combines different styles of exercise, ranging from yoga, kickboxing, to tai-chi, etc. I found it really fun to learn some new movements, and think I had a good workout if concentrate on those movements and performed them right (instead of simply imitating the movements without concentration). I'd recommend those who would like to try something experimental and fun from Jillian. I never feel bored when following her dvds. If you are not familiar with some movements in this dvd, just stop the video and keep practicing and then continue the DVD. (And I am sure you will really have a good workout.) :)

I've followed this DVD for a few months and are familiar with all of the movements. I have to say, this will be a GREAT workout if you follow Jillian's pace and perform each movement correctly.",1363564800,2,1184,4.752427184466019

I pre-ordered this new one and couldn't wait to try it out, I have to admit that when I first tried it, I didn't like them, a little too busy for me, a little too much like PX90 or Insanity workout. I decided to give it another shot and guess what, I fell in love with both levels. The moves are more difficult, but would for sure to render better results. I've only done each level 3-4 times so far and already noticed some differences on my arms and legs.

I can't wait to be able to do all the moves in the advanced way (so far I've been taking moderation due to my pregnancy), and bounce back to my pre-pregnancy shape, thank you Jillian!

A quick update on my postpartum recovery, I lost all my baby weight and bounced back to my pre pregnancy size in 3 weeks after my c section, and I recovered extremely well after the surgery. I believe I owe it to the regulular workout during pregnancy.",1363564800,2,1251,4.2478991596638656

4716239,2,B005K8QI9E,"I own almost every Jillian Michaels DVD.  I'm a huge fan.  I am by no means a beginner.  I just ran a half marathon in December, yet this DVD is beyond what even I can do at home.  If you are a beginner looking to keep that New Year's resolution, don't buy this DVD.  Get 30 Day Shred or Ripped in 30 instead.  the Hard Body DVD consists almost entirely of Combo moves.  Jillian combines two or more ADVANCED moves into one to maximize burn an get you a hard body.  No doubt it can be done, and I'm positive Jillian has done her research.  But, in my opinion, this workout is very complicated.  The moves take enormous coordination.  And quite honestly, they're just not fun.  Body Revolution and Shed and Shred are the most fun, if you're looking to mix up your workout.  I also worry that if a beginner tries the Hard Body workout they may become injured.  You really need a trainer to spot you on some of these complex moves.

That being said, if you're a bad *** looking to take it to the next level and really challenge yourself, by all means go ahead and buy this DVD.  Oh and each workout is 45 minutes instead of 30, so you must have more time to complete the workouts as well.  I myself prefer to add weight to a simpler workout in order to up my burn.

Jillian tried to add some creative moves to this DVD, but it was just a combination moves from the previous workouts.
Perhaps to make up for a lack of creativity, she needed to add a DJ into her workout.
The DJ is the most annoying part of this workout. If he just played the music, it would have been fine, but they had to get several shots of him during the workout.
I was working out and thinking ""they gotta be joking"" ""Come on, really?""...
The DJ didn't even look fit at all either.",1363478400,12,615,4.264957264957265
4716241,2,B005K8QI9E,"I love Jillian Michaels DVDs.  I love the older ones the best - 30 Day Shred, Six Pack Abs.  I was excited to see that she came out with a new DVD but I am so disappointed in this one.  I don't think it is as good of a workout as the others and there are so many distractions!  Namely, the shots of the DJ.  Every time I wanted to check my form by watching Jillian or the others working out, I would get interupted by shots of the DJ.  Why would you show that in the midst of doing reps of something?  Jillian is always preaching proper form.  How do I check my form if I am watching a DJ push buttons or dance to the music?  I need to see the girls that are working out.  Can't see the modification options or if you're keeping up with the girls or check your form if you're looking at a DJ who's trying to act like he's in a club somewhere.  Also, I don't like that Jillian doesn't tell you the next move or show you the next move before she begins.  By the time you get it, you've lost some reps.  I also don't like only doing one leg, then having to remember which leg to do for the next interval.  Just do both sides each time - it will guarantee that you hit both sides.

I wish she would go back to the basics and do another 30 day Shred with different moves.  It's just a great workout with an easy to follow format.  I also love how Jillian used to explain what muscles you are working as you work them.  Visualizing the muscles is a great tool that she really helped me push myself.",1363478400,43,1492,3.9663299663299663

Totally didn't have a problem with it. The DJ was a strange element, but not too distracting for me; mostly it kinda made me chuckle to myself, which is a somewhat welcome thing during intense work out time. I loved the workouts. My workouts consist of rotating Jillian DVDS and running. I believe in changing things up to keep the body guessing and this DVD was a welcome addition. I loved the length. In the morning I don't have time to do a full hour, but I can squeeze 45 minutes on some days. A lot of the moves were brand new and her old moves were cranked up a notch. Many of the old moves were some of her more difficult moves and if you thought those old moves were difficult, well try adding weights and jumping. I really enjoyed the 1st workout; didn't feel like I was going to die. But the second workout I definitely felt challenged. There were 4 new demonstrators and none of them annoyed me; which was nice.

The only thing I don't like is this is set up as one really long circuit that you repeat 2 times.  She usually does it like 4 circuits you repeat 2 times a piece.  But that is not really a big deal.",1363219200,,520,4.13
4716247,4,B005K8QI9E,"First of all, I have always loved Gillian's DVDs. This time around I was looking for a supplement to work into my normal routine, which is P90X, that would add more variety to my cardio workouts. Hard Body fits the bill perfectly! It is fast paced, challenging and quick! When Gillian says 45 min, she means 45 min from start to finish. I have only done Level 1 so far and I can certainly feel it in my shoulders and my heart rate was elevated for almost the entire workout. Some of the moves can be difficult if you are new to exercising (such as the lunge/bicep curl to Warrior 3 tricep kick backs) and Gillian's cuing isn't great in this one. I would have liked knowing what the next circuit was going to be before ""grabbing some weights"". As it was my first time through I had to keep switching weights because I didn't know what the exercises were going to be. Also, if you are working out first thing in the morning, the warm-up  is VERY short. You may want to take an extra 5-7 min before starting the DVD to warm-up and stretch, which is what I will be doing in the future. The same is true for the cool-down. Overall, this is an excellent, challenging, face paced workout that will have even the most fit athlete sweating, but still coming back for more!",1363219200,2,1263,4.329113924050633

I am a videographer and I enjoy interesting camera angles, just not when I'm working out.  Jillian seems to be making up moves as the workout progresses.  And the DJ was there for what?

4716253,4,B005K8QI9E,"I will preface by noting that I have only done Workout 1 so far.

As someone who recently completed Ripped in 30, I truly enjoy this DVD. If I could give 4 1/2 stars, I would. Two reasons why I didn't give it 5 stars:

A) The cool down is like two or three stretches. I really enjoyed the cool down on Ripped in 30, and if that DVD warranted several minutes worth of cool down, this one certainly did as well. My back is killing me right now, and I think a longer cool down would've helped.

B) As other reviewers have said, the production quality seems a little off (colors, angles, etc...), but for me, it was only a bit distracting at the beginning. Once the workout got started, it didn't bother me anymore because I was too focused on the exercises to care/notice.

The workout in itself gets 5 stars. I have to admit, I was hesitant at first. The first two moves in workout 1, there isn't a set amount of reps - Jillian just says ""Do as many as you can in 30 seconds,"" and, as someone who loves having a set number of reps and loves having structure in workout DVDs, I was worried that the whole workout was going to be 'Welp, just do as many as you feel like doing...' However, as the DVD progressed, Jillian began to have the backup girls do a certain amount of reps for each move, so luckily it was just that 1st circuit that was kind of a free-for-all.

I, for one, enjoy Jillian's personality and 'preachiness'. I know that it turns a lot of people off, and I get why. But when I started her DVDs, I was very unhappy with my body, had very low self-esteem, and was unmotivated to do any kind of physical exercise. She really gave me perspective on the role I was playing in my own self-pity party and kicked my a** into gear. I am very much inspired because of her. However, for those who were turned off my her intensity in Ripped in 30, I'm here to say that, though still Jillian, she is certainly more encouraging and soft-spoken in Hard Body and less of the up-in-your-face-screaming-at-you-to-push-yourself that you saw in Ripped.

This workout is very challenging. I imagine the second one isn't any easier. Because I think it is important to give your muscles a break and not stress the same muscles everyday, I have decided to switch up this workout and do Hard Body Day 1, Killer Abs Day 2, and a workout from Ripped in 30 Day 3 then start from the beginning again.  I look forward to this Summer to show off the results ! ;)

P.S. I have always struggled with Cardio that is high-impact due to 'exercised-induced asthma' as the docs call it, however I found the cardio moves in Ripped to be more challenging than the ones in Hard Body (possibly since the cardio moves in Ripped run 2 minutes long vs. one cardio move here and there in HB), so if you struggle with cardio as well, I think you'll find the cardio moves to be relatively attainable. (However, beware of the strength moves in the DVD. I'm hurting right now...)

EDIT: I just completed workout 1 of Killer Abs, and if you have done this DVD before, then the layout is the same as Hard Body (minus the DJ). I'm pretty sure its the same gym as in both DVDs.",1362960000,9,3137,4.2944162436548226
4716254,5,B005K8QI9E,"I own all of her DVDs, including Body Revolutions. Her workouts have been one of the only things (besides Weight Watchers) that has helped me lose weight. Thanks to her work outs and WW, I have lost 73 pounds to date. While this DVD workout is different from her others in the 3-2-1 style, I have to say, I love it. It is nice to change things up every now & again. The DVD incorporates her 'old' moves but adds some creativity to them as well. I will always be a Jillian Michaels fan and as long as she continues to release new DVDs, I will buy them. I love & ""hate"" her all at once.

I am an intermediate woman exerciser and found many of the moves too hard balance wise, and too hard on my wrists, while not giving me enough of a muscle workout or very much cardio intensity. Also, as others have pointed out, the workouts themselves are only 30 mins, if you take off the long warm up/cool down portions. I agree with others who have said that she seems to be aiming for novelty and strange, original moves, but many of those moves don't really give you much in terms of exercise, they just feel awkward. I like a lot of JM's videos, but not this one. Good thing I only borrowed it from the library, instead of buying it.",1362873600,8,803,4.395973154362416
4716256,4,B005K8QI9E,"I have a love-hate relationship with Jillian's workouts -- while I hate how hard they are, I love what they do for my body!  :-)  I have a collection of close to 300 workout DVDs (working out is one of my main hobbies), and Jillian's always get results in a short amount of time.  All it takes is just using her workouts for about three weeks, and I drop weight and tone up quickly.  I know that this new ones of hers will get plenty of use.

This new workout is broken down into two sections:  Workout 1 clocks in at just about 45 minutes (including the warm-up and cooldown) and Workout 2 clocks in at about 48 minutes (including the warm-up and cooldown).  To do the workout, you'll need some dumbbells ranging from 3-10 pounds, depending on your fitness level and strength.

Another reviewer already provided a breakdown of each of the workouts, so I'll focus on other aspects of this disk.

The cardio in Hard Body is mostly high impact, but you can modify if needed and one of the background exercisers does modify all of the moves.  You do six circuits in each workout one time through, and then you repeat the circuit another time.  Jillian doesn't use her 3-2-1 format in Hard Body, but it's still effective and tough.  The moves/exercises are also ones that are in her other workouts, but she puts them together in new ways, so that the two workouts on Hard Body feel fresh.

The background set on Hard Body is also different from her other workouts (I don't have Body Revolution, but I've seen some clips from it, and it looks like the same set), and she has four background exercisers, instead of her usual two.  The background sort of looks like a prison to me (with its barred windows and bleak grey colors), but that's not much of a turn-off for me.

The shots of the DJ didn't bother me as much as they did other reviewers, but perhaps that was because I was gasping for air too much while doing this!  :-)  Jillian's personality was also a bit more toned down in this one, which I appreciated.

Overall, if you're looking for an advanced workout to change up your routines, this is a good one to get!",1362873600,4,2117,4.412371134020619
4716257,3,B005K8QI9E,"As already noted by other reviewers, this does not follow the 3-2-1 strength-cardio-abs formula. Instead there are two repeated circuits per workout. I've got no problem with that. What I don't love is the increased difficulty in learning the choreography of the moves. There are more varied twists, turns, steps, and lunges within each exercise than in her other videos. One of the things I've liked about exercises in other videos (Ripped in 30, 30 Day Shred, Burn Fat...) is you can learn them quickly, allowing you to focus on form right away. I haven't gotten much of a workout so far because learning the exercises is slowing me down. Once I have them down, I'll probably get a lot more out of it and it will feel at least as physically challenging as her other videos. So, if you don't like exercise moves that are heavily choreographed, you might be better off avoiding this DVD. But if you like the challenge of more complicated moves, then you may actually like this DVD more than her other titles.

One more thing I must note...I find the aesthetics of the video terribly distracting. It was like they wanted the video to look like Club MTV (look it up on YouTube if you're too young to remember the 80's). They kept showing the DJ spinning things and doing that ""you can tell I'm a DJ because I'm shrugging one shoulder to keep equipment in place"" thing. And the camera shaking and weird angles distracted from focusing on the moves. I think this would have been far better if she would have stuck with the set up of just Jillian, someone to demonstrate the beginner version of moves, and someone to demonstrate the advanced version.",1362873600,6,1645,4.633561643835616
4716258,4,B005K8QI9E,"I've been using Jillian's workouts for 3 years since Ripped in 30, and nothing has changed my body like her workouts. Like a lot of the other reviewers, I don't quite get the DJ and the music is too techno for me, but it's not a music dvd, so I'll move on from that aspect. The camera moves didn't bother me because I watch the move once and then I'm not really looking at the TV all that much.

I did workout 1 and like the new approach of doing all the circuits once through, repeat and done. There are a lot of her classic moves with nice twists to them, the weighted burpee is probably my favorite as well as the side lunges with chair squats. The two moves I had a tough time with were the traveling pushups with standing jumps, and the weighted push up/row with mountain climbers because I can't do pushups on my toes, only on my knees. So moving in and out of the moves took me longer. For the traveling pushups, I substituted traveling planks, and I just did the push up/rows/mountain climbers at my own pace. I always feel like I don't get the full benefit if I can't do the move fully and at the same pace, but fortunately it was just those two moves. Workout 2 awaits for another day.

Overall, I really liked the workout but only gave 4 stars because I did not like the warm-up - that's the one place she doesn't need to get so creative, just stick to the tried and true warm-up rather than weird complicated moves. And there was barely a stretch at the end. For a tough workout like hard body, you need a little more than a quick hammie stretch and shoulders.",1362787200,4,1572,4.219269102990033
4716259,5,B005K8QI9E,"Weighted burpees.  In Level 1.

If that sounds like part of an awesome workout/challenge to you, then get this DVD.  If it sounds overwhelming, I would recommend one of Jillian's previous DVDs such as ""Extreme Shed & Shred"" or ""Kickbox FastFix"", both of which have a similar aesthetic and workout routine style to this one but their moves are not as insane.

I have all of Jillian's DVDs, and this is by far my favorite workout.  It feels more fast paced than her others.  You're constantly changing moves and positions (which my very short attention span loves) and even halfway through you feel like you've gotten a real total body workout.  This is part of what makes this DVD my favorite of hers.

Most of Jillian's workouts divide the body (Workout A will be back, biceps, and quads, Workout B will be shoulders, triceps and butt).  The ones that are total body workouts (like Extreme Shed & Shred) still somehow feel like they're targeting some parts of the body more than others.  This is the first Jillian workout that feels like it hits everything equally hard.  It's intense, full of awesome combinations like pushup-to-plank-row-to-mountain-climbers, and at the end you're thinking ""I can not believe I just completed that!!""

On a personal note, Jillian has also toned down her god complex in this one.  I love Jillian, but sometimes her ego can be a bit much and she can get kind of preachy.  Not as much in this one.  While the moves are more kick-a** than in her other workouts, she's a bit softer.  She's more like a trainer and less like a shouty drill sergeant.  So far, ""Hard Body"" Jillian is my favorite Jillian.",1362700800,27,1632,4.690140845070423
4716260,5,B005K8QI9E,"It's sort of a mashup, style/lengthwise, of NMTZ, BFBM, and 6W6P.  The moves are either completely new, or have been altered and/or combined together in unique (and sometimes painful) ways.  I've only done level one, which ran 45 minutes.  I was sweaty and purple upon finishing, and may have been even more so had I not had to stop to figure out what the hell they were doing (some combos were marginally tricky, but not so much that I couldn't figure it out).  I also had to move some stuff out the way, as I needed a bit more room than in other Jillian workouts (my house is tiny).  And of course, she was Jillian throughout, though not as abrasive as she's been in the past.  If you like her style, this won't disappoint in that area.

She repeats one long set twice, and each set is comprised of about 6 or 7 circuits containing 3-4 moves.  Does this make sense?  And the moves consist of an interesting blend of strength, cardio, abs, and otherworldly combos of the three put together.  Among these are weighted burpees, surrenders with camel twists, and those weighted push-up/rows combined with mountain climbers.  She recommends a combo of 3, 5, and 8 pound weights.  To be honest, there were moments where I wished I had 3 lbers on hand.  Mostly, though, 5lb did the trick, and I did a few moves with 8 (these moments were fleeting, however).

Now, I liked the workout a whole bunch.  But the production threw me off.  For instance: there's a DJ.  Why?  WHY?  Plus, the camera doesn't always focus on where I want it focused, primarily b/c there's more going on in the studio (sort of like Insanity, etc.).  The set is different, and there are about five women doing these moves (some advanced, some intermediate, and at least one doing beginner modifications).  Also, you won't be spending as much time on any one move, as the pacing is pretty quick.  These last two points, though, are good things (overall).  Like another reviewer mentioned, this is NOT here 3-2-1 system, but I think it's just as effective (and actually, you'll get more cardio in along with some pretty super weight training).  I'm simultaneously looking forward to/dreading L2 of this DVD.",1362528000,17,2172,4.640419947506562
4716261,3,B005K8QI9E,"First, I love Jillian's workouts.  I have all of them and was so excited to see this one coming out. But I never would have thought in a million years I'd give a Jillian workout a 3 star rating.  But I am.  I only worked through workout 1 so far, but...something's just weird about this one.  As a workout, it's good.  But the production quality is distracting.  I don't want to see constant quick shots of the DJ, especially while in the midst of doing reps of something - I need to see the girls that are working out - the DJ doesn't have weights nor is he displaying the form you're to be using.  Can't see the modification options or if you're keeping up with the girls or check your form if you're looking at a DJ who's trying to act like he's in a club somewhere.  I also don't like the moving camera that looks like it's just held on someone's shoulder and constantly moving.  It's like she was shooting a music video instead of a workout video.  It's very distracting and hard to focus on form when you can't focus on the women working out or even see them part of the time. And the women she has working out with her aren't always in sync like her back ups in other videos.  It just seemed like it was slapped together and not real high on the quality.  Again, as a WORKOUT it was pretty good.  A little quick through a lot of the moves, but not bad. Hopefully the second workout on the DVD is a little better.  One reviewer mentioned it was kind of a long circuit repeated twice rather than the more structured, focused circuits of 30 Day Shred and Ripped in 30 and I have to agree.  I loved the 3-2-1 system best of all her workouts.  But this longer circuit through twice isn't horrible.  It's that way in her 6 Week 6 Pack - do all the moves, repeat once, you're done.  I just really have mixed feelings about this one though. I loved some of the new twists she put on old moves.  I will say that.  But wish she had stuck to the production quality of previous videos and didn't go through all of the moves and modifications so quickly.",1362528000,215,2048,4.202564102564103
4716262,3,B005K8QI9E,"I was really excited about this one, as I have been doing 2 workouts backtoback from her earlier dvds (ripped and shred) to get to 40 minutes. I only did workout 2 from this one (Hard body) and while I understand the notion of interval training, i felt like there were soooo many different exercises, I didn't do any single one exercise enough to make an impact. While I appreciate incorporating weights into an interval workout, I felt there was a lot of time spent changing weights and learning new exercises instead of actually doing them (at least the first time thru). For interval training, I prefer Amy Dixon or Insanity. I still love Jillians Ripped DVD and will keep doing two workouts from it.

There are all new people (no Natalie. boo!). And there is a DJ-- not sure why. Overall, I really like these workouts.

It's hard to describe if you haven't see it but trust me. Really strange workout. I would not recommend it at all. I do love all of her other workouts though.

4716269,4,B005K8QI9E,"First off, this DVD is Two 30 minute workouts- NOT two 45 minute workouts!!  I'm not sure why it is advertised as so, even on the box?  It's almost at 40 if you add warm up and cool down, however I do not count cool down especially, as a part of the workout.  And, I own nearly all of Jillian's dvds, (9 total for me) and not one has ever counted the warm up or cool down in the total minutes advertised as ""work out"".  REALLY disappointed Jillian would approve of such misrepresentation here!  I just wanted to warn buyers so they know what they are getting before purchasing!  I'd have bought it anyway, as I love her circuit training and I've gotten amazing results, however I think fooling buyers is not a way to run business.

The above is why I rated this dvd 4 stars and not 5.  Other than that, I really enjoy the workout, I like that it has new moves (the kick boxing stuff is new for me and some of the yoga incorporated) and old moves she's changed up to make even MORE challenging!  I like the sequencing as well in how she does the circuits.  I found it just enough to keep me breathing hard and my  heart rate up, with just a few moves that were more strength that gives you a bit of a break before another move that works those muscles hard again!  I appreciated as well her explaining some of the moves, even still, some still take some concentration from me to  make sure my form is correct.  Another thing I appreciate, in all her dvd's, she is constantly explaining proper form, I find that even though I may have done a move 25 times, I can still catch myself not doing something 100% and this reminder allows me to correct.

Overall this dvd reminded me of Ripped in 30 meets 6 pack abs maybe?  I like that it gets my heart rate up and burning a lot of calories- this is a much better burn than Killer Abs or Yoga Meltdown- which I also recently purchased both and was a disappointed to not be burning as much as normally her dvd's provide.

Believe me when I say this: if you are serious about working out, this DVD will get you results. But  keep in mind you must keep your body guessing in order to get ripped.

Despite the fact that it is about 75 minutes long, it goes by really fast!  I know some people think the ""pep talk"" at the end is a little odd, but I like it and find it pretty motivating.

This is Jillian, if you hate her voice, attitude, or have an aversion to sweat and working out hard skip this video. In level 1 the first exercise is bur pies so that should give you a clue. It's not much recycled from the other videos that I can really recall. There are two workouts on this video that can be done together or separately with a warm up and a cool down.

The video is a mix of plyometrics, kickboxing, yoga, some cardio and strength training. It's ot for the faint of heart but if you push or a avid exerciser you can do it, drenched in sweat but I feel so good when its over.",1356825600,2,766,4.066225165562914

I am a runner and I use Jillian's videos to keep my muscles toned.  If you are looking to shed some pounds, the DVD is for you.  You will get a variety of moves.  Some of the moves are advanced.

*I would not consider myself a beginner athlete, I work out 5-6 days/week running, lifting weights, swimming, and kick-boxing. I still find this workout challenging.

4716309,5,B005K8QI9E,"I honestly do not know of any other workout that is as hard core as this since I was in the military.  She has a beginner level gal, but even the beginner level is major work.  I started my fitness journey the first week of Oct and was using her 30 day shred, Yoga Meltdown, Banish Fat Boost Metabolism, and No More Trouble Zones, so I already had a good base of her workouts and was starting to get great results.  I ALWAYS watch the workouts before doing the program so I know the proper form and what I have ahead of me. I currently weigh 157, down from 166, 5'5"" and when I do this workout and I do both levels at the same time (so it's one hour), I burn about 550 calories, I sweat beyond belief to the point my hair is soaked and I'm dripping onto my mat (gross, but it's good!)  And the cool down...wow.  She goes beyond just body, it's about the mind too.  I highly recommend this DVD if you are seriously ready to sweat, feel like you're gonna die, and get done and be able to say, ""holy crap, I did it"".  You do this and stick to it, you will see results and fast.  I make sure this one is in my weekly schedule at least twice a week and sometimes 3.  I like to have at least one day of Yoga and some days I only have the 20 minutes and need to do the Ripped in 30.  For the advanced fitness gals out there...get it!  Bashera (I think that's the right spelling) even has her moments of grunting and you can see her muscles shaking.  That tells you it is exactly what it's called...EXTREME! She mixes everything in there...cardio, strength, yoga, kung fu, and some crazy things that I don't even know what to call buy crazy!  NO regrets and love the challenge.

Since I played soccer, softball, and basketball growing up the whole step block and yoga and dance crap really turned me off--I've never done anything like that and I thought that's all workout videos really were. Well I was wrong.

I bought Jillian's workout because my sister has her videos and really likes them. I did the video for the first time last night and I can tell this will become a regular thing for me! I loved it! The moves are familiar enough and since I used to lift weights I know the proper form on most of the moves too. I only did level one and that was perfect for me. I can see myself moving on to level two or combining them soon. The moves are original and exciting.

Either way I get a very good workout and I am used to working out. Like other reviewers mentioned the transitions form one movement to the other are not very smooth but that is what makes this workout video so much fun.

Even after 60 days of using Jillian workouts, I still find them all challenging, even the week one.  The workouts are circuit training combining 3 minutes of strength training, 2 minutes of of cardio and 1 minute of ab work.  Begin with a warm up, 3 circuits, and a cool down.  Total 30 minutes.

The first one, with the warm up, is about 35 minutes, and the second one actually is 45 minutes, including the warm up. I did the two together the first day I tried the DVD and it left me exhausted. I LOVE level 2 of this DVD. It is hugely challenging. Some of the moves are tough really tough, but I love the variety in both workouts because you know that your whole body is working.
One of the things I appreciate most about this DVD is that Beshira (sorry if I misspelled the name) is REALLY working. It frustrates me when I'm working so hard and the people in the DVD are just grinning at me the whole time. Beshira sweats and grunts her way through the end, and it makes me feel like I'm not alone.

I've done both levels already and and let me tell you that my muscles burned throughout the whole workout. The static moves are pretty challenging. This type of resistance excercises make your muscles stronger and tone you big time - besides the new moves could take you out of plateaus (just be patient until you get them right). People may think that if you are not moving you are wasting your time, but actually your muscles are working non-stop throughout the whole time you are holding the pose.

Another important positive point is Jillian's attention to good form and her explanations to better perform your workout and avoid injuries.

For those that are used to have a stronger/cardio workout, I would recommend mixing level one with other exercise. What I've been doing is mixing for example Ripped in 30 first and then level one of ES&S, otherwise, if you have the time, do the whole level one and two together or just do only level two by itself.

All in all, this is a great workout. Level 2, as most people have pointed out already, is a killer. Only thing though, if you do both together, yes, it's long, but it really goes like a breeze, you just have to find the time to do it.",1343347200,3,1298,4.51063829787234
4716324,5,B005K8QI9E,"Before trying this workout, I had previously done Jillian's 30 Day Shred, Ripped in 30, Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism, No More Trouble Zones, and Yoga Meltdown. I have really enjoyed all of these workouts and would definitely go back and do them again at some point.
Now, for the Extreme Shed and Shred - I read quite a few of the reviews before buying this one because a lot of them seemed skeptical and didn't like the fact that this workout is a fusion workout. I do have to agree that if you are looking for strictly cardio or strength training, you would be better off using BFBM (cardio specific) and NMTZ (strength training specific). That being said, I love this workout! True, it is very different but I sweat a lot during it and have fun doing it. The first time I tried it, I was just going to complete Level One; however, after doing just Level One I felt that I still had some energy left and decided to do Level Two right after - I am glad I did it is a really good workout to do if you choose to do both Levels One and Two. It is a long workout though - overall it is an hour and twenty minutes to do both Levels One and Two (this includes the warm-up and cool-down, both are about 6 minutes long). I love the fact that she incorporates some yoga moves into this workout - but if you are new to yoga you should either try and watch the workout before you do it or rewind the video to make sure you understand the proper form and technique for the yoga moves. I have done yoga in the past, so I was familiar with the yoga moves.
In Level One, there are 4 circuits that are repeated twice and in Level Two there are 5 circuits that are repeated twice, so obviously if you do both workouts together, you are doing 9 circuits repeated twice - it's a lot by the time flies by!
I know people have said in the past that Jillian talking during her videos can get annoying or offend them, but honestly I just listen to my Pandora app (they have some great workout stations) and just tune her out so she does not bother me at all and sometimes I find she is very motivating when you want to just collapse on the floor and quit.
I have been doing this workout for about a month and have noticed definition in my arms and legs (I have been doing it 3 times a week, alternating it with her Yoga Meltdown DVD, also doing this 3 times a week). I feel MUCH stronger and my stamina has increased so much. I am STILL sore after doing it yesterday and am using muscles I either haven't used in a long time or ever! Definitely recommend this DVD if you are looking for something different.",1341878400,5,2583,4.168

I have about 5 or 6 other Jillian Michaels DVDs and Extreme Shed and Shred is making me work!  I love it.  This will be my warm up before I attempt her 90 Day Revolution.  The workout is hard.  I've been doing it for 3 weeks and level 2 is still a bear.  I cannot do the full one hour workout yet.  I am just not ready but love the challenge.  I know some folks on this page can't stand the yoga and the slower moves, but she puts them in at just the right spot to make them hard after you've been huffing, puffing and feel ready to drop!  I have to add, when I do the 30 Day Shred and go back to Yoga Meltdown, I realize I've lost my flexibility.  The slower moves are well worth it.  It makes it more challenging and prevents boredom.  When I have the DVD so memorized that I know ahead of time what move is next, I begin to get bored.  No boredom here with Extreme Shed and Shred.  My only critique is to make a fourth level at 30 minutes mixing up the moves from both  level 1 and 2.",1339200000,2,1154,3.842553191489362

After being consistent with the Flat Abs in 6 weeks video, Level 1 for this new workout dvd was a breeze, even performing the more advanced moves.  However, beware because Level 2 exercises after having performed Level 1 can be painful.  I was literally feeling my heart stirring in my throat.  JM is a FANTASTIC trainer, but you totally have to be focused, dedicated and push yourself beyond the comfort zones.  You do end up completely wet and covered with sweat after performing both levels.  The moves performed in this video are more kickboxing, jenga, pilates and balanza moves; not much floor exercises are involved.  She includes some minor moves covered in her Yoga meltdown, but most of the moves were completely new to me.

I love the fact that JM motivates the heck out of you in all her workout dvd's.  I cringe every morning when I push her dvd into the player, but once I am warmed up and ready to go, it goes by fast.  This video does move fast, and therefore perfectly paced.

It moves really fast because of all the varied moves.  It worked muscles that I had not worked before which is important for a high metabolism.  As usual, Jillian brings it.  I love all her workouts (Yoga Meltdown is the only one I do not like but I'm very picky about my yoga!!); they are the best out there.  I hope Jillian never stops writing books and putting out exercise videos.  I had to giggle a bit at her little ""sermon"" that she gives at the end of the video -- it just proves that she is really into what she does and she believes in it.

I don't know if I didn't read the reviews as well as I should have, but I didn't like the workout. It seems like there's a lot of yoga moves, which is fine, but I prefer more active moves. I also have issues with my shoulders and there's a lot of floor exercises with planks which I have a difficult time doing. I hate it when I get a video and it doesn't work me as hard as I was expecting or there's moves that I can't do because I'm not flexible.

The outside cover looks like a cheap copy of the orignal label. The DVD looks like a burnt DVD with a sticker label on top. Aside from that, the DVD did work correctly. Considering this is titled Extreme Shed and Shred, I would assume it's for people needing to lose a lot of weight. Common sense would tell me that people needing to lose a lot of weight tend to not be in shape at all. This DVD is definitely not for beginners. You need to be able to withstand a 45 minute workout to complete 1 workout. I do like how she changes things up with her circuit training technique, but I do not like the yoga she adds in this DVD. I have never done yoga and had to stop working out on several occassions to watch her do the moves, and still didn't get some of them down. I feel like I didn't get a complete workout because of that. If you've done yoga and are looking for cardio and strength training to mix in with it, this DVD is for you. I do think this is a good overall workout, but I prefer the 30 day Shred to this one because of the yoga. I do not have enough coordination to do all the moves.",1336953600,,1220,4.066390041493776

I'm just beginning, and the workout moves pretty quickly, so it's hard to keep up at this point - although I will appreciate the faster pace once I learn and get used to the workout.  So, A grade on the workout.  FLIMFLAM: there is also a meal plan that is advertised as ""included"" with the DVD.  However, the DVD contains no codes or instructions for accessing this meal plan, and if you just basically google the title of DVD to sign up for it, you get to a page on which you provide all of your info and then offers you a $4/mo meal plan.  So, I'm calling flimflam on the fact that this meal plan is not so ""included"" if you go the obvious route.

UPDATE: I contacted customer service, who sent me the free meal plan.  However, the PDF is so huge that my computer freezes each time I try to open it.  They informed me that they don't have it in another version and offered no further help or response after I wrote to them that this wasn't acceptable....",1336867200,2,1047,4.252525252525253

I have about 10 lbs to lose (thanks to stress eating) and work out about 40 minutes/5 days a week. I am proof that Jillian's saying about ""Eating through any workout"" is possible :(

This workout is a great option for my regimen. I have done both 45 minute workouts back to back. It is relatively easy to follow although I have had to rewind to get some of the combinations down. The exercises have modifications which one of the ladies demonstrates for beginners. All I needed was my yoga mat and a set of dumbells. Not much room is required and I can do it in my tiny apartment living room. It is definitely NOT easy but also well worth it. I feel wiped out by the end. I have tendon issues with my right wrist so a few of the combinations which involve weight bearing on the arms (i.e. mountain climber) are ones I have to skip. However, I am sore in all the right places (abs/glutes/quads/calves)after these workouts.

I have lost 2 lb in one week (along with cutting out fast food/increasing water/lots of steamfresh veggies). I can tell that this video will help me reach my goal weight in the next few weeks.

I really like Ripped in 30 by Jillian too, I have most of her workouts but Extreme Shed and Shred is on another level, Jillan herself also looks much leaner in this dvd too compared to her older dvds, I do realise she was also working on Body Revolution around the same time, but this workout works, I  have had great results in a short amount of time.

Unlike her Ripped in 30, 30 day shred circuits of weights, cardio and abs, this one combines kickboxing, yoga, weights, and plyo. She recommends doing BOTH in one shot. IT IS NOT EASY.

I just did this today. Level 1 is not easy but manageable for an intermediate level exerciser (I made it halfway through p90x before deciding to up my running, and I run 15-20 miles a week). So I decided I'll do both. Level 2 is insanely difficult. I felt like vomiting. But it's good! It's intense but very different from her other workouts, which I feel are more tradition strength/cardio combos.

Still bearing in mind I did not completely do both workouts, I was totally stiffening up and getting sore a few hours later and it was hard to walk the next day! It definitely works your glutes, even though it doesn't seem like it does when you're doing the moves.

In The 30 Day Shred, when Jillian says she's giving you a 20 minute workout, it is really a 20 min workout PLUS stretching.  In this DVD the first workout (WITH THE OPENING STRETCHING) was around 33 minutes long.  And furthermore,  I would not consider level 1 extreme.  The moves were not terribly advanced and I had to run afterwards to get my calorie burn up to 300 calories.  I haven't tried level 2 yet.  So to sum it up, I'm super bummed, because I thought I was buying two workouts, when I really only got one.

UPDATE - Yesterday I tried Level 2 for the first time.  The good news - it was significantly harder than level 1.  I feel I got a really good workout.  Higher calorie burn (245 for me).  I'm SUPER sore today, mostly in my triceps and upper back.  Level 2 felt a little longer than level 1, but I was interrupted several times by my children, so I can't be sure.  Next weekend I'll try doing level 1 and 2 together.  I'm bumping my review up to 3 stars.  Even though I STILL think the cover/promotion of this DVD was misleading, at least I'm getting two decent workouts: 1) level 2 on it's own and 2) level 1 and 2 combined.

I know a lot of people were put out by the fact that she does some new exercises. I liked the change of pace it's a good way to get out of the box of regular exercises.

This is my favorite of hers so far because it does incorporate a little bit of everything- strength training, HIIT, yoga moves, etc. One word of caution- this dvd is not for beginners.

Some of the moves she introduces here are new, and while I appreciate Jillian's effort to put a new spin on things, I'm afraid that those of us who lack coordination or knowledge of yoga or traditional kickboxing moves may not get as much out of this as we would like. There were several times where I had to stop and watch certain moves while I tried to figure out how to do them myself, and even when I tried to take a stab at it I wasn't confident that I was using the correct form because I didn't sense that I was pushing myself like I usually do. That being said, I do like that this workout is longer, and that you have the option to do levels 1 & 2 all during one workout. It did also go by quickly because I think the variety makes it less monotonous. However, I think this workout may have been better received if more time was spent on demonstrating the more awkward, newer moves. I own several of Jillian's workout DVDs, and I think my favorites will continue to be Banish Fat Boost Metabolism/No More Trouble Zones, and Ripped in 30 or 30 Day Shred if I'm pressed for time. I'll probably keep up with Extreme Shed and Shred from time to time just for variety, although it won't be my go to workout. Nice try Jillian, but I'm looking forward to future workouts (like kickboxing!) in hopes that they'll be more my style.",1330819200,2,1512,4.3462897526501765
4716359,5,B005K8QI9E,"I just finished working out to Level 2 ""advanced"" with weights.  This is definitely one of her better workouts.  The length is perfect (about 40 minutes actual workout time) and just challenging enough.  I work out every day doing either steady state cardio, HIIT, or weights, and I will definitely be adding this workout to my regimen.  The best part though?  Jillian's inspirational talk at the end of the cool down.  Truly a delightful surprise.",1330560000,,448,4.906666666666666
4716360,3,B005K8QI9E,"I'm a big Jillian fan and pretty much have all of her DVD's, so I bought this one simply to add it to the collection and add variety.  I thought it would be a good addition to either follow Ripped in 30 or add into the rotation.  While I did like the workout, it didn't seem as intense to me as Ripped in 30.  That may be because some of the moves are still new to me, and as I perfect them they'll become more challenging.  I do LOVE the variety in the workout, which is what I love about Jillian, because I get easily bored otherwise. Also, I was expecting two 45 min workouts, but the first one was only about 35-40 min total, includuing warm up and cool down.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, as I do my workouts very early in the morning and am typically pressed for time especially during the week, it just was different than I expected.

All in all, I'm glad I bought it and look forward to trying the second level or even combining the two at one point.",1330387200,,965,4.1063829787234045
4716361,5,B005K8QI9E,"Back in November, I started using Jillian Michael's DVDs. Within two weeks of exercising only THREE-FOUR times a week, and following a basic calorie log, the people around me noticed a complete change in my body. (I only had about ten pounds to lose.) I should exercise 5times a week, but the fact that her work outs and plans are effective at 3-4times a week, is a testament to her formula. Here is what I LOVE about Jillian Michaels: she pushes your ability to exercise in ways you may or may not be prepared for - but it is ALWAYS doable. She encourages you every step of the way. ""We are stronger in the times we are broken."" - Ernest Hemmingway. ""Get comfortable with being uncomfortable.""

THIS DVD - Extreme Shed & Shred - was new and it was different. The first time I did it, I only did Level 1 because I did find some of the moves strange. It took me a month or two to come back to it - not because I couldn't do it, but because it was a little confusing. I had never done Martial Arts moves. Form is SO important. If you don't feel the burn, you aren't doing it the right way. Today, I did the DVD in its entirety. I feel great. YES, there are a few weird moves that may take a time or two to nail down, but that is what is great about the work out. Jillian Michaels is always testing and stretching the limits, and the exercises DO work and ARE effective. ALL the moves work multiple muscle groups, and every circuit has HIT training - burning fat by raising the heart rate. SO, for those who say that this video is ""too fusion"" - open your mind. It may be a little out of the ordinary, but that is as much a part of training your body as training your mind. Jillian doesn't just train your body, she stretches your mental ability through balance, and different, unexpected exercises. It is the same concept as using a different hand to brush your teeth. So, if all you get out of this DVD is a fresh opportunity and way to work out that pushes your general way of doing things - that's enough, because the mental rewards are as important as the physical. Practice that in your everyday life, and see what happens. Opportunity, opportunity, and new experiences and perspectives.",1330300800,4,2190,4.315533980582524

She also puts both workouts together into one.  If I knew they were only 30 minutes, I would not have bought this dvd.  I was expecting a much better workout from her.  If you want real effective workouts, look at Bob Harper's dvds.  Those are absolutely insane, but awesome.",1330128000,8,560,4.226415094339623

- I love the combination of different types of exercise (yoga, kick boxing, cardio, etc)- definitely keeps things interesting.

I didn't even make it through the first circuit. She doesn't explain the moves, they go through them really fast, and she's started to incorporate moves that require way to much thinking, so that means I don't get as good of a workout because I'm so focused on what I'm suppose to be doing. I'm all for incorporating new moves but I'd rather do squats, curls and jumping jacks instead of bouncing around and running around in circles.",1329350400,7,571,4.447619047619048
4716368,4,B005K8QI9E,"This DVD is a little outside Jilly's typical realm. Her other DVDs are generally about a half hour with mostly the same moves but tweaked and rotated a bit. This DVD is a little different - there are lots of new moves, but still in the familiar 2-repeat circuits. This is longer than others -about 40-45 minutes apiece.

There are two workouts, and you can do one or the other, but she encourages you to do one and THEN immediately the other. That way, it's about 80 minutes long. Quite long.

The first workout is great - it feels like a regular good, sweat-inducing Jilly workout... just a little longer and more intense than the shorter ones. Great if a half hour just isn't enough for you. The second work out is a little less cardio and more serious workout stuff. If you do them one after the other, it starts to feel pretty long. BUT as usual when you push yourself, you feel great at the end.

The first time I did it, I literally laughed aloud when I saw her do one of the moves from the second workout. You start on all fours, with your knees an inch off the ground, and then have to flip yourself up into a squat with your arms over your head. I grumbled afterward, but gave it a try, and, though it's hard, you can do it. I'm no crazy athlete, and it's doable. Give it a shot.

Overall, the first workout is great, but the second work out is, well, extreme for the average jo. You'll feel like a champ for sure.",1329091200,9,1423,4.220588235294118

4716370,3,B005K8QI9E,"I became a huge fan of Jillian Michaels when I got her Ripped in 30 DVD.  I love the 20-minute workouts on that DVD and decided to get another DVD just to keep things interesting.  I decided on the Extreme Shed and Shred because it has two longer workouts instead of 4 short ones, and I figured I could use the longer workouts on the weekend.

Therefore, I was a little upset when I popped the DVD in and Jillian told me that the DVD was comprised of two THIRTY minute workouts, not 45 minutes.  After doing both workouts, I can also say that the first workout is shorter than the second one as it only has four circuits, whereas level 2 as five.  Level 1 also has more ""stretch"" type exercises whereas level 2 has more of the plyometrics that Jillian is known for.

Both workouts are pretty intense, though Level 2 is much, much harder than Level 1.  I enjoy both the workouts (and am so glad to see Basheera is in this one, too!).  However, I feel the package is misleading - the first workout is definitely not 45 minutes, the second workout is MUCH more ""extreme"" than the first, and the DVD claims it's two workouts but Jillian wants people to do them together as one.  Hence, I knocked a couple of stars off for this.

That said, I do really enjoy including this workout in my rotation and feel like between this and the four weeks of workouts available to me in Ripped in 30, I am unlikely to get bored any time soon.  I will probably get 30 Day Shred, too, to have as much variety as possible.  I'm really happy with Jillian Michaels (though I tune out of her motivational speeches during the cool-down period), and will be sticking with her for quite a while!",1329004800,5,1668,4.310897435897436

4716374,4,B005K8QI9E,"This workout is broken down into two workouts, 1 and 2. When I first started doing the DVD, I only did workout 1. I was kind of disappointed at first.  There were moments it was hard, and I knew I could make it more challenging without the modifications, but I thought maybe this would be one I wouldn't like from Jillian.

Then I decided to go for it and do 1 and 2 together, as she suggested. For at least 4 times, I could not finish the 2nd workout. It definitely got more difficult, and even though I thought I was in pretty good shape and had very strong legs, I got tired.

Then FINALLY, I decided to push through to the very end of the DVD and did the entire hour.
I WAS EXHAUSTED!
If you make it through the WHOLE DVD and push yourself through, you should feel awesome. I felt great all over. The workout made everything work. I have more lower than upper body strength, so I was really glad that this workout incorporated a lot of ab work.

So if you start this DVD and you think it's easy, PUSH through and go through the entire workout. I've made it entirely through twice now, and I think if I can work through it 3 times per week, I'll be in killer shape.

I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 just because it is a longer workout. Sometimes I need a quicker workout, like the Buns & Thighs. But I would still recommend the entire workout for someone who wants to stay in shape (and maybe lose some inches around the waist along the way!).",1328572800,2,1443,4.120996441281139

You will like this even more if you like to do a variety of moves, and at a fast pace, this is perfect for you! You will not get bored at all. She does moves from karate, yoga, kickboxing and many more!

Cons:
1. If you are not use to Jillian Michaels, it will be somewhat difficult to follow some of the moves. She moves extremely fast from move to move. So if it is your first time dealing with her, you may want to simply watch it the first time.
2. Many of the moves could possibly cause injury if not done correctly, and she doesn't talk about ""specifics"" to ensure correct posture.
3. It can be somewhat difficult if you are not use to her workout dvds. But you can DEFINITELY work up to getting use to her! Just work your way up. I promise it will be worth it!

I recommend you start with the modification on the ones that you are intimidated and then try them when you feel like you're getting stronger. I love the jui-jitsu and kickboxing. I'm starting to enjoy the yoga, in the beginning it was my least fav part, for whatever reason I hated doing sun salutation but now I love them.

4716380,4,B005K8QI9E,"In my opinion, this is the hardest (and therefore best) Jillian DVD to date! Both workouts hit every muscle and work in cardio to maximize your workout. Another plus: Extreme Shed and Shred also does not repeat almost any moves from Jillian's previous DVDs, which admittedly, some of her other workouts do. If you use other Jillian DVDs, the new moves and incorporation of kickboxing keep your body guessing since it's very different from her other workouts and as we all know: variety means better results! One caveat: the workouts, especially Workout 1, have a lot of higher impact moves that are not very friendly for people with injuries. Even the modified positions were a little too much for my knee that I'm rehabbing. However, Workout 2 is a little less impact but still kicks your butt. I'm working this in with Jillian's other DVDs and 30min of cardio every other day to lose weight for my wedding and I'd recommend this DVD and anything else by Jillian to anyone.",1328227200,,974,4.735294117647059

There isn't as much cardio as say, Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism. She mixes some new movements in, such as yoga, Jiu-Jitsu and Brazilian. Very interesting and not typical of her.

I like the way she modifies things and doesn't make you feel stupid or weak for having to modify. Some of the movements are very difficult and definitely need to work up to them. On the other hand, some of the moves were a little too easy, but she emphasizes that adding a little weight will make it more advanced. It is definitely true.

She is definitely fun/ funny and has a sense of humor when she messed up the phrase 'Shed and Shred.' She had me laughing. There is also an added bonus of bloopers. Definitely watch that  :)

I personally don't have time to do both levels 1 and 2 in one sitting. 45 minutes is my typical time frame. I feel like level 1 is not enough for a sufficient workout by itself.

I mix between Jillian Michaels' cardio, weight training and ab training. Now I have this DVD to add to it. I feel like this is sort of a break from all the others and is kind of a breath of fresh air (even though challenging).",1327276800,2,1268,4.333333333333333

Though the workouts are different, by the 4th time you do this you get it right.. I found level 1 to be fun and a good workout,, She should really explain the moves and how to make the correct position, that annoys me, you can really injure yourself..alot of these moves are advanced and need to be explained properly how to do them,, ...The problem is going on to level 2 right after Level 1, its gets boring,, Alot of the moves in level 2 are hard on the back and should not be done if you have back problems..Again the moves are not explained right.. i have lower back problems now--alot of pain and couldn't do some of the moves....I would either do level 1 or 2 not combine them, i feel its too much on the back and knees as mine are strained now and it gets boring,,, .. i need to take a break from exercise due to my back injury Dont buy this one!!

I actually felt like ""when is this gonna be over!"" instead of ""oh, its over already!""",1326931200,2,587,4.113043478260869

4716393,3,B005K8QI9E,"I am one of Jillian Michaels' biggest cheerleaders but this just fell short. I am an avid runner but I like to break up my routine with workouts at home. I own 30 day shred, BFBM and Trouble Zones (and a couple of Bob Harper's DVDs) and I was excited to purchase a new DVD. This was just plain weird to me. She didn't explain many of the moves and some of them required far more coordination than I have and I just fumbled around. All in all I felt it was a total waste of my time. I barely broke a sweat at all. I was disappointed because her DVDs I do own are straight forward, uncomplicated yet challenging. I am giving this 3 stars because I guess if you have good coordination you may enjoy this.",1326844800,3,701,4.086956521739131

It's a great workout broken up into levels 1 and 2 yet she encourages everyone to do both of them together. I usually break them up just because of time contraints. One or two moves are hard to figure out (hip heists...still have no clue what I'm doing) but I like the inclusion of yoga moves along with all her other crazy hard moves. I'm a fairly conditioned athlete and I find this DVD challenging, especially if I do both levels 1&2 or just level 2. Thanks Jillian for another great DVD!",1326758400,3,580,4.330275229357798
4716395,2,B005K8QI9E,I'm a big fan of Jillian. I love 30 day shred as well as Ripped in 30 but I was very disappoited with this video. The moves are difficult and she doesn't go over the correct form like she does in 30 day or ripped.,1326672000,11,213,3.7555555555555555
4716396,3,B005K8QI9E,"I'm a Jillian Michaels exercise video regular, and I'm a huge fan of hers.  I currently own 6 week 6 pack, 30 Day Shred, Ripped in 30, No More Trouble Zones, Yoga Meltdown, and Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism.  Needless to say, I was very excited when this DVD came in the mail.

I'll now start with the negative things about this video.  Compared to her other videos I owned, this one didn't challenge me very much at all.  I hardly broke a sweat!  Keep in mind I also was only doing level I moves, and perhaps I should've been doing level II (I only have used it once, didn't watch the video beforehand so I was going on the safe side).

Another thing I didn't like about the video was that I live in a small apartment.  I normally don't need a lot of space to do Jillian Michaels' videos, but some of the moves I wish I had a bit more space.  Sometimes the video was a bit hard to follow as well, due to lack of explaining.

The positive things about this video is that it went by very quickly.  The workout is supposed to last 45 minutes.

In conclusion, if you're a Jillian Michaels workout regular or an avid high-intensity training exerciser, you may not find this workout very challenging.  But if you're new to exercising, any of Jillian Michaels videos will be effective.  Just keep in mind there are more challenging videos.",1326585600,2,1332,4.361788617886178
4716397,4,B005K8QI9E,"When I first did level 1, I thought it was too easy and then I did level 2 and thought it was ridiculously difficult the first time. Now that I have done both workouts, consistently, and do the beginner and advanced portions of both (to mix it up), I like it more. I break a sweat doing level 1 now and I appreciate the mix of different disciplines. I DO NOT like the last circuit of level 1. I love yoga, don't get me wrong, but I grumble every time I have to do that sun salutation followed by the speedbag and capoeira. I hate that last circuit with a passion.

I do echo someone else's sentiments on here though that this workout requires more space. I have a very tiny space to work out in and some of the moves I have to modify so I don't kick furniture.

Overall I recommend this, give it a while if you don't like it at first. I was ready to return it to amazon for a gift card credit after 10 days of working out to it. Then, I read some reviews and reread the one where someone so generously recapped the whole workout and I was reminded that there are some great elements to this workout (really love holding dragon stance, from Kung Fu). I was persuaded by that review to keep it a bit longer and now I am very glad that I did. I am currently rotating this dvd with killer buns and thighs.",1326585600,,1301,4.078125

I can't seem to find the meal plan though... on line I am asked to sign up for $4/week for all that- NOT free- maybe its just a matter of knowing where to look, or if another reader could reply.

We do a lot of hiking here in Colorado, bicycling, skiing, etc., so we're pretty active.  Wife has been hammering the workouts (almost like ""muscle confusion by rotating the various Jillian DVDs) and has lost a lot of weight (no, I'm not allowed to say how much) and has toned herself beautifully.  I use 15 pound weights to get the appropriate level of exertion going when I do the workouts.  This will kick your heinie if you do the workouts honestly and with proper form.  Aerobically, they also get your attention if you keep doing them without stopping or slacking during the specified exercise elements.  This DVD is more ""rounded"" in that it alternates weights, aerobics, and yoga-like stretching, all of which work together well.  The length, when both sets of exercises are performed together, is another real attention grabber.  It's interesting that the types of exercises and the order in which they're performed are very consistent with the programs that are offered by rather expensive trainers at the gym.  Overall, if followed regularly with appropriate dietary considerations, it will whip you into shape pretty well.  Especially when augmented by other sports activities, etc.  Very much worth the investment, especially compared with alternative DVDs and the professional trainers at a gym.",1326499200,13,1469,4.951020408163266

I did the first level today, and I absolutely love it. I have at least 5 of her other workouts, and this is the most advanced. It is a nice variety of martial arts moves, yoga, and cardio. Your heart rate only goes down if you're doing it wrong, because for me, those isometric moves work your muscles just like the plyometric ones, (I wear my HRM) or heart rate monitor. Note, I am heavier and have lost over 60pounds so I consider myself failry athletic now; though I have a long ways to go before I can master this workout.

4716402,5,B005K8QI9E,"I went from a boring 45-minute 5-days-per-week treadmill routine to Jillian's videos last year at the suggestion of a co-worker to whom I was complaining to about my lack of muscle tone. I never looked back at that treadmill!
First of all, I'm calling B.S! on each and every bad review I've seen of hers wherein someone claims to be unchallenged by Jillian's training. Really? I don't believe you, not for a minute. I'm in better shape than the vast majority of people I run into on a daily basis and I can't even get through her DVDs without a few breathers here and there, and I still use some of the beginner modifications! If you're not challenged, you're not doing it right: this workout challenges even her assistants, and I find it impossible to believe that any of the women who come on here complaining that they don't feel challenged are in anywhere near as good of shape as they are.
I personally love Jillian's badass personality, but even if you don't, play the video with sound the first time and then mute it and play music instead after that. I do that anyway because I get tired of hearing the same things time after time.
I own all but one of Jillian's DVDs available on Amazon, and I rotate them all daily. Not a day goes by that something isn't sore. Having gone from a cardio workout routine before starting Jillian DVDs, I had a low body fat percentage to start with, so I haven't lost pounds, but I have lost fat for sure! My arms are more toned than ever before, my waistline is more defined, and I've got one heck of a donkey butt, which I am LOVING!
I like that in each new DVD, Jillian offers something new to her followers. There are few repeated moves, and she mixes up combos on moves that she does repeat so that we don't get bored. This video is an excellent addition to my rotating Jillian workouts! I got my workout-hating mom of 50-something to start using my Instant Jillian videos from Amazon and she's seen major results! We'll both be grabbing up whatever she puts out for years to come!",1326499200,211,2026,4.434316353887399

The moves in Level 1 were a combo of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, yoga, kickboxing, and weight training. All in one! It was a bit confusing because you don't know what's coming next as she really doesn't explain any of the ""moves"". It's just assumed you know what to do next and can just ""jump-in"". Level 2 proved to be more of the same and she offers for you to combine Levels 1 and 2 to really get a workout. Why do that? With all these crazy and odd combinations, it seems to me like someone just threw this DVD together and combined moves where they did not belong. I find it hard to believe that one would take a class and find all of these moves combined. Is this a ""kick-butt"" workout? Not really. I have done harder and this one is not it. If you want to do some moves you have never tried, try this DVD. I think I will stick to her other DVD's like Ripped in 30 and Killer Buns and Thighs.

Is Jillian chatty-yes. I did not find it annoying though as I was definately concentrating on the workouts.

I struggled with Insanity, I'm 47 and not nearly as lithe as the girls on the dvd - but I certainly must have garnered greater fitness than I thought, since Extreme Shed & Shred was actually pretty easy.  Even the first time.  Now I know Jillian says we can make it more challenging by using weights.  But, I have always heard that you're not supposed to use weights on the same muscle groups one day after another.  And the moves that were challenging for me (balance moves) were nothing aerobically.  It also seemed that some of the moves were more about some need for originality than actually physical benefit - some just plane silly (and potentially risky).  And would it be so hard to put an interval timer on the screen?  Or how about a section offering a tutorial of some of the more risky moves?

I'll say it again, I wanted my butt kicked and the video didn't deliver.

Jillian has incorporated some kind of funky, dance, karatee kind of movements in there that I could have done without.  Yeah, they burned a little but my heart rate wasn't going and I was seriously bored.

if you are new to Jillian you must be aware that she's really like a trainer taunting you and encouraging you but in a no BS way...which I like...I also love having the regular supporting cast members...

Wasn't expecting to get so intense so quick. I'm about 20 lbs overweight and in pretty good shape and one of the first exercises is burpees which are difficult for me.

There were some exercises I could not do but I made it through the whole thing.  The second time I did the video I tried to do workouts 1 and 2 back to back.  I completed workout 1 fine but halfway through the second workout I was so exhausted and wasn't able to do the full set of some of the exercises.  I'm excited to keep doing this video to build strength and stamina so that I can complete both workouts back to back.

The hardest part for me is that she's come up with such creative (and challenging) alternatives to exercises she's done in the past, and my body just isn't used to those exercises yet.  For instance, the plank-jack-push up is hard, as are the one-leg mountain climbers (regular mountain climbers already challenge me enough!).

I am not familiar with some of the moves in this workout but I am learning. It is hard to follow along as you are learning new movements.

4716417,2,B005K8QI9E,"I've been a huge Jillian Michaels fan and you can imagine how excited I was (yes, little things excite me these days...) when I heard that Jillian was releasing a brand new DVD.  Suffice to say, this DVD was not what I expected it to be.  Let me start off by saying that this DVD, along with her 'Buns and Thighs' workout are my least favorite ones EVER.
Although I appreciate the fact that she's trying to mix it up a bit with new moves, but I felt as though the whole workout was in-congruent. She kept on repeating that this a 'Fusion' DVD and I think she was saying it so much in order to actually convince herself that it was worth us having to spend our money on.  Fusion... It was, but not in the good sense - it's like having two different dishes that appear to be appetizing, but when you come right to it; it's simply not that good.  Alas, the same could be said about this DVD.
She mixes in various kickboxing moves, Yoga, Sumo moves, and Koperia (not sure how it's spelled); in any case, the moves just don't seen to flow well with one another.  They just seem mismatched and all-over the place. The kickboxing moves was simply placed in order to prepare us that she has another DVD in the works: ""Teaching you guys the basics for when I do my kickboxing DVD series""... And yup, I was right in thinking she was just 'prepping us' for her new DVD. Check out the link: [...] It comes out on March 6. If the link doesn't work just look for it on Amazon.
I'm all for new moves, but some of them made me stop and go: ""What the heck is she doing?"" The moves are simply placed for 'shock' value and little to do with actually working on the 'target areas' she would be talking about.
In my honest opinion, Jillian Michaels has peeked and her last two DVDs are just the proof that she is seriously running out of ideas.  I mean it's bound to happen if you happen to release two DVDs per year since 2008.  If you're looking for a good Jillian Michaels' workout then I recommend the 30 Day Shred, No More T Zones, and Ripped in 30.
Will I stop liking Jillian? No, not really.  However, I think she needs to sit down and come up with workouts that are feasible and stick to moves that are shown to work and be effective.  If I want a kickboxing DVD, I'll buy a kickboxing DVD not a workout that promises me to become extremely shed and shredded only to find it a platform to promote her new workout venture.  The two workouts in this DVD are easily forgettable and I doubt I'd ever do them again.  Kickboxing followed by Yoga Sun Salutations just doesn't appeal to me.
And the one thing I can tell Jillian Michaels is this: Stick to what you know because 'fusion workouts' don't seem to be your strong suite.",1325548800,118,2709,4.2407766990291265

4716421,4,B005K8QI9E,"I want to first say that I am really looking for a DVD that is mostly cardio & at least an hour long but can't seem to find one! I bought this DVD because Jillian has helped so many people lose weight. I used her ""Burn Fat, Boost Metabolism"" DVD for a while but got bored after a few months.

The plus of this workout is that it will make you sweat (I work out for 1 hour to 90 mins daily and I was sweating by the 3rd circuit) and there are some tough moves. The downside is that it's not constant cardio and while some of the moves are downright exhausting, other moves were too easy. I'd rather have 90 minutes of consistent fat burning, not muscle building (this is just me though).

I've done this workout 2 days in a row and did both levels 1 & 2 together and am pretty sore even though I regularly work out. Jillian really pushes you in this workout, her moves do take a lot of endurance & strength so if you're a beginner looking to lose weight you'll probably want to do some of the moves without weights at first. I'm at the point where I don't want to build anymore muscle so I do all of it without the weights.

The reverse plank leg raises are killer! I want to throw things at Jillian during some of the circuits lol. All in all, a challenging work out that definitely burns calories and builds endurance over time.",1325289600,,1329,4.1434108527131785

There were some really fun yoga and martial-art type moves in Level 1 and some really intense core and balance moves in Level 2 that I have never done before.  I love the mix of different exercise genres that Jillian put together in these workouts.  I am a huge power yoga and martial arts fan so those moves were my favorites.  Even though these workouts weren't as cardio-heavy as some of her others my heart-rate got pretty high at some points.  I could barely walk after completing Level 2 so I know I got a great workout.  Jillian is as motivating as always and I really enjoy the banter she shares with her cast.  And I was thrilled to see Bashira again because she is one of my favorites.  You can always make these workouts harder by increasing your weights.  I doubt I'll be doing both levels back to back any time soon though just because Level 2 is so challenging for me!

You are moving ALL THE TIME in this, just as in her other DVDs.  I was a little put off by the yoga parts of the circuit at first - until I realized that they are very intentionally placed and she is continuing to hammer the muscle groups already hit by the other higher intensity parts of the circuit.  I would give 2 notes of caution -
1 - This will WORK your balance, so you need an uncluttered space.  I found my self wobbling on several occasions.
2 - She gets a little philosophy-laden at the end, so if that's not for you, I'd skip the last few minutes (2-ish) of the cool down.  It's a lengthier cool down than her others, and while it's definitely warranted, the last few minutes are just kind of meditative and, IMHO, nice but not necessary.

GREAT title - perfect for someone who likes a challenge and likes to keep things moving.  Terrific modifications for the beginner or for those craving a little more burn.  She mentions in passing during the workout that she may do a kickboxing workout in the future.  BRING IT, JILLIAN!  Can't wait!",1325116800,,1682,4.412337662337662
4716425,5,B005K8QI9E,"If you have most of the Jillian workout DVDs at home, you will not be disappointed by this one. There are a lot of new moves in this one that you won't find on any of her other DVDs. There is some yoga and Brazilian fighting moves along with kickboxing and some old favorites (like butt kicks). Although, I'm not sure that I am up for doing both level 1 and level 2 back-to-back like she recommends. Overall a fun, new workout that is now part of my workout DVD rotation!",1325030400,,471,4.186813186813187
4716426,3,B005K8QI9E,"Typically I like Jillian's workouts because they are usually pretty tough.  This one, however, not so much.  She does include a few challenging moves, but the rest are recycled from other DVDs or new moves that don't really do much.  The fusion aspect of it is good if you want a longer workout that doesn't challenge any body part too much, or if you want a medium workout and you have an hour to do it in.  Jillian is one of the better trainers out there, but this is definitely not her strongest workout.",1325030400,,507,4.361702127659575
4716427,4,B005K8QI9E,"I am a huge Jillian Michaels fan.  I did this video for the first time yesterday, so I can't speak to ""results"" (will post back!), but I woke up this morning feeling like I had def. worked out yesterday. Here is a BRIEF comparison of her videos (not including 6 week six pack or No More Trouble Zones, bcs I consider those videos to be in a different category)

30 Day Shred: LOVED and saw bikini body results ( was very careful about what I was eating too bcs I had a vacation on the horizon!).  I will say that I hadn't worked out in a long time when I picked that video up and was so sore through Level 1 I really wondered how I could possibly work out.  This is just as a reference point, bcs now if I go back and do Level 1 Shred, I barely break a sweat. Level 3 Shred used to make me sweat like a maniac, but I never got sore, and although it is still a heart pounder, it is completely doable and I don't sweat nearly as much as I used to. This was my first Jillian Michael's DVD.

RIpped in 30:  Loved this because I REALLY needed a break from 30 Day Shred. But I have to say, for me, even though I was ""resident badass"" when doing 30 Day Shred, there were some moves that I physically could not master! This DVD kicked my butt. And there were some circuits that I really did HATE (mostly bcs they were in her other videos and I was just bored with them. Sometimes because I couldn't do them, i.e. her pushup variations). Level 1 still consistently gets me all over sore if I stop exercising for a week or so and go back to it! And I consistently felt it the day after, through all the levels, after all of the 30 days. I don't ever go back to 30 Day Shred anymore (BURN OUT) and this is consistently good, even if I don't go past Level 2.

Extreme Shed and Shred: FUN because it is so different. Seems like a lot more yoga, and not as much weights and cardio. I'm not a huge yoga fan (I didn't think), but it's fun to be challenged by moves I've never seen. I doubt a little bit this workout's effectiveness though, bcs I really didn't sweat that much and honestly was surprised that I felt it at ALL this morning. But it is fresh enough that I'm looking forward to doing it again, and may even try to find enough time to do the workouts back to back (I have a little one at home, so finding an hour is next to impossible!).

ETA: Did Level 2 yesterday. Holy Smokes! I am sore this morning like CRAZY in my gluteus and pretty much feel it everywhere else as well.  Level 2 was fun and fresh, with a lot of new moves, and def. INTENSE.  A couple of times had to stop to watch what the heck she was doing bcs it was a little complicated, but that adds to the fun for me. I went from thinking ""Level 1 was fun."" to now thinking ""How the H*LL would I do Level 2 after doing Level 1??"" - which, btw, is  good thing :)",1325030400,,2820,4.0
4716428,4,B005K8QI9E,"I received this DVD as a Christmas gift and had to try it right away.  While I wouldn't say this DVD is my favorite of Jillian's, it's still a good workout.  I too tried both level 1 & 2 together the first time I did it.  I didn't think level 1 was that difficult, but level 2 was pretty challenging.
This DVD is nice because it's a mixture of different types of workouts (yoga, cardio, kick-boxing, etc).  Immediately afterwards I didn't feel there were enough cardio bursts, and that there was maybe too much yoga.  However, the day afterwards I found myself more sore in my legs than I figured I would be.
I think this workout will be a nice alternative to rotate in and continue to challenge my body while strengthening.",1324857600,2,724,4.413533834586466
4716429,5,B005K8QI9E,"This is a high impact circuit training workout that can be done by anyone from beginner to advanced.  There are two levels two choose from, each clocking in at around 45 minutes.  Level one is beginner and level 2 is advanced.  However, there are multiple variations provided for each exercise so that this is accessible for beginners or can be dialed up to some crazy advanced moves (and advanced exercisers can string the two workouts together to get a nice 90 minute full body butt kicker).  I tend to like most of Jillian's workouts (with a few exceptions), they are well put together and well cued.  I think this may be her most interesting workout to date.  There are a lot of moves that I have never seen on an exercise video (the ab hold into a plank is brutal).

This workout requires hand weights.  A kettle bell could be used for some of the moves.  This workout is not particularly  easy on the joints because there are A LOT of plyometric moves.  This workout also contains martial arts moves and yoga.  There are moves on this workout that can be made extremely challenging if you are an advanced exerciser especially if you up the weight (ab hold to plank, plank rows with leg raises, single leg mountain climbers, plank jacks, russian twists).  I would recommend this workout for the following reasons. 1.  It is challenging and the moves are effective for increasing fitness.  2.  There are many unique moves that I have not seen before so this is interesting and has some novelty.  3.  The two levels of exercise and the multiple modifications makes this a good dvd to grow with or to challenge an advanced exerciser. 4.  This hits the muscles multiple ways by both training for strength, speed, and endurance (fast and slow twitch muscle fibers).  For anyone fighting insulin resistance or type II diabetes, this would be a good workout to increase insulin sensitivity in the muscles.  The plyometrics will work fast twitch muscle fibers (glucose consuming) and the endurance weight training will work slow twitch fibers (which use fat for energy).",1324857600,4,2067,4.75

I alternate on Jillian DVDs 6 days per week, so I'm in decent shape. Initially I didn't think Level 1 was that tough & was thinking of suggesting it as an ""easier"" one for my friend to try who has just started doing Jill & finding her brutal as a work out. But, a day later I am really feeling it- major burn in my butt, upper arms, wasitline, etc- so I was mistaken & level 1 was harder than I thought. Did Level 2 today & it was great also. As far as calorie burn...I use a heart monitor which is very accurate. Level 2 was 280 calories. I would estimate once I know the moves & can really throw myself into it I may see 320 tops. Best calorie burn so far for me is Burn Fat Boost Metab- about 380- 400 calories- but that is 1 hr start to finish.",1324425600,,915,4.005464480874317
4716434,4,B005K8QI9E,"I just completed my first workout using this video. I did Level 1 and the first 20 minutes of level 2. I was drenched. The exercises were challenging. I am not a fan of yoga, but I like the moves here as I think I can benefit from them. I didn't finish Level 2 because of a time crunch but Im not sure I could have finished it.

I know some feel there wasn't enough cardio, however, I think there is some cardio elements to the non cardio moves as my heart rate got up there quite often. This is similar to workouts Ive been doing already as I am not a fan of traditiona cardio. And like those workouts I believe this will be effective for fat loss and will be in use several times a week.

I didn't do the jumping/plyo moves as I live in a second floor apartment but I still burned about 456 calories in 50 minutes. Ive written down the exercise and plan to do them at the gym so I can get the full benefit from the plyo moves.

4716436,5,B005K8QI9E,"Totally loved this video!  It's a similar format to her other videos - you do five moves and repeat.  It's a combo of cardio and strength.  Weights are really only used in one circuit and you use your body for strength in a lot of moves which I also really liked.  Other reviewers also mentioned the actual moves so I won't dwell on that.  The first section is 33 minutes, not sure what the final was for the second but in the first 33, I burned 312 cals according to my fitbit so I was happy with that.  I truly enjoyed the workout and felt that it went by quickly so thanks Jillian!!  Enjoy!",1324166400,2,593,4.149122807017544

This is a great mix to hit all of you body parts and make you very sore plus cardio. You can add weights which will raise your heart rate and add muscle.  Muscle is a girls fat burner!

4716439,5,B005K8QI9E,"I am a HUGE fan of Jillian Michaels. I love her style of workouts and I own ALL of her DVDs, unless there are some out there that I don't know about yet! I ordered this DVD as soon as it was available for pre-order on Amazon and waited on pins & needles for it to arrive!

As soon as it arrived in the mail, I sat down & watched the whole DVD - Level 1, Level 2, and then the Level 1&2 together option. Wow! I couldn't wait to try it! I did Level 1 on Tues (day before yesterday) and, like a lot of others, I found that it was not as hard as I had expected. Jillian says in the beginning, 'We're gonna have fun with this workout' and she was right! It was VERY different - lots of new moves, a few old moves revamped, and a mix of moves from yoga & various martial arts. It was challenging, but not so much so that it was overwhelming. I thoroughly enjoyed it!

I did Level 2 this morning and...wow...! It wasn't quite as cardio-intensive as some of her other workouts (something that some folks have complained about here in the reviews section) but there are definitely cardio intervals and the strength moves are HARD...VERY challenging! I even found a couple of the static poses to be pretty tough. I usually find myself doing intermediate versions of her exercises; sometimes I can even do the advanced versions. In THIS workout, I was doing mostly the beginner versions. No problem though - it gives me plenty to work toward!

Now that I've done both levels, I'm thinking that Level 1 is probably signicantly easier than Level 2 because she wants us to do them back-to-back. If Level 1 was off-the-charts hard, not many people would do that.

For both workouts, I have to say that, even though they are quite a bit longer that her other recent workouts, the time went FAST!

If I was able to change just one thing about this DVD, I'd like to see different warm-ups & cool downs for Level 1 & Level 2, and a third different (extended) warm-up & cool down for the bad asses who do the Level 1 & 2 together option!

(On a Side note: I was surprised to find that the side plank crunches (in Level 1) were not as hard as I thought they'd be...probably because of those side plank knee raises from 6 week 6 pack, which were really hard for me at first but are getting progressively easier the more I do that workout! Thanks, Jillian!)

All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this workout & it will definitely be a regular in my workout schedule...along w/30-Day Shred, Banish Fat Boost Metabolism, No More Trouble Zones, Shred it w/Weights, Yoga Meltdown, 6 week 6 pack, Ripped in 30, Killer Buns & Thighs, and the Biggest Winner 5-DVD set: Shape of Up Front, Shape Up Back, Full Frontal, Back in Action, and Cardio Kickbox!",1323907200,3,2718,4.338582677165355

I was looking forward to this one, but I was disappointed.  Not nearly enough cardio to suit me and way too much yoga.  Not being a yoga fan and therefore not used to the moves, made this workout difficult and frustrating.  The kettle bell type moves are also ones I avoid due low back issues.

I saw that some reviewers said they thought workout 1 was too easy and recommended doing both 1&2 together (which Jillian also recommends in the video). I've been doing Jillian Michaels workouts for a couple years (No more trouble zones, 30 Day Shred, Ripped in 30) and this workout was really challenging for me! I completed workout 1 the first day, took a break the next, and did workout 2 today. WOW. Workout two has some of her most difficult moves from all her past workouts plus some new ones. I was actually happy to see the 6-count high knees into Burpees after some of the other moves on here, and that's saying something! If you are a true beginner and new to Jillian Michaels workouts, I definitely recommend trying the 30 day Shred or Ripped in 30 videos first and working your way up to this point.

It is a little different from her past workouts, in that, she has a greater variety of exercises and incorporates kickboxing, karate, fusion, and plyometrics. The actual workout is approximately 35 minutes, then she has an extended cool down of about 6 to 7 minutes. You absolutely need the longer cool down because of the intensity of the exercises. I am using  this 3 days a week in the morning and Killer Buns/thighs the other 3 days - can't say enough great things about this!",1323302400,5,620,4.794392523364486
4716449,5,B005K8QI9E,"I got my copy early today (thanks UPS!) so I thought I would share.

I've only done level one of the workout and WHEW, do I feel accomplished.  Jillian begins the video by stating that she encourages you to do both levels of the workout back to back.  She got the side eye from me because that simply wasn't happening, at least the first time around.  I'm quite sure I could work up to it, because this workout is FUN (please note that I generally hate cardio).  I hurled a of couple four letter words at her through out the workout, but never wanted to stop.  Some of the movements are a bit ODD, but I'm not a boxer and I've never done jiu jitsu so it makes sense.  In Jillian fashion, you complete each circuit twice.  Level one ends around 35 mins.  At this point Jillian asks if you want to move on to the next level.  If not, you can finish with a 5 minute warm up.  I previewed level two and there are a ton of new moves.  Level two is about 45 mins if you skip the warm up (same one from level 1).  Jillian adds modifications throughout (So glad to see Basheera back--love her) for higher and lower levels of difficulty.  If you aren't in shape I would imagine that you wouldn't enjoy this workout at first.  If you're a Jillian fan who follows the previous videos, you will love it.

8476576,5,B005K8QI9E,"If you're buying this workout you're probably already a Jillian fan. I am a HUGE fan and workout with Jillian every other day like it's my religion (the other days I usually just run).
This DVD does not disappoint. It's hard! You've got a great mix of cardio and strength, the moves are mostly new or recycled in a way that doesn't feel tired and the DJ is not distracting at all. The other reviewers that are nit picking the production quality...? Don't listen! This is a workout DVD and it delivers. I have two kids and abs because of Jillian michaels. If you want total body that includes cardio and strength and over 40 minutes here is your workout! I have lost over 40 lbs with Jillian Michaels workouts being a major pillar of my success, this workout works!
Thanks for the body Jillian!",1519776000,,793,4.475862068965517
8476577,5,B005K8QI9E,"These workouts are very advanced exercises, you can do them separately, and conjointly. Very effective period! Doing this DVD exercises alone can get you into a very good shape and super fit! Jillian Michaels Rocks!",1517529600,,215,5.171428571428572
8476578,4,B005K8QI9E,"I haven't done the work out yet, but previewed both of them. I'm looking forward to doing it tomorrow and see how it compares to some of her others.  I have her Fast Fix Kickbox, Killer Cardio, and Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism (probably the easiest of the three, although it really isn't easy!) As many reviewers have noted, there are MANY shots of the DJ.  I found it to be funny and laughed when I saw him.  He looks like he's pretending to ""DJ"" and not doing a good job at it, but again, that's why it makes me laugh.  It will be something to distract in a good way!",1515456000,,569,4.1454545454545455
8476579,5,B005K8QI9E,"I meant to do a review on this ages ago, but I never did. I got this at the store when it first came out. I just remembered I had it. I did the workout again today. This DVD is HARD...and that's what I love about it! I love all of the weird moves she comes up with...and they BURN like hell! Workout 2 especially is difficult. If you're up for a challenge, get this. If you're a beginner, this is probably not the workout for you yet. Work towards it, though!",1515024000,,459,4.0
8476580,1,B005K8QI9E,"This DVD highlight everything that is wrong with JM's workouts, and then shoves it in your face. Typically, I can look past her not introducing a move by showing it first. Or forgetting to tell you what the move is before starting it during the second go through. But both of those happen EVERY TIME. And for some reason, this time she thought it would be a good idea to go through all six circuits once before going through them the second time. So you have 20 minutes to forget how to do the move instead of the three minutes while it's still fresh in your mind. And she doesn't give you any time to switch weights if you need to, so for this whole DVD, I was just stuck using my light weights because I didn't want to risk injury or muscle exhaustion by having to use my heavy ones the whole time. And I had to modify a LOT of the moves; I have had to do this to some extent for some of her other DVDs, but this one was the worst.",1510185600,,933,4.048648648648649
