1812000,5,B00007GZZV,"This is a great family film from the Disney Studio. A fun adventure with Dean Jones, without as much slapstick as his other Disney outings. A little adventure, big dose of comedy, with some romance thrown in while a single father has to sort out his priorities.

Jones is an advertising executive that is stuck between an employer who is pressuring him for a jazzy new ad campaign, and being a single parent of a daughter that desperatley wants a horse. He is not to keen on horses, the cost of the riding instructions she is attending, or even the instructor. Of course the instructor (Diane Baker) feels his daughter is a fantastic rider and should actually compete. He is opposed to the extra cost and the let he fears his daughter will have.

Through a few twists, suddenly the 2 needs meet and he not only buys a horse but lets his daughter enter it in shows. But he really does it to promote an ad campaign and figures out a way to have his clients pay for it. Meanwhile his daughter develops a love interest in another horseman, a very young Kurt Russell. And Dad begins to fall for the instructor he hates. Dianne Baker and Dean Jones have a wonderful chemistry.

The DVD version listed here does NOT include widescreen, or remastered, or have any extras, which is a big dissapointment. My VHS version is clean though and looks fresh even though it is also not in widescreen.",1058227200,12,1383,4.50199203187251
1812001,5,B00007GZZV,"Yes, this is a feel-good movie if ever there was one, especially for horse fanatics and even more if you're a horse-loving mother of young kids. This is one of my top 10 all time favorite movies - the leads are adorbable and they used actresses who REALLY knew how to ride (although a lot of the jumping did use stand-ins)  Kurt Russell is a doll too and I just can't say enough good things about this film.

On that point it delivered with a nutty Dean Jones in short pants and fuzzy slippers running from the cops, who think he's a horse thief.  An unexpected delight was the horse show competitions (which had footage of actual events).",1483488000,,335,4.370967741935484

1812099,5,B00007GZZV,"The Horse in the Gray Flannel Suit uses a common component of Disney movies, the bond between people and animals and how their experiences together make them better people.  Fred Bolton, played by Dean Jones, needs an idea that can keep him in his advertising job.  As he sees how much his daughter's identity depends on horse-riding, it suddenly occurs to him that he get a horse for her and name it after the pharmaceutical stomach-quieting pill his advertising client wants promoted, ""Aspercel"".  It is greatly enjoyable watching the horse-riding training and contests that take place throughout the movie, and Dean Jones's combination of relaxed and pushy is perfect for this kind of story, which has a combination of fun and serious issues--a fragile family situation because of a fragile financial situation.  He needs his daughter to succeed in contests with ""Aspie"" in order to keep his job, but the pressure becomes almost unbearable for both of them.  But true to form, as a Disney live-action movie from this period (released in 1968, a tumultuous year in American history, though you wouldn't know it from watching this!), it's quite lighthearted while giving due respect to the serious moments.

Dean Jones did 10 Disney movies in the 60s and 70s from 1965 to 1977.  He's the everyman, and is sometimes amused and sometimes upset, and often borders on both.  The energy he puts forth in some of the scenes where he embarrasses himself is delightful, like watching Cary Grant, in one of his goofier roles, make a fool of himself.  Diane Baker plays the horse-riding instructor who ultimately marries him (he's apparently a widower with a young teenage daughter named Helen; there's no implication that he got divorced), and Jones and Baker's personalities go well together.  I don't think I've seen a single Disney movie from this era of the 60s-70s which has casting that feels wrong to me.  The movie also feels balanced because of Fred Bolton's daughter Helen and a character played by Kurt Russell getting interested in each other.

I feel like there's a special persistent optimism in Disney's movies extending all the way through the 70s that is so refreshing, as every other movie studio was getting darker and sleazier.  This is a favorite of mine among Disney movies because it has that bright outlook even amid very serious issues of identity, purpose, dreams, and how important success is, which the movie takes seriously at the appropriate moments.  Wikipedia says it was generally poorly received by critics and audiences, but if you want my opinion, that is because it was too decent for them in their late-60s cynicism and pessimism, not because the movie has any flaws.  (Likewise, The Happiest Millionaire and The One and Only, Genuine, Original Family Band were late-60s musicals that weren't as well-received as Mary Poppins, owing to the loss of the young demographic--they didn't have magic elements like Poppins--and the change of cultural attitude in the mid-through-late 60s.)  The only movie I've seen come out recently that had the same kind of ""entertaining"" chaos which somehow works out, and is centered like The Horse in the Gray Flannel Suit around unusual career-related things that happen to a family, is Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day, which Disney put out in 2014.  I hope more of that kind of entertainment will come back again someday, with nuclear instead of dysfunctional families and a generally lighthearted outlook on life.  But even though that special quality of wholesomeness has been replaced in recent time by more ""serious"" wholesomeness (dramas instead of entertaining silly movies like this), I am so grateful that we have these Disney movies from the 60s and 70s such as The Horse in the Gray Flannel Suit.",1443052800,,3798,5.011128775834658

It's a good option for families looking for something different than the most current releases.

In addition to just being a nice bit of entertainment, it's full of equine history. The footage of the Washington International Horse Show can be found nowhere else, with the great Kathy Kusner and Aberali standing in for Aspercel. Even the local shows where Helen is shown riding to win her Medals are a valuable window into what horse shows were like in the '60s.

Fred manages to take care of two problems by suggesting that Fred's client, whose principal product is a stomach medication called Aspercel, should sponsor a horse that will gain publicity for the company.

Helen needs to win several competitions to get to a national horse show in Washington, D.C.  Fred fails to be subtle in his encouragement of Helen, and eventually the pressure gets to Helen.  As the result of a humorous horse escape we learn that Aspercel may have more capabilities than anyone realized, and Aspercel has a chance to achieve international fame.

Diane Baker is excellent as horse trainer Suzie ""S.J."" Clemens.  Young Kurt Russell (he was about 17 years old at the time of this movie) is similarly excellent as Ronnie Gardner, who has more than a passing interest in Helen.  Perhaps the only thing that bothers me about this movie is Dean Jones's periodic overacting.  While he managed to express his nervousness, it hardly seems like someone in his position would be so nervous as to be nearly out of control.

Excepting Dean Jones occasional acting lapses, this movie is enjoyable.  Several scenes are very funny.  The end has very nice pacing leading up to the climax of the movie.  Even better, every member of the family can watch this movie.

Watch for the dog named Herbie.  ""The Love Bug"" was also filmed in the same year as this movie.

Enjoy!",1170460800,3,1767,4.7947019867549665
1812268,5,B00007GZZV,"If you like horses and have an open mind (on this older movie) you'll have a great time watching.  The star - a beautiful, extremely well-trained show hunter, has all sorts of great spots in the film and he's in many of the scenes.  He's beautiful to watch over fences and there are many great clips from actual horse shows, hunters and jumpers, including the Washington International.  Humor relative to its age, but fun to watch if you like watching beautiful, top-notch hunters and jumpers.  Also a very good family film.",1168473600,3,524,4.725274725274725
1812269,5,B00007GZZV,"The Horse in the Grey Flannel Suit encompasses all of the ideals and morals of Disney's early days. This film is clean and enjoyable for horse lovers of all ages. Not only have the producers created a great horse film, but a romantically humorous one as well. It has a little bit of everything that each member of the family can enjoy. ""Horse"" stars the likes of Dean Jones, Diane Baker, Ellen Janov, and Kurt Russell. Maintaining a reasonable run time of 113 minutes, the film is just long enough to keep the audience glued to their set until the very end.

 This timeless classic begins by following Fred Bolton, an ad campaigner who is directed by his disgruntled boss to come up with a campaign for the stomach pill Aspercel by the next morning.  Fred, a single father to horse crazy teenager Helen, is feeling the time restraints of his boss and the desperate pleas of his daughter to get her very own horse. Bolton is in the midst of financial woes and comes up with the brilliant solution to get his daughter a horse and name it Aspercel. By competing the gorgeous grey and getting his name in the public's eye, Bolton is able to kill two birds with one stone, that is, however, until Helen decides she doesn't want to compete any longer. Helen's very attractive and very single riding instructor steps into the scene and begins to campaign the horse herself. As the film progresses, father and instructor begin to fall for each other, but there are a few bumps along the way.

 This movie deserves two and half thumbs up. It is written, produced, and acted to the best possible potential. Disney accomplished its goal of creating a great family film free of modern influences that are in many of today's movies. This movie was well worth the effort to create, as it has stood the test of time and still remains true to its morals and can be enjoyed by all.",1165104000,,1864,4.519287833827893
1812270,4,B00007GZZV,"This is not an exercise for the intellect, but a plain, innocent film with the familiar boy meets girl theme done the way Disney used to make films.  There's a refreshing quality to this very non-technological movie with no computer graphics.  I enjoyed the horse-show footage, and it will most definitely appeal to horse lovers of whatever age.  This is not just for the young folks, but for us older folks too. It will cause lots of amusement, and the acting is just right for this kind of a film. This is just right for a break from the violence, and so called ""adult"" garbage that the movie makers put out now.  Sit back and be prepared for old-fashioned fun that everyone in the family can enjoy.",1130284800,17,701,4.496062992125984
1812271,5,B00007GZZV,"Just when a harried New York advertising exec (Dean Jones) finds himself at the end of his rope trying to deal with an impossible deadline for an aspirin ad campaign and his teenaged daughter's (Ellen Janov) incessant demands for a horse, he has an ingenious idea: Get the aspirin company to sponsor a show jumper, one that his daughter can ride. Enter a lovely dapple gray, Aspercel (played by Albarado, who was doubled by Could Be and Sir Winston), a spirited steed who answers everyone's prayers... for awhile. Vintage Disney high jinks clear all obstacles including puppy love, the corporate world, and high stakes horseshow competitions. Based on the book The Year of the Horse by Eric Hatch.

1812272,4,B00007GZZV,"DVD Movies have many great features: great picture quality, making of documentaries, trailers and much more.  However my favorite feature would have to be ""Widescreen"".  So that is why I was so disappointed when I found out this movie was full screen.  I bought this movie anyways, because at less I could replace my old faded VHS tape with superb color and sound and it did.  However it did more than that.  Upon closer comparison I noticed that was getting a lot more picture on the top and bottom and left and right of the screen!!!!  On my 32 inch TV it's about and extra inch and a half more picture around the out side of the screen compared to my VHS tape.  I was overjoyed and delighted by this discovery.  So don't be too hasty in judge this movie if you love widescreen.  Give it a chance it will be sure to please.",1078272000,16,825,4.305194805194805
