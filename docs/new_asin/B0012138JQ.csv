8243446,1,B0012138JQ,It didn't work at all. I think you should identify movies by the name of the country they play in not by the region. I bought one that only plays in Europe because I didn't know what the region meant. Most people don't.  When I tried to return it they wouldn't take it because I had removed the plastic wrap. I didn't know it wouldn't play unt I tried it. This was a gift for a mentally handicapped person. Now I am afraid to order another. Very disappointed.,1454025600,2,459,4.215909090909091
