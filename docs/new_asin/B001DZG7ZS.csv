8295544,5,B001DZG7ZS,"not many italian videos available, so this is heaven-sent. really appreciate the native speaker and the flow of the video. my 20-month-old loves it.",1386892800,,148,5.208333333333333
8295545,3,B001DZG7ZS,It's been really hard to find Italian DVD's for my 16 month year old and this is one of the few we came across.  The DVD is a bit dated and repetitive but my son enjoys it.  Not sure how much he's actually getting out of it.  Only time will tell.,1365638400,,246,3.784313725490196
8295546,3,B001DZG7ZS,"It was ok for the baby, but it is short and very basic. For the price I feel it could have delivered a bit more.",1365465600,,112,3.52
8295547,4,B001DZG7ZS,"This dvd is a good way to introduce the Italian language into my daughters life. She appears to like it, but shes only 6 months old so time will tell!!!",1354147200,,152,4.1
8295548,5,B001DZG7ZS,I think this CD is great for babies who are learning Italian. It has the format of videos who teach babies words  by showing them images with music in the background. Plus it has real Italian speakers in it. My older kid (3 years - already speaks Italian) gets bored with it.,1349568000,2,275,4.288461538461538
8295549,4,B001DZG7ZS,"The video is about 45 minutes long and will play on a loop in your DVD player.  Very basic ideas (a few nouns, verbs, colors, and numbers), which is good for little ones (or even for non-Italian speaking parents), but does include examples of gender/number agreement.  My 1-year old was glued to the TV for over a half hour.  The video images are kids, parents, and pets doing things a baby is likely to see.  All in all, it's a great program, but certainly isn't enough on its own to make anyone bilingual.

I'm finding it really hard to find decent foriegn-language materials for my baby (unless I wanted her to learn Spanish, of course).  If anyone has suggestions, please write about them.",1310428800,7,693,4.59349593495935
