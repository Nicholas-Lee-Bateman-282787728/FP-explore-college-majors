8434042,4,B004LAIU6G,"Kirk Douglas has always been a fine actor, however I wish the company that distributed this package had placed some of his better well known movies in the package. So often you see a collection by a famous well known actor only to have some of their less well known movies in the collection. Seems like a cheap way to distribute the movies. While the movies are his lesser known films it is always a pleasure to see an actor excell at his craft. Something that cannot be said about today's so called actors.",1392422400,,507,4.404255319148936
8434043,3,B004LAIU6G,"Can't decide whether to smile or cry on this one, though I must admit the price is very fair for five movies.

To start on a positive, The Big Trees is pretty good entertainment. It's a kind of a fast-paced, land-grabbing, lumberjack-hustler flick played against the welcome overtone of John Muir inspired preservationists still doing their best to protect our great Redwoods. Enjoyable.

Kirk's first film is on here too, The Strange Love of Martha Ivers. Also, My Dear Secretary is pretty fun comedy with Douglas as a playboy writer who meets his match.

Then we have these European early 70's era produced movies, To Catch a Spy and The Master Touch. I found them challenging to watch, at best, storywise and productionwise, not of the caliber of the other films contained on this DVD. I chalked some of this up to the style of films shot in that era, but then I remembered that there were some fine ones, and realized these two, were just kind of blah.

That said, if you like Kirk Douglas, three of these films, The Big Trees, My Dear Secretary and The Strange Love of Martha Ivers, are all worth a look. The other two, well, that's what fast forward is for.

Enjoy!",1386633600,4,1171,4.583732057416268
8434044,1,B004LAIU6G,Don't purchase this collection.  The transfers are appalling and the quality in general of the films is far below what should be a minimum standard.,1367539200,8,148,4.92
