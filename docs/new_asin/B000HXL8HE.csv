2648946,5,B000HXL8HE,"The best document about the 1977 era London punk scene.  Better than DOA, way better than the Punk Rock Movie.  And, its even better on DVD than VHS.  Widescreen and somehow, it seems better quality (although realize that this is a 1970s film school project that must have degraded somewhat).  The only thing strange is why the VHS has subtitles for the Occasional (and I do mean occasional) introductory sentence in German that are missing here, but that doesn't detract from the film.  Live performances by many artists who were there, except the Sex Pistols (where else can there be any live (in the studio) footage of the Subway Sect anywhere).  Interviews with musicians.  You can hear, for example, Poly styrene and Gene October, among others, discussing the punk scene, the current political/social climate, and their groups.  Damn this is good.",1268524800,9,852,4.99290780141844
2648947,5,B000HXL8HE,"The bonus feature here was worth the purchase price. The Clash live in uncut, static camera shots really show what it was like in the balcony, on the floor, etc. Wish Paul's Bass was higher in the mix. The ladies may appreciate Paul's fishnet shirt. The film itself is interesting in a few spots, with X-ray Specs, The Jam, etc. Some bands like Boomtown Rats are only seen in passing. People who were ""there"" will find this a nice bit of nostalgia. Alas, a bunch of pontification by uninteresting people make the film a slow slog. Nice to be reminded of 70s into 80s hairstyles though! Ugh...",1247356800,10,592,4.542056074766355
8142532,4,B000HXL8HE,"Awesome to see many of  my old punk heroes all growed up, and to get some of their perspective from their experience. A lot of the old songs make a lot more sense after watching this, particularly the Vandals song that plays during the credits, and Pat Brown by TSOL. I always thought TSOL sucked, so I would have really liked to have seen DI highlighted instead, but at least Casie was interviewed. All in all, this is a pretty good movie. The crappy editing and low-quality video are about as punk rock as it gets. That's what it was all about, right? I'm just glad that, although I came into the scene a few years later, I got to be a part of this.",1515801600,,651,4.208
8142533,5,B000HXL8HE,Great vintage footage here! It's interesting to see how actual '77 punk in the UK went down.,1486080000,,92,4.470588235294118

8142536,1,B000HXL8HE,"I guess I just had high hopes for this,it turned out to be a very low budget affair with no real insights into the Clash or Punk in general.",1474588800,,140,3.8620689655172415

8142541,5,B000HXL8HE,"As someone who was one of the few Americans buying albums by
American and English punk bands starting in 1977, I have to agree with
comments on this DVD, it is the BEST of the documentaries about the
English punk scene filmed at the time.
  No, you don't see The Sex Pistols perform ( you hear a couple of
their songs on the soundtrack), but you get to see performances by
The Clash, The Adverts, X - Ray Spex, and other pivotal punk bands,
creating a You - Are - There atmosphere. Loved this disk!",1426809600,2,498,4.231578947368421
