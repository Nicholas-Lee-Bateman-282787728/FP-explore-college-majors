8313339,1,B001JP648C,"A fairly good documentary centered on the cruel realities of animal and human lives. I found 80% of the documentary quite interesting to watch. The remaining 20% left me with a feeling of repulsion and shock e.g. the scene depicting how relatives exorcise the spirit of a dead man from his widow in a certain community.
However, Im giving this DVD one star because of the video quality - the video quality was really terrible, I could not even make out the faces of the characters. My first inclination was to return the DVD to Amazon, but given that it will cost me 20 dollars to ship back to Amazon, I decided to take the loss. I've since tossed it into the bin",1418083200,,663,4.3983739837398375
