2244136,4,B0007TV68E,"Not a bad documentary, but my recommendation would be to rent, rather than buy. I purchased it new for 15 dollars, and at only an hour in length, it feels like there should be more.

The focus is mostly on the larger strategy (troop movement and reinforcement, trench construction, logistics, etc.) with a few geopolitical highlights, so if you enjoy minute battle details or sweeping political sagas, this will leave you feeling hollow. For my tastes, I thought that it was about right. I also enjoyed the extensive war footage and strait-forward style of the narration. I never got the impression that the film was given from an American perspective, and any appearance of this is never as egregious as what can be found on the History Channel.

I agree with another reviewer that this would be an excellent film to show in a classroom setting, as well as for people with a casual interest in this (rather narrow) period of Vietnam history.",1232409600,,942,4.773006134969325
2244137,2,B0007TV68E,"I approached this DVD in virtually the same manner as one of the other reviewers, after having read Bernard Fall's `Hell in a Very Small Place', and came to similar conclusions.  After watching this DVD, you will know almost nothing about the battle, or more importantly, the larger strategic issues from the French or Vietminh perspective that lead up to it.  This DVD should have been entitled `A Shallow, Trite Summary of the Events of Dien Bien Phu from a Biased American Perspective with the hindsight of the Vietnam War'.  After reading Fall's magnificent work, this DVD can only be regarded as a serious disappointment.  No single aspect (tactical/operational/strategic) of the battle is covered in any detail. I didn't really learn anything about the actual fighting other than how the Vietminh dragged their guns through the jungle.  I think that this film also grossly oversimplifies the political situation of the combatants.  There are a few redeeming features of the film (I think that relegating it to the garbage pail is a bit harsh).  First, much of the footage as one of the other reviewers notes is from Soviet/Vietminh films.  It is interesting to see how the Vietminh wanted to see themselves viewed.  Second, an important point made in the film is how the Vietminh transformed themselves from an insurgency to a legitimate army and defeated a modern, Western First World military.  More recent events came to mind as I was watching this film:  the defeat of the IDF by Hezbollah in South Lebanon in 2006.

The bottom line is if you are looking for a cursory summary of the events of Dien Bien Phu from an American perspective (particularly if the goal is to put the Vietnam war into larger perspective) and have no more than an hour to devote to this, you may find this DVD interesting.  Perhaps it would be useful to show to a 9th grade history class.  For a serious student, however, don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed.  This is strictly a watch once DVD (i.e. rent it from Netflix), there is no need to make it part of your collection, you won't be watching it over and over.  If you really want to understand the military and political issues related to Dien Bien Phu, buy Fall's book and spend the time to read it.",1174348800,23,2257,4.719387755102041
2244138,4,B0007TV68E,"I had to respond to Mr. Garnero's review. Yes, the film, at an hour long, is very short on tactical details, but it is strong on the politics and strategic thinking surrounding an important  battle that is given short shrift in American history classrooms. I would highly recommend this film for those classrooms as the perfect introduction to any discussion about the Second Indochina War (America's Vietnam).

2244139,4,B0007TV68E,"The battle of Dien Bien Phu is one of the greatest water-shed events of the second half of the twentieth century.  Not only did Dien Bien Phu instigate the fall of the French Fourth Republic, but ushered in American involvement in Vietnam, contributed to Cambodian genocide of the late 1970s and shaped the foreign policy of numerous nations.  Although much has been written on the battle, little is available in the way of video footage.  Although this documentary fails to explore the intricacies of Dien Bien Phu do, those issues covered give the viewer an idea of the importance of the battle.  Much of the video is taken from the perspective of the Vietminh, but a substantial portion captures the initial days of the campaign, including the first para assault and the early days of construction. In addition, footage of the more famous commanders provides faces to the names mentioned in Fall's Hell in a Very Small Place, and Windrow's The Last Valley, and interviews with survivors of Dien Bien Phu.  In all, the DVD is excellent for those really interested  in Dien Bien Phu, Vietnam, or international relations, but may seem lacking and slow to those who are casual viewers.  I certainly would suggest reading up on the topic beforehand in order to truly appreciate the footage.",1137628800,16,1288,4.8807339449541285
2244140,1,B0007TV68E,"Having previously read Bernard Fall's book, ""Hell In a Very Small Place"", and recently, Martin Windrow's wonderful account of this battle in ""The Last Valley"", I was hoping that this DVD would allow me to get a visualization of those accounts, in a tactical sequence of events, perhaps associated with maps.  For instance, I was hoping to see some of the strongholds and accompanying footage of the associated engagements.  There is very little of this and in fact the majority of the DVD focuses on the political aspects of the conflict.  I think my expectations were to high with regard to the availability of filmed resource.  For the most part, a lot of the battle footage appears to be shot from a Russian perspective, collocated with the Viet Minh. The only way that the terrain is viewed is from a sweeping view of the valley.  There is a complete lack of tactical flow.  I was very disappointed and ended up by throwing the DVD in the trash.",1121385600,36,949,4.652694610778443

failed to realize the documentary is British made and was originally shown in Britain.  Additionally, it was also released in the 1970's when Vietnam was still a fresh event.  So some allowance should be made for the film makers drawing comparisons.

The war brought in millions of soldiers, i.e. Vietnamese, Koreans, Australians, British, American, French, Thai, Filipino and Chinese-and maimed and killed uncounted millions of civilians. In retelling the story of the French defeat at Dien Bien Phu, this movie clearly shows that 20 years before any American ever set foot in Vietnam, the seeds for American involvement had been sown.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Assuming-the-Burden-Europe-and-the-American-Commitment-to-War-in-Vietnam-From-Indochina-to-Vietnam-Revolution-and-War-in-a-Global-Perspective/dp/0520251628/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Assuming the Burden: Europe and the American Commitment to War in Vietnam (From Indochina to Vietnam: Revolution and War in a Global Perspective)</a>&nbsp;After W.W. II the U.S. perceived Soviet expansion as the world's greatest threat. In October, 1944, Mao Se Tung declared the start of the ""People's Republic of China"" and the battle lines were drawn. To American strategists, the Communist victory in China fueled the fear of Soviet and Communist expansion. At stake were the economic interests throughout the Pacific, and U.S. communication and trade links to the Indian Ocean. Then President Dwight Eisenhower (Ike) believed one Asian country falling to Communism would bring down it's neighbors in a ""Domino Effect.""

  Soviet and Chinese power would expand southwards until even the Australian continent was threatened. ""Indo China"" seemed to hold the key to the future of S.E. Asia. The region bordered the newly created ""P.R.C."" (People's Rep. of China) and was still a French colony. French strategy was to hold onto power by creating ""puppet states"" in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. The biggest obstacle to the French plan was the ""Viet Minh"", a Vietnamese independent movement headed by Ho Chi Minh. In Sept., 1945 under Minh, the Viet Minh took Hanoi in the North from the Japanese forces and declared independence for the ""Democratic Republic of Vietnam"". In the South of Vietnam, the Japanese surrendered to the British after the atomic bombings of the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the Japanese surrender. However, France, newly liberated from Nazi rule and shedding it's ""Vichy Government"" subordinate to Adolf Hitler, still considered Vietnam her colony. Let's explore the exact order of what happened, as the following sequence actually caused what was known as the ""First Indochina War.""

During the Potsdam Conference in July 1945, the Allies had agreed on Great Britain taking control of Vietnam south of the 16th parallel,  then part of French Indochina  from the Japanese occupiers. French Indochina was a French Imperialistic term that  encompassed their colonial empire in Southeast Asia.  It consisted of  three Vietnamese regions, ""Tonkin"" in the north,  Annam in the Central, and  Cochinchina  in the south. Included in this empire was Laos as well as Cambodia, formed in 1887. Clearly, the ""Potsdam Conference"" paved the way for much of the future conflict that later occurred. The  conference  was held actually  in Potsdam, occupied Germany, from 16th to July to  August 2, 1945. The Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the U.S. were the participants. Representing them were the Communist Party General Secretary Joseph Stalin, Prime Ministers Winston Churchill and, later, Clement Attlee, and President Harry S. Truman.  The purpose of this conference was to decide how to administer punishment to the defeated Nazi Germany, which had agreed to an unconditional surrender  on May 8th. This was called ""V-E Day.""  Decided upon were the establishment of post-war order, peace treaties issues, and countering the effects of war.

Upon the conclusion of hostilities from the Second World War,  Ho Chi Minh, the future leader of the Communist Party ""Viet Minh,""  proclaimed Vietnamese independence from French rule.  Anti-French demonstrations were held in Saigon, and the Allies became nervous. The British commander, General Sir Douglas David Gracey,  arrived in Saigon in September 1945.  to assist in restoring order and ensuring French subjugation. Gracey led 20,000 troops from India to S.E. Asia  with the purpose of militarily occupying Saigon. Thereafter, France persuaded Gracey's Commander in Chief, Lord Mountbatten to authorize Gracey to declare martial law.  Succeeding in accomplishing this, as well as simultaneously fearing a communist takeover of Vietnam, Gracey decided to rearm any French citizens who had remained in Saigon during W.W. II. He also allowed them to seize control of all public buildings from the Viet Minh.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Churchill-America-and-Vietnam-1941-45/dp/0230298214/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Churchill, America and Vietnam, 1941-45</a>&nbsp;Japanese involvement can be traced to the situation at the end of W.W. II. The U.S., with Truman's approval, dropped an atomic bomb on the people of Hiroshima, Japan on Aug. 6 and one on Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1945.  On August 15, the Japanese emperor Hirohito, realizing the hopelessness of the situation, addressed his people on radio and called upon his forces to lay down their weapons. On September 2, Japan signed the instrument of surrender on board the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay. Three days later, Allied forces .reoccupied Singapore,a Japanese enclave.

On September 12, 1945, Lord Mountbatten accepted the surrender of 680,000 Japanese soldiers in South East Asia. This massive Japanese force was still there in. October of 1945, as fighting spread throughout Saigon. General Gracey decided to use this force to help restore order in the city and issued guns to them all.  This controversial decision antagonized  Ho Chi Minh and made him more determined than ever to liberate Vietnam from foreigners' rule. This precipitated the First Indochina War which was destined to culminate at Dien Bien Phu.  Arriving in Saigon in October 1945 to assume authority was French General Leclerc  By June of 1946, sufficient French troops arrived in Vietnam to allow General Gracey to return with his troops to India where his Division eventually was disbanded. This is how the first French-Indo China war began. In the beginning of the war between the French and the Viet Minh, the U.S. stayed neutral. U.S. officials had originally supported Ho Chi Minh and the Viet Minh and strongly opposed the French attempt to keep it's old colony. However, this was before the Chinese Civil War and the rise of Communist China.

This was a civil war fought between the Kuomintang Chinese Nationalist Party led by ,Chiang Kai-shek (known as the acronym ""KMT"")  and the Communist Party of China (CPC), led by Mao Tse-tung.  The stakes were the control of China which eventually led to China's division into two: the  Republic of China, now commonly known as Taiwan, and the People's Republic of China on the mainland of China. The war began in April 1927, and ended in 1949.. The U.S. strongly supported the KMT, with over 150,000 Marines being sent to China guard strategic sites, and both equipping  and training over 500,000 KMT troops. Furthermore, the U.S. transported KMT forces to occupy newly liberated Chinese zones, as well as to contain Communist controlled areas. To this day, since no armistice or peace treaty has ever been signed, there is controversy as to whether the Civil War has legally ended. Nevertheless,  Ho Chi Minh watched all of these events, becoming increasingly galvanized against foreign interference.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/China-and-the-Vietnam-Wars-1950-1975-New-Cold-War-History/dp/0807848425/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">China and the Vietnam Wars, 1950-1975 (New Cold War History)</a>&nbsp;Now the fear was that if the Viet Minh beat the French, they would open the door to the Chinese and Soviets. The ""Cold War"" had come to Vietnam. The Soviets and Red Chinese recognized the Viet Minh as the ""only legitimate government of Vietnam"" in Jan. 1950.

Red China was giving Ho ammunition, arms and training bases. The U.S. recognized a ""French Creation"" i.e. ""The State of Vietnam."" President Harry Truman approved a program of economic and military help. However, the situation changed dramatically by the outbreak in June, 1950 of the ""Korean War."" Communist Korean Northern forces, backed by Red China and the Soviet Union, invaded South Korea and the U.S. sent troops to intervene. By Oct. 1950 American forces were locked in major battles on the Korean battlefield. Now, the need to contain China existed on every possible front, including Vietnam.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/China-Crosses-the-Yalu-The-Decision-to-Enter-the-Korean-War/dp/0804706298/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">China Crosses the Yalu: The Decision to Enter the Korean War</a>&nbsp;This included a massive U.S. backing for the French in Vietnam. By 1953, one year into the presidency of Eisenhower, U.S. support for the French war against the Viet Minh had turned into a flood of ""Cash and Arms"". The U.S. paid 75% of the cost of the war (1 billion in 1954). Even with colossal U.S. aid, the French were failing to defeat the Viet Minh. Ho's troops now numbered 120,000 hard core troops backed by 200,000 local fighters.

As French casualties passed 50,000, anti-war protests in France were widespread. There were calls for French negotiations with the Viet Minh. Pressure to end the French Indo Chinese war increased in 1953 as the U.S. Korean War ended. However, in the U.S. ""Eisenhower"" and his Vice President ""Richard Nixon"" were dead set against the French compromising with Ho Chi Minh. In spite of U.S. opposition, compromise in Indochina between France and the Viet Minh seemed inevitable. France's hope was that she would win a major battlefield victory and thus strengthen her hand at any peace talks. However, vast tracts of land in Vietnam had fallen under Viet Minh control.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Replacing-France-The-Origins-of-American-Intervention-in-Vietnam/dp/0813193303/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Replacing France: The Origins of American Intervention in Vietnam</a>&nbsp;In Northern Vietnam the only French enclave was in Hanoi. Most of Laos and Western Vietnam belonged to the Communists. The French plan was to create at Dien Bien Phu, deep in hostile territory a fortified base that would threaten the enemies supply lines to Laos. Also, the fort at Dien Bien Phu might act as ""bait"" to induce the Viet Minh to attack with their best troops. France thought incorrectly that the base could be exclusively resupplied from Hanoi by air.

In November, 1953 the Viet Minh 316th Division advanced towards Laos just as the French expected. On Nov. 20th, 800 elite French paratroopers and a battalion of the French Foreign Legion descended by air on Dien Bien Phu.  The Viet Minh reacted by bringing 5 more divisions on the now encircled French camp. The French quickly set up an airstrip and fortifications at Dien Bien Phu. The idea was to mount offensive sweeps into the surrounding area. However, the French were trapped, encircled, and it became suicidal to venture outside. An excellent account of this, albeit hard to find, can be found in Paul Grauwin's ""Doctor At Dienbienphu."" Within 2 months, the Viet Minh pulled ""the noose"" so tight that an extraction from Dien Bien Phu became impossible.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Undetected-Enemy-French-and-American-Miscalculations-at-Dien-Bien-Phu-1953-Texas-A-M-University-Military-History-Series/dp/0890966451/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Undetected Enemy: French and American Miscalculations at Dien Bien Phu, 1953 (Texas A & M University Military History Series)</a>&nbsp;The commander, Colonel Christian de Castries was completely confident that the French could ""break out"" of Dien Bien Phu. He was wrong. He incorrectly assumed that aircraft could resupply all the French bases needs. De Castries also wrongly thought enemy artillery posed any real danger. He underestimated the Viet Minh anti- aircraft fire and incorrectly guessed that only a ""hand full"" of Viet Minh could deploy in the hilly terrain surrounding the encircled base.

De Castries also thought that French air power could destroy any reinforcements to the Viet Minh. Just like the massive U.S. B-52 bombing on the Ho Chi Minh trail during the U.S. war , over 1200 French daily sorties on Viet Minh supply routes had little effect on the Communists reinforcing their own troops. Too often, aircraft were grounded by the weather.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hell-In-A-Very-Small-Place-The-Siege-Of-Dien-Bien-Phu/dp/030681157X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hell In A Very Small Place: The Siege Of Dien Bien Phu</a>&nbsp;Also, the Viet Minh were masters of camouflage, and deployed huge numbers of ""ack-ack"" (anti-aircraft guns). There the Viet Minh commander, General Nguyen Van Giap, used 5000 support troops to deploy more than 200 artillery pieces, anti-aircraft guns and a vast supply of ammunition around Dien Bien Phu. It was one of the most extraordinary feats of logistics in military history. To the 10,000 French trapped inside the base, the realization that they were surrounded by field guns, mortars and Soviet rocket systems came as a dreadful shock. The French base was sited on a flat valley floor.

The airstrip and headquarters were the focus for the main battle position. A complex of 5 strongholds code named ""Francoise"", ""Hugette"", ""Claudine"", ""Elaine"" and ""Dominique"" were set up. To break up attacks, strong points on ""Anne Maire"", ""Gabrielle"", ""Beatrice"" and ""Isabelle"" had been created on a series of low hills. The base was manned by 9 infantry battalions and 2 ""crack"" parachute battalions. For French support, there were French artillery and mortars by tanks and fighter bombers. By March, 1954, 49,000 Viet Minh had been deployed around Dien Bien Phu, with heavy mortars encircling Bien Dien Phu on all sides. Anti aircraft guns were secretly placed to cover the French air routes in and out of the valley. As the weeks went on, Viet Minh artillery fire caused more and more casualties amongst the French at Dien Bien Phu. The fortifications had never been meant to withstand heavy artillery, and the French were horrified to find that neither counter battery fire nor air strikes were able to silence the enemy guns.

They were too well dug in to ""hillside caves"" and bunkers and too well camouflaged. Any day the French knew they would face an ""all out"" attack. It came on March 13, 1954. The Viet Minh assault began with a massive artillery bombardment. French gun positions in the main area were destroyed. In three days after repeated ""human wave"" assaults and hopeless French counterattacks, the Viet Minh took the northern strong points of ""Gabrielle, Beatrice and Anne Marie"" resulting in over 1,500 French killed and 7000 Viet Minh casualties. The Viet Minh proved the French defenses could be overcome.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Angel-of-Dien-Bien-Phu-The-Lone-French-Woman-at-the-Decisive-Battle-for-Vietnam/dp/1591142067/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Angel of Dien Bien Phu: The Lone French Woman at the Decisive Battle for Vietnam</a>&nbsp;The airbase at Dien Bien Phu was closed down for good. The French had to rely on parachute drop only for supply and reinforcement (similarly to the U.S. and their situation during the siege at Khe Sanh during the January, 1968 Tet Offensive). After a two week hiatus, the Viet Minh renewed their offensive. The battle raged for 2 more weeks with the French contesting every foot of ground.

In the end, shocking Viet Minh casualties forced Viet Minh commander General Giap to pause. Meanwhile, the French situation was getting desperate. Ammunition and food were short, and 3000 wounded were trapped in the base in appalling conditions. With disaster looming on the battlefield, the French appealed to the U.S. for help. There was a plan to use American bombers, and even to drop 4 nuclear weapons, which was code named ""Operation Vulture."" President Eisenhower ruled out any military intervention unless other allies took part. None agreed to help. The French were left to their fate.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Operation-Vulture/dp/0743486722/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Operation Vulture</a>&nbsp;Meanwhile, the Viet Minh had adopted new techniques in an attempt to reduce their terrible casualties. They secretly dug more than 50 miles of trenches creeping right up to the French perimeter. The final Viet Minh assault came on the night of May 1, 1954. After a massive barrage, the Viet Minh infantry hit the remaining French bunkers of ""Huguette and Elaine.""

In spite of fierce French resistance, positions fell one by one until the evening of May 6th, 1954.  On that night, a huge mine demolished part of ""Elaine"" and it's last bunkers were overrun. On May 7th, 1954, at approximately 5:30 PM, Viet Minh forces occupied the French command post and the French commander ordered his troops to cease fire. It was 55 days to the minute since the battle had begun. Three thousand French troops had been killed and 8000 wounded. The Viet Minh had 8000 killed and 12,000 wounded. For General  Giap, the outcome had still been a triumph despite these casualties.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DOCTOR-AT-DIEN-BIEN-PHU/dp/B0000CJ9AH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DOCTOR AT DIEN-BIEN-PHU</a>&nbsp;It is too bad that America did not study the resolve of the North Vietnamese to win despite massive casualties or regardless of consequences.

2244148,4,B0007TV68E,"Peter Batty's documentary work is always worth watching. ""Battle for Dien Bien Phu"" is not only no exception, but it may also be his best film.

What Batty succeeds in doing is presenting a strategic overview of his subject that strikes a balance between the big picture and the human details, all framed within a succinct, cause-and-effect historical context--not an easy thing to do in under an hour. This approach provides the viewer with a broad understanding as well as emotional engagement. Perhaps most importantly--and damn rare for a war documentary--he extends this balance to his depiction of both sides of the conflict. Giap is shown as innovative as well as unmerciful. The blind mistakes of the French commanders are revealed along with the tenaciousness of their troops. In short, Batty is uncommonly fair with the principals of his story. This is always the mark of a good documentary: It does not tell you what to think but instead presents the evidence and lets you make your own judgements.

If you are an armchair general and looking for tactical details, logistical info and battlefield maps, then ""The Battle for Dien Bien Phu"" may not be for you. However, if you are interested in a holistic, balanced, nuanced account of this historical event, then watch this film.* After seeing so many two-dimensional, unambiguous and simplistic History Channel documentaries where the constant morality play of the Irrevocably Good forever triumphing over the Eternally Evil runs on a loop, Peter Batty's work is a very welcome change.

And I walked into the bunker, that General de Castries walked out of, to surrender, on May 07, 1954.

So guess I cant get enough of the haunt. This film written by Peter Batty presents the battle from the British perspective. The Brits managed to stay out of both the French and American involvements in Vietnam, and thus have the prospect of a more objective perspective, that I felt was largely achieved. Virtually all the film footage was new to me, and thus of most interest. Furthermore, there was a significant amount of film from the Viet Minh point of view. I have also read&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Indochine-camp-107-Roman-French-Edition/dp/2905969717/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Indochine camp 107: Roman (French Edition)</a>&nbsp;which concerned the efforts of Roman Karmen, a Soviet film director, who Stalin had recruited to film the battle from the Viet Minh perspective.  He is not specifically identified by Batty as the source for the clips on the Viet Minh, or their leadership.

Despite my prior reading, I found that this film brought out a number of new aspects of the battle that I was unaware of; or emphasized old ones. General Navarre, the newest of French commanders, decided to reoccupy the valley at Dien Binh Phu, in order to establish a fortified base for offensive operations at the enemys rear, maybe even to force a set-piece battle where they could be annihilated. Hum. Ah, that Chinese proverb about getting what you wish for.  It was a LUSH valley, with not much thought to why it was so, the 60 inches of rain, that fell mainly between March and August. And how the accompanying low hanging clouds would disrupt a large French advantage: airpower. Hubris v. the weather.

So, the valley would be reoccupied on a beautiful sunny day in November 1953. By airdrop. 11 French soldiers would be killed the first day. The bulldozer was also parachuted in, which re-established the airfield. The planes thereafter brought most everything, including the wine and two field brothels (the film does not show the women, nor note that they were from Ouled Nail tribe of Algeria, that had adopted this profession as a specialty). Two-thirds of the troops were not French, but rather Vietnamese, troops from other French colonies, and the many nationalities of Europe that had joined the French foreign legion. One fifth of the total French forces would desert during the battle, yet remain in the valley, scrounging for food.

As for the raison detre, of reoccupation, the offensive operations, they were abandoned early on. The Viet Minh pounded the airfield in January and February, making resupply more difficult. There is some excellent Russian-shot footage of the work done on the first Ho Chi Minh trail, one of 600 miles, constructed in three months, to bring the supplies from China through the impenetrable forest, to the valley. The Russians provided several hundred trucks that also made the journey. More surprising, at least 200 heavy guns, many of which were 105 mm American howitzers, captured by the Chinese in Korea, were also brought (even knowing about the disastrous retreat from the Yalu in 1950, I was surprised at the number of guns that were captured intact).

What-might-have-been. The film states that 40% of Giaps forces were at DBP, but only 4% of the French forces. If the French had evacuated, and moved quickly against Giaps supply line, he would have been stuck. Could American airpower have saved the day. The film implies that it could, if Congress had authorized it, but seems not to consider that the much larger use of American airpower 20 years later did NOT save the day. 10,000 French would surrender on May 07. Half would die on the route, or in the prison camp, but the film does not bring out the French bombing of the prisoners en route, and thus the refusal of the Viet Minh to allow French resupply that might have saved many of the prisoners.

This is of course about the French ground battle at Dien Bien Phu in the 1950s and yet shows what is obviously an American, probably a  soldier and maybe a Marine (camo helmet cover with jungle utilities), holding a 1960's M-16 and pointing a GI 1911 .45 caliber pistol.  I get that the picture captures your attention but it's not accurate at all if one is to believe this is about a French action a decade earlier than this photo.  When details like this present themselves, I always question the seriousness of the authors/producers when such historically wrong info is presented.  One question - does this DVD mention ""air america"" support for the French?",1397260800,3,789,4.64748201438849
