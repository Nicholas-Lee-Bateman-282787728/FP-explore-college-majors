8271181,1,B000BPFHD4,"I purchased this CD to see how effective Powerpoint is for this purpose.  It does the job.

However the material on the CD is just horrible.  What parent would teach their child to talk about ""bugers""?  The artwork is equally disgusting.  No effort seems to have been put into it at all.

I STRONGLY feel that the other reviews here are inauthentic.  I purchased this product because of the other reviews.  I feel that I have been cheated by this ""author"".",1185494400,,456,4.54320987654321
8271182,5,B000BPFHD4,"i know its supposed to be a kids book but i cant help being a grown up who enjoys being read such excellent stories through the great mystery of computer technology.  also know as powerpoint.

i like boogers and i'm proud of it. thanks to the story on this cd.

honeybee in the second story is pretty snazzy too.",1143158400,,312,4.254237288135593
8271183,5,B000BPFHD4,"Definitely cheaper than a hard covered book.  And it has two different stories on it.  My daughter liked to sit in front of the computer and watch it go for hours and hours.

  very cute stories",1131753600,,194,4.277777777777778
8271184,5,B000BPFHD4,"I found this product first on the MichellesBookstore website where I read the whole story and couldn't not buy it.  When I got it I chose the option of letting it go on automatic on my computer out of the three options.  It is definitely the craziest, funniest story about I booger I ever had read aloud to me off of my computer, thats for sure!  I used the printable version to print it out and then showed the key pages to my friends, like when the booger decides he needs to change his life, and when he is surprised in his house.

  Really fun story, and the free second story on it is cute too. Not about a booger though.

Important note I should mention, this does not play in a DVD player, but on a computer.",1131235200,,715,4.13768115942029
