5670321,5,B00BSVUED8,"Turbo Jam is a fast, fun, and effective workout that combines kickboxing, martial arts, and dance for a workout that will burn up to 1,000 calories per hour! Learn & Burn is divided into two sections. Learn shows you the Elite 11-- eleven separate moves that you will need to master to become a Jammer and move onto the next workouts. Burn is a beginner's workout that gives you a good start by allowing you to utilize what you just learned. The 20 Minute workout is a great way to burn fat fast when you're low on time. You'll enjoy many different forms of kicking, punching, and ab work along with some fun choreography. Turbo Sculpt is a great strength training routine that will help you sculpt and define muscles all over your body. You will really feel the burn with this one! I'm an advanced exerciser and 5 lbs is my max right now with Turbo Sculpt. Cardio Party is a fun, 45 minute workout that will have you sweating in no time. I really enjoy the Turbo portions of the workout. This is when everything goes extremely fast for a period of about a minute. You take a breather and then do it all over again. It really gets your heart rate up. And last but not least is Ab Jam. I already have a six pack that I can feel underneath from doing this particular Turbo Jam video. All in all, Turbo Jam will help you bounce back after a baby or just shed those extra pounds you want to rid yourself of. I'd recommend to anyone looking for a great motivating instructor.",1142640000,34,1470,4.329710144927536

5670325,5,B00BSVUED8,I love this video because the music is fun and upbeat. It really does work. I really enjoy doing this workout. I lost 30 lbs. In just a few short months. I did the workout 3days per week and did not change my eating habits.,1400198400,,223,3.977777777777778
5670326,5,B00BSVUED8,Highly recommend - In the first disk Chalene takes you through the moves at a bit slower pace which is great for me because it takes me a bit to catch on - Then she jumps it up with a kick-butt song with an aerobic quick 20 minute cardio workout - Chalene and members of her team are very encouraging - She also makes the time to show you the proper technique - Her next workout is strength training etc. - there is two disks so you are surly to find something that works for you.,1393977600,,480,4.010416666666667
5670327,5,B00BSVUED8,This workout is full of high energy music and fun. I bought this for my daughter and I've enjoyed it as well.,1388275200,,109,4.0
5670328,1,B00BSVUED8,"I got sucked into the infomercial for this dvd like some others.  I definitely do not recommend it for newbies or anyone in fact.  Chalene is extremely annoying.  She is a 40 some year old woman trying to act like she is an 18 year old hip hop artist.  Instead of instructing properly she is more worried about trying to be ""cool"" and make sure she is using the correct slang.

I have used many different dvds and this one is horrible.  It lacks instructions on moves which will actually injure your back if not done properly.  Along with the lack of instruction she does a lot of the moves too fast.  I had to rewind multiple times to try and figure out what she was doing and how to do it properly in order to not hurt my back..... rewinding doesn't help with that.  I even did the video to learn the movements a few times and once I got to the actual workouts I was still lost and could have hurt myself if I already didn't have the proper athletic background to know when I am not in the correct form.  There were times I didn't even do the movements because I knew it wasn't the correct form and I could not figure out how in the world they were doing the movement so fast without hurting themselves.  Even the women doing the low impact moves were doing it so fast there was no way it was proper form.

I do not recommend this dvd series.",1386460800,,1344,4.166666666666667
5670329,5,B00BSVUED8,This is the best workout series ever.  I have been using these tapes for 5 years and they helped me get my pre-children body back and keep it.  Now my 16 year old does the fire series with me.  LOVE Charlene!,1385164800,,208,4.024390243902439
5670330,1,B00BSVUED8,"I ordered the Turbo Jam Beachbody 5 Rockin' Workouts CD. Happy to try it but was disappointed. The CD was sticking, jumping, pixelating and even the talking sounds and the lips don't even add up sometimes. I decided to log on to beachbody.com to speak with someone online and the person barely even took me seriously. Basically he wants to know what I want him to do about it. I asked how to get the CD replaced for a good CD so that I can work out and not stop every time. I guess the customer support is not good at beachbody.com.  So I have a CD that I paid 42USD for at Amazon that is not working properly. I even tried the CD on my good CD player but barely any change.  I am an unhappy customer. Very very unhappy.  I don't know if the CD is old or new, I just don't know what to think or do! The workout is good but I cannot get the CD to play properly so that I can exercise. When you spend your money you want something good that you can use right away, not having problems to use it.",1383177600,,993,3.979899497487437
5670331,5,B00BSVUED8,My favorite workout of all time and I have tried many different trainers and workouts. I never seem to get bored with Chalene's workouts and the time just flies by. She actually does the workout from start to finish with you. I have had wonderful results with this program. It took me a couple weeks to get the moves down but after that it was easy. My coordination has improved a great deal. I have bought all her videos in this series and have not been disappointed.,1381968000,2,468,4.390804597701149

5670340,5,B00BSVUED8,"Im a personal trainer and martial artist and I love these workouts. I don't really do the weight lifting portion, but the cardio is super fun.

5670344,5,B00BSVUED8,"Upbeat, and fun! I am the most uncoordinated, klutz. It took me about a week and a half to get the moves right. Once I had it, I was rocking it out.  I bought my set used for $13. what a deal!! I got my beginner schedule off a search engine (that starts with a G). I followed it, and bam! Within 3 weeks of doing 20 minute workout, and Cardio Party-I was getting results. I can feel the changes. I am more toned, and stronger. It's exciting, since I did Tony Horton Power Half Hour for 5 months before.

It can be a demanding workout if you go directly to this. It could be done, just go slow. The abs workout is a little dull, but did make me ache after. Chalene pumps you up at the right moments ""you're doing great"" and ""keep going, I know you can do it!"" she's amazing. I mean, r4eally when you're 44 and have had two kids, with a smoking body like that? Yep. So buy it, check used, you won't be sorry!",1375920000,3,906,4.0

When I began, I followed the modified instruction lead by Mindy and Annaria and added some mods of my own to keep my heart rate up and I just had a lot of fun with it. After a while, it stopped feeling like a work out.  So far, I've lost 60lbs on the program.  I love it!",1375315200,2,359,3.9583333333333335
5670347,5,B00BSVUED8,"I love turbo jam because it is fun and easy to learn. If you are new to fitness or you have tried others, gotten bored, then given up, try this! It really does combine mostly kickboxing, dance, and capoera. You do not need any prior experience in any of these to pick up Turbo Jam. I followed the workouts as instructed but did not follow the nutrition guide. Overall, I am pleased with my results and fitness improvement. I highly recommend it.",1375056000,,445,4.439024390243903

5670351,5,B00BSVUED8,This dvd is a lot of fun to workout to. My son likes to do parts of the workout too. The beginning workout has instructions for doing the moves. The short beginning workout has you pouring sweat by the end of the 15 minute routine.,1374624000,,231,4.155555555555556
5670352,5,B00BSVUED8,I am so glad I ordered this video.  I still have not adjusted to the speed of some of the moves and whether I go this way first or that way but it is an excellent workout.  Definitely worth it!,1374451200,,193,3.8

5670356,1,B00BSVUED8,"I got sucked into the infomercial for this program two years ago, paying something like $70-$90 for seven workouts. I didn't even open one DVD because I was disappointed with this one, and in the two years I've had it, the only one I use is Ab Jam, which is okay. She's not a terrible instructor, but she is hard to follow. She never counts, which makes some of the exercises difficult because you have to constantly watch the screen to follow along. My biggest complaint, however, is that her aerobic exercises seem chaotic and confusing, mostly because she hardly ever repeats any of the moves. She often does an exercise once on the right, once on the left, and then she is on to something new. I wish she would repeat the moves at least eight times so that I feel like I get some kind of benefit. In the first six months, I tried the aerobic workouts many times, but I always felt like I was still learning the moves. Not enough repetition.

She is not the worst instructor. My favorite is Gilad, but I have never found another instructor I like. I guess this one is the best of the rest.",1373155200,,1092,4.352941176470588
5670357,1,B00BSVUED8,The cheesy commentary and lack of instructions with exercises made it difficult to follow along! I'll stick with Shaun T!,1373068800,,121,5.1
5670358,5,B00BSVUED8,I love the turbo jam series.  This exercise video has two discs but 5 workouts on it.

Chalene has a funny personality and you can tell the people in her videos enjoy taking her exercise classes.,1372377600,,292,4.576923076923077
5670359,5,B00BSVUED8,"This is a good workout for everyday use.  It actually has five different workouts included and all are very user friendly.

5670360,5,B00BSVUED8,I do Turbo Jam every day. I bought it years ago when it first came out. I loaned it to a friend and never got it back. I recently bought a used one and I feel like I came home.

The workouts are fun and not too long. They are just what I am looking for. I want to work up a good sweat and get my heart pumping but not feel like I'm going to have a heart attack or feel like I am counting down the minutes till the workout is over. You won't get the weighted gloves or band, but if you have light free weights at home you can just use those.

I tried it, it was okay but i went back to my other dvds, zumba and brazilian butt life. it was advertised at the end of the brazilian butt lift dvd so i tried it.

5670366,5,B00BSVUED8,"I am a huge fan of Turbo Jam.  If you are a beginner/moderate exercizer looking for something to get you motivated this is perfect!  Chalene is so awesome - she keeps the energy high and makes things fun.  I love the music and how its choreographed along with the moves.  Also all of the ""crew"" in the background are great.  They smile a lot and seem to be having so much fun.  I have lost about 20 lbs doing Turbo Jam.  I would recommend for beginners to watch the Learn & Burn before starting.  Also, I do have to say BE CONSISTENT once you get going.  There is a workout plan that comes inside the booklet - follow it.  You work up to doing Cardio Party 3x a week, Turbo Sculpt 2x a week and Punch, Kick and Jam on Sundays.  If you stick with it and do it everyday you WILL see results.  If you are advanced (you already workout quite a bit) I would recommend Turbo Fire.  I have to say though that even if I work up to Turbo Fire I will always love Turbo Jam.

Its pretty much just like that class but I don't have to worry about messing up in front of everyone. High energy, not very dancy. The songs are dated but its still fun. I did find that Chalene's cues were a little off. She does cue but its kind of late. Once you get used to it it isn't so bad. High intensity, low impact. You will sweat! You will become addicted!",1365638400,,517,4.078431372549019

I have tried so many different workouts: slim in 6, insanity, 30 day shred, fat boost metabolism, 30 day extreme. You name it and I have tried it, but I ALWAYS come back to Turbo Jam!!

She didn't go wrong when she made this series!! Can't wait to get my TurboFire to go with this! I'm almost 4 months in and 32 pounds lighter! So glad I was introduced to BeachBody...

5670375,5,B00BSVUED8,"I purchased a used copy from Amazon back in January for around $20.  I wasn't sure if it would work.  I'm a 37 yr old mother of seven children under the age of 14 and needless to say, I could not seem to make exercise a priority.  I was pushing 165 after my last little baby, and I was inbetween a size 14 - 16 and growing.  Neither size fit me very well.  I just couldn't take the weight off after my last two babies, and each day I could see the pounds add up more and more.  We didn't have the money for  a treadmill or gym memberships, and it's been too stinkin' cold to take my babies outside for walking in the stroller.  I needed something I could do at home while my youngest two slept during the day.  I wanted to see if I could loose any weight before summer came around.  I started doing these exercises, along with a few hip hop abs (we purchased those years ago and just didn't get into them) ... mostly turbo jam... Just anything to keep moving for around 45 minutes a day.  I started drinking TONS of water.  I reduced my dinner portions, opting for no seconds, and I greatly reduced my sweets.  I LOVE milk, but I also cut it down to two or three SMALL glasses a day (the hardest part).  I don't even take supplement drinks.  I EAT NOTHING PAST 6 PM.... ONLY WATER.  It has now been about two months and I have lost 10 lbs.  I am comfortable, nearly too loose,  in a size 12 and last night for fun, I pulled out my old size 10s and tried one on!  They were still a little tight, but I could zip them up!!!  The love handles are nearly gone.  Now the fat is coming off, and my clothes are fitting so much better!  Now, I need to focus on getting my abs back into shape.  After 7 babies, well, they just aren't the best looking right now.  The AbJam portion (2nd half) is a killer!  It is my new goal to try to accomplish.... My husband and son liked laughing at me when I first started..... WHO'S LAUGHIN' NOW!!!!  Now, my husband is increasing his water, reducing his portions, he has stopped eating late and night, and is telling me now that perhaps he'll start doing some of these DVDs!  This has been wonderful!  Thank you Turbo Jam!

UPDATE:  4 1/2 months later.  I am now nearly 25 lbs less and in a size 8!  This has been great!",1364256000,8,2250,4.101149425287356

The energy is great, the workout is effective, and the music and entire experience are a good time.

I would highly recommend this to ANYONE who wanted a fun, dance workout - and like Chalene says you can do all the moves w/out your feet leaving the floor.

I liked the fact that you knew exactly when the segment was going to end by the timer in the corner.  I also enjoyed the tutorial in the beginning when she goes in great detail about the moves that you will be doing. That alone made me sweat a great deal. There are also people on there that she points out will help you modify the exercises if you need to. it is somewhat dancey but that is part of the fun that makes this video stand out from other exercise videos.

5670395,5,B00BSVUED8,"I have owned this workout dvd for several years, and I have yet to find a better total body work out dvd than TurboJam: 5 Rockin' Workouts by BeachBody.  Chalene Johnson is very cheerful and encouraging throughout all of the workouts she leads. Her instruction overall is easy to follow, and she uses enough variety to keep the work outs on the interesting side.

  The five work outs vary in their focus so that you get a mix of strength building and aerobic exercise.  The shortest work out which follows the excellent ""Learn and Burn"" instructional segment of the basic moves, is approximately seventeen minutes long, but still an excellent total body workout that is both aerobic and strength building on the beginner to perhaps intermediate level.  This was the workout that helped me start losing some weight and that strengthened my body overall after not exercising for years. I really felt the ""burn"" when I first started using this work out. I am now at a veryhealthy wait although greatly cutting down on sweets was my most effective tool at weight reduction.

  I have not done all of the 40 minute aerobic work out on this dvd because it seems a bit harder to follow and because the shorter total body workouts on this dvd (17 and 20 minutes ) are intensive enough for my needs especially if done daily.(I found minor ways to intensify them myself as I got into better shape).
The set includes a non-aerobic strength building work out that uses weights for about half of the work out.

  Although I did modify a martial arts capoeira step in one of the work outs to make it feel better to me as I used it, I have found the exercise movement used in Turbo Jam:Five Rockin' Workouts to be on the fun side, safe, effective and at under $40.00, a good value.",1357948800,3,1767,4.556962025316456
5670396,5,B00BSVUED8,"It is a fun set of exercises. I really liked that I didn't feel exhausted at the end of the workout, but still felt the effect on my muscles and overall feel. Would definitely recommend it, especially for someone just starting out.",1356566400,2,231,4.523809523809524

I like the bonus abdominal though, you see results by the next day.",1356220800,2,345,4.428571428571429

During this workout I was easily confused and a step behind (admittedly, that's my own coordination issue), and while I got a good sweat, I just didn't feel like my fitness level was increasing.

I am nearly done with the first 28 day program and am heading into the 2nd 28 day advanced program. I use this EVERY morning according to the schedule book and follow her meal plan as well. She is fun, the music is fun, and it is challenging! She keeps you wanting to push play every morning and let me tell you if I can do it anyone can! I have lost weight and inches steadily in the last 28 days...which is enough to get me out of bed every morning at 4 am to do it! I highly recommend getting the whole kit...DVD's, weighted gloves, and guide book. I can do all five of these workouts and I was nowhere near fit, have bad knees, and painful hips!

As far as the workouts ? They are super fun. ITs great that you can decide which one to do (the 20min if you're short on time, or 45min if you want to tone up as well, or the AB jam to add definition to your abs). The music for each workout is great, it keeps you going and going and going. YOu forget you're working out, literally. And Chalene is just great at keeping you motivated. She's funny, silly and doesnt have a ""shoot me now or shut up""voice while you listen to her, as other DVD trainers I have experienced with (i.e P90x or Jill Michaels).

Definitely worth $20, all the way.",1350432000,,698,4.17037037037037

5670411,5,B00BSVUED8,"I really did like this workout!  It had great 80's music to work out to and she was very motivating! She made this video lots of fun where you wanted to do it.  She also has it sectioned off with a little progress bar on the bottom so you knew how long you had to go.  She incorporates rest time, water break, and cool down time. She has about three different levels to choose from; each being a little different and more challenging than the last one.

  Here's what I had problems with. I had a back injury over 20 years ago that gives me problems if I do the wrong things. Workouts have to be very structured and not lose, or I will be laid up for two weeks.  She is a little loose on her routines, meaning this: she is trying to throw together moves in an order that can be challenging on your spine the way that she twists. She doesn't keep it all in line like Billy Blank's early Tae Bo.

  After a couple of months of trying out this dance jam, I ended up having to give it away because I just wasn't physically able to do it without hurting myself almost every time. However, if I didn't have back problems, I probably would have been able to do this one and had a lot of fun doing it!",1348099200,,1193,4.05982905982906

I quickly progressed to the 20 minute workout then then 40 minutes ""Cardio Jam.""  Now I can switch between all workouts depending on my energy level and time constraints.  I love that even if I'm short on time I still benefit from the quick 20 minute workout so I have no excuses to not exercise.

I lost weight immediately without changing my eating habits.  (although, that could be because I don't have bad eating habits) I have been doing it for almost 4 months now and I still sweat like crazy, get winded, and notice changes in my body.

The music is great, the workout is fun, and it is hard. Once it is no longer hard you can move onto Turbo Fire and Turbo Kick.

5670430,5,B00BSVUED8,"I have tried many workout/infomercial videos and most of them do work but I really dread doing them.  I tried 30 day shred and got great results, but dreaded doing it every single day.  I also am a fan of mari windsor pilates, but that is very repititious as well...SO after hearing so many positive things about beach body and reading all of the reviews on turbo jam I ordered it.  I let it sit on my TV for two weeks before starting, but I started Monday (today is my 4th day) and I love it.  Its challenging, and I sweat a LOT, but it is also a lot of fun...the twenty minute workout is over before I know it.  The video is broken up into segments which helps me get through it mentally....when I see that I only have 4 minutes left in the segment as opposed to the entire twenty minutes I know I can get through it.

The cardio party is a 43 minute workout and you're moving the entire time...but again, its fun! I was sweating and panting, but I didn't feel miserable or want to stop.  After doing all of the workouts I feel amazing.  Chalene is a great coach, she does each movement one time, then does it again to make sure you got it.  She also stressed to do what you can and not push yourself...

Im 25 and have really allowed myself to get out of shape and gain a lot of weight.  This is only my first week, but I am really going to stick with it to see the results I know I can get.  The people on the workout tape are of all different sizes, they are all in shape, but everyone is different which is also encouraging.

I will come back next week and add my results for two weeks of the tape, but as of now, I feel great.  I have a lot more energy and I look forward to working out.  Although I do not see any physical results yet, I can really feel the burn while im working out and for the few days after...

So, if you dread working out or really don't feel like doing exercise some days, this is a great product...there are 4 different video options that you can follow a schedule to, or mix it up and do what you like...either way, I recommend it!!!",1337212800,3,2066,4.064197530864197
5670431,5,B00BSVUED8,Im hooked! Although I do love Turbo Jam its a little outdated. So Im going to use this for a while and then upgrade to TurboFire.,1336435200,,129,4.0
5670432,5,B00BSVUED8,"When I first purchased, it gave a three week window in which my order would arrive, but it showed up in three days!! Super fast! Also, when I purchased (used) it was still in good shape! I'm super excited and have already used it three times.",1335916800,,242,4.282608695652174
5670433,5,B00BSVUED8,"First off, let me just say that I've always disliked cardio, definitely a bigger fan of strength training. I've never found something that I want to stick with. Enter into my life Turbo Jam. May of 2011 I was tired of seeing everyone else with amazing success from their workout programs. I'd weighed the most in my life at 164 lbs and I was ready to change. I suffer from digestive trouble as well as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.

I opened Turbo Jam the day I got it and did the Learn and Burn DVD. This is where she shows you the basic moves, then there's a short workout after you learn the basics. At the end of the half hour or so, I was on the verge of vomiting and I wanted to give up right away.

Fast forward to almost a year later. Turbo Jam is my go-to workout. When I'm not sure what to do, I pull out the DVDs and weighted gloves and get to it. With TJ, I lost 13 inches over my body and lost probably about 16 lbs.

Starting out, it wasn't easy. It's technically a beginner workout, but I wasn't used to doing cardio like that. I grew to love it obviously.

The 20 minute workout is one of my favorites. It gets you moving, sweating it's affective. Ab Jam was killer to me at first. But it got easier along with everything else and I grew to look forward to it. It's ten minutes standing ab work and ten minutes on the floor. The floor part was really difficult but it's pretty fun. Cardio Party is 45 minutes of kicks, punches, and squats. As I mentioned previously, once you get into the moves, the weighted gloves are an added bonus. Turbo Sculpt was really boring to me at first. It's a lot of slow moving, low weight resistance work. Even that grew on me after a while and I learned to enjoy it to an extent.",1335484800,,1724,4.152694610778443
5670434,4,B00BSVUED8,I love the turbo sculp session. It s the only one I use because the other ones are too difficult for me to follow because they switch moves as quickly as they start.,1335312000,,165,4.03030303030303
5670435,5,B00BSVUED8,I love it ....i love it..... :-) This is a greet workout .... An i live in Denmark but i can still use it :-),1334534400,,109,3.4
5670436,5,B00BSVUED8,"Yes, Chalene can seem like she is not genuine but guess what? Her workouts work. This was my first attempt at kickboxing & I fell in love. I am glad I tried Turbo Jam first because it made working out to be such a fun & enjoyable part of my day. Never thought exercise could be this fun. I had to give this set to friend and she also loves it. This is probably among the most enjoyable workouts in the whole world, you get results if you put enough effort. There is no magic here.",1334275200,,480,4.010416666666667
5670437,3,B00BSVUED8,It's a nice workout. I don't understand why on the cover it says the 'ab workout' last 40 minutes when it's just about 20 min. long. The work out is ok but I don't see any news compared to Tae Bo (by Billy Banks) which is a workout that was popular in the 1990s. It's basically the same! It's also difficult doing a workout like that without a trainer: if you do it in the wrong way (arching your back or finding it impossible to engage your abs the way she explains in the dvds) you are going to hurt your back or not seeing results at all!,1332979200,,541,4.018518518518518
5670438,5,B00BSVUED8,"First off, let me say I love, love, love Turbo Jam! I have all the DVD's except Fat Blaster and Cardio Party Live Remix. I did Turbo Jam religiously for about 8 months before I got married and lost a total of 40 lbs...then I got married In September of 2008 and was pregnant by that December! I crept up to 215 lbs. from being 160 lbs. during my pregnancy and I had a 8 week premature little girl! A lot of bad food choices on my part during pregnancy:(. Anyways, I got down to 209 after my daughter was born in July of 2009. By that December I was down to 191 lbs. That's when I decided to get back out my Turbo Jam DVD's and get to work because I knew that they would work for me like they had before. Starting out at 191 lbs on December 1st, 2010, I now weigh 164 lbs and it's February of 2012. I still have a goal of being down between 140-145 lbs. I could do Turbo Jam everyday and I practically do, my issue is trying to eat better. I promise you if you do these workouts religiously you will reap great results! I honestly love all the cardio workouts, you honestly feel so great after doing them and the music is so addictive!",1330041600,2,1134,4.044444444444444
5670439,2,B00BSVUED8,"I was looking forward to this ""turbo"" workout...however, the second CD was distorted and very low audio.  She really didn't move me with the workout but was very upbeat.  I didn't return it because I don't work out to the same thing all the time so by the time I decided to check out the second CD, it was too late to send it back.  So I had to keep it.",1329955200,,353,3.943661971830986
5670440,5,B00BSVUED8,"I love turbo jam! In the first week my love handles were pretty much gone! I mean there is still a little, but certainly do not have a muffin top!:) I feel so energized after every work out. I feel so much happier too, not just because my body is looking more of how I want it to, but because I feel like I can do anything! Thank you Chalene! I tell everyone about Turbo Jam! Some people think her videos go too fast but just do it more than once and you'll catch on. Also, if you listen to the music she uses it to lead into a lot of things and that always helps me. Get up and try it! You'll be happy you did!!",1329350400,,612,3.826771653543307
5670441,5,B00BSVUED8,I received the Turbo Jam DVD as promised still wrapped in the shrink wrap and could not be more happy with it.

The music is good..the moves were easy to learn and Chalene is very enthusiastic but not annoying. I love to get motivation by looking at the cast. They give it their all, and so do I. By the end I am sweating buckets! Right now I do it 3 times a week and I can already see small changes in my body. It's a great 45 minute workout, and I am a plus size girl!",1328918400,3,449,3.6391752577319587
5670443,5,B00BSVUED8,"I LOVE Chalene Johnson!  I purchased this DVD set about 2 years ago after being diagnosed with high cholesterol and pre-diabetes.  I'd been a couch potato for about 25 years and had never stuck to a workout program in my life.  I ordered this DVD set after reading mostly positive reviews and fell in love with it.  I stuck with the workouts for 2 years until graduating to ChaLean Extreme this January.  I went from a size 14+ to  10- and still dropping.  My blood pressure is normal, my blood sugar is normal (I have also been eating clean) and my cholesterol is normal!  I have cute little muscles in my arms and got my waist back!

I can't comment on the Cardio Party (aerobic) DVD's.  I have an ankle problem and can't do the dancing without injury.  My weekly routine consisted of 2 Turbo Sculpt workouts (40 min ea.) using 5 lb dumb bells and 2 Ab Jam workouts (20 min ea.).  I also walked 2 miles 4 times a week.  The sculpt and ab jam workouts can be as easy or hard as you make them.  In the beginning, I didn't use any weights and my squats were about 2 to 3 inches deep.  Later on I graduated to 5 lb dumb bells with deeper squats and then moved up to 8 lb dumb bells.

Even though this was my exclusive workout for 2 years, I never got sick of Chalene.  I love the way she pushed me to give my best, but it in a positive way.  No yelling here, just upbeat motivation.  I also loved the music.

I wouldn't suggest this workout DVD for hard core athletes.  If you've done P90X, Insanity, or ChaLean Extreme, this workout might be too easy for you.  The Cardio Party may be right for a good cardio burn, but the Sculpting and Ab Jam DVDs are more appropriate for beginner to intermediate athletes.",1328745600,3,1707,4.219814241486068
5670444,5,B00BSVUED8,"This is an amazing DVD. I have other Chalene Johnson DVDs,the one I love the most ChaLean Extreme, as well as two Turbo Jam live DVDs. Chalene is a great instructor, she does not get annoying and keeps you motivated throughout the workouts. In this DVD you have two workouts that are 20 minutes each, which I love for busy days. Another which shows you the moves as well as a 15 workout and then a two more intense 40-45 minute workouts. In this DVD she's not always great at telling you whats coming next but after two or three times I got the hang of it. You will sweat if you work your hardest! I would recommend this DVD!!",1327190400,,626,4.225

Unless you enjoy bobbing around and shadow boxing for 30 mintues, I would only recommend this workout to people who like to dance and have only started their fitness journey. Then again some of the moves actually look dangerous for the joints. Glad i didn't spend money on this. If you are in decent cardio shape, use insanity instead. I dropped 12 pounds in 2 months using insanity. I am disappointed in this workout. I was really excited that a woman was coaching a HIIT workout, but this has nothing on insanity. Really, this is the lamest workout ever. Im not sure why there are so many good reviews. I seriously doubt that you would see any noticeable results with this.",1320796800,3,767,4.605839416058394

5670462,5,B00BSVUED8,"I first got Turbo Jam in 2006, after getting really depressed and putting on about 30 pounds in 6 months following Hurricane Katrina.  Within 6 months of doing the different workouts on these DVDs, I lost about 40 pounds (back to my high school weight!), had TONS of energy, got back my 22"" waist, and moved past the depression.  While I do have a dance background (ballet, tap, and cheerleading), I also suffer from systemic rheumatoid arthritis.  Even so, I was able to perform almost all of the moves without needing modification, and it was nice seeing just how I should modify the ones I couldn't do.  A lot of workout videos aren't really helpful showing what to do if you have limited range of motion or joint problems.  Chalene is very inspiring, and just from the DVDs made me WANT to succeed, do well, and keep working out.  The music is very much not my taste, but it is perfectly synched up to the moves, and keeps the energy high.
At first, I followed the recommended calendar for exercises, but after a while, it became just about maintaining, and I'd do whatever workout fit best in my schedule.  I've also been alternating with Zumba classes at the gym, Sweating to the Oldies, and The Firm, just for some variety.  Still, my favourite is the Turbo Jam.  I always come back to these workouts, and even though they have gotten much easier as I've gotten stronger, there are always things I can do to increase the difficulty for those good days, and yet still keep it pretty low impact to protect my joints.  I've managed to maintain my weight/figure into my 30s while eating pretty much whatever I want and despite being on medications that really mess up metabolism.  The reason I've been able to do that is this workout is FUN!  I actually look forward to getting home from work and popping in one of the videos, or starting my day with one and having irrepressable energy for hours on end.  My doctors are amazed at my physical condition and strength considering how extensive and advanced my arthritis is, and I credit both my figure and my mobility to Turbo Jam.

I've done both the Cardio Party and the Ab Sculpt so far, and they are both really fun. In the Cardio Party, the music is great, but some of the moves are hard to catch on to. However, if you do it more, you'll get accustomed to it better.

Chalene looks a lot younger here than she does in Turbo Fire! I could relate the Cardio Party to Turbo Fire, because of the Turbo Mode about halfway through. Chalene gets my energy fired up, and makes me want to come back and do it, just because it's fun!!!",1312761600,,722,3.8716216216216215

I strayed away from this particular workout but recently came back to it. In just a few days I've already noticed a difference in my physique and energy level. I highly recommend this workout. My only caution is to take it slow at first and I also suggest watching the Learn and Burn section first.

5670471,5,B00BSVUED8,"I just finished my first workout. I did the Learn and Burn. I LOVE how she has a whole section to learn her moves. I did it then the burn section and it was pretty easy to follow. I did ""mess up"" a few times but I will get it in one or two more times. I will probably do the Burn section and then abs or strength next time. And then if I'm good I'll move on to the other sections.

I was sweating a bunch and it was fun. She tells you you don't have to be perfect just keep moving and you'll get it soon enough.

She will guide you through the first set but doesn't repeat herself with every rep, which is nice. It would get so annoying for her to say every single move every single time you did the work out.

I do have a dance background but I don't believe it was too hard for someone to learn. I'll try and remember to come back on here in a few weeks and give my progress.

If you are more spontaneous, love to dance, and catch on quick to choreography, then I'd go with Turbo Jam. If you are more of a straight forward, bar none, two left footer person then I'd recommend Taebo! If you are like me and you fit both categories, then alternate between the two. But Billy has my heart so I'm sticking with him as my main guy! Love Turbo Jam, but the cueing on the 20 minute and 45 minute workout could IMPROVE!

I use this program and turbofire to supplement my regular tkb workout at 24 hr fitness.  There are days when I am lazy to hit the gym and do a full hour workout or i just needed a short workout to perk me up before school and this is it!!! I rarely like a home fitness program because nothing beats the gym class atmosphere, but charleen is so motivating and she really kicks your butt. bottom line, you'll get results if you do this consistently.",1309132800,,547,4.20952380952381

I have seen results in two weeks using these workouts everyday with one day off a week, with out changing my dietary intake.  It took me two tries to completely finish the Cardio Party, the third time I just realized that I am still a beginner and I had to take it down a notch.  I recommend this!",1308182400,,361,4.114285714285714
5670477,5,B00BSVUED8,"I saw this workout at my local library and thought I'd try it out. At first I thought it was a little cheesy, but decided to give it a try for at least a week. I did the Learn and Burn and learned all the moves, then did the 20 minute workout...it got my heart pumping, sweat going, and I felt like I had a great workout! Then I tried the 45 minute Cardio Party...wow. That workout is definitely more intense, and I loved every minute! The Ab Jam is great. I liked the mix of standing and floor ab work. I haven't tried the Turbo Sculpt workout yet, but hear it's great for resistance and strengthening.

The moves are a mix kick boxing, martial arts, and dance. They are all easy to learn and effective. Another great feature is the time bar at the bottom. It lets you know how long each segment will be and gives a brief title of each. There are people doing modified moves which is very helpful for beginners. There is a turbo alarm that sounds off about 3/4 of the way through and it's 1 1/2 minutes of intense cardio...this is my favorite part! You do a few high-cardio moves that really kick it up a notch. And I like that the instructor adds in a water break. Many DVDs don't do that so you have to stop the DVD or skip a move to pause for water. Lastly, there are short segments in the workouts that are called ""recovery dance"". This is like 10-15 seconds of just doing whatever you want. Whether you want to shake your booty, jump up and down, or just step side to side...it gives you a chance to get funky or take a quick breather!

Chalene is very energetic and keeps you motivated. I didn't realize how much I liked kick boxing until I did these workouts. I thought the music was cheesy and outdated at first, but now I find myself singing along and really get into the rhythm. And I'm noticing a huge difference in my stamina, strength, and energy level. I've been shedding the pounds and having fun at the same time! Although I have many other workout DVDs, I find that I keep going back to Turbo Jam...it's addicting!",1307577600,2,2032,4.261658031088083

5670485,5,B00BSVUED8,"I have had this workout system for a few years now. It has been collecting dust, and I have NO IDEA WHY!! After doing everything else, instead of what I already had,.......... I dug it back out. When I first got it years ago I could only do it a few times a week, and now i am doing this 6 times a week!!(I take Sundays off) Keep in mind I only have been consistantly doing the 20 min workout(5 min cooldown), I am short on time but would like to work up to the 45 min ones a few times a week.
When you do the punches, you can feel it right away, because you have to use your entire body to throw a punch,to throw a punch properly,so you will see results pretty quickly too. I don't trust the scale especially when you are adding so much muscle, but the proof is in the pants when you put them on and they feel different and they fit different, and your shirts and even your shoes. Not only is that sublte difference obvious within the first few days, so is the endorphin boost you get all day. Any tension you have is outed because you worked your butt off! On top of which the hard work, reduces my apetite and helps me stay in a pretty good mood all day.
I recommend doing this workout early in your day becasue of the positive affects but also because , if i do this late at night I am charged with energy and find it hard to go to sleep,but you all may find that it knocks you out! Either way, it is fun and it works! There are countless you tube videos of before and after users, the proof is there.

5670488,5,B00BSVUED8,Turbo Jam is the best workout ever.  It is fun to do because of the music. You also have the learn and burn which is helpful if you are new to Turbo Jam.  I have tried the other workouts on the DVD but the music does nothing for me.  The cardio party music is what gets me smiling and dancing and is my favorite aspect of Turbo Jam!  I just ordered Cardio Mix 2 and will probably get 3 next week.  I am a 38 year old mother of two with no rhythym however this DVD keeps me moving and I feel like I can dance.

5670491,5,B00BSVUED8,"I have been using Turbo Jam for roughly two years. Prior to that time, I was looking into a work out routine that I could do at home simply because its less distracting for me and I can focus better. A friend told me about it, and I looked it up, ordered the first dvd set with the two disc's, and gave it a try. It was hard at first, but once you get the core movements that are key to Turbo Jam down, it becomes second nature to you. It's easy to learn, and even if I don't do it for a while, I don't forget the moves. I have bad genetics as far as weight gain go, my mother is heavy set, both my sister and I, an majority of the women in my family gain easily, and its not fun at all. But since using Turbo Jam, I notice the following changes within at least two weeks:

My figure becomes leaner, and shapely

My posture improves greatly, and I carry myself better over all

It works off every area gradually and tones it down where I want it. And even better, it keeps the excess weight off.

I recently ordered the Fat Blaster because my sister did, and told me to give it a try, and I did. But it is only 30 min, and much much more fast paced. I'm still trying to get it down. But I mostly do the Cardio Party Mix 1, which I love doing, and its simple, and effective because it works all the areas that I need work on, especially the lower body like hips etc.

Turbo Jam is awesome. And I always recommend it to anyone I can who is looking for something fun and easy to learn and do. I love Turbo Jam, its fun, and easy and I don't feel silly doing it. I may look into the other Cardio Party mixes, but for now, what I've got going on is working great, and results come over time with dedication and effort.",1298851200,3,1713,3.953623188405797

It seemed haphazard and unrehearsed.  Chalene is energetic, fun and  encouraging.  Her cueing is right on and she never gets ""lost"".  The cardio is what I saw on tv fun and high energy.  But the sculpt took me by surprise.  I thought it would be more of the same but slower and more concentrated with a few abs added in.  It was totally different but in a good way!  Some light weights and some burning moves made me feel like I really worked each major muscle group.  Love it!!",1297209600,3,647,4.153225806451613

This is not for someone that likes dance routines and moving around alot and punching and kicking. This DVD requires a lot of movement! My favorite part of this DVD is the AB Jam. This is a 20 minute AB workout that is totally awesome! It starts with ten minutes of standing AB workouts then ten minutes of sitting or laying down AB workouts. While I was doing this I didn't notice too much of a burn. It was the next day that my abs were really sore.

The music is really good, not the typical kareoke versions of songs that are on most workouts.  I actually have found myself singing some of the songs to myself later in the day, wondering what song it was, and not realizing it was from the morning workout.  The moves are great, they go well with the music.  The ab moves are amazing, you will see results quick.  Like any workout dvd, there is a learning curve to the combinations, but after a couple times, you won't even need the cueing.  It also has a great feature that allows you to turn the cueing off, I wish all dvd's would have this feature!

The overall feel is so upbeat, and yes, more like a party than a workout (I know, I know....cheesy.  But true!)I feel like the workouts are over almost too quick, because time flies by.  This is the dvd that showed me you get what you pay for.  Yes, there are tons of workout dvds by famous people that you can get for $10 just about everywhere.  But, they are a waste of money because they are cheaply produced, crappy workouts that were put on the market quick to capitalize on the person's fame. (yes, even the ones that are from famous trainers)  I've bought them before, and never used them.

I am the customer and if i see something suspicious going on, I will ask questions.

I am so mad right now I can't see straight.  I was really excited about starting P90X in November, but I refuse to use this company every again.  I am scared to death my installemnts won't get credited now and with all the horror stories I am seeing now about this company, if I won't still keep getting charged for products I don't own.  What is wrong with this company? I thought they cared so much about their customers. Or was that just smoke and mirrors to get more money.

STAY AWAY from this COMPANY!!!  If you can order their products from anywhere else do it!!!  TRUST ME their FREE products they promise you--ALL LIES!!!  Example. I just ordered Rockin Body and Hip Hop Abs!  I was suppose to get two free workours per product.  Oh I got them alright but they are on the SAME DVD as all of the other workouts. So if you return the product...your ""FREE ITEMS FOR JUST TRYING US OUT""...go back also. They give nothing for free!!!

So look at the item descriptions on beachbody and search for the product on Amazon or EBAY or anywhere else.  I just don't want to see any more innocent people get ripped off by this company.

5670520,5,B00BSVUED8,"I ordered this product to help me get back into shape and to add more cardio into my routine.  After researching this product online and reading such great reviews, I thought I would give it a try.  Needless to say, the reviewers were right, this is a great product.  Turbo Jam exceeded my expectations.  It is a fun, effective workout that I look forward to doing every day.  I actually get upset when I have to take a rest day because I love it so much.  I've been using workout dvds for over 10 years and I was former Firm devotee, but nothing on the market in my opinion compares to Turbo Jam in effectiveness and motivation.  I can honestly say that I could see changes in my body after using this program for two weeks.  Since purchasing this product I have ordered other Chalene Johnson products, including Punch, Kick and Jam, Cardio Party ReMix.  However, Turbo Jam is my favorite.  I recently started Turbo Fire, which is the next level of Turbo Jam and I've incorportated Chalene Extreme for weight training.  In 3 weeks I have lost 7 pounds and an inch off my chest.  Some of my pants already need altering.  I am a Chalene Fan and a believer in Beachbody products.  You definitely won't be disappointed.  By the way, I have injuries in both knees. I modify as needed and I am still getting great results.",1285027200,5,1317,4.451882845188284

5670522,5,B00BSVUED8,"Turbo Jam is perfect for someone who doesn't like a conventional workout and wants something fun that will get them moving.

I cannot stand cardio machines. They're so boring and repetitive. With Turbo Jam, you learn the routine, repeat it a few times, and then move on to the next one. It's impossible to be bored! Chalene, the instructor, is super sweet and fun and very motivating. I've been doing these (along with the Elite package with more DVDS) for about 2 months now, and I still love them!

That being said, even though you'll get plenty sweaty doing Turbo Jam, it's not the most intense workout in the world. If you want to lose weight, make sure you're eating well too- don't use the fact that you're exercising as an excuse to pig out. I've lost almost 10lbs since starting Turbo Jam :)

I highly recommend Turbo Jam for someone who needs a little motivation to start getting active or for someone who just wants a change from a conventional cardio workout. Good luck!",1282780800,2,981,4.594285714285714

Wanted to start it up again after baby #2...I gave mine to a friend while I was pregnant...and she loved it and wouldn't give it back!  ;)

Anybody that ""tries"" TurboJam and says it didn't work for them...they didn't try hard enough, long enough, or they were doing it wrong!

*Any exercise program will give you results if you dedicate yourself to it daily.
*If you burn more calories than you take in, you will lose weight.

TurboJam keeps me coming back for more...and that's where the results come in!

In the meet and greet section, the short dumpy girl(sorry I can't remember her name) says she's been doing the workout for 2 years.  She seems to be working hard in the video, but seems a little chunky if she's really been using this video for two years.  It's a bit of a problem for me.  It makes me wonder...  It's okay to be healthy and chunky, but if you're mainly advertising DVD's as a weight loss plan, why put a fat girl in with no explanation of why she's still overweight after two years.  I'm just saying.

This is like a weight watcher leader who keeps gaining and losing large amounts of weight but keeps being the leader.  Success to me is losing it and keeping it off within a reasonable range.",1280793600,2,778,4.273972602739726

5670527,5,B00BSVUED8,"When it comes to being fit and working out, I am about as lazy as one can get.  I would rather do almost anything rather than work out.  One day, I realized how out of shape I was when I became out of breath just by walking a long distance up hill.  I'm not overweight or anything either, just out of shape.

I decided to do something about it.  I hate gyms, so I ordered some of Denise Austin's videos, and while I liked them ok, I lost my motivation to do them.  They also weren't very long and I didn't feel like I was getting in better shape. Later, I saw the infomercial for Turbo Jam and decided that maybe this would be more motivating.

Boy was I right! I instantly liked Chalene.  I was skeptical from other reviewers who said she was motivating because I find it so difficult to become motivated to work out. But she really is! I find myself laughing and enjoying myself during the work outs.  I've only been doing the workouts for a couple months, but I've noticed a significant difference in the shape I'm in. I feel better, and have lost 8 pounds. Last weekend I went hiking and kayaking with my friends and was worried I was going to have trouble.  But I easily kept up with them and my arms didn't even hurt after kayaking for the first time!

The best part, and what I view to be an extremely rare thing for me to say, is that I actually WANT to work out to the videos every day. I think they are hard workouts (especially for me, the beginner).  My abs KILLED when I did Ab Jam for the first time, so I know these videos work. I highly recommend them.

Also, I just ordered Turbofire to try something new, and am really excited about it.",1280275200,5,1654,4.17981072555205

I've been doing Turbo Jam for over a year now and I definitely see some changes in my body.  I love to have fun while getting a great workout.,1279843200,,461,3.8105263157894735

5670533,5,B00BSVUED8,"I've been using P90X but wanted a different cardio workout.  This workout is very fun, and let me tell you, you work up a sweat.  For me the hardest part was getting the choreography down, but after doing each workout a couple of times, I knew what to do, and really started enjoying it.  The music is fun, Chalene's personality comes off the screen, and I love the fact that when we are working our left side she is working her right side so we are mirroring what she does which I think makes learning the moves so much easier.
Once you learn the routines you have the option of turning up the music and not hearing her, but I'm not quite there yet.
Anyway, I recommend it.  You will need some hand weights for the sculpting workout, depending on your fitness level, anywhere from 1# to 10#.

I purchased this set when it first came out in 2005, I had just had my first child and was NOT happy with the body it left me with.  Chalene helped me get  up off the couch and get motivated to make a change.  I like how she gets you to learn a routine by building on the moves you did one step at a time and then switches to the other side.  I never felt like I was lost or not picking up the sequences.  I look forward to my time with Turbo Jam, even six years and another child later.  Although I enjoy the cardio party very much, nothing gives me that satisfying burn like Turbo Sculpt.  So 100lbs later (50 per child), I can say that this workout series is fun and motivational and  you will lose weight and enjoy every second of it!",1275436800,,794,3.943396226415094

If you already have the first set of Turbo jam, don't bother. Beachbody is coming out with a new Chalene workout called Turbo fire this summer.

Charlaine really mixes it up so the ""repetitive"" squats just sneak in and you are done before you know it. You won't even find yourself doing the same mundane pre and post workout stretches (I think I appreciate that most of all). The 40 minute cardio and 40 minute sculpt workouts are great, and the shorter 20 minute cardio is wonderful for those days where time has slipped away.

5670565,5,B00BSVUED8,"So far I love all of the workouts I have from Chalene. Turbo Jam was my first and it is a great way to get into cardio and even a little resistance training. There are three main points why I really love this product.

1. FUN
For me actually the most important point. You can tell that Chalene and her gang really like each other and have a lot of fun working out together. The music is awesome compared to similar products (once you have the workout down there is even an option to crank the music up and turn down the volume of Chalene explaining). So the whole ""vibe"" is just positive, motivational and her version of Ashton Kutcher's Punk'd (which is called Jam'd :-) where she plays practical jokes on her friends is just funny.

2. PROFESSIONALISM
As funny as Chalene is, you never have the feeling that you might get when let's say a model or actress brings out a workout video... you know, the feeling that this person might not really know what she is doing? You can really tell that Chalene knows what she is doing and that she has a reason for every move she shows you. You get 5 workouts plus an instructional video. Two of the workouts are about 20 min to get to know the thing, the rest is really hard (but good) stuff (one workout even with optional weights).

3. COMMUNITY
The producers have managed to create a community online that can encourage each other, share experience and just talk about what they are doing workout-wise at the moment. It gives you the feeling of being part of a global gym... for less money and - yes - less effort. I like that.

Turbo Jam is a great way to get in shape and have a good time with family or friends. And for all men out there that think it's just for girls... I dare you to get this product and repeat that after 45 min of the Turbo Sculpt workout :-)",1261958400,,1810,4.2682215743440235
5670566,5,B00BSVUED8,"I used to be a light runner (2 mi/day) until my knees started bothering me too much I had to stop and thought of other ways to get my exercise. So I researched on a fun exercise DVD and I tell you, I love Turbo Jam by Chalene Johnson because it's not that long (from 30 min-45 min workouts) and it works. I fit in my size 4 jeans, I look good in cute clothes and friends were noticing something different about me. Anyway, I love them so much I decided to venture on to other exercise DVDs to vary my workout and perhaps incorporate dance-oriented routines, so I hoped. I saw Shaun T's Rockin' Body in youtube and amazon and was convinced and so I bought a used copy. After doing the exercises within the first half an hour, my knee problems started to kind of come back (I forgotten I even had knee problems!) and I had to slow down and eventually stop. Even following the low impact girl on the video didn't change the discomfort I felt in my knees. I now wonder how safe Shaun T's Rockin' Body is with preventing knee injuries to those who have yet to have knee problems. There was constant twisting on the knees, putting weight on them and jumping as fast as you can and they put quite a pressure on the knees I think. Overall I'm sticking with Turbo Jam for workout and might just do  Rockin' Body once a week or something since I have it in my possession. Also I noticed Shaun T. in Rockin' Body doesn't do all the reps with you (and with his crew). He often stops and checks out individuals in his crew essentially taking breaks himself from doing the rep. Not fair! And because he's not with it all the way he can't tell when the reps are starting to really burn, warning him not to add anymore too many counts. His crew feels the burn (you can see it on their faces) and YOU feel it at home but Shaun T's kind of detached. You gotta burn with us, Shaun T just like Chalene Johnson does in Turbo Jam! Chalene's with you all the way and thus knows when it starts to burn painfully! Also, I like Chalene's stretching exercises afterward, they vary and they really hit the spot. I can kick higher and am generally more flexible these days. Just some things I observed comparing my Turbo Jam with my Rockin' Body DVD.",1260403200,2,2221,4.250591016548463
5670567,1,B00BSVUED8,"I researched the Turbo Jam series for a while before I decided to buy one dvd from Amazon, as opposed to buying the whole series from Beach Body. I read several positive reviews so I purchased the DVD with the 5 workouts--Learn and Burn, 20 minute, Turbo Sculpt, Cardio Jam, and Ab Jam. When I received the dvd I watched each workout first. Many reviews had mentioned Chalene's cuing--wow it is AWFUL. I am used to Cathe Friedrich and her excellent cuing and professional instructing. Besides that, I think what bothered me even more was the other exercisers doing the workout. There is one in particular, Mindy, who is on Chalene's left who does the low impact version. She is constantly mugging and searching for the camera, making silly faces, etc. It's bad. I actually can't believe they would produce this dvd and not preview it first, because I am sure they would have told her to cool it. It is distracting and the bad thing is the camera is constantly panning to her. It is like this in every workout. So anyway I am going to return this and try to get my money back, because half way through the workout I couldn't wait for it to end. NOT for me.",1258761600,10,1155,4.452830188679245
5670568,5,B00BSVUED8,"Workouts are fun and energetic! They take a little getting used to, but once you get the basic moves down - it's pretty fun. The trainer is great and you can tell that she is just having a great time.",1258329600,,200,4.025
5670569,5,B00BSVUED8,I love this workout series... to date I have lost 45pounds and 6 dress sizes... and picked up some great dance moves along the way.,1257897600,7,131,4.28
5670570,1,B00BSVUED8,This DVD is damaged and doesn't work properly.  I would love a replacement or refund!,1257206400,,85,4.666666666666667
5670571,5,B00BSVUED8,"I'm a 38 year-old female and have been using Turbo Jam as my exercise routine for the past 3-4 months and the results are definitely what's motivated me to keep going.  I will admit that I was a bit intimidated at first, only because I felt like a total spaz.  I stuck with it and picked up the routine of each workout around the 3rd time.

CARDIO FITNESS LEVEL:  When I first began, I could not even make it through the 20 minute routine without stopping, but gradually I would do 50% low impact and 50% high until I increased to totally high impact.  I always used the weighted gloves that were included with the set.  I've recently switched to 3lb weighted gloves and the sweat has increased.  As promised, the more you do the cardio, the quicker your recovery time.  I remember wondering if I would ever make it through the ""TURBO"" portion of the workout, and then when I finally did, if I would ever recover to finish the rest of the workout.  Again, just stick with it.

STRENGTH LEVEL:  I love, love, love the strength training portion of this - Turbo Sculpt.  I've always been strong, just not very fit.  I was able to begin with 5 lb weights for a good workout.  My biggest challenge was completing the lateral raises during the 2nd portion of the video.  Once I was able to complete the workout comfortably, I switched to heavier weights.  I am now working with 8lb weights.  I enjoy this portion so much I am seriously checking out the Chalean Extreme series that Chalene Johnson has put out.  I can do the Turbo Sculpt alone, but for an even greater workout, I'll do the 20 min. workout (without the cool down) and then switch to the Turbo Sculpt (without the warmup).  When I combine the two, my heart rate stays up and I pour sweat.

ABS:  The Turbo Sculpt has an ab portion at the end and there is also a whole workout (Ab Jam) devoted to abs.  Ab Jam has 10 minute standing work and 10 minutes on the floor.  All your cardio routines have some portions of that really work your core which works your abs as well.  I've had three kids and have some serious stretched out skin in the abdominal area.  I wish to have a six pack, but the reality is, I can work my abs all I want but until I have a tummy tuck to remove said excess skin, the results will be nothing worth showing off.  That said, I still do the standing portion of Ab Jam but not the floor work, as I detest floor work.  I do see definition in my sides (obliques?) by just doing that.

WEIGHT LOSS:  I was disappointed when my scales didn't show the weight just flying off of me.  In fact, the whole first month I gained weight.  I did however notice the waist of my pants getting more and more loose.  Two months in, I had lost 13 lbs and I've now probably closer to 19 lbs, but I have had to quit looking at the scale and measure by my clothing size.  When you begin, you start building muscle which adds pounds (muscle weighs more than fat), but muscle is a must if you want to burn calories.  Also, anytime I switched to heavier weights, the weight loss would either slow down or go up.  My arms look awesome - major definition in my shoulders, arms and back.  My legs began tightening up and are now showing definition.  Core and glutes are def. toned.

When I first began, I didn't watch my diet as much.  Once your drenched in sweat day after day from working out, you really begin to evaluate what you put in your mouth.  It's like, ""I'm sweating my butt off for this?""  It's like the exercise and cutting back went hand in hand.  Once I started regularly putting for the effort to work out, I put forth the effort, to push away from the table.  I've also quit drinking any carbonated beverage except one diet soda per week.

When I began, I was bursting out of a size 14.  I'm a tall, athletically built girl anyway, but I was really sick with myself for getting this bad overweight.  Of course, a sickness that included 3 rounds of steroids orally and w/shots didn't help any.  I am just now getting into a size 10.  They're still a little snug, but by golly, I can button the button!  I've always felt comfortable when size 10's fit well, but I think I'm gonna go for 8's before trying to maintain.

ROUTINE:  I work out 6 days a week.  I combine the 20 min workout w/Turbo Sculpt on Mon/Wed/Fri.  The other days is one of the cardio workouts (I really like the Punch, Kick, Jam) and rest on Sunday.

OVERALL:  I really like this product and have suggested it to many of my friends.  The instructor is great - perky, encouraging but not over-the-top.  I love the countdown timer.  For some reason, when you see the end in sight, you manage to keep going.  The members of her team on not super-model wanna-be's, they're real people of all different shapes and ages.  THE MUSIC IS GREAT!  I love the music in this series.  It's some you probably know (the roof is on fire - I'm gonna knock you out, mama said knock you out), sung by different people, but still very upbeat that makes you want to move.  I hate the MUSAK crap you get with other sets.  There is an option where you can play the music pumped up, that is where you can here the music louder than you can hear the instructor.  I know the routines well enough that I now choose this option.  I have bought some other of her cardio routines to mix it up some.",1256515200,7,5306,4.277945619335347

I first started out slow, but I have now fallen into routine and look forward to working out five times a week Mon-Fri. On sat and Sun I just go for some power walks. I cut back a little in my eating, not a lot and I found that my size 10 jeans are now fitting. I had been bumped up to a 14 in jeans. I am so happy.

I wanted a good way to work out inside (when I couldn't go running), a fun way, and Turbo Jam didn't disapoint me!!
Charlene is fun, motivated, sincere, and what I like  the best is that you never have to touch the floor doing crunches.
The workouts are flying by, and I am having so much fun, that it is always easy to do it again and again! :)",1254355200,,472,4.130434782608695

5670583,5,B00BSVUED8,"I received this dvd set 2 weeks ago and I have been doing it religiously every single day!!! (I also have Fat Blaster, Live Booty Sculpt + Abs, and Kick Punch and Jam!) It's a great workout, and I sweat so much more than I do at the gym. I find myself really pushing myself with these workouts. For reference, I am really fit, about 5'4"" 119lbs and I take pilates 3 times a week, do some elliptical and running here and there, but I am always ready to do my TJ workout every night. Even when I feel like crap, I put this DVD in and the opening music gets me ready to workout. The only downside is my quad muscles are becoming HUGE! I need to maybe do this 3x a week instead of 7 :P Once I'm doing it, I get so into it, and afterwards I feel very good about myself. Here's a breakdown of my reviews for each workout:

Learn & Burn: Very helpful, learn the moves straight off the bat and work up a sweat right after. It gets you excited. I did this on the first day and it got me excited to do TJ the next day. Only had to do this once since I've taken a lot of cardio kickboxing classes. It's easy to follow!

20 Min Workout: Great when you don't have a lot of time! Downside is there is a lot of uppercuts in here, I was hoping for more variety like in Fat Blaster, but nonetheless you still burn calories and have fun. There's even a Turbo in here! I usually do this workout with Fat Blaster, Ab Jam, or Turbo Sculpt.

Turbo Sculpt: I love this workout! I use 2.5 weights so I don't bulk up too fast, and I sweat like crazy within the first 5 minutes. I've never used weights like this before and time FLIES. All the moves are original and you'll get a great inner thigh and arm workout with this one.

Cardio Party 1: Amazing cardio workout. My mom takes kickboxing, zumba, and spinning, and she says this is the best workout she's ever done. It feels good and works out all your muscles. I love all the Turbos and fun moves here. I don't like all the lunges but hey you gotta do what you gotta do, that's just me! I sweat more doing this than running 3 miles on a track! I especially love the cool-down. The music is awesome and the capoeira moves are fun + a little bit like sexy workout dance moves. 40 mins of fun in this one.

Ab Jam: My abs are burning after this one. It says it's 40 mins long, but it's only 20 mins long- 10min standing ab workout and 10min mat ab exercises. By the time you get to the floor exercises, your abs will be burning! Use this with one of the cardio workouts and you'll get great results.",1250812800,,2526,4.054108216432866
5670584,5,B00BSVUED8,"I've tried tons of other workouts and while most exercise videos do what they are supposed to do, Turbo Jam is the ONLY one that is so much fun to do that I don't feel like it is a chore.  I lost 35 lbs with it a few years ago and it is awesome.  I only did the first Turbo Jam video six times a week and the 20 minute one when I was in a rush.  Even on days that I felt sluggish, I'd hit play and started getting motivated as soon as the warm up began.  The only reason I stopped is because my cd got scratched, but after trying about a million other workouts, I am going back to the original Turbo Jam and purchasing it again.

Yes, the routines are a little hard to follow at first, but once you have it down it is part of the fun.",1250553600,,734,3.7712418300653594
5670585,5,B00BSVUED8,"Great workout! Let someone borrow this DVD then moved and never got it back. So...I knew what I was getting. High energy and no situps! Once you learn the moves, you are good to go!",1250035200,,181,4.2
5670586,4,B00BSVUED8,"I absolutely love this workout DVD.  I have never been a fan of workout DVDs; the last one I liked before this was the original Tae Bo (on VHS!).  I had tried some on-demand things and pilates DVDs, but nothing was really both a solid workout and FUN, which was what I needed, since I was lacking the motivation to go outside and run.  Turbo Jam was so much better than I expected!

Honestly, I think Chalene is like the perfect instructor -- now I'm not the quickest learner, or the most coordinated, but after a few runs, I was able to follow her just fine.  It seems people complain about her cueing, but I only had an issue with it my first 2-3 days with the DVD (I assumed it was because it was new to me).  I've been doing the workouts for about 2 weeks now, and follow 95% of Chalene's cues (even when I vary the workouts).  I think you just have to get used to it!

I enjoyed the learn and burn, and for those first learning days, combined it with the 20 minute workout in order to get myself situated.  When I was doing those easily, I moved onto Cardio Party, which I think is great.  Love the music, and break a sweat within the first 10 minutes every time.  Even if you don't want to ""bust a move,"" Chalene's doing so will also make you smile.  She's sweet and fun, and I find her positive energy really motivating.

I was a skeptic, even though I read such positive reviews.  I haven't ""lost inches,"" like some others claim to have done within days (granted I'm 120 lbs), but I'm also not controlling my diet like I should.  I don't think TJ works miracles, but I do believe that combined with a modified diet, like most workouts, you can get great results.  The difference for me is that I actually ENJOY turbo jam.  It's honestly fun!  :)",1250035200,,1753,4.244712990936556
5670587,2,B00BSVUED8,"I was into this dvd less than five minutes and had to turn it off. What a waste of money for me personally. I had a difficult time with the routines in general because she was going to fast, but also because if you aren't familiar with the moves and proper form how are you supposed to go from one move to the next? I also thought it was really cheesy and didn't feel like it was a serious video for me. I guess looking at the commercials on it, it looks fun, but there really is no instruction and you have to take time to get the moves down to really do the workout with everyone on the screen.",1250035200,2,596,3.975

5670590,4,B00BSVUED8,"Over all this is a good workout and I would recommend it especially for beginners. I do however have some issues with the over all package. The gloves that come with it are too small even for my wife's hands and would not fit an average guy at all and sand leeks out of them. I bought wrist bands that do the same thing. Also the menu/meal plan that is supplied with the package deal is worthless. Although I lost 12 pounds in the first week, (my wife lost 6), the meals tasted bad and waited many ingredients using only a small portion of 1 avocado (as an example) with no use for the rest of it. The meal plan did not tell you how many Calories or grams of fat or why you were eating what when and why. It was unsustainable from many aspects mostly taste and cost. My wife and I found a free site called ""[...]"" and have had a lot of success regulating our diet using its calorie counter program.

Another thing to be wary of is the ""Free help"" online or on the phone. It's not free. Sure they will talk/email you, but they are useless and don't have answers to any of our questions. They just pay lip service and try to refer you to the pay portion of their service.[...] is nothing but a scam to get you to buy more goods and services. I don't like getting constantly hustled. The additional videos they sold me up front the Cardio party 2 and Booty sculpt are also inferior products in my opinion. They are nothing but re-hashed live versions of the original Turbo Jam product with poorer choreography and more ""Joint Jarring routines. I do not recommend them. Other criticisms include, mediocre music, hard to follow instructions and camera angles that constantly change so that it is hard to follow the instructions especially when they are switching shots right in the middle of an exercise change. It can be very frustrating at first, but over time you begin to learn and anticipate what you should be doing. As you get more familiar with the routines you can also pick up many mistakes in timing that Chalene makes throughout the videos. My wife has tried many other brands of workouts and confirms that these videos are on average harder to follow because of all the switching around while you're trying to watch and learn.

Some good things that we like about this program are that in the end it works; And there are low impact versions for every workout. Chalene is friendly, positive and encouraging. The beautiful people of Orange County that are in the Videos are not too hard on the eye's either. I like the fact that I can exercise in air conditioning when it's a hot summer day or in a warm room when it's a cold winter day and stay dry inside while working out on a rainy day. It's very transportable and I can take it with me when I'm working on the road. I like this program for the basic Turbo Jam program/exercises but nothing else it claims to offer. So far it has helped me loose over 45 pounds and I feel great, so for that I am pleased. Try this if you like. It worked for me, but don't waist your time and money on all the peripheral stuff that is a distraction form what really works.",1248912000,,3114,4.348797250859106

5670592,5,B00BSVUED8,"Turbo Jam's Cardio Party is a great workout, one that goes by quickly and makes you sweat more than you think. I tire easily when running outside, or even pushing myself to do more than 300 calories on the treadmill, but with Cardio Party, I burn up to 500 calories without becoming exhausted. Instructor Chalene Johnson is encouraging and fun to follow, and I even like the rest of her workout crew. Highly recommended.
Also, the DVD arrived within days, rather than the week and a half suggested by the shipping timeline, which I was pleased about.",1248825600,,550,4.680412371134021

5670594,5,B00BSVUED8,"I seriously despised this dvd when I first did the cardio party work out. As with any work out you have to get use to the steps, which makes you feel like your playing catch up the entire time.  I have this in rotation with three other workouts and this one was the hardest to do (and the one I cursed at the most while doing).  I started with Cardio Party and have managed to somehow scratch the dvd to the point where it skips too much. I look forward to getting the other cardio party dvd's but until then I moved on to the 20-minute jam with the turbo sculpt.  By combining the two I have never sweated so much!

I urge you not to become discouraged as I was so ready to do.  I found the longer I did the workouts and the stronger I became the easier and more fun the workout became.  It is very high energy and Chalene had to grown on me.  I didn't want to ""bust a move"", I just wanted to work out... but now find myself dancing around when she cues for you to, lol.  I credit this workout for pushing me through these workouts to graduate my level from beginner to intermediate after two months.  I've come to realize that I hated this workout because it was so hard and now that my body can handle the challenge I look forward to doing them.  You will be sore and you will be challenged so don't expect this to be a piece of cake.  I suggest taking it easy the first few times trying these workouts until you get a good idea of the routine so you don't run yourself ragged or hurt yourself trying to keep up.  It'll come to you soon enough and you'll welcome the challenge.",1247702400,,1580,4.0941558441558445

Anyway, I really enjoy this workout because the moves are easy to follow and the music is very upbeat. There's even a 20 minute workout if you don't have 40+ min to get a workout in (which I try to do before going to work sometimes). The only thing is that I think at times it can be repetitious with the whole warm up and some of the workouts, but that is pretty trivial when the whole idea is to have fun working out and that's exactly what I get.",1243900800,2,587,4.068965517241379

5670604,5,B00BSVUED8,"In a word: FUN! I did Tae Bo and real martial arts (Kenpo, Krav Maga) for three years, and while I loved them all, this is the most fun yet! (Well, real martial arts may have been better, but it didn't have this music!) Chalene is bubbly and energetic, which I normally despise, but she manages to be just quirky enough that she's not annoying. In fact, she's adorable. For those who feel this isn't challenging, it is possible your fitness level demands a little extra, so try weighted gloves and/or ankle weights. I've also noticed that it's easy if I want to make it easy, give just that exact amount the workout demands. But if I go crazy and throw 110% into it, the workout hits a new level. Watch Chalene instead of the people around her; she adds a lot more pep into her own moves, like a lot of hops and head wobbles. She uses /every/thing in her arsenal, so if you need more challenge, give more of yourself. Reach a little further, squat a little deeper, make the actions bigger, that kind of thing. And add weights. I never do a single workout without at least 1/2 lb gloves on. (I got some great, adjustable weight gloves off Amazon! Atlus, I think.) All her workouts have been good (though I haven't tried the Total Body Blast for lack of a yoga ball), but I love her 30 min Fat Blaster, the 45 min Cardio Party Mix 1, the Turbo Sculpt (using soup cans and ankle weights at the moments, need to pick up actual weights) the 30 min Cardio Party (A real worker if you give it everything!) and the Punch, Kick and Jam. I adore the sweet little 20 min workout and often use it after bigger workouts for an added punch. That's a fun one that turns into a workhorse if you really throw yourself into it or are already a bit tired. Chalene has made me happy again and while my scale says I've lost nothing, I can definitely see the difference in how my clothes fit and my body looks. I've been doing Turbo Jam (and Hip Hop Abs) 5-6 days a week for a month now and see definite results. More than that, I'm having fun!",1243555200,4,2022,4.254545454545455

I am pretty fit and wanted something to change up my work outs. This does that, but I don't feel it is pushing me any furthur. Disappointed by the 'sculpting' workout. Again, not challenging if you are already lifting weights. None of the workout segments left me sore the next day. So, in sum, it is a FUN, motivating workout, but not especially challenging for someone who is already avidly working out (I run 4.5 miles about 4X per week and also lift weights).",1242691200,,640,4.517241379310345

The beginning workout that teaches you the moves and the correct posture are clear and understandable. Chalene is excellent at leading the workouts.

5670612,3,B00BSVUED8,"It's a fun, well structured workout that I have done faithfully for years along with Tae bo.  So why only 3 stars? because although it does burn calories it does not increase your fitness.  I can do the most advanced Tae Bo and Turbo Jam workouts yet cannot run for 10 minutes?! It wasn't until I jumped the turbo jam ship and started working out with Jillian Michaels 30 day shred and P90X that I've noticed I'm not just burning calories but I'm actually getting fit.  I still use my turbo jam videos for cardio workouts because they are fun and they make you sweaty, but if you're interested in increasing your fitness substantially then use P90X or JM 30DS.

5670614,3,B00BSVUED8,"I saw the Turbo Jam infomercial and decided to give it a try. I have some of the Jillian Michael workout videos, and also some Pilates DVDs, and thought this might be a fun addition. I was overall disappointed with this DVD set.  I didn't find the workouts to be very challenging compared to the Jillian Michaels. I would consider myself to be in fairly decent shape, and I was hoping to get my heart rate up and to feel it the next day. The only one that I felt was a good workout was the 20 minute ab workout.  The workouts consist of a ""learn and burn""  which is teaching you the moves and then a 15 minute workout at the end, a 20 minute express workout, a 40 minute sculpting, a 45 minute cardio, and a 20 minute ab. I tried them all, and just didn't feel like it was worth the $60 [...]. I am sending it back. I may try the Barry's Bootcamp for the same price, at least there are more workouts and you get equipment with it.  I did get the gloves and the extra workout dvd, but the gloves started leaking sand everywhere when I took them out of the packaging. If you are looking to try a good workout DVD - I would recommend the 30 Day Shred by Jillian, it gives you three 20 minute workouts that are really tough and make you work up a sweat.  I can feel the burn after about 10 reps with 3 pound weights and I love that they are only 20 minutes long.  For $60 you can buy several different workout videos!",1241395200,,1413,4.0647482014388485

I HAVE DONE EVERY WORKOUT BUT THE TURBO SCULPT BUT I CAN'T WAIT TO DO THAT ONE. I CAN ALREADY FEEL A CHANGE IN MY BODY, AND ABS. CHALENE IS VERY MOTIVATING, AND SO IS HER CREW. I LOVE THE MUSIC AND THE ENERGY ON THE ENTIRE PROGRAM. IT'S SO FUN YOU WON'T EVEN NOTICE THE TIME, BECAUSE IT JUST FLIES BY. I CAN'T WAIT TO GET THE WEIGHTED GLOVES FOR MORE RESULTS. I THINK THAT IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT IS FUN, AND DOESN'T FEEL LIKE A WORKOUT,AND SHOWS TRUE RESULTS, THEN YOU WON'T GO WRONG WITH TURBO JAM. AFTER ONLY A FEW DAYS I FEEL MY ABS MORE, I HAVE MORE ENERGY, AND MY LOVE HANDLES ARE DISAPPEARING. i HAVE FELL IN FOVE WITH TURBO JAM AND YOU WILL TO. Will update when i see more major results.
Enjoy.

P.S.- EVEN IF YOU HAVE BAD KNEES YOU CAN USE TURBO JAM, BECAUSE THERE ARE MODIFICATIONS. YOU CAN DO THIS WORKOUT WITHOUT JUMPING UP AND DOWN. SO GIVE IT A CHANCE, BECAUSE YOU HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE.

UPDATE- AS OF MAY 10TH, I HAVE LOST 4 INCHES OFF MY WAIST, AND MY LOVE HANDLES ARE COMPLETELY GONE.i WENT FROM A 36 INCH WAIST TO A 32 INCH WIAST.

The people seem to be enjoying themselves and even take ""real"" water breaks! Even if this is staged, they look like they are sweating and working as hard as I am. I especially love the fact that there is a timer on the bottom of the screen to let you know how long each segment is. I admittedly have not done the Ab video, but I am working up to it.

Admittedly, it does take a few times to catch onto the chorography, and it can be hard on your knees, but that aside, it's a challenging and fun workout.

Just after doing it for a few weeks, I can see and feel the changes already.  I would highly recommend this product.",1239408000,,396,4.253333333333333

I immediatly noticed a difference.  Day tree and my pants were fitting better, one week and my thighs are no longer best buds, two weeks, I'm down 3 pounds (started at 130).  I recently purchased the Party mix 3 and can't wait to get going on that one.

5670629,5,B00BSVUED8,"Turbo Jam was the first series of workouts that I've ever stuck with. They are fun, high energy, and have great, upbeat music. Chalene Johnson has a way of motivating and pumping up people, as well as making it fun. Before I did Turbo Jam, I had been doing Tae Bo. Turbo Jam is similar to Tae Bo, in that it has kickboxing, but it's much more lighthearted and fun. The Cardio Party is the fun, high cardio work out. The Turbo Sculpt video has wonderful music with the speed that you work out. I have only done the Learn & Burn a couple of times, as it's only 10-15 minutes long. The 20-Minute workout is great, especially when combined with the Ab Jam. Ab Jam is fun as well, and the time flies. There is a timer for each workout, which I thought would make it feel longer, but it actually has the opposite effect for me. Again, if you like Tae Bo, but want something a little more fun to go with it, Turbo Jam is for you.",1239235200,,922,4.127777777777778
5670630,5,B00BSVUED8,"I have had Turbo Jam for a few years now.  I stopped exercising some time ago and recently got back into it.  When I read negative reviews regarding the effectiveness of Turbo Jam, I really have to wonder what the reviewer is expecting.  TJ is not going to help you lose weight or tone up if it is sitting on your shelf gathering dust.  You actually have to use it for it to be effective and I don't mean just using the 20 minute workout 2 or 3 times a week.  Also Turbo Jam, and exercise in general, should be just one part of your overall effort to becoming or staying fit.  Eatting well is the other part.  Exercise should not be taken as a license to gorge yourself on high calorie foods.  Even if you are exercising, you still have to realize that you won't lose weight if your daily caloric intake exceeds your daily calorie usage.  The bottom line is, anything that gets you up and moving, raising your heart rate will be beneficial if you are consistent and put the effort in to modify your lifestyle and Turbo Jam can be part of that.

As for me, I do Turbo Jam 4 to 6 times a week.  I try to do the 40 minute Cardio Party and 20 minute Ab Jam the majority of the time and the Turbo Sculpt a few times a week.  Recently I started using the weighted gloves during cardio and I can really feel the increase in intensity.  I start to really break a sweat within the first few minutes of using them and I find that my heart pumps faster and my breating quickens a lot sooner than without them.  Plus I can feel that the muscles in my arms, chests, shoulders and upper back are getting a workout from the extra weight.

I cannot comment on actual quantitative weight loss, as I do not keep track of my weight on a scale.  I know that TJ is working because my measurements are changing, my clothes are getting loose and I have muscle definition in places where there was none before.  Other ""side effects"" I have experience from doing Turbo Jam is more energy, better sleeping patterns, motivation to eat better, better breathing (My lungs feel so much stronger), and better mood/less stress.

Although I love Turbo Jam, I cannot say that it is 100% perfect.  Sometimes the cueing is a bit awkward but I do think that once somebody has done it enough they will know when to anticipate the changes in moves.  Also sometimes Beach Body changes the bonuses offered with the package and the bonuses are not readily available to users wishing to get the new videos or equipment to add on to their existing package (ie I'd love to get the ""Punch, Kick, and Jam"" video but it's not sold on its own).

Turbo Jam works for me and I plan on continuing with it to reach and maintain my fitness goals.",1239148800,,2692,4.291089108910891
5670631,5,B00BSVUED8,"So I have only done the Turbo Sculpt so far, but that single workout was worth the price of the DVD.  The workout is broken down into segments and you do need light weights 3-5 lbs. or at least weighted gloves to really get the impact of the workout.  Having studied free weights before I have got tosay that she knows her stuff.  She teaches form extremely well and is careful to point out pitfalls of overextension and strain.  This is also an extremely low impact workout, no jarring moves or excessive bouncing.  I would HIGHLY recommend this video to anyone interested in a toning or weight building workout.  And you won't build bulk since you are using large muscle groups and light weights!",1238716800,,698,4.588709677419355
5670632,4,B00BSVUED8,"I just started doing this DVD, and so far I really like it! I've only done the Learn & Burn a couple times and the 20-minute Workout once, so I'm still figuring out the moves and steps. I think once I get the hang of it I'll really start enjoying it and seeing results.
I like the instuctor a lot, she's not super annoying and gives good cues. The Learn & Burn does a good job of teaching you the basics, but I wish it went over some of the more complex moves as well, since those are the ones I'm having a hard time learning. Oh well, I guess I'll just have to keep practicing. So far, so good though!
This is a good workout DVD, but from what I've seen so far of it, I wouldn't use it as my only method of working out but more as a supplement. I still plan on doing other types of cardio like running and elipticals, and other types of ab and thigh workouts too (like sit-ups). I will say that I haven't gotten to the more advanced levels yet, so my opinion could change. However, I still think I'll continue running etc in addition to this. But this is a really good alternative when you don't have a lot of time, or you don't feel like going all the way to the gym and just want to workout at home.",1238457600,,1202,4.0125

The music in this video is very high energy and helps with keeping me motivated to continue working out.  Charlean (trainer) comes across as being very energetic, positive and fun.

I shied away from doing the cardio workouts (cardio party and 20 minute workout) because the first time I tried to do them I could not keep up with some of the move combos.  I did turbo sculpt three times a week and took a brisk walk in between.  My arms especially are noticeably stronger and you can feel the muscle developing there.  I have only lost a couple of pounds because like I said, I shied away from the cardio, but this past week I finally dove in and picked it up a lot quicker than I thought, and now I love the cardio workouts too!
Now my schedule is turbo sculpt and 20 minute workout three days a week and cardio party and ab jam three days a week.  I feel noticeably better and healthier and am looking forward to losing the weight as well now that I have incorporated the cardio.

For those of you who have it and are not that into it, I suggest you keep trying! I thought some of the moves were too complex but after three times it's becoming so much more natural and smooth, and I think I could do turbo sculpt in my sleep.  The music is not really current or anything but it really pumps you up and keeps you motivated.  Chalene is so encouraging and even though I pump the music up, hearing her in the background pushing me and telling me I can do it is about the only thing that gets me through the workout some days.

I love turbo jam!!!",1234051200,,1532,4.090301003344481
5670649,5,B00BSVUED8,"I'm not big on workout videos, much preferring to go to group aerobic kickboxing classes, but I saw the infomercial for this workout and thought I would really like it. And I do.
Chalene is peppy, but not obnoxious/cheerleadery. She pretty good at cueing, although there's one part that she totally missed and I feel like you can tell she knows it in the video, but otherwise she's a pretty good leader. Her instructions on punching and kicking are in line with what I've been taught in the past. The 20 minute cardio session is great when you don't feel like working out, but not so great when you're short on time because if you really put your all into it, it takes a while to cool down (I hate showering then getting out of the shower and continuing to sweat!). The longer ""Cardio Party"" is 40 minutes, with a quick warm up and nice cool down, including some tai-chi moves. She has a good variety of combinations within her workouts, so its not boring and various muscles are worked. I also really like her turbo scuplt, although it is hard on the knees and there isn't much room for modification in that respect (unlike the cardio workouts, which have 2 people doing low-impact modifications). The ab workout is also pretty good, with 10 minutes standing and 10 minutes lying down. She also tries to focus on abs in her other workouts too, which is nice. Overall, I've done the cardio session over and over again, and as long as you put in a good effort you will get a great workout, have fun, and want to do it again. The music's not too bad either. Also, there's not really 5 workouts in one, because the first one just teaches you the moves, and if you already do kickboxing you should probably watch it once (you could read a magazine while you make sure you know all her moves). But the 4 videos you get are REALLY good, the routines are not too complicated, you work up a sweat and it's fun!",1233100800,,1902,4.40625

5670651,5,B00BSVUED8,"Okay, I confess. . . I was the ultimate couch potato.  I bought this workout set, and it sat there for months before I could work up to even giving it a try.  I saw it on an Infomercial with my son, and he convinced me to buy it.  I really didn't think I could keep up with all that intense looking energy on the show.  Well, after trying a ""walking"" video by a different trainer, I thouht I'd at least watch the intro. Okay, so far, so good.  Then, I got myself to try the first work out, ""Burn"", of the Learn & Burn set. It was only 15 minutes, so I thought I might be able to do it.  And I did!  I used just this one section over and over again for a few months.  It was great!  The visual set up is very appealing, as is Chalene's personality and motivation style. Playful and upbeat.  I fell in love with the work out.  Then I went on to the next section which is 20 minutes long.  It can be pretty intense, but it's true that once your body gets use to the moves, the workout is a breeze.  Since then, I've also fallen in love with the Turbo Sculpt - 40 minutes.  Very well put together, and the music pleasantly sticks with you throughout the day. I've now bought several other of Chalene's Turbo Jam DVD's  to have some additional variety when I need it.  I like them, but doing the 20 minute workout along with the Turbo Sculpt is still my favorite.  Some days I can't get enough, and I do several workouts for a long session.  Thank You Chalene!  Your workouts are AWESOME!",1232928000,,1483,4.086805555555555
5670652,5,B00BSVUED8,I am mid-level to advanced when working out.  I quit my gym (kickboxing class) to save some cash so I decided to purchase this DVD.  My girlfriend and I completed the Cardio Party on Sat. and I was still sore on Wednesday.  You workout your ab and back muscles throughout the entire segment.  You can feel how much of a workout you've completed.  I highly recommend this DVD!,1232582400,,375,4.455882352941177
5670653,5,B00BSVUED8,"I began looking for a good workout DVD when i was about 5 months pregnant with my daughter. I refused to ""let go"" of myself after pregnancy. I was 5'0"" and weighed 115 pre-pregnancy and shot up to 160 by the end of my pregnancy. About 3 months after having her, I finally tried these DVDs for the first time. These workouts are not for wimps and i got so mad at myself just because i couldn't get it after my first try...so what did i do?? I put in a storage box to get it far away from me, i felt hopeless...i continued to search for a good workout dvd and purchased quite a few, they didn't work. I woke up one night and the turbo jam infomercial was on...watching it encouraged me to bring it back out and give it another shot, but ONCE AGAIN, i gave up. I did a little better, but being the perfectionist i am, it didn't feel like i was doing it right, so i put it away!

Finally, I'd had enough of being uncomfortable in pants that were 5 sizes bigger than i was pre-pregnancy...5 sizes bigger WAS TOO SMALL!?!?!? I began watching what i ate and eating only when i was hungry, and also in smaller portions...in about 4 months i lost nearly 20 pounds...FINALLY, I'D FOUND MOTIVATION! Once i saw smaller numbers on the scale, i felt invincible and like i was finally getting my body back! I brought that turbo jam back out and told myself that i could do it and not to beat myself up if I didn't do every move perfect and precise. This time i pushed myself. Im only doing the 45 min cardio party, but i've lost inches...i don't know the exact measurement, but went from a tight fitting size 7 to a comfortable 5--not the size 3 i used to be, but i'm still VERY happy with the results!

I feel so great about myself and my body again. And as cliche as it sounds, I have so much more confidence and ENERGY! These DVDs are great!",1232409600,,1829,4.163841807909605
5670654,5,B00BSVUED8,"I just had to write in to say how happy I am to have come across the turbo jam workouts. I've done the cardio party 1 workout about 4 times now and I love it soooo much!! I feel fitter and slimmer without getting bulky. I'm naturally quite muscular but found myself putting on the pounds after I moved in with my boyfriend. I tried Jillian Michaels 30-day shred for a few months but found myself really bulking up. My boyfriend kept saying I was looking like Serena Williams (don't get me wrong - she's an awesome sportswoman but I wanted a more slender physique than hers). Anyway, I stopped doing 30-day shred and Biggest Loser's Cardio Max and tried Turbo Jam along with Pilates and a few other workouts. My current routine is Callanetics twice a week (excellent for tone and strength without bulk) and turbo jam on the other days. The 20 minute workout is cool for days I have to get to work early. I thought ab jam and the sculpt were OK but I didn't feel either of them the day after so have stuck to the callanetics and some pilates for my ab work. I've just ordered punch, kick and jam and some gloves - I read here on Amazon that that workout includes some toning moves too, so I'm really keen to try it out. The best thing about the turbo jam workouts is that they're so much fun...I really don't feel like it's a chore at all...more like a cool way to get some exercise and get my spirits up each day. I've tried Tae-Bo but the music is terrible compared to TJ and it's not so much of a party atmosphere. If you're thinking of buying TJ, definitely go for it...I don't think you'll regret it!!",1232236800,,1604,4.279605263157895

5670658,3,B00BSVUED8,"This is a challenging and fun workout (well, except for the requisite baaad music) only IF you can get beyond the poor cueing.  For me I need and appreciate someone who can guide me along whether I look at the screen or not.  It's what I like about a Billy Blanks or Rodney Yee DVD.  They are masters at cueing.  Chalene is not.  I found myself lost so many times (the pace can get rapid and confusing) that I just wanted to give up.  Seriously, is there anything worse than having to stop and start several times during a workout?  Making time or finding the motivation to work out is difficult enough - who needs distraction and frustration?  Not me.  I'm very surprised that someone like Chalene who obviously cares about helping people to get in shape would fail to understand how bad cueing can hamper a great workout experience.  Weird.  Anyway, for that I took off a star.  Had to.  So buyer beware is all I'm saying.",1231632000,3,924,4.428571428571429
5670659,5,B00BSVUED8,I stumbled across this DVD a little while ago. I think Chalene does a great job of keeping you involved and motivated. It's a little faster paced than some of the other Billy Blanks DVD's that I have but I like it just the same. Whatever keeps your body moving is the main point I guess. One of the performers in the DVD lost about 70 pounds so I think that's the best testament to the effects of the Turbo Jam workouts and proper diet one can offer.,1231286400,,450,4.125

I cannot workout on my own on machines, I just don't feel like I'm hitting all the zones, but in the TKB class, I definitely feel the difference between cardio, strength, endurance, etc.  After taking my mother to a class, I can see how some find the workout daunting due to the choreography, but if you have any semblance of being able to mimic motions, you should be able to catch on after a few tries.  I now live in a new area and it seems like none of the gyms teach turbo kick, so now I am left with the decision to buy or not to buy...but after the weight loss success I had with this class at the gym, it's worth a 35-dollar shot",1230854400,,772,4.065789473684211

It's different, fun, and the music is catchy. I don't get bored with it.  Also, I'm not the best at really complicated dance routines, and this is pretty easy to follow. They have an instruction section where you can learn every move they do slowly and with tips and instruction for proper technique. The final reason I love this dvd: The instructor is not annoying. Unlike every other workout dvd I have, she doesn't talk in the same voice all the time, sound insincere or canned, or love her own butt.

I must admit I used these dvds vigorously when I first got them.  Then I slacked off as many do.  Surprisingly, I was able to resume my workouts at the same level of intensity.  I like the music and the time bar that allows you to see just how far you gone.  I find that the time bar helps me pace myself.

I think the set should be more affordable; no more than $20.  I saw it listed at more than one hundred dollars.  That's TOO MUCH.  I didn't pay nearly that much so I can't complain.

I love the sets including this one with the mini workouts.  I can actually do those before or just after work without feeling bad about not going to the gym.

Being in relatively decent shape before I started, the quick results make it even more fun to work out.  Chalene is entertaining and not too perky - but encouraging and talks you through the whole workout.  The time bar at the bottom of the screen is a life saver!

5670695,5,B00BSVUED8,"I've been looking for an enjoyable cardio workout for some time now and really think this is it.  I first tried to do Tae Bo, but found that about half way through the workout, Billy Blanks would put together some routine that left me saying 'How in the %^7**^$ does he expect me to do that?!' and/or something requiring balance that I just don't have so I stopped doing that.

Honestly, I was a victim of the Turbo Jam infomercial which happens to be on in the morning when I first turn my TV on - so I thought I'd try it.  It reminds me a lot of Tae Bo, except without the impossible routines/balance of an acrobat moves.  I've been working out in some way for about 15 years and the 45-50 minute workouts have me soaked in sweat by the time I get done - it is great!

I haven't lost any weight yet, but I can't really follow the meal plan because I'm vegan and the meal plan isn't.  However, I believe the claims that it burns LOTS of calories and I expect the weight loss to start soon.",1214179200,3,990,4.130208333333333

Both the 20 and 45 minute workout is so quick and fun that it goes by without a struggle. These workouts can be done low impact and at the same time you can gradually increase to make them as high impact as possible.  One of the best features is the time scale that shows you how much time is left and how much time you have on this particular segment.  It helps to keep me motivated to finish. I have purchased at least 30 workout videos over the years, plus had various gym memberships and this workout is absolutely has produced the most results in the least time.

5670697,1,B00BSVUED8,"This has to be the worst workout video ever.  I can't believe everybody loves it because you could make up your own Turbo Jam by dancing around the house in your PJs to your favorite music.

Compared to other workouts, I personally feel that it has little fitness merit.  ""Getting my groove on"" is not what I want to do in a workout. The instructor is obnoxious, and the whole thing is just goofy.  Save your money and try Cathe Freidrich videos.",1213920000,5,446,4.402439024390244
5670698,5,B00BSVUED8,"IMHO, This video is great for beginners. Will it exhaust you? Yes! Will it frustrate you? Yes! Will you have to watch it for a couple of weeks before you even know all of the moves? Yes! Will you have to wait a few more weeks before you can even do all of the moves in 20 mins? Yes! And yes she will get on your nerves some days...
However; I have so far lost 27 pounds and look better than I have in years. I had to wait about three weeks into this video before my core was even strong enough to do the moves correctly (still could not do all the reps!) but I persevered and I am so glad I did! If you can't keep up, just keep moving until you can. I am one third of the way to my goal and this video is why. The moves are super simple. No, her cueing isn't the best but the simplicity of what you are doing just takes repetition. And, if like me you have been disconnected from your body for awhile...this is a great and powerful way to begin reconnecting. I also have bad knees and this did not hurt (unlike the Shred video which killed me and set me back a week).",1213574400,12,1067,3.921658986175115
5670699,2,B00BSVUED8,"I think there is too much hype about this video.
UNFORTUNATELY, I fell for all the positive reviews posted here in Amazon. What a mistake!

I've done Pilates, Tae Bo, Yoga, and I consider myself in decent shape, but I found this workout can be strenuous on your knee joints & elbows.

There is nothing special about Turbo Jam, except only a few moves that might differ from Tae Bo, the rest seem to have been copied from Billy Blanks.
If you really want to lose weight and look great,....I kindly recommend you buy Tae Bo instead....and additionally/or dance to YOUR favourite tunes. This works better and is more fun.
You can do your own moves...DANCE TO WHAT YOU LIKE. You can lose weight this way too! (did anyone ever think about that???)
The music used on these videos...is no big deal. I think you probably  have better taste on something that would motivate you and keep you moving.
Dance all you want ....and you will enjoy it even more. You don't need a video to be telling you how to move. You will lose the weight..
If you have already seen the commercial about this workout video, then I assure you, there is nothing new besides those boring moves.

And yes, it does hurt your knees. Not to mention, the lady fails to do proper warm up for every single workout level. The only time she cares about form, is at the very first workout. Human beings tend to forget, is always good to be reminded,..which she did not take the time to mention as the workouts progress....or even take it slow for you to ""memorize"" the moves.
So if you do buy it, make sure you warm up your legs well and ""oil"" up your knees too. Be careful too, you can hurt your back if you do some moves way too fast....
Another thing is...is you were considering even buying the ""Maximum Results"" video,.....save your money. The workouts are the same as these, with the only difference that you have hand weights (which you can purchase at any Sports Authority or Walmart) and a workout with the Weights...and a bunch of paperwork. That's the only difference.

I seriously recommend you stick with Tae Bo (with Billy Blanks, who I find to be a better trainer, who cares enough to remind you everytime for you to keep proper form...)and dance to your favourite tunes. Is the best you can do, instead of spending your money, in some OVER RATED workout video.

Think about it, don't fall for the hype I did, and I now regret it.

After finding discount copies on Amazon, I found the workout to be just as fun as they claimed it to be. Sure Chalene is way too perky and there are several promotional segements throughout, but her energy is infectious and so are her success stories.

5670705,5,B00BSVUED8,"Here's my review for each of the workouts in this dvd collection:

Learn & Burn - Obviously an essential for those who are new to turbo jam. It's really not an effective workout at all, but if you don't know the moves then you have to start here.

20 Minute - Awesome fantastic workout, my favorite on this dvd. I do it every morning. If you do this workout at high intensity and really push yourself, then its far more effective then just going through the motions of a 40 minute workout. There are 4 combination sets in this workout and each of them are effective, well instructed, fun, and fairly easy to catch on to.

Turbo Scuplt - Excellent resistance training workout. It is not fast paced or dancey. You are using light weights with controlled movements. It is also highly effective and fun. Times flys by and you will be sore (at least you should be, if you push yourself).

Cardio Party - Not my favorite. I have been doing this workout for many years and still do not feel coordinated with this particular one. Some of the combination sets are a lot of fun, but too many are just plain awkward and not very well intructed. I find myself wanting to do other things instead, like double up on the 20 minute cardio.

Ab Jam - This workout is 20 minutes, 10 minutes standing and 10 on the floor. The standing portion is great and I often double up on it. The floor portion is average. Traditional moves, not very interesting or fun, and honestly not even very challenging. Turbo Jam Live Booty + Abs has a much better ab routine for the floor.

I have been using this Turbo Jam for a few years now and am just getting around to writing a review. This was my first dvd in the collection and definately the best way to start it. I have since acquired most of the other dvds and really enjoy Turbo Jam workouts and definately see fantastic results!",1212105600,4,1852,4.369186046511628
5670706,5,B00BSVUED8,"I work out to DVDs every morning.  I love Billy Blank DVDs and my new favorite is TURBO JAM!  These five workouts are fun, great music, and Chalene's energy is addicting.

There's Turbo Sculpt - you do this one with weights and it's slower, for toning and lifting the butt.  I do this one at least once a week and boy do I feel it for the rest of the week.

There is a 20 minute Turbo Jam for the days you don't have a lot of time.  I love this option for the days I have to leave early - I at least get a little pick me up and go before being sedatary the rest of the day.

Cardio Party is just plain fun.  I love the moves, the kicking, the punching and dancing.  It's a great workout and keeps me happy.

Ab Jam is similar to Cardio Party, still fun, just a bit shorter.

All of the programs have a timing countdown on them telling you exactly where you are in your workout.  It's helpful and encouraging, I tell myself, okay five more minutes of this and then the cool down...it keeps me going.

I also got the weighted gloves that I LOVE.  For the days I really want a more intense workout, the gloves work my arms to fatique and they're getting a little more defined.

There a lot of the same people throughout the programs and it's awesome to see how much weight they've lost and their personal stories at the end of the dvds.  It's a very sweet personal touch.

I highly recommend to all people who like aerobic exercise, enjoy 80's beats and want to start their morning in a good mood!",1211500800,7,1494,4.114186851211072
5670707,4,B00BSVUED8,"I did these workouts for almost two years, and I have to say that they really do work.  The only complaint I have is that my lower back pain increased while doing these exercises, but that may be just me.

The dvds are fun to do, albeit a bit cheesy.  If you can get past that, Chalene is actually a really good teacher and the moves are fairly simple to do.  It's the repetition that gets you. There is a 3-4 minute warm up and then you go through several (i think it's 5) seperate cardio segments- all about 7 minutes each.  Within the workout there is a TURBO section- about 1:30, where you step up the cardio. There is also a timeline timer on the bottom of the screen, so you always know how far you've come and how much further you have to go.

You will feel sore the next day- at least I did.  Once these become routine, she also has another group of ""advanced"" videos - which are not anything new, just longer.",1211328000,2,918,4.1525423728813555
5670708,5,B00BSVUED8,"I ordered this set of workouts after watching the infomercial a couple years ago.  I was impressed by Johnson's explanation of the 'standing ab workout'.  I have issues with my neck which crunches truly exacerbate, so I thought I'd give this a try.

It's fabulous.  I got rather addicted.  The beginning workout is basic enough to not be discouraging, yet you can still feel the results and soon you can see them.  I felt great through my obliques, my abs, my upper arms, and my shoulders.  As you do the more advanced workouts, be sure to include the weight training one.  It's wonderful and really works you all over.

Johnson has a great product here and it worked for me!  It's also a great time.",1211241600,,700,4.528
5670709,4,B00BSVUED8,"I bought this after seeing the infomercials on tv and having such great fun with HipHop Abs (they're by the same people and have that same countdown bar and similar production styles which I like).  I enjoyed hiphob abs, but felt I needed more of a full body workout, so turned to TJ.  I have to say, I didn't like this right away and almost gave up on it...many times.  Mainly because her instruction is sorely lacking, and that's compounded by the fact that she moves really quickly from one thing to the next.

So, at first, you're just sort of stumbling around 2 steps behind, which is frustrating.  I was used to hiphop abs where Shaun tells you what you're going to do, then does it slow several times, then full speed, and you do a lot of repitition (which is also the downside to hiphop abs; once you're familiar with the moves, his slow pace is really boring unless you mix it up with your own stuff, especially during the tutorials...funnily enough I now mix in turbo jam moves like the row or wheel).  With Chalene she just basically tells you as she's going, so it's confusing.  She does inform you that it takes some getting used to so just keep trying.

My solution was to literally sit down and just watch the 2 intro routines (learn/burn and 20min workout) several times not working out, just watching, to get down the moves/timing.  That really helped and after a few viewings, I could do them along with the dvd.  I got into a steady rhythym of burn and the 20min workout for several weeks, before deciding to step it up a notch and try the other routines once I was comfortable with the moves and pace (which is fast).  Why?  Because I started seeing definite improvements in my muscles and could actually feel each move working, and saw slimming in my upper thighs which is my problem area that not a lot of workouts actually target (other than strengthening not slimming).  So that was insentive enough to tackle the Cardio Party routine, which is 45 minutes of sweating.

Some people complained about impact on joints.  Well that's why Chalene repeatedly says to modify any movements if need be.  Obviously everyone has different fitness levels.  With kicks or squats, you might have to modify the move to your level.  Or avoid the move altogether and run in place or substitute another move instead to keep your heart rate up.  It's pretty simple to do.  I also couldn't believe people complain about the length of the sections being too short!  There's something for every schedule.  The longest is 45minutes; the shortest about 15.  You can easily just do a couple back to back for a long workout or if you're short on time, do something like AbJam standing which is just 10min.  And then people complained about there not being enough dance.  It's not a dance tutorial, it's a workout with some dancy elements (as well as capoiera, tai chi, tae kwon do, kickboxing/punching) to spice up exercise.  It has everything, and it really is a full body workout.",1210723200,7,2980,4.596590909090909
5670710,5,B00BSVUED8,"I'm not very athletic, but I do work out everyday. I've been doing BeachBody's YogaBootyBallet, and when I found the ""Advanced Fat Burning"" boring I bought Turbo Jam. By the time I recieved it the advanced fat burning didn't even make me break a sweat. I tried the Cardio party, and was pleasantly surprised! You can choose to pump up the music and follow along with the people, and it definitely challenges you. The music is GREAT and some of the moves correspond with the music. It's a great workout and anyone can do it. It gives you that sweaty, tired, accomplished feeling that I personally shoot for after a workout.

5670711,3,B00BSVUED8,"My friend and I tried this DVD together and found it really boring. The energy level was low, the instructor kept saying cheesy stuff, and we just found it uninspiring and annoying.

The moves we did felt repetitive and after learning them and moving onto the regular workouts, I just felt uninspired and unexcited to actually work out. I was relieved when it was over.

The people showing the lower impact moves weren't always moving in a low-impact way, in fact, one of the ladies was so energetic that she kept adding extra movements, and the camera often didn't pan to them or show them in the background when showing new moves. This wouldn't have been a problem except that a lot of the moves were really hard on my knees - a lot of side to side stuff. I am only 29 so it isn't like I am a terrifically elderly person trying to do this stuff.

I also didn't find the music that great. The Turbo Jam part of the title made me think of hip-hop or dancy music, but the music felt stale.

I'll give it three stars because I have been sore after every workout and I can see that she worked my whole body well. The energy of it just wasn't right for me.",1209513600,8,1152,4.2465753424657535

5670713,3,B00BSVUED8,"With all the positive reviews, TV advertisments and hype about Turbo Jam I had to try it, (my rotation consists mostly of Cathe, Jari Love, Amy Bento and Christi Taylor).
First the pros: Chalene is great, upbeat and fun, and despite the critisizm on her cueing by other reviewers, I had not problem with it and was able to follow her quite well. The music is fun and the timer on the bottom is a nice feature that lets you always know where you are in the workout. Overall the moves are ok also. The Ab Jam workout is quite good too.
The cons: The intensity is too low for me and most of the workouts on this DVD are too short. You definitely have to do one after another to fill an hour. In addition, I wear wrist weights throughout (1.5 to 2 lbs. each) and have to add jumps whereever I can to increase the intensity. There is also not enough stretching with any of the workouts. Also, generally, the music, the moves and the warmups are very similar, if not the same in almost all of the Turbo Jams.
I will do them if I don't want to work too hard, for something different with 'pump it up' music, otherwise I stick to my usual rotation. Besides this one, I have tried Cardio Party 3 and Get On The Ball Total Body Blast, both are more intense and longer than the workouts on this DVD. The original price for any of these is not justified and luckily I got them all at a bargain.",1209427200,6,1382,4.179775280898877
5670714,2,B00BSVUED8,"Last year I ordered Thurmond's 6 week body makeover. Had good info. but lost only a few pounds. Must admit, didn't follow to the letter. But when I ordered Turbo Twist, I did follow the diet and excercise plan. The workout is high energy, the music I rate at about a ""C"". The instructor is NOT annoying. The weighted gloves are too small for my hands. I have osteoarthritis and the jarring dance moves with all the twists jammed up my knees and hurt my back. I modified the excercises, but after a month I'd only lost 1.5 pounds and 3.25 inches. I was so PO'd for less than $10 at Walmart I bought the Taebo Celebrity workout CD last week. After five workouts I've lost 4.5 pounds and 5 inches! The workout doesn't effect my AO either. It's a good sweat with great results. Wish I could send the Turbo Jam back.
The Billy Blanks CD is not as polished as TJ. Some of the people missstep and Billy Blanks looks kinda weird, but he works out yo a$$! The music is great on this CD. My advise, save some money...get Taebo.",1209081600,,1017,4.274611398963731

When I do kickboxing I have fun, but it takes alot of thinking when your involved with that. With turbojam you just go with the flow.

5670718,5,B00BSVUED8,"I love everything about Turbo Jam. The music that Chalene uses in her videos sounds very familiar to me 'coz I am from that generation. Anyways, I have the original 5 DVDs and the Fat Burning Elite. It's good to have the original to learn the moves properly and get the feel of how Chalene's program is all about. Yes, it's similar to Tae Bo (I have a lot of them) but this is a lot more FUN to do. Chalene's cuing may not be the best but just keep doing it, you'll eventually get the moves, you'll have a good time while losing weight and reshaping your body. My 2 favorites are the Fat Blaster and 3T. They're only 1/2 hour long but I sweat buckets when I'm done with the Fat Blaster. Fat Blaster consists of a warm up, 4 turbos x 2 (1 low intensity, the other is high intensity), cool down and stretch. I do this on my rebounder because there's a lot of hi-impact moves that may cause knee problems in the future. Oh, Mindy is always in Chalene's videos to modify so if you're not ready for the high intensity stuff, just follow her. 3T is a good overall toning routine. I alternate this with Crunch's Bootcamp or Abs Diet 2 strength video when I'm short on time. I highly recommend Chalene's Program. As experts say- for exercise to be effective, it has to be a mix of a lot of things so Turbo Jam will be a good addition to your DVD collection. Just be patient and you will see results....assuming you drink plenty of water and following a sensible diet! I'm not strict because I don't deprive myself but I watch my portions (1600-1800 calories/day).",1207094400,,1555,4.310580204778157

I always heard people say things about exercise tapes about how they look forward to working out and i always thought i did too whenever i went walking, but i think i do even more so now. All the different moves keep your mind interested rather than just zoning out like with walking. It doesn't involve as much dancing as i figured it would from the infomercials but i still like it. Someone said they thought the music was great on this tape but i only like the cool-down music in them.

Chalene is so darn happy and having fun in these videos, I just can't help but want to join in her enthusiasm!  It is a great way to start my day!

I've only had the videos for a few days and have only tried the 20-minute and the ab workout so far.  I'm not new to exercise, but holy cow is my core SORE from the ab workout!!  I'm so excited about that!!!

5670721,4,B00BSVUED8,I had read all the reviews and then ordered the videos. I only have about 10 to 12 lbs to lose and was doing the low carb diet for over a month with little to no sucess. I started the workout last Saturday with the learn and burn and moved up to the 20 min workout. I have done the cadio party mix twice and the turbo sculpt a couple of times as well as the ab workout once. I have lost 3lbs in 6 days and like everyone else REALY enjoy doing it. I have continued with the low carb diet as well. I too think that the cardio mix is a bit much. It is a hard workout if you are not really active but it is WELL worth the results. I am sticking with the 20 minute workout followed by the turbo sculpt. That is the most enjoyable combo I have found. As it gets easier I will move up.,1205712000,7,778,3.7791411042944785

This is, by far, the best workout system ever! I've never been this excited about a workout dvd, usually I get bored with the same old same old, and stop doing it. But with Turbo Jam it's different. The music, Chalene, the awesome cast, they all make you feel like part of the gang and you actually enjoy and look forward to popping in a TJ dvd everyday and working out.

5670727,4,B00BSVUED8,"I've been searching for a cardio workout that would really make me break a sweat, and this one is terrific (Cardio Party). The moves are fun to do, and very well taught. But the steps change often, and I guess the viewer is supposed to be psychic, since the cues are minimal, late, or non-existent. Thus you find yourself off-balance or just giving up on certain changes and approximating what they are doing.

What a fun workout with great music, the time bar at the bottom is great and I love the turbo segments in which the workout gets amped up. Chalene keeps you super motivated - I didn't find her annoying as another commented. You want the instructor to keep you moving and having fun and Chalene does a great job with that. I have so much fun doing these workouts - Cardio Party is the absolute best and I hope they come out with more similar workout DVDs! I highly recommend it!",1202342400,2,549,4.188679245283019
5670732,5,B00BSVUED8,"A friend recommended TurboJam, and I started with this package.  This is a great set of videos that let you get into TurboJam at any level.  There is a segment you'll probably only need once that teaches the moves.  Then there are two short, easy routines to get started and to fall back on on a lazy day.  Once you've mastered the basics, you still have an excellent long cardio segment, Cardio Party 1, and a great toning class.  That is a lot of content for a single package, and it all works well together.

Another note on TurboJam generally:  I like a high energy workout, but have terrible knees after years of those high impact aerobics we used to do.  I have been very frustrated finding a real workout that strengthens my kness, and doesn't leave me hobbled.  Turbo Jam is surprisingly effective and low impact.  My knees are fine, and my heartrate is high.

If you are interested in Turbo Jam, this package is the place to start.",1201996800,4,940,4.470588235294118

I started one week ago the 20 mins workout and I love it love it ... I already see improvements in my figure and it doesn't get me bored, major thing for me that I already tried a lot of home workouts such as slim in 6 and some dvds by Denise Austin. That's the best ever... the music is good to make u in the mood and it's just fun do it. I'm so happy that I bought it and for sure I'm gonna buy some more turbo jam dvds.

The music in this video and Chalene's energy make it so much more fun. There are random dance breaks where you just rock out on your own to keep your energy up. If you're short on time the 20 minute work out just makes you feel completely energized and gives you energy for your day. You get an amazing work out while having fun, you don't even feel like it's working out! I am seriously impressed because this was something I saw on a 7am infomercial on the food network. Usually I think those things are a joke but I have to say this is probably my best choice yet.

I've been doing Turbo Jam for over a year.  I started with ""Punch, Kick and Jam"" because I'm not really a fitness newbie.  Then over the course of the next year I added ""Get On The Ball"" and ""Fat Blaster"".  Love, love, love them.  About a week ago I ordered the whole first package.  Five awesome workouts.  My only complaint is that I wish they were all an hour long.  Chalene is an incredible source of positive energy and inspiration.  She's perky... but she's also funky and genuine and never, ever annoying.

Do yourself a favor and check out her hip-hop videos on YouTube.",1199836800,4,707,4.410852713178294

I was so excited after doing the Learn and Burn that I couldn't wait to do some of the others.  The sequence of moves does take some getting used to, especially in Cardio Party, but it's hard to get frustrated since the music is so upbeat and they go through them several times.  I've only made it through Turbo Scuplt a handful of times but it is a full body workout like you wouldn't believe.  I would recommend this as a good cardio workout, especially during the winter months when it's harder to get outside.  Once you start the workout you will want to see it through.  I started seeing results in the first week and I just felt better overall.  Every workout isn't for everyone but this was certainly a good one for me.",1199836800,,837,4.354838709677419
5670738,5,B00BSVUED8,I really enjoy the Cardio Party segments.  They are not overly difficult so you can actually keep up and perform the moves.  They offer high and low impact moves.  The instructor is not over the top like some can be but she provided plenty of encouragement and fun.  I did think the learn and burn was good to only get familiar with the moves.  I did it once then went on to the 20 minute workout and the two cardios.,1198627200,,417,4.1625
5670739,4,B00BSVUED8,"I've been wanting to buy Turbo Jam since I've seen it advertise on tv. It was one of the few, fun looking programs. I've taken Tae Kwon Do and Kickboxing.  Both past times that I've enjoyed, so maybe that's what attracted me to Turbo Jam.

It makes me sweat and my abs are tender.  What I did was combine the Burn and 20 minute, which ended up being 35 minutes. Now I'm used to doing a lot of cardio at the gym, so the beginner portion didn't wear me out quickly. I'm thinking about going to the advanced stage with the 45 minute cardio party, which she gives you the choice to do. Even if you're a couch potatoe, the music/moves will suck you in and you won't feel as miserable as you think you might.

The only part I didn't care for was the lack of cuing. However; If a person does the program enough, the cuing may not be a big deal.

Overall I like Turbo Jam Beachbody and it is one of the few programs that I want to follow through with. It is high energy, with good 80's music remixes.  It all depends what type of person you are.  If you have determination to get fit, you can do it.",1196640000,6,1091,4.070093457943925
5670740,5,B00BSVUED8,"For starters, I am not a ""tiny"" person. I'm short and stout. But I actually enjoy doing these videos. It's easy on my back and on my knees and the camera constantly cuts to the two women doing the low impact versions. Everyone raves about or hates the music, but I actually enjoy the music just because the rhythm matches perfectly with the moves and it is upbeat, which works fine for me.

I've been out of shape for a few years and this is something that is ""fun"" and I can stick with. You build up a good sweat, your heart rate goes up, and the whole time she's reminding you that you don't have to do it exactly like her (just make sure your technique/form is right) and to do things at your own pace.

I've been doing this for about three weeks on an everyother day basis and I've not lost the poundage, but the inches are moving some (I'm guessing the fat's leaving and I'm getting muscle again). My back is stronger and I don't have pain in my back anymore (ab muscles correlate with back muscles). I sleep better and my overall mood is better.

Some people have commented about her calling the moves. I was a little worried about that at first but after a little bit I realized that she was calling the moves a little early to give you time to get ready for it. I don't have a problem with it now and it's kind of nice to know what's coming up.

One of the reviewers commented on the fact that the moves get easier with time and repetition . VERY TRUE and that was very encouraging to hear. Just keep practicing and make sure your form is right and if you get lost just pause a moment to get your footing and keep going. You still burn calories! My punch combos are beautiful now (as opposed to the flapping chicken motions when I started!). It's worth it to stick with it and keep trying.

I would definately recommend this video to people of ANY size (even the ""fluffy"" ones such as myself!)",1196035200,10,1901,4.240331491712707

I started taking the classes twice a week and had a hard time keeping up because I only had the live lower body jam dvd at the time which had no turbos. I decided to get this dvd and was impressed. You should start with the learn and burn, you will learn all the turbo moves. The ab jam is a break from traditional crunches and gives a lot of focus to the obliques. Turbo sculpt is awesome and you will be sweating. And the cardio party and 20 mintue jam are great cardio. Turbo Jam helped break my plateau and with in the first 2 months I lost 15 pounds. But I also used an elliptical and lifted weights and did these dvd's every day. I no longer turbo every day but still use these dvds.

I actually didn't think I was going to like it the first time I watched it I was about to return it but I gave it a few run throughs.

For those who were complaining that the moves were too complex... I disagree as I'm not a dancer and don't get along with complex moves. You probably will want to run through it a handful of times before it clicks,. but once you do it is SO worth it. Out of the whole basic set cardio party I is my favorite. If you happen to get the newer set that comes with Punch,Kick,Jam... I HIGHLY recommend that too... very challenging, but so so fun... and my new all time favorite!

I have to be honest I have not lost weight in numbers but I have lost inches and I feel great, I can truly feel my body changing shape.  I also feel my muscles forming rapidly, kudos to the Turbo Sculpt workout, it kicks my butt and I love it, I started with no weights and felt little after the workout, I started using 5 lbs weights and WOW...the sweat just pours down my face and entire body, making me feel like I'm making progress.

5670749,5,B00BSVUED8,"I just bought the maximum results a few days ago because I'm having so much fun with the ones I already have.  I just need more of a mix and a new challenge. I've had the Beachbody 5 Workouts for a while and just recently started using it regularly instead of sporadically.  It's a really good work out. I love doing it and I look forward to it.  My knee is kind of sore right now.  Probably shouldn't do the turbo sculpt 2 days in a row. I did both the party mix 1 and the sculpt 2 days in a row and major house cleaning to boot.  So my knee is paying the price.  But definitely no fault of the program.  My only real complaint, is Holly.  She's the big girl in the video wearing green in the jam and blue in the sculpt. You can't miss her.  Everytime I turbo jam she's there and she's fat.  She's forever fat no matter how many times I excercise.  And yes, I understand it's a DVD and that it'll never change and that beachbody is just trying to show that everybody can do it. The only problem is, that in the interviews, Holly says that she's been doing turbo jam for 3 years. That's incredibly discouraging.  But she's not annoying unlike the one wearing the yellow top in the turbo sculpt. I still recommend it.  You can't make everybody happy.

Around the begginning of the year, I decided to start using the DVD's.  I enjoyed them and found them very challenging.  The around the beginning of March, I cut my calories back and began mixing up the dvd's and trying to use at least one a day, 5 days a week... Guess what??? I dropped about 5 inches off my waist, only 1 inch in my hips and about 12 pounds.  I am a apple shape.  I can tell you...the videos work great.  Now, with my bad back, I was worried about being able to actaul do the videos.  Some parts were more challenging than others, but over all, my back has never felt any better because they focus so much on core strength training.  Another impressive thing I found about their videos was that they have a few people doing the low intensity and then they do the high intensity, so you can always adjust to what works best for you.  Let's not forget that the videos range from 20 minutes, 30 minutes, 50 minutes and a hour, which gave me no more excuses not to find time.  There was always a video there I could use.  Did I mention I get bored really easy.  I can happily say I am still using these videos and still using.  You won't be dissapointed with this exercise series!",1177372800,13,1355,4.2421875
5670752,2,B00BSVUED8,"People love this so I bought it. I am a dance doofus, so when I tried it I just could not get the complicated moves-the moves with one step were fine, but the two or more steps were too complicated.  Even on the learning part of the DVD she doesn't really explain them.

Then on the actual workout (like the 20 min workout) they move too fast so that you have no time to focus on your actual form or to do them properly. You are so busy trying to do them as fast as Chalene is, that you totally lose any ability to focus on doing them right.

I had Carmen Electra's workout-DVD 2 of the striptease collection. That DVD was just a workout and I did it everyday because it was easy to follow but I felt pleasantly sore and strong after. That broke so I bought Turbo jam. Well-ever since I got turbo jam I do not workout everyday because when I think about it it seems so pointless to do something incorrectly -I didn't feel stronger after doing it because they moved too fast and my form was off-I just felt like I jumped around alot.

BOTTOM LINE: if you catch on quick to dance steps, etc this could be for you. But if you are a dance challenged person like me, go for something a little slower with more emphasis on form-like Carmen Electra's disc 2 of the electric striptease collection.",1175904000,24,1289,4.227642276422764
5670753,5,B00BSVUED8,"This set contains 5 workouts. I'm just going to go over them generally and then leave my more indepth reviews on the individaul listings.

The first week I used the series I did drop a pants size.  So I want to start out with the fact that the series works. I'm just coming out of my third pregnancy and see a dramatic change in my abs, especially the lower abs.

Before you buy the dvd, do an internet search because I did read where consumers were having problems with purchases made from one particular site (not Amazon).

Overall, this is an excellent series of workouts.  I love Tae Bo and Turbo Jam is even better.  Chalene is likeable and fun and working out really is fun with the DVDs. I highly recommend this. It is well worth the money.",1175644800,13,747,4.338129496402877
5670754,4,B00BSVUED8,"This DVD definitely gets you sweating, and the sculpting workout definitely exhausts every muscle in your body!  It's not as hardcore as Tae-Bo but it's certainly not a pansy workout either.  Chalene is energetic and very motivating (even with her white girl dancing style!), so you're never bored throughout any of the workouts - the time really flies by.  For the most part, it's low-impact, but you can easily jump around more or punch harder if you want it to be more high-impact.

I know a lot of people rave about the music, but to me it's just OK.  After awhile that ""L-la-la-ladies...Fa-fa-fa-fellas..."" tune(among others) can get annoying.  I am glad the music is fast and upbeat, though, which is definitely a must for me!

I like that two of the workouts are only 20 minutes long - this way I can still fit in a little cardio for those days when I'm not really feeling it.  I go to the gym normally so I use this dvd on my in-between days.  It's a great way to change things up and prevent boredom in my workout routine.

Happy excersizing!",1173484800,6,1051,4.5132275132275135
5670755,5,B00BSVUED8,"There's a few different reasons why I love this video...

1 - It's actually fun.  Sure before I actually start doing any routine I kinda drudge into it, but as soon as I start moving I love it.  Although I'm not a fan of the music if I were to just hear it on the radio, but for a cardio routine, it's great.  It's bouncy and really let's you get into the dance aspect of turbo jam.

2 - I'm the kind of person who needs to excercise everyday, or I'll just flat out stop.  With this I can do that.  I can do the 45 minute cardio party if I really wanna work out, or simply the 20 minute one if I just wanna keep myself going.

3 - Yea, you lose weight, and you gain and sculpt muscle, but what really surprised me is that it changed my overall body.  I'm a generally muscular person, but this shaped it in a more slender and feminine way.  What got me even more excited was that I used to have broad shoulders, after using turbo jam for only a few weeks, I already saw that they weren't as masculine and line backer-ish.  I feel comfortable in dresses and tank tops because I'm not self conscious about my shoulders anymore.

4 - I've become happier with myself.  Sure I look better which helps, but it seems that since turbo jam is a lot of dancing and taebo-esque moves, I'm more flexible and more, I suppose loose, is the only other word to describe it.  Basically, I'm not as stiff.

5 - And come on, nobody can say a good endorphine rush after excercising doesn't make you happy.  Chalene says on the 20 minute video that this is going to be the best 20 minutes of your day...and at first it sounds cheesy, but it's true.  You feel better after excercising.  and you'll be even happier after seeing how your body changes.

And if that isn't enough, the girl that first told me about turbo jam...so far she's lost 45lbs.  and that doesn't even take into consideration how much muscle she's gained, which as you know, weighs more than fat.

As the been chubby since I was a pre-teen gal now turning into the sexy, comfortable with her self, looking better every day gal...All I can say is buy it.  You won't regret it.",1172793600,47,2121,4.223880597014926
5670756,5,B00BSVUED8,"Turbo Jam is the reason why I lost significant weight for the first time ever!  Chalene makes working out so much fun.  What makes this DVD so great?  Well, there is dancing, kicking, boxing, cardio, and strengthing.  And to top it off.  There isn't some generic music to work out with.  The music was taken from artist like Young MC, GAP Band (Love that Party Train Jam), and other artists, as well.

The workout is so much fun, and you don't have to worry about the public watching you.  You're in the comfort of your own home, and she takes you through the moves.  Chalene keeps the energy high, and she is having a lot of fun on the DVD, too.  You do the routines everyday, you will learn them easily.  They are not difficult at all.

I highly recommend this workout!  Work out whenever you want, no rush, no gym.  Get it and feel good about yourself.",1168214400,27,855,4.329113924050633
5670757,5,B00BSVUED8,"I absolutely love these Turbo Jam workouts.  I lost 10 lbs over the past few weeks as I started doing the Cardio Party work-out (50 minutes) and the Turbo Sculpt (strength training, 40 minutes) about 5 days a week.  I needed to ""jumpstart"" my weight loss plan as I had my 3rd child 8 months ago and had reached a plateau for a few weeks.  When I started Turbo Jam, I quickly lost the weight and started to gain a little muscle.  I could have lost more over the past few weeks, but I didn't follow the eating plan and cheated a few times.  However, I'm still happy because I'm not stuck at that plateau number.  The Turbo Jam workouts are high energy, FUN (with a bubbly instructor, Chalene Johnson) and has a great music selection.  These qualities make me want to workout on a daily basis.",1168128000,18,790,4.333333333333333
5670758,5,B00BSVUED8,"My sister, who is a workout fanatic, just recieved this DVD set as a gift for christmas after endless months of begging. When I saw it, I rolled my eyes and thought...oh god, another giant waste of money. However, I did it for the first time last night...and I absolutely LOVED it! As stated by others, it doesnt feel like you are ""working out"" because really, once you get the moves down, it's all about putting your own twist on it. ""Turbo Time"" (signaled by a blaring siren) is my absolute favorite. It's a minute and a half of high intesity running, dancing, etc. I LOVE this program and will continue to use it. The moves are repititive, but not something that you will get bored with! I plan to keep using this every day because after one night of Cardio Jam and Ab Jam, my body is sore and I can feel it start working already!",1167264000,9,833,4.312101910828026
5670759,5,B00BSVUED8,"This DVD set has 5 workouts. 1) Learn and Burn 25 min), 2) 20-minute workout, 3) Turbo Sculpt(40 min), 4) Cardio Party (45 min), and 5) Ab Jam (20 min).  The DVD set of two has a learn and burn segment which covers learning the 11 moves which are designed for low-impact, high cardio and high ab reduction.  Then there is a workout segment of about 15 minutes on the first burn segment.  The 20 minute full workout is on the same DVD and another segment of a full turbo sculpt workout using hand weights of about 40 minutes is also included.  On the second DVD there is about an approx. 45 minute workout Cardio Party (intensity to high intensity) and then another workout program of approx 20 minutes of a crunching ab and obliques workout.
I started with this program a few weeks ago and have lost pounds and inches in just a few short weeks.  I'm not new to the fitness world and so catching on to these powerhouse workouts wasn't difficult.  I love the fact they are not high impact on the legs and knees.  The moves are animated and hot, but not damaging to your joints.  I continue to use the Cardio Parties, and the Ab Jam routine even in my advanced workouts so don't think this is a lightweight program.  The activity is all intense to high intensity and can be adjusted according to your own abilities.

People have complained that they don't know when Chalene gives the ques for the next sequence - well maybe they need to go back to the beginner steps of the learn and burn segment to get it.  Who cares what the next sequence is called or if Chalene ques it just right?  If I had the sound turned all the way down it wouldn't matter - just watch the moves, do them and lose weight.  JUST DO IT.  It's that simple.  This is a great beginner set with lots of room to grow into advanced workouts such as Cardio Party and the Ab Jam included in this two DVD set.  I do the Ab Jam workout every day as a warm up and then move onto one of the Cardio Party DVD's for the 40-50 minute workout.  Other Cardio workouts by Chalene's Turbo Jam are Cardio Party mix 2, Cardio Party mix 3, and one of my absolute favorites, Punch, Kick, and Jam.  I love the Turbo Jam workouts and me, with an extensive martial arts background, wanted a brightly colored change from the violence of the martial arts.  This workout doesn't remind me of martial arts, even though the moves appear similiar.  It atmosphere is anything but violent and the crew are smiling and upbeat, even through their sweat and althetically trim bodies.  Some of the women in this DVD set are amazing and you can see their personal successes on the extras in this DVD set including Mindy who lost 45 pounds and Ana-Rita who lost 75 pounds.  This is the real thing folks, and you will definitely have fun and lose weight.  It's a wonderful workout program without feeling like I'm in a smelly boxing gym.  I went from a size 7 down to a size 3 in a few short weeks. I'm a size zero now! I love the workouts, the brightly colored background and up beat music and the clean good workout fun of the crew and Chalene.  She's one of the best motivational instructors in the world and gets you going!  See my reviews on other Turbo Jam products.",1165881600,62,3202,4.321608040201005
5670760,5,B00BSVUED8,"I love, love, love this workout.  It's intense, challenging, and motivational.  Chalene does a great job, she's not one of those annoying instructors, who don't workout with you while they ask you to push forward.  The techniques are great and the moves flow from one to the other beautifully.  Initially, it will be hard to follow but that just means you will not get bored with this DVD. The 20 minute workout alone is worth it's weight in gold.  It is supercharged!  You will be sweating and loving every single minute of it. I actually can't wait to do it again the following day.  Unbelievable but true. What's also great is that her sister, and fellow success stories are the participants on the DVD.  This is the real deal folks.  If you want to lose weight the traditional way (healthy lifestyle and fitness) this is for you.  It will get you the results you crave, in just about the time you anticipated.  Like Chalene says--""it's what you put into it!!""  Good luck to all!",1165190400,9,982,4.580459770114943
5670761,5,B00BSVUED8,"I bought the complete set on ebay for $45 this summer after seeing the infomercial a million times on T.V. and have used it everyday since then! Before Turbo Jam, I used SLIM IN 6. And to be honest I found it to be so boring. Watching 3 people do the most boring exercise won't keep you motivated! I've tried so many workouts and nothing has ever been able to keep me going throughout the entire workout, let alone to continue using it on a daily basis like Turbo Jam!

I love Chalene's enthusiasm!! She's great at boosting your energy just when you think you're too tired to continue. I have always been slim, but that's it, just slim. I wanted to put on a little more muscle and tone up. This workout does just that. Not only is the workout fun, but the music is too! There really isn't an easier workout out there. Chalene DOES give enough cues. Once you get into the routine you won't even need her to tell you what's next. Predictable, but not boring!

************************************************************************

Learn & Burn - This segment of the set will help you learn the moves you'll need in all the workouts.

20 Minute Workout - When I first started this program, it was key to do the 20 minute workout and gradually build up the energy and ability to do the other workouts. After you're well into the program, the 20 minute workout becomes the workout you use most when you're short on time. The moves are easy and fun!

Cardio Party - Now this is where the fun is at it's best! My favorite part of Turbo Jam is the Cardio Party workout. It definitely gets your heart rate going, but not too much. You'll sweat and burn tons of calories! It's full of kicks, punches, squats and other movement which is great! It's definitely helped me build up the strength I needed in my arms, legs, and abs. It also features the best music!

Turbo Sculpt - Once you've started to build up muscle, you'll need to sculpt them to look lean, toned, but not bulky. When I first started this workout, I had trouble in my knees and shoulders. I was shaky and fatigued. Time builds strength and that's what is most important! Turbo sculpting is slow and less energetic than the other workouts, which is the whole idea. Features my favorite cast member Bryan Wangen ;)

Ab Jam - My other favorite of the set. I love working on my abs and this workout is wonderful for doing so. I enjoy the floor part best, partly because I feel it most. Though the standing abs section is great for your obliques and entire core! Also features my favorite cast member Bryan Wangen ;)

************************************************************************

For beginners, modification isn't a problem. Everything is broken down and soon or a later you'll be a pro! I do this workout in a small room, so there is no need for lots of space. Chalene motivates you all the way through which is awesome! I can't wait to try the new Turbo Jam Maximum Results. Overall, I couldn't recommend this workout more if I wanted to! It's the perfect workout.",1164758400,35,3032,4.589648798521257
5670762,5,B00BSVUED8,"I had to write a review of Turbo Jam after reading through the negative ones. The main negative comment was that there aren't enought cues... I have 5 TJ DVD's and yes, each one is super challenging. The first time you do a new DVD it can be complicated, you might miss one or two steps. But after the second or third time, you got it! I can do them all with the music ""pumped"" (Chalene isn't as loud, the music is). Even when you are just learning the workout, you still sweat like crazy.

I've been Turbo Jammin' for about 3 months and I haven't looked this good in a really long time. My advice is: do the learn and burn and really learn it then move on. Every workout uses the same basic things just in different combos. Enjoy!",1163635200,6,731,4.184397163120567
5670763,4,B00BSVUED8,"This workout is another great one for those who need to gradually get in shape. It is built off of 11 moves and you are able to progress into togher workouts, instead of just being thrown into something you can't do. She is a great leader and these DVD's have the potential to help you lose weight! The only cons I have are 1) the music isn't as great as they build it up to be 2) somtimes you can get lost in the routine and moves. Of course, number 2 can be solved over time as you get used to the workouts. The greatest thing...the timer at the bottom of the workout. It lets you know how long you have left in the current segment of moves, as well as in the entire workout! Definitely a good workout to add to a healthy eating routine if you're trying to lose weight!",1160870400,15,771,4.078947368421052
5670764,5,B00BSVUED8,"I can't get enough of Turbo Jam.  I used to be a ""FIRM believer""--someone who only did FIRM workouts--but I definitely love Turbo Jam better because it's a lot of fun and it's empowering.  The FIRM definitely works, but Turbo Jam's better.

I'm asthmatic, so I have to admit that when I first bought the Turbo Jam DVD from Beachbody itself, I was a little intimidated.  I was willing to try it--and get my money back if I didn't like it--but yeah, I was a little scared at first.  I didn't know if I'd be able to keep up, but I felt I had to try anyway.  Once I got the DVD's in the mail and started those workouts, though, I haven't regretted the switch to these workouts and I'm sure not looking back. :D

As an asthmatic (and because I have weak knees) I have to do the low intensity workouts.  I still get a real workout, and I sweat like crazy, so the exercises are still challenging to me.  I have to admit that when I first started out with Turbo Jam, I thought that everyone was a little crazy, at least, in the workouts.  It's like what other critics of these workouts has said, either here or in other fitness video review websites.  Charlene Johnson looks like a grown-up Buffy.  Ana-Rita (sp?), one of the workout people, looks kinda scary to me.  Intimidating.  Mindy, another workout person, overacts a lot.  Then again, so does a lot of Charlene's ""crew.""  But it's all in good fun, I feel.  I mean--what else are you supposed to do while you're kicking and punching at air like some crazy person who's watched one too many kung fu movies? :P  One of the great things about ""Turbo Jam,"" though, is that Charlene makes it clear that it's okay to have fun and it's okay to be at least a little silly and/or sexy while working out.  There's no need to take yourself too seriously when doing these workouts.  Charlene and her crew don't, either, so why should we?  Nothing wrong with that, as long as you make sure you have a good time while you workout.

Onto the workouts themselves.  They're a lot of fun, but they truly make you work hard.  What I really love about Turbo Jam is that you're not obligated to do a single bit of ab work on the floor.  The core, abs and obliques get worked hard through most, if not all of these workouts.  (Speaking of which, let me make a suggestion here.  Even if you're experienced with exercise, I really suggest you start out small when you do ""the wheel.""  I got ambitious my first time out because I felt I was in good enough shape, since I was just getting off the FIRM, but nope...my obliques were really in pain the day after I first tried out the ""learn and burn"" workout.  So yeah--even if you think you can do the expert stuff right off the bat, don't.  Just try the low-intensity workout first, especially if you're not used to kicking, till you get the hang of things.)  The only thing I don't like about them is the recommended exercise schedule that comes with them.  Basically, you're supposed to do these workouts five days straight per week, according to the schedule I got with my DVD set from Beachbody.  With the FIRM, I could get away with exercising three days a week.  Not so with Turbo Jam.  Then again, another one of the drawbacks to the FIRM is that they don't seem to offer too many 20-30 minute workouts.  A lot of what they've put out over the past few years is about 40-60 minutes long, judging from what I've got in my FIRM workout library.  But this Turbo Jam DVD comes armed with a 20-minute workout, which is what I rely on a lot.  And Beachbody itself offers plenty of extra 30 minute Turbo Jam workouts, so that's helpful too--not so inconvenient and/or painful when it comes to getting that exercise in for the day.

In short--Turbo Jam rocks.  I'm so glad I gave this DVD a try.  It was really worth it for me. :)",1160179200,13,3802,4.34375
5670765,3,B00BSVUED8,"Turbo Jam may work, but I just really couldn't stand Chalene Johnson!  She is just obnoxious!  I hated the music even though that is one of the special selling features.

I also have a treadmill and exercise bike at home.  NONE of them compare to Turbo Jam.  I have been doing Turbo Jam 5 days a week for one month straight now, and not only have I lost 12 pounds, tightened my abs and developed nicely sculpted arms (WITHOUT changing my diet) but I have YET to find myself bored with it, nor do I see myself getting bored of it any time soon.

3 days a week I do the Cardio Party with is a 40 minute workout.  2 days a week I do the Turbo Sculpt which is a challenging 40 routine with weights, plus I do the 20-minutes Ab Jam when I am done with Turbo Sculpt.  After each workout I am always sweating, always energized, and always feeling like I'm ready to conquer the world.

My husband and I BOTH do Turbo Jam, and he has also experienced fantastic results and loves the routines (and Charlene).  Finally, a workout that we both enjoy, both see great results from, and are both dedicated to!  Highly recommended!",1159142400,33,1113,4.338164251207729
5670768,3,B00BSVUED8,"On sundays when I would see turbo jam being advertised I thought it looked fun. So I ordered the DVD's from amazon because the actual product from the turbo jam site was to high for me. The DVd is okay but not like how I thought. There are 11 moves she teaches you which you feel silly at first doing them and they look even funnier when the instructor is doing them but then there are the other moves she does through out that you have to just pick up on. I didn't know she actually used weights on the DVD so now I have to go buy some because I thought it was all aerobics dancing. The music is not as good as they made it seem. I do like the bar at the bottom that tells you how long you have been working out so I don't have to pause  to run to the clock. It does make you sweat and I don't mind doing it but I wouldnt recommend this to someone who doesn't learn fast. They move pretty quick considering there might be some people who are beginners.

 Sometimes it can be confusing trying to throw the punch at the same time they are because the camera is jumping from person to person one who is doing low intensity and one who is doing high. I would think of this as a low boot leg intensity dance Tae bo without billy blanks.",1159056000,7,1232,4.0
5670769,3,B00BSVUED8,"Over all I like the Cardio Party Segment better than some of the workout segments. The music is better than most workout videos and the moves are good. Learn and burn is not too difficult to follow.  However, once you get to the 20 min workout Chalene doesn't give you a lead in count or cue you very much for the next move.  When you are trying to follow along with her combination moves the camera pans away from Chalene and then zooms in on someone in the back doing the high impact version or the low impact.  You get lost during the combination because the camera is shifting the focus away from Chalene while she is doing the move.  Sometimes it zooms in on various cast members and you can't see what the move is supposed to look like. If you have been using the video for a good while that would be fine but while you are trying to learn it is frustrating. The Cardio Party is better and she doesn't have so many combinations. It focuses on the 11 signature moves but there again she doesn't give quite enough cuing for new users and the camera pans around and zooms in and out a little more than is necessary. I don't care for all the special material that shows her blasting her kids out of the car with loud music. It plays between segments whether you want it to or not. Just a little interview about how she got into fitness would have been enough.",1157760000,63,1361,4.263565891472868
5670770,4,B00BSVUED8,"This is a great workout in terms of a beginner or moderatly  fit person.  For people who are really in shape, I think Chalene needs to come up with more advanced, challenging and longer sets.

I've much heard so much hype about this, I guess I expected more.  The music is good, not great.  The routines are very good, but her cues should be done before she changes up, not during or after.  Until you get used to the quick changes, its difficult to follow.  On one dvd her singing & comments get hard to listen to over and over again.

On the plus side, even though I don't sweat alot to this, it is fun and you don't really feel like you're exercising.  I wish the workouts were longer though.  I like a solid 60 minute workout, so I always have to add 2 or 3 workouts together.  Since I've been doing Taebo for awhile, I appreciate not being scolded during the program (as Billy would often stop and do for a minute or two; although Taebo is a much harder workout).  Chalene is positive and encourages doing it ""your way"" because its your workout and I do like that.  I hope she makes more advanced workouts with more availability to purchase it.  It is great to mix with other workouts.",1157673600,18,1190,4.301801801801802
5670771,5,B00BSVUED8,"I'm a dancer and have to keep fit but no one hates exercising more than me- so am I glad I found Turbo Jam! I have tried everything from Tae Bo to Kathy Smith to Carmen Electra's fit to strip (I only recommend Disc 2- there is nothing tiring or fat-burning with the other 3 discs) but after a week or two they became workouts that I DREADED and got very bored of. Not only did the workouts feel gruelling but there was a point when I just said ""this is not fun anymore"" and as a result I kept putting my workouts off. But never again, thanks to Turbo Jam! Instead of obsessing about food, this workout actually has you obsessing about how fun it is to workout. It gets your heart-pumping and gets you sweating without constantly thinking about how tired you are or how much your thighs and abs are burning and how you've had enough for the day- or the week for that matter (after about 20-30 mins of Tae Bo this is how I always felt. Tired with no energy left- and worst of all BORED. Which leads to being discouraged when you have no drive whatsoever to finish your workouts). Turbo Jam just feels like dancing.. if you've done any hiphop or belly dancing thats how it feels like but with a lot more cardio. You're sweating and you can feel your muscles getting worked but you don't even notice how much your heart is pumping until after the workout and you can fully feel your whole body and be like ""hey, i'm out of breath but i didn't even notice!"".. thats because its FUN.

From my experience it is so rare to find a workout that didn't feel like the LONGEST 30 mins of my life and became gruelling and very discouraging because all those kicks just sucked the life out of you.. but turbo jam got me doing these same high kicks and crunches and punches and those 30-40mins just literally FLEW BY without me wanting to stop and skip any parts of the workout. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS. Particularly for those who are looking to shed some pounds because the cast members are actual customers who lost weight (Anna Rita looks AMAZING) and not super super ripped fitness models like in other workout videos.

One of my dear friends had been hyping it up (didn't beleve her). Saw the infomercial (Remembered I got bored and annoyed with Beach Body ""Slim In 6"").

I love Turbo Jam. I am that woman like a lot of us trying to get rid of the baby fat and stay healthy with a hectic schedule. I look forward to waking up to JAM. Here's what I love.

-In the book you have day to day of which workout to use to get accustomed to workouts

-Every workout has great music, nothing but fun, and lose weight at the same time.

-Charlene is SOOO motivating. Not annoying, has you do the same amount on each side, and encourages you through the whole workout. Also at the end of one of the workouts it tells you about her which makes her even more human (like the average woman).

If you have doubts, DONT have any. It is the BEST at home workout DVD series EVER!!!

I plan to order the other DVD in the series to continue to JAM for the rest of my day's.

5670773,5,B00BSVUED8,"When I first played the ""Learn & Burn"" section I thought Chalene was a bit 'hoky'.  After running through the whole DVD including the extras I realized she's really genuine and is having a great time with her 'team'. The moves are really easy to master and have a bit of danciness to them which makes it lots of fun. The 20 Minute Burn is a fast, sweaty workout and the 45 minute CardioParty is a challenge for this 50-yr old. The Ab Jam is 20 minutes with 10 min standing and 10 floor work. It's so easy to tailor your workout according to your time/energy. There's also Turbo Sculpt which is all strengthening. That's great because you can alternate cardio with strengthening for optimum results. I've since purchased other 'Jam' videos starring Chalene as her claims of fast results have been true for me!",1156982400,10,808,4.572413793103448
5670774,5,B00BSVUED8,"I agree with a previous reviewer.. I watched the infomercial one morning and thought Charlene would be really annoying in the Kathy Smith kind of way but once I started watching the Learn and Burn workout I found her to be really motivational. She's not annoying at all. She's one of those ""cool"" gym instructors you want to talk to after the class because you want to get more information on how to perfect moves and just hear her story. Believe me, I was surprised as I ususally hate perky/bouncy gym bunnies.

I loved this video because:

- This is a true workout. Before you know it you will be drenched in sweat. Make sure to have a towel nearby.

- Charlene breaks down the moves very well and makes you feel like you can do the entire workout to completion without feeling overwhelmed.

- The movements are easy to modify.

- You don't need to utilize a lot of space in the room to effectively do the workout. This is a big plus for me in an apartment.

- You don't need weights or other accessories to participate 100% in all of the movements.

- You will not get bored easily. There is a lot of variety in the movements.

- You are engaging your abs practically the entire time.

- This workout will not impact your joints in the same way kickboxing normally does because Charlene focuses on proper alignment and reminds you throughout the workout to realign.

You have to do the Learn and Burn and get the moves down in order to get the full effect.  There are other tapes on the website in addition to these.  I plan on getting those as well.

5670777,4,B00BSVUED8,"Let me start off by saying I was pretty skeptical about the infomercial.  Could it really burn off all those calories like it said?  The answer YES!

Got it in the mail, popped it in and next thing you know I'm dripping sweat.  Sounds nasty I know but what a work-out!  I definately got my money's worth.  If you never excercised before or it's been a long time since you have, then you definately have to do the Learn and Burn.  Once you have those moves down, move on to the 20 min. workout.  I have yet to do the other 3 workouts, but I just started so I'll pace myself.

I don't like cheezy which I thought this workout would be, but I was quite surprised.  Try it, I don't think you'll be disappointed.  One thing though, you have to listen for the cues or else you'll get lost.",1155254400,16,783,4.153333333333333
5670778,5,B00BSVUED8,"I have always liked the feel of my body when I exercise but making the time has been a problem.  And Cardio....it's just not my cup of tea....until Turbo Jam!  Not only do you have a blast doing the workout, you hear the music playing over and over in your mind causing you to WANT to workout...actually looking forward to working out and missing it when you don't get to.

Chalene is a blast as are the other Jammers....the energy is contagious.  With Learn & Burn anyone can take it as slow as they need to, learning all the main moves before going at it full tilt.  And as has been mentioned in other posts there are two Jammers that do Low Impact Modifications of every move.

I have lost over 20 lbs doing these workouts alone.  With each new release in this series you build up and have fun at the same time.

If you are a little crazy, have a great sense of humor, love good music and like to move it, this workout is for you!!  It is definitely something I think everyone should try....we all don't like the same things but in my book this workout is a winner all the way around!

I've tried them all, Taebo, The Firm, Walk off the Pounds, etc.  None of them compare to the type of results you'll get from doing TurboJam.  Like other customers have said, you don't feel like you're working out - you're enjoying the routine as well as the music and by the time you realize it, the workout is over and you're doing the cool down!  It's amazing.  I've now been doing TJ for about three months and I still look forward to getting up in the morning and doing the routine (unlike other workouts).

Since starting TJ I've lost 35 pounds.  I've gotten my hourglass figure back as well (YEAH!).  All of the workouts on this program are great, along with the music.  I especially love doing the 40 minute Turbo Sculpt after doing the 20 minute Turbo Jam - that routine will literally melt your fat away.  The 20 minute Ab Jam is fantastic too.  The arabic-type music during the floor routine is awesome.

I've just order Chalene's 3T workout and can't wait to get started on that one.

I had these videos for about two months before even trying them. They were in my, One day I will do it, pile. Well, last Monday, I decided to try it out. After all; I have read so many reviews on how people lost weight and felt better and so on. This is by far the best workout video I have EVER tried. I have been workout almost every day since. I took off 1 day in a week and a half! I'm not even doing it to lose weight anymore. I really just like the way I feel afterwards.

I decided to pop in my Tae Bo DVD the other day, just to switch things up. I had to shut it off about 5 minutes through. I was bored! I popped in Turbo jam and finished my workout.

Chalene Johnson is REAL with an amazing soul and is there with you every step of your journey so you don't feel you are in it alone. You will be hooked.

I've never been a fan of kickboxing and I'm the type who will buy many exercise DVDs, try them out for 2-3 days and never pick them back up.  Turbo Jam is completely different.  I actually miss doing the workouts.  Ms. Johnson keeps your motivation high along with your heart rate.  She's energetic along with the back-up gang. Charlene is easy to follow (eventhough I haven't gotten the twist down yet).  My only complaint is that you can't always follow Mindy or Ana-Rita for the low impact portion.

All-in-all, this is a great workout and I've already lost 8 lbs with another 20 to go.

This has left me with very little time. I also wanted to try it after hearing all the fuss.

I really break a sweat with the cardio parties; the 20 min workout is fair; fat blaster is a good quick workout. I think the best workout is Lower Body Sculpt (not on this DVD). I never like working out my legs but I have enjoyed this workout and it BURNS. The other thing I appreciate is that the people in the video are sweating too! I have had ""cardio"" videos before where no one is sweating and I feel like I might as well have been sitting on the couch; this is not one of those.

I don't know if it beats running, but it does work different muscles and I think Chalene does a good job of motivating you and reminding you to push yourself and not just go through the motions.",1151884800,22,1039,4.088235294117647

5670788,5,B00BSVUED8,"Turbo Jam is awesome! I was an avid runner of 6 miles a day, which caused me to lose a ton of weight. I loved it but my knees couldn't handle it. Since I'm young I needed something that exerted a lot of energy. I tried yoga, and a lot of other strengthening techniques but they didn't work. I saw Turbo Jam one Saturday morning and decided to try it out. The commercial said, ""1000 calories in an hour!"" That's what I needed to hear!

My first episode, I woke up very sore. I was shocked because ""I'm a runner and we can accomplish all things!"" Yeah Right! Chalene kicked my [...]. I've been doing Turbo Jam for a few months now and it really works with my schedule. I never really have time for the Cardio Party but I do the :20 mins workout every morning and evening. And when I have time I add the ""burn"" portion of the ""Learn & Burn"".

This work out is for everyone. All ages, all sizes! My abs have been flat but NEVER toned... until now! My legs were in good shape but now they're very defined. AND GET THIS... I haven't picked up a single weight and my arms are SO toned. (I do a like 10 pushups after every workout.)

It's true: ""the more energy you put into it, the more you get out."" Even though I've been doing it for months, over time I have increased my energy input (jump a little higher, swing a little harder, etc.) and I still get sore.",1150156800,44,1353,4.117424242424242

TJ practices similar concepts so i'm sure that it will work as well as taebo.

Anyway, back to TJ. I tried the BURN workout and got the hang of it after two tries then i moved onto the 20 minute workout but it was far too complicated. i was hoping that they'd include more variations of simple workouts for beginners. I felt that there was a huge gap between BURN and 20 MINUTE workouts. Anyway, I wish I purchased the DVD through Amazon because i'm now paying about $70 (including s&h) through the TJ original site. If you want less complicated form of TJ, get Billy blanks taebo collection (1999) which includes the 8-Minute workout. it's too bad they don't sell the 8 minute on its own.

5670792,5,B00BSVUED8,"You have to keep doing it!  I watched this informercial for months before finally caving.  I looked up many, many reviews online and I have seen almost no negative feedback.

I love the music:  There's none of that horrible canned 80s Muzak-with-drumtrack you find in so many workout DVDs.  It's all clubby, highly danceable music; I'm sure it would be even more fabulous if you're lucky enough to have a good home theater/stereo system.

Chalene is just as peppy and cute as you'd expect, but she is by no means the ""cheerleader"" type.  She does push, and she does encourage.  But throughout the workouts you'll catch a glimpse of the Chalene you don't see very much in the infomercial:  sassy, goofy and maybe a little bawdy (but not at all in an off-putting way).  She's truly a wonder to behold, and entirely likeable:  you don't ever get the sense that she's a phony.

I loved kickboxing, but after a while I developed a raging case of plantar fasciitis and couldn't continue kicking with a wave bag.  This workout delivers a lot of hard-kicking, tough-punching fun but with none of the physical contact you might find in a traditional kickboxing workout.  You also get a lot of dancy moves, which mixes things up and makes for a much more interesting workout.

I've purchased many workout DVDs and videos over the years, and I have never found one that really pumped me up like this.  It's a ball to do, and although I've only just started my third week on the program, I'm finding my pants looser, my muscles tighter and my mood lifted.

I've tried other beachbody workouts, but this one is by far my favorite.  I do Turbo Jam everyday and love it!  I never used to love to exercise, but now that I've found something I love, exercise is not drudgery.

One of the nice things about it is that the workout can be more or less intense by whatever degree of intensity you want.  If you are just getting started moving, you can do the slower workouts such as Burn, or the 20-Minute Jam before heading into Cardio Party.

I wish I could put 10 stars instead of just 5.  I would highly recommend this workout to just about anyone.  I have shown it to several friends (done the workout with them) and they have all bought the DVDs.  I haven't shown it to one person that didn't love it.

I was most into the idea of the standing ab workout and the music and I must say the DVD's deliver on both counts!

The cast looks like they are working out and having a good time. Its an effective, fast paced workout and you don't need any fancy add-on's. All in all a great workout to get you up and moving.

5670800,5,B00BSVUED8,"Cardio Party was the first Turbo Jam video I've tried.  I was looking for a fun kickboxing workout, and overall, I was not disappointed. The workout wasn't as dancey as I had expected--there are occasional brief interludes where you are encouraged to move to your own beat--but the entire atmosphere is more akin to a dance club than to a workout studio.

This workout is about 43 minutes long, and I realy liked how it was broken down: each chapter is a 6-7 minute segment that is separately choreographed, so once you are done with that segment, you move on to a new routine. I have provided an overview for the moves contained in each segment below (times are approximate, and I didn't necessarily include *every* move):

Warm-Up, 4 minutes. Charlene begins by warming you up with each of the 4 basic punches (jab, cross, hook, upper) and simple side steps. A few moving stretches are included towards the end.

1st cardio segment, 7 minutes. As with most of the segments, you'll learn two combinations which you then connect together. The first combination consists of ""wheel"" (a standing side crunch) combined with cross and hook punches. This combo connects to a march with alternating knee lifts and then double knee lifts to either side; at the end, Chalene changes the march to a jog.

2nd cardio segment, 7.5 minutes. The first combination here consists of a partial squat to either side; side kicks are then added to the squat. Building on this, you'll do the squat/side kicks, then squat front and back, add front/back push kicks, and then add knee lifts with front/back push kicks. Last comes a move Chalene calls a ""twist""--you'll move front with jab-cross-jab punches and then do a knee lift, first just on the one side but then on both sides with arms added in. The entire sequence is then repeated to the other side.

3rd cardio segment, 7.5 minutes. You'll start here with speed bag, adding an upper cut to the end of the move and then adding a front knee/back kick. After doing two knees to either side, you'll add in ""Tai"" punches--slow punches and blocks to the front while in ""horse"" stance (straddle squat).

Turbo, 1.5 minutes. For the turbo, a siren goes off and you kick up the intensity, doing jogs and hopping knee lifts. However, two of the women in the large class always do a low-impact version of the moves.

Water break, 30 seconds. Following the Turbo, there is a pause allowing you to get a drink of water, although Chalene encourages you to keep moving during this time.

Recovery Dance Party, 6 minutes (but for some reason, this segment continues partly into the next chapter). I didn't really notice much difference between this and the other cardio segments; after a brief freestyle dance at the very beginning, Chalene moves back into kickboxing combinations. Here, she does cross, hook, and uppercut punches to one corner, speed bags to repeat in the opposite corner, and then does ""zig zag"" knees--basically, a side crunch combined with a knee lift to one side; eventually, a back kick is added on as well.

Final cardio segment, 4 minutes. This is a quick segment performed entirely in horse stance. First, you do a front speedbag followed by quick cross punches. Staying in horse stance, you do a high-low punch to the side, then add zig zag knees; for the last couple of reps, Chalene does a hop when doing the knee lift.

Aerobic cool-down, 3 minutes. Chalene describes the moves in this section as ""finesse."" There are some arm swings to the front plus some low front and back kicks, but everything is performed at a slower, more relaxed pace.

Stretch, 1.5 minutes. Here, Chalene borrows from Tai Chi and talks about focusing your energy; she does just a few very brief stretches such as a hamstring stretch.

Overall, this is a high-intenstiy workout that is mostly low-impact--there are a few jacks/hops thrown in here and there, but as previously mentioned, two of the participants always show funky, low-impact alternatives. The mood of this workout is definitely high energy, and the music is loud and upbeat, with a few recognizable songs (eg, a very fast version of ""Busta Move""). Also, there is a countdown bar at the bottom of the screen which lets you know how much time is left in the current segment as well as previews the upcoming moves. If you enjoy kickboxing but are looking for a style that's more fun and funky than serious, this might be the perfect video for you.

Additional comments about the instructor:  Chalene is clearly enthusiastic and has a ton of energy. She makes frequent comments to say that she *knows* you are having fun, and there are several points where she bursts out singing along to the moves. I would say that she's pretty over-the-top, but I didn't find her to be annoyingly so.

You may have heard that Charlene's cueing is poor; she actually *does* cue, but I wasn't always sure what she was talking about. For example, she cued ""twist,"" which turned out to be a punching move.  If I had done her ""Learn and Burn"" video first, I'm sure I would have found it much easier to follow along with this workout, but as it was, I was able to pick up the combinations pretty quickly the very first time through.",1142812800,424,5197,4.6996699669967
