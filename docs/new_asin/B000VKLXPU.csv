8327891,5,B000VKLXPU,"I am 33 yrs old and mother of 2 little ones. I Love a variety of different workouts, you get kickboxing, pilates, aerobics, core training, and muscle conditioning. I have 2 other DVD's of Shelly's and recently bought this set.  They are great, especially now having a limited amout of time.  Her sessions are about 20 min.ea, not too difficult and I feel the burn the next day.  The beautiful green scenery, makes you feel like your there in Barbados.  Need that especially now with this long ugly cold weather.  These DVD's are my sanity! I would recommend these to anyone of all ages, not too difficult or painful, it's up to you how hard you want to work.",1268697600,,658,4.495798319327731

I'm a little bit disapointed cause now it's 15 minutes aerobic routines instead of a full 20 workout in the previous Caribbean Workout's dvds.",1201392000,2,162,5.230769230769231
