8713121,2,B00WFHTXQI,"This is the story of some rappers in Philadelphia? who want to make it big but can't get their music played one the radio, although I didn't think the story was before the Internet where everyone has a chance to go viral. The rappers use cool names like ""Special K"" and ""Lil Dash"" and perform mediocre if not bad rap music until the final production. This doesn't appear to be related to the 80's song ""Change the Beat.""

The acting was bad. The sound was terrible. You would think if you are making a film about music you would have decent microphones and folks who would know how to use them. The outdoor sound was very choppy. In the middle of the film we have two plain clothes police officers investigating the ""playground incident"" although most of their conversation was missed due to the sound track. After this appearance, they never appear in the film again.

They were still using ""Do you feel me"" which went out of style a few years back. Apparently it was just making its way to Philly. Stick with Atlanta urban films to keep up.
