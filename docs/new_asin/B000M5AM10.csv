8166388,5,B000M5AM10,Do I really have to rate every little thing that I buy online?  This is getting to be excessive and annoying.,1386028800,,109,4.190476190476191
8166389,3,B000M5AM10,"This is a very interesting documentary and the original footage is fascinating.  However, my quibble is that this content is available for free download on the Internet in a number of places and I didn't find this out until after I bought this.  The fact that it is on a DVD-R should have clued me in. There are some internet sellers who download and resell free public domain video and audio and I'm surprised that Amazon does this too.",1374710400,4,437,4.518987341772152

8166392,1,B000M5AM10,This dvd is in PAL format and I live in the U.S. It was never mentioned in product detail that it was in PAL format. It would have been nice to know so I wouldn't have wasted my money. I would rate the video but I can't watch it. Thanks a million...,1346544000,6,249,3.8076923076923075
