1661339,5,B00005TNSI,"I don't know much about fly fishing, but I do know about good education. I found this DVD to be excellent. After reading a negative review, it compelled me so much that I wanted to write a few words recommending the video. I was looking at fly fishing books and came across ""The Complete Idiot's Guide to Fly Fishing"". Now that I have seen this DVD, I have no need to pick up any other books. For me, this video makes a fly fishing book seem weak in comparison. Remember the old saying; a picture is worth a thousand words.

What first comes to mind is a word from the title of the video: ""basics"".  In a nutshell, this is what the video does well because it is supposed to be a basic fly fishing video for beginners. I am a beginner in fly-fishing and don't know hardly anything about the sport. I have fished before but fly-fishing was always a mystery to me. Well, this video solved that problem very quickly. Concisely, this is a basic course in fly-fishing that is taught from the ground up.

The video starts out with Basic Casting Techniques then moves into Knots. From the beginning I learned a lot, there is a cast called the Roll Cast and this is essentially what most of the other casts are built upon. What is so beautiful about this DVD is how simply they teach about fly-fishing. It can be very hard to find good instructors for any subjects that are able to teach, and teach well. Kelly & Jim Watt as commentators and instructors do a spectacular job. The video then moves onto tying knots then to equipment. Progressing further to the advanced techniques, then even how to tie your own flies. This is a broad overview of the DVD. Please check below as I have all the areas outlined on the DVD, which is considerable.

From the video, I also learned about a fish in Argentina called the Dorado or even the Golden Dorado. These fresh water fish put up an amazing fight. The video did a great job of giving me good basic fishing techniques as well, from the DVD ""Lakes, Streams, Rivers & Entomology"". How to look for fish, what bait to use, where to find the fish, different lakes, even fishing for the Dorado. The different types of fly-fishing lines seemed a little mind boggling between all the different types and objectives to what you are fishing.

There are many tricks on the DVD as well. There is even a way to do practice fly-fishing at home. You take the tip of your fly rod and use a long piece of yarn as your line. Set up some objects to aim for and you can let the kids practice at home. And it's fun. Many, if not all of the casting tricks are in the slow motion on the video. The producers really know how to teach people this subject and it shows from the many slow motion & graphic presentations in the video. As I am a quick learner, I found the advanced techniques insightful as well. The whole video flows nicely and only a couple of times I was left scratching my head because I did not understand something, usually from the commentators speaking too quickly.

Overall, I would suggest that the video is mainly for beginner fly-fishers. However, it seems to me to be some intermediate & advanced stuff thrown in as well. I would recommend this video to anyone or even a friend who likes to fish and wants to learn how to fly-fish. Yes, it would make a great gift, pretty much for anybody, any age.

Here is what is contained on the DVD. Happy fishing!

1661340,2,B00005TNSI,The DVD is named as Fly Fishing Basics. I thoutht that it should include many basic techniques before I order it. You will be very disapointed after you watch it. They spent a lot of time to show you casting and making tie. These techniques are not practically used when fishing.,1058572800,7,279,4.490196078431373
1661341,5,B00005TNSI,"This is one of the best fly-fishing instructional DVDs on the market today.  From equipment to entomology, fly vests to fly tying you will have the best resource for improving and refreshing your skills and knowledge.  Jim and Kelley will tune up your casting ability with a view from every angle.  No matter what your expertise or even if you're just starting out in this sport you will be able to learn something useful to make your trip more pleasurable and successful.  There is a great new twist to a classic roll cast that has added yards to my casting ability.  This DVD covers every aspect of this fantastic sport in an orderly and fun fashion to view.  To a fly-fisherman this is what spring training is to a baseball player, a fly-fishing tune up so to speak.  This is one piece of equipment that every fly fisherman should have in his home.  This also makes a great gift for anyone who you know that has an interest in fly-fishing.",1022371200,59,942,4.5
7953634,4,B00005TNSI,I think this is a great little video for learning fly fishing.  I actually got several from our local library and wanted to have this one to go back to.  I you wish to learn to fly fish this is a great place to start.,1409788800,,217,3.8

7953636,5,B00005TNSI,"Great video.  This video covers all the basics for the beginner fly fisherman.  I found it helpful with casting tips, knott tying tips and the verbage needed to understand the fly fishing lingo.  Was very helpful for me.",1334620800,,220,4.7368421052631575
7953637,5,B00005TNSI,"I have been fishing for trout for years, but only decided to learn fly fishing.  It was more difficult to figure out on my own than I expected.  I read a couple of books and tried to figure out the knots, etc. on my own but still wasn't getting it.  This video really helped me.  It is the best thing next to having an instructor with you.
The instructors in the video keep it simple while not treating you like you're stupid.  The instructors are interesting and keep your attention so you don't zone out.  They also don't ""overdo"" it with too much information.  You get just what you need to get started in fly fishing.  If you're an experienced fly fisherman then this probably isn't the video for you, but if you're just starting out, like me, this is a great DVD.",1294876800,,768,4.321678321678322
7953638,3,B00005TNSI,"A basic introduction to fly fishing. But to really get started you'll need to take a lesson or two from an experienced angler and then practice, practice, practice....preferably on the water. Going back and reviewing the tape after experiencing some on-the-water frustrations can be helpful.",1234310400,,291,5.488888888888889
7953639,4,B00005TNSI,"This was a great basic information based learning system. I have no experience in fly fishing and feel that after watching this DVD I now have a basic enough knowledge to purdhuse and start fly fishing. There are basic techniques to advanced techniques. There is a basic blurb on how to tie basic flys, wooly buggers and dry flys. Teh only drawback is there was little on what to look for when you approach a lake or river, there was references to other DVDs by Bill Mart.",1184630400,,472,4.436781609195402
7953640,5,B00005TNSI,"with all of the dvd/vhs videos out there on the market, I found this one to be a great starter video for someone just getting into fly fishing or one that wants to improve their sport.  while some may say that the video spends too much time on casting and tying ... well, that's the art of fishing!!  If you can't cast you're not going to have too much luck in catching!  If you can't tie the necessary knots, well, then you're just going to get a lot of practice in what it feels like to lose a fish (that is, if you even were able to cast the line out!!!!)  All kidding aside, this is a great video and I've watched it many times over and have corrected many of the common mistakes that I have found in my casting or other techniques.  Enjoy!",1169942400,3,744,4.103448275862069
7953641,5,B00005TNSI,"THE DVD IS EXCELLENT, WELL ORGANIZED, IN HD AND PERFECT FOR THE BEGINNER.  I DO NOT KNOW HOW YOU COULD PRODUCE A BETTER INTRODUCTION TO FLY FISHING.",1167782400,3,148,4.481481481481482
7953642,1,B00005TNSI,"The content was not too bad but the visual quality of the video was apalling, fuzzy, you cannot really see the fly lines when they cast, a waste of money.

7953643,5,B00005TNSI,"This is an elegantly straightforward guide that will tell you what you are doing wrong and what you are doing right.  It assumes some foreknowledge of the sport and therefore doesn't condescend.  The friendly but not over-cuddly hosts are painstakingly thorough and not pedantic -- they've inspired me to tie my own flies, even.  I've viewed this over and over.  In the dark of winter, it's the next best thing to being ""out there.""  Highly recommended to those who sincerely wish to improve their knowledge and skills.",1140048000,8,519,4.919540229885057
