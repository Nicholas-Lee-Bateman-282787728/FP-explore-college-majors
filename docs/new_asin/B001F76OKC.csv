3565064,1,B001F76OKC,The DVD I received is a Rodney Yee DVD for a different kind of yoga with a different cover. I bought this as a gift and it was different than what I was expecting. Almost to the point where I think someone in the warehouse put the wrong DVD into the box.,1512691200,,254,3.9038461538461537

3565069,5,B001F76OKC,"Rodney Yee is my second attempt at beginners yoga. The first beginners yoga dvd I purchased was too fast and did not offer pose instruction so while trying to get the right pose the instructor had already moved on to the next exercise. Rodney Yee's DVD is perfect for a beginner like me because it offers a 41 minute pose instruction guide in addition to two easily understood yoga workouts of 20 and 17 minutes, While I always did a daily workout I knew something was missing and after my wife started attending yoga for the past year and showed me a few positions I realized it would give me  benefits I do not get from my regular workout of pushups, sit-ups, crunches, bicycles, leg-ups, etc. I now alternate workouts and have improved my breathing, posture, balance and flexibility thanks to Rodney Yee's DVD.

3565071,1,B001F76OKC,"I had just bought 3 of Rodney's CDs for beginners. Beginner: a person just starting to learn a skill or take part in an activity.
They do not show any modified positions instructions on how the body stretches and how to release point of pressure to obtain these advanced positions they show on all of their CDs that I bought. The CDs are not for beginners they show nothing but advanced poses. I was hoping that they would show how to achieve an advanced pose from a stiff body...you cannot achieve the poses they show as a beginner.",1504137600,3,533,4.448979591836735

3565079,5,B001F76OKC,I absolutely love this yoga dvd.  Rodney Yee is now my favorite Yogi.  He explains the position so well and  this DVD is broke down into sections so you can do the poses as he explains and demonstrates or after awhile just do the poses along with him.,1497484800,,251,4.1875

3565103,5,B001F76OKC,"I love doing yoga. I'm not consistent enough to be very good, so I like this beginners dvd. There are 2 different teachers and two different ""routines"" one for relaxation and one for energizing. It actually is very cool having the two sequences that focus on the two outcomes. I used to do the energizing routine in the morning before work and the relaxation routine after work on another day. I like Rodney as an instructor but not the lady who does the other rountine... just a personal taste.

I do yoga every once in a while now, and this dvd is great to come back to after a long break",1482710400,,590,4.315315315315315

3565109,2,B001F76OKC,"Totally feel ripped off! You might consider this to be yoga for beginners if: You are a retired contortionist from the carney side show. To call this ""Yoga For Beginners"" is like calling Algebra ""Elementary Mathematics"". Sorry Rodney, but I can't sit cross legged and touch the mat in front of me with my forehead or stand on one leg, while bending the other up to my crotch. Why not?, because I'm a beginner. I've never done this before. That's why I ordered ""Yoga for Beginners"". The exercises on the video also change so fast, by the time I get into one, it's time to go to another one. This should be called Intermediate speed yoga.  Will be looking for an actual beginners yoga class to replace this.",1476057600,,705,4.5078125
3565110,4,B001F76OKC,Great guided video series for both beginner and advances yoga practitioners. I purchased these for myself and my spouse for beginning some yoga that we could do at home with the guidance of a well known expert. The videos are great quality and very easy to follow. We have watched and used these videos several times and would highly recommend them to those who are interested in the benefits of yoga -that is like having the instructor right there in the room with you.,1475884800,9,470,4.607142857142857

3565113,2,B001F76OKC,"In my opinion, this DVD is way beyond beginner's level yoga. The poses are extremely difficult especially for someone who is older and has back problems. It was advertised as having instructions for specific poses. Not so. All there is is a vignette is photos set to music. No audible instruction.  This is especially frustrating as the first disc sent was defective and i had to return it and wait one week for a replacement.  I will just stick with my gentle yoga for beginners by Jane Adams.",1473811200,3,494,4.6022727272727275

3565117,4,B001F76OKC,"I've never done formal yoga before but wanted something to help with stress and flexibility at home. This video has two segments that are meant for energizing and winding down. They're fairly short and very easy to fit into your busy schedule. My only complaint is that once you've done these two videos so many times, you wish there were more to be done. I ended up buying another longer video but I really enjoy how easy this is for beginners and how detailed the instructions are so that ANYONE can do yoga from this video.

You can start the yoga routine or choose the option where he shows you how to do each pose the correct way. We chose to do the poses first since we are total beginners. Then we did the routine.

Coming from a guy's perspective, I didn't find it too cheesy. The two routines are easy to follow and for a casual practitioner should be sufficient.

I did the pose guide for a couple weeks before moving to the other practices. I intended to only do yoga two days a week, but as I got into it, I found myself doing it daily. I think the fact that Rodney and Colleen make it so simplified for beginners has really contributed to my enjoyment of and continuation with the practice. I think if I had chosen a less elementary DVD, I would have become frustrated and quit. I'm glad I didn't.

I've also become a big fan of Rodney and Colleen, and I've purchases two other Rodney Yee DVDs.",1442793600,4,678,4.380952380952381

Rodney Yee's core strength DVDs are so important to me to keep my body functioning as well as keeping a good mind/body relationship! I love Colleen and Rodney's am/pm series as well! For newcomers to yoga, I suggest watching the DVDs first to see all the poses first and then trying to do them.

I've had severe back pains (Herniated Disc) for about 2 years now. I was unable to sit properly, walk for minimal amounts of time, stand without losing balance, or even tie my shoes! I was told by my chiropractor that light yoga exercises would possibly help ease my lower and mid Spinal pains. Since starting this basic dvd 2 months ago I'm able to get back on my feet and be more active. My pains aren't fully gone, but if i stay on the right path and do as little as 15mins of yoga 3 times a week I'll be back to 100% health in no time. This dvd is great if your looking to make you body and mind healthier, but at a very basic and easy to follow instruction. Gaiam and Rodney Yee are awesome!

He didn't want to do this alone so I agreed to do it with him. I've done yoga before but its been a few years (and a few kids) since that time. This DVD has two great sessions on it, one for the morning and one for the evening. My husband has found that doing this everyday has alleviated some of his chronic back pain and that to me is a gift beyond words to not see him suffer so much much less to him to not be in so much pain while working. He is currently out of town due to work and has informed me that he is doing some of the moves and the stretch's he learned from this DVD while he is away. Now as for me as I stated I've done yoga before but its been a while. Yoga is an easy workout that I can add and fit into my busy kid filled life whenever I see an opening everyday. This DVD has moves that challenged me at first but as he shows you in it you can make simple adjustments till you can do the full movement or you can do simple things to make it more challenging if its to simple for you. I liked that they were easy moves in this that a beginner like my husband could do, yet moves that I could do even having done yoga before without getting bord. Overall great DVD to have.

3565273,4,B001F76OKC,"Rodney Yee is the best. With that said, it is important to follow the guided and helpful section that demonstrates how to do the poses (asanas). Although it said, (For Beginners),  it is important to watch several times before attempting to do the poses. Always listen to your body's voice, so that you don't start off over doing it. Many people drop Yoga before it has a chance to help your body, primarily because they push their body to the level of pain or injury....Be gentle....start slow. I would recommend Rodney's Backcare Yoga for Beginners......first, since Yoga is all about the breathing and the spine (Back). Hope this review is helpful. Namaste.",1425254400,,660,4.892857142857143

This DVD is okay for me but would be perfect for most people who are used to this style of yoga but it's not for me.  I did get results though when I was using it.  I did the morning energising yoga session but I am very sensitive to stimulating types of spiritual practice (even green tea and things which shouldn't make me that awake) and even had to stop doing a certain kundalini yoga meditation as I couldn't sleep so this is more just my sensitivies, but I couldn't sleep after doing it, even in the morning so there is something to this, it's just not for me.

I have done yoga for awhile and used to teach Pilates, so I thought I had a pretty good grasp on form and posture, but the pose introduction section was so detailed and helpful, it felt like I had a personal 40 minute-long instruction section.
I love Yoga instruction done by people who understand Yoga for what it is and not done by a company who is pumping out Yoga DVDs as a fitness fad. This definitely is done by instructors who appreciate Yoga and are passing it on to others.
Again, I've done yoga and understand it on some level, but I wouldn't even call this just for beginners, I'd say it's just very foundational.

After the detailed pose instruction the DVD offers two 30-40min yoga sequences, which are long enough to get a stretch, but won't take an hour.

Instead he picks another yoga instructor who can lay on her back, draw her knees up and put them on the ground by her ribs.  Come on, as a beginner I felt so intimidated.  I would rather watch him TEACHING ANOTHER BEGINNER.  DUH, what is the point in having someone who has done this for years teach me what I can accomplish, maybe, in 2 - 3 years?

I learned a lot just from that and felt prepared for the morning and evening workouts. I researched for days, reading many reviews, about many different beginning yoga programs. I am glad I chose this one!",1394409600,,519,4.591397849462366

3565419,5,B001F76OKC,I purchased several beginning yoga tapes and this is my third favorite..........rodney takes the time to explain the moves which i like and takes time for you to breathe and relax with each one but these workouts were just a tad boring to me..........i prefer the 10 minute solutions yoga version to this one but still will use this one here and there.......its just not my favorite.........,1393632000,,391,4.850746268656716
3565420,5,B001F76OKC,"The instruction is GREAT! That's why I purchased this. But, it would have been a bit over my head as a true beginner. I consider myself an advanced beginner and benefit from the instruction portion immensely. Doing it again and again!",1393459200,2,234,4.7317073170731705

This would be great for anyone with joint or back limitations.,1393459200,3,353,4.555555555555555

Rodney Yee seems very knowledgeable about yoga, it's just a little too much for me to get off my butt and follow along.  I'd watch this more but it's like watching an old tv show, you've seen it a couple of times and you know how it's going to end.  Me laying on the floor wondering what I ever did to make my leg hurt like that.",1393027200,3,418,3.8941176470588235

Problem (for me)  is that he moves too fast.  I would like a few more seconds in each pose.",1391990400,,268,3.8181818181818183
3565427,5,B001F76OKC,"I am a beginner, and by that I mean I have never practiced yoga before. I bought this DVD hoping I could learn the poses well enough to learn on my own. Let me say, the pose guide is an excellent tutorial and I really enjoyed the way they explained what NOT to do and how to correct it. Loved it! The pose guide is an exercise in itself, since they are all new positions to me and my body isn't used to them yet. There are two other guides in this DVD, one led by Rodney Yee and the other by Colleen Saidman. Both are good, but I like Rodney's version better. I feel like he explains the movements better. Each video also has different options for voice overs - so if you want the ""spiritual"" voice over (you are like a tall tree, reaching towards the heavens) or the pose only instructions you can choose whatever suits you the best :).",1391644800,32,837,4.141104294478527
3565428,3,B001F76OKC,"Perhaps I'm spoiled by Rodney Yee's other videos, but the dual instructional approach of this video does not lend itself to Yee's usual calm, clear style I have come to appreaciate.  This dvd presentation of basic yoga positions feels robotic, fast-paced and in detail overdrive.  Basic yoga instruction becomes a complex lesson of breaking down each pose into ""how to"" and ""how not to"" steps -which after two poses become overwhelming.  It is possible to gain from this dvd, if the viewer breaks down the video into digestable bites.",1391558400,,534,4.977528089887641

The instruction portion makes the movements really clear and the tips and reminders to breathe keep you going. Being busy and knowing I will not do anything longer than 30 minutes on a regular basis, this DVD makes it difficult to talk yourself out of doing.",1391212800,2,371,4.470588235294118

Mr Yee has truly helped me start up my yoga again after having had a bad fall and I have tried others, but this one video has given me the confidence to become more flexible and stronger in my poses. Rodney has the added benefit  of  a soothing and beautiful voice which is so needed when oneis engaged in yoga. As soon as  I feel stronger with this wonderful video and the added perks of gorgeous scenery I will buy his next  advanced video. I highly recommend  this for beginners and all yoga interested persons. Soothing and calming as well as a hearty workout. Many thanks to Rodney Yee and his excellent female yoga instructor.",1391040000,,665,4.418032786885246
3565431,5,B001F76OKC,"This particular cd made me fall in love with yoga.  There is a feeling of peacefulness, as they both guide you step by step.  They talk you through it all and once you learned the correct way to do the poses, you can do the ones without their instructions.  I have lupus and autoimmune disease that affects the muscles and major organs, joints and more.  Most times my body is in pain, however, doing this cd helps relax those muscles.  In the morning it first relaxes and then gives a feeling of energy.  In the evening it helps the body to unwind and prepare for sleep.  Thanks Rodney.",1390780800,2,587,4.37962962962963
3565432,2,B001F76OKC,"I wasn't a fan of this DVD. Rodney's instructions aren't detailed enough for a complete novice (which is what I was when I first purchased this DVD), so you end up having to look up at the screen in the middle of a pose to figure out what you're supposed to be doing. Unfortunately, this means you miss setting yourself up for the next pose. He doesn't hold the poses for very long either, so you have to practice a lot more than necessary to remember the routine.

Was there anything I liked about it? Well, yes. Rodney's voice is soothing, and the scenery is beautiful. So there's that. But I think this guy is just another overrated yoga celebrity. After about 5 viewings, I got bored and tossed the DVD.

It seems like a lot of people benefited from it though, which is great and the reason why I purchased it in the first place. However, there was too much glamour and not enough substance for me. I ended up learning yoga faster and more effectively by taking a couple free classes at a local studio in combination with practicing from a pose sheet I printed and watching Bryan Kest Power Yoga Complete Collection.",1390348800,3,1120,4.458536585365854

With that being said, I am indeed a VERY TRUE beginner to any type of yoga. I have seen others state that this was not for a true beginner, but I definitely DISAGREE! This covered everything! I am indeed pleased with Rodney's ability to teach. I am finding myself recovering at my own pace and am happy to follow this DVD each morning or night! I specifically liked that there is a whole separate section for teaching poses as well as following them! This was well worth the money!

3565435,3,B001F76OKC,"I got this for my husband, who decided he wanted to try yoga after seeing how I have benefitted from a regular practice. This has a nice, detailed instruction on the poses and correct form at the beginning, which is helping him slowly get into yoga - his body is not exactly used to these movements! He likes that it is a male instructor as well. My only issue was that the poses instruction should be a little slower and give you more time to figure out each one, but at least they include this portion. I have not done the flow workout with him yet so I can't comment on it, but I expect it to be similar in quality. It's a good start, but not great.",1389398400,2,652,4.1015625

I consider myself to be new to yoga but I have taken beginner classes at a yoga studio intermittently for 2 months and found this video to be too short and leaving out so many important moves for the rest of the body.  This video gives you the bare bones basics.  I recommend if you have not done classes before and are trying to get an idea of yoga, however; keep looking if you enjoy a session longer than 20-30 minutes.",1389225600,,473,4.119565217391305

I did the instructional Pose Guide for 7 days straight because I was afraid that the other workouts would be too strenuous. I also made up my own 10 minute aerobic routine after yoga. After the first workout I was actually enthusiastic about waking up and doing yoga ""with"" Rodney and Colleen. They don't have you doing anything hardcore. Light and at your own flexibility level. No foot behind your head moves! And Rodney and Colleen make it so peaceful to do the moves they want you to do. It's a great way to wake up or end your day!

I would not suggest buying it because I find the entire sequences too limiting.  I want more variation in a DVD.

3565471,5,B001F76OKC,"Although the least important fact about this DVD, what I found very uplifting was that the sessions were recorded outdoors on a beach with a scenic ocean view in the background. I used other yoga DVDs in the past recorded in a drab dark studio with a monotone voice over, and this alone made a huge difference: you practice in your own home, but with a great view to look at.

The DVD has three sections: one step by step tutorial how to perform each of the poses (studio recorded), and two yoga sessions (outdoors) by two different teachers, each about 20 minute long. It also has three narration styles to choose from: step by step explanation to moves in each pose, pose name only, and inspirational (energy flow, feeling etc.) so you can choose what work works best for you. The pace is right, not too fast, and it's really good for beginners, although at times you wind up with your back to the TV, so it can be a challenge to follow visually while doing certain poses. The explanations are straight forward and help with getting in right. Finally, a 20 minute session length seems just right and encourages practicing more often.

The only annoying thing I found with the DVD (and probably any DVD) is that you can't fast forward through a lot of promo materials in the beginning of it.",1376092800,6,1292,4.517094017094017

3565483,4,B001F76OKC,Easy to follow. Only 2 actual sessions though. Could use more variety but a great video to discover if yoga is right for you or not.,1372636800,,132,4.115384615384615
3565484,5,B001F76OKC,Rodney Yee's yoga video is amazing. Very great DVD for beginners!  Whole section where he walks through each detail of each pose and then two great workouts that challenge the beginner just enough to build your confidence. A must-buy!,1372550400,,234,5.0
3565485,5,B001F76OKC,"I received the item before the date promised. I am a novice to yoga, and I have purchased other videos that are a bit too advance.  I like Rodney's presentation.  I tried it and I am looking forward to making this video a part of my daily routine.",1371686400,,247,4.125
3565486,4,B001F76OKC,"I really like the guest female instructor that appears in one of the two actual guided yoga sessions. I felt she provided a great intro guided session. I honestly didn't like the male instructor as much, but I think this is because, being a beginner and a female, watching a woman's body perform the poses was more helpful for me. For example, when she put her hands on her hips, I knew where to put my hands, etc. When watching the male it was harder for me to really get my body in position. Otherwise, I really liked this beginner video. There are 45 minutes of pose instructions---which are extremely helpful, and then two 15-20 minute guided yoga sessions (one by the male instructor and one by the female). So yes, I give this a very good recommendation, although there are a lot of ads you have to forward through, I think I forwarded through like five or six chapters on my dvd player...that's too many.",1371168000,,911,4.493975903614458

It's not too difficult but enough to gently wake up the body. It left me feeling alert without feeling over worked. Good for those busy days when you don't have the time for a lengthy routine.
Then there is a 17 minute PM routine with Colleen Saidman which is soothing and calming.
There is a 42 minute section of pose demonstrations which can be used as a workout. I did use it and found it to be an effective exercise routine.  It was like the video ""Yoga For Dummies"".",1368921600,3,596,4.228070175438597

So, yoga was the next step. Having never taken a yoga class ever and not wanting to drive 30-45 minutes to take one this video was the solution.
  The video is precise and a good workout. I was not sore nor exhausted when finished but felt refreshed, with energy to last the day .I find Rodney's style calming, and the instruction very good. I have several of his video's now and rotate the DVD's daily.

3565497,4,B001F76OKC,"Pros - Very nice instruction for the poses and two nice exercise programs.  Particularly like the choices to listen to full instruction or just brief instruction to move to next pose.  I find the brief instruction to actually be easier to follow, as the full instruction talking makes me want to look up or twist around from my pose to view the TV.
Cons - I have not found a way to skip all of the beginning video advertisements!  If I'm using it in the morning before work, I start the DVD and then get the coffee pot started in order to have time for the exercise.",1366243200,2,566,4.271028037383178

3565499,4,B001F76OKC,I have only recently started yoga and needed an introduction to this practice. This video encompasses two sessions that are roughly 20 minutes each. The first session focuses on more dynamic poses while the second session concentrates on recovery postures. Rodney Yee is a good instructor and his relaxed/calm presentation goes well with the Hawaii coastline in the background. I would recommend this product to anyone who is interested in starting yoga and does not want to feel overwhelmed with advanced poses.,1365638400,,512,5.2560975609756095

I tried many DVD's, but they were either boring beyond belief or too difficult. I would recommend this to anyone - even for an accomplished yogi, it would be a really nice relaxing practice. For a beginner, it would be a great introduction. Finally, for someone with physical limitations/injuries, its a way to keep practicing. There are no tricky twists, balances or a lot of getting up and down off the mat. There is an option for inspirational instruction instead of the standard instruction, and I like it a lot. Really, this is a genuine 5 stars.",1365379200,2,693,4.596774193548387

3565512,4,B001F76OKC,"A long time ago I was a medium distance jogger. I learned through experience that I needed to stretch and after a period of time I made stretching part of my pre and post jogging routine.  Now, 20 years later, and having not exercised in forever I started biking about 2 months ago.  Recently I decided that it was time to integrate some stretching. However, instead of just plain old stretching I figured I'd try Yoga for its other benefits.

I bought this ""Yoga for Beginners"" DVD hoping that it would give me a reasonable introduction and some easy ""beginner"" poses that I could use.

This video goes into detailed  explanations on how you should do the poses and what the common mistakes are.  It let's you review specific poses in case you didn't get it right the first time.  I haven't gone through the whole video yet but I ""audited"" the course by watching the poses section and then watching one session with Collen Saidman and one with Rodney Yee.

Positives:
Easy to understand and easy to follow.
Reasonably priced.

Negatives:
It would not run on my computer.  It would only run on a DVD player which I had to go dig out of a box and hook up to my TV.

Not so much a negative but it would have been nice...

For a beginner course there are some poses that Colleen Saidman achieves that I just shook my head in disbelief.  I'm so far away from those poses that I had to laugh.  I understand that some of these are goals but it would have been useful (at least for me) to have had some commentary about ""If you can't reach this position then try for this one.. "" with something like an actual beginners pose.  I'm still working on seeing all my toes let alone putting my hands flat on the floor in between my legs...

But, all in all, it looks like a good introduction to the art and I like the slow pace and the detailed instructions.",1360368000,,1845,4.335276967930029

3565515,5,B001F76OKC,This dvd has 40 minutes of yoga instruction that you need to review over and over prior to attempting any yoga workout.  I wish I had purchased this dvd prior to any other.  You are shown the proper way to hold a pose without danger of injury to yourself and the way to get the most benefit from a yoga workout.  I am using this instruction everyday until I master it.  Then I will go to the next level.  On this dvd are yoga workouts also.  It is a must buy for anyone new to the practice of yoga which I recommend to all.,1360195200,,523,3.980769230769231
3565516,3,B001F76OKC,"I have been doing yoga and pilates off and on for years, but never for extended periods of time.  I have been back on the wagon, so to speak, for about a month, practicing one or both every night.

I got this video free with some rewards points so really didn't pay too much attention to the description, I just wanted a yoga DVD I was capable of doing.

The bulk of this DVD is a 40 minute session where Rodney goes over a variety of poses.  I will say I have not watched this the whole way through or any more than maybe 5 minutes of it because it was, to put it bluntly, boring.  If you have done yoga even a few times, this is probably too elementary.  That being said, if you have NEVER done yoga and want to learn what it's all about, this will teach you about poses.

I also only work out at night so really I only can use 15 minutes of this video, which is the evening part (how it is labeled on the back of the DVD), also known as the rejuvenation section (as it is referred to in the DVD menu).  I have been looking for the perfect relaxation yoga for about a month now and this is not it.  However, it is better than some, and it is very very easy which I think is key to relaxation yoga (and only relaxation yoga).

I can't believe I typed this much... Overall I would be bummed if I payed for this but am glad to have another relaxation session to add to my library.",1360108800,,1379,4.0

The first several minutes are nothing but advertisements. Then there was Rodney and a lady going over various poses and saying what NOT to do. Get to the exercise part, already! At that point I shut it off. Tonight I will review the exercise part (if there even IS an exercise part) and see if there is something worth doing. I appreciate that the poses should be done correctly, but this was not what I expected. Less advertisements, less talk and more exercise.",1359417600,,600,4.366071428571429

3565539,4,B001F76OKC,Love Rodney Yee - his energy and his pace. Wish he had done the whole video explanations himself. The woman who trades off explanations with him has a little faster pace than I am comfortable with as a beginner. The stretches/poses themselves are excellent and I even was able to correct some of my poses that I learned incorrectly in some of Rodney Yee's other beginning yoga videos and it made a huge difference in how I felt during and after the pose. Would definitely recommend this to yoga beginners.,1352937600,,505,4.622222222222222
3565540,4,B001F76OKC,Some people have complained that the routines move too fast between poses.  This maybe true but you must keep in mind these are beginning routines done in normal speed...  I'm 40 lean and fairly athletic but still find a lot of these poses quite challenging.  In fact a lot of the harder poses you can work your way into doing but it takes time and patience.  The pose guide instruction is helpful in suggesting easier variations to begin with but oddly there are some poses that are missing which are in the routines. Don't be deterred by the negative reviews this is a good DVD.  I just think if your completely new to yoga you should take your time use your pose guide first and go through the routines the best you can at your own speed.  Eventually you'll catch up to the pace and your flexibilty will benefit.,1352937600,,815,4.436241610738255

3565543,5,B001F76OKC,When I ordered this I wanted to do yoga twice a day every day and be able to stick to it. This was the best DVD for beginning practice I found. The routines are easy to learn and I picked them up so well that I can do them without watching the DVD if I have to! On top of that you get a step by step explanation of each pose from Rodney and Colleen which I highly recommend you to watch more than once. I found myself going back to it over and over again to be sure I had the technique right as I progressed. It's like being in your own private class with them.

I practice the morning and evening routines with him - I LOVE the extended instructions for each pose.  Colleen and Rodney outline the correct form for each pose and the common mistakes.  And it is easy to navigate to a specific pose.
The morning and evening routines are 20 minutes each - perfect for my husband!
And perfect for me on those days when I don't have an hour or just want a short refreshing session.
I highly recommend these DVDs.",1348531200,,684,4.544715447154472
3565548,1,B001F76OKC,"I had a VHS of Rodney Yee's beginners Yoga and was supper happy with it.
I used it for many years and it was simple and my waistline shrink beautifully.
However this DVD is full of commercials and it is frustrating to get to the good part.
Some of the exercises are not for a chubby beginner like me. twisting the body and some other ones are impossible for me to do.
Also they keep showing what is wrong and then tell you this is wrong
so since I am following the tape I do it and find out this is the wrong pose.
I simply do not like this product it is too complicated and I wish I could just copy my VHS to DVD (which is illegal)

Since that is my favorite Yoga DVD (the others stay in the box and gather dust) I trusted Yee and took a chance on this one too. Wow, am I glad. The pose guide is invaluable. The instruction is clear and easy to follow and the pose guide is a practice in itself. Going into the other two practices after doing the pose guide a few times ensures that you do the poses correctly. This DVD may take the place of my favorite yoga DVD, although I still love Yee's Bad Back one, and I switch back and forth between the two. Definitely 5 stars. I'd give it more if I could.",1344211200,2,693,4.17910447761194
3565550,5,B001F76OKC,"I am a runner and recently decided to try doing some yoga to increase my flexibility and just to see if it would help with a tight lower back.  Plus I have done Tai Chi in the past and found that very relaxing, so was hoping to find something to make me feel that relaxed again.  I am definitely a beginner to yoga, I've maybe been to 2 yoga classes in my life.  I found this video easy to follow and very relaxing.  Although, some of the poses require more flexibility than I have.

I would say this video has essentially 3 sessions: a 40 minute session where they go through all the poses in detail (but I think it is definitely adequate to be used repeatedly as a 40 minute yoga session if you have time), and two 20 minutes practices (although I think one is about 22 minutes and the other 18.. which I like!  I can do the 18 min one if I'm more pressed for time).

Overall, after deciding on what beginning yoga video to try, I'm glad I picked this one.  I was initially thinking about picking a video with more sessions/options, but I've found after several weeks of doing yoga a couple times a week, I'm not even close to being bored with this video.",1344038400,9,1157,4.203619909502263

I like it because I feel like it's easy enough for a complete beginner like me, but I didn't feel like I was being ""babied"" or anything. The workouts - especially the ""relaxing"" one - are effective, and I always feel happy and actually stress-free when I'm done with them. Also, the instruction is exceptionally clear and the DVD comes with a ""pose guide"" so you can make sure you have the correct form.

I am a runner and work with weights but did not see the benefit of yoga.  After much encouragement, and a few stiff joints later, I was willing to give it a try.  I asked my friend what he recommended as a good starting dvd.  He recommended Rodney Yee's Yoga for Beginners.  This dvd shows the basics and gives the user not only the yoga positions but also includes how to correct wrong positions.  I am only a 1/3 of the way through the dvd and look forward to completing it.",1337472000,,581,4.1891891891891895
3565553,4,B001F76OKC,"I bought this DVD for the 40 minute do-along yoga pose training session and found it to be extremely informative. They focus on getting the alignment right and give many simple yet effective tips for various asanas(poses) such as lengthen the waist/keep your feet grounded/bend from the waist not the lower back etc. Not only did this make me more aware about what my different body parts were up to but also added inches (or what seemed like inches!) to my asanas.

As the description says, the DVD also contains two 20 minute workouts - one with Rodney and the other with Coleen. I did the 40 minute training session followed by a 20 minute workout for about a month. I wouldn't get much of a workout but I felt this DVD would build a good foundation to move on to more advanced DVDs. And it definitely helped!

I took off one star because I felt the instructors could/should have incorporated greater details about some of the poses  especially about the knees. Many a times I'd wonder if my knees were meant to be fully extended/soft or bent (it's not always obvious from the visuals). I had to rely on google and youtube for more information (I highly recommend youtube vids by yogatic especially ""Protect your Knees in Yoga"").",1337040000,5,1232,4.616438356164384

There's three ways to watch it: Full Instruction where they give you insight on how to perfect your poses, Pose Only where they focus only on the poses or Inspirational which I like because it's more like going to a yoga class and the instructor helps you really focus and relax during the yoga.

When I first had a yoga class they not only discussed poses, they discussed breath...which is very important.  Breath was not discussed until the end of the pose section and was very limited.  There were no block or strap modifications offered for the poses...very important for people new to practice and even for those, like me, who are still not very stretched out.  My husband was having a very difficult time without modifications and needed more direction about how to modify.

Also, if you have a bad back, GET THIS DVD.  The waist crawling and lower back extension are phenomenal, even though they are minimal, and felt so AMAZING, I did the program twice in a row...back to back !!!  I am in LOVE with it.  I felt three inches taller, and my back actually was begging for more.

But I thought that if I didn't do something soon, then I just might keep pulling muscles as I floss my teeth and that is unacceptable - at least from now on.

So I picked up a copy of this DVD.  It explains the poses and sets up for a couple sessions of light yoga.  I admit that it is nearly perfect.  The explanations by Yee are soothing and easy to follow.  I used this DVD for two weeks and then felt that it was too limiting.  Now that I had the basics, I opted for more sessions of different pose routines.

I moved on to the Rodney Yee's AM Yoga for beginners.  It is also well done.  However, I do think that Rodney Yee's Yoga for Beginners should be the first one used.",1327449600,14,852,4.041916167664671

3565569,5,B001F76OKC,"This DVD is a keeper.  I purchased it a few years ago near the beginning of my yoga practice to learn the different poses and their proper forms. Recently deciding to thin my DVD collection, I reviewed this DVD to determine if I had moved beyond it.  I am so happy I re-viewed it after all this time.  As it turns out, I'd been doing a few of the poses with less than proper form.  I followed the instructions, fine-tuned my posture, and found those poses less strenuous and more ""opening."" I learned much from this DVD in the beginning of my practice and again years later.

In the 40-minute instructional portion, the two instructors offer clear and concise descriptions and visuals (including proper form and common mistakes) for each of the presented poses. This is the most valuable portion of the DVD and, I believe, should be viewed often in the beginning of one's practice and then periodically thereafter.

The two additional routines (one for AM and one for PM) are good for a quick session if time is limited.  Another benefit of these two routines, especially if done just after completing the instructional portion, is the ability to practice the illustrated poses flowing one into the next while being mindful of one's body and how it feels when in proper form.",1323907200,5,1275,4.690582959641255

I ordered it because I saw a glimpse of the pose guide, which appeared helpful. Aesthetically, the exercises on the beach looked peaceful, the music non-intrusive, and Rodney Yee seemed to have such a soothing voice (a big plus in a yoga instructor).

But the exercises move waaaaay too quickly.  Doing the practices felt like I was being ushered along hurriedly--like I was late for a meeting or something.  Kind of the antithesis of what yoga is all about, right?  The instructor would even say, ""Stay here for a cycle of two breaths,"" but s/he would only give enough time for a single quick one.
Aaaahh!! Cue aggravation, another thing you don't want to get out of a yoga session.

Given all the good reviews, I was really surprised.  Granted, I'm only a beginner, but I feel like the whole point of yoga is to get into the poses...if only for a few nice breaths.  I felt so short-changed with this DVD; there's no way I'm hitting the pause button after every pose.

3565598,4,B001F76OKC,"I just did both sessions on this DVD.  With the exception of some yoga stretching on some of the Biggest Loser workouts, I have never done Yoga before.  This is the only yoga DVD I have tried, so I couldn't tell you if there is a better one out there to start with.  I can tell you, though, that this was a good one for me to start with.  I had some trouble with the second session because I'm not very flexible.  Also, I had a little trouble with some of the moves, even though I went through the pose guide first.  But, since I'm a beginner, I would expect that with any DVD.

Only reason I'm giving it 4 stars rather than 5 is because I wish there were more sessions so that I could get more familiar with the moves.  Obviously, I can do these 2 sessions again.  I just get bored easily.  So, I will probably end up buying a couple of more DVDs so I can have my variety.  I really enjoy the music and camera work on these.  So, I would definitely buy more from Gaiam.

I find it to be very helpful in learing yoga as it not only shows the proper positions but also shows what some of the common mistakes are.  I made the mistake in trying to learn from a more advanced yoga DVD and have been having some positioning problems.  Just a couple of times going through the beginning positions has given me the background to move ahead.,1298419200,,416,4.3076923076923075

I could have saved myself some pain and misery.  There are six different takes...pose only, full instruction, and inspirational, with both Yee and his assistant guiding you through the practice.  It is very relaxing and stress reducing.  I recommend that anyone who suffers from chronic pain or chronic stress engage in this activity.  This instructor is also featured in GAIAM courses through the Mayo Clinic.  Anyone who is not in pain might want to practice with this instructor in order to ward off any potential pain or pain which occurs through aging.",1292284800,16,893,4.703225806451613

This video also includes similar workouts as Rodney's AM & PM (one to give you vitality and one for rejuvination).  I would recommend this video for Yoga enthusiast of all levels.  It gives beginners the proper form to assure they do not hurt themselves and gives experienced Yogis helpful pointers to freshen their practice.  The 2 short practices are great for a quick wake-up or settle-down from daily activities.

If you do the poses as they teach them, it serves as a nice workout by itself, although not one you'd want to do very often.

I like Rodney Yee's workout; it stretches out my back nicely and makes me feel refreshed.  Colleen Saidman's workout, however, has some poses that don't seem geared toward ""beginners"" - she spends a lot of time with her legs twisted like a pretzel so I have to find a way to modify it for myself or do something else during those moments.

3565608,3,B001F76OKC,"I read many of the reviews here and was surprised there was no mention of why I feel I can only give this otherwise excellant dvd 3 stars: lack of labeling / notation (for beginners) to identify & learn the various poses.

Before I elaborate, first let me say some of the good things I enjoy on the dvd.  One, there's a whole range of poses.  Two, you can go to select poses and go directly to the pose that interests you (though, then the video continues to other poses without telling you, which, for a pure beginner, is very confusing at times.)  Three, the instructional info on common mistakes, alignment, and reminders that one need not to stretch to full stretch, is excellant; beyond useful, it's essential for safer movement.  And lastly, the ""inspirational"" portion, which I anticipated would be too spiritual-gushy and authoritarian for me, was suprisely really more poetic visualization - it provided a vivid counterpoint to the techno-instructional style.  My only improvement suggestion for the inspirational portion would be a kindly reminder / encouragement by the narrator for the viewer / participant to come up with their own more pertinent imagery.

But my main complaint, and main reason for purchasing the dvd full price at a discount store (50% higher than here on amazon), was to learn the various poses.  A simple script notation onscreen for each pose would have done wonders.  Add in that often a new pose is introduced without either narrator saying what the pose is, and, again, for a pure beginner, very confusing.

Still, not knowing other yoga dvd's yet, if one had no other choices, at least this is a beginning; and, since I want to learn, I am writing down the pose names, doing my own little stick figure image next to the name, and learning.

Disclosure:  I've done yoga, off and on, since my early 20's (I just turned 60) but just enjoyed doing it without ever bothering to even know there were names to the poses (or ignoring them if I heard them) and am now at a point of refining and recognizing what it is I am doing - hey, better late than never, huh?

I chose it because it is entitled RODNEY YEE'S Yoga for Beginners. My bad for not investigating more thoroughly and realizing she was half the DVD. Had I known, I would never have bought this DVD.

The two routines are well-designed and the instructions are clear and direct. His co-instructor, Colleen Saidman, is also very good. The pose guide is an excellent tutorial for beginners and also a good alignment review for more experienced practitioners. (It's always helpful to go back to the basics.

I decided to get his Beginner's video because I want to make sure I have all the techniques correct before furthering the yoga practice. Its broken up into three sections on the menu. The first section is all move and postures, and poses where he and another yoga instructor goes over at least 20 common yoga poses in detail, shows you the right and wrong ways, etc. Then there is a ""Energy"" video that is about 15-20 minutes long taught by Rodney Yee(don't quote me on this though) and a ""Rejuvenation"" taught by the other instructor, which has awesome stretching poses to work on elongation and flexibility.

If you are completely new to yoga, this is a great video. But even if you're not but want to familiarize yourself with the poses, this one is great to have. Plus, the two sessions included are great for morning or evening practices if you don't have an hour and a half to go to a yoga studio!",1267401600,19,1093,4.437810945273632

I have no desire to twist up like a pretzel or even balance on my head, but I do want as close to perfect form as I can get. An accident messed up my form a bit, but it's coming back over time. I need the reminders on this video to encourage me not to use that injury as an excuse to be sloppy.

This is actually an excellent video to get someone started moving. Rodney Yee has such a calm teaching style, non-threatening, and very motivating. I never want to quit on an exercise in the middle, because he makes it easy and user-friendly.

Especially helpful are the options. You can decide how much information you want or need at that session. Next session you may want more, or less. Great idea!

I'm updating this March 5th, 2012 because I reviewed it before loaning it to a friend. I went through all my ""beginner yoga"" DVDs to find just the right one for her. There were other good ones, but when I did this one, the search was over.

As I told my friend,

It isn't too hard if you will do the 'POSE' section before doing the practices.

It isn't too easy if you do it well.

In fact, I had not realized the 'Pose' section was even there. I've never done it before. Somehow I missed it and for that reason, I missed a couple of excellent explanations that have improved my own practice, which goes from the Intermediate to Advanced level depending on what we're doing. This particular video is the best I've seen for beginners. If you think that 'Poses' section is going so slowly that you aren't doing anything, just keep going all the way through. You will have achieved something. Then do the two practice sections. I recommend coming back another day and going through the 'poses' section again if you really are brand new at yoga. You'll pick up more the second time because you won't fear it as much. If someone who has been doing yoga for years can enjoy this DVD, it isn't too easy for a beginner. I think it's the exact right place to start. It isn't bad for a review or for just a nice, calming yoga session for someone with more experience too.

While the section on poses does a good job of focusing on common mistakes, the camera angle is awkward and sometimes cuts off when you are trying to follow along. With that said, the attempt at fancy camera work hinders the ability to follow along in true form, and this continues into the workout section. For instance, some shots only display Rodney's head and arms held up, but will omit the position he takes with his legs. I was not able to complete the first workout section; the pace was quite quick and unless you have the poses memorized by name and form, you would not be able to keep up with Rodney. This DVD is best for advanced beginners who are already versed in yoga poses and only need additional instruction to correct form. Discouraging DVD for the true beginner!",1245456000,309,1045,4.505263157894737
3565646,4,B001F76OKC,"I love Rodney Yee as well as only a handful of other instructors such as Rainbeau Mars, Seane Corn, etc. who have a real passion for yoga to help balance the body and the mind.
This has 2 about 20 min workouts, Rodney doing the morning & Colleen doing the evening. They both use only basic beginner poses that have a relaxed,  slow pace. The great thing about this dvd is the 3 different audio instruction. You can have basic overall instruction that Rodney uses in the past which gives you the pose name, basic instruction about posture, as well as some inspiration teaching such as not being hard on yourself that you aren't doing the best you've ever done, etc. You can choose ""pose only"" which is just the music & Rodney/Colleen only saying only the name of the next pose. Or you can have the ""inspirational"" mode which tells you the pose & how it helps your body & other inspirational ways the yoga pose helps you through life in a more positive way, by noticing the positive in your body, etc. This is a great idea to get larger target audience who might all have different taste in instruction, or different needs depending on the day. I think all workout dvds should do this, even offer even more varied choices, especially ""instruction only"" in case you don't like the music, but do want the instruction, etc.. Most dvds now only offer instruction w/music or just music which is too limiting considering the technological possibilities, dvd reviews will get much less complaints due to varied user's tastes & much more sales. *hint hint*
The pose 42 min guide has Rodney & Colleen taking turns being the teacher/model in a total white studio for poses like: mountain, side bend, back bend, standing fwd bend, downward dog, triangle, wide angle standing fwd bend, side angle, warrior 1, cobra, cobbler's/butterfly, seated twist, seated cross legged fwd bend, seated fwd bend, reclined easy stretch figure 4 ankle crossed over knee then pull to chest, happy baby, reclined twist, bridge, reclined rest with knees up, total rest. They mostly focus on common thing people do wrong & quick basics on how to do it right. There could have been more instruction, but this is good for people who get bored fast.
If you want really deep instruction that answers questions you wouldn't even realize to ask about muscle alignment/use during a pose, I would suggest Seane Corn's Vinyasa Flow Yoga - Uniting Movement with Breath.

3565647,5,B001F76OKC,This is great for beginners. It has helped me with stress and flexibility. The only thing is you can't skip a week.,1245024000,,115,4.2727272727272725
3565648,5,B001F76OKC,Great for beginners.  I stayed at the instructions on basic moves for several weeks just to make sure I was steady.,1244073600,2,115,4.476190476190476
3565649,5,B001F76OKC,This was a good video to get me started with yoga and I like Rodney Yee's calm and soothing voice. I enjoy starting my day with the video and unwinding with yoga at the end of the day. This was an excellent purchase for beginners and it makes me want to buy other videos from Yee.,1243468800,4,280,4.017857142857143
3565650,5,B001F76OKC,"the 40 minute in depth stretch instructional was excellent!
the two 20 min sessions are also nice, but the instructional was great.",1242345600,,131,5.0
3565651,5,B001F76OKC,"I purchased 3 different ""beginner"" DVDs on Amazon to try.  I am somewhat familiar with Yoga but haven't practiced it in years, and was never that advanced to begin with.  I was worried that some of the DVD's would be too easy or too complicated for me.  This was perfect.  (Incidentally, the one I really didn't like was ""Yoga for Every Body"" which somehow managed to be both too easy (not challenging physically) and too complicated (using Hindu terminology and a lot of props)  This DVD, on the other hand,  was great becasue it was simple and straightforward, while being physically challenging at the same time (easy poses to customize to your level of fitness, too)  I only wish it were longer.  I will purchase more of the Gaiam DVDs with Rodney Yee",1241827200,378,755,4.62406015037594
3565652,5,B001F76OKC,"First of all I have to say of all the Yoga dvd's I have I like Rodney Yee's the best.  I own his Am and PM Yoga and found this dvd to be similar except Rodney only does the morning workout and Colleen Saidman doe the evening workout, compared to Rodney instructing in his earlier released am and pm yoga.  The new dvd give you a description on how to align your body and do the movements which I find difficult to visually watch and do at the same time on other dvd's.  If you are a beginner this is perfect for you, however, I would suggest later adding other Rodney Yee dvd's and not his am and pm yoga to your collection.",1241308800,34,624,4.056910569105691

3565654,5,B001F76OKC,"This is one case in which the title does not mislead.  If you don't have much background in yoga and need to have all the various postures explained in some detail, this is the DVD for you.  Even if you do have some experience with yoga, they will take you back to the basics where you might need a little correction here and there.  Also, on the disc Rodney Yee and his partner take you through the steps of two yoga workouts that will lead you in the end to a wonderful feeling of relaxation.",1240272000,229,494,4.178947368421053

8301136,5,B001F76OKC,I discovered Yoga several years ago through Wii Fit. A DVD with rodney yee that was an older version of this one perhaps I bought to learn more. These two instructors are quite good at demonstrating poses and I feel much more relaxed after simply working through them. I bought this DVD to start doing yoga at home and I'm certain it'll help and save me the recurring costs of a group class.,1525132800,,391,4.36986301369863

8301143,5,B001F76OKC,"I have been fairly sedentary for about 5 years.  This has been the perfect program to gently get my body flexible and strong again.  Rodney and his partner do a beautiful job of explaining the poses in a way that makes it easy for someone that is out of shape to do.  Their voice tones are an added plus as they are soothing, supportive and encouraging.  I highly recommend this for anyone that wants to gently ease their body back to flexibility and strength.",1515542400,2,460,4.440476190476191
