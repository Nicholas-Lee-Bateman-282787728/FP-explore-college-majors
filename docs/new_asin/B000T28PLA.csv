8207607,3,B000T28PLA,"Had hoped for some previously unaware insights into the design of the George Washington greenback. Due to the success of 'National Treasure' people wonder about any possible ties to secret societies that aspire for a New World Order. Interviews.

8207609,5,B000T28PLA,"How can you not love conspiracies? There are a lot of conspiracies that deal with the dollar bill.  This DVD goes into detail about explaining the codes and secrets that are on the dollar bill, things that I never noticed before.  Things like:

Why is there a pyramid on the great seal on the dollar bill? What does it have to do with US history?  Also, why does it have a ""seeing eye"" at the top?

Why is the number 13 represented a few times on the back of the dollar bill?  Does it have satanic references? Devil symbolism? For that matter, why is there a pentagram on the dollar bill? Again, is it the occult?

Is it really true that some of the founding fathers didn't want a Bald Eagle on the on the state symbol? Why not? If not, then what bird did they want to have on it?

What's with all the Latin on the back of US currency?  What could it mean, and what promised does it hold?

Did the Masons really have a lot of influence over the design over the dollar bill? What secrets and codes did they put in it, and what could it mean?

Well my friends, I'm glad you asked. This DVD answers all of the above questions, and tells you more secrets and clues that are hidden in  and on the Dollar bill.

This was such a great DVD and it will hold you attention. I can promise you that if you get it, you won't be sorry. I know I wasn't. Codes, clues and conspiracies are everywhere, if you know where to look.",1283040000,2,1411,4.105839416058394
8207610,5,B000T28PLA,"After watching this DVD I was amaze by all the encryptions on the dollar bill. I knew  some of the symbols, but had no clue as to what some of the meanings were. This DVD is clearly amazing. I'm glad I bought it. I used it to give a speech, the topic of course was the Dollar Bill. The audience was stun after the presentation. I couldn't help but feel their reaction because that's how I felt after watching the DVD. Great educational tool.",1273363200,3,441,4.25

8207612,4,B000T28PLA,"This rather short video (45 min) investigates what's up with the symbolism on American currency.
At least three or four sides interviewed:
- conspiracy theorist (suggesting that symbolism is masonic/occult)
- mason (suggesting that symbolism reflects the spirit of the age when seal was introduced)
- government official (to give snippets of the official story)
- some other person - author of decoding da vinci code (either gnostic, new-ager, pagan, or something similar to that sort of 'spirituality')
- and couple others..

The video is somewhat balanced as to letting all sides being represented. This can be disputed, but even though some comments were blatantly wrong by some persons, I still think it wasn't spoiled that bad, because other sides were given an opportunity to retaliate.

HINT: Christian can NOT be a Freemason and a Freemason can NOT be a Christian. Why is that? For the same reason as why pluralist can NOT be a Christian. These two positions exclude each other. One suggests exclusive religious claims, while other includes other religions.
Both Jesus Christ - the person after whom the Christianity is named, and the his disciples where not pluralist. This is evident by Jesus's claims and dixiples' claims:
a.) Jesus: ""Jesus answered, ""I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."" (John 14:6)
b.) Peter (and John) while speaking Before the Sanhedrin: ""Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved."" (Acts 4:12).
So, when you hear toward the end of the video that a person says that some of the founding fathers of America were 'Freemasons and good Christians', he says something similar to 'there are square circles'.
Other than that, presented views are somewhat internally consistent (I mean consistent with their own other statements).",1233792000,,1877,4.993610223642173
8207613,3,B000T28PLA,"A lot of cable companies show documentaries right when movies are released.  ""The Real 300,"" ""The Truth Behind Amistad,"" ""Cinderella Man Himself,"" etc.  I don't know of the film companies push the cable companies to do it or vice versa.  But this documentary is clearly meant to get viewers to see or rent Nick Cage's film.  It also has a ""Da Vinci Code"" vibe/imitation in it too.

The narrator says, ""There are many 13's on the dollar bill.  It must be because of the freemasons.""  Hello!  There were originally 13 colonies.  Why can't that be the reason?

The work did not make me want to study the dollar bills in my pocket.  It didn't make me think, ""Wow!  Our American currency is just so awesome!""  It really just reminded me of that ""Simpsons"" episode with Patrick Stewart where a secret society becomes the ""No-Homers.""",1198281600,4,827,4.659722222222222
