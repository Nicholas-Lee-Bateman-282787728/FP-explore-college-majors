8526468,4,B008A1TW78,"This is an excellent noir indie film. It's very observant & deceptively simple, throwing the audience a few curves along the way. The process of securing a fake ID is probably very different today, but was reasonable at the time of release. This is a 3 1/2~star movie, but Amazon isn't giving me the 1/2 star option.",1420934400,,316,4.56140350877193
