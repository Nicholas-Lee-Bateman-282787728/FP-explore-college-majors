8231871,3,B000YDBP6G,"One could have hoped for a better remastering, however this does look alot better than standard dvd ,but it like alot of older movies is going to look flatter on blu ray  than a new movie. It doesn't look dirty though and that's something.  WIth obscure movies like this you should be glad to get them and bci is out of business so that's it for these movies I guess. They didn't put out much blu ray stuff before they went under either.  But I would say martial movie art fans should be happy with this one on blu ray even if it's not remastered fully. I wish all br's were remastered and restored but even mainstream movies may not get that sometimes.  And at least they gave you two movies here ,something that more studios should do.",1295136000,2,737,4.318840579710145
8231872,5,B000YDBP6G,"This Blu-ray's great!  Much better picture quality than DVD.  It looks fantastic!  And, no the action scenes are NOT choppy--another reviewer here obviously has equipment issues, NOT disc issues.  BCI's done a great job, and I'm hoping for more Blu-ray starring Sue Shihomi.

These movies are wildly entertaining, and just crazy over the top!  I was laughing throughout these movies, not because they're funny, but because they're just so entertaining.  No wonder Quentin Tarantino referenced this movie in True Romance.",1229126400,4,520,5.425
8231873,3,B000YDBP6G,This Is A Pretty Good Bluray Product. Great Fighting Sequences.  Nice Movie To Eat Popcorn With And Have A Good Time With Friends.  Loved When The Fat Guys Guts Get Pulled Out.  Or The Crazy Guy Whos Head Gets Twisted.  Nice Effects.(just wait for the bats at the end of the movie.)  Fair Movie Just Dont Expect Crystal Clear Picture Quality.,1213142400,2,342,4.540983606557377
8231874,1,B000YDBP6G,"I had high hopes for this disc as I own the boxset for sister street fighter on DVD.  The films have not been cleaned up any further from there DVD presentation.  All the same scratches are evident across the picture from the previously mention DVD boxset.  The sound is adequate but nothing different from the DVD boxset.

The most glaring error is the quality control on the discs from BCI,  all of the action scenes are choppy and suffer from a very bad encode.  The menus are a tragedy considering this is suppose to be a next gen disc presentation.  I have had to send mine back to hopefully get a working disc.

If your a fan of the series wait until BCI gets a clue or just buy the complete boxset on DVD.",1202515200,7,712,4.2611940298507465
