8683209,5,B00OCND62A,"In 2001, one of the most anticipated movies in history came into theatres: ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,"" adapted from J.R.R. Tolkien's classic fantasy novel.

Since it was created by a talented but weird director who specialized in humorous splatter-horror, and based on a book that had never been successfully adapted even in part, no one was entirely sure whether it would bomb or succeed. But Peter Jackson's adaptation of the first of the ""Lord of the Rings"" novels is a sublime cinematic experience, rich with detail, powerful in its acting, and expansively bringing Tolkien's world to life.

When hobbit Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm) leaves the Shire, the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) convinces him to leave his treasured magical Ring, which confers invisibility to its wearer, to his young cousin Frodo (Elijah Wood). Gandalf soon confirms that the Ring is the evil One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron, and tells the frightened Frodo to leave the Shire as soon as possible -- especially since nine dark riders are searching for someone by the name of Baggins.

Frodo, his faithful gardener Sam (Sean Astin) and his two mischievous cousins (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd) quickly travel to meet with a strange ranger, and stumble into more dangers as they make for the Elven haven of Rivendell. But Frodo's journey is not over yet -- when he and a band of hobbits, Men, Elves, Dwarves and a wizard all volunteer to take the Ring to the only place where it can be destroyed: Mount Doom, in the heart of Sauron's domain Mordor.

For a long time, a convincing ""Lord of the Rings"" movie could not be made -- not just because of special effects and money, but because it is so difficult to translate Tolkien's work into something watchable. Goofy scripting, bad special effects, mutilated characters -- there was just so much that could go wrong. The ultimate triumph of Jackson's movie is that it is a high fantasy story with all the usual tropes -- a king in waiting, an unlikely hero, a dark lord -- which can be taken very seriously.

And Jackson and Co. outdid themselves with nearly every aspect of the films. They translated Tolkien's erudite prose into solid, poetic dialogue, with lots of humor and horror, romance and taut action. And it all takes place in the New Zealand landscapes, with lots of misty forests, towering mountains and charming rural villages. And Jackson takes full advantage of these, with his trademarked swooping shots that sweep past like a hawk, and wild camerawork for fight scenes (which are delightfully gory, especially where orcs are involved).

But the setting alone doesn't make a good movie, which is where Jackson's WETA Workshops came in. Sets range from the sturdy English hobbit towns to the airy elven tree-houses; and the special effects are almost shockingly realistic, including a rampaging cave troll, and a glimpse of the gruesome Gollum.

Elijah Wood is outstanding as Frodo Baggins. He runs the emotional gamut: fear, pain, horror, happiness, resignation, love and loneliness -- while Frodo is a bit too wimpy at times (dropping his sword?), he's ultimately a likable everyman hero caught up in terrifying circumstances. Sean Astin is equally good as the steadfast Sam, who is amazed by the world outside the Shire and determined to keep his best friend safe. And there's some comic relief comes with Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd, as Frodo's loyal, chipper cousins who come along on a mission they don't fully understand.

But as lovable as the hobbits are, they do not dominate all of the screen: Ian McKellen is perfect as the grandfatherly wizard Gandalf, as is Viggo Mortensen as the mysterious, darkly grubby Ranger who has a hidden destiny. There's also Orlando Bloom as the acrobatic elven archer, John Rhys-Davies as a robust R-rolling dwarf, ominous movie veteran Christopher Lee as a malevolent wizard, as well as Hugo Weaving, Liv Tyler, John Rhys-Davies, and especially Sean Bean as the tormented Boromir, a warrior who desperately wants to use the Ring to save his home city.

Sublimely directed and powerfully written, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is a true modern classic -- and it's merely the first part of this epic trilogy. Just be sure to have ""The Two Towers"" on hand.",1424995200,,4287,4.893939393939394
