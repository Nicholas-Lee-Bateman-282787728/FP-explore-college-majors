2777809,5,B000NQRR20,"My daughter loves Bratz and has most of these DVDs. She has watched this one many times, which is probably a good indicator that it is a half decent production!",1227139200,3,160,4.366666666666666
2777810,1,B000NQRR20,"I got this for a sleep under my daughter was having, thought it would be perfect. Wrong, wrong, wrong... very scary, mature themes. Stay Away!",1217808000,2,142,4.72
2777811,1,B000NQRR20,This movie is entirely too scary for children.  The images and themes are too mature for young audiences. Parents that don't want to put crazy ideas in to their childrens heads should not purchase this video.  I stopped the DVD and threw it in the trash. Total waste of money.,1214092800,,276,4.5
2777812,5,B000NQRR20,"My daughter saw this at a retail store and wanted it.  I bought it without any high expectations; and she absolutely loves it.  She has watched this many, many times over--not once has she said she was afraid or scared on any part of the movie.  And truth be told, I enjoy watching it with her.",1208822400,,294,4.214285714285714
2777813,1,B000NQRR20,"Honestly, i expected shallow- i mean- it's BRATZ- my expectations were really low, but the entire disc is just really scary ghost stories that derive from urban legends and it makes amusement parks and clowns even scarier than they already are.

There is no feeling of safety here.

There is no happy ending.

it isn't just silly fun.

There wasn't even a redeeming message, just stuff to give kids nightmares-

please don't waste your money on this.

there is no Passion for Fashion on this disc.",1203206400,8,497,4.72093023255814
2777814,1,B000NQRR20,"This was WAY too Scary for little kids! The movie is about each Bratz telling a very scary story at a sleepover. It is deceptively packaged like it's about young kids and their fun first sleepover adventures, and isn't  clear that this is all about being SCARED. Adult scary. My 4 year old who loved the other Bratz movies, HATES this movie & even told me to throw it away after she saw it. She thought this movie would be great since it was about ""Baby Bratz."" She adores Scooby Doo, so there is a big difference in this movie.) She has never said that about anything else. Just what we needed, new frightening thoughts - your image in the mirror pulling you in and trapping you, etc.  It may be fine for older kids who don't have any fear issues, but if you have any trouble with your little ones fears, particularly if they are starting to sleep alone, get scared at night or have anxiety about their first sleepover, please pick something else! It may have a moral somewhere, but they are so terrified, they'll never figure it out! What were they thinking?",1194393600,9,1060,4.430769230769231
2777815,3,B000NQRR20,I had heard it was 'pretty scarey' but my daughter didn't have any problems with it.  She liked it and is a big Bratz fan.,1191196800,2,122,3.88
2777816,4,B000NQRR20,I have always complained about the Bratz Movies because of the cartoon images of over done makeup and the tight half tops and short short skirts. This movie was the most appropriate for my nine year old and her friends. They wore normal cute clothes for their age group. The movie was multi cultural. It wasn't surpy sweet and the story line flowed well! My only complaint is the music in this movie was not as cool(so my daughter says) as the other movies.  I wouldnt really mind buying her the dolls in this series either.,1188000000,3,524,4.458333333333333
2777817,1,B000NQRR20,"BEWARE! This is packaged as a fun little girly girl sleepover and it is a MONSTER STORY. The girls turn into monsters and it is good for night mares. Moms, you might wanna preview before you let kids watch this one.",1186876800,10,215,4.2682926829268295

2777833,1,B000NQRR20,"My nine year old daughter was very upset by this movie and immediately threw away the DVD after watching it.  I had to spend quite a bit of time talking her down from it.  I tried to reassure her about how when I was her age Jaws was the big scary movie that had everyone scared of sharks, but she scoffed and said that Jaws would be nothing compared to this movie, which was not only very scary but also very creepy and weird.  She normally likes Bratz movies, but now she says she will try one more movie, and if she doesn't like that - never again.",1407715200,,551,4.083333333333333

2777848,1,B000NQRR20,"I ordered this two disc combo but the only show included was Kidz Sleep Over.  The Fairy Tales show was not included, either on separate disc or on the disc with the Sleep Over show.  I have one very disappointed child and this disappointed parent.  Would have saved a couple bucks by just ordering the one show.",1357862400,,312,4.43859649122807
2777849,5,B000NQRR20,I bought this video along with 4 of the Bratz's dolls for my granddaughter for Chirstmas.  The video is her favorite thing.  She sits and watches it for hours.  She has a bookcase full of videos but this is the one she always grabs now.  I just bought her more Bratz movies for Easter and for her upcoming birthday in June.,1334966400,,323,4.245901639344262
2777850,5,B000NQRR20,The double features were wonderful films for younger female children. My 4 yr old watched both from start to finish. She even sang along to the music in Fairy Tales. The creators did an interesting twist on the fairy tales! Sleep over adventure was good too!,1332374400,,258,4.630434782608695
2777851,1,B000NQRR20,"We watched this movie in the middle of the afternoon amid Midwest sunshine. It still totally freaked my 6-year-old out. She is pretty good at separating fact from fiction but this had her and her girlfriend begging me to stop the show. I'm glad I didn't save it for a before-bed movie. They would never have fallen asleep. I'm sure older girls would enjoy it. First graders, not so much.",1287014400,,387,4.542857142857143
2777852,5,B000NQRR20,"I have every single Bratz movie, and this one was a real treat. I got a little creeped out at some parts, but that's what made it fun!!! I was even laughing at some parts!! Anyone who's scared of this really is a big loser.",1267228800,,223,3.977777777777778
2777853,5,B000NQRR20,"Actually I've rented this over 3x's for my daughter through Blockbuster. Now I am deciding to purchase this because now I know about Amazon, although her father is detesting the notion of me getting more bratz movies. She's made him watch this particular so many times that he can recite it be memory. lol, therefore it's safe to assume she's in love with this movie. As a parent I love bratz movies and I am building a collection of these. Although I love barbie movies there is a difference in movie style. Barbie is always the same, never is the main character mean or realistic to everyday things; however bratz seem to fit my daughter. My daughter isn't always happy, she isn't always the nice person therefore for her to watch this movie it becomes relatiable. I love them and I would recommend them to anyone. Also I love their vocabulary. My daughter is picking up on words such as dexterious and some more words I can't seem to think of them now. lol! I love them, my daughter loves them, and they are great and entertaining. I know some parents are saying they are scary, but my daughter is into scary movies and she has been since she was born. I'd rather her watch bratz on replay than me having to sit through the ring for recap after recap after recap.",1239580800,,1266,4.461206896551724
2777854,5,B000NQRR20,One of a two given as gift to my five year old grandaughter.  Age appropriate for Bratz fans.,1239062400,2,93,4.166666666666667
8180782,2,B000NQRR20,"We ordered the DVD thinking it would come with two DVDS, however it only came with one DVD , that had no title or writing on it, like it was copied from another Movie and the second movie was not in here..  I am very disappointed.",1504569600,,230,4.0
