5579162,4,B00BCPOFQ2,"I first saw this series at an anime convention a few years back and was excited to see it picked up for official release on Blu-Ray/DVD in North America.  I do have a few complaints.  The biggest being that the audio mix seemed a bit off.  The dialog and music tracks seemed a bit loud, while the sound effects seemed muted.  I felt like I was watching the commentary of the episode with all of the action taking place in another room.  I tried both the Blu-Ray version and the DVD on different players and audio receivers with the same results.  The English soundtrack was a little better.  I could hear most of the low range heavy explosions, but the midrange sound effects like gunfire and sword on sword clashing were still not very loud.

I mostly watched it in Japanese, but while comparing the soundtracks, I did notice that some of the English voice actors seemed to ad-lib or babble a bit, like they needed to fill up every bit of screen time with dialog.  And some of the terms seemed overly translated like ""Sacred Mechamaster"" instead of Seikishi.  Despite these things, I still enjoyed watching this anime again, and look forward to the second volume, where story plot picks up and the action gets more intense.",1367884800,2,1224,4.573394495412844
5579163,5,B00BCPOFQ2,"OK first, the name of this series (which was changed for the American release into something very weird) is a little misleading. This is not a Tenchi Muyo series in the sense that Tenchi, Ryoko, Ayeka, Sasami, Mihoshi, Kiyone, or Ryo-Ohki appear in it at ALL. Washu makes an appearance as an outline. Various characters are referenced very, very little and none, but Washu, are mentioned by name. So please don't expect this to be a Tenchi series. It's not.

It is, however, AMAZING. This series takes place in the Tenchi Multiverse. The series picks up with Masaki Kenshi (Tenchi's half bro who was in utero during Tenchi Muyo! GXP). Kenshi has wound up in a very strange and different world filled with mecha (mostly piloted by women.. similar to Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventure, another Tenchi multiverse series). Kenshi is one of the few guys who can pilot the mecha. There are a bunch of other special things Kenshi can do that no one else can and it leads to hilarious hijinks. It feels, to me, kind of like a mash-up of Tenchi, Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventures and El-Hazard, taking the best elements of each and making it better.

Kenshi ends up becoming the attendant to Princess-King Lakasha, a rather greedy and conniving young woman who is a really good person despite all this. This leads him on a serious of adventures and misdirections. He ends up meeting tons of ladies (most whom want him, of course) and wrapped up in political intrigue of this new world.

The thing that really drives this series is Kenshi. He's a really great, fun character. He has depth while appearing to be very simple, a fact that is constantly revealed, but works. There is also his foils (several of whom resemble, personality wise, our Tenchi heroines). They all have fun interactions with Kenshi and Kenshi plays off each of them well. It's really great.

All in all, this is a REALLY fun series and I think it's one of my favorites in the Tenchi Multiverse (I have them all.. even that horrid Sasami: Magical Girl's Club). So if you're a fan of Tenchi Muyo: Ryo-Ohki (1-3), Tenchi Universe, Tenchi in Tokyo, the Tenchi movies (any of the 4), Magical Project S, Dual! Parallel Adventure, Photo: the Idiot Adventures, or El Hazard, you're more than likely going to love this series. (If you loved Sasami: Magical Girl's Club, there is no hope for you, I'm sorry).

By the way, the limited edition (since no place tells you) just means it comes with a collector's case to hold both volumes of the series and a little art book with pictures of the series (i think.). If you want the box, pay the extra, if not.. don't. I only paid 3 bucks more for mine, so it was worth that (though you can't keep the second DVD in it's sleeve and put it in the box, so bad planning there). The cover of the 1st DVD set is also slightly different since it has no information on the regular cover. It just has another picture of Kenshi and the ladies of the series. Both sets come with reverseable covers if you want to change them.",1367280000,25,3010,4.5769944341372915
5579164,5,B00BCPOFQ2,"i been a fan of every tenchi muyo anime even GXP which is my most favorite, one thing you should be is open minded and try this anime because its very funny every episode 40 minutes which is very good for me for just 13 episodes it can even be for you who read this. i really would recommend this anime to anyone who likes comedy and a bit of a Harem and of course who wathed Tenchi Muyo series as well.

The Plot is also good and the characters are good not perfect but good. i would conclude this is a very good anime when i watched the funsubs so try it out.",1366156800,,561,3.9210526315789473
5579165,4,B00BCPOFQ2,"I've always been a big fan of the Tenchi Muyo cosmos (can't really say world or universe cause that still wouldn't encompass all the different story lines).

I can say without a doubt this very high on my list to purchase.  I've watched the fansubs multiple times.  The storyline is engaging, the characters are deep and well modeled.  The episodes are a satisfying 40 minutes long.

I my only problem is that 130$ (10$ per episode) for both boxes seems to be rather steep.  At 70$ I would snatch the series up, but for now, I'll wait and bide my time till the prices drop.",1362960000,16,573,4.40952380952381
5579166,4,B00BCPOFQ2,The Thing that this series has linked with tenchi muyo is the name and one or two character references from the other series otherwise its pretty much a stand alone series. I also believe that the animation in this series is the best out of all of the Tenchi series. I wish they wouldn't have split the series up like they did but you can't ask for everything.,1361491200,11,360,4.3088235294117645

5579222,5,B00BCPOFQ2,"Being a Tenchi Fan since the original OVA series I have been waiting a while to get this series and I was not disappointing. A few details though, this is a canon series and falls in the same universe as Tenchi Muyo OVA, Tenchi Muyo Ryo-ohki, and Tenchi Muyo GXP. It doesn't take place in the non-canon universe of Tenchi Universe, the movies, or the semi-annoying and uncessesary Tenchi in Tokyo. I don't know when in the timeline it takes place exactly but it does occur after Tenchi Muyo Ryo-Ohki as Tenchi's father re-married to Rea and the start of War on Geminar is Kenshi, Tenchi's half brother. Given that Kenchi's age is 16, we can figure it occurs at least 15 years after GXP. That doesn't help much but hey, it's Tenchi after all and the timeline never makes sense.

I wanted to go into this series without any pre-conceived notions so I didn't watch any trailers and didn't read any reviews other than the brief synopsis that it involves Tenchi's half brother, a strange planet, mecha, and women of course. I was really unsure though given how Tenchi Moyo Rho-ohki turned out. Although I liked the finishing of the original OVA, it almost felt like someone took the original OVA, added a bunch of new characters and thoughts, and shoved them into a blender to come up with that story. A lot of it made no sense at best, and deflated some of my ideas of Tenchi's mother and family at the same time. GXP is a series that is a guilty pleasure with over-the-top harem comedy at times, absurdly silly plot-lines, and loose connections between stories with little in the way of a coherent goal to the series. Still, I liked it. This series is nothing like either of those.

There are references to the other members of the Tenchi universe, with Kenshi's mother Rea named and Washu shown briefly. Kenshi discusses others in the family, especially his ""sisters"" and I could have sworn at one point in Part 2 he referenced sister's in law (and some understanding out of Japan is Tenchi ends up marrying the entire clan of women in his house), his grandfather, and father. None but Washu are ever seen and she is only in the briefest of moments. In Part 2 we see what may be a sword similar to the one Tenchi manifested against Kagato in the original OVA but no light-hawk wings.

To me, War on Geminar felt like the clock was reversed slightly with regards to the storytelling of the canon universe. It is very similar to some of the original OVA storytelling in style, with a more seasoned approach to the writing as well as the current standards in anime harem comedy thrown in. It felt far more coherent, with the typical anime plot absurdities that you just don't really follow at times but that's ok because that doesn't matter to the storytelling one bit. The anime styling itself is crisp and clean with only a few scenes where you wonder if they just kept repeating the same background plate due to laziness. The characters are decently developed, some more so than others but that's only understandable because there are a lot of them. With harem comedies, it's easy to become afraid of how stupid or outrageous it can be when you have that many female characters in a story, but it really doesn't go down that path.

The Funimation voice acting is good, and you can hear a number of Funimation regulars performing. I think they all did a good job and found myself in the unusual position of not being annoyed that I was listening to the dubbed version as it was well-cast.

Part 1 has more tongue in cheek moments, and is more in keeping with what you would expect of the Tenchi universe and harem comedies in general. Part 2 takes a more serious tone, but also has a number of pleasant and light hearted moments.
All in all, this is a very pleasant surprise and a very welcome edition to the Tenchi universe.",1407974400,,3822,4.533333333333333
5579223,5,B00BCPOFQ2,The set was great you get both the blue ray and the reg DVD. The blue ray looks great and the discs all work properly.  My order also came right on schedule and nothing in the DVD case was broken. If you like any tenchi muyo you will like this.,1407628800,,244,3.88
5579224,5,B00BCPOFQ2,Awesome animation.,1406678400,,18,8.5
5579245,5,B00BCPOFQ2,"Tenchi Muyo! is used almost as a trade name here.  In anime, the character always similar in appearance stemmed from a series of direct to video adventures of a boy who didn't know his hidden powers.  When his curiosity gets the better of him he awakens both his powers and Ryoko a 700 year old demon trapped in a cave on his grandfathers shrine property.  Tenchi, often studies swordsmanship with his grandfather or by himself with a wooden sword so he has skills, and a hidden power within him to use an alien technology.  Once he awakens Ryoko he attracts a bunch of other characters, may of whom seem to have a romantic attachment to him, making this one of the more popular harem type anime.  I'm talking the original now and the reason is if you haven't seen it or one of the tv season remakes (there are two complete remakes of the OAV series, which dumb the storyline down for kids), is that you'll lose references in this story to that other world of Tenchi!

This character is named Kenshi Masaki, the last name of Tenchi, and supposedly a cousin or some such of him, but it's never really made clear.  He doesn't come off as clueless as the original Tenchi character, and seems to have his own agenda most of the time.  The plot has him sent from a parallel universe (apparently the real world of Tenchi), and there is some sort of purpose.  He becomes a pawn in a complicated political struggle, that eventually turns into an all out war.  Like the Tenchi series that long proceeded this, the lines of good and evil although the motivations of the characters are blurred make strongly drawn plot lines, so not much is really muddled.  It makes for some entertaining fare.  The authors have a nose for amazement and light comedy, and this is a very good anime.  Recommended for most anime fans except the type that like a lot of blood and guts.  Themes are harem, mecha, magic, parallel world, superhuman, empowered girls, and a lot of RPG elements.",1404518400,,1960,4.53125

5579251,3,B00BCPOFQ2,"Don't be fooled by the title...This is no Tenchi Muyo!

Though the series does take place in the Tenchi Universe and is considered to fall in the Ryo-Ohki and GXP timeline it's not as good as the previously stated series or Ova. There is no real history to the Hero, Kenshi Masaki (Tenchi's younger brother) or how he arrived on that particular world. The story telling is choppy at times and the chemistry that was seen in previous Tenchi series just doesn't exist here.

As for the positives, the art style does fall in line with the previous series and OVA but that's really about it. The colors and characters are also bright and vivid. It just seems though the story telling was dumbed down to make it appealing for a younger viewing audience.",1389657600,,748,4.574626865671642

Their should have been more of an effort made to have artwork on the DVD cover for example look at Heaven's  Lost Property first box as well as Amagami SS and Amagami SS Plus DVD disk have beautiful artwork on the disk.

5579276,4,B00BCPOFQ2,"When FUNimation brought out the English dub teaser for this animu (along with the frighteningly LARGE cast list), I figured I decided to go check this show out. And originally; I wanted nothing to do with ""yet another haremy animu where the women rule everything, the guys are proven LOSERS, and features enough fanservice to warrant a need for full-on adult anime but won't do it because the people behind it don't have enough spine.""

Well... ""Kenshi Muyo"" / Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari is basically ""Tenchi Muyo"" done right to a certain extent. Replacing the male lead Tenchi, who spent most of his time being pathetic; with Kenshi who's basically, ""The Most Interesting Shounen In The Word."" Kenshi has the capability to kick his own harem's asses, yet doesn't come off as some malicious sadist douche bag. In fact, he's a nice guy who's allergic to ""doing wrong.""

It's the first half of the 13-episode box set; but it's already got:

* Delicious Dark Elf
* Girls by the shipload.
* A few characters being two or three.
* Happy Ending Massage Trope
* ""Couple B"" Ceres (""crouching normal, hidden white knight"") & Hazuki
* A Hot MILF
* Hot Chairwomen
* The ""Char Aznable Clone""
* Shout-Outs to Ghost N Da Shell and Daul Photon

The Japanese audio of these disks (atleast on the Blu-Ray), unfortunately, isn't as crisp and clear as the English audio. The show itself didn't rely too heavily on 3D animation; some small animation mistakes can still be found within the show.

As always: Major props go to my longtime favorites Caitlin Glass, Cherami Leigh, J. Michael Tatum, Jamie Marchi, Monica Rial, Brina Palencia, Christopher R. Sabat, Colleen Clinkenbeard, and Josh Grelle for making this another fun FUNi dub.

Finally; I wish FUNi would stop spending too much time on fanservicy ""loser shounen"" animu and put more effort in differentiating their licensed shows. You seen one piece of crap, you seen 'em all; and you can spot one from a mile away. As a matter of fact, where's ""Betrayal Knows My Name?"" Where's ""Rogue Hero's Aesthetics,"" FUNi?",1375920000,,2052,4.815340909090909
5579277,3,B00BCPOFQ2,"As other people have mentioned, Funimation's translation and summary description of the show is just silly. The translation totally destroys the lore of this world, and I figure, had Geneon sill been around, they probably would have managed to keep the show within the realms of its own genre. This world has never been to space yet there is the mention of intergalactic battles? Funmation wants to make this show seem to be a mecha genre when obviously it is not. The show's setting is clearly fantasy, and more on the lines of Escaflowne. Second of all the blu-ray quality is not up to par. While it looks sharper and cleaner, the Blu-rays still look fuzzy and not the crystal clear picture you get that some other blu-ray anime show. I felt that Funimation got the original animation clips and just stretched the dimenions to the size of blu-ray. I'm a bit disappointed in Funimation this time.  Funimation can do whatever they want with the dubs and script but at least keep your genre's correct. If you are going to buy from Funimation, buy with caution.

5579293,4,B00BCPOFQ2,"In 2009, a spinoff OVA series that is a spin-off of ""Tenchi Muyo!"" was created by original creator Masaki Kajishima.

Presented in 13 OVA episodes which was released from March 2009-March 2010 and produced by AIC Spirits and BeSTACK, the OVA series would lead to a light novel adaptation by Atsushi Wada in 2009, a manga adaptation serialized in Comic REX in 2010 and now released in America on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of FUNimation (Note: Part 1 features the first seven OVA episodes).

According to Kajishima, the anime is part of the ""Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki"" continuity and takes place 15 years after the events of ""Tenchi Muyo! GXP"".  Because ""Tenchi Muyo!: War on Geminar"" features the debut of Tenchi's half brother Kenshi, this would lead many fans to discuss theories of Kenshi and its connection to the original series.

The series revolves around 15-year-old Kenshi Masaki who ended up in an alternate world of Geminar.  This world has been waging war against each other using Sacred Mechanoids (humanoid weapons discovered in ancient ruins).

We are first introduced to Lashara Earth XXVIII, the 12-year-old ruler of the Shrtrayu Empire and her bodyguard Chiaia Flan who fights against intruders in the Holy Land.  One of these intruders proves to be an excellent fighter and is revealed to be Kenshi.

Kenshi has been ordered to assassinate Lashara Earth XXVIII but can't do it as he is not a killer.  Seeing good within Kenshi, as the group hold him captive and to find out his whereabouts, it is quickly learned that Kenshi is not of this world.  In fact, he was being used by the enemies of Shtrayu Empire who had promised him a safe return back to his homeworld, which became false.

Finding out he had been betrayed, he is rescued by Dark Elf Aura Shurifon, who returns him back to Lashara.  But they realize that he has caught a disease and will die unless he receives treatment.  So, everyone works quickly to try and save him.

For now, Kenshi can be useful to the empire who is suffering from enormous debt.  So, as they try to find a way for Kenshi to return back home, Lashara Earth XXVIII has Kenshi become her assistant, so he can learn and assimilate with society (which the female population outnumber males by a very large margin).  So, naturally many of the women he comes into contact with are impressed by his demeanor, his work ethic and are amazed by his uncanny fighting skills and bravery.

But as Lashara and those working for her try to keep Kenshi's identity secret, there are those in the Holy Land who are working for the enemy and are keeping their eyes on Kenshi.

VIDEO:

""Tenchi Muyo!: War on Geminar - Part 1 is presented in 1080p High Definition.  Because the series is an OVA series and not a television series, I was expecting the picture quality to be vibrant and fully-detailed.  If anything, ""Tenchi Muyo! War on Geminar"" seems more like a television series when it comes to picture quality.

There is a hint of softness, but the series does feature good shading, character and mechanical designs designs but similar to the original series, tends to use a lot of lush backgrounds, blue skies, mountains, a lot of trees, etc.  But there are some emphasis on building structures, cement walls and most importantly its use of mechanical designs with Mecha featured throughout the series.  There is also a good use of CG for floating structures and backgrounds. There are some indoor scenes which are nicely detailed but overall, picture quality is good but it is a bit soft.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Tenchi Muyo!: War on Geminar"" is presented in Japanese and English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  I have to admit that I was so excited for the lossless soundtrack because the opening theme really comes out crystal clear and utilizes the surround channels immediately.  But the overall presentation, while clear, is not as immersive as I would have hoped.  Audio is primarily dialogue driven and center and front-channel, while music gets the surround sound treatment.  But for a television series, audio is could and didn't notice any difference in terms of surround sound use on both Japanese or English lossless tracks.

Subtitles are in English.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I have been watching every ""Tenchi Muyo!"" series since it was first released in Japan.  A big fan of the original OVA's and animated films, it's always fascinating to see how the storyline is without the characters that fans have followed for many years.

First with ""Tenchi Muyo! GXP"" and now with ""Tenchi Muyo! War on Geminar"", what will interest fans the most is the introduction of a 15-year-old named Kenshi, the half brother of Tenchi Masaki.  How did this happen?  Fans will find theories from other fans about who Kenshi may be.  But in terms of the series, we have Kenshi stuck in another world and for the first half, the series is more introductory to the characters and a secret plot taking place behind-the-scenes.

While the latter is setting up the storyline for the second half of the OVA series, the first half tends to be more harem like.

Because Geminar is a female dominated planet, because Kenshi has special abilities, speed, strength and a good guy overall, many female characters want to marry him.  Actually, many of the female student body at the Academy wants to be with Kenshi.

There are references to the ""Tenchi Muyo!"" characters such as Washu and others when Kenshi is questioned about his home and these crystals that belong to him.  But also his unusual abilities that surpass normal people in the planet.

Harem anime fans will enjoy the sexual humor as women want to be naked with Kenshi, women tease Kenshi that if he saw them naked, he would have to marry him.  And there are a lot of scenes that feature these women and teenage girls really doing all they can to be close to him.

While harem storyline is nothing new to the ""Tenchi Muyo!"" series, the main difference is that a large number of women and teenage girls want to be near Kenshi.  In fact, in episode 6, one of the girl's mothers just wants to have her fun around Kenshi and somehow Kenshi has earned a reputation of having magic ""massaging"" hands.

But the first part of ""Tenchi Muyo! War on Geminar"" are character establishing episodes and how any of these women want Kenshi badly.  It sounds like a story that came from a visual novel, but I hope the storyline does become more serious in the second half.  But because of the sexual humor, you may not want to watch this series with children in the room.

As for the Blu-ray release, while I can't refer to the packaging or the booklet which comes with part 1, I can comment on the picture quality.  I have to admit that I was a bit surprised that the OVA series looked more like a television series.  Back in the day, ""Tenchi Muyo!"" was a series that captivated our attention at anime club screenings as the series was known as a quality series on LaserDisc at the time.  Fast forward to 2010, when this series was first released, while shown on the Animax pay per view channel, I was hoping for sharper, crisper animation and less softness.  But the series was soft and while many scenes did have good detail for its art backgrounds and some scenes and characters were well-shaded, it seemed more like the picture quality of a TV series than OVA series.

As for the lossless soundtrack, I loved how the music was utilized for the surround channels but I was hoping the action sequences would feature a bit more LFE and surround use.  Dialogue and music are crystal clear but was hoping for something more immersive.

For special features, you get many of the Japanese special features included with part 1 and you also get a single audio commentary featuring the English dub voice talent and the FUNimation crew that worked on the series.

Overall, ""Tenchi Muyo!: War on Geminar"" is a harem sci-fi anime series that is enjoyable and fun, but expect the second half to feature much more action and a more serious storyline.  If you are a fan of ""Tenchi Muyo!"", while none of the original characters appear in this OVA series, we are introduced to Kenshi Masaki, a 15-year-old half brother of Tenchi that is stuck in an alternate world and must find a way back home.  But also stuck in a planet that is primarily all-female, so for a guy like Kenshi...it's open season for many of these young women and teenage girls.",1372896000,,9531,4.739975698663426
5579294,2,B00BCPOFQ2,"It started off slow and clearly didn't have the same type of ""magic"" as you would expect from the regular Tenchi series. Rather disappointing and I would recommend a rental instead.",1372723200,,181,4.870967741935484
5579295,5,B00BCPOFQ2,If you like the tenchi muyo animes then you would like this. It somewhat links to the other tenchi muyo shows and takes place 15 years after GXP I'm not going to ruin it for you but it is worth watching. Why did I rate it 5 stars? Cause I have seen all the other tenchi muyo show and I like this one too. I also like how it is some what all connected well not all but some and the others are different.,1372377600,,402,3.7976190476190474
5579296,4,B00BCPOFQ2,"Was a very good series, that I watched on Hulu, and wanted to get the Blu-ray version for my own collection, but at $51 for part one, and $49 for part two, is just to much.",1371945600,,172,3.8055555555555554
5579297,1,B00BCPOFQ2,This is a very good series but come on $60 for part one its a 13 episode series for gods sake funamations this is why people torrent and just don't buy your product stuff like this is the reseaon anime companies had so many issues. Instead of pricing better ie 30 for part one(honestly its 13 episodes make it one damn collection) and you would likely have more sales. I for one while I can afford it easy enough will not pay this rip off price. I'll just wait for it to go down or get it used.,1371772800,,494,4.051020408163265
5579298,2,B00BCPOFQ2,"As other reviewers have stated, the main character is 'suposedly' Tenchi's half brother. You actually see the shadow of Washu (once), and that is it for the original cast. There are a few rare references (not by name) of a few of the old posse, but very rare. The first half is slice of life, and the second part&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tenchi-Muyo-War-on-Geminar-Part-2-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo/dp/B00BCPOFPS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tenchi Muyo! War on Geminar, Part 2 (Blu-ray/DVD Combo)</a>&nbsp;is about the actual war (which is also a joke).

There is no explanation of why he is on Geminar, no explanation of why the bad guys are bad, or (looking at the second part) how, why, where, the big bad came from. There really is no depth to the story at all.

If all you want is fan service, there is plenty of that, but if your looking for a who, what, when, where, and how, yeah... not this one. It's ok, but sadly lacking, the characters are as shallow, and I am disapointed that I purchased it.",1369872000,2,1045,5.214285714285714
5579299,5,B00BCPOFQ2,"Well in this case the half brother of Tenchi is in a bit of a pickle. The series starts off with Kenchi not on Earth and they don't go into detail on how he got where he is.  Episode one starts off with plenty of action and an introduction to many of the girls in the series. I'm not going to reveal spoilers but Kenchi is much like his elder brother and has the hard working thing down pat thanks to the time spent with his ""nee-sans"" as they all taught him something as he was growing up.  A fun start to a series and I can safely say it is worth giving a chance.",1369699200,,565,3.9043478260869566
5579300,3,B00BCPOFQ2,"I'll be the first to say this is a great series.  However, Funimation's translation contained a number of issues I found extremely frustrating.  There weren't too many real errors, but some of the translation choices were annoying or worse.  For instance, Funimation sometimes seems to want to overemphasize genre in their translation, made obvious here with their obsessive insertion of ""mecha"" wherever they think they can get away with it.  ""Holy Armor"" suddenly becomes ""Sacred Mechanoid"", and ""Holy Knight"" turns into ""Sacred Mechamaster"", and largely unrelated devices like Wahan's robot are given almost identical names.  The ultimate result to me was to make a lot of things sound silly.
What was far worse was the series description.  Where in the world did these people get the idea of the conflicts being ""intergalactic""?  This'd be the first intergalactic battle I've seen that takes place entirely on one planet, involving people who don't appear to have ever even heard of space flight, with one single boy from another dimension(or something) stranded there whose civilization has barely managed to reach their moon.  I've often felt that Funimation's descriptions and advertisements went a little overboard emphasizing specific aspects they thought would sell (in particular focusing entirely on fanservice regardless of the story that goes along with it), showing no interest in anything past the obvious, but this's the first time they seemed to create a description that makes up a completely different story altogether.",1369612800,5,1539,5.383333333333334
5579301,4,B00BCPOFQ2,"Kenshi Masaki is the half brother of Tenchi Masaki. Somehow he was summoned to another planet called Geminar. He doen't know why or how he got there though. Fortunately, this planet is mostly inhabited by hot chicks that are all crazy about Kenshi. Kenshi enters a school for young mecha pilots. Part 1 of this series mainly covers his daily life and develops his relationship with the girls at the school. There is, however, trouble brewing on Geminar. A mysterious group has plans that threaten the people of Geminar, and somehow, Kenshi fits into their plan.

I expected a little more action from this series, because of the title, ""War On Geminar"". I think that the war actually starts in part 2. There are some major differences with this series and the original Tenchi Muyo  series that this spins off of. The characters are the main difference. They are all good though. This set has 7-50 minute episodes. So it is actually a long as a 26-episode series if you include part 2. The  situations are more suggestive than the original series, but there isn't any nudity. I think it should be rated PG-13, but whatever. The animation, voice acting and soundtrack are all top notch; as you probably expected from the Tenchi franchise. Although different from what I expected, this series did entertain me. I hope it picks up a bit in part 2, and I wish that it was a little cheaper. Other than those 2 little details, I think this is a good buy. If you like the older Tenchi series, you'll probably enjoy this one too.",1369180800,4,1519,4.618518518518519
