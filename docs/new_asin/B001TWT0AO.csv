3794553,5,B001TWT0AO,"I recently took a 'staycation' at home and watched the first 52 episodes of The Mod Squad. It was one of my favorite shows when it originally aired in the 60s/70s. I was a teenager - always on the lookout for a cute guy. But The Mod Squad is more than just a cute guy, a hip chick and a smart, succinct & 'solid' black guy. It was a show that reflected it's time more than anything else.

I would recommend all four volumes to anyone who loved this show, or anyone who wants to understand what the 60s were like. The cast was perfect and outstanding for their roles. Season 1, Volume 1 has extra features that include interviews with Michael Cole and Peggy Lipton, who tell a lot of fun stories about their time on the show. Yes, Clarence Williams III is absent from the special features, but it may have been his choice, who knows? At the time the beginning volumes were released in 2007, he was involved in 'Mystery Woman' with Kellie Martin on Hallmark Channel.

My favorite episode of all the 52 is ""A Time for Remembering."" Not your typical flashback show - the sensitve portrayals by the cast members as they deal with a vengeful ex-convict's shooting of one of their own is a true treat. The ex-con is the first guy they put away. You can see him in Season One, Volume One, the pilot episode entitled ""The Teeth of the Barracuda.""

There are great guest stars, some already famous, and some who became famous later. I enjoyed figuring out some of them. Some of them I hadn't seen in a show for a long time. There's even a special feature on the first season called ""The Friends of The Mod Squad,"" featuring Ed Asner, Lesley Warren, Lou Gossett, Jr. & Tyne Daly.

I hope the other seasons will be released. I'm waiting especially for Episode #91 - I Am My Brother's Keeper, a Season Four episode. I haven't seen it in many years. But there's a whole season to be released before that (26 episodes).

Yes, I was bummed at each season being split into 13 episodes per set - but as many times as I plan to watch these shows, I'm sure I'll get my money's worth. I bought them when they were a bit reduced. I'll be watching for specials.

I highly recommend these videos for anyone interested at all in The Mod Squad. They are truly STILL MOD after all these years.",1276560000,5,2266,4.3451536643026
3794554,5,B001TWT0AO,"As a child of the 60s I could not get enough of this hip trio.  I wondered if it would still hold up and it does!  The chemistry between Michael Cole, Peggy Lipton and Clarence Williams III is as engaging today as it was over 40 years ago.  It is obvious they care a great deal for each other.  The stories are great.  The acting is great.

I still want to be a member of the Mod Squad.  Solid",1271894400,,393,3.8987341772151898
3794555,5,B001TWT0AO,I love this show.  I used to watch this on tv back in the day and it brings back alot of memories from my childhood and how easy things were over 30 years ago.  I love looking back on this show with all the hip clothes and people that embodied the 60's and 70's. The show was different and not like most cop shows.  I loved the characters and the story lines.  I am so glad they brought this out as I always wondered if they would ever show this show again on one of the cable networks that deal with shows from the past.  If you like nostalgia and want to relive a certain time in your life and love cops shows I would highly recommend all the dvd's of this show.,1266364800,3,664,3.962406015037594
3794556,5,B001TWT0AO,"These group of actors were the STUFF!!! I never missed an episode.
I am a 51 yr old African American female. And during my time in South Central LA.Seeing young people that looked so hip and dressed hip was unheard of back then this show was truly ""cutting edge"" for their time. I wished they worl release more shows. I will buy everyone of them. These actors were before there time!!!",1265587200,6,385,4.436619718309859
3794557,5,B001TWT0AO,"The Mod Squad is a family favourite.  With productions like these, makes you wonder what happened to technology.  Great color, great script and great photography.  What more could a movie want?",1265155200,2,193,5.161290322580645
3794558,5,B001TWT0AO,"I was born in 1962 and immigrated to the US in late 1969 with my family, landing, as so many before us did, in New York.  If you know anything of history, or better yet, if you're old enough to remember, those times were unlike any that had gone before or have come since.  Nearly revolutionary in their scope and power, but far more hopeful than bitter, a youthful, yearning energy to build a better world seemed to be driving the cultural change and upheaval of those times.  I vividly remember staring at the beautiful young people on the streets (though all older than me at the time) with their long hair, and their wild clothes, as strains of Cream, Led Zeppelin and other psychedelia drifted out of open windows.

At the same time, I discovered The Mod Squad.  Being only seven to ten or so when the show was on the air, I knew at once it was dealing with the culture that I had seen ""out there"" and from which all of Middle America seemed to be trying so hard to hide.  I was also too young to fully understand what was truly going on and how this TV show fit in.  And then it was gone.  The show was cancelled in 1973.  The hippies disappeared off the streets, the music slowly changed and the world grew older.

But the memory of this show stayed with me, frozen in my mind like a secret, shining picture of a youthful promise that was somehow never fulfilled, in part because of my own broken and fragmented memories and understanding of the cultural and political changes of the strangely foreign nation to which we had come back in 1969.

Imagine then, my excitement at finding out that The Mod Squad was finally being released on DVD.  Other shows had run in syndication and been released on DVD, but The Mod Squad had not been seen again since 1973, except briefly, I understand, on Nick at Night and in a limited and incomplete VHS release.  It had disappeared just like the hopeful promise of those times it portrayed.  And now, I was finally going to be able to see it, granted as a forty-something adult, but at least understanding would no longer be a problem.  Honestly, I was expecting a trip down memory lane and not much more.

What I got instead was a terrific TV show.  The writing is solid (pun intended) and the four characters at the center of the show hold it all together effortlessly and impressively well.  Pete Cochrane is the person every guy would have wanted to be: young, handsome, capable, caring without being weak, courageous, funny and unswervingly loyal to his fellow squad.  Linc is the kind of guy you wanted to know, and the guy you wanted on your side; the guy there for you when things got tough.  Almost frighteningly intense in his beliefs, ethics and convictions, you know that he's by far the most likely to lay down his life for his beliefs or his friends.

Julie Barnes - what can you say?  It seems positively chauvinist to start by discussing her looks, but more than being a beautiful young woman, she seemed to somehow portray the ""standard"" of her era, the way that Farrah Fawcett would do a few years later for the late `70's or like Marilyn Monroe had for the fifties.  Julie is sweet, sensitive, and the description of her as ""the canary with a broken wing"" that I believe Aaron Spelling himself used for the character is right on the mark.  It's too bad that she's also the only weak link in the show.

Don't get me wrong, I love Julie like all the rest, but more than Pete and Linc, she's a product and a victim of her era.  When the Mod Squad premiered in 1968, it was just two years after Gene Roddenberry had been forced by network execs (read idiots in charge) to put his female Star Trek officers in skirts, a mere seven years after Rob and Laura Petrie weren't allowed to sleep in the same bed, and the same era when certain TV stations in the US wouldn't run Bewitched because it depicted - witches.  Is it truly possible that was only 40 years ago?

But unfortunately, the character of Julie Barnes only seems to go as far as the producers felt they could get away with.  Rather than the capable, skilled, crime fighter she could have been, more along the lines of Mrs. Emma Peel in the slightly earlier, but still contemporary British show The Avengers, Julie Barnes is more often relegated to the role of the damsel in distress.  What a wasted opportunity!  It would take years and years before we finally would get a heroine who could hold her own along with the boys.  Lara Croft, I'm talking to you!  Aside from that, Julie's emotional side at times verges on whining, but hey, I can live with that.  At least, she's far more substantial than mere eye candy.

Peggy Lipton, I have to say with a slightly irksome tone, is also the only one of the three who is periodically absent from the show, or whose role at times is so small that the only explanation could be that the actress wasn't completely available.  While I fully understand the demands of life and work, if Michael Cole and Clarence Williams III could show up every day, why couldn't she?

Tige Andrews as Captain Adam Greer is the perfect anchor who holds the three young undercover cops together, all at once as their superior, leader, supporter, father figure and friend, pushing when necessary, reluctantly holding back when he knows it's the right thing to do, and plain staying out of things when he has to.

The cast all play their characters with an ease and conviction that it's easy to forget you're watching actors.  The stories are well written and constructed, and while they sometimes verge on the ""softer"" side of things (a Spelling trademark and standard), there are also any number of episodes that deal with serious and certainly at the time taboo subjects.  The dialogue seems natural for the era without being too ""culture locked"" and never feels forced.

Having said all that (yes too much, I know) what has surprised me more than anything is just the plain quality of the show and production.  Like I said, I would have been happy with a nostalgic trip down memory lane, but what I got instead was a high quality, exceptionally well done and unique police drama that I repeatedly look forward to watching again and again.  The fights are exciting and real without being constant and over done, the car chases are good and realistic, and our heroes, while being heroes, certainly are closer to being ""real"" people than the ""super"" heroes we've gotten in the post John Rambo era.

Lastly, and admittedly, this could just be my own crumudgeoness coming to the fore, I'm struck with how ""pretty"" the world looks in the show.  The colors are bright and vivid, the cars all look great, the clothes are fun; none of the crumbling infrastructure of America and the cookie-cutter, nonsensically enormous SUV's that we see all around these days.  Oh, and not a Starbucks nor a cell phone in sight!  How'd they do it?!

And incidentally, check the runtimes for each show: 49-52 minutes!  50 minutes on average of quality TV in an era when the programming was free.  Today, you're lucky to get 41 to 42 minutes and you pay through the teeth for it.  All that and one of the most fun theme songs ever in TV history.

I can't wait for the release of the next season's installment.  If you're a fan you know what I'm talking about, and if you're not, you don't know what you're missing.  I urge you to pick up these DVD's.  You'll be glad you did.",1246752000,37,7393,4.497378277153558
3794559,5,B001TWT0AO,"That's what Linc always said, and that's what I say for this DVD. Season two continues with more great stories, action and adventure. In Vol. 2 Sammy Davis Jr. and a very young Richard Dreyfuss make their first guest appearances. Chief Metcalf asks the squad to find his daughter who has disappeared, and Linc fights for his life while we see flashbacks of the squad's first two years on the force. The picture quality is still excellent--bright and clear like it was a brand new show. I can't wait for the rest of the seasons!",1243900800,5,527,4.557894736842106
3794560,5,B001TWT0AO,"The Mod Squad is a seminal television show for several reasons. One is that it was so clearly a product of its times - from the clothes, hairdos, to its rebellious, revolutionary, hippie sensibilities.

The second reason is that The Mod Squad was the beginning of the legendary producing legacy of Aaron Spelling, and his many years of providing viewer-friendly programs to both ABC and Fox. Although he had worked as an actor and writer, and had already produced Johnny Ringo and Burke's Law, The Mod Squad began an incredible and unprecedented almost forty year run of producing television shows that captured fans with either high-octane action sequences, or opulent comedies or soap-operatic dramas. The partial list includes The Rookies, SWAT, Charlie's Angels, Starsky and Hutch, Vegas, Hotel, The Love Boat, Fantasy Island, Dynasty, Beverly Hills 90210, Melrose Place, and Charmed.

But still at the heart of this show was the rapport and relationship between the three street kids who were rounded up and rehabilitated into undercover cops - rich kid Pete Cochran (Michael Cole), runaway Julie Barnes (Peggy Lipton), and taciturn revolutionary Lincoln Hayes (Clarence Williams III. Pete, Julie, and Linc had immediate street cred with the mostly young felons they ran across, and even though it could be testy or frosty, their relationship with their mentor and rehabilitator, Captain Adam Greer (played by Tige Andrews)was solid, and they grew to have much mutual love and respect and affection.

The shows could stretch credulity almost to the breaking point, but the shows dealt with relevant issues, were very entertaining, and well written and well acted.

It is a great treat to watch these episodes again, and we can look forward to the release of the other episodes with great anticipation.",1235520000,13,1806,5.195876288659794

3794584,5,B001TWT0AO,"I loved this dvd. I loved this show in the 70. I never missed an episode or the repeats in the 5 years it was on. So owning these episodes on dvd is like reliving my childhood. The stories are still revelant even if the clothes are not and the scenes that use stuntmen are not as sharp as now but the real reason to buy these, is the stories and the relationship of the 4 main characters.
They care for each other and they take care of each other. Anyone who watched this show in the 70's will still love watching them now. I bought the first two season, can't wait for the other three seasons. Please bring them out soon.",1371513600,,622,4.10655737704918

3794586,4,B001TWT0AO,"The Mod Squad was a challenging show that I enjoyed as a youngster. The vulnerable Julie, the exiled Pete, and the thoughtful Linc were so cool. We bought this set to see if we would enjoy it even now and still do. Clarence Williams III's (Linc's) perceptive, thoughtful, and athletic portrayal are especially enjoyable. We have found it a vehicle for discussion of drug use, Hollywood's portrayals of certain points of views, of history (ancient since there were no cell phones) with our twelve-year-old daughter. Most of the episodes are high quality, feature good photography, and demonstrate a well-written story.  The acting, especially Clarence Williams III's, are excellent. My husband considers Linc's character as the foundational character of the series. If you want a series to discuss and enjoy with your kids, you might try this.",1358553600,,842,5.1911764705882355

The Mod Squad was absolutely my favorite show when I was growing up in the late '60's/early '70s.  I cannot find it in syndication on television anywhere, so having the first two seasons on DVD is a dream come true for me.  It not only brings back those wonderful childhood memories, but it's also so refreshing to watch a show that isn't focused on sex and lewd behavior among adults.  I love the story lines.  I can't wait for the other seasons to come out because I will definitely be buying them!",1341446400,,585,4.420560747663552

I have noticed that DVD/Blue ray players are now very resonable in price and offer a picture and sound quality cable and satelite can't come close to. As for this particular title it was originally on when I was in high school so I didn't get to see  it much but when I did I liked it now I have time to watch it. I have noticed that there is a great number of the older TV shows available on DVD and Blue Ray and I have started to build a good collection and Amazon.com is one of the best places to buy them they offer a great many titles at a very good price.
