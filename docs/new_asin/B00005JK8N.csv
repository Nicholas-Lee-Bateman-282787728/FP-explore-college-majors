Chris Rock's ... ""Pootie Tang"" is the worst movie of the summer being it had no real plot, or acting, or humor.  ...  The title of the film explains what the movie, itself, is.  Without going any further, let's just say that this film is probably one of the dumbest movies in a long time!  Don't waste your money, or your valuable time!",998352000,2,340,4.265625
1433775,4,B00005JK8N,"There were seven people in the theater, including myself, my girlfriend, and another one of our friends.  We counted at least ten people leaving the theater during the course of the movie.  That, more than anything else you can say, just goes to show what an amazing experience this film was.",997315200,2,292,4.705882352941177
1433776,5,B00005JK8N,"Baby, I've never laughed this hard. This is a true work of genius. I never saw the chris rock show so I can say this film stands out on its own merit. If you can only appreciate the mundane kind of jokes you have to rationalize and figure out (or those that need to have gross..content to have effect), then you'll be [upset]like Mr. Wylie below. However, if you wanna get some classic entertainment that's in good taste, you give this one a try.",994809600,3,446,4.321428571428571
1433777,2,B00005JK8N,"This movie has it's moments, but they're all in the trailer!  Perhaps this movie is a spectacular satire as some say, if it is, it is not an accessible one.  Even Chris Rock wasn't funny.",994550400,,187,4.314285714285714
1433778,1,B00005JK8N,"It's bad when half the audience gets up and walks out before the movie is half over. That's what happen when I went. I've only walked out of one other movie and that was years ago. I like most movies, but I can't believe this was endorsed by Chris Rock, MTV and Paramount pictures. I have yet to see a Chris Rock interview on this one. Wonder why?? And guess what? I like Chris Rock, that's why I went to see this movie. Yuck!!",994550400,,427,4.095238095238095
1433779,4,B00005JK8N,"This movie plays like a Blaxplotation flick of the 70's.  It's straight tribute/...of that genre.  If you figure that out from the beginning, and like that type of thing, than this movie is hilarious.  If you don't get the joke, then you'll ask the manager for your money back (which a couple did when I went to see the movie).  My friends and I (who are all college educated, well-to-do, 20-somethings) loved this movie.  The other thing that would help you like this movie is knowing who Pootie Tang is.  If you haven't seen the Chris Rock show, watch an episode with Pootie in it first and then come and see the movie.  But DEFINETLY come and see this movie!!!
SINE YOUR PITTY ON RUNNY KINE!

1433780,4,B00005JK8N,"When I opened the paper this morning and saw that Pootie Tang had been given a mere one star, I knew that I had to see this movie. These are the same idiots, I thought, who ripped apart Freddy Got Fingered, and weren't they ever wrong there! So I rounded up my buddies and informed them that like heck if I was seeing that garbage movie ""A.I."" (Just because a guy's made a few good movies doesn't mean his poo doesn't stink, folks.) Not five minutes of Pootie Tang had gone by when I knew that I was in for a real treat: this movie is HILARIOUS. Now, I will admit - the theater was filled to less than 10% capacity, and it was pretty quiet, save for myself and my two friends. Nevermind that - if you're not laughing until it hurts at pretty much everything in this movie, you're thinking way too hard about it. I won't bother to relate any of the particulars of the plot - suffice to say it's the journey of a hero who falls from grace, but redeems himself and learns that while on one hand you have to separate the right from the wrong, it's best to do it with a little love. Add in cameos by Andy Richter, David Cross, and various others, throw in a dash of funk, and you've got Pootie Tang.",994032000,5,1194,4.128755364806867
1433781,5,B00005JK8N,"Obviousely, Wylie was a little confused.  He couldn't have possibly seen the movie yet since it was just released yesterday (June 29).  So I don't understand how he could have so much to say about a movie he's never seen before.  I know he never saw the movie because the date he wrote the review was the 21st of June. Pootie came out the 29th.  Pootie Tang was hilariously funny and I reccomend it to anyone looking for a good laugh.  I know I'll be there first to buy Pootie Tang on DVD the day it comes out. This movie was a masterpiece, and I think it was one of the best comedies of the year!",993859200,3,597,4.112068965517241
1433782,1,B00005JK8N,"Bad, Bad, Bad! I'd rather see a 5 hour Teletubie movie then see Pootie Tang. It was the STUPIDEST, DUMBEST, MOST RETARDED movie ever in the history of Hollywood. I can't believe it made it to the theaters. It's God awful. Don't bother to see it!!! Trust me!",993081600,18,257,4.375

This is one of those films you hear about and wonder if they really do live up to the way they are represented in other films.  I think this one was mentioned in Scary Movie 4.  During a parody scene of the matrix with the late George Carlin as the engineer.  I am having a hard time rating this movie.  On the one hand, I can't stand the way Pootie Tang talks.  I'm not grasping the comedy aspect of someone spounting a bunch of words I don't understand or even care to.  The constant snapping of the belt got old all too fast.  The overuse of established stereotypes like the dirty government workers or the pimp drug dealer (do I really need to see another purple jacket) is just not funny.  The whole movie is a cliche'.  I did like the twist where young Pootie Tang was being hit by his father, played by Chris Rock, in the beginning.  Then after his father dies, Pootie Tang grows up and hits one of his crew, also, played by Chris Rock.  The more I watched.  The more I started hating this movie.  The guys name refers to ""Butt Orange Drink"".  He's not the least bit cool.  And famous for no reason.  As a matter of fact, the longer you watch.  The more annoying he gets.  I honestly wanted to finish watching this film before offering a review.  But after several days, I can't bring myself to spend another minute on this waste of time.

I decided to DVR and watch it...WOW! I still don't know what the movie is about or what some scenes had to do with the movie. Is this guy a superhero, a pimp? He beats up thugs with his belt...um? Louis has a great interview on YouTube where he talks about how the studios CEO yelled at him for the movie he delivered and said it was unreleasable. Louis does admit that the movie is junk after they re-edited his version. Not to knock him, I know movies are a tough business. I'm happy CK has made it big in comedy, he seems like a good dude. He says and I have to agree, his directing career is over though.  NOTE: Years ago when this was released, the actor who played Pootie was on a radio station one morning to promote and he really had nothing to say about the movie, I remember thinking that the guy must be real cocky or high or something. It was odd. He told the disc jockey he didn't really know what the movies plot was.

But that's getting a little theoretical for such a hilarious comedy. The features are non-existent and sometimes this movie seems like a Saturday Night Live sketch that they just didn't spend long enough time with the script to make it classic.

I honestly could not even finish watching this movie in one sitting. I had to see it in small doses. I never found Pootie Tangs character funny or even chuckle worthy on the Chris Rock show, but a 81 minute long movie based on a 50sec sketch is a terrible idea. This movie came out when Chris Rock was at the peak of his popularity so you went in expecting some good laughs, but it just never happens.

Luckily there's no acting here (except for Bob Costas who's perfectly terrible at it). There's no Hollywood formula; in fact, no formula.  If it were a polished movie it would be idiotic and would give away all its honesty.  It's a Chris Rock thing.  Kid-like honesty with a brutal punch.  A morality play about morality and I think it succeeds in giving a silly trashing to the simplistic morality constantly thrown at blacks (and at others) while doing it so innocently it doesn't ever have to admit to any manipulation or blaxploitation.

At the same time it takes on the black music-video culture into looking at itself and maybe frees it from that aspect of appearing impenetrable to external moral demands or judgments.  As Jung said, ""What you resist, persists.""  This kid is regressing to speaking in tongues.  ""Pidgin"" is a simple language which arises between two groups of people who don't speak the same language.  Pootie's pidgin is a start that many of us might agree on.  Whether your reaction is ""sepatown"" or ""sa da tay"", if you don't get a laugh out of it, this movie's for you.",1216166400,3,1214,4.728571428571429

1434728,1,B00005JK8N,"Where can one truly begin when discussing Pootie Tang?  Movies such as this, I believe, are best when viewed as monumental moments of religious inspiration.  You see, this movie could only have been spawned by God; and not just any God either, but a God who is hellbent upon punishing we poor sinners for our past discresions.  When you view Pootie Tang, you are in fact, experiencing the Lord's wrath personally, in your own living room.  When viewed in such a light this movie is awesome and the best expression of the sublime in modern society.

  My best friend and I rented Pootie Tang several years back; we had heard many things about it.  The universal opinion seems to have been that it was so god awfully wretched that we had to view it ourselves; nothing, we thought, could be as bad as everyone was making it out to be.  We were wrong; terribly, terribly wrong.

  This movie is so unfunny that I have been lead to conclude that the author was attempting this feat!

But anyways, the movie revolves around a video clip from Pootie Tang's upcoming movie called Sign Your Pittie on the Runny Kine.  If you pay attention, you'll notice that his hit album was also called Sign Your Pittie on the Runny Kine.  lol

But the story is of Pootie Tang and his belt and i suppose you already know the rest.

Wa da Tah!  I find this movie highly entertaining, thanks to the uncomprehendable Pootie talk, the belt whippings, and the rediculous plot.  So if you're in the mood for a braindead Laugh-Fest, pick up a copy of POOTIE TANG!!!",1153526400,5,828,4.46

Armed with a deadly accurate belt and an odd vocabulary, Pootie speaks like a hip-hop version of Jodie Foster in NELL. Played with deadpan intensity by Lance Crouther, only context and Bob Costas can decipher our hero's dialogue. Pootie makes gibberish fun and highly quotable.

  More than Pootie making his enemies say ""nay-no"" to evil by whuppin' ass with his belt, Louis C.K.'s POOTIE TANG boasts the new millennium's most exciting scenes of a gorilla attack. The film also sports a terrific supporting cast that includes Wanda Sykes as Biggie Shortie (an off the hook hoochie), Robert Vaughn as Dick Lecter (the big name villain), and Chris Rock in a host of roles, including the moralistic to a fault, Daddy Tang.

  Also known as SIGN YOUR PITTY ON THE RUNNING KINE, C.K.'s film is a modern comedy cum blaxploitation classic, reminiscent of genre greats. There's the Caucasian mastermind who's as nutty as Shelly Winters in CLEOPATRA JONES. There's the protagonist's unbelievable sexual prowess similar to that of Melvin Van Peebles in SWEET SWEETBACK'S BAADASSS SONG. And, there's a car wash confrontation that smacks of BLACK BELT JONES.

Pootie Tang will one day be a classic.
Based on the character on HBO's Chris Rock Show.
Pootie is a superstar/crimefighter, who beats down criminals with a magical belt (from Piggly Wiggly) and speaks an un-understandable type of slang.
The story is:
Pootie loses his magical belt to an evil vixen (played by Jennifer Coolidge), who was sent by the business mogul Dick Lecter (played by Robert Vaughn).
Lecter wants the belt so he can control Pootie and get him to endorse his products such as cigarettes, malt liquor, and razor blades to the children.
Pootie, after losing his belt, must retreat to the farm to regain his confidence and strength he will need to defeat the evil Dick Lecter.
The film also has tons of other stars like: comic Chris Rock (as Pootie's friend, his father, and a radio DJ), comic Wanda Sykes (as Biggie Shorty), comic Dave Attell (as Frank), J.B. Smoove (as the annoying Trucky), Laura Kightlinger, J.D. Williams (as Froggie), and Bob Costas (as himself).

He also doesn't speak English, but this hilarious pseudo-ebonics language. Pootie is dedicated to helping the children, who I believe he calls the ""Tippie Tai."" Now, before you make up your mind about this movie, I will give a brief test. Read the following list of characters: Pootie Tang, Dirty Dee, Trucky, Bad Bitty, Biggie Shorty, and Froggy. If you didn't find these names humorous, this movie probably isn't for you. The humor centers around nonsense. Words, names, and events that make so little sense, that they are hilarious. Example: Pootie's father is mauled by a gorilla at a factory. That's funny stuff, but not to everyone. If you're looking for subtle humor, search elsewhere. But if you're looking for a movie with an off-the-wall brand of humor, buy Pootie Tang. I will admit however, that towards the end of the movie all of the nonsense words lost their humor value slightly. That is the only thing that prevented this movie from getting 5 Stars.

I will admit that the narrative voice (and Chris Rock) got on my nerves somewhat.

Since I keep up fairly well with current trends, I suspect it's the movie, not me, that's at fault. This mess is based on a character who has been regularly featured on HBO's The Chris Rock Show. There's always a risk when the subject of a series of TV skits is turned into a full-length feature film because what's funny for a few minutes can grow tiresome if it runs too long. I think Pootie Tang's producers, which include Mr. Rock, must have found this out. Excluding the credits, this bomb runs just one hour and ten minutes. It looks as if either no one bothered to film some key sequences or some of the footage was so bad it got cut. Either way the story line gets lost along the way. And so does the viewer.
Pootie Tang [Lance Crouther] is a young black guy who speaks an indecipherable language. Still, everyone falls all over him because he's so hip and cool. Women are especially effected. Pootie's language problem is the best part of the character. It's a spoof of the way street talk seems to change from week to week. If only the rest of the jokes had been half as funny.
Pootie is a good guy who's fighting a giant corporation that gets kids hooked on cigarettes, alcohol and junk food. The company uses their best weapon, the sexy Ireenie [Jennifer Coolidge] to trick Pootie into signing a contract forcing him to endorse its products. The rest of the plot? Well, there isn't any.
I am not saying that the people involved are without talent. Crouther is a likable performer and has shown in the past that he can be quite funny. Ditto Chris Rock, whose production company was behind this movie. Maybe Rock, like many before him, is discovering that success in front of the camera does not insure success behind it. Or maybe he hasn't found the right vehicle. Pootie Tang has parts of it that work, but they do not add up to a whole movie. In most cases, trying to expand a skit too much has about as much chance of succeeding as taking a pop song and making it ninety minutes long. It doesn't work because there is not enough to the central idea to justify expanding it.",1015804800,3,2174,4.37037037037037

Through the entire movie I kept saying, ""Why did you waste you money on garbage.""",1013472000,,366,4.084507042253521
1434910,5,B00005JK8N,"and funnier than anything else out there.  The great thing about &#8220;Pootie Tang&#8221; is the fact that it is joyfully stupid yet always laughing at itself.  It is a smart dumb movie.  The movie is about a Mr. T like super hero who is always on the side of the kids, telling them to eat their vegetables and not drink malt liquor.  I told you this was stupid!  With the help of his best friends (including one played by Chris Rock), the hot to trot Biggie Shortie and his daddy's magic belt, Pootie is unstoppable when it comes to seducing women and recording hit songs.  But it all goes down hill for Pootie once an evil corporation tries to ruin him once they see that he is cutting into the profits.  Yeah, kind of a clich story (at one point Pootie Tang even goes to a farm to lead a simple life and figure everything out) but with unforgettable.  Not only is Pootie Tang outrageous, but they are a bunch of wild characters including mega ho Ireenie  , drug dealer and Pig Pen wannabe Dirty Dee and the would be Miss Tang Biggie Shortie.  Also, nice cameos by B-grade stars like Laura Kightlinger and Andy Richter.
Its definitely weak when it comes to a story, but its pretty strong really driven by the actors and their outrageous lines and actions.  You will laugh so hard at the cleverness in the absurdity of the movie.  The movie doesn't exploit the actors like many films blaxploitation did (hence the title, I assume).  Everyone is in on the joke.
While a laugh out loud movie, its all around weak for a DVD.  The only real extra is a music video by 702.  For those saying &#8220;7 0 Who?&#8221;, they had a big R&B hit a few years ago with a song called &#8220;Where My Girls At&#8221;.  This DVD might be one of the best in my collection if it had a good audio commentary by Rock and others, talking about how their feelings on the film, bad or otherwise.  Without real DVD extras, Pottie Tang is still good stuff.  In the respect that it goes after a small audience and has them loving the movit, it is cult picture in the same respect of something like &#8220;Rocky Horror&#8221;.

Looking like a younger, scrawnier Billy Dee Williams, Lance Crouther excells as Pootie Tang, an urban, crime-fighting dude who does PSAs telling kids not to eat fast food or drink malt liquor.  Chris Rock also co-stars as a neighborhood pal of Pootie, and the other characters in this film are funny stereotypes cut from central casting.
The film editing and camera work combines the zaniness of Laugh-In with 70s cop shows, and the soundtrack is fantastic.  This movie has no redeeming social value and will never win any awards.  However, I laughed out loud and giggled many times at its childlike silliness and fun atmosphere.  It's a funny, funny flick for teenagers and adults.",1010966400,8,892,4.803921568627451

1434914,4,B00005JK8N,"This movie came and went in theaters so fast I didn't get a chance to see it, but I rented it because Pootie Tang was always funny on the Chris Rock show, and I consider Chris Rock one of the funniest men in America. Pootie Tang is a rapper who speaks some sort of very extreme rap lingo, to the point where you cannot understand a word he says. Meanwhile, everyone else always understands him (kind of like Chewbacca, somehow the other characters can interpret what he says perfectly) though once in a while they'll say, ""What the hell you talkin about?""
The plot isn't complex, Pootie fights bad guys (like drug dealers) with his magic belt, sings songs that somehow people can understand, and the ladies love him. Chris Rock plays his father, one of his friends, a DJ, and probably some other character I'm forgetting. Meanwhile The Man wants to brainwash Pootie into endorsing their horrible product, and (surprise surprise) he loses his magic belt, and goes on a mission to get it back. Wanda Sykes is great as...uh...I forget her name, but she narrates the story and helps Pootie, plus she wears a different cool-... wig in every scene. I wasn't rolling on the floor laughing, but the movie was funny and entertaining It starts out with Bob Costas interviewing him and saying he's gonna show a clip from his movie, 80 minutes go by, maybe even less (the end credits seemed to go on for 10 minutes) . The opening, with him fighting Dolemite-type bad guys, is hilarious. I also was impressed that the movie didn't rely on gross-out humor and wasn't violent-I don't think anyone got killed- and has a positive message that makes it a good family movie. I think it was ""Do right, fight what's wrong, but the important thing is to love the world while you're doing it ."" And what's wrong with that?",1009238400,11,1799,4.590062111801243

Pootie Tang is one of those movies. (...) I can't get through a day without watching it at least once, now.
I can't explain the ingenuity coursing all throughout this film. ""Pootie Tang grew up in a small town outside of Gary, Illinois. That town was... CHICAGO!"" Little things like that, and big things like Pootie's pseudo-sentence-fragments. The soundtrack fits so perfectly with the movie. I think they should've used that Dirty Dee song more. Pootie's song, which was just silence, and the father busting in to tell his son to ""turn that noise down NOW!"" The western-style sequence where they basically use stop-motion to place Pootie and Dirty Dee closer and closer to one another until they're touching and then they've suddenly passed through one another. The belt Pootie's father bought at Piggly-Wiggly for 59 cents. Daddy Tang being the third person mauled by a gorilla at the steel mill. ""It's tough out there, Pootie. You got drugs... crime... gorillas..."" No attempt to make the monkey look real.
Bob Costas, Robert Vaughn, and the hilarious Dave Attel all lend their hands to the hilarity. I can't even list everything that's great about it because I'd have to put the entire script down. See it,(...)",1007510400,8,1456,4.875

I went into this movie thinking it was going to be one of those ""so bad it's good"" movies.  So you can imagine my surprise when I started laughing and couldn't stop until the final scene of the movie.  It's nonsense.  It's a joyful, daffy comedy.  I mean, can you resist a movie with lines like, ""Nobody could ever understand what Pootie was saying, but man, he sure was cool""?  The characters and situations are over the top, but the actors are 100% committed to line after ridiculous line that it SOARS.  It's one of those comedies that makes you think, ""Why don't they make em like this anymore?""
The REAL star of this show, however, is Wanda Sykes who plays Pootie's gal Biggie Shorty, who ""dresses up all nice and dances on the street next to a buncha ho's"" (but that doesn't mean she's hookin').  She walks away with the whole picture.  Chris Rock gives her some tough competition as a radio DJ and as Pootie's father, as does Jennifer Coolidge who plays the super-ho Ireenie, but in the end, Biggie Shorty is the star.

Very few people saw this film, fewer still stayed 'til the end, fewer still loved it and fewer still loved it for the right reasons. This movie is NOT a parody of Blaxsploitation films, it just uses those films as a starting point. This  movie is not ""so stupid it's funny"" but rather ""so ingenius it's funny."" Critics and viewers alike have had a difficult time wrapping their minds around this movie because it is unlike anything ever seen before. The film's ultra-positive energy is a new kind of  breakthough ""edgy"" that I believe is ten years ahead of its time. The character of Pootie is inscrutible and brilliant, yet tender and moving. Never have I seen a movie with more perfect casting (including documentaries!). So many mistakes could have ruined this film: the editing, the acting, the writing, but there was not a single misstep (despite the claims of creator Louis C.K.).
