8701404,1,B00TEUG0UG,"Don't work no matter what region-free player I use. I managed to open it in computer with DVDFab but
it showed me bunch of files like 20 and some of them did work for 20 min.
If you use PowerDVD it does open and play movie properly and, in addition, using DVDFab I converted movie to playable AVI file.
The problem with region-free player looks like they are not really region-free and  need manual tweeking all the time.",1486857600,,421,4.397435897435898
