2539501,5,B000EULSRA,"The new release date for this DVD is 26th September 2006. An annoying delay to be sure. However I'm not sure that giving the DVD itself a rating of 1 star is fair (see previous posting). It's hardly the DVD's fault that the supplier has delayed release. I already have the 'Best of The Chris Rock Show vols. 1 and 2', and can't wait for the complete first and second season to come out. It'll be worth the wait.

8114704,5,B000EULSRA,"I remember watching this show as a kid n thought it completely brilliant. Watching it again,  it's even more so. I see now why it failed.... it was too honest n forward thinking n the haters couldn't handle it.",1479686400,,210,4.384615384615385
8114705,5,B000EULSRA,Being a big fan of Chris Rock. I am completely satisfied with this DVD.  In the past I had caught some of the shows on HBO.  This  DVD  makes a great addition to my DVD Library. Truly a collector's  item.,1407024000,,204,4.0
8114706,4,B000EULSRA,"It's great, because Chris Rock has the kind of face that makes you want to laugh, so if he is breathing, I'm laughing at him!  But it's not as piss-your-pants funny as the HBO Specials!  Come on, Chris, let's have another of those!!",1400284800,,232,4.372093023255814
8114707,5,B000EULSRA,I love this show. It was funny and a really good deal price wise. I would recommend it to any fan of his.,1362268800,,105,3.608695652173913
8114708,1,B000EULSRA,"Despite what another reviewer says, yes this set IS edited.  I guess they never say ""The COMPLETE Seasons 1 & 2"" for a reason.  I couldn't find anything specific about this set online beforehand, so I finally took the plunge... and am very disappointed.  For those wondering, yes the very first episode of the series - with Johnnie Cochran and Prince - has had Prince's performance, and any mention of Prince, completely removed from the episode.  On the disc, the episode runs just over 20 minutes long as opposed to the close to 30 minutes of the other episodes.  I love Chris, I love this show, but I feel that I've been had by HBO thanks to the very careful wording on the packaging and the lack of any detailed information about this set elsewhere.  At this point, I haven't yet gone through the rest of the set to see what may be missing, but having such a huge chunk cut out of the first episode isn't a great way to start.",1203206400,25,930,4.377906976744186
8114709,4,B000EULSRA,"Why are people asking questions about the DVD like this is a messageboard, and tearing down the rating with 1 and 2 stars because they can't get an answer? Rate/review the DVD.

I bought the Best of Season 2 DVD by mistake about a year ago.

This is the complete two seasons on three DVDs, musical guests and all. If you were a fan of the show it's perfect.",1182211200,2,357,4.159420289855072

8114711,3,B000EULSRA,"not a bad dvd but it still has not covered all the shows, i know of 1 that is missing, the one when he has marion barry on, which i must add is why i bought it, but still has some good guests and interludes, good for fans.",1175299200,6,222,3.6458333333333335
8114712,3,B000EULSRA,"this is relatively tame, by comparison.  Though not politically correct, Chris Rock is best when satarizing various racial stereotypes of both blacks and whites.  Unfortunately, he doesn't do much of that on this DVD.",1166400000,,217,5.352941176470588
