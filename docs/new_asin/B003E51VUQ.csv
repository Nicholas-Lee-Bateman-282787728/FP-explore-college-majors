4113128,5,B003E51VUQ,"I see that some people are looking at this and wondering if it's a subbed or dubbed boxset. I'm pretty confident in it being a Dubbed series. It is a pre-order and if you go to this link: [...] you will see that the boxset is dubbed.

  On to my Review of the anime. I LOVED Clannad. I've LOVED pretty much all of Kyoto Animation's Animes. But for me Clannad holds a very deep place in my heart.

  Clannad has very rich background music. It always sets the right mood for whats being displayed on the tv screen. Many moments will make you laugh. And just as many moments will make you cry. You'll Fall in love with the Girls.

  Clannad also has a good re-watch Value. Though you may not learn anything new, I find myself re-watching the series many times a year.

  The Dubbed version of the show is not hard to get used to. Though if you are fans of the Japanese version some voice acting and name pronunciation will bother you. Specifically the Voice acting of Youhei Sunohara and Kyou Fujibiyashi. To me their voice actors don't seem to fit their personalities.

  So my recommendation is to buy this box-set. It will have both the subbed and dubbed versions of the show so it's a win/win situation for any fan.",1274745600,6,1216,4.366071428571429
4113129,4,B003E51VUQ,"I was wondering, it says complete collection 4 pc.  Does this mean this collection has both the Clannad 1, 2 and Afterlife 1 and 2?  Is the movie included in this set?  It says run time on amazon's description to be 600 minutes, seems kinda short to be a ""complete collection"".",1273017600,,277,4.392156862745098
4113130,4,B003E51VUQ,"This is a spectacular looking Anime. No doubt about that. But, Amazon, is screwing up again. Too many people get angry and leave 1 star only because of mistakes made by Amazon. For example, the title has (Dub Sub) in it. I scroll down and notice the spoken language is Japanese only. Which is it?!!! I read too many reviews where people get there DVD's and low n behold there's no Eng Dub. Please update your description please!!! Other than that Clannad is great. It didn't touch my heart like Kanon did. Kanon can still develope a lump in my throat. Clannad didn't do that for me at all. But what do you expect with Yutaka Yamamoto no longer being with Kyoto Animation anymore to bring us those wonderful anime. Yutaka not being there is also the reason why season 2 of Haruhi sucks as well, which he apoligized for. Don't worry though, Yutaka went out and created his own studio called Ordet with a number of great anime on it's way. Kannagi, from Ordet, was great!!! He was, in my opinion, the backbone of Kyoto's ability to touch ones heart and make you feel something. He's also the genius behind the dance choreography in Haruhi, Lucky Star, and Kannagi. So Clannad has beautiful scenes, but lacks true emotion. So I gave it 4 stars.",1272499200,2,1240,4.515555555555555
4113131,5,B003E51VUQ,"There were some complaints about the initial Clanand sets because they were subtitled only.  Some anime fans refuse to admit that the market is now in a much different place than it was a few years ago.  However, despite that, the series went on to sell extremely well for an anime release, subbed or dubbed.  Now Sentai Filmworks has gone back and created a dub with Seraphim Digital Studios (formerly ADV Studios/Amusement Park Media).

The dub is currently airing on the Anime Network, and I have to say that it's great so far, and only getting better.  It did take some getting use to different voices coming out of the characters, but you quickly get over it.  There was a slight pronunciation snafu with Nagisa, but I'm willing to forgive that considering it's been quite a while since ADV/Sentai have dubbed a show.

It's great to see Clannad getting a dub, and even greater to see ADV/Sentai dubbing their own shows again!  I can't wait to see what the future brings!",1272067200,15,975,4.6608187134502925

Okazaki Tomoya is a delinquent who finds life dull and believes he'll never amount to anything. Along with his friend Sunohara, he skips school and plans to waste his high school days away.

One day while walking to school, Tomoya passes a young girl muttering quietly to herself. Without warning she exclaims ""Anpan!"" (a popular Japanese food) which catches Tomoya's attention. He soon discovers the girl's name is Furukawa Nagisa and that she exclaims things she likes in order to motivate herself. Nagisa claims they are now friends, but Tomoya walks away passing the encounter off as nothing.

However, Tomoya finds he is noticing Nagisa more and more around school. Eventually he concedes and befriends her. Tomoya learns Nagisa has been held back a year due to a severe illness and that her dream is to revive the school's drama club. Claiming he has nothing better to do, he decides to help her achieve this goal along with the help of four other girls.

As Tomoya spends more time with the girls, he learns more about them and their problems. As he attempts to help each girl overcome her respective obstacle, he begins to realise life isn't as dull as he once thought.",1472515200,2,1332,4.828947368421052

It's also very good artwork and story. It finish the story of all the people. It little sad. The ending could be little bite better. It was bite unclear for me.

It's a great stand-alone anime, but the second season is better and heart-wrenching. If you enjoy a good slice of life anime with fun characters and silly moments, you will like Clannad. There is a reason it is considered one of the best in it's genres. If you have already seen it and loved it, this is an excellent collection to buy.

However Clannad is the huge exception. This is the first season of two, clannad will make you smile, cry and get emotional all in just a few episodes. The story is very touching, the animation wonderful, especially on blu ray, the sound is powerful and overall there isn't a single negative thing I can say about this series.

4113259,5,B003E51VUQ,"It has been 3 years since I first purchased this series. Both Clannad and Clannad After story - you MUST have both. I have never found anything that has moved me so much as these two series. I never knew anime could be so powerful. I always thought that all anime catered to the 'fan service' or violent blood and gore style presentations. I am so happy I came upon this series. It is so intricate, so well spun as a tale, I see something new every time I watch it. I was so tempted at first to fast forward thorough scenes that I thought had no contribution to the story line (scenes at the beginning of the episode that dealt with the 'alternate universe') but everything has meaning. There is NO wasted story line. Everything is tied together so intricately, it amazes me every time I watch it. It is an AMAZING story of family - even though it does not spell it out, you feel everything. I have not found any work that can compare to this series to move me emotionally as this work does. The character development is incredible, you find yourself laughing at one moment only to weep your heart out the next. It is so real, so powerful that you feel the plight of the characters.
There are alternate endings presented, but each has a feel that is real. The ultimate ending (why you need both series) is so wonderful, I laugh, cry, and cheer all at the same time. Key studios has done a wonderful job with this series and that is why it is still such a popular video after 10 years from when it was introduced.
This is an emotional roller coaster from the moment you start watching the series, I can't hear the first 3 measures of the introduction theme now without shedding a tear. I have no idea why this series is so amazing but it has impacted how I see the world. Even if you are not an anime fan you must watch this series. The message of family (not just immediate family but everyone in life that is made family through choices or circumstance) is overwhelming. In the end, with family - nothing is impossible.",1432857600,2,2020,4.3465608465608465

4113261,5,B003E51VUQ,The feelings that I have felt while watching this show were so major. This show is my favorite show and it would not disappoint you.

4113262,5,B003E51VUQ,"My favorite ""harem"" type anime ever, with Air being a close second. Clannad is full of poignant story arcs sure to make you laugh and cry. Music is wonderfully catchy.

I love the way events in After Story (the second part to this) are foreshadowed in the opening title sequence for these episodes, leading to that big ""ah ha!"" moment first-time viewers are sure to experience during at least two After Story moments.

So many things to spoil. Do yourself a favor. Stop reading anything about this series and just watch it.",1429488000,,523,4.673913043478261

4113319,5,B003E51VUQ,"Clannad nicely tells a compelling story. The series belongs to the slice-of-life genre-similar to but much lighter than television soap operas. The writer of Clannad tells the story from a classical point of view with characters experiencing results dependent on their behaviors. The episodes contain a lot of development for the primary personas plus some movement for most of the supporting roles.

The story addresses the problems of moral arithmetic all of us face in our daily lives-whether we choose to live only for self or break free to support the interests of others. In the tale, self-described slacker Okazaki Tomoya becomes involved in the lives of a half-dozen high school girls, some with greater problems than others. Making his own desires secondary-he says he has nothing better to do anyway-he helps the girls overcome loneliness, hurt, anger, timidity, jealousy and selfishness. Okazaki-kun even positively influences his slap-stick sidekick Sunohara Yoohei. How each character changes revolves around a Japanese understanding of the world-firm lines not required.

Clannad uses nicely placed flashbacks, flashforwards and soliloquies-all legitimate ingredients of storytelling-to keep things moving.

If you are interested in slice-of-life anime, you may enjoy this series.",1410739200,,1294,5.694300518134715
4113320,5,B003E51VUQ,I'm not going to say much.  But this series it a must see if you are a fan if emotional anime.

Through the story goes on he becomes to open up more . And makes new firends.  Tomoiya start to realize making new and great firends it's not only good but it's also bad.

Tragedy romance and has its share of comedy moments. Again I did not want to say to much if I did I might spoil the series. As the story goes you learn the life of every character . Made me even more attached to the characters.

Unfortunately this season doesn't even come close to the drama and tragedy in season 2 (After Story) and because season 2 is 10X better than the first season I had no choice but to give this 4 stars. This is still a great season and I love how they included the Tomoyo arc as the last episode (She's my favorite heroine) and that made this season even better.

I highly recommend this series to all anime fans and some of you may cry to this first season (I did not) and if you do cry to the first season than I can tell you, you'll be bawling all throughout the second season.

Anyways, this anime was animated by KyoAni(Haruhi, Kanon, Lucky Star, and Chunibyo) and boy, did they do a good job. As far as I've noticed, there have been no ""super duper high quality"" issues with the animation. I'm not going to sit here and just regurgitate the plot to you in order to give you some sort of lackluster synopsis. You need this anime in your life. It isn't recommended for people who like instant gratification, it's a slow burner. You'll laugh. You'll cry.

4113371,5,B003E51VUQ,"It is not easy to review Clannad without singing it's praises up past the ceiling.
Story wise it comes across as a simple High School story, with comedic and dramatic elements interwoven in a very skilled fashion.
The series roots as a Visual Novel are apparent through the 24 episode runtime, which is presented as a straight run for 23 of the episodes, and an alternate ending in the last, but is also clearly divided into 3 major arcs: The Fuuko arc, the Katomi Arc, and the Drama Club (or the Nagisa arc).

The story flows at a smooth pace, introducing most, if not all the relevant characters, while still leaving bits to be revealed in later episodes.  While segments can get a bit fanciful at times, at no point does it venture into territory that feels unreal, and the characters are all charming and interesting enough that they all earn a place in your heart by the final episode.

The emotional connection to the characters is one of the strongest selling points of the series.  As noted in other review, be prepared to cry, a lot.  In no other series have I found myself laughing until I cried in one episode, and crying in the next because the material is so devastatingly sad, but relatable.  But while the tear spawning content is never in short supply, the comedy and heartwarming parts shine even brighter.  Characters form the overblown and insane antics of Sunohara, to the seemingly overly dramatic Yuuske, pepper the supporting cast and make them easy to love, and do not at all detract from the central relation between Okizaki and Nagisa.  One of the highlights is the fact that almost every time Nagisa's mother and father appear on screen, you are almost guaranteed to laugh or cry.
Another highlight is the soundtrack.  Again harkening back to it's roots, the soundtrack, from the background in scenes, to each characters unique theme, is lifted almost exactly from the original work.  I had not realized that I had picked up the background music from the series until I read through the VN, and hearing the music brought back memories and in some instances (Nagisa's Big Dango Family, for one,) brought me back to tears.  Touching, uplifting, and haunting in all the right places, the score is top notch.

Overall, I cannot recommend this series highly enough.  The themes inside, of friendship, teenage anxiety, family, the desire to be loved, and more make this a series that I feel can be enjoyed by all age groups.
In short, if you are a fan of not raunchy high school comedies, cute romance tales, entertaining yarns, or just stories that leave a lasting impact long after they are over, Clannad is a necessary watch.

On the topic of Voice Over, while I have not viewed it in Japanese, I can say that the English Dub is superb, the voices feel right in each character, from the airy shyness in Nagisa, to the barely contained anger of Kyou, to the pure over the top energy of Sunohara.",1390262400,,2918,4.662768031189084

4113376,5,B003E51VUQ,"Clannad is a great anime with memorable characters and a storyline with a deep and wonderful meaning. It really does deserve all the 5 stars reviews it has right now.

However, looking at some of the negative reviews, I would like to clear somethings up for anyone who read those negative reviews and got discouraged by them.

The Clannad anime is based off Key's visual novel of the same name. Having played the visual novel, I can tell you from experience that it is a 300+ hour game, giving each character roughly 30 or more hours of screen time. I read in several of the negative reviews that some people thought that some character arcs were drawn out of too long (primary issue I've seen is Fuuko aka the starfish girl) or in some cases, the endings for some arcs were underwhelming.

I do agree that the anime did a poor job compared to the visual novel, but in order to save time, the producers attempted to condense all those 30 plus hours each character got in the game into 24 episodes that are 30 minutes long, reducing some character arcs to a mere 30 minutes while giving others 4-5 episodes. In doing this, the character build up and emotional attachment you got for them wasn't very strong so the endings did seem underwhelming.

Focusing on another negative review, someone mention that they disliked how the characters seemed stereotyped. However, what movie/anime/book/ pretty much anything in general has stereotypes of some kind? No matter how unique we try to make things, stereotypes of some sort can be applied to it.

As for the reviews that spoke negatively on the plot, the product advertised here is Clannad(the first season), which is solely designed for the development of characters and to set the story of Clannad: Afterstory (the second season). It is here in the second season where the plot truly thickens and where most people truly understand the meaning behind this anime. I will not argue that the first season will get boring at times but push on and you will be rewarded at the end.(well not exactly rewarded since Afterstory completely screwed over my emotions, can exactly call that a reward.

Well now I'm done covering the the negative reviews that bothered me...

Anyways, all in all, Clannad is a great anime but it is not without it's flaws. However, if you can overlook these flaws, Clannad is an anime with a rich and beautiful meaning to it that you can't find anywhere else.

Thanks for taking the time to read,

4113420,5,B003E51VUQ,"I'll try not to be too long with this review.  I know a lot of people don't enjoy reading enormous ""book"" reviews, so I'll be brief.  Before Clannad, I hadn't watched any anime beyond the clich ones of my youth such as Dragon Ball Z, Pokmon, etc.  However, after reading the visual novel, I decided to watch the anime for myself, as I had grown attached to the characters and wanted to see them in their animated glory.

Story:
The story is amazing.  Let me get that out of the way first.  It was successfully able to break my heart on multiple occasions, successfully melding your heart with that of the characters, until you feel what they feel, hurt when they hurt.  It's not always sad, though, with a great, varying humor that will appeal to many different personalities.  It also incorporates the arcs of the visual novel well without being ambiguous with its plotline.  Although there is a primary love interest, it does its best to keep the stories of the other women intact, and it works brilliantly.

Animation/Sound:
Another thing that Clannad's animators managed to do so well is translate the visual novel's static artwork into a beautiful flowing animation.  The backgrounds are gorgeous, and the characters look great and are well-animated.  I've only watched the dubbed version of it, so I can't comment on the quality of the subbed voice actors, but, with a few minor exceptions, the dubbed voice acting is superb and matches well with the lips of the characters.  The soundtrack is quite stunning as well, relying mostly on the soundtrack from the VN, with beautiful, heartbreaking tracks amongst lighter-hearted instrumentals that really help to set the mood for the scenes they're in.

Overall:
Clannad is truly a masterpiece and is now by far my favorite show I've ever seen (I'd even go far as to say my favorite non-interactive media, ever).  From lovable characters to a sad yet compelling plotline, with great animation and voice acting to boot, Clannad is amazing in almost every regard and is definitely worth a purchase to anyone with even a passing interest in the genre it represents.

NOTE:  I would like to point out that the case for Clannad is a bit cheaply made.  The plastic feels like it may fall apart in your hands, and, unlike other DVD cases, all DVDs are one spindle, which makes me a bit nervous to the long-term safety to the discs.

4113433,2,B003E51VUQ,"WARNING: SOME SPOILERS!

Does anyone remember the movie Usual Suspects? When it first came out, people were so shocked at the ending that it gathered some praise and eventually a cult following. But if you were to go back and watch it again, knowing exactly what was going to happen, you might have found it boring, badly directed -- in fact for most of the movie it was unarguably below average. But the movie succeeded on some level because it was the last 10 minutes that people remembered. I feel same way about Clannad.

I hate improperly placed exposition. In the movie Empire, I don't think many film fans would argue with me here that the rant at the end was a cheap way to drum emotion and sympathy. Proper storytelling should show us the thoughts and motivations of its characters through their action; as far as I am concerned, exposition should be the last resort. Yet in anime, it is commonplace for characters to go into episode-long speeches and flashbacks about what drives them (the same tactic you'd generally only find in soap operas). Fans of said pieces will say that I don't understand the meaning behind Clannad, that it's about family, love, and unexpected tragedy. I say they don't understand proper storytelling, and just because every character has some sob story that singularly drives all their actions doesn't mean the story is ""deep"" -- quite the contrary (after all, who in the real world is singularly driven by a Freudian prescription?). But the fans are especially zealous when it comes to this ""sad = deep"" mantra, and we see this across works that apply a similar mode of storytelling: like in Metal Gear Solid 4, where every boss that never shows up again goes into a 20 minute exposition before they die; Naruto, where every character is driven by some bad childhood or bullying, and somehow only the main character is privy to solve those problems; the Fate universe (e.g. Fate/Zero); Bleach, where every minor Arrancar has their sob backstory to justify why they must become stronger; and so forth... And Clannad will be neither first nor last in this regard. Every character arc will develop that character only on account of some sappy backstory, as if this is what defines them wholly, and it is up to our hero, Tomoya, to solve all their problems. And whereas in Bakemonogatari, this is somewhat justified because the main character was a vampire, and in Haruhi because Haruhi is God, Tomoya is presented as a typical disinterested high school student in Clannad, which ironically adds to the unbelievability.

What's the first thing that comes to mind when dealing with a title like Clannad? Pretentious. In some obscure Irish reference, Clannad means ""family""; what why did Key choose this name when there are no Irish characters or anything that can be construed to be Irish in the series? Rather, the name is somewhat of a subliminal hint of what's to come. And so is the first few minutes of the first episode. Whenever I see some metaphorical exposition about an alternate world presented as some children's book in vain of Chobits, first I think, who writes these?! Then I roll my eyes. This thing about the girl and a robot isn't deep because it isn't so original. It's been done in countless other anime.

I'll break the rest of this review down into aspects of the anime, so as to provide some sort of structure for easier reading:

Art -- 3.5/5 (Average). A lot of other people praise the art of Clannad, but I found it to be rather bland, typical of moe anime. There is no more keyframes, detail, and the character design isn't any more unique than any other anime, like ToraDora! or Sket Dance. Haruhi had fleeting moments of CGI that flowed well, and Ano Hana is heads above more detailed than Clannad. I'm not sure what Clannad fans are comparing it to, probably other projects by Kyoto Animation... How generic are big breasted chicks with purple hair?

Characters -- 2/5 (Bad). Clannad characters are built from the moe archetypes that any anime fan could identify: the comedic relief character whose only role is getting beat up like Team Rocket from Pokemon (Sunohara); the shy, stuttering girl that's incapable of communicating a single coherent idea (Ryou); the tsundere girl that starts out with a bad attitude and is somehow good at all sports (Kyou);  the mature and cute imouto/sister (Mei); the motherly class rep that want to take care of the main character (Tomoyo); and the silent genius girl that's content with reading books (Kotomi). These are all characters that you would find in any harem romance, especially visual novels games where the player chooses which one he would like to ""date"". And aside from the aforementioned sob stories, these characters remain shells, standing on the sidelines, waiting for the right moment to add to the emotional capacity of the show.

The only two characters that matter are Nagisa -- an insecure, low self-esteem, physically weak girl that develops a dependency on the main character (probably every otaku nerd's wet dream); and Tomoya -- presented as a delinquent that often skips school, has gotten into 1 fight that we know of, yet has the capacity to pick a fight with the entire baseball team, that has nothing better to do but to help a bunch of girls out that he does not know, even though he secretly laments his role. He often pranks the other characters, which lead to amusing situations that sometimes cause huge misunderstandings between the other characters -- which is to say our hero Tomoya manufactured most of the drama in this series. (This is the kid that would get bullied and beat up in real life, yet in Clannad-verse, he is the object of all the girls at his school.)

Plot (Intro):
Every season or two, an anime show would come along with a literal formula for success. It would have a reluctant main character with no particular interests getting pulled into the lives of all the side characters, most of them girls (harem sells). While this might sound okay according to anime logic, reality tells us that he is a loser with no passions of his own, and no backbone to stand up for what he really wants to do. In anime, and perhaps the minds of naive men, he is the archetypical ""nice guy"" that ends up helping every, yet this a virgin fantasy. Such a character when encountered in real life are often most manipulative, and in fact this manipulation doesn't escape animation despite the writer's most earnest efforts.

Plot: Fuko Arc -- 2/5 (Annoying). A strange girl with an unlimited supply of carved wooden starfishes must give them out to as many people as she could in order to invite them to her sister's wedding before it's too late. Tomoya, with nothing better to do, decides to help, at first only for his amusement, but he is shoehorned into the role of a ""nice guy"" (by the amateurish scriptwriter, no doubt) and mysteriously accepts his role after an unexplained change of heart. All the girls in the school want to help him out, because... who knows? Maybe high school girls want a bad boy delinquent who happens to be a nice guy fantasy; maybe that's what's ""in"" these days... Problem solved, everyone cries -- cue sad, emotion version of the Dango ending song -- mysterious lights float, 5 minute montage, they cry some more, Tomoya gives, presumably, what should have been an inspiring pep-talk according to the formula, about how it's a happy ending after all. Then the scriptwriter comes out and says, ""See what we did there? Cry now."" Well, no he didn't, but he might as well have...

Plot: Kotomi Arc -- 0/5 (Contrived). A silent girl's tragic past is revealed as our hero decides to become her part-time gardener and solve her daddy issues. The other characters help out because... no idea. They weren't really friends or anything at this point. Girl *SPOILER* (but not really) forgives papa because it was revealed that he loved her after all (no... really?), girl stops blaming herself. A 10 minute montage is shown of people across the world passing around a briefcase, by foot and camels, saying in their respective languages, ""Please pass this to my daughter."" With no stones unturned, we have a French herder, Arabian camel-rider and pyramids, Eskimo and igloo, Chinese people, etc. All in bad Japanese accents. No one thought of using post, apparently. And it was supposed to signify how much Kotomi's parents loved her, but it was so incredibly contrived and cheesy that it lost any effectiveness. *END SPOILER* To begin with, this story might have been believable if Kotomi was 8 years old, but she's supposed to be a genius high school student. The character motivations are all so fake that the show becomes frustrating to an audience with any kind of semblance of intelligence (my opinion, of course). Of course, once again, Kotomi cries. Characters cry because of how ""sad"" it is. Cue sad version of Dango ending theme, cheesy montage, and scriptwriter steps out again and breaks the 4th wall, saying, ""Look again. See what we did? When I snap, you cry."" Okay, he still didn't do that, but the brilliance of Clannad is the 4th wall was somehow obliterated without any of the characters on-screen acknowledging it (due to bad, contrived, script). It's just cheap, contrived, manipulative, forced, melodrama...

Plot: Nagisa Arc -- 3/5 (Mediocrity). Tomoya helps Nagisa form a theater club, and Nagisa struggles in figuring out what she wants to write about. Nagisa figures it out (remember the pretentious alternate reality shown in the beginning, and some episodes later?). Tomoya does not notice the obvious advances that some of the other girls are making at him, because he is gay -- or at least he freaks out whenever he accidentally touches a girl. Manufactured drama about how 6-7 somewhat attractive high school/middle school girls is head over heels with this clueless guy -- no other guy in the school shall suffice -- and it's so sad (cue music) that Tomoya doesn't make up his mind. Girls cry. After 22 episodes, Tomoya makes his obvious decision (you knew who it was from episode 1, no surprises). They date but as typical high school students, they are embarrassed about holding hands, and being the passive, clueless guy Tomoya is, he doesn't make advances until prompted by other characters. Cue music. Scriptwriter steps out. The end.

Plot: Tomoyo Arc -- 4/5 (Surprisingly entertaining). But unfortunately, it's only 1 episode. This is an alternate reality about what would have happened if Tomoya chose Tomoyo instead. And Tomoyo's motivation in this is surprisingly more real than Nagisa. She's a class rep torn between her love for Tomoya and her future. This episode is proof that they could've condensed the entire 24 episode season into maybe 11 episodes, or less, and it would have been vastly superior.

Plot Preview (from After Story): Sunohara Arc -- 0/5 (Contrived). *SPOILER* Tomoya trolls his best friend Sunohara by arranging a date for him with Nagisa's mom without his knowledge, all the while convincing Sunohara that she may eventually fall in love with him. Sunohara gets jaded; his sister, Mei, is upset, runs out, Tomoya follows and they scheme to pretend to be in love so that when Sunohara sees this, he will get angry and prove that he cares about Mei. Sunohara sees them, and then resigns to the idea of his pedophile best friend dating his sister, instead leaves. Mei thinks Sunohara doesn't care about her anymore, and came to the miraculous conclusion that all this happened because Sunohara quit baseball (?!). Tomoya then convinces his gang of women that they must take it within themselves to convince the baseball team to let Sunohara back on the team. Not only to they refuse, they talk a lot of trash about Sunohara. How could they?! Cue sad Dango music, Mei cries, Tomoya's eyes darken, he squeezes his fist. It's just too much! Then, just when he was about to lose it, Sunohara jumps out and the two of them fight what must have been about 6 athletic baseball members (and although they were both injured, it insinuates that they didn't lose that fight). *END SPOILER*

Note: The previous paragraph is indicative of the type of storytelling in Clannad. If you read it and said WTF? Then we're on the same page. If you read it and thought, ""How sad!"" Then I encourage you to buy this anime right now, and its sequel, the After Story, and everything else ever produced by Key and Kyoto Animation.

And don't get me wrong, I've sat through shows like ef - Tales of Melodies with no bad feelings about it, and I must say that if you are looking for some melodrama, that would be less grating. Rather, it's the lack of realism and consistency that makes it hard to suspend disbelief. Realism is quite a hard subject to tackle, because first and foremost it is relative. Watching Goku with the power to destroy entire planets somehow makes sense within the world of DBZ, yet if transplanted to, say, Gundam, would be totally unrealistic (taken by themselves though, they are both more realistic than Clannad). When I say Clannad is unrealistic, I don't mean absolute realism, but realism within the context of the story; there is an inconsistency with the idea that Clannad is based around an average high school populated with high school students -- but none of the characters act like real high school students, think like or have motivations of real people. The situations are sometimes so contrived that I sometimes found myself yelling in my head at the screen, ""What the hell? Why did you just do that?"" It was as if Key needed certain conditions to script the next ""sad"" scene, but when the actions of the main characters are so jarring, it kicks the audience out of immersion from the show. Instead of watching the characters, I feel more like watching a script-writer direct the characters, and that completely destroys whatever sad moment this show might have had. I almost wouldn't have been surprised if the writers had held a meeting and said, ""Alright guys. We need a sob back story for each character to make them seem conflicted. Everyone pick a name out of the hat, and tomorrow afternoon we discuss how to get from point A to B.""

As far as I'm concerned, if you skip all the side character arcs, and just watch the Nagisa stuff, Ep. 1 to about 3, Ep. 15-22, then After Story about Ep. 10-19 or so, this series would be much more tolerable, and might even make it to ""Mediocre"" status.

Music -- 2/5 (Annoying). Mostly variations of the ending themes. The timing of the soundtrack might be well done... maybe too well done that it becomes obvious when they want you to cry, and when they want you to laugh.

Drama -- 1/5 (Plain horrible). I didn't cry. It was cheesier than Wisconsin. I laughed in the scenes where I were ""supposed to"" cry.

Comedy -- 3.5/5 (Decent). Some amusing moments here and there. Would have been fine if they stuck to it, but Clannad has somewhat bipolar disorder -- it couldn't decide if it wanted to be a comedy or tragedy. In the end, both sides suffered.

Romance -- 2/5 (Bad). ToraDora! and Suzuka were more effective. ef - Tales series dealt with memory better than the Fuko arc.

Overall -- 2/5 (Not recommended). Stream some of it online to see if you like this sort of thing first. I think CrunchyRoll might have it.",1351036800,8,15293,4.763018867924528

4113450,5,B003E51VUQ,"This is the first half of the Clannad story.  'After Story' covers the other half.

Like AirTV and Kanon this show has a lot of the same themes and ideas, but this series takes a much less fantastical approach to the story telling.  It still has moments of fantasy, but it is more of a 'faith' based inexplicable force through the series that holds the background together rather than being the main event.

This first half is much less dramatic than Air or Kanon (don't worry, the 2nd half more than makes up for it), following the carefree and directionless days of Senior highschoolers whose 'plan A' did not work out, and they are desperately searching for some form of validation or direction to move in to gain some meaning to their lives.  Specifically it focuses on Tomoyo whose dreams of being a sports prodigy failed, and he finds some meaning in life in helping Nagisa fulfill her passion of resurrecting the school's drama club.  The first half of the series meanders about following different plot archs that do not really relate to eachother, but tie the lives of these characters together to collectively achieve Nagisa's dream.

Good story telling, fun characters, high drama, reminded me a lot of my life and friends from high school, addictive sound track, and solid voice acting... even the English version is good.  Definitely one to watch with your significant other.  There are some aspects of the fantasy and art style that I like better about Kanon, but in many ways I love this better due to it's relate-ability.",1334880000,,1537,4.769811320754717

4113465,5,B003E51VUQ,"This is a subtle twist on the slice of life anime drama genre.  The series features a high school delinquent Tomoya Okazaki and his friend Sunohara.  The story revolves mainly around Tomoya, while Sunohara is around for comic relief.  The series starts innocently enough, and appears at first glance to be a simple, straightforward high school drama.  It resembles  High School Rumble and Azumanga Daioh at first.  But as the episodes progress, the viewer discovers that not all is as it seems.

~ Light spoilers here ~

Of course this isn't a creepy, supernatural series, but there are a few moments where something 'out of the ordinary' is introduced.  But we find that many of the characters have pretty sad back stories.  Tomoya came to school on a basketball scholarship, but cannot play anymore due to an injury sustained during a beating by his father.  Another character is actually the representation of a girl in the hospital in a coma.

~ End of light spoilers ~

The comedy is well portrayed, and it keeps the show fun and helps balance out the sad and touching moments.  In particular I enjoyed Fuko and Tomoya's interactions.  She is always saying ""that's the worst!"" whenever someone asks if they are dating, or related.  They engage in a fierce and funny tongue twister battle (laughed out loud at that part!).  But we still get the feeling that Tomoya cares for her greatly and they have a kind of older brother/ younger sister relationship.  There are also some funny little in-jokes about 'dating sims'.  They are the little cuts that have the 'achievement' bubble pop up (Achievement Complete: Make someone drink juice through their nose! - Congratulations!) or something like that!

If you aren't hooked after the first couple of episodes, then perhaps this isn't the series for you.  By episode 6 I was riveted.  I haven't enjoyed very many serious, modern setting anime series lately (shout out to Eden of the East!), so this series was quite a surprise.

Of note:  I am watching the original US release version by Sentai (which does not include an English dub), and am very happy with the translation and subtitles.  All of the dry humor comes across.  The Japanese voice acting is superb, especially the female characters, and Fuko in particular.

I highly recommend this to adult anime fans.  Some of the younger fans may enjoy this (it is an all ages anime), but a lot of the themes really come across as more adult in nature (such as loss, heartache, redemption, etc.); which is not to say younger fans wouldn't enjoy it... the comedy alone is enough to endear younger audiences.

4113470,4,B003E51VUQ,"This show is definitely aimed at a younger audience (as most Animes are?), and I would like to say that it's also aimed towards a female audience as well... but it can be enjoyable to both.  As a guy, I say that it's a very enjoyable series.  I gave it a 4/5 star rating because it comes off as a little boring, and there is a ton of content that isn't necessary.  I find some jokes are way too overused, some characters have personalities that you never get used to (One of which is a main character.  It's irritating that I just can't like her), and the show itself has a very slow pace.  It's as if each person can't be bothered with whatever they're doing.

Revolving around friendship, each character aims to help another person with whatever they seem to need help with, provoked or unprovoked.  Friendships blossom, and people learn to break out of whatever shells they had been stuck in that held them back from socializing.

If you don't like stories that are purely about nice people doing nice things and making friends, then this show isn't your cup of tea.  I personally didn't leave the show going ""I want more!"" and foaming at the mouth (Such as ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Melancholy-of-Haruhi-Suzumiya-Anime-Legends/dp/B003KO1JRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (Anime Legends)</a>"" did to me...

4113486,5,B003E51VUQ,"Clannad is one of the most popular anime shows of all time. Part of what makes it so popular is that it appeals to a wide range of audiences; if you are a guy, a girl, old, young, if you like anime, or if you haven't really watched anime before, you will probably love it. It is my second favorite anime of all time, after School Rumble.

This is season one of Clannad. The next season you will have to buy seperately as Clannad After Story. This season takes place during the most of the main characters' last year of high school. After Story begins during the end of school and then shows what happens to the characters after. The main difference between the two seasons is that the first season focuses more or less evenly on all the main characters. Sure, Tomoya and Nagisa are the most often seen characters, but others like Tomoyo, Fuko, Kotomi, and Kyou (my favorite of the show) have almost as much screen time. These characters play significant roles in After Story, but not quite as important as in the first season, as After Story focuses mostly on Tomoya and Nagisa.

Clannad is the perfect blend of drama and romance with a bit of comedy in it as well. The animation is also amazing. The studio that created this show and several others, Key, is my favorite animation company ever. Everything looks so beautiful and the animation is clean. All in all, unless you absolutely hate anime (I have no idea why anyone would, though), this will be one of your favorite shows. It is very emotional; it will make you cry (After Story will make you cry even more).

If you love this show, make sure to finish the story by watching season two, Clannad After Story. Also check out other great shows from the same studio like Kanon and Air. Both are incredible and have the same animation style that I love.",1318464000,,1807,4.46969696969697

4113492,4,B003E51VUQ,"But I didn't think it was a bad anime at all. On the first Volume I felt about 6 of the episodes dragged on too long because they were about the same story. It was a weird switch because the first few episodes focus on the main girl, and then all of a sudden she takes a back seat.

I've never really been a fan of drama/comedy animies like this. This reminded me of Shuffle where it starts out cutesy and then gets serious hearing the heartbreaking stories of the characters. The series is pretty emotional though alright. A lot of tears are shed by the characters. Sometimes it was necessary, and sometimes it was random. For the first 12 episodes I'd give it 3/5 for the next 12 episodes I give it 4/5. Once the anime jumps back into the main story it gets pretty interesting once again.

I do kind of wish it allowed the main character to explore the other girls more outside of the one he choose. Seemed like it could have been interesting for him to come close with any of the other girls he befriended. Most of them were equally as nice and kind but in the end he chose who he wanted. Not that I had any problems with his selection but it just seemed unfair. I say that because some of the other girls seemed better suited for the main character. The Final episode on the set shows what I was thinking. Just how easily he could of been with one of the other girls because he makes a good match for just about any of them.

Overall even though these type of drama/comedy animies aren't my style I can tell that this one was done pretty well. 3/5 for me personally but 4/5 because it doesn't deserve to be rated less. It's a quality show.

btw the voice acting is really miscast for a lot of the characters. That was one of the reasons I couldn't get into it so much. For some voices it was perfect but for others it was like ""well...this little girl sounds like a 40 year old woman... I'll just go with it"". I'm familiar with Funimations usual voice cast...I'm just guess some of the other voice actors on their roster were doing other projects and they had to get who ever was free to do some of the roles. I'm guess on that one but that's really how it sounds.",1308355200,,2168,4.216867469879518

The series revolves around Tomoya Okazaki, a delinquent student with a kind heart and a sharp tongue, and his interactions with a group of girls;
Nagisa Furukawa, a shy but kind girl with a weak immune system who wants to revive the Drama Club.
Kotomi Ichinose, an eccentric genius who spends more time in the Library than in the presence of other.
Tomoyo Sakagami, a transfer student trying to become the Student Council President.
Fuuko Ibuki, a first year that carves starfish out of wood for her sister's wedding.
Kyou Fujibayashi, the elder of twin sisters that has a very aggressive personality.

Ratings:

Packaging: 9/10; I think it would have been better to use slim packs over the single CD holder with the discs stacked but at least it didn't damage the discs

Plot: 10/10; nothing to complain about

Dubbing: 9/10; Only real problems are pronunciation and a few characters that seemed to be cast wrong, but you'll grow used to it so it's not a train wreck

Characters: 10/10; The characters will grow on you fairly quickly

Music: 10/10; The music really helps set the mood and has a good variety of the original tracks as well arranged",1307404800,,2027,5.831081081081081
4113495,5,B003E51VUQ,"After watching a few episodes of this on youtube, i decided it would definitely be worth buying. The storyline is incredible and you easily become attached to the characters. Speaking of the characters, all of them have excellent personalities, some funny, some serious, but all entertaining.

The drama and comedy in this series is balanced very well, and the emotional ride it sends you on is great. One minute you could be seriously down from one thing that just happened, maybe even crying, and the next it can change almost instantly to laughing. This series is just that good.

The only problem i have with this series, is not with the series itself, but with the casing. Make sure you take great care taking the discs out, there's a high potential of them breaking due to the poor design of the case. Basically it's a spindle in the middle with the four discs stacked on top of each other. The spindle does NOT push down, which makes this already difficult task even worse. Be super careful when removing the discs if you want to keep them in one piece. Mine, once i got them out, were put into slipcases that i placed inside the case (after cutting the spindle out).

Anyways, besides the casing issue, this series is incredible and if you're looking for one, if not THE greatest anime of all time, be sure to pick this one up!",1304726400,7,1335,4.554166666666666

If you're interested in anime and you want to watch a good anime, look no further, Clannad will not disappoint you. It's on my top 5 anime series. Most balance in terms of humor, action, drama and love. It's a harem anime, at least in the first season, but it's not your typical harem anime where the main guy is a total loser and looks like a major geek.

I'm going to write this review with some details intentionally cut out so it won't spoil the anime for you.

Characters (Many of the main ones in no specific order)
Tomoya - Main guy character.
Nagisan - Main girl character. Shoulder length dark hair.
Fuuko - Girl that carves starfish (commonly mistaken for ninja stars and stars)
Ryou - One of the twin sister. Short blue hair with white ribbon.
Kyou - Second twin sister. Long blue hair with white ribbon.
Youhei Sunohara - Tomoya's best friend. Blond hair. Same age and similar height to Tomoya.
Mei Sunohara - Sister of Sunohara. Little girl.
Sanae Furukawa - Nagisan's mother. Long black hair.
Akio Furukawa - Nagisan's father.
Tomoyo - Commonly mistaken for Tomoya in terms of name. She is a girl with long white hair.
Yukine Miyazawa - Dorm mother, person in charge of the dorm Youhei lives in. Usually wears an apron.
Kotomi - Girl that reads books all the time at the library. Blue, short hair.

Again, details are purposely left out so you can find out on your own.

ANIME SERIES DETAIL:
- There are 2 seasons and 1 movie.
- The movie should be watched AFTER you finish the all the episodes because it is a summary of the first and final season. However, I would skip the movie altogether because the movie is not very good. If the episode series is a 10, the movie is a 5 at best. Very weak.
- Each season has a finale at episode 22. The last few are either summaries or EXTRAS. Extras include different story switches or pre-series intro.

There are about 2-3 extras after each season. So 24-25 episodes per season. Watch Clannad first and then Clannad: After Story.

Clannad season 1 is about school life and first introduces Tomoya to Nagisan. The first season is significantly more humorous and is brilliantly balanced in terms of humor, drama, and love. It is more laid back but occasionally has some serious episodes that deal with life situations. The second season, however, is much more dramatic, but still retains enough balance to keep the anime enjoyable and the drama bearable. The second season deals a lot more with the serious side of reality and less of the goofy school days.

This series will bring up all sorts of emotions from you. This anime is good enough to be declared brilliantly put together, a masterpiece. Do not skip this anime.",1294790400,3,2849,4.531128404669261

4113501,3,B003E51VUQ,"Clannad is a romance/drama with a good helping of comedy.  It's produced by Kyoto Animation and Key, the same folks who made Kanon and Air.

First off, I should mention the good stuff.  The comedy is very well done; there are many epic moments of hilarity in the first two discs, and a couple of great jokes in the last two discs (like Kanon, the comedy moments become less frequent as the drama takes over in later episodes).  Clannad is a romance in the harem vein, and while harem romance isn't really my thing, Clannad seems to be more dignified and well thought out in its harem scenario than many other animes.  Lastly, the closing credits song, ""The Big Dango Family,"" is one of my favorite pieces of music in anime, rivaled only by The Vision of Escaflowne's opening theme, ""No Need For Promises."" It's a really beautiful track, while also being funny and cute at the same time.

So why only three stars?  Clannad, again, is a romance/drama with comedy.  The romance is done well enough, and it nails the comedy completely... but the drama is lacking, and drama makes up a big chunk of the series.  This review is tricky for me, because it's hard to explain why the drama falls flat without going into spoiler territory.  I appreciate drama - when Kanon dropped most of its comedy in the second half and went all tragic on us, I became more hooked than ever - but the payoff has to be good.  Clannad built up the drama to levels where I thought I was going to be rewarded with awesomely mind-blowing revelations, but when the reveals finally came, I was left feeling underwhelmed every single time.

How about some spoiler free examples?

Do you think the cryptic intro sequences with the girl and her automaton friend are leading to something amazing?  Perhaps something similar to how Kanon's intro sequences seemed strange and unconnected, but ended up being perfectly appropriate and important to the story after the reveals in Kanon's final episode?  Well, throw those hopes away right now, because the girl and her robot end up being nothing more than... well, that'd be a spoiler.  It wouldn't be much of a spoiler, considering what the intro sequences end up representing, but a spoiler nonetheless.

How about the socially handicapped genius and the ""hidden world"" her parents discovered, which Kotomi says could save the human race?  For all the drama that builds up during this arc, the reveal is so, so painfully underwhelming that it's literally laughable.  There's a montage scene with a briefcase being handed off from person to person around the world, all of them repeating the same thing for about a minute.  Given the context, and the absolute absurdity of her parents' decision (protect something that could potentially change the human race for the better, versus, *SPOILER*), my friend and I were laughing while this ""touching"" scene unfolded.  We were laughing so hard that we were crying, but it wasn't a good laugh.  Our tears were those of disappointment.

I could go on, but you get the idea.  In short, Clannad doesn't do drama very well, and such a large chunk of the second half of Clannad is devoted to drama.  That's a pity, because this show had its comedy down pat, and it could have been something amazing if it had stuck to being a romance/comedy and kept its drama to a minimum.  Instead, the stellar comedy is put into reserve and the so-so drama takes over, the comedy only coming out to play once in a great while.  It got to the point where I only cared about the characters when they were being funny.

I watched this show subtitled, so unfortunately, I can't comment on the English dub.

To wrap things up:  if you're looking for a harem romance with a good sense of humor, Clannad is a very good pick.  You'll have to put up with some mediocre drama, but if your love for harem romance is strong enough, you probably won't mind it.  For my part, I only tolerate harem romance, so when other major aspects of the show (the drama in this case) are off, it makes the watch difficult for me.

I haven't watched the second series, After Story, yet.  I plan to eventually; hopefully it will raise my opinion of Clannad as a whole.  I think these 24 episodes are worth three stars.",1288569600,9,4226,4.626845637583893
4113502,5,B003E51VUQ,"Clannad by Kyoto Animation is one of the most beautiful harem anime series ever produced. A harem anime series with mixed genres like comedy, tragedy, suspense, drama, etc. The storyline follows a young male high school delinquent named Okazaki, Tomoya & his interactions between multiple high school girls, particularly one very special girl; Furukawa, Nagisa. As the storyline progresses Tomoya continues to get more involved with the personal lives of these high school girls enduring both triumphs & hardships. The plot of the anime series is quite slow with some dull moments but it holds more of the romantic comedic/tragic material that is expected to arise within the storyline. The pacing of the plot might be slow but it is necessary for the viewer to take advantage of that dull time period to understand the characters & identify what characteristics they all share & hold uniquely. Overall, one of the best romantic comedy or tragedy anime series whose popularity mirrors famous Shakespearean literature.
The english voice acting is well performed with the emotions & personalities of the characters portrayed perfectly & precisely. The dialogue is of course romantic, touching, dramatic, & compassionate with humour integrated.
This is a compulsory (required) anime series for all anime fans.

When ADV (now known Section 23) first liscened it. They went by a new technighe. Get the title our in the market quick and in a low price, as the result it is relased subtitled only in the original Japanese track. I don't watch Japanese in Japanese (you might know what I mean)! But thankfully on March 2010 they announceed that this and four other titles (Legend of the Dark Kings, Blue Drop, Ghost Hound and Tears to Tiara) are receivng a dubb. I don't care how it's sound, but hearing it in english is what I want.
  There is a sqeual to this title 'Clannad After Story"" witch is also liscened by them, but it is yet to be dubbed, and I don't know when they are annoucing it.
  The packeting tick some customers of with the fact that the four dicks are stacked because if you try to take them out, they might break (if you don't know how to take them out). I don't care how they packge it, just as long as they release it complete (I don't like seperate box sets or singles (which most anime lisceners don't do anmyore)).

One of those kinds where all four are stacked on a single spindly pole thing, you know, what goes through the little holey thing in the middle of the DVD, thus securing it in the case. Though I'm sure it has done a fine job of preventing them flying around the place during transit, every time I wish to watch them, I have to face the fear of the dvd shattering in my hand as I remove it, as well as the inconvenience of removing several dvds. Hence, if one does not miss dubs, I suggest going for the sub only collections. For packaging reasons only.

As for the dubs, I now wonder why on earth I bothered with them. Though admittedly I am a strong sub-supporter at the best of times, these dubs really irk me. One cannot replace Nagisa's Japanese Seiyuu; Mai Nakahara has just mastered the voice of cuteness. Sunohara is overly squeaky and thats as far as I got. But hey Clannad is awesome, if you hate subs, dubs could work I guess, but thats just common sense.

Subs have two colours<-(thus indicating, I am not American), white or yellow, allowing two people to talk at once without much confusion. Not as pretty as most fansubs, but are they ever? They do the job.",1282608000,10,1274,4.282157676348548

The not so good: Poor packaging (spindle), mediocre English dub.  In Japan they released a Blu-Ray version.

The long review:
====================
This package includes the entire first season of Clannad including the 2 short alternate storyline OVAs (24 episodes, each 25 minutes.)  It does not contain the movie or the second season known as Clannad After Story.  This one is also the first English voice dub as opposed to the previous release which was Japanese with English subtitles only.

This series is THE benchmark for slice of life drama with a touch of the surreal.  It is NOT another 'high-school' anime.  The more you watch the more hidden themes you pick up.  The story begins slowly then as it goes on there is more and more character development.  The characters have depth, flaws, and are not cookie-cutter stereotypes.

If you are unfamiliar with anime in Japan anime is not just 'cartoons for kids' Anime can be mature dramas, romance, period/historical as well as the action 'blow-em up' varieties we in the states are more exposed to.  This show make a fine choice if you want to try something else other than guns, swords, giant robots, spaceships or magic explosions.

The parallel ""Hidden World"" storyline is very abstract and appears to be unrelated.  It's not (although you have to watch Clannad After Story to get the entire picture.)

Clannad engendered a plethora of emotions from a quick chuckle to gut-wrenching tears.  I own about 300 anime titles and have watched hundreds more.  This show is in my Top 3 however among the dramas I have seen this is by far the best.  If you liked this one I'd recommend seeing Kanon (the newer one with 24 episodes.)

Why I did not give one of my favorite series 5 stars:
======================================================
You will miss a great deal of the original intent and emotional cues if you listen to the English version.  The packaging was also very poor: all DVDs stacked on a spindle.  This is very prone to scratching and if you value your DVDs you'll be picking up individual cases.  Only in Japan is this on Blu-Ray. The soundtrack is not available in the US.

Still if you have never watched any anime and want to start with a drama that will leave an impression, pick this one up.",1282262400,2,2491,4.793427230046948
4113507,3,B003E51VUQ,"I am not a voice-purist.  I've watched many other animes in both English and Japanese subtitled.  A good English dub might sound different but it shouldn't really contradict the characterization and the tone of the story.  But this English dub of Clannad fails for all those reasons.  Most horrendously, it transforms Nagisa from a demure, uncertain girl into a loud, sarcastic, go-getter right from the beginning.  Her English voice is not cute at all.  It is not the Nagisa whose growth of shy, subdued confidence is elemental to the storyline.  You will be surprised how different the tone of the story comes out merely from the change in voice.  Yes, it is  really that bad.

If you absolutely must listen to a story in English because you're incapable of reading a sub-titled version, then go ahead and buy this monstrosity.  All others, however, should buy the original subtitled-only version:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clannad-Collection-1/dp/B001PSULZ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clannad: Collection 1</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clannad-Collection-2/dp/B001VFM5XS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clannad: Collection 2</a>.  Don't pay for this English-Dub version even though it also has subtitles, because you're watching a DVD that had to degrade the quality to fit all of the terrible English voicetracks on it.  Plus, why pay to be insulted?  Buy the original version instead.

I give this review 3 overall starts: 5 for the fact that it's Clanned, zero for the English-dub.",1281744000,5,1586,6.081081081081081
4113508,4,B003E51VUQ,"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

The Clannad visual novel is divided into two segments, or story arcs--School Life and After Story--which serve as different phases in the overall story. At the beginning of the game, only the School Life arc is available to play, but once the player has completed the scenarios available in School Life, After Story is made accessible. This is through the collection of eight lights, or orbs, which can be obtained after a character's scenario is completed; one of the lights will disappear while still in School Life, but will reappear in After Story.[1]

School Life contains the final year of high school of the main protagonist, Tomoya Okazaki, in which he meets all of the characters in the game, though the focus is kept on the five heroines in the story, including the main heroine Nagisa Furukawa. After Story is mainly a continuation of Nagisa's story, and is set immediately after School Life when Nagisa and Tomoya are now living their lives as a couple, and extends into the next ten years.[1] Characters from School Life do appear, but play minor roles compared to their roles in that arc. In order to view the true ending of Clannad, all thirteen lights must be obtained. Originally, the lights were meant to be items that players could use in the game, but since this increased the game's difficulty, and detracted from the storyline, the function of the lights was changed to be simpler and less intrusive.[2]

Clannad's gameplay requires little interaction from the player as most of the duration of the game is spent simply reading the text that appears on the game screen which represents either dialogue between the various characters or the inner thoughts of the protagonist. An important aspect of Clannad (as in nearly every visual novel) are the ""decision points"" which appear every so often which give the player the chance to choose from a limited number of options. The time between these decision points is variable and can occur anywhere from a minute to much longer. The game pauses at such moments and depending on which choice the player makes, the plot will progress in a specific direction. There are five main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story, and there are thirteen possible endings. Each plot line can be achieved through multiple replays.[1]

Clannad is Key's second longest work, as reported by Yto Tonokawa where he stated that Clannad is about 4000 words fewer than Key's 2008 game Little Busters! Ecstasy.[3] While both of Key's first two previous works, Kanon and Air, had been released first as adult games and then censored for the younger market, Key's third work Clannad was released for all ages and does not contain risqu situations or barely any fan service other than one small scene.[1]",1281398400,,2849,4.892339544513457
4113509,5,B003E51VUQ,"This series is an excellent buy. If you're unsure of it but watch a bunch of anime then I'd say to give it a try at least. I wasn't sure when I first saw it but it quickly grew on me as one of my favorites. From making you roll around laughing to inducing tears, this series is full of all kinds of emotional twists. Upon first glimpse, I thought it was just another Anime involving high school students, but the more I watched, the more I realized how much of a masterpiece this was. Definitely check it out.

UPDATE: I just purchased the blu-ray Clannad Collection and as usual with this series, I'm very pleased. It has both English and Japanese DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 with this set. The audio listed on the product description with Amazon shows it as Japanese Audio and doesn't list English, but if you examine the screenshots of the back of the case, in the lower left hand part of it shows both English and Japanese. I will thoroughly enjoy watching this series again in the higher resolution and remain here hoping Sentai Filmworks re-releases After Story for blu-ray sometime soon.

Also, another thing about the blu-ray series is the case is much better than the one used for the DVD set. The blu-ray case has all 3 discs seperate instead of stacking each disc on one spindle. Much easier and safer for the disc with the blu-ray collection.",1278979200,39,1350,4.506122448979592
4113510,5,B003E51VUQ,"This, to me, is one of the best that anime can offer to an American public. It has the right amount of humor, sentimentality, and honesty without leaving you with more than the other.

Tomoya Okazaki is a bitter, sarcastic, pranker in his senior year of high school, spending most of his time ridiculing his friend and fellow lethargist, Sunohara. However, it all seems to change when he meets Nagisa Furukawa, a kind-hearted, yet unsure, girl who wishes to revive the drama club.

The journey the two go through together with the friends they make along the way, is one you shouldn't miss.

The new English Dubb was rather well made and interesting. It followed almost step-by-step with the dialogue in the subtitles for the Japanese language.

The DVD casing came in pristine condition. Inside it, the disks (there are four of them) came stacked ontop of each other; They contiue to play well.

Again, I highly recommend this to anyone who's a fan of charcter-driven stories.",1277078400,92,977,4.826347305389222

Just think of something happy in your life and be like ""this is the happiest moment in my life"" now think about how it would feel if all of your happiness just got taken away leaving an enormous hole in your heart... Doesn't feel any good huh? well its not all that sad, it has its funny moments throughout the series, and the artwork is beautiful same goes for the story and i love the Big Dango Family song. If you haven't watched this and don't have it well what the hell are you waiting for!? Get this Collection right now so u can become one of those people who just realized that he/she has feelings.",1276905600,2,720,4.15
4113512,5,B003E51VUQ,"Clannad illustrates life of Tomoya Okazaki, the protagonist. He is initially illustrated to be delinquent who is finding no joy to his everyday life, until he meets girl at the slope just before the main entrance of school that he attends.
Based on the game of same title, just as what I would expect after watching some of Kyoto Animation's conversion of game (such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kanon/dp/B001R10BD2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kanon</a>&nbsp;which I also recommend) to anime, this is beautifully executed as well.

Story mostly revolves around different characters including Fuuko, the girl carving starfish sculpture for everyone in school, hoping to invite everyone to wedding of her older sister, and Kotomi a mysterious genius who Tomoya meets in the library, while centering storyline of Nagisa. (In the original game, story progressions with each character are considered to be parallel world, so the anime version has quite a bit of structural change to its overall storyline. For two other main characters Kyo and Tomoyo, they were deemed too difficult to integrated into main story line, therefore Tomoyo's parallel world was included as its own episode, which is in this DVD set, and Kyo's story is included in an episode in After Story.)

The show illustrates overall theme of the show ""family"" very well and 24 episodes will offer you plenty of laughs, and weeps.

While I have originally watched through this on Netflix (dub), I'm making another round of it in original Japanese track now. (Both tracks are excellent.)
Some music tracks are from original show, and some of them are arranged version of them, and they are all great.

I can say, without any doubt, that this is the show I would recommend for everyone of any age.",1276819200,4,1805,5.32280701754386
4113513,5,B003E51VUQ,"There's so many words in the English dictionary, but all of them fail to truly described this impressive and emotionally engrossing series. Starting from episode one of the first season, you start getting wrapped into Nagisa and Tomoya's world and slowly over time start to love them and their ""family"". At times, I found myself closely relating to a character and really rooting for them. I think this is what makes a series great.

Clannad, based off of the original visual novel game from Key, then animated by Kyoto Animation, really brings this world to life. Clannad had amazing art and animation that definitely makes it one of the greats. I won't say everyone will like this series, because there's always something wrong with everything. However this series is one of those that comes to close to perfect, to a pure masterpiece.

If anything about Clannad should stand out the most, I think it's the music. The soundtrack comes with many different varieties of music from your electronic style, to piano ballads, to a bit of soft rock (sort of). Nagisa's main theme piano rendition of the main series them ""Dango Daikazoku"". At first when you hear the song in the series, it sounds really cute and really sweet. However as you make it through the series to the end, you start getting more of a bittersweet feel of the song. Its as if the song evolved throughout the series which makes it even better. Depressing as Nagisa's theme sounds, it also has a bit of hope to it that, even though you get sad, you also can't help but feel a little happy as well.

As far as the DVDs go, I own the original sub-only version from Section23, however I was not impressed with the encoding to DVD. For those who know tech speak in regards to video quality, there was a telecine/ITVC problem in which they screwed up the field order. It's definitely noticable in scene transitions. I'm hoping this new batch collection with dub tracks will also include better encoded video as well. I'm all about high quality, as high as DVDs allow, so I hope Section23 learned from their previous product. However my rating for this series isn't affected by a quality problem in the video.
