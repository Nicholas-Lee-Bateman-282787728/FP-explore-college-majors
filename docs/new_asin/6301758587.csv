7815126,5,6301758587,"i was amazed at the strength of this man!
shown is his 1980 defeat of Pat Patterson in a classic match from MSG.
John Studd, Heenan, and others are shown. also a tag match where he teams with Hogan vs. Harley Race and Hercules Hernandez.
there is an entertaining debate b/w Patera and Heenan...
Patera literally swings Heenan around the ring by his neck via leather strap!
highly recommended!",1211414400,,392,4.695652173913044
