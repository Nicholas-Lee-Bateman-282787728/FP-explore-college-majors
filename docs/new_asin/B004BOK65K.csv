I Mean this was an alright DVD back it is one year after CZW started.

Though when I Recieved this DVD on the back of the Case all of the Matches that are listed where out of Order.

The Match between Z-Barr Vs. Lord Everett DeVore isn't even on here at all.

Though most of the matches where boring the last 4 Matches on this DVD Where Awesome.

So I give this DVD a 8/10",1473811200,,468,4.043478260869565
