8763847,2,B01GWBVYB4,"TOP GUN, the immensely lucrative 1986 Paramount release about the Navys program for crack Naval Aviators in Miramar, California, was probably better than it deserved to be.  Really, it's a fairly mediocre ""cocky-guy-in-the-service"" flick, heightened by aggressive pop/rock music that made critics of the time view it more of a video than a plot-driven movie.

Actually, TOP GUN is four flicks in one:
(1) MTV meets the movies.  No one had heard so much rock music in a military movie before, or seen so many music-video shots.  Far too much of this  flick seems to have been shot at the 'golden hour' along Southern California beaches, with quick takes full of booming fighter aircraft, the lurching motorcycle Maverick (Tom Cruise) pilots on the ground, and ""old man"" officers bemused by Maverick's daring, sonic-booming bravado.  Not for nothing did Mark Harris, at reelchanger.com, cite ""Top Guns release as the moment when movies changed into pure product.  Per Harris, ""[T]he films aim was not story but the transient heightening of sensation that has subsequently become the basis of most forms of contemporary media.""  The pounding soundtrack, featuring acts like Kenny Loggins, the Miami Sound Machine, and Jerry Lee Lewis, is probably best remembered for introducing Berlin's ""Take My Breath Away"" for the inevitable sex-scene.  Both the soundtrack CD and the vinyl version still sell well.

(2) Propaganda.  Made with every support from Lockheed Aircraft and the U.S. Navy, the film glamorized the dogfight appeal of naval aviation, essentially turning aerial training sessions into video games and causing applications to the Top Gun program to soar by five hundred percent.  Based on sheer measurable outcome, this must be considered the most successful artistic aspect of TOP GUN.  It helped pull military movies out of their post-Vietnam malaise and made killing the enemy sexy again.

(3) Relentless machismo.  With actors like Cruise, Val Kilmer, Tom Skeritt and Michael Ironside playing characters with nicknames like ""Maverick,"" ""Iceman,"" ""Viper,"" and ""Jester,"" it seems as though a testosterone-induced brawl  is always about to break out.  So much so that the free VUDU stream has toned down on some of the more questionable repartee like the scene in class when one cadet remarks that a film of a downed MiG ""gave [him] a ha*d-on"" and his buddy replies, ""Don't tease me.""  The naked-torso volleyball game has become a camp classic,  the players all shirtless and gleaming, with much hugging of shoulders and patting of butts.  (Except for Anthony Edwards' ""Goose""; see below.)  When a movie is so risibly homoerotic it becomes a gay icon, it cannot be a true classic too.

(4) Forties Romance, warmed over.  Amidst all this high-tech, high-speed, pounding bonding, TOP GUN  film slows down occasionally for some heterosexual emotion.  Cruise's ""Maverick"" hooks up with a toothsome flight instructor, androgynously named ""Charlie"" (Kelly McGillis); the doomed Goose, the only one wearing a shirt in the volleyball scene, is shown to have a flighty but pretty wife (young Meg Ryan) and a son.  I need hardly tell the experienced viewer the outcome of a romance between a pretty flight instructor and a narcissistic air ace headed for bigger things.

So, is TOP GUN a very good movie?  Hardly.  Did it work?  It succeeded in reaching different audience segments in different ways, not all of them wholly salutary.  Fasten your seatbelts and proceed at your own risk.
