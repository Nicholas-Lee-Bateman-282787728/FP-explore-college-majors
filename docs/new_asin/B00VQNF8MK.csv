8710888,5,B00VQNF8MK,"This is a nicely packaged set with a nice concert and awesome playing.  While two concerts are included, it would have been nice if there were a few different songs on both sets.  But overall this is nicely packaged, has a very nice book included, and some sweet live music.  If you like Mr. Big, and if you missed their Stories We Could Tell tour, then this set is worth the investment.  If you have seen Mr. Big, you will like it too.  I did.  Yes, a little expensive, but great content.  The 2014 Tour Documentary is fun to watch and the BluRay is fantastic.  Wait till you see Mr. Big live in Japan in a huge arena.  Nice.",1502064000,,626,4.19327731092437
