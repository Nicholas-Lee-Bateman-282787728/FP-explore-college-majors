2789814,5,B000O59A2A,"This video is exactly what it claims--the best of Chappelle.  It put me into stitches almost immediately.  I freely admit that some of Dave's humor can be crass, but he is a genius at delivering lines.  The only drawback was that seeing this video made me wish I had his stand-up specials as well.  With such genuine comedic genius like Dave Chappelle in the world, one wonders how scummy frauds like Katt Williams ever managed to scrape together a career.  But this is about Chappelle--truly entertaining.  Not for kids though, strictly adult entertainment.",1249344000,2,558,4.946236559139785
2789815,4,B000O59A2A,"...Slap! and other classic lines from this best of set. Chappelle channels the spirits of both Prince and Rick James in Charlie Murphy's True Hollywood Stories so well it proves that comedy taken from real life is usually the funniest and Dave's commitment to character is a pleasure to watch. Glad to see Wayne Brady, Tyrone and Lil' Jon made the cut as well. We miss you Dave.",1238112000,,378,4.573529411764706

2789818,4,B000O59A2A,"Dave Chapelle is a natural funny person, who also addresses real issues but in his language (comedy).  His sketches hilarious and i would recommend him and all his standup releases if you're the type that enjoys (open-type) comedy and are not easily offended.",1208563200,3,259,5.023255813953488
2789819,4,B000O59A2A,"Fantastic!  Dave Chappelle is such a classic comedian and these are some of his best.  Dave appeals to such a wide audience and I laughed throughout his entire DVD, especially the scenes involving Charlie Murphy.

If you are thinking about buying this DVD I would highly recommend it.  I wasn't disappointed and I don't believe you will be either.",1190246400,8,347,4.830508474576271
2789820,4,B000O59A2A,"No matter how many times you watch these classic sketches, you'll still love it, But this is just a way for Comedy Central to make more money off someone who doesn't want nothing to do with them

  DON'T BUY THIS!!!

If you do wanna buy it for your collection, get a used one. Don't let Comedy Central win.",1181347200,3,306,4.224137931034483
2789821,5,B000O59A2A,"This is a great (and very cheap) alternative to buying both seasons. Plus, you can cut out all the ""extra"" stuff less people watch, like the musical performances, etc.",1180051200,11,167,4.793103448275862
2789822,4,B000O59A2A,"Preliminary reviews for this collection say viewers should just buy the two seasons of the show. I agree. But pound for pound, minute for minute, the highlights of this show beat out 95 percent of any year's crop of film or TV comedies. This is two-and-a-half hours of inappropriate race-obsessed laughter. It can occupy the same spot as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Late-Night-with-Conan-O-Brien-The-Best-of-Triumph-the-Insult-Comic-Dog/dp/B0002DB5OA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Late Night with Conan O'Brien - The Best of Triumph the Insult Comic Dog</a>&nbsp;as the perfect crack-em-up closer to any party. This is the guaranteed laugh you need when nothing else will do. Skit-based comedy is perfect for repurposing, as ""Saturday Night Live"" has discovered, and there's no reason there shouldn't be a best-of for ""Chappelle's Show"" to serve the same function.

Best of all: ""Chappelle's Show"" wipes the street with the best of ""SNL.""",1179878400,9,982,6.274074074074074
2789823,1,B000O59A2A,"I give this one star because the package is not necessary.  The show only had 2 seasons on comedy central.  Then they came out with the ""lost episodes"" which where only like 3 episodes.  Everyone has already bought the season sets so why make a best of.  Yes I understand that people who have never bought the seasons at all would like this items at it's reasonable price $15, but this is just another way to make money off of people.  Buy the season sets of you want the ""best of"" because they were all good.",1173744000,12,509,4.260416666666667

It's odd though that if white people use the ""N"" word in front of Blacks, they will riot, loot and burn businesses. But when Chappelle uses the ""N"" word over and over in this video, the Black audience just smiles and laughs, hmmmm.",1447027200,,250,4.434782608695652

2789855,4,B000O59A2A,Anyone else would get in trouble for saying or doing the things Chapelle does in his skits but he does it with such a deftness everyone can enjoy it.  The language isn't always the best so probably not for younger impressionable viewers,1373760000,,236,4.619047619047619
2789856,5,B000O59A2A,This dvd is really hilarious. Hopefully I'll be able to buy all his seasons. And when I can ill buy Half Baked too. I wish he could bring his t.v. series back or make some movies.,1373155200,,179,4.0

This has all of my favorite skits on it (except the Fear Factor one--love that one!!) and the DVD is almost flawless. It's a bit laggy here and there, which is why I had to give the product four stars. Anyway, I wish that Dave Chappelle would come out with more skits but if these are the only ones, I'm happy to keep watch them over and over again--they never get old.",1317686400,2,431,4.142857142857143
2789863,4,B000O59A2A,"I'm not going to go into detail, because the product sheet and other reviews have covered things pretty well.  I wanted to note a couple of things others have said.

This DVD has EVERY good episode of the Dave Chappelle show.  Period.  It even has the other Charlie Murphy/Rick James stories that aren't on the other DVDs.  There's really no reason to buy the other seasons if you buy this one, unless you're just a completionist.  To the person that said this DVD is pointless: it's not.  The season DVD sets are the pointless ones.

One star down for one thing: the lie that is ""uncensored"".  You should understand that this DVD is not ""uncensored"".  A better term would be ""unfiltered"" - meaning the swearing is left in, but other than that, it's quite censored.  A good example is the Charlie Murphy/Rick James story at the China Club, where the breasts are censored.  Now I'm sure this was just part of the filming and all, but to me, if you're going to call something ""uncensored"", there should be...uh...no censoring.

Don't let that deter you though.  If you're looking for Chappelle, just get this DVD and skip the others.  There were a lot of unfunny skits on the season DVDs.  Jump right to the good stuff with this one.",1268611200,,1231,4.577981651376147
