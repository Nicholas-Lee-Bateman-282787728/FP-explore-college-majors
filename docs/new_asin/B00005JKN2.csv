1438396,2,B00005JKN2,"When a film compels an audience with three dimensional characters, an interesting story, and honest emotion, we're ready to listen to whatever ""message"" the filmmaker wants to send us. When the film, however, is ALL about the message, I hear nothing, and I refuse to listen. Such is the case with Heaven, a beautifully shot film that is also one of the most pretentious films to come out this year.  It opens with a view of rolling hills from a virtual helicopter, with boxy, pixillated trees and clouds, and the ""pilot"" asking how high he can go. That's a perfect metaphor for this virtual ""film,"" with its boxy unreal characters doing silly, unlikeable, unbelievable things in order to support the heavy-handed symbolism the filmmakers cram down the viewers throat. If Hollywood is often guilty of gratuitous sex and violence, Heaven rates a triple X in pretension. And if this is Heaven, I can only imagine how it will look in Hell.",1033430400,13,935,4.807453416149069
1438397,4,B00005JKN2,"Very suspenseful - very touching.
Tykwer shows the abysses of a corrupt society. High police officers are involved in drug dealing, so how could ever the truth be revealed.
The sad truth about an arrested, righteous young lady, who couldn't bear any more the destructive influence of drugs to her beloved ones. Seeking revenge on one of the most responsible dealers, instead she killed four innocent other people by mischance. No way for her, ever to be happy again. A hopeless life without sense.
Just at least there's this little hope, by help of a young police apprentice, who fell for her, to flee and finish her revenge on the right person.
But accepting his help, she realizes the unconditional big feeling that he has towards her, and she returns his love.
Now there are two hopeless lives.
But a wonderful moment of love, and a heaven!",1014681600,4,843,4.741496598639456
1438398,5,B00005JKN2,"In his first English language film, ""Heaven"", German director Tom Tykwer abandons his earlier displays visual pyrotechnics, fast cut editing, and adrenaline laced pacing, to present us with heart felt meditation on the nature of unconditional love. This may disappoint some fans of his brilliant trilogy of films (""Night Sleepers"", ""Run Lola Run"" and ""Princess and the Warrior"") which explored the themes of syncronicity, metaphysics and causality. It is the blissful performance of the cameleon-like actress Cate Blanchett that allows Tykwer the space to breathe and expand his artistic vision.
""Heaven"" begins as a thriller involving a woman obsessed with avenging the death of her husband, but quickly shifts gears and becomes an exploration of love between doomed outsiders, another favorite Tykwer theme. Tykwer shot the film in Italy and it is technically a bi-lingual film, because much of the dialogue is in Italian. Giovanni Ribisi, whose career has alternated between lackluster and compelling acting efforts, presents a starkly well crafted perfomance of an Italian policeman who becomes obsessed with Cate Blanchett's school teacher character. The langorous pacing of ""Heaven"" allows us linger on the voluptuous camera work of Frank Griebe, Tykwer's brilliant cinematographer. Griebe's sensual, impressionistic lens has become the trademark of a Tykwer film.
In his last film, ""The Princess and the Warrior"", Tywker gave ample notice that he was maturing as a director, and was becoming more concerned with character development over technical gimmickery. Many of Tykwer's younger devotees may point out logical flaws in the script or find the film's more tender moments absurd. ""Heaven"" is about the frailty of the human psyche and, for Tykwer, it is the triumph of substance over style.",1013731200,26,1800,5.4784172661870505

1438464,2,B00005JKN2,"Great potential morphs into boring, incoherent, flabby mess. It started off very nicely, with good tension & mystery. Cate Blanchett's interrogation scene is an amazing show of her acting skills. The escape is interesting enough. But then it goes all sideways from there.

Character motivations are completely off - Giovanni Ribisi's character really throws his life away so haphazardly? And Cate Blanchett's character (who began as such an ""ethical"" vigilante) becomes rather indifferent to the ruination she brings to the people around her. She also reneges on her earlier promise to submit to justice once her target was destroyed. The whole thing makes very little sense and it was hard to feel engaged with the story.

Pretty images, yes. Good acting, yes. Nice production, yes. The film's ending shot is, depending on one's perspective, poetic, way too literal, or just dumb.",1470096000,,881,5.24113475177305

1438539,5,B00005JKN2,"The descriptions of this movie are covered by other reviewers.  I just want to add that Cate Blanchett does not compromise her natural and genuine talent  by covering her face in gobs of make-up, nor does she gain public attention by sexuality alone.  Rather, her sexuality reveals itself through her natural beauty.  Cate Blanchett exudes confidence and nonconformance in each movie I've seen so far.  An actress of this caliber, in my opinion, is long overdue. Thanks Cate, for being a true woman's advocate, be that on purpose or as a natural consequence of your own values.",1454630400,,577,4.907216494845361
1438540,2,B00005JKN2,"Euro arthouse nonsense -- and I say that as a fan of *good* European art films. It's built posthumously on a script by arthouse darling Krzysztof Kieslowski, directed by the generally but not always awful Tom Tykwer, and stars the always brilliant Blanchett, who does the best she can with an almost invisible character here. For a movie about an English woman who's moved to commit acts of terrorism, there is, amazingly, no drama, no tension, no discussion of the large issues it suggests. Just a lot of arty Italian scenery for the characters to mope around in endlessly. What little story there is is ridiculous and utterly unbelievable, as Blanchett with the help of a throughly mopey Ribisi literally strolls out of prison, then the two of them literally stroll around beautiful Italian settings forever while the whole Italian gendarmerie supposedly scours the country for them. The climax, which is supposed to be a gorgeous metaphor, is absolutely preposterous. If Blanchett weren't in it it'd be a 100 percent failure, but she manages to give it some pathos it doesn't deserve. Pass.",1449014400,,1093,4.978142076502732

Tom Tykwer (""Run Lola Run"") adapted and directed this, the first of the three.

Starring Cate Blanchett as a woman bent on revenge, and Giovanni Ribisi as the love-struck man who can not help but come to her aid, this is a mesmerizingly - beautiful film which you will watch mover again.

My only complaint, which I wanted to ask director Tykwer at the Chicago International Film Festival last year but did not get the chance, is why he has not filmed the second and third of the trilogy.

1438623,5,B00005JKN2,"This is a beautiful film that resonates in the consciousness.  The plot is interesting and unique, but on a certain level not overly complex.  What is complex is what it is trying to say and what the story says about life in general.  It is wonderfully acted and filmed.  It does keep your attention and move at a slow but moderate pace.  Ultimately, it is the story of how we react to a cynical and corrupt world.  Where is our place and what are we to do when there is so much moral compromise and look-the-other-way attitudes all around us.  I am a public school teacher and believe me, the system is basically rotten at its core.  Appearances are much more important than the not so pretty reality.  Numbers/statistics far more paramount than actual learning and development.

The beauty of this film is that it places both the main characters into such a moral dilemma.  How will they react to evil and corruption.  What will they choose as their place in this world.  Can they bite the bullet and accept such a decayed and putrid reality or will they just say no. Of course, just saying no is not easy and brings you square up against an entrenched bureaucracy and system which does not like to be questioned or exposed.  In the eternal fight of David vs. Goliath - who usually wins?  This film gives its answer and does so in a poetic and inspiring fashion.",1342483200,,1364,4.487804878048781

1438639,5,B00005JKN2,"I don't think I've ever been more pleasantly surprised than I was when I got done watching `Heaven'.  This film is so much more complex than one may imagine walking in, and it is definitely a film that gradually unveils itself in ways you least expect as the minutes tick on by.  It starts off marvelously and then continues at a steady yet seemingly expected pace (it doesn't really feel like anything more than an above average thriller) but as the final moments of the film come and go, we are left with this overwhelming feeling that we just witnessed something truly extraordinary.

This is the movie that gets better and better the more you think about it, so much so that the second time I saw this movie I was head over heals in love with it.

The film revolves around a schoolteacher who plants a bomb in the office of a drug dealer only to have that bomb miss its target and kill four innocent people.  Deeply affected by her own guilt, Philippa knows she must pay for her crimes, but not before the guilty party is properly punished.  Filippo (a remarkably moving Giovanni Ribisi) is a young policeman who is brought in to interpret for Philippa during her interigation with the Turin police.  He is instantly enamored by Philippa, feeling for her soul, and thus he vows to help her escape and carry out her objective.

From there we move into one of the most impeccably crafted and emotionally taxing thrillers I've ever seen.

The ethereal beauty of this film is matched by the intense emotional structure that permeates the films core, creating a fully realized story that transcends genre.  I have been a fan of Kieslowski's for some time now, and finding out that he was partially responsible for the script answers a lot of questions.  Twyker's brilliant direction is a perfect compliment to the depth of the script, adding layers of organic beauty to the scenes, allowing the audience to soak in the films powerful message or heaven and earth (and heaven on earth).

And speaking of organic...

Cate Blanchett is an actress who is always memorable, an actress that possesses a quality that sets her apart.  It is not wonder that she is considered one of the best of her generation, the next Meryl Streep as some have noted.  I have always enjoyed her and felt her potential, but I was never one who felt she was AS good as so many have insisted.  Then I saw this film, and her performance within it is one of the greatest I have ever seen, EVER.  The way she simply folds into character is extraordinary.  You feel her in ever scene completely dissecting her own emotional makeup.  You believe every move, every quiver of her skin as she wraps her head around her own situation.  It is a beautifully lived in performance that elevates the film because it is her performance that attaches itself to the emotional complexity of the script and affixes our attention on all that Kieslowski (and Twyker) are attempting to say.

She is simply amazing.

A film that is equal parts human and spiritual, `Heaven' creates a beautiful balance between the two; opening our eyes and allowing our souls to infiltrate those pearly gates in the most unexpected of ways.",1262563200,,3171,4.645161290322581
1438640,5,B00005JKN2,"One does not often see nearly perfect films but Heaven gets as close to perfection as any film I have ever seen. It is not easy.  It asks the viewer to empathize with a main character, played brilliantly by the luminous Cate Blanchett, who is guilty, in the opening scene, of a truly heinous act and then compels us to follow her as she commits another.  It succeeds in doing just that and then takes us with her on a journey towards love and redemption.  It is beautifully photographed and brilliantly directed by Tom Tykwer.  Giovanni Ribisi is pitch-perfect as Cate's counterpart/love interest and the instrument of her redemption.  The screenplay by Krzysztof Kieslowski and Krzysztof Piesiewicz is a thing of moral ambiguous beauty and the supporting cast is universally wonderful. I cannot recommend this little piece of cinematic genius highly enough.",1262563200,5,858,5.014084507042254
1438641,5,B00005JKN2,"German-born Tom Twyker, director of many successful films, is perhaps best known for 1998 classic, ""Lola Rennt"" (""Run Lola, Run"").

In ""Heaven"" Cate Blanchart is cast as Philippa, an English school teacher working in Turin, Italy. This film has both English and Italian parts (with subtitles), lending to it's authenticity.  Blanchart's male counterpart, Filippo, is played by Italian actor, Giovannis Riblisi.  He is cast as a 20 year old police department employee who becomes sympathetic to Philippa's cause, springs her from jail; and manages to outwit the police and run, ride and fly (!) to safety, in the mean time falling in love with her.

Philippe and Filippo, though from different cultures, become unified in fate, and seem to become two halves of the same whole. Through much of the film Blanchart and Riblisi appear together, both wearing white t-shirts and slim-fitting blue jeans. Later, Philippa is shaved bald, presumably to help her to evade capture by altering her appearance. No big surprise.  But then, the camera again shooting from above, reveals that Filippo is also shaved! Several scenes are shot in such a way that they appear to really belong together.

Which brings me to my initial point: Twyker's brilliant usage of mise-en-scene.  By that I mean that the set-up of the individual scenes --in addition to having visual style and beauty--convey meaning and information above and beyond what is seen in other types of cinamatography, plus the dialog itself.  I find this to be clever and artful.  Just by observing how the characters, props and scenery are set up, we see another level of meaning and understanding.  For example, how he sets up the scene in the barn as they eat together and then gaze at each other from either end of the film frame.  Well, this is not a thing that can easily be described in words; you just have to see the film!

Lastly, I love how the film ends, and how it ties together the beginning scene in a helicopter simulator and also the enigmatic name of the film, ""Heaven"".  Bravo!",1221868800,,2042,4.867052023121388

1438697,5,B00005JKN2,"What is true love? What would we do to keep it, once we find it? Is this what it is like to find a true soulmate? What is wrong and right if we seek redemption, but are dragged down by a lust for justice?

""Heaven"" has the advantage of being written by the late great Krzysztof Kieslowski and the director Tom Tykwer, so it's not surprising that the result is exquisite -- melancholy, dreamlike, and a beautiful meditation on love and guilt.

In Italy, young schoolteacher Phillipa Paccard (Cate Blanchett) sneaks into drug kingpin Vendice's office and plants a bomb in his trash, little knowing that the trash is about to be collected -- it kills the cleaning lady, a dad and two kids. Phillipa is arrested, aghast, because after the kingpin's drugs killed her hubby and students, she had to take justice into her own hands.

A young Italian cabinieri, Filippo (Giovanni Ribisi), serves as a translator for Phillipa, and he is struck by her self-recrimination and sorrow. When her evidence is destroyed by a spy in the police, Philipo creates an elaborate escape plan, then helps her kill Vendice. From there, they escape into Tuscany, where their bond grows deeper. The soul mates live in what seems like a paradise, shaving their heads and wearing identical clothes. But Tuscany is not heaven, and they are still not safe.

Tom Tykwer gave the film its focus (lovers in jeopardy) and unearthly direction, but Krzysztof Kieslowski provided the heart and soul of it. In that sense, it is wholly his movie. Themes of guilt and redemption, love and salvation, punishment and forgiveness run deep in ""Heaven."" Symbolism clings to it like ivy (the white shirts, the bright lights), and there are definite religious tones to it -- Phillipa's confession to Filipo in a church, the wistful watching of a wedding, and the ascension into the skies -- not the triumph of law, but the triumph of love and forgiveness.

The handling of Phillipa and Filippo is exquisite, such as the scenes where they shave their heads and wear identical clothes, run and walk in unison. What's more, their connection is far deeper -- his birthday, their names. The direction is otherworldly, even in violent scenes like the explosion, or Phillipa shooting Vendice. In the latter half of the film, this dreaminess pervades everything -- the trees, sky, ruined stone churches and the tiny running figures.

The main problems, it seems, would be the ocasional clash between Tykwer and the late Kieslowski's style. Some parts are more Tykwer, some are more Kieslowski, so it seems sometimes that the focus is less on the storyline and more on the lovers (which is more Tykwer). Additionally, when the lovers arrive in Tuscany the tone changes to a less hard-edged, more romantic one. Some viewers may find this disconcerting, but I found it a natural progression as the two grew closer and sought some kind of haven, even if Phillipa doesn't want to go unpunished.

Cate Blanchett is in amazing form here, expressing grief, love, pride, and anger with only a slight change of expression. Giovanni Ribisi is almost as good; he's a little stiff in the beginning, but loosens up and becomes fully believable as a very young man who is very deeply in love. Remo Girone appears in only a few scenes as Filipo's dad, but is heartbreakingly good.

With the best of Tykwer and Kieslowski carefully woven together --though not always in harmony -- ""Heaven"" is a quietly passionate, deeply romantic movie. An amazing, heartbreaking movie, and not one to be missed.",1177891200,2,3523,4.850249584026622

1438701,3,B00005JKN2,"I'm not sure how to begin here. Co-written as the first of a planned trilogy - originally Heaven, Hell, and Purgatory - by existentialist filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski (The Three Colours: Red, White, Blue, The Double Life of Veronique, the Decalogue), but filmed by director Tom Tykwer (Run Lola, Run) after Kieslowski's death, Heaven falters where it needs to soar.

The premise is soul-searching: a fed-up British schoolteacher named Philippa (Cate Blanchett), living and working in Italy, takes the law into her own hands after being ignored by the police, and plants a homemade bomb in the office wastebasket of an alleged drug dealer after the drug-related death of her husband. She places a final call to the police, identifying herself and directly claiming responsibility for the act. Unfortunately, unkown to Philippa, a custodian empties the wastebasket just before the bomb detonates, carrying the lot into an elevator occupied with a man and his two young children. The bomb explodes in the elevator, killing everyone inside, and the police - in cahoots with the drug dealer - arrest Philippa and charge her with four murders. Overcome with guilt, Philippa collapses during questioning, and the young official translator, Filippo (Giovanni Ribisi), who just happens to be the brother of one of Philippa's pupils, becomes infatuated with Philippa and decides to help her escape and kill the drug dealer.

In Kieslowski's hands this film could've been something special; a sincere meditation on a woman's guilt and responsibility in the aftermath of making a horrible decision. Tykwer, on the other hand, after the initial, intriguing set up, turns the rest of the film into a stupid, unsatisfying chase scene, until the couple are cornered at a farmhouse by an army of police and finally escape by comandeering a police helicopter and flying off, disappearing up into the sky.

Tykwer absolutely kills the film, smothering any life the actors try to bring to their characters. Blanchett succeeds early on, but can't overcome the lame last third of the underwritten script. Ribisi, in comparison, wanders around looking like a scared teenager, and everyone else is background filler. The best thing to recommend here is the cinematography - some of the visuals and images are absolutely amazing, especially in the last ten or fifteen minutes of the film.

Overall, I expected much, much more, and it's sad to wonder what the film could've been, if Kieslowski had lived to direct it.",1154217600,6,2493,5.163366336633663

It's a suspense film but not all that suspenseful, especially in light of today's bloody action scenes.

It has an ending that is not really an ending.

It's not listed (or categorized at rental stores) as a ""foreign film"" but much of the movie is spoken in Italian.

In other words, this is hard to label. Throw in an odd romance, some spectacular Tuscan scenery (actually wonderful cinematography all the way through), a slow-moving but involving storyline and one of this generation's most-interesting actresses (Cate Blanchett) and you have a film worth investigating.

A word of warning, especially to younger people: this film might be too slow for what you are used to seeing. If you want action, skip this. This film is more for people into visuals and a different story. Subtitles also turn off a lot of people, and you need them here.

As someone who just loves great visuals, this is an astonishing piece of work - just magnificent to view. I also appreciated the director's ""sky cam"" with some wonderful aerial shots.

In this film, he's a carabiniere that translates for Cate Blanchett, the (British) English teacher of Giovanni's brother.

The setting is Turin, or Torino as the 2006 Olympic Winter Games are officially titled. Cate Blanchett speaks excellent Italian.

It's a good movie, perhaps a great one, and Blanchett and Ribisi are both very good throughout. Blanchett's early distress at the news that her plans have gone awry is entirely convincing. Ribisi's character has the right mixture of naivete and cunning needed to attempt such an outlandish plan. The film is beautifully photographed; director Tom Tykwer has, if possible, adapted a more melancholic and meditative manner than Kieslowski himself had. In attempting the sublime, it several times verges on boring, but what keeps it from becoming so is a plot that is frankly unbelievable. Is this perhaps the point? Ultimately I'm not convinced there is enough to help us in our unbelief, but along the way there are a number of surprising camera shots which emphasize the fantastic nature of their daring enterprise.

1438723,5,B00005JKN2,"The brilliant director of ""Run Lola Run"" and ""The Princess and the Warrior"", Tom Tykwer, has directed another visually stunning, thought provoking and mystical film exploring the relationship of a man and a woman from different backgrounds who find each other and realize that a strong and potent connection exists between the two of them. As in ""The Princess and the Warrior,"" Tykwer combines the real and the surreal to dazzling effect.

The main characters, whose names are ""Phillipa"" and ""Fillipo"" represent opposite or opposing forces who finally become merged into one. ""Phillipa"" the female character, circumvents and subverts society's ineffectual system of laws by taking the law into her own hands, and plans to kill a drug dealer who is in cahoots with the the police. ""Fillipo"", the male character, is in direct contradistinction to Phillipa in that he is a member of the police system that Phillipa feels has failed her, her husband, and her students (she is a teacher). After she is captured, the two find a powerful spiritual connection that transforms and bonds them forever. The roles that were established for the characters blur as Fillipo breaks the laws his job symbolizes and helps Phillipa escape; and Phillipa, racked with guilt over the the inncoent deaths at her hands, is ready to submit to the very same laws that failed her and set all the events in motion. The film, as it progresses, reconciles these opposing forces, and the characters' identities and ideals literally (they begin to look alike) and symbollically (they begin to both believe that there is no real justice in the world) merge into one.

The film, in addition, grows more surreal as it progresses and the bond between the two is cemented both physically and spiritually. Some critics have expressed that the ending is disappointing in the way it leaves the moral aspects of the film unresolved (Phillipa escapes punishment for her crimes). I think they have missed the point in that the main focus of the film, as in most of Tykwer's films, is on the mystical connection of the characters. The last scene, a breathtaking piece of cinema, establishes this connection in a surreal way. Phillipa herself admits that she deserves punishment for her crimes, but in a world that makes no sense, where justice and law rarely live up to their ideals, their last escape makes perfect sense.",1113609600,3,2378,4.957393483709273

The storyline

Great acting of cate blanchett

good directing,

these were all good points in this movie

Well, but basicly this is what I was trying to say. I remember the start being pretty good, making room for a great story to be told.

I think urinating into one's pants as a reaction to fallen in love is very strange. It had some kind of esoteric touch to it. And it sure made it hard for me to take this dude or the movie serious.

When their heads were shaved, the visual humorous note to it was much stronger to me than the intensity that their situation was supposed to posess. Immigrants from mars trying to act out as humans on a not-standard love-story. Since this came close to my perception of this film i couldn't take it serious.

The subject of ""love"" was presented in a very different way that i see it. One thing is the difference of stature which is argueable but my opinion. Love is something that both parts have to work on. People may feel very attracted to each other when first seeing each other, but this is 10th grade high school stuff ""(s)he is soooo cute:)"" and at ribsis age should be identified as just that. Real love has its roots in true developed personality. Kate Blanchet's character was very much superior to ribsi's personality-wise.

By the way cate blanchett is one of the very few women who shaved head fits them better than with her,when she shaves her head she looks lke she's 19!!!",1093564800,,1456,4.443609022556391

1438729,4,B00005JKN2,"I think the strength of this film lies in its cross between a crime thriller and an arthouse-style love story. The pace is slow, but still flows along smoothly and doesn't drag down the sense of action. Heaven opens in a very modern, technological setting of helicopters, bombs, drugs and terrorists, yet manages to close perfectly at the end with a sense of 'a state of grace' that should not usually be found in an action flick. It's a perfect transition from thriller to something more than a love story.
Cate Blanchett and Giovanni Ribisi are outstanding in their acting. In looks and small gestures, they subtly convey the entire sense of their characters. The camera work is fantastic too, the most memorable scene being the one where the camera pans 360 degrees around the tree on Philippa's friend's farm, night turning to day turning to dusk again as the Philippa and Filippo wander underneath. The accompanying music score, though minimalistic and simple, suits the atmosphere perfectly with the strains of violin and piano chords.
The only lamentable flaw is in the film is that there is no resolution to Philippa's pain at having caused the death of 4 innocents. Early on she tells Filippo that she agreed to escape not because she wanted to escape punishment, and later she says she will never be able to live with what she has done. These seem to indicate that some form of 'punishment' is in order, but at the end of the film nothing more is said about that and we have to assume she has decided she can very well live happily ever after with Filippo, neglecting her guilt at having killed innocents in her quest for justice. Since the impact of the film is based Phillipa's moral decision to take justice into her own hands and the terrible consequences, it is an unforgivable oversight to so blithely ignore her guilt -even if she never intended for the bombing to go awry- in favour of love, no matter how beautiful or touching that love is.",1077580800,,1959,4.681159420289855

I can no longer remember why I had originally wanted to see this movie, only that it ended up on my ""to watch"" list for an extended period of time.  I finally got a chance to rent this and I was surprised and pleased to see that it is directed by Tom Twyker (Run Lola Run).  The fact that it stars Cate Blanchett is another plus.  The dialogue in this film is almost entirely spoken in Italian with a small amount of English spread throughout the movie.
At the beginning of the movie, Philippa (Cate Blanchett) plants a bomb in a man's office.  She makes sure that the other office workers are not in the area and then calls the police, telling them what she did and saying that they did not listen to her phone calls and her letters, and this is the result.  Unfortunately, as she is making the phone call, a member of the cleaning staff empties the wastebasket with the bomb and it subsequently explodes, killing four people, none of them the target.  Philippa is arrested and she breaks down when she learns that four innocents were killed.
Philippa tries to explain her intent and why she was trying to kill that particular man.  The Italian police do not believe her, and the proof she offers up disappears in the investigation.  A young police officer, Filippo (Giovanni Ribisi) takes pity on her and falls in love with Philippa.  Yes, it is that quick.  He decides to help her escape, and then help her continue on with her mission to kill the man who she feels needs killing.
As far as the story making sense and being believable, ""Heaven"" does not succeed in this way.  What ""Heaven"" does do a good job of is making me care about Philippa and what happens to her.  While the plot didn't make too much sense, the movie still drew me in and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  It has a much slower pace than Twyker's ""Run Lola Run"", but like ""Run Lola Run"" I enjoyed every minute of the movie...even those minutes that seemed out of place.  This is not a great movie, but it is a pretty good one.

Heaven's storyline never rises above the level of a sketch, and the revelations of its central characters' motives are superficial. Nevertheless, it hits psychological and emotional notes that will resonate for most viewers.
Cate Blanchett is Philippa, an Englishwoman who teaches in an unnamed Italian city (the exteriors were apparently shot in Turin). As we are introduced to her she is attempting to plant a bomb in the office of a powerful industrialist. What happens next results in her being jailed and interrogated by the Carabinieri (Italy's most hard-boiled police).
Fillippo (Giovanni Ribisi) - yes, the characters have the same name in the feminine and masculine forms - is a young policeman, perhaps in his first day on the job, who is serving as a scribe during the interrogation. When Philippa asks to be allowed to speak in her native English language, Fillippo bashfully offers to act as interpreter.
I won't describe what happens next, for fear of giving spoilers, except to say that Fillippo falls instantly for Philippa, seeing a lost and hurting soul in her, despite the beastly crime she is accused of. He helps her to escape from her cell in the building where the interrogation is being performed and goes on the run with her, throwing away his law-enforcement career almost before it has started.
Blanchett is, as usual, riveting. This fine actress isn't, thank goodness, content to rely on her ethereal beauty. She allows us to experience Philippa from the inside. Ribisi isn't in the same class, and the film at times feels unbalanced. Yet his is not a bad performance; it just lacks Blanchett's finesse. The supporting actors are well cast, particularly the one who plays Ribisi's father, a Carabinieri officer whose pride in his son's following in his footsteps is shattered.
The screenplay was co-authored by director Krzysztof Kieslowski, the critics' darling famed for his Red, Blue and White trilogy. I haven't seen any of his films, but on the basis of this script, I doubt that whatever merits those films can boast are owing to the dialogue.
I almost didn't rent this DVD when I saw that it was made by Tom Tykwer, who directed the popular but slipshod Run, Lola, Run. (What persuaded me to watch it was seeing Sidney Pollack and Anthony Minghella credited as producers.) It would seem that, having gotten Lola out of his system, Tykwer has calmed down. Once Philippa and Fillippo have escaped from the city, the film takes on an agreeably lyrical tone without abandoning the suspenseful undercurrents. Tykwer has even managed in places an expressive understatement that is far more involving than the tweaked-up kineticism of Run, Lola, Run.
There is, for instance, a beautiful scene in which the lovers wake up side by side in the room where they have hidden for the night just after Philippa's escape. He opens his eyes to look at her; she opens hers to gaze on him. No words are said. None are necessary.
Estonian composer Arvo Part's moody, reticent musical score is another plus. The slightly over-ripe cinematography is generally well transmitted by the DVD authoring, although there is a touch of pixel freezing and thawing in the static backgrounds.
The movie's last shot is unbelievable and aerodynamically impossible - but it's so memorable that it may haunt you long afterward.
Be sure to watch the first of the deleted scenes, which should have been left in. It clarifies the relationship between Fillippo and his father. (In fact, I recommend you watch it before the movie.) Did Tykwer really think that those extra two minutes would send his audience into spasms of boredom?",1068854400,5,3721,4.964743589743589

1438765,4,B00005JKN2,"HEAVEN opens to the unrolling, virtual landscape as ""seen"" in a helicopter flight simulator with the voice-over of the trainer and trainee as the latter navigates the computer-generated topography close to the ""ground"". The sequence ends as the student pilot climbs his ""craft"" higher, and higher, and higher until the instructor terminates the session with the caution that one can't keep climbing forever, and turns off the visual display. The last words come from the trainee on a darkened screen in the form of a question. The sequence doesn't make much sense at the moment, but does hint that there's perhaps more to the upcoming plot than the obvious.
Cate Blanchett is Philippa, a British-born English teacher in Turin, Italy, who's lost her husband and at least one student to the ravages of illegal drugs. The narcotics' source, a powerful business executive, is known to the tutor. Not having gotten any help from the police after repeated entreaties, Philippa plants a bomb in the waste can of the dealer's high rise office, and then calls the authorities to take responsibility for the imminent assassination. Unfortunately, the trash is emptied by a cleaning lady before it detonates, and she and three other innocents are ultimately killed in the blast. Philippa is arrested as a terrorist and interrogated, during which time the young police translator, a raw recruit named Filippo (Giovanni Ribisi), falls in love with her and engineers her escape. Philippa declares she has no wish to avoid responsibility for her deadly mistake, but needs the opportunity to balance the scales by finishing the rough justice she intended.
It's a good thing that the director had in mind something more profound than the face-value of the storyline because the latter is occasionally wildly improbable or leaves questions unanswered. If Philippa was the only occupant of her cell, why did the police bug it? How could Filippo, basically just a kid, have the informed smarts to pull off a sophisticated jail break? (The fact that his Dad used to be the local head of the carabinieri isn't enough.) Where did Philippa learn how to construct a bomb? (Her explanation that it was just left in her apartment doesn't cut it, especially since the audience sees her making it.) At the finale, how did the storm troopers and the police helicopter know where to go?
I consider Cate Blanchett to be one of the finest actresses in the business. She doesn't just act a role, she becomes the character. At one point in HEAVEN, her tresses are shorn down to stubble on-screen. How many actors today would have such dedication to a role to do that?
The film is stylishly photographed. The perspective is often above the action, as when the camera is shooting straight down as it passes high across Turin's streetscape, as if the director wants to make the point that the film's message is above the mundane cares of the human ants below. And what is that message? Without sounding to corny, perhaps it's that the sublime event of a lifetime must be grasped at any cost, even if it leads to morally ambiguous actions. The similarity of the names ""Philippa"" and ""Filippo"" isn't accidental.
The film's conclusion is perhaps too symbolic. It's unsatisfying in that it skirts the issue of ownership of one's actions, something which Philippa made clear early on she was willing to assume. There's no Bonnie and Clyde denouement here. However, the final screen shot does tie in with the question posed at the end of the opening sequence. HEAVEN.",1066003200,,3523,4.9326599326599325

1438767,5,B00005JKN2,"What is true love? What would we do to keep it, once we find it? Is this what it is like to find a true soulmate? What is wrong and right if we seek redemption, but are dragged down by a lust for justice? The quietly beautiful ""Heaven"" will leave those thoughts in your head as you watch it.
In Italy, young schoolteacher Phillipa Paccard (Cate Blanchett) sneaks into drug kingpin Vendice's office and plants a bomb in his trash, little knowing that the trash is about to be collected by the cleaning lady. The resulting explosion kills the lady, a father and his two children. When Phillipa is arrested and told this, she is aghast. She only intended to kill the kingpin, because his distribution of drugs has been killing her pupils, and killed her husband. She has asked the cabinieri to help, but no one has answered. So she took justice into her own hands.
A young Italian cabinieri, Filippo (Giovanni Ribisi), serves as a translator for Phillipa, and he is struck by her self-recrimination and sorrow. When her evidence is destroyed by a spy in the police, Philipo creates an elaborate escape plan, then helps her kill Vendice. From there, they escape into Tuscany, where their bond grows deeper. The soul mates live in what seems like a paradise, shaving their heads and wearing identical clothes. But Tuscany is not heaven, and they are still not safe.
Tom Tykwer gave the film its focus (lovers in jeopardy) and unearthly direction, but Krzysztof Kieslowski provided the heart and soul of it. In that sense, it is wholly his movie. Themes of guilt and redemption, love and salvation, punishment and forgiveness run deep in ""Heaven."" Symbolism clings to it like ivy (the white shirts, the bright lights), and there are definite religious tones to it -- Phillipa's confession to Filipo in a church, the wistful watching of a wedding, and the ascension into the skies -- not the triumph of law, but the triumph of love and forgiveness.
The handling of Phillipa and Filippo is exquisite, such as the scenes where they shave their heads and wear identical clothes, run and walk in unison. He was born on the day of her first communion, and their names are male and female versions of each other's, yin and yang. Not exactly subtle, but convincing. The direction is otherworldly, even in scenes like Phillipa shooting Vendice. In the latter half of the film, this dreaminess pervades everything -- the trees, sky, ruined stone churches and the tiny running figures.
The main problems, it seems, would be the ocasional clash between Tykwer and the late Kieslowski's style. Some parts are more Tykwer, some are more Kieslowski, so it seems sometimes that the focus is less on the storyline and more on the lovers (which is more Tykwer). Additionally, when the lovers arrive in Tuscany the tone changes to a less hard-edged, more romantic one. Some viewers may find this disconcerting, but I found it a natural progression as the two grew closer and sought some kind of haven, even if Phillipa doesn't want to go unpunished.
Cate Blanchett is in amazing form here, expressing grief, love, pride, and anger with only a slight change of expression. Giovanni Ribisi is almost as good; he's a little stiff in the beginning, but loosens up and becomes fully believable as a very young man who is very deeply in love. Remo Girone appears in only a few scenes as Filipo's dad, but is heartbreakingly good.
With the best of Tykwer and Kieslowski carefully woven together, ""Heaven"" is a quietly passionate, deeply romantic movie. An amazing, heartbreaking movie, and not one to be missed.",1063065600,12,3579,4.792880258899676

1438769,3,B00005JKN2,"Phillipa Paccard (Kate Blanchett) is an Englishwoman living in Italy. Her husband has died of a drug overdose, as have some of the students to whom she teaches English. Phillipa knows the identity of the drug kingpin who supplied them and wants the police to take action. But when her repeated phone calls and letters to the police get no response, she decides to take matters into her own hands. She plants a bomb in the office of the man she knows to be the city's major source of drugs. She is arrested and accused of being a terrorist, and a corrupt police captain covers all evidence of her past communication with the police. But Filippo (Giovanni Ribisi), the young police officer assigned as her translator throughout her interrogation, falls in love with Phillipa. He helps her escape police custody but finds that, once free, she only wants to finish the task she set out to do. Phillipa and Filippo escape to the Italian countryside. While eluding the massive manhunt that has been organized to find them, the couple find love and new reasons to live.

Giovanni Ribisi and Kate Blanchett are both terrific actors, and Kate Blanchett is particularly good in ""Heaven"". I really liked the first half of this movie. Phillipa's desperation and determination and the police force's confusion in the presence of a criminal who doesn't act like they expect her to made me curious to see how it would all turn out. The problem is that the way things turn out in the second half of the movie doesn't seem to follow the first half. The themes, the tone, and even the style of ""Heaven'""s second half are so totally different from the film's first half that it seems like we are watching two movies, the first of which is never resolved satisfactorily. It is not so much that the film's second half is bad as that the second half seems like it should be part of a different movie. I suspect that ""Heaven""'s writer and director were trying to avoid a cliche thriller resolution to the plot line of the first half, and so moved the movie to the countryside and in the opposite direction of a typical thriller ending. It just doesn't work. The ideas of ""Heaven""'s first half seem not to go anywhere, and its second half seems superfluous.

1438793,4,B00005JKN2,"How can a sinner go to heaven? Tom Tykwer working from a script by the late Krzysztof Kieslowski (BLUE, WHITE, RED) and his writing partner Krzysztof Piesiewicz posits through acknowledgement of the sin and confession in HEAVEN.
Cate Blanchett is stunning, and filled with a deadly, single-minded purpose as Philippa, a woman seeking justice against a drug dealer who was responsible for the death of her husband and many others. When her explosive plan goes horribly wrong, she is horrified by her actions, yet still bent on her mission. However she is incarcerated by the Italian police for the crime, and only through the intervention by the officer translating named Filippo (Giovanni Ribisi) can she continue.
The first half of the film is superior than the latter half, but I enjoyed HEAVEN quite a bit. Working with the themes of
love and destiny as in his earlier films (THE PRINCESS AND THE WARRIOR and RUN, LOLA, RUN) HEAVEN also brings in some of the Christian notions of absolution and confession. The ending, while strongly symbolic, still manages to be breath-taking and powerful. I was less convinced of the Adam & Eve symbolism in the film's penultimate moments.
As a fan of Tykwer's work, I always feel as I've enjoyed a thoroughly cinematic work after witnessing one of his films. Tykwer and his cinematographer, Frank Griebe (Chlotrudis winner for LOLA) construct a beautiful film, with swooping crane and stunning aerial shots. The crowded Italian city, and expansive Italian countryside are wonderfully shot.  Tykwer also uses sound and music effectively to convey his mood.
I was trying to delve into the whole ""twin"" aspect of the two characters, who share a name, a birthday, and halfway through the film, a look. With Filippo being born on the day Philippa received her first holy communion, it's possible that he is her spiritual self, offerring her a chance for redemption.
In any event, HEAVEN is a strong film, with lots to think about. I can only wonder what Kieslowski's unmade trilogy (HEAVEN, HELL and PURGATORY) would have come to.",1057276800,,2065,4.9855072463768115
1438794,5,B00005JKN2,"HEAVEN is another of those films that came and went in the theaters without much notice.  Perhaps it is because the dialogue of the film is predominantly in Italian and the film was not advertised as an art/foreign film.  No matter. Now that the DVD is available this little treasure is better savored in the intimacy of the home than the huge theater.
Whenever actors of the substance of Cate Blanchette and Giovanni Ribisi pledge their support to a script, the viewer can rest assured that the script is a fine one.  This script (Krzsztof Kieslowski) is no exception.  The direction (Tom Tykwer) is sensitive, tender, human, and maintains tension while inserting  gentle reprieves of interpersonal moments.  Using a fascinting opening sequence of a simulated helicopter flight (for Ribisi, a young policeman) Tykwer suggests that the warning given Ribisi that he is not to fly to high or he will just reach heaven sets the tenor for this film.  Blanchette (Philippa - and Enlish teacher in Turin, Italy) is a driven woman, plotting a bomb to destroy an Italian businessman/drug king because her warnings to the police have resulted in nothing.  Her bomb is mistakenly misplaced by a cleaning woman and results in the death of four innocent people.  When arrested, Blanchette discovers the fumble and is devastated.  At this point she decides to give testimony only in her native language of English (all dialogue is Italian up to now) and the young Ribisi happens to be bilingual and serves as her translator. He slowly comes out of his shy shell as a person and falls in love with Blanchette, helping her escape and eventually flies away with her in a helicopter that ascends and ascends........  Along the way we meet all manner of Italians, each treated as a supporting character of importance.  The story is simple but opens doors to universal truths and shouts strongly for the importance of faith and belief in interpersonal relationships.

1438795,4,B00005JKN2,"Cate Blanchett has shown her enormous talent in this film as Philippa, English teacher who is arrested for murder in Italy.  In more than one sense, however, this is a difficult role, for she finds herself in a strange position -- she is loved by an Italian cadet at Carabinieri (The National Guard), Filippo (played by Giovanni Ribisi).
The film starts like a well-crafted crime thriller.  Philippa sets an explosive device in an office, but her plan to kill the target misfires, killing innocent people.  After being arrested as a terrorist, she learns it, and collapses.
One guy was watching it; a rookie guard Filippa.  Helping her, he falls in love with her, and decides to save her no matter what it takes.  But you will learn soon, like these two characters -- save from what?
The first half of ""Heaven"" is just rivetting, tightly constructed with skillful editing.  The acting is always convincing, even while they speak in Italian (Ribisi's character is an Italain, a brave step, indeed), and the cold, artificial look of the city of Turin (northern Italain city) has a curious quality of beauty.
As other reviewers say, the second half is rather weak, being a little allegorical.  Philippa and Filippo, it is suggested, know their fate, and are ready to accept it.  The way the film describes it, however, is too slow and predictable for some viewers even though the film does not lose its beauty all through the story.  Let me say only this; the latter half, set in the beautiful scenery of warm country of Tuscany, is slightly disappointing for all its beauty and thought-provoking finale.
It might be surprising to see director Tom Tykwer, famous for ""Run Lola Run,"" can make this poetic film with measured pace.  But he did it, it is true, and for those fans of Ms. Blanchett whose works should not be missed, it is another gift sent from ""Heaven"" ... literally.
The script has a unique history of its own; it is part of trilogy written by two men from Poland, late Krzysztof Kielowski and Krzysztof Piesiewicz, writers duo for director Kielowski's ""Three Colors Trilogy"" and ""La Double vie de Veronique.""

Cate Blanchett is Phillipa, a british living in Torino giving english classes. Her husband and several of her students suffer (or have already died) from drug abbuse, and even if she insistently warns the authorities against the italian city's druglord, nothing is done. Taking the matter in her own hands, Phillipa manages to get a bomb into the traffic-dealer's office, but something goes wrong and instead she kills four innocent people. Arrested, the only help she will get is from newtimer caribiniero Fillipo, magistraly performed by Giovanni Ribisi (speaking in italian). Fillipo will escape with her into the italian countryside, and there they will discover if indeed there's redemption for their sins and if they will find their way to heaven.
German director Tikwer was able to create a beautiful movie. The  first half seems more like ""Run Lola run"", full of twists, action and sudden happenings. The second half is more spiritual, more visual and more thought-provoking. Some of the shots are incredibly beautiful, and the cinematography is one of the best I've seen lately. Even the actors go through amazing visual and symbolic transformations. To fully understand the movie, the viewer must pay attention and understand not only the characters actions, but their clothes, lines and other subtle things as well, all along with the incredible italian background.

The haunting pilot training sequence is a wonderful opener, and the quick segue into a dramatically miscalculated assassination sets a gripping pace. Director Tom Tykwer is perhaps more at home with such suspenseful sequences, because once the characters become more important than the plot, his touch wanes. Still, the romantic aspects of his earlier films were nicely handled, so it may well be an issue of casting. While Cate Blanchett and Giovanni Ribisi give great performances and are individually quite convincing, the romance between them is rarely credible. It runs more cold than hot, so this comes dangerously close to playing as a tale of love-exploited rather than love-as-redeemer. As is inevitably the case with posthumously produced material, you can't help wondering what the original director might have made of it - and I can't help thinking that in Krzysztof Kieslowski's hands it would have been a better film. His peerless skill with colour, mood, music and symbolism - and his ability to extract performances relying on silence more than dialogue - might have elevated this from a good film to a truly great one.

1438801,5,B00005JKN2,"What is heaven?  More importantly, how do we, as imperfect people, transcend our daily limitations and transgressions to reach heaven - be it here on Earth or elsewhere?  The master Polish filmmaker Krzysztof Kieslowski, who wrote the screenplay for ""Heaven"" shortly before his death in 1996, uses the film's story and dialogue as a final opportunity to expand the core humanist philosophy that underlies nearly all of his films (""Decalogue"", ""Trois Couleurs"", ""Double Life of Veronique"".)
Philippa, played by Cate Blanchett, is a widowed English teacher living in Turin.  Disillusioned from the mounting death toll that drug abuse has claimed on several of her young students and her recently deceased husband, Phillippa executes a desperate plan to kill Turin's drug kingpin, Vendice, by deposting a bomb in his office trashbin.  When the bomb is unknowingly intercepted by a cleaning woman on her daily rounds and taken to an elevator transporting a father and his two daughters, Philippa's plan goes horribly wrong.  She has unwittingly killed 4 innocent people.  Philippa is arrested and interrogated by the Turin police, who accuse her of politically motivated terrorism as a way of masking their professional involvement with Vendice, the kingpin.  Philippa readily acknowledges her guilt, only to have a complete breakdown upon learning of the innocent bystanders who lost their lives in her vengeful plot.  Her interpreter during the interrogation, handsome Filippo (Giovanni Ribisi), is moved by Philippa's story, quickly falls in love with her, and ultimately hatches a plan to help her escape from the carabinieri, who see her as a problem to be ""eliminated"", because of her knowledge of Vendice's operations.  Philippa herself is less concerned with escape than with killing Vendice, once and for all.
Once Philippa and Filippo do escape into the Tuscan countryside (in a very deftly directed and edited sequence), you know that justice will eventually extract its due punishment.  And while the last third of the movie quietly builds on this sense of dread,  ""Heaven"" is no ""Bonnie and Clyde"" or ""Thelma and Louise""; Kieslowski is more concerned with Philippa's redemption and transcendence; and so the final scenes employ a sublime poetic imagery (and a meditative pace) to reveal Phillippa's transformation.  In a Tuscan church, not 20 feet from a confessional booth, Phillippa recounts for Filippo her many transgressions and failings, then reveals why: ""I've lost any belief - in justice, in sense, in life.""  Filippo's response?  ""I love you.""  Later, in a clandestine meeting between the pair and Filippo's father, Philippa acknowledges that, despite all her cynicism and failings, she does indeed love Filippo.  Director Tom Twyker perfectly captures, in this scene, the innocence and renewal at the core of Phillippa's declaration - as close to a marriage vow as the couple will get.  By this time, Philippa and Filippo have assumed a hypnotic Adam and Eve persona, shaving their heads and dressing alike, and finally disrobing at sunset on the Tuscan hills to consummate their love.  (Several moviegoers in my theatre gasped at the striking beauty and imagery of the scene).
When the carabinieri finally close in on them, Kieslowski suggests that the physical aspect of their fate (whether they are captured and killed) is less important than their spiritual fate (their complete redemption and transcendence).  But Kieslowski and Twyker balance the competing demands for physical and spiritual resolution by leaving us with a stunning closing scene that implies both.  (Some critics didn't understand this, but oh well.)
And so Kieslowski reiterates his core philosophy:  That chance and fate are often better instruments of justice than mankind itself, that goodness and evil exist in each of us, and that even the most flawed among us can achieve transcendence, through contrition and love for one another.  In a world of escalating terrorism and global wars, the ever-prescient Kieslowski is already sorely missed.",1035244800,108,4041,5.320754716981132
1438802,3,B00005JKN2,"I'm not sure.  I like Tom Tykwer's work, Winter Sleepers, Run Lola Run, The Princess and the Warrior, I would recommend them all, but I'm not sure this is his kind of film.  Much like Spielberg rescued A.I. after Kubrick passed away, Tykwer took on this project after famed director Krzysztof Kieslowski (The Decalogue, Red, White, Blue) died.  And like Spielberg, I think Tykwer was over his head.  Now I'm not saying this film is bad, on the contrary, I thought it was good, but flawed.
Cate Blanchett plays an English woman teaching in Italy who decides after seeing her husband and several students die from drug addiction she is going to take out the drug dealer.  She plants a bomb in his office, but a cleaning lady removes it and consequently four innocent people are killed.  She confesses to the crime, but she does not know the outcome of her attack.  Giovanni Ribisi comes in as an interpreter and decides to help her.
This is thoughtful film, as Kieslowski's films are.  The characters are similar, their names are similar, eventually they look similar, and they are both fighting for similar causes.  They try to do right by doing wrong.  Blanchett never claims she is innocent, and she is devastated by what she has done.  She just wants closure.  She wants to do the right thing.  Tykwer handles this well.  Additionally, like all of Tykwer's films, it is beautifully shot.
This was all good, but it didn't play out.  For several reasons I guess.  The pacing was off.  Where Lola was the hare, Heaven is the tortoise, although in this comparison the hare wins.  What I mean by this is that Heaven is not the kind of story that brings out the best of Tykwer's talents.  Ribisi and Blanchett are both quite good, especially Blanchett, but their characters sort of run out of gas by the end of the film.  I'm not really sure who to point a finger at for this so I won't.
There is some good stuff in Heaven.  It is a sad film, not really my taste, but it is sincere.  A good outing, but not everything it could have been.  Who knows?",1035072000,6,2045,4.512261580381471

7938992,4,B00005JKN2,"This is a nice Italian movie with two best known for American films/TV actors in the lead roles with Giovanni Ribisi and Cate Blanchett.  Italian is spoken by both actors (with English subtitles) as well as English, since Blanchett plays Phillipa, an English teacher who confessed to the bombing inside a building and demands to do so in her native language, and Ribisi translates for the record and other Italian police in the room.  Phillipa intended to kill just one person with her bomb, and initially believes this is what she has confessed to, only to learn not only did she completely miss killing that person, but four innocent people, including two young girls were killed when her bomb exploded.  The police aren't interested in these lies as they either believe them to be, or don't want them to be believed if they are corrupt, but Ribisi's character Filllipo, does, and is also very attracted to the blonde haired bomber.  He's prepared to help her escape, if she's willing.  But perhaps she has ideas of her own.

It's a fairly decent movie, you've got to remember the opening scenes to understand what happens at the very end. You've also got to old enough to remember the old joke of heaps of kids looking like the milkman to appreciate a scene. The film doesn't entirely gel smoothly, for example (spoilers obviously) on the floor she plants the bomb we see through the open door the father and his daughters walk behind her in the hallway, they then go up in a lift, yet the cleaning lady who has just emptied the bin with 40 seconds on the convenient digital clock (why you'd have this to prompt your victim noticing it in the bin to run is anyone's guess) somehow later enters the lift on the same floor as them, when they should be higher up. Perhaps there's a deleted scene where they forgot a wallet or something in the car and came back, but the way it is doesn't make a great deal of sense.  It is also unlikely you would be able to board a train in a major city when train stations you'd imagine would be on alert for you.  Apparently medical training in Italy for people who faint is to slap hard their unconscious face.

But the film is what it is, and is ultimately quite a satisfying watch.  In real life of course someone who murders four people, especially two little girls, you'd feel no sympathy for at all, but it's a movie.",1497916800,,2359,4.516431924882629
