Loved, loved , loved, Kimber....wow.  Great music, and while shot in Long beach posing as Miami, what a wonderfully twisted show.

I even had a name plate of Christian Troy made for a Halloween Costume and wore it with scrubs. There was a meet and greet with the stars at Hollywood and Highland. Fun.",1428451200,,465,4.458823529411765

3756454,5,B001PQZYQI,"What more can be said for illicit sex and needless surgery you ask? ""MORE!""  According to my 75-year-old neighbor who can't see a thing (practically) ... the sex is hot and the surgery is very life-like ... she was an ER nurse for 25 years.  However, my guess is, in real life, she never came across any of the scenarios shown in the movie, although at times I was beginning to wonder. We've watched 6 seasons in 4 weeks ... so I can't keep them all straight. But, I do not agree with others who say that it went downhill after season 2 or 3. We're at season 6, and we haven't found an episode that hasn't captivated us, at all.

Warning: If you are offended by lurid sex scenes (or surgery, for that matter), you might want to do what I do. I keep a crossword puzzle going at all times. That way, she can enjoy, I can listen, but I don't have to watch.",1384473600,,853,4.126506024096385

3756475,5,B001PQZYQI,"Season Five Part 2, is exactly what one would have begun the whole series with in the first place. It is over the top as always, but not stupid as Sean recovers from being stabbed by an overzealous fan.

It brings back that feeling of being at the edge of your seat that was sort of lost in Season Four. As the world's most vain man, Christian Troy, has to deal with the prospect of breast cancer, Nip/Tuck really breathes life back into their creation.

This is probably the last season one would want to look at in the entire 6 season series. Its an amazing one. THIS is their climax.",1297036800,,586,4.27027027027027

3756480,2,B001PQZYQI,"From the very first episode, 'nip/tuck' has thrived on its outlandish plotlines, hyperstylized sets and quirky/unique/deeply flawed characters which set it apart from anything else of television.  For the first four years, the series focused upon the married couple Julia and Sean McNamara and their womanizing life-long friend Christan and the medical practice that Sean and Christan ran in Florida.

But in season 5 the producers decided to spice things up and moved the series to Los Angeles, CA.  And in the beginning the fifth season of 'nip/tuck' (while obvious getting worn down with age) still had a shadow of the original series.  But by the time these DVDs come into play (the final 9 episodes of the season) the show is a relic of it's former self.  Boring, banal, too quirky, and sometimes just downright awfully mean.  In a matter of minutes characters that I had enjoyed watching for nearly 5 years filled me with nothing but disdain, contempt and revulsion.  Do yourself a favor and once you've finished season four, just skip to the last two episodes of the series.",1267488000,2,1081,4.906593406593407

3756488,5,B001PQZYQI,"Yes, there are only 8 episodes but, they are great episodes. A lot of the reviewers rated this 1 star for the price and not the actual content of the dvd. Nip/Tuck is still as good as ever and it shows it has some of the best music around in the 5.2 opener. I've never seen a more perfect song to fit a scene than the opener of 5.2. Over all these last 8 episodes are 10/10. Nip/Tuck continues to shock and awe you.",1259712000,7,415,3.9523809523809526
3756489,5,B001PQZYQI,"Mild spoilers.

yeah, I will admit to paying $17.99 here--that's the lowest price I could find--for this second half of season 5 of the most outrageous and steamy show in years.  What the heck--I love it.  I just can't get enough of it.  The move to L.A. has brought on more wacky patients, more emotional strife, a scare for everyone when a major character is stricken with cancer, more good songs on the soundtrack, the entrance of Katee Sackhoff as a dangerous new attraction for Sean, and a fascinating twist involving Liz and Christian.

I don't have cable, so the wait for season 6 is going to be a long one!",1259452800,,614,4.495495495495495

Dylan Walsh's characters recovery after losing all that blood is a bit far fetch; and his wheel chair addiction seem too irrational for him. Julian McMahon is getting a bit on to be exposing so much skin, beside we've seen it too often.

3756492,5,B001PQZYQI,This season sures takes strange twists. Each episode is guaranteed to keep you on the edge of your seat.

3756494,3,B001PQZYQI,"Part 2 of Nip/Tuck season Five is only sightly better (less chaotic, and not as stupid) than Part 1 (which i would rate 2/5). It is quite sad how far this show has fallen. If you are a hardcore fan of the show, pick this set up, if not, leave it alone.",1255824000,3,252,3.8653846153846154
3756495,4,B001PQZYQI,"I'm only giving my review 4 stars because I hate it when a publisher decides to make one season two different sets of DVD's.  Oh well, I still get my dose of Nip/Tuck and I am happy about that.

I have watched all the seasons, and I bought them as a 1-4 set and watched them all in succession as I was healing from a surgery (how appropriate) :)

I like this show, so many twists and turns and Season 5 is absolutely no different.  Be prepared though for a lot of sub-plots.  A great show but you won't want to miss an episode so you can keep track.  I love it.  I love how frenetic and crazy it can be.  It's nice to have one show in the arsenal that can take you on a good emotional roller coaster ride.

I am looking forward to getting the second part of Season 5.

To the Season 5, Part 1 defense -- the set contains 5 DVD discs with some bonus features.

Enjoy!",1254787200,7,866,3.9767441860465116

It still has that combination of the surgery, the drama it brings and the drama in their personal lives. In my opinion, it hasn't lost what makes it a great show and hasn't gotten cheesy or boring!  Which leaves it all in all, very interesting and worth watching.",1252972800,2,429,4.3625
3756497,2,B001PQZYQI,"I'm here not to complain about price, but the quality of the show.  Season five was a mixed bag of inane story lines, many stretches of story and plot were it just came of as ""No they didn't do that...how dumb!!""  This season suffered way more than a lot of other crazy/zany/impossible sort of Nip Tuck-esque storylines.  Season 5 of Nip Tuck wasn't that great.  Too many topics were a reach....a big time reach that made the show unwatchable at times.  Stick to seasons 1-3 and perhaps some of #4 if you want classic, original, Nip Tuck.

So Amy, you are not a triple threat but a no-threat.  This season is the worst out of all of them!!!  Your review is bad.  Bad bad bad!",1251676800,8,675,4.336
3756498,1,B001PQZYQI,"This show and many others (Fringe, Warehouse 13, Leverage, Dark Blue, Battlestar Galactia, Sons of Anarchy, Sanctuary etc, etc) are all starting to make half-season (approx 13 episodes or less) for the full season (approx. 24 - 26 episodes). A season, USED to be 24-26 episodes. NOW, they are becoming 12-13 episodes for the SAME price. The economy is bad, I know, but to do this to your loyal fans is not fair, I think. I will be TIVOing and saving to computer and USB hard drive. A lot cheaper and better for me.

Sorry, but all these shows and TV stations and DVD makers are robbing me and I will not be blind to it anymore.

I thought Battlestar Galactia season 2 was a fluke, but they did it again in season 5. Now, more shows are doing the same, they have got on that same old bandwagon!!!

3756499,4,B001PQZYQI,"My two favorite plastic surgeons are now in Los Angeles and getting into as much hot water as ever. Julian dominates the last half of season five because he is very ill.  This illness forces him to make choices both personally and professionally that he would have rather avoided making for the rest of his life. Liz figures prominently in these choices, especially since Julian wants to fully provide for Wilbur. There is an absolutely hilarious event which occurs when Julian hires another plastic surgeon to come on board to help Sean as his condition worsens.  Both Julian and Sean catch this guy making love to their FURNITURE and Julian is just outraged.  How dare this guy come in and ravish his.....sofa!  Sean's love life continues to ricochet with bizarre choices while he never really seems to move beyond Julia. He also continues to explore his life in tv now that he is needed in LA LA land for series tv. There are some fascinating plastic surgery cases too, as per usual. The final few episodes though have you hanging on every moment as to what will happen to Julian as you are afraid he is about to be lost forever to Nip n Tuck.  This is well worth watching but one does not need to own it.  I cannot envision going back to watch this again and again.  One time through is great rollicking fun.

3756500,5,B001PQZYQI,"The only reason everyone rated this one star is because they are whining about the price that Amazon is selling it for, based on the other reviews here. If people who post reviews here had any brains at all, they would use those tiny brains to rate the content of the season AND NOT THE PRICE AMAZON CHOOSES TO SELL IT FOR! While I admit that the second part of Season 5 isn't as great as the first, it does have some phenomenal acting from the sexy Mr. Julian McMahon. Some Emmy worthy acting, and aside from the annoying character of Teddy, they still manage to deliver some great episodes. I just wish I didn't have to watch Christian all sad because of his breast cancer scare, but I assure, by the end of it, you will NOT be disappointed!

So don't listen to the whiny babies on here dramatizing about the price. They DON'T know how to give a PROPER REVIEW with relevant content! And if you're Julian McMahon's #1, you know damn well that you can't put a price on him. I'd spend however much it costs just to own something with him in it.

3756502,5,B001PQZYQI,"i'm addicted to nip/tuck and do not wish to be cured. i am suffering withdrawal something fierce. i pre-ordered S5Pt2 in may 2009 and am still waiting for the distributor to provide a release date. So, as of this date, my rating is based purely on my satisfaction with the DVDs in my collection of seasons 1-5pt1. Since the FX network has announced the show's 6th season will air in october [no specific date yet] i'm hoping i won't have to wait too much longer for the S5Pt2 DVD. Reading other's reviews i notice their main beef seems to be with the item's price, and not so much the product it's self. To that i say, there must be something about the show that you found entertaining enough to place the order, so quit whining about how much it costs---no one forced you to make the purchase [and if i'm wrong about that, you've got bigger problems than the cost of a DVD]. Besides which there are ways around shelling out the $40plus---i purchased mine using my mypoints points, and it didn't cost me a cent ;-). Sometimes you can have your cake and eat it too [if you know which utensil to use]:-)",1247616000,7,1101,4.401960784313726
3756503,1,B001PQZYQI,"I agreed with all reviews here. Common I like the show, even the season 5 is not the greatest, because is all the same, at the end of the 5.1 dvd's gets better, but... the writers are not that smart making improvement to the show.. I mean... we go back and forward in the all 5 seasons referring to the same issues about their relationships, no one there as grow up as human experiences, ALL THE SAME. Hope as part of season 5, in 5.2 the prices goes to $ 5.99 up to $ 9.99 for 8 episodes.",1247443200,6,489,4.0
3756504,1,B001PQZYQI,"I am amazed that the marketing team thinks that this is a fair price for the last 8 episodes of Season 5!! At this rate, will the price for Season 6 be over 150.00?!?!?! Yikes! I will NOT buy at this price, it can sit on the shelf!",1244332800,5,231,3.8333333333333335
3756505,1,B001PQZYQI,"I must admit, I am a huge fan of the series and own all seasons, except for season 5 - part 2.  I was absoultely shell-shocked when I saw that the listing price for the eight (8) episodes is nearly $40. Even as one of the shows biggest fans, I just can't bring myself to pay that amount to complete my collection.  In this economy, I'm sure many share the same sentiment, so good luck selling this one FOX Video.  I'll be picking it up on the clearance rack, as I can imagine it won't be taking up valuable shelving space for long at that price, with no one buying it.",1242518400,20,568,4.099099099099099
3756506,1,B001PQZYQI,"LOVE the series, but will NOT be buying this installment unless the price is dropped to between $15-20 max.  The first season was only $18.98 brand new at WalMart, which is what got me hooked on the series in the first place.  That wasn't a full season, either....but was fairly priced and I had heard good things about the show, so I bought it.  For this to only be 8 episodes, the price needs to be more fair, especially since past seasons' DVDs have been woefully lacking in the ""bonus"" material department.  They'd have to add TONS of bonus features to this one to make it worth the price of a full regular season of any other TV show....but even then, I doubt I'd pay this much ($38.99) for it.  I'll Netflix it instead.",1241481600,18,725,4.380597014925373
