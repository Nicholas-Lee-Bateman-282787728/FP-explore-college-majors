8485476,5,B005STD8EI,"The Problem:
1. Excellent and spot on observation of what has happened in the last 70 years (the growth of debt).
2. Accurate observation that we are now in a deleveraging period (lasting 10 years, that means the deleveraging will finish in the year 2016!).

Solution:
a) Agree with Ray that first step to solution is to recognize that there is no political solution.
b) Excellent suggestion to increase taxes by 3% and cut expenses by 3%.  Everyone can tighten their belt a little.  If 3% will solve the problem then we should all be for it.
