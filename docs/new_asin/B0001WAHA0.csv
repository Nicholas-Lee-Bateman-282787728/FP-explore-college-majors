8016791,3,B0001WAHA0,"This first part of this program is a performance of Le Lagrime di San Pietro by de Lassus, a series of motets based on verse about Peter after he denied Christ. It's sung by the Consort of Musicke led by Anthony Rooley, circa 1985 (the production date of the video). They're top-notch performers of early music, seven voices in this case: Emma Kirkby, Evelyn Tubb, Mary Nichols, Cathy Cass, Joseph Cornwell, Andrew King, and Richard Wistreich. The vocal performance and sound are fine. (The 2.0 stereo track is constricted, but the 5.1 sound is open and clear even when listened to with only two channels.)

The video shows the vocalists singing inside an ancient stone church, dressed in what is no doubt supposed to be period clothing. The movements of the singers are choreographed a little, and some shots of the art on the walls is included. The color is fairly drab. Unfortunately, before each motet is a brief dramatic vignette that's probably supposed to have some connection to the music. They feature a man who behaves as a mime, pretending to eat invisible food or do things with invisible implements, with coarse sound effects and superimposed visions of the vocalists, who appear to haunt him. The effect is often comical. The sound effects are the most unfortunate part, as they intrude between the motets even if the video is turned off. Some, e.g. a violin playing, are definitely a distraction. There are no chapters for each motet, so no easy way to skip these.

The second part of the program is Ockeghem's Missa pro defunctis (requiem) sung by the Hilliard Ensemble led by Paul Hillier, circa 1990. For this performance the group is made up of six male voices: Ashley Stafford, David James, Mark Padmore, Rogers Covey-Crump, Gordon Jones, and Hillier. Again the vocal performance and sound are fine. The resonant location complained of in another review doesn't seem to be a problem--each voice and note is clearly audible.

The video shows the vocalists performing in modern suits in the same stone church as in the other video; the color is again subdued. I don't share another reviewer's apparent wish for more outward emoting or movement by the singers, who behave just as I would expect them to. Below the singers are seven girls, students from a Bologna ballet studio, who interpret the music in modern dance. Their performance isn't very proficient technically, and though the choreography is suitable in mood, I don't care for it as an accompaniment. Happily, in this case one can just turn off the video and listen to the music.

There are some audio-only extras, 45 minutes of early music featuring the pan flute, mostly accompanied by harpsichord and bass viol. It's decently performed. The music is cut off before the end of the last piece. Only about half the music is named on the DVD menu, and none of the performers, but it appears it's taken from a recording released on CD as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Renaissance-and-Baroque-on-the-Pan-Flute/dp/B000009KQ1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Renaissance and Baroque on the Pan Flute</a>, which lists Philippe Emanuel Haas, Eric Latour, and Janka Speglitz as the artists.

To sum up, the performances are good, but the De Lassus is interrupted by distracting video and sound effects that cannot be completely escaped. The Ockeghem will appeal to most only for its audio. The extras are OK, though the last piece is cut off. Given the price this is currently going for (check&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/here/dp/B00020HAH4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">here</a>&nbsp;as well), one might consider getting this just for the audio of the requiem, though the same material has been recorded by the same forces for CD.",1420156800,,3784,5.24793388429752
