8750575,5,B01BLX0UBI,"I must say I was surprised on how much I liked this, considering that I grew up watching the very first season of Yu-Gi-Oh! & now I'm an adult this season brought me back to when I was a kid. The graphics have gotten a lot better over the years, but that's not too surprising. If anyone else watched this series on the Pix 11 channel like I did then you missed the last 33 episodes when it got taken off the channel. I'm glad I decided to buy this last season of the series.",1464220800,4,474,4.0
