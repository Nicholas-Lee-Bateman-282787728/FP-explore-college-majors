8318216,5,B001LIW2HO,Kettlenetics is my favorite workout! I  can't stick to workouts that take a long time and don't give me quick results. All my muscles are burning when I finish a round of kettlenetics.,1520208000,,184,4.575757575757576
8318217,5,B001LIW2HO,I received the product on time. The CD case picture looks like a copy of a copy but the material is there and what I ordered.,1483920000,,125,3.8461538461538463
8318218,5,B001LIW2HO,"This is my second time using this work-out & I love it. It does not aggravate my old injuries like Zumba & other programs I've tried.
Several years ago I truck driver fell asleep at the wheel while I was riding a bicycle. The doctors said what saved my life was my muscle mass. I was a body builder. It took years for me to start working out again. When I saw the infomercial when this came out I was curious and then QVC had a special & I jumped on it. The first couple of months men started complimenting me how good I look. Which made me feel great, being in my early 50s. After many uses my D.V.D.s weren't working properly. I am so glad I saw this on Amazon. Even thou not all CDs work the one that I was looking for was flow motion basic. No matter how many times I use this CD I manage to break out with a heavy sweat. Then I switch when my body tells me I am ready to advance. If I was to listen to peoples comments on get a 8 lb. kettle bell I would be in bed for weeks",1473033600,,978,3.8465346534653464
8318219,1,B001LIW2HO,"Her form is utterly cringe-worthy.  If you're doing this with a super-light bell, then you probably won't get hurt, but there's definitely no chance of making this workout more advanced by going to a heavier bell:  with the moves she's doing that would be a very foolish idea.  The black gal in the back row caught my eye repeatedly throughout this series: she had much better form than Michelle for the moves that were closer to classic kettlebell exercises (e.g., she was remaining upright and stable throughout the halos, not swiveling her entire upper body like Michelle - the point of the exercise is to remain stable while the weight moves).  Is she a kettlebell pro and the confused look on her face was really ""why would anyone do something so silly?!"" ?  I don't know (suspect not).  But if you buy this, I'd keep an eye on that black gal and follow her rather than Michelle.",1460592000,,884,4.598726114649682
8318220,3,B001LIW2HO,Ok,1437177600,,2,2.0
8318221,5,B001LIW2HO,But the case was broken when I received it,1428796800,,42,3.7777777777777777
8318222,4,B001LIW2HO,Pretty good work-out.,1425254400,,21,6.333333333333333
8318223,5,B001LIW2HO,"First off the picture is wrong. Same workout as the 3 CD version, just broken into 4 CD's.
My first purchase was years ago direct from Gaiam but I gave it to a friend who lost it!
Great workout even with the 4 lb weight which was NOT included but not to worry because I
own my own 7 lb weight.  Yes she moves fast and yes you will learn what to do next after watching
the CD a few times.  Buy the CD and get your own weights locally would be my suggestion.",1365552000,6,456,3.8404255319148937
