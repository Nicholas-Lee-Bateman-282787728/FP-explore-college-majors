6075375,5,B00GGSYIGM,"This is how a prequel is supposed to be done. Engaging characters, wonderful storyline, and more of what every Fate/Stay Night fan loves: Gilgamesh. The original visual novel had an anime adaptation made by Studio Deen in 2006, adapting the Fate route with elements of Unlimited Blade Works. To be sure, this is a prequel to the VN, not the anime. Ufotable gives the fans what they want in this show. Wonderful animation and scenery that would make Hayao Miyazaki jealous. There is very little not to like in this show. Well, I probably could have done without so much Ryuunosuke and Caster. Apparently, the Ufotable staff loved Ryuunosuke, but his scenes only prove that he's a monster on par with Zouken. Anyway, back to the point, The inclusion of these character's only emphasize how much darker this Grail War was. If you are squeamish, I suggest staying away from this but if you don't mind entering the darkness of the Fourth Holy Grail war to see amazing action and complex characters buy it. And here is Some warnings to all those planning on watching the 2006 Stay Night anime or Movie after this:
1. Sakura's worm plot-line is not resolved in the '06 anime, that was explored in the Heaven's Feel route, which was never adapted.
2. English Voice actors are mostly the same for Zero and Stay Night, however Grant George(Lancer) plays Gilgamesh while David Vincent(Gilgamesh) plays Assassin, and Saber is switched from Kari Wahlgren(Zero) to Kate Higgins(TV Series) to Michelle Ruff(UBW Movie).
3. While the Fate/stay night anime and movie are excellent in their own right, they are inferior to Zero in almost every way. The anime had the unfortunate fate of adapting the most underwhelming route of the VN, which is still amazing compared to the majority of anime it was competing with at the time. The UBW movie is epic just as the route it was based on was, but it is basically 24-episode anime  condensed into 2 hours of screen time. In the end, If you're looking for something with a more direct connection to this series I must suggest you wait for Ufotable's upcoming adaptation of Stay Night this fall.",1399334400,12,2119,4.773841961852861
6075376,1,B00GGSYIGM,"I enjoyed Fate/stay night so I gave this one a try.
Bad idea.
I shut it off within half an hour to go vomit.

While I can understand writing atrocious actions to make a villain detested, the very concept of throwing a child in a pit of ""magic worms"" so they can ""violate her from head to toe"" can only be explained as the sublimation of detestable impulses on the writer/author's part.

Boycott this piece of garbage, and perhaps the pedo freak will starve.",1398643200,2,457,4.428571428571429
6075377,3,B00GGSYIGM,"I posted this on Crunchyroll too, so if this looks familiar, don't be surprised.

In all technical aspects, Fate/Zero is a masterpiece. The action is glorious. The music is appropriate. The characters are intriguing and dynamic. The premise and progression of the plot is a great hook. F/Z has literally everything, but one thing, going for it.

Pacing.

This series is extremely lethargic in its advancement. Many lines of dialogue are mere filler, expanding the series's space needlessly. Where faster anime like Code Geass and Steins;Gate (Ninja Scroll fits too, though it's a movie) waste little time in pushing the viewer forward, Fate/Zero bogs every scene down with extraneous reiteration. I found myself skipping through substantial portions of the last three episodes of the first season to get to the good bits. (yes, I have seen the whole first season of this, just elsewhere)

Despite that, F/Z is beautiful, stunning, and awe-inspiring. I just wish it didn't take forever to get moving.",1398470400,2,999,5.148148148148148

6075379,5,B00GGSYIGM,"Fate zero is a creative series with the fact that an organization that acts as a catholic church but, is not.  It is an awesome series.  I saw this series in Japanese and in English and both are pretty good. It is very different from the Fate stay Night series that it is in an more serious attitude but, none the less it is pretty good.  I would recommend this item not because it is cheap but, it is filled with action pack.  Forget about the blue-ray edition same resolution because it is a cartoon.  The problem of watching on the computer is freezing problems and resolution not that good. It is definitely a series worth purchasing.",1389916800,5,638,4.418803418803419

8622903,5,B00GGSYIGM,"Sometimes I feel that to call Fate/Zero a masterpiece is an understatement, it's just that good. It's frankly a gift to us anime fans to have a mature, bleak, well written story in which the typical fanservice-y, frivolous elements found in almost every other ""battle show"" are noticeably absent. They did not play it safe with this one, oh no. From beginning to end it steers clear of many familiar tropes and cliches, presenting a veritable tragedy with a not very happy ending.

What really sets it apart from Fate/Stay Night is that almost all the masters are interesting characters and their relationships with their servants are equally fascinating, whereas in F/SN the servants are relatively interesting and their masters are either boring or walking cliches, in general.

Even if the story and the characters turn you off, and if you happen to find it too ""slow paced"" as some have claimed (and I have no idea what show they watched, but it wasn't this one) it's worth it alone for the visuals and the action. Ufotable is an amazing studio and the animation/CGI mix they employ makes it look so easy it's not even funny. Do yourself a favor and watch it, it's one the best anime of 2011.",1417478400,7,1196,4.690476190476191
