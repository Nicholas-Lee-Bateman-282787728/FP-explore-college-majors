7798942,5,1576180433,"Greetings
This is a great dvd as well. This dvd takes you into more of what they believe in. The ""shunning"" the members. It doesn't matter if it is your daughter or grand chiled. If you leave the organization, you will be shunned! Lori Mac Gregor does a great job again. She was a second or third generation JW. God bless.",1220572800,3,322,4.295081967213115
7798943,4,1576180433,"This DVD, by McGregor Ministries Outreach, is the sequel of ""the Witness at you Door"".
Leo Stern, the militant elder who converted Joe Simpson in the first movie, started doubting about the Watchtower teachings, and felt lost and confused. Mrs Williams, the caring Christian woman who was also featured in the previous DVD, helped him to meet the biblical Jesus and be saved.

This DVD is more technical and it illustrates in detail the most important JW's doctrines such as blood transfusions, shunning, disfellowshipping, great crowd on earth and small crowd in heaven, smoking and their obsession with the end of the world.
Although the topics treated are extremely serious, this movie is very enjoyable and, in some instances, funny.",1204588800,3,737,5.141666666666667
