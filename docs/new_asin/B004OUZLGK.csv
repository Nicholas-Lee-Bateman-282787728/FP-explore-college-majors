4441863,5,B004OUZLGK,"I thought this film was well done! I can see why it's compared to Juno and Donnie Darko but it is definitely unique all on its own. I saw it this morning and haven't been able to stop thinking about it. Reece Thompson, Kat Dennings, and Josh Lucas were all great! It's a shame it's not very popular. Then again, I'm a big fan of independent films with unique story lines as opposed to feature films that seem so repetitive.

By the way, the soundtrack is AMAZING! Cannot wait to buy it!",1306022400,14,486,4.282608695652174
4441864,4,B004OUZLGK,"music and odd trippy scenes with color makes me think juno, plus the untimely courtship in a screwed up situation thirsten and caroline have is alot like a darker not so bubbley likeness of paulie and juno. the darkness and creepy twists and turns- donnie darko.  throw in a little ""lovely bones"" and some pot and you have Daydream Nation
i really liked it.
kat dennings was awesome, she is in everything, andie mcdowell did a great job as usual.  Josh Lucas was perfect for the part but after Undertow that doesnt shock me. hes a great actor.
its not a movie id wanta watch every day but i plan on making it part of my dvd collection.  just like donnie darko, its perfect for those moods where you just wanta get drink a few brewskies and watch a dark movie.  its not totally depressing like donnie darko was though.  a few people die throughout it but well,  theres a serial killer in it. but like i said, dark but not depressing.",1306022400,3,932,4.3895348837209305

4441866,4,B004OUZLGK,"It's hard being the new kid in school.  Caroline (Dennings) and her father move from a big city to a small town and she is not happy with the move.  She starts an affair with her teacher, and meets another boy her age.  This is a very hard movie to review.  The first half was pretty slow, the second half picked up and the last 20 min was great.  I'd compare it to ""Donnie Darko"", but not nearly as complicated to understand.  There is enough in the movie to keep you interested and watching through the slow parts, and after the ending you will be glad you did.  Overall this is a good movie, but not great, definantly worth watching though. I give it a B.

Would I watch again? - I don't think I would.

4441887,1,B004OUZLGK,"One of the most annoying, self-indulgent, nonsensical movies I have ever had the misfortune to suffer through and pay for the displeasure of viewing, chock full of hollow characters doing things that make absolutely NO sense, or ANY motivation for what they do.
Serial Killer theme is wrapped up with the hollowest of sense, SO random and out of left field, one of the laziest WTF writing you will EVER see on film. If you blink, you will miss it. BEYOND lazy writing.
Main character seems to exist only to hammer home cliche that men only want empty, bitchy. narcissistic ball breakers. Might ring a note of truth if you had ANY idea WHY she is such a self-loathing siren, but you get NO idea why she humps and dumps, and it's just SO ridiculously boring that it becomes laughable.
Pretentious artsy crap that hopes it's SO badly vague, that some hipsters will decide it's art.
Brings to mind (Forgotten) comedian
""I've suffered for my art...
Now it's your turn...""

BTW, If you thought watching this mess was at least going to get you a peek at Kat Dennings rack, you are sadly mistaken. You don't even get a HINT of her cleavage, and, for the ladies, no Josh Lucas chest either.

NO plot

NO story

NO decent characterization

Not even any decent skin shots, even tho the only point of this movie seems to be random sex

4441914,2,B004OUZLGK,"There is a vague attempt at a secondary storyline with the mystery of what's going on in their town to try to deflect from the very typical story of a creepy male teacher who has an inappropriate relationship with a ""sexy,"" more mature, female student who, as expected, goes hard to initiate a sexual relationship. As I've stated in a few of my other reviews - I watch female coming-of-age films critically. Women's studies majors - this film is probably not worth the watch if you're looking for a fresh take on female agency. Stick it with the other stacks of films and stories where girls gain access to being women through sex and are early portrayed as the initiators of relationships with men who want to justify having sex with teenage children.",1425686400,4,752,4.661654135338346

4441927,4,B004OUZLGK,"This indy film takes a look at a small town, its inhabitants and how they/we float through life not facing the reality of things.

Here's the scoop. Caroline (Kat Dennings) is from the big city. She's bright, savvy and is having a difficult time adjusting to this town where an industrial fire raging just off its borders, the kids imbibe copious amounts of alcohol and there is a serial killer on the loose. So what does she do? She puts the moves on her English teacher and dates a nice, local schoolmate to cover her tracks. Said teacher dates the school's female Phys Ed teacher to cover his. Things don't go very well.

This has a lot of cool things happening. Lights, sparklers and fireworks are nearly ubiquitous. They appear, in one form or another, in many scenes. Then there's the ominous plume of smoke, off in the distance, issuing from the burning factory. It lends a sense of dread to the proceedings. I also like how certain scenes are repeated using different characters. I thought it was a nice touch. How about the characters. Thurston (Reece Thompson) is a good hearted, smart enough guy who gets too high too often. He likes Caroline. She IS witty and her sharp tongue might be the slap he needs to wake him up from the mind-numbing existence of small time life. How about Barry Anderson (Josh Lucas) the English teacher. What a knucklehead. He has to know, in the back of his mind, that sleeping with a student can only end badly. Then to think she's the love of his life?!  Grow up!

Like all good indy flicks this is all writing and acting. The cast is more than decent and it's peppered with some really nifty tunes as well. It's directed and shot professionally. I didn't see the bones showing. So, if you're prone toward this sort of thing this is a good outing.",1385337600,4,1788,4.526315789473684
4441928,1,B004OUZLGK,Not so good acting and a bad storyline. I do not recommend this movie at all. Very poor writing and directing.,1384819200,2,110,4.285714285714286
4441929,1,B004OUZLGK,"So many that all the viewer is left with are unrealistic characters, horrible acting, and a story that depicts multiple social issues without saying anything significant.  Start with an environmental disaster, throw in a serial killer, sprinkle in some statutory rape, a few drug numbed teens, a large dose of emotional loss, and a hint of young love, then cram all of these into the time span of one year and you have this poor attempt at indie.  The only resolution to any issues these character face occurs by happenstance and takes no conscious effort of any character in the film.  Other than that, the characters are passive in the midst of very serious circumstances.  Their reactions to these circumstances are cliched and underdeveloped.  The relationships between characters seem to develop off screen or in melodramatic visions. For a girl we are supposed to believe is enlightened, the main character falls in love with an inept, sheltered boy for no apparent reason except that he's an emotional wreck with a drug problem.  In turn, he reconciles the main character's perceived infidelity in just a sentence or two. There's only so much that angst-y close ups and dramatic gazes can convey.  If I had seen this at a high school film festival I would have thought it was a ""cute"" attempt, but do not entertain the wallets of the lazy writers who scrapped this together.",1384128000,3,1381,4.8760683760683765

4441933,4,B004OUZLGK,It's downright spooky how much this kid resembles those two characters.  I was afraid by the middle that this story had run out of gas but it manages to tie everything together in a fairly satisfying conclusion.  The high school girl who takes charge of her own sexual encounters has rarely been studied in this much detail.  Minus one star for the embarrassing metaphor of the toxic smouldering industrial fire.,1364947200,,412,4.857142857142857

4441936,5,B004OUZLGK,"This was a dreamy little movie that I'd heard was becoming a cult classic. And since I love those kinds of movies I had to check it out. I would start by emphasizing that it is not a normal teen film in any way and if you're looking for a chick flick you're going to be disappointed. But for me this movie came out of nowhere -- well, Canada, I guess -- and shocked me by dealing with feelings and emotions through very surreal and sometimes brilliant film-making. The plot is messy, very messy, but that feels like part of the point: things are left dangling, weird events keep piling up, and all the while the movie is kept alive by superb acting by Kat Dennings and the wickedly clever double-edged dialogue. In some ways the story-telling is more like a book than a movie. I read one review that compared it to a Murakami novel and I thought that was a pretty apt comparison. Not for everyone, but definitely for me.",1346112000,6,920,4.354651162790698
4441937,4,B004OUZLGK,"Daydream Nation is a fairly interesting film with only a few questionable moments.  It's about Kat Dennings playing the character of a mature, witty, slightly sarcastic and introverted high school student who happens to find herself rocking the cradle with her teacher after several flirtatious suggestions as well as having more of a forced and unwelcomed relationship with a student by the name of Thurston.  Nevermind the awkwardness that a teacher is having sex with a student who may or may not be over 18.  I don't think that point was ever addressed- it was just assumed Kat's character was old enough.  Also the way Kat and her teacher finally hit it off felt strange since the build up before it occurred was about as unnatural as you can possibly imagine.  Kat was WAY too confident and comfortable around her teacher and I never understood why.  Unless she was so desperate for attention in a small town and had nothing better to do.

The problem with Thurston is that despite his best efforts to win over the love of his life, there's always a series of struggles that prevent the relationship from properly and completely getting off the ground (such as a couple awkward situations where Thurston approaches Kat's father at the front door and doesn't know how to introduce himself without stuttering and getting confused).  This scene is hilarious for the way he tries to strike up a conversation by way of handing the father some cupcakes and yet the father *still* wants nothing to do with him, and surely doesn't want his daughter dating such a gibberish spounting weirdo, lol.

We eventually realize that the teacher has issues of his own.  He plays the role of a guy in his mid 30's looking for a relationship and at first he seems like a regular likeable teacher but after going at it with Kat Dennings, he's develops mental issues that we discover later on.  Actually these issues just happen suddenly and surprisingly after a bizarre phone call.

One disappointing aspect is the conclusion.  Without spoiling what happens (and you'd probably never guess anyway because it's a million to one odds *that* would occur) there's a killer on the loose somewhere in town.  One of his victims is a cheerleader.  However what's unusual is that this part of the story almost NEVER comes up other than a couple scenes, so its inclusion feels like there should have been more to it than there is.  That's why the ending is so surprising, along with another reason.

Overall, Kat Dennings (who I just found out was born in Philadelphia, my home town.  Go Kat!) saves the movie with her intelligent and mature ways of communication with everyone.  No this is definitely not your typical school/relationship type movie.  The plot is deeper than the usual things you associate with such an environment such as partying, loud music, driving and sexual encounters.  This movie takes these common overused themes and builds on them in a more interesting and thought provoking way compared to other films that might fall under this category.",1343606400,,3042,4.845261121856867
4441938,2,B004OUZLGK,"The movie is good, in terms of great acting with a dark, twisted and not-too fast pace.  In fact, that's what sells the whole film.  Kat Dennings is solid in her performance as an egotistical teen with a somewhat third person view of events.  She beings sleeping with her teacher, as played by Josh Lucas; all the while being pursued by the guilt ridden pre-junkie destined to become her age appropriate boytoy.  Set against the backdrop of a bitter town with a serial killer tooling around, the first half of the movie holds promise.  And falls flat.  Essentially, she begins  dating the other teen, who betrays her in the end, but we realize that she will tolerate this--and more--probably for the entirety of her life because drugs are a valid excuse and life is temporary.  Well, life is temporary, but I was left with the impression that she really is the 'foppish little moron' that her by all accounts mentally-ill teacher fictionalized in his novel.  Well acted, but predictable.  A one-time watch.  Once you get over a great cast and cinematography, the remainder is stereotypes and socially sanctioned ignorance.",1342396800,2,1122,4.883597883597884

4441940,5,B004OUZLGK,"Kat Dennings is one of the best actresses working right now. Her comedic timing is genius! And when she's being serious and dramatic, she does it so good that you feel like you are right there in her head feeling those emotions too. She's great in 2 Broke Girls as well. If you liked her in movies such as House Bunny, Nick & Nora's Infinite Playlist, 40 Year Old Virgin, or Charlie Bartlett... GET THIS!",1340236800,,404,4.4
4441941,3,B004OUZLGK,"The moody Caroline Wexler moves from the big city to a small town where the kids do a lot of drugs and are inbreed losers with 6 toes. The story at times is third person, at other times Caroline narrates. She tells us of a tale of a girl in school who worked as a stripper until 2AM then showed up for school and took extra classes. The football team, she tells us, would heat up quarters and throw them at her while she walked through the halls. A ""serial killer"" (dubbed a serial killer after first body was found) kills the girl and they find marks of heated quarters on her legs. The waste dump fire and serial killer were under utilized as metaphors/symbols.

After her death, it appears the overly mature Caroline is the prettiest girl in school. She seduces her teacher and a classmate. As time goes on we discover the teacher has the persona of a psychotic character portrayed from his own novel and has developed an unhealthy need to continue his relationship with Caroline.

The movie makes clever use of juxtapositions to create humorous scenes. There are also slow scenes and slightly annoying first person narration. The soundtrack was fairly lame. The climax scene is supposed to be a culmination of the scenes building up upon each other. In an indie, it is not necessarily predictable, but it is at least metaphorically or symbolically part of the movie. This one was not. It was a complete let down and a lack of closure by the writer. Want to watch a clever indie, try ""Chumscubber.""",1312675200,,1501,4.5762081784386615
