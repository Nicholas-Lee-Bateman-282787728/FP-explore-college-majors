We all have questions.  Big questions.  Its part of what it means to be human.

My name is Stephen Hawking and I believe that anyone can answer big questions for themselves.  So with the help of some ordinary people and a team of experts, we are going on the ultimate voyage.  A quest to answer the greatest mysteries of the universe using the power of the human mind.

Because anyone can think like a genius.

The above is said at the beginning of each episode of this entertaining and very informative documentary thats presented by Stephen Hawking.

Hawking is a theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and author.  He has won numerous awards including the Albert Einstein Award and the Fundamental Physics Prize.  Hawking has a slow progressing form of ALS that has gradually paralyzed him over the decades.  He communicates via a speech-generating device.

So, what are the big questions that this documentary answers?  They are as follows:

(1) Can we time travel? (Time is one of Hawkings favourite topics.  This is my favourite episode.)
(2) Are we alone?
(3) Why are we here?
(4) Where did the universe come from?
(5) What are we?
(6) Where are we?

 The ordinary people or volunteers in this series are the ones who do the legwork and they show, through experiment, certain scientific concepts.

The team of experts aid Hawkings scientific and historical explanations.  These include at least one science historian, physicist, astrophysicist, astronomer, cosmologist, neuroscientist, and evolutionary biologist,

This documentary does a good job in giving homage to key scientists and their discoveries.

All the episodes have excellent graphics, animation, visual effects, and photography.

Finally, the main feature of this series documentary is, of course, Stephen Hawking.  His scientific and historical explanations using his synthesized voice are, in my opinion, what makes this documentary truly remarkable.

In conclusion, this documentary does a superb job in answering some of humanitys toughest and most enduring questions!!
