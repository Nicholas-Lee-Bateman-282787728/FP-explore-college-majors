1005495,1,6305279233,"I know I'm only restating what's been said countless times, but just to avoid anyone making the same mistake I did buying this:
The original, uncut version of this movie goes by ""Anthropophagus: The Beast"" or ""Unsane"".  Those titled movies include the notorious scenes of the fetus getting ripped out of a woman's womb and the self-evisceration and devouring of the zombie's guts at the film's end.  As of this writing, Anthropophagus is not available (to my knowledge) on a US, region 1 DVD.  This heavily cut and edited version is all that is available on DVD (though the uncut versions are purchasable on VHS in NTSC format).
Add to the fact that the picture and sound on Grim Reaper is laughably bad and that there are no special features (not even chapter stops- the whole movie runs in one continuous loop, so to jump ahead requires your finger on the fast frame or fast rewind buttons), and what was an effective gross-out, 3 1/2 star gore flick has been transferred into a 1 star ripoff.
Perhaps we'll see Anthropophagus in an uncut DVD version by Anchor Bay or Image in the not too distant future.  Until then, steer clear of this abomination.",1029801600,10,1152,4.6600985221674875
1005496,1,6305279233,"Why would anyone even buy this knowing it's the [terrible], heavily-edited version? This makes me sick. All this talk about ""freedom"" and a silly 80's horror movie cannot even be viewed by adults. When the un-cut version becomes available, then I'll give 5 stars and purchase.",1017014400,15,276,5.021739130434782
1005497,1,6305279233,"Okay, this butchered version of ANTHRPOPHAGUS:THE BEAST just goes to show how in a hurry DVD companies are willing to put out a film. People not familiar with Joe D'Amato's work shouldn't buy this film. People who already own a copy may want this version for comparision purposes. My advice for people is to either look for an uncut dub copy or try to seek out the Astro DVD version which was released in Germany but sadly is in German with no subtitles.",1015632000,6,454,4.481927710843373
1005498,2,6305279233,"Sadly this DVD being offered is the Good , but heavily censored version of 'Anthropophagous The Beast'. While this version is good and has it's moments , it is sadly missing many minutes of footage due to the United Kingdom and the United States moral censors with too much time on their hands!...",1014854400,4,297,4.622641509433962
1005499,3,6305279233,"The Reaper was stuck in a lifeboat with his ""wife and son"" and to keep from starving decided to eat his dead ""son"" and then accidentally kills his wife, when she tries to stop him. This must have driven him insane and cannibalistic. The Grim Reaper is probably one of the few movies of its time that is all gore and no sex.
The picture quality of the DVD is not too bad; there are no extras, not even scene selections.",1009497600,,418,4.172839506172839
1005500,1,6305279233,"This film is titled ""Anthropophagus/Savage Island, etc.."" in other versions which are UNCUT with all the gore missing from THIS version, ""The Grim Reaper"".  I got a copy on video from Midnight Video  under the original title, ""Anthropophagus"" and it was great!  There are two key scenes that I know for a fact are censcored from the U.S.  realese ""Grim Reaper"".  The first scene is the infamous fetus  eating scene where George Eastman eats an unborn baby ripped from a woman's  crotch.  The second scene being the end where the beast gets a pickaxe to  the belly, where afterwards he proceeds to eat his own intestines.  Bottom  line it is a must see film for any gorehound, but beware of ANY version,  unless it is titled ""Anthropophagus"".",954633600,8,741,4.748031496062992
1005501,5,6305279233,I loved that movie. The uncut European (German vesion) is fantastic. Americans - avoid the terribly cut US-version.,935625600,9,115,5.444444444444445
7886929,5,6305279233,"I have not seen the unedited version. I was aware that Grim Reaper was edited down version of a more controversial film.

Tisa Farrow (Zombi2) stars in this eerie film. She did a pretty good job though I've never seen her give a bad performance. Its hard to judge the acting in this kind of filmed since the actors are dubbed over. some of the voice acting is better than others.

I really liked the atmosphere. Creepy and mysterious. I didn't mind that most of the gore had been edited out because the mystery of the island was quite interesting. I thought the pacing was good, though a bit slow. If you want constant action then you probably won't like it.

Unfortunately there were no extras. I put the disc in and the film starts. There's no chapters or subtitles included.",1469923200,,777,4.49645390070922
7886930,5,6305279233,"I was surprised to see such low ratings for this movie.  I thought it was very good with excellent special effects. Constant suspense, great setting. I loved it. ******POST EDIT....I see what's happening now after looking at the other reviews I have the uncut version so as everybody says get the right version. The version I have the very first scene has an axe going through somebody's head with brain matter coming out and it just takes off from there PS I'm selling my copy under ""james jazzy""  if you want the good version.",1432425600,,528,4.6063829787234045
7886931,1,6305279233,"What gets me the most is the great reviews this pile of junk gets, this is one of the most boring films I have ever seen. Wasting about 1 hour just to introduce us to the bland characters, who are free loving hippies sailing on some yacht near the Turkish islands of Yalepha, we learn to not care about them at all. Once they land on the island, the suspense should begin but all we are shown is vignettes that are typical, the ""sex starved guy"", the ""screaming girl"", etc, etc.

This was boring as heck and once the crazy monster, played by some half bald idiot in bad make-up comes on the scream, I had to laugh. The supposedly ""wicked scene"" was nothing but a plastic baby being devoured by the monster, yeah, that's really gruesome! Of course, the end is also typical, instead of attempting to kill the monster, he comes to the survivors of the slaughter and gets a small spike in his head, why didn't they just shoot him in the first place instead of dragging this worthless film over any longer?

7886932,4,6305279233,This product arrived on time & in good condition.  Have not viewed this DVD yet so I cannot comment on the actual movie or how well it plays.,1389571200,,141,4.035714285714286
7886933,3,6305279233,"Saludos Terricolas, Go to the point, in this version never see the ""awesome"" fetus-eating scene, and the self-eating final scene.  This movie is verry good but is X-treme if they put this two scene.  This two is the verry power of the movie thath why the people of the 80' (including me of course) see this movie some many times in vhs, oh and if you want to know the languege of this version is english, but how cares that !!!",1306454400,,427,4.2592592592592595
7886934,2,6305279233,"And I mean really beware. It's not about the movie itself which is quite good and considered by many as a classic horror - it's about the edition. First it doesn't even have a menu. But that's a minor misdoing. What's more important - this is a TOTALLY cut version. All the scenes that are loved by viewers and because of which the movie became famous are not here. And I mean ALL.

Wait just a little for a new 2-disc Media Blasters' ""Anthropophagous"" edition which has to be a full-verison. And this one... Maybe in 10 years it will become a rarity and you'll be able to sell it profitably :) Who knows?",1131062400,10,605,4.307017543859649

7886938,1,6305279233,"Okay, first off, I did not buy this version of Anthropophagous (or as it's titled here Grim Reaper).  I'm writing this to let ALL of you know that this version is not worth the buy.  There is, however, a place to get this--FULLY uncut with all the restored footage (including the fetus-devouring scene and the last scene, the self-consumption of the entrails).  Go to [website] and visit their DVD section.  They've got it there, along with dozens of other obscure horror, gore and exploitation flicks.  While the DVD that I ordered there has trouble fastforwarding and rewinding, I still have the entire complete footage.  The website really is the #1 place to go for anything like this...if they can't do it, none can.",1033344000,11,720,4.813008130081301
