5577915,5,B00BCMT1PK,So glad that this favorite Saturday morning cartoon is back I plan on getting the whole series the ghost with most is back with all his neither world weirdness :),1366934400,,162,4.433333333333334
5577916,5,B00BCMT1PK,"Ironically, (as with most cartoon adaptations I've witnessed) I watched the show before the actual movie, and loved the animated adaptation.  One reason is unlike Past adaptions of film and TV Shows, Tim Burton, the creator oversaw the show's production and kept it as funny as the film, but acceptable for Saturday Morning:  where Lydia Deetz and her family live in the house, and she somehow discovered Beetlejuice, of course, the former residents from the movie aren't in the show.

The premise deals with how Lydia deals with her ghostly friend in and out of the Netherworld, usually contending with supernatural products or Beetlejuice's wild schemes.  Before it was done in Chowder and Flapjack, Beetlejuice utilized different medias rather well.  Basically using computer animation whenever the television was used in the series, sure it wasn't anything like in Futurama (remember this was the 80s), but it helped make the show interesting at times.

The First Season spans the Saturday Morning Cartoon Show, which I feel was a bit better than its syndicated part since it was a bit more consistence rather than just being chaotic randomness.  In this series, we see Beetlejuice attempt babysitting, enter a gross-out contest, deal with actual skeletons in the closet.  Also this season introduced Prince Vince and Beetlejuice's (!) parents.  Other supporting members include the Camp Fire Ghouls, Jacque La Lean, Ginger, and the Monster Across the Street (which was loosely based on Warner Bros.' Gossamer character).

Basically if you're new to the series, or a classic viewer, Season One is the best place to start visiting the Netherworld and the Ghost with the Most.",1364342400,9,1678,5.181481481481481

He likes that Beetlejuice and Lydia are always getting into trouble.  He also thinks all the bugs, sandworms, creatures, etc. are hysterical.  This show is awesome for any kid (or adult) who likes crude humor and gross stuff.  It isn't inappropriate at all, but it does involve a lots of creepy crawly things:)  A great buy!",1458777600,,502,4.166666666666667

5577982,5,B00BCMT1PK,"I love this! Such a great cartoon! I remember being obsessed with this show as a child. I think it's still something parents should show their kids today and which kids will still love. The animation is great, the voice acting is great. The only thing I wish they'd done is give us some commentary by people who worked behind the scenes and the voice actors. At least the voice actors! Maybe eventually they'll release DVD sets for this show where that happens. But, even without them this is still great to have. I'm so happy that I bought it. I'm going to buy the season 2 and 3 box set next! I think any home with children in it or with children who come to visit regularly should have this! Anyone who remembers this show from when they were young won't regret buying this, either, even if they don't have children themselves. Absolutely great. I am over the moon with this!
