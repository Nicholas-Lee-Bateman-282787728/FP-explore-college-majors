While this 4th dvd is not as solid as the 1st 3, it is still full of great adventures. In episode 1, some medicine is trapped under the sea, and some trained octupuses come to the rescue; in 2, Kris gets trapped in an undersea current as some sharks swim by; in 3, we see out heroes rescue a man trapped under water; later, we see Captain Nemo, Kris, and Robbie get awards for saving whales in previous episodes. We also get to see a lecture on the Bermuda Triangle with some scary results. In one episode Robbie almost gets stung by an underwater snake. Later, he encounters a dangerous Sea Wasp. In one episode we learn that there are MANY different kinds of sharks. All 4 dvds are full of great lessons about life under the sea and exciting as well as educational.",1210118400,,878,4.327272727272727
