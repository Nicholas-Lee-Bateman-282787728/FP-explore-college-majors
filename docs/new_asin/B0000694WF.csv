7965236,5,B0000694WF,"It took my daughter and I a couple weeks to understand what my 2 year old granddaughter continually requested.  She implored us to get or turn on the roast beef show ... turns out she meant Ferocious Beast ... We have tried to collect all of them.  Now the 7 year old and 2 year are arguing over which one to watch first.  They love them.  The beast is gentle, Maggie is cute, the stories have lessons; a good, fun time with a lovely story each time.  I highly recommend especially if you have child or grandchild afraid of monsters or unseen scary things.  Lilli has been terrified about monsters.  Now she says they're not really scary. She knows they're like Maggie and the ""roast beef"" and she's not frightened anymore.  : )",1214870400,,728,4.421052631578948
7965237,5,B0000694WF,I have three year old twins - a boy and a girl.  both of them love Maggie & the Ferocious Beast. I bought the DVD because Noggin only has the show on once a day.  It's funny and lively and colorful.  I enjoy it as much as they do.,1141776000,5,230,3.6530612244897958
7965238,5,B0000694WF,"Maggie is a girl that both boys and girls can admire.  She is kind, intelligent and resourceful.  She likes adventures, makes up fun games and helps her friends Hamilton Hocks and The Ferocious Beast; and though Hamilton and Beast don't often see eye-to-eye, Hamilton loves to cook and the Beast loves to eat, so that works out too.  The three friends wander through Nowhere Land, a fun place populated with interesting creatures.

This DVD contains six Maggie and the Ferocious Beast adventures:  Beastly Picture, where the Beast accidentally destroys a picture Maggie has painted of him; Big Duck, about judging someone -- say, a big duck -- that you've only just met; Hamilton's Pet, about loving wild creatures without caging them; My One and Only Box, about Hamilton's security issues; Mr. Shivers, about the friends' snowman acquaintance and their magical snowglobe; and King of Nowhere Land, about the rights and responsibilities of leadership -- it's lonely at the top!

Each of these charming stories is 7-1/2 to 8-1/2 minutes long.  You can play them individually or choose to play them all in succession.  Audio is in English or Spanish, and subtitles are available in English (a nice feature for early readers).  There are also several trailers for other DVDs.
While the episodes are absolutely wonderful, it would have been nice to get some information about the voice talent.  Also, instead of just a cover sheet with episodes listed, why not insert some puzzles or stories for kids?

Preschool and toddler boys and girls will enjoy these tales of adventure, and they will see some entertaining lessons about friendship.  Very well done indeed.",1048291200,14,1658,5.055147058823529
