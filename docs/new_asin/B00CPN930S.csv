5732831,4,B00CPN930S,"My grandkids and I LOVE Pocoyo! Even though all the episodes on this DVD are wonderful...the episode depicted on the cover IS NOT ON THIS DVD!! My grandkids LOVE the Halloween episode (Monster Mash?) which is why I bought this DVD. NO WHERE is there a list of the episodes included on this DVD. I didn't find out the episode I justifiably ASSUMED would be on this DVD, WASN'T on it, until I received it.

AMAZON.COM you need to list the episodes on each and every DVD for your customers. The only way to see a list of the episodes on these DVDs, is in the REVIEWS! This particular case (with the deceptive cover) is nothing short of false advertising. I feel duped! WHERE is the Halloween episode? The Monster Mash that was mentioned in the product description?",1387411200,5,761,4.5144927536231885
5732832,5,B00CPN930S,My son loved this DVD.  Not really a lot to do with Halloween but Pocoyo always has him laughing out loud.,1384905600,,106,4.0476190476190474
5732833,5,B00CPN930S,Pocoyo and gang are always fun to watch and very educational too. We even find ourselves watching these wonderful video's.,1383696000,,122,5.15
5732834,2,B00CPN930S,"First off, I have to let you know we were given this move for the purpose of doing a review on it.  I've been thinking about what I wanted to say about Pocoyo Boo for a few days now. Unfortunately my son, he is 2,  did not care for this movie at all. I've put it on for him a few different times and each time he lost interest in no time.  I have to say I didn't really care too much for it either though. Now it Pocoyo's defense, we have never watched anything Pocoyo before and just couldn't get into it. I think it's the fact that for the most part the characters don't really do any of the talking, everything is mostly interpreted by the narrator. I  think that is why he lost interest, he is too young to grasp that. I didn't care for the fact that the movie was put out to and made be a Halloween movie when you look at it, but it really isn't. There are 7 episodes (Boo, Scary Noises, Detective Pocoyo, Lost In Space, Poczilla, Monster Mystery and Angry Alien) none of which are about Halloween. The movie runs about 45 minutes, so it is a decent length for a kid's movie. Now don't get me wrong, I don't want to make discourage anyone about Pocoyo. I have friends who's kids just love Pocoyo and I'm sure if your a Pocoyo fan you will like this move, my son just wasn't one of them. Well I hope that helps some of you... enjoy.",1383523200,,1336,4.068441064638783
5732835,5,B00CPN930S,"We received a copy of ""Pocoyo Boo"" to review just in time for Halloween! My four year old daughter giggled throughout the seven episodes on this DVD. After watching the shows, she had fun jumping out at the rest of the family and shouting ""boo"".
This is wholesome family entertainment and a great non scary Halloween DVD!",1383091200,,321,4.649122807017544
5732836,5,B00CPN930S,"This month NCircle Entertainment released some not so spooky Halloween fun for the little ones and we were lucky enough to be able to choose a complimentary DVD as members of the NSider program. We decided to go with one of our favorite characters and chose the Pocoyo ""Boo!"" DVD. Even when he is scaring his friends, this little guy is adorable. It was nice to have some Halloween entertainment for our little one that I knew would not give her a scare. Instead Pocoyo and friends kept her giggling at all their Halloween fun! This DVD has seven episodes packed full of preschool friendly games, monster parties, aliens and of course a little friendly scaring (BOO!). She can't get enough of Pocoyo and friends!",1382400000,,712,4.704
5732837,5,B00CPN930S,"Pocoyo Boo! Is adorable.  Just in time for Halloween.  My little guy enjoyed it (and even jumped here and there).  Again, Pocoyo is always welcome in our home.  This video has a variety of episodes that will delight your children.",1382227200,,230,4.675

5732839,3,B00CPN930S,"Our family received a copy of ""Pocoyo-Boo"" this month as an NSider review.  I have to admit, while the living room was filled with giggles, I just didn't ""get it"".  LOL.  Pocoyo was having a great time sneaking up scaring everyone, including the narrator, and the kids were in fits of giggles themselves over it.  I will say that in our home, we are always sneaking up on each other and scaring each other and it IS a lot of fun so maybe the kids were relating to it.  Overall, it was a good movie.  While the cover and title makes it look Halloween-ish, it's really not.  The only complaint I have is that I wish the alien was a she in ""Scary Noises"".  While that innuendo was hard to catch and most children may not, I don't feel the need for it to be included in a children's movie.",1381708800,,785,4.1866666666666665
5732840,5,B00CPN930S,"October is my favorite month of the year between the changing weather, fall decorations and all things Halloween. I think this has rubbed off on my kids because they love everything Halloween too! Pocoyo: Boo was our first Halloween DVD of the year so we were all ready to kick off the season with a good family fun DVD!

I keep thinking at four and five my kids will outgrow Pocoyo soon because it seems a bit young to me but they still LOVE him! I don't know what it is about this little guy but it completely mesmerizes them and they literally sit still and stare at the TV the whole time he's on. I need to figure out the secret!

With his fun friends, bright colors and silly sound effects, Pocoyo is music to my preschoolers ears and joy to their eyes. This DVD has seven new episodes including a few Halloween themed.

They requested to watch Boo and Monster Mystery over and over again. I really wish these shows lasted longer than seven minutes because it doesn't give me much time to walk away and get anything done. Is that a legitimate complaint? Probably not when it's something educational, safe and fun for my kids to watch.

Pocoyo: Boo is a great addition to your little ones NCircle library for some Halloween fun!",1381622400,,1232,4.438053097345133
5732841,5,B00CPN930S,"My kids and I just watched the newest Pocoyo DVD release called ""Pocoyo- Boo!"" which includes 7 episodes with a running time of about 45 minutes. In the episode titled ""Boo!"", Pocoyo enjoys sneaking up on and scaring his friends, until the tables turn and it's his friends who are doing the surprising! In ""Scary Noises"", Pato crashes the Vamoosh on a strange planet where he makes a new alien friend. In ""Detective Pocoyo"", Ellie looses her doll and accuses her friends of taking it, but it turns out she was responsible for the disappearance all along. Pocoyo, Pato and Baby Bird can't find their way back to the Vamoosh after visiting an alien friend on his home planet in the episode titled ""Lost in Space"". In ""Poczilla"", Pocoyo and Pato act out a comic book cartoon. Everyone thinks Sleepy Bird is a monster when Pocoyo's monster-decorated box falls on top of her in the episode titled ""Monster Mystery"". In ""Angry Alien"", a visitor from another planet tries to rule over Pocoyo's world but has a change of heart when he becomes friends with the inhabitants. My kids get a kick out of watching Pocoyo (and I'm guessing yours will too), so pick up your copy today! :)",1381449600,5,1172,4.639423076923077
5732842,5,B00CPN930S,my little girl loves pocoyo and this movie was great!!! Great way to get your child excited about halloween and for them not to fear this holiday.,1381449600,,146,4.444444444444445
5732843,4,B00CPN930S,"My boys love Pocoyo and Halloween. So when I saw this I knew I had to get it for them. I gave it only four stars because the cover is misleading. Since Ele is dressed as a mummy, a jack-o-lantern, and bats are on the cover you think there would be an episode with Ele dressed in the mummy costume and maybe something to do with Halloween but none of the episodes on this disc include a Halloween themed story. The episodes are mainly about using the word boo to scare people and a few alien/outer-space episodes.",1381017600,,512,4.288659793814433
5732844,2,B00CPN930S,"This video is truly great for young children with gay parents or children that have other gay couples in their family. It's also great for parents that want to address homosexual relationships at an early age. Our family, however, prefers to establish male/female relationships as the baseline and save the complexities of different sexual preferences for when she's a little older. I grew up with heterosexual relationships as the ""norm"" but that didn't affect my ability to accept gay couples when I was older.

In the episode, ""Scary Noises"", the duck (is his name Pato?), who is a ""he"" falls in love with an alien, who is also a ""he"". Complete with throbbing hearts and romantic picnics gazing into each others eyes. I watched it again to make sure it wasn't my assumption that the alien was a ""he"". Indeed, the narrator calls it a ""he"". In another episode, they return to space specifically to find their ""friend"". As viewers, we naturally expect them to be looking for the romantic buddy. It turns out not be that particular alien, but it still reinforces him in our thoughts.

As I said, if you are trying to raise a child encouraging homosexuality, this is a perfect way to do it. If you're not sure you want to expose them at this age, as I don't, avoid this DVD. You really won't be missing much as far as a ""Halloween"" theme, because none of the episodes are really Halloween themed anyway. Only the main menu screen.",1380585600,,1428,4.640316205533597
5732845,5,B00CPN930S,Alleviate the boredom for young children with Pocoyo videos when you travel long distances.  They are short & entertaining.  More action than words.  Very stimulating.,1379289600,,167,5.6
8584597,5,B00CPN930S,My granddaughters ages 2 and 4 LOVE this movie.  They want to watch it all the time!,1521158400,,84,3.9411764705882355
8584598,3,B00CPN930S,I'm kinda disappointed that there wasn't actually a Halloween episode or any new ones. They are all on other DVDs but the little one still loves it.,1479772800,,148,4.518518518518518
8584599,4,B00CPN930S,"I love this movie because it is a silly Halloween themed movie.  It made me think twice about the characters and it is fun and informative. Pocoyo and his friends are pretty funny.  There are seven stories and every story has a lesson such as telling the truth, facing your fears, making new friends and being fair to friends.

This is an animated movie where the main character is a little boy named Pocoyo. There is also a silly duck named Pato who has crazy eyes, a pink elephant named Elly, a cute colorful dog named Loula and a little bird named Sleepy Bird. There is also a narrator with an English accent which I think is cool.

In the beginning, I thought Pocoyo was mean because he tries to scare his friends a lot. As the movie developed, I realized that Pocoyo is just a little boy who is learning how to treat others just like any other kid.

My favorite character is Pato because he is so silly and has crazy looking eyes, especially when he is scared.  The movie is perfect for Halloween because there are monsters, silly Halloween dress ups and aliens, but it isn't too scary for younger kids.  The characters do silly things that made me laugh but also made me think where are the parents? Then I remembered, its just a movie and Pocoyo and his friends have great imaginations!

This movie is perfect for younger kids who will learn important lessons and learn to use their imagination  both of which are very important.  I loved this show when it played on Nick Jr. when I was younger and I still love it now thanks to this movie. I watched the movie with my 3-year-old cousin and she loved it. She laughed the entire time and now this is her favorite show.  I recommend this for kids ages 1 to 6.  I think parents will like it too since it teaches kids important life lesson about how to treat others in a fun way. This is a perfect movie for families to watch together this Halloween.  I give this movie 4 out of 5 stars because I don't think the characters talk enough.
