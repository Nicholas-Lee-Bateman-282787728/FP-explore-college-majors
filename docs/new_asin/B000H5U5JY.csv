8181079,1,B000H5U5JY,"This dvd was a real disappointment. The only good thing with it was the background music. The only panther you get to see is so skinny that one wonders if it ever was fed. A deer is also seen running, but the photos were taken from an airplane. The manatees were OK to watch and the Everglades also. On the whole I must say it is not worth the money. It would help if somebody narrated a DVD like this. Unfortunately this is not the case here.",1295827200,,443,4.103448275862069
