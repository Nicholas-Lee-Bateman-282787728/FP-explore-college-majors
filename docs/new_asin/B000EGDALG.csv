8109020,2,B000EGDALG,"James Edwards (Julian Morris) attends an all boys academy. When the class has a dancer meet them secretly, Whirly Girl Alice (Monet Mazur) lifts James' watch. The watch was a keepsake given to him by his deceased father. James travels to NYC to get his watch back, but gets much more as he becomes part of a troubled dancers' life.

The film is a comedy drama romance disguised as sex teen romp. Like most romances it ends PLOT SPOILER with the guy running after the girl pledging his undying love...in a way. The film seemed rather haphazardly done. James needed more background and it should have developed Alice first as a subplot. As such the film was more about James than the title character used to market the film as a teen sex romp.

8109023,4,B000EGDALG,"I watched this movie for one reason - Monet Mazur. Had the movie ended after her illicit dance at the school I would have said, ""boy, she looks and dances great - 4 stars"". But the movie continued, and the (mostly) drama that ensued was very good also. I was pleasantly surprised. I wasn't expecting such a thoughtful and realistic and well developed story. Like another reviewer commented, I thought more mindless American Pie shenanigans would follow. But no. The leading actor, Julian Morris, was deftly able to snatch the movie away from the faceless gang of classmates and become a real person. And Monet Mazur isn't just some faceless tart in a skimpy dress, nor a con artist with a heart of gold, but somebody who was equally real. I hope I don't make it sound too heavy, as the overall tone is on the light side, but this is a movie that you'll enjoy for the physical elements as well as the emotional content. If you're a fan of Monet Mazur or of Coming of Age movies or of movies that aren't simply a mishmosh of stereotypes, then you won't be disappointed.",1236211200,,1067,4.505154639175258
8109024,5,B000EGDALG,"Wow! This story really moved me! I didn't expect to like this too much, especially because I thought it was going to be an American Pie rip off. Oh, I was so wrong! It was amazing. A comedy? No, not really, but it definitely had its comedic moments. I love comedies, but this story was so much more! It really reeled me in! I never right reviews, but this story was so absolutely AWESOME it gave me a reason to. It was AWESOME!!!!",1216512000,,430,4.192771084337349
8109025,3,B000EGDALG,"Jim Wison's Whirly Girl came as a pleasant surprise. It is certainly not great film making but it has a story that keeps your interest and characters that you grow to care about. The main problem was the way Screen Media decided to market the product. From a first glane this like like the typical teen sex comedy it isn't. There is some pretty serious drama in the third act that will probably turn off its expected audience.

Whirley Girl tells the story of an exotic dancer named Alice (Monet Mazur). She is hired by the boys of an elite prep school to dance for them . During the course of her dance she steals the watch of James(Julian Morris). In his quest to regain his property he must track her down in New York City.

After finding her the pair become friends and later lovers. There is a subplot involving an abusive boyfriend that gets resolved near the end and a moral choice that must be made about staying in school to pursue ones dreams.

The picture is presented on a bare bones disc with only some other trailers for the usual teen comedy material by Screen Media. This could have been a really good movie if it had a better marketing director. Worth a  rental if you can find it.",1190073600,,1198,4.382882882882883
8109026,2,B000EGDALG,"Julian Morris (Cry Wolf, Young Arthur) stars as James a young boy who hires a Whirlygirl (Exotic Dancer) one night to entertain him and a bunch of his friends in a secret little place since it's prohibited on school grounds. Once the Whirlygirl played by Monet Mazur (Torque, 40 Days & 40 Nights) leaves James soon finds out that she has taken a valuable watch from him. So, he asks the head of the school if he can leave to go get the watch and he'll return before curfew. James tracks down the Whirlygirl at her apartment in which he soon starts to fall for her (as usual). Interesting look but there's nothing really here to get excited about. Mazur is beautiful and Morris gives a dull performance. Also starring Daniel Franzese (Bully, Mean Girls) and a surprising appearance by David Garrison (Married With Children, Op Center) as one of Mazur's customers. Well it was surprising to see him but he didn't have that much to do really. This gets a ** out of ****",1152230400,,966,4.525714285714286
