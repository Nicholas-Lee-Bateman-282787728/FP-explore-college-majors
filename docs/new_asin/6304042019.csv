777006,5,6304042019,"For a low budget Sci-Fi, This is a very well written Movie. Fans of Star Trek will like this movie because ""Q"" (John De Lancie) plays a very different character in this movie. Overall, Good Action, OK Graphics, Great Storyline.",1025827200,,227,4.7
777007,3,6304042019,"Evolver is a movie about a kid who wins a video game contest set out by a large company. The robot that he wins is was a trashed government project, and the robot starts killing people.  This movie was ok, but there were no  big names, or great special effects.  The story line was OK, so it gets  about three stars.",962755200,3,316,4.131147540983607

777090,3,6304042019,Fun 90's virtual reality/robot romp that is good clean fun (despite a four letter word or two). Girl and guy find romance while fighting a rouge robot ostensibly designed for games. Sinister cybernetic company delivers the toy to a suburban family and it's on! Liked the 90's vibe.,1458950400,,281,4.875

777095,1,6304042019,Juvenile and stupid.  Bad script.  Bad effects. Bad acting.  There is nothing to recommend this movie.,1436832000,,102,5.25
777096,2,6304042019,Someone as a very bad imagination when it comes to making movies. Better then a soap opera or sitcom but that's about it,1436832000,,120,4.260869565217392
777097,4,6304042019,An older movie but enjoyable like war games and other movies of this time frame.  Worth the time to sit down and watch.  Might even recognize some actors from other scifi classics.,1433980800,,180,4.59375

777165,1,6304042019,"Although some of the actors did their best with their roles, the script and dialogue were definitely aimed at juveniles. The nudity and language in the film is what earned it an R rating. It's a five alarm nerd alert movie. With some geek appeal. I wouldn't watch it again. Ever.",1412208000,,279,4.490196078431373
777166,5,6304042019,"Teen game-wizard, Kyle Baxter hacks into the CYBER-TRONIX database to see how he fared in a game contest. At the same time, a CT tech genius, Dr. Russell Bennett (John De Lancie- THE HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE, TVs STAR TREK:TNG) is tinkering w/ the new, improved EVOLVER robot. Unknown to the CYBER-TRONIX people, Kyle has cheated and wins the contest. His prize? The EVOLVER robot of course! At first, EVOLVER is a ""cute"" novelty, playing laser-tag-like games w/ Kyle and his friends. Obviously, if EVOLVER remained harmless, then this would be another SHORT CIRCUIT. So, EVOLVER is an AI robot w/ a mind of its own. As a learning robot, it corrects itself whenever it makes a mistake. This makes it not only a superior game player, but also a stealthy, though clunky, killing machine! EVOLVER quickly becomes dangerous, trying out its now-lethal techniques on an unsuspecting high school jock. Kyle and his family have no idea that EVOLVER is more than a toy. It's a sophisticated weapon, secretly developed for military use. As the bodies pile up, EVOLVER grows ever more difficult to defeat. It's up to Kyle and Dr. Bennett to find a way to stop this droid of doom! If you like killer robot movies like CHOPPING MALL, then you should love this. The cheeeze-factor is into the stratosphere, making EVOLVER a terabyte's worth of fun! Co-stars Cindy Pickett (STEPDAUGHTER) as Kyle's mum. A classic!...",1390262400,4,1403,4.874476987447698
777167,5,6304042019,"was fun to watch, not believable for a person to win in this for real, but gives hope. we should not depend so much on machines",1389657600,,127,3.923076923076923
777168,5,6304042019,"For the time, with little or no CG available, this is a good movie.  The actors are interesting.  the plot is standard but the effects are good.  A fan of this genre should check this one out",1378425600,,191,4.108108108108108
777169,3,6304042019,One of those movies that is so bad it is good. Maybe there is a rifftracks or mst3k for it.,1375488000,,91,3.6
777170,3,6304042019,"I have to say that the action in this film was creative and exiting. Sadly, the acting and dialogue was horrid. The plot was predictable. All of the actors other than Ethan Embry were just plain bad at acting. If there was halfway decent acting and dialogue in ""Evolver"", the film would have been a spectacurlar success. For that reason, I have to say that ""Evolver"" is one of the most well made 'bad' movies that I have ever seen.",1185494400,4,431,4.4
777171,5,6304042019,"This movie I thorougly love!!! A young man named Kyle played by Ethan Embry plays a robotic laser-tag like video game called Evolver fantasticaly! When he wins a video game contest of Evolver by changing the scores of his opponents, he wins an Evolver Robot!! The robot, Evolver is like a real life version of Lazer Tag. Evolver is quick, very smart, and plays for keeps!!! There are 4 levels to play with him, and every level you beat him, he gets tougher and deadlier.

He also loves to play!!!! When Kyle, or his hot female team-mate Jamie played by Cassidy Rae do not feel like playing with him, he goes looking for others to challenge him!!!! He will do anything to make quick work of anyone who challenges him!!!!!

Only through sneaking up on him, and tricking Evolver is Kyle able to finaly nail the sucker!!

Evolver does get in some good kills!! Anyone who has seen the movie know what I mean!!!! John Delancie is one of those victims he finishes off by blowing up the Cybertronic Van!! BOOM!!

Only reason I watch this is for Cassidy Rae!!!! Thanks to this movie, I now am collecting all the movies she is in!!! She is truly gorgeous!! It's just fun watching her and Ethan team up to defeat this robot.

William H Macy who is also in Mr Holland's Opus who plays the principal gives Evolver is robotic voice!!

Similar robotic themed movies you might like are:: Short Circuit, and it's sequal with Johny 5!! I have them both!! Chopping Mall which are 3 security robots who go after some teens trapped in a mall trying to kill them!!! Have that one too!!!!!

Enjoy!",1174176000,,1574,4.5017543859649125
777172,3,6304042019,"...but can be fun if you view it with no expectations.  This 1995 sci-fi flick stars Ethan Randall (who is now Ethan Embry) as a whiz-kid teenager who wins a video game robot (Evolver) in a contest he rigs.  The Evolver was created by a scientist played by John DeLancie, who at one time was working on a similar robot for the Department of Defense.  Of course, this experiment went wrong and Evolver ended up shelved because it killed some soldiers in a test run.  Anyway, you know what to expect.  Evolver evolves into a killing machine who picks up suggestions for murder from watching tv programs, and soon Evolver is running rampant out to kill his ""enemies.""  Voiced by the marvelous William H. Macy, Evolver is reminiscent of the robot on tv's LOST IN SPACE in that he also develops his own sick sense of humor.  Director Mark Rosman keeps the pace interesting, and if everything has been done better since, EVOLVER is a moderately entertaining movie, a little too violent for small children, however.",1114646400,3,1008,4.693181818181818
7861042,5,6304042019,This was clearly the uncut version they never showed on Sci-fi. One of the things that puzzled me about Evolver was how he was able to look the way he did at the end in Round Four.,1483920000,,180,3.891891891891892

7861044,3,6304042019,"Old-school science fiction, the ""robots take over"" kind of a tale. Still, it was rather interesting. I did watch it all the way through, which is more than I can say of some of these movies on Prime.",1479168000,,199,4.2631578947368425

7861046,3,6304042019,"Hilarity reigns supreme in this 1995 movie about toy robots gone horribly awry. The ludicrous virtual reality video game graphics the film opens with give you a taste of things to come. We meet a couple of teenage boys who are hackers and one of them, Kyle Baxter (Ethan Randall), wins the ""Evolver"" robot in a video game contest. Evolver motors around the Baxter house much like a Roomba, although it is much less frightening to cats. It's basically a laser pistol game that earned its name by learning and letting its play evolve and improve as time passes. There are four levels of play, but I have one overriding question that I don't understand about Evolver on any level: if Evolver is extremely top heavy and on casters, why can't you simply escape him by going up a flight of stairs? Never, mind...suspension of disbelief and all that...

It takes Evolver only five minutes to go nuts on the first level, but nobody pays much attention. Oh, and also like a Roomba, Evolver is part vacuum cleaner as he hoovers around picking up the plastic balls he shoots. It will surprise nobody to learn that Evolver is actually a rebranded secret weapon that was passed over by the military because it was so unstable, unpredictable, and aggressive, but none of that matters, as the boys have a better use for Evolver: they send it into the girl's locker room to surreptitiously take pictures, but then it stumbles into the boy's locker room where we see the least realistic way to change clothes ever in a humiliating scene. Evolver in the meantime reloads with steel balls and gets his first confirmed kill.

It's all downhill from there: Evolver learns how to curse from watching too much television, meanwhile the heroic Kyle investigates Evolver a bit more and it becomes a teenage crimefighting drama for a while (where's Scooby Doo?) Zach is the bad kid trying to get Evolver's disc for his own nefarious purposes, and as part of this subplot we finally find out about Evolver's past as the defense project ""SWORD"" - Strategic War-Oriented Robotic Device, one of the most tortuous acronyms in movie or military history.  The kids have no problem finding the top secret files about SWORD, and they discover the project was abandoned because the robot went bananas and killed a bunch of people in a test. In the meantime Evolver starts to take the situation much more seriously as he loads cutlery in his tubes and stalks Kyle's little sister. Thank goodness for the rubber pool alligator toy defense! Kyle defeats Evolver on level three, and pushes it into a pool. Surely that will solve the problem. Forget the water in his circuitry; I'm trying to figure how he can get out of a pool on casters. As an aside, there is some really bad acting throughout the film, but I swear these pool scenes are the worst.

Kyle's family is now over this and calls to have Evolver removed. The specialists come and remove Evolver from the pool but wouldn't you know it, Evolver commandeers the van, kills the occupants, and escapes. Of course Evolver goes back to seek Kyle, a.k.a. ""Enemy 1"", and the dramatic conclusion involves a laser beam, a teddy bear, and a flaming bathrobe, but Kyle finally kills Evolver with a baseball bat to the head. What? Really? You're kidding right? Of course, Evolver only seems dead, but comes back for a ""Bonus Round"" and despite the conclusion involving a dramatic explosion, we're left unsure if it's really dead. That this is a plot device used about a zillion times in movies (especially in the '80s and '90s) is obvious, and is merely one more annoyance about an already annoying denouement.

""Evolver"" is not a good movie. In 1995 it was somewhat out in front of the ""computer as evil entity"" stage, but it has not aged well and the entire plot is hackneyed in the extreme, while the acting is terrible (not that the cast had much to work with), but in spite of itself this movie does have some entertainment value, though not in the way the filmmakers likely intended. If you want to see a genuinely suspenseful or scary movie, this is not it, but if you want to enjoy ironic laughter at the ridiculousness of a bad sci-fi movie, ""Evolver"" suits your needs perfectly.",1473552000,,4196,4.6802168021680215
