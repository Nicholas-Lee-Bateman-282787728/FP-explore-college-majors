1344328,5,B00004RLSC,"Sissi has been one of my favourite movies ever since i was a teenager. Although i still long to own the English-dubbed 3-tape sequels, this condensed version is near perfect with excellent translation & picture quality. Even my husband enjoys watching it with me, to my surprise, and I would recommend it to all the ladies that love Romy Schneider and the splendid scenery of Austria, Bavaria & the Mediterranean.",1168128000,17,413,4.914285714285715
1344329,5,B00004RLSC,"I'm Austrian, so the first time I saw the movie was at the age of 8. I am now 20 and still in love with this movie. Everyone who has ever been to Vienna and has visited the Schloss Sch?nbrunn (where Sissi and Franz governed)will see that they produced the film in exactly the same rooms.

I am very proud of this film and it is sad that there is no english translation because otherwise you would also get the great fun this movie makes. So everyone with some experience in the German language will love it and for the others, there are still the subtitels and the views alone are worth buying it!",1146096000,5,597,4.2368421052631575
1344330,3,B00004RLSC,"I bought the first two installments of this three-part chick flick as a gift for my mother, who wanted it after a girlfriend recommended it.  Mom is annoyed with the broken-English subtitles, which were obviously done by someone with a limited knowledge of English.  For example, the translator consistently uses the pronoun ""anyone"" when he means ""no one"" and conversely uses ""nobody"" when he means ""anybody"".  I watched the film with Mom so that I wouldn't have to try to return two DVD's that had been opened, while trying to convince someone that the subtitles are ungrammatical.  With my help in translating broken English to standard idiomatic Englsih, Mom enjoyed the story, which would touch most mothers.  I was unmoved by the premise of the story, but I enjoyed the lush scenery of the Bavarian and Austrian Alps, the unintentional humor of the subtitles, and the intentional physical humor in the character of an incompetent Austro-Hungarian policeman.",1135814400,8,963,5.10828025477707

1344368,2,B00004RLSC,"Those movies are a bad copy and barely I could see final part because the dvds were in bad condition, and I tried in three different dvd players, the cost was very high compare with the same product here, I paid these cost to have the spanish translation and this was the result.",1326067200,10,279,4.283018867924528
1344369,2,B00004RLSC,"SISSI LA TRIGOLOGIA (SISSI, SISSI EMPERATRIZ, EL DESTINO DE SISSI) from Cinefilo2010

This assembled collection of three films is particularly curious, for how different is one from another. This is the explanation:

The first one SISSI, the video is acceptable, but the translation to Spanish does not match the CC in Spanish. It looks like somebody did the translation from German, and another person/entity did the CC in Spanish direct from the German not from the Spanish version. The size of the letters in the CC is HUGE.

The second, SISSI EMPERATRIZ the video is acceptable as the first one, the CC has the same problem as the SISSI, and additional to this the film should last 101 minutes (even that the box of this one says 102 minutes) and actually last less than 90 minutes. This is unacceptable.

The third one EL DESTINO DE SISSI is the best of all. The video is OK, the audio, and the CC is completely different from the others two; the letters are smaller, in light grey, not the yellowish as the first and second. This is OK.

Another point apart of the issues above mentioned, is that a set like this collection should be equally formatted, translated, and CC in order to be a collection (Not collectible), The SISSI TRILOGY, and it is not in such conditions.

An additional note for the seller; I bought together with this one 11 films. From them 9 were in good condition, one is unacceptable, and this one has these issues form which I want my money back including the S&H, in spite that I remain interested in acquiring this Trilogy with Spanish or English translation and CC.

I tried to get my refund but unfortunately I have not succeeded so far, and more unfortunately is that Amazon has done nothing to help me in spite that is aware of this situation. Cinefilo2010 has not even bother verifying what I mentioned above, may be because Cinefilo2010 knows that it is true. This is so stupid that in this way they (both Cinefilo2010 and Amazon) loose customers for 20 or 30 dollars. This is a fair assessment without a shadow of magnification or personal feelings. I do not recommend using Cinefilo2010. I'll be very cautious making business with Amazon if Amazon does not verify the ethics of their associates, like Cinefilo2010.

Respectfully Yours,

1344370,1,B00004RLSC,"I had recently watched the German language version with English subtitles in Netflix; and I wanted one dubbed in Spanish, or with Spanish subtitles, for my mother to watch.  Even though the sound quality and the Spanish translation were OK, the quality of the video was incredibly poor.  Not only was it grainy at times, but it was like watching the copy of a VHS tape (maybe it was!)  If you consider that I paid $90 for the 3 CDs, it was really a rip off!",1304467200,9,457,4.290697674418604
1344371,5,B00004RLSC,"Romy Scneider never looked more beautiful than in the role of the gorgeous Empress Elizabeth of Austria.
The movie is the first in a series of three movies recounting the tragic, fascinating life of this beautiful empress that eclipsed all others in Romantic allure. The first time we see Sissi in this film she is riding her horse at the family castle in Bavaria and her father encourages her to jump over the hedge of roses, while her mother disapproves. She is shown as a high spirited, beautiful and romantic young girl in the film which concentrates only on her visit to Bad Ischl where she accompanied her sister Helene with the prospect of her inminent engagement to the young emperor of Austria, Francis Joseph, but he falls in love with Sissi instead. She literally catches him with her fishing rod as the hook entangles in his uniform when he is passing in an open carriage. This scene may seem like a scene form a Vienese operetta, and the silliness of the guards and the secret service in particular, almost give the movie the flavor of an operetta. Karlheinz Bhm is very convincing as the young emperor and Vilma Degischer is appropriately bitter and snobish as the dowager empress,  Archduchess Sophie, who is also Franz Josef's mother. Sissi's parents are excellently played by Magda Schneider as her mother, Duchess Ludovika and Gustav Knuth as the boisterous Duke Max of Bavaria. Uta Franz looks beautiful as her sister, Princess Helene (Nene) but she has the charm of a wooden beam, and one is not surprised that the young emperor treated her with the same interest as if she were a Meissen vase and went instead for the fiery, lively Sissi. In the film later on Nene comes back to Bavaria happily accompanied by a Prince Thurn und Taxis that looks obviously gay, and which one would think is the same Prince Thurn und Taxis that was King Ludwig of Bavaria's first lover, but it is a different one, he married Nene and they actually had a very happy life together.
The court dresses and jewelry are wonderfully detailed in this movie and Sissi actually wears an outfit very similar to one that was recorded in paintings of the empress. This movie will leave you with the sensation of having eaten a chocolate tart with a glass of champagne, without the worries of calorie intake, a true entertaining joy.",1261526400,2,2322,4.705159705159705

1344373,5,B00004RLSC,"The first time I have seen all the films was when I was very small, now I'm 20 and still love them. Mainly because of the beautiful dresses. Sissi also gives slight details on how it was back when they governd and I am very interested in this since I am Austrian.
