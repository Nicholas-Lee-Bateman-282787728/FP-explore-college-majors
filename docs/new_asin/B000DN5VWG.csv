2475235,5,B000DN5VWG,"Bought this for my 3 year old granddaughter when she was 2.  She loves My Little Pony videos and play items.  She knows all their names and takes them all in the tub when its time for her bath.  My Little Pony videos are great not only whimzical, colorful, but helpful in teaching children how to treat others.",1326844800,,310,4.310344827586207
2475236,5,B000DN5VWG,"The first one we bought was Pony Puppy, and the Knight Shade/Shadow stealer episodes were almost painful to watch.  This was a nice change of pace.  As I watched, certain scenes actually made me remember watching them as a kid.  I would recommend it to anyone!",1265932800,,260,4.608695652173913
2475237,5,B000DN5VWG,My daughters love My Little Pony and the DVD cartoons don't disappoint whether they are the new version or the '80s versions.,1252627200,,125,4.7272727272727275
2475238,5,B000DN5VWG,"This was a series I loved to watch as a child, and now the younger members of my family love to watch it as well. This was definately worth the time and money.",1168732800,,159,3.8484848484848486
2475239,1,B000DN5VWG,"Warning to parents: This DVD has new cover art and carries a release date of 2006 in the Amazon listing, which both lead you to believe that this is one of the new Paramount MLP releases.  Be warned that THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  This DVD is repackaged versions of two of the original 1980's Sunbow cartoons from the TV series.  As a parent, this means that they pre-date the FCC programming standards for children.  The content on this DVD is troubling if you care about positive modeling and concepts for your child.  In the first episode, the ponies are forcibly kidnapped and endure slave labor, and the bad guy cronnies plot to kill the evil princess.  In the second story, some of th ponies steal precious treasures from other peoples to bribe the bad troll.

And the original Subow art and animation was really crappy to boot!

If you're looking for the pro-message, thoughtful content of the recent paramount releases, this ain't it.",1146700800,22,938,4.676829268292683
2475240,2,B000DN5VWG,"I love that this attempt to milk MLP fans for all their worth comes complete with new artwork on the cover that actually reflects the contents, but seriously, do we need another DVD of the same episodes that are in the box set? I sincerely doubt it. Although this DVD may be a low cost way to relive some of our cherished childhood it does not justify the expense particularly when most DVDs created today have at least four episodes per disc.

Maybe they should have focused on creating new artwork for prints instead of creating new DVDs of the same thing. I do not suggest you buy this item, sell out the cash for a copy of the First Season instead it will save you money.",1145404800,14,675,4.31496062992126
2475241,2,B000DN5VWG,"My 3yr. old loves My Little Pony, so I bought this DVD...She asked me to turn it off because it was scary. I also, was disapointed when I got it in the mail and saw that it was made in 1986 and on the descrition it said 2006.",1140566400,14,225,3.7083333333333335
