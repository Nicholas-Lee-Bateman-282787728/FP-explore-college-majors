8284220,1,B001BP14D0,"You are probably wondering why I didn't give this such a great review. Well it isn't because the episodes are bad  its mainly because it was in volume . I originally used to watch  the DVDs  in volumes because I figured they were cheaper  than the seasons. But I figured out that  the bleach volumes will come to an end much like Naruto shupudden volumes.  So I  recommend you purchase the bleach uncut box set 3  which collects all of the episodes of the rescue arc, if you are just starting  to watch bleach .  But you'll have  to watch episodes on volumes 23-26  to see the whole bount arc .",1404950400,,594,4.252252252252252

8284222,5,B001BP14D0,"I love Bleach, and since Hitsugaya was my favorite I decided to get it.

The DVD has the episodes where Momo fights Hitsugaya cause the thinks he was the one that killed Aizen, and then Hitsugaya fights Gin. I loved this fight and it had me so excited while I was watching it. This DVD also has the episode where they decide to movie Rukia's execution date up and when Rukia has a flash back of someone that was very close to her...

Also when I got this DVD it came with stickers which made it ever better ^^

8284223,5,B001BP14D0,I dig this anime from the charters to the story lines and yes even the filler arc's. For those who do not know a filler arc is where the story leaves the manga. This would be the after rukia's attempted rescue. they way this anime moves along with the story and the fact that the subtitled epi's are as good if not better than the dub epi's. this show is very intresting when you learn all the key players! well worth adding to a collection. though it's very much still on going with over 200+ epi's out in japan and more being made as i type this.,1252540800,,548,4.130841121495327

8284225,5,B001BP14D0,"Of all the volumes of ""Bleach"" thus far, the twelfth is the first to focus almost exclusively on the Soul Reapers, not on our odd little band of heroes.

In fact, we get two whole episodes of solid backstory for the various Soul Reapers we've become attached to -- and in the present, the captains are suspecting each other and unearthing the roots of a very nasty conspiracy. It may start off on a rosy, mildly humorous note, but the story becomes progressively grimmer right up to the truly tragic ending.

As the three lieutenants Renji, Momo and Kira all sit in prison for different reasons, we see a flashback to their early days at the Soul Reaper Academy. They were among the elite students, and so ended up on a special field trip that Shuhei Hisagi was leading -- which went horribly wrong when a horde of enormous Hollows appeared, attacking the older trainee. They were only saved by the arrival of two very familiar Soul Reapers...

When Momo escapes from her cell, Hitsugaya goes after Gin Ichimaru, intent on killing him before Momo can do it herself. But when Momo arrives she attacks ""Li'l Shiro"" instead, claiming that her beloved Captain Aizen identified him as a destructive traitor. Hitsugaya must somehow subdue his hysterical friend without killing her -- just before he turns his ice sword's awesome power against Gin.

And then a shocking announcement is made: Rukia's execution is set for the next day -- and Ichigo hasn't yet reached bankai. As her death approaches, Rukia thinks back on a terrible event many years ago, when she befriended Captain Ukitake's lieutenant, Kaien Shiba. But

There's always been a dark undertone to many of ""Bleach's"" characters, since most of them have lost someone to the Hollows. But the twelfth volume explores what people will do for or to the people they love -- Hitsugaya is all too willing to kill to protect his closest childhood friend, and Rukia is haunted by the night when she killed Kaien.

It's really a very dark string of episodes, reaching its climax in the exploration of just how Rukia killed Ganju's older brother. The episode is filled with dark forests, mad laughter, and splatters of gore -- including one moment where Ukitake starts hacking up blood -- only make it worse. But Kaien's greenish ""Hollow"" face is perhaps the most ghastly of all.

So unsurprisingly most of ""Bleach's"" trademark humor is missing, although there are a couple funny moments like Renji kicking Rukia in the butt. Instead, the plot is devoted to the characters' backstories, some spectacular action scenes (Hitsugaya's zanpakuto is awe-inspiring), and the ongoing efforts to uncover the conspiracy within the Seireitei. Who is the traitor, and what do they want?

Ichigo and his friends don't have much presence in these episodes, so most of the character development belongs to Hitsugaya. We get to see this child prodigy's curt efficiency and his passionate loyalty, as well as a stormy ice dragon attack that outdoes every other Soul Reaper's thus far. And we get to see how Momo, Kira and Renji became fast friends, and how Momo's infatuation with Aizen began.

The twelfth volume of ""Bleach"" is building the arc to a stunning climax, with plenty of conspiracy, tragedy, blood, and the occasional killer ice dragon. And it promises to get even better.",1216771200,,3312,4.879003558718861
