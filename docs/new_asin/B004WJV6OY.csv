4487237,5,B004WJV6OY,"If you've always wanted to see one of Eddie's solo concerts but have not been able to (like me), this is the next best thing! A really nice, intimate show, well shot and edited.",1307145600,5,177,4.235294117647059
4487238,5,B004WJV6OY,"A few years ago Pearl Jam put out by far their best DVD with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Immagine-in-Cornice-Live-In-Italy/dp/B000UNYK76/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Immagine in Cornice - Live In Italy</a>. I like how this solo DVD is similar to that one in the way that it doesn't just film the concert itself. The film makers have put some effort into showing Eddie performing out in nature scences. It keeps things interesting.",1306972800,,475,6.4375
4487239,5,B004WJV6OY,Totally Awesome.  Totally Awesome.  You will want to watch it over and over again!  Acceptable for anyone who likes music.  The two bonus cover songs: ALL ALONG THE WATCHTOWER and BLACKBIRD in the dvd EXTRAS are indeed a bonus!,1306886400,,227,4.743589743589744
4487240,5,B004WJV6OY,"If you love Pearl Jam get this. While there are no acoustic versions of well known Pearl Jam songs here, what is here is stunning. You really get to see what a great singer and a surprisingly good guitar player Eddie is. You also get to see what a great songwriter he is with alot of the into the wild material performed here as well as two great Dylan covers. The behind the scenes stuff is cool and the stories Eddie tells between songs are really good. The sound is excellent and it was shot really well, with good close-ups of what he's doing on the guitar. You can probably learn how to play alot of these songs by watching this.",1306800000,5,634,4.24793388429752
4487241,5,B004WJV6OY,"Very nice mix of tunes from Ukulele Songs and Into the Wild.  Just Eddie and his guitar.  What can be better than that?

4487274,5,B004WJV6OY,"An essential for any Eddie Vedder/Pearl Jam lover. This is strictly an Eddie Vedder DVD, but PJ fans will appreciate the songs (and will most likely recognize the songs) as well. Recorded live over a couple of performances, this is a fantastic DVD that I can't get enough of. Again, a true gem for those who appreciate the softer/acoustic side of EV.",1461369600,3,350,4.661290322580645

4487300,5,B004WJV6OY,"My wife and I really enjoyed watching this video one night when the kids were at grandmas!  Good sound, good selection of songs AND, as always, Eddie Vedder puts on a great show.  Don't forget to watch the bonus track stuff (All along the watchtower)",1399680000,,250,4.533333333333333

he would release more stuff!! Highly recommend this to anyone...",1391385600,,249,5.097560975609756

4487316,5,B004WJV6OY,I received this as a Christmas present from my wife - we are both enormous PJ fans and much enjoyed Eddie's solo work. We both also very much agree with his philosophy and believe him to be a truly heroic person in the way he has kept his humility and decency after enormous success. This DVD features a brilliant live show from Eddie that will prove a treat for all fans.,1388448000,3,372,4.253521126760563

4487318,5,B004WJV6OY,"Finally watched this while flying over the western US, which makes a good backdrop for Ed's music. If you have a remote interest in Pearl Jam or Eddie Vedder, buy this. If you like the PJ song, Arc, you're in for a bigger treat. Ed's version of Arc on this DVD pushes the song into a layered prayer, a hymn. It's worth the price of the DVD and then some. Now...Ed, please release these audio files as a standalone soundtrack. Please...",1374883200,3,435,4.382716049382716
4487319,5,B004WJV6OY,"Very good dvd, I imagine how is the blu-ray. The soundtrack and quality of the audio are incredible and we've got Eddie Vedder in his top form playing almost all the instruments and singin' all of his best solo songs.",1374192000,,217,4.45
4487320,5,B004WJV6OY,Any EV fan would surely enjoy this mix of great music and video. Kudos to the film editor. Great job!,1372809600,,101,4.1

4487343,5,B004WJV6OY,I bought this for my husband (huge Eddie Vedder fan) and he loves it!  This is probably his favorite video.  It's pretty awesome!,1362700800,,129,4.565217391304348
4487344,5,B004WJV6OY,This DVD is a close look at the man Eddie Vedder has become. A beautiful philosophy and lovely music. Thanks.,1359590400,2,109,4.5
4487345,5,B004WJV6OY,Good audio and video quality. Eddie is the King! I recommend to anyone who like good music and great spirit.,1357862400,2,108,4.45
4487346,5,B004WJV6OY,Fantastic performance from one of the greatest songwriters today.  Some great covers as well. Wish there was more camera shots from away.  Too many neck and above shots. Small point though.,1355097600,,189,5.064516129032258
4487347,5,B004WJV6OY,Someone should follow Eddie Vedder with a video camera every day. Loved the insight into the man and his music.,1354233600,,111,4.6
4487348,5,B004WJV6OY,"Love this DVD, again watched it many times and enjoy it each time.
Would recommend this to all.  Eddie Vedder is truly a great performer.",1353715200,2,137,4.48
4487349,5,B004WJV6OY,"This was an excellent concert CD. This is the first time I heard of Eddy Vedder,when I heard the sound track of, into the wild I had to have it. Since I liked it so much, I thought I would try something else by him. I was not disappointed.",1332892800,2,239,3.8979591836734695
4487350,5,B004WJV6OY,"Can you name another iconic rock star who could pull off a performace like this one? I for one, think that Eddie Vedder's genuine personality and honest ability make him one of the very few who can. He comes out on the stage looking like the guy setting up to play on some street corner, but then he ends up touching and connecting to his audience in a profound way. Yeah, he's the guy from Pearl Jam, but on this stage he's even more of the real deal. Nothing comes across as flashy or pretentious. What he does is genuine and it's from the heart. And it is amazing.",1332806400,10,567,4.2110091743119265
4487351,5,B004WJV6OY,"Excellent DVD with Eddie, you feel like you get to be up close and personal with him and his incredible voice and music.",1330300800,,120,4.260869565217392
4487362,5,B004WJV6OY,"That's all I'm saying. Otherwise, it's a great disc.
I can't wait to see Eddie perform some of these songs on his upcoming tour.",1330128000,,128,4.375
4487363,5,B004WJV6OY,"Beautiful this DVD, Eddie is a very charismatic, to say that this movie is a perfect blend of stand up comedy and a great musician! Buy!",1329264000,,136,4.269230769230769
4487364,5,B004WJV6OY,"AMAZING !!!  I was actually at this show in D.C.---cost a fortune for tickets.....but it's a really spiritual and mystic experience to watch this video.  It really helped me get back in touch with my earthy roots and the quality is excellent.  One objection I did have was that a LOT of Eddie's dialogue was edited out; I imagine for space, but he said some really funny stuff that night and was talking about things at home like when he was working on the music and explaining to his daughter stuff about ""Into the Wild""......per comments she was making to her dad (Ed)...in a typical toddler way....that was funny....and the soldier who was there that was brought out on stage....overall an excellent representation of Eddie Vedder solo live, minus his rocking band Pearl Jam......He proves that he can rock the house even acoustically and quietly, which I actually appreciated because it was NICE to be able to SIT in my seat and SEE the show as opposed to straining over top of people's heads to view the stage like when I see Pearl Jam.  He requested that people sit and keep it mellow as he had been to the 9:30 club earlier in the day for a music contest of some sort that featured a lot of screaming teenage girls and he didn't want us to scream at the show because of it.  Some of that stuff is lost.....there are a few other comments he made that were funny, original and awesome that were NOT in the dvd, which i was disappointed about, but it does a fabulous job of the music portrayal, which to any fan of Pearl Jam and Ed, knows that's what it's all about for him anyway...I highly recommend this dvd for your viewing pleasure...You will NOT be disappointed.",1328572800,4,1672,4.5049504950495045
4487365,4,B004WJV6OY,"Es un trabajo magnifico, me parece que muestra a la persona plenamente, he logrado identificar la sensibilidad de este gran msico. Continuemos adelante haciendo lo que mas nos gusta as como Eddie lo hace.",1327363200,,204,5.029411764705882
4487366,5,B004WJV6OY,"we just love eddie vedder!  I don't think he could do anything wrong.  As long as he keeps singing and writing and we will keep buying, thanks ED!",1324857600,,146,4.178571428571429
4487367,5,B004WJV6OY,"Eddie Vedder is of the vanishing breed of real, committed and highly autentic persons in the biz. So this DVD comes as a welcome supplement to his solo works on CD, showing Vedder as the buddy you would wish to have, and as a man with both feet on the ground! Excellent!",1321228800,,270,4.211538461538462
4487368,5,B004WJV6OY,Bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday. He's been a PJ fan for as long as I remember. He loved it!,1320019200,,105,3.8181818181818183
4487369,4,B004WJV6OY,"If you like Eddie's solo stuff from both Into the Wild and Ukelele Songs, you'll love this performance.  It also gives Eddie a chance to show off his sense of humor and overall personality.  It feels like he's hanging out with the crowd rather than ""putting on a show"".  Just know that it is a totally acoustic and mellow  performance.  There are no full band, loud/fast songs.",1319500800,,377,4.567164179104478
4487370,5,B004WJV6OY,PERFECT! AWESOME FOR ANY EDDIE FAN!  AMAZING!!!!! I'm completely addicted to it! I love it so much!  this is absolutely mind blowing!,1318723200,,133,5.0
4487371,5,B004WJV6OY,"What can I say? He is just better and better... Loved the ""Blackbird""! Its amazing how he can work just as good by himself in a quite intimate setting... A true artist!",1316390400,,168,4.28125
4487382,4,B004WJV6OY,"I really thought it was the footage of the last tour. As it turns out, it was recorded on the 2008 tour.",1312156800,,104,3.772727272727273
4487383,5,B004WJV6OY,"A whole DVD of Eddie unplugged. I didn't know what to expect, but I know that what I got exceeded my expectations!  There was beautiful visual footage, but my tendency is to close my eyes and focus solely on the music.  Vedder's voice is sweet but gravelly, powerful yet tender.  This product is a soothing choice.",1311292800,,314,4.571428571428571
4487384,5,B004WJV6OY,"""Water on the Road"" is an awesome CD.  Eddie Vedder is a very talented and versatile performer.  Great music!  And you don't have a guy in the seat next to you screaming ""EDDIE!!""  Just got back from seeing him in Phil. PA. where he sang a lot of this material.  He has come a long way from croud surfing, but I like it all! He's doing so much more and keeps producing awesome music.  You got to get this!",1310860800,,405,4.063291139240507
4487385,5,B004WJV6OY,"I'm a huge fan of Pearl Jam's early CDs...hit and miss on the last 3-4 for me.  That said, Eddie Vedder is a very engaging, talented musician with a huge heart and a bigger conscious.  The editing/recording of this show was done very, very well.",1309824000,,245,4.4222222222222225
4487386,2,B004WJV6OY,"Obviously, the music is great. Eddie is a wonderful singer and has become a very good guitarist in the last twenty years. However, the DVD is painful to watch. Way too many close ups of Eddie's face. This is not 1992 and we are not sixteen year old girls. The editing is rough and thoughtless. He stops to tell a pointless, self indulgent story while tuning a uke, and then goes directly into a song on his Martin acoustic? Amateurish. The songs that play while Eddie sits in his hotel room, brooding and writing? Embarrassing. I recommend looking around for audio recordings of his recent solo tour instead. And go buy Ukelele Songs, it's amazing.",1309651200,11,648,4.643478260869565
4487387,5,B004WJV6OY,"This is a great show.  Here's an updated track listing.  As is often the case with concert DVDs the song

4487388,5,B004WJV6OY,"Really entertaining and fun. The picture quality and sound are good also. PJ and Eddie never put out a disappointing product. My only gripe is that their newer bootlegs are CD-R's which I find to be a waste of money. But, over all they put out quality products.",1307491200,,261,4.458333333333333

4487390,5,B004WJV6OY,"Wow!  I just watched this entire DVD and I am blown away!  I probably have about 100 music DVD's but this one is very special.  The sound and picture are just excellent throughout and Eddie delivers a very intimate, great show.  I caught this tour in Albany, NY back in 2009 and enjoyed the show and hoped for a DVD and it's exceeded my expectations.  The DVD is probably more enjoyable than the show was as the concerts unfortunately drew in a ton of rowdy fans yelling through the whole show which admittedly sometimes is great fun, but these shows were for the most part acoustic and really deserved some quiet to hear the greatness.  The DVD takes care of this and you can really appreciate the great singing and playing Ed did for these shows.  The set list is great - ""Into The Wild"" is obviously featured heavily plus some great covers of Bob Dylan, The Beatles and Cat Stevens.  Pick this up immediately - you will not be disappointed.  It appears I'm the ninth reviewer, so far no one has put less than 5 stars on this - for good reason!",1307318400,30,1046,4.3782383419689115
4487391,5,B004WJV6OY,"I lived in Seattle when PJ hit in the early 90's and have been along for the ride ever since.  This DVD shows how much Eddie has developed and matured as an artist; he's a really 'earthy' guy.

My wife and I have listened to 'Into the Wild' to death, often playing it two or three times in a row in the car on road trips (Ukelele Songs will go into rotation now too), as well as PJ's 'Backspacer'.  Ed has moved into a very interesting musical space over the past few years, and he's a pleasure to listen to.

On the dvd...Ed does a fine and diverse setlist here, with nice dynamics in his performances.  He carries off the one-man show brilliantly, and the audience is loving and enthusiastic without being noisy or disruptive to the show (which Ed acknowledges to them, as this was an issue on occasion for the solo tour).

Excellent audio and camera work, and I liked the 'off stage' sequences as well.  Everything about this disc oozes Ed's artsy, earthy, and surfing ways.  He's such a laid-back cat...I enjoyed the scenes at the end with the fans on the street, and how he so prefers quiet accolades and thank you's to shouts of ""I LOVE YOU MAN!!!"" and requests for hugs.

Ed's sense of humor is on display here as much as his rich baritone and guitar/uke/mandolin skills.  Funny little anecdotes interspersed here and there, and delivered with a twinkle to his eye.

The way that he does his stage setup makes it feel so intimate, like he's playing just for you in his living room.

I can't wait to watch this again...it holds up to repeated views like ITW and Ukelele Songs and Backspacer do for repeated listens.  Cannot recommend highly enough for fans of Eddie Vedder.",1307318400,102,1679,4.483552631578948
