3717497,3,B001NFNFMG,"This movie does feature better than average acting for a low budget movie shot in Canada.  In fact compared to the many low budget horror flicks that I watch and enjoy, this  is a step up too many that  I have seen (and like).  It's a parasite movie that has it's roots in many others of it's type that have gone before.  There is a hot woman who is infected by the creature; but unlike the cover the tentacles don't come out her; but they do erupt out of several other people.  That's the way it is with cover art and movie posters of the past to this day.  They often aren't that exact.
Still as someone who watches old horror (1920's onward) to new ones, and real small non professional flicks from nowherevilles with real nontrained actors. (those are fine). I would say that this is enjoyable and done professionally as any studio would do it. That's why perhaps some people don't like it.  It can compete with higher budget movies due to the professional filming etc. They expect more than this can deliver.  It isn't a great horror movie or even worthy of theater release but it's not too bad for it's budget and it is fun enough for a watch.
IN fact it's way above the made to video attempts of many other little horror movies.  You have to be a fan of bad horror to see that this; while derivative of many other things that infect people movies; has got a higher production quality than many other movies of it's ilk.  Like someone said; 'it's above a sci fi movie of the week"" some of which are very good and of course some have less production values than this one.
I didn't find the characters behaviour to be unrealistic either considering the daily news reports in my town which read like the darwin awards of irrationally foolish and sometimes fatal behaviour.  So if you want a decent horror movie about a monster that infects people this will fit the bill.",1244851200,,1873,4.412790697674419
3717498,2,B001NFNFMG,"......It's not in the movie. So just for the record cover 10-movie 2. The film rips off ""The Hidden"" and David Cronenbergs ""Shivers"" a.k.a. ""They Came From Within"" where a parasitic creature passes from one host to another.  To pretend the makers of this film are ""original"" the creature enters the host through the bellybutton. Also the hosts become ravenously hungry and the one funny scene happens when a cop is invaded and he reaches for the donuts.

The movies major problem is despite an occassional burst of gore the movie is so lifeless and slow.",1239494400,32,554,4.760416666666667
3717499,3,B001NFNFMG,"Well, I think some here are being a little too harsh.  This certainly isn't a great movie, it's one step up from a Sci-Fi Channel original.  On the other hand it doesn't do anything terribly wrong either.

It's a thriller, not a real horror flick, so don't expect too many scares.  And it's a bit cheesy.  But I watch quite a few new horrors, and at last I didn't feel like turning it off!

Nah - not bad, not great.  The CGI'd monsters were cool....  Average.",1238889600,,460,4.267441860465116

3717501,1,B001NFNFMG,"Wowee, what a piece of crap this was.  So let me get this straight the ""hero"" of the movie witnesses a bloody death and runs away without calling police, 911, and/or an ambulance eventhough he had a pretty legitimate explanation for it all.

The ""heroine"" of the movie eventhough she has every reason to believe that the ""hero"" could be guilty of a terrible crime aides and abides his get away.

I know, I know, it's only a movie but the plot was to thin and unbelievable for me.

The whole movie is riddled with unbelievable scenarios, unbelievable acting, and an unbelievable plot.  Too bad.  I'm glad I got to see this one for free.",1235520000,10,635,4.478260869565218
3717502,2,B001NFNFMG,"Scourge isn't an original horror tale. It flows more like a science fiction piece and borrows heavily from such movies' as ""The Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", ""Slither"", and even a hint of ""The Matrix"". While it primarily seems to be a horror flick that features a sci-fi parisitic creature it has to be said that this movie is hardly scary. Sure, there are a few moments where tension started to mount but when it is pretty much a given as to what happens next there really isn't much of a release.
While I did find the main plot to be interesting I found that it was all bogged down by the shoddy acting and a rather ridiculous sub-plot that really didn't fit into the story at all. Basically, it goes like this. A young man and woman who used to be high school sweethearts, must team up to try and stop a creature that uses human hosts but can only stay in them for a certain amount of time before having to move on. (Hmmm... that sounds a little familiar, doesn't it?) When the host leaves the body, it does so in a fashion that leaves a corpse in a very bloody mess.
The way they try to stop it was laughable. One of the hosts was also laughable as well... intentionally, I believe. Several scenes lacked any realisim. (not that the movie is really all that realistic) When gunshots go off ina  crowded mall, I find it doubtful that patrons would just stand around screaming, but that is exactly what happens here. It is good to see that cliche' characters will always be around, even in a movie that tries to offer smarter heroes. The result isn't all that successful.
Add to that a conclusion that has become the cheapest finale in pretty much any horror flick and the fact that Scourge lived up to my not-so-good expectations is cemented. Hey, I wasn't expecting oscar cailbre stuff here... but I'd like a horror flick to scare me... and this one didn't. For the most part it entertained me... and I guess that has to count for something.",1235174400,10,1948,4.426183844011142

When I started to watch this flick at first I was disappointed and was going to turn it off but the plot grabbed me and dragged me in. I have seen a whole lot worse get a lot better treatment here, this is not one for the Oscars sure. But... Don't count it out either. They took an old idea re-worked it a bit gave it a twist and a turn and came up with a plot that will keep you entertained. And at the end of the day isn't that what we really watch movies for. Not artistic relevance or social awareness. We want the crap scared out of us or to cry or laugh or anything that puts us in some other story for an hour or two.

SPOILERS

The juxtaposition of the invasion of the demon or parasite followed quickly by all the belching and hiccuping cracked me up. For instance, the scene where the sheriff gets invaded by this thing that kind of looks like a cross between a big cockroach with snakes and a Venus flytrap and after this dramatic help me help me scene, everything falls silent and he goes hiccup.

The sheriff's niece underwent a complete makeover from the second she gets off the phone and her old BF's new GF has been destroyed. She shows up, presumably moments later, with a whole new look to inspect the burned out building (about which she seems to know more than she should--but that would have given the script some depth). She took time to wash her hair so it would be wet and frizzy and to go from preppy and made up to a kind of Debra Morgan look.  ""Go! Go!"" she says to the protagonist and instead of dropping him off and driving away she gets out of the car and goes too. ????

She also seemed to have an unusual way with illegible foreign language manuscripts and finding quiet spots while hungry, belching killers with their faces falling off raged through the town.

Sheriff again as they drive frantically after the ""suspect""...Cop driving: ""What HAPPENED back there?"" Sheriff: ""Just drive!"" (Burp!) ""I repeat, take no chances with this guy!"" (Burps) ""Where are those doughnuts?"" More belching. Sheriff's niece looking like Deb has somehow hidden herself on the floor in the back of the cruiser.

I mean I could not take this seriously, I'm sorry. How did Deb get her hands on a grimoire from 1776? However the grimoire was more interesting than the whole movie. From this they discover the thing like a demonic tapeworm cannot be destroyed by fire (after running over her uncle 3 times and setting him ablaze) but is teetotal. So they take off following the next host who is a gross press photographer. He goes into a bar and...fearful pranks ensue.

Anyway the guy from Interpol (who has helped in no way unless he left the grimoires around) also turns out to be this major bug exterminator, who shows up at the very end to roast it after it being drowned in the alcohol. Then there was a sort of Michael Myers ending.

The acting was really stagey. It wasn't all that bad of a concept for a B horror movie but all the belching, supersonic stomach rumbling and gas passing put it into the realm more of fratboy humor, and took away from the seriousness of any deaths.

Special effects are adequate (practical effects and CGI).  It's actually rather tame compared to some movies that are circulating today.

  A Demonic parasitic entity has survived several hundred years and is again lose upon a small town taking over bodies in an attempt to reproduce itself, entering through the victims bellybutton where the victim somehow doesn't even know that it has happened.

  The movie itself is really just a step above the sci-fi channel movies.  In that is is good for what it is, just don't expect a a Hollywood blockbuster.  The film has its blood and guts moments but throws in some comedy as well, proving that the movie never take itself very seriously.  From the burping and farting of the victims to the doughnut eating policeman feeding the parasite in his belly while rolling on a police chase.  A horror comedy that doesn't excel at either genre that well.

Just don't expect a masterpiece of a motion picture, and you will be satisfied.  If you like sci-fi channel quality movies this will be right up your alley.

3717762,1,B001NFNFMG,"Don't be taken in by the slick packaging (a cool DVD cover, a watchable trailer, and that famous voiceover) - this film is just terrible. It looks like it might be a great B-movie with good cinematography, acting, plot, etc etc.  However, once you see how that fireman reacts after he is attacked in the scene that you see in the trailer, the film immediately devolves to a pathetic attempt at horror comedy, but one that doesn't really mean to be funny...or scary. This is another example of how b-horror videos today are packaged so that they LOOK like something you'd really want to see. But when you get the DVD home and in your player, you just get angry that you were scammed once again with a C-horror film that looks like it was slapped together only to generate a small amount of cash flow or a tax write-off for the producers and investors. SKIP this one - you'll thank me later. Trust me, I bought it on Video on Demand. I'll never get that time or money back, unfortunately.",1269302400,9,986,4.447513812154696

Said slut is also cheating on Scott with a firefighter whom also has been infected by some supernatural creature that has been lying dormant in the basement of the local church. Much like ""The Hidden"" (a far and away superior film to this one in every way, shape, and form), the creature has to hop from body to body in order to survive.

This movie pretty much epitomizes the word 'cliche'. Boy from the wrong side of the tracks? Check Unrequiteled love between said bad boy and the daughter of a sheriff? Double Check. The plot is hugely uninspired and the acting doesn't fare any better. And while it may be technically true that this movie is better then the previous one by Writer/Director Jonas Quastel. That's only because that one was ""Ripper 2: Letters From Within"" which was complete and utter crap. This one is merely derivative and worthless.",1516492800,,1022,4.6464088397790055
