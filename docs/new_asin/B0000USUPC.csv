1946898,5,B0000USUPC,"The English do this sort of thing very well - a distinguished collection of authors of books on the Age of Sail gather to present an excellent examination of life at sea in the Age of Nelson. The documentary is enlivened with reconstructions from re-enactment groups and dramatic clips from the ""Hornblower"" series. The examination is very thorough and serves to dispel a few unfortunate myths about life at sea in the Eighteenth Century. The lead presenter, Richard Woodman, is a Naval Historian, former Captain (RN) and author of the Nathaniel Drinkwater series. He speaks with authority and enthusiasm. I really enjoyed this documentary and will watch it again.

1946899,5,B0000USUPC,"An extremely interesting and entertaining film, which should be watched both by those who are lovers of this era in history and those who know nothing, but want to find out more.
Presented in an easy-to-follow manner by Richard Woodman (a naval author of very great standing) the film covers all aspects of naval life, with re-enactments aboard replica ships to give action to the words.
It is obviously a work of passion by the makers and presenters.  Those brought into the film to talk about their own specialist subjects are extremely knowledgeable and it's wonderful to hear their expert views on the many facets of the eighteenth century navy and Georgian life itself.
A ""must-buy"" for all lovers of and seekers of information on life in the sailing navy.",1069632000,15,761,4.8538461538461535
1946900,5,B0000USUPC,"If you have not seen Master & Commander as yet, buy this and watch it first. If you have seen Master & Commander buy this to tide you over until Master & Commander is released on DVD.
 It's a very well-produced and narrated documentary that literally takes you below decks in His Majesty's Royal Navy. The expert commentary and ship footage bring the Royal Navy to life for beginners and experienced sea lovers. My whole family enjoyed it.
 Plus if you're home schooling, it's a great field trip without leaving the house.",1069286400,8,522,4.663043478260869

8003190,4,B0000USUPC,"I thought this was a decent introduction to the age of fighting sail and the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic wars especially. There is a lot of good information in this DVD which both informs and dispels many an old rumor.

The DVD begins by giving the strategic picture in Europe during this time period with Napoleon firmly in control of the continent while Britain, protected by the Royal Navy, was his nemesis. The video covers the type of battles that occurred at sea, not only between fleets of ""ships of the line"", but also between frigates and sloops.

There are a lot of good topics covered by this DVD: the types of ships and their construction, weapons, rigging, etc. The types of men who served the Royal Navy were covered fairly well with a discussion of officers and how they joined the RN as well as needing patronage from a higher rank to advance. The discussion of crewing the ships was covered quite well including about impressment. The DVD even covered the Marines and their primary purpose aboard ship - to prevent mutiny.

This video covered the kind of combat that took place aboard ship whether the ship-to-ship cannon duels or the hand-to-hand fighting during boarding. Many good topics were covered which most people don't usually think about including the food the men ate, the medical care they received and the works and punishments aboard ship.

I took a star away from this documentary because, firstly, they did not include fighting US Navy ships during the war of 1812 in which the Royal navy experienced embarrassing defeats and, secondly, the DVD took on the appearance of an ""infomercial"" for the authors narrating or presenting this DVD with them actually ""plugging"" their own works.

These are relatively minor criticisms and I think, in balance, the DVD was both entertaining and enlightening as to the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Era. I recommend this DVD with four stars.",1375488000,,1918,4.853211009174312
8003191,4,B0000USUPC,"I was interested after watching ""Master & Commander"" in learning more about the age of sail during the 19th century. This video was all I had hoped it would be. It discusses many aspects of life at sea during the Napoleonic period of England's history, including - but not limited to - rations, shipboard life, discipline, ""conscription,"" etc. A worthwhile purchase for lovers of seafaring novels and movies.",1357257600,,408,5.014705882352941
8003192,3,B0000USUPC,This is sort of a documented history of sailing before the mast using modern replicas and living history reenactors and traditional interpreters. I enjoyed the DVD but I did not think it valuable to keep in my library so I passed it on to other sailing ship enthusiasts.,1262044800,,270,4.645833333333333
8003193,4,B0000USUPC,A good DVD.  There is a lot of information here if you wonder about the old days of sail.,1223856000,,89,3.6842105263157894
8003194,5,B0000USUPC,"This is a ""First Rate"" introduction to the British Navy of Nelson's time, explaining the roles played by various personnel and taking us around the only surviving frigate of those times which only just missed taking part in the war.  In the hour or so the story takes we get a fair idea of the building, running and fighting of a man-of-war as well as an understanding of the type of men in the crew and those who commanded her. Many myths are dispelled as the result of more recent research which, for example, has tended to re-assess brutality as depicted in many reminiscences of the time. Also the quality of food appears to be better than we have previously been led to believe, although there is a slight divergence of opinion between two of the authorities who speaking here on the subjects of food and drink. Even the press gang has its status raised.
There is also information on the administration of the navy and on the building of ships.  In short a lot of concise information very well presented.
For those who read the exploits of the popular fictional heroes it is well to be reminded that there is life beyond Jack Aubrey in the shapes of Bolitho, Ramage, Kydd, the great Hornblower and my own favourite Nathanial Drinkwater whose author is the main narrator and writer of this highly recommended sea adventure.
The assembled authorities who pilot us through this history are all masters (and one mistress) of their various crafts.

8003195,3,B0000USUPC,"I was very happy to finally receive my copy and started out with high hopes. Unfortunately it did not show enough of the living conditions aboard the vessels of this time period. We were given a brief view of the Captains quarters and all of the comfort but never got to see the gun decks, galley or living conditions for the average sailor. To much time was spent on various authors hawking their novels.

Sailors lives were tough in those days and not just aboard the First Rates but the smaller craft. I was hoping to see more of this. Very disappointed!!",1162512000,6,558,4.470588235294118
8003196,3,B0000USUPC,"Like a fool I ordered this sight-unseen, hoping that it would be at least an hour of delicious footage of actual ships under sail.

Instead, it turned out to be one talking head after another, with tantalizing glimpses of ships.

The director seems to have dredged up every last single Ph. D. in England with a pulse who knows anything at all about the golden age of the Royal Navy, and in this video they talk, and talk, and talk, and talk, and talk, and talk until you are praying for a 32 pounder carronade loaded with grapeshot and fired at close range to kill or mangle all of them.

The only exception is Captain Richard Woodman.  When he is showing us around a ship, there is a chance that my high school students could actually refrain from throwing things at the screen - but he disappears all too quickly, to be replaced by yet another professor extruding endless run-on sentences full of five-syllable words, usually with something inanimate, like a clock tower, in the background.

Along with the animated and passionate Captain Woodman, the reinactors are quite entertaining, and they are obviously true believers who are dedicated to their cause.  The glimpses of 18th century life are also very valuable, but once more one has to wade through an endless fogbank of professorial monologue to get to them.

If only the director had relegated the professors to a ""bonus materials"" section, and had instead filled this DVD with lots and lots of ship footage.  Aerial shots, on deck shots, below-decks shots, shots from the rigging, and of course ACTUAL cannon being actually fired, instead of just smoking and being yanked backwards out-of-synch by a cord.  Record those actual cannon in THX sound so that we can really smack ourselves with the bass wallop, like in ""Master and Commander"" or ""Gettysburg.""

We Age of Sail nuts don't want talking heads!  We want to see a real frigate putting on enough sail to put a bone in her teeth!  We want to see her heeling over a bit on a quartering breeze!  We want to see the dolphins jumping in front of her!  We want to see seasoned topmen scrambling up her rigging and shinnying down again.  We want to see a real ship being worked by real sailors in real weather on the real open ocean.  Give us an hour of that, and if nobody says a d**n thing the whole time, THAT'S EVEN BETTER!

This DVD could have been brilliant - but all the talk got in the way.",1156723200,16,2408,4.562790697674418
8003197,5,B0000USUPC,"This DVD is an excellent introduction into the Royal Navy in the Age of Sail. It lasts a little over an hour, not including the extra features.  The program is hosted by Richard Woodman, the author of the Nathaniel Drinkwater novels.  It includes the usual interviews with historians and the program is livened up with clips from the Hornblower movies.  The topics include a detailed discussion of frigates, ship construction, provisioning and outfitting a ship, life of ship, armaments and hand weapons, and authors talking about their characters. The extras include a host of the HMS Endeavor (Cook's ship), the Articles of War, and resources for further study.  I learned a good amount and enjoyed the presentation.  Anyone interested in the age of sail should have a look at this DVD",1130976000,10,787,4.977099236641221
