2616665,2,B000GRUQZQ,"Most fans of William H. Macy will love him in the role of Edmond Burke, and his character portrayal certainly has its merits. With those puppy-dog eyes, many will feel a touch of empathy for a mostly unempathetic character in EDMOND, a film from horror master Stuart Gordon (director of RE-ANIMATOR and the newer KING OF THE ANTS).

Macy isn't unfamiliar with the dark side of cinema. His role as the sexually inadequate Little Bill in BOOGIE NIGHTS cemented his acting career. But he's moved on to ""brighter"" pastures with the warm-and-fuzzy PLEASANTVILLE and his stunningly excellent Sheriff Chappy in HAPPY TEXAS. That Macy reinvests himself on the shadowy side won't bother anyone, but Edmond's script surely will.

Where the film fails is in its beginnings. Edmond Burke seems like a regular Joe leaving work when he's handed a Post-It note with a change in time for an appointment tomorrow. On it is scrolled the time of 1:15. He heads home and has a confusing argument with his wife (Rebecca Pidgeon, SHOPGIRL). He explains that he's emotionally and sexually unattracted to her and then promptly leaves. This is where the film has its biggest problem. We're never privy to Edmond's previous life experiences and so don't know why he feels this way. There appears to be no motivation for his leaving. He just ...does, and we're supposed to, somehow, understand it. And this lost understanding will plague the rest of the film for viewers.

Edmond heads out into the night and comes upon a fortune teller who tells him ""You're not where you should be."" The rest of the film is relegated to finding out ""where"" he's supposed to be and constantly running into the 1:15 reference, a personal omen. What he finds is an unleashing of pent up sexual desire, anger, bigotry and murder. Edmond has had some sort of psychotic break but, again, the audience wasn't privy to his life before this night so have no gauge to tell why this has happened. He's just ""going crazy"" and the audience is supposed to go along with it. The 1:15 omen pops up at dangerous intersections, as do visions of the fortune teller's tarot cards, sinking Edmond deeper and deeper into a pit of no return.

Scripting problems aside, there's no damning comments to made about Macy's performance. He's in topnotch psycho-mode and it is this that will keep people watching.",1160179200,3,2341,4.8159203980099505
2616666,3,B000GRUQZQ,"Mamet's EDMOND offeres an interesting irony: Edmond, played wonderfully by William H. Macy, is dis-satisfied with his life, bored. A card-reader tells Edmond he's in the wrong place, so he leaves his wife and begins a search for fulfillment. But Edmond's on the wrong track: he wanders from frustration to frustration feeling as if he's the only one who is sane. Edmond's rambling monologues show a mind rapidly dissembling, until he commits the ultimate act and must pay the consequences. And then comes the irony... Well, at least Edmond is no longer bored.

This is an interesting concept, but the dialogue is clipped and wooden, except that is for the rants of Edmond. The movie's a bit slow moving, but interesting all the same.",1160006400,4,733,4.911290322580645
2616667,3,B000GRUQZQ,"There is a problem with having a track record.  People expect you to be able to recreate magic anytime you step up to the plate (how's that for mixing metaphors?).  I saw this DVD on the shelf at Blockbuster, and when I saw it was from the person that wrote one of my favorite movies (Glengarry GlenRoss), and starred one of my favorite actors William Macy, I couldn't get to the checkout counter quick enough.

Where Glengarry GlenRoss was one of the best written, best acted films with the most diverse and accomplished ensemble cast ever to be contained in a single title, Edmund was mostly a one man show where the people that that character encountered where used almost as props for his dialog and actions.  Macy is great (as always), but I never felt the empathy for him that I did for Jack Lemmon's down on his luck Shelly ""the machine"" Levene in Glen'.  I never felt hatred for any of the others on the screen like I did for Kevin Spacey's office boss character.  I really couldn't care less for any of the people in the movie.

There was one scene early in the film that had a familiar feel with Glen', where Macy was drinking and chatting with a stranger in a bar after having just walked out on his wife.  This was classic Mamet back-and-forth, and was right up there with Pachino's Ricky Roma working his mark to get him to sign on the line in Glen'. I was feeling good about the film at that point, but that encounter passed and it lost the Mamet vibe for me for the rest of the movie.

This was not a bad film, but I expected more based on the pedigree.  Like I said, having a track record can be a good thing, or it can remind the viewer how far you might be from your peak.  When I wish to introduce the uninitiated to Mamet (and terrific acting), I'll pull out my copy of Glen' and show how well the written word can be rendered on-film.",1159920000,,1855,4.271428571428571

2616695,3,B000GRUQZQ,"EDMOND is the ultra-violent tale of an otherwise gentle soul who, based on the advice of a fortune teller, leaves his wife and explores the less savory areas of NYC. He ultimately meets one-too-many bad guys on Manhattan's seamier streets.

First Edmond Burke (Macy) catches a beating from a three-card monte scammer and crew, then he successfully bests a mugger. For no reason other than boiling-blood craziness, he brutally stabs a young waitress to death in her apartment. The jailed killer is forced to become his cellmate's boyfriend.

2616696,5,B000GRUQZQ,"I really liked this movie, but I think the ending sort of ruined it.
There could have been so many other possibilities to end this really good movie, yet the director chose to
make an example out of his ""Frustrated-White-Male"" leading character in not so brilliant way.
Needless to say, this is a great piece of American cinema. In my opinion, a movie that will be appreciated by viewers 10, 20, maybe 30 years from now...this movie stands as sheer example that America can still make ambitious, thought provoking, interesting cinema.
The movie border-lines on Falling Down (1993) with Michael Douglas and some gritty neo-noir flick.

And for the rest of the movie, the white male lead, has one violent altercation after another with black males, murders a white female, and threatens an older black female with a knife while he's riding the subway.

Toward the end of the movie (I won't give away the ending although I should spare others the pain of watching it) another black male victimizes him.

The movie, which was filled with the ugliest, racial stereotypes possible about black males, could have been a good movie had the creator, David Mamet, not revealed his own racist and sexual fantasies about black males, and what I believe is his secret wish to be sexually punished by black males for the crimes of all white males against them.

Edmond  (2005)  William H. Macy, Julia Stiles, Joe Mantegna, Frances Bay
Rated R.
A film for mature adults, in my opinion.
A little known indie that's off the beaten path and original.
Shocking and disturbing but fascinating.
Edmond is trapped in a world of personal frustration. He's not happy with his marriage. He's not happy with his job. He's not happy with himself or his life in any way and he doesn't know why.
And he doesn't seem to care why since his anger is all encompassing.
He is more than simply pent-up angry and unfulfilled.
Scam artists of the underworld sense his lack of fulfillment and try to take advantage.
His psychotic fury builds and builds.
Although basically mild mannered, he morphs into a ticking time bomb.
He delves into the dark world of so called men's entertainment. Strip clubs, peep shows and prostitution. But lust never seems to satisfy at any price.
Repressed rage must find an outlet, as it always will. And bottled up madness must unleash itself eventually.
The dark journey grows darker. It becomes nightmarish and menacing.
For some people like Edmond, life becomes a random absurdity.
BEWARE.
This film is hell bound and pushes way too many buttons for the casual viewer.",1357430400,4,1224,4.84688995215311
2616701,4,B000GRUQZQ,"William H. Macy is perfectly cast in this disturbing psychological portrait of a man living an inauthentic life, who descends into a hell of anger and violence that reveals his true self.  A must-see for fans of Macy and author David Mamet.",1353456000,,240,4.714285714285714
2616702,1,B000GRUQZQ,"Although the specs of House of Games weren't memorable (and now I'm even thinking it wasn't his, lol), remember liking it at the time.  And everyone was SUPPOSED to like Glengarry G.R.  At the time I was dating a M.F.A. film student, a mistake, btw).  So, I did watch this one.  It cracked me up--- in that it just threw into such stark relief all the pretension of the other work, and also seemed to further lay bare Mamet's mind, what he WANTS TO HAPPEN, what he fantasizes about, how he sees the figure of the white gentile man.  Ironically the Macy character was like watching an alter ego of Woody Allen, the dark side or something.  I actually came on to buy this film (originally I rented it) just to show it to other people for fun, like if we were having a slow night with company, like a kind of campy movie to have around.  Buying it to show it to others so you can stare at the inner workings of the various hatreds of the author is really probably not much of a recommend.  Worth a rent if you're a culture vulture though.",1318550400,,1035,4.244897959183674
2616703,4,B000GRUQZQ,"Wiliam Macy is one of the best actors of our generation. And he is one of the most under-rated.

Macy plays a man whose marriage has dissolved. His life is a blank wall, and he is searching for a reason to his life. So he starts by looking for a woman, believing sexual contact will help him. Any woman. He goes from a strip bar, to a peep show, to a hooker, and in each place, he is the victim of scams and people who rob him, beat him, and want only his money. In each case, everyone sees him as a mark. In his desperation, after being beaten, and robbed, he finally picks up a waitress who he thinks understands him. BUT, he has slowly descended into madness, and he kills her when she doesn't agree with his `philosophy'.

This is a character study of a man who is lost to the world, and after being used and beaten, creates his own morality. A morality that is in opposition to the rigors of `correct society', and destroys him.

Watch this dvd for Macy's performance. He is incredible as always.

Be warned, this film is a brutal study, and very disturbing. It is NOT viewable by children.",1300233600,5,1095,4.27536231884058

2616715,1,B000GRUQZQ,"I'm a fan of David Mamet but I hated this movie.

It was interesting at first, then it went into strange and awkward directions, yet, at the end, the climax was not worth the committment to watching the movie.

William Macy [for some reason] is at his wits end & decides to walk out on his wife. Both charactors treat their marriage as though it had no meaning and the scene plays like a break up of an informal boyfriend/girlfriend relationship. It's a ridulously phony scene. Then, Macy roams the streets looking to get laid from various prostitutes and he cannot consumate the ""deal"" because he is too nerdy, too anxiety prone, too upitty.

Then, out of nowhere, his charactor takes a violent/evil turn which is also where the movie takes it's own turn in the ""wrong"" direction.

The bulk of the movie takes place over just one evening (a la Kubrick's ""Eyes Wide Shut"") emitting out of a theme  that ""the 0grass isn't necessarily greener on the other side"". When the movie addresses Macy not assimilating into the world, the film is interesting. However, once the movie goes into another violent direction ( I don't want to spoil the plot), is when the movie becomes unbelievable and foolishly brutal.

Macy is a small man so when his character turns menacing, it is simply not believable. I am usually a fan of Mamet's gritty dialogue yet, in this movie, his usual colloquialisms are too contrived. Many of the converstations are too peppered with obsenities and are not reflective of true life. Macy blurts out ""For Christ's sake"" way too many times

The pacing of the movie is strange. For the bulk, it's supposed to be a long, bad evening but then it covers a much longer time span with no form of narrative to explain why and what is happening, the movie loses whatever rythm it tried to create.

The movie is extremely misogynistic (I'm a man) and the women in Mamet's universe have no role other than to be whores, scam artists, strippers, weak-minded or feeble. There is a murder of a woman in this movie where there is no addressing of the tragedy of the crime. I found the film offensive and heartless and I would imagine that a woman would be totally repulsed.

Maybe the unraveling of a person's nerve works well in a ""play"" form but, as a movie, I thought this one had no redeaming value.",1281744000,4,2304,4.586374695863747

2616717,4,B000GRUQZQ,"This David Mamet play-based film is heavy on the usual ruminations about manhood, race and sexuality that are Mamet trademarks. I found it kind of funny in a warped way. Edmond gets mad when various hookers and con artists try to overcharge him, and he asks for change back at a strip club and peep show. He goes crazy after picking up a waitress and slashes her to death. The film then takes a really dark turn when he winds up in prison, as the cellmate of a bigger guy who immediately demands that Edmond ""get on my body."" The ending is weird as they snuggle as prison lovers for life, with Macy wearing a weird bald wig that makes his head look like a mushroom.

One day, Edmond simply walks away from all ties- his job, his marriage, his life. Edmond takes a trip through the ""bad"" part of town, in an attempt to find some meaning, direction, or just plain excitement. Instead, he discovers only his own latent insanities and prejudices. Edmond is a little man lost in a big world, using bigotry and hatred in order to feel larger. He wanders from one misadventure to the next, neither receiving  satisfaction nor gaining any real insight. This is the ultimate mid-life crisis. Edmond releases the ugly, pent-up beast that has been incarcerated behind his respectable life. He sees this as true freedom, only to find that it leads to total self-destruction and his final confinement. We are taken along w/ Edmond as he mentally disintegrates and takes out his life-long frustrations on both the deserving and the undeserving. Stuart Gordon (From Beyond, Re-animator, Castle Freak, Dagon) seems an odd choice to direct this film, but in the end, it IS a horror movie of a sort. EDMOND is a tale of inner turmoil and terror unleashed. This is a man in free-fall mode, and we get to follow him all the way to the bottom...",1234310400,4,1264,4.719457013574661

I consider ""Edmond"" a parable about a man seeking his true identity.  In the beginning a fortune teller shuffles her tarot cards and informs him that he's not where he belongs. By the end of the film Edmond discovers where he DOES belong - hint... its not in society. William Macey is incredible at playing ""The Fool"" as he leads us down the dark alleys of Mamet's fool's journey.  Edmond goes through a real transformation at the end.  Of course, what he discovers is not what most people would consider enlightenment or what Hollywood would consider a happy ending. Lets just say that Edmond is more suited to the contemplative life.  We all struggle to find our place in the world.  You've got to at least give Edmond credit for trying.

I found this film more than provocative - and it definitely made me think.

2616720,1,B000GRUQZQ,"I sat in disbelief as I watched this film. Macy has proven such a
fine actor in so many other films, but was completely wrong for
this part. His delivery was totally flat and unconvincing. He just
wasn't right for the character. As for the ending, it couldn't have
been any less ironic or ridiculous. No subtlty or believability
whatsoever. For movies addressing the same subject matter, see
Taxi Driver, Falling Down, and Fight Club. They are better movies
and the actors do a much better job at fulfilling their respective
roles.",1215907200,2,531,4.782608695652174
2616721,1,B000GRUQZQ,"I watched this movie recently and was looking around to see if there were any decent arguments about how this is in any way a movie worth watching.  So far I have not found any.  On positive reviews I see comments about how the movie is ""dark"".  If you want to see a ""dark"" movie go see something else.  About a third to halfway through the film this thing goes totally off the rails and becomes an incoherent mess.  This movie is terribly written and the main character's actions are totally unconvincing.  And to those that say he's mentally imbalanced that may be true but his behavior at the beginning and ending of the movie make no sense to his behavior through the rest of it because the script and the acting do not allow the audience to understand his motivations.  Bottom line, this movie is totally absurd.  It's not ""dark"", it's terrible.",1213660800,3,850,4.509803921568627
2616722,3,B000GRUQZQ,"Seeing this film in the video rental store, I had high expectations.  A David Mamet ""sexy thriller"" starring William H. Macy; what could be bad?  Unfortunately, the film is neither sexy nor thrilling, and does not rise to the level of Mamet's other works.  But it does succeed in being both interesting and disturbing.

Macy gives a frenzied performance as Edmond, a middle-aged white professional who descends into madness as his life careens out of control.  We witness Edmond as he reacts against all the horrible things he sees in the world:  greed, lawlessness, cruelty, violence, loneliness, and ultimately the emptiness and meaninglessness of his life.  It's reminiscent of DeNiro in  ""Taxi Driver"" and Michael Douglas in ""Falling Down"", both of which are better films.

The problem with ""Edmond"" is that we don't connect with or care enough about the main character.  We don't feel his pain, and so we can't understand his actions.  There are some satisfying scenes where Edmond righteously defends against the prostitutes, muggers and other lowlifes in his path.  But just as we start to feel we understand him, Edmond lashes out violently against seemingly innocent victims.  It's as if the filmmakers couldn't decide between making a thoughtful drama or a slasher horror flick, and so combined elements of both.

There are flashes of Mamet's trademark sparse snappy dialog which are almost poetic.  But whenever Edmond tries to say something meaningful about his philosophy, it just comes across as the rantings of a psychopath.  This is a serious weakness of the film.  You can't have the main character acting crazy and then expect us to take anything he says seriously.

Overall, the film has a nightmarish quality to it that is captivating.  All the action takes place at night at seedy locales.  And while any given scene unfolds in a logical manner, taken as a whole, the plot makes no sense.  LIke most nightmares, we get caught up as the story unfolds, shocking and unnerving us.  I suppose Edmond's living nightmare brings consciousness to some dark areas of our psyches that are disturbing to see.  In any case, like other nightmares, I was glad when this film was over.",1200009600,7,2191,4.975206611570248
2616723,3,B000GRUQZQ,"Anyone who has seen David Mamet's work, knows that this writer is very complex. Seemingly racist or superficial dialog(s), always lead to a climatic ending. Although I have never seen ""Edmond"" as a play, the film definitely feels more like a play than a film. Quick dialogs and brief encounters lead us to a dramatic change in a life of a middle aged dilusional man. Edmond is 47 year old professional who suddenly realizes that he is bored with his life, his wife and work. On a whim, he decides to leave it all and pursue a search for higher self. The women who could give him excitement he is looking for, are all for hire (ladies of the night) and apparently - according to Edmond - they cost too much. Which tells us that Edmond was either married for too long, or ""born yesterday"". In the course of one night, Edmond's life changes completely. In the end, he is in place and time where he manages to: have time to meditate on purpose of (his) life, get over his prejudices (racial and otherwise) and finally break away from the boredom what was haunting him thru the last several years of his marriage. The end of this unusual thriller is worth ending several overbearing moments we are forced to go thru in the course of the movie.

2616753,1,B000GRUQZQ,"""Edmond,""(2005) has a screenplay by greatly praised American screenwriter/playwright David Mamet( ""Glengarry Ross""),based on his own 1980's stage play of the same name, and was directed by Stuart Gordon.  It boasts some top-drawer acting talent, including many performers long-associated with Mamet.

Mamet frequently sets his work in Chicago, his hometown, but ""Edmond"" is set in New York.  William H. Macy, an old hand at Mamet,  stars in the title role, that of Edmond Burke, an anonymous mid-level functionary at some major corporation, and he gives it his best shot.  Edmond is apparently sent off the rails by the fact that a meeting at his corporation, set for the next Monday, has been pushed back a couple of hours.  Oh, and he gets an odd reading from a fortune teller.  Rebecca Pidgeon, Mamet's wife, plays Edmond's wife, and we have to think she's not sorry to see Edmond go.  Joe Mantegna, a Chicagoan who also has long experience with Mamet, plays a racist no-name guy in a bar, whose rants further help to set Edmond off.  Denise Richards, Ling Bai and Mena Suvari play three unlucky sex workers, whose paths Edmond crosses -- he thinks they're all charging too much.  Julia Stiles plays Glenna, a barmaid, whose crossing paths with Edmond makes her unluckiest of all.

Throughout Edmond's grim, gory journey around the pre-Disneyfied sex mart of 42d Street, there's a lot of the snappy, cross-cutting dialogue Mamet is honored for.  But what's the point of the movie?  What's it about? Beats me.  Puzzlingly little.",1194566400,4,1531,4.9763779527559056

It's a filmization of a 1982 David Mamet play and reflects is stagey origins in its claustophobic sets and artificial situations. The descent  that Edmond (played by William H. Macy) takes from respectability to madness is not convincing and one is continually asking ""what exactly is the point?"".

""Edmond"" is hopelessly dated and shallow and it was a big mistake to resurrect it on screen. This low budget film leaves you with a really bad taste in the mouth. Hold your nose and put this putrid mess in the trash where it belongs.",1193875200,5,752,4.813953488372093
2616755,5,B000GRUQZQ,"This is a fascinating film.  I think the stage version would probably be preferable over the dvd, but William H. Macy makes that possibly untrue.

Story: Sad wretch tries to sever his ties to the world, but he cannot.

I enjoyed this because Mr. Macy is so darned good.  I know Kenneth Branaugh did it on stage and I'm sure he was good, too, but Bill Macy- what an actor!

Anyhow.  As a rather simple man, I'd just like to say to other rather simple guys: ""This is the movie to watch if you think YOUR life has gone downhill.""

On the more cerebral side, I'd say the main character makes a couple of valid points despite inevitably contradicting them later.  That's how we (people) are: we struggle to understand ""the rules"" of life and then--thanks to the curse of free will--violate our own self-composed rules.

Some really smart guy once said that if God didn't exist, it would have been necessary to invent Him.  The hero of this story could have sure used a good God!

One more thing: I know Edmund Burke only for the quotation ""All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.""  I didn't see that thought reflected at all in this film, so either I don't know enough about Burke or the different spelling of ""Edmond"" is meant to tell me this guy doesn't think that way.  So obviously I'm not that smart.

Still, this is a good movie.  Just not uplifting.",1188172800,3,1386,4.4015748031496065
2616756,2,B000GRUQZQ,"Much of the film is predictable but I watched it mainly to see how far it would go.  The main character in this film who comes across as mild mannered gets kicked out by his wife which starts a cascade of negative reactions.  Frustrated over his situation, he takes to the streets going to strip joints, peep shows and massage parlors.

2616757,4,B000GRUQZQ,"I really enjoyed this movie.  I can't believe a Stuart Gordon film somehow slipped under my radar!  I had to hear about this film from my dad!  How do you like them apples?  Though I certainly wouldn't call this film artsy, it's one of those that you can take from it what you want, and different people seem to have different interpretations of it's meaning.  When you see a guy on the street or in a subway ranting and raving and acting like a loon, you wonder who is that guy and what's his story?  What happened to him to make him like this, etc?  I tend to view this movie as a kind of backstory to one of these characters, but that's probably not the intent, nor what other people think of when they watch this.  The film is a bit like After Hours in the sense that it deals with a guy who's pretty much lost in his own city over the course of one night while terrible things happen all around him.  But, in this film, Macy seems to be the cause of all the misery as opposed to being on the receiving end.  The film basically shows Macy, who's gone off the deep end from the start, gradually going more insane as the night progresses, resulting in some horrific stuff.  Macy's an actor I've always liked, but never really payed too much attention to.  He was just always kinda ""there"" for me, but in this movie he really gets your attention and comes off as a very convincing, sad and dangerous man on the edge.  The film was originally performed as a stage play written by David Mamet, and it shows.  The film does play out as though it were a play, which will turn some folks off, calling it ""boring"" or ""pointless"".  Alot of reviewers here keep bringing up Mamet, Mamet, Mamet.  Very few reviewers bring up the fact that Stuart Gordon directed this movie, and fewer still acknowledge his contribution.  Sure, the screenplay and dialog is all Mamet without a doubt.  This is indeed a Stuart Gordon movie though.  His presence is just as evident as Mamet's.  It may not be one of his horror films, but fans will be able to identify the style.  He seems to be one of the few directors who can make films outside his usual genre and still maintain the same ""feel""(King Of The Ants was another great example).  Sure, it is a bit more cerebral than most of Gordon's previous work, but that's most likely the Mamet influence.  Definitely worth a look for fans of Gordon, Mamet and William H Macy.",1182902400,2,2398,4.351351351351352
2616758,4,B000GRUQZQ,"I am a Mamet lover. I thought Edmond was a terrific read as a play, and would be very interested in seeing it performed on stage. I was pleasantly surprised after watching this Edmond, that it retained the swiftness and grit of his paradoxical spiraling-into-the-depths-of-depravity/transcending-of-himself-in-the-world.

Without a doubt William H. Macy, who for anyone who doesn't know this, is along with castmates Joe Mantegna and Rebecca Pidgeon (Mamet's wife), an expert in playing Mamet. His presence as Edmond Burke gives the film as much cache as the fact Mamet wrote the screenplay. His scene with Mantegna early on is one of the best too.

As for my pleasant surprise I am reminded that I have been disappointed by some of Mamet's original films (Heist, Spartan and State & Main were all overstuffed, not lean enough, with too many twists and turns) but have enjoyed the adaptations of his plays (Lakeboat, American Buffalo, Glengarry Glen Ross). This maybe due to the unity of his spare style and the limitations of space a play, even one adapted to screen, must exist within.

This film's use of recognizable faces in single scenes was perhaps a consequence of Mamet's respect in the industry, and maybe an attempt at marketing a sordid and deep story beyond any expected attention. All performers get the chance to needle Macy's Edmond, with the acceptable duplicity of routine interactions, propelling him deeper into the ecstacy of ridding himself of himself. The brilliance of the story is that he must become everything he never wanted to (john, racist, murderer, homosexual) in order to be where he belongs. Constantly being lied to has rendered him inert, thus a double time dose of truth or passion or rage or unconsciousness must be his salvation. That's what Mamet is able to create and convey, the ancient philosophical paradox of achieving bliss or something like it, by destroying the existence one has spent so much energy creating, here amidst the dark places of our modern world (bars, tarot readers, strip joints, back alleys, dingy apartments, prisons, subways....remember, he never does enter the church)....",1181779200,2,2139,5.123209169054442
2616759,4,B000GRUQZQ,"The beginning of the film shows the re-connection of the spirit of a man who has been sleepwalking for years. He projects his weakness onto his surroundings and throws the baby out with the bathwater. After severing all ties with his old life he begins his metaphysical and physical descent into the underworld.

 The film delves deeply into Edmonds sexual dysfunction and uses his inability to feel and express sexual energy as the core of his rage and later instability.

 The film also weaves this into tales about how a white man deals with real life on the streets out of his coccoon. Obviously he doesnt do well as his sense of entitlement and priviledge aren't catered to.

 On the streets Edmond reconnects with some forgotten primal energy that was lost in his mundane life, he confuses this with some kind of spiritual enlightenment.

 This aggressive energy leads him to very bad places.

 Which finally culminates in the end of the creation that is Edmond and his spiritual rebirth in very trying circumstances.

 The film is very intellectually interesting, it seems to have slightly missed the mark in the emotional and realistic side of things. Some scenes that should have greater impact felt almost comical. Its still very entertaining but it doesnt have the emotional impact of say a Lynch film.

The box states that the movie is ""A Heart-Pounding Thriller"", so I expected something in the vein of Man On Fire. As I watched, I was reminded of Michael Douglas in Falling Down, except better, if that's possible. This movie is tragic, terrifying, and very funny. Talk about your mid-life crises!

2616761,4,B000GRUQZQ,"First of all... this is NOT a thriller. Even in the most stretched understanding of the word.

This movie is part character study, part drama and part exemplifying a theory. The theory that we are a product of our environment. Mamet cleverly wove that theory in and among others. Such as the debate over whether our life is choice or destiny. The direction he took here was that the main character made a choice... and found his destiny as a result of that choice. And his choice led him into an environment that molded him into what others wanted him to be.

This is the story of a man who let's his grip on his reality go and slips into another reality completely foreign to him. Feeling dejected and lonely, Edmond seeks advice from a fortune teller. Of course, the fortune tellers' words confirms how he feels about his life... that he's not where he belongs.

Edmond then leaves his wife and life and grabs onto the sharp metal rails of the staircase leading to the underbelly of society with greased and naive hands. What follows is a succession of events that lead him to 'where he does belong'.

Not wanting to give much away here, but Macy's character, Edmond, is stilted and opinionated to say the least. He feels... therefore he is. And with each turn of events his thoughts and feelings lead him further from his former self. He questions everything and yet finds no answers.

There are numerous theories of society, group behavior, theology, religion and development that Edmond scratches the surface of only to become the product of his environment. The environment he chose.

The reason I chose 4 stars is for the horribly wrong billing that this movie, as well as others, has recieved from hollywood. With all the lofty thinkers there, you would think sooner or later they would get it right.

I highly recommend this movie but be prepared to think. This isn't some mindless drift through neverland. This movie is packed with powerful thoughts.",1176422400,8,1960,4.713450292397661

Edmond is an effective vehicle for this kind of deep psychological probing and it brings out the best in mamet and in macy... It is not the movie you think it is.. it is something quite different and quite daring..

2616773,3,B000GRUQZQ,"I rented this film on a whim because it sounded interesting and had a decent cast for an indie.  It's not a bad movie but I must be clear that it is marketed all wrong.

First of all it is called a ""sexy-thriller"".  This right away is wrong.  The movie plods along with very specific slow pacing, music, and scenes.  It was designed to be slightly disjointed and a little awkward but even in scenes of violence there is little pulse.  As for sexy?  Well Richards and Suvari barely have 2 lines each even though they are prominant on the box cover and Bai Ling does a strip tease which kills another 2 minutes of screen time.  Most of the sexiness is Macy just walking around a red light district looking at posters and ads.  Also by about the midway point, maybe even earlier, the film turns on it's head a bit and obviously sexiness or even blatant sex has little to do with it.  Also why in the world is a gun on the front cover???  Unless I missed something that gun or any gun really was never part of any scene in the entire movie.

Over all the story is interesting if not a little flimsy and lacking some depth beyond the middle aged man losing his grip angel.  Some of the dialogue has some unique plot but mostly the film is Macy walking around telling people they are charging him too much money.  After a while it is obvious he has lost his mind a bit but the director really slams it home so by films end you will be tired of his psychotic ramblings.  There was some humor involved and I did enjoy that.

Overall I think I would have enjoyed this film more had the marketing been accurate.  It is a slow drama not a sexy thriller.",1168300800,17,1642,4.211538461538462

2616776,4,B000GRUQZQ,"After my initial viewing of Stuart Gordon's film I knew, absolutely knew, that people were going to despise it, hate it with a venomous wrath, and I, as per usual, was spot on.

""What filmmakers have to understand is that movie goers want to be entertained, not preached to!""  This is so pathetic that, as someone who appreciates film as art, it makes me want to drown a bunch of puppies.

Andrei Tarkovsky, I'm paraphrasing, said that films should not be made solely for entertainment, that films, for the longest time, have ""sinned"" and should pay for just that - being mindless shlock that gives the viewer absolutely nothing at all, this is a belief I thoroughly agree with.

The film is gritty, and will offend the same crowd who absolutely adores Crash, because, apparently, everyone is supposed to be nice to everyone, and Walt Disney will run the world.

Everyone involved gives fantastic performances, and Gordon, as usual, does a great job directing.  This is no Re-Animator, this is a film with a brain, with thoughts, ideas and a philosophy.

The last 15 minutes or so do take quite a sharp turn; Macy bald with a Sam Elliot satche, and a ""lover"" in prison who he waxes philosophic with, but this aspect didn't bother me at all; if anything it showed, very well, how random life can be, because, as we all know, life is one giant absurdity and nothing more.",1165795200,6,1369,4.632231404958677
2616777,2,B000GRUQZQ,"I love me some Mamet.  His dialogue takes some getting used to, since it is crafted so as to touch on the edges of realism while inhabiting a more stylistic realm.  I also love his dedication to his actors, employing the same ones over and over, so that his movies come off as different shows performed by the same theatrical troupe, which may very well be his point.

However, Edmond is the first Mamet film to leave me disappointed and, worse, annoyed.

Macy plays Edmond with typical wide-eyed aplomb.  Edmond is a man who is weak, but is valiantly (if not clumsily) trying to be strong.  The movie starts with a chance encounter with a fortune teller whose tarot card reading provides a cinematic outline for the remainder of the film.  Edmond then goes home, breaks up with his wife, and goes on a deaf, dumb, and blind search for himself, finding instead over-priced whores, pimps who are not-what-they-seem, and -- generally -- everything but himself.

I get the point: Edmond is the epitome of modern man's emasculation, unable to find his own balls with both hands, and his tawdry and panicked search through New York for some unnameable salvation is an example of the lengths anyone must go (man or woman) to find, if not redemption, then the places where one ""belongs.""

There are a lot of problems here.  Most superficially, there's one of packaging.  The DVD box prominently features a picture of a gun, and no gun appears in the film.  The tags on the box call the film, alternately, a mystery and a fast-paced thriller, when it is neither one of those things.  Not even close.  This movie is (like most of Mamet's work) based on a play; never before has it been more obvious (unless you count the absolutely brilliant Oleanna).

Edmond is, essentially, a one-man show, with Macy delivering numbing and rambling monologues, stopped only occasionally to engage in awkward and almost meaningless side action with ancillary characters (some of them played well -- Denise Richards actually shines in her brief scene as a hooker -- and some of them not so well -- Julia Stiles seems over-medicated in her role as an ambivalent and easily persuaded waitress).  In spite of how they do and don't help Edmond make his way through the tunnel of decadence and misery he creates for himself, most of these characters seem disposable, making the movie come across as equally dismissable.  (I would also like to take a moment here to make a small observation about Rebecca Pidgeon, Mamet's wife, an actress who appears, I think, in every single one of her husband's films: this woman is, viewed in even the nicest of lights, one of the worst actresses I've ever seen, and she sucks the life out of every scene she's in.  In this movie she plays Edmond's wife, and does so with heartless and uninspired vehemence.  It's nice that Mamet gives his wife the opportunities he does, but one has to wonder if she'd ever get any acting work at all if she weren't married to such a famous writer/director).

At the risk of spoiling the film, I will say that, at the end, Edmond finally does find where he ""belongs,"" a place that, given his previous struggles, makes a lot of sense (although the manner in which he finds this belonging might offend more than a few viewers).  But this is small consolation since, by this time, few people are likely to have any sympathy for Edmond or where he ends up.  His character's slap-dash personality combined with the persistent and mostly meaningless monologues on fate, fear, destiny and (ironically) meaning make for a benumbing and distasteful cinematic experience.  A few good performances and some nice, visceral cinematography do not save this film from its plot and the dialogue that fails to move that plot along.  Avoid this flick; try Oleanna or Glen Gary Glenross instead.",1165363200,10,3816,4.755690440060698
2616778,4,B000GRUQZQ,"It's not hard to say that William Macy's an actor's actor--which means that he can take on virtually any role and do absolute wonders with it. In ""Edmond"" he's the title character who, at the beginning, walks out on his beautiful, sexy wife (Rebecca Pidgeon), which immediately sets the viewer's mind on edge. It's not only that she's so attractive; it's also the way he phrases his disillusion with her that makes you cringe.

From there things go progressively downhill. We start with Edmond's frustration in his marriage and subsequently understand his lust--which apparently was not being satisfied by his beautiful wife--and, ultimately, his rage. It's rage, in fact, that fuels Edmond throughout the course of the film, through his encounters with three different hookers, a woman on a subway, a waitress, and a pimp on the street. Early on, his rage is also fueled by a man in a bar Edmond goes to; the man is played by Joe Mantegna, who spouts racism and sexism as fluidly and easily as anyone might talk about the weather. And Edmond immediately agrees with everything the man says--not because, as we understand, he really is necessarily racist or sexist, but because he is more than anything else a truly angry person.

Rage makes Edmond lie and kill, and drives him to attempts at lustful encounters with the hookers, all of which end in frustration and non-fulfillment. In this short (under 80 minutes) film, Macy gives a knockout performance as Edmond. This is a one-man show definitely worth seeing.

The ending is a bitterly ironic conclusion to a highly troubled journey that ultimately leaves the viewer either sad or pondering...or perhaps both.

2616792,5,B000GRUQZQ,"One of my favorite actors is William H. Macy.  I also like the work of playwright and screenwriter David Mamet.  Put these elements together, and I knew I had to see it, even though this 2005 film was panned by the critics and never really made it big in the theaters.  Well, what is sourly overlooked by some is like sweet honey to others. And in this case, I'm one of those ""others"".  From the very beginning, I was completely entranced.  And then I was sorry when it was over.

The film is based on a play written in the early eighties.  So it seems a little dated.  But that didn't matter to me.

The film opens as William H. Macy, wearing a suit and tie and leaving his office, has a yearning to do something different.  He stops in at a fortune tell who tells him that this is not where he's supposed to be.  And so he goes home, tells his wife he is leaving her, and just walks away from his middle class humdrum life.  Naturally the first place he goes is a bar where he meets another man in a suit who sympathizes with him in a long monologue.  Yes, there are lots of long monologues in this film, most of which are spoken by Macy.  And the words of these monologues are a combination of frustration, pearls of wisdom and pure poetry.

Macy is looking for an amorous adventure and so we follow him through a wide variety of sleazy clip joints and houses of ill repute.  Often, he gets angry at the price and argues with the girls.  Always, there is a rage inside of him that is ready to explode.  We sense that.  But we don't realize how unpredictable this streak is.  We witness his character changing.  We see him growing violent.  First he beats up a pimp.  And then, inevitably he's drawn in to an even more violent act - one that horrified me because I didn't quite think it would get quite this bad.  The ending is very satisfying and fits right in to the rest of the film.

As far as Macy's acting goes, he does a super fantastic job.  He seems to ""own"" the role.  I can't think of any other actor who would do it as well.

Our tragic anti hero simply turned off the lights of the sanity, in search of a temporal and unsatisfied promised land, with determined by commercial stereotypes to guarantee what you need.

This hellish portrait is showed in two great movements; the outside world with its accustomed miseries and the inside world of this man who simply gave up to get on the life' theater. A woman who reads him his Tarot will ignite a chain of unlucky but unconsciously desired events in order to demonstrate himself the futility and banality of the urban paradise hovered by neon lights.

2616797,4,B000GRUQZQ,"EDMOND is a dark, dank, mercilessly downer of a film - that just happens to be one of the best pieces of work the very talented William H. Macy has ever done.  In a bravura performance he embodies the strange creature created by David Mamet, triumphs in the extended monologues that include hate, racism, homophobia, hopelessness, and fear and serves them up in a near stoic way that allows the viewer to accompany the dissociating man into the depths of hell - but with an absolutely solid ending.  It may not be an easy movie to watch, but it is clearly one actor's tour de force that deserves attention.

Edmond (Macy) is a bored, frustrated. angry robot of a worker who happens on a fortune teller who reads his Tarot cards and tells him he is in the wrong place. Edmond, obviously disturbed, goes home, leaves his wife who no longer stimulates him spiritually or sensuously, and begins his Rake's Progress journey through the bowels of the filthy city.  He has a bar conversation with an anonymous guy (Joe Montegna) who advises him to go get laid, gives him an address, and disappears.  What follows is a series of bad encounters with hookers, peep show dancers, sidewalk con artists, and pimps: Edmond spits out vitriolic racist epithets, is beaten and robbed, pawns his ring, buys a vicious knife, and begins his retribution - a path that includes murder and prison.  As he ultimately finds his prison cell the only place of rest he can tolerate, in comes a cellmate (African American of course) and after an abusive start, Edmond shaves his head, gets tattooed and the story closes in a rather tender fashion.

The cast is superb: the vignettes of the characters Edmond encounters include Mena Suvari, Julia Stiles, Bokeem Woodbine, Rebecca Pidgeon, along with other less well known but equally fine actors.  Stuart Gordon directs Mamet's play-to-film story with the right amount of bluntness and dark, smarmy street situations.  But it is Macy who is uncanny in his ability to carry us along the warped and disintegrating mind of the character who could be any of a number standing next to us in an elevator....A tough film but well worth viewing.

Too bad since it's one of the best (and strangest) films I've seen this year. First off, I knew nothing of this movie before watching it. It's definitely a little bit bizarre. William H. Macy, in one of his strongest performances, plays Edmond. After going to a Tarot card reader (who shows him unpleasant looking cards, but never explains them), he blatantly and unapologetically leaves his wife. The scene unfolds quickly and seems to end before it should. He comes home, tell her he's leaving her almost in the middle of a conversation; She yells at him and he leaves. Edmond ends up at a bar where he has an abnormal philosophical conversation with a man (Joe Mantegna), who gives him $100 dollars and tells him to get laid. Edmond goes to a club, where he unsuccessfully tries to do so with a girl (Denise Richards). Next he goes to a peep show, where once again he leaves...Empty handed. He tries a massage parlor, where he's turned down by yet another girl (Mena Suvari) because he doesn't have enough money. Then he's ripped off by a couple of three card monty players, but finds his own kind of redemption after he beats up a pimp. It's obvious, but is left unsaid, through most of the film that Edmond has a screw loose and by the end of the film he's in prison. He accomplishes quite a bit in 82 minutes. Besides a fight/murder scene, the movie is fueled by conversations. It is based on a play and most of the conversations are so philosophical and out-there, that most viewers will wonder to themselves ""What the f**k is the point?"" Truth be told, there is no point. But if you like movies like ""Buffalo 66"" then you might like this movie. It's subtle, low-key, and kind of weird...But it's really good. Julia Stiles co-stars.

2616801,5,B000GRUQZQ,"Wow, what a film!

Mamet who wrote one of my all time fave films, THE SPANISH PRISONER, again has created dialouge that is so mechanical, yet inexplicably beautiful. Stewart Gordon, who is sort of hit or miss, IMO, did a fantastic job as well as director. William H Macy, of course, was brilliant as Edmond, a man who quickly decends into madness and ends up confronting and becoming what he secretly fears the most.

All fans of psycho horror, bizarro need to check this puppy out!",1160265600,4,482,4.593023255813954
8134158,1,B000GRUQZQ,"Abysmal, ugly, racist crap!  Don't waste your time.  Deliberately and pointedly offensive to women, blacks, and thinking people in general.  I once read that many actors are just one step above prostitutes.  At the time, I thought that was a harsh analogy, but now I get it!  If this is an example of what passes for cinema in the U.S., then it's easy to see why this country has slipped so far.  I am boycotting Macy and Mantegna for lending themselves to this effrontery!",1505347200,,473,4.571428571428571
