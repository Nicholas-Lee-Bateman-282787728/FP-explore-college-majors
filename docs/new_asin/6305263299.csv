999493,5,6305263299,"This is a truely an amazing art film.
I haven't seen anything like this in my life.
It's like a folk music or something like M. Night Shyamalan <THE VILLAGE> kind of enviorment but it is even sorry to compare with that movie since shyamalan's movie was a crap but this one is a true work of art.
This is not a horror film. If I have to describe it, it can be only say as an art film.

I finally bought the Samsung 4K Ultra HD monitor and a upscale bluray player and the disc was an HD remastered Bluray disc. The picture and the sound was just perfect as if I was watching the movie that was shot yesterday with HD camera, not with an old filmstock back in 1979.

i heard many things about Werner Herzog and honestly own his movies like 6 but not been able to see any of them since there are so many movies that I have in lince await for me to see.
Now that I am totally mesmerized by this film, I have to watch all of his films include the great <Aguirre Wrath of God> an many others.

This film's story is nothing new. If you have watched <Coppola's DRACULA> there is nothing more to say about this film.
But truely the image of the movie is just stunning.
It is shot in Geremany and the language is also German. Be aware not to watch this film with English dubbed version. it's a crab.
Klaus Kinski's part acted as Dracula is so much different with Gary Oldman.
Once great teacher said true great film does not tells everything with dialogue but with visual words and enviornments.
Kinski does not talk much like Gary. Gary talks much all right. And that is more instantly appeals to the audience. Yes.
But Kinski's face expression makes us think. It's truely scary at the end and stays in our heart for days. It won a lot of film festivals at the end because it is way much powerful after all.

There is not much blood either.
As I told you this is not all horror. Maybe it's more of a historic tale. Folk tale.
I know that it's not based on a true story. There is no such thing as dracula a blood sucking human.
But then again, when watching this film, we kind of believe there is.
The movie is that much powerful.

If I have my own theater, no matter how much it takes, I would want to invite as many people as possible and want to show you this movie for sure.
It's a true work of art that I really want to show.

The wood is truely amazing charactor itself.
The music is stunning.

Klaus Kinski, Isabelle Adjani's pale face, Bruno Ganz's weakness are just true work of art.

And the light, camera are just memorable.

I am glad that I bough the bluray although at that time I didn't know that there is other sites that I can buy this in cheaper price and happen to buy from Amazon US but it was worth buying with around 23$.
The picture is just perfect HD remastered and the sound is HD sound 5.1 great. Couldn't be better.

You should definately watch this in any coast.",1470700800,2,2879,4.171171171171171

999495,1,6305263299,"Being a fan of F.W. Murnau's silent masterpiece, I was excited to see this more modernized version. But after watching it I immediately wanted to forget this pathetic remake altogether. My many gripes include- the vampire isn't named Count Orlock like in the original, instead they named him Count Dracula. Then the actors portrayal of the vampire seemed so rigid, I know the legendary Max Shreck's  performance in the silent film is legendary! But this was just sad. In my opinion go with the silent 1922 version it's much better than this ever dreamt of being.",1468972800,,562,4.854166666666667

Great Blu-ray great movie.,1465948800,3,349,5.25
999608,3,6305263299,"I found this film to be a bit of a mixed bag. It has many strengths - thick atmosphere, haunting score, great cinematography, fantastic locations and great set design. Most of all, Klaus Kinski is mesmerizing as Count Dracula. He has such a strong screen presence and everything about him - the way he moves, speaks, stares - it all just works and feels very compelling. He steals every scene he is in to the point where many of the scenes without him feel dull by comparison.

And I hate to use that word - dull - but for some reason I couldn't shake it from my mind for some sections of this movie. The pace is slow and brooding, which is something that I tend to like. A lot of my favorite horror films are slow and deliberate, The Shining chief among them. But it's all in the execution, and here I found the slowness to be a bit burdensome. The movie can come off as wooden at times. Apart from Klaus, the acting can be a bit questionable as well, especially with Lucy's character. I'm sure she is just following direction from Herzog, but I found her to be a little blank and unconvincing, which is a pretty major issue considering she is meant to carry essentially the entire second half of the film.

There are also some moments that play as hokey: all the members of a bar turn in unison and gasp at the mention of Dracula, characters read aloud about vampires from a book when no one is around etc. However, the scenes that work, absolutely work (and they uniformly involve Klaus). It's worth seeing for those scenes and the nice atmosphere, but I don't think it's a film that I'll be hurriedly returning to any time soon.",1463097600,,1632,4.382838283828383

999616,5,6305263299,"I love it for what it is ... it isn't Shakespeare, it's an old classic black & white horror movie.

Gripping and frightening. A bit strange, but if you are familiar with foreign movies, it suddenly becomes a lot less strange

The opening is one of out and out horror with really hideous looking deformed mummified corpses that marks one of the sharpest descents into terror ever, but thankfully for the squeamish there's some footage of fluffy kittens playing to balance out the dread. This follows the actual Dracula story quite well, and like the novel the best part is Jonathan Harker making his way toward the count and his grim fate. Klaus Kinski's is superb as the foul monster, and even though I found him very amusing in parts there's still something very creepy about the design. The stunning Isabelle Adjani is also fantastic as Lucy Harker who fits the role better than anyone else could.

I had the preconceived notion that most of the action would take place in Count Dracula's castle in a remote area beyond the Carpathian Mountains. An early sequence takes Jonathon there simply to get the Count's signature on papers relating to his purchase of real estate in Wisman. The Count, we soon find out, is a vampire quick to sample Jonathon's blood.

Jonathon's wife Lucy (beautiful Isabelle Adjarni) always pale and wan has a telepathic fear that Jonathon is in danger. A bat gets entangled in her bedroom curtains. The atmosphere starts to get decidedly creepy.

Another classic collaboration of Werner Herzog and Klaus Kinski, Nosferatu is not just a remake of the F. W. Murnau silent classic, but an extension of it. Herzog not only develops the Stoker story more directly than the original did, but even reintroduces the original characters - Orlok becomes Dracula, and the Hutters become the Harkers.

Like many of the films involving Herzog and Kinski, Nosferatu is a period piece and creates the context of its plot through beautiful cinematography and a relentless but unhasty pace, not through the script. ThoughKinski dominates the screen just as he always does in these collaborations, the performances of fellow greats Isabelle Adjani and Bruno Ganz are also worthy of mention. Ganz's Jonathan Harker is certainly the most sympathetic character in the film, and Adjani's Lucy is beautiful, spooky, and just odd enough to fit the role perfectly.

Nosferatu is a retelling of the Dracula tale. Unlike its generally inferior competitors, Nosferatu - both the 1922 and 1979 versions - sticks very close to Bram Stoker's text - neither elaborating the focus on bloodsucking (obsessed upon by most American interpretations of Dracula), nor revising Jonathan Harker and Dr. Van Helsing as heroic characters, nor adding erotic or romantic elements to the depravity of the original concept. If you know what Stoker was about, you will thrill to the often forgotten aspects of Stoker's novel which are redeemed here - the plague rats, the gypsies, etc.

The Count cuts a lonely pathetic figure hungry for blood as he wanders about Wisman at night with a coffin under his arm. An alarming number of rats accompany him (where do the film makers find so many and whose job is it to control them on the set?) Deaths in the town are diagnosed as due to fevers by medicos, but Lucy insists they are the result of a vampire. Here we have the old argument of traditional medicine versus unproved myths.

Kinski commands each scene. He has a characteristic method of acting. He says little, moves slowly and uses his eyes to great effect. He gasps and groans a lot. Except for that, you think you are watching a silent movie.

Kinki's intensity allows him to become a perfect Dracula. He understands his role perfectly and never once slips out of 'the hunter'. This is another very important aspect of the Stoker legend which has been sadly contorted by the popularization of the Dracula legend. Nosferatu's Count Dracula is not a charming eastern European gentleman with a quirky bloodsucking habit and a lovesick soul, he is a wily, terrifying, soulless, inhuman, obsessive, predator. And he has absolutely no concern for the affairs of Homo sapiens sapiens.

Jonathon returns to Wisman a broken man, but his faithful wife Lucy who seems to be well-informed about the habits of vampires decides on a plan to rid the town of this vampire. For me this was the most compelling scene in the film. One night she attracts the vampire to her bed. He is sexually aroused, but soon darts at her throat making the most horrible sucking and slurping sounds as he drinks her blood. This is quite a gruesome scene. The vampire lingers too long and he is trapped by the light of day.

I would like to mention Renfield (Roland Toper) who sends Jonathon to the castle. He's an odd man who ends every sentence with a giggle, half humorous, half threatening. A great little character with a brief appearance. At this early stage we already feel impending danger. And then there is the doctor unyielding at first, but later admitting that Lucy was right. He wields a mighty mallet ttoo on a stake that gets to the heart of the matter.

The film is mostly shot in Amsterdam's old city, which fits the mood of the film well. Other locations are in Germany, and Dracula's castle, for once, is an actual castle - even the interior shots! The wonderfully eerie and disorienting Popul Vuh soundtrack compliments the typically Herzogian picture-perfect visuals.

If you like a blend of horror and drama, it is all here. Lots of atmosphere with creaking doors, bats, a multitude of rats, blood-sucking vampires, plague ,disease, mysterious deaths, coffins, cemeteries, the howling of wolves at night.....but do not despair. There is also true love which conquers all.  The only issue here is the fact that this is at its best in the first half, while the second is just not as strong, but overall this is a must-watch for all followers of Dracula: the dirty old man.

This is a great film for those seeking an accessible introduction to film-as-art, and the legendary collaborations of Herzog and Kinski. It will likely annoy those who think of Dracula as a good looking romantic guy with a nasty habit, but is highly recommended for fans of Stoker's original work.  I RECOMMEND WATCHING BACK TO BACK WITH THE ORIGINAL

SPOILER ALERT
Newlyweds Jonathan [Bruno Ganz] and Lucy [Isabelle Adjani] Harker are saddened when Harker is sent to Transylvania by employer Renfield [Roland Topor] to arrange for Count Dracula's purchase of a house across the street from the Harkers' house. Harker travels to Transylvania where he stays with the Count [Klaus Kinski], is sucked by the Count, and eventually escapes from the castle. Jonathan returns to Lucy but spends all his time sitting on a chair in the living room. Dracula moves into the house across from the Harkers'. The rise in deaths is accredited to a plague thought to have arrived with the Demeter. The Count meets his doom when Lucy manages to keep him until after cockcrow. As the sun slowly advances on the houses across the street (visible from the window), Dracula attempts to escape. In doing so, he passes the window and is trapped by the sunlight. At the same time, Jonathan arises from his chair. It is obvious that Jonathan has become the next Nosferatu.",1443484800,,7294,4.844979919678715
999693,5,6305263299,"One thing I've found maddening about Godzilla, King Kong, and Dracula: it's hardly possible to experience the surprise of the supernatural horror because the TITLE IS A SPOILER: ya pretty much KNOW and preconceive alot about the menace- ( possible exceptions: Cloverfield, and The Descent.) So let us first bear in mind: (despite the litiginous resistance of Mrs. Stoker), Nosferatu is originally known to us as a story about an ill-advised encounter with an extremely eccentric Eastern European count ...who comes to pose deadly, (or deathless) threat. If you want to experience this classic story as naively and realistically as possible, (see also: Realism, home movie, documentary),- congratulations: behold the dvd of Herzog's Nosferatu.
  Whatever your preconceptions of vampire films, and specifically, the Dracula tale: erase them completely. Now start fresh by watching this movie.
*BONUS: it was shot twice with the actors in English and German, so it is NOT DUBBED, it is live in English (or German.)*
 What you get out of this movie is....  (despite the supreme AWESOMENESS of the famous Lugosi, Coppola, or Murnau versions)... THE most realistic film experience of a 19th Century European real estate chump traveling East into mysterious mountain terrain to transact a deal with an odd count in his eerie, unreassuring surroundings. The gypsies, the mountain passes, the clouds, the castle, the beach, and the Count - are all so chillingly concrete, organic, and moody - amid the ominous German Romantic stylings. In fact, it is the unrefined credibility of the clothes, props, locations, and acoustic sounds, along with rich, natural music that effectively supports the impactful drama of;  the telepathic dread, the madness of the rat infested Apocalypse, the ungodly metaphysical vampire principles...: Herzog's Nosferatu first feeds your senses with the subdued realism of old world ambience so when your reality meter is peaking and your feelings are subtley luxuriating into the past, thence the weirdness freaks you out more. There's no jokes, no camp, no gimmicks, no bangs, no stunts, no hocus-pocus, some adept theatrics- but essentially, this is as close as it gets to the simple sense of beholding a bonafide weirdo vampire nobleman walking by your window on a rainy day. Unlike other so called horror movies, it's not a carnival ride so much as a still life or fine art painting...( of a woeful freak among us.)",1439510400,2,2437,5.2225063938618925

999696,5,6305263299,"Nosferatu 1979 DVD/Blu-Ray

This is in my Werner Herzog classic film collection, the only other of which (so far) Ive seen is the famous Fitzcarraldo.  This is a retelling of the story of the vampire in the Carpathians, variously named Vlad the Impaler, Count Dracula, or Nosferatu, as in this film.

Many directors have favorite actors or actresses they like to work with (Woody Allen, Ingmar Bergman, etc).  The Herzog-Kinsky combination is the stuff of film legend, and here again Kinsky has a leading role as the Count Dracula.  Bruno Ganz plays Jonathan Harker, a sort of property salesman in Wismar, Germany whose most peculiar boss tells him the Count wants to purchase a large old estate in town and he is therefore sending Kinsky immediately, with a contract.  The trip will be long (some two weeks each direction) but potentially very lucrative, as the Count seems uninterested in any cost considerations.

The very beginning of the movie shows forboding dreams of his beloved wife Lucy, played by Isabel Adjani (a French actress) who doesnt want him to leave.  But Harker, a thoroughly modern man, doesnt believe in fairy-tales about vampires, ghosts and such nonsense, and sets out straight off, after doing the best he can to reassure her.

Perhaps the most memorable part of the movie for me was his journey to the castle.  As he reaches the general region he comes upon a band of gypsies who, once they hear of his destination, warn him away.  Their description of the effort needed even to reach the castle quickly sounds surreal and mystical, and as he proceeds on his way alone, one senses that the real story here is not about external events, but a sort of Jungian exploration of the unseen heights and depths, of heaven and hell within our own psyches.  When he finally does arrive at the castle too, some of Kinskys lines (as Count Dracula) are strikingly poetic and metaphorical.

A minor note: Herzog puts himself in the film in a cameo (as directors often like to do) using his own hands and feet rising out of a bed of soil, in one scene.

This film was produced with an original English soundtrack as well as a German soundtrack, so you can listen to it in English despite the fact that Herzog and the cast are all European.  It is a strange, haunting piece of work, which shows why Herzog continues to fascinate, generations later.  This film will endure.",1427932800,2,2383,4.719806763285024

It is dark, bleak & Gothic - just as it should be - with an ugly & unnerving Dracula in the persona of Klaus Kinski who delivers a marvelous portrayal. The dubbing is fair, the story basic & with few special effects to talk of. Yet it haunts you from beginning to end. This won't be the most loved of the Dracula canon but it will be among the top 5.

Director Werner Herzog's ""Nosferatu the Vampyre"" gets a high-definition upgrade for the first time. The release gives audiences the opportunity to view what is simply one of the most stylish and beautifully shot genre films.

It's widely accepted that F.W. Murnau's 1922 silent film ""Nosferatu"" is one of the greatest horror films of all time. The epic scene of actor Max Schreck rising from his coffin is easily one of the most frightening moments captured on celluloid. Francis Ford Coppola even mimicked it for his big-budget 1992 adaptation, ""Bram Stoker's Dracula."" The very look of Count Orlock has been imitated in cult favorite vampire films like ""Subspecies"" and the 1979 TV mini-series ""Salem's Lot.""

""Nosferatu the Vampyre"" is a perfect example of cinematic genius and a remake that reverently improves on the original in some aspects. Every scene found in the film drips with chilling atmosphere and historic accuracy. For 107 minutes, Director/Writer Herzog transports us to the year 1850 and takes us on a journey from Wismar, Germany into the Carpathian Mountains and then back to Wismar, where a horrific plague is the perfect cover for Count Dracula's (Klaus Kinski) insatiable hunger.

The Blu-ray contains both the German and English language versions, which vary from each other quite a bit. The German version seems more lavish and epic. The English version feels slightly more rushed and is shot from different angles at times. Both versions are effective in their own ways, but I prefer the German over the English.

""Nosferatu the Vampyre"" is rated PG for violence, sensuality, and frightening/intense scenes. There's not as much blood and graphic brutality as you would expect from a horror movie made in the late 1970s. Herzog relied on the mood he set for each sequence, leaving the gore and violence off-screen and to your imagination. There's no nudity or sex scenes, although Dracula does some suggestive touching as he feeds on his prey. We're also privy to some heavy breathing by both the vampire and his victim.

Scream Factory delivers some enlightening special features for ""Nosferatu the Vampyre's"" high-definition debut. Director Werner Herzog provides entertaining audio commentary classic horror fans will enjoy. A vintage ""Making of 'Nosferatu'"" featurette gives us insight into the production of the movie. Theatrical trailers are found as well.

It's extremely evident ""Nosferatu the Vampyre"" is Werner Herzog's grand homage to the original silent film. It was the Director's way of bringing the masterpiece to the big-screen in a way F.W. Murnau could've only imagined when he made the original: in color, featuring audio, and using the actual names of the characters found in Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"" novel. Murnau was never allowed to do this because Stoker's widow wouldn't give him permission. It's Herzog's ultimate tribute to what he considers ""the greatest film ever to come out of Germany.""",1402531200,,3029,5.235051546391753

I was very disappointed in the treatment Shout has given this classic on blu ray. I hope you like reading subtitles, because the German version is the cleanest of the two prints. The English version is barely watchable because of all the video noise in the darker scenes. A BIG distraction in my book! Why could they not have used the newer BFI print (which was struck from 2K materials)? This is one time I am fortunate to have a region free player. I have ordered the UK blu ray from BFI that looks outstanding compared to these thrown together prints. Shout has been releasing sub par horror classics from the '80s (slasher films) and Nosferatu The Vampyre is beyond their scope. Criterion should have picked this one up and restored it to its proper glory. It is sad that this will probably be the only hi def version available here in the states. Shout needs to leave the artistic films to the companies that appreciate the fine art of film (and not treat it like schlock) where they get the respect they richly deserve.

Update May30, 2014: I have watched the BFI region B blu ray and it is FAR superior in video quality over the Shout version. There is heavy grain in some scenes, but it is the whole scene and not splotches like on Shout's. This seems to be inherit from the source BFI used to master this film for this disc.

999819,5,6305263299,"If you are familiar with the idiosyncratic cinema of Werner Herzog, especially the delirious qualities of his early work like AGUIRRE, WRATH OF GOD, then you'll know what to expect with NOSFERATU. It helps even more if you are familiar with the classic, silent 1922 original (which now exists on Blu-Ray in a fully restored version). If you come expecting a traditional vampire tale complete with lots of buxom maidens and lots of stakings (the Hammer approach), stop now before you get started as this is about as far from that as can possibly be imagined. Herzog has taken F.W. Murnau's unauthorized 1922 version, recreated the look of the film by using similar locations and costumes but has turned it into a metaphysical cinematic exploration of the concept of death and eternity. The film unfolds at a dreamlike pace which is aided immeasurably by a haunting score that incorporates some music from Wagner and Gounod. The opening credits, shot inside a Mexican cave full of mummies, set the tone immediately. This is no ordinary horror film, in fact it isn't a horror film at all. It's a reflection on the powers of good and evil and the ability (or inability) of rational thought to deal with it.

The storyline, like the 1922 film, is set in 1838. It has Jonathan Harker travelling to Dracula's castle in Transylvania. Dracula later charters a ship and brings himself, several coffins of earth, and plague ridden rats back to Harker's hometown in Germany and then pursues his wife. Only she knows what must be done to get rid of the vampire and proceeds to do it. In addition to the metaphysical angle, Herzog puts a decidedly feminist spin on the material by making her the savior because all the men are either too weak or too stupid to do anything about the circumstances. Even Van Helsing is a rational man faced with an irrational situation which paralyzes him. The three principal roles of Dracula (Klaus Kinski), Lucy (Isabelle Adjani) and Harker (Bruno Ganz) are perfectly cast. The supporting players, mostly non-professionals, fit in nicely. The film is mesmerizingly beautiful with several shots that will haunt you and music that will transfix you but probably only one out of three will really be able to get into it. Those who do could have a religious experience but most will find it way too slow. Make sure you watch the German version NOSFERATU, PHANTOM DER NACHT. The English language version (NOSFERATU THE VAMPYRE) doesn't really work.

It is a very creepy and interesting film and I really enjoyed it, however it's not one that will appeal to today's masses. It's very slowly paced and more psychological than a horror movie. The use of color, light, and music really set the gothic tone well. I can see this as a film that would be studied by film students more than one that would make for a movie night at home with friends. In fact, I think this one is best viewed alone, unless those with you are serious about watching this film.

999881,4,6305263299,"Nosferatu: The Vampire

I just got Werner Herzog's Nosferatu: The Vampyre (Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht). I'm 30 min's in & I can tell you this is a marvelous Dracula movie. It is faithful to the source material (except for the closing scene)but with Herzog at the controls & color available (though little used) it is the visual embodiment of the story of Dracula. Herzog is the world's best Documentarian & you wouldn't think that would lead to great fiction. In his case it does. He directed Aguirre: The Wrath of God & Fitzcarraldo along with many others including, Signs of Life. It's images, images, images conceived in such a way as to perfectly portray his subject matter & give rise in his viewer to what is going on in that character mentally & emotionally. No one is his equal at this. Back to the movie which anyone would not believe a man whose fame grew from documentaries would be capable of in a horror story. This is Halloween the holiday in a disc folks.

Finished it & I must say what an achievement. There is not one scene of violence in the whole movie unless you call Jonathan Harker nicking his finger at the dinner table violence. The ending scene strangely does not remotely follow the book & I will dock it a full point. 1/2 for not following the book & 1/2 because to me, the ending scene is the weakest part of the story. Dracula seems to be completely unaware of when crosses (supposed to cause Dracula great pain) are in the scene. Drac carries his coffin through a graveyard of crosses with no reaction then, when he puts his coffin down he turns & sees 2 that are 1/10 the size & cowers. When Drac visits Lucy in her bedroom she is wearing a silver cross (extremely potent) but Drac has no reaction again. I don't understand or forgive that. It is the first mistake of that magnitude I've seen in any of his films.

I can just hear the world's blood & gore horror crowd complaining about this atmospheric & apprehensive Dracula. The opening scene is perhaps the finest in the Horror genre. There is no blood at all to speak of. There is no crescendo after crescendo of horror. What there is is an oppressive & brooding sense of evil that is eminent, which never goes away, but carries throughout the common scenes as well as the uncommon encounters. I loved it. 8.5 out of 10 stars. Did I mention I was PO'ed about the crosses? Except for that though, the scene construction is superbly Herzog. I loved his use of music too.

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

My wife came home early to say, ""Let's watch Nosferatu with Klaus. I allowed my arm to be twisted. I also came up with another dissatisfaction. It's the character of Van Helsing. I understand they were intent on showing Dracula as a sympathetic character & to have a monomaniacal foe of all that's holy would be counterproductive. The milk-toast they make of him though is just wrong. This one is not the Dr. that rides in as help in a time of trouble. He is rather the epitome of the country Dr. Many have done this story with no Van Helsing at all & I think that would have been better. Keep the character that they used but don't call him Van Helsing. I'll deduct another 1/2 point for that & make it 8 out of 10 stars after a second viewing. As my wife said after seeing it, ""Aguirre was 10 out of 10. This one isn't, yet the imagery is as good & the brooding evil never leaves.""

Nosferatu: The Vampyre (English version)

On my disc it isn't cut at all. Not even one scene. The English version comes from a dirtier source print. Snow is bad at the beginning & slowly fades for about 20-25 min's then it is gone. I didn't notice a whole lot of camera angle changes but what was evident was an overall use of slightly less light. You can really see that in the backlighting of Count Dracula as he walks down the corridor to Jonathon Harker's room. It is noticeable throughout however. It steals the sheen off of fabrics causing it to appear less contrast was used. The ending doesn't change at all.

My wife pointed out & I agree that Shadow of the Vampire is better done. Max Schreck in that is as eerie & imposing with more latitude given for intensity. Willem Defoe against Klaus Kinski is a ""can't lose"" match on maniacal expression & I'll see both of these many times over the years.

999885,5,6305263299,"This movie is really something special. What I like to say is that it's not my favorite version of Dracula, but it's probably my favorite Vampire movie. What I mean by that is that it is definitely a very unique adaption of Dracula, basically a remake of the first (unauthorized) film adaption of the Dracula story, the silent film Nosferatu, A Symphony of Horror, and it's very much interprets the Dracula story in a very distinct way that is not like the iconic story we've come to know. In many ways I think it recognizes aspects of what Dracula truly was that no other adaption has personified. But it's also more of a ""retelling"" than a straight adaption, as much it's own thing as it is a Dracula story. What makes it brilliant is that here we have a vampire that is absolutely creepy and yet you don't run away from him and he creeps on you very slowly and yet you don't jump away, you're just sort of frozen there, fascinated and terrified. It's the opposite of what I hate about horror movies, it's all ambiance and the horror is even more devastating without the shrieking. It's the personification of what the vampire is, if not the personification of what we expect from a Dracula film (the perfect Dracula film is still yet to be made).

I very much recommend the two disc edition by Anchor Bay. They shot the speaking roles of this movie both in English and in German. Both are great and I like being able to watch a movie in my own language without a dubbing or looking at the subtitles. But the actors definitely seem to be a little more natural in their own language (the German version). I consider both versions legitimate versions (which I don't extend to dubbing) and after I watched one, not knowing what to expect, I then put on the other just fascinated with picking up the nuances I might have missed in the other version.

I can't recommend this movie highly enough, unless you just want the same old modern formula movie, in which case you really shouldn't ever take any of my recommendations.",1361059200,3,2020,4.516393442622951

Slow, but fascinating, ""Nosferatu the Vampyre,"" is basically an expanded remake of the German expressionist art film, ""Nosferatu,"" 1922.

""Nosferatu the Vampyre"" recreates the original faithfully, while filling in the intentionally left blank spaces of the original to keep Bram Stoker's widow from suing for copyright infringement of the book, which she did sue, & won. For years the original film was thought lost.

Beautifully filmed, & with breath taking scenery & grim locations all in one, ""Nosferatu the Vampyre"" makes for an ethereal cinematic experience. Of huge note is the make up for Klause Kinski as ""Count Orlock,"" or I should say ""Count Dracula,"" as he is named in this English version. It is if Max Shreck has been reincarnated! Resurrected from the grave to once again perform his classic role! The resemblance is uncanny!

""Nosferatu the Vampyre,"" achieves the same eerie expressionism of it's predecessor, but in color & sound, due to director Werner Herzog's great eye for detail & the atmospheric spirit of the original, which is a major feat in it's self!

Murnau's ""Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror,"" a little silent film that managed to scare the unholy Hell out of me. It was a poorly-scored copy of the movie from one of those 50-pack DVD box-sets of ""The Greatest Horror Movies Ever Made,"" and it was my favorite out of all of them. Orlok (Dracula) and Hutter (Harker) were great characters that lit up the silver screen in a way I'd never seen before.

What seems like an eternity later, now in my mid-20s, I discovered that Werner Herzog, the man who made the documentary ""Grizzly Man"" (Which I was a big fan of!) had previously directed a remake of Murnau's silent classic, with the original character names from Bram Stoker's novel reinstalled to their rightful players. Needless to say, this movie is like ""The Shining"" meets ""Dracula,"" it's a slow-paced, but visually overwhelming and delightful film full of fun and scares that will entertain horror fans of all ages.

1000004,4,6305263299,"NOSFERATU THE VAMPYRE serves as a direct remake to F.W. Murnau's original, and retains much of the same German Expressionist stylism while offering a new twist on the Stoker legend. Nosferatu serves as a physical embodiment of the plague, and his arrival in Wismar marks the beginning of the end for the small town. The Count bears a close resemblance to the rats that he carries with him, with Klaus Kinski's portrayal displaying the same haunting visage and mannerisms that Max Schreck had created fifty years earlier. Unlike Schreck, Kinski offers a morose and pitiful creature that has been forced to endure countless centuries alone, which is told through his sullen expressions and deep set eyes. In this rendition, we find an unlikely hero in the reluctant Lucy, who finds the world crumbling around her as the city succumbs to the plague and her betrothed Jonathan returns from Transylvania having forgotten all that he loved. Isabelle Adjani is stunningly beautiful with flawless features, and the stark contrasts of her make-up design placed within the dreary settings make her almost as ghost-like and surreal as Nosferatu himself. There are numerous haunting scenes of empty streets, dilapidated castles, and punch drunk plague victims that all contribute to the dreamy atmosphere and mood of the entire film. In the end, the film feels like a unique bridge between the Expressionism of the original and the depressing realism Jean Rollin brought to the genre in France. It is a dark and depressing Dracula entry that serves as a solid watch!

See the extraodinary original and then the brilliant remake.

Filmmaker F.W. Marnau's ""Nosferatu, Eine Symphonie Des Grauens"" (1922) is the first in a long line of vampire films.  Marnau freely adapted Bram Stoker's Dracula but Stoker's widow recognized similarities and sued Marnau and all prints of Marnau's film were ordered destroyed!

But a few copies of landmark and exquisite German expressionistic masterpiece escaped and were the inspiration for German writer-director Werner Herzog's remake ""Nosferatu: The Vampyre"" (1979).

Klaus Kinski's pale makeup, pointed ears, long fingernails and mannered gestures will unnerve in this atmospheric, deliberately paced, fever-dream of a movie.  Isabelle Adjani co-stars as the distraught wife of Bruno Ganz's Jonathan Harker, who comes under the blood spell of Kinski's magnificent creature.  The music, mood and images will reverberate long after the movie ends.  The DVD includes the German language version with English subtitles as well as a full-length, but slightly different English version and a most unusual bonus commentary by Herzog himself.

Herzog's a genius and his cinema art will continue to penetrate our increasingly bifurcated self-aware and superficlal pop culture.

The beautiful box art is almost worth the cost of the DVD!

This film really captured the essence of the famous original and allowed me to see what the original film maker might have captured on the film if he were making the movie today. The film appears to have been filmed on location in Europe (the castle looks very credible and perhaps found on location??) and this adds to the charm, and in some cases otherworldly effect of the movie which was a shear pleasure to watch.",1250208000,,522,4.623655913978495

1000009,5,6305263299,"As one would expect from Herzog, this is a version of the Dracula story that is turned upside down:  the hero is Lucy (the sister who is turned into a vampire in other versions), who understands what the count really is and seeks to destroy him all alone.  Van Helsing in this version must be dragged along to see the truth, as he is a doddering old man at the end of his career and capacities to think.  Indeed, he is a useless scientist.  The time is also earlier, pre-industrial and with echos of the Middle Ages, even though it must be the 17C.

Kinsky is absolutely brilliant as Dracula, in one of his best performances.  Rather than the sexual magnetism that Lugosi or Oldham exuded with such charisma, he is pathetically aware that he can only prey on love and humanity, from a distance.  But he is compelled by blood lust.  Kinski really doesn't look at all human, but a true creature of the night.  Adjani was never more beautiful and depressed.

Dracula's arrival in Germany brings a far greater evil than just himself, again portrayed as the breakdown of all order and decency.  Adjani  walks through the town center, deserted except for those accepting death as a celebration, in a stunning reflection of medieval images of plague.  They grab her, want her to dance with them, but she pursues her higher purpose.

The most shocking part is the end, totally unexpected and ominous, yet without overt horror.  Again, perfectly done:  not hollywood slick, but projecting the horror and its power into the unknown future.  Only Herzog can do this so effectively.

Recommended warmly.  It is poetry of horror.",1240704000,3,1616,4.707142857142857
1000010,5,6305263299,"Herzog's remake of the F.W.Murnau masterpiece of 1922, is one of the most beautifully realized films on the vampire ever made. Alot of the film appears shot for shot, but Herzog adds his own touch to the proceedings that makes the images indelible. Herzog's film lacks the creepiness of the Murnau film and certainly Kinski can not frighten the same way that Max Schreck could in the silent original. This version brings more of a sense of pathos to the vampire and Kinski brings one of his most nuanced performances, so subtle and so menacing. The cast aids him well, especially Isabella Adjani who is gorgeous as Mina, the woman Nosferatu pines for and Bruno Ganz, whose transformation from meek Clerk to Vampire is downright chilling. The film is also aided immeasurably by a lush, classical film score that brings a sense of doom and epic quality to the gorgeous on location photography, several of which are similar to what Murnau had in his film.

There are two different versions of the film, one shot in German,the other in English. Many prefer the German, but I tend to enjoy them both for what they offer. Special Features include some SERIOUSLY creepy theatrical trailers and a behind the scenes feature with Herzog. There's also a commentary track on the German version provided by Herzog that is both informative and enlightening.

This is one splendid DVD set and highly reccomended for the Horror and Foreign film fan seeking out a more artistic fright film to review. A cinema essential along with it's illustrious original.",1239062400,,1540,4.874045801526718
1000011,4,6305263299,"As a youngster, I remember seeing a clip of the original Nosferatu on television - some sort of movie monster documentary, I assume - and I still remember that image of Max Schrek, hunched over and roaming the deck of the ship that brings him to Germany, with his grasping, outstretched claws, and the unreal shade of the sky behind him.  In all the years following, I've never tracked down a copy of the whole film - I'm afraid the impression I have from that singular memory of thirty or more years ago would be dulled by the affects of age on both myself and on the film.

Instead, I have Werner Herzog's vision as a substitute, allowing me to preserve the terrible image I remember, and, I had hoped, to enhance it with a more modern experience.  Unfortunately, when competing against a memory from childhood, the present will almost always fail, and for me, Herzog's 'Nosferatu' suffered in comparison with the tiny scrap of the original I remember.

That doesn't mean that Herzog turned in a substandard effort, or that Kinski's Dracula (Count Orlock in the original) isn't amazing.  But I thought the emphasis Herzog was looking for was not so much horror, but the pathetic inhumanity of the creature, and his even more pathetic longing for love and his own destruction.

What makes both editions of 'Nosferatu' different from the raft of other vampire movies is the portrayal of the creature.  Kinski and Schrek offered us a picture of a demon, a diseased vermin feeding on humans.  Late in the movie, when Kinski bites Lucy Harker's neck, the image is grotesque and disturbing - as it should be.  In more mainstream films, the vampire's more unappealing traits are either subdued, or transformed into innocuous necessities, and the vampiric powers are portrayed in a enviable light (Torch light, I suppose).  Want to live forever?  Be young and beautiful forever?  Join an exciting group of other young and beautiful people forever?  Take this one step further and add an erotic element and you have an very iconic if false image.  No need to worry about that with Kinski.  There can only be a very small, if not nonexistant, group to fetishize his demon.

I was surprised to see how closely Herzog followed Bram Stoker's storyline, as I was under the impression that the original was a quite different story.  Regardless, once again Johnathan Harker is dispatched by his superior Renfield to Transylvania, to Castle Dracula to conclude a business arrangement with the Count.  He arrives and is offered a meal by Dracula, and Kinski is so over the top in his makeup while he looms over Harker (Bruno Ganz), staring at him with such longing that I laughed out loud.  From there, Dracula learns of Harker's wife Lucy, and his obsession begins.  He quickly leaves for Germany, leaving the hapless Harker to follow as best he can while suffering from the Vampire's bite.

In 'Nosferatu', when Dracula arrives, the townsfolk are convinced the plague has descended upon them, and Herzog uses some fantastic imagery of rats and coffins and a town gone mad.  But there also seems to be a remoteness to the film, something that at all times kept me from suspending belief and engaging with the film.  Mostly this is because there are no characters to throw your support behind.  Dracula is too repulsive and Harker is too weak (and foolish).  Lucy is the only heroic character, but her screen time is too short, and Van Helsing plays an ineffectual and disbelieving doctor.  We are left with the true hero of most of Herzog's films, which is the captured image on the screen itself.

Horror fans are likely to be disappointed with the film, but I would consider it a must see for Klaus Kinski admirers.  If you have enjoyed other Herzog movies, then I would also recommend 'Nosferatu' for its departure into genre territory.  And though I enjoyed it, it still pales in comparison to the tiny scrap of memory I have of Count Orlock, stalking toward the camera, looking for his next victim.",1235088000,,3988,4.764192139737991
1000012,5,6305263299,"Nosferatu should absolutely be respected for it's contribution to, and advancement of, the film industry and particularly horror movies. The film offers special effects that were cutting edge at the time and still maintain some of their power in creating terror and tension. I had reservations about watching Nosferatu. Since I love movies that make good use of sound, the idea of silent film didn't interest me. I had similar prejudices toward the special effects, cinematography, acting, etc. I figured Nosferatu was a classic for purely nostalgic reasons. I mean, how could anybody actually enjoy a movie that could have been shot by a seventeen-year-old with a crappy camera? How naive I was...

Nosferatu is an exercise in brilliant film-making. Murnau's heavy investment on the look of the film pays off. The film is fun to watch. The acting is over the top, which is necessary to avoid constant cuts to dialog cards. The music is great, too. Chilling and expressive without being overbearing.",1232064000,,999,5.091463414634147

1000090,5,6305263299,"Werner Herzog is an artist out of his time....and that's a very good thing for lovers of great films. His own great 1979 film Nosferatu, Phantom Of The Night (Nosferatu, Phantom Der Nacht), which was released in America as Nosferatu, The Vampire, is less a classic vampire film and more a Post-Apocalyptic tale, having more in common (especially image-wise) with films like On The Beach, The Quiet Earth, the Vincent Price classic The Last Man On Earth (based on Richard Matheson's I Am Legend), and even the first Night Of The Living Dead, than with the Hollywood Dracula mythos, and even its silent filmic predecessor, Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau's 1922 classic Nosferatu, A Symphony of Horrors (Nosferatu, Eine Symphonie Des Grauens), because Herzog is a filmmaker not afraid to turn his camera eye on ugliness, and use that as a way to limn reality better and more clearly in his search for his own `ecstatic truth.' Herzog has always specialized in eye level realism, wherein he generally eschews those glossy gorgeous postcard-like shots that many filmmakers often substitute for depth, and this results in his ability to push his stories forward without relying on obvious techniques, substituting elements that hit at a viewer's instinctual reactions rather than merely the intellectual. This comes from his great screenplays, such as this one, which are usually his own creations; albeit with a little help from the novel he adapted it from, Bram Stoker's Dracula.
  This 107 minute film melds the best parts of Murnau's classic film with the Dracula legendry we all know, yet is unlike either, nor any other vampire film ever made. The film is not a remake nor an homage, which it is usually lazily called, but an artistic vampire of a vampire of a vampire film, because, unlike the silent film, the Count is called Dracula, not Orlock, for by the time Herzog made his film Dracula had fallen into public domain. The original film weathered legal litigation for copyright infringement from the Stoker estate, but this film, part of the 1970s wave of New German Cinema (Das Neue Kino)- which were really the troika of Herzog, Wim Wenders, and Rainer Werner Fassbinder, is possibly that loose movement's height; although one might argue Herzog's own earlier masterpiece Aguirre: The Wrath Of God was its pinnacle. It was filmed in the Dutch town of Delft, in English, to satisfy American investors' demands for marketability in the United States, and then dubbed into German, with subtitles for other countries. Several of Herzog's films were done this way, including Aguirre and Fitzcarraldo.... The camera work by Jorg Schmidt-Reitwein is among the best in not only the Herzog canon, but in all of film. It is subdued, subtly shifts color palettes depending upon the mood of the lead characters, makes use of shadows the way the black and white classics of Carl Theodor Dreyer do, and has a colorful monochrome which dissonates the expectations of the viewer, much as the slow motion images of bats in flight- borrowed from a science documentary, do. The fact that the bat sequences are also drenched in a great film score only adds to the moments. Yet, this is Herzog at his best, whether stealing from himself- note the raft load of black coffins going down yet another river, or pioneering hand held shots in an age when they were eschewed, all to further the sense of the real, the vaunted eye level realism that shows the past as it was- dirty, grimy, and filled with generally pathetic souls, just as his earlier The Enigma Of Kaspar Hauser did.
  Yet Herzog never is heavyhanded in his use of artistic techniques. Look at the subversive symbolism in a shot of Dracula in the town square, when a ring of streetlamps in the background blur to form a diadem or halo about his pate. This can be interpreted several ways, but the interpretation is not as important as the very boldness such a shot entails. Or note how emotional scenes are never displayed closeup, as in Hollywood tearjerkers, but from a distance, and usually shot from behind the actors- a technique Herzog manifestly borrowed from Ingmar Bergman. He also allows the viewer to fill in narrative interstices with what is known from the Dracula mythos, thereby focusing on character- not horror, which is immanent in all vampire tales. This allows him to throw in narrative dissonances and unexpected moments, such as Dracula's clock chiming at midnight, or the appearance of a strangely deformed dwarf man to arrest Van Helsing, yet having no legal authority nor knowledge nor power to do so. Both of these moments are absurd, but horrible in the most existential sense. Their absurdity and displacement from conventions foster a feeling of illogic that gnaws at a viewer who cannot grasp why, thus making its unknown provenance another bit of horror.
  Also, consider the film's end, where Lucy sacrifices herself in vain, becoming a vampire of the vampire by passively, then actively, soliciting his feeding upon her neck. Only Herzog could make a death-obsessed seductress out of a victim. In all of the films of his, I have never witnessed a single clich&eacute;d nor trite scene, image, nor even moment. This fact lifts Herzog not only into the top rank of filmmakers, but of artists of all time, alongside Shakespeare, Beethoven, Mozart, and Picasso. His great film is one of the finest character studies of a wholly fictive character ever filmed, for it first deconstructs, then reconstructs, then recontextualizes the whole mythos from the fairy tale horror many critics see Dracula as embodying, to a symbol of the worst of humanity- not its evil, but its cowardice and inaction. Only Lucy takes action, but because of her being alone in doing so she is doomed, as might be the whole world that Jonathan Harker rides away to infect. Sadly, I know what Lucy feels. Thanks, Werner.",1221436800,,5864,4.930161943319838
1000091,5,6305263299,"Almost every scene reminded me of something else: not just Murnau. Although there was dialogue, it could easily have been silent, with dialogue cards, since very little of the information was verbal.  No one had more than a few lines. Visually, a lot of the shots were 100% Caspar David Friedrich. Adjani from the back, looking out to sea. There was a bit of Coleridge and Dor's Ancient Mariner. A bit of Fssli.  A bit of the Pied Piper of Hamelin, Browning if not Grimm. The Woman in White? Was there a bit of Rocky Horror? The geography  fascinated. How do you get to Transylvania? Either overland on horseback, and by hitching a ghost coach, or by ship from the Dardenelles via the Bay of Biscay. If you go north from Wismar, which actually seems to be Delft, you get to Riga. If you do the subtitles, a van becomes a von. Jonathan is too straight and dumb to be anything but English, but Reinfeld ? --- Swiss? Austrian? Bavarian? Levantine? Carpathian?  At one point I almost thought I was in Wales, where I have been. Nothing matters that much in this Wunderland, which should defuse it, but still it works. Held the attention in spite of the pace.

1000092,4,6305263299,"Viewers who pick up this film expecting a good old Hollywood vampire horror flick will be utterly disappointed, because Herzog's ""Nosferatu"" just isn't intended as a scary movie.  Herzog uses the Dracula legend, as did the expressionist film maker Murnau, as a vehicle for a film with a non-horror genred message.

In the commentary accompanying the disk, Herzog says that he wants to establish continuity with the greatest period of German cinema, the expressionist era.  The themes that preoccupied the early expressionists (in addition to innovative cinematic technique) are the cultural ones explored here by Herzog:  the limits of human knowledge, the dark, wild side of humans, the arrogance of the Enlightenment, the loneliness of life, chaos, the certainty of death.  As poor Nosferatu says at one point in the film, ""The absence of love is the most abject pain.""  Exploring claims like this, not scaring an audience with gore, is what Herzog is up to.

The plague (la peste) plays a larger role in Herzog's version than in Murnau's.  Like Camus, perhaps Herzog wants to suggest the ubiquity of death and decay, and the different ways in which people respond to mortality.  Some, like Lucy (played by Isabelle Adjani, who wonderfully vamps and at times overacts to match the cinematic style of Greta Schroder in Murnau's 1922 ""Nosferatu""), defy it with loving self-sacrifice.  Others, like van Helsing (played by Walter Landengast, who also features in Herzog's ""Caspar Hauser""), deny it out of scientific hubris; others, like the anonymous people in the doomed town square who in Brueghel-like style make antic revel in the face of death, throw themselves into diversions.  But in the end, everyone shares the same fate, as Herzog suggests in that wonderful and terrifying scene in which columns of coffins, held aloft by an army of black-clothed undertakers, converge on the empty town square.  This scene, by the way, is as perfect a one as Herzog has ever choreographed.

Herzog's film is loaded with irony, which is probably his way of saying that there are no happy endings to life.  Lucy sacrifices herself to slay Nosferatu (played by Kinski, who--thankfully--doesn't get a lot of screentime in the film), but the threat of death continues, because Jonathan (played by Bruno Ganz), emerges at film's end as one of the undead.  Van Helsing's arrogant refusal to admit that any corner of reality isn't absolutely open to scientific explanation is finally defeated by Lucy's example.  Liberating himself from his small scientific worldview, he quite heroically drives a stake through Nosferatu's heart--only to be arrested as a murderer.  The one guarantee in life is that there are no guarantees, and that life is painful.  In fact, as Herzog explains in the accompanying documentary, all his films are born from pain.

One of Herzog's finest experiments in film.  My only regret is that apparently a great deal of the antic revels in the town square wound up on the cutting room floor (some of the deleted scenes are shown in the documentary).  They would've made Brueghel proud.",1217030400,3,3094,5.075098814229249
1000093,5,6305263299,This is the first Werner Herzog movie I've seen and now I'm interested in seeing his other movies.  As a big Dracula fan I can tell you this DVD rates in my top three list of the best Dracula movies.  For those who do not like subtitles there are two versions here.  I think the German version is superior. Enjoy!,1216598400,,313,4.183333333333334
1000094,3,6305263299,"Werner Herzog is one of those self-proclaimed cinematic geniuses who writes, produces, directs, takes the tickets ... all that. Some years ago he undertook to remake the 1922 silent classic, ""Nosferatu"". The result is the 1979 flick, ""Nosferatu the Vampyre"". The last word isn't exactly a misspelling: they often spelled it that way in the Victorian and Edwardian eras. Nowadays it's an affectation, and this little anachronism ought to give us a clue as to the film's (apparent) true intent. This isn't so much a remake as a parody ... it's not ""Dracula: Dead and Loving It"" (alas), but rather an almost-humorless Teutonic parody. Once you get past the deliberate dead-panning, it's hilarious.

Now, I have no proof of this, other than the evidence (which, of course, is evidence in court). One correspondent assures me that Werner Herzog hasn't got a ""parody"" bone in his body and that his comments on the DVD version of the film don't begin to speculate about the merest suspicion of a contemplation of the containing of even a hint of such a thing. Well, how do you make a good dead-pan parody if you then admit it?

But consider the evidence. Although this is a remake of the original Nosferatu, some things have been done to bring it closer to the traditional ""Dracula"" story -- primarily the introduction of Dr. Van Helsing. There's a big clue -- in this film Van Helsing absolutely doesn't believe in vampires until the very last few minutes. And then he takes it into his head to drive a stake into Dracula, who has already been killed by sunlight. The overkill is a nice parody touch.

The relationships between the basic characters has changed. Lucy is Mrs. Harker, and Harker works for Renfield. The last, although he apparently has never laid eyes on Dracula, is (also apparently) under his spell -- he giggles at lot for no good reason: a manic Dr. Hibbert. In fact, the only character in the film who believes (a) in vampires and (b) that Dracula is one is Lucy (who, in the original story, has no such opinions). Van Helsing is a local doctor who has decided that local victims of the vampire have died of plague. It's true that the ship that brought Dracula also brought a bunch of rats ... scads and slathers of white (!!) rats, or perhaps oversize lab mice. Whenever they appear, they are shown in exaggerated piles and clumps, like hundreds of malformed puppies.

Parody here is often in the little details. Dracula's chiming clock, with a prominent skull on top and a skeleton going in and out doors below, is a great bit of guignol, but wonderfully out of place otherwise. And of course the music. Most of it is by Popul Vuh (often oddly folksy but usually appropriately creepy), but some is by Wagner -- specifically a few moments from the prelude to Rheingold. It's music related to the Rhein and the creation of the world. The music appears in 2 scenes, for both of which it is wholly inappropriate due both to the general character of the music and to its meaning in the Wagnerian universe. The scenes are: Harker travelling through a mountain pass to Dracula's castle and Dracula moving his coffins off-ship to his new home. Such use of this music is -- as Hertzog would well know -- laughable.

There is also the question of black-suited, black-hatted morticians/pallbearers. There seems to be quite a population of these people in Wismar (a canal-laced ancient city in Mecklenburg, near the Baltic Sea). At one point a whole parade of them bring out the coffins of the dead. It appears that everyone in Wismar is dying except these macabre individuals. Their march-with-coffins is a masterpiece of dark humor. Remembering it still drives me to laughter.

Finally, there is Klaus Kinsky's performance of Dracula. Critics have minced no words about how wonderful it is, how creepy, how appropriate. It seems to me that Kinsky isn't so much creepy as somnolent, as if he had a really bad case of weltschmerz. A vampire is one of the great powers of the supernatural world: a shape-shifter, preternaturally strong, a powerful mesmeriser. Kinsky seems more meserized. As a vampire he is diffident and shy, almost apologetic about being what he is. How brilliant!  This isn't playing to type but playing against it. And that, friends, is parody. Or, to quote Warner Brothers, ""Now, THAT'S comedy!""",1209168000,2,4320,4.7828418230563
1000095,5,6305263299,"Werner Herzog's 1979 german remake of  the F.W. Murnau's 1922 classic silent-horror epic masterpiece, is also the most gothic, cruel, lavish and intensely dark and creepy revision of the classic novel of Bram Stoker. Klaus Kinski's arrogant, sickly, and tubercular looks gives life to a Nosferatu that tracends the limits of disturbing charisma and maniac-agressiveness, turning the infamous classic character into an  eerie and sympathetic vampire, consumed with sadness and melancholy  and corroded by the terrible curse of inmortality. Turned into a self-aware ghoulish and almost spectral vision, his pain over his own malediction  is shown in such a dramatic fiber in the film, a tangible reality of shame and fear: hidding behind his long nails, the facial expressions of Kinki's Nosferatu reflects a whole world of suffering and affliction never acomplished before, and never matched until today. A pain that the monster wants to inflict back to humanity for the decaying life-in-death curse that's  devouring his agonizing existence. In the present days, the mythology, the sense and deepness of the curse of vampirism, the sadness and loneliness of the ghoul are almost dissapeared, giving total space and importance to the horror imagery and graphic aesthetics of the  colosal strenght of the night creature made of fangs, wings and the lust of the insatiable blood-thirst, regardless of the monster's condition of victim or devoted killer.

This masterpiece in horror cinema and artistic quality gem, was the last great raw portrayal of the real  and hellish myth of the vampire within the cursed character. Without spilling a single drop of blood and exclusively based on costumes with no special effects, and not being excessively scary but dramatic, this dark and atmospheric universe is so intense and creepy, that it invades our very primal fears, thanks to the awesome performance of the disturbing Kinski and a haunting, electronic and  powerful score that turns the ambient into an actual nightmare. Another factor worth mention is the innocent and luminous aura of the often  under-written character of Lucy, played by a young and beautiful Isabelle Adjani, as the perfect counter for the nasty and opaque count.

Herzog's Nosferatu is still an evil dark force who terrorizes a small german village with diabolic cruelty in the form of a plague that can't be forgiven, but we can't help to feel sorry for this lost and derranged remain of a soul. The surrealist creepiness of the plague itself, with wandering sheep and goats in the town square, and the aesthetics of the vampire based on the original B&W silent classic, turn this movie into a must see for fans of gothic horror, nightmare ambients, and extremely disturbing characters.

This is one of the best accomplished and most deep and artistical vampire movies ever made, and one of the most succesful colaborations between Werner Hezrog and Klaus Kinski, after the monumental epic drama ""Aguirre, the wrath of god"", another masterful portrayal of madness and lost humanity. Few movies at the time had the courage to let aside the bloody and expected violence of the vampire as a hidden monster behind a gentleman's cape and fine charms, to focus with such visceral greatness and deepness in the exploration of the creature as a true, honest, unique and evil ""whole"". This unique and final landmark in horror filmaking destroyed and buried the previous collective ""vintage"" imagery and feel of the Christopher Lee-like standard character, those classic movies seemed like children's fairytales compared to this monument of cold fear.

A truly outstanding masterpiece that you can find in this great DVD edition, wich contains the two known  versions: English dubbed, that loses a bit of agresiveness but has better sound quality , and the original German version with 11 extra minutes and definetly the choice to behold. This gothic and ancient-looks work of art deserves to be considered a classic not only in horror, but in cinema in general.",1208131200,5,4023,5.178736517719568
1000096,5,6305263299,"If life is but a dream, then Herzog's re-imagining of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/F-W-Murnau-s-classic-horror-film/dp/B000VUQ4HW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">F.W. Murnau's classic horror film</a>&nbsp;is a splendid nightmare.  The film begins in the dreams of Lucy Harker, her mind's eye rolling over mummified corpses in a catacomb to the lull of strangely soothing demonic chants.  Roused from her beautiful nightmare with a scream, Lucy is comforted back to sleep by her dull husband, Jonathan.  Her head touches the pillow again, and Herzog's Nosferatu begins.

There are so many brilliant things about this film, but perhaps its greatest strength is the sense that Lucy never wakes up again.  The harsh, contemptible reality of the next morning, scored with sickeningly syrupy music, and adorned with overwhelming sun blindingly reflected on harsh whites while the persistent chirp of young kittens in the background almost makes one nauseous, slowly and gradually gives way to the beautiful dream reality of the night, which gratuitously blankets everything by the film's end.  As Harker undertakes his mission into the Carpathian Mountains, strongly desiring to get away from his boring hometown ""where canals go nowhere,"" the sun begins its descent and camera-work, sound, music, and even acting grow richer with the sun's slow demise.

For most of the film, Klaus Kinsky proves to be the richest ingredient, as one would expect.  He is awkward, decrepit, dangerous, and beautiful; a true testament to the Gothic.  Kinsky is almost unrecognizable in his makeup, movements, and general characterization.  There is no&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aguirre-Wrath-of-God/dp/6305972761/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aguirre, Wrath of God</a>&nbsp;to be found within any crinkle of his ghastly face.  He is thoroughly inhuman, thoroughly disturbing, and yet thoroughly deserving of our pathos at many points in this rich film.

What surprises me most about this film, though, beyond the brilliant lighting, eerie framing and movement (often with shots that come directly from Murnau), and even the masterful performance of Klaus Kinsky, is the presence of Lucy Harker (played by Isabelle Adjani) in the film's final act.  When we first see Lucy in harsh daylight at the beginning of this film, she is pretty, yet boring and restrained.  The true beauty and vivacity that she beheld in the twilight hours between nightmares has been wiped from her face, and it's hard to blame Harker for leaving her in search of Count Dracula, even though we know it's wrong.  Yet, as the film descends into gothic darkness, Lucy is slowly and surely transformed, more sullen and more beautiful each time we revisit her.  By the final act, Lucy is left as our reluctant protagonist, nearly as pale as Count Dracula and far more beautiful and deserving of our pathos as even she recognizes her slow journey toward inevitable death.  It is nearly impossible to resist falling in love with Adjani as we watch her wrestle faith and love with demons, both physical and mental.

The climax is wrought with gothic dreams and cinematic visions blurring with contemptible reality.  Acting is incomprehensibly potent, cinematography and scoring euphorically reek of death and, finally, as the light of day brings a brilliant final twist to the age old story of Count Dracula, Herzog sets us out into a quiet raging storm of day and night intermixing passionately.  It is an unforgettable moment, beautiful in its strangeness and depression -- a perfect summary of Herzog's masterpiece.

Nosferatu, Phantom Der Nacht, is the perfect marriage of Herzog's vision with one of the silent era's greatest triumphs.  It takes the dream-like qualities of the silent horror film and transports them into a more able vessel with a brilliant navigator roped to the helm.",1202601600,2,3920,5.575042158516021

I'm not a film historian or anything, so I can't say it's the ""best,"" but after watching ALL those Dracula films, I can say that it is my absolute favorite of them all.

This film is stunning, to say the least.  There are no cheap or cheesy ""Hollywood"" tricks - for example: hundreds of LIVE rats are used in this film, as are LIVE bats instead of silly rubber things on strings.
I don't really want to say too much that would give away every charm of this film, but
Klaus Kinski made an excellent Count (the best Nosferatu, in my opinion), and Isabelle Adjani was the most beautiful Lucy of them all.

Very, very excellent remake.  I highly recommend it to any Dracula fan - or even a non-Dracula fan.

In 1979, at a time when the copyright for Dracula had entered the public domain, Herzog proceeded with his updated version of the classic German film, which could now include the original character names. {wikipedia}",1195689600,,414,4.928571428571429

1000140,3,6305263299,"A visually compelling and idealogically fascianting film, Herzog's inernationally acclaimed version of NOSFERATU doesn't measure up to F.W. Murnau's silent-era orginal.  Herzog's Dracula (as performed by actor Klaus Kinski) is a reluctant angel of death, consumed more by unrequitted love and melancholy than bloodlust.  Though Kinski certainly looks scary thanks to a fine make-up job, he rarely manages to infuse his role with any real menace.  Even when he pays an uninvited visit to Lucy (Isabelle Adjani), Dracula fails to impress either the viewer or his intended victim and must slink away like a whipped dog.  As the heroine, the aforementioned Adjani is beautiful but cold, much like the relationship between she and her husband Jonathon (played by Bruno Ganz).  In Murnau's original, the young couple were clearly passionately in love with one another; Herzog takes that passion away from his characters, and as a result the viewer never feels the empathy with them that the original generates (particularly for Lucy).  Herzog's Van Helsing is weak and ineffectual, and like all the other characters never establishes any sort of rapport with the viewer.  The role of Renfield is played for camp and falls flat, jarring terribly with the sombre, even dreary tone of the rest of the film.  Though it is interesting to compare Herzog's version with Murnau's, Herzog has not given us a very powerful film. It is as though he purposely wants to keep the audience at arms-lenth, and at no point in the story is there any on-screen energy.  Cinematography is excellent, however, and Herzog's NOSFERATU could certainly never be criticized for being overly violent or gory, as there is virtually none of either.  Unfortunately, neither is there any supsense or character empathy--deadly to a story that is inherently character-driven.  Ultimately there is no reason for a fan of the original to watch the remake, save for curiosity's sake.",1192752000,8,1941,5.189102564102564

The film is undeniably Herzog's and has many of his signature signs - the stunning views, the slow deliberate pace, the eerie music, the dreamlike atmosphere, the admiration by the nature and its indifferent to the humans' worries power and remote beauty; even the story of the ship with all crew members dead as the result of the horrible mystery. Breathtakingly beautiful Isabelle Adjani plays an object of Dracula's obsession and the contrast between his ugliness and her divine beauty is simply mesmerizing.

1000147,5,6305263299,"A remake of Murnau's Nosferatu. It speaks and it is full of colour. Very standard remake but a few changes are difficult to explain. For instance Mina and Lucy are inverted and Jonathan is married to Lucy. It may be Bremen but it looks like Amsterdam but with the sea next door. We have the same idea of a plague. But the director takes liberty with this plague and seems to organize at the end of it some kind of open air festivity and Last Supper for the survivors soon to be dead anyway. Morbid in other words. Herzog keeps the ending in which Lucy sacrifices herself by giving herself to Dracula to make him trespass the cock's crowing line. And she succeeds. A vampire in love is thus very silly and selfless enough to forget his survival instinct. But Herzog doubles up the ending with a good stake planted in Dracula's heart, but in the wings, and the arrest of Van Helsing for the murder of Dracula. He will be tried sooner or later. But the best change is that Lucy is dead and Jonathan has completed his transformation and has become a full-fledged vampire and we recapture the ending of the original where the danger of a next generation was left open. Here it is clearly stated and we see Jonathan crossing Europe again on horseback probably to go to his castle in Transylvania. The main interest of the film is not there. The main interest is in the phenomenal actors used for the main three characters and of course the absolutely astounding make-up of these actors. In other words, make-up added, this film recaptures the phenomenal body language and body expressivity of the old Murnau's film. It explains the fact that it does not seem to have very rich dialogues. It is all happening in the movement and syntax of the bodies on the screen.

1000198,5,6305263299,"Not an adaption of ""Dracula"" so much a quasi-remake of ""Nosferatu,"" the film rises out the long gliding shadow of the original thanks to the genius tag team of Kinski and Herzog, who are ambitious enough to actually re-interpret the material instead of simply re-creating it.  In one of his all time top five performances, Klaus Kinski injects an incredible amount of depth into the Dracula character.  He's of course menacing, but he's also sympathetic, pathetic, wise, weary, and at times even clownish.  He approaches the role with the gloomy boredom and longing of a creature that has endured too many centuries alone in his crumbling castle.

In contrast to say the more charismatic Draculas we've seen over the past century, Nosferatu is quiet and meek in nature as he uses the minimal ghoul make up to not only provoke creepy unease but also vague sympathy. When he first meets Lucy, his slight shy mannerisms give the impression that he's shameful of his hideous appearance.  In contrast, there is the terrifying scene when Jonathan cuts his finger; resulting in the lurching Dracula transforming into a speedy, towering, blood thirsty predator(all thanks to Kinski's seemingly unnatural movements.)  As said, he also uses his appearance for tasteful comedy as well, especially during the playful scene where he's tip toeing around like a cartoon character as he plants his caskets around the town under the cover of darkness.

This isn't just the Kinski show however as Herzorg's incredible eye does more than hold up his end of the deal.  The natural locations of  the ruined castle, the mountains, the beach....etc. are all effectively haunting and he makes certain to linger on them just long enough for the viewer to burn them into their memory.  The shots of dusk skyline are both beautifully grand and imposingly claustrophobic.  Despite this being a rare venture into horror, Herzorg certainly understands how to create overwhelming apocalyptic doom and dread with startling images of gathering rats, gradually deserting streets, and increasing mass funerals.  It's a very visual film with more moody atmospheric droning than dialogue and other more straightforward means of storytelling.  It's very dream like, though it's one very strange and creepy dream to be sure. As the protagonist Lucy, Isabelle Adjani's gothic beauty serves the film well but she's also excellent at portraying the innocence and strength of the tragic character.  Bruno Ganz's Jonathan plays the role mostly for camp which is perhaps one of the film's few missteps.",1161648000,12,2557,5.159806295399516

1000201,4,6305263299,"I don't think I've ever seen this many rats in a movie before.  Werner Herzog's NOSFERATU, his remake of F.W. Murnau's 1922 classic Dracula story, is lousy with rats.  Nice and relatively placid white rats, for the most part - someplace somewhere says Herzog was unable to get his hands on buckets of brown rats, the creepy, feral kind, and so he trucked in white lab rats and dipped them (sometimes) in brown dye.  The rats are, I suppose, one arm of Dracula's army, the biological warfare arm that spreads disease and gnaws away from within at man and his creations.  Whatever, placid or not, seeing hundreds of rat milling around is unsettling.  Not quite as unsettling, though, as Klaus Kinski's Count Dracula.  There seems to be two great cinematic streams flowing from Bram Stoker's novel.  One has a sophisticated, sexy and urbane count whose headwaters is Bela Lugosi.  The other has a feral and unearthly count, the kind that originated with Max Schreck in Murnau's film.  With his pointy teeth, bald pate and misshapen ears Kinski's Dracula is very much in the latter camp.  In fact, in structure and even in some shots Herzog's film is very similar to Murnau's.  Kinski's Dracula is by turns predatory and pathetic, always creepy and thoroughly convincing.

 Herzog's NOSFERATU is an international production and one version was filmed in English.  A good thing if you don't like messing with sub-titles, although the accents tend to get thick at times and subtitles in any language aren't included.  Bruno Ganz (German) and Isabell Adjani (French) play that most unfortunate of all upwardly mobile young couples, Jonathan and Lucy Harker.  The eager and naively ambitious Jonathan travels to Transylvania to sell the count a house across the street from his in Wismar.  Lucy is the stay at home bride whose psychic and spiritual connection with her husband is so strong that even miles apart she wakes with a frightened start when Drac goes a-dining at Caf de Jon's Jugular.

 Herzog's NOSFERATU is weird and moody, atmospheric and familiar, visually stunning at times, as deliberately paced as a snail crawling over a sand dune.  If you have the patience to track a slow-moving horror movie you could do a lot worse.",1151366400,3,2229,4.909090909090909

1000206,4,6305263299,"Werner Herzog's re-make of Nosferatu the Vampyre is a ""very"" stylish take on the Count Dracula legend that has all the earmarks of its director. Not having seen F.W. Murnau's original, I have to believe Herzog was making an homage to those pre-war German artists and filmmakers who brought forth the style that more or less defines what we've come to know as early 20th Century German Expressionism -- Klimt, Beckmann, Nolde, Kokoschka, Murnau, et al. -- and what the Nazis ultimately deemed to be ""degenerate art"". Linear storytelling is often eschewed in favor of pure expressionist filmmaking. Shots and sequences are not framed and lit for visual agreeableness but for pure emotional impact. Script and speech acting are minimized and understated for the sake of visual emotiveness, much as the great films of the silent era. In these regards, Herzog has made a successful film which those who admire his unique aesthetic will certainly enjoy. Herzog's use of symbolic motifs, especially those of teeming critters in the midst of Dutch seaside society, will delight his fans and gloriously confound Herzog newbies!

The film itself is more eerie as opposed to scary. From its opening handheld sequence of corpses frozen in their terror and torment, to the severe forebodings of the gypsies, the ominous depiction of Black Death, and the hideous visage of the Vampyre himself (Klaus Kinski at his tastefully tortured best!); a marvelous spinetingling gloom pervades the proceedings that stops just short of outright camp...then takes a few memorable left turns!

The castle, the Transylvanian landscape, and the town of Wismar are wonderfully depicted. Isabelle Adjani is most adequate as Lucy; the wan, terror-stricken, shrinking violet of a wife who's also the Count's ""special interest"". Bruno Ganz as her devoted husband Jonathon, a real estate agent driven by the promise of a fat commission to travel four weeks across Europe to meet with his ghoulish prospective client, is obviously having fun in a somewhat stilted performance that sometimes crosses that wispy thread-like line into camp. Others play their roles to the hilt under Herzog's singular direction.

It is made by a man with real vision, craft, and maturity. Sadly, though, through countless remakes and spoofs, the Dracula story has become like a joke in our culture. Most people do not see the story as a tragedy. Dracula is seen as a kind of lady's man, rather than a cursed and lonely individual seeking love and affection.

In the last week I watched all the greats again, Murneau's Nosferatu and then Herzog's version. Today I watched Browning's and Coppola's Dracula and I watched Morrisey's last week (yuk!). I must say the German versions are far scarier and more realistic. Max Von Shrek is truly repulsive while Lugosi seems stiff and almost comical at times. Klaus Kinski nails the role while Oldman (maybe it was Coppola's fault) is more like ""Count Liberace"". As far as supporting roles go, if you look at the actors playing Lucy, Renfield and Harker there is no comparison, Murneau and Herzog have stronger casting. I probably shouldn't have watched the films in this order because I used to love the original Dracula and I dig Tod Browning and ""Freaks"" and all (check out Herzog's ode to Browning entitled ""Even Dwarfs Started Small"") but from the script to lighting to props (i.e., the bats in Browning's Dracula suck and Coppola's are overblown), the ""Nosferatu's"" are superior. I'm gonna have to see every flick about ""Drac"" ever made in the next few months (can't wait for the 70's trash pics) to give a fair comparison but for now, this is my two cents.

To put it plainly: If Dracula were a real person walking amongst us, KLAUS would be him. Werener's directing is wonderful, as expected. This movie is not dialogue heavy but instead Werner focuses his camera on scenery. Long stills on moody mountain plains; Shots of the ship sailing across the Black Sea; Stills of the dreary tower in the town; all conveying a gloom and a surreal evil feel throughout the entire movie.

1000245,4,6305263299,"""Nosferatu the Vampyre"" is director Werner Herzog's tribute to F. W. Murnau, whom he considers to be Germany's greatest filmmaker, as well as a haunting gothic horror tale in its own right. It is a remake of Murnau's 1922 film ""Nosferatu"", which is the earliest surviving cinematic adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel ""Dracula"". Herzog has combined ideas from Murnau's film, Bram Stoker's novel, and his own imagination in creating a film that is, if anything, even more expressionistic and romanticist than the 1922 masterpiece. It is also more languid and pathetic than other ""Dracula"" adaptations.

This version of the Dracula tale, like 1922's ""Nosferatu"", takes place in Germany and Transylvania. Jonathan Harker (Bruno Ganz) is a real estate agent employed by a madman named Renfield (Roland Topor) to deliver a contract to Count Dracula in Transylvania, who wishes to purchase property in Wismar, Germany. When he reaches his destination, Jonathan finds a hideous, predatory Count Dracula (Klaus Kinski) eager to sign the deed to his new home. Several days later, ill and traumatized by horrors that he experienced at Dracula's castle, Jonathan understands that his young wife Lucy (Isabelle Adjani) will be in grave danger if Dracula reaches Wismar and sets out to save her. Count Dracula's arrival in Wismar coincides with the Plague. The city is overrun with rats and its population decimated by disease. Only Lucy comprehends the nature of the evil that has befallen the city and understands what she must do to stop it.

""Nosferatu the Vampyre"" adheres pretty closely to Murnau's storyline, rather than Stoker's, except for the ending. The characters and actions have been embellished, however, sometimes with inspiration from the ""Dracula"" novel. Herzog's film moves slowly but steadily and spends more time with the characters than any previous ""Dracula"" adaptation. Count Dracula closely resembles Murnau's vampire but is even more grotesque and the least aristocratic of any cinematic Dracula. He is rodent-like and closely associated with rats and the Plague. But he departs from other Dracula interpretations in lamenting his permanent un-dead existence without light or love for centuries, which makes him a slightly tragic character. Although Count Dracula is the force that drives the narrative, the first half of the film is about Jonathan, and the second half concentrates on Lucy. Lucy Harker takes much inspiration from the character of Mina Harker in the novel ""Dracula"". The film's Lucy is more mystical and less methodical than the book's Mina. But, like Mina, she is stronger and smarter than the characters who surround her, and she tries her best to save everyone in spite of their blindness. Isabelle Adjani's Lucy Harker is the strongest heroine of any ""Dracula"" film.

Like Murnau's 1922 film, ""Nosferatu the Vampyre"" is visually expressionistic and romanticist. More of the film takes place outdoors than in other adaptations. There are lots of wide open spaces which are brightly lit, lending the outdoor scenes an airy feel, while scenes indoors tend to be dark and oppressive. This is clearly taken from the Murnau film, with its seaside scenes and bright sunshine. But the color cinematography and superior technology creates a sense of space that Murnau's film doesn't have. Colored lighting is lifted directly from Murnau's film, however. 1922's ""Nosferatu"" was filmed in black-and-white and tinted several colors to communicate time and mood. ""Nosferatu the Vampyre""'s night scenes are bathed in blue light, and the inside of Dracula's castle is close to sepia, producing much the same effects as Murnau's toning.

English and German versions of ""Nosferatu the Vampyre"" were filmed concurrently. Werner Herzog shot the scenes with dialogue twice -once in German, once in English. The two versions differ by only seconds in length, but they are edited slightly differently. Whichever one you see, ""Nosferatu the Vampyre"" is one of the most interesting adaptations of Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"", even if it is an indirect adaptation. It is also the slowest paced and highly expressionistic, which somewhat narrow its appeal.",1102550400,57,4159,5.306525037936267
1000246,5,6305263299,"Herzog blows the breath of life into this tale - kind of a dedication to another great German director - Murnau. This is filmed with a gorgeous detatched feel - common to Herzog's best films. This one also boasts the talents of Bruno Ganz - who you may recognize as the star of 'Wings of Desire' and 'The American Friend'. Herzog gives the tale his own interpretation of the tale - wisely avoiding the remake approach - and throwing his own insight onto this almost tortured looking count dracula - played by Kinski - who is, as always, really into the role. This ranks as one of Herzog's best - and certainly one of the best of the genre of horror films!",1099008000,2,655,4.377049180327869

1000288,2,6305263299,"Hello? Doctor I have insomnia. Could you help me? Yes, watch Herzog's Nosferatu. I was cured and now I am able to get a good night's sleep. The pace of this film is tedious. The scenery is nice. So what? So is the scenery on National Geographic Explorer. One of my problems with Herzog is that he doesn't so much make films as much as he simply puts pretty pictures and scenes on film. This is not what cinema is all about. Herzog's Nosferatu fails the litmus test. Watch Psycho or Bride of Frankenstein or Halloween, then try to put this on. The inferiority of Nosferatu in comparison to those films is startling. If I want pretty pictures I'll go to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. I can't believe that people watch this and are entertained. Films are supposed to be gripping, enthralling, emotional. Horror films especially should be filled with suspense and a degree of the unknown. Nosferatu falls flat on all accounts.",1097020800,5,924,4.640243902439025
1000289,4,6305263299,"I will be honest.  When I first began this film, upon seeing the first ten minutes, I was frightened.  Not because there was anything to be frightened about, but because of the low-grade production value that was very clear.  The cheap sets, the cheesy actors with horrible English dubbing, coupled with a soundtrack that could easily raise the dead, I was ready to watch this film crash and burn.  Oddly, this only happened within the first ten minutes, once Harker gets to Dracula's castle, we are handed huge portions of the meat and potatoes of this film.  Nosferatu transforms right in front of your eyes from a cheesy horror flick to a mind-bending horror classic that deserves the cult following it has obtained.  This was one of those films that you should sit and enjoy throughout the entire film, and do not judge it on just the first few minutes.  Get into the story, and I think you will be impressed.

There were two parts that stuck out the most in my mind.  These were two scenes that proved to me that I was in fact witnessing cinema in its rawest form.  The first is when Dracula is running down the streets of Virna seemingly random, but imaginatively pure.  He is searching for the woman he dreams about, Lucy Harker.  He has the expression of a kid in a candy store for the very first time.  This is classic avant-garde filmmaking at its best.  You could tell that money was tight for this production, but somehow the masterful eye of director Werner Herzog kept it all together.  His scenes were, to say the least, brilliant.  There were some very starchy moments, but all together he kept a very vivacious spirit alive in this film.  Again, it just took about ten minutes to get into the full package of Nosferatu.

The second favorite scene of mine is the stoic Last Supper scene that confused me at first, but after finishing the film made much more sense.  The plague was infesting this little town, and the citizens knew they were going to die ... immorality was a desire of only one person, Dracula, so why not celebrate in the best way possible.  I know there are other ways to see this scene, but I just saw a hopeless class of people living life for the possible last time.  It was visionary and beautiful all at the same time.

While these scenes really helped create the aura of the film, it was purely the work of the actors that kept my mind focused on the screen.  My favorite of all the characters presented was Roland Topor's portrayal of Renfield.  His sinister, yet uncontrolled, laughter spooked me.  His face was goofy, and believable.  He embodied the sense of insanity and used it well for his character.  Second, was Kinski as Dracula.  Where did they find this guy?  I do not believe that vanity was anywhere included in his vision of Dracula.  He was scary, curious, and insatiable all at the same time.  His portrayal of Dracula beats Gary Oldman any day (I have not seen the 1922 version with Shrek ... so I stand to what I say ... for now).  Overall, everyone from Lucy Harker to a very unused Van Helsing was superb and really carried this film off the ground.

The only disappointing aspect of this film was the DVD.  Normally, I can look past horrible reproductions of film as they gradually make it to digital format, but this was uncalled for.  Here we have a beautiful film with some very good acting and direction, and all we have is a Chapters menu and Start Film.  I was sad to see this.  I wanted some more history on this film and to know more about these actors.  I was a first time viewer that desired more knowledge.  Secondly, the sound mixing was off.  Perhaps it was off the entire film, but the actors at times seemed to be saying one thing with their lips, and out came something completely different from their voices.  It was a very strange distraction that unfocused me from this film.

Overall, with the recent popularity of the Hollywood lack-luster Van Helsing, it was sheer enjoyment to go back to the classics and see where Van Helsing found his start.  This was a beautiful film that should be viewed by everyone, but waited until another version is released on DVD.  This just didn't make the grade for me.

Grade: **** out of *****",1096329600,3,4210,4.517880794701987
1000290,3,6305263299,"Although there are some great atmospheric shots in Nosferatu, as well as major creepiness any time the vampire himself comes onto the screen, there are long periods when the film just seems to stutter and die. This is not simply due to the generally slow pace of the film, although that does play a part sometimes. Rather, there are just too many minor annoyances that pile up. There is far too much ""moralizing"", especially towards the end of the film.  The trouble is that these moralizing speeches come across sounding like the characters who are speaking them are utterly uninterested in what they are saying; ex. when Mary says to Dracula ""salvation must come from within ourselves"", she says it so matter-of-factly that any effect that the statement might have had on the viewer completely dissappears. And on and on.
Perhaps these scenes sound better in the German version; I don't know.
Also, for such a serious movie it's quite hard to take some of the actors in it seriously; the madman who joins Dracula when he comes to London has a laugh that is so ridiculous by the end of the film that it's just not possible to not crack up laughing at his acting (probably not what Herzog had intended).  I was also quite dissappointed with Van Helsing's character in this movie, who during half of his time on the set rambles on about how Science (with a capital S) has DISPROVED everything supernatural (which, apart from being completely at odds with his character in the original book, is also a very stupid statement).
Scenes that were important in the original movie (such as the ship's journey to England) are given short shrift here.
Also, Herzog doesn't seem to mind introducing continuity problems for the sake of atmosphere.  For example, when Jonathan is in Dracula's castle there is a young Gypsy boy who stands in the daytime near the castle, alone, and plays (really badly) a strange melody on a fiddle. Why anyone would want to stand beneath Dracula's castle and play on a fiddle is not answered.
There ARE some redeeming factors to the film.  For example, the introduction to this film is marvellously creepy and unnerving, showing us statues of dead and decomposing bodies. I also really liked how Herzog handled the plague that came to London (although why one vampire would want to kill hundreds of people each night is beyond me...); there is one extended scene in particular where the camera takes a stroll through the sickened city, where those who pay attention to detail will be able to find all sort of gruesome and disturbing events that happen, perfectly choreographed.
Overall, though, this does not seem to me to be the classic that many here are making it out to be.  I've heard that the German version is superior, so perhaps I've judged the film too early.",1094256000,3,2789,4.7541322314049586

This film does not have as much action as the first but it's still fun to wach. Make-up for Dracula rocked. Worth every penny.",1088640000,,444,4.174418604651163
1000292,5,6305263299,"For our second outing between Kinski and Herzog we find that the director has chosen to remake, or rather retell, his favorite film of all time - `Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens' by F.W. Murnau (1922), while at the same time adapting more of the original Stoker novel into the remake, using the original name of Count Dracula (Kinski) instead of Orlok and injecting his own take on the story of Dracula (in German), which for all intensive purposes is a story about `tragedy' and Herzog has correctly identified this main theme that would help levitate this entry to one of the all time great art-house horror films with images of Kinski's vampire often filling many film magazine pages and posters. In fact, it is Herzog's most commercial and accessible film to date. It was this telling of the Dracula story that influenced Coppola to remake the Stoker novel entirely into a film. It was not the first time Coppola had been influenced by Herzog. Coppola learned from Kinski and Herzog in ""Aguirre: Wraith of God"" that guerilla film making while going up a jungle river would be just what he needed for his version of Conrad's ""Hearts of Darkness"" (Apocalypse Now).
The usual Kinski/Herzog display of frustration is more subtle in this film than all the others probably because the beautiful Isabelle Adjani keeps Kinski distracted long enough for him not get angry with Herzog's cruel daily shoots to `get it right' and deliberately making the actors and actresses angry for their performances. Here everyone just looks deathly sick and move extremely slowly. Even Adjani looks paler than Kinski at times. For some reason this has given Herzog a more controlled approach to this film with certainly less improvisation and `on the spot' acting than any of his other collaborations with Kinski. Here we see a mix of Herzog's favorite - Tarkovsky's slow shooting style while cutting in shots of water (Herzog uses a bat in slow motion) and some sort of strange cinematic art house presence that we would see in many of Andy Warhol's productions. Herzog also gets the lighting just right and the cinematography is sublime - watching Kinski materialize from the darkness is again some of the most memorable images in art house cinema ever. Herzog also brings coffins en masse for display. Black coffins play a major role in the design throughout the film. Later on during a plague thousands of rats covering a city become central to Herzog's eye for capturing horror (a formal dinner takes place among hundreds of rats because the diners have the plague and wish to make the best of it before they die) - again extremely visionary and talented. Adjani puts on an amazing performance while remaining stunning under all the white. In one classic scene where she is confronted by Kinski she looks and acts more scary than Kinski almost performing him off the screen. The ending is an erotic take on the original film with Kinski touching Adjani all over, but the acting is excellent. The final twist comes as a shocker and is a bit funny. The end scene is like something out of a great Western and looks spectacular. Also the strange atmosphere of holiness is found throughout this film more than in any other Herzog/Kinski collaboration. The use of Orchestral sounds makes it all the more eerie while at the same time retaining that spirited electric connection to the presentation of madness that Herzog and Kinski are so well noted for.
'Nosferatu the Vampyre' is probably one of the most original art house horror films ever made even though the subject matter has been beaten to death, however it still ranks up there as one of the best versions of Dracula you can see. The DVD transfer is good and crisp. The aspect ratio is 1.85:1 and there are a lot of extras including director's commentary. By the way you can get the Kinski/Herzog box set of 6 films for a few quid extra than this stand alone DVD. Go look for it.",1085443200,5,3925,4.773529411764706
1000293,4,6305263299,"Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht (1979)
Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht directed by Werner Herzog, is really a color remake of the 1922 film Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens directed by F.W. Murnau.  There are a couple of name changes: Count Orlok became Count Dracula; Jonathan's fiance Nina became Jonathan's wife Lucy.  The original film was silent and in black and white, where the 1979 version is in color and is in German with English subtitles.
However the plot is close to Bram Stoker's book on Count Dracula which has a very similar plot line and story.  F.W. Murnau bought the movie rights to the film; however these rights were owned by Bram's widow Florence and she refused to allow the use of the name and storyline.  Even though Murnau had changed the major names of the main characters (Count Dracula, Thomas and his wife Ellen) and location enough similarity remained that Florence took the case to court and in July of 1925 the German court ordered all the copies of the movie destroyed.  However a few copies did manage to survive.
While the film starts off slow it shows spectacular scenes of an ocean voyage, and waterfalls experienced during Jonathan (Bruno Ganz) Harker's journey to Count (Klaus Kinski) Dracula's castle. The contrast with his return trip is startling, since he was healthy when he started, but on the return is very sickly and barely alive.  The Count's journey is very stark, his companions' death and rats board another ship, which glides into port with no one left alive on board except the rats.  As the rats depart the ship one reminded of the story of Ben, where the rats were everywhere and out of control.
An interesting dilemma in this film is the direct confrontation of belief in the existence of the supernatural and sacramental with belief in the rationale of science.  Science was believed to able to explain away rationally anything that happened out of the ordinary.  Yet here it could not produce an answer for Lucy (Isabelle Adjani) Harker.  The way that this was shown was that after consulting with the town physician, Lucy broke and crumbed the Eucharist around Jonathan to keep him locked into a chair in a corner all night, while she became the sacrificed lamb to save him from the Count and death.  While she did this out of her love for Jonathan, her sacrifice resulted in the final demise of Count Dracula and her own death.  Yet Jonathan in essence lives on to carry the legacy of the living dead, alive yet not fully.  The last that is seen of Jonathan is when he is released from his imposed prison, by the removal of the broken host around him, he declares that he has much work to accomplish he mounts a horse and rides off.",1083196800,,2693,4.692144373673036
1000294,4,6305263299,"The first thing I need to point out before I write one word about this film is apparently there are two versions of this film. One in German another in English. I have seen the English version. There seems to be a difference in the pacing of both films. So for those who have seen the German film, don't get mad at me if I say this movie is not paced poorly.
 I have only seen a few movies by Werner Herzog they include ""Aguirre: The Wrath of God"", ""Fitzcarraldo"", and ""Invincible"". I personlly do not watch much German cinema and do not include Herzog among my favorite filmmakers. In fact of the little I've seen from Rainer Werner Fassbinder, I prefer him. But ""Nosferatu"" is a wonderful film and perhaps the one movie that impressed me most from Herzog.
 I have not seen the 1922 version of ""Nosferatu"", although if it's any constellation I have seen ""Shadow of the Vampire"".
 ""Nosferatu"" has such a vivid colorful and yet stark look to it. Herzog has created so many memorable images here. I've always thought of Greek filmmaker Theo Angelopolous as the master of imagery but here Herzog seems to be a close runner-up. There's a scene dealing with rats on a ship and instantly I started thinking of ""Aguirre"" and the final scene with the monkeys. Herzog and his cinematographer Jorg Schmidt-Reitwein have truly captured something special. In fact it's the camerawork that leads me to have such strong admiration for the movie.
 ""Nosferatu"" for those who have seen the countless (no pun intended) versions of Dracula films this one, and perhaps the 1922 version is the same, is quite a different take on the story. For instance Van Helsing does not think Dracula is ""undead"". he makes no effort to stop him. Renfeld is not sent to the count's castle and turned into his slave, instead Harker is. Harker works for Renfeld. And speaking of Renfeld, did anyone else think Roland Topor was doing a Peter Lorre imitation? And as one reviewer pointed out this is Lucy's story, which is quite true.
 This is not to say these things hurt the movie, just anyone who is a die-hard fan will notice these differences and who knows how someone would react.
 If your starting to became familiar with Herzog films, like I am, I don't think this is really the place to start. I'm not convinced this is one of his ""typical"" films. When I think of Herzog the first movie that comes to mind is ""Aguirre"", but, if your a Dracula fan or if you've seen the original you'll probably want to see this. Also it would be fun to compare the two.
 Bottom-line: Impressive take on the ""Dracula"" story with slight differences. Herzog and cinematographer create many memorable moments. And Klaus Kinski is quite good in the lead as is Isabelle Adjani (hello nurse!) as Lucy.",1074211200,,2747,4.616803278688525

The story is of course Jonathan Harker's trek to Castle Dracula, in the land beyond the forrest there he meets his host, the centuries old Count Dracula. This ranks high above any Dracula movie ever. The film is dream-like with Great music throught out. Watch for Renfield, a stand-out! The most beutiful and greatest Dracula ever!",1068249600,3,621,4.813084112149533
1000296,2,6305263299,"This 1979 German sound remake of the 1922 Murnau silent classic (The making of which was later to be the basis for the ficticious film SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE) is again closely based on Bram Stoker's novel DRACULA.
Klaus Kinski plays the Count as a victim doomed by circumstance to be one of the undead. A lonely, brooding soul craving love. After a meeting with businessman Jonathan Harker, the Count soon sets upon his fiancee Lucy (the stunning Isabelle Adjani) to be his next conquest/unsuspecting prey.
Written, Produced and Directed by Werner Herzog; the film begins promisingly with its hypnotic & chilling opening credits; but despite eeriely effective photography by Jorg Schmidt-Reitwein this version is slow, arty, pretentious and just not scary.
The movie's highlight is the sequence featuring the pack of rats. Apparently there's some deep meaning to it- probably tied in to the sickness and decay brought on by the plague. But I'm not in a deep and meaningful frame of mind at the moment. When a movie is this self-absorbed, is it truly deserving of that kind of analysis?
This version is poorly dubbed in English and is 10 minutes shorter than the German print. The ending does come as a surprise however.
The classical score is also worth noting, as Herzog appears to be using it as a means to pay homage to the Max Schreck version: Murnau's superior feature was sub-titled A SYMPHONY OF TERROR.
But in the long run you're probably better off watching the original version or Coppola's BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA instead. Kinski is good in the role (his interpretation of Count Dracula is closer to Jack Palance's than Lugosi or Lee), but even this slightly truncated version will test the patience of horror fans who prefer lashings of blood & bulging bodices in their vampire flicks.
NOSFERATU is more arthouse fare than a traditional horror flick, so it's probably more geared towards audiences of that persuasion. If that doesn't sound like your cup of tea (or chalice of blood) you may want to check out one of the old Hammer movies starring Christopher Lee instead. I also recommended George A. Romero's MARTIN (1978) & Kathryn Bigelow's NEAR DARK(1987).",1059868800,4,2169,4.9289617486338795
1000347,5,6305263299,"Several great film makers and actors have had a go at the Dracula story since FW Murnau's stunning&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nosferatu-Eine-Symphonie-des-Grauens/dp/B000055ZB8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nosferatu: Eine Symphonie des Grauens</a>&nbsp;in 1924, and each extrapolates something very different, but still bewitching, from the same raw material: And so it is that Werner Herzog's ""Nosferatu - the Vampyre"" - ostensibly a remake of Nosferatu itself - does nothing more than borrow the odd visual motif from Murnau.

Nosferatu the Vampyre is decidedly an expressionist film so, if your interest lies in the bloodlust and suspense of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dracula/dp/0743477367/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dracula</a>&nbsp;story, then look elsewhere: The only flowing blood you'll see - honestly - is when Jonathan Harker cuts his thumb. Instead, Herzog builds a haunting atmosphere through some quite startling cinematography. The credits roll over hundreds of desiccated cadavers arranged in a crypt; on his way to Castle Dracula Jonathan Harker struggles into the Carpathian Mountains against all nature can throw at him: verdant Romanian valleys give way to cathedralesque caverns, furious waterfalls, and still, through seemingly impassable mountain terrain, Harker battles on. But when we reach the castle, Kinski's morose portrayal of the Count, drawn on a psychic level to Lucy Harker, poses questions of a curiously more unsettling variety: Who is the victim in all this, and who is the predator? The lonely, pallid count, drawn like a wasp to the honey-pot or the seemingly pure-in-heart Lucy Harker, dressed head to toe in virginal white, but with tresses of black hair befitting a black widow? If you think I'm reading too much in to this, consider Lucy's makeup: it's virtually identical to Dracula's - sickly white skin and black, sunken eyes. And consider the outcome of the film (which I won't give away here).

In its final twenty minutes Nosferatu really makes its mark, and one scene in particular gave me the willies: In Delft's main square, the Black Plague has taken hold, and Lucy runs through stray farm animals, miscellaneous household furniture and contaminated townsfolk who are intoxicatedly celebrating their own last hurrah. What makes the scene so striking is that it is totally silent (and thus reflective of the original Nosferatu), and accompanied by an extraordinary piece of polyphonic choral music. The credits don't mention it, and after about three days trying to track it down I've finally found it: it is a traditional Georgian folksong entitled Tsintsqaro (""At the Spring"") which you may track down on the internet but not through Amazon.com. This confluence of music and images is perhaps one of the most haunting scenes Herzog has captured on film (which, given his gift for such scenes, is saying something).

The DVD presentation is great - I don't think the English version of the film is significantly inferior to the German one (Adjani, who's French, was dubbed in both languages anyway) and in a couple of places had a nicer touch - Kinski's groan of irritation at laying eyes on a crucifix is funnier in the English version, for example. The commentary from Herzog is also well worth listening to. In other words, I have watched the same film three times in the last five days, and I'm still singing its praises!

This film is all that the 1922 silent version was, and more. It begins showing Dr. Renfield giving Jonathan the order to travel to the ""haunted"" land beyond the Forrest, Translvania, to give Count Dracula the papers for his new home. Lucy, Jonathan's wife begs him not to go, but he does not listen. Upon arriving to Dracula's castle, Dracula sees Lucy's picture and immediately signs the papers, and travels by ship to her town. Jonathan quickly rides back, but slowly gets sicker and sicker, until he cannot even remember how he met Lucy. Dracula's arrival brings the plague, and Lucy must make the ultimate sacrifice to destroy this hideous monster deprived of love.
The film is beautifully shot, and acted, with Werner Herzog behind the camera capturing, Klaus Kinkski's terrifying portrayal of the evil Dracula killing his victims. So many memorable scenes of darkness and horror are scattered throughout this film, with the silent beauty of nature watching on the side. The music in this film adds to the atmosphere of the good side of Jonthan/Lucy, and to the evil side of Dracula.  The original 1922 version of this film, was perfect in its display of gothic horror, and this film has all that the original offered, but adds more philosophy and insight, and a tragic ending that makes this version superior.

1000351,5,6305263299,"Nosferatu was originally a German expressionist film, much in the style of ""The Cabinet of Dr. Calgari. Moody, extremley gothic, and very scary, shot in Germany in 1922. Max Schreck played the part of Nosferatu, aka Count Orlok, the ugliest, scariest Dracula in cinematic history. Orlak is tall and skinny, shriveled, actually, with elongated limbs, and long, sharp claws for hands. He is ancient as well. We have no leading man type here, a la Christopher Lee, who was actually a sex symbol back in the late sixties, or handsome Bela, Frank Langella, or more recently, Gary Oldman. Orlak is the combination of an evil old man, mixed with a rodent. His ears are batlike, his eyes, wide and scary, a beak nose, and his full lips hide long, ratlike fangs. He is bald as well. Klaus Kinski captured Nosferatu to a tee, although Klaus is well, flat out not as ugly as Schrek. the story is virtually Dracula retold, including Harker's trip to Transylvania, the Count buying Real Estate, the Count lusting after Lucy, and Lucy's sacrifice. There is a hidden eroticism in the final scene with Lucy that must be seen to be believed. Lucy, by the way, is portrayed by the ever sexy Isabelle Adjani, and she portays a perfect damsel in distress, who knows what she must do. The contrast in Lucy's beauty, compared to Orlak's hideous repulsiveness, only adds to the erotic chemistry that is on the screen during their scenes together, especially when Lucy is first confronted by the lustful old vampire, and he demands her love. During the famous, final scene, we see Orlak consumate his vampiric love, in full detail. Lucy almost seems to be enjoying it. Orlak must have Lucy, even if it means that his very existance is the price to be paid, so he enjoys his night of bloodlust, and lovemaking to the fullest. The movie is atmospheric, and well acted throughout, although the Van Helsing character seems a bit powerless. Then again, aside from Lucy's sacrificial beauty, what can stop the evil Count Orlak.....Highly recommended.",1035158400,,2020,4.824207492795389
1000352,4,6305263299,"Werner Herzog's remake of FW Murnau's ""Nosferatu"" is a masterpiece in its own right. It's eery, shocking, suspensful, and it contains a truly great performance by Klaus Kinski as the tortured vampire.
This special edition DVD is Anchor Bay's second release of ""Nosferatu the Vampyre"" (it had an earlier release as a flipper.) This time, it's a two disc set, and it has new menu designs...and that's about it.
The DVD looks good enough, but it looks nearly identical to the first release. The earthy colours look best in daytime. When night comes, there's some heavy grain.
The extras are a marvelous audio commentary by Werner Herzog, a mediocre ""Making Of"" documentary, some eery trailers, biographies, and a little booklet with some poster art.

Kinski plays the Bram Stoker Dracula character mostly by movement, shadow, light and gesture and he is brilliant.  He is otherworldy throughout and brings many layers to the vampire character, including melancholy blended with evil and feralness.  It is set in a town of canals with terrified townsfolk who believe the plague is upon them instead of a vampire.  But Lucy Harker, played by Isabelle Adjani, knows better and she sets out to vanquish the vampire.

Her husband Jonathan, played by the wonderful Bruno Ganz, is foolish and under the vampire's thrall so she deals with him as well.  This is no Lucy that needs rescuing by all the males in the film. She's ready to take on everyone and indeed she does.  Adjani is deathly pale throughout but has never been more breathtakingly beautiful either.  The details of the period and place have been stunningly recreated throughout.  You are there for all intents and purposes.  You can also buy this as part of the newly released Herzog-Kinski boxed set.

1000355,5,6305263299,"This production is my ABSOLUTE favorite film rendition of the Dracula story.. Who can portray Dracula better than Klaus Kinski?
In certain scenes you can see Werner Herzog obviously mirroring Murnau's direction from the silent film ""Nosferatu"" Like Lucy's vigil at the seashore, waiting for Jonathan's return, remind me so much of the Murnau film.
And although it contains aspects of the Murnau film, this IS NOT a DIRECT remake. If you have ever seen the silent film with Max Schreck in the title role, you'll see this is different. With a different ending...
Klaus Kinski is MESMERIZING and absolutely delectible! With shaven head, ghostly pale skin, long white fingers & defined even more against his long black suit. And his usual great self-direction. In most scenes he moves almost insect like.
He so keenly delivers such a fantastic performance, that's forever etched in my mind. Creating a disturbing and creepy aura, yet also very poignant and moving...
""As for me, the absence of love, is the most abject pain""..he mournfully says.
Lucy and the Count's interaction together, their expressions to each other, it's so profound (oddly & intensely romantic). It really affects me.
Bruno Ganz is also great as Jonathan, the hapless real estate agent, sent to Dracula's lonely castle in the desolate outreaches. His stay with the Count, the way they react to each other. Are sometimes humorous. The way he watches Jonathan eat... He asks him ""Listen, The children of the night make their music."" Jonathan gives a mystified look.. The Count looks at him sadly ""Ah, young man... You're like the villagers, who cannot place themselves in the soul of the hunter.""
The Count expresses his loneliness throughout..""Can you imagine enduring centuries, experiencing the same futility each day?""...
Some may find it slow in parts, particularly Johnathan and The Counts race to Wismar.
Jonathan's journey is hampered by his urgent escape from the Count's castle, in which he falls from the window. He is taken in by an old couple. And by the time he gets home, he doesn't even recognize Lucy. And he's absolutely forgotten the reason he came home. The doctor attributes it to ""brain fever"".
He's been bitten, and Lucy sorrowfully watches him slowly deteriorate.
Isabelle Adjani is wonderful as Lucy, she seems genuinely affected and her tear-stained eyes are real. She has the power to move you. Lucy knows that it's completely up to her, to save Jonathan And also free Wismar from the mysterious ""plague"" that has gripped the city.
Also worthy of note is Roland Topor who plays Renfield. Jonathan's employer who is in league with the Count, he calls him ""master"". And when Jonathan leaves, Renfield is comitted to a jail cell. He gets more and more excited as he senses the Count's getting closer. He's obnoxious, but thankfully NOT in a way that grates on the nerves or annoys. :-)
It's exceptional..a masterpiece= 5+ stars :-)
It's visually beautiful and wonderfully well acted. With an exquisite artistic style that permeates throughout.
I prefer the German language version as a opposed to the ""dubbed"" one, which really isn't dubbed. You can tell the actors are actually speaking English, by reading their lips and the scenes are just slightly different, in the dubbed one.
 It may be too ""artsy"" for SOME.

The end result is effective and much more enjoyable for the average modern viewer. Like the original silent film, the vampire is portrayed as a hideous and sad creature. As in all ""Dracula"" based films, the humans must outwit the vampire in order to save the people they love. The film is very well done and would appeal to fans of the more ""classic"" horror movie style. With all the high budget slick presentation vampire movies available now this one may fall short for some viewers and may seem a little dated.

If you fall into both camps, I think you will enjoy this film. It is reasonably true to the Bram Stoker yarn, but contains an extra additive with the extraordinary cinamatography, brillient and haunting soundtrack, and splendid cast.

Side two consists of the English langauge edition (which was actually filmed separately in parts), and has a nicer picture quality of the two sides.
I don't see the emphasis on the ""pure"" German soundtrack as Isabelle Adjani and the little comic who plays Renfield are both French actors and their voices are overdubbed. Herzog himself also confesses that much of the film was filmed by English speech as it is a more ""international language"" than is German. Besides, the film just seems to ""work"" better in English in my opinion (as does Aguierre for other reasons).
The image quality is good, but not ultimately great - it's a bit grainy in places. The screen is presented in a shallow 1.85:1 widescreen format and includes a behind the scenes featurette and several trailers. The sound quality is fine, no complaints.

The every scene in the movie was shot twice, first in German, and then in English.  Those are the actual voices of Kinski and Adjani, et al.  However, when the two versions were tested on audiences, English speakers found the English version a little too odd.  So this is actually, in a sense, another movie.  I agree with many other reviewers appreciation of the beauty and creepiness of the movie.  It took me a couple of viewings to adjust to the oddities of the English version, but I still like it.  The German version is a little better.",1015459200,5,638,4.448275862068965
1000399,5,6305263299,"Werner Herzog's vision of the classic Nosferatu is without equal in its beauty AND horror. Of all the vampire films produced since the 60s, other than Francis Ford Coppola's ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", no other director has realized so rich a portrayal of such a horrific creature.
The opening sequence, set in a charnel house or a cave, is a rolling long shot of thousands upon thousands of human skulls piled floor to ceiling, with an extraordinarily creepy and haunting choral music background. One of the most disturbing openings of any horror film I've seen ever. The first time you see it, it leaves an indelible impression on your psyche, setting the stage for what will follow.
Klaus Kinski's almost literal ""inhabitation"" of Nosferatu is enhanced by the superbly realistic makeup and prosthetics he wears to effect the look of a gargoyle-turned-vampire. With piercing black eyes like those of a rodent, his is the most intense screen portrayal of any vampire character. Not only he is physically intense (with an almost humbling mien), but he is also a very ""human"" Nosferatu, in that his sense of aloneness in the world, and his despair is so palpable as to render the darkness around him so much the bleaker.
The cinematography draws the landscapes around his castle and the interiors in the brightest of whites and the most sombre of blacks.
If you have a choice between the original-language German w/the English subtitles, or the dubbed version, do yourself a tremendous favor and view it in the original. The dubbed English so dilutes the mood of the film, while German fits the story's mood and dialogue so well.
This Nosferatu is much more than just a horror film, it also brings poetry and romance to the vampire genre.

1000400,5,6305263299,"Wonderfully filmed and deeply sinister (yet not gory).
The classic Bram Stoker novel of 'Dracula' gets the German treatment in this 1979 classic. A worthy remake of the 1922 Murnau masterpiece. Klaus Kinski (who looks like a bald Gary Numan) plays the nefarious Count, a world-weary vampyre with a longing to love and be loved . Isabelle Adjani is the self-sacrificing heroine, a beautiful doll-like creature she is too!
There is a scene in this where a horse and carriage is riding along by a river, yet the wheels are not turning. This is perhaps the films only flaw, but its not something that spoils the film. Yes, some say the pacing is slow, but just relax and take in the atmosphere of this deeply tragic, yet beautiful tale. This is absolutely one of the best vampyre films ever made.

However, Werner Herzog's 1979 film, ""Nosferatu"", is, in my opinion, the best vampire film ever made, next to the 1922 original ""Nosferatu"".
Herzog's ""Nosferatu"" evokes strong images, feelings, and moods in a subtle, but stirring way. There's no glitz, no glamour, or romanticism. The film is eerie, ugly, beautiful, strongly visual, at times scary, and always completely compelling. ""Noseferatu"" is a film that displays film artistry, but not film ""artsiness"". Well acted, well scored, well directed, and great cinematography, ""Nosferatu"" captures the true spirit of the myth known as the Vampyre",1007337600,,824,5.7073170731707314
1000402,5,6305263299,"I love the films of Werner Herzog made with the participacion of Klaus Kinski as main actor and with Popol Vuh's music -it wouldn't be the same to me without these great musicians-. Fortunately there were other films I have seen they made together like ""Aguirre"" and ""Fitzcarraldo"". There are other examples of these succesful combinations as Blake Edwards&Peter Sellers&Henry Mancini's films.

What is my opinion on Nosferatu, the vampire?...well, the first time I saw it -many years ago- I felt bored like some of the persons who gave their opinion. I think mostly when someone grows up can be able to enter in a kind of film like this. But, however it is needed a mentality that would consist in understand the nature of Werner Herzog's films. He always try to show the close connection between man and the earth, and he get it thanks to brilliant actors, quite long sequences with few dialogues and wonderful fusions into beautiful landscapes and sighs to contemplate dreamily, and...the most important!...accompanied by Popol Vuh's music.

I specially enjoy the scene when Bruno&Isabelle walk in the beach embracing each other under a light mist and a strong wind blowing. I must say that I truly enjoy everything on the film, wich it is always a pleasure to me to watch and submerge quietly on its calmness, spirituality and beauty.

A steady pull of tension that seems almost hypnotic and a pleasant little surprise at the ending make this my all-time favorite Vampire film.  I must confess that they have been a secret vice for many years and I've probably seen all but the sexploitation ones and have loved many.

1000404,5,6305263299,"In the past there have been endless versions of Bram Stoker's story but i have to say that while this is not the most accurate adaptation (the inferior COUNT DRACULA is the most accurate one) this is the best and the scariest. The story starts with Johnathan Harker (Bruno Ganz) having to head for the Carpathian mountains in order to sell Count Dracula a piece of land property in his town. When he gets to the castle in the mountains he meets Count Dracula (Klaus Kinski) and after a few creepy moments in the movie he sells Dracula the property and while that happens he sees a photo of Harker's fiancee Lucy (Isabelle Adjani and by the way they switched Mina's name to Lucy and vice versa in case you are confused) and he soon sets off for Harker's town. I will not reveal more for those who have not seen it because it will take away much of the mystery in the movie. Let's start with the acting. The entire cast here is great, i can't praise them enough. Klaus Kinski gives one of his best performances as Dracula and he adds dimensions to the character that other actors could not provide. He is sympathetic and repulsive at the same time. Can't remember Lugosi or Lee making me feel that way. The beautiful Isabelle Adjani is hypnotic as Lucy, you cannot take your eyes off her. She makes Lucy a vulnerable yet strong person. So far the only other actress who has come close to Adjani's performance is Winona Ryder in Coppola's version. Bruno Ganz is very good as well and for the first part of the story he stands in for Adjani as the character that we put all our worries on. Herzog's direction is very creepy, atmospheric, and he takes his time telling the story which might irritate some who are used to the loud and fast Stallone and Willis movies. He pays great homage to F.W. Muranu's original version of NOSFERATU and to the German expressionism of the silent era. This movie has very little dialogue. Almost the entire story is told with visuals. But this proves to be more affecting than if there had been more dialogue. For a fun and entertaining version of DRACULA watch Lugosi's version. For a thoughtful, creepy, and well acted version of the story watch NOSFERATU THE VAMPYRE.",997574400,2,2199,4.527638190954774
1000405,4,6305263299,"When I purchased this film, I had my doubts.  I'm no fan of remakes, particularly after viewing  both the remake of and the 30th anniversary edition for NOTLD (1968). However, I was delighted with Hertzog's of Nosferatu.  He does remain true to the 1922 original while he also brings plot points a bit closer to Stoker's novel.  The film is simultaneously romantic and existential, and truely haunting.  The characterizations are fantastic, Nosferatu (who's meloncholy count struggles with the same qualms as the Bard's melocholy prince). The cinematography captures gothic noir imagery that I have never seen equaled.  And though it is a remake, I believe that this film is a classic in its own right.  As some have already mentioned, the pacing is slow.  The editing is more stylistically similar to that of Kubrick than to MTV.  This is not to say that it comes across as too long or boring, though some viewers may be fidgety at first.  It is very enjoyable.  Finally, I don't know if there is indeed an English dubbed version of the German rendition, but Hertzog filmed the movie once in German and once in English with the same cast.  From what reviewers have said here, I'd stay away from the dubbed edition.  But I highly endorse the edition that was filmed in English.",997488000,2,1277,4.776255707762557

The complete film, in German, is a beautiful and genuinely creepy adaptation of the DRACULA story with terrific performances by Klaus Kinski and Isabelle Adjani.
The acting has the vivid physicality of silent movie acting - the popping eyes and pointing chins, and Kinski's famous gestures - which is, somehow, exactly appropriate for Herzog's setting and pace.  Adjani's reactions to the vampire's visit in her bathroom are enormous and beautifully theatrical - and the chemistry between them is palpable even on a grainy videotape.  Kinski is no smooth-talking, cosmopolitan Dracula.  This vampire is perpetually cold, hungry, and his carcass aches, which only makes his desire for Mrs. Harker (Adjani) the more excruciating and erotic.

1000439,2,6305263299,NOSFERATU was good but there was something wrong. Horror movies are supposed to be Creepy and Strange to a certain extent. NOSFERATU takes the Creepy and Strange thing to the limit and that is sometimes wrong. Other thing I didn't like about this movie was it was too much of a love story than a Horror Movie. I recommend this movie to anyone to who likes Horror/Romance movies.,992304000,2,378,4.573529411764706
1000440,5,6305263299,"Nosferatu unfolds like a languorous, disturbing dream.  The images have an hallucinogenic, archetypal quality:  mummified human remains in an ancient tomb; the figure of a woman sitting on a beach studded with tombstones; a dead sea-captain lashed to the wheel of a deserted sailing ship.
Like Kubrick's The Shining, Nosferatu is less a standard genre film than a singular expression of a filmmaker's vision.  Writer-director Werner Herzog began with F.W. Murnau's expressionist classic, mixed in elements from Bram Stoker's novel Dracula, then set about creating a meditation on the vampire myth.  What would it really mean to live forever, and be compelled to feed on the blood of others?  What of the unspeakable boredom?  The longing for companionship?  For normalcy?  For death?  As played by Klaus Kinski, Herzog's Dracula has spent hundreds, if not thousands of years alone with these thoughts.  He is the ultimate poster boy for German angst.  If not for the skill of his performance and Herzog's direction, he might have lapsed into self-parody.
There are shots that all but reproduce moments from the silent classic - right down to the overwrought body language. But Herzog, Kinski, and the rest of the cast (including Bruno Ganz as Jonathon Harker and Isabelle Adjani as his wife Lucy) keep it in check and keep it beautifully stylized, so it all works.
Probably due to the involvement of American studio 20th-Century Fox, Nosferatu was shot in both English and German versions.  Both are on this double-sided DVD; comparing them is instructive, since there are non-trivial differences in the visual construction of both films.  Most critics agree (and I concur) that the German one is superior.
Finally, to get an idea of whether you will like this - or any - Werner Herzog film, take the Armageddon-Matrix test:  if you hated Armageddon because it was empty and overblown, but kind of liked The Matrix because of its ideas, then you may like Nosferatu.  If, on the other hand, you thought Armageddon rocked, but only kind of liked The Matrix because it was slow in places, then don't even think about it.",989107200,16,2117,5.008571428571429

Details and colours are extremely rich, the cinematography is astounding, the soundtrack is clear in dialogue and atmospheric in musical score. Herzog's vision is a complete masterpiece - serving as both an homage to Murnau's still-astonishing original and as a reinterpretation and reassessment of the Nosferatu myth. Kinski's performance as the Count is both terrifying and achingly sad. He gives us more insight into the barren, haunted soul of the vampyre than I have ever seen in a film of this type. Adjani, as Lucy, is a beautiful doomed heroine. Adjani is an actress who never gives less than the most powerful performance, she inhabits every character she plays, and her Lucy is a passionate, sensual woman, acutely vulnerable and intensely courageous, whose disturbing psychosexual bond with the Count serves as the undoing of both of them. She illuminates the screen. Finally, Ganz's Jonathan Harker is a revelation. For once, it is a pleasure to see a completely three dimensional interpretation of Harker's character when, in most other movies, he is relegated to little more than glorified extra status after his initial foray into Castle Dracula. 'Nosferatu The Vampyre' is a perfect example of a director and actors coming together at the top of their craft, and what they have created here is nothing less than spectacular.",986947200,2,1476,5.128630705394191
1000443,5,6305263299,"I loved Klaus Kinski even before I saw this movie when it was inititally released theatrically in 1979.  However, with this movie, he really blew me away.  He makes an utterly artistic, animalistic, poetic vampire.  He doesn't even say all that much in this film, conveying most of his role through pure visuals alone, body and facial movement.  This man could make high art of literally being on camera with his own shadow, which indeed you see in one scene. The rest of the casting is likewise inspired with the formidable and beautiful Isabelle Adjani in the Nina Harker role and Bruno Ganz in her husband Jonathan's role.  This is a German-Werner Herzog inspired version of the classic Bram Stoker tale.  That makes quite a difference to the story as a whole other culture is superimposed over an originally English novel.

The town it is set in is fascinating to add to the tale with its interconnecting canals.  To my utter astonishment, this version also has a feministic Nina Harker (not surprising, however, with Adjani playing her).  Nina takes charge of the situation and decides to protect her husband and the village itself by taking the vampire on alone and by seducing him no less.  Adjani is well up to the task of seducing even a vampire!  I've seen the movie several times since 1979 and always thoroughly enjoy it.  Until the Coppola version of ""Dracula"" was made, I was convinced this version was the best.  But why split hairs?  Both versions are excellent and stand well enough entirely on their own.

The characters are creepy and well played and Klaus Kinski is wonderful as Nosferatu (Dracula).  Can definetly be compared with Murnau's version.,980208000,,300,4.96
1000446,5,6305263299,"Werner Herzog, in making this film did not intend to produce his idea of how the original silent film should have been, but to glorify the beauty of it. The film is constructed with very little dialogue, almost only that of the speech cards in the original silent. This, with the colour footage and the heavenly sound track make for the most beautiful and aesthetic movie I have ever seen. Every image is an oil painting, and every piece of acting is a pre-Raphaelite dream.
Isabelle Adjani is fantastic in her role, as is Klaus Kinski, reprising Schreik's original.
Don't be deluded by the technical review on this site, the picture quality is incredible when compared to the original video release, which was made by videoing the film projected onto a canvas screen (which needless to say was dirty). The soundtrack is incredibly clear in comparison also. This film was worth me getting a DVD for.

1000447,5,6305263299,"First of all, let's get down on our knees and thank Anchor Bay for releasing this wonderful movie. Secondly, let me tell all of you that this movie introduced me to two people of whom I now feel passionately: Werner Herzog and Isabelle Adjani. Finally, on to my review. An enthusiast of vampire movies, I eagerly looked for this film at my local library after I read a review of it in the New York Times. My expectations were more than met. This film is beautiful. I love it. The cinematography, the music, the mood, and the production values are top-rate. The opening sequence is amazing. It more than implies that this is  a vampire film of rare ilk. Klaus Kinski is quite the man in this film. I wish I knew how he approached his role. Isabelle Adjani is gorgeous. Werner Herzog sounds everything off on the right note. I always enjoy watching this film. Explore the rest of Herzog's available work and you will not be disappointed. This tasteful film is a good one for the intellect, but the images and story go hand-in-glove, so don't expect a trashy, pretentious art film from Europe. Come with high expectations and you will not be disappointed.",977011200,,1152,4.592233009708738

Also, I've never seen a more interesting vampire in any movie. He is played so creepily and as such a pathetic character you think you'ld have sympathy for him- but not so, he's horrible. The look and the music in the movie create a perfect environment. This isn't a scary movie, but it is one of the best horror movies I've seen.",975196800,,498,4.423913043478261

I was surprised I enjoyed this the least of Herzog's films since I am certainly predisposed to like both the director and the genre.  However, unlike many remakes I do not think you have to be familiar with the original silent classic ""Nosferatu"" to enjoy this film, as Herzog's work stands on its own.  Ultimately it is worthwhile to sit through the film just to get to the conclusion, which is far and away the best part of the film.",973382400,2,536,4.393939393939394

But it is it's stillness and surreal quality which will keep you coming back to it. It mesmerises and haunts you. The music is Classical and strong.  Filmed in Holland, the location is gentle and quiet then as the movie moves to the Mountains (Carpathians) it takes on a dangerous quality. The film stays true to the 1922 version but is much deeper and symbolic in nature. This is now one of my favorite movies. Herzog outdid himself directing this one. It is slow paced and not for the gory or action lover. Very ARTY. Relax and enjoy.",970531200,,710,4.503875968992248
1000491,3,6305263299,"Ok, I usually love these kinds of movies. And I did like this one, but for other reasons than the story and movement of the movie.
The movie was VERRRRYYY SLLLLOOOOOWWWW moving and lengthy and it was hard to understand the words of the Vampire.
BUT...I WILL plug for it, that it had AWESOME gothic visuals. Moonlit forests and beautiful landscapes and castles and some gorgeous details of such things as the carraige that takes Lucy's man to the castle, the inside and the rooms of the castle itself,etc. Lucy also looked perfectly gothic for this movie.
The vampire reminded me of a sick person more than a vampire. Sorry! I know it was how the original version's vampire looked, I have yet to see it. I understand it is very good in spite of it's age and lack of technology.
I think this movie would be good to have on mute and use it as sort of a music video for alternative or appropriate hardrock music at parties. As I said there were some lush gothic scenes worth seeing but in the above mentioned way.",969753600,,1009,4.43010752688172

From the creepy musical score to the dying plague victims this movie is a must have for any horror fan or for that matter anyone who likes a great movie.  The movie stays fairly true to it's roots and rates right up there with its predecessor.  The movie is like a nightmare come true with a dreamy kind of horror to it.

I fell asleep one night while trying to watch this  movie (hey my cable was out)and would you belive miracle upon miracle this  movie was still on when i got up the next day. I have had root canals that  have taken less time, and at least I got a ballon when i left the doctors  office.
  Now don't get me wrong, I love horror films, but come  on, this is ridiculous. I was praying for some kind of action in this  movie, but lo and behold did i get any no. WINNIE The POOH's GREAT  ADVENTURE had more action in it than this movie did. During the month that  it actually took me to watch this film ( hey you try watching this movie in  one sitting)I don't think i've ever contempleted throwing my dvd player out  the window so many times.
  Granted, the movie does have a  beautiful visual appeal, but to be very honest I would much rather rent or  buy a Hammer Horror film (ie. Horror Of Dracula or Dracula Has Risen From  The Grave ) if that was all i was interested in. Lucily for me I don't have  to drive to a stake through a vampires heart, all I have to do get rid of  Nosferatu is click my dvd player off.",966816000,5,1287,4.031746031746032

First of all it is packed with those great DVD extras that film  fans love: director commentary, trailers, etc. The cover art and the film  itself make this a horror classic even in this updated form. The director,  Herzog, gives an illuminating commentary of the various set pieces and his  actions and most of all what is was like working with Kinski and the  others. GREAT dream-like atmosphere is plentiful. That slow-motion bat  wonderfully creepy....Kinski's AWESOME performance (almost insect-like,  keeping with the notion that the vampire is really an obscene animal more  than a man!) and that haunting, visually amazing ending all make this one  excellent edition to your DVD horror collection. This film deserves a much  higher place in the horror-film hierarchy even though it is a remake it is  the best kind: one that pays homage to the original and has an atmosphere  and individuality all its own.  note: This film also has one of the best  musical scores that I have ever heard. It perfectly matches the surreal and  hauntingly eerie mood of the picture.",966038400,3,1153,4.871134020618556
1000496,3,6305263299,"Technically speaking, the movie is terrific.  The film quality is crisp and wonderfully coloured and is devoid of the orangey overtones and bleeding reds so many films from the 1970s seem to suffer.  Unfortunately,  the sound has a definite hiss.
Story-wise, the movie isn't so great.  Although I'm not a fan of Hollywood's rushed plots, Nosferatu is too  slow-paced.  When Jonathan Harker is snooping through Dracula's castle,  tension builds, but nothing happens.  He doesn't even stub his toe, and his  eventual escape from the castle is anticlimactic to the extreme.  I can see  how the tradition of lack-lustre actors portraying Jonathan Harker started.  The Jonathan of this movie is no more exciting than Keanu Reeve's  portrayal in Bram Stoker's Dracula.
Aside from the gorgeous scenery,  there isn't a whole lot I found interesting about the film.  Although Lucy  (Isabel Adjani) is as delectably gorgeous and freaky-looking as always, and  Nosferatu (Klaus Kinski) is an amusingly ugly and impeccably manicured  freak, the movie is just plain boring.  The acting is distinctly wooden,  and line delivery lacks panache.
One of the more interesting motifs used  in the film is the ubiquitousness of white plague rats.  Everywhere Lucy  and the minor characters go, they must wade through thousands of the little  critters.  Generally speaking, they ignored their squeaking presence,  paying attention to them only when bitten.  Are these rats partially  invisible?  How come no one reacts to them?  I guess it is a mystery.  I  think the film would have had a much more surreal element if babies had  been used instead of rats.  Imagine Lucy walking through thousands of  crawling naked babies on her way to sprinkle crumbled-up Host wafers on  coffins filled with more naked babies.  The thought certainly added to my  interest of the film.  And if the babies had needle fangs like good ol'  Nossie, so much the better.",963360000,2,1928,5.093548387096774
1000546,5,6305263299,"Werner Herzog's Nosferatu the Vampyre is more than just a horror movie, it is an etheral, well-crafted horror movie.  This is the way all horror movies can and should be.  Klaus Kinski is magnificent as the poor,  tortured Dracula, and Herzog did a terrific job of provoking sympathy for  the vampyre (here, Herzog follows Bram Stoker's classic novel Dracula more  closely than the otherwise excellent 1922 Nosferatu did).  Isabelle Adjani  does a lot more with her role as Lucy than most critics give her credit for  (and she is certainly dazzling here).  And the entire movie draws you in  and scares you and even makes you cry for Dracula's tragic love for Lucy.  The ending is a real eye-opener in the tradition of the best horror movie  endings.  German horror rules!  The best 107 minutes you'll spend on  watching a horror movie guaranteed!  A must for horror/fantasy and/or  Dracula/vampire movie fans!",961718400,2,910,4.920529801324503
1000547,4,6305263299,"This is a very dark version of Dracula and visually stunning. Similar to the 1922 silent version, Klaus Kinski plays the count as a horrible, creepy, creature from hell, and the sound of his breathing is unnerving. It  also has an eerie score. Bruno Ganz and Isabelle Adjani play Jonathan  Harker and his wife with rather remote blandness, and the rest of the cast  is bizarre...the rats however, do a splendid job !  I find all the Dracula  movies fascinating, it's a tale that will never grow old...see this film  for the brilliant cinematography, but for a version acted with heart and  soul, see Coppola's ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"".",961632000,2,634,4.814814814814815
1000548,5,6305263299,"""Nosferatu"" is a wonderous example of what an innovative, imaginative filmmaker can do with a worn out formulaic idea. Werner Herzog injects his film with poetic imagery and a amazing restraint in telling the  tale told in the original 1922 version. Klaus Kinski is a pathetic,  pale-faced, recreation of the character made famous by Max Schreck. He is  eccentric, educated, and diabolically evil at the same time. The film moves  at a slow, ponderous pace, that draws one in with its' melodic and well  filmed sequentially staged scenes. The film is not for those expecting a  loud, obnoxious, ""Lost Boys"" or ""Interview With The  Vampire"" type storytelling. It is a strange type of art form that will  hopefully be eventually seen as the classic that it is. The DVD  presentation is excellent, both the original German Language version and  the lesser English language version are contained on the disk. There is  also interesting commentary by the director in which he points out many  similarities between the earlier version and his. The film is also  letterboxed, presenting the entire scope of beautiful and horrific images.

1000549,2,6305263299,"I am a big Dracula fan, but this Dracula is a waste of time. First of all, NOTHING seemed to happen, and it was rarely scary! Of the Draculas I've seen, this was drawn out the WORST. I am very familiar with the story of  Dracula, but it made little sense to me primarily because it had little  dialogue and some details were changed. Plus, The ending was confusing! Was  Jonathan Harker a vampire, and where does he go on his horse at the end,  and why? Maybe he was trying to escape Van Helsing, I don't know. What I DO  KNOW is that it is a confusing ending to a dreamy film! If I who am  familiar with Dracula was confused, anyone unfamiliar with the story would  be if they saw this film. A beginner would be more informed through 1931's  ""Dracula"" or 1957's ""The Horror of Dracula"". Also, I am  convinced that the person playing Dracula should not look so obviously  wicked. It gives the whole show away! Plus, they have to be in their 40s at  least. Kinski failed in both departments, but his acting is OK (but not so  good after all, since I've seen better). Bela Lugosi, Gary Oldman,  Christopher Lee are all suave and not too obviously wicked (at least to the  other characters), and are all the right age.
The sets are marvelous and  realistic (but ""Horror of Dracula"" is like that, too). It moves  at a slow, dreamy pace, but it doesn't build up any suspense! Bottom line:  both 1970s Draculas are worthless, watch the other Dracula films!",956793600,2,1450,4.390977443609023
1000550,4,6305263299,"During the seventies, german director Werner Herzog has given us three movies - AGUIRRE, THE WRATH OF GOD, KASPAR HAUSER and HEART OF GLASS - which stay as unique pearls in Movie History. This director is a visionary,  one of the rare authors who have been able to create a cinematic world out  of their dreams. Just watch and listen to the featurette (Thank you, Anchor  Bay): this guy is an authentic genius coming from the same family of the  Saints of the Middle Ages or the most famous composers.
NOSFERATU, shot  in 1978, tries to establish a link between the german directors of the  1918-1926 period, Fritz Lang or Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau for instance,  authors who reigned over international cinema at that time and the new  generation of german directors that appeared in the late sixties with such  remarkable individuals as Rainer-Werner Fassbinder, Wim Wenders or Werner  Herzog.
Werner Herzog is also the last of the XIXth german romantics with  his images haunted by nostalgy, with his heroes able to see what is  invisible to common people. You have to enter into NOSFERATU as if you're  about to dream. If not, you'll surely be bored after 5 minutes. But if you  find in yourself the courage to follow Werner Herzog, you will experiment  something you'll never forget.
Other Werner Herzog's movies will be  released in the DVD standard very soon, so be prepared to dream.

You could freeze each scene and just stare at the splendor. In additon, of  course, we have some great acting and a much better Dracula story that I  have not seen elsewhere. Whereas Coppola created a misunderstood (and  pathetic) Dracula, Herzog created a creature of evil longing for love. But  when his desire is rebutted, instead of crying he acts out in anger, taking  everything away from poor Lucy until she is left with no choice. A more  realistic version of Dracula, if you will. This is the way movies should  be. Also to note is a great DVD extra, a behnd the scenes making of the  film with Herzog himself, great stuff.",954633600,3,774,4.289655172413793

Lesser modern vampire movies (think ""Fright Night"", ""Lost Boys"", or even the flimsy Hammer flix) taking too many liberties with the Gothic theme and going for cheap shocks? Well, if this is how you feel, then ""Nosferatu"" might be the vampire movie for you ... a gorgeous dreamscape of sublime images (Caspar David Friedrich comes to mind more than once), set to a soundtrack of haunting beauty. Rather an understatement in its overall style, this atmospheric gem of a movie is very low key and yet utterly creepy. Herzog clearly does homage to Murnau's original, but it's more than a remake, it's an enhancement ... like being able to hear the music on an ancient shellack in HiFi after all.",950918400,4,835,4.846153846153846
1000553,5,6305263299,"Finally, Werner Herzog's 1979 remake of F.W. Murnau's silent classic is available on video and DVD in the U.S..  It is a beautiful film full of otherworldly imagery and poetic nuance.  Klaus Kinski is, at once, hideous  and pitiful as the vampire Count.  Isabella Adjani brings both a convincing  depth and strength to the role of Lucy, a performance that rivals that of  Kinski's.  Their clash of wills fuels this somber meditation on death,  decay, and despair and keeps the viewer riveted despite the languid pace.  This film functions like a nightmare which makes it that much scarier.  Those who like to have their horror spoon-fed to them would do well to  avoid this film at all costs.  For everyone else, Werner Herzog has crafted  an exceptional film that is as challenging as it is entertaining.",949017600,,805,4.830882352941177

However, I can recommend this movie for the following reasons: 1)  the scenery, beautiful and at times alien  to many of us in the U.S. 2)  Klaus' make-up (as good as the original) 3) the acting (a little broad at  times but, hey) 4) the music
Klaus Kinski is a good actor and always  plays interesting characters (and he helps make beautiful and talented  children). Trust me, there are worse ways to spend some time. A bad  rendition of ""The Messiah"" comes to mind. 8{",946252800,,741,4.42962962962963

I watch this  movie every night (almost) to fall asleep to, simply because the imagery  conjured is a hallucigen in itself.  My only gripe with the German  version is that the subitles are too small for my lowering eyelids to  negotiate. This movie is an opiate for your soul and the type of terror it  will evoke from your mind has not been seen since Weine's 'Cabinet of Dr.  Caligari' or Murnau's orginal 'Nosferatu'.

1000604,5,6305263299,"I first saw this in the summer of 1987 on Channel 4 here in England. I was 13 years old and the movie's dark lasciviousness left such a deep  impression upon me that I followed the tape for years like a bounty hunter.  I finally got the opportunity to buy both the English and the German  version from Amazon this year and awaited their arrival with extreme  anticipation. Herzog's reworking of the FW Murnau silent is like heroin for  the eyes. This film transcends definition in that it is a movie made of a  movie and not made for actors per se. You can tell this by the suppressed  use of dialogue (hence giving rise to the ease Herzog had in making 2  entirely different language versions using separate film sessions).  The  chills are entirely implicit. What does come out is the delicious  photography which Herzog fuses well with an ethereal soundtrack from Popol  Vuh, Wagner and some Messe opera at the end. Ganz is the perfect victim  because he is so soft-spoken and wide-eyed. Adjani is a luscious foil for  Kinski, whose erotic appeal comes out in tragic spurts near the end. We  through, accentuated by Herzog's anachronistic camera lens and the terror  mushrooms in the subconscious which gives rise to a longer term type of  disquiet.  The mummies in the intro. add intensity to the story. We're  taken from that crypt to the happy breakfast table of the Harkers in the  space of a minute, like a tooth being jerked back and forth before it is  wrenched out of the gum.  The best part of the film has to be the  journey to Castle Dracula. There is so much expectation loaded in there.  The imagery conjured by the Gypsy warnings at the campfire creates an  apprehension the size of a planet while the mountain lines and jagged caves  of Harker's final leg of the journey give rise to something even larger.  You can feel the warmth of civilization in the campfire flames. When you  juxtapose that with the howling wolves and the oppressive night both inside  and outside Castle Dracula, your sense of safety becomes highly polarised.  Herzog used a blue filter for the Castle shots and this adds a  heaviness in feel which has to be seen to be appreciated. His technique  overall with the camera is pure wizardry. For him, 'Nosferatu' was a homage  piece but, ironically, it exudes a beautifully cold type of anti-energy  which he failed to capture with any of his other works, including 'Aguirre'  and 'The Glass Blower', both being in the specter vein.  For some  reason, the remake has been murdered by professional reviewers for years.  It's been termed 'mediocre' and the like but I believe those early  reviewers lacked something. Perhaps it was the dichotomy between the reign  of slasher films and 'Nosferatu' which gave them a hard time. I'll wager  many of them wrongly had the film mentally pigeon-holed as purely being  horror before the cinema curtain fell aside and were disappointed.  Prejudice is an evil thing in this case as you need to let the movie soften  you. After all, you can't give scope to something which goes beyond all  scope.  Better than the 1922 original? No; not better, but definitely  a makeover of it which would have brought a tear to Murnau's eye for sure.  One thing is certain, though. Both 'Nosferatu' versions blow the Universal,  Hammer and all others (including the 1992 super-hyped F.F.C. version) right  out of the water. This vampire is the one Stoker must surely have seen. No  slick hair with a v-shape hairline, velvet cape or parody-deserving  suaveness. Kinski reanimates the demonology Schreck first tapped while  creating a perverse sexuality that is so implicit it is more erotic than  anything overt. The vampyre is a satanic Dorian Gray, except it's painting  is the earth in its coffin.  I'd recommend watching this late at night.  That sounds cliched but is necessary because the camera-work is so  soporific that it will play tricks on your subconscious in your slumber  hours. While you watch late at night, you will feel sleepy. Herzog works  his magic by lulling his viewers with mesmerism, almost prepping us for  Kinski to stick his head through the screen and bite our necks once we're  suitably catatonic.  Heroin for the soul as well as the eyes. This  film deserves a far, far better fate than that which it has suffered lying  in its cannisters for close to 15 years. Never seen on legal video before  and with only a few prints made for television through the 1980's, I think  what adds to the film's 'homecoming' is the fact that it is a true fetish  member of that clique, I shall leave you with two words of advice. Number  German versions as well as the original 1922 silent. Number two is watch  one of them every Saturday and Wednesday night and just see how enriched  your spirit will become.",943228800,17,4789,4.7061668681983075

The  screenplay is intelligent and spooky. The cinematography is rich and  breathtaking in it's usage of darkness, shadow and color. This film  presents the true elements of dark cinema. Herzog doesn't go for gory  scares like ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or ""Bram Stoker's  Dracula."" Instead, he takes his time with the art.

7886347,5,6305263299,"This is an excellent remake of the original Nosferatu.  While it is a remake it was in no way intended to be a better version of the original but a tribute to the original silent film by Werner Herzog. Klaus Kinski's version of the vampyre is an honest and creepy performance. He admired the orignal actor's portrayal of Nosferatu and only intended to it justice. What makes this film work as a remake is the cinematography, music and eerie lighting. The rats running through the streets as people are eating their last meals sends chills down one's spine. The music selection with the evening time lapse is beautifully done and sets the mood. The chemistry between the vampyre and Lucy is perfect. This is an atmospheric film and to compare this to the silent film is unfair. This is a retelling of a classic horror film by a director who admired the original and only wished to create an honest modern version.",1519603200,,912,4.62962962962963
7886348,5,6305263299,One of the creepiest Dracula Adaptations ever. Klaus Kinski does a tremendous job as Dracula! I do not recommend this US blu ray as many compression artifacts are visible in the English version of the Movie. The German Cut is good but if you want to see it in English you want to pick up the UK Blu Ray version of this Movie.,1517011200,,325,4.174603174603175
7886349,3,6305263299,"The movie is a remake of the original silent German movie ""Nosferatu"" from 1928 which I highly recommend if you are not turned off by the old, silent film style.

Likes: I like the authentic European locations which are fitting for the classic story of Dracula. Both interior and exterior shots reflect that authenticity of locations where I have always imagined Dracula to inhabit. This Blu-ray edition has both original German language and also English language as well as the director commentary by Werner Herzog, and vintage ""making of"" Nosferatu. Isabelle Adjani is breath-takingly gorgeous. This is a very good Blu-ray transfer and the picture looks quite clean.

Dislikes: Even though each shot is crafted well, somehow the movie seems to lack the truly eerie horror atmosphere and misses its mark. I wish the director used more soundtrack to compliment the visuals and to accentuate the impact of the scenes. But I am not sure if the minimal use of soundtrack is the only reason why the movie is not driving the intended effect on me. The acting feels a bit flat at some times and overall production seems to lack a certain flair, a style. It is just too plain.

One of my major complaints is about a climactic scene towards the end of the movie: (***SPOILERS ALERT***) When Dracula sucks on Lucy as she is lying in bed, there is no trace of blood anywhere; even when he lifts his head up, there is no drop of blood on his lips or on his teeth. I am not the kind who wishes to see blood in movies, but when the scene is about Dracula sucking on the neck of his victim, I expect a certain level of realism from the scene. I don't maybe it was due to censorship or for some other reason but it certainly ruins the scene for me. Then there is Van Helsing's killing of Nosferatu by driving a stake through Nosferatu's heart which we don't see because it happens off-screen. They also changed the original ending to give it a darker twist: even though Nosferatu is killed off properly, his curse is not lifted from Jonathan who becomes a Nosferatu himself. One other thing that bothered me was that Lucy was too pale, almost as pale as Nosferatu himself.",1514332800,,2157,4.582901554404145

7886351,5,6305263299,"Werner Herzog clearly idolized the original Nosferatu. He captures the genius of the atmosphere that made the original silent film such a creepy classic in the horror genre. From the long pans of someone walking away to the shadows creeping along walls to lead into the appearance of Nosferatu, Herzog successfully recreates all the most famous and beloved sequences of the original Nosferatu, while adding his own personal touches and depth. Nosferatu is one of Werner Herzog's finest films.

The set pieces and props are even immaculate in their disgusting vibe bringing. The dust and cobwebs in a dreary realistic castle and a man stuck in the middle of the danger. The sets are perfectly uncanny and unsettling. Werner Herzog builds a believable world to haunt you. To help the audience into imaging a town ridden with the plague, Herzog unleashed a horde of rats to inspire images of The Black Death. Herzog's uncomprising dedication to his craft is awe inspiring as it is vile in it's execution to witness. Herzog's world seems so dark.

Herzog's characters are very deep and complex. Herzog's Jonathan Harker is emotional and more relatable than many I've seen. His Renfield is crazier than ever. The Lucy character is given a bigger role than most heroines are ever given, marking Herzog's film as uniquely progressive. She has premonitions of danger to warn Harker, she figures out the secret of the vampire, and she must challenge Nosferatu both romantically and bravely.

Of course, the main draw is German mega star is Klaus Kinski as Count Dracula himself. Kinski's takes up the task of recreating and renewing the magic that was Max Schreck's legendary performance as Nosferatu. Schreck's uniquely grotesque body image is the uncanny horror of the original film. Instead, Klaus Kinski is monstrous uncontrollable who must stalk and seduce his way through eternal life. Kinski's performance is so captivating as his wild crazy eyes are so engaging as his voice and movements are so very subtle. Kinski plays Nosferatu as a sad being cursed to the shadows for eternity. It's so intriguing, especially his speech to Harker and his plea to Lucy wherein Kinski laments his infinite misery. A magnificent acting display which has aged into one of Kinski's finest. Klaus Kinski was born for these shadows.

Overall, I highly recommend Nosferatu the Vampyre as a chilling recreation of perhaps the greatest silent film, certainly the greatest horror film of its era. Werner Herzog proves his film making prowess and Kinski lays down another excellent acting performance.

This film is essentially perfect. It's more detailed and risk taking than the original. Anyone that found the original too slow or not deep enough is sure to be pleased by Herzog's shifting score, faster pace, long pans, thrilling actors, and terrifying sets. It's the ultimate remake.",1505001600,2,2863,5.095948827292111

7886354,4,6305263299,"This beautifully filmed version of Dracula recreates the look of the 1922 classic ""Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror.""  In that film Dracula (or actually ""Count Orlok"") was portrayed as a strange, bald creature who barely passes for human.  He carries around his coffin at night, spreading plague and creeping around windows like a human rat with supernatural powers.  This 1979 remake is almost the equal of that original masterpiece, and might even be preferred for viewers who feel challenged by silent films (although if you watch any silent film, the original Nosferatu is the one to watch).  But while many of the shots are perfect recreations, (the settings and props look remarkably the same) this film uses the advantages of color and dialogue to enhance the whole thing.  I do think a more interesting music score could have made it really special, but it still manages to be creepy as necessary.  The different ending will be a nice surprise for fans of the original.",1495152000,2,976,4.920731707317073
