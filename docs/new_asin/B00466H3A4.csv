4264633,5,B00466H3A4,"OK hard to write a review for a program that hasn't had all the shows actually released yet nor aired on TV but here goes.  I've enjoyed those that have been aired and I will purchase this (just as I did the DVD of Season 1.0) but I want to know when the Blu-Ray versions will be available?  Maybe, just Maybe a large enough grass roots fandom will work their magic with this just as over 30 years ago we got new Star Trek franchises!!!!  It's puzzling why networks won't allow for less than wonderful ratings when there are so many choices out there on cable that you really can't expect those HUGE viewership shares that used to occur prior to DVR's, DVD'S, VHS and Beta and certainly when there were only 3 TV viewing choices.  Hmm, come to think of it from what my grandparents told me wasn't the big seller for early TV sets the fact that on Friday Nights the local pubs would have a TV to draw in the people to watch wrestling and boxing?  Have we come full circle not because the technology costs as much as a 1/2 years salary but because programming choices seem to seel better commercial time unfortunately for those types of so called ""reality programs"" and let's face it, TV networks don't run on the ""air"" that we breath but rely upon the economy.  Maybe when things get better in that area then some of the programming like Caprica will be allowed to fully develop in the natural manner that the producers and writers intended.",1291680000,3,1440,4.415094339622642
4264634,5,B00466H3A4,"Season 1.0 of Caprica ended with over 1 million viewers and was growing up until End of Line. After that episode Syfy waited 1 month to tell us it would be moving from Friday to Tuesdays (bad move). They then waited 3 more months to tell anyone who was still paying attention that it would be back in January of 2011. Then 1 month & 1/2 later they suprised everyone (in an unpleasant way) by moving the return of Caprica back to October 2010 with less than 1 months notice and poor advertising. Then they yanked it off the air before it could gain viewers (some still don't realize that it returned). After all is said it done it will take over 640 days from the release of the pilot DVD to the last episode. When has a TV show stretched out this long in its first season ever survived?

Syfy says that there were not enough viewers to support airing Caprica. Now is your chance to prove them wrong. Although they helped to fund Caprica, Syfy does not profit from DVD sales. The divisions of NBC Universal that will profit from DVD sales are Universal Cable Productions (UCP) and Universal Studios Home Entertainment (USHE). Universal Cable Productions produced Caprica. Universal Studios Home Entertainment released the DVDs.

Syfy were the ones who pulled the plug on Caprica. With your encouragement UCP and USHE can push the plug back in.

Syfy refuses to acknowledge the over 1 million viewers in support of Caprica. Being powerful decision-makers within NBC Universal, UCP and USHE could turn the tide. They could independently produce a successful Caprica movie. They could push Syfy to fund a second season of Caprica.

By purchasing Caprica DVDs you will send a message to UCP and USHE that Syfy is wrong.

4264635,1,B00466H3A4,"Today, 11/30/2010 was the last episode for the series; shown only in Canada.  Caprica 1.0 only has the first 13 episodes (14 if you include 2 for the two part opening episode).  These were shown in USA on the SyFy channel.  Only 5 more were shown on the Space channel in Canada.  It's now cancelled, so that is it.  And these two sets are the same price?!?!  I think maybe I should wait to order until I see a better price for a 5 episode Season 1.5

SORRY, rating is minimal NOT because of Caprica's content, although I haven't seen those 5 episodes that make of ALL of Season 1.5.

And, shame on the SyFy channel for totally ruining the viewership with it's start and stop scheduling of the series.  Checkout this link describing the mess:

*******
** EDIT -- they removed the link I gave; (guess we aren't to do links. Sorry about that Amazon).  If you are a big fan you already know the story... find the website capricatimes and you can find the facts on how the SyFy channel mis-treated showing of the Caprica series.

Also, here is a quote I responded to in the Comments section of my post.  There is some question about what is included on the Season 1.5.  But as of today, Sunday 12 December 2010, it seems clear that the Season 1.5 DVD set will be much less episodes and content than Season 1.0.

""Deukalion1054 says:
I don't know where Markus and Jeffrey get their information, but the marketers of the DVD's, (NBC Universal) contradict these guys' assertion. I got to the nbcuniversalstore with the information from the syfy website on Caprica; I then clicked on Store near the top of the page and got to NBC.

""It is not splitting the season equally between the two sets. Although I agree that would make more sense... just to be fair in pricing. Or, maybe have many more extras on the fewer episodes season 1.5. Currently, neither case seem to be the fact as currently shown at the DVD's producer.

""I guess all this could change, but my information is from today, Sunday 12 December 2010. If you care to investigate for yourself, as you should, please note the times shown are for the produced show only, not the extras.

""Incidentally, the SyFy channel currently shows Jan 4, 2011 starting at 6PM US East Coast time to be the beginning of the last 5 episodes (which our Canadian friends have already seen). They are running them all together; it's all over by 11PM that night. For the rest of January 2011, I didn't see any rebroadcasts listed. I know all this could change, but that's today's status. ""

*******
** EDIT 12/20/2010 -- Finally someone posted in the Comments that bought Season 1.0 and confirmed the fact it has the first 9 Episodes.  Therefore, Season 1.5 must have the remaining 9 episodes.  Amazon currently includes a list of downloadable episodes (13 of them) under their Season 1.0 description which caused some of us to wrongly think it also represented what was in the 1.0 DVD set.",1291075200,11,2920,4.544933078393881
4264636,1,B00466H3A4,"Let me preface this review, again, with the caveat that the show itself is absolutely fine, deserves better treatment than it has been given, and is suffering these pains solely because of the indiscretions of the marketing suits that think half-season production and half-season box sets are somehow a good idea.

I direct your attention to SG-U, where just as with Caprica, they blundered and bobbled their way thru an attempt to bilk the viewing public with full price half season box sets that utterly FAIL to gain anything resembling a market hold. In the case of SG-U they seem to have learned their lesson and have recanted to release the Full Season set after the 1.0 and 1.5. However the Caprica comittee needs to have this bashed over their frakkin' heads again. If they want the DVD sales to indicate market share and product interest they ABSOLUTELY HAVE to STOP this half-season fiasco in its tracks and roll out the FULL SEASON sets we want, deserve, demand, and will settle for nothing less than.

If the forthcoming ""Chrome and Blood"" is simply a segway into the deeper stories begun in Caprica, fine. We don't want you to stop telling these tales. We just want you to stop trying to rip us off....again.

Hail and adulation to the Actors, Writers, Producers, and Crew. Frack the Marketing Suits actively killing an otherwise great show. SO SAY WE ALL.

2012-02-03 Update: The title says it all. Still waiting for my Complete Season 1 DVD Set PRICED AT THE INDUSTRY STANDARD, not the vulture frakkin' money-grubbing ""half season at full season price"" you used to seppuku the show's retail sales and consequently the entire series with.",1290902400,22,1651,4.823321554770318
4264637,4,B00466H3A4,"In response to the many people who have an opinion about Caprica - SciFi has no one to blame but themselves for not building a fan base.  Take a break, plan a hiatus, schedule 3 months, six months, or a year in between... and what you get are only the rabid fans stick around.

Caprica, while not as strong as BSG had a niche.  Slower and more detailed, it lacked the show within a series/concept that might bring people along.  Joining in the middle of a soap opera that spanned a few episodes over many years is not a winning marketing strategy.  I hope they learn from their mistakes for BSG Chrome and Blood!",1290729600,7,612,4.333333333333333
4264638,5,B00466H3A4,"Besides reading books, this is the last grasp of something to hold on that is ""Galactica"". Caprica was a new direction in sci-fi following BSG. SYFY has went as far as including more wrestling on the channel. That should be cancelled. Once again the BSG series gets short changed. I love Star Trek, Stargate,and ""the event"" but these shows are predictable. The ""Event"" is a copy of Lost. Of course, I was lost on Lost at the end of the final season. I love Stargate Universe but it should be cancelled if Caprica is cancelled because it is drama copy of BSG(Battlestar Galactica). Hawaii 5 O is good but not great. It is good because the music at the beginning reminding you of the old ""5 O"". SYFY channel has opportunities to tell many stories from the BSG series-Tom Zerek,Planet Kobol(Lords of Kobol),the other 11 colonies, The Dead Earth(13th tribe), The First Cyclon War just to name a few. SyFy has missed the boat. These could develop into series. Imagine the many stories told on this Earth. Now Ronald D. has 12 colonies to work with. Even better the Classic BSG could be brought back with enhancements. This could have been a money maker. Sad! SYFY you missed out, but there is time to recover bring back something BSG!!!",1289347200,6,1231,4.6255707762557075
4264639,5,B00466H3A4,"There are protest taking place with the delivery of apples to the network heads who apparently have no minds.  Caprica is a great show concerning the evolution of how we arrive in the world of Battle Star Galactica which was a big success.  The sets are amazing as the 12 colonies get explored along with the feud between Caprica and Turron.  How will man use artificial intelligence in robotics and virtual reality?  For some Earthlings of today this may seem very unlikely, but in the near future we will be asking ourselves what ethics and usage do we apply to these upcoming sciences.

You will seldom find a better acted series.  My favorite actor on the show is Eric Stolz, but also Alessandra Torresani and Lucy Rand (from Kyle XY) are outstanding.  The rest of the cast are also outstanding, the characters are well developed including a limited role for James Marsters (from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel).

Caprica does make you think about the conflicts of religion, cyber terrorism and culture.  Caprica does make us think about poly relationships, sexual fantasy, life after death through transference to the virtual world and/or the cybernetic world.  Perhaps too few of the human race are ready to think in more than two dimensions.  If you are a person who has an advanced mind set I encourage you to add your review, to contact SyFy, to contact NBC/Universal to save Caprica.  If you a person who is tired of mindless tv programming I encourage you to step up to shows such as Caprica.  Open your mind and dare to imagine the future.",1289088000,103,1555,4.714814814814815
4264640,5,B00466H3A4,"Another great show gone to early! Appearently the move to Tuesday was the final nail in the coffin. Up against ratings juggernaut ""Dancing with the stars"", and ""Glee"", that's a good way to kill off a show. Now we have another amazing show up for destruction on Tuesday and that's ""Stargate: Universe"". Exactly Who are the idiots that made the decision to move these once great shows to Tuesday?

Appearently there's no room for serious sci-fi/drama on television. I don't understand this. Is it our lack of patients to wait for a story to fully develop? Are we so sucked-in to short term gratification that we just can't wait for an issue to be resolved outside of a single episode? Now I don't know if I should invest my time in another serious sci-fi/drama on the SYFY channel because the execs themselves clearly aren't committed to making it work anymore. I fully expect SGU to end its run this year with no hope for season 3. It's a shame. SGU is a spectacular show, as well, especially when you watch it on DVD/Blu-Ray and you see it all together. WOW! It's really the best way to see these kinds of shows.

So long ""Caprica"". It was a nice ride but we're probably gonna get more lame-ass wrestling and campy shows like ""Eureka"" and ""Warehouse 13""(I like both by the way but still campy). Can we place our hopes on ""Battlestar Galactica: Blood and Chrome""? They'll probably put that on Sunday nights against ""Desperate Housewives"".

I did not really like all of the religious implications of one God vs. the 12 Gods in the original story line . It seems to me that the writers were trying to say God (our God) does not exists . B.G. the series was about War and the human struggle to survive . In hind sight Caprica is more like the ""Godfather"" in many ways . There is one promising feature of the DVD series . The picture playback is a full 1080 P and just as good as any Blu-ray disc . For me I wanted to see more about the Battlestar Galactica ships being built and who was in charge of designing and building them .Sister Clarice was another Bin Laden in my opinion and one who thought she was a God in her own mind and the last we see of her she is preaching to the Cylon soldiers telling them they !

The series portrays the beginnings of the development of the Cylons and offers some insights into what can go wrong when man intervenes into areas best left alone because of greed, grief or a desire for revenge. There are good special effects, plenty of action and a story development that makes you want more.

4264814,5,B00466H3A4,"I can't stress enough how much I really liked this series. But I must warn people that this is not the slam-bang action series that Battlestar Galactica was. Think of it as a very good drama series which takes place on another world; one which has many of the same issues facing it as our own.

It covers such topics as the military-industrial complex, our growing addiction to technology, bigotry, organized crime, the overly commercialized news media, terrorism and the politics associated with it, the emergence of artificial intelligence, etc. and handles them with a surprising degree of thought.

This is a series that people who simply love well written, thought provoking drama (and rarely respond to science fiction) will like very much.

It is also a series that people who like mindless, action oriented science fiction with little to say (and who hate to think while being entertained) will probably deplore.

If you love good dialogue, well crafted scripts and superlative acting I think you will like this series very much.

But, unfortunately, Universal has chosen to release this series in a non-anamorphic (although the packaging says otherwise) 1.33:1 format with the image matted on the top and bottom. What this means is that, if you have a modern, widescreen TV set, you will see an image that is the correct SHAPE to fit your screen, but the wrong SIZE. The image will appear to be a box with a frame of black around it on ALL sides (including the top and bottom).

DVDs have been released in the anamorphic format for so many years now that you just have to wonder how Universal can keep making mistakes like this. (By the way, It's not he only Universal title that I have with such format issues.)

So, if you can bear their terrible formatting, I recommend this series highly as an extremely intelligent, thought provoking, beautifully produced, written, acted and directed show. But, if you can find it on line in the CORRECT format, I would chose that over the DVDs.

Thank you Universal for messing up another DVD release (and would you please replace whoever makes these screw-ups with somebody who actually knows what they are doing and who cares about the content being issued by your studio onto disc).",1413158400,6,2234,4.829842931937173

Universal has always been great with their TV releases on DVD, and this is no exception.  Pristine 480p image that absolutely makes the most of the format, and a solid sound mix.  There are tons of deleted scenes, and the season/series finale has one of the most fascinating audio commentaries I've ever sat through (given to us by showrunner Kevin Murphy, he spills a lot of details about what his plans were for a future season).

At times, I had a hard time sticking with Caprica ... I never really felt like I had a character to root for.  But the last five episodes (incidentally the ones that were pulled from the season schedule when they were supposed to originally air on Syfy), are some of the most fantastic episodes of TV I have seen.  There is a five minute ""coda"" at the end, that works as a perfect ending to the series, even though the show runners were hoping it would be renewed for another season.

Overall, I can't blame the viewers for tuning out of this show, but it ended with some of the strongest episodes I could imagine.  If you saw Season 1.0 and aren't sure whether or not to pick this set up: do it.  It starts off with a few weak episodes, but by the end, you will be sad that it's over.",1400544000,,1411,4.29433962264151

4264863,4,B00466H3A4,"Although shot in HD, ""Caprica"" is (as of this writing) only available on DVD (why Universal has been reluctant to release this considering how well the original series sold is beyond me. They DID release ""The Plan"" and ""Blood and Chrome"" in HD on Blu-ray as well as DVD). The HD transfers for the show were already prepared for the French release and HD broadcasts so it would be very simple to port those over to a U.S. release (evidently the French release is non-region BUT because it is 1080/50i, some players may have a difficult time playing them so you are gambling if you have a U.S. player).

This is the second half of the season.

Regardless, ""Caprica"" was a fascinating series that showed a lot of promise giving us background on the early development of the Cylons and WHY they were created, touching on how they developed consciousness as well. For those of you on the fence, you could stream it here before purchasing (if you choose to do so) or at Netflix (I think it's still there).

SPOILERS:

Set 60 years before the Human/Cylon War, Caprica introduces us to two families the Adams and Greystones. Lawyer Joseph Adams (Esai Morales) tries to escape his unsavory past but still has to work for the organized crime family that provided his education. He struggles with his past and trying to keep his son Willy on the straight and narrow path.

The Graystones are led by Daniel Graystone (Eric Stoltz) who uses his company to eventually develop Cylon technology after the death of a loved one.

END OF SPOILERS:

""Caprica"" revisits the conflict between the polytheist humans and a radical religious movement that believes in monotheism and will do anything to advance their own agenda including terrorism. As with ""BSG"" there are a number of complex themes that bubble up during the first and only season of the series. Luckily, the writers/producers managed to tie up most of the loose ends of the series during the first season so the show is largely self contained.

I don't understand the marketing team and executives at Syfy which commissioned the series; while the ratings weren't as strong for ""BSG"", they elected to cancel the show after a mid-season cliffhanger and then waited months to air the remaining episodes losing any potential momentum and audience the series had. While the network has taken some bold risks at times, they've primarily made bone headed moves when it comes to promoting their series. If they had given ""Caprica"" another season I don't doubt that the show would have found an audience as well as its legs as the last five episodes found writers/producers David Eick and Ronald Moore finding ""voice"" of the series.

Perhaps Syfy felt it needed to run more reality shows or wrestling at the time but either way the network did a disservice to the series and fans by how they handed the series.

The DVD looks exceptionally good with nice detail. The look of the show is deliberately on the cool side. The audio is terrific as well on the DVDs.

The special features are solid for the set. We get podcasts, commentary tracks, deleted scenes and 30 minutes of videoblogs that originally were at the website for the series.

Although ""Caprica"" failed to capture a large audience and stumbled a bit during its first and only season, the last five episodes bring the series to a strong conclusion that could have been built on if given a chance by the powers that be at Syfy. Sadly, that never happened but the series is still a very good show and compliments the ""BSG"" reboot that proved so popular.

4264915,4,B00466H3A4,"Okay, I loved Caprica.  Absolutely loved it.  As much as I liked BSG.  This show did not deserve to get cancelled like it did.  It was such intelligent television, but BSG fans wanted a prequel to Galactica with all the requisite action found in especially the first three seasons of BSG.

Do people actually listen to Ronald D. Moore's podcast?  He always has said IT IS ABOUT the CHARACTERS!  Not about the action.  The actions is secondary to the characters, to making you care about just about every character from Starback to Tom Zarek.  Prequels have a tendency to simply suck.  Look at Star Wars, for example.  Or, the Hobbit.  They all sucked, because they tried to capture the energy from the original films, but the thing is that in order to be interesting, a prequel needs to be completely different from the original.  It needs to lead us in to how Cylons came to be.  And, this is exactly what Caprica did.  It did something very few series are capable of doing...it made a very compelling prequel.

However, I have complaints like the Adama's being so intimately involved with Cylons.  Joseph would have told his son all about the Cylons that he knew,  which was a great deal.  He knew they came from taking a built consciousness in V-World and putting them into a robot.  When Willy died, I was like, ""What the hell?  How can they kill off Adama?""  Of course, this was because Adama would have been in his 70s in the show, and Olmos was in his mid-fifties when it was filmed.  It was such a sad moment.  Yet, I wonder what direction the writers could take the Adama's anymore now that Greystone was back firmly as CEO and the Guartru was dead.  It is revealing that they only show Bill's first birthday and not any other Adama parts of the ""shape of things to come.""  They wrote themselves into a corner with the Adama's.  Like Joseph would not have told Bill about his sister in V-World (which SamT would have confirmed, or at least told him about it before Amanda shot him).

I also found it a little contrived to see Zoe coming out as a ""skin job"", even though they are careful to state she is like a Terminator and not a human being with a few differences like the humanoid Cylons.  Minor complaint.  The last episode was so exciting I was literally terrified.  But, over all, a great end to a series that should have had at least three years.  I hope RDM and DE consider a book form or comic book that is canonical for season three.  Right now, it is in the world of fan fiction.

The last show has an ending that may or may not satisfy you, but it ended in a way where answers are given, with it open ended enough to continue if given the opportunity.

The series can be watched without watching Battlestar Galactica as it stands on its own. However it does start to fill in some background but gets nowhere near to completing the story.

This review could get into a rant about how the TV companies typically cancel a series when it gets interesting or, more accurately, requires a modicum of intelligence to watch. However this series seems to have been particularly selected for destruction just as it got interesting.

Watch it and love it, but be prepared to extrapolate a little to connect all the story sequences together. An obvious must for the Battlestar fan.",1370390400,,736,4.975609756097561

4264946,4,B00466H3A4,"Unlike most prequels, Caprica not only provides a backstory but also enhances your appreciation of the original source material. There were a lot of things that bothered me about the Battlestar Galactica reboot, including the fact that the Cylons seemed so human and were monotheistic. It seemed like too far a leap for robots. Caprica provides a neat explanation for these.

First, we learn that the Cylon robots were imbued with a human personality. There's a fairly realistic (or ""realistic"") account of how a human personality could be transferred to a robot, basically treating the human soul as an aggregation of the data stored in the human brain. The personality transferred was also a devout monotheist which explains how that ""trait"" got passed down to subsequent generations of Cylons. And to boot, it's the personality of an emotionally troubled teenage girl - what a neat twist!

In addition to the Cylon origin story, Caprica also explores other moral issues. One theme throughout the series is the dangers of a virtual reality world, not unlike an amped up internet, in which people are allowed to act without inhibitions. For some, this part might seem out of place. The frequent images of teens clubbing and 1930s noir gangster scenes are a bit jarring. However, they're not just extraneous - they come to an interesting resolution near the end of the first season.

The characterization is a mixed bag. I love how Zoe Graystone, a teenage girl whose ""programming"" is installed into the first Cylon, struggles with so many issues, such as faith, reality, and love. The Adama family saga is also interesting. We'd heard a bit about Joseph Adama in the Battlestar Galactica series, but seeing him morally compromised provides a fascinating insight into the future Bill Adama's family.

The Graystone parents on the other hand are a mixed bag. Eric Stoltz brings a compelling mix of gravitas and weariness to Daniel Graystone. When he's depressed, you really see the weight of the world in his eyes. However, both he and his wife, Amanda Graystone, often find themselves making stupid decisions. In a few places, Amanda just goes off the deep-end in doing something incredibly stupid. It never completely destroys the show because while the decisions are stupid, they are human. However, I found myself losing respect for the characters as the show went on.

The show actually came to a pretty fitting conclusion at the end of season 1, despite having been cancelled. One other thing that bothered me though was that it seems the producers felt the show needed more action and intrigue. By season 1.5, some of the more interesting character development was dropped and the subplot with the terrorists became more prominent. By the final episode, the Graystones are running around Caprica trying to essentially stop a ticking bomb. There are plenty of other ""ticking bomb"" shows like 24 and I think Caprica lost a bit of something in trying to mimic them.

Overall, if you liked BSG, I think this show will help you make sense of the Cylons. Even if you weren't a BSG addict, Caprica is an interesting sci-fi show that had a lot of potential and certainly didn't deserve to be canceled.",1367107200,,3199,4.936802973977695
4264947,5,B00466H3A4,"CAPRICA is a SyFy Channel series including Season 1.0 with a two-part pilot and eight other episodes, and Season 1.5 with nine episodes. Contrary to some reviews and comments, CAPRICA has an ending. Yes, a gap exists between CAPRICA and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA: BLOOD & CHROME and the BATTLESTAR GALACTICA series proper, and there is room for another series in that gap. But the cinematic sequences at the end of CAPRICA's final episode make it clear that the end of the final episode was meant to be the end of the series.

I say it is the best cinematic science fiction drama produced to date, including theatrical releases such as AVATAR. But who am I to say such a thing? Admittedly no one special. Just a humble fan of science fiction since I was a boy in the 1950s.

Why is CAPRICA the best? I hope I do not need to convince you that the sensual aspects of action sequences and special effects are less fulfilling than the intellectual intricacies of drama and science, because the latter two are what make CAPRICA the best. It has powerful characterizations, superb scripting, and diverse storylines that absorb your interest as they move toward conjunction. What's more, the series has a tasteful thematic background that blends computer-science virtual reality with the psychology of being (ontology). More than once in your viewing--assuming a modicum of discernment on your part--you will be faced with the question, ""What must be present for the self to exist?""

Rest assured that CAPRICA is not entirely cerebral; it does offer carnal excitement. The cinematography is not the best, though I expect it would be better in Blu-ray. Still, the standard DVD is agreeable. What is critical is that the environment is clean and bright, futuristic, and at times surprisingly convincing. Also, violent scenes are not done with timidity. (You might want to view the series before letting your rugrats view it.) Sexual scenes are more tame, however. No bare breasts or genitals, unless you watch the unrated, extended version of the Pilot.

Be advised! After guzzling a six-pack of beer, you may not be able to keep track of what's going on. You need to respect this production and pay attention (enabling subtitles may help). But if you are looking for science fiction that offers more than laser-beam pyrotechnics and exploding starships, tune into this heady drama.",1366848000,6,2368,4.9571788413098234
4264948,4,B00466H3A4,"I just now finally got to see Caprica.  I've watched only the episodes themselves -- I haven't looked at any of the ancillary material yet.  I'll get to it someday soon I hope.

Everything weighed in, I think it was a pretty good show.  Literary types watching probably caught the parallel between Daniel Graystone and Victor Frankenstein.  Most people know Frankenstein only from that silly comic-book of a movie Boris Karloff was in in 1932.  In Shelley's original novel, VF was a more sympathetic character, with good intentions at heart -- grief drove him to make his creature.  Had Mary Shelley lived in the 21st century, she might have written Caprica or something like it.

I thought that on the whole it had the BSG mark on it -- no top-down plot, it just sort of...goes.  The producers plainly didn't start with a strong plot structure, just themes and ideas they wanted to hit, like they did with BSG.  One got a sense that the story wasn't driving toward anything in particular (except of course that it had to end with the Cylons being really, REALLY mad at the Colonists).

I thought Caprica well-written and mostly well-acted.  Genevieve Buechner, the actress who played Tamara Adama, left me a little cold.  I just never quite bought into her portrayal.  She seemd to me uninvested in Tamara, like she didn't ""get"" the girl herself.

I thought Caprica gave an interesting look at an advanced and continually advancing technological society, with all that that implies.  In our own real world we are faced (whether we know it, whether we admit it) with real and serious questions of the effect of technology on us.  If the Capricans should have looked before they leapt, what about us?  When the next big thing comes along, will we stop to ask questions?  Will we, like the Capricans, find in our midst a monster of our own making and wonder how we came to that?

The show had good production values, but the effects at times seemed a little less than real.  At times I just didn't quite buy the effects, like they weren't quite finished, maybe, like maybe they were a little rushed...

I think this is good character-driven drama and good SF.  In what may be a curious irony, it may not be the best light to cast on the BSG universe.  I don't know any of the behind-the-scenes history, what went on during the making of the show, or anything like that, so some of my impressions and theories of this may be off, I know.

Having said that though I got a sense of the producers rushing through the end of the season, as if they knew the show would end in a few more weeks.  It just seemed like an awful lot happened at the end and an awful lot of it was incredibly convenient.  Really, a piece of electronic hardware with a terrorist organization's entire plan on it conveniently falling into Graystone's hands, still lying there in a park days later, at the moment it was most needed was an incredibly convenient development.  The surprising events with the boy Willie and then the appearance of little Bill during that montage..it seemed they were rushing to tie up loose ends and bridge Caprica with BSG.  I have an idea in my mind that Willie was supposed to have a transformative arc over several seasons and they just couldn't fit it in in the shortened time they had, so they engineered a convenient bait-and-switch.

None of this is the fault of the producers I think.  Suddenly hit late with a cancellation notice (as I suspect is what happened) they maybe went into an emergency crisis mode trying to hit the major plot points they wanted to hit and be able to connect the dots to BSG.  The real clue to this was the montage at the end of the final ep.  It struck me as a statement of ""This is all the stuff we wanted to cover when we thought we'd be on for more than one season.""  It provides us with the barest bare-bones skeletal structure to enable us to put the two shows together into something resembling a cohesive whole.",1366761600,,3952,4.535310734463277

4264952,2,B00466H3A4,"The sad part was I started my complete re imagined Battlestar Galactica experience with this series. I made it 5 episodes in this one before moving onto the real star of the whole franchise. Well for Caprica, the idea is a neat one, I'll admit. There aren't many good scifi shows (or that many actually good shows on currently on SYFY to begin with) that wants to pull the audience into a different world or universe where it has it's own history, look, and feel to it while making it pretty darn realistic. Much like how Star Trek the Next Generation or Deep Space Nine did for me as a kid....

But for Caprica, the wonder dwindles VERY FAST. The idea of how the Cylons got to the point of hating the humanity of the colonies is still something that I wished they worked on more and a completely different manner than how it became on Caprica. The first 3 episodes do start great, but just drag almost immediately and has moments that the show's developers think is interesting, but ultimately just make it a complete yawn fest. I actually threw up my hands and cheered ""FINALLY!"" when I heard the infamous words: ""BY YOUR COMMAND!""  But this was probably the highlight of the show's entirety.

I haven't personally got to finish this series, and I really don't want to. When it was still on syFy, I tried two more episodes after the series's midseason break, and I still could not get into it. By that point, I was already in season 3 of Battlestar Galactica. There is a huge enjoyment gap between the two.

My suggestion, skip out on this, and watch the REAL prequel, Blood & Chrome. You'll be demanding more from that timeline in this BSG franchise than this one.",1364169600,,1667,4.491749174917492

I only wish the Battlestar audience was a little more patient, because we would have gotten the origins of the time before Cylons and what led to their hatred of humans. The Caprica series probably only had 3 seasons in it maximum to be able to tell the whole story, but sadly it ended after only 1. I bought it anyway for how much I enjoyed it.

I just finished seeing the last episodes of Battle Star two months ago (was a so so fan of the series), and the Caprica (Cylons beginning) appears very logical.  The soldiers of the one (STO) religious aspects were a bit wooden and contrived.  The actors were given a difficult task, and the combination of the poor plot development and limited acting skills was quite apparent with most of the STO sub plot (the worst part of the series).  There were good plot twists and turns and some truly well done sub plot endings (the best part of the series is in the season 1.5).  Eric Stoltz ""nailed it"" as the inventor of the Cylons. He is a serious actor and I don't think anyone else could have done a better job.  Over all the 1.0 season and the 1.5 season were a solid 4 out of 5.

There are still some slow moments and wrong turns and near misses, but these are either corrected, made up for, or just covered up by the ever-accelerating plotlines and growing characters. While the visuals (design and fx-wise) of ""Caprica"" have always been inspired (if sometimes rather derivative), here they improve vastly in dramatic impact as the storylines intensify in stakes and complexity.

But, alas, that evil stupid channel cancelled this show, and we are left with.....?  Well, it doesn't just ""stop,"" like the TV shows of old often seemed to do (re: ""Star Trek:TOS""); no infamously terrible ""I-hate-you-studio-for-cancelling-our-show-so-we'll-insult-the-fans"" debacle like ""ST: Enterprise,"" either, thankfully. And not quite a ""most-shocking ""ending"" possible tactic so some studio will HAVE to pick us up for another season"" gambit like ""Farscape."" Instead, the last three episodes (particularly the very last) are like a mad, headlong rush to get as much ""wrapping up"" and issue-addressing crammed in as possible, and the results are, well, breath-taking. I'm still debating the relative merit and result of this, but these last episodes generally seem to work.

 It all gets to a point where the last ten minutes of the finale are as much an extended preview of the next season(s) that could have been, as they are a desperate quickie tie-them-together montage of subsequent events that lead to the rest of ""BSG"" Redux's backstory. And, crazily enough, it works. Should there have been another season or two of ""Caprica?"" Sure. Are we better off not having had them, and therefore these last episodes with its crazy montage-cum-quasi-preview can be considered plenty? Maybe. Yes, the ending is a clear statement of ""we had so much more really cool story to tell,"" but maybe in this case, the wanting is so much more fun and satisfying than the having. Again, *Maybe*.

All of the elements were there to make something good- cast and setting. After a semi-interesting pilot, the series devolved into a convoluted soap opera about a teen aged girl/terrorist/religious nut. Sorry- but the mono-theistic robot theme was the weakest part of BSG(2003). Caprica was not improved or elevated by basing the whole wretched show on BSG's weakest plot element.

Religious robots? You GOT to be frakking kidding. Machines don't need invisible friends. That's a problem endemic to neurotic humans.

4265008,5,B00466H3A4,"After hearing the negative feedback about Caprica from fans of Battlestar Galactica, I avoided it, unwilling to invest almost 18 hours into an unfinished show that many people considered mediocre at best. I probably would never have watched it, except that it showed up on Netflix recently. I figured I would just watch a bit of the first episode while I ate dinner.  Five days later, I'm now convinced this was an ambitious, yet wildly misunderstood show that deserved a larger audience.  From the complaints made by critics of the show, it seems like a lot of BSG fans were hoping for more BSG--not an unfair expectation or hope, but to me, that would have been a shallow attempt to recapture lightning in a bottle.  What makes this show so captivating is the risk it took by moving away from the visual and plot elements that made the previous show so successful.  You won't find any space battles, politics, or that tense feeling of precarious survival.

Instead, we're presented with a world parallel to our own, where people use technology as an escape from the realities of life.  Of course these characters are going to be different than those audiences met on Galactica. This is a world of excess, of hubris and invincibility.  We see various parties, from corporate industries, the military, to religious organizations all marching forward, never stopping to consider where the beat of progress leads.  There are some clunky moments in the series, from a few ham-fisted attempts to shove religious philosophical insight down our throats to various plot holes and inconsistencies.  But the overall story arc and plotting was more consistent, as if the writers knew where they were going, even if the audience didn't, at least until the end.

And at that end, it's unfortunate this show didn't get a fair chance at finding an audience. It is significantly different than BSG, but in all of the right ways. The production quality was top-notch, the writing was strong, and the actors embodied their roles. Perhaps most importantly, it explored an entirely different part of the BSG universe, while at the same time fitting in consistently within that world. If you put these two series side-by-side, they are part of the same mythology and story--it was just hard to see it at the time.",1331337600,59,2293,4.88659793814433
4265009,4,B00466H3A4,"Season 1.5 contains all of the rest of the episodes in Caprica (after the pilot movie and Season 1.0 DVD).  It includes the series finale.  There is and will not be a Season 2.  The story is complete in one season.  I mention these things because of comments in other reviews.

I wondered as I contemplated seeing this series whether it could be anywhere near as good as Battlestar Galactica, the reimagined version.  The latter was one of my favorite TV shows, and definitely my favorite Sci Fi so far.

I would not call the Caprica series essential to those who watched BSG, but it IS interesting.  It provides a background story on key plot elements from BSG, such as the rise of the robots and how and why the became enemies of the people of Caprica, as well as the rise of the religious conflict between the monotheists and the polytheists, who in BSG seem to be the robots vs the people.  In Caprica, the monotheists are also people, and they are regarded as terrorists.

Oppressed people, people who are not treated fairly, sometimes resort to violent means to change the system.  One can be sympathetic to the monotheists for being oppressed.  At the same time, they have a darker side, as you'll learn in this part of the series.

The writers sure love plot twists.  But the oddest thing of all was while watching the season finale, which for the first half seemed to be going at the same leisurely pace of the rest of the series, was how it suddenly went into warp drive (sorry) and gave us the highlights of the rest of the story.  But thinking back on this, I think it actually worked well.  And the story did add a couple of key pieces of the puzzle into place.

Very satisfying, even if it was not as compelling as BSG.  Recommended.",1329696000,6,1747,4.457413249211356
4265010,5,B00466H3A4,"Caprica was a brilliant show, but I understand why SyFy decided to cut it short. Ultimately, the decision must have come down to money, which would imply lack of viewership. I can only surmise that Caprica suffered not from a lack of appreciation for its brilliance by SyFy and its viewers but from an unfortunate lack of sensitivity to human limits. Fifteen hours of Greek tragedy is enough even for devoted viewers. Though the tragedy was very well-done, I began to notice that watching it in a marathon session, which is the first way I experienced the series, really started to take a toll on my psyche. And I am a hardcore reimagined Battlestar Galactica fan who has watched that entire series no less than six times prior to viewing Caprica. Once the darkness begins in Caprica, which is almost immediately, there is not a single fun and light moment to pierce through it, save for a brief one-minute scene in the ironically-named Episode Four, Gravedancing, where the male technician gets the female robot to dance (to Captain Ahab's awesome 2010 electro-synth dance-pop track, ""Was Love""). And where were the brilliant quips and one-liners from complex and maverick characters like Saul Tigh and Number One that made the reimagined Battlestar Galactica so lovable? Nowhere-- Caprica's dialogue was serious and meaningful throughout, which lent to the characters themselves, for all their well-acted depth of personality (perhaps with the exception of Polly Walker's character,  Clarice Willow), somehow seeming flat-- essentially symbols of different states/muses of spirituality and life such as innocence, evil, insanity, conflict, loyalty, vengeance, and justice. Again, this is how tragic Greek plays were written, and my hat goes off to Caprica-- I definitely would have wanted to see the missing five episodes-- but I would guess it was for Caprica's nearly-complete lack of any upbeat elements that beginning-to-get-depressed viewers went on to other things and the show met an early end.",1318723200,13,2003,5.220496894409938

I fell in love with Eric Stolz.  Loved all the characters.  The music was heavenly, and I wish to god they would sell the opera aria that was in Season 1.5 when Amanda Greystone was deciding to leave her husband.  But they apparently only sell the music for season 1.

4265040,5,B00466H3A4,"I just finished watching Caprica Season 1.5.  I discovered Battlestar Galactica on DVD and followed it avidly on the Syfy (formerly SciFi) network.  I was thrilled to see a prequel series.  I found it to have a profound emotional impact while addressing many contemporary issues in a very forward-looking way.  In its own way, it calls to mind what Star Trek did, in offering social commentary on issues that were either relevant at the time or soon would be.

By the time Season 1.0 ended, I was wondering if perhaps there was too much going on all at once.  Season 1.5 really ramps it up and as it draws to its stunning climax, easily matches Battlestar Galactica at its finest, in my opinion.  There is a brief preview of what would have come had the series not been cancelled, and all I can say is, why in the world did SyFy cancel this show?  They were finally going to get into the concepts as far as the Cylons that made Battlestar Galactica such an insightful and enjoyable series to watch.

I'm so disappointed that there will be no more story now that it's over.  But it's definitely worth the ride.  I hope the rumors about Battlestar Galactica: Blood and Chrome will materialize into a full show that will continue this mythology soon.

The story that Caprica 1.0 and 1.5 tell is absolutely fascinating.  Not only does the viewer learn more about colonial society, we get to actually see some of the other colonies!  Tauron for one, and the fascinating Gemenon for another.  The reveal of information about the diverse colonial cultures would be reason enough alone to watch the series, but I'll add that the acting is terrific.  Conflict, the primary driver for plot, is effectively used throughout each episode on both 1.0 and 1.5, but it really ramps up in Caprica 1.5.  From Zoey's self-discovery on what it means to be or not be human, to Joseph Adama's descent into the ""family business"" to Daniel and Amanda's rocky relationship, each actor gives repeat riveting performances.  While I do look forward to future BSG series and DVD sets with anticipation, I wish Caprica had more DVD sets to come as good as this one.",1297468800,17,1065,4.755434782608695

Was the Cylon war a mother-father-daughter conflict gone viral?  Does a younger generation possess the genetic mandate that the older generation be terminated at some point?  And what happens when the parents refuse that mandate?  Would successful life extension technology adopted by an older generation trigger parenticide in the younger in order to insure their own survival?  Does an immortalized race need to become reproductively sterile in order to insure their own immortality?  Or again, would the younger generations seek their destruction?  What then, is the ultimate destiny of immortals? To return to the beginning???  Who then, is/are the Creator(s)?  So many questions...

The viewer is cautioned against investing too much interest in Caprica, a most excellent science fiction saga at many levels, as it is only a **partial work** aborted after its first, formative year due to that malfunctioning and mismanaged incubator called the SyFy Channel, which seems to be in the business of debasing genuine works of science fiction to the level of ""product"" out of the greed for advertising dollars.

Had a 1950's era SyFy Channel commissioned J.R.R. Tolkien to create The Lord of the Rings, then today the world would possess merely the first tantalizing chapter or two, leaving the remaining larger epic, and the profound commentary of the human condition within, abandoned and thus unknown for all time.  Such is the fate of Caprica, which coincidentally followed a similar fate to J. Michael Straczynski's ""Crusade"" series at the hands of TNT.

Hopefully Caprica's producers and writers, who have earned our eternal gratitude - Ronald Moore, David Eick and Remi Aubuchon - may continue their work under a production and broadcast network dedicated to attracting, holding and growing a genuine science fiction audience community.  And hopefully some avenue will open up for Caprica's million plus followers to support, promote, finance and reward this important work.

4265060,5,B00466H3A4,"Caprica is a brilliant piece of science fiction. I'm sure Caprica pushed the envelope too far in too many directions for some viewers. The characters are never consistently sympathetic, and the Taurons are complete boors (isn't that like real life?). How do terrorists think? The writers take the question seriously. The sets make no attempt to depart from earth norms where not relevant to the storyline - I thought this was an elegant solution to a perpetual problem in science fiction, and if you think Moore is on his own here, check out Alphaville, by Godard (who uses a Ford Galaxy to represent ""inter-galactic space""). Aspects of the storyline are maddening (oops - real life again!). I have struggled with not liking the characters in Caprica. This is a trend in current science fiction television - consider Stargate Universe as well. (In SGU, I was fine with the unlikable characters, but I am very tired of unlikable aliens - which SGU initially dispensed with, and which Caprica has no requirement for - a plus in my book!) What has finally brought me around with Caprica is the brilliant portrayal of the complex relationship of the Graystones. Science fiction isn't supposed to be about ""character development,"" yet Moore and company have shown that you can develop characters and still make science fiction. They even brought in a soap opera guy for the second half. Unconventional, but it worked! Bully for them, this is worthwhile stuff. Yes, Caprica is hard to watch at times - many times. But Caprica also takes TV science fiction to new places that are worth going. Ultimately, I have been blown away by the achievements of the first year.",1295136000,3,1659,4.886524822695035
4265061,4,B00466H3A4,"I love the show, but it had doomed itself along with the SyFy Network.  Number one.  It was soooooo slow in developing and getting to the point.  The first episode (April 2009) came out and BAM!  Gangbusters!  Had me hook, I wanted to see more. But it was only available as a download or a DVD.  The Jan 22, 2010 is when the broadcast version of Caprica came out NINE MONTHS LATER.  You are asking people to wait 9 months, people move on.  This is either the fault of the producers or SyFy or both.  So, from episode to episode it would just let out bits and pieces, which was fine, but the BIG HUGE MISTAKE was breaking the ONLY Season into two parts.  This doomed the show.  Because it ended in the middle and early, Season 1.0 ended in March 2010 with no explanation.  That is when the show lost a HUGE percent of its viewers.  The show started back up 7 months later, in October of 2010, with absolutely no fanfare.  Lucky for me, I had order the Season Pass on iTunes.  The show ran 4 weeks in October and then on one night, in January, 3 months later, it just threw the last 5 episodes which at least two of them broadcasting before primetime and one broadcasting late night.  Now I am hoping that Ron D. Moore would find another home for this.  I think it should go true cable and air on Showtime.

Now with that out of the way, the last 5 episodes were amazing.  And this show needs a second season because so many things are left unanswered.  The have a nice little wrap up at the end of Caprica with what looks like previews for Season 2.  So it seems as if some things have already been film.  I don't see the harm for SyFy network.  Unfortunately SyFy is own by NBC so it can't truly be the independent network that it should be.  Nevermind about all that.  More Caprica.  I thought all the actors were really good on the show.  Its amazing that they had the talents of Esai Morales and Eric Stoltz.

It's really good to watch the series, episode after episode so the DVDs are worth purchasing.  The show seems to work better when you can sit down and watch them back to back to back.  Otherwise, the episodes seem to have odd points of ending.  I think the writers didn't know what direction they wanted to go into.  Did they want to talk about the creation of the cylon or did they want to talk about how Adama came to be, because there were two distinct story lines going on.

I just don't think they pulled it off, which is probably why it's been cancelled.

And in the process it dealt with the concepts of morality, religion and free will. Its presented a vivid picture of a dystopian future where technology enables and amplifies  humanity's darkest impulses.

The cast is first rate with Eric Stoltz as Daniel Greystone and Esai Morales and Joseph Adama.  The story unfolds as a story arc starting with their paths crossing when Joseph Adama's wife and daughter are killed in a terrorist attack by the Soldiers Of The One, a monotheistic cult bent on destroy the old world order.  What follows afterward is a chain of events in which the main characters unwittingly set the stage for the rise of the cylons and for the eventual rebellion against their human masters.

The series overall is very good but there some issues that contributed to its cancellation. In the previous episodes, the overall story line takes a little too much time to develop.  There really isn't a sense of movement and takes on too much of of teen-age soap opera elements.  The characters never seem to connect with the audience.  None of them are that sympathetic.  I had a hard time cheering for any of them.  It makes you wonder if humanity had it coming.

Fortunately this crop of episodes more than makes up for it.  The show really started to have life.  You began to see all of the pieces start to fall into place and you could connect the dots to see where it was leading with a few surprises along the way.  And then the show was canceled.

Why did the show fail?  The blame has to lie with the network.  The first half of the season was aired early in 2010 with a 5 month hiatus until the next half was aired which really disrupted the pacing.  That directly contributed to its loss of viewership.  If you watch the first and second halves together, the show presents a much more cohesive story arc.  SyFy really didn't do much to promote the return of the show in the Fall either.

I wonder if SyFy was really committed to the show anyway.  The producers had to lobby hard just to get the show green lit.  They didn't even give them a full season to start with at first.  The final five episodes on the DVD were not even aired in the US.  They are the best in this set.  After watching the last episode, I got the sense that the producers and writers knew they were very short leash and were probably not going to be renewed.  It had feel of a series finale.

This was one of the most shortsighted decisions by a network in a misguided attempt to re-brand its image.  The producers should look for another network to pick the show up and their upcoming Blood And Chrome BSG story.  Bye bye SyFy.",1293235200,10,2794,4.447731755424063
4265079,4,B00466H3A4,"Since this product was announced there have been numerous reviews posted here that have nothing, NOTHING, to do with the actual DVD set. While I share in the general anger at SyFy for having canceled Caprica, I thought it best to actually wait until the DVD set arrived before making any judgment and limit that to what was offered. Now, after having watched all three DVDs in the set (down one from the four-set Season 1.0), it's time to open this can o' worms and put out my opinion.

Caprica Season 1.5 includes all nine of the final episodes, those aired in October of this year and the remaining five that SyFy has chosen to air in toto on 5 January, coinciding with ABC's broadcast of ""V"". Like the first set, these episodes were well written, well executed, and brilliantly acted by the amazing ensemble cast brought into the project. Additionally, there were many more ""Easter eggs"" for BSG fans, including the origins of ""toaster,"" ""skin job,"" and which of Admiral Adama's parents had the farm with the fox problem mentioned in BSG Season four. These episodes also delved further into Tauron culture and the origins of the Adama family itself in ""The Dirteaters,"" arguably the best episode of the series.

However, there were problems. Aside from the fifteen-second scene in a so-far unaired episode where someone in the props department forgot to cover the British Columbia license plate on a nearby parked car, there were far fewer video blogs and deleted scenes compared to the first set. This either means video blogs weren't produced and the episodes weren't hacked up too much in editing or Universal wanted to get this product out as quickly as possible and overlooked perhaps some more interesting stuff about Caprica. Maybe all of that was covered in the first set, I don't know. I just felt that there could have been more included in this current set; after all, it cost the same as the first.

Still, after watching them I have to agree with many viewers here and on Facebook that the last five episodes were Caprica's best. The final episode, ""Apotheosis,"" ended with what could be seen as both a wrap-up of the series and a teaser for what was supposed to come. If only SyFy had stuck to its science-fiction roots and not gone after the redneck viewer with incessant ""ghost-hunting"" and ""professional wrestling"" programs we may have seen Caprica come into its own.

I don't see any unaired episodes. The last video on this set was apotheosis which aired on nov 30th?

Anyone had the same thing happen to them?",1292889600,3,261,4.098039215686274
4265081,5,B00466H3A4,"This show is one of the greatest things on television in the past few years. It is a Sci-Fi show, but it is fascinating and I believe it will appeal to non Sci-Fi fans as well. The story of Caprica is brilliant focusing on the events that lead to the events of Battlestar Galactica. Please not that this is the second half of the season as season 1.0 is the first episodes of the show. This is one of my favorite shows of have ever seen, and I watch a lot of TV, and it was canceled well before it should have. I desperately hope it will be saved by Syfy or picked up by another channel because it really deserves to tell its story. Great gift for any fan of great storytelling that makes you think. A very intelligent television series. 5/5.",1292371200,7,742,4.195804195804196
4265082,1,B00466H3A4,"No way I am going to pay $35 for 10 episodes that are not even blue ray. They screwed us cutting it off the way they did, and did not offer 1.0 in Blu-Ray. the show was just getting really interesting for us hard core BSG fan. Then they cancel, and want us to pay $70 for non HD for the whole season? LMAO. I only paid $60 for the BR seasons of Lost a peice. I loved the series. But uuuuhhhhh....we are not stupid. This is truly trying to milk the fans, and I look down on SyFy and universal. They can become a channel of perpetual Giant Spider movies. I for one am gettig sick of their ability to market shows. StarGate is one of the worst series ever, but they keep that trype going. Its the orginal Star Trek without a spaceship.",1292371200,16,732,4.055172413793104
4265083,5,B00466H3A4,"They started airing Firefly at 7pm which did build into a great night on their station .. Firefly, Stargate, Stargate Atalantis then Battlestar .. it was a great night .. Friday was my night to watch their channel.  Moving it to Tuesday are you frakking kidding me? why? (and yeah still bitter about firefly going only one season as well)

Now they want to promote wrestling .. in whose mind is wrestling part of a channel called Sy Fy or Scifi or whatever ... sure its fantasy and you might as well put NASCAR on there as well if that's the audience mentality the wondertwins in charge seem to be targetting ... Pardon us if we want our mind challenged by any show of Caprica's nature.

I have digressed .. Caprica had such potential and showed us where BSG came from .. I would recommend buying it, though I have only personally seen 3/4 of a a far too shortly lived series.  I hope the series finale answers some questions .. questions NBC did not answer with the cancellation of Sarah Conner Chronicles and even Bionic woman and Heroes.

Good Job NBC again,  NOT!!!! ( owner of sy fy by the way) for introducing us to something then pulling the plug.",1292025600,7,1154,4.4454976303317535

I just read the description for the season 1.0 set and it includes all the episodes that were already shown on TV.  Is this set going to be a continuation of those episodes?  How many more will there be?  I've read that there will only be 5, in any at all.  Sy-Fy's website doesn't have any info that I could find.  If anyone knows what episodes or how many there will be, please post it.  As for the series, I love it and highly recommend it.  I can't believe it was canceled.",1291939200,4,552,4.093457943925234

8417072,5,B00466H3A4,"The second half of Ronald D. Moore's prequel series to ""Battlestar Galactica"" picks up with Daniel Graystone having separated from his wife Amanda, who is living with Sister Clarice Willow and the Soldiers of the One. Meanwhile, Joseph Adama is taking a more active involvement in the Ha'la'tha, alongside his brother. Both work to teach young William Adama more about his Tauron culture. Lacy Rand is drawn further into the extremism of the Soldiers of the One as the Global Defense Department look to crack the monotheistic terrorist organization. Finally, the Cylons enter full production, but are not yet sentient and events in the holoband bleed over into the real world.
The first half of the season was mostly set up and, while interesting, this second half delivers the payoff. Unfortunately, the series was cancelled just as it got really good, leading to an epilogue in the final episode that shows the various ideas the series could have explored in greater depth had there been an opportunity. It also helps ensure that the cancellation didn't leave any major continuity issues unresolved. The later prequel film, ""Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome,"" includes some slight references to this show. My only complaint is SyFy's habit of releasing half seasons. This 1.5 season only contains the second half of the show and fans must purchase 1.0 to own the full series.",1515974400,2,1381,5.06140350877193
