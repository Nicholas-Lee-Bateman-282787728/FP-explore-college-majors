6958539,5,B00S4YGWLA,"A Haunting has been one of my favorites since the pilot, 'A Haunting in Connecticut' premiered back in 2002. I was shocked when season 6 ended on Oct 20th after only four episodes. You would think Destination America could have produced at least one more new episode for Halloween week. Needless to say, I was disappointed.

Destination America has made up for the short season 6, as promised, with a whopping 16 episodes for season 7. The 16 episodes are presented in 1:78 anamorphic widescreen and are spread evenly across four dvds.

The episodes are:

Disc One:
01 Demon's Revenge
02 The Shadowman
03 Demon Unearthed
04 Evil Never Dies

Disc Two:
05 Ashes to Evil
06 Devil Inside Me
07 Child's Play
08 Ghost Fury

Disc Three:
09 Nightmare in the Attic
10 Shape of Evil
11 Trapped in Terror
12 Portal of Doom

Disc Four:
13 Ghost Inferno
14 Curse of the Mummy
15 Conjuring Evil
16 Phantom Room

The pilots and first four seasons of A Haunting are my favorites. I found some of those genuinely too scary to watch alone with the lights off. I think it is more effective to keep the threat off screen or in the shadows like most of those episodes did. Starting with Season 5 the show added more flashy fx which didn't quite work for me as well. I think showing less is sometimes more when it comes to scares. My imagination takes over and I often imagine creepier things than what would be shown on the screen. These new episodes are still creepy in their own way and up to the standards of the previous seasons. If you loved the previous seasons, you should be pleased with season 7 as well.",1424908800,48,1592,4.431506849315069
6958570,5,B00S4YGWLA,This season is filled with great episodes that just keeps you wanting to watch until the season ends. I think why I love this show so much and it really intrigues me is because the people are actually telling their stories about what happen to them.

It has and always will be on the top of my list but know I have to question the last episode of season 7 called Shape of Evil. I have seen this before but it was when the twins were newborns and there was blood all over the babies room. His wife was pushed on the front porch at a totally different house.

But for me, changing the information regarding the incident like those who are involved makes you question the credibility of the events. Those may very well be a made up story.

6958624,5,B00S4YGWLA,I have loved this show since it first started 10 years ago. This season they ramped up the demonic possessions and poltergeist hauntings. Some of it is really not for a younger audience as it's quite scary and one of the stories implies the sacrifice of a child took place in the bedroom that would later belong to a teenager. I also really like how 2 stories were tied into one on this season. Usually each story is only featured in one episode and that is all you get this time around two victims of brutal demonic possessions came together to give each other the support they needed. The freaky demons and ghosts were especially scary. The make-up dept definitely deserves an Emmy Award for their work.,1440633600,,705,4.559055118110236

6958631,2,B00S4YGWLA,"Death is high camp.

This season is the funniest of all the A Haunting seasons.  In the early days of this series, the stories were interesting and sometimes quite chilling.  The sets were dark and foreboding. The stories were more about ghosts rather than demonic possessions.

*******SPOILER ALERT*********

This season is just a parody of itself. The editing is terrible. Every time something exciting happens, the show stops for a commercial break (commercials not included here). When it returns, it almost entirely replays everything that happened in the previous section, and only advances the story slightly.  The show was to be about 40 minutes per episode, but the actual amount of story excluding the repetition, is about 15 minutes in some cases.

Sometimes the editing results in unintentional hilarious results. One of the interviewees says"" I knew there was something wrong..."" and then a clip is played where a cult shouts ""Hail Satan!""  I guess that was his clue!

Of the 16 stories, about 10 follow almost the exact same plot.  Family moves in a house, but only arrive with a couple boxes, and usually get out of  a car. No moving van. No pick up trucks of stuff.  The family is happy, dad is usually the happiest.

Most of the stories use the same cellar as in previous seasons.

Most of the stories use Halloween masked demons.

Almost every story has items thrown.

All have terrible acting.

I just didn't think this season was that good.",1436054400,5,1460,4.846153846153846

However, This season features an excessively large percentage of stories about ""Demons"". Producing True ""demon"" stories is better than No stories being produced, but I prefer the earlier seasons when there were more stories about ""Non"" Demons. I miss the older format of those season too, especially the music, and that short creepy piano ""riff""... Still, A must have for the fans and collectors of the show...

If you are a fan of Paranormal Witness you will love A Haunting and I recommend you do as I did... Buy every single season on DVD and support them so they continue making more. Good job, everyone! Keep up the amazing work! I can't say much much I loved this season! WOW!

As a final note, the case was just like every other DVD case and I found everything to be in good quality. The case contained 4 separate discs and each disc had 4 episodes. They run about 43 min long.",1430870400,,832,4.232704402515723

Demons appearing in Halloween masks just takes away all the fear and excitement that was always there in this series.  Now, it seems stupid.  On top of the fact that no one in the movie ever mentions the horror of seeing these things.  They just say, ""It just felt like something wasn't right.""  Yeah, no kidding!  You don't even mention the demon in the Halloween mask???  If I saw something like that, that would be the ONLY thing I freaked about.  Did they get a new director or something?

6958644,5,B00S4YGWLA,"How scary is season 7 of A Haunting in my view? 9/10. Scary enough that after watching this as a true skeptic and being a long time fan of the series since season 1, I had trouble going to sleep with these images playing in my mind, actually on guard that these first hand accounts could be possible. There are demon ghosts in A Haunting Season Set Seven (4 discs, 4 episodes per disc, 43 minutes per episode, 688+ minutes) that attack their victims while they try to sleep based on these real life accounts, with the original narrator throughout the series returning here.

The appearance of these demon ghosts is frightening and feature some of the scariest make up (for the actors portraying the ghosts) in the entire series. With the frightening appearance of the demon ghosts, the expert direction to increase the horror, the convincing first hand accounts from the actual victims, and the fact that the ghosts are attacking during our most vulnerable state (sleep or awaking from sleep), the scares are effective and plentiful more than ever in this season. As a sidenote:  Many accounts took place recently, as near as 2014. Some from the 80's to 1990's, one from the 60's.
In other words, if your mind is open to the possibility of ghosts, prepare to be frightened if you watch this just before bed time.

Only concern from season 7 would be the recapping of the story each time a commercial pause occurs (since this was made for TV, though no commercials appear here thankfully). There are evil chants reenacted in the telling of these stories that are repeated several times because of the recapping. Are these the actual words used to raise these demon ghosts? If they are, that makes this disc even more potentially frightening as I have no intention of raising any spirits, just want to see more ghost stories. Hopefully they're not rehearsing actual chants to raise the dead. I know it's a TV show, but if this stuff is actually real (since the unknown is truly unknown until discovered), watch with caution. Most of the people here seem genuine and believable. Frightening possibilities here...
One more thing> The stories I have the most difficulty believing would be the ones where the people claim they were possessed, rather than just put in a very bad mood from the torment of the ghost entity. I'm not saying they didn't experience something horrific, but it's hard to know what their history is in terms of mental health prior to these events to truly determine the validity of their claims of being possessed. These stories are usually resolved by reciting religious passages, moving out, or having a ghost investigator examine the home.

Scare Factor for A Haunting Season Seven: 9/10. While most episodes are scary, only a few have less malicious ghosts that appear.
Scariest Episode: The Shadow Man. Though honestly, most here are nearly equally scary. Hat's off to New Dominion Pictures and Timeless Media Group for releasing this excellent documentary ghost series each year on DVD.",1430265600,16,3010,4.8388349514563105
6958645,5,B00S4YGWLA,"I've been a huge fan of this series since the very beginning. I was crushed when it was cancelled but elated when it was brought back. Season Six was great but a tad too short. Season 7 makes up for it in every way. A ton of episodes. All of them exactly what you've come to expect from the series.
Another season I'll watch again and again.

The Five times of interruptions by replaying over and over in each episode just drives me crazy
I hate this DVD set even the story lines seems to be dull...
Unless you have an Utmost Patience to watch over the continuously repeated the same scenes that you just have watched in seconds
on each episode ( Disturbing and extream bothering in between the scenes ) . The screen play editing style just drive me crazy and mad
I can't accept nor understand why they have decided to make it this way.
I am seriously recommend not to buy specially this DVD SET !!!.
I got sick and tired of its routine repeating + their new creation of monsterous make ups which kills the imagination
Season 1 ~ 4 has been excellent but from Season 5 ~ 7 it  gradually got worse and the season 7 is the worst among them
It's done with me by the season 7, I will never buy additional series any more.

8697276,3,B00S4YGWLA,"So I'm going to split this up into two reviews because there is significant difference in quality past Season 5.

Season 1 - 4:  5 Stars
I really liked Seasons 1-  5 because the stories were interesting. The acting was believable and the story telling overall was well paced and pulled you in. The directors had the good sense to keep their low-budget effects to a minimum, choosing to put their scares into great eerie settings and dramatic timing. The only thing that really bothered me about this season was the fact that it occurs to only about two families to go look up the history of their house in the city records. It KILLLED me! They'd be googling the hell (no pun intended) out of paranormal investigators, witchcraft, and exorcisms, but it doesn't occur to them to, I don't know, research the history of their own house?? No fault of the show, of course, if that's how the tale goes, but dang....

Season 6 and beyond: 2/5 Stars
Huge quality drop after season 5. Forget ""a haunting"" they should have renamed the show to ""A possession"" because 95% of the stories in these season are about demons. Sometimes it even starts out as a ghost story and then SURPRISE! It's really a demon! No real explanation for why it's there in a lot of the tales, just ""oh! Bad things happened in this place, so this portal to hell opened up!"" It stopped being scary and started being ridiculous.

But the crap stories paled in comparison to the awful acting, production quality, and straight up horrible B movie special effects. The same basment set is reused at least 5 times and there's really only 15 minutes of content per 45 minute episode thanks to the excessive recaps. The acting is so over-the-top that during the ""scary"" scenes I often started laughing because the really fake crying and screaming was hysterical. Finally, the ""demons"" were all depicted using bad cgi or masks and the only thing horrifying about the ghosts was, once again, the bad acting.

Not sorry I watched it, but I definitely lost interest after season 5.",1519603200,,2031,4.6434540389972145

8697278,5,B00S4YGWLA,This tv series is my favorite cause it's based on true stories and actual accounts of paranormal encounters. I love learning about the world of paranormal and hearing about it and hearing people's encounters and all that. So I'm excited to own a haunting on DVD,1516492800,,261,4.695652173913044
8697279,3,B00S4YGWLA,"I read Wesley Fox' book upon which the episode CHILD'S PLAY is based so of course I wanted to buy the media version. The book is more believable due to depictions of true plausible evidence whereas this HAUNTING episode shows only the conjured ludicrous fairy tale demon. The problem with Fox' book(s) is that he can't write so the potentially good stories are marred with mechanical errors. Strictly from a Hollywood perspective I wondered why Fox' wife, the empath, is shown in CHILD'S PLAY with one eye closed?",1512172800,,513,4.840909090909091
