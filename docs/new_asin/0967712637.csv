7794037,5,0967712637,"It is not often that you see a film about Alaska that focuses strictly on the Wildlife and has no political agenda. In many ways, Alaska's Arctic Wildlife by simply showing you magnificent footage with straight forward narration, makes a powerful statement: It would be a tragedy to allow humans to destroy this precious resource.

It is a testimony to the quality of this film that it has been in rotation on the Discovery Channel, Discovery Science and The Travel Channel since it came out over 10 years ago. I have caught it a few times on TV and find it fresh and exhilarating upon each viewing. I'm happy I purchased a copy for my DVD collection. It's a wonderful show to share with adults and children!",1328486400,2,708,4.574803149606299
7794038,2,0967712637,"I was excited to find this DVD when I searched for Arctic wildlife. However, once I got it I was disappointed to find that it included a lot of stock film spliced into the ""video"" itself. The quality was alternately good and terrible given the fact that it was pretty poorly edited. At least there are some nice facts about breeding grounds and animal behaviour, but on the whole it really isn't worth $20.00.",1165190400,4,409,4.54054054054054
