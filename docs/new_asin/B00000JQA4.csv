7913363,4,B00000JQA4,"I loved this play. This is nothing like ""a movie"" . If you like plays performed entirely on one stage with minimal props ( I adore them) , then you will like  O' Pioneers . It is largely centered around the hardships one family face while trying to eek a living out of the land. The female lead Mary McDonnell gives a strong performance as Alexandra, the eldest child whom the dying father leaves in charge of her three younger brothers. A few musical numbers are performed, none that impelled me to sing along, or that were memorable enough to have me singing or humming them later (or I would have given it 5 stars). As they say ""I laughed, I cried, it moved me"". For me, it was a great play with a firecracker ending. I hope this review helps!!",1362268800,2,747,4.297872340425532
