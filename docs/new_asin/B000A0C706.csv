Plus by buying it you'd be supporting a cult with a background in child abuse and religious prostitution, and much more.
Here's a bit about it: [...]",1457222400,,447,4.743589743589744
8071026,1,B000A0C706,"While these movies and books appeal to contain good Christian moral values the fact of the matter is they are made to support the leaders of the cult formerly known as the Children of God, that changed their name to The Family International. Just like you wouldn't buy clothes you knew were made by child slaves, you won't want to buy these videos knowing that the people who made them are well known pedophiles. And ultimately the people most befitting from the sale of them are the Cult leaders themselves. All this information is well documented and easy to find with a quick google search",1456704000,,592,4.647619047619048
8071027,1,B000A0C706,"Do not buy this product you are supporting pedophiles. This product is made by the group formerly known as the Children of God and later The Family international. Due to a lot of bad press they have separated their branding from the cult but it is still run by members who funnel this money straight to their leader Karen Zerbys pockets. The children from TFI have suffered terrible abuse in their childhood including sexual, physical and mental abuse all which is well documented. Some survivors of  the cult are well known River Phoenix, Joaquin Phoenix, Rose McGowen. Julianna Burring, Taylor Stevens. Some great books you can read about them are Not without my Sister, and The Innocent. Here is a link on the practices and beliefs of the cult. [...]",1456704000,,753,4.792307692307692

8071029,5,B000A0C706,"I just watched The King's Castle with my 12 year old son.  We were both fascinated for the duration of the video.  I would say that the series is aimed at elementary school children, but my son who is in first year of junior high really enjoyed it.  I have already seen the almost magical draw of this series for the one to four year old set. It is important to note that the series is clearly Christian, and deals with Christian topics, although in a fun way, and not aggressively or in a pushy way.  It is not denominational.

This episode deals with building a relationship with Jesus, and letting Him clean the inside of the ""cup"", rather than us trying to be good in our own strength.  The King's Castle is your heart, which we are encouraged to let Jesus live and reign in.

I found it delightful, and honestly, I was a bit surprised how much I enjoyed it.  I'm not an afficianado of children's programing, although I tend to be tolerant.  I was not expecting to sit and watch it through, but it put a smile on my face, and I didn't want to turn it off.",1148083200,2,1059,4.2288557213930345
