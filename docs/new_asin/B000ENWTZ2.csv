Knowing all of the actors, I never thought they can pull of such a moving film that WILL change your mind about life and the consequences of life. This movie is a must-see and when you do see it, it will change your whole perspective and will have those who can relate wishing they had a second chance. Overall, great movie!!!",1142380800,,442,4.273809523809524
