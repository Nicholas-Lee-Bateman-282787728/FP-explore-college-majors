8717879,5,B00YAZNDD2,"At first, I was going to say that music is the glue that holds together this wonderful multi-faceted glimpse of urban renewal in Muncie, Indiana. And the music is glorious -- jazz, soul, rock, performed by Dr. John Peterson and his wonderful band. But as you watch Peterson lead the musicians from his keyboard, then reminisce about the early vision for Doc's Music Hall, and his own history of uniting the Eastern and Western streams of medicine, you realize --the glue is actually John Peterson himself.

I'd like to think that this well-produced documentary film will not only delight fans of the music, but also demonstrate the value of stepping out in faith to participate concretely in restoring the heart of our cities. Maybe someone will see what Peterson did in Muncie and say, ""This is something I could do, too."" There's no doubt in my mind that, even after the closing of Doc's Music Hall, the city of Muncie is a better place. (And no need to stay in past tense: both the doctor and the band are active to this day!)

Many thanks to Robert Mugge, who has done about as much as any single filmmaker to document the lively, urgent, endlessly fascinating world of blues and jazz music. For decades he's been creating these excellent documentaries (some of which can be previewed on his Vimeo channel). I'm glad his time at Ball State University made it possible for him to include Doc's Music Hall and John Peterson in this stream of history.

Disclosure: I know John Peterson and his family and have enjoyed his band's music several times over the years.
