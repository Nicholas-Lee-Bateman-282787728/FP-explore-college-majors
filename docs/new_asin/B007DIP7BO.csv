5079107,4,B007DIP7BO,"Baby Boomers will obviously drool over the considerable youthful talent from a number of artists featured on this video, who later became household names (either as sole artists or band members) that changed our taste in music. The transformation of lifestyle and social concerns that swept the world during this time is captured almost unintentionally on these video clips. Any fan of 60's & 70's music would do well to view this historic chronicle of some of music's greatest song writers and performers.",1336435200,27,506,5.108433734939759

5079123,5,B007DIP7BO,"I am a child of the 50's - 60s and loved this music. I was thrilled when I found this release. So many from those days appear. My favorite the Chad Mitchel Trio among them. This set lets you re-live the days of campus concerts, life in New York's Greenwich Village. My only faulting is that there isn't enough time or disc space for even more of those wonderful performers and groups of the American Folk Music movement. Back ""in the day"" these people were the touchstones of American conscience and help start a discourse that  helped change the American Cultural landscape of the 60's forever.",1368835200,24,595,4.613207547169812
5079124,4,B007DIP7BO,The video was a truly wonderful recast of the early days of folk music in the 50's-60's.  Watching the music grow up in the Village and seeing clips of original performances was wonderful.. The contrast between old clips and current commentsry was very informative.,1368144000,10,265,5.0227272727272725

This DVD lets us see again the youthful faces of the folk singers who sang the folk songs that most of us remember. Thankfully these performances were filmed and not just  recorded as audio records. This TIME-LIFE collection contains seventeen hit recordings, plus two throwaway songs by Peter Yarrow (Deep Blue Sea), and John Cohen (Black Jack Daisy), and an hour or so of interviews with John Cohen, Don McLean, Maria Muldaur, Tom Paxton, Michelle Phillips, John Sebastian, and Peter Yarrow.  These trivia interviews are rather yawn producing, and are best handled by viewing them between coffee breaks to keep you from dozing off. Some of the songs are closer to rock than folk, but all the songs on the main part of the DVD are hits, not misses.  Starting with ""If I Had A Hammer"", by Peter Paul and Mary, and ending with ""California Dreamin'"", by The Mamas & The Papas, the great folk songs just keep on coming. I kept wishing that the hit songs on the main part of the DVD would never end. There is a lot more song material out there that could have been included. This DVD only scratched the surface of what could have been a multiple DVD collection.",1366934400,22,1194,4.617924528301887

8514978,5,B007DIP7BO,"The time when people listened to and enjoyed folk music was a great time. It was a time when there was no strife in the US as there is today, when political parties disagreed, but could work together.
Folk music was a pleasure to listen to and it is still pleasant to rehear it. It has great lines that encourage friendly feelings:
Let the midnight special shine its ever loving light on me.
In Gods eyes we are all the same.
Dont call me names.
Try to rekindle the patriots dream.
Where have all the flowers gone?
Oh, when will they ever learn?",1502582400,,545,4.300970873786408

8514985,3,B007DIP7BO,"This video is astonishingly good considering its failure to include one of the 2 or 3 most important personalities of the Folk Movement, namely Dave Van Ronk, ""The Mayor of MacDougal Street.""  Bob Dylan, I'm sure, would agree about his friend Dave's status. But wait!  Dave isn't actually omitted. The prominence of his absence must have been noticed toward the end. Anyway, a few third-rate seconds of Van Ronk were then installed.  I docked the video one or two stars for its Van Ronk bungle. You, however, may not care as much as I did.",1438646400,5,539,4.652631578947369
