8157488,5,B000KJTCDM,A great movie about the life of Jerome Kern. I consider Jerome Kern one of the great songwriters and composer of music for  broadway shows.,1509494400,,139,4.56
8157489,3,B000KJTCDM,"Movie musicals were guaranteed box-office during the golden age of Hollywood, but they often had trouble figuring ways to squeeze as many song hits as they could into a show, so the studios started doing all-star biographies to the great composers of the American songbook. Usually the stories were ridiculous and invented (since the composers were either living or their songs were still held in copyright by their surviving relatives), but you could often bet on a real show-stopper or two in every one of them: Gene Kelly and Vera-Ellen dancing to ""Slaughter on Tenth Avenue"" in the Rodgers and Hart biopic WORDS AND MUSIC for example, or Arlene Dahl's unforgettable ""I Love You So Much"" in THREE LITTLE WORDS. TILL THE CLOUDS ROLL BY, MGM's salute to Jerome Kern, is one of the most opulent in this genre, and also one of the silliest. The real Kern insisted his life had almost no incident in it (he grew up in a well-to-do family, had a very solid musical education, and adored his wife) so the studio had to invent conflict by inventing for Kern (here played by Robert Walker) an arranger and friend and taskmaster; since this latter character is wholly imaginary, the studio had the inspired idea of casting Van Heflin in the part who looks very much like Walker (and thus could convincingly be his alter ego). But the story is as dull as dishwater, involving Heflin's daughter (Lucille Bremer) becoming stagestruck.

The thing to do, of course, is to skip right through to the musical numbers, and though they're not as memorable as they could be (they're often undercut by the wondrously kitschy sets and stagings), they're for the most part beautifully sung. Judy Garland plays the great 20s star Marilyn Miller and gets to sing ""Who?"" in lovely voice on what seems to be a magic escalator; Lena Horne gets to play Julie Laverne in SHOW BOAT (something she was denied the opportunity of doing in the three film versions of that show) and sing ""Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man""; Dinah Shore sings ""The Last Time I saw Paris"" and, more memorably, ""They Didn't Believe Me."" The high point, oddly enough, is June Allyson spunkily singing the title number of LEAVE IT TO JANE with a full chorus. Kern's songs are probably the most musically sophisticated of all the great American songbook composers, so even just getting to hear them sung well is a treat, though the kitschiness is a bit over the top. Since Kern died during the making of the film the studio decided to cinch the hagiographic aspects of the show by creating a framing narrative set in heaven with Kern looking on; by the end of the film his numbers are all performed in the celestial sphere, with the performers wearing all-white formal wear standing on giant fluted columns that look like Italian wedding cakes.

This DVD went out of copyright, so be prepared that the variant versions differ greatly with regard to sound and picture quality. The one I viewed was the ""official"" version from warner Video, and includes a lovely extra of Kathryn Grayson and Johnny Johnston performing two of the most sumptuous songs Kern ever wrote from his operetta MUSIC IN THE AIR, ""Ev'ry Little Star"" and ""The Song is You."" Although Grayson has been much hated by later audiences for her sugary trilling (in full evidence, sadly, at the end of ""The Song is You""), and she wears the silliest white lace mantilla you've ever seen (it looks like a square doily), she gets to show with her tender rendition of the intro and main verse of ""Ev'ry Little Star"" something of why audiences liked her so much in the Forties and early Fifties.",1217462400,4,3588,4.720893141945774
