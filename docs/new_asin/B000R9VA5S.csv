8199856,5,B000R9VA5S,Very few stretch dvd's - Cathe does a great job.  Clear directions and explanations  I would purchase any other dvd's she has made.,1368316800,,131,4.6521739130434785
8199857,5,B000R9VA5S,I love this dvd. I have a hurt back and it helps me to streach my back and all of my body out!,1353888000,,94,3.130434782608696
8199858,5,B000R9VA5S,"This DVD is a great addition to my workout library. I only have a few full stretch workouts and I have done them so many times that I was desperately searching for something new and different. This is my first Cathe DVD, and I was pleased to find that Cathe's stretching style has  fluid moves and long lines that are reminiscent of DVD's from Kari Anderson and Ellen Barrett.

The moves are well modeled and the transitions very smooth. Consequently, I had that rare experience of doing the first two segments (41 minutes) straight through the first time and feeling just as comfortable with the moves as I would normally feel after several run-throughs.

I have done many workouts on the stability ball, but this is the first DVD I've found that uses the ball  for stretching only. The moves are not awkward or forced, as they are in some pilates or yoga-on-the-ball DVD's.

This DVD is easy to follow and well-paced. Cathe's voice and the music are both pleasant and not distracting or overbearing. All in all, I am delighted with the DVD and expect to use it often.",1300492800,,1069,4.605263157894737
8199859,5,B000R9VA5S,"I am not one to make myself stretch on my own. I bought this DVD in the hopes that this would make the process enjoyable for me, and it did that. I don't use it as much as I'd hoped, but I feel it's a product that I will go back to quite a bit over the years.",1270598400,,259,3.4827586206896552
8199860,5,B000R9VA5S,"I've had this dvd for over a year and I've noticed improved flexibility.  I started out with some full yoga dvd's but my flexibility was so horrible, I'd become frustrated and just give up.  I wanted something that was more of an athletic type dvd and short enought that I would see it through.  This worked for me.

The music is very relaxing and you have 3 options to choose from.  If you don't have a stability ball, or stretchy band, no problem, start with segment number 1 where no equipment is required.  If you have the aditional equipment, then you have more options.

I did not notice any distracting glaring that Cathe did but then, I am so intune with my own workout, I really just glance at the tv to see the move being done.

Since doing this DVD, I am a little more flexible and can stick with my true yoga dvd's a little longer.  Highly recommend!",1216512000,7,862,4.3375
8199861,5,B000R9VA5S,"This is a necessary tool at the end of some long days.  I find it to be relaxing and enjoyable and so nice to do.  You may not get into each stretch fully the first time around, but the more often you do it, you actually find yourself going futher than the last time and progressing well if done often enough.  Your flexibility really improoves.
The first workout is done on the floor, the next is on a stability ball and the last uses dyna bands which you can easily find in stores or come with some dvds.  You'll lengthen and stretch almost every muscle you have, and it's definately a workout you can do later at night (where some aerobic ones might keep you awake a little - this is great before bed).  Cathe is a great instructor and talks you through it easily enough so you don't always have to turn to look at the tv.  I enjoy it and hope you'll try it too.",1209945600,8,865,4.149700598802395
8199862,4,B000R9VA5S,"This video is so not what I'd expect from a Cathe Friedrich video!  The workouts are good as far as stretching goes and there are three different programs- one without additional equipment, one that requires a stability ball, and one for a resistance band.  This video should be done after a cardio session or if you simply want to do some stretching on your ""day off.""",1208563200,7,369,4.575757575757576
