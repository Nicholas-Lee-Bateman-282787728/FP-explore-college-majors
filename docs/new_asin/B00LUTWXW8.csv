8668281,5,B00LUTWXW8,"This is a nice reminder of what good clean entertainment used to be about. Dinah Shore is a treasure as she sings with her guests. I especially enjoyed seeing Gwen Verdon, as I've always loved Damn Yankees. Dinah definitely had a classy variety show.",1413417600,5,250,4.704545454545454
8668282,1,B00LUTWXW8,Awful Quality. I expected more from a legit disc. I don't like to give bad reviews but I felt I had a responsibility to others who might want to buy this dvd. Save your money unless you are desperate to have this Dinah Shore Show. Pass it by,1413331200,6,241,4.041666666666667
