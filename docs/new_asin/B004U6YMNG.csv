8441287,3,B004U6YMNG,it's ok but not very good quality.,1438214400,,34,4.0
8441288,5,B004U6YMNG,"Love this band !!! only 2 songs...but Great.
Don't expect high def picture, you won't see it, it is 1971.
For the full experience of this bands talent and songwriting at that
time in historical rock, I recommend  purchasing the metamorphosis cd,
you will love it, been one of my favorites for over 40 years.",1382918400,5,307,4.581818181818182
8441289,4,B004U6YMNG,I was expecting this to be a full concert but was disappointed when it was only 2 songs. The quality is good for its age and I know there is very little video of Iron Butterfly on stage so this makes an interesting historical document.,1376784000,6,235,4.2444444444444445
8441290,5,B004U6YMNG,This is a great recording of Iron Butterfly live during the Mike Pinera era.  Too bad it was not longer-only 4 tracks.  The band is jamming on every track which makes it interesting.  too bad it is so short but get it anyway.,1375142400,5,225,4.186046511627907
8441291,4,B004U6YMNG,"If there's any problem with this DVD it's that there isn't more to it, but since Iron Butterly isn't one of those bands that there is a wealth of old footage for, it makes it all the more valuable. Today's audience might find some of the bands moments here rather ""Spinal Tap"" but personally I eat this stuff up; more dated psychedelic effects and voice box playing please! That aside, it's just cool to see this band as they looked at the time supporting a great album. I'd love to see a proper retrospect for these guys come out some day but at least there's this.

On a related note, I saw no way to report this to Amazon but the editorial for this product is not for this product at all but appears to be for a Richie Havens concert.",1334361600,17,737,4.226950354609929
8441292,4,B004U6YMNG,"I ordered this item with the understanding it is a audio compact disc.  Turns out not to be the case.  This is a DVD.  It contains the Iron Butterfly performance on the German TV show ""Beat Club"" from early 1971.  The personnel and song selections are the same as on the group's 5th album ""Metamorphosis"".  These same performances were included on the Iron Butterfly video cassette released by the Rhino label in the 1990s.  This is a NTSC region-free DVD.  It is a high quality item and appears to be licensed from the content's owner.  Since it turned out to be a DVD it is actually more than I anticipated.",1320710400,25,609,4.472727272727273
