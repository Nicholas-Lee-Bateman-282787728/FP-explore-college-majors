5179628,4,B008RNYMM4,"Warner Archive continues in releasing rare Euro action titles from the sixties this time with actor Rod Taylor as Sir Francis Drake wielding his sword and attitude in Director Rudolph Mate's 'SEVEN SEAS TO CALAIS' aka 'IL DOMINATORE DEI SETTE MARI'- 1962.  Co directed by Primo Zeglio, it seems to be a British Italian co-production with a nice mix of genre actors.  Joining Taylor is an early film appearance from future Henry VIII actor Keith Michell, the gorgeous Edy Vessal, future Spaghetti Western icon Terence Hill, the great character actor Anthony Dawson, the lethal femininity of Irene Worth as Queen Elizabeth I and slimy Arturo Dominici.  Taylor gets captured by the Spanish traveling in the New World for stealing gold and quickly escapes back to England finding spies everywhere in plots to assassinate the Queen.  Treachery and sword fights ensue and Director Mate who's career touched many genres including his wonderful Marlene Dietrich vehicle from the forties 'THE FLAME OF NEW ORLEANS' moves the film beautifully with slick photography from Giulio Gianini and a rousing score from Franco Mannino making this an entertaining time waster.  Taylor looks great with a sword and the action scenes on board ship make the film look more expensive than it probably was.  The DVD-R transfer from Warner Archive looks great also with bright colors in its 2.35 aspect ratio with no extras.  So sharpen your sabers and prepare for a hell of a good time on the seven seas in this great sixties Euro title.",1348099200,14,1512,5.0

This is not your typical swashbuckler as I can't compare Rod Taylor with Errol Flynn, Tyrone Power, Cornel Wilde, and others although he did a good job as Sir Francis Drake. Elizabeth the queen was an excellent character.",1417305600,2,321,4.732142857142857

fighting I enjoyed.  The costumes representing this time were very detailed.",1379116800,2,212,4.861111111111111
8530088,5,B008RNYMM4,This is another must have for all Rod Taylor fans. He is just so handsome in this & some of the stunts that he does are wonderful. The entire movie is wonderful & I have now watched it several times. I love it so much I hope I don't wear out the DVD!!!,1373673600,3,252,3.7735849056603774

8530091,5,B008RNYMM4,"Finally...... this epic rears it's salty head, another title I have been waiting for. NOW......If we could only get Morgan the Pirate and Thief of Bagdad in Widescreen,I would die very happy, still, this is a step in the right direction that's for sure. At this stage, I can't comment on this title as I have yet to see it, but I can't wait. I have now received this DVD and the print is very clear and has excellent sound.the final sea battle is a bit hokey and the ships are obviously all models, but still an interesting movie.",1351641600,,530,4.363636363636363
8530092,4,B008RNYMM4,"""Seven Seas to Calais"" is among the very best of the ""spaghetti swashbucklers"", second only to ""Swordsman of Siena"", in my opinion. Its Italian production and international cast is greatly strengthened by the presence of Australians Rod Taylor as Sir Francis Drake and Keith Michell as Malcolm Marsh, with American Irene Worth as a delightful Queen Elizabeth.

The film opens with a rousing chase through the streets of Plymouth, England, leading to a thrilling sword fight among the skeletons of the ships under construction at the wharf. Unlike other spaghetti swashbucklers, the pacing doesn't flag too badly, though ""Seven Seas to Calais"" is overlong at 102 minutes.

Still, with its exciting action set pieces, beautiful costumes and period setting, capable leads, sense of humor, and a good (if not great) story, this is confidently recommended for aficionados of swashbucklers and period dramas.",1350604800,12,902,5.345070422535211
