2675682,5,B000JLQQ58,I loved the pilot. Hope there is more soon. This show stars Jennifer Beals. I was surprised by that. The description for the show lists different actors as the star. Must be an oops by amazon. The show is interesting and hooked me right away.,1433980800,2,242,4.4
2675683,5,B000JLQQ58,"A great beginning, but I hope it will deal with the physics behind those of us who know that most likely, our universe, 13.77 billion years ago, came into existence from nothing, nothing at all.

Perhaps in 12,000 BC, the Egypitans had it right with their first mythological god Atum, who created himself from nothing! The PROOF that Tyler and Turing seek, is there from the start if they could only realize that: ""None of this means anything."" Which, interestingly enough, is lesson one from A Course in Miracles which goes on to say that ""Those who are certain of the outcome, can afford to wait, and wait without anxiety."" This series, if we play close attention, will do just that. I admit, in episode 1, the Latin utterances went right by me. I caught it on the second viewing:

""AVE MARIA, MATER DEI, ORA PRO NOBIS PECCATORIBUS
NUNC, ET IN HORA MORTIS NOSTRAE. AMEN.""

I'm anxious to see this series develop a modicum of cosmology and cosmogony to further develop these concepts and to take us skillfully deeper, down to the explanation of every thing and if there is any meaning to anything other than what we experience while in the ""moment.""

With that said, I'll wager that the final episode has to be titled ""The Beginning"" and I will eagerly watch all over again as it is fact: we do live, die, and repeat.

Thank you and have a nice day!

2675686,5,B000JLQQ58,"I bought this series on a whim and by the time I finished, I was back on Amazon to order series 2.  The main character is a discredited reporter.  He has sacrificed his marriage, his relationship with his young daughter, and with his sister is search of the next headline. After losing a libel suit (and his job), he gets a job as a reporter for a third rate shopping newspaper. He hears about a young boy who was killed and decides to investigate it.  He is intrigued about the story after interviewing the victim's distrought parents.  Eventually the story brings him in contact with a woman seeking her sister who has been kidnapped to serve in the illegal immigrant prostitution trade in Ireland. How these two incidents are conjoined and where they lead, brings true suspense.
  The benefit of a mini-series is that it allows for strong character development but the plot has to remain tightly controlled because of time restraints. This is a very good series and I highly recommend it.",1263859200,8,991,4.699421965317919

she's hot. (That ""Flashdance"" scene where she reaches between her knees and
unhooks her bra is still indelibly imprinted on my mind -- even after all these years.
LOL.)

So I really wanted to like JB's new TV series, ""Proof,""  but I couldn't make it
past the first three episodes. Because this new TV series suffers from the
same type of unlikeable character that I complained about in my review of
Megan Good's new TV series, ""Minority Report.""  (But other than that, both
TV series would probably be enjoyable TV shows.)

I downgraded ""Proof"" and ""Minority Report""  to 2-Stars (rather than 1-Star)
because the unlikeable images make those shows offensive but ineligible for
my Hollywood Shuffle nomination.  LOL.

That it involves a somewhat metaphysical subject is a welcome bonus. I'm always on board for mysteries with a paranormal/supernatural core. Proof gets additional points for it not being the usual horror/thriller show with the villainous antagonist.

Well done. I still have more to watch and am enjoying it immensely.

2676310,5,B000JLQQ58,"Unlike many other series I've tired to become a fan of ""Proof"" did not disappoint.  I could feel this one lighting up my brain. It actually has a theme that it sticks to, that of life after death. It touches on science, spirituality, the impact of inconsolable grief, the meaning of life after death, and the impact of near-death experiences. Jennifer Beals, one of my three fav actresses since The L Word,  just keeps getting better and better; she owns Dr. Tyler like she owned Bette. And  Mathew Modine is her match - the two of them alone could handle the great dialogue, the increasingly complex plot developments and make science jargon sound like coffeklatch chat.  There's also an unusual investment in the 'minor' characters - we're all falling in love with the intern from Kenya played by Edi Gathegi, his girlfriend Halima, and his NDE co-researher.  The series reminds me of Frazier - you feel smarter for having watched and understood it. Kudos to whoever's writing this one - it reminds me of the complexity of ""Sense8"" - you have to think about what's being revealed to you, episode by episode, and how it all ties together. My only recommendation is to not be afraid to include more science - it would be a nice balance to the blurring lines between the here and now, and the possibility of the beyond.",1439337600,4,1318,4.663793103448276

2676672,5,B000JLQQ58,"This is another amazing new show. Again, I was hesitant to watch because most of these programs that deal with life/death/afterlife are so very schlocky at best, at least in my estimation. Furthermore, I seldom watch hospital programs. But, Jennifer Beals has always been one of my favorite actresses. She is marvelous in this show. I love the fact that the lead is a strong, intelligent, single-minded woman who is far from perfect. The rest of the cast is great, too. It is well worth the time I devote to watching it. Oh, even more important, there is no religious overkill.",1437436800,,577,4.7227722772277225

2676674,2,B000JLQQ58,The season started out great but by episode 3 it diverted off of the fascinating question of life after death to a portrayal of a gratuitous sexual encounter and the reincarnation of a gay couple.

2676728,5,B000JLQQ58,Proof is a show that looks to solve and or make the audience more visible to the possibility of our destiny after death by looking at evidential patient records and following on interviews with them. All this to try to seek an understanding or rather generating an explanation of such mystery. All this starts when Ivan Turing (played by Matthew Modine) has terminal cancer and is in need of knowing what happens after death; to solve this he contacts well acclaimed surgeon Cartherine Tyler(played by Jennifer Beals) and therefore work together. The question here is: will well science background Dr. Tyler be able to change perspective and believe in something else? Totally recommend the show!,1437177600,,696,5.060869565217391

2676813,4,B000JLQQ58,"Seems like it's starting out pretty well. Acting is fair to good. A little improbable that a busy surgeon would get involved in finding proof of life after death (not sure how one gets, or even defines what, evidence that would convince a scientist), regardless of the donation the hospital will get. At least it's a bit of a different story than so many doctors, cops, and lawyers shows the networks never seem to tire of churning out. This could go south with stupid, suspense plots (military interest, a cult, the undead, some adversarial unnecessary element), or be a winner.

As the lead character, surgeon Carolyn Tyler, M.D. (Jennifer Beals) wrestles with the grief surrounding the loss of her son, and its impact on her family, she receives a request to study the nature of life after death when she meets a billionaire inventor (Matthew Modine) who is dying of cancer.  Although skeptical, Dr. Tyler finds herself more and more intrigued as she is confronted with the possibility that there is more to this life than what we call physical reality.  This show does an excellent job of portraying the grief of the family, and the developing awareness that life continues after death; without being creepy, frightening or sensational.

2676849,5,B000JLQQ58,"i believe ""Proof"" has the potential to be a winner for executive producer Kyra Sedgewick. Regardless of personal viewpoints on the subject of life after death, it is definitely something that all of humanity thinks about. And, when we add in the talent and camera appeal of Jennifer Bealls then I believe it has true multi-season survivability promise. One other point, and I believe it's a huge one: ""Proof"" is a totally new and different concept in dramas. Let's see how the writing holds up. For now, I highly recommend it.

2677152,1,B000JLQQ58,"Really? That's the purpose of this show, to scientifically denounce BELIEF in God by showing all these wonders of modern medicine? It's called a ""medical practice"" for a reason: they've figured basically NOTHING out for certain and for good reason -- not everyone is the same. Yet here we have the medical ""profession"" placed on the pedestal yet again in somehow trying to prove an afterlife. You've got to be kidding me.

There's a very good reason why searching for a sign is pure folly and it goes far beyond the worship of the knowledge of doctors.
Matthew 16:4 states ""A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed.""

So why will there be no ""sign"" despite so many people today demanding to see one before they will believe in God? Could it possibly have something to do with prophets such as Noah, Moses, Samuel, Jonas and God made flesh -- Jesus Christ Himself -- being combated against and disregarded by the majority of the people and/or the politically-powerful of their day when they walked the earth? If your faith is that weak that you demand a ""sign"" or you need a ""sign"" to justify your faith, then it's time to reexamine the strength of your faith. And unfortunately, this show is bound to be nothing more than a scientific bent on your faith in God. In other words, the show seeks to get you to question and ultimately reject your faith in God. Thanks hollowwood, but I don't need to be further conditioned by you people.",1434931200,2,1557,4.577060931899641

  Thought it was getting funking and I was going to say stop watching until the very end of eps. 8. I'm glad I came back for one more try: now, I'll be here at least 'till the end of this the season.",1434672000,,535,4.018867924528302
2677166,4,B000JLQQ58,"This show has a promising opening. Jennifer Beals is well cast as the surgeon who is going to investigate the life after death phenomenon for a wealthy patron (Matthew Modine). If one thinks her obnoxious, she is supposed to be as a very exacting surgeon with impossibly high standards. What other kind of surgeon does one want? I certainly don't want a laid back one.

I think this cast is up to the task so how successful it becomes will depend on the screenplays for each week. It would be very easy to make this sappy with the wrong scripts. The ""X Files"" pulled this off as did the British ""Afterlife"". Both had excellent screenplays week after week though, many written and directed by no less than Vince Gilligan (""Breaking Bad"" and ""Better Call Saul"").

Joe Morton plays the hospital head and he is fine as usual. Beals also has a husband doctor from whom she is separated and a daughter who ping pongs between parents. The daughter has behavior issues. I think the father and daughter may be the weakest parts so far. Far superior to these two is the role of an African male intern who becomes Beals' assistant for the afterlife work. He is enormously promising and I would be really surprised if he doesn't take hold in a major way. If Beals is Mulder, he is Scullly. Finally, Beals has a dead teenage son. We have only seen him in home videos and still photographs but I surmise he will have a role in this. I would frankly expect he would have a better role than the daughter's and father's.

Each week we also have patients who may live or die and Beals may experience that transitional state with them since an accident left her with some extrasensory ability. This week we had a little girl and a young man. I expect this will shift each week. Beals' patients are all in extremis so many of them do die. She is ideally situated for this new role.

So it is promising but i await more episodes to make sure the screenwriters are up to the task of doing this well week after week.",1434585600,2,1993,4.422343324250681
2677167,5,B000JLQQ58,"Great new approach to an ancient subject.  I love the skepticism with which these subjects are being explored; it fits the times.  The writing is great; so is the acting and directing and cinematography. There exist so many subjects and stories this show can explore in an intelligent and rational way -- subjects that aren't necessarily rational but haunt most of us -- but it's the skepticism that makes this intriguing. We're not expected to just ""buy"" these stories and beliefs; we're invited to explore these subjects, along with the characters in this show. I believe this series will speak to the hearts of most people, but especially those who have lost a loved one to death. I'm also interested in the individual subjects -- including reincarnation, where some fascinating events have occurred in the United States lending credibility to it as an ""actual thing.""  Bravo, all around, to TNT for it's current offering of excellent shows.",1434585600,2,944,5.0
2677168,5,B000JLQQ58,"The pilot: You are introduced to the not so personable Dr. Tyler. Her teenage son passed away, she split with her husband and now her daughter is getting into trouble at school. She is expecting a lecture or disciplinary action when she is summoned to see her boss at the hospital. Dr. Tyler preformed an unsanctioned procedure on a patient that died in the O.R. Instead she learns that a mysterious billionaire is offering funds in exchange for her research. Research? Well he wants proof that there is, or is not, life after death. Interesting.

""Proof"" is the best pilot so far this year. This one is a great introduction to the premise, the environment and the characters. A lot of pilots leaving me going, ""Well, this may or may not be okay. I will watch a few to get a feel for what's going on here."" Not this one. I think you can make up your mind quick because the presentation is that good. They didn't spend a whole lot of time dwelling on one portion of the show. Some first episodes are almost entirely spent on explaining the characters or the history of the plot and this one didn't. It was a good ""overview.""

Dr. Taylor is going to chase down cases that have any potential clues about our existence after death. She uses science and medicine to rule out or determine reasons for these ""experiences"" people have had while close to, or at, the point of death. She also interviews them and anyone (friends, family) who may be able to offer more insight. The first case is indeed in the pilot and it was pretty neat.

Overall it feels like an X-Files meets medicine television series, with a focus on the afterlife instead of aliens. The pilot was great because I think it gave me a lot of information on what to expect from the show.",1434585600,14,1746,4.467084639498433
2677169,4,B000JLQQ58,"It differs enough from Greys, Fringe, Royal Pains and Touched by Angel to be intriguing and feel fresh.  The characters and dialogue seem fresh too, and the leads are likable, Jennifer Beals, Matthew Modine, Joe Morton and David Sutcliffe are all longtime faves.  Edi Gathegi is charming as the young intern.  Visually it's strikingly modern with cool settings and architecture.
It's plenty cerebral with enough jolts of magical realism to keep the viewer engaged in the hunt for answers about the afterlife, and thanks to a good mix of hard science and modern occultism it offers plenty for believers and skeptics alike.",1434499200,12,621,5.068627450980392
2677170,4,B000JLQQ58,"I found the pilot episode intriguing -- I do not always like shows that focus on life after death themes, but the scientific skeptic (Beals) versus believer -- or at least open-minded (Modine) is a great formula reminiscent of Mulder versus Scully. So, I will continue to give this show a chance.
However, after reading some of the other reviews, I wanted to make something of a defense of Jennifer Beals, with a recommendation. While the other reviewers were complimentary about her performance, many expressed surprise to see her -- I think the implication was that it was surprising either to see her in something good or to see her in anything at all, thinking she has not done anything since her intense, if relatively brief, Flashdance fame. I might have been similarly surprised to see her again myself  if I had not seen the short-lived but excellent  police drama ""The Chicago Code,"" with Jason Clarke and Delroy Lindo, which sadly aired for only one season on Fox in 2011. I absolutely loved the The Chicago Code, and was surprised to see Beals in that show the way some reviewers were surprised to see her in Proof.
However, I strongly recommend The Chicago Code, which is available from Amazon Prime. Beals plays a new chief of police in Chicago, Jason Clarke plays her very Irish former partner who is one of the cops in her jurisdiction. Delroy Lindo plays a slimly, corrupt Alderman of a district in Chicago who, if memory serves, had Beals installed as the new chief because he believed her inexperience and political naivet&eacute; would make her easy to control. He turns out to be wrong, as Beals and Clark team up to bring him down -- along with other elements of the politically corrupt criminal justice system in Chicago. I watched every episode of this show faithfully when it was on Fox, and it was so good I was surprised and dismayed to learn that it had been canceled after only the one season, as too frequently happens with good, meaty dramas. Because Beals is so excellent in The Chicago Code, I was much less surprised to see her acting in this new show -- while Flashdance was all good fun in the '80's, Beals is definitely a much more mature actor at this stage of her career. She is just as effective and compelling in this new show. She won me over in the Chicago Code, and it was largely on the strength of her performance in that show that I decided to give Proof a chance. I'm glad I did, and if any of you enjoy her performance in Proof, I cannot recommend The Chicago Code more highly.",1434412800,,2525,4.559471365638767
2677171,5,B000JLQQ58,"Good pilot. Interesting topic regarding proof of life after death..I would like to see what evolves in the season. The acting is good,  however, characters are a bit wooden or formulaic but a pilot rarely does the characters full justice until we see the development in the plot.",1434412800,,279,4.8125
2677172,5,B000JLQQ58,"Of course I give this five stars because 1) in the first few mins they show J. Beals doing one of my fav things (go girl! I had no idea she was a runner!) 2) it takes an old mystery -I LOVE mysteries!- and builds an ENTIRE show around it! I LOVE it! Great talent feat, I am so glad to see them all back on the T&V! The directing seems well done - no unnecessary close ups on Beals but while running. Makeup is perfect, not overdone to make Beals or any of the actors look younger than they are and THANK GOD no one had on that hideous bright pink lipstick everyone is trying to wear now! Good Lord, who told these women that that looked good?! Anyway, back to the show - dialogue seemed well written, natural progression in story and seemed to flow very well. Characters and actors seem the perfect fit -good casting. On screen no underlying tension. I am eagerly awaiting next epi's not sure yet if I will buy the whole season or not since there are soooo many shows I want to see -Penny Dreadful S2, Powers, Angie Tribeca, CSI Cyber, etc.",1434240000,5,1040,4.205

2677176,2,B000JLQQ58,"Ouch. It hurt to leave only two stars. If the truth be told I probably should have left one. What happened, Jennifer? Her string of TV ""wins"" over the past decade had me so excited for this show. At first, I passed the bad acting off to lousy writers, but come on. That just doesn't fly for long. The only actor that was able to rise above this horrid script was Joe Morton -- but he's always amazing.

Jennifer, what happened? WHY? You are so much better than this. One of my favorite actresses all of a sudden bombs out and I am flailing for excuses for her. Yet, she seems to fit right in with the rest of this abominable cast. HORRID acting. HORRID writing. And such a promising subject.",1433980800,,691,4.2748091603053435
