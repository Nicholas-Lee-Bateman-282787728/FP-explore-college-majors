THE DANCING WAS TERIFFIC
REALLY LIKE THE GRADUATION PERFORMANCE WAS OUTSTANDING
I BOUGHT THE MOVIE JUST FOR THAT ONE SCENE",1444176000,,155,4.7407407407407405

1365967,4,B00004WMDT,"This movie is super cheesy but it makes me happy.  I used to dance in high school and sometimes I still miss it.  This is a PG movie about some silly young kids who also happen to be great dancers, so just go with it.  Zoe Saldana is the best!  I love the choreography in Cooper's ballet, even though he is the cheesiest part about this movie.  Laugh and enjoy.",1436745600,,361,4.1

1365970,5,B00004WMDT,"I love the character development in this movie, the passion they all bring to dancing. I love how the choreography tells a story. I love the romance scenes.

I know the hero couple is supposed to be Jody and Charlie but my favorite couple is Maureen and Jim. I just love how much she learns and grows by being with him and how he supports her.

Of course, my absolute favorite part is the end when Jody and Co perform the last ballet. I put on the movie and Michael Jackson's The Way You Make Me Feel immediately is in my head. I'm dancing and singing and can't wait for that scene.

It's one of those movies you need in your collection. For when you wanna watch a little dance, a little romance, when you're down and need a little pick me up, when you're in a good mood and wanna feel even better, perfect for a girl's night or when you're alone.

1365975,5,B00004WMDT,"Not so great movie for dance nerds. If you like to dance enough, you'll enjoy the dancing and the ""back stage"" glimpses. None of the acting is sterling, particularly the girl who plays the lead. It's fun, if this is your kind of fun. It certainly is not ""The Turning Point"" as neither Shirley McClaine or Ann Bancraft showed up and though the male dancers are good, none of them is Baryshnikov. But then, who is?",1423785600,,412,4.434210526315789

1365980,3,B00004WMDT,"OK, here's the deal. I know this is a very typical ""teen ballet (fill in gymnast, athlete, singer, aspirer-er, whatevah!) movie, but come on, it's fun! Besides, Zoe Saldana is always amazing to watch, right? Not many surprises in this, obviously sappy moments, relationships, plot, etc. But I still liked it.  Let's say it's a four-star movie, for a teen flick - but it's actually three (at best).  ;)",1409270400,,401,4.797101449275362

1365985,4,B00004WMDT,"I have been watching this movie for years. Sure, it's predictable and the acting is not-so-hot, but the dance scenes are worth a watch. There's one in particular that always makes this fat girl feel like working out...while it's playing...it only makes me want to work out while it's playing. So, when I watch it, I dress in clothes that would be uncomfortable to workout in. The final dance scene is about 15 minutes long; it's a little corny but very enjoyable.",1404000000,,463,4.658536585365853
1365986,3,B00004WMDT,"If you like dance, this is one of the movies I would recommend. Male dancers much better than the female dancers in this movie,",1402704000,,127,4.333333333333333
1365987,5,B00004WMDT,I'm a guy and I liked it. Interesting movie with many plots that grab you as the movie starts. We watched on tv and then finished the movie on amazon prime.  Just a nice feel good movie!,1402617600,,186,4.027027027027027
1365988,5,B00004WMDT,Anyone who enjoys dancing will love this movie.  It is a lot of fun to watch with the whole family.  Great music as well.,1401148800,,121,4.0
1365989,4,B00004WMDT,"Loved the music, dancing, costumes...storyline is predictable but it not raunchy and it is clean enough so that I could let my 9 year old watch it and not worry she would see something offensive or vulgar.",1401062400,,205,4.5675675675675675
1365990,4,B00004WMDT,"This is an uplifting movie whose real star is the dancing, but if the story wasn't at least somewhat engaging, you might as well watch a documentary about dancing. The plot lines are fairly simple, but I found myself caring about what happened to the characters. I'm glad I watched this nice little movie that doesn't aim too high and reaches all its targets.",1400716800,,359,4.625

1365992,5,B00004WMDT,"We picked this movie because our granddaughter is a great dancer...wish she had been watching it with us as there were many things we would have liked her input on but even watching it without her this movie was not only entertaining, the story line was consistent and we loved watching every minute of it.  Excellent movie for anyone that loves dance.",1399593600,,352,4.67741935483871
1365993,5,B00004WMDT,I chose this movie because of the love I have for ballet. I could not take my eyes off of it long enough to do the simplest task. Every minute of it was so enjoyable and well done. The dancers were amazing! I would recommend this movie to anyone. It is not only a good story line but terrific acting. I do wish the friend who was so negative and smart mouthed would have been characterized as a nicer person. Her dancing was amazing. I will watch it again and again.,1399075200,,466,4.131868131868132
1365994,5,B00004WMDT,Always been a favorite of mine. Passionate movie and full of energy. The dancing is incredible and makes me want to take some classes! Highly reccomend!,1398816000,,152,4.884615384615385

1365996,5,B00004WMDT,"This is a fun movie, Especially for dancers.  Would recommend it, but bedroom scene is not good for younger audience.",1398470400,,117,4.85
1365997,4,B00004WMDT,Just a good wholesome movie about living 'your' dreams. Great lesson about not always listening to what others think even when they are supposed to be the wise ones. Worth the time to watch it. Good dancing.,1398470400,,207,4.621621621621622

1365999,4,B00004WMDT,"I wish there more dancing, not at the end only... But movie is very good. About kids who trying to find way in life, about them and teachers , about usual problems... etc.",1397001600,,171,4.212121212121212
1366000,3,B00004WMDT,"As a dancer, I like to watch movies that pertain to dancing. I did not really appreciate the filming; however, the dancing was still good. The acting could probably be improved upon as well.",1396656000,,190,4.617647058823529
1366001,5,B00004WMDT,I watch this show every once in awhile because I used to dance and these are real dancers with real talent and the problems and challenges seem real as well. If you love dancing or have ever been a dancer you will love this show.,1396483200,,229,4.111111111111111
1366002,4,B00004WMDT,The movie is enjoyable with great choreography and real dancers. i feel like taking a dance class after this. I knew about Amanda Schull from Suits and was pleasantly surprised to see her as such an American beauty in Center Stage.,1396051200,,231,4.658536585365853
1366003,3,B00004WMDT,"I thought it was slow at times, but it ended up being a good film. If you like ballet, this is a movie for you.",1394582400,,111,3.48

1366006,5,B00004WMDT,"One of my all time favorite movies! I think it is what started my dreams of being a ballerina. I'm not sure why since this film is really showing the ugly side of dance with the struggle of eating disorders and rejection. However, it all has a happy ending.",1393804800,,257,4.26530612244898
1366007,5,B00004WMDT,"I am a ballet lover and this is the best ballet movie ever. They have actual professional dancers from professional ballet companies, except for Maureen the ""best ballet student"". The way they blend in her body double was pretty good, unless you're a ballet dancer you wouldn't notice it. I didn't know Zoe Saldana wasn't a ballet dancer until I looked her up after the first time I saw this movie back in 2000.",1393286400,,411,4.5675675675675675

1366010,5,B00004WMDT,"Love the dance to start with.  It was fun to watch and almost all were real dances so I was told. The story had it's struggles as competition, drive, innocence, doing when your heart just ain't there have in this movie.",1392508800,,219,4.341463414634147

1366014,3,B00004WMDT,Not a great movie but it keeps my five year old daughter busy. She loves all the dancing and the music. So if she's happy and quite then so am i. The acting isn't horrible the story line could have used a little more juice and then I think I would have been able to watch it.,1390867200,,275,3.8421052631578947
1366015,1,B00004WMDT,SOOOO dumb!!!! This movie is terrible teenage drivel wrapped so thinly in a dance-themed wrapper you can hardly tell the story is about a dance class. Do not watch this crap unless you're 13 and a drama queen.,1390348800,,209,4.526315789473684
1366016,4,B00004WMDT,I enjoy this movie. It makes me smile. The dancing and the music are entertaining. Not a bad storyline and a good coming of age film.,1389830400,,133,4.153846153846154
1366017,5,B00004WMDT,Love the dancing.  It has traditional and modern dancing combined.  I have watched this many many times.  Love the music too.,1389830400,,125,4.857142857142857

1366019,5,B00004WMDT,I love this movie. All I the characters are well acted and the issues that they deal with in the academy are real issues that dancers deal with.,1388707200,,144,4.178571428571429
1366020,4,B00004WMDT,"I have probably watched this movie 30 times. The dancing is great, though the body doubles are sometimes obvious. The best performance is probably Zoe Saldana's, though it is fairly un-nuanced. No matter--it's still a fun watch!",1388448000,,228,5.1891891891891895

1366024,5,B00004WMDT,"Given that Center Stage came out in the 90s, and even though I saw it in a theatre, it's so great to see the movie in such high quality.

Yes, I get that Center Stage is a cult classic, in a way, but the dancing is fun each and every time, and the cast is amazing.",1387497600,,264,3.7142857142857144
1366025,4,B00004WMDT,It is one of the better movies in this genre. Did show a lot of dancing even with having a story line and not just straight competition. The characters could have been more developed but were not totally shallow.,1387152000,,212,4.461538461538462

It was worth the time to watch it, but for anyone that truly enjoys dancing, The Turning Point is still the much better movie even though it is decades older.  Also, the documentary First Position leaves this film in the dust.  It's a harmless diversion, but not one of the better films I've seen, even about dancing.",1375056000,,471,4.571428571428571

The intertwining stories were charming and interesting, but at least for me, they were not the main attraction. During the dance workshop that all these students spend a year preparing for, I couldn't tear my eyes from the screen. It seems impossible that a movie could have a solid 15 minute block of dancing with no dialogue, but Center Stage pulls it off.

1366081,4,B00004WMDT,"Centre Stage is a really fun movie and has fantastic dancing. I say this as a dancer. (Most of the choreography sucks, but that's another soapbox.)
That's the real reason to watch this film, becaue if you pay attnetion to the wooden acting, the stupid script and the cliches strewn haphazardly through the film, you'll be disappointed.
It really does show the sick mindset of the dance world though, about how dancers are expected to be thin whether that is their normal body type or not. One of the main supporting characters is bulimic and through the course of the movie stops dancing and confronts her mother their dysfunctional relationship. There is nothing fundamentally wrong here, except that the whole thing is presented very simplistically. In the real world, these events would never happen. When you have an eating disorder you are so emotionally dysfunctional that usually, confronting the people at the root of your pain is the last thing you are capable of doing. It was hard to believe that this girl was seriously ill when all of a sudden she found the self-respect to start standing up to people and vocalising her needs. That just doesn't happen overnight.
On the otherhand, I suppose that someone with an eating disorder who saw this movie might concievably be encouraged to take steps towards recovery. I guess it's possible that you might see what the character did and be given some hope that you could take that direction too.",1058745600,,1451,4.854838709677419

She soon discovers that her love of dancing and her body is perfect for a different kind of ballet - with catchy dance moves and a great soundtrack, Center Stage is for everyone especially those who love dance!!

The cast has at least one more famous actor, Peter Gallagher as the demanding choreographer and company head, Jonathan.  The dancing is the thing in this film, from ballet practice scenes to salsa dancing, to wonderful ballet scenes, to the avant garde ballet choreographed by Cooper at the end, the dancing is riveting.  Amanda Schull as Jody is very believable, sweetly beautiful and captures your sympathy. Sascha Radetsky as Charlie is magnetic and sexy, but as sweet as the boy next door.  Ethan Stiefel as Cooper is wonderfully demanding and captivating as the ""seducer"".  The whole cast young people captures the frustrations, dreams and demands of the profession of the ballet.

1366087,4,B00004WMDT,"... or maybe a ""Flashdance""  for a new generation?
I liked this movie - a lot. It dealt with serious issues in a fun and uplifting way. Was everything solved a little ""too quickly""? Sure, but since the plot of the movie didn't revolve around bulimia or guys who sleep around, I was okay with the way the movie resolved these problems.
The theme in this movie seems to be to accept who you are.
Jody wants to be a ""perfect little ballerina"". And she tries to be one. She works her toes bloody. She develops a major crush on the Company's star. All she wants is for dancing to be fun again. But no matter what she does, the dancing just isn't fun.
Enter Cooper, the Company's star male dancer. Even while he breaks her heart, he teaches her something very important. Cooper shows Jody how to enjoy dancing again.
It takes her a long time to realize that she simply is who she is - and by the time the movie wraps up, she's happy with herself. An imperfect ballerina who has the courage to walk away from her old dreams in order to embrace new possiblities.
It is this message of hope - the sheer optimism of  the movie, that made me enjoy it as much as I did. Was the acting Oscar  worthy? Probably not... but this was certainly no cheesy B movie, either.
Enjoy it for what it is - a fun story about the growing pains of a girl as she becomes a woman.",1018483200,2,1349,4.180769230769231

So when she finds out that she has been accepted into the ABA (American Ballet Academy), it is her dream come true.  Unfortunately, the Company will only accept three boys and three girls from the Academy, based on their performances in the final workshop.  Jody's first day at the Academy couldn't be any better.  She runs into the Academy's finest and best-looking dancer -- Cooper Neilson, she meets her new roomates: Eva (a beautiful dancer who won't be pushed around) and Maureen [the girl everyone envies and is virtually already accepted into the Academy (but she has to cope with a pushy mother and bulimia)], and she makes friends with three boys at the Academy: Charlie, Sergei, and Erik.  Even though it is obvious that Charlie wants Jody, Jody wants Cooper.  After going to a dance class outside of the Academy and running into Cooper, her knight in shining armor takes her to his apartment and they sleep together that night.  When Charlie and Jody both get roles in the final workshop that Cooper is going to choreograph, they are thrilled.  Cooper is designing a modern ballet: Jody is set to be the ballerina-in-training, Charlie is to be her attractive instructor, and Erik is the dashing motorcycle rider that swipes the ballerina off her toe shoes.  One night, Jody goes to see one a ballet that Cooper is starring in and is horrified to see him leaving with another girl and taking no notice of her.  Practices start to get tense when Jody refuses to take orders from Cooper and when Charlie and Cooper start showing off for Jody.  Then Erik gets in to a serious accident and the doctor tells him that he will not be able to dance until after the workshop is over.  Cooper has no choice but to take Erik's role himself.

For amateur actors, I think they did pretty well, because I couldn't say Julia Roberts' films or the other well-known actors and actresses could have made it any better.
But the dancing is what you should go for. The dancing is beautiful. They are really professional dancers, unlike Save the Last Dance. I think Save the Last Dance could not compare to Center Stage. Julia Stiles was not a real ballet dancer, and she did mostly hip hop dancing, and I wouldn't go see her acting again. Center Stage also gives you an idea about how hard it is to be in a ballet company, or just make it into one. Ballet is not easy, and that's what they are showing.

In addition to having tons of fabulous dance footage (there's ten straight minutes of the most rockin' ballet I've ever seen towards the end of the movie), it's a really cute story with believable characters.  I never get tired of watching this movie, and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes to watch dancing or just likes stories about young love.  This is one of my favorite movies ever -- try it and I bet you'll love it too!  (Just a side note -- I have the VHS version.  I don't know if the DVD has any additional scenes/extra dance footage or director's commentary or anything, but if it does, I would definitely recommend that over the VHS because anything extra to this is icing on the cake!)",996192000,,790,4.376712328767123

It features characters that can be found in any teen movie, like the girl who has some ability but believes that she can achieve what she wants with hard work, the sassy girl, and the womanizing jerk. Still, it does have 2 redeeming qualities. 1) Some of the dance scenes are imaginative and well danced and choreographed. 2) It has Ethan Steifel, arguably the best dancer out there today and will certainly end up rivaling Baryshnikov in ability. His dancing is nothing short of amazing and hopefully, he'll make people realize that having sons who dream of dancing ballet isn't such a nightmare.

The story line is bit simple, but all the dances supplements fun to the film.  The performance they showed nearly at the end of the film with Amanda Schull as the leading dancer was awesome.

Although there were some scenes in which parts of the dialogue sounded corny and immature. I thought that the performance of Amanda Schull as the lead part of Jodie Sawyer was amazing. Her acting was very believable and her dancing was amazing and on point in the different dance numbers especially in the final dance scene in the movie when she just blows everyone out of the water when she dances to the song Canned Heat by Jamiroquai. Ethan Stiefel was amazing as the talented but also selfish dancer Cooper Nielsen, I never even knew who Ethan Stiefel was until I saw this movie, his dancing in it proves to be nothing but spectacular and all of his moves are very much on point. Sasha Radetsky as the sweet and talented dancer Charlie was so endearing in this movie and his dancing and acting in the movie were more than perfect. Peter Gallagher fit the part perfectly as Jonathan who runs the American Ballet Company, his character is both egotistical and harsh and Peter does it so well. The music featured in this movie was a great mix of hip hop, r&b,rock and even some latino. This movie is definitely one in which all teenagers can relate to. It shows all the pain, tears and hardships that these men and women have to go through and how they break through them and make their dreams of dancing professionally come true.

I have talked with many of my friends who are not dancers and or who are of the opposite sex, and they don't really care for the movie. I believe that some people are unable to really understand it if they are not dancers themselves. I know from personal experience that this movie accurately dipicts a dancer's life. Everything from taping their toes to allowing their life to revolve around dance, it is all true. Now yes I will agree it was kinda corny and typical for the ""sappy"" music to be playing in the background when Mourine is speaking with her mother, but all in all this is an excellent movie. And I stand firmly on my belief that one can not truly understand and appreciate this movie if they have not lived that life of always watching their weight and walking on feet that are numb from pain. The one thing everyone who sees this movie should keep in mind is that at one time in their life they also had some dream they wished to acheive; Jodi Sawyer's just happened to be being a ballerina.",976406400,,1068,4.371859296482412

The acting is done by little known actors who can dance basically. The only familiar characters are Maureen [Susan May Pratt] from Drive Me Crazy, and Johnathan [Peter Gallagher] from American Beauty.

1366127,4,B00004WMDT,"Surprisingly enough, ""Center Stage"" was a pretty good movie.  Nothing that really excels or bombs in my opinion, but I did have some problems with it.  Not really problems; more like little irkings.
The first was the star, Amanda Schull.  She seemed to have no rhythm.  Now when I say this, I don't mean she can't dance.  I just mean she has no internal metronome.  In the ballet and jazz classes she was off by the slightest little bit.  This bothers me because, as a very involved musician, you learn how being off just a little bit can really screw you up.
Another was the fact that the characters were flat.  Where is the development?  People are multidemensional, and while I understand that ballet is your career, it shouldn't be all of you.
The last was that the passage of time never really happened.  I watched it twice, and only the second time did I have a better grip on ""reality"".  It's two hours long and is supposed to cover at least nine months of ground; however, it felt like only a week had passed between the auditions and the student workshop.
But as I said, overall this is a good piece.  I'm questioning how many are real dancers and how many are fake (I would have guessed the lead to be fake in a second, though she's s young pro?).  I don't remember much about when this came out in theaters, but I do remember the big deal about that Sascha (Charlie) fellow.  He didn't seem to have a very big part.  Just goes to show how misleading previews are.
I'd welcome a copy into my home, but not for $107.  It was strange to watch a movie about ballet dancers (still a novel concept to mainstream), but I was intrigued and it held my attention the whole time.  Unfortunately, it doesn't have a large audience to cater to, so it will be passed over.  It deserves more credit than it gets.",974160000,,1807,4.375375375375375
1366128,4,B00004WMDT,"Wouldn't it be nice if someone produced a film about ballet with an interesting story?  Unfortunately, ""Center Stage"" is not it.  While charming at times with a very upbeat ending, the story is ultimately just another jejune and unoriginal teen flick.  Instead of teens in jeans, we have teens in tights.  Otherwise, the storylines are indistinguishable, lacking anything that approaches novelty, depth or substance.
That having been said, this likeable film was easy to watch and the dancing was exquisite.  If only there had been more of it.  The fact that the cast was filled with real dancers instead of actors pretending to be dancers improved its realism and delivered fantastic dancing scenes without the need for stunt dancers.  Unfortunately, the flip side of this decision was the fact that the acting was generally mediocre.
Two standouts were Amanda Schull (Jody Sawyer) and Zoe Saldana (Eva Rodriguez).  Schull was affable yet determined and was most credible in her portrayal of a struggling dancer.  Saldana played the irreverent bad girl who was brilliantly talented but had trouble with authority.  She emerged as the most complete of any of the cast members, being both a good dancer and an excellent actor.
On the terrible side, we have Susan May Pratt (Maureen), who has done a string of teen flicks (""Drive Me Crazy"", ""Ten Things I Hate About You"").  As always, she was consistently puerile and abrasive.  Peter Gallagher is not known for lighting up the screen, but he was flat even for him (if that is possible).
I rated this film a 7/10 because I love ballet and all kinds of dance.  Subtract at least two points if you don't share that passion, unless you love teen flicks.",973987200,3,1698,4.895104895104895

1366131,5,B00004WMDT,"This is a movie about fresh-faced young ballet dancers who attend the American Ballet Academy and compete for a few coveted spots in the ballet company.
This is the first film for the stars,  Amanda Schull, who in real life is an apprentice at the Corps de Ballet in San Francisco, and Ethan Steifel, who is the principal dancer for the American Ballet Theater and considered the best male dancer in the world.  Their acting is good, but it overshadowed by their absolutely magnificent dance performances.
There's a good universal story here of the competition among the young dancers, their hopes and dreams, romances and mishaps.  There's Zoe Saldana as the wisecracking rebel with an attitude who nevertheless loves to dance. There's Susan May Pratt as a bulimic who has been pressured into ballet by her mother.  There are several love triangles and some surprises in the plot.
But most of all -- there is the dancing.  Ah, the dancing!  There's classical ballet and Latin dancing and a finale that combines elements of jazz, modern and ballet.  The music is perfect for the dance pieces.  And everyone is beautiful.
The film stirred longings in me to get up and dance myself, and in a way I was doing that as I completely got into watching this video.  For all lovers of dance and for 117 minutes of total enjoyment, Center Stage gets a high recommendation from me.",972950400,144,1370,4.746835443037975

This is not at all under  any circumstance something you want to go to w/ a male of any kind, as they  will spend the entire time making fun of it, and thus spoiling the mood for  you.
