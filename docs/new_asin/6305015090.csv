947210,4,6305015090,"Previously owning the VHS copy released some years ago, i was highly disapointed to find that they still have not included the full DX skits in there entirity.

It does not show the full skit they did on The Nation where X-pac plays mark Henery and says, (in a Fat Albert voice)""Hey, hey hey, Rocky!... I smell what you're cooking, quite frankly it smells like  s***. But don't matter, think i'll eat some anyway"" - that skit was classic and it's not shown in its entirity.

Plus, the original was not censoured, the dvd has bleeps over the cuss words and black tape over the nudity. The bleeping out has completly ruined the DX press confrence speech about what words will and won't be used. The whole thing is just *beep*beep*beep*beep*watch your mouth*beep*beep*beep* it's just not funny when its censoured.

So I cant give this DVD the perfect 5 stars. Not to mention that they didn't continue on and show what became of DX since the video was released. Even tho it wasn't all that great, they shouldve at least added the footage where DX got back together and brought Tori and Stephenie McMahon into the group. Plus the one night reunion's. Sure, it may have ended as the DX group splitting up, but it was still DX.

Hopefully in future there will be a volume 2 that includes the HBK vs HHH fueds starting from at least the time when HBK was commisioner of the WWF and how all that came about then go into the reunion that happend in 2006 and so on and show the skits in there entirity.",1158537600,,1491,4.466911764705882
947211,4,6305015090,"With the recent DX reunion on RAW and the re-release of this video (now on DVD), I popped this into the VCR for old times sakes.  I also happen to get a copy of the DVD as a present so I'll review & compare the two.

VHS:
This was back when WWE was not only the World Wrestling Federation (seems like a long time ago, doesn't it?) but also during the Attitude era.  That means that on this tape, it was WWF at it's best.  The selling point of this tape, it was all uncensored.  You saw some girls flashing & they let the language fly...like I said, UNCENSORED!  You get mini-profiles & highlights on DX members (HHH/Chyna/HBK/New Age Outlaws) and highlights of what made DX so popular from their in & out the ring pranks, comedy, interviews and promos including all the times they picked on Michael Cole.  You also end up getting some non-televised footage from their invasion of the WCW offices and CNN Towers.  Overall, it was just a fun video to watch.

DVD:
Now the problem with this one was that this was put out by World Wrestling Entertainment which means that all the WWF logos are blurred out.  Also, the Attitude era is over which means that WWE censored the video.  You don't hear the cuss words & the footage of the flashing girls are edited out of the video.  This hurts the video greatly but they try to make it up by adding 8 matches to the DVD...however the problem is that most of these matches are throwaway matches from RAW instead of more high profile matches.  For example, DX had a PPV named after them but didn't have one match from it on this DVD.  Anyways, here are the matches:

HBK vs. Mankind - Nope, this isn't the match from Mind Games...this is a match from RAW that was very similar to that match but only in a short time period.  This match was the one that had ""Ravishing"" Rick Rude return to the WWF as Shawn's ""insurance policy.""

HBK & HHH vs. Mankind & Undertaker - This was the first time HBK & HHH teamed up together in this RAW main event, the match was actually going well but it was without a doubt the match that made Shawn a bonified heel when he kept beating up Taker with a chair to the point where he was bloodied.

HHH vs. Bret Hart - This was another average match but the bigger focus here was Shawn being Shawn & goofing around by picking his nose with the the Canadian flag at ringside.

European Title Match: HBK vs. HHH - This really wasn't even a match as it was classic D-Generation X once again playing mind games with the crowd & defying authority.  This match was just like WCW's ""fingerpoke"" between Hulk Hogan & Kevin Nash except this one was actually entertaining & funny.

HBK vs. Owen Hart - Basically another average RAW match that resulted in interference & another beatdown by DX

WWF Title & Casket Match: HBK vs. Undertaker - This was actually one of the two matches on here that wasn't from RAW.  This was from the Royal Rumble '98 and was the match that forced HBK to retire for years because of a serious back injury he suffered in this match.  Anyways, Taker & HBK never have a bad match & this was no exception.

Non-sanctioned Match: HHH/New Age Outlaws/Savio Vega vs. Stone Cold/Cactus Jack/Chainsaw Charlie/Owen Hart - This was from No Way Out of '98 and was just an all out wild brawl full of weapons non-stop.  However the real highlight came after the match when Austin gave a stunner to Chyna.

European Title Match: Triple H vs. Owen Hart - This really wasn't even a match as it was just Triple H insulting Owen Hart (who had a broken ankle) forcing him into a match which was just HHH pulling on Owen's ankle until he gave up.  I guess this was here just like the other European Title match just to show classic DX manipulation.

So out of the eight matches put on here, only six of them are actual matches & only two go past the 10 minute mark.  Again, they could have included the HBK vs. Ken Shamrock & HHH vs. Sgt. Slaughter matches from the DX PPV, HBK vs. British Bulldog for the European Title at One Night Only, or at least the WM14 matches involving DX.  I know there were more matches from the DX involving those like X-Pac & The Outlaws but the focus of this DVD is on HBK & HHH.

As for which ones you want, it depends on what you want.  If you want the documentry, get the VHS.  If you want the matches, get the DVD.",1157328000,7,4313,4.30359355638166
947212,4,6305015090,"I don't know why they don't sell this on dvd at amazon since I just picked it up at best buy and wanted to write a review about it. Anyway it has all the same matches on it though.

  Mankind vs HBK: A solid match that starts DX when HHH, Chyna and Rick Rude ""yes he was in DX once"" all help Shawn pick up the win. There's a lot of back and forth action until Rick Rude nails Mankind with a chair and then Shawn hits Sweet Chin music. 8/10

  Mankind and The Undertaker vs HHH and HBK: It ends with Shawn hitting Taker with a chair and making him bloody causing a DQ. 7/10

  Triple H vs Bret Hart: Would've been better if we could've saw who would've won if HBK didn't knock out Bret with Sweet Chin Music outside the ring. HHH then wins by count-out. This one would've been a classic otherwise and Bret probably would've won. 7/10

  WWE European Championship with HBK defending against HHH: This match is just a joke with the 2 of them just fooling around with HBK laying down for HHH to let him get the win and win the title. No rating but still entertaining

  Shawn Michaels vs Owen Hart (world title): This is a solid match until we get  yet another match with DX interference. Owen has the sharpshooter on HBK and HHH nails Owen with his crutch to cause the DQ ending. 7/10

  HBK vs The Undertaker in a Casket match (World title): This is probably the best match on the dvd ""yes I am reviewing the dvd and not the VHS version"". It's a solid match but it doesn't have much of an ending either. The Outlaws and Savio Vega and other attack the Undertaker and then Kane comes out to make the save. So eventhough it's  a great match with HBK taking a lot of bumps ""it's even the match that messed up his back!"" it's disapointing that no one won.

  Anything Goes 8 man tag with Stone Cold, Cactus Jack, Terry Funk and Owen Hart vs Triple H, Savio Vega ""taking an injured Shawn's place"" and the Outlaws: This is also won of the best matches especially since it actually doesn't end by DQ! It's bloody with Cactus and Terry Funk taking a lot of bumps. Stone Cold eventually wins with a stunner on Road Dogg. After the matches he stuns HHH and Cyhna! 9/10

  HHH vs Owen (European title on Raw): These two has way better matches following this match. Owen had a leg injury and Chyna takes out his leg outside the  ring. Then HHH puts Owen in a leg lock for the submission to win the European title. Another one that's hardly a match but just to show how dominating DX was. 5/10 but not because the 2 aren't talented.

  The WWE should release bonus discs for their dvds especially since most of them ""like the Bret and Ric Flair dvds"" are mssing great matches. Matches they could add:

  X-Pac  "" he is shown on the back but he is nowhere to be seen on the dvd"" vs D-Lo Brown (European title), X-Pac vs Dean Malenko ""In Dean's debut"", X-Pac vs Road Dogg in the King of  Ring tournerment

  The Outlaws vs Terry Funk and Mick Foley ( Tag titles) at WM, vs L.O.D., Road Dogg and X-Pac vs Billy Gunn and Chyna, Road Dogg vs Chyna in the King of Ring tournerment

  Chyna vs Jeff Jarrett (IC title), vs Chris Jericho (IC title) vs Ivory (Women's title), Chyna vs HHH: she wasn't  in DX in these matches I think but they show how DX led to her success.

  HBK vs British Bulldog (European title) in England), vs Undertaker, (Hell in a Cell), vs  Bret Hart (Screw Job match), vs Jim Neidhart on Raw, vs Vader on Raw, vs Ken Shamrock at the Degeneration X ppv (wotld title), HHH vs The Rock (World title) with Shawn as ref helping HHH pick up the win,  former DX members colliding with HBK vs HHH at SummerSlam in Shawn's return to the ring.

  HHH vs Sgt. Slaughter in a boot camp match, vs Owen Hart at WM (European title), The Rock in a Ladder match (IC title), HHH vs The Rock in a I Quit match on Raw (World title),  vs X-Pac, w/ Stephanie vs Chris Beniot in his debut match on Smackdown, vs Shawn in Hell in a cell, DX reforming vs the Spirit Squard, DX vs the Spirit Squard at Saturday Night Mainevent in an Elimination tag, vs Vince and Shane at SummerSlam 2006.",1155254400,,4064,4.206225680933852

947252,4,6305015090,I really enjoyed reliving the past and my wife liked seeing HHH as pre-Evolution. I was dissappointed that there wasn't more about the New Age Outlaws. Overall I would recommend this video to anyone who is into wrestling.,1125705600,,221,4.842105263157895
947253,4,6305015090,"I got into wrestling in October 1999, sometime after smackdown started airing so I wanted to get videos on stuff that I missed out on and I found the DX video.  Ofcourse, I bought this around four years ago but it would be nice if WWE made a new DX DVD and added more such as matches, promos, etc.  Despite that, it's a good non-pay per view video and highlights the biggest moments of DX mainly during the the HBK version of DX.  It seems to stop after May of 1998 since there is some footage (very brief) of DX fighting the Nation.  If anything, it highlights some classic moments such as the war on WCW, the countless (...) jokes, and others.  As I said, it would be nice if this video was turned into a DVD with much more footage.  Still, this is the best (and only) DX video available.",1085184000,2,790,4.198675496688741
947254,3,6305015090,"This tape may feature more of the first (and in my opinion, better) incarnation of D-Generation X, it still leaves some of D-X's most notorious moments out.
Where is the infamous Kliq ""Curtain Call"" tape shown to millions of viewers on Raw? Or my favorite D-X stunt, Shawn coming down from the ceiling as the Undertaker completely fooling the audience? ""How do you like your Undertaker? Rare, medium or well done?!""
One hour isn't nearly enough, but to those of you who haven't seen any of D-X or some of their finest moments - this is the tape for you.

The original version of DX (HBK, HHH and Chyna) is featured more than the second incarnation (HHH, Chyna, X-Pac and the New Age Outlaws), so those hoping to see lots of footage of 'Pac and the NAO will be a bit disappointed.  However, all DX fans will be delighted with this humorous video, as many of the early, classic DX moments are featured.  With lots of profanity and brief nudity (women flashing their breasts), ""D-Generation X"" is NOT for children.

947296,4,6305015090,"Dx is hilarious. Shawn Micheals and HHH were great together. They mock almost everyone. This movie mostly focuses on the formation of Dx. When Shawn and HHH were forced into a tag team match and the from then on they  became official D-Generates. Like I said they mocked, the embarassed, and  they trashed so many members of the WWF. For instance when Triple H was in  the ring fighting Brett Hart, Shawn Micheals had Brett Harts home country  flag in his nose which was the Canadian flag. Thats nothing there are many  other immitations on this video and many other funny scenes. There is a  small scene where Jason Sensation and DX make fools out of the Nation of  Domination in Best of Raw Vol. 1 so look into that to. Like I said earlier,  this video pretty much focuses on the beginnings of DX so if you're a Road  Dogg, a Bad A** , or an X-pac fan don't count on getting much glimpses of  the later Degenerates. I love X-Pac and Road Dogg but they don't really get  much of a part in this video that's why I only gave it four stars.

7880432,5,6305015090,"This spectacular 1 hour video takes you through nearly the entire first year of D-Generation X. Your hosts are Triple H, Chyna, X-Pac, and The New Age Outlaws with Michael Cole working as their lackey.

The early history of DX is shown in clips and narrated by Michael Cole. It first starts off with some DX's earlier shenanigans and pranks they pulled on victims such as Vince McMahon. Sgt. Slaughter, The Hart Foundation, and even Michael Cole. It then delves into how the group was first formed before giving the viewer a look at the respective careers of both Hunter Hearst Helmsley and Shawn Michaels. The last little while of this movie shows us the second incarnation of DX from 1998; the hosts; Triple H, Chyna, X-Pac, and The Outlaws.

It's not all just clips and flashbacks though. In between recaps, Michael Cole is occasionally shown being forced by Triple H into leading him to the production truck, where DX breaks into, takes over, and makes their own video.

Overall: This is an amazing video to come out of the Attitude Era! Fans of the original DX and the 1998 DX Army will enjoy this video to no avail. To play up their gimmick, the WWF supposedly never knew about DX making this video, which means there's no restrictions. There are no censors, no edits, no censor blurs, no nothing! It's 100% unadulterated which is exactly the way it should be to play up the D-Generation X gimmick. I highly recommend buying this VHS, pulling out your old VHS, dusting it off, and popping this video in to relive some of the good old retro days from one of WWE's greatest factions of all time",1410393600,,1598,4.6

7880437,4,6305015090,"Definitely a must-see! This VHS is 60 minutes of pure, uncensored DX - the original incarnation, and undoubtedly the rowdiest DX of all. If you miss the Attitude Era, you're going to want this video; it's certainly not something the PG WWE can release. It includes cussing, nudity, and - very best of all - no editing of the WWF logo. Awesome.

However, it does have its cons - on the VHS version, there are no full matches, just partial highlights. Furthermore, there is no new footage of Shawn Michaels because during the time this video was made he was ""D-Xcommunitcated"" (in reality, I believe he was taking an extended hiatus from wrestling due to his back injury). Also, a quick note: this tape does focus a bit more on HHH, HBK, and Chyna, so fans of X-Pac and the post-HBK ""DX Army"" may be a little disappointed; however, they do get quite a bit of screen time at the end, so don't pass this video up. Finally, as I was not a fan during the attitude era - I was still watching Barney and Teletubbies at the time of the Attitude Era - I can't tell you if they included all the classic, must-see DX moments, but everyone's mileage seems to vary on that anyway so I would recommend getting the tape and judging for yourself.

Later on I'll probably be purchasing the DVD for the 8 extra matches, but I know the excessive censorship is going to make me cringe. If you have to choose between the VHS and the DVD, get the VHS - it shows you what DX was really about - nasty, naughty fun! SUCK IT!",1341100800,,1498,4.327402135231317
7880438,5,6305015090,"D-Generation X shows the great history of the best tag-team/stable in wrestling history. It shows how it started, the fights and down-times and the stable without Shawn. The thing I like the most about the VHS is that it is un-censored and raw and shows all the pranks you wanted to see without the bleeps or blockage like the re-made dvd! Great job WWE!!!!!",1322179200,,358,4.609375
