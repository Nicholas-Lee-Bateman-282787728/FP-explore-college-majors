8184069,4,B00005ASS5,"This is a cool cartoon that I use to watch wen I was a kid back in the 80s. Its about 3 GIANT Monsters. Tendril. D'Compose and Metlar the Inhumanoids. Monsters that were buried during ancient times. That just now have ben let loose by humans that did not know what they were doing. The 3 Monsters wage war against the earth after being set free. The only ones that can stop them are 4 scientists  Armstrong, Bright, Auuger, and Liquidator, that form a team called Earth Corps. and some other monsters that first locked the Inhumanoids up. It is really cool that Rhino has release the Inhumanoids and some other good cartoons from the 80s. They have release The Inhumanoids the Evil that lies within Volume 1 with 2 Episodes on it. And Volume 2 with 3 Episodes on that one. what I don't get is why they did not release all 5 Episodes on 1 VHS Tape. like thy did on the DVD? and why they cut some of the theme song out? P.S the tape does not last 60 mins. its more like 30 mins.",989798400,,976,4.191489361702128
