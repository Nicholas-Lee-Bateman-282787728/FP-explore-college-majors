8727822,5,B013I9RF2A,We visited Sluy's bakery in Poulsbo Washington after seeing it on this program. The Viking Cups really are wonderful! Our next day trip is to the Sacramento Japanese bakery featured in the program. These Mom & Pop type places remind me of long ago adventures with Dad on early Sunday mornings to get the Sunday paper and visit the local bakery for that special doughnut or cookie to eat while perusing the Sunday comics. Brings back lots of good memories...,1520812800,,457,4.725

Columbus Baking Company (Syracuse, NY) In business since 1895, some of the old equipment is still in use. I was fascinated by the huge wooden rolling troughs for raising the dough.

Orange Peel Bakery (Marthas Vineyard, MA) Has a pizza night every Wednesday night. They provide the crusts and customers bring their own toppings. Its a community get-together.

Sluys Bakery (Pollsbo, WA) Learn the best way to get your bread loaves to release from the pan.

ChezMoi (Durham, NC) All the cooking is done at home, and then she sells out of her dessert truck.

Standard Baking Company (Portland, ME) New tip: croissants need a knick at the wide end, which you spread before rolling up.

Minerva Bakery (McKeesport, PA) I want one of their frosting dipping wavy thingies.

Rounded off with Mama Ines Mexican Bakery (Lafayette, IN), SilverBow Bakery (Juneau, AK), Mahoroba Japanese Bakery (Sacramento, CA) and Bernices Bakery (Missoula, MT).

This isn't a show about recipes or how to bake. Its a celebration of those who love to bake and those who love to eat what they bake.

I watched the very enjoyable sister show about pie shops, a specialty among bakeries. Also by Rick Sebak:
