Even if the movies were half decent, I wouldn't be able to tell because the footage is so washed out.",1301875200,31,127,4.04
4218906,1,B003XUIMHM,The DVD is unwatchable.  The picture for all the movies is so washed out you can't even tell what you are watching.  The sound is only marginally better.  A complete waste of money even at only 11 dollars. I threw mine out after trying to sit through 3 of the movies. All the movies look and sound as bad as any I have ever seen on a DVD.,1297728000,59,338,3.9411764705882355

8408534,5,B003XUIMHM,Death murder and suicide. Nude women on bikes with sons who are artist. Self control and power. Emotionally unavailable truth seekers and schools of self inflicted anthems of hate and perpetual self destruction to a narrative of total destruction. Sweat out your rage and violence. Sex symbols and experiences of premarital affection.,1489708800,,334,5.4423076923076925

8408539,5,B003XUIMHM,"We bought this DVD set to watch in the drive-in movie theater that we created for ourselves in our 4 car garage. It isn't the best of the best, but it surely is entertaining. We'll bring some popcorn and candy and watch two or three of them. Already looking for another Drive-in Collection to purchase.",1401494400,,302,4.509090909090909
8408540,3,B003XUIMHM,"I picked this up at Best Buy for $4.99 and was expecting much worse picture and sound than I ended up with. These are cheap old movies, they aren't going to look like a restored Blu Ray. I was happy with the quality.",1334966400,11,216,4.046511627906977
8408541,1,B003XUIMHM,"Roger Corman's films have been the unfortunate victim of many terrible releases; this is one of them. While the print quality varies, it's mostly subpar to unwatchable. How these companies stay in business is a mystery when the product is so bad. There are much better transfers on some of these titles (The Terror, one of the most widely available in terrible prints, was just released in a pristine DVD and Blu-ray combo). Don't be fooled by the low price; this isn't worth a nickel.",1319587200,28,485,4.7176470588235295
