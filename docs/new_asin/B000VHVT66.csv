2941474,5,B000VHVT66,"In 1975 Milos Forman made One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, winner of 5 Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director. In 1984 he brought us Amadeus, winner of 8 Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director. Now, 23 years later, he brings us Goya's Ghosts, a brand new epic masterpiece on par with his previous critically acclaimed Academy Award winners.

The only difference is, Goya's Ghosts not only didn't get a single Oscar nomination, but it was slammed and hated by most critics. I'll make this part of my review short and simply say that this film must be so brilliant that it went right over the critics heads. The script is complicated, and the meaning of the title has been misinterpreted by almost everyone i've talked to about it.

Now, for the film itself. Perfection. Absolute perfection. Do not believe any of the negative reviews from the critics. This film is a masterpiece in every way. Music, acting, cinematography, script, everything. It's a breathtaking period drama that grips you from the first frame to the last and leaves you barely able to wrap your mind around just how perfect and brilliant it was. This is not a film to miss. It has taken the spot of #3 in my top 10 films of all time, #2 and #1 being One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Amadeus. At the request of the first person who commented on my review, I've edited my review here to say that Milos Forman could testify to the fact that i'm not related to him or to anyone involved in the creation or publicity of any of his films.

I'm not going to go into any plot details about the film. I'll simply say once more that it is possibly the greatest artistic achievement ever executed in the world of cinema. Buy the DVD when it's released. You won't regret it. Thank you Milos Forman!",1201910400,102,1792,4.5246913580246915
2941475,5,B000VHVT66,"Another masterpiece from Milos Forman, whose other titles include Hair, Amadeus, Valmont, and others.  This wonderfully written and directed movie is both, a philosophical commentary on history and social change, and a lush artisitc statement.  Plenty of screen shots from this film could well be framed and displayed in a museum.  The script is reminiscent of Victor Hugo's epics in scope and romanticism.  Sadly, most American movie taste-makers happen to lack either the emotional or the intellectual capacity to fully appreciate Goya's Ghosts. Too busy, perhaps, dissecting and heaping praise on titles such as Bourne Ultimatum, and other mass consumption garbage that infested the screens around that time of year.

This film is stands for the very virtues of good cinema and story-telling.  Do not pass it up.",1198800000,17,815,5.328125

2941477,5,B000VHVT66,"It seems that I had been waiting a long time to see Goya's Ghosts. I first heard about the film sometime in 2005. And I remember when they were filming it in Madrid. The subject matter was of great interest to me. It was being directed by Milos Forman and the screenplay was co-written by Forman and Jean Claude Carriere. And it starred Javier Bardem, Natalie Portman and Stellan Skarsgard. What could be better?

But the film had trouble finding a US distributor. In the meantime, it was released around Europe to dismal reviews. Earlier this year the film was picked up by Samuel Goldwyn Films and it was released here in July to the same type of reviews. But guess what? I saw the film when it was released and I thought that it was terrific.

The first part of the film takes place in 1792. The Inquisition is being reinstated. It is spearheaded by a fanatic monk named Lorenzo (Bardem). Lorenzo talks out of both sides of his mouth. He is having his portrait painted by the well known artist Francisco Goya (Skarsgard) but when he sees that the Church doesn't approve of Goya's work he makes the suggestion that Spain go back to its old, repressive ways.

A young woman named Ines (Portman), who is one of Goya's models, is accused of heresy because she doesn't want to eat pork. She is tortured into a false confession and left in the dungeons to rot. Goya asks for Lorenzo's help and Lorenzo visits her. Lorenzo and Ines pray together but he also rapes her. And Lorenzo is invited to the home of Ines' parents. He is put to the ""question"" by Ines' father Tomas (Jose Luis Gomez) and fails. He is eventually driven out of Spain.

We fast forward to fifteen years later. There is chaos on the streets of Madrid. The French Revolution has ""liberated"" Spain and the Inquisition is null and void. Ines is let out prison and the only one she has left is Goya (who is now deaf). She had a child while in prison and wants to find her. Lorenzo returns to Spain with his wife and children. He is now a proponent of the French Revolution and condemns the Church. And that is all of the plot I will tell you.

Goya's Ghosts is a fascinating film. It contains many themes that still resonate today. Torture, a foreign army occupying a country and hypocrisy (in the name of religion or a cause) to name a few. It is a film of ideas. I did not take my eyes off of the screen for a minute. I only wished that Goya's Ghosts were a mini series because there would be more time to explore all of these complex ideas.

All of the acting is top notch. Bardem is brilliant as a man who completely transforms himself. I read some bad reviews of his acting in the Spanish press. I honestly don't know what they are talking about. I was wondering if Portman would be able to pull off here triple role as the young and old Ines as well as her daughter Alicia. She does. She also got some bad reviews and, again, I don't understand it. Skarsgard is fine as Goya, a man of reason. Other actors who are good are Randy Quaid as the King, Jose Luis Gomez as Ines' father and Michael Lonsdale as Father Gregorio. The cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe is spectacular as is the production design by Patricia von Brandenstein and the costumes by Yvonne Blake.

Milos Forman has created a wonderful and important film that many people will not see because of the reviews. It is hard to fathom all of this when so many awful films don't get bashed in this way. Roger Ebert wrote an interesting review of Goya's Ghosts. He liked the film but he also makes an interesting observation about critics. Here is the link:

[...]

I didn't have much faith in film critics in the first place. But after this I have even less.

And one last thing - this past week I read a piece about Penelope Cruz. In it she was quoted as saying that Bardem is the best actor in the world. I will drink to that!",1191110400,43,3861,4.364902506963788

2941490,3,B000VHVT66,"Goya's Ghosts is a dramatic, panoramic film, capturing the gilt and pomp of the early 18th century and the turmoil of the Napoleonic era as perceived by most Spainards with great pathos and visual appeal.

Yet Goya's Ghosts typically scores poor reviews, probably more due to anti-Catholic bigotry and the relative dearth of gratuitous content compared to most contemporary films, than the film's actual flaws. The plot is slow and predictable, and the eponymous protagonist is not, as one might assume from the title, an inspired genius who draws out the human soul to cast upon canvas, but a weasely naif, a non-actor in the drama of his own life who seems to care for nothing but getting paid.

The worst feature of the film, however, is that it is not actually so much about its setting - the Spanish Inquisition's ruthless persecution of crypto-Jews - as it is an apologia for the Inquisition and the role institutional Catholicism played in pre-Napoleonic Europe - an upset that many in the Church are still quite disgruntled about. The film's narrative is to trumpet the party line: nothing was ever wrong, and anyone who got on the wrong side of the Church, had it coming.

Goya's Ghosts belongs to that iniquitous class of works intended to market antisemitism and other forms of bigotry, not through slander, but the slick devices of allegory and allusion. The main antagonist, Lorenzo, a corrupt monk driven by lust for power and self-gratification, is subtly painted as a crypto-Jew himself - although this is never stated in the movie. He is the only one of his order to wear a black skullcap. Unlike the rest, who talk in straightforward language, Lorenzo borrows the typically Jewish religious dialectical style steeped in irony and paradox. He is depicted as speaking about some of the eccentricies of the Jewish faith as one who knows them firsthand, and one might suspect his hostility to Voltaire is motivated as much by the philospher's hatred of the Church as his even more diabolical hatred of Jews.

True to the traditionally antisemitic narrative, Lorenzo will say anything out of cowardice or greed, but he will not repent for his sins - the twisted reflection of the Mosaic law by which Spainards witnessed many of the affluent but despised Jews would refuse to deny the truth of their belief and instead convert under duress to save their own lives. Conversely, the Sephardic crypto-Jews are a very interesting bunch of people who laid down a legacy of superhuman determination against impossible odds - and brilliantly ironic recipies like ""ansar&oacute;n cecinado"" and ""christianos y moros"".

http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/187191/try-some-jewish-ham-this-thanksgiving

One might assume from the outline of the film that Lorenzo's antagonist would be the putative stereotype of a creative and necessary but despised Jew, Francisco Goya (who was not of Jewish descent, either in the film or in real life). It is not so.

Rather, Goya bears witness to Lorenzo's undoing by arresting and raping the daughter of a wealthy family of quartile Sephardic descent. The family are portrayed as neither crypto-Jews nor fearful of their family's past being discovered, but confident and devout Christians who are indignant at Lorenzo taking the name of the Christian trinity in vain when tortured to sign a confession that he is ""the son of a monkey who has joined the church to do harm to it"" - as if nothing would have been at all wrong if they were in fact crypto-Jews and disenfranchised accordingly. To this day, allegations of being of partial Jewish descent are a serious accusation against character in traditionally-minded Spain.

The film's hardest moral failure is not the Jewish aspersions it casts upon the antagonist nor its cowardly apologia for the evil of the Inquisiton, but its depiction of the Spanish Catholic Church's ideal for how it should behave in society. The moral of the film is that barbaric, medieval archaeo-Catholic practices like abducting people they don't like, burning them at the stake, burning people they can't find in effigy, garrotting them when they do, confiscating property and intimidating citizens and monarchs alike through dogmatism-fueled demagoguery is all OK and will work out in the end by way of Providence.

According to this narrative, the problems of the time were never due to the Church but the godless Revolution and the putatively crypto-Jewish charlatans who supported it. The film is ultimately about the fatalism underscoring conservative Catholic dogma, an attitude not exclusive to Catholicism but common to any kind of dogmatic, monolithic institutionalized iteration of any given religion, including Judaism.",1509235200,,4694,5.157687253613666

2941492,5,B000VHVT66,"Outstanding movie in every respect.  Wonderful casting, acting and cinematography.  historically accurate portrayal of some most turbulent periods of Spain's fascinating history.  Spellbinding story of abuse of how wealth, power and religious control have shaped the country and the earthquake that Napoleon represented for feudal Europe.  Goya as a central figure is riveting.  The recreation of some of his paintings, his decline into deafness and depression, the depiction of his experiences which led to his various phases of prints (which are marvelously displayed), his moral struggle between his beliefs, servitude to his royal patrons and his conscience, all contribute to an appreciation of this magnificent artist.

2941500,5,B000VHVT66,Thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was superbly acted and the cinematography was awesome.

2941503,3,B000VHVT66,"Starting out smart, drawing the viewer in with pathos, compelling storytelling, and surprising twists and turns, the film is solid. But it veers off from thoughtful to chaotic, with invading countries' armies storming borders and prisons, and cavalries suddenly spanning the horizon, then barreling down hills. Francisco de Goya y Lucientes, played by Stellan Skarsgard, is depicted as strong and moral; submissive to the Church and Court, and that is likely wise, in order to steer clear of the garrote.  His etchings and drawings, selling mainly in other countries, are bold and confrontational, as they chronicle and expose the inhumanity and atrocities of the era of the Spanish Inquisition. As you will see, his diverse talents also allow him to apply ethereal angels to the ceilings of the Church and execute commissioned portraits of clergy, monarchs, and aristocracy. Events and characters are both historical and fictional. One of his favorite subjects is Ines (Natalie Portman), both model and muse, the daughter of a prosperous merchant. As the story begins, she is posing for Goya for a life-sized portrait, but she is everywhere in his work, a frequent face of angels.  Soon after, Ines suffers the horrible fate, after refusing pork in a tavern one night, of being turned over to the Holy Office (the Inquisition).  She is accused of being a secret Jew and is subjected to the ""Question,"" a hideous form of torture.  Brother Lorenzo (Javier Bardem) adds to the cruelty. An impressive scene takes place when her family confronts him. The piece is blessed with a team of consummate actors. Approximately the first third of the film is successful, in all aspects of filmmaking. Then finesse, nuance, and literacy seem to give way to calamity, with rough, though likely pricey, representations of warring factions, and sudden captures and rescues. If Charlton Heston had ridden round the bend, it might not have seemed out of keeping.",1489968000,,1944,5.1230283911671926
2941504,4,B000VHVT66,"Goya comes across as an avuncular portraitist. I'd have preferred to see more of the crazed artist that produced those eerie drawings. The main character in the movie is Lorenzo, and he is very well portrayed.",1489968000,,209,4.833333333333333

2941514,5,B000VHVT66,"One concept I found most valuable about this movie was the unknowing innocence of the family when they took their daughter to the inquisition in response to the summons; they really had no idea of the terror she would be subjected to.  What was about to happen seemed impossible, a horror completely beyond their anticipation or understanding.  It reminds me of a phrase I heard when Polish Jews who survived the Holocaust were asked why they so dutifully boarded the trains to the camps; they said ""because what was about to happen was simply beyond our imagining.""  Also instructive was the merchant's mistaken understanding that he had sufficient influence to control the developing events.  I think that when I originally saw this film in the theater, the part up until the arrival of the Queen was not included; the later sequence demonstrating the production of an etching was shown instead, which as a printmaker I found very enjoyable.

 How is it that when you combine this much talent in one film it completely flies under the radar of popularity and critical acclaim?
Culturally, the USA has fallen into a Comic Book Hero, Drunken, Stoner Buddy (Male & Female) Vulgar, Violent Tentpole producing 3rd rate medium when it comes to films,(with the occasional Indie exception.)

2941558,5,B000VHVT66,"In 1984 I went to see Milos Forman's film, Amadeus, with my classical-music-loving parents, even though the critics gave it a poor review. We loved it, and everyone in the theatre gave it a standing ovation and stayed to listen to the music till the bitter end and take note of all the credits. We were thrilled when it won all the Oscars, and from that time on, I have never given much credence to what many of the film critics say.  Usually, if they hate a movie, I will enjoy it immensely, and if they love it... well, let's just say that their tastes and mine usually differ.
This is truly an amazing film from all standpoints.  It is a crime that it didn't get a wider audience, just as Forman's other films did. The acting was outstanding, the plot was riveting, and those who say that the action is too slow... should watch it again because they've missed the best parts. Well done again, Milos!!",1474588800,4,903,4.401197604790419

I mean, this is definitely historical fiction, but it's nice to know what is true to history and what is fiction.

2941708,4,B000VHVT66,"I'm at a loss when deciding if I would recommend this film to anyone other than a Goya enthusiast, or fellow fan of Natalie Portman. Not because the acting is anything less than what we've come to expect from these truly talented individuals, but because the story line breaks in a way that muddles too many events from this beautiful, and terrifying period in our history. I know that sounds confusing enough, in and of itself, but that's how it made me feel. Unable to cary one through the film without the abrupt changing of events that startle, and bewilder just as you think it's finally going somewhere....Bam! Something else crazy random tears through, and commands full attention of the viewer. But in the end, just when you put everything in order, and see the directors vision, ya kinda wish something else had been on, so you wouldn't have to see our adorable Natalie go from sweet young girl to torture victim deluxe at the hands of the twisted fanatics that thought hanging someone from their hands tied behind their backs whilst telling them to confess to insane accusations in the name of God.
Super weird things wend down then, and I totally didn't need to see them in another film. Especially when the cinematography, sets, locations, and so on were so wonderfully executed. No pun intended.
So decide for yourself. What have you got to loose?",1470614400,,1360,4.742616033755274

He would have made a good Goya; not to knock Stellan Skarsgard, but a real Spaniard makes a more convincing silverscreen Spaniard. I was distracted by this fact endlessly, needlessly. That, and Natalie Portman's vapid portrayal of a traumatized woman, made me wonder if this weren't really a comedy. 3 stars: 1 for comedic value, 1 for period-film effort and 1 because I like Bardim.

Critiques: There were far too many gringo actors playing Spanish roles. This is one of those movies that makes me wonder if sticking to true accounts would have actually been more interesting than the goofy embellished version of Goya's life seen here.",1470528000,,727,4.862903225806452

2941763,5,B000VHVT66,"Milos Forman has done it again. As a cold war east European and son of Holocaust non-survivors, he has always brought a special depth to his productions.  This one took a hard look at the insular righteousness of inquisitors, who become the true devils of the material world.  This sense of macabre was echoed in Goya's own art, which has found a kindred spirit in director Forman.

Political themes always abound in a Forman film.  This one, released as the Abu Ghraib scandals were hitting the media, was especially timely.  Bardem as the fanatic who changes coats but not his skin would be an apt metaphor for other conquering powers bringing self-serving enlightenment to unwilling subjects. Perhaps because there are no longer rump Communist regimes to pin this tale to explains the embarrassed, ho-hum attitude of the Euro-American critic world: its moral was simply not ""useful"" to vested interests in present time.

Bardem's Lorenzo is the film's anti-hero, victim as much as villain.  One can't help pitying his tragic end, even if - as bad guy - he ""deserves"" it; and admiring his final defiance on the gibbet of the multiple betrayals that left him there.  His own victim - Natalie Portman's Ines - thereby comes to identify with him and follows him even on his death cart, surrogate baby in arms.  While I can't comment on the specific historic accuracy of the plot re: Goya's life, this is a meticulously-paced, icily-logical film worth seeing on its own merits for both story and artistic value.",1446422400,,1509,4.886274509803922

As a viewer I have felt that the Spanish inquisition has been overshadowed by modern wars and by other events in human history. The heartbreaking story of a beautiful young maiden in her budding, who was thrown into the dark dungeons of the cruel church awakens the viewer to the horrible reality of misuse of power and authority. One cannot remain indifferent at the atrocities of the church or feel any remote compassion towards the monarchy in Spain at that time. I felt also that Goya could have saved the poor girl from the claws of the church but who are we to judge this great artist at a time of upheaval whence he could have also ended in the dungeons of the inquisition to be tortured for sympathizing with Ines? There was so much pain in this film, that at the end I have shed tears and thanked destiny that such times in human history are over, at least in most parts of the world. There was so many losses in this film that I have felt like there were holes in my heart at the end. It was probably one of the greatest tragic films ever made.",1422921600,,1190,4.3408071748878925

2941781,5,B000VHVT66,"In their movies about Francisco Goya, Konrad Wolf and Milos Forman give the Spanish Court painter a totally different role. Also, those movies were shot in two different political regimes. But, still they have the same utmost relevant human message. As Oscar Wilde said in his `The Critic as Artist': `For when a work is finished, it has an independent life of its own, and may deliver a message far other than that which was put into its lips'. This is absolutely true for Konrad Wolf's movie, which attacked censorship in a totalitarian State.

In the movie by Konrad Wolf `Goya or the hard way to understanding', based on the novel by Lion Feuchtwanger (centered on Goya's private life), the artist is the direct target of the Holy Office's Inquisition, because of his paintings and diabolic etchings.
In `Goya's Ghosts' by Milos Forman, the painter is a kind of neutral observer or helpful middleman between the Holy Office and the family of an innocent victim of the Inquisition and its bestial `question'.
However, the message of both movies is crystal clear and highly relevant today; first of all, no inquisitional powers with armies of spies and laws propagating denouncements; and, secondly, no torture, because unbearable pain forces totally innocent people to confess anything asked for, which is then considered as the ultimate proof of their guilt by their barbaric interrogators.

The play of the whole cast in Milos Forman's movie is simply fascinating, but it is not fully convincing in Konrad Wolf's film.

All men and women of good will should view these remarkably courageous masterpieces.",1422230400,,1609,5.041353383458647

I saw it when it first came out, then after a trip to Madrid last year I decided to buy it. Other reviewers have already provided excellent synopses of the plot, so I won't summarize the film here. I will say, though, that I don't understand the reviews that say the movie is boring or the acting is bad. Perhaps the reviewers who found the movie boring just weren't in the mood or generally don't like this genre of film. Sure, the movie is a historical drama, but there are so many funny and ingenious scenes throughout that I don't see how anyone can consider it boring (the dinner scene, where the inquisitor played by Javier Bardem is himself ""tested,"" Inquisition style, by Se&ntilde;or Bilbatua whose daughter, played by Natalie Portman, has been wrongly imprisoned by the Inquisition, is absolutely priceless). The acting is excellent -- occasionally melodramatic, perhaps, but Natalie Portman is superb as a young and completely innocent victim of the Inquisition (her Spanish accent is superb too), Javier Bardem is convincing as a calm but passionate (and yes, very much holier-than-thou) priest, and Blanca Portillo as the feisty Queen Maria Luisa is hilarious in her much smaller role. In many ways I liked this film even more than Milos Forman's Amadeus. It doesn't have your typical Hollywood ending, which is a plus in my view. I learned something about Goya's work from it, and it inspired me to seek out the tucked-away Goya rooms at the Prado museum in Madrid -- definitely one of my fondest memories from last year's trip.",1417046400,3,1843,4.691358024691358

2941797,4,B000VHVT66,"This controversial masterpiece, directed by Milos Forman, revolves around the story of Ines, a muse for all the paintings of the renown Spanish artist, Francisco Goya - whose paintings have graced the ceilings of chapels and adorned the homes of royalty and the wealthy, serving as a ghost that haunts him, and whose facial features are immortalized in every representation of the female gender ever rendered by Goya, who was suspected of being a Jew due to her distaste of pork and, was hence, put to the question by Father Lorenzo - the priest put in charge of the Spanish Inquisition by Father Inquisitor, and, thus, being forced into an admission of having practiced witchcraft, much to the incredulity of her family who, then, attempts to prove Ines' confession a fallacy by putting Father Lorenzo to the question and forcing him to sign a confession attesting to the fact that he is a monkey and baboon, thereby, proving to Father Lorenzo that, contrary to his belief, even a Man of God will not possess the will to resist a confession, however absurd, while under torture, thereby, opening his eyes and spurring him to join the French Revolution (after being declared a heretic for his confession and being forced to flee Spain), and returning to Spain to put Father Inquisitor on trial and sentencing him to prison for his crimes against humanity and setting free those who have been detained for practicing witchcraft, only to witness the reversal of fortune when the English drove the French out of Spain and, with that, allowed Father Inquisitor to reinstate the Spanish Inquisition and put Lorenzo on trial for heresy - for which he was sentenced to death.

This art du art features commendable performances by the whole cast, is extremely well scripted by a screen wright - who has infused his script with a deep sense of the ironic, in an extremely well directed feature film that will catch the audience off guard with the twists and turn in the plot, and leave the audience pondering about the sordid history of Christianity and the wisdom of the French Revolution.

2941804,4,B000VHVT66,I came away from watching this film with very mixed feelings. The film is stunning in period imagery and many of the performances are really outstanding. The plot is intriguing enough and there are several surprises along the way. The historical aspect of seeing Spain in the late inquisition followed by the French invasion and then the British marching up from Portugal to drive out Napoleon's troops is very well captured in a compressed timeline. Excellent costuming and atmospherics contribute to a highly entertaining period piece. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that for me the involvement and chance encounters of the main characters during these tumultuous events strained believability to the breaking point. While that distracted me while watching I still recognized the beauty of the film and admire the attempt to tell a truly fascinating historical tale through the eyes of a handful of people including of course Goya. Bardem is convincingly evil and self- interested. Portman in a dual role is very good. Overall I'd recommend it.,1394496000,,1059,5.091954022988506

I purchased the movie primarily because of an interest in Goya, the man. At the end of it I had also reconfirmed my admiration for Javier Bardem (great in the role of Lorenzo, the antagonist) and once again, the lovely Natalie Portman in her role as Inez, Goya's artistic obsession as well as Bardem's sex (not love) interest.
Considering the fact that it is not seen as a high budget nor a high profile film, I found it remarkably well done, with a beautiful musical score to add to it all.
The story has many twists and turns, yet, in the end, the deaf Goya illustrates the madness of the world, beautifully seen in his etchings at the beginning and end of the movie in the faces of all he drew.
If I were to criticize the movie at all, it would be in the fact that, with the exception of Bardem, all the Spanish characters were much too Anglicized to be seen as Spaniards. Small point in an otherwise wonderful story, wonderfully told.",1373155200,,1057,4.425641025641026
2941811,5,B000VHVT66,"I picked this DVD up after having caught snatches of it on cable. Those snatches struck me as a very high quality multilevel period piece. It did not disappoint. The acting was uniformly high quality, and the fact that it hit so many moral themes that we would not touch with a ten foot pole were they taking place during contemporary times, raised in my mind how dominating Spanish influence has been on the development of Western society.

We tend to forget that even before England assumed the mantle of leader of the Western world, it was Spain that claimed and carried that mantle for nearly half a millennium after the decline of Rome. For better, and often for worse, it was Spanish moral, religious and political corruption that set the stage for modern Western democracies. It was Spain that expelled both the Jews and the Muslims, introduced African slavery, and the inquests to the Western world. It was Spanish Catholics that went along with and acquiesced to the political corruption of the crown.

Without being heavy handed, we see these flawed morals being played out in the subtext of this movie. It is disturbing, but honest and high level art.

The Spanish Inquisition is portrayed here in all its horrific idiocy, but this is more than a cautionary ""Don't let this happen again"" tale. It is also less a biography or true history. It instead weaves a tapestry of images that give a feeling of Spain in the late 1700's. There are many moving moments contained here and not many are joyful. There are some images and sequences that are not for the faint hearted.

Natalie Portman is very good throughout, though not always as convincing visually near the end. Stellan Skarsgard is marvelous throughout. I must say that I did enjoy this movie, but it is not happy. The end scene is very sad and yet a perfect conclusion to this story. I recommend it, but I must point out to you, this is not a ""date"" film.

2941816,5,B000VHVT66,"In spite of presenting Goya's great name in the title of the film he is kind of a side actor giving possibility director to show hard life of Spanish society in times of inquisition. The film is rich in historic facts and perfectly gives the idea of a female destiny in patriarch society.
The main character played by Nataly Portman is sentenced to suffering for a minor misdeed by the sacred inquisition extending horror on the territories of Europe in due time. She finds herself in a miserable prison for heretics and non-believers with tortures, hunger and absence of any light. Her change from a young lively beauty into ugly old sexless creature just brings tears to your eyes. Actor's work of Xavier Barden once again proves the genius of his terrifically realistic play. Transformation from a religious clergyman to a devoted revolutionary (in both cases promoting the ideas) is perfectly presented by him.
It was quite long ago since I couldn't even stop watching to get a cup of comforting coffee or go to the bathroom-) Watching that one just glued me to the screen!

Mr. Skarsgard (Bootstrap Bill Turner in Pirates of the Caribbean) isn't on the movie posters.  You see Javier Bardem and Natalie Portman (both Oscar Winners).

I debated giving this only 4 stars instead of 5 because it would have been nice if the accents of the non-Spanish actors had been more Spanish-sounding.  If Australian actors can mimic the American accent, why not foreigners mimic Spanish. HOWEVER, the story is so good, you can make yourself ignore the non-Spanish accents.

It is an exceptionally beautiful time-period movie -- in the visual sense (costumes, scenery).

It might not be so much a movie about Goya as it is a movie about the Spanish Inquisition ... and THAT will leave you breathless with how horrible religious persecution is.  It made me shake my head and think how did I ever even get here with what my ancestors, from wherever  they came from, had to survive!  Plagues! Wars! Religious Persecutions!  Ocean voyages!

Back to Goya, the artist and the artist in this movie -- you will now understand his UGLY etchings and drawings.  He depicts the victims of the injustice and cruelty of his time.  How HE managed to survive after daring to paint kings UGLY ...  was he giving his own indictment of anti-monarchy / anti-clerics?

Beautifully acted by ALL of the principal actors.

THIS IS AN ABSOLUTELY GREAT MOVIE. I'm giving it 5 Stars!  They do show Goya Art (just like the Van Gogh's in Lust for Life movie).

Every time I watch any inquisition scene, in any movie, I get all riled up. What touched me deeply is Natalie Portman's portrayal of the insane mother, tormented by traumatic memory of pain and lost love. I must give credit to the director for being able to create such strong a scene with so few expressions and scripts. In the last scene, Portman gives the best moment of the entire movie. I saw a glimpse of that mythic thing that pretty much makes the world go around, a glimpse of love, even through the disfigured gesture of an insane face. Good show.

2941821,5,B000VHVT66,"Others have summarized the plot and Goya's painting. There is an underling message in the movie that is not being commented on: humans have desires for power, wealth, sex, hate, love, and beauty. The methods used to achieve these are vividly portrayed in the movie. The justifications are for the most part a coverup to protect the individual from being exposed that he is taking advantage of the circumstances to benefit himself.

The Catholic Church employed the Inquisition as a form of ""cleansing"" in the guise of love for Jesus. There are lots of examples in the last 2 decades of ""protecting"" the populace by torturing and killing ""enemies"". The men who did the interrogation were fanatics and those who did the torture enjoyed their hatred of other humans. The merchant offered a bribe to get his daughter freed, but the inquisitors who would materially benefit claimed it was just a donation of a loyal Catholic. Political donations are bribes. Financial advisers take their fees while telling you they are increasing your wealth.

Those who are supposed to be the protectors take advantage of their position for sex- politicians, clergy, coaches. The French courts punished past evildoers but also innocents who were falsely condemned by personal enemies. In the movie the judges are signing the death warrant before the ""trial"" is even over. Watch the movie and you will see many additional examples

The movie helps you picture the terrors and frustration of the period. It helps you see the superb craftsmanship of the time. I would not characterize the movie as entertainment. It's value is taking a look at how cruel humans can be to each other when they are driven by power or the inherent competitiveness between humans. Even today humans justify their feelings and actions because the target is another nationality, race, religion, age, sex, personality, social or financial group, or is a competitor.",1339804800,2,1918,5.044164037854889

2941825,4,B000VHVT66,"This is a good film, but not a great film. It misses the mark because it is a dark tale and it does not go far enough into the darkness to convince us of its authenticity. Whereas many may have wished that Milos Forman had produced another Amadeus, Goya's Ghost suffers by backing away from the horror it should have depicted. The film wisely placed the outstanding artist Goya as an observer of cruelty, corruption, and chaos. Thus we see much of the film through the moral eyes of the artist Goya. Yet, the film tries too hard to entertain. When three French soldiers rape a Spanish young woman, the bright costumes and half-hearted slapstick struggle is not convincing. Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Spain under the ideological cover of overthrowing the incompetent decadent Bourbon family. Instead he met considerable insurgency from the Spanish people who hated the French invaders more than they hated to incompetent Bourbon family. But the nastiness of this terrible confrontation is caught by Goya's amazing paintings and prints but is not really captured on film. The film is educating for those who are not familiar with the political and social conditions during the time that Goya was the favorite painter of King Carlos IV and his wife, Queen Maria Luisa. Carlos is depicted as not especially bright and Maria Luisa is depicted, accurately, as the dominant partner in the marriage who was known for her love affairs. Goya is accurately pictured as the court painter, managing the challenges of painting some homely royalty in a manner that would please them but also retain the integrity of his artistic vision. Goya also is known for his paintings and prints of the Spanish Inquisition, a cruel and terrible institution by which the Roman Catholic Church practiced torture and murder in the name of religious doctrine and ideology. Goya is also known for his series of gory prints of the scenes of cruelty imposed on the Spanish peasants by the French soldiers as well as by the soldiers on the Spanish peasants. All are guilty in Goya's world. But the film should have been darker to fully capture the ignorance and cruelty of the times. After investing millions of dollars in this film, certainly there would be the temptation to `lighten up' and not fully immerse the viewer into the darkness that was Spain at this time in history, but by not going far enough the viewer is left with a somewhat confusing reaction to the entire film.

Francisco Goya is played by Stellan Skarsgard, who does a great job of portraying an ethical and moral actor in a world of chaos. His primary patrons, Carlos IV played perfectly by Randy Quaid and Queen Maria Luisa, played by Blanca Portillo, are engaging and entertaining. But it is the Inquisition activist monk, Brother Lorenzo, for whom this story really revolves. The constantly changing fortunes of Lorenzo depict the turmoil of the times. It is Lorenzo's fall from grace, his rise to power, and then his second fall which is the primary character development and trajectory of the film. Javier Bardem plays him well. His fall and rise and fall are contrasted against that of the victim, Ines, played by Natalie Portman. This poor character is victimized by the terror of the Inquisition, revealing the incredible bigotry of the Catholic Church toward the Jewish people. Her poor parents try to gain her release but to no avail. Here Foreman missed the mark. He depicts this wealthy family as being in distress at the arrest and imprisonment of their daughter, but he stops short of capturing and expressing the complete terror that such events would have for a family. Foreman makes the mistake of trying to tell a tale of horror, torture, cruelty, murder, and injustice but he also tries too hard to entertain",1331510400,2,3767,4.876755070202808
2941826,2,B000VHVT66,"I don't get casting directors. Do they really think putting Natalie Portman in a movie will drive the box office especially when she plays a Spanish woman? I guess in the entire nation of Spain there are no beautiful Spanish actresses capable of playing this role. The hilarious thing is she plays both the mother and the daughter yet the poor makeup job makes both look exactly the same age.

Add to this the actor playing the painter Francisco Goya is Swedish and American Randy Quaid plays the Spanish king. OK, I get actors can play people of other nationalities but get real.

Plus this movie is not really about Goya at all and is supposed to be about what Goya observes during the Inquisition and the French invasion of Spain. Although I half expected No Country Bardem to pull out the air pump and kill Portman or a few Spanish priests, he sadly did not. It would have made this movie about as plausible as the casting.

In the ""making of"" featurette, Milos Forman claims this is a story the world has been waiting to see on the big screen. Really? People were dying to hear of the Spanish Inquisition starring Natalie Portman? I think Monty Python did it better, funnier and got the point across--these people back then were power hungry and insane.

Let's put it this way even the Spanish thought Forman's take was dreadful as it grossed barely over $2 million at the box office there and only $8 million worldwide.

To be honest, other than One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest back in 1975, Forman makes pretentious twaddle even his hits like Amadeus. Come on, man, someone should have told you the plot alone was a convoluted mess let alone the casting.",1328832000,2,1661,4.579124579124579

Go to the Internet Movie Database (IMDB.com) and you'll find this on the list near the top as one of the movies you must see before you die. Very engaging story and more or less historically accurate. It is rated R due to the torture scenes where Natalie Portman is shown nude from the side with her long hair covering her breasts (one may see the side of her buttocks and thigh). There is also a rape scene (implied) with her character as the victim. This is presented as a key aspect of the story and is faithful in it's representation. Albeit, some may not want their children to view this sort of content (even though they've probably already seen much worse).

2941829,5,B000VHVT66,"This 2006 film, set in the 1700's in Spain during the time of the Inquisition got panned by all the critics.  Many of the historical details are wrong, the acting is considered ""over the top"",  and the plot thought of as confused and the pacing too slow.  Of all the critics who reviewed it, only 26% liked it.

However, from the moment the film opened I couldn't get my eyes off the screen.  I loved the pomp and spectacular setting, I thought the acting was terrific and in my mind there wasn't a dull moment.  O.K. - I didn't know much about this particular period of history and had no way of knowing the historical accuracy of the the plot. But. after all, this was a fictional movie, produced for entertainment.

Staring Javier Bardem as Lorenzo, a priest during the Inquisition and Stellan Skarsgard as Franciso Goya, the painter, the film opens as the wicked priest is looking for heretics to torture.  Natalie Portman is a cast as young woman whose portrait had just been painted by Goya.  She comes from a wealthy merchant family and is leading a happy life.  But the bad priest has her arrested and tortured until she confesses that the reason she declined to eat pork was because she was a secret Jew.  In spite of her father giving a fortune to the Church, she is kept in prison and raped by the priest. The father also embarrasses the Priest by entrapping him in what seems like a good way to prove his daughter's innocence, forcing the priest to flee the country but still not releasing the daughter from the horrors of the Inquisition.  Fifteen years pass.  Napoleon invades Spain and the former priest has become a wealthy Frenchman.  After all this time in the horrible jail, the daughter is now an ugly half-mad crone who is searching for her daughter who was born in jail.  Goya helps the daughter out and the plot thickens.

I found all this fascinating and wasn't bored for a moment.  There was a lot of pomp, great costumes and good depictions of  both the splendor and horror of the time and the place.  Acting was good.  And the plot had enough twists and turns to keep me interested.  I really enjoyed this movie.  It might not have really happened this way but I personally didn't care about this.  I just watched the whole thing through and enjoyed it.",1311292800,3,2280,4.52078239608802
2941830,5,B000VHVT66,"This movie shows you what religious fanaticism and the non-separation of church and state can lead to. Once upon a time the nations of Europe were basically Christian theocracies and we had the Catholic church arresting people for heretical ""crimes"" such as being gay or practicing Judiasm in secret.

Those arrested had no rights and would be tortured to confess. Movies like this are an important reminder as to why theocracies are so bad and why the separation of Church and State is so important.",1308009600,2,500,4.882352941176471

A really brilliant film that succeeds in putting the artist at the center. If you too are a Goya fan you will enjoy seeing the way his etchings and paintings come to life.
It's hard to picture how someone who is not amazed and delighted by Goya would appreciate this film. It's epic, it's horrifying and beautiful, and it's got such a bitter, sly sense of humor that some people might miss a lot of the visual jests. It may take either a familiarity with the work or a willingness to watch the film more than once. But give it a try, open your mind and your eyes, and you may be rewarded.
Every bit of it is crafted like a gem. It doesn't follow a predictable format and maybe it's too grim for some critics, but it captures the times with a little of the same unerring horror and genius of the great painter himself. Highly recommended.",1305417600,,1019,4.257731958762887
2941832,2,B000VHVT66,"Milos Forman has made some good movies and was awarded 2 Best Director Oscars for his past work: `One flew over the Cuckoo Nest' and later `Amadeus' were also successful in the market place.
I don't know how the market reacted to `Goya's Ghosts', but I know that I was rather disgusted myself. Poor Goya got hijacked for a trashy pulp film. His drawings of the Inquisition and of the French invasion under Napoleon serve as excuse for a wild, vulgar, violent monster story.
Stellan Skarsgrd seems to look like the real Goya and does a decent if not so complicated job. Many scenes from the film look like Goya's drawings.

Nathalie Portman has a triple role: she is the innocent young woman who gets dragged into the wheels of the Inquisition under suspicion of practicing Judaism (because she refused to eat pork in a tavern while spies watched); she is the same woman after 15 years in the dungeon, with her mind deranged (which also gives Forman another chance at going into a mental institution); and she is her own daughter as a 15 y old prostitute.

Bardem is the ultimate piece of opportunist manure: first an inquisition Jacobin, then a Spanish Quisling in French service, always at the forefront of the respective ideology. Incidentally he is also Portman's rapist and the father of her daughter.

If you want to know more about Goya, go elsewhere.
If you want to know more about the inquisition, go elsewhere.

2941833,4,B000VHVT66,"I think Milos Forman's quote gives a good idea to the viewers who wanted to see the biopic of the Spanish Painter, Francisco Goya, that the painter would not be a main character of the film. Memories of his own childhood and youth, reflection on the years spent under the suffocating power of the oppressive political regimes are the main subjects of his film that takes place in Spain of the late 18th -beginning of the 19th centuries and focuses realistically on the role of the Inquisition and its end under Napoleon's rule. Forman was a college student when he read and studied the book about Spanish Inquisition that affected all aspects in the lives of the ordinary people but it took him many years to envision the film that would bring his reflection to life through the paintings, drawings and prints of the great Artist who had captured the spirit of those times brilliantly.

I personally love ""Goya's Ghosts. Visually, it was just like Goya's painting spanned in time and space.  I've always admired Goya, ever since I read the novel by Lion Feuchtwanger, and saw Goya's paintings and prints first as a teenager in reproductions and Art books. Few years ago I saw many of his originals for the first time in Prado, Madrid. They were very different - dark, twisted, macabre, sensual, serene, tender, satiric, realistic, romantic, hallucinatory, surreal, very Spanish yet universal in their understanding of human nature. ""Everyone wants to seem what they are not, all deceive each other and no-one knows himself,"" wrote Francisco Goya on one of his prints.  His works are strange mixture of horror and hope, monsters born while the mind wonders in the dream world (the series Los Capriccios), the formal portraits of the royal family with not a single flattering image. They were created during the times when Inquisition ruled the country with an iron hand, and the time is the real hero of the Milos Forman's movie. Goya has been regarded both as the last of the Old Masters and as the first of the moderns. It is not just a coincidence that Goya lived and created his paintings and prints that captured closely the time when Spain was changing slowly from old times to new modern epoch but how slow and painful the changes were.  The story in the movie may seem too blizzard and implausible but if you look closer in the movie's images, you'd realize that the characters of the story, the whole surrealistic and wild content came directly from Goya's works, his paintings, drawings, and prints. He lived through surreal time, and the time got a fascinating treatment in his works and in the work of the great modern film director, Milos Forman. The final scene of the film with all Goya's ghosts presented and with him capturing the bitterly ironic in their grotesque absurdity images in his sketch book is a masterwork of cinema.",1298678400,3,2844,4.786150712830957

one of the chief inquisitors Brother Lorenzo (Javier Bardem) has also become on of Goya's clients. He visits Ines after she has been tortured and forced to sing a confession . He prays with and then rapes her. Goya accompanies Lorenzo to the mansion of Ines' father Tomas Bilbatua (Jos Luis Gmez). Lorenzo refuses to intervene to free his daughter maintaining that  she was put to the 'question' and if one is innocent G-D will give one the fortitude to withstand the pain of torture and not to confess.
Bilbatua then prevents Lorenzo from leaving , has him tortured and forced to sign a confession that he is the bastard child of chimpanzees who has infiltrated the church
to destroy it.
When Lorenzo cannot secure Inez release, Bilbatua delivers his confession to the King Carlos IV and Lorenzo is declared an enemy of the Church and forced to flee Spain
15 years later the Napoleonic forces 'liberate' Spain but soon prove that the revolutionary principles of equality liberty brotherhood and 'reason'  they aim to force on Spain can be practised with the same amount of brutlaity and evil as can religious fundamentalism.

Lorenzo return to Spain as a fiery revolutionary. The victims of the Inquistion are released but the new order is no better than the old and Ines finds her family have been massacred

Lorenzo has Ines cast into an asylum and when her daughter is discovered working as a prostitute attempts to have her shipped to America
I will end the narrative there so as not to spoil the ending.
suffice to say Portman's versatility as a beautiful young woman and cast as a haggard ,crippled and half mad victim of torture and incarceration is mind blowing.

The story itself will really get you thinking and will stay with you long after the movie is over.  It's a tragic but interesting story set during the Spanish inquisition and the French Revolution, showing an innocent young woman's life completely destroyed by the chaotic political scene of the time.  Though heart-breaking, the story is fascinating because it reminds you of how fragile our lives really are, and how forces beyond our control can turn life onto a completely different path.
  The only thing I didn't really get and why I rated the movie at four stars, not five, was that although the title is Goya's Ghosts, Goya himself is really just an observer to the main storyline.  He doesn't play an important role in the story at all, and as I watched it there came a point when I thought, why is this character even in here?  It was like he was getting in the way of this really fascinating movie, and I found it annoying.

2941839,4,B000VHVT66,"No question that Milos Forman knows how to achieve powerful effects with film. Unfortunately, in this fantasy on the paintings and prints of Goya, the framework is weak. In spots one gets cinematic highlights and effective interaction of characters, in other spots, however, one gets the most hoary of film images and situations. Except for a few scenes, where an image is allowed which would have been banned by the Hayes Office, one could imagine oneself watching, once more, an Irving Thalberg film starring his wife, Norma Shearer, such as Marie Antoinette (although nobody in this film resembles the hero of that one, beautiful Tyrone Power). Beyond that weakness, the story itself lacks a sense of filmatic inevitability. In key segments, one gets the feeling that they appear to appease the creators need to get the scene in, rather than because they had to happen. That sense, that some particular action grows from the nature of the film's reality, is crucial to a fine film; in other words, in reality the action may be ridiculously unreal, but in the film it clearly arises from necessity.
Despite these criticisms, for most of us, this film is worth the time taken to watch it. One will enjoy the photography and scenic design; one will find some of the acting and scenes quite appealing.

This fictional movie focuses on the real life Spanish painter, Francisco Goya (Stellan Skarsgard), his muse, Ines (Natalie Portman), and an Inquisitor, Brother Lorenzo (Javier Bardem). When Ines is taken captive by the inquisition and forced to make a false confession these lives become entangled in ways they never would have guessed. During the tumultuous years of the Inquisition, and then the invasion by Napoleon's forces, these people's lives are thrown into a kind of madness when their world's are thrown upside down. The scenes in the movie are interesting in that they are often recreations of Goya's own paintings, drawings and etchings. One feels like one is experiencing something of this great painter's life, with the surroundings and people that formed the basis for his works.

The movie looks very good for a dvd with rich colours and good clarity, and with a Dolby 5.1 soundtrack that pulses to life with its orchestral track and details of sound.

I like historical films, and yes history isn't very pretty at times.  The Spanish Inquisition, as portrayed in this film, and the human suffering of innocent souls I found deeply disturbing.

Not that the movie itself was poorly done in acting or cinematography, it was merely the story itself that broke my heart.  Natalie Portman's portrayal was wonderful, I will say that much. Your heart breaks for her suffering and her condition after 15 years of being cruelly tortured and locked up for turning away a pork dinner.

I do not enjoy watching the ""dark side"" of humanity in centuries past, and the ignorance the church portrayed as messengers of a loving Christ by torturing individuals when ""put to the question."" It disturbed me deeply.  However, when I think of the inhumane things we as humans still do to one another in the name of God, I don't think we've really evolved much since the inquisition, have we?

Coming as it does at the tale end of the Inquisition in Spain and with the rise of the French Revolution,the Napoleonic invasion that is supposed to overthrow all feudalism. The Church must shore itself up against the profanities and absurdities depicted in Goya's Los Capricchos Lorenzo (Bardem) is friendly with Goya(Skarsgard) and is getting his portrait painted. Goya's muse is Inez (Portman), whose portrait he is painting and using her image to depict angels on church ceilings. Lorenzo, ambitious for power, suggests to the committee of the Inquisition going back`to old methods',using techniques like torture(""putting someone to the Question"") to increase Catholicism's hold on disobedience and heresy. Inez is spied on in an inn turning her nose up at pork. She is taken into the Inquisition's Offices and asked if she did this. She does not deny it. She is put to the question and confesses to practising as a Jew. She is thrown into a dungeon and later visited by Lorenzo. He offers her prayer but also rapes her. Goya is asked by Tomas (Gomez),the father of Inez,if he can help get her out of prison. Goya arranges for Lorenzo to come to Tomas's house for a meal. Tomas has already offered substantial offerings to a chapel and asks if Inez can be released but Lorenzo just reiterates she's been put to the question,confessed and will go to trial. Tomas says that you can get a tortured person to confess to anything,demonstrating this,by torturing Lorenzo to sign the confession he is the bastard child of chimpanzees and joined the church to destroy it. Tomas tells him he'll keep this confession until his daughter is released,showing it later to the king,CarlosIV(Randy Quaid).The king has been shown out with a hunting party,shooting vultures and rabbits. He is shown in scenes at court with Queen Maria and she has had her painting done by Goya on horseback. He hears of King Louis's execution in France. He himself is a Bourbon and dreads the news. He plays violin to Goya.

The 2nd part shows events 15 years later the French think they'll be welcomed as liberators by the Spanish. Goya's liberalism welcomes the revolutionary French but we soon flip to his prints of The Calamities of War after the rape and pillage followed by Napolean enthroning his brother Joseph as king. The French declare the Inquisition a void and free the prisoners,sending toFrance many Spanish art works. Inez knocks on Goya's door having found her family all dead. She asks him to find her daughter. Lorenzo is now a Buornopartist and sends Inez to an asylum and searches through orphanages for his daughter Alice. He condemns the Inquisitor General to death. Goya discovers Alice working as a prostitute in a park and informs Lorenzo,who later gets prostitutes rounded up to be sent to America. Goya purchases Inez's freedom to reintroduce her to her daughter. Then English soldiers invade and drive out the French reinstituting the church. Lorenzo is captured,sentenced to death unless he repents. The 2nd part is bombastic and melodramatic,historical soap-opera,with the gap of 15 years. There are too many implausibilities: Lorenzo's rape of Inez in the dungeon,his conversion from Inquisitor priest to Republican revolutionary. All this is served up with a pot-pourri of English accents,with Spaniard Bardem's the most mannered. I did think it attempted a sweep of historical epic proportions,but lost its focus on character and narrative direction with too many changes and events. The cinematography is excellent,the rich painterly colouring and sumptuous set design. Skarsgard's Goya is a Candide-like observer,but is not given enough personality. His deafness is conveyed. Instead his satirical prints are used to tie things together. Bardem's Lorenzo is the central character,displaying charisma and intensity,without explaining his motivation. Portman was good in 3 roles as herself at different ages or as her daughter. The script by Carriere is patchy,bizarre and fails. This from a man who'd worked with Bunuel,whoidentified with Goya's sense of the absurd and worked with Forman before,makes the failure greater. The goal to depict an age never before filmed,showing it's evil,cruelty,irrationality and hysteria was in itself admirable. But let's get a proper film of Goya and his works.

I'm putting this ""PS"" at the beginning of my review, and not at the end of it, because this IS so important.  PLEASE read this PS, and, if you so desire, tell other people its message....

As this movie deals with the Spanish Inquistion, and brings up religious discusssions in general, I'd like to mention a recent religius discusssion I had, quite unexpectedly, with a new, Moslem neighbour of mine.  I generally like my privacy, and don't discuss much, (and try to be seen little), with my neighbours.  They're nice people -- it's just that I like my privacy.  However, I was waiting by the elevator, near the front door, of our building, to reject a package I had mistakenly ordered, so meeting with negibours was unavoidable.  I got into a conversation with this nice guy, eventually mentioning to him my own theory that I've had for a while, that God made up all these different religions to see how and if we all got along together.  This nice guy, a Moslem, informed me that THIS IDEA THAT I THOUGHT I HAD MADE UP BY MYSELF, WAS ACTUALLY IN THE KORAN!  I said, ""You're kidding!""  He smiled and said, ""No--it's in there!""  Well, I guess I DID make it up, because before last week, I never knew it WAS in the Koran.  And, if it IS in the Koran....  Isn't it then a sin for those believing in Islam to go on a ""Jihad"", and try to make everyone a Moslem?  I mean, it's in the Koran not only that God created all these religions, but also WHY He did!  Converting Everyone to Islam would distroy this purpose, wouldn't it?  If you have a mind to, please feel free to postulate this theory with any Moslem person you may meet! Permission is here totally granted!  I know I will discuss this with my nice Moslem neighbour, if and when I ever bump into him again.  I don't know what he thinks of this, but I do know this.  When I said I have nothing against ""fundamentalists"", that Jimmy Carter is a ""fundamentalist"", believing in his own religion, but also respecting and honouring other traditions, and that the people I dislike are not ""fundamentalists"", but FANATICS, my neighbour smiled in agreement!  Hopefully, other people of many faiths think the same way.  If this is true....maybe people HAVE come a long way from the Spanish Inquistion, after all.  That is, at least SOME people have....(shudder!)

M A I N.....R E V I E W..:

This is a cohesive, immensely followable film, that holds one's interest from beginning to end.  Although a work of fiction, this film -- as historical fiction -- still needed to be grounded on historical FACT to be credible.  What was INcredible to me was that the Inquisition, (started in 1492 by Ferdinand and Isabella -- yes, THAT Ferdinand and Isabella, who gave Columbus the money he needed to explore the Indies...and resulted instead in the discovery of the Americas -- the New World), was still around in 1792, when the story begins!

In the story, INES, (portrayed by NATALIE PORTMAN, who from the first scene onward, shows herself to be versatile in many different situations, and is here quite different from her most famous role, that of Queen Amidala in the ""Star Wars"" series.)  Here, Ines is a beautiful young lady and daughter of a rich merchant.  She is intelligent, but her station in life has obviously kept her from experiencing any of the darker things life can hold.  She is happy in the home of an obviously loving mother and father, and brothers.  Inez is posing to give inspiration, to Francisco Goya, the famous Spanish painter, and a family friend.  Later, Ines accompanies her brothers to a local tavern, and, with them, enjoys the atmosphere, as well as food and drink.

The next day, Ines is summoned by the Inquisition! She and her parents, and her two brothers. and even their servants, are all terrified.  They all know what the Inquisition could do...and besides, whatever could she have done that was wrong?

When she goes to the Inquistion,they ask her her name, and what she did the day before.  Yes, she went the tavern.  Yes, she ate chicken and vegetables there.  No, she did not eat any of the pork that was offered her -- because, as she innoently remarks, she just doesn't like the TASTE of pork.

But the Inquisition sees thing sifferently.  Her not eating pork, signifies to them, that she has secretly been practicing Judaism!  (To the modern mind, this is akin to accusing someone of being a communist, because they like wearing the colour red -- but the Inquisition, (and perhaps Joe McCarthy, too), were in dead earnest.

Complicating this is the fact that is broght up later, when a friar, comes to dinner.  He reveals a fact known to the Inquisition, and to Inez father -- but to no one else.  And that is that the family CONVERTED from Judaism to Catholicism about 125 years earlier, when immigrating from Holland.  Heavens -- was Inez backsliding?

(( Poor Ines! She obviously did NOT want re-convert to the Judaism her family had left behind a century and a quarter before. I don't even think she even knew that pork is forbidden to Jews. If she HAD known about Jewish Law, she would have been able to tell the Inquisition that Jewish Law says that the MOST imporant thing to do is STAY ALIVE, no matter what you must eat. If kosher food is not available, you MUST eat the non-kosher meat, stay alive, and help the continuity of the Jewish people. Therefore, if she DID want to covert to Judaism, she WOULD have eaten the pork, just to put on a show for those who might be watching. Some Jews did just this -- pretend to be Catholic in public, and only secretly practiced Judaism.  These were called ""Marranos"". Some Jews, of course, did not even want to pretend to be non-Jews, and never converted, even publicly.  They -- along with others who commited ANYTHING considered an abberation by the Inquisition -- being a Protestant, a Free-Thinker, a believer in abortion, etc -- were called ""Heretics"".  But the fact that she DIDN'T eat the pork shows Ines WAS telling the truth -- she just didn't like the taste!  Of course, then the Inquisition would have asked her how she knew about this -- and tortured her anyway.

At any rate, Francisco Goya tells a friend of his, a prelate, about the problem, and asks him to try to intercede with the Church and bring Ines home.  The priest visits Ines in the dungeons of the Inquisition, and promises to bring home her message to her family that she loves them all.  At Ines' family's home, the priest explains that, since torture has already made Ines confess, he can do nothing.  Her father, however, has other plans.  He draws up a ""confession"" paper, wherein he asks the priest to sign, and reveal the ""terrible secret"" of the priest's past: that he, the priest, though masquerading as a human being, is actually the illegitmate son of a chimpanze and an orangatan!  The priest says he will never sign such a ridiculus document -- but, under the mildest of tortures, finally does.  Thus, he learns that the Inquistion's doctrine -- that an innocent person will never confess, no matter how awful the torture, (because God will give the innocent the strength to endure) -- is false.  But he cannot convince his superiours of his.  Ines stays in the dungeons.  And -- worse than this -- when the priest takes this message to Ines, he, struck by her beauty, does an entirely UN-priestly action.....(XXX)

The story continues 15 years later.  Ines is still in prison.  Francisco Goya has gone deaf, and the priest has left his order, and is now a fugitive from the Inquision.  By this time, NAPOLEON has arrived in Spain!  The year is 1813, and it is only now that
the victorious Napoleon abolishes the Inquistion, and frees the remaining prisoners of the Inquistion.  The Spanish Inquisition thus lasted for the astounding time-period of THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY- ONE YEARS! Although Ines and her family may be fictious characters, THIS historic timeline is all too sadly true.....

Ines has had a daughter by the priest, and the film now shifts to Goya's efforts to bring mother and daughter together.  The priest re-enters the story, and .....well, it continues to show what happens to these involving, 3-D characters.

This movie holds the attention from beginning to end.  The story is riviting, the acting involving, the scenery and costumes realistically magnificent, and magnificiently chilling.  The music is almost too atmospheric -- it is tuneful and evocative of every mood in the movie.....

In the end, this is a story of how fanaticism can ruin lives.  One hope this sort of thing never happens again....  Although, with
both Moslem, Christian, (AND ""One World Order"") fanatics, very much alive, well, and all-too-active....as well as even Jewish groups urging Jews to be more religious, (and even seeking out converts among non-Jewish people!), the rational, realistic person still must sadly realize that fanaticism is still all-too-much around, in the hearts and minds of far too many people, even today.  GOYA'S GHOSTS, therefore, is a movie that deserves a far wider viewing audience.  Hopefully, upon watching it, many people will reach the same conclusion I have: Believe what you want, to make you happy.  But be sure to RESPECT other people and other beliefs. If one believes that God is Love, there can be no other way to direct one's thoughts!",1258934400,3,9336,4.687960687960688
2941850,2,B000VHVT66,"I watched this movie with high expectations in mind mainly because of the highly acclaimed director, the casting (especially Natalie Portman), and genre. However, I was disappointed as this seemed to be a surreal, directionless look at 18th century(and beginning of 19th) Spain. Each scene was stunningly beautiful to gaze upon, but it flip-flopped between ideas and the focus seemed to shift every 10 minutes or so.

The first hour or so promises an excellent movie but then it disintegrates into a soup of machinations and violence. The ending seemed oddly predictable as well as disappointing.

2941852,2,B000VHVT66,"Titles are usually a cue to what a film might elucidate. However, in Forman's most recent foray into C18th fin de siecle court life(Amadeus), neither Goya or his ghost amount to much. Indeed, Goya, who like most of the cast, looks the part, is very much an observer to the film's limply developed dramatic interest, conveyed by Javier and Postman and a cast of church and court characters. With respect to fidelity of appearance, the sets and costumes are exemplary, topped by Randy Quade as the mediocre King Charles(absolutely loved his cameo). The role of the church and the Question, as the Inquisition euphemistically refers to its mode of torture, is the film's real business. The highlight of its dreary passage comes when Javier is hoisted by the arms over the rich merchant's banquet table and given a taste of his own medicine. It's one of the few moments when we feel what mostly remains as spectacle. Goya's portrait of him is publicly burned as the Church denounces him. this coincides with the onset of Goya's deafness, an odd link -something that, of course, would need to be introduced in any bio-pic of the artist. though most accounts of Goya give significant leverage to this disease as a factor in his developing visual language, Forman does little with it. At this point, the priest's furtive laison with the the falsely accused, merchant's daughter(Portman) and his subsequent betrayal of the church, dominates the script. In swift succession Napoleon's troops invade Madrid, fifteen years transpire and Goya's voice-over explains his deafness. And the dramatic interest degenerates into a series of lifless set pieces. While war collateral, hospital, court and asylum scenes inspired actual Goya imagery(and we are given a credible demonstration of the etching technique) Forman's efforts never achieve  the clout of the Goyas'. Hollywood sentiment is writ large. the final scene is unforgivably saccharine. The intended interest in the relationship with flawed priest and femme fatale might have worked had some chemistry exist between them. Unfortunately Portman's acting lacks Javier's presence. If she is playing an historical figure of the  kind that lusty old Francisco might base a naked maja upon, this ain't the girl. Her scant effort to disguise an American accent detracts. The title might reasonably have suggested an exploration of events that lead to the peerless suite of dark paintings, now appropriately in a room of their own in the Prado. Given how Forman measured his imaginative abilities against Goya's, it's little wonder he has left the master's epiphanies untouched. Goya remains peripheral, the 'ghost' in a film purportedly about him.",1249430400,,2684,5.196304849884527

It was criticized primarily for being too slow and having a convoluted plot.  I suppose I can see where those points might have merit but I found Goya's Ghosts pros to far outweigh the cons.  So much so I was very close to giving this a five star rating.  My one true hang-up was that the film is a Spanish production shot in English.  Odd, and the mix of accents can be slightly annoying in flashes.

The performances here from Stellan Skarsgrd, Javier Bardem, and Natalie Portman are highlights in all of their careers.  This is probably the only time besides&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Country-for-Old-Men/dp/B0011BE3K0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Country for Old Men</a>&nbsp;that I really watched Bardem.  In the first half of this film Bardem plays a character that is behaviorally not very different from his role in 2007's best picture Oscar winner, but as Goya's Ghosts moves forward his character changes and Bardem's depth is on display.  He really is a great actor.  Portman on the other hand has always been touted as great for her potential but has never really had a showcase role.  Here she does, and unfortunately no one saw it.  Portman is a legitimate super-talent that only gets these tiny opportunities to show that off to the mainstream.  Something tells me she doesn't care about that but it would be nice to see her land a big budget Oscar bait role where she can really get the credit she deserves.  Stellan Skarsgrd is good in almost everything he has ever done.  Moreover, the supporting cast is also strong.  Especially the performance of unlikely cast member Randy Quaid. That's right, I said Randy Quaid, who plays King Carlos IV.

The film is set in late 18th century Spain during the time of the French Revolution.  Goya (Skarsgrd), a famous artist for Spanish royalty, seemingly becomes a target from the inquisition.  Lorenzo, a monk who soon becomes in charge of the inquisition's more intense initiatives, defends Goya.  Lorenzo actually becomes a subject of one of Goya's paintings.  Ins (Portman), a Goya muse, is soon targeted by the inquisition.  This brings microcosmic conflict between many of the film's characters while the macrocosmic conflicts of the time period shift the characters even more profoundly.  This makes for some very interesting and unpredictable circumstances.  So much so, that it might be best to leave the rest unmentioned here.  Suffice to say, I enjoyed this film far more than I thought I would.

Goya's Ghosts references his paintings effectively and although the film may be guilty of unlikely coincidences, some melodrama, and some historical inaccuracy; it is certainly no more guilty of those things than other period pieces that are widely acclaimed by today's critics.  Goya is the straight man of Goya's Ghosts, he is the observer and his work is used toward the narrative while the film is used as a tribute of sorts toward his work.  I see Goya's Ghosts as being one par with both One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Amadeus. Perhaps if Foreman were appreciated today like he was twenty or thirty years ago critics would've received this film with the same level of praise?  Not sure, but I'm recommending this.",1233014400,6,3740,5.489510489510489

It is never made clear why the beautiful young girl is really singled out for torture and permanent imprisonment. If it is hinted that she is intended to implicate someone else, it never happens.

2941858,3,B000VHVT66,"SPOILER WARNING (Do not read the last paragraph if you have not seen this movie or do not want to know what happens)
Goya's Ghosts came highly recommended to me, and given Javier's fabulous performance in No Country For Old Men, I was sold. I bought it and eagerly popped it in. Unfortunately, I just couldn't buy the hype. Bardem is great, of course. This is just the type of devious role that he really breathes life into. Nearly every other actor, however, brings the film down. Natalie Portman, to start, is kind of a mixed bag. She plays a rather unremarkable young woman, who of course is Goya's heaven-sent muse. After being locked in a dungeon for years, she goes a little crazy and pasty, and this brings her overall performance in the film to a solid B as she imitates a broken jaw and a handful of psychoses. Then, she plays the DAUGHTER of her character, while they both are still alive, and goes back to plain old bland. I do wonder, however, if she has some kind of fetish for playing weird roles where they deform her (queen Amidala, V for Vendetta, perhaps others I can't remember...)
Also Randy Quaid plays the King of Spain. He has a wonderful air of regality. No, not really. This is the guy who played the dad in Independence Day and Cousin Ed in the National Lampoon Vacation movies. He hasn't got a regal bone in his body, and he's nearly the WORST actor I could think of for a dramatic role (except for maybe... Natalie Portman?)
Aside from this, the movie is just a little too wide in scope to be seen as an insular, complete story. It covers about 30 years and three generations in two hours, and kind of leaves each epoch a mess, with little or no sense of resolution. At the end of the film, Bardem's character is killed by the church for his rebellion and carted off through the streets of Spain while kids chase it, and a song that means roughly ""oh, what a bad world, where a man hurts so bad he wants to kill himself"" in Spanish plays. At that point, you realize that all the other stuff was just window-dressing and pretension of drama, while it was really an Inquisition-era No Country For Old Men, a film to give Javier Bardem a role that steals the show with little other reason for watching. The only other plus of this movie, beyond his acting, is the beautiful Spanish scenery and location design which simply cannot be beaten. Too bad, then, that most of the cast is less interesting than the backdrop.",1220745600,,2441,4.4387527839643655
2941859,5,B000VHVT66,"Centered on the horrid Spanish Inquisition, this story explores the sins of those in power, committed in the name of God.  An arrogant priest, Lorenzo played by the talented Javier Bardem, believes torture is the key to bringing society closer to morality.  Lorenzo's artist friend, Goya, begs for the priest's help when one of his young models, Inez, is falsely accused and imprisoned for heresy. Lorenzo is not only unable to free the young girl, but impregnates her while she's confined in her cell.  Inez is tortured until she confesses to a sin she is not guilty of. When Lorenzo gets put to the 'torture test' himself by the young girl's father, and fails, he must leave town. When Lorenzo returns he causes even more trouble for Inez. This is an intense drama that gives us a small glimpse into a tumultous time in history.  Superb acting!

2941860,5,B000VHVT66,"It's 1792. Spain as well as the rest of Europe is at the eve of one of the greatest breakthroughs of the Humanity. Francisco de Goya is the real painter of the King and certainly the best of Spain at that moment. His muse is an alluring teenager Ines, daughter of a wealthy family.

But the wings of the moral degradation dressed with Holy clothes finds a reason to imprison her once the Brother Lorenzo a sort of little Savonarola induces the Holy Office to restore the moral authority and bring back the Church the ancient fears and missed respect in those times of sacrilege and heresy.

Ines is captured in the tavern and supposedly accused of Jewish rituals because her linage involves her with a Jewish converted to Catholicism, 168 years before.

This fact will become the dramatic premise for this tragic story when the Brother Lorenzo will use and exert all his influence to abuse her. Soon he is unmasked and expatriated to France where the new airs of the French Revolution will transform this chameleon and faker in the most conspicuous delegate of the new moral order. He has left Ines pregnant, but he returns from France fifteen years after ignoring this fact.

Goya will make all the unimaginable efforts to make mother and daughter could meet themselves, but the converted Lorenzo with his twisted morality moves his pieces to stay clean before his new wife.

From the times of Ken Russell's The devils, we had not had the chance to experience this abominable atmosphere of hypocrisy and hidden vices in this horrid times of prohibition and censure. Milos Forman will convey us through these labyrinths of the horror where the political circumstances will interchange roles for the beast, profane, opportunist and sacrilege human being.

Javier Bardem is outstanding as the hated Brother, Stellar Skarsgard as Goya is remarkable too and Nathalie Portman makes a resplendent and effective role as the suffered and fallen in disgrace Ines. Michael Lonsdale (the untiring investigator who will pursuit to The Jackal)  as the Supreme authority in the town, performs a worthy role.

With this film, Forman dives us for third time in the hellish atmosphere of the madhouse (One flew, Amadeus are the other two) expressing perhaps with his admirable genius that despite the elapsed years, the human condition is certainly irredeemable.

Formidable and totally recommended.",1218153600,10,2382,4.994949494949495
2941861,3,B000VHVT66,"I was hoping for a historical snapshot like the one in Amadeus, which is unquestionably one of the best in spite of all its inaccuracies. Alas, while there are very strong moments, this film founders on its many TV-like simplifications of very complex events. That being said, the acting is excellent, in particular the sublimely beautiful Portman as Inez.

The story is extremely novelesque: you have the artist and his muse as well as an outside authority that interferes. Inez is taken in by a revived Spanish Inquisition, which operates with frighteningly bizarre reasoning (if you are innocent, God will give you the strength to resist torture). Of course, this proves untrue, and Inez is consigned to heretics prison, while a monk ally must flee for his own forced confession. Goya is the recording eye for all of this, and the emotional center of the film. Upon the invasion of Napoleon's forces, we see the return of the characters after 15 years. Portman is magnificent as the ruined Inez, who has lost everything. The monk-turned revolutionary (Bardem) is also entirely believable as a chameleon-like survivor who remains much the same person in spite of his profound ideological transformation. It is very moving and full of very complex themes.

Unfortunately, Forman tries to pack too much history into the story. For example, when Goya is attempting to convince a key character to come with him, it is at that precise moment that the French troops choose to intervene. There are many other preposterous scenes like this, which badly damage the believability of the film and also feel stupidly rushed. For me, it was this that ruined the film = you can't sum up the French Revolution and the Inquisition in a single apocryphal speech.

2941862,4,B000VHVT66,"This film was recommended to me because of my interest and novels on the Second Inquisition as applied to ""conversos"", the Italian Wars and, especially, the Conquest of Mexico.  At that level the film didn't disappoint.  A young woman from a wealthy merchant family is arrested for the high crime of refusing suckling pig at a party.  She is put to ""The Question"", which is made all the more emphatic by her being stretched on the rack.  She doesn't know what her ""crime"" is, so she is unable to answer the question.  A few more turns of the screw and with a little help from the inquisitor, she finds that she must confess to being a secret Jew i.e. a New Christian, a converso, a secret Judaizer.  She's a devout Catholic but, a few more turns, and she confesses to a crime she knows nothing about.

The girl's father knows that she has been called in for questioning by the Holy Office but doesn't know for what reason and doesn't know why she hasn't returned.  He invites one Father Lorenzo, a familiar of the Inquisition, to his home and learns the truth.  Lorenzo says he can't help because the girl has confessed and a confession, even under torture, is necessarily the truth.  The father and his servants seize Lorenzo and put him to ""The Question"" by stretching him from the ceiling.  Lorenzo's faith fails him and he confesses to being the bastard son of apes and admits, under torture, that he is attempting to subvert the Holy Office--the Inquisition.

To me this was the high point of the film.  Afterwards things get muddled.  There's Lorenzo's fall from Grace and an invasion by the French.  There are atrocities and Lorenzo, who has fled to France and become a staunch Napoleon man, returns to lord it over his previous oppressors.  The French, in their turn, are defeated by the English and Spanish guerillas.  Lorenzo is captured and turned over to the newly reconstituted Inquisition.  In a contorted sense, Lorenzo is redeemed by refusal to recant his previous errors to save his own life.  Wearing the peaked hat and San Benito of a condemned heretic, he is garroted during an Auto de Fe in which hundreds cheer his death.

Yes, Goya is featured during the film but only as a backdrop against which the Lorenzo story is played.  I enjoyed the film and found it informative.

2941863,5,B000VHVT66,"Goya's Ghost is an excellent film that surfaces the great contributions of Francisco Jose de Goya y Lucientes. Born on March 30th, 1746, Goya was a famous Spanish painter and printmaker who served to record history through his art during the Spanish Inquisition.

During his life, Goya was given great commissions, such as decorating the bare stone walls of El Escorial and the Palacio Real del Pardo, where Spanish monarchs were to reside, therefore, Goya was given access to the royal court and painted many of the portraits of the time.

Goya was a favorite of King Carlos III and became a friend to Crown Prince Don Luis, living in his house while he was painting the portraits of the Queen. After an illness where he contracted a high fever, Goya is left deaf and became introspective and reserved. Goya becomes rather informed about the French Revolution because while recuperating he dedicates his idle time to reading the philosophical writings of the rights of man.

During the reign of Charles III and IV, Goya becomes the royal painter, finally promoted to First Court Painter and assigned a salary of 50,000 reales, which was a fortune at the time. Goya is not given to flattery and paints subjects as he sees them, and the Queen of Spain is rather upset when she sees her image interpreted by Goya because the result is that of a rather ugly female.

In this movie, we see Goya's relationship to Brother Lorenzo, played by Javier Bardem and to a model he uses, played by Natalie Portman. The movie surfaces how Judaism was persecuted. Anyone suspected of respecting or following any of the traditions of Jews ended in jail, put the test, the famous ""Question"" which through torture tested those accused on their resolve to tell the truth. But the cruelty of the torture was such that anyone put to the test would end up asking: ""What is the truth you seek?"" and they would confess to anything so they would be left alone.

Ines, Goya's model, is suspected of practicing Judaism simply because she refuses to eat pork during a night out with her brothers. Her father asks that Goya intercede with those in power to obtain the freedom of his daughter and because he is a rather wealthy merchant he donates a large fortune to the Church in exchange for his daughter. But the Church representatives are not moved and while they accept the donation, they do not return Ines and the father proves to Brother Lorenzo how any man / woman put to ""The Question"" would confess anything for the torture to stop.

Brother Lorenzo visits Ines in prison and is taken by the young beauty, and he takes advantage of her situation... much ensues... and we learned lots about the Spanish Inquisition and how Spain is influenced and transformed by the French Revolution and Napoleon's invasion.

We enjoyed the film, learned about a subject that we rarely find in films, the Spanish Inquisition, and were very impressed with Natalie Portman's ability to play multiple roles for she is Ines... young and old, and a daughter that is born while in prison, fathered by Brother Lorenzo. Enjoy!",1215993600,12,3081,4.758426966292135
2941864,4,B000VHVT66,"At long last, a truly beautiful film about art, history and the people who lived at the time.

The sets are beautifully done and are as close to Goya's sketches as possible.  Also, an extremely fine cast.

One caution:  if you like Thomas Kinkade's paintings, you will not like this film as Goya's work is neither pretty nor soothing.  Having lived through the Inquisition, the French Revolution and later, his sketch pad was his camera and torture and death were some of the main subjects.

However, if you want to see 18th century history in Spain through an artist's eyes, the movie was wonderful.",1213574400,2,600,4.721153846153846
2941865,4,B000VHVT66,"This is an enjoyable and interesting movie. It is the work of Milos Forman of Amadeus fame. It is not the stunning, fast-paced and colorful display of Amadeus, but it is a fine looking and entertaining film chocked full of tasty historical and philosophical tidbits.  It also has that sense of mystery that made Amadeus so great.

I thought it would be more biographical, but it turns into an interesting story about the end of the Golden Age of Spain as well as perspective on the War of Independence.

I won't give the story away because it is much more fun for the viewer to be surprised at the interesting twists and turns.

The acting can at times be a little stiff, but once the story was completed I appreciated it as a whole. So be patient and let it unfold.

The portrayal of Goya is subtle. He is not lionized or trashed. Stellan Skarsgrd plays the role with a degree of sophistication and worldliness that is surprising.  The acting of Natalie Portman is a take it or leave it proposition. However, the Brother Lorenzo played by Javier Bardem is a witty and enjoyable villain on par with Maestro Salieri.  Randy Quaid is truly memorable as the aging, dimwitted King of Spain.

Many interesting historical events and artistic developments are on display in the film, so it is a feast for the lover of Spanish culture.

We can only hope we will see many more films of this kind.  The movies is hardly a slave to history or a slave to convention. In telling an interesting story, the film gets the facts over and implies a great deal about life in Madrid at the turn of the 19th Century.

I have the DVD on the shelf and I am anxious to show it to another friend who has not seen it yet. It really adds to a pleasant day and gives you and your literary friends a lot to talk about.",1213142400,5,1789,4.374622356495468

2941867,2,B000VHVT66,"Goya's Ghosts (Milos Forman, 2006)

There was a time when I thought Milos Forman can do no wrong. That time is long past, alas, but I still at least attempt to watch everything the man releases. The fact that Javier Bardem had a major role in this one was added spice, since I also attempt to watch everything he releases. I was pretty much sold on Goya's Ghosts from the time I first heard about it, despite its getting almost no play in American theaters (hey, neither did William Friedkin's amazing Bug) and lukewarm-at-best critical reviews (if the critics can't find the greatness in Barbet Schroeder's Our Lady of the Assassins, what good are they anyway?). This time, however, I was wrong, and everyone else was right; Goya's Ghosts  is overlong, overslow, and despite an exceptionally juicy plot, overboring as well.

The great Stellan Skarsgard, who seems to hamstring himself more often than not by finding the silliest roles he can, here stars as Goya, the icnonoclastic painter making his living by poking fun at Mother Church during the hottest days of the Inquisition. Despite his disfavor with the church, Brother Lorenzo (Bardem), an Inquisitor, commissions Goya for a portrait, giving Goya an ear in the church. Goya needs it when Ines (Natalie Portman), the daughter of a friend of Goya's, is arrested and thrown into the dungeon to be tortured. When Lorenzo's superiors refuse to release her, said friend (Jose Luis Gomez) arranges a dinner for Lorenzo with a nasty surprise attached. Fast-forward fifteen years; the Inquisition is in ruins, the French have invaded Spain, Goya is basically oblivious to everything around him after the trauma of that dinner party and its fallout, and Ines is still missing. Commence second half of movie, about which I can say nothing without major spoilers.

Bardem, as usual, is the real centerpiece here. (I find it amusing that most reviews I've read overlook the obvious-- that he's a scheming, selfish beast-- and instead consider him to be a champion for whatever cause he happens to be espousing at any given time during the film.) The man can do no wrong, even when he ends up in a thoroughly awful film (e.g., Dios Contados). Skarsgard, on the other hand, often seems as if he's only as strong as the material he's working with-- brilliant in Insomnia, while ineffective and boring in The Glass House. He comes off as somewhat flat here when playing the flamboyant Goya, and I'll admit it does work well during the second half of the film, but during the first, there always seems to be something slightly wrong with his portrayal. Portman, as usual, is just gorgeous, but I'm still waiting for a performance from her anywhere near the caliber she showed in Leon; her work in the second half of this movie is as close as she's come to date, but is still a few notches below. Forman's career took a nosedive after Amadeus and hasn't yet righted itself (while it's a given that Valmont is a far, far better film than Dangerous Liaisons, let's face it, ten times nothing is still nothing); perhaps that's why this is only his fourth film in the past twenty years. And it's a decided improvement over his last one, the godawful Man on the Moon, but it's still more a curiosity than anything else. Recommended for hardcore fans of Javier Bardem; everyone else can ignore it. **",1212105600,14,3335,4.784722222222222
2941868,5,B000VHVT66,I rented this movie first and enjoyed it so much that I bought it. The actors are terrific and I am proud of Natalie Portman's excellent portrayal. She has come a long way in her artistic talents from her role in the Star Wars movies.,1211241600,,234,4.222222222222222
2941869,4,B000VHVT66,"Forman takes a perspective of history in Goya's Ghosts that could be applied to anytime and any place.  Using the characters of Inez, Lorenzo and Goya who observes them both, Forman demonstrates the cruelty and absurdity of mass hysteria, brutal war and the assumption of unrestrained power. Inez is an innocent metaphor for artistic vision and Lorenzo a portrayal of fanaticism. Watching them both is Goya, unable to rescue anyone in a world gone mad with violence in the name of right. Observing the tragedy of Inez and the blindness of Lorenzo (given a taste of his own cruel medicine over a dining table)reveals to us what would have driven Goya to paint the images of Saturn devouring his children in his later life. Important for its portrayal of these historical events, the film is not pretty to watch, or uplifting, but sobering and thought provoking. With solid performances from the principles, Natalie Portman, once again, proves her weight. Excellent production values.",1208736000,2,982,5.061728395061729

2941871,4,B000VHVT66,"In the year when there were so many movies made about famous artists: ""Moliere"", ""Becoming Jane"" (Jane Austen), ""Marie Antoinette"" Goya's Ghosts"" is another one of those that shows artists' perspective on society of his time.  Goya was a painter during 18th century when many changes were taking place.  While inquisition had a stronghold in Spain, French Revolution was taking place in France.  In order to prevent further explosion of Jacobian ideas, British got involved in Portugal and Spain.  The fear, power strugle, monarchy, upper classes, lower classes and artistic freedoms all clash at once. As a bystander, Goya gets to experience is first hand thru people he paints and ineracts with.  We see the power of art as a means to show true state of society, humanity and beauty around us.  Natalie Portman gives wonderful performance as a young aristocrat girl who spends 15 years in jail of the church inquisition for refusing to eat pork.  In the process, she is impregnated by one of the priests and gives birth to a girl.  To find out the rest, you will have to see the movie...",1207180800,,1089,4.817204301075269

This story is not so much about the artist Goya as it is about some other people in his life during the late 18th and early 19th centuries:  an innocent woman condemned by the Inquisition and imprisoned for years; and a monk who impregnates her, then flees and leads a secular life, not knowing where their daughter is.

The cast members do an admirable job with some unpleasant scenes--and I will admit to fast-forwarding through the two torture scenes--although I don't know if I completely buy Portman or Skarsgard in the roles of Spaniards.  Javier Bardem, by contrast, is perfectly suited to the task.

The resolution leaves something to be desired.  Portman still doesn't get to locate her daughter and has lost her mind as well; while Bardem is dead and Goya...well, who knows?",1205107200,2,806,4.846715328467154
2941875,1,B000VHVT66,"While I cannot complaint about the acting (the actors did a great job), I still hated this movie. I felt it was detached and was told from so many characters' point of views that I never really connected with anyone in particular.  I did not expect a movie about the Spanish Inquisition to be jolly, but I did hope to find it interesting. Instead, I found it frustrating, heart wrenching and depressing and I wanted to crawl into the TV and beat those men senseless! Maybe that is how the director intended for me to feel, but nonetheless, I though it was torturous. In comparison, I did not like ""The Libertine"" either for instance, but I at least though it was interesting, so I know dark historical movies can be engaging. (Wow, I never though I would tout The Libertine over another movie!) While some may feel this movie is a masterpiece, I found it relentlessly bleak and dreary. So, be warned, if you like very dark depressing historical movies, enjoy. Otherwise, avoid this one like the plague.",1204848000,11,1002,4.629213483146067

But while it has all the expected beauty and panache that one expects from Forman, finally one has to admit that it's a noble failure. (But let's be honest, any Milos Forman film, even the failures, are better than 95% of what hits American multiplexes these days.)Don't expect much and you will be pleasantly surprised.",1204588800,2,603,4.541284403669724
2941877,5,B000VHVT66,"Milos Forman has a gift for combining fine art subject matter in period pieces that are not only entertaining but also educating.  In GOYA'S GHOSTS he not only explores the multifaceted aspects of the great Spanish artist Francisco Goya as a painter of court portraits as well as canvases  of dramatic collisions between the factions of people versus military cruelty of 18th and 19th century Spain, but he also dissects the infamous Spanish Inquisition, not only by defining characters who represented the Holy Office and the victims of the 'purging' but also by subtly remarking on the tenor of the times by focusing on Goya's 80 etchings titled 'Los Caprichos'. This is a richly realized film that captures the horror of the times while it offers insights into the changes that occurred in Spain in a rather comprehensive fashion.

1792 and while Francisco Goya (Stellan Skarsgrd) is painting portraits of the royal family (Randy Quaid and Blanca Portillo) as well as portraits of his favorite model Ins (Natalie Portman) and of the Inquisition activist Brother Lorenzo (Javier Bardem).  Corruption abounds  in Spain and the fear of the Inquisition headed by Father Gregorio (Michael Lonsdale) penetrates all of society. When Ins is called before the Inquisition because she doesn't like the taste of pork offered at a public banquet, she is tortured for not confessing to be a Jewess and imprisoned.  Despite the pleadings of Goya and the money offered by her family (Brother Lorenzo is asked to intervene on her behalf), Ins remains in prison for 15 years and when Brother Lorenzo visits her he impregnates her and the resulting girl child is sold upon her birth).  France invades Spain (courtesy of Napoleon Bonaparte) and when the French Revolution begins to spread through Europe the chastised Brother Lorenzo travels to France where he assumes a new life away from the church.  During the trauma of these years Goya loses his hearing and in response to the disintegration of society, creates the Caprichos - etchings that stress the brutality and madness to which the country has succumbed.  Lorenzo returns to Spain, the prisoners of the Inquisition are freed, and Ins (now pitifully ugly) searches for her daughter, confronting Lorenzo with the paternity. How all of the pieces of the Caprichos come to life brings an end to the story fills the final moments of this fine period piece.

Javier Bardem is particularly strong in his role of the mutating Lorenzo and Stellan Skarsgrd makes Goya an understandable genius.  In addition to the named cast there are excellent cameo roles for such fine actors as Unax Ugalde, Wael Al Moubayed (Goya's interpreter), Jos Luis Gmez and Mabel Rivera among others.  The cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe captures the flavor of the period and the musical score by Varhan Bauer and Jos Nieto quotes some 20th century compositions (Shostakovich) and blends Spanish court and dance themes into a rich musical tapestry.  This is a fine film despite the lack of critical acceptance and certainly deserves a large audience, especially those who appreciate historical drama.

2941878,5,B000VHVT66,"Don't be fooled by the low profile given to this film by the critics. Maybe they got stuck in expecting a linear plot about an artist. It isn't about Goya. He is the lens through which we get to see a full spectrum humanity. It is a deep observation of humanity at its ugliest and at its kindest through the eyes of an impartial observer whose kindness never gets entangled in the horrors he sees and draws. His ghosts are the player in the story.

The film is breathtaking. Torture, love, commitment, innocence and the greedy need for control shows us a world that is similar to ours. When asked to admit through torture to being the bastard son of a chimpanzee and an orangoutang one is startled with the thought that he would have been better off that way than born to humans. Only humans devote their lives to controlling others and to torturing anyone who thinks differently.

As the author of Raising Our Children, Raising Ourselves I can't avoid seeing this film with the clear awareness that such desire to control is created by the ways we parent and so does kindness. The film brings to focus love, deep family connections, torture and innocence in a beautiful and complex story. It is optimistic in spite of the horrors done. Goya stays an impartial and kind observer who offers us a mirror - not a judgment. The film leaves us gasping with horror, yet in love with being human. I don't think any caring and thinking person should miss this film. Thank you Milos for another masterpiece of compassion and art.",1201996800,13,1520,4.584558823529412
