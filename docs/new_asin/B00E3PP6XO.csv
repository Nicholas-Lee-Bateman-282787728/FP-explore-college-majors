The film begins with a young girl talking about her Dad. ""Do you want me to kill him?"" This tells you it will be a sicko movie! Then we see a street with a voice from a man with psychological problems. There are weird neighbors for this strange family. Lester has a job in advertising (professional lying?); is he expendable? There is conflict at the dinner table. ""What happened?"" Carolyn is in real estate sales, she has lookers not buyers. [Are her emotions embarrassing?] Jane is a cheerleader with emotional problems. Lester has a fantasy; is he pathetic? Does Angela have a problem too? Is a neighbor a voyeur? ""Oh, gross!"" Are the other neighbors strange? What's their business? [Does it seem like a cartoon drama?] The character of Angela is displayed as if to suggest future failure. Is their conversation real? Does Ricky look too old for high school?

The film runs on with conversations that seem weird. What kind of job does Ricky have? Why is Angela so friendly? Are their conversations real? Does the story drag on? [Did people really sit through this movie?] Why is Ricky being tested? Would a dealer trust a new customer? Is Lester slowly going crazy? Can you believe this story? Its like a life of people who will show up on ""Jerry Springer"" or some other freak show. Is there a cure for being stressed out? [Another unbelievable scene?] Why would anyone be scared of Ricky, the friendly neighborhood dope dealer? They show a video that is more boring than this movie. Pathetic? Does the dinner conversation seem unreal? Lester doesn't recognize the music! Spaced out? The film continues to drag on, testing the viewer's patience.

Mister Fitts bursts into his son's room for a violent confrontation. [Did it wake you up?] ""There are rules in life."" Another embarrassing scene follows. Carolyn takes up a new hobby; she has that freedom. [I sense a tragedy about to happen.] Is the film going downhill? Is Lester cracking up? Are Jane and Ricky having problems? Will they plan a felony? [Does it seem real?] Can a family be that sick? [The film heads to a crisis.] The framing of scenes is suggestive. [Does it satisfy the hidden desires of the writer?] Are the actions of Jane believable? Or the speeches? Is the writer just creating his fantasies? Does Angela seem credible or a victim of sexual abuse? Is Lester credible in his act? Will a romantic triangle end in violence, like some operatic tragedy? Does the writer avoid the logical conclusion of his story? Is the ending as stupid as the preceding film?

I wonder how much of a pay-off is needed to buy great reviews for this film? [Local newspaper reviewers used to praise the films shown by its advertisers.] I did not find it moving or funny, did you? Is it designed to demoralize the viewing public? Does this movie suggest that people in advertising are sick mentally? What about the writer and producers?",1510272000,,2914,4.741617357001973
