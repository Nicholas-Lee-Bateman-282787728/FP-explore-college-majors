2100325,3,B0002KPIKK,"This has to be one of the stranger skin flicks i've ever encountered.
Made in the early 80s at the height of the Slasher movement in the States,this film combines a softcore plot about a sexy teacher(Sybil Danning)who is sleeping with her student(Eric Brown,who had similar ""trouble"" with Sylvia Kristel in Private Lessons(1981),while a maniac is killing the supporting cast in very gory fashion!

Most famous for being THE showcase for the ample nudity presented by the beautiful Miss Danning,who seems to undress every few minutes,the film is so bizarre as it tries to combine two genres that do not in any way fit together.
In no way a good movie,this still will please Skin fans and certainly the most curious of gorehounds,but it's no classic in the latter.

Still,Trash fans have to give this one a view.",1233619200,11,810,4.86231884057971
2100326,2,B0002KPIKK,"I wish I had teachers like Sybil when I was in school.  However, I look for something more like in the something weird videos.  Crazy and weird sex stuff like.",1216771200,,159,4.266666666666667
2100327,3,B0002KPIKK,"This is cool, sensual, good old movie. I enjoy Sybil Danning performance. This is worth buying.",1214352000,3,95,5.0
2100328,2,B0002KPIKK,"This is a remake of 1974's drive-in classic ""The Teacher"" by the same director, which starred Angel Tompkins and Jay North. It was in my opinion not only light-years better, but much more realistic too. Can you really believe in this film that a worldly woman like Sybil Danning would give a kid like Eric Brown the time of day?? Andrew Prine is a good actor and is also wasted here. Angel Tompkins was a real woman where Sybil Danning is too worldly and experienced. To each their own, however.",1203379200,5,495,4.511111111111111
2100329,5,B0002KPIKK,"I want to say Sybil Danning is delectable in this movie. She plays a english teacher at a college that uses her vivacious body to seduce a naive student (Jay)Eric Brown. To hatch a plan to scare her husbands(Andrew Prine)affluent parents into a nursing home so they can claim the inheritance of the estate. But instead of being scared they end up being dead,this is very deleterious for Jay since he was the last on the estate,but also suspicious for the scheming couple since they have all the motive. What follows is mystery and suspense to find who the real killer is. I must say I was surprised by this film! I was expecting some dump 80's sexploitation film but what I found was an above average thriller. Of course you have some T&A from Danning but all tastefully done,and solid acting as well. And if you are considering buying this dvd for Sybil Danning showing her wares you won't be disappointed!! for she appears very sexy in this film. I wish it was Sybil doing all those erotic thrillers than Shannon Tweed.!",1197763200,10,1022,4.590163934426229
2100330,5,B0002KPIKK,"Eric Brown made his film debut playing a teenager being seduced by older, hot woman Sylvia Kristel in Private Lessons. A few years later he follows it up in this flick playing a young college student being seduced by his older, blonde amazon bombshell professor Sybil Danning. There's some type of plot that unfolds inbetween nude scenes, but do you honestly care what said plot involves? Me neither.",1193788800,3,400,4.897058823529412
2100331,2,B0002KPIKK,Not much of a story but enough nudity to keep you interested. Not a great movie but ok for a rental.,1187913600,,100,3.8095238095238093
2100332,5,B0002KPIKK,"Let's be honest, are we looking for good acting or good plot in this kind of movie. Sybil Danning is the only reason to consider. She shows her assets numerous times and what a sight and already worth the price of this DVD. And I have to say what a lucky kid Eric Brown is. He was in two different movies with 2 different Euro sexy stars (the other one is Private lesson with Sylvia Kristel)

The picture quality is good, clear and sharp. The Mono sound is ok, as you are not going to appreciate its dialogue anyway. The dvd has no extra features but again with Sybil Danning as the main attraction, who needs extra. Highy recommended.",1182902400,30,635,4.336134453781512

2100353,4,B0002KPIKK,"This 1980s Movie of ""They're Playing with Fire"" DVD was about suspense and mystery and it was kind of ok but some scenes are graphic part in the movie but others parts of the movie is fine and ok but graphic parts are too scary. It is a murder mystery and suspense of the 1980s era.

I am not sure if this movie is rated PG-13 or Rated R. I would recommend anyone who is over age of 17 to watch this unrated film.",1311033600,,413,3.9166666666666665

8028412,4,B0002KPIKK,"Tenacious (and indescribably sexy) professor Diane Stevens coaxes her glassy eyed student (played none too amiably here by ""Mama's Family"" regular Eric Brown) Jay Richard into helping her and her husband (portrayed by the great character actor Andrew Prine) scare two elderly family members away from a large property in order to convince them that the nursing home is the proper place to be. Stupidly, Richard agrees to this because he has an instant fixation on the spicy professor, but his efforts at doing a small favor for her lead him into an afternoon of seduction, an under-rehearsed break in, and a whole lot of other unexpected situations...
Kino Lorber should give themselves a pat on the back for releasing a nice new print of this Howard Avedis-directed favorite. Danning herself mentions, in the brief interview included on this disc, that she initially thought that the script (an original, written by Avedis and his wife Marlene Schmidt) was a bit too ""convoluted"" for her taste. I am inclined to agree with her--but, even so, the picture has a sense of mystery and threat about it without ever becoming too heavy-handed or too mired in any kind of horror film mentality. Actor Paul Clemens (whom you may recall from THE BEAST WITHIN) portrays Richard's friend Martin Johnson, an innocent looking young man who may or may not have something to do with the plot. But what is most memorable about the movie is, as others have said, the beautiful body of Sybil Danning. If you are easily aroused, let me just issue a brief warning before you attempt to watch this one with company. Sybil carries herself so well one often forgets just how interesting of a performer that she is to watch. Any movie with her is worth your time, in my opinion. So, while the mystery within the plot is certainly interesting, Sybil is so sexy in her scenes that even the most astute viewers are going to find themselves distracted. Maybe, in some ways, that was the point. I was, however, pleasantly surprised that the movie kept me as engaged as it did. In her interview segment, Sybil also mentions her affection for the picture's cinematographer Gary Graver, a cinematographic legend who worked with everyone from Orson Welles to Roger Corman and shot some amazing footage until his untimely death in 2006. THEY'RE PLAYING WITH FIRE is a well-shot and well-edited picture indeed, so it is a bit unfair to mark it off as yet another B-movie. And with Sybil aboard, well, wow! Just wow.
