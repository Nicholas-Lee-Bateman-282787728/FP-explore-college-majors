3781143,5,B001RV53TE,"I purchased this video by mistake, thinking it was a different special I had seen on PBS. Nonetheless, we kept it, and watched it....over and over and over! My five year old daughter absolutely loves it. Very educational and awe inspiring!",1264809600,8,239,4.853658536585366
3781144,5,B001RV53TE,"Indeed, it's a lovely program about absolutely amazing creatures. As always with NOVA, superbly done. One thing: In two very un-Nova moments, in two segments they use soprano vocal ""singing"" (over orchestral) that is ear-splitting, spine-slicing, cruelly painful to some of us with sensitive hearing! Yikes! It actually triggers a migraine. Although I've watched this episode several times, I still have never heard what Stockard Chaning says about the chrysalis and then in the mating segment because that music is unbearable and I have to mute the volume (and take an Imitrex for migraine). But the other 50 minutes of this Nova episode are wonderful.",1264464000,12,653,5.228571428571429

3781169,4,B001RV53TE,"""The Incredible Journey of the Butterflies"" is a Nova documentary about the iconic Monarch butterfly and its strange journeys across the North American continent.

The ""eastern"" population of Monarchs migrates to a relatively small area in central Mexico, the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve, where they spend the winter. In the spring, the Monarchs return northwards. Curiously, the back journey takes three or four generations, with each succeeding generation somehow ""knowing"" where to migrate. The last generation in the cycle knows that they should fly southwards to Mexico again! Apparently, these insects can navigate using the position of the sun or perhaps magnetic fields. How the migration route is inherited by subsequent generations is, of course, an interesting question... (The ""western"" population migrates to southern California, but this is not mentioned in the documentary.)

The documentary doesn't just show us the actual butterflies, but also gives us glimpses of their cultural significance. In Mexico, the local population regards (or used to regard) the Monarchs as the returning spirits of the ancestors, perhaps because the Monarch in-migration coincides with the traditional celebration known as ""The Day of the Dead"". The relatively poor locals also earn extra money during the Monarch ingathering, by selling souvenirs, renting room for tourists, etc. Unfortunately, the Monarch reserve is threatened by illegal logging operations. Although the WWF pays locals to protect the forest, this has proven more or less impossible, since the illegal loggers are often armed and dangerous. (The sole illegal logger interviewed on the show claims that he is simply trying to survive.)

The documentary also shows the cultural impact of the Monarch in the United States, where children are hired to band the large butterflies for scientific research programs. The entomologists studying the Monarchs virtually worship the creature. One aspect not mentioned (it's a Nova documentary, after all) is the creationist/ID interest in Monarchs, obvious on Youtube, where every other thread dealing with Monarchs and other butterflies seem to be about God or religion!

""The Incredible Journey of the Butterflies"" is a good introduction to ""Danaus plexippus"", and I therefore give it four stars.",1374969600,4,2311,5.594285714285714

3781173,5,B001RV53TE,Our family really liked watching this about the monarch butterflies and their migration across the United States down to Mexico.  My husband lived in Mexico when the butterflies passed through several years ago... when the ground looked like it was moving with so many everywhere.  We enjoyed watching this amazing journey of one of God's creatures.,1322438400,5,349,5.214285714285714
3781174,3,B001RV53TE,"The 1st part of this video is Absolutely Marvellous......but the author added much laboreous content on survival to it_ making it serious for those who simply want to enjoy the butterflies....Survival is important but sometimes we just want to relax.

I'm going to try On the Wings of a Monarch....and.....Tropical Gardens and Butterflies.

I would really like it if some producer would film some more DVDs on different species of BUTTERFLIES.....and have some especially nice music_ that is quiet, dainty and uplifting at the same time....I can imagine that would be a really nice
experience for people.",1316390400,5,604,5.216494845360825
