8230077,4,B000XXC26Y,"I received my copy today. Picture quality is very good. Wonderful customes, relaxing plot, awesome interior design, period furniture...etc.
However, dear amazon management, please read my advice below:

Before you decide to sell this movie at the very high price of 22 dollars, please make sure to provide subtitles,  and to include some extras. The only extras here is the trailer. I don't want the trailer, simply because I bought the movie itself!!",1447200000,4,451,5.164383561643835

8230079,5,B000XXC26Y,"Outrageously funny, with an amazing cast, this is one of my favorite films. With its witty banter and ensemble acting (and its frantic finale), the sense of humor resembles in many ways that of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clue-The-Movie/dp/6305882649/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clue: The Movie</a>, so if you liked that film I would recommend this one.",1317772800,5,399,7.0
8230080,2,B000XXC26Y,"That a movie could be this terrible and at the same time star Guinness, Morley, and Lotabridgework, is a stunning reality.  How bad is Hotel Paradiso?  Well, most characters in the film have red hair, run around a lot, and shout at each other endlessly.  The story, such as it is, is wholly predictable.  And for humor we get a man who stutters and an assortment of fat ladies. I couldn't muster a smile, perhaps because I was in shock.

Ever wonder why this film has yet to appear in DVD?  Surely the rock bottom quality has something to do with it.  As for those high-priced VHS copies, taken from TCM, don't bother.",1286236800,,618,4.415929203539823
8230081,4,B000XXC26Y,"HOTEL PARADISO, along with BECKET, is one of Peter Glenville's best films.  Glenville directed the Feydeau play both in London and New York with great success.  His film is masterfully acted and directed; both the art direction and the costume design are perfect to the tiniest detail. The whole film is enhanced by superb cinematography and an intelligent music score. It lovingly recreates the atmosphere of 'belle-epoque' Paris, making it a delight to watch.  And we can see how much fun the actors were having with the material. I definitely cannot understand why it has not yet been released in DVD format.  A real shame, as so much inferior stuff is available on the market.",1154304000,4,680,4.886956521739131
8230082,3,B000XXC26Y,"This movie is based on one of Feydeau's farces, which were popular in France at the turn of the century.  The story is essentially quite simple, centering on Alec Guinness' bumbling efforts to seduce his lovely neighbor (Gina Lollobrigida, with much lighter-colored hair than usual) in a local hotel known as the ""Hotel Paradiso"".  Things get rather confusing and chaotic as people dash in and out of rooms in various states of undress and discombobulation.  It's not bad, but it's not really that great either; what makes it worth watching is, of course, the ultra-scrumptious La Lollo.",1131840000,3,587,5.030927835051546
8230083,5,B000XXC26Y,"Based on a play, Hotel Paradiso is a classic, light-hearted, and absolutely delightful French farce set in turn-of-the-century Paris.  The actual storyline is very basic (ie. a married man seeking an evening of romance with a married woman); indeed, it must be basic to possibly allow for the complexity of the situations in which the characters find themselves and each other, the misinterpretations, and the elaborate (and comical) explanations that result.  Never was the phrase, ""Oh what a tangled web we weave"" more appropriate than when applied here.
There are two things that really make this production shine, however.  First of all, there are no loose ends.  Not only does every character have a role to play, but every single incident that occurs happens for a reason; no scenes have been included whimsically and without purpose.  The story at times appears to be coming apart at the seams through misunderstandings and the entailing confusion, but such is in reality an intricately calculated illusion, for this is actually an extremely tightly-woven, carefully-controlled, and well-orchestrated production.  It is thoroughly enjoyable for being so well-written, but it is all the more so for being so consummately acted by an ensemble which includes some of Britain's finest.
By way of introduction and to give some idea of what to expect, M. Boniface (superbly played by Alec Guinness) fancies his next-door neighbour's wife, Mme. Cote (Gina Lollobrigida).  With Mme. Boniface (a battle-axe of a wife) away for the evening and M. Cote (an architect) away on business for the night, M. Boniface seizes the opportunity to instigate a romantic liaison with Mme. Cote.  But where to meet?  Well, Mme. Boniface has just received a flyer advertising the newly-opened (and disreputable) Hotel Paradiso.  While telling her husband of this disgraceful hotel, Mme. Boniface gives the flyer to her maid, Victoire (a very young Ann Beach--Fresh Field's ""Sonya"") to dispose of.  (Victoire, by the way, has taken a fancy to M. Cote's nephew Maxim (a very young Derek Fowlds--Yes Minister's ""Bernard"").)  In short, M. Boniface has found a place for his tryst with Mme. Cote (unaware that it is to this hotel that M. Cote's business has taken him).  As if that`s not enough, M. Martin, a friend of the Bonifaces, has arrived unexpectedly with his four daughters, but he must now find a hotel as the Bonifaces haven't enough room.  M. Martin overhears Mme. Cote as she confirms the name and address of the hotel and thinks she is recommending it to him.  And so the stage is set for what can only be described as a very fast-paced (indeed frantic) and very, very funny evening.  One final character that I ought to mention is the police inspector.  The role is not a large one, but it's wonderfully played by the late Leonard Rossiter (Rising Damp, Reggie Perrin).
In conclusion, this is a splendid film, and it is sure to be enjoyed by fans of British comedy, for it is the stuff of which so much British comedy is made.  It is well written, splendidly acted, and very funny--indeed, what more can one ask of a comedy?  Highly recommended!",1017446400,26,3137,4.963671128107075
