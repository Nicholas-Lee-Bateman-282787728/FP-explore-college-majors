8088977,3,B000BMCY7Y,"I was not impressed and did not learn any new information or techniques from watching this video.  The material presented is very basic.  The music was repetitive, but somehow I found it oddly relaxing.",1476230400,,202,4.911764705882353
8088978,5,B000BMCY7Y,This DVD was great for demonstrating new and easy techniques to help rejuvenate sun-damaged and dehydrated skin. Here in LA we get a lot of clients wanting facials after lengthy sun-exposure and this video really had some great techniques with the use of vitamin C and modelling masks to rehydrate and freshen up damaged skin. I'll definitely find this useful in the salon and will be introducing these techniques to our therapists. Highly recommend to anyone wanting to expand their knowledge and skills in facial therapy.,1411603200,2,523,5.093023255813954
8088979,5,B000BMCY7Y,"I don't really understand why the other reviewers weren't happy. This DVD had a lot of information and visual presentation of facial movements and techniques. She went over different steps, explaining them thoroughly. She also explained why she was using particular products-very informative. Everything was explained and demonstrated in a very clear manner. It's a good DVD to keep on hand and refer to from time to time to refresh your technique.",1401926400,3,448,5.236111111111111
8088980,2,B000BMCY7Y,"There was very little information in this video that went much beyond a basic european facial.
Presenter performed two facials - one with an AHA exfoliation and one with an enzyme exfoliation and an alginate modeling masque. This was not worth it to me, but probably would be good for an esthetic student.",1350259200,,305,4.773584905660377
8088981,3,B000BMCY7Y,"I was not happy with this video
I purchased it to learn more about facial massage as the description mentioned the facial massage
Did not lean any thing I didn't already know about facial massage.
I don't recommend this video",1298505600,,225,4.65
