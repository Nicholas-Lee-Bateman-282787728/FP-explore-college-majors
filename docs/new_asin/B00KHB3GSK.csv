6429456,5,B00KHB3GSK,I really enjoy The Amazing Race. It's best when teams work together without underhanded tricks and stunts. Touring the world while sitting at home is a great plus.,1404950400,2,163,4.857142857142857

8658922,2,B00KHB3GSK,Not a great season.  Team eliminations were annoying.  One is eliminated for loosing a passport.  One is eliminated because the girl won't go down a water slide.  A WATER SLIDE!!!  If you can't go down a water slide DON'T GO ON AMAZING RACE!.  But the one I thought was really unfair was that an all girl team was eliminated because they couldn't do either challenge due to the fact that they both required the upper body strength of a man (all the other teams had a man).  They didn't have the time penalty option in this earlier series so they were eliminated.,1437782400,,562,4.450980392156863
8658923,2,B00KHB3GSK,"This is not a very good season of 'The Amazing Race'. I thought there was too much drama between some of the teams. An example would be the brothers, Sam and Dan who curse and flip each other off. Former Miss America, Ericka Dunlap, cries too much and does not always get along with her then husband, Brian. Poker players Maria and Tiffany are also way too conniving. CBS did the right thing by bringing back Nathaniel & Herb AKA Fligh time and Big Easy and Zev and Justin for 'Unfinished Business'. They were the most likable teams from this season.",1426636800,,550,4.455445544554456
