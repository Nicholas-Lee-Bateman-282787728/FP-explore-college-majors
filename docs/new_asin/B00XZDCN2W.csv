One of the oddest things about Andy Milligan is that despite having a certain artistic and personal drive sloppiness is a hallmark of all his work and this is no different. Andy's sloppiness is on display here not just from the writing standpoint of being a complete rip off of a story, which even Hammer included a transsexual twist with Sister Hyde for the sake of variety, Not Andy. He gives you a complete rip while forgetting about other basic movie steps like lighting, framing, acting, directing, etc. Despite all this, Andy creates an interesting movie based around the awfulness of the characters involved and his own bizarre drive to put in on screen in space of 75 minutes tops.

I can't say his films are good but they are unique and often at times hilarious. It's cheap and worth a watch",1466467200,4,1030,4.685082872928176
