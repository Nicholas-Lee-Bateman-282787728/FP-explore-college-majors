1373227,3,B00004YA37,"This movie is ultra camp!!  The mummy actually has a beer belly.  It looks like the mummy has spent one to many nights at frat houses and sports bars.  It looks like the director made the movie in his house and hired his friends to do it.  If you love camp, rent it just for fun.  I had to give Kudos to the mummy; he really made me laugh.",983664000,2,339,3.8550724637681157

7927050,4,B00004YA37,"I really fail to understand why most people dislike this film so much. Yes, there is some mediocre acting, especially from the ladies, but the mummy looks awesome and he kills some college kids so what more could you want from a horror movie? It's a nice small cast which any good horror movie should have and it allows us to get to know the characters. Speaking of characters Michael Lutz as Morris gives us one of the most annoying characters in cinematic history. (Spoiler) Luckily he gets slaughtered, but the mummy also kills off some cast members that you think are going to make it to the end. This film tries to cross the slasher genre with an old Universal film and the idea of stealing the mummy's jewels to revive him goes back to the old Aztec Mummy movies out of Mexico in the 1950s. This film certainly tries to feel like a 40s or 50s flick. The classic thunderstorm, the dead phones and for some reason no one seems to use lamps or light switches so everyone uses flashlights or candles throughout the film. Although I agree it is a bit slow I think this pacing works. It basically plays out in real time and we realize that the cast is completely unaware of any impending danger so for better or worse about half the time we simply get to see their normal boring life. That's fine with me because the other half is terrific mummy makeup, some decent kills and some weird cult like stuff with daggers and virgins.",1403136000,,1428,4.433460076045628
7927051,3,B00004YA37,"I often wonder where the really beloved bad movies of tomorrow are today.  So many today are intentionally campy or crappy and that just isn't the same.  But this gem--what a real low-budget mess, and not intentionally I'd guess.  The actors are exquisitely awful--not a single line is delivered in any kind of believeable way.  The mummy itself (it's an Aztec mummy!) has a scary face, but he's fat!  Really roly-poly.  He comes with a big knife, and so the movie itself is more of a teen slasher flick type of thing only the slasher is a mummy.  But of course the whole thing is a wonderful mess filmed at no budget.  It was filmed in a sort of house/compound that is supposed to be a college campus.  The `museum' is like a big entry hall with little bits of stuff on ""display"".  The classic tortured-nerd-kills-everybody plot device is used, with the nerdy guy skulking around and making this little pouty face in every scene.  He ends up being the descendant of ancient Aztec priests, even though he's blond and painfully white.  One of the main hunky lead guys--whose acting just redefines stiff and unnatural--spends a lot of time in a tank top.  Not scary in the least, but I sure did enjoy watching this z-level movie!",1183939200,4,1227,4.599078341013825
7927052,2,B00004YA37,"A group of college kids who cant act for *bleep* are studying a recently found mummy from the Aztecs. The plot bores on to find one of the kids who really cant act is a high Aztec priest who brings the mummy back to life and it kills of the kids one by one till the usual end happens.

I couldn't stand the way any of these kids talked, I think they spent more money on the effects then they did bothering to hire any one who even knew somebody who had been to acting school.

About halfway through I was just bored and couldn't take anymore of the bad dialog and turned it off. How the movie ended, I don't know, I don't care.

Avoid this *bleep* at all costs unless you are an inspired bad movie maker in the making.",1175040000,,718,4.042253521126761
7927053,1,B00004YA37,"Since this website does not list the sequel to this movie and I fell victim to renting it, I thought I would add my review for it to this movie. Besides, after seeing the second one. You couldn't pay me enough money to watch the first one. Anyway, here is my review:

People always wonder what a really bad horror movie is, some will give a movie like ""ring 2,"" ""Texas chainsaw massacre (remake)"" or ""darkness"" one star and say they are bad horror movies. You do not know squat about bad horror movies. You really haven't been around the block long enough to see what a REALLY BAD horror movie looks like until you see something like this. Here it is, this is it ladies and gentlemen, this is a BAD one! Let me get into the review (1) terrible grainy vhs quality picture - this really stands out on the black nighttime background in some scenes. (2) Bad grainy VHS quality sound. On some of these bad B-horror movies, the sound will be muffled, but this oen is a little strange, the sound is not muffled, but is very strange. In one scene there is a background noise that sounds like static on an old record player. On another seen, there is a dull humming noise (like a broken speaker, and on another scene, the sound is fine. (3) putrid acting - Saying the acting is bad would be an understatement. Its actually some of the worst overacting I have ever scene. When these actors and actresses get into these movies why don't they just relax and be them selves? No one talks or acts like these people do. (4) special FX that are the equivalent of defecation - Halloween store gags, really fake rubber arms, bad editing, bad masks with a guy slowly chasing people through the wood, terrible costumes. The movie starts off with one of the slowest cheesiest sword fight scenes I have ever seen to date.

Final word: I skimmed through this movie. I stopped caring what happens, I couldn't wait for the generic man in the mummy suit to kill everyone of the annoy actors in the movie, however, I soon even lost that much interest and finally shut the movie off about half way into it.

We should all surreptitiously work together to find the people who made this grade school horror movie project and break their legs.",1114041600,2,2212,4.443349753694581
7927054,5,B00004YA37,"I bought this movie because I am a big fan of director David DeCoteau's B movies, and look forward to the somewhat silly horror he offers in all of his B movies. This movie was better than his average film though; and apart from a few mistakes in the plot about the Aztec culture, (they didn't have wrapped mummys, the characters repeated mispronunciation of the Aztec Rain God Tlaloc's name, its pronounced Tah-Lock not Ta-Lay-Lock) Then there was actor Trent Latta's New Wave looking Aztec High Priest outfit, that may have been a little over the top too, but well, it did help to make it a great mummy flick. I can honestly say that the whole cast did a good job acting as well, particularly Michael Lutz in his first role, playing the obnoxious jock (Morris); Trent Latta who played the lead villian (Norman); and Jeff Peterson who played the hero (Don). They all did a great job. All in all, I give it an 9 maybe 10 out of 10.",1070236800,4,931,4.4186046511627906
7927055,1,B00004YA37,"Wow. Now, granted I knew I wasn't subscribing to Citizen Kane or anything. All in all, this got the job done. If you get it and enjoy utterly ridiculous movies, you probably will enjoy this. But quality wise, you'll find yourself laughing. The little nerd boy is supposed to be Aztec, but looks about as Aztec as an Albino. But you do have to give this movie an E for effort. The concept is great. But when they started putting it together was when they lost it. It's rated R for violence and language. If you've seen the rest of the movies in Hollywood's horror section, it might be worth a rent.",1028678400,6,597,4.339285714285714
7927056,1,B00004YA37,"PLOT: A College has found an Aztec Mummy that was ment to gaurd the king or some supreme ruler. Only that person can bring him back to life. But Aztecs have been dead for hundreds of years so he can never come back...or can he? Someone knows how and they are using the mummy for revenge.
STRAIGHT TALK: O.k. This new mod-horror flick was a waste of my 50 cents. Cool Cover Movie. The nerdy kid who is getting picked on just so happens to be the Aztec prince. He his scrawny and white he looks as much as an Aztec as a frog. He wears some kind of outfit when he does his rituals that looks like it came from the closet of Gary Glitter. The heartbeat of the mummy becomes very annoying and so the movie.
CAST: ""Um uhh um oh no um uh a mummy""
KILLS: Mod-Horror you don't see anything
CONCLUSION: This movie put me and my dog to sleep (seriously). Bad Acting,Cast,Kills,Plot= BAD MOVIE!",1026604800,4,882,4.224852071005917
