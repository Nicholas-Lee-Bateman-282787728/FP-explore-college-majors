5839636,3,B00DOZRSPI,"Super Mario World, the last of Dic's Mario cartoons, was a pretty fun show based on the Super NES game of the same name. Here, Mario, Luigi, and Princess Toadstool found themselves in Dinosaur Land, where they often had to deal with either teaching the cave people about the wheel, farming, or using the telephone (often with predictably disastrous results) or stopping King Koopa and his Koopa Kids from causing them a great deal of trouble. Aiding them was Yoshi, the perpetually hungry dinosaur whose appetite proved useful most of the time. The episodes were quite silly to the point of being downright cheesy, but they were enjoyable, even going as far as to warn viewers about the consequences of eating too much fast food or joining a gang. Plus, because of this show, we have the famous ""Mama Luigi"" episode that has since become a famous Internet meme.

Now all thirteen episodes are on this new 2-disc set from NCircle, but be warned...this set is flawed in a few ways.

First, it is not exactly the same as the Captain N and the New Super Mario World DVD set from Shout Factory that came out a few years ago. The Season 3 Captain N episodes are nowhere to be found...only the SMW cartoons are included. It's not a huge loss since most of the Season 3 episodes of Captain N were terrible, but those who actually want to see them would be better off getting Shout's set.

Second, the episodes are presented slightly out of order. The order they are presented in are as follows (Note that those episodes that are seen out of order are listed with the proper episode number):

Disc One:

The Wheel Thing (Episode 2)
Fire Sale (Episode 1)
Send in the Clowns
Ghosts R Us
King Scoopa Koopa
Born to Ride (Episode 7)

Disc Two:

Party Line (Episode 8)
Gopher Bash (Episode 9)
Rock TV (Episode 10)
The Yoshi Shuffle (Episode 11)
The Night Before Cave Christmas (Episode 6)
A Little Learning
Mama Luigi

I will admit, when I looked at the DVD menu for Disc One and saw that the Cave Christmas episode was not on it, I thought the episode was excluded, but for some reason, it was put on the second disc instead. Why the episodes were listed in this order, I have no clue.

The set's biggest flaw, however, is the fact that there are 2 1/2 hours of content total (including a storyboard version of the opening titles and some concept art of Yoshi, both taken from the Shout set), but for some reason, Ncircle put them on two discs instead of one. Why on earth would they do this?! One could easily put the whole set on one disc! The episodes aren't that long, either, as they last about 10-11 minutes each. I can understand NCircle putting all the Super Mario Bros 3 episodes of that set on two discs, as there were twice as many of those episodes as there were for SMW, but putting a little over an hour's worth of content each on two discs is baffling. Again, I wish that NCircle would've simply put all of the episodes on a single disc.

So is this DVD set worth it? If you don't have the earlier SMW DVD set, you enjoy the series (or Mario in general), and/or you're willing to put up with the set's flaws, then this might be worth checking out. For a more complete, better put together version, however, Shout's version is the way to go.",1382140800,29,3241,4.431932773109244

5839677,2,B00DOZRSPI,"I've noticed that there are problems if you watch this episode-by-episode instead of selecting ""play all"". Episodes start and end with the intros and outros cut off, without even so much as a fade to black and audio fade-ins/outs. Hard cuts to the episode. The disc menus are the most uninteresting and unappealing menus I've looked at since DVDs first gained menu screens in the late 90s. I've seen bootlegs that were done better than the way the content on these discs are presented.

Outer packaging is nice, though. The gold painted finish on the raised lettering of the slipcover really makes a difference, but I can't say I recommend buying this particular release of this show. Save your money for a full release of Captain N: the Game Master with these episodes included or wait for another rerelease.",1477526400,3,809,4.820143884892087

The only complaint (as is with a lot of these sort of things) is that they advertise other unrelated cartoons at the end, some of which aren't as age appropriate. - If you use something like DVDFab to ""edit"" your disks, then you can strip that part out.
