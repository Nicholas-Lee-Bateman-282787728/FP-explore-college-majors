8343666,5,B001TK290E,"This video was very long,approx. 21/2hrs. Its hard to find the time for this duration daily.  But the way he gave his presentation with so many postures divided to each series you can work on your weaknesses. I have many yoga videos but none are as complete as this one or as well done. This is a must have for anyone thriving to advance in ther daily practice. I did the whole series even though I could not do all the postures to perfection. Yet it motivated me to realize what can be acheivable. This video will take you to the next step of flexibility. I highly recommend this video for anyone who has incorporated yoga into their life.
