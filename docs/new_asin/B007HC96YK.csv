8516576,3,B007HC96YK,"I haven't worked out to this DVD in a while because it obviously isn't one of my favorites.  I don't recall if I got this as a set because I only have Volume 8.  If I DID get the Volume 5, I must've put it in the poor box.  Anyways, even without using a step, this DVD got me sweating.  Personally, I like something that is softer and flows better.  Powter is always zany and a kick, and she is very motivating, but this is not a favorite yoga DVD, and I've got tons to compare it with.",1361059200,,486,3.9183673469387754
8516577,5,B007HC96YK,I had a Susan Powter workout tape years ago and loved it so when I was looking for a yoga workout was very pleased to see she had one. The combination yoga and step is just enough cardio for someone not used to doing much and the yoga moves are very simple and easy to follow.,1359849600,,276,3.9464285714285716
