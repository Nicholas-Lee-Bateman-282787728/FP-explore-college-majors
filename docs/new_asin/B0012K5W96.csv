8246337,5,B0012K5W96,"I came across this video when I was teaching High School World History. It is actually the best film I have yet found on the Age of Exploration. I own a number of films on Columbus, and sadly, none of them come close to this excellent work. The documentary covers Vasco da Gama's voyage to India and return. A sort of ""Voyage of Columbus"" eastwards for Portugal, rather than west for Spain. Yet, this video combines all the elements that really explain in thorough, yet exciting detail how and why explorers did what they did, and how they either survived or didn't. In a style even better than the best History Channel documentaries, this video deftly weaves ""expert"" talking head interviews and computer models of the winds off the Cape of Good Hope with ample and exciting reenactor footage (in costume) of Vasco and his sailors on their voyage. This video could be thoroughly appreciated as an introduction or supplement to a brief overview of the Age of Exploration for High School and older audiences. Middle School audiences would need more background preparation, but the film is also suitable for 6th grade and up Honor's level classes, in my opinion. I own this film, and it is one of the best and most comprehensive in my teaching library. Typically I don't like what this company usually does. Their work is far too slow moving for most modern audiences, and kids lose interest very fast, but this one is a rare and exceptional piece of work, worth owning. If you like History Channel documentaries and are interested in this period, you won't be disappointed!",1292198400,,1572,4.761904761904762
