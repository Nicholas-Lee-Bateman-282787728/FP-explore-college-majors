5126660,5,B0083TUEEC,"My kids love the Fresh Beats band and have seen all of the first 2 seasons.  Although their music is catchy and they do a great show for kids it wasn't until I purchased this DVD and watched it with my kids that I was won over.  Since we don't have cable (only Netflix and Hulu Plus) we hadn't seen any of these episodes prior to buying this disc.  The Wizard of Song episode was really well done.  It was a perfect mix of the original story and the style of the Freash Beats.  I thought that it was quite clever.  This was also the first time that I had seen the new Marina. Some may disagree with me but I thought she was great.  Yes, she is different then the previous actress that filled the role but I felt that she was a great fit with the group and had excellent energy.  This disc also included a couple of other episodes.  I was pleased to see that in these episodes the band actually ventures to different locations outside of their original set which allowed for a greater variation in the stories.  The band members also changed outfits quite a bit but still managed to maintain their signature colors which was a lot of fun.  I highly recommend this disc.",1353888000,20,1168,4.263636363636364

5126662,2,B0083TUEEC,"Your child loves Fresh Beat Band, so you think to yourself:  I should buy a full-length movie based on the Wizard of Oz for them to enjoy!
Good plan, except this is just 3 different episodes from Season 3, put together into one ""movie"".  (I thought it was going to be a movie anyway)
So instead of spending $14.99 on this one, you can save a few bucks and buy the three different episodes separately for $1.99/ea.",1349222400,7,413,4.35064935064935

I was hoping that this DVD, was infact a compilation of the Fresh Beats ""concerts"", featuring their newest songs (""we've got the beat""--an old Bangles (walks like an Egyptian is another one)  song, as well as ""Reach for the Sky""--two songs which were played frequently during the summer of 2012.
