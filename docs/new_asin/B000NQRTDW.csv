8181129,2,B000NQRTDW,"I'm a Portuguese lawyer, with several Chinese friends. Bearing that in mind, allow me to tell you how disappointed I am with this movie. I'm not sure whether or not it was meant to be just a docudrama about the Tokyo Trials, but it's so inaccurate that it can't be of any service to those who are seeking to know the facts about them.

For instance, why didn't the other lawyers from both sides, like Commyns Carr or Owen Cunningham, get the importance they really had during those Trials?... When they began, there were no micro- and headphones available in the courtroom... The portrayal of Tojo's lawyer, Ichiro Kiyose, is needlessly ludicrous... The (in)famous Tanaka Ryukichi wasn't considered a credible witness by the wide majority of the IMFTE judges... When the judges are about to vote the penalties, how come that dialogue between Mei Ju-ao and Radhabinod Pal about Buddha and the after-life? For one thing, religion is never mentioned in Pal's dissentient judgment...

If they meant to do a docudrama about these Trials, I think they should have done nothing like this but something like Stanley Kramer's ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" (1961). I don't wish to be rude, but what's the need for movies like ""Tokyo Trial"" (2006)?...",1373068800,3,1234,4.927884615384615
