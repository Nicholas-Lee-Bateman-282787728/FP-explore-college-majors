Just watched it, and he sings great as usual, graceful on his feet, and not that bad to look at even that I know that he is married.  60 minutes long, and I enjoyed watching it as much as I enjoyed it on BPS.  Would recommend it to anyone that loves listening and watching Daniel O'Donnell as much as I and my elderly mother do.",1400284800,2,440,4.022988505747127
