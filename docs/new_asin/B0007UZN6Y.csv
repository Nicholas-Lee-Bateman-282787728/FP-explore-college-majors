8052156,4,B0007UZN6Y,"The ring fight with Greg was interesting.
I liked Joe In the movie Force:Five not so much here.
He did however explain everything In detail from slow to fast movements with his sparring partner who never talked.
He came across to me A lot as tooting his own horn which I guess Is okay If your him.
He seemed to be out of breath A lot of the times,hope he doesn't smoke.
Yes while watching this I saw about 2 tape glitches go by homemade as you can get,oh well he does get the point across.
I would recommend this for the Martial Artists out there and the fact that this does have Bruce Lee associated with It A Plus!",1430006400,,616,4.141666666666667

Sadly he alienated important people at inopportune times. That's all in the past. The world recently lost a man who was the one of greatest martial artists of all time and recognized by his peers as such on two separate occasions. He held various titles, including: ""United States Heavyweight Kickboxing Champion,"" ""World Heavyweight Karate Champion,"" and ""United States National Black Belt Kata Champion."" He was one of the two participants in the first Full Contact Kickboxing match in the US.

Already a champion, he studied with Bruce Lee in 1967 and 1968. He then applied what he learned to great effect during the remainder of his career.

This DVD is a great example of doing just what Bruce Lee wanted people to do: Joe took the lessons Bruce taught him and integrated them into his fighting techniques. What worked for him, he took, what did not, he left out. He created his own fighting system based on all of his learning and experience. This is just one DVD that exposes his system. This DVD primarily focuses on what he kept from Bruce's lessons.

I am not sure how old this recording is, but it was definitely recorded on tape first, and later, when DVDs came out, they were copied to DVD. The recording is a bit grainy, but still well worth the price of entrance. It's why I only gave it four of five stars.",1350345600,3,1483,4.5055762081784385
8052159,5,B0007UZN6Y,"Excellent! I enjoyed this video very much, I have been involved in the martial arts since 1981 and Mr. Lewis does an excellent job of breaking down Mr. Lees techniques and I have started using them in my own practice.",1245715200,2,217,4.45
8052160,5,B0007UZN6Y,"This is far and above the most informative REAL instructional video I've ever seen.  The information provided is real, deep and usable......listening and watching Joe Lewis leaves no doubt who he is and what he is still capable of.",1189382400,3,231,4.923076923076923
