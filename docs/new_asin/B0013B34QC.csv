8249656,4,B0013B34QC,"WARNING - In the 80+ years since this film was made, the world has changed a lot. With respect to the killing of animals, the changes have been mostly positive. In 1930 it was considered ""noble"" and ""brave"" to go out and shoot defenseless seals and to let their babies drown and/or starve. So anyone who is offended by this type of behavior will probably not want to watch this film.

The film itself is a strange mixture. It's a documentary about the sinking of a sealing boat (The Viking) off the Newfoundland Coast, and it's interspersed with the love story that was being filmed at the time the ship sunk. In reality, the film ""White Thunder"" had been finished when the producer decided he needed more action, so he returned to film a ""seal hunt"" and during this hunt the ship got stuck in the ice and then exploded, killing the producer and dozens of other people. So the final picture, renamed ""The Viking"" includes both the love story and the drama of the seal hunt.

The love story part of the film stars Charles Starrett (1903-86) as a jinxer (a person who brings bad luck) who joins a seal hunt. Louise Huntington (1904-97) plays a girl in love with Starrett and Arthur Vinton (1896-1963) plays the seal hunter who is in love with Huntington.

Starrett is best known as the ""Durango Kid"" in dozens of B westerns he made between 1940 and 1952. Huntington made only 5 films, and this was her fourth. Vinton debuted in this film and continued as an extra and made more than two dozen films.

But nothing about the love story is notable. It looks like a silent film from the teens, with little story nor plot. The true joy of this film is the photography which more often than not appears like a documentary, and every so often the silent film plot is inserted.

The film's producer, Varick Frissell (1903-31) worked with documentary maker Robert Flaherty (""Nanook of the North"", ""Moana"", ""Man of Aran"") and was inspired by medical missionary Sir Wilfred Grenfell (who appears in a foreward to the film) to visit Labrador where he made two shorts. He then got financing from Paramount to make ""White Thunder"" which was shown in March 1931, after which he made his return and fatal trip to film the seal hunt.

The ship's captain Robert Bartlett (1875-1946) appears as the Captain of The Viking. Bartlett a real Captain and was well known for accompanying Robert Peary in his 1908-9 trip to the North Pole and for rescue missions in 1914 (Karluk) and 1917 (Crocker Land).

The film was the first Canadian talkie as well as the first on location film from Paramount. For many years it was lost and then found in 1965 and released. In 2002 a film about the making of the movie was released, called ""White Thunder.""

The NY Times called the film ""an audible picture"" with ""many marvelous scenes of the ice fields and of the adventures of men on a seal hunt off Labrador. It is enhanced by being made with sound effects, but the dialogue, like the story, is merely incidental.""

Bottom line - a great opportunity to see life in the great north in the early 30s, but the story itself is weak and there are some scenes that will offend people who care about animals.",1333929600,,3165,4.548330404217926
