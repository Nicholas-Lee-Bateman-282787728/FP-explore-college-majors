633638,5,6303369170,"Masterpiece but you got to have a sense of humor.  I have seen this film many times from the theater to the home.  I love it every time....gets better with every viewing.  If you only like American films where every little item has to ""make sense"" or be ""fully explained ad nauseam"" this film is probably not for you.  If you only enjoy Depp's over the top fluffy roles like Captain Jack, then this film is not for you.  But if you can handle a bit of lunacy then this is a great watch.  By the way, this is just as much a Jerry film as it is a Johnny film.  Lewis is top notch here....possibly better in this film than many of his own.  I think Lewis is far more brilliant as a secondary character than when he is the main character....probably what made him so great with Martin even though he was the one who carried Martin (more often than not as a burden.....but a need one at that).",1430870400,,888,4.152046783625731

633791,5,6303369170,Great movie. It tells the story of a young man who was following his dream. Johnny Depp was wonderful in this movie. He was torn between the life his uncle wanted him to live and that of a free spirited individual following his heart.,1388188800,,234,4.340909090909091

633844,3,6303369170,"Back when Johnny Depp movies were birthed from ideas and not amusement park rides, this curiousity was unleashed upon an unsuspecting  (and largely absent) audience. Having seen both the truncated U.S. version and the longer, European cut, I would recommend seeing the full version, though it adds little in substance. Arizona Dream is a ponderous, dreamy project adorned with surrealistic touches and abstract scenes of behavior with no real purpose. The journey is the thing. And, truth be told, it can be a tedious and repetitive one. But it also feels alive in creative spirit and taps into that zeitgeist when films were trying to be more than enterprises. Not a complete success, but you have a writer, director and cast playing jazz in trying to figure things out. They caught the halibut, but it got away from them as well. You decide.",1376265600,5,843,4.895104895104895

633846,3,6303369170,"One of Depp's early films, possibly before he started having any control over the script. Beautiful acting jobs by all the principals, but suffers from an almost incomprehensible script. Depp's character winds up in a nest of loonies who should have had keepers. Have not watched it enough times yet to where it makes sense, assuming it will at some point. Bought it because I am a die-hard Johnny Depp fan, and am collecting all of his movies. Perhaps this is simply a case of my having a different sense of humor than the director did; or perhaps it would be better watched after a drink or two. Still, am glad to have it in my collection.",1371427200,,641,4.487179487179487
633847,5,6303369170,I found this movie to be not only entertaining but very well performed. The wonders of watching how planes were created. Going back to the Wright Brothers. Faye Dunaway done a brilliant job in her performance as Elaine. Her character was so creative and yet she was so protective of Axel. GREAT JOB FAYE!! Johnny Depp was incredible in this movie as well. Playing Axel was a tough job but in the end very rewarding. Watching him throughout this movie working and trying to make a plane that flys was interesting. Such a cute comedy with lots of twists and turns. Jerry Lewis was terrific and such a sense of humor. Very good job. If you like comedy's and things that's a bit bizarre you will love this. This is a masterpiece!! WAY TO GO EMIR for creating this spectacular film and your creative thinking. ,1368835200,,805,4.551724137931035
633848,2,6303369170,"This is one of my favorite films and was looking forward to seeing it again on DVD.  However, had to try 3 DVD players before one would accept it. This information was not made available when I purchased it.....why diid this happen???",1367625600,2,234,4.571428571428571

633852,5,6303369170,"We got this movie because my wife is a Depp fan (okay, I am too).  It's a strange movie... the characters are very odd... but it's great fun to watch.  Jerry Lewis was hilarious, Faye Dunaway was amazing... and oh yeah, Johnny Depp was great, as usual.  The story hangs together well, in spite of the ""Wonderland""-esque happenings.  But what's with that fish...?

Not a kid-friendly movie, but for grown-ups who like strangeness, it's worth seeing.",1355702400,,448,4.842105263157895
633903,4,6303369170,"This surreal 1993 fantasy from director Emir Kusturica is less about plot and more about the characters created by Jerry Lewis, Faye Dunaway, a fascinating Lili Taylor, and Johnny Depp himself. I can't think of anyone I'd rather watch tagging fish, selling Cadillacs, and making chicken noises while dressed in a petticoat.",1350259200,,323,5.230769230769231
633904,1,6303369170,"The beginning of the movie is visually exciting and has some interesting metaphors.  Alas, after that, it just wanders around grasping at allegory.  It's sort of wacky.  Sometimes it's almost funny. I wish that Jerry Lewis hadn't agreed to do this -- he can be so funny, but in this one, it just seemed needy and grasping.
Oh yes -- having had a suicide in my immediate family, that plot thread dampened my excitement - sort of scary actually. Some nice scenery -- I like the dogs.

Maybe I should have just read the book.  (lame joke - this couldn't have enough plot contiguity to make a book out of it).",1345593600,,605,4.414414414414415

I could talk about the pace of the film, the abstract, but human storyline, the incredible performances and directing job, but that would deny YOU the VIEWER, the actual joy of formulating your own impression. It IS brilliant, funny, quirky, etc., etc... and the reason why I'm writing this review is to encourage you to rent it, if you haven't already seen it. That's all. Just see it.

633906,5,6303369170,"Serbian director Kusturica made this beauty of a bizarre comedy in 1993. It seems to be little known in the US, though it has some American stars. Johnny Depp was still a boyish young man then, while Faye Dunaway and Jerry Lewis were quite a bit further along in their careers.

Apart from the ubiquitous white dog and the proliferating turtles, we have a flying halibut, weight-lifting balloons, not to forget Jerry Lewis speaking a local dialect of native Alaskan people, and Lili Taylor playing the accordion for all occasions, when she is not trying to commit suicide.
Depp is the center of the tale. He works in the New York fisheries service initially, where he tags fishes. Then he moves to Arizona to be with his uncle. At first he sells cars, and then he moves in with an older woman. The couple is obsessed with flying and builds various contraptions, often sabotaged by the woman's jealous step daughter.
There is a brother to the Depp character who is into old movies and who loves to re-enact the Cary Grant scene with the crop duster in North by Northwest. One should beware what one wishes for!

Remember the other movie scene where a departing space craft flies up and away across a full moon? I had references to that scene now in two movies in a row: first in In America, by Jim Sheridan in 2004, now here. Jerry Lewis is in an ambulance after a heart attack, and on the way to the hospital, the car is seen lifting up and flying past the full moon of Arizona.
What a lovely absurd film!
I am particularly impressed by Lili Taylor and wonder why she made not more of an acting career.",1327881600,3,1602,4.464163822525597
633907,5,6303369170,"Arizona Dream has to be my favorite ""odd little movie that could"". The first time I watched it, I became more than just a fan of Johnny. I became a lover of his courage while choosing projects. He typically does not make his decisions based on the amount of money he could earn. He waits for a script to speak to him, and picks from the heart. Though one could never be 100% sure of everything this quirky movie is trying to say... It obviously has a great deal of heart, and an over abundance of deliciously strange!",1319673600,5,517,4.285714285714286
633908,4,6303369170,"This movie is very different, but it was fun to watch. I would buy it again, and would say it is worth watching. Emir Kustarika is a very creative director, and besides that I worked on this movie as extras casting assistant.",1316822400,,225,4.380952380952381
633909,5,6303369170,"""Arizona Dream"" is a quirky little movie (made in 1991, released in Europe in 1993, and not in the US until 1994) directed by Emir Kusturica that starred Johnny Depp in the early part of his career, alongside veterans Jerry Lewis and Faye Dunaway, and rising contemporaries Lili Taylor and Vincent Gallo. The film had a very limited showing here in the States and for years went without an official US DVD release. In 2010, Warner finally came out with a US release under their Archives label, but this version is the original VHS release that inexplicably edits out 21 minutes from the original theatrical version -- what a shame. In contrast, there are non-US region 0 releases (NOT the one featured here, but available on Amazon) that include the full 140-minute theater version, in 16:9 widescreen, and in English with optional subtitles. Shoppers would be advised to seek those versions out.

The movie itself features Johnny Depp as a young man named Axel who is working for the Department of Fish and Game in New York Harbor tagging fish, but seems to yearn for some greater understanding of the world and people. His cousin Paul, played by Vincent Gallo, tricks him into paying a visit to Arizona to be the best man at the wedding of his uncle Leo, who raised him. Axel is briefly pursuaded to work in the showroom of his uncle's Cadillac lot, but is soon captivated by a visit from eccentric mother Elaine (Dunaway) and her daughter Grace (Taylor), and goes off to stay in their house in the desert. The rest of the film follows Axel's romance with the older Elaine, who longs to become untethered to the world with dreams of flying, and their mutual involvement in a love triangle of sorts with Grace, who herself dreams of and repeatedly attempts suicide. Axel tirelessly builds flying machines to help Elaine, Grace sabotages them (needlessly so, since they never work), Leo tries to rescue Axel away from them, and as Elaine becomes ever-more unhinged, Axel finds his affection transitioning from Elaine to Grace.

The overall tone is both tragic, as the characters struggle to understand and are thwarted in realizing their respective dreams, and absurdly comic, in their misguided efforts to do so. The entire film has a dream-like quality, as people sometimes find themselves levitating and Axel continues to see a flying flounder from his dream about an eskimo family depicted at the start of the movie (the film also bears the subtitle, ""The Arrowtooth Waltz,"" named for the Arrowtooth flounder... I only wish I could get past Kusturica having the flounder flying vertically, rather than correctly on its side as a flatfish), and there are recurring dramatizations of this dream in which Lewis and Depp take on the roles. Unquestionably an indie-arthouse flick, the quirkiness of the movie's characters allow the actors to shine -- Dunaway, in a performance that she would later infamously claim was ""brilliant,"" IS brilliant; Lewis renders an understated display of his comedic chops; Gallo gives hilarious performances renacting scenes from Raging Bull, North by Northwest, and the Godfather; Taylor is excellent as always; and Depp is wonderfully reined-in, reminscent of his role in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"" There's also a cute self-referential moment when Gallo mentions Johnny Depp, with Depp sitting quietly and unphased in the background.

I don't know what 21 minutes the Warner edition edited out, but if any of this sounds like your thing (or if, like me, you saw the movie when it first came out and were dying to revisit it), you'll want to find one of the full-length versions. It's an unassuming, quirky, imperfect, little masterpiece of filmmaking.",1301184000,6,3688,4.974068071312804

Oh sure. You could recount the plot. But try telling the story without Johnny Depp's clucking or Lily Taylor bungee-hanging from panty hose or Papua, New Guinea, North By Northwest or the turtle on the dinner table. I'll bet you can't.

The film itself is very off-the-beaten path.  Akin to ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" in that Depp's character is the one telling the story throughout.

By far the highlight of the film is Jerry Lewis.  The stellar comedian-actor-director-producer plays part himself, part a classic Paramount character, and part Jerry Langford (from ""The King of Comedy"").  The film is worth a gander even if you simply Fast Forward to his parts.

Johnny Depp gives an excellent performance, but it is another of his Edward Scissorshands distant characters. Lili Taylor also gives an excellent performance. Vincent Gallo's character is just too easy to do, so no points there.

So why the low rating? This is another of the current chic and trendy narratives that features ""quirkiness"" as a substitute for inquiry or reflection. There is no statement here. Things happen, and the virtue is in the nonsequitor and jarring juxtaposition of events. People of average ability should not be given big film budgets. And writers have to drill down a little further into the model novel ""100 Years of Solitude"" to find out that there is a *structure* underlying the mysteriousness of life depicted there.

But it so much easier to be a *fresh* director whose worldview is that all the ""ism's"" have been exhausted, and only absurdism reigns now. That is not correct, as movie-making itself is a form of ""consumerism"". And this film dishes out enough of the in-demand absurdism to satisfy the market, that's for sure.

As an antidote to this trend, read John Gardner, ""On Moral Fiction"" (available here at Amazon). It's not a stodgy right-wing Walt Disney thing at all. Gardner was a hard leftist, but one who had good theories about fiction and narrative.",1180569600,6,1403,4.961702127659574

634048,2,6303369170,"There are some lovely and funny moments in this movie (many of which have already been mentioned by other reviewers) but it doesn't all come together into an interesting or emotionally-satisfying story.

All the performances are very good but the characters' interaction rarely comes across as credible. For instance, I had difficulty understanding how Axel, as a relatively stable young man, could fall in love with Elaine or Grace. In the case of Elaine, she was physically older but emotionally much younger than him and very selfish. While reasonably attractive for her age, she was certainly far less of a beauty than Axel would have been capable of attracting given his own appearance. I can't accept it was all about her looks and I can't believe it was about her character.

Since the latter half of the movie is rooted in Axel's relationship and interactions with barely sane Elaine and morose and only slightly sane Grace, the two-dimensional nature of their characters undermine the end rather badly. The audience has to accept that the relationships between all characters are credible. I could not.

I think that movies with surreal images and bizarre characters beg to be admired for their adventurousness and thinking outside the box. I don't have a problem with the lack of conventional storytelling nor the strange characters. I have a problem only with how incomprehensible the links between some of those characters were. I think Axel needed to be a lot more bizarre in order to relate credibly with the odder characters or the odder characters needed to have a very concrete appeal for him which the story made explicit.

This isn't a bad movie. It simply isn't all that interesting to watch all the way through and rather disappointing at the end.",1115769600,5,1768,4.962837837837838

634051,2,6303369170,"Johnny Depp is a young man who comes to Arizona to be his uncle Jerry Lewis' best man in his wedding, and stays on to sell cars at the local family Cadillac dealership. There, Depp and buddy Vincent Gallo meet up with Lili Taylor and her weird stepmother Faye Dunaway. Taylor and Dunaway hate each other, living in a big house in the country and arguing continuously. Depp eventually falls for Dunaway, and is drawn into her weird little world, where she dreams of flying, and moving to Papua New Guinea.
Taylor has her own set of mental quirks- she worships turtles and wants to kill herself so she can come back as one. Gallo fancies himself a serious actor, one good scene has him recreate the cropduster scene from ""North by Northwest,"" on stage at a local talent contest. Paulina Porizkova is given nothing to do as Lewis' very young fiancee.
We have all these weird characters in a weird little comedy. There are funny scenes. Taylor tries to hang herself with pantyhose from a second floor balcony, and bungees up and down as Depp tries to save her. Depp, Taylor, Dunaway, and Gallo play a hilarious game of footsie at a dinner table. Taylor, depressed over her suicide attempt, begins wandering around the house playing the accordian. Depp and Dunaway begin building flying machines, trying to fulfill Dunaway's girlhood dream. The screen fills with weird special effects and tons of magical realist images. The eskimo prologue; a fish that swims in the sky; really interesting stuff.
About halfway through the film, everything takes an ugly turn. Depp and Taylor play a game of Russian Roulette. Lewis overdoses on pills, he is guilt-ridden because he drove the car in the accident that killed Depp's parents. Eventually, not a whole lot of plot happens. Instead, the film becomes obsessed with suicide, wallowing in the characters' unhappiness to the point that I may remove the COMEDY sticker from the video case and write MANIC DEPRESSIVE on it.
The cast, especially Taylor, is good, too good. I felt like they really understood their respective characters and the director's overall vision. Too bad they did not let the viewer in on it. I felt undermined by the cast and crew, and could not wait for the film to end.
The final scene, on the tundra, has Depp and Lewis talking to each other in Eskimo native language while ice fishing. A confusing ending to a confused film. I do not recommend this one.

  You can realy feel actors believe in what they're playing. Johnny Depp looks like a person not just an actor.

Johnny Depp works magic --again-- as the young, confused man who  is suckered into going to Arizona and becoming a car salesman, which he has  no desire for--he previously worked as a fishseller and catcher in NYC, and  would ""look into the fishes' eyes and read their thoughts"", which  is a far cry from bullheading someone into buying another piece of trash!  Yet he does not stay a car salesman for long. He falls in with an older  woman and her daughter, who cannot live together because they are too  similar--but who do, and fight every minute of the way. The daughter is  slightly odd; wanting to die and return as a turtle, as well as playing an  accordion full blast at just the exact wrong times....The mother is a  rather insecure woman who dreams of building a flying machine so she will  be able to soar. Axel begins an affair with the mother, which is quite  playful and freeing for both--one very funny scene is Johnny Depp wearing a  huge crinoline around his neck, being quite wild indeed with Faye Dunaway.  Eventually, the uncle comes and demands that Axel returns, which he  refuses, and when the uncle tries to take him by force, out comes Faye with  a long, double--barreled shotgun, which she is not afraid to use. The  cousin is really quite annoying, however, at one point he is being chased  by Faye's plane [which she got for her birthday] in a quasi--remake of the  famous North by Northwest chase, which was previously cited so that you  know what is going on. Eventually, the uncle dies, and Axel eventually  returns to the house of the women, where his mistress is mad that he spent  time with the corpse. But all is reconciled, by sex it would seem. The end  is strange, actually the whole thing is, but the end is somewhat  devastating, as well as having a sense of disbelief at itself--did we  really DO that?  However, this film is a gem, and there are so many  psychological aspects incorporated that it is easy to see why this one went  to Cannes. I highly recommend it, even if I only gave it 4 stars. That,  incidentally, was mainly because I felt there was not enough done with both  Axel's relationship with the daughter, and with his  ""movie--Eskimo--dream...."" which fits exactly with the film, down  to the enveloping of the woman for love....You'll see.
