8165106,5,B000LXGWRQ,"Winnetou has been perhaps the most popular youth story in the world since the 1880s - yes, for about 130 years! I have not met a mainland European who is not familiar with this story of the American West. In this series, the hero is the American Indian - and above all, Winnetou,  the young, brave, noble chief of the Mescalero Apaches.
