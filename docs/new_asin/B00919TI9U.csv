5240974,5,B00919TI9U,"I love House of Anubis. Unfortunately I am in the UK and can't afford Nickelodeon, so have to wait until someone decides to release the DVDs.

At the moment only the first volume is available in the UK, and I read in reviews that it ended on a big cliffhanger. To avoid it, I thought I was being smart by buying the volume 2 from here so I could watch the whole series through (I have a multi-region DVD player).

Word of warning for anyone else wanting to try that. I naively thought that the same episodes would be in the different region's volumes. I was wrong. They end in different places, which means I am missing an episode, ""House of Hasty"".

I guess at least it's only ten minutes or so, and easy enough to tell what happened in it, so if you really can't wait (like me) then I suppose go for it. Still, I'm very annoyed at whoever made that decision. And Amazon won't let me buy the individual episode because I'm not in the US. Although no-one stopped me having the DVD shipped over. Makes perfect sense ...",1390262400,5,1018,4.291666666666667

My daughter was so happy with her Christmas present.  It was also a region 1 DVD so my daughter was very happy about that as well.  If you or your children Love this show I recommend you buying it, that is why I gave it 5 stars.",1388793600,,355,4.318181818181818
5240977,5,B00919TI9U,"House of Anubis is a great show. An English mystery boarding school. The show is something different then the average Nickelodeon tv show. I pre-ordered the Volume 1 & 2 March 15th, 2013 and I received Volume 2 November 19th and as of now there's no release date for Volume 1, hopefully soon. I also uploaded pictures of Volume 2.

Nickelodeon please make Seasons 1 & 3 including The Touchstone of Ra on DVD soon!",1384819200,4,413,4.506666666666667

8533944,5,B00919TI9U,"Great series, good characters and story, good effects.  Characters you love to root for, or love to despise.  Too bad it was a short run, based on the school setting, they had to graduate sometime.  Some themes and situations may be scary for young kids, so I recommend this for adolescents and up.",1488326400,,298,4.584905660377358

These were the ones I purchased on her birthday.  She really enjoys them.  I think this show would be a hit with most teens and maybe even some younger adults.",1459123200,,428,4.2875
