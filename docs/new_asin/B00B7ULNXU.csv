8563731,5,B00B7ULNXU,"Exactly what I was looking for, since I teach a Vaganova based curriculum in my school. Clear, correct, and age appropriate.",1429488000,2,124,4.9523809523809526
8563732,3,B00B7ULNXU,"I really liked the attention to detail and the slow, well thought out build up of such basics as pas tendu and of course classical alignment and placement. Most of my training is in RAD, and so I missed seeing many of the elements I incorporate in my work with this age group - port de bras, balanc&eacute;, degag&eacute;, cambr&eacute;, temps li&eacute;, etc. and grand pli&eacute;s in 1st, 2nd, and third or 5th (of course still facing the barre). I am always eager to learn more and appreciate the information presented here!

Also, I too could not get the DVD's to play without problems. I know others have had the same experience. I had the same problems with all the DVD's I purchased from Ms. Stabrova ( I purchased four in total) - could not go from chapter to chapter - could only fast forward and then stop at the point I wanted to see.",1403481600,,846,4.458064516129032
8563733,5,B00B7ULNXU,This is an excellent demonstration of a well thought out class for pre-Level 1 ballet in the Vaganova school method which as Vaganova named it is the Method of Classical Ballet..  I highly recommend to any serious teacher along with the books of Kostrovitskaya with the sample lessons and the dictionnary of classiclal ballet of Kostrovitskaya and Pisarev,1389484800,3,355,5.120689655172414
8563734,5,B00B7ULNXU,"I cannot say enough about Inna Stabrova's beginner ballet and advanced beginner dvds. The way she works with her students is brilliant. I've never seen such simple and effective way of breaking down each exercise that builds on each other. I use Inna's approach in my ballet classes and I am seeing tremendous results. My students first thought it was simple and boring. Then after a couple weeks, their confidence has gone up because they see and feel the results in their bodies. They are excited to do the different exercises on the floor that she teaches in the dvd. I also see how age appropriate the turn out expectation level is where I know I am creating a safety boundaries. I highly recommend this dvd for those kids who can't afford to take classes but want excellent technique or to add on to what you are learning already at a local studio.",1382313600,5,853,4.5816993464052285
8563735,5,B00B7ULNXU,"This video is chock full of exercises for the beginning ballet student.  You can either do these strengthening and stretching exercise as a pre-ballet class or pick and choose exercises for your beginners to use to strengthen their weak areas.  I was pleased to find so many exercises that I have never used before with my 7 to 8 year old beginners.  I have sometimes become frustrated with my students lack of ability to look more like ballet dancers and i believe these exercises are the missing link.

I have very high expectations once I get my new crop of young ones and START them out with these exercises rather than just trying to give them basic ""real"" ballet.",1372550400,6,669,4.5966386554621845
8563736,5,B00B7ULNXU,I found this video a great supplement to any teachers teaching method. I've have been teaching beginner ballet students for 20 years and could still learn a lot of new ideas from this video!,1367452800,4,190,4.617647058823529
8563737,5,B00B7ULNXU,"The definitive video guide for teaching young children the true foundations of the Vaganova method. In this superbly comprehensive video, Ms. Stabrova educates in great detail how to prepare the young ballet student who only takes 2 lessons per week for the First Year's Work.  As the Vaganova Method was meant to be practiced 5 days per week this is positively invaluable to the majority of ballet teachers out there who may be frustrated with the lack of time made available to teach ""real"" ballet; which is often the case in most studios and dance schools. Ms. Stabrova faithfully follows Vaganova training methods and takes us through floor exercises, barre and center in a completely approachable, fun and yet eye opening way.  As the lesson progresses you will see how the lower back is developed, the feet and legs are formed and the beginnings of paulement are put into place so that the student is completely prepared for the first year Syllabus.  I have seen many children's ""pre-ballet"" and beginning ballet videos which claim to prepare the child for classical ballet training, and I can honestly say that NONE can hold a candle to this superbly done offering by Inna Stabrova.  Every serious ballet teacher - no matter what Method you teach, should own a copy!
