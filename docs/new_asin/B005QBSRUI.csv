4858207,1,B005QBSRUI,"I like low budget horror, Blair Witch, Paranormal Activity, Paranormal Entity and so on. However I just didn't get this, the set up was there, the acting was well, acceptable, but the camera work and directing was terrible, at times it felt like it wanted to be a hand held camera film, then it would move to a mounted camera and your standard acting fair. The premise was well thought out but such a terrible execution, no horror at all, no goosebumps, just a mild chuckle that I had wasted just over an hour and 30 minutes for possibly the worst ending to a horror, made even worse by the poorly buried head that any half decent Sheriff would have found!

However is giving the move 5 Stars and saying it's really scary have clearly never seen another horror film, or are in fact friends and family of the director!

Don't buy, don't watch, just ignore all the mock hype, nothing new here, nothing special and for sure nothing scary!",1327881600,,935,4.4941176470588236

4858209,5,B005QBSRUI,"What can I say that will give a best review of this film?  How about scary, terrifying, teeth chattering and everlastingly bazzar!  This is a creeper, I meant keeper.",1327708800,,166,4.689655172413793
4858210,5,B005QBSRUI,"The story-line grabs you, the scenery beckons you, and by the third act, you can feel your own floorboards trembling.
I advise watching it with all the house lights off, and the children safely strapped into their beds.",1327708800,,219,4.7894736842105265
4858211,5,B005QBSRUI,As a lover of this genre I really enjoyed this movie a great deal.  I totally recommend - especially if your a fan of Scary Stuff!,1327622400,,130,4.0
4858212,5,B005QBSRUI,"I had goosebumps on top of my goosebumps watching this movie! From an innocent, slow start it reels you in to the depths of fear.",1327622400,,129,4.2
4858213,5,B005QBSRUI,"If you liked Blair Witch and Paranormal Activity you'll LOVE Cold Creepy Feeling: Paranormal Exorcism. At times it's like a documentary, you feel like a bug on the wall observing the bizarre phenomena going on in this little ranch house in Joshua Tree. The performances by up and coming actors Lisa Younger, Jared Vanderberg, Dennis Woodruff and Alex Damiano are all top notch. The hauntingly beautiful music and superb cinematography make this a movie you don't want to miss. Oh, I forgot to mention SCARY. I've experienced the cold creepy feeling myself and I have to tell you it's no joke. When you feel a presence in your midst you know it. This movie is the most REAL paranormal film I've ever seen. You should experience it.",1327622400,,730,4.755905511811024
4858214,4,B005QBSRUI,"This is a wonderful psychological , scary as hell movie. What makes it so good, is that it's so real and totally believable. The actors draw you in completely. I loved it",1327536000,,170,4.34375
8483143,3,B005QBSRUI,Its a good movie all in all its kinda a ghost story i guess is the best way to put it no reall good blood and guts shown in this movie but if u want a ghost story this is the movie for you but myself i like lots of blood and gore,1392768000,,229,3.339622641509434
8483144,5,B005QBSRUI,"I liked it! I thought it was a well done ghost story, and while the plot is familiar, there was enough originality to the characters (including the evil presence in the house!) to make it fresh. I'm glad I bought it!",1374969600,,216,4.2926829268292686
8483145,5,B005QBSRUI,This has got that cool documentary feeling at point where it all seems too real. Made me squirm in my seat a few times. Good stuff.,1374710400,,131,4.076923076923077
8483146,1,B005QBSRUI,"I keep trying to think of a movie that is worse than this and to be fair, yes I can think of a few though I can't really remember the names. Did you ever buy a pack of 12 cd's that had a couple of movies that you've heard of and the rest filler that never would have made it to the theater or even be sold on video? It's one of those.  Let me think of some of the well known ""worst movies ever made."" Beast from Yucca flats? ...better than this.  Manos Hands of Fate? ...yep, better than this.

Okay now imagine that you just watched Paranormal Activity and you thought to yourself, ""Hey, I could make a movie like this!"" So you spent about 4 hours writing a script, then called 4 of your best friends and asked them if they wanted to be in a movie. Next you borrow a friend's house for the weekend. Buy a tarantula from the local pet store. Maybe a scarry wig and some ghost makeup. Ask your friend's band if they want to do a sound track. Then go out and film it. Find a friend who know how do do some video editing on the computer. And you're done. You've made a movie. Total budget around $100? And you probably see where I'm going... The movie you just made will likely be just as good or better than this one. Serious.

So, the seance scene. Light some candles. Sit around in a circle. Quickly the girl gets possessed starts freaking out and the seance turns into an exorcism. And what lines does the exorcist start using? Right. ""The power of Christ compels you! The power of Christ compels you!"" This felt as if somebody might have said ""You complete me,"" or ""You had me at Hello,"" or ""You can't handle the truth!"" or ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn.""

So anyway, I'm pretty sure that anybody who gave this movie a high rating is selling it. Consider yourself warned.",1363910400,,1781,4.195906432748538
8483147,1,B005QBSRUI,"Quite possibly the worst movie that I have ever seen, I am not exaggerating either.  It looks like a bunch of teenagers got together one weekend and tried to make a movie.  The acting is some of the worst that I have ever seen.  The plot is one of the worst I ever seen.  The dialogue is some of the worst I have ever seen.  You may think that I am being dramatic but I am not.  I truly believe this to be the worst movie that I have ever seen.  Actually, it's a crime to even call it a movie really.",1362528000,,500,3.843137254901961
8483148,4,B005QBSRUI,"I remember when Blair Witch Project came out. I loved it. My parents hated it. Anything on the cutting edge is going to have those that sing it's praises and those who bash it. Will you like it? I don't know, but I did.",1362355200,,219,4.0
8483149,1,B005QBSRUI,"Lisa Younger is, in a word, talentless. I googled her just to see if anyone else thought she sucked (they did), and though there was barely any info online about her, what there WAS was shocking. She's actually acted in other films!! How?! The male main character is no Robert Deniro himself but he gives an Oscar worthy performance in comparison to his female counterpart's. I really think she should be forced legally to give anyone who paid to watch this their money back, plus twenty bucks. She plays a struggling actress who can't get cast in anything, which I wish were only true. The girl playing the psychic is totally overdramatic and just as awful so no saving grace there. Decent storyline though- why I needed to see them walk around a ghost town for twenty minutes, pretending to be stuck in a jail, I don't know, however. The director is awful in all ways visible, including his acting. Final verdict: Snore.",1335657600,,922,4.662576687116564
8483150,1,B005QBSRUI,"Wow! I know I've never seen such a horrible, pointless and pathetic attempt for a movie in my whole life! The girl was stupid, literally!! Hard to not be embarressed for her and disgusted at the same time. The girl who preformed the ""exorsism"" if that is what she even did...i really don't know, but really cheesy and horrible. The movie was worse than watching a cheap porn.",1331078400,,375,4.529411764705882
8483151,1,B005QBSRUI,"The film centers on a young couple in California. He writes ""real"" ghost stories from interviews, but needs to do a rewrite. She is a waitress who ""can't buy a job"" as an actress and during their first conversation, you will know why. He put in a bid on a secluded ranch which he got, and the next moment they are ready to occupy, driving off in the Bimmer with an air mattress.

They take turns filming stuff along the way and thank goodness the producers had enough insight to also use the old fashion motion picture camera mounted on a tripod. Their journey was a waste of our time as it failed to build any character. You can fast forward through this aspect, get popcorn etc. It is sufficient to know they are both shallow airheads. You can fast forward until they get to the ranch. Really, you won't miss anything at all.

The film moves fast when it should be slow and slow when it should be fast. If you read the Amazon review or the title, you know cold creepy feeling things happen in the house that require an exorcism. After the first night, they opt to call their psychic exorcist friend who can be there the next day. Instead of wasting all that film shooting California yucca plants, Kurlander should have build up the cold creepy feeling slowly. The time the couple spends on the Internet...way too long. Get yourself a real film editor. We know your Idiot-Savant group did the sound track from the credits, was the additional plug necessary? Was that a trance or sleep walking Chloe was doing in her panties and boots? Did she sleep with those boots on? Looked a bit odd. Was that sunlight coming through the window in the night time bar scene or was the outdoor lighting nova bright?

I have dated women who have acted more possessed than Lisa Younger (sorry Terry, I told.) I was most shocked by the fact these people had other acting credits to their name. The scary part of the movie didn't last long and there was no explanation as to what happened, just bad hints. Keith Kurlander used himself and his own family as the ghost family, perhaps the most scary convincing thing on screen for all of 10 seconds. Keith Kurlander wrote, directed, acted in, produced, edited, etc. etc. this film. If you see Keith, he now owes me $2.

F-Bomb, sex, nudity (thank you Lisa Younger)",1329091200,,2294,4.494004796163069
8483152,4,B005QBSRUI,This little-known nugget of a spook flick features great visuals and an entertaining plot.  Perfect material for the entire family.  I definitely recommend it.,1327881600,,159,5.583333333333333
