I was very involved in the student movement which helped to remove His Majesty with the hopes of healthy socialist government and society that valued all the people.  It did NOT turn out that way.  I went to see this film by Haile Girima and was very moved by it.  The 3 of us sat and cried off and on.  When I think back to those days of the 70s, a line from a Bob Dylan song comes to mind: ""I was so much older then, I am younger than that now.""  Also a line from the New Testament: ""Jesus wept.""",1489622400,,588,4.15929203539823

8541026,5,B009FMJ5P0,"Teza is an excellent film concerning the journey of an Ethiopian intellectual's return home after being educated abroad in Germany. The film follows the journey of Anberber, a medical student who goes to Germany to be educated with the idea of returning to his homeland to do good and uplift his people.  While in Germany, Anberber becomes involve with a group of Ethiopian leftist radicals who are awaiting a revolution in Ethiopia. Once the revolution comes and the regime of Haille Selassie is toppled, Anberber returns home and his idealism is soon soured by the realities of the protracted civil war that follows. Beyond that his journey is also a return to memory, and the struggle between traditionalism and progression.  Teza is allegorical, poetic and filled with many haunting scenes and images of feudal life in the Ethiopian countryside. It raises many profound questions about what it means to return home.  There is now a US version for sale directly by the filmaker [...]  The version on offered at Amazon is the Italian version, does not play in US players and does not have english subtitles. The US home version for now is only being offered at Sankofa.com.",1352678400,5,1175,4.91919191919192
