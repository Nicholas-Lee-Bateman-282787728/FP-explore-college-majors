Nearly 50 years latter, I still remember the music score as one of the most lyrical I have ever heard.

Paris in a leopard print toga, sea foam green, lilac blue and various pastels with REALLY short skirts and that's just the guys!! That Lithuanian guy was absolutely gorgeous, never heard of him and I thought he could act given his Adonis looks. I found Helen to be of equal beauty and loved her many different complex hair designs. When did they have time for that in a 10 year war? Although Diane Kruger of ""Troy"" by comparison is most attractive, she is not a face that launched a thousand ships.

It really annoys me that the guise of war and evil is typically blamed on a woman. So we really are all that powerful folks?? Hmmmmm. Sheesh even Bethsheba gets blamed for all the woes of King David! And who could not get enough of the drunken orgies and rape scenes. Of course these chicks were asking for it....A lot! Poor Cassandra is also portrayed as a clueless dimwit, but the only voice of reason in the entire film.

OK so what about the action? Pretty amazing for 1956 and no David Lean. I was impressed although the fight scenes were less believable. Even the Greek warship head bongo banger kept missing the wood stump and wondered how they ever made it into town.

Despite the aforementioned misgivings, I was ""into it"" trying to decipher the differences between what I learned back in the day, other films, references, etc. It's very easy to bash a film from the confines of your bedroom notebook but I am trying to be more fair and balanced, BUT a tad of humor helps me write.

Recommend for a stylized historical perspective of many moons ago and to keep you wondering what happens on the return trip....YIKES!!! ;}}",1441929600,,1673,4.54485049833887

777542,4,6304071787,"When it comes to Trojan War, Japanese people are more associated with the biography of Heinrich Schliemann or the Trojan Horse a trick that destroyed the Troy than Helen of Troy who was so beautiful that it became the cause of Trojan War. In Japanese we have similar expression with Femme Fatale, KEIKOKU-NO-BIJO, which derived from legendary beauties in China which caused the demise of the Chinese Empires or Dynasties such as Yang Guifei who clouded the judgement of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang Dynasty China in mid 8th century.

To me The Helen of Troy directed by Robert Wise in 1956 is more like adult adaptation of Romeo and Juliet(Robert Wise did modern adaptation of Shakespearean play with West Side Story). Mythological element was eliminated and made it more like a periodical drama in Roman and Greek eras. The highlight is the presence of Trojan Horse disguised as a gift to Troy but expert soldiers were hidden to launch a surprise attack. While it is a nice film to get you interested in the epic which took place more than 3,000 years ago, it may not be fully satisfactory for both Iliad fans and historical buffs. First of all to be fully true to Homer's Iliad, it needs a multi-season TV drama just like Spartacus. Description of Spartans are stereotypical of long held image of brutal and cunning just like other films set in Greek eras. Particularly Achilles' villainous character setting may antagonize Odyssey fans. Forget Homer, historical accuracy, and just enjoy the love romance set in the turning point in history, then you can enjoy this film.

Verdict: Well-made Trojan War movie
Rating: 86 out of 100

777545,2,6304071787,"A historical yawn, in which Paris (Jacques Sernas), without his crazy sister's blessings, takes a boat trip and returns with a wife (someone else's, but close enough).  Naturally, the EVIL Spartan's are a bit peeved, especially the husband of said bride (Niall MacGinnis as the put upon hubby.  ""She must be restored to me!""  And Rossana Podesta as the wandering wife and the cause of all the trouble, Helen of Troy).  A more apt title for this exercise in futility would have been Much Ado About Nothing.  This movie is long and yappy and long and yappy.............  You wouldn't know it was in color but for the claim at the start, the transfer is almost muted to a gray scale.  The narration is unnecessary and not to be believed.  The acting requires a lot of posturing and pontificating on everyone's part.  At this point in time everyone knows not to accept horses as gifts, especially ones with clearly detected trapdoors in their bellies.  As far as spectacles go, this one is all pomp and no circumstance.  Some of the battle sequences were shamelessly copied from D.W. Griffiith's film Intolerance.  This movie puts the humdrum in ho-hum.

777573,5,6304071787,"This is not Homer it is Hollywood Old Style. When a Cast of Thousands were real people and not found in a computer. I saw this as a boy of nine when it first came out and it stuck with me. Robert Wise directs a mostly British group of actors such as Harry Andrews, Stanley Baker and Sir Cedric Hardwick in the version of the love of the Trojan Prince Paris for the wife of Agamemon Helen ""The Face that Launched a Thousand Ships"".

The film has a restored Overture which is not complete, because portions are still lost but it will give the viewer the since of what his 1956 production was when it came out. Playing Helen is Rosanna Podesta who did not speak a word of English and had to have a voice coach train her for her lines and she does an excellent job. The year before this production she co-starred with Kirk Douglas in an Italian film version of Homer's Odyssey by Carlo Ponte entitled ""Ulysses"".

There is something so real about some of these old classics which seems to get lost in the modern, computerized versions. Paris and Helen are very convincing; the Greeks' meeting to decide upon their actions and the actual siege of Troy are believable and monumental. There is a secret wish to see the Trojans triumphant for as long as possible with the knowledge of the final act. Sir Cedric makes a great Priam, wise and with a certain forboding at times. Also, look for a new face as Helen's maidservant in Greece, Bridgitte Bardot.",1389225600,,619,4.6880733944954125
777576,5,6304071787,"This is a fictional love story based on the legend of Helen of Troy.

I saw in the movies when I was a boy and, inspite of its many distortions, I still love it. Is there any more exciting story than the Iliad? WB pushed it and promoted it on TV and I was eager to see it. Luckily, I knew nothing much about any of the translations on the Library Shelves and I don't read Greek, so, I was at the mercy of the screenwriters.

Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this film was the casting of Rosanna Podesta and Jack (Jacques) Sernas as Helen and Paris. Rosanna was a gorgeous Helen. The Italian actress wore a blonde wig and her voice was dubbed by someone who could speak English. Frenchman Jacques Sernas spoke no English and so his voice was also dubbed and his hair dyed. They were a beautiful couple to behold. Sir Cedric Hardwicke, his reign as Pharoah in THE TEN COMMANDMENTS now over, became King Priam of Troy. Janette Scott played Cassandra, one of the more interesting characters. If you remember, she was given the gift of prophecy, but the Gods always give a curse along with a gift. Her curse was that no one would ever believe her predictions. Stanley Baker made a compelling Achilles. You will see a very young servant girl named Andraste. It's a small part but a noticeable one. I remember when I first saw it thinking to myself ""That girl is just as beautiful as Helen!"" Her name was Brigitte Bardot, and a short time she would become a bigger star than anyone else in this movie.

All the requisite plot elements are here. Helen and Paris are nice people; just a couple of star-crossed lovers who would be happy to run off and live as commoners but they cannot do so. The ships, armies and battle scenes are here, amplified by the great Max Steiner's magnificents score; and, oh yes, there's that horse.

What's missing here are the interactions with the Gods and Godesses. Stll, it's great fun and I have yet to see anyone do a better job than Robert Wise. Take it with a grain of salt and then read a translation. This is the type of movie that got me interested in the Iliad and the Odyssey and so, it deserves credit for that, if for nothing else.",1385510400,,2172,4.382133995037221
777577,4,6304071787,"Well made A-grade glorified sword-and-sandal film.  Top-notch Hollywood production values and pretty OK when it comes to sticking to history, as far as anyone can know.  The movie gets its class from the many classically-trained British actors in the supporting roles.  The leads are played by Jacques Sernas, a French actor as Paris and Rossana Podesta, an Italian actress as Helen.  They are obviously dubbed.  Sernas, physically fills the bill as Paris.  Podesta, though lovely, seems just too regularly pretty as Helen.  I always imagined Helen as so beautiful that she would defy description.  Realistically no actress could fill that part.  Though good the film is not as entertaining as the more silly sword-and-sandal films that would shortly follow.  Recommended viewing for, as I said, its production values.",1385510400,,818,5.3203125

777621,4,6304071787,"Long, long time ago, when I was still a child, I watched this film with my eyes wide-open and I simply adored it! It encouraged me to read the ""Iliad"" rather early in my life and therefore this film certainly had an influence on my destiny.

Made in 1956 this is an old film and it certainly aged, but after watching it recently I still enjoyed it and it is definitely BETTER than the disastrous ""Troy"" with Brad Pitt. Many of the more spectacular moments still make considerable impression, as the scene of the first assault against walls of Troy, the entry of Trojan horse to the city or the festivities in Troy following the retreat of Greek armies.

This being a Hollywood retelling of Iliad, the story is of course greatly changed, but at least the war still lasts 10 years (unlike in ""Troy""). Paris (Jacques Sernas) is here shown in a light much more favourable than in the original text and both Menelaus (Niall MacGinnis) and Agamemnon (Robert Douglas) are much more despicable. Helen is played by the Italian sex-bomb Rossana Podesta and she is indeed a very pleasant sight, even if she is not exactly a very good actress. Other characters are shown very well: Achilles (Stanley Baker) is a snotty capricious primadonna, Hector (Harry Andrews) is a very noble prince, Odysseus (Torin Thatcher) is a weasely but rather charismatic scoundrel, Ajax (Maxwell Reed) is basically an ape and Cassandra (Janette Scott) is a particularly tragic character, so desperate that borderline insane. A very pleasant thing is the appearance of very young Brigitte Bardot as Andraste, Helen's slave and confidante.

The one really disappointing thing in this film is the duel of Achilles and Hector, as it is very short and anti-climactic. On another hand, the final fate of Troy is a very strong scene, although we are at least spared the killing of little Astyanax, Hector's son (but not what happened to Cassandra...).

In conclusion, I think that this film still deserves four stars, even if it was made in a different world and it aged a lot. As I said above, this film was one of my important viewings when I was a little boy. Also, I watched it recently with my 11 years old daughter (there is no foul language in it and no graphic violence) and she was fascinated - she asked me a lot of questions about Trojan War and then looked for more on internet. And that in itself justifies the buying of this film and the little shelf space which I gave to it. Enjoy!",1355097600,,2458,4.64367816091954
777622,4,6304071787,"After the 10 minute Max Steiner Overture we get a 3000 BC Aegean travelogue with focus on the happy people of King Priam's Troy. Right away the adaptation departs seriously from Homer. Paris is on a trade mission to the Greeks and is tossed overboard by a storm, washing up on Sparta where Helen is beach combing. In The Iliad according to Homer Paris was sent to Sparta to ask Menelaus to influence his brother Agamemnon for the return of Priam's sister who was taken captive during the previous sack of Troy by Heracles. This is mythology, not history, and there are a lot more details distorted for the sake of movie making. Max Steiner delivered a very heroic and noisy score to back up the epic grandeur and battles. The production is a lavish and beautifully photographed Technicolor epic typical of the period with a good looking cast and a lot of action. Not too bad.",1333065600,2,875,4.579617834394904

777624,5,6304071787,"This classic retelling of the Trojan War (partly recounted in Homer's epic poem ""The Iliad"") and the woman with ""The face that launched a thousand ships"" is a good one, if inconsistent with several major and minor events of the legend. SPOILER WARNINGS: For example, all the characters are referred to by their Greek names, yet Odysseus is called Ulysses, his Roman name. Odysseus does not come up with the idea for the Trojan Horse as the ships land at Troy and puts this idea into execution once Achilles is foully murdered by Paris. Odysseus clearly does not respect Achilles very much, and Patroclus is not murdered by Paris. SPOILER WARNINGS OVER. These are just several inconsistencies with the legend, as related in ""The Iliad."" Look out for appearances by minor pre-""Ben-Hur"" and pre-James Bond actors Terence Longdon and Robert Brown.

777628,5,6304071787,I remember seeing this film on Television in the early 1960's and later in the 1970's and loved it.  it fits bulfinches mythology to the tee.  This fim was done in 1955 by Warner Brothers.  Since then there have been at least three other versions of Helen of Troy-the latest was Troy with Brad Pitt as the headline actor.

777629,5,6304071787,Robert Wise did a fantastic job on this epic.  The production design is magnificent.  Forget digital effects -- this is the real thing!  What you see is full scale in scope and number of actors.  Stanley Baker shines.  The bonus features are also great.  It is sad that this is being over-shadowed by newer (and weaker) versions.  But Warner Bros. got top people to spend a fortune in making this a respectable epic.,1273795200,3,416,4.616438356164384
777630,3,6304071787,"In the 1950's and lasting well into the early 60's, there was virtual flood of 'sword and sandal' epics. This is one in which Warner Brothers invested a great deal, and were rewarded with a lackluster effort. While ""Helen of Troy"" is not a bad film, it just isn't that great.

My main problem was with the cast. There's just not any real stand-outs. Stanley Baker (Achilles), who's been a favorite of mine since seeing him in 'Zulu', is limited to acting pissy and having a few emotional outbursts. Even Sir Cedric Hardwicke (King Priam), who did such a fine job in 'The Ten Commandments', barely gets enough screen time to show his talent. Harry Andrews, an instantly likeable British actor who plays Hector. You would expect Troy's greatest warrior to have a buff, youthful and handsome appearance. Instead we have Andrews, who, with his middle-aged looks and beard, would seem more at home behind the wheel of a big rig and wearing a John Deere cap. And then there's Rosanna Podesta as Helen. She is not hard on the eyes, far from being ugly. But unfortunately, she's also far from being the jaw-dropping beauty of legend whose face launched a thousand ships. Her performance, like most others in the film, wavers between wooden and one-dimensional to cautiously restrained. Even composer Max Steiner delivers a sub-par effort, failing to give any memorable flourishes as he did so well with 'Gone With The Wind' and 'A Summer Place'.

French actor Jacques Sernas as Paris (listed as Jack Sernas in the credits) and Torin Thatcher as Ulysses had two of the better roles. Torin in particular seemed right at home and very much at ease in front of the camera. Sernas much less so, but still gave a decent performance.

Director Robert Wise had the unenviable job of squeezing a legendary event, which transpired over the course of several years, into a 2 hour movie. He managed to produce a surprisingly balanced effort. The blood and battle scenes, although well filmed, were tame by today's standards and lasted just long enough to see the true chaos that any ancient war would have been. These scenes were counterbalanced by the internal political conflicts taking place in Greece and Troy, caused by the ill-fated lovers Paris and Helen, as well as their own romance. Their relationship never develops any real sparks, probably a result of 1950's morality, but it never sinks to the level of soap opera stupidity either. The DVD transfer looks really good. The colors seem muted but bright, and overall picture and sound quality is excellent. Even the special effects, limited as they were, looked quite good for a film of this era. And done back in the day when special effects had to be done the hard way, not by some geek sitting at a computer.

Overall, a pretty decent film. Not outstanding, but a good choice for a rainy day when there's nothing better to watch. A movie that's worth at least one good viewing, and that will probably be enough.",1261699200,2,2955,4.765625

Jack was with his wife?

Anyway, I had missed the theatrical run of HELEN OF TROY. Rossana Podesta was the female lead and Brigitte Bardot had a small part in the beginning.

This was made in the '50's or '60's. It cannot compare with the new TROY starring Brad Pitt. But the actions scenes are spectacular. No computerized imaging (CGI) in those days. Real cast members and hundreds in the battle scenes. Jack is extremely handsome as is beautiful Rossana.

They even give her some sort of Spartan reserve which is missing in the newest version Troy.

The acting is well done. I didn't expect it to be as good as it was really and I really enjoyed it. I also felt that the costumes and sets were pretty well done also and that this movie moved along at a good pace. Many movies from this era, and the 60's, tend to bog down in details that were never really needed. This film doesn't do that.

777656,3,6304071787,"Warner Bros.' Cinemascope rendition of the events of the Trojan War has been pretty much forgotten now, thanks in large part to its cast of mostly unknowns: though Sir Cedric Hardwicke is here (inevitably), the rest of the cast was pretty unknown to movie audiences then as it still is today. The Italian actress Rossana Podest is Helen, and the French actor Jack (Jacques) Sernas is her lover Paris, who somehow is turned into the movie's hero. Both Podest and Sernas were probably chosen for the extreme beauty of their chests, but they're both exceptionally likeable in their roles. There are a lot of British stage actors in the other familiar parts: Stanley Baker is Achilles, Robert Douglas is Agamemnon, Niall MacGinnis is Menelaus, and Nora Swinburne is Hecuba. (The latter's particularly exquisite enunciation affords many of the film's unintentional comic highlights.)

It all could have been fairly disastrous, and the familiar events of legend are collapsed as much as possible so as all to be fitted into two hours. But it helps immensely that Robert Wise is the director and keeps things moving at a fair clip, and that the studio went pretty much all out on the sets and extras. Troy is made to look much like the reconstruction of the Palace at Knossos in Crete, with tapered red columns and bull-horn decorations (the latter more appropriate to the palace of King Minos than that of Priam, but what the heck). It's all every bit as silly as TROY, the 2004 telling of the same basic story, but this version is much more compulsively watchable.",1187136000,6,1559,4.8389513108614235

777658,3,6304071787,"Of all the great stories handed down through the ages, few can equal Homer's Iliad - a towering epic of warrior heroes, squabbling gods, and anger that destroyed nations...

This is the source for Robert Wise's film... All the elements of a magnificent spectacle exist in Homer's work - a lavish and decadent court life, the tension of the quarrel between Achilles and Agamemnon, the most beautiful woman in Greece, and a drama of love and seduction...

Thousands of weapons are used: spears, bows, arrows, body armor, helmets, shields, maces and ships of the period l200 B.C., plus a tremendous wooden horse...

Paris, on a diplomatic mission to Sparta to arrange peaceful trade, is washed up on the Spartan shore after being shipwrecked during a storm... He is helped by the lovely Helen who claims to be a handmaiden to the queen... She takes her leave, directing him to the court of King Menelaus... Paris is greeted and honored in a 'cesti' combat with Ajax... Secretly, however, Menelaus plots to kill his guest...

Helen warns Paris of the danger to his life and urges him to run away... Herself in danger for revealing the plot, she succumbs to Paris' pleadings to flee with him... The lovers make their way to Troy...

From that point the spectacular elements - the massing of the ships and men, and the battles outside the walls of Troy, take over...

Rossana Podesta - a natural brunette given a blonde wig and the classical Grecian look - plays Helen, the indirect cause of the Trojan War, but for Paris, she is the goddess of love and beauty, ""Aphrodite.""

Jacques Sernas plays Paris... His seduction of Helen and refusal to return her, started the Trojan War...

Robert Douglas is Agamemnon, the commander in chief of the Greek forces... He calls on the kings and princes to unite in a war of revenge against the Trojans... He was a very ambitious man, dreaming of Troy's treasures...

Stanley Baker is Achilles, the unbeatable warrior, the greatest and most tragic of the Greek heroes...

Harry Andrews is Hector, the eldest son of king Priam, and the husband of Andromache... He is the chief warrior of the Trojan army...

Niall MacGinnis is the furious Menelaus, King of Sparta, who calls on his brother Agamemnon to gather an army and avenge the mark of shame...

Torin Thatcher is Ulysses, king of Ithaca, the man of outstanding wisdom...

Sir Cedric Hardwicke is the powerless but kindly King of Troy...

Janette Scott is Cassandra, daughter of Priam, loved by the goddess Athena... With a great spirit of prophecy she warns her father to burn the wooden horse...

Robert Wise makes a brave attempt to marry the intimate with the spectacular - a difficult task - but ""Helen of Troy"" is an epic movie, a superior entertainment filmed in CinemaScope and Technicolor..",1167609600,,2785,4.809224318658281
777659,2,6304071787,"The script of ""Helen of Troy"" is so full of improbable silliness and stilted dialogue it is matched only by the wooden acting that in the 50s seemed a requirement of Hollywood epics.  In the end it spoils the spectacular sets and occasionally effective cinematography.  The sack of Troy sequence at the end of the movie almost redeems it, and I am almost tempted to raise my rating for that alone.  But then I remember the hash they made of the actual seige, with medieval seige engines and uninspired choreography.  Paris is played as a 50's hunk who completely upstages Hector.  There's no hint of the spoiled, self-indulgent womanizer.  Worse, the romance between him and Helen fell a little flat.  It's worth having a look at if you are a fan of this genre, as I am, but otherwise it disappoints.",1111276800,5,800,4.631205673758865
777660,3,6304071787,"I see that this 50s spectacle, ""Helen of Troy"", has attracted a number of favourable reviews--although a couple of these reviews seem to be as ""epic' as the story in the film ! Very loosely based on Homer's ""Iliad"", and released on DVD no doubt to coincide with the new version of this tale in theatres,
 ""Troy"", ""Helen of Troy"" remains an enjoyable experience. It has fine production values--sets, costumes, cinematography--and an experienced director in Robert Wise.

 The plot is not too complicated, at least in this ""Coles Notes"" adaption of Homer's work. The Trojan prince, Paris, visits Greece on a peace mission and meets Helen, the wife of the Greek king, Menelaus. Paris and Helen fall for each other, and run off back to Troy. Of course, "" this means war ""--besides, the Greeks wanted war anyway ! The second half of the film is taken up with the siege of Troy, and there are some spectacular battle scenes here, with real people ! No digital effects in those days ! There is also a large, wooden horse--but you knew that, didn't you ?

 The supporting cast is mostly British--Sir Cedric Hardwicke, Harry Andrews, Janette Scott, Niall McGuinness, Torin Thatcher, Ronald Lewis and, as a perpetually-glowering Achilles, Stanley Baker, are all solid and professional. The two leads, however, went to unknown non-Brits, and perhaps this is what interests me the most about ""Helen of Troy"". This must have been an expensive production--why did the lead roles not be given to big names ? The beautiful, curvaceous Italian actress, Rossana Podesta, is Helen--while not a great actress, it is not difficult to imagine grown men fighting over her ! As Paris, we have French actor, Jacques Sernas, billed of course as ""Jack"". While he has a striking appearance, his acting skills--at least in this film--appear to be zero. If I had Rossana Podesta throwing herself at me ( yes--I know--sweet dreams ! ), I think I would be a little more animated than Mr. Sernas. While he continued to enjoy a long career in European productions, it's easy to see why Hollywood did not come calling again ! Speaking of France, a young French actress plays Helen's handmaiden--within a year, Brigitte Bardot would become more famous than any actor in ""Helen of Troy"".

 The colour, wide-screen DVD is gorgeous. There is also a trailer, and some black and white promotional material released at the time, featuring actor, Gig Young.

 Overall, I would give ""Helen of Troy"" three and a half stars--it is not as grand as say "" The Ten Commandments"", also released in 1956--but if you like old-fashioned historical spectacles, where entertainment takes precedent over authenticity or literary merit, you will find this DVD an enjoyable addition to your collection.",1091491200,39,2743,4.9327548806941435
777661,3,6304071787,"Having seen Troy, the blockbuster from the Hollywood ""Pitt of horror,"" I also aver that other efforts to tell the story of the Iliad have met with limited success.  Take the case of Helen Of Troy, the 1955 movie with Rossana Podesta and an all-star British cast.  Despite its near two-hour length, it's all splashy pageantry with no substance, with all sorts of liberties taken with Homer's tale.
In this version, Paris, en route to Sparta on a peace mission with his cousin Aeneas, is swept overboard, and rescued from Menelaus's soldiers by Helen.  Menelaus is portrayed as a portly bearded unloving tyrant, similar in Troy, but he nevertheless rallies Agamemnon, Nestor, Diomedes, Achilles, and Ulysses (he's not called Odysseus here) when Paris and Helen flee and sets sail for Troy.
Naturally, Paris is condemned by nearly every Trojan for bringing the Greeks to their doorstep.  Helen of course still cherishes him, as does his brother Polydorus, someone all too eager to spill some Spartan blood.  Priam's wife Hecuba is the only other one to show sympathy for Helen.
Another contrast between this and Troy is that the latter spends too much time on certain aspects, whereas Helen Of Troy only brushes the surface.  The conflict between Agamemnon and Achilles over Briseis played a huge part in Troy.  Here, Briseis is not even mentioned by name, but Achilles refuses to fight per the Iliad.
So what does work?  The costumes on both sides, the actual ships with oars and the sight of marching Greek phalanxes, and the city of Troy itself is of good 50's quality.  And the grief on Andromache's face is visible on her face, as she realizes that Hector is about to be killed--pretty good for the 50's.
However, anachronistic errors include the medieval wooden towers the Greeks use to scale the walls of Troy and the battering ram.  The funniest are the leopard or jaguar skins worn by Achilles and at one point Hector.  Achilles, king of the jungle... yeah right!  And the statue of Athena is so grotesque that I wondered if I was looking at Medusa, or worse yet, Kali.
As for the performers, Harry Andrews was an interesting choice as Hector.  Ronald Lewis shines as Aeneas, as does as Nora Swinburne as Hecuba and Robert Brown as Polydorus.  But Janette Scott as Cassandra is my favourite, a slip of a girl maddened by the gift of foresight, yet doomed not to be believed.  And Jacques Sernas's wooden blonde, blue-eyed Paris was clearly meant for the women at the time.  He does bring shame to Troy, but he's more of a fighter here than Orlando Bloom's version, as he bests Ajax in Sparta.  However, Stanley Baker's Achilles leaves much to be desired.  Brigitte Bardot has a small part as Andraste, Helen's cute personal slave, before she became a blonde temptress in the 60's and much worse later.
Movies in the 1950's only took a superficial cliched approach to novels or classics, with a sheer disregard for accuracy (Paris kills Patroculus here, not Hector), and that is Helen Of Troy's Achilles heel.  At the sight of the Greek ships massing along the Aegean, Priam says the phrase of ""the face that launched a thousand ships.""  I'd probably launch a few row boats after this Helen, but not a thousand ships.  Later, it is Helen who seeing the wooden horse wheeled in, steals Laocoon's line:  ""Timeo danaos et dona ferente.""  Or in English per the movie, ""Beware of Greeks bearing gifts.""  A not bad, though dated effort, especially for those used to hoards of digital armies and gory violence.",1088553600,9,3508,4.779436152570481
777707,4,6304071787,"First of all, anyone who depends upon films to understand history (especially ancient history) is on a fool's errand. Moreover, both of Homer's epic poems possess a scope and depth which simply cannot be accommodated within a film with a running time of less than 15-20 hours. That said, this is a generally entertaining presentation of the basic plot: Prince Paris of Troy (Jacques Sernas) visits Sparta, falls in love with Queen Helen (Rosanna Podesta) and she with him, they return together to Troy, her outraged husband Menelaus (Nial MacGinnis) organizes an army and follows them, lays siege to the city, and eventually Troy is occupied and then obliterated.
Most of the film's tension (such as it is) involves Achilles (Stanley Baker) and his adversarial relationships with Menelaus and Agamemnon (Robert Douglas) and then with Prince Hector (Harry Andrews) whom he slays in hand-to-hand combat. This is an above average spectacle, comparable with predecessors Samson and Delilah (1949) and Demetrius and the Gladiators (1954). By no means a great film, nonetheless Helen of Troy (as directed by Robert Wise) offers generally solid acting throughout its cast and several memorable battle scenes without benefit of digital technologies when filmed in 1955. Yes, that's Brigitte Bardot as Andraste and Eduardo Ciannelli as Andros. And yes, I enjoyed seeing this film again, motivated to do so after seeing Wolfgang Petersen's Troy. The inclusion of various gods and goddesses in the earlier film now seems silly but the absence of a ""superstar"" such as Brad Pitt in one of its lead roles is (at least for me) refreshing.",1087948800,27,1624,5.15530303030303
777708,4,6304071787,"After watching the current big budget film ""Troy"" and complaining bitterly about what the screenplay did to Homer, Euripides, and other ancient writers it seemed time to finally check out the 1956 Hollywood version of ""Helen of Troy,"" which stared Rossana Podest in the title role and Jack Sernas as Paris.  Podest was an Italian sex siren her had to learn her lines by rote in English and who was picked over established stars including Elizabeth Taylor, Lana Turner, Rhonda Fleming, Ava Gardner and Yvonne DeCarlo for the part of Helen.  Of course, it is hard to say she is the most beautiful woman in the film let alone the world since Brigitte Bardot is playing Andraste.
The script by Hugh Gray, N. Richard Nash, and John Twist, does a good job of including the goddesses Aphrodite and Athena without having them literally appear.  The idea of the pact among the princes of Greece to decide who would win Helen's hand and the promise to defend anyone who violated the pact is ignored.  Helen's father, the king of Sparta, just married her off to Menelaus (Niall MacGinnis), who, along with his brother, Agamemnon (Robert Douglas), is interested in attacking Troy to take its riches.  The kings of Greece have gathered in Sparta to plan the attack when Paris comes along, falls in love with Helen, and steals her away to Troy.
Once there, nobody is happy to see this development. King Praimus (Cedric Hardwicke) and Hector (Harry Andrews) are upset over the fact the Greeks are going to come to attack Troy and the priestess Kassandra (Janette Scott) is crying gloom and doom, but, of course, nobody is listening to her.  The people even come to throw things at Paris and his woman but he sways them with a short speech.  Of course, nothing is going to stop the Greeks, because Helen is just an excuse for conquering the rich city that controls the Dardanelles (the importance of which is explained in the prologue), and we are treated to the spectacle of 30,000 men fighting it out on the plains of Troy in glorious Warnercolor.
In terms of Homer's ""Iliad,"" the wrath of Achilles (Stanley Baker) has to do with the fact that he flat out does not like Agamemnon, which is made clear the first time we see them together in Sparta.  At some point he starts pouting in his tent.  The death of Patroclus (Terence Longdon) still sets into motion the chain of deaths that defined the end of the Trojan War, but the context is different and reinforces the idea that the Trojans are the good guys.  The extension of that is that our young lovers deserve to live happily ever after.  But will the screenplay violate the classical story that far?  Wily Odysseus (Torin Thatcher) comes up with the stratagem of a rather impressive looking Trojan Horse and the end game of the ten year war is played out.
Like ""Troy,"" this version also avoids the worst part of ""The Trojan Women"" by Euripides, allowing Andromache (Patricia Marmont) to flee with Aeneas (Ronald Lewis) instead of having her endure her baby boy being tossed off the walls of Troy (which reminds me: for future reference, finish looting a city before you start burning it).  But once again Hollywood proves that when it comes to adapting Homer and the rest of the story of the Trojan War they always think they can improve on the original.  Yet despite the spectacle there are no transcendent moments in this film, let along the dramatic highpoints of the epic poem by Homer.
The battle sequences are certainly spectacular and much better than the individual combat sequences, so it is hard not to favor the marching formations of the thousands of extras with their spears and shields over the CGI tens of thousands we saw in ""Troy.""  Director Robert Wise gives the action a sense of classical splendor while Max Steiner's rousing score standing out a lot more than the dialogue.  There is an interesting feel to that dialogue and the performance of actors, most of whom are British and classically trained.  They are not doing Shakespeare, but they give the drama a certain weight.  There is no real passion between Helen and Paris, but at least he has the virtue this time around of being a real prince of Troy, capable of going toe to toe with Ajax (Maxwell Reed).
The DVD contains the original trailer, with its hyperbolic titles, and a trio of black & white featurettes by Gig Young for some sort of 1950s television movie show in which he promotes ""Helen of Troy.""  Ultimately this is a respectable version of the classical story and if it is not great at least it does not have any of those transcendantly bad moments found in so many of the European sandal-and-spear spectacles.",1086307200,19,4642,4.687576875768758
777709,4,6304071787,"This rendition of the story of Troy was probably, like last years's miniseries, brought out because of the recent release of Brad Pitt in ""Troy"".  However, this film can well stand on its own with a literal cast of thousands, grand sets, beautifully done action scenes both large and small, and a very good cast of mostly British/European actors. Stanley Baker and Harry Andrews stand out above the rest as Achilles and Hector and they both do well in their single combat scene towards the end of the picture.  Rosana Podesta does look like an Aphrodite clone and is far more appealing, in my eyes, than the actress who was in the recent miniseries.  Admittedly there is some overacting--especially by Sir Cedric--but these were part of the acting style when the film was made.

I wondered how I would feel about it after seeing ""Troy"" with Orlando Bloom playing a rather whimpy version of Paris.  I felt no chemistry between Paris and Helen in this new version.  I ordered the original and it still stands out as a classic and cannot be replaced with expensive special effects.  ""Helen of Troy"" has a heart and the audience is compelled to hope that Helen and Paris can have a life together.  In the new version, it didn't matter to me if they stayed together or not.  I highly recommend ""Helen of Troy"" for the discerning movie viewer.",1085875200,13,687,4.362204724409449
777711,5,6304071787,"Shakespeare has a defeated Richard the Third declare he would give his kingdom for a horse. Here is the story of how the Greeks gave a horse, albeit a wooden one, and conquered a kingdom. ""Helen of Troy"" was made by Warner Bros. in the 1950s heyday of the screen epic movie,and it shows in the production values. The story tells of how Prince Paris of Troy undertakes a peace mission to warlike Sparta whose King Menelaus, husband to Helen, whilst feigning friendship is actually plotting, with his Greek allies, an attack on prosperous Troy. Paris is forced to flee for his life by the duplicitous King. His escape is aided by Helen, the two having experienced instant mutual attraction on first meeting (Paris being unware of who she really is). As Paris is bidding a cliff-top farewell to Helen they are discovered by Spartan soldiers hunting him.  Helen is clearly implicated so Paris leaps to freedom with her in his arms. They flee to Troy on a friendly vessel waiting off the shore of Sparta. This triggers the Trojan War as Menelaus now has the perfect excuse.
Jacques Sernas plays Paris and the, then, little known Rossana Podesta plays Helen and both are physically fine in their roles. Although not native speakers both spoke their parts in English. Sernas did speak English but Rosssana Podesta did not and learned her lines by rote. However, it was decided to dub the voice of Jacques Sernas. His accented English did not fit well with the strong classical voices of the British supporting players. This has the effect of making him sound rather wooden and unemotional, but does not detract from the overall enjoyment of the movie. Like all movies of this type it loses something when seen away from the large screen but, for all that, it is an exciting story well told and visually impressive, especially the battle scenes.
Classical Greek scholars will notice the liberties that Hollywood took with the original tale by the blind Greek poet Homer. In this version Paris is portrayed as a strong, resolute and heroic figure and Helen as the unfortunate, unhappy, wife of the brutish King Menelaus.  The movie commences with the original musical overture and the soundtrack has been remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1. The bonus material consists of three interesting ""the making of"" documentaries shown by Warner Bros. on the TV show they had at the time. In addition there is the original theatrical trailer. I first saw this movie in 1956 and liked it then and I still like it now. I have adjusted my star rating of this movie to reflect this.",1084838400,11,2556,4.767494356659142

As I boy I sent a letter to Warner Bros. in Hollywood for a picture of Rosanna Podesta along with a lot of stamps for sending the picture back. I didn,t receive the picture then, but 7 years later I received a picture of Rosanna along with inscription in Italian "" to my little boy"".

777713,4,6304071787,"This is my favorite movie version of the story of Helen of Troy. It's more melodramatic and theatrical than the recent cable TV miniseries, but it is faster paced and has a grandeur and fascination with Greek mythology lacking in that version. At least Cassandra is Kassandra in this film - she's endowed with the gift of prophecy, yet no one believes her until it's too late. Then again, many other mythological details are sacrificed for simplicity's sake.
In the role of Helen, Rossana Podesta is radiantly beautiful. She indeed has the face that could launch a thousand ships. And the Paris of Jacques Sernas is nearly as beautiful as his beloved. Their passion is believable, if a tad overblown. The rest of cast is good too, especially the Priam of Sir Cedric Hardwick, Achilles of Stanley Baker and Odysseus of Torin Thatcher. Although the Trojan War occured during Mycenaean times, most of the set designs and costumes appear to use Classical Greece as the model, and to very good effect, for it gives the movie a nobility lacking in the more recent version.
