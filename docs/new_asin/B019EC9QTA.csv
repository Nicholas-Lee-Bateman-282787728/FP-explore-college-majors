8744887,3,B019EC9QTA,"The two movies in this double feature were filmed in Africa. Code 7, Victim 5 (also known as Victim 5) was filmed in South Africa while Mozambique was filmed, guess where?.....there is also a scene filmed at Victoria Falls which is on the border of Zimbabwe and Zambia.

Both movies are on a single disc and come with a trailer. Both are in color and the quality of the blu-ray is decent but nothing extraordinary. Neither movie is anything special and if not for the value of two movies I would rate this DVD 2 stars. Code 7, Victim 5 has considerably more action than Mozambique despite what the trailers may show. Both movies begin with a murder and then an investigation ensues.

The first movie, Code 7, Victim 5 is about an American private detective who is asked to come to South Africa to investigate the murder of a close associate of a copper mining magnate. The star Lex Barker, was doing movies in Europe, mostly Germany at this time of his life. Previously he had been best known in America for starring in 5 Tarzan films. Lex Barker plays 'Steve Martin' (this name must have been popular, Raymond Burr had the same name in 'Godzilla'. His investigation centers around a photograph of 4 friends with one of them 'x'd out. One of them is person who hired Martin. He bounces around South Africa with the help of a police chief who only seems to care about girls. The movie culminates with an utterly ridiculous scene at a cable car. The villain, who is runs away in a car, decides to stop and trap himself on a cable car and after killing many people, Martin chases him and gets him to stop shooting by just asking nicely. It only gets worse from there.

The second movie, Mozambique is also a murder mystery, though at times it just plods along and can at times be boring. It takes awhile to get going after the opening murder scene. The movie is about a pilot staying in Portugal who has lost his job due to an accident in which he was the only survivor. He is enticed by a local police chief to take a job in Mozambique as a private pilot after a murdered person is found with an envelope that has money and an offer for the private pilot job. On the plane there he meets a girl there who is also going to Mozambique for a job in a lounge. From here the story is disjointed and it seems they production team wasn't sure if they wanted to make a movie about smuggling or a murder mystery or an action film. Ultimately the film concludes at Victoria Falls, but they don't actually use the location. They use a bridge a little ways away for the climax.

I struggled with giving this a 3 star rating as I feel that is being generous. I had never heard of either of these movies before purchasing this DVD and I can see why. They are both forgettable movies. The acting is decent in both but the stories are below average with nothing we haven't seen before in many movies that came before them. I doubt I will watch either of them again.

Although these movies are not good by any stretch of the imagination, Blue Underground should be applauded for making them available in blu-ray. I usually buy these types of movies even if I don't think I'll like them just to give a tiny bit of support to the companies that make them available. After all if nobody buys them then what incentive is there for anybody to give you high quality old movies that don't have a large following. And you are getting 'two' movies for the price of one so it's at least a decent value.

Recommended only for people who grew up watching these movies and for people that want to support smaller companies who bring us obscure older movies on blu-ray.",1459900800,15,3636,4.387240356083086
