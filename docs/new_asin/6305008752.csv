7880361,4,6305008752,"KINO's sixth edition of SLAPSTICK ENCYCLOPEDIA showcases HAL ROACH shorts.

PROGRAM--

""Laurel & Hardy's Laughtoons"" consists of highlights from four comedies:
ANGORA LOVE (1929) - Stan feeds a goat a piece of doughnut and it follows the boys home.
YOU'RE DARN TOOTIN' (1928) - Features a shin kickin', belly punchin', pants rippin' street riot.
LIBERTY (1929) - Accidentally wearing each other's trousers, Stan & Ollie seek privacy to exchange them and end up on a skyscraper-under-construction's exposed ""I"" beam.
THE BATTLE OF THE CENTURY (1927) - Contains the funniest block-long pie fight ever seen!

GET OUT AND GET UNDER--  Harold Lloyd's drive to a theater he's supposed to appear at is foiled by Tin Lizzie mechanical trouble and two motorcycle cops.

DOGS OF WAR!--  Stars Hal Roach's Rascals. The entrenched kids battle it out in a vegetable patch using ""live"" tomatoes, a wooden tank and a skunk ""gas"" attack. They visit a movie studio in search of work, but instead disrupt a shoot, eat lunch, make a movie with a borrowed camera and get chased onto the set of Harold Lloyd's in-production feature, ""Why Worry?""

BIG MOMENTS FROM LITTLE PICTURES--  Excerpt features Will Rogers doing rope tricks and spoofing a Keystone Kops chase scene. Generally clear nitrate print shows some damage in spots.

FLUTTERING HEARTS--  Charley Chase helps a girl buy ""2 for 86"" sheets at a riotous department store sale, then assists her father in retrieving a compromising letter from blackmailing Big Bill (a deeply-tanned Oliver Hardy).

ORANGES AND LEMONS--  Stan Laurel's antics at a citrus grove and packing house may be the first film where Stan wears a derby.

IT'S A GIFT--  Aussie-born 'Snub' Pollard is the inventor of many odd devices. His gasoline-substitute pill undergoes testing at an oil company, but the formula is as powerful as rocket fuel and much more explosive.
