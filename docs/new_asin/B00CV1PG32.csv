5742170,5,B00CV1PG32,"All hands in this film take it seriously, which means they're fully committed to the hokey material and that's what makes it hilariously fun - sort of a Fifties update of a Maria Montez - Jon Hall movie.  Deborah Paget essays a double role, Jeffrey Hunter is a dashingly handsome love interest, Michael Rennie has to say and do ridiculous things, there are lots of ham actors, a bevy of handmaidens who all look like Christine Jorgenson and have deadpan lines, and even a Borscht Belt-type comedian - and they're all on cardboard sets in lurid color and full Arabian glory.  Lots more fun than ""The Egyptian,"" though not in CinemaScope nor with such a big budget.  By the way, it starts disappointingly with a notice that the print ""has been altered to fit your screen,"" but it appears to be a full-frame print anyway ... no panning and scanning or any other indication that we are missing something. The picture is crisp and the colors are dazzlingly bright.",1372550400,35,959,4.662721893491124
5742171,4,B00CV1PG32,"Although Princess of the Nile is really a three star movie I gave it four because of the gorgeous Technicolor transfer. After several inferior transfers of other films from Fox Cinema Archives they finally came up with one that is so beautiful it must have been remastered at some point. The movie itself was filmed by the Fox ""B"" movie unit, Panoramic Pictures, on left over sets from The Robe (not Demetrius and The Egyptian as stated by another reviewer). It is closer in spirit to the Maria Montez/Jon Hall Arabian Nights movies than a historical epic, but it is an entertaining 71 minutes and Debra Paget and Jeffrey Hunter are as handsome a couple as ever graced a movie screen.",1370649600,39,684,4.661157024793388
5742172,4,B00CV1PG32,"In 13th century Egypt, a royal princess (Debra Paget) secretly escapes from the palace each night and disguises herself as a dancer at a tavern. By this method, she can relay information to her people about the evil Shaman (Edgar Barrier), who keeps her father drugged and her a prisoner of the palace in order to rule the kingdom. When the son (Jeffrey Hunter) of the Caliph of Baghdad arrives, she hopes to persuade him to help rid her country of the Shaman. For a low budget programmer, the film has a vivid palette and first rate production values. Most likely because reputedly it was filmed on left over sets of bigger budgeted films like DEMETRIUS AND THE GLADIATORS and THE EGYPTIAN and cinematographer Lloyd Ahern (MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET) makes the most of it. Paget, the ""go to"" girl whenever Fox needed an exotic type like Polynesian, Egyptian or Indian, gets a couple of dance numbers though none as sexual as her snake dance in Lang's INDIAN TOMB. The blue eyed Jeffrey Hunter is as out place here as an Arab as he was as Jesus in KING OF KINGS. But as a mindless Saturday afternoon movie matinee, it's an enjoyable adventure. Directed by Harmon Jones. With Michael Rennie, Lee Van Cleef, Michael Ansara, Jack Elam, Dona Drake and Merry Anders.

The Fox MOD is a very good open matte transfer (this was not a CinemaScope film) with bright and striking colors.",1370390400,51,1372,4.6460905349794235
5742173,3,B00CV1PG32,"This ""Epic"" is so bad that it is hysterical. They spend half the movie in the water and no one has wet hair. Even the hand maidens are priceless, with names like Zoe, Azalea & Cleo. And poor Debra Paget doing her hootchy kootchy dances as Princess Shalimar. No wonder Debra was never Oscar material. It is so entertainingly bad that it is hilarious. But it is a clear clean Technicolor print. One star for the movie, but 3 stars for unintentional comedy entertainment.",1369958400,6,468,4.583333333333333

5742180,5,B00CV1PG32,I love watching these old films about Egypt and especially with Debra Paget.  I will enjoy watching it over and over again although the storyline is a little weak.  It was still a good story.,1400630400,,191,4.428571428571429
5742181,3,B00CV1PG32,The plot isn't anything special and the acting in general is somewhat amateurish but the overall impact is entertaining.  Lots of swimming and dancing (Debra Paget does a marvelous job as a terpsichorian).  Watch for a very young Jack Elam in a supporting role and even younger Lee Van Cleef with a very small part.,1397865600,2,315,4.709090909090909
5742182,5,B00CV1PG32,"When I first saw Princess of The Nile, I didn't want to go to see it.  I was ten years old and had gotten to the stage where I thought girls might not be that bad, except for my sister who was terrible and for Lizzie Haas who had a way of getting me mad.  But it was Saturday and the Saturday matinee was part of our regular schedule.  That was the first time I saw Debra Paget, I didn't know exactly why I liked her except that I thought she was gorgeous and really sexy, though I had no idea what that meant, and then she danced wearing beads and chains and nothing else and I really got excited.  I wasn't quite sure why I was excited but I was.  There was a lot of sword fighting and killing and there was a hero, Jeffrey Hunter and a Villain in Michael Rennie, and Lee Van Cleef was one of the good bad guys from the city.  Seeing the movie today brings back fond memories of an innocent time.  And besides Debra, there was fiery eyed Donna Drake, who I always thought was sexy, and I had a pretty good Idea why, when it came to her.  Even Bob Hope liked her, no, that was The Road To Morocco. lol",1395705600,13,1102,3.977272727272727
5742183,4,B00CV1PG32,"I must admit I'm biased, I enjoy watching Debra Paget and have a weakness for Arabian Nights style movies. Princess of the Nile is colorful and enjoyable escapism suitable for all the family. Jeffrey Hunter is a bit wooden, in my opinion. But that's about the only fault I can find with the film apart from some historical blunders. However, as the film is a fantasy these can easily be overlooked.",1391817600,,398,4.619718309859155

Debra Paget was never more vibrant, and maybe, never so lovely, as in 1954's ""Princess of the Nile"". Her wicked harem dancing is the basis for her leading role. In 1249, an Egyptian princess, Shalimar, is trying to rid her kingdom of a Bedouin chief, and his army. She joins with handsome Prince Haidi, the Caliph's son, and devotes herself to court intrigue, while also playing the role of a dancing girl in the bazaar. The Princess uses a secret underwater stream to navigate back-and-forth from her palace to the market place, where she pretends to be Taura, the dancing gypsy. You could call the story a little soggy. But ""Princess of the Nile"" is worth it, just to see Debra Paget sword-fighting in a skimpy Harem outfit. Filmed on the 20th Century back-lot, ""Princess"" sports a good cast, including Jeffrey Hunter, Michael Rennie, Michael Ansara, and an early role for Jack Elam. Star Jeffrey Hunter would grow frustrated with Hollywood in the next few years, and his career declined. In a freak accident, he suffered a brain hemorrhage after falling down a flight of stairs. Tragedy ended his life too soon. In ""Princess of the Nile"", watch for a small part(and uncredited) for Lee Van Cleef.",1386806400,14,1202,4.778846153846154
5742188,5,B00CV1PG32,DEBRA PAGET IS a GREAT ACTRESS & She Proves It in THIS MOVIE ! A JOY to Watch OVER & OVER Again !!!  as well as other movies she has made !,1384905600,6,139,3.34375
5742189,3,B00CV1PG32,"Here was another Jeffery Hunter suprise, but Debra Paget stole the show. She is gorgeous in this movie.
Fun popcorn flix.",1381449600,,121,4.809523809523809
5742190,2,B00CV1PG32,The first thing you see when you start the movie is a message that says the movie is not in the original format and has been modified to fit (fill) the tv screen.  IMDB says that the aspect ration ratio is 1.66:1 and the box says 1.33:1.  That indicates cropping. 5 stars for the hot dancing by the lovely Paget but terrible transfer by 20th Century Fox.,1380931200,8,354,4.268656716417911
5742191,4,B00CV1PG32,Debra Paget is always excellent playing theses types of roles.  Beautiful scenery and enjoyable storyline.  I recommend the movie highly.,1380758400,,137,5.8
5742192,5,B00CV1PG32,Perhaps not the greatest script...but the chemistry between Hunter and Paget more than makes up for it. I love this film....fun story and great actors. I got the impression that they really enjoyed making this. Fantastic performances from Ansara and Rennie as well. Just an all around fun movie.,1377043200,3,295,5.040816326530612
5742193,3,B00CV1PG32,"It is just a middle east adventure, but what make it good is not only the beauty of Debra Paget

8586687,3,B00CV1PG32,"A little stiff. Jeffrey Hunter doesn't ""swashbuckle"" as well as Errol Flynn. Though any movie with the lucious Debra Paget does go up a notch!",1508457600,,142,4.72
8586688,4,B00CV1PG32,This is a class B movie.  What I like is Debra's scenes - WOW!!!  What a babe.  Who cares about the story?  Everything else is great.,1507248000,,133,4.0

8586692,5,B00CV1PG32,"Fun, pretty, early 50's B-grade Arabian Nights type adventure.  In the 13th-century Egypt a princess disguises herself as a dancing girl to help her people fight off an evil shaman who has become the power behind the throne, and occupying Bedouin forces.  She is helped in her cause by a Persian prince visiting as an emissary of his father, the Caliph of Bagdad, her servant girls, and local thieves.  The sets are good and the color is intense and gorgeous.  The best thing about the film is Debra Paget and Jeffrey Hunter, two of the most physically beautiful actors ever to grace the screen.  Paget's exotic dancing (I wouldn't call it belly-dancing, it's better) is a highlight.  So are her costumes.  The DVD-R release is excellent.  Not to be taken seriously but highly recommended.",1429488000,4,789,4.835820895522388

8586694,4,B00CV1PG32,Great classic movie.  Descent acting and the overall movie is a good adventure.  They don't know how to produce decent movies anymore.  This is the difference between generations of literacy or the lack of.  Keep in mind that this movie was produced long before hi-tech electronics and camera's were available.,1426032000,5,310,5.14
