8659454,4,B00KIZY0EE,"William Powell is my favorite actor, so I will watch most anything of his.  This is an early film and the fashions and autos of 1930 are very interesting.  The acting is topnotch all the way down the cast list.  The scenes tend to go on longer and a bit slower than modern films and there isn't a constant musical soundtrack.  I rather like both these difference from later movies.
The ""hero"" is has a lot of flaws, which is a nice acting challenge for Powell. There's very little humor in this film which is all about ethical and moral dilemmas of the main characters.  It is not a the totally engaging sort of film THE THIN MAN is but is worth watching on the many levels I have indicated.  I've put it in my library and will no doubt watch it again.",1484438400,,752,4.223776223776224
8659455,5,B00KIZY0EE,I love William Powell movies and I enjoyed this movie very much,1442275200,,63,4.333333333333333
8659456,5,B00KIZY0EE,"William Powell was a very versatile actor who could act to perfection.  His genre included comedy, drama and mystery.  This movie was made in 1930 during the period when he was portraying the criminal detective ""Philo Vance"".  I don't want to go into detail about this film but it is a unusual courtroom drama involving his wife and another man.  If you are a fan of William Powell then I know you will enjoy watching this movie and owning for your film library.  You find the cost is also very reasonable for your pocket book.",1427673600,,527,4.505263157894737
8659457,3,B00KIZY0EE,Not as great as I expected for Powell and Francis to be in one movie to be together. Maybe it was the story.,1424649600,,108,3.739130434782609
8659458,4,B00KIZY0EE,"With his urbane flow and mellifluous diction, William Powell took to fast-talking lawyer roles like a duck took to water or American insurance companies. Paramount's 1930 courtroom melodrama, For the Defense, holds up well today and is relevant in several fashions. It's third of six onscreen collaborations between Powell and Kay Francis. It presents Francis for the first time as a true leading lady. As well, it showcases Powell in one of his early leads, a swerve from his having played heels and reprobates in the 1920s. And, released during the early sound era, this motion picture is a pioneer of sorts in evolving the mechanics of filmmaking.

Powell plays shady New York defense attorney William Foster whose sensational courtroom arguments for his often slimy clientele have won him the deep and abiding ire of the police and the D.A. Foster is a silver-tongued charmer, and while his tactics are often suspect, he's yet to actually skirt the judicial system. That may change when his long-time love, Broadway star Irene Manners (Francis), kills a man in an auto accident, except that the passenger in the car with her gallantly assumes the blame for her manslaughter. For Foster, it's a thorny moral conundrum as he ends up defending the man with whom he comes to suspect his gal had been stepping out.

This being a pre-Code presentation, expect some salacious stuff in the form of sexual innuendos and front page scandal and massive consumption of alcohol and even a speakeasy or two. Of course I anticipated courtroom tomfoolery as only William Powell can pull off with verve and wit, and, sure enough, cue the highlight scene in which Powell argues his case as he flirts with a phial of nitroglycerin.

He and Kay Francis work really well together, their strong chemistry lending substance to the lurid plotting. Folks forget that they were the It couple before Powell paired up with Myrna Loy. Not only does Francis look mighty fine in her stylish wardrobe, she sinks her teeth into a meaty role, that of a woman in love but who's made poor choices. Powell, meanwhile, is in his element as the untrusting, empty-eyed bon vivant who revels in his swagger and in his notoriety and in thumbing his nose at the opposition. I guess only someone with Powell's gentlemanly appeal can make his character so rootable, especially when he teeters on the brink of ruin. He's so good in this one, I guess he thought why not take on a similar part two years later in Lawyer Man (1932).

This being an early talkie film, expect some sound issues. But expect also for director John Cromwell to tweak accepted filmmaking habits. He refused to be hamstrung by the limitations imposed by the early talkie era. In an age wherein actors were won't to stay statically in-studio and on mark and emote into a hidden microphone, Cromwell interjected documentary-like exterior shots of New York City to establish authenticity. He also applied rear-screen projection of urban locales to make it seem as if characters were conversing outside. As a director, Cromwell is to be commended for the self-assuredness and economy of his storytelling. This sucker runs around 62 minutes and manages to cram in  a  wealth of titillation and noirish sensibilities and courtroom heroics and deep-scarred emotional arcs.

For the Defense is loosely based on infamous, real-life defense attorney William Fallon, a.k.a. ""The Great Mouthpiece,"" he who in the span of a nine-year-career in Manhattan tried over 120 homicide cases and won 'em all and probably kept who knows how many wise guys out of stir. Fallon also inspired The Mouthpiece (1932) starring Warren William.",1421712000,4,3645,4.955810147299509
8659459,4,B00KIZY0EE,"For the Defense is an early entry in the highly successful run of William Powell-Kay Francis pairings. As is the case in so many films of this vintage, the story is tight, the dialogue snappy, and the direction keeps things moving apace. Powell was always good at portraying good guy/bad guy lawyers, and here he's terrific. Kay Francis is appealing, but her streetwise accent and slang is a bit at odds with her clotheshorse wardrobe.",1420675200,3,435,4.8133333333333335
8659460,5,B00KIZY0EE,"Very good film,unusual to see Powell in this kind of a role but it really held my interest.",1419724800,,91,4.111111111111111
8659461,5,B00KIZY0EE,"Once more Universal resurrects a long-forgotten gem (aren't they all?) from the lengthy career of William Powell, before the ""Thin Man"" series or later still ""Life With Father."" The story is amazing in its surprising force on completion in less than 80 minutes. For a courtroom drama it is most unusual. In this drama, Powell plays an un-beatable, cocky attorney, William Foster (much like F. Lee Bailey). Even I was surprised by the finish, when something higher than legal principle decides the issue. Foster's enemies want him to slip up somehow and topple from his high circle. A moment arrives when his soon-ex-girlfriend tires of his bachelor ways and presses but loses his commitment to marry. While celebrating her new main squeeze driving past midnight Irene Manners (Kay Francis) accidentally kills a man and flees the scene directed by her new flame. Irene convinces Foster to take the case but omits details which Foster in time discovers. At first, Foster does what he must to get a hung jury for Irene's boyfriend. The D.A. knows more than Foster does, which brings him up for charges. Only then does Foster know the truth: that Irene was the driver of the vehicle on that night. Does William Foster do what he said he would do, never speak to Irene again, or does he find another way to uphold the law and the truth for a higher reason? I submit to you all that you must watch this riveting courtroom drama long enough to witness the law upheld (and lawyering) judiciously impervious to the pull of the heart strings with a stunning finish. A hanky warning to all ye.",1411689600,3,1582,4.7355072463768115
8659462,5,B00KIZY0EE,"As with all William Powell movies very entertaining, with an unexpected ending. I had no idea how he would resolve the problem.",1411344000,,127,4.818181818181818
8659463,5,B00KIZY0EE,"I've always loved this early Wm. Powell, in fact, it rates as one of his best as far as I'm concerned--delighted to find it on DVD at long last.",1403827200,3,144,4.0
