8758642,5,B01EGQFYMW,"Brilliant archival film footage of British children who were evacuated to countries all over the world during World War II when England was under attack from Germany. Touching first-hand accounts of parents who sent their children away to safety, as well as those children's perspectives of living abroad, and being separated from their homes and loved ones.

Extremely touching program steeped in the emotional turmoil of families who were facing turbulent times, and of their shared experiences of hardship and separation. Highly recommend this program. A real eye-opener, and a real tear-jerker!",1465171200,,598,5.5
