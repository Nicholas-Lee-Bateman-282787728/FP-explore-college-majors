5978516,4,B00FDZ7W1W,"People have become brainwashed to believe that only Disney can produce great animated stories. Most of the time, a great deal of the original story elements are changed to make the story 'work' as a Disney film. The Disney formulas are used again and again, with little variation. People forget that there are other animation studios quite capable of telling a good version of a beloved tale, too. Such is the case here. This 20 film collection of family tales is very enjoyable, largely because the tales are closer to the original books, as was the case with Peter Pan and Alice in Wonderland. Now those have always been two of my favorite Disney films, but truth told, the Disney versions are a long way off the path of the original books upon which they are based. Here, the original stories shine. Plus, in this set, every character isn't breaking into ridiculous songs every 5 minutes, an annoyance that Disney is known for. Is the animation or level of artistic breadth and color palette as broad as Disney? No. Are the tales feature movie length, no again, here they are 40-50 minutes long, and in the case of the tales done exceptionally well, the short length is this set's only major downfall. Are there duds? Oh for sure I glanced at The Jungle Book and found it an unwatchable wreck. But, considering you are getting 20 tales, mostly done decently, and more closely mirroring the books, this set could easily sit on your dvd shelf next to the high and mighty Disney versions...provided you aren't so pompous as to believe that only Disney deserves to be played in your house or car. 4.25 stars for value, variety, and tales that follow original stories better than Disney.",1452556800,10,1685,4.695945945945946

8614626,1,B00FDZ7W1W,"Very poor picture quality and I guess its my fault I assumed the stories were short movies but they're just as long as the actual movies, so Id much rather just watch those than these with such ooor picture quality",1517875200,,214,4.375
8614627,5,B00FDZ7W1W,My kids love them. They like getting to see a different twist on all their favorite characters from Disney. Plus some new characters. One of the movies is messed up and has no sound for about 3 minutes. For the price it's a great buy!!,1517788800,,235,4.2444444444444445

8614633,5,B00FDZ7W1W,"Not the Disney cartoons but I like the seller who made immediate refund as I was going to return it. I bought the DVD for a sick boy - my client. He is a special boy, he likes only VERY good, VERY professional animations-cartoons, with nice music, like Frozen. Only this type of cartoons keep his attentive, here is characters are talking a lot, and not so beautiful. Maybe for regular kids it will be OK....",1485907200,,408,4.381578947368421
