2961458,4,B000W4U8FG,This volume was obviously done later than the rest of the series - and it has a more conceptual approach than the other two volumes.  For some infants this may not be as entertaining to watch.,1207526400,,192,4.333333333333333
2961459,5,B000W4U8FG,"My daughter (18 months now!) loves this series.  She laughs and claps whenever I put it on.
We started showing her the series at about 7 months but she didn't get interested until about 13 months.  I was shocked at how quickly she began making signs at that point.
Her verbal skills are expanding rapidly at this point but her pronunciation is still horrible - like most toddlers, only mommy and daddy can understand what she says.  Signing lets her get her point across much more easily so she feels far less frustrated.
This third volume has the basic color signs in it and has been very helpful in teaching my daughter the concept of colors as well as the verbal words and signs.",1203120000,5,682,4.483870967741935
2961460,3,B000W4U8FG,"I purchased this DVD for my 18 month old daughter. She likes it and has learned several of the signs. What I don't like about the video is the woman in it is bland and robotic. My daughter enjoys it, but not as good as others I've bought.",1200787200,,238,3.9791666666666665
2961461,5,B000W4U8FG,"ok the third dvd is harder than any of the two since most of it requires to use both hands.  and some of them even have two motions (i.e. bee).

my daughter is almost 17 months old.  she has not mastering the use of her finger yet but she still tried her best to follow the instruction =p

included in the DVD these signs:
Frog, pig, water, rain, snow, slide, swing, bug, bee, banana, juice, white, black, yellow, purple, red, sand, orange, blue, turtle, grass, cookies, cloud, and on addition in the tutorial section such as: happy, sad, angry, excited, surprised, scared, hurt, and questioning color.

Great DVD!  I am hoping they will produce the next series.",1200614400,15,662,4.615384615384615
2961462,5,B000W4U8FG,"My 18 month old watched the Early signs video starting at 6 months and has already learned to connect the signs with words, but I was still amazed that after watching this video once, she said and signed balloon when she saw another kid with one.  She has learned many of the signs on this video after only a 8 or so viewings!  She sits and watches completely enchanted just as she does with the other two videos as well.  She even loves watching the credits!  There is a little girl ( the same one as in first signs but older) signing a poem.  I can't wait until they come out with another.  The video includes signs for swing and slide and various signs for things you might see outdoors including animals and weather signs, the colors, pig, banana Juice and cookie.",1197676800,,768,4.373239436619718
2961463,5,B000W4U8FG,"I got the first two My Baby Can Talk when my grandson was about 6 months old.  He loved them.  He would sit in his highchair and watch them over and over.  He is now 22 months old with a 6 month old sister.  I got the third dvd for him and he loves it as well.  He can sign over 100 words, and although he does not talk very good right now, he signs and says the word at the same time.  His sister is very much interested in them as well.  She sits and watches and studies them just like he did.  Would not take anything for them.  They have really helped him and his parents and me with understanding what he has to say.",1195603200,,621,3.826771653543307
2961464,5,B000W4U8FG,"My 20 month old son asks to watch this DVD every day.  He loves the images, the colors and the music.  There is a wonderful mix of all types of words included from animals to food to actions to colors. Each time my son watches it he finds something different to be interested in. The most recent time it was banana, but slide, swing and juice have been popular as well. Aside from his obvious excitement, I knew he liked the video because when it ended he looked at me and said ""again"". This from a child who won't watch more than five minutes of ANYTHING else.

One of the great things about this series is that you can watch as little or as much at a time as your child seems interested in. Each word/sign is an individual chapter and the whole thing is easily searched. Some days we watch the whole thing; other days we pick a few chapters and then move onto something else.  The variety of images set to beautiful music keeps it interesting for me too. Definitely a plus for me, because we watch this series frequently.

Even though my son has quite a large spoken vocabulary (something I attribute to watching the other videos in this series!), he still enjoys learning the signs to go along with his words. I think it does a great job of reinforcing stuff he has already learned. If you have a baby or toddler you need this video!",1192665600,,1336,4.328
2961465,5,B000W4U8FG,"I am writing to tell you how much my daughter, Campbell, loves your third DVD in the My Baby Can Talk series. We have been watching the movie almost daily because she loves the DVD and she likes to sign the word ""slide"" and watch the toy animals work themselves up the ladder and down the slide.  She signs ""slide"" and says the word. She is working hard at trying to learn all the signs and doing a great job of trying to master the signs. Some with her own little twist!  She is really enjoying the movie and I can't be happier!

I can't tell you how wonderful it is to see her so excited when she remembers a sign or uses a sign while reading a book or going for a walk to let me know what she is seeing and what she would like to do. Campbell is going to turn two years old soon and it's been wonderful teaching her sign language. It has made communications with her so much easier and stronger. Since she is using more language skills and trying to talk; when she is trying to find the words to express herself, I remind her to use her signs and then she isn't so frustrated!! And neither are we!! She is also a budding little artist, so the learning the color signs, such as red, yellow or blue,  has been a wonderful addition into our art time together! Thank you so much for creating such an educational and wonderful product. I keep recommending your DVDs and website to people where ever we go , and I highly recommend its use to new moms and dads(and so do Campbell's Grandparents!). Thank you again and I look forward to more wonderful products from you in the future!

2961466,5,B000W4U8FG,"I continue to be amazed at how quickly and easily my children learn from the My Baby Can Talk videos!  I started signing with my son who had a speech delay, and it really helped ease both of our frustrations.  Then my daughter came along and started watching the videos as a baby. She not only picked up the signs right away, but was saying the words along too. Now her spoken vocabulary is at twice her age.  This video, Exploring Signs, has taken their signing up a level with the addition of color adjectives; they are now putting 2 and 3 signs together!  The videos are a tremendous language and vocabulary resource for all children. The format is fun, engaging and it really works! I have seen the results, and I highly recommend signing with the My Baby Can Talk series!",1192492800,3,776,4.443661971830986
2961467,5,B000W4U8FG,"I have been using the My Baby Can Talk products with my son since he was 9 months old, and now at 22 months, Haven has an extensive sign (75 + words) AND verbal vocabulary! He even introduced himself to another child at the park last week, much to my own amazment! I give so much credit to My Baby Can Talk, for the effective and entertaining approach each DVD takes to Baby Signing!! I truly think this early approach at communication has done nothing but good things for our family!

We were invited to a join in a pre-release viewing of the newest MY BABY CAN TALK DVD, and couldn't be happier with what we saw! Since Haven is speaking so well already I was concerned that he wouldn't have as much interest in the newest DVD ""Exploring Signs"" but I couldn't wait to put it to the test...and boy did it ever prove me wrong!! Haven was so engaged! He was saying the words with the DVD and attempting most all the new signs! He loved the DVD so much he asked to watch it again as soon as it was over...and has repeatedly ask to watch it daily since the first time he viewed it! He calls it his ""Cloud"" movie, as that is his favorite sign! :) The signs were very practical for the every day world of a Toddler! Everything was very recognizable to him, and this kept his interest peeked. The rhyme rhythms the newest ""Exploring Signs"" uses are such a treat to both toddler AND mom! They are easy to remember and use even in day to day conversations with my child.

Not only is the baby/toddler portion of the dvd a hit, but I found the parent tutorial extremely helpful and full of even more signs and approaches to try myself! From beginning to end this DVD exceeds all expectations! It's a MUST have for anyone beginning to sign or already experienced in signing with their baby!",1191283200,6,1779,4.307462686567164
2961468,3,B000W4U8FG,It's ok. Taking Care of a toddler and working really didn't give me much time to learn this with him.,1443571200,,101,4.1
2961469,3,B000W4U8FG,I bought this thinking it was an introductory video but exploring signs literally means signs about exploring outside. My daughter liked watching the kids but many of the toys they use in the video are creepy and old.,1441670400,,217,4.7368421052631575

2961473,5,B000W4U8FG,"Love love love, very simple and explains their signs well.
First off, you cannot just plop your kid down and expect them to learn. My 1 year old can sign 10 different words, but I also work with her all the time with them.
At almost two she can now somewhat learn by herself but I have to Use it so she can see how effective it is to sign! Highly recommend",1438128000,,356,3.9583333333333335

2961477,1,B000W4U8FG,"TOO SLOW!!!! The target audience of this DVD is the BABIES!!! So you get your baby to watch the DVD and he learns signs that way. Hello!! We're talking 6 months old babies, here!!! How about teaching the PARENTS to sign and letting THEM teach their baby?!? here, each sign takes about 5 minutes because they have to show numerous little vignettes of the object -it's excruciating!!! Next, there is no rhyme or reason to the order of the signs. Wouldn't it make sense to teach the most useful and important words first?!? Like eat, drink, sleep, hurt, please, etc? But no, the first signs are Frog, cloud, bug, white, yellow... I'm ordering some books instead - that way I can go at my own pace (which is way, WAY faster than this DVD!!!!)",1429488000,14,738,4.514925373134329

2961487,5,B000W4U8FG,"I purchased this for my son and started learning baby signs since he was 10 month.
Now he is 19 months knows so many signs. Sometimes we play this DVD in a car and he learned new signs faster than I do.
It is great to teach them signs because that will help you understand their needs better.
Also, kids can express what they see with signs, which helps them with learning. My son sees a flower and he does the sign for flower. (leaf, fish, slide, swing, water etc...) It is truly amazing to see how he learns fast. We speak 3 languages at home plus signs. We believe that teaching him signs helped us communicate with him so much.",1423267200,,631,4.223140495867769

He loves the music and noises that go with the pictures and signing.
They show the word and what the word is, then they have a lady that signs the word and then they show the word being used.

Started putting on these DVD's for her when she was about 6 months, at least 3 times a week and from the beginning it captivated all of her attention. Now she's 20 months old and knows absolutely all the words from all three DVD's. I recommend these because they not only show signs of the words but the actual word and alot of pictures, videos and actual people in it.

My older daughter has even learned a few words and uses them with her sister, which I think is great! I bought this when it was under $5, and I think I got a terrific deal.

2961505,4,B000W4U8FG,"As far as signing DVD's go, this one is a steal. The production is done in an aesthetically pleasing way: wonderful classical music accompanies beautiful images of toys, objects, and nature to illustrate the signs. The program is pleasant to watch, and the music won't grate on parental nerves.

As one reviewer noted, the woman demonstrating the sign does seem a bit stiff; however, this is a plus for beginning users of sign language as her demonstrations are easy to follow. She shows each sign slowly and carefully, which helped me learn them quickly.

What I liked less is that there seems to be more time spent on showing toys and other images rather than on kids using the signs (""Signing Time"" is much better in that regard). For example, for ""frog,"" there is gorgeous footage of all kinds of pretty frogs (real and toy), but few instances of actual signing. Also, the kids featured in this production often don't use the signs correctly, or they perform them in a way that isn't easy to make out, so it may be difficult for your toddler to imitate the correct movements just by watching this program.

I'd say if you want to use this DVD, place yourself next to the tv screen so your toddler can see you. Then keep repeating the sign demonstrated by the woman as well as the word that is being introduced while the images are shown. That way, your toddler might catch on faster.

Overall, I would recommend it, especially at the price.",1396224000,,1444,4.607003891050583

He isn't yet 1 1/2 but he can sign the following words: please, more, milk, thank you, dog, cat, Mom, Dad, drink, bear, car, and probably some I just can't remember now. There are many many more which he hasn't mastered  yet or just doesn't use (such as zoo animals).  He will sit and watch it and then want to watch it over again and again. The music and the toys used to illustrate are very baby friendly.",1389225600,,520,4.275510204081633

My son is not hearing impaired, but I just wanted to get him started on communicating. He would smile when he heard the intro music and liked to watch me sign with the video. He would also dance to some of the music. He would grab for the remote whenever he wants to tell me he wants to watch this (this is the only video we let him watch). They use classical music and show real images as well as toys for the words (for example, ""cat"" they show pictures and videos of real cats and also toys shaped like cats. They also create some animation for some of the words too or use puppets to show an interaction (like ""share"" or ""help""). My son is one now and has signed ""more"" ""all done"" ""milk"" ""eat"" and understands a lot of what I sign to him.

2961520,5,B000W4U8FG,"I can't say enough good things about these movies.  My son has been watching the first two My Baby Can Talk DVDs since he was 5 months old and still watches them--this is a new addition we got to add to his vocabulary. He was 15 months when I got it and I think it's the perfect age for this particular DVD. Some of the signs are little more difficult and require more finger coordination.  The movie was slow enough for him to learn, but definitely not boring. I'm also a fan of the classical background music. My son really hasn't watched any other signing movies except for a Little Einstein that had some signing in it, so I can't really compare how this one stacks up to the rest. However, I will say through watching these DVDs, he has been signing since 11 months and is now 17 months. As he is now learning to talk, he often says words while signing them at the same time, and because ""toddler talk"" can be difficult to understand sometimes, it has really helped me to get an idea of what he's trying to say. It reduces a lot of his frustration and allows me to both praise him and assist him in pronouncing his words correctly.  I'm sure there would be many a time I would have no idea what he was trying to say otherwise- especially if there is nothing to point to. All-in-all I highly recommend this movie as well as the first two. My husband is very impressed and thinks I'm some sort of super mom for teaching him sign language, but really he and I are just learning together.  It has really been a great experience and I wish I would have done this with my other three children.",1323475200,2,1592,4.26158940397351

My son has Apraxia and this DVD was a blessing in disguise. As soon as we popped it in, he began learning the signs. It's a kid friendly DVD and even easy enough for us parents to learn some new signs. Once my son got the sign down and we all used it, he dropped the sign and worked on the word. I believe releasing the pressure of talking through the signs has helped my son not only want to talk, but learn more signs.

I have yet to meet a baby who did not love looking at these videos, and when you are trying to teach sign language using videos you have to have something they love.  The use of many different children as well as an adult performing the signs is helpful and there is the perfect amount of repetition.  I used these videos with both of my children to teach them signing from 6 months on and they worked wonderfully.  I have also recommended this to a friend whose child had delayed speech and her son first communicated with the signs learned from this video-a true blessing for their family!  Wonderful DVD!!!!",1293235200,,680,4.495934959349594

He has a speech delay so these videos were instumental in his communication with us.  We have the whole series.  he is 2.5 now and still loves them, we plan on using them with his younger sister who is now 8 months.  I do think these videos are great for introducing signing but once they have mastered the basics the signing time series is the way to go.  My son loves those videos too and now has about 100 signs.  Those are great because they incorporate music with fun songs to learn signs.",1291248000,,694,4.251908396946565

I only let her watch it once a week, not 4 times like they suggest. As an educator I know that zero screen time under age 2 is what to aim for. Instead, we watched, then lived the signs.

This is a fantastic tool and I could not imagine raising my daughter and not being able to communicate like we can with the signs she has learned.

When I first watched ""First Signs"" I thought give me a break, this is so lame.  But it shows what I know, my daughter loved it, it was like baby crack. At 9-10 months she would watch 25-35 minutes straight before she would loose attention.  To contrast we tried some of the Baby Einstein sign videos when she was around a year old. They are more glitzy and have the TV Actress Marlee Matlin signing. But my daughter didn't appreciate any of that production value, she barely paid any attention to them at all.

Not only was it great entertainment if I needed 20 minutes of quiet time, she truly did communicate through signs very clearly until she could talk.  AND, I am convinced that her vocabulary is 100x that of any other kid her age because she already knew all the words from the signs.  She started watching the videos at about 10 months and began signing right before her first birthday.  By the time she was 18 months, she was saying all the words from these three videos, knew all her colors and was picking up language like nobody's business.

[The second one has some animation that makes my son nervous.]  He started signing before turning 1-year and we still incorporate signs in our language even though he has a very full vocabulary and often uses 5-word sentences.  I attribute sign language to helping him with verbal language (my understanding is it stimulates the same part of the brain) and reducing his and my frustration as he learned to talk.  It may have even reduced melt downs and tantrums -although I have no real evidence of this.  Mostly, its fun to do.  The DVD includes a tutorial for parents.

We have another sign video (Talking Hands) that the person signing is the one speaking the words so my toddler can see also how to say the words. We started watching this video when he was 1 year old and I noticed immediate progress with his signing AND talking and I attribute it to him being able to see them say the words too.

To me this video is more like a baby einstein video where it just runs through lots of pictures and sounds but I don't see that this is a valuable signing video.  I would probably not reccomend this.",1209945600,33,703,4.2

We started showing her the series at about 7 months but she didn't get interested until about 13 months.  I was shocked at how quickly she began making signs at that point.
Her verbal skills are expanding rapidly at this point but her pronunciation is still horrible - like most toddlers, only mommy and daddy can understand what she says.  Signing lets her get her point across much more easily so she feels far less frustrated.
This third volume has the basic color signs in it and has been very helpful in teaching my daughter the concept of colors as well as the verbal words and signs.",1203120000,5,682,4.483870967741935

There is a wonderful mix of all types of words included from animals to food to actions to colors. Each time my son watches it he finds something different to be interested in. The most recent time it was banana, but slide, swing and juice have been popular as well. Aside from his obvious excitement, I knew he liked the video because when it ended he looked at me and said ""again"". This from a child who won't watch more than five minutes of ANYTHING else.

One of the great things about this series is that you can watch as little or as much at a time as your child seems interested in. Each word/sign is an individual chapter and the whole thing is easily searched. Some days we watch the whole thing; other days we pick a few chapters and then move onto something else.  The variety of images set to beautiful music keeps it interesting for me too. Definitely a plus for me, because we watch this series frequently.

Even though my son has quite a large spoken vocabulary (something I attribute to watching the other videos in this series!), he still enjoys learning the signs to go along with his words. I think it does a great job of reinforcing stuff he has already learned. If you have a baby or toddler you need this video!",1192665600,,1336,4.328

We have been watching the movie almost daily because she loves the DVD and she likes to sign the word ""slide"" and watch the toy animals work themselves up the ladder and down the slide.  She signs ""slide"" and says the word. She is working hard at trying to learn all the signs and doing a great job of trying to master the signs. Some with her own little twist!  She is really enjoying the movie and I can't be happier!

I can't tell you how wonderful it is to see her so excited when she remembers a sign or uses a sign while reading a book or going for a walk to let me know what she is seeing and what she would like to do. Campbell is going to turn two years old soon and it's been wonderful teaching her sign language. It has made communications with her so much easier and stronger. Since she is using more language skills and trying to talk; when she is trying to find the words to express herself, I remind her to use her signs and then she isn't so frustrated!! And neither are we!! She is also a budding little artist, so the learning the color signs, such as red, yellow or blue,  has been a wonderful addition into our art time together! Thank you so much for creating such an educational and wonderful product. I keep recommending your DVDs and website to people where ever we go , and I highly recommend its use to new moms and dads(and so do Campbell's Grandparents!).

She not only picked up the signs right away, but was saying the words along too. Now her spoken vocabulary is at twice her age.  This video, Exploring Signs, has taken their signing up a level with the addition of color adjectives; they are now putting 2 and 3 signs together!

I give so much credit to My Baby Can Talk, for the effective and entertaining approach each DVD takes to Baby Signing!! I truly think this early approach at communication has done nothing but good things for our family!

We were invited to a join in a pre-release viewing of the newest MY BABY CAN TALK DVD, and couldn't be happier with what we saw! Since Haven is speaking so well already I was concerned that he wouldn't have as much interest in the newest DVD ""Exploring Signs"" but I couldn't wait to put it to the test...and boy did it ever prove me wrong!! Haven was so engaged! He was saying the words with the DVD and attempting most all the new signs! He loved the DVD so much he asked to watch it again as soon as it was over...and has repeatedly ask to watch it daily since the first time he viewed it! He calls it his ""Cloud"" movie, as that is his favorite sign! :) The signs were very practical for the every day world of a Toddler! Everything was very recognizable to him, and this kept his interest peeked. The rhyme rhythms the newest ""Exploring Signs"" uses are such a treat to both toddler AND mom! They are easy to remember and use even in day to day conversations with my child.

Not only is the baby/toddler portion of the dvd a hit, but I found the parent tutorial extremely helpful and full of even more signs and approaches to try myself!

Now he is 19 months knows so many signs. Sometimes we play this DVD in a car and he learned new signs faster than I do.
It is great to teach them signs because that will help you understand their needs better.
Also, kids can express what they see with signs, which helps them with learning. My son sees a flower and he does the sign for flower. (leaf, fish, slide, swing, water etc...) It is truly amazing to see how he learns fast. We speak 3 languages at home plus signs. We believe that teaching him signs helped us communicate with him so much.",1423267200,,631,4.223140495867769

He loves the music and noises that go with the pictures and signing.
They show the word and what the word is, then they have a lady that signs the word and then they show the word being used.

Now she's 20 months old and knows absolutely all the words from all three DVD's.

My older daughter has even learned a few words and uses them with her sister, which I think is great! I bought this when it was under $5, and I think I got a terrific deal.

3196002,4,B000W4U8FG,"As far as signing DVD's go, this one is a steal. The production is done in an aesthetically pleasing way: wonderful classical music accompanies beautiful images of toys, objects, and nature to illustrate the signs. The program is pleasant to watch, and the music won't grate on parental nerves.

As one reviewer noted, the woman demonstrating the sign does seem a bit stiff; however, this is a plus for beginning users of sign language as her demonstrations are easy to follow. She shows each sign slowly and carefully, which helped me learn them quickly.

What I liked less is that there seems to be more time spent on showing toys and other images rather than on kids using the signs (""Signing Time"" is much better in that regard). For example, for ""frog,"" there is gorgeous footage of all kinds of pretty frogs (real and toy), but few instances of actual signing. Also, the kids featured in this production often don't use the signs correctly, or they perform them in a way that isn't easy to make out, so it may be difficult for your toddler to imitate the correct movements just by watching this program.

I'd say if you want to use this DVD, place yourself next to the tv screen so your toddler can see you. Then keep repeating the sign demonstrated by the woman as well as the word that is being introduced while the images are shown. That way, your toddler might catch on faster.

Overall, I would recommend it, especially at the price.",1396224000,,1444,4.607003891050583

He isn't yet 1 1/2 but he can sign the following words: please, more, milk, thank you, dog, cat, Mom, Dad, drink, bear, car, and probably some I just can't remember now. There are many many more which he hasn't mastered  yet or just doesn't use (such as zoo animals).  He will sit and watch it and then want to watch it over again and again. The music and the toys used to illustrate are very baby friendly.",1389225600,,520,4.275510204081633

My son is not hearing impaired, but I just wanted to get him started on communicating. He would smile when he heard the intro music and liked to watch me sign with the video. He would also dance to some of the music. He would grab for the remote whenever he wants to tell me he wants to watch this (this is the only video we let him watch). They use classical music and show real images as well as toys for the words (for example, ""cat"" they show pictures and videos of real cats and also toys shaped like cats. They also create some animation for some of the words too or use puppets to show an interaction (like ""share"" or ""help""). My son is one now and has signed ""more"" ""all done"" ""milk"" ""eat"" and understands a lot of what I sign to him. I would recommend this all three in this series.",1357516800,,930,4.081967213114754

3196017,5,B000W4U8FG,"I can't say enough good things about these movies.  My son has been watching the first two My Baby Can Talk DVDs since he was 5 months old and still watches them--this is a new addition we got to add to his vocabulary. He was 15 months when I got it and I think it's the perfect age for this particular DVD. Some of the signs are little more difficult and require more finger coordination.  The movie was slow enough for him to learn, but definitely not boring. I'm also a fan of the classical background music. My son really hasn't watched any other signing movies except for a Little Einstein that had some signing in it, so I can't really compare how this one stacks up to the rest. However, I will say through watching these DVDs, he has been signing since 11 months and is now 17 months. As he is now learning to talk, he often says words while signing them at the same time, and because ""toddler talk"" can be difficult to understand sometimes, it has really helped me to get an idea of what he's trying to say. It reduces a lot of his frustration and allows me to both praise him and assist him in pronouncing his words correctly.  I'm sure there would be many a time I would have no idea what he was trying to say otherwise- especially if there is nothing to point to. All-in-all I highly recommend this movie as well as the first two. My husband is very impressed and thinks I'm some sort of super mom for teaching him sign language, but really he and I are just learning together.  It has really been a great experience and I wish I would have done this with my other three children.",1323475200,2,1592,4.26158940397351

It's a kid friendly DVD and even easy enough for us parents to learn some new signs. Once my son got the sign down and we all used it, he dropped the sign and worked on the word. I believe releasing the pressure of talking through the signs has helped my son not only want to talk, but learn more signs.

I have yet to meet a baby who did not love looking at these videos, and when you are trying to teach sign language using videos you have to have something they love.  The use of many different children as well as an adult performing the signs is helpful and there is the perfect amount of repetition.  I used these videos with both of my children to teach them signing from 6 months on and they worked wonderfully.  I have also recommended this to a friend whose child had delayed speech and her son first communicated with the signs learned from this video-a true blessing for their family!

He has a speech delay so these videos were instumental in his communication with us.  We have the whole series.  he is 2.5 now and still loves them, we plan on using them with his younger sister who is now 8 months.  I do think these videos are great for introducing signing but once they have mastered the basics the signing time series is the way to go.  My son loves those videos too and now has about 100 signs.

When I first watched ""First Signs"" I thought give me a break, this is so lame.  But it shows what I know, my daughter loved it, it was like baby crack. At 9-10 months she would watch 25-35 minutes straight before she would loose attention.  To contrast we tried some of the Baby Einstein sign videos when she was around a year old. They are more glitzy and have the TV Actress Marlee Matlin signing. But my daughter didn't appreciate any of that production value, she barely paid any attention to them at all.

She started watching the videos at about 10 months and began signing right before her first birthday.

Not only has the videos helped her learn to sign basic needs and wants, but her exposure has assisted her in learning how to clearly annunciate and pronounce words and has helped increase her vocabulary at an early age.  I recommend all three videos for your child's learning library!",1210118400,,551,4.829787234042553
3196044,2,B000W4U8FG,"I read all the reviews before buying and couldn't tell if we would like it. What I was really disappointed about is that the person doing the signs is not saying the words. We have another sign video (Talking Hands) that the person signing is the one speaking the words so my toddler can see also how to say the words. We started watching this video when he was 1 year old and I noticed immediate progress with his signing AND talking and I attribute it to him being able to see them say the words too.

To me this video is more like a baby einstein video where it just runs through lots of pictures and sounds but I don't see that this is a valuable signing video.  I would probably not reccomend this.",1209945600,33,703,4.2

8221273,1,B000W4U8FG,"I bought this video for my two-year-old son who is in speech therapy because he doesnt say a whole lot of words. His speech therapist suggested signing with him. In my opinion this DVD isn't very helpful.  I was looking for something that was more related to communication. Such as words like more, eat, sleep, etc. This DVD  doesnt have any of the basic communication signing at all. Its a few animals, colors, and just random  things like rain, snow, etc.  The DVD isn't very long either. I may send it back to get another one that I saw on Amazon. In my honest opinion I wouldnt recommend purchasing this DVD. I think it would be more helpful if the DVD actually had the child signing the words which they do but its very brief.",1515628800,,731,4.392592592592592
8221274,5,B000W4U8FG,We have bought this dvd twice! My son watched this as a small toddler almost daily and when it finally got scratched up I had it memorized. Then my daughter came along we had to buy another copy because the kids enjoyed it so much! The music and simplicity keeps them watching! 1-3 yo are the best audience but my 4 yo still enjoys it from time to time!,1511222400,,353,4.130434782608695

8221278,3,B000W4U8FG,"All in all, it is an educational DVD and I think it does a good job of teaching the signs it does teach.  However, for $20, I expected it to include more than 25 or so signs.  I'm glad I didn't buy the other dvds.  They're just too expensive for what you get.",1487203200,,259,3.849056603773585
