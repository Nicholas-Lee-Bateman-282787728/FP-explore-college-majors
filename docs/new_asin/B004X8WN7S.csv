8446469,5,B004X8WN7S,A must have for any fan of the series!  Phenomenal video quality and great audio quality.  Packaging is top notch!,1498176000,,114,4.65
8446470,5,B004X8WN7S,"I watched this years ago and always wanted to own it. I finally pulled the trigger and purchased my own copy for my collection as foreign DVDs can be quite pricey. I bought this when it was $50 and the 4-part single disc prelude Rurouni Kenshin Tsuioku Hen for $90. I've watched the other disc many times already but not this one yet. I think it is because I've seen it before and I know how it ends. Kenshin's (and Kaoru's) life and story is so sad at times, I don't want to cry myself to sleep at night:)

But having seen it before, I can attest to the beautiful and smooth animation. If you love the series or characters and you want to find out what happens in the end, you will love this and will want a copy for your collection. Just be ready to experience a wide range of emotions.",1494374400,,788,4.150326797385621
