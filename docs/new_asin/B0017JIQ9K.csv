8266231,3,B0017JIQ9K,I am not sure.. i mean i like the way she teaches in it! but it is hardly anything..... like its a little hard to get a good grip on it unless u have a really good idea of music! It is difficult to just begin straight with this without any prior background in music! so.... liked it n yet maybe dint!,1251676800,2,300,3.8548387096774195

8266233,5,B0017JIQ9K,"I have taught many of the Worlds finest Violinists, of whom personally knows Mrs. Seidel, and for that reason I decided to learn about Mrs. Seidel's DVD lessons and book. I am extremely impressed with the skill and talent Mrs. Seidel demonstrates through her impeccable teaching style and talent. I now require all of my beginning violin students to study all of Mrs. Seidel's DVD lessons and book, so that they will already know Music Theory, Rhythm, and how to play the violin prior to their first private lesson at Juilliard.
Thank you, Mrs. Seidel, for creating a wonderful system for student to learn the Violin!",1236729600,5,617,4.830188679245283
