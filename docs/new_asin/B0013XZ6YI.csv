The story line and plot, Buster Crabbe plays Billy The Kid, as in William Bonney, rather than Billy Carson ---  Fuzzy St. John is on hand to lend in the fun --- The character Jeff Walker (Bud McTaggart) really doesn't do much more than support Billy and Fuzzy, but he adds to the fun. There are no automobiles or radios in this one, either. It's a real western --- The oater starts off with the trio in jail, accused of murder, when someone mysteriously breaks them out. We find out later that there are three imposters posing as Billy The Kid and his gang. They dress just like Billy, Fuzzy, and Jeff. When Fuzzy gets shot at by his ""pals"" and then ""himself"" the three so-called outlaws figure out why they have been accused of so many crimes. Sheriff Masters (Ted Adams) recognizes this after Billy saves his life and tells them the bad guys are in Mesa City. As they investigate Mesa City they run into Stanton, the local crime boss running the town --- Stanton is played by Glenn Strange. I've seen Strange play a sheriff in one movie, but he was almost always a henchman --- The details and the props in every scene are full of western imagery --- The action never slows down and the movie has a great western feel to it.

  Buster Crabbe ...  Billy the Kid
 Al St. John ...  Fuzzy Jones
 Malcolm 'Bud' McTaggart ...  Jeff Walker (as Bud McTaggert)
