5009159,5,B006OEPS0S,Beautifully shot! Great island locations. Dalas Davis as the cop was remarkably good in a small but pivotal roll. What can I say about James Brolin? The Best!,1332374400,2,158,4.678571428571429
5009160,1,B006OEPS0S,"Yeah, a lot of us watch the bad movies because they are fun. It's a real shame MST 3000 rapped up before they had a chance to skewer this celluloid tomato.
I could only stomach 15 minutes in the middle of this stinker so admittedly I can only speak to what I saw, but hey, 15 minutes was enough to compel me to write this review.
The basic premise is about a location shoot on an island in the ""spooky"" Bermuda triangle region. Apparently some mysterious force makes women go bad here, wreaking mayhem on and off the movie set.
The film jumps around a lot, really bad editing, no reason.
The script must have been penned by someone who knew someone who knew someone and was owed a big favor so that they also could direct. The dialog is ridiculous. The events improbable, the reactions subdued and phony.
There is some dude who gets caught having sex with the lead bad girl, SImone, but his girlfriend is the forgiving type ushering him naked back to their room, while some guy is watching thru the window.
Another chick freaks out when her boyfriend is kissing another girl in a movie scene. ( doesn't she know its acting, why is she even on the set?)
Some dude gets stabbed for real when the prop knife malfunctions- however he doesn't let out a peep and the girl thats stabbing him doesn't feel the resistance of the blade going in? Thats one pretty sharp prop knife! Of course two seconds after the killing there just happens to be a cop, with evidence-bag in hand, who takes the knife away. No one is freaked out, no one cares, no one checks on the dead body, no one questions the girl who stabbed him or the prop-master, movie resumes shooting the next day!
There's a cafeteria scene where we see a woman behave as if she is sneaking food to a little girl sitting behind her however the girl already had a full plate of food on her lap and  is out in the open for all to see, so what's with the covert operation?
Our veteran lead is none other than James Brolin, who went from daytime soapdom to losing his mind in Amityville Horror to end up as the token goy for uber-alpha-diva Babs Streisand. They sort of showcase in this stinker as the Burt Reynolds'  director in Boogie Nights.
I'd recommend this for cheap laughs, but in good conscious, I cannot.",1332115200,8,2259,4.389021479713604
8501841,5,B006OEPS0S,"The plot was both creative and imaginative.  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the title.  Ok, so this is a terrific movie with a bad title.  And that is really all I can say that is negative about it.  This is one of those movies that you start watching, not expecting much since it is not that well-known, but as the plot unfolds, you find yourself drawn to the story.  Antonio Sabato Jr. carries the lead here.  James Brolin, Annalynne McCord, and Joanna Bacalso play supporting roles.  All were great here.  I cannot criticize the acting in any way.

The story takes place in Eleuthera, an island in the Bahamas.  While out for his morning swim, film producer Michael Pace finds a woman floating in the water.  He carries the unconscious woman home and calls the authorities.  The police arrive and question the woman.  She seems to have lost her memory.  An attraction develops between the middle-aged Michael and the young woman.  As the day unfold, he takes her on a date, on a boat that is owned by a wealthy friend.  Suddenly, Michael wakes up and realizes that the recent events were just parts of a dream.  Or maybe not.  Later that same day, he learns that the boat in his dream was found at sea.  All her crew are gone.  Blood was found on her decks.  Foul play is suspected.  The boat owner, Harry, is Michael's friend.

Inspired by his vivid dream, he calls screenwriter Terry Bamba to write the script.  Slowly the script gets written and Michael hires the same Terry Bamba to direct the film.  During the casting call, a young actress from Savannah comes in to audition.  Other than her strong southern accent, the girl is a dead ringer for the one in Michael's dream.  Bamba agrees to hire the girl, to play the part of the female lead, in the movie. They hire a famous rock star, Seamus, to play Michael's part in the movie.

The production begins and the shooting thereafter.  Terry takes enormous liberties at the helm and proceeds to rewrite many of his original scenes.  Bamba incorporates a lot of creative new ideas into the picture.  Impressed with Terry's creative genius, Michael gives him more room to operate.  Everything goes well, until an accident happens on the set.  At that point, Michael realizes that something strange was happening.  He remembered an earlier conversation with a policeman, about a string of 30 strange events, spanning forty years.  All involved a beautiful young woman.  Was it the same woman, over a span of forty years?  Was voodoo involved, somehow?

In any case, there is a mystery here.  You will need to pay attention to the clues very carefully and note the dialogue.  It is doubtful that you will be able to puzzle out the mystery.  At least, not until near the end.

Antonio Sabato Jr. is a very good actor.  It surprises me that he has not had a lot of leading roles in his career.  James Brolin plays the flamboyant director, Terry Bamba.  The beautiful Annalynne McCord plays Simone, an aspiring actress from Savannah.  And the lovely Filipina actress, Joanna Bacalso, plays Michael's wife, Sherry Pace.

Highly recommended.",1424736000,,3102,4.690875232774674
8501842,3,B006OEPS0S,"OK, its bad in parts. But sooo much fun if you skip through kind of fast. It has some compelling scenes near the end. And Anna Lynn is cute!",1416096000,,140,3.8620689655172415
8501843,1,B006OEPS0S,"Last night I watched a real mess of a movie that Netflix recommended for some reason, BAD GIRL ISLAND.  A magic dolphin pushes a half naked Annalynne McCord ashore on the Bahamian island of Eleuthera, which in some way you can drive to from Savannah Georgia.  She has amnesia and no undies (a fact they repeatedly mention despite the equally repeated evidence that she does, and, no, there are no naughty bits shown at any time except for unwelcome male buttocks) so despite Antonio Sabato Jr. having a *way* hotter wife (and daughter) and the housekeeper knowing the girl is there and saying she's a bad voodoo spirit, he feeds ""Morning"" as he names her chocolate cake and a *lot* of booze and nookie ensues.  The next day he takes her to a party on a yacht but his wife shows up so Morning goes up to fool around with the yacht's owner, and suddenly it was all a dream, and Antonio is back in his own bed and his wife never went out of town.  Then he gets a call that his friend's yacht has been found, bloody but deserted, with signs in English saying CRIMES AGAINST THE SEA on it, and a crazed local tries to force a picture of his family on him with one of them scratched out.  Antonio decides he doesn't like dolphins any more, and his wife and daughter can't figure out why he's acting weird just because his BFF's yacht was found bloody and adrift, so Antonio decides to do what any of us would in this situation, and self finance a movie about the whole experience (which so far hasn't amounted to much).  The local cop tells him that people have been vanishing like this almost every year for the last forty years starting in 1946 (and, yes, the movie takes place in the 21st Century) and that they all hate Haitians because the island only has 300,000 people on it (in reality it has 8000, which would have made a better point) and if they don't keep kicking the Haitians back into the ocean they'll be overrun (this comes totally out of nowhere).  He hires ""Jim"" Brolin to produce and direct, and of course McCord shows up to audition, late because of the traffic driving down from Savannah, and gets the part, and they start filming the movie.  McCord gets her costar's girlfriend to murder him during filming 'cause she's so damn stupid she can't tell a real knife and a real stabbing, and then McCord kills ""Jim"" herself, photographed by an underwater camera that exists for no reason.  Then the dreaded found footage shows up, and it seems that exactly 1 year and two days ago, Sabato's son and daughter and ""Jim"" were on the yacht and a bunch of Haitian refugees tried to board it, so they murdered them all, with the hot teenage daughter tossing a baby into the ocean.  Said baby was saved by dolphins and exactly one year and two days later is played by an actress who's like eight.  Antonio decides that McCord is killing everybody that was on the boat exactly one year and two days ago, and races to save his son that McCord is in he middle of drowning, and does so by drowning her instead, but is seen, and they drag the water for the body, and find not McCord, but the cute daughter.  The local cop, who knows damn well that McCord is a voodoo spirit, arrests Antonio for murdering his own daughter, despite the fact that the son can say who he was with, the witness saw a blonde and not a brunette, and the daughter was safely in the custody of the movie producer until long after all this occurred - he only let her out of his sight after Sabato told him McCord was dead.  Then the cop finds out the real McCord vanished from Savannah 6 months ago, and thinks this will convince the judge to let Sabato out of prison, so he drives out to spy on the two year old baby played by an eight year old actress, and evil spirit McCord pops up and screams GO and he runs away and ... put up titles as the movie becomes a PSA for not killing Haitians.  I have NO idea why McCord came after Sabato in the first place, since he didn't even know about the massacre, or why tossing Haitians in the water amounts to CRIMES AGAINST THE SEA, or why the magic dolphins didn't just rescue everybody, or why they killed the Haitians, or why they keep talking about 'sirens' in plural (including in the original title of the film) when there is at best just the one, or how DEATH RACE 2000's Simone Griffith ended up as acting coach with a cameo as, uh, an acting coach.  So we've got dreams and a movie within a movie and flashbacks and the dreaded found footage all rolled up into one unsatisfying ball of seaweed.",1412380800,2,4520,4.351543942992874
8501844,1,B006OEPS0S,"Bad Girl Island (Stewart Raffill, 2010)

Stewart Raffill, relatively early in his career, directed one of my favorite movies, High Risk. In it, James Brolin plays a wannabe mercenary who leads a small group into the compound of a reclusive South American drug lord (Anthony Quinn) to liberate him of some of his ill-gotten funds. High Risk, released in 1981, was Stewart Raffill's last good movie. Since then, he has turned in a combination of bizarre family films (e.g. the infamous 1988 feature Mac and Me) and erotic thrillers (Survival Island). An odd combination to be sure, but we're going to dispense with the family-film aspect of Raffill's career and focus on Raffill's first feature with Brolin in almost thirty years. It could not be any more different from High Risk if it tried.

Plot: Michael (bad-movie mainstay Antonio Sabato Jr.) is a screenwriter who's living on an island in the Bermuda triangle (no, really) trying to break his writer's block and come up with a new script. One night, he has a dream about a woman he rescues from the waves and names Morning (Excision's AnnaLynne McCord), since she can't remember her own name. (Hey, go with it, it's a dream.) Nasty things occur. He wakes up and whoa, there's his new screenplay. He gets on the horn with director Terry Bamba (Brolin) and the two of them start auditioning for the lead actress... and Georgia peach Simone (McCord) shows up to audition. Was Michael's dream only a dream? And if not, what does Morning want from Michael?

I have seen a lot of bad movies over the years. I voluntarily sat through such legendary bombs as The Room and Birdemic: Shock and Terror. Neither made my list of the hundred worst movies of all-time. Manos: The Hands of Fate did; it sits at #57 (Manos is infamous for having been a denizen of IMDB's Bottom 10 since its inception; it fell to #11 a couple of weeks ago as I write this, nudged out by 2014's Gunday). What I'm getting at is that I tend to troll the depths, finding horrific little nuggets of celluloid feces like Cathy's Curse (#61), Slayer (#92), I Like Killing Flies (#38), Hallow's End (#49), and Mutants (#80), all of which have less than a thousand votes on IMDB. I know crappy, and I know it all too well. So when I tell you that Bad Girl Island is only the second film since I began the list almost ten years ago (May 20, 2004) to occupy the #1 slot... well, you get the idea. AnnaLynne McCord is so terrible in this movie I don't understand how she still has a career. I'd say the same for Antonio Sabato Jr., but I think I say that every time I see him in a movie. The script is beyond words (and, for much of its length, beyond reasoning). While I did not find it such, I can easily see where some folks could find it at least insensitive, if not outright offensive, for reasons I can't discuss without going into spoiler territory. I might have found it offensive if I thought the movie had enough brain cells to have at any point been malicious. It does not. In fact, that might have saved it from the slot it now occupies on my hundred-worst list; at least that would have inspired some sort of emotion. Instead, this is boring, lackluster, predictable, Lifetime Original Movie-level work from a director who past performances show is capable of much, much better than this. (As I write this, High Risk is at #371 on my list of the thousand best movies of all-time.) And yes, I rush to add that if this mess had not been directed by Stewart Raffill, it may have hit the list, but would probably be in the bottom half somewhere. But it is exemplary in providing an example of how far the mighty can falland for that, it claims the throne. (zero)",1399852800,,3680,4.505988023952096
8501845,5,B006OEPS0S,"AnnaLynne McCord was so believable in her seductive mystery. The production was filmed with amazing clarity and very high definition landscape scenes throughout. . AnnaLynn McCord, who actually plays an """"ugly girl"""" in ""Excisism,"" was enough to carry this movie to 5 stars. This isn't a soft core flick either.  It wasn't just her skin and her body and all. It was the energy of her, encapsulated in the movie. She put magic into this movie. But then again, some guys have lost a craving for visual and magnetic realities.
