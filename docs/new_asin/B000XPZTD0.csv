8229103,1,B000XPZTD0,"This documentary does not compare or compete in today's documentary market.  I agree with the prior reviewer that the footage looks old.  It is strictly a combination of video footage, with a monotone narrator who is painful to listen to --accompanied by a score of annoying elevator type piano and guitar music.  There is absolutely no diversity in this film to make it interesting.  No interviews on location of locals, historical figures and nothing to intrigue the viewer.  Israel is the most extraordinary country on the face of the earth.  There are countless worthy films about this nation.  Avoid this one at all costs.",1269993600,2,627,4.971153846153846
8229104,4,B000XPZTD0,"An interesting travel dvd with a date that is only a couple of years old...however, much of the actual footage appears substantially older which is the primary reaason this received a four star rating.

The video is informative and does a nice job explaining the major areas of Israel as well as potential areas of interest from a Jewish, Christian and Muslim perspective. The Christian aspect seemed to be a bit longer than the others but in all likelihood it seems due to the fact there are a LOT of churches, memorials for every place a saint or other christian persona reportedly walked, talked or stopped  along the way. In any event, the video also shows the variation of the land itself and dispels many misconceptions especially in regard to modern day ""communes"".

One thing I did not especially like, in addition to the use of seemingly dated footage here and there, was the reference to terrorism, violence and wars. While Israel has certainly had its share of violence and terrorism, large numbers of people visit annually without incident and in fact, the majority of visitors never encounter the type of tragic events that make the news.

A few areas the video did not cover were health related issues...odd for a travel video to leave out although I suspect it is due to the relative safety of traveling throughout Israel. Still, water, illness, what vaccinations or lack thereof, eating from street vendors and all other medical information was completely lacking from the video....an imperative consideration for any traveler. Likewise, there was no mention of Visa for extended stay or if you can travel with only a Passport and for how long of a duration.

All in all a nice general introduction travel video perfect for general information, learning the geography, selecting some of the more popular destinations etc but don't expect the nitty gritty details from this one.",1240272000,5,1893,4.940251572327044
