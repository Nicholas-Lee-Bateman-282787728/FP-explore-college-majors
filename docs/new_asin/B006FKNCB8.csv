4984957,5,B006FKNCB8,Loved this show when I was younger and still do even with my own children. I would recommend this show for entertainment as there is little educational value but a lot of laughs.,1394755200,,178,4.424242424242424
4984958,5,B006FKNCB8,"Such a cute and funny show.  The graphics of course aren't the best because the show is older  but it doesn't bother my children.  The only thing I don't like is that there are times where the characters use name calling, such as stupid or weakling or jerk, etc, and I don't like my kids learning that kind of talk or behavior. On the other hand, they will hear it elsewhere as they are exposed to this crazy world, so we still watch it.  But I let them know that is not how we should talk to each other!  Howie Mendel is a good writer and this show displays his creativity.",1394064000,2,574,4.135135135135135
