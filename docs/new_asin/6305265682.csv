1004114,4,6305265682,"Maybe it is because I read so many bad reviews for this movie before I rented it, or maybe it's because I am engaged to a Polish woman, but I really enjoyed this film.  Contrary to what the critics said about this  movie, I thought it was a well made film.  Claire Danes was fantastic, as  were the other actors.  The only thing that bothered me was the ending.  That was just a little too much of Hollywood's emphasis on dramatic  endings.  I'm not sure I could agree with the claims that this movie is  ""hilariously funny"" (Variety), but if you're in a good mood, you should  chuckle on occasion and feel good after watching it.  From my vantage point  (an American observer of Polish tradition), I felt the movie did a good job  depicting Polish ways and mannerisms.  Of course, my fiance begs to  differ.  Sometimes, however, it's difficult to recognise yourself on the  big screen.  At least that is what I would say to my sweet Polish princess.",929836800,6,950,4.488235294117647

1004225,3,6305265682,"""Polish Wedding"" takes place in an ethnic neighborhood in Detroit. Its characters are working class people who would probably like a better life for themselves and their children but who have no clue as to how this can come about. In it, we see the younger generation making the same mistakes as the older generation, lacking any vision for a better life, having babies out of wedlock and then getting married because it's the honorable thing to do, and not getting an education as a result.

Now, a story based on this theme could be told in a compelling way, but ""Polish Wedding"" does not do this. The dialogue is trite. The characters are stereotypes. And the storyline is thin. It's advertised as being ""hilariously funny."" I would say that it's worth a few grins at most. Moreover, there's nothing distinctively Polish about it. The same story could have been set in any ethnic neighborhood without much change, other than to perhaps replace the Polish food at the wedding reception. In giving the movie three stars I believe I am being very generous. and have done so mostly because the movie does convey a positive message of sorts. It's just that it could have been done so much better and in a far more compelling way.",1381104000,,1227,4.680555555555555

1004284,3,6305265682,"I was amazed to run across this DVD in my local book shop.  I had never heard of it before.  A movie with Claire Danes that got no press?  What was that all about?

I am 2nd generation Polish American.  I did not find a lot to identify with in this movie.  I wasn't offended exactly, but I can see why people would be.  The characters are very broadly drawn with liberal use of stereotypes.  I felt like the movie was trying to make a point but not focused in what the point was.  I guess it is about the importance of family, regardless of culture.  My cold, cold heart was a tiny bit warmed by the scenes of Hala with her father.  Claire Danes and Gabriel Byrne are accomplished actors both.  Really, all of the acting is fine, but the storyline and the characters are problematic.

The soundtrack is truly annoying, this tinkly fake-ethnic music.

If you are making an ethnic movie, food will probably figure prominently.  I enjoyed references to pierogi and czarnina (duck blood soup, a truly vile concoction).  The pickles - my grandma's kitchen always smelled like dill.

The ending didn't work for me.  It usually doesn't work if you slap up a screen that says ""One Year Later"" and tack on a scene that ties up all the ends in a neat little package.  I would have rather watched an extra 10 or 15 minutes to see how everyone got to that point over the next year, but whatever.  It's kind of an interesting movie.  I can't compare it to anything else I've seen, so that makes it unique, I guess.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is easily offended - I can guarantee you will find something offensive if you tend to look for that sort of thing.  It's the epitome of a 3-star movie for me.",1365033600,,1699,4.340764331210191

Rolling around on it with her lover right in front of the urinals. Absolutely sickening. The parents marriage is broken. The daughter is a promiscuous drop out.

1004289,5,6305265682,"I loved this movie and I would watch it again and again.

 I loved the passionate portrayals of the all too human characters, the mischievious quality, the humor and the pathos.  I agree it was worth watching just for Gabriel Byrnes' performance, which was wonderful, but I also loved Clare Danes and Ms. Olin as well.  They did a beautiful job.  It wasn't simply a portrayal of polish americans, and no, I don't believe they all eat only kielbasa, pierogies, pickles and are impeccably clean (though most I have known are), it was a human story about relationships between husbands and wives, daughters and fathers, between lovers, between siblings, betwen neighbors qnd other members of a community. As a Catholic I could relate to the church-centered life, but I really loved the spunkiness of the pregnant ""vestal vergin"" telling the priest and the rest of the community to ""stick that in your pipes and smoke it"" and strutting away with her head held high, with her mother right behind her.  More than anything, the movie was character driven, and it could have been any ethnic group or religion.  It is really about the not always politiclaly correct individuals, (high school drop outs, working class people, etc.)  struggling for personal integrity against outside prejudice and their own shortcomings, to find some semblance of meaning and truth. I found it funny, sad, and totally engaging and I am so glad Ms. Connelly  made this wonderful movie and shared it with us.",1292112000,2,1479,4.907630522088353

To cite just one example, the scene where the parishioners all kneel down in homage to ""Hala"", while an hysterically bug-eyed young priest is violently trying to remove her from the ceremony is perplexing to the point of being downright bizarre (and I do mean bizarre), and betrays a total lack of knowledge and understanding of Polish or Catholic or Marian devotional practices.

And then, to be able to look at the fabulous Lena Olin!!  I, too, am from an ""ethnic"" family, and, thus, look at portrayals of ethnic people with a particularly sensitive eye.  In that light, I must say that I did not find anything so terribly or intentionally offensive in the portrayal of characters or nationalities here.  As an adult, hopefully one realizes that there is a great deal of variety within each ethnic group.  There is a lot of universal stuff here, too, as it relates to family and humanity.  In fact, if the subject here had been Italians, this film might have been directed by Giuseppe Tornatore [""Cinema Paradiso,"" ""Malena""].  I agree with other reviewers who recommended that some viewers need to take a chill pill and see the humanity and universality here.  VERY MUCH WORTH A LOOK. Ciao!",1115164800,21,967,4.5
1004383,4,6305265682,"I first saw this movie while flipping around channels on HBO and while at first, it did not catch my attention for reasons I shall yet to understand. Once I really did start to get into the film however, I was totally drawn into it. I understand that many reviewers here were absolutely mortified upon finishing the movie (if any of them actually gave it that long of a chance) but, honestly knowing nothing of Polish culture, did not take anything ""racial"" from the movie; rather, I just saw a funny, and genuinely honest story that wanted to be told.

The story focuses on the bizarre life of a large family simply trying to stay afloat in both financial and social situations of their life. Claire Danes (Hala) plays a beautiful but rebellious young girl who puts out a ""pure"" act in front of those who don't know her well (like the Church). Her father, Bolek, an honest and prideful baker, who is well aware of his family's problems (and secretly, while never blantly said of, his wife's affair), struggles to put up a brave front while dealing with family issues. In the movie Hala is impregnanted by the same police man who pulled her over for breaking curfew (or another unsaid reason). Hala's mother is infuriated and when Hala's lover refuses her offer of marriage several times, takes things into her own hands and drags along Hala's many older brothers to beat him up.

In the mist of the fury, Hala is chosen to represent the innocence and purity of the Virgin Mary by her church. Although Hala puts up a happy and brave front for her family, her peers ridicule her for it and eventually screw the parade as they chant obscenities to her. As Hala approaches the statue of the Virgin Mary, she questions why she was chosen and in an act of pure mockery (or more so, something only a rebellious girl could do), takes the crown she was to place on Mary's head and tops it on her own, crying out, ""Put this in your pipe and smoke it!"" She is punished but the movie does not get off easily without a good end; Hala (I am assuming, as the way this movie ends) marries the dull and emotionally-challeneged police man and gives birth to their baby boy and all is good once again.

This movie is not without it's imperfections; it is rather slow and the plot seems to be going absolutely nowhere at times yet, the honest portrayal of the family is so stunningly dramatic that I often found myself just staring at the TV screen in disbelief (both good and bad). I can see why many of the reviewers here are infuriated and while it can be a little too much, Polish Wedding is realistic: the eight year old soon is addicted to cigarattes, the beautiful wife is an adultress and the rebellious daughter seems to get away with everything.

I found this movie to be rather enjoyable. It's not like many other realistic cultural movies where it shows an actual portrayal of a certain lifestyle but like I said before, while I'm not an expert at the Polish culture, I can tell it's only trying to poke fun, not be racist. I didn't walk away thinking this was how all Polish acted. Then again, the message I'm getting from the Polish reviewers here is this: if ""Polish Wedding"" is attempting to be racist by going over the top, couldn't the same by said for ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"", which is merely ""poking fun"" of it's own cultural traditions?",1105574400,10,3341,4.490131578947368
1004384,1,6305265682,"A horrible, pointless film in which the actors are way too good for the script. I was not surprised to see that the writer/director has done nothing else since. Let's hope her urge to create remains dormant.

There is not much Polish in the characters other than the names. I fail to see any real traditions from Eastern Europe. The film was shot in a suburb quite a ways from Detroit that is known for having a large Polish community. I think they mentioned Pierogi once, although it was said wrong.

Great acting and probably a good portrayal of the Polish area of Detroit, but where is this movie going?

It drags, there is no real story and perhaps it is simply supposed to be a Polish-American version of the Irish classic ""The Snapper"" (1994).

I decided to browse the reviews on it to see if I'm truely missing out on a great ending. I was surprised to see a few reviews that were pointless. Critizing the setting and the background of the story as being unbelievable, threw me way off. Apparently, there's a few things that those reviewers should know in order to better appreciate this movie.
1. In the Midwest (Detroit is considered a part of the midwest)there are cities that are still segragated (for lack of a better word) to an extend based on ethnic background. People are born, live and die without ever living outside the 2 mile radius of their neighborehoods.
2. 5th-7th generation Polish-Americans tend not to have a distinct stereotypical cartoony accent.
3. People still hang their laundry out to dry. Where do you think ""Downy"" got 'Summer Breeze"" from?
4. Ethnic movies like this one and "" My Big, Fat Greek Wedding"" are usually made by people of that ethnic background. There is a difference regarding poking fun at your own background, your ethnic background, racial stereotypes, and racial truths. Both of these movies seem to be poking fun at life in general from their observation. You have to be very small minded to think that any ethnic movie represents an entire race. If you felt that these movies are stereotypes, I suppose you might say the same thing about ""The Joy Luck Club"" or ""Soul Food"".
 5. And lastly, why do I feel the need to make these points? I'm from the Midwest and I noticed the reviewers who made those un-supported critisms are from the Soutn and West coast and I'm guessing have never lived in the Midwest. Polish Wedding holds true to a realistic setting that I can compare to the Polish-American neighborhoods of Milwaukee, WI, from which I was born and raised.",1060041600,21,1858,4.681957186544342

Set in Hamtramck, the one-time Polish enclave in Detroit, the movie harkens back to decades ago although it is mistakenly set in the present.

  Although the plot is subtle enough, with not-everything-spelled out, the many factual errors detract considerably from the viewer's experience. (Who leaves laundry outside on the line all night in humid southeastern Michigan? And how many parishes, no matter how ethnically traditional, still hold processions of the Virgin Mary? For that matter, what priest would choose as Mary's representative, an aimless high school dropout whose mother is the local sleep-around? And the Polish-Americans of Hamtramck, while proudly descended from old-country emigrant ancestors of decades ago,  speak unaccented English, with the rare exception of a few octogenarian-plus  grandmas.)  Sorry, my own ""suspension-of-disbelief"" just doesn't stretch that far!

  The competent acting performances, turned in by the entire cast,  are wasted in this film which has many unintentional bits of humor (see above).  The intentional bits of humor---the mother and brothers and father chasing with hockey sticks after the young policeman who impregnated the family's daughter--are just not funny enough to redeem this film.",1059350400,9,1394,5.585714285714285

I have read the other reviews here, but I will say this movie captured my imagination and I found the portrayals by Lena Olin and Gabriel Byrne to be particularly stirring. Claire Danes was fine in a supporting role, but it was the tension and love between her parents which really moved me.
Perhaps my imagination was captured so readily because my family immigrated from Poland some 70 years ago, and I wanted to see this portrayal of Polish life and community. But what stayed with me was the breathless tension between Jadzia and her husband, the power this beautiful woman had over him, the confusion and strength in his silence, the seeming clumsiness of her values, their stumbling around their own lives and loves. There is something quite endearing about the wanton way in which they live and love.

The saying, mother like daughter, clings correct here, since her daughter Hala (Claire Danes), a high school drop out, is seeing a young neighborhood policeman and becomes pregnant.  In the process, she is chosen by regions of the catholic church to represent the innocence of Virgin Mary while she is pressing the young policeman to marry her.

Getting pregnant was a very horrify experience for the daughter and it was very emotional for the audience. It was hard not to want to go comfort Claire and get her help. (I think it would have been best for her to give the baby up for adoption so that people who really need and want children but can't should have a child, instead of someone who didn't want and really didn't need at this point in life to be pregnant.)This story is to show that life is not perfect. Even the happy ending left you feeling empty, hurt, bitter, and melancholy.
One scene I really liked and thought was very intersesting was the scene at the end where the mother was asking if anyone wanted pickles and the son tried to politely pass, but Gabriel Byrne frankly declared he hated pickles. The pickles represented her selfishness. Her husband had asked her before if she ever thought there was anything more important than herself. She only made pickles because she wanted them. This is symbolicly linked to her adulterous affair and how she realized she had been selfish when she looked around with an empty feeling at all the pickles in the closet. Her husband was very loving and all was reconciled between them.
CLaire Danes looked beautiful in this movie. It was ironic to see her portraying the virgin in the celebration and then when people learned of her pregnancy for the priest to almost strike her. It shows that so many people are hypocrites. This girl needed help, someone to guide her and love her. And then for a priest, a religious figure to reject and condemn her with such disdain as though he were pure and blameless. The scene reminded me very much of Hester Prynne's long walk through the unforgiving crowd in the Scarlet Letter by Hawthorne. It is also like Hawthorne's book because of the hypocrisy of the clergy and you can see Hester's determination and dignity in Claire Danes' eyes as she walks through the silent and dissapproving crowd that parts like the Red Sea, afraid to let her get near them for fear of her dirtying them with her sin.
I really like this movie, not because it makes me happy; but because it makes me think about life. Any one who feels they might want to watch something that would stretch their hearts or maybe bring them some maturity should watch this movie. It will make those of us who are sheltered learn about people's lives, about people who create their own misfortunes and deal with unfortunate circumstances. It will open your eyes.",1018051200,7,3150,4.606761565836299
1004462,4,6305265682,"I have seen this movie numerous times and it never gets old. There's so much going on in the story- about Claire Danes, her mother, father, and the rest of her family- to keep the movie interesting and funny everytime. I especially like how it shows the many traditions of a Polish family and community. Definitely worth buying!",1013212800,2,328,4.672413793103448
1004463,4,6305265682,"Life is not ALWAYS funny, and neither was this movie, but I have to believe it was not meant to be.  The characters and setting are rich and believable (isn't this what movies and books are about-- suspension of disbelief, and being taken to another time and place?).
No, I didn't sit there and laugh the whole time, but I did feel deep emotion throughout the movie.  Anger, indignation, pride, empathy, amazement (Lena Olin's character is quite a wildwoman), joy, curiosity, sadness, pity, regret, hope... and the list goes on.
No, darlings, it's not a Jim Carrey brainless comedy, and it's not a Minnie Driver brainy comedy, either.  It is a drama that is funny occasionally because life is funny occasionally. (Sometimes you either laugh or you cry, you know.  This movie is an excellent example of that.)
And if that weren't enough, well then, what about watching it for Gabriel Byrne?  He is compelling as the Polish, chain-smoking, flour-dusted baker-- husband to the dashing and determined Lena Olin and father to the fresh and curious Claire Danes.  Byrne's performance is reason enough to watch this film. For one thing, his accent is absolutely perfect.  The viewer is not reminded that this is an Irishman, because he plays the Pole through and through.
Though Olin's character seems to be running the show, one look at Byrne sitting on the steps blowing smoke into the sky and flashing his dark-fringed moody blues is enough to make you feel this man knows what's going on.  He's no dummy.  But he accepts the imperfections in his life because, well, life isn't perfect.  Unlike most of us, he is finding contentment in a world that would leave most wanting.  There are no cellphones, cable TV, or credit cards, no designer clothing, nothing trendy at all in this movie, yet the world of the characters is complete, and in turn, the story is focused on the people and what is truly important in their lives.  SO different from many movies these days.
This is simply the story of a Polish family in Detroit who are trying in their own way to be who they are (some of them still trying to find out who they are).  After seeing the story unfold before me, I felt like I had a taken a glimpse behind closed doors.  I'd say that makes the movie effective, wouldn't you?
I would happily watch this movie again and again.",993168000,41,2326,4.669117647058823
1004464,3,6305265682,"I spent the first 30 minutes of this movie waiting for the director to figure out whether he had filmed a drama or a comedy.  Eventually, the 'comedy' that Blockbuster had promised (that's how they categorize it) began to emerge slowly.  If you make it through the first 20 minutes, there are some enjoyable sequences and small laughs in the next hour.
When the foundation of your movie is based upon an Irishman (Gabriel Byrne) and a Swede (Lena Olin) playing a Polish couple, you know Fox isn't readying an Oscar pitch to accompany the release.  To their credit, these two do a pretty fair job pulling off what is obviously a stretch for them.  As for the other actors:  it's amateur hour.  Claire Danes does okay despite the one-dimensional role she's handed.  [""Claire: Be a waif!""]
Lena Olin - in particular - excels and looks beautiful.  Even when cleaning toilets.  The costume designers must have had a hoot concocting Olin's uniform for her ""Polish Womans' Auxiliary Service.""  She looks outrageously sexy in this over-the-top get-up, replete with shawl and jaunty cap.  And Byrne's character knows it, too.  Every time Olin puts on the uniform to go out, his suspicions are raised.  In one of the films best lines (indicative of the style of humor exhibited in the film), Byrne notes: ""Another meeting of the Polish Womans' Auxiliary Service.  And the obvious question is: Auxiliary to what?""",979084800,3,1402,4.860759493670886

Lena Olin is the highlight of  this film. She adds the flair and talent that saves this movie from being a  complete bomb. She's also joins Julie Christie, Goldie Hawn, Tina Turner  and Cher in Hollywood's fountain of youth club--she looks fabulous!",960940800,,502,4.8023255813953485
1004468,1,6305265682,"Fox Searchlight had worked hard over the past few years to attempt to carve a niche in the expansive low-budget, boutique film business, dominated by Miramax (commercial) and well represented by Sony Pictures  Classic (artistic).
The saying is if you keep throwing something against  the wall eventually it will stick? It hasn't stuck yet for Fox Searchlight  (where forgettable films  like Stealing Beauty,  Ice Storm, Smilla's Sense  of Snow, Slums of Beverly Hill's and Blood and Wine tend to congregate on  everyone's `just-missed' list).
Polish Wedding is an amatuerish effort.  A small film like `In the Company of Men"" succeeds through an innovative  idea, strong acting performances and passionate filmmaking, Polish Wedding  has none of these components.
Claire Danes is wonderful on-screen, yet  miscast in most every film she's played. Gabriel Byrne continues a  succession of non-descript performances in non-descript films. Good idea  dressing up Lena Olin, one of the world's true on-screen beauties,  as a  janitor, cleaning toilets in full makeup.
There's a nice screaming baby  sequence in the 1st ten minutes that will drive you away quicker than the  poorly used musical score.
