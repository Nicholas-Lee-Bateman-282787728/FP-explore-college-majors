1846640,5,B00008H2HG,This video is one of my 6-month old son's favorites.  It shows real farm animals and plenty of tractors!  He loves it all and I think it will be a favorite for a while.  We had a 4-year old and 2-year old over one day and they loved it too.  I think it makes a nice addition to the Einstein series.,1066608000,,298,3.8360655737704916
1846641,5,B00008H2HG,I like this video a lot and I would suggest any parent looking for a good educational video for their child to get this one.  The soundtrack that goes along is also very good and in tune with what is on the screen.  They also make good gifts.,1059004800,,242,4.020833333333333
1846642,1,B00008H2HG,"I have three wonderful children and consider myself a successful Mother. But having shown these videos to my children now calls that into question.
I often buy new developmental products for my kids and of course, they are not all a success, but none has been a disaster such as this. In a word these videos are - pathetic. My children hated them and I literally sat there in awe as they watched what is described as progressively developmental but in reality was created by people who have no concept of what the term developmental means. It is apparent that the creators of these products have not had much interaction with children.
As an educated woman I find this video series patronizing and I find the parenting guide a joke. Since when is Joyce Brothers an expert on raising children? She is obviously simply for hire. This guide is worthless and again, patronizing.
I do not reccomend these videos to anyone.",1058227200,2,917,4.701863354037267
1846643,5,B00008H2HG,"This video provides excellent visual and auditory stimulation for infants and toddlers. The video uses classical music, which has been proven to stimulate developing minds. The mix of real animals and stuffed animals allows for the child to begin making the association between the two. The colors are very stimulating for the child to watch as well. Whenever my child watches the video he seems to be very interested in what is happening on the screen. I would highly recommend the video to anyone who has an age appropriate child.",1057708800,,532,4.9222222222222225
1846644,5,B00008H2HG,"I was pleasently pleased by the reaction of my infant to Baby Superstar Farmer.  At first I was sceptical about videos for children, but my baby loved the video and I found the parents guide on the DVD very useful.  My baby coos and laughs each time I play the video, and I feel better knowing that it was designed by pediatricians and will help my baby develop.",1055203200,2,362,4.3088235294117645
1846645,1,B00008H2HG,"I too am terribly disappointed with this video.  The animation looks amateurish, the video looks dated and the toys featured look cheap and tacky. Unlike the toys featured in the Baby Einstein series, I'd probably never buy any of these.
And this video is supposed to be developmentally sound, but it must be based on outdated developmental theories.  My children are not at all captivated by the video, and although they are in the age range for this and the other products, they are so far beyond the level of these videos that they have no interest in watching them. They literally left the room last time I tried to play it for them.
This product is so far inferior to anything in the Baby Einstein line that they should not even be listed in the same category. I do not recommend them.  In fact, I am returning the video I bought.",1054512000,3,835,4.480263157894737

7983920,4,B00008H2HG,"I am glad I could find this on Amazon. This was my toddlers favorite movie and it broke.  Fortunately, I found it here and was able to order the others as well.",1437004800,,160,4.0
7983921,5,B00008H2HG,My son loved all of these DVDS. We always liked them better than any others on market even Baby Einsteins. Even after he was older he loved the music and the tractors and other scenery. We ordered these dvds for a baby gift. Well worth the money.,1217203200,2,246,4.25531914893617
7983922,5,B00008H2HG,"We LOVE this series and have them all!  I had no intention of my son viewing television until he was at least 2 years old (as recommended by the American Pediatrics Association) but have now made peace with the machine.  We have only one TV in the house and it is in our bedroom.  I use this series when I absolutely must do something and can not wait until a nap time for whatever reason. I put him in a seat and he doesn't fuss at being confined. But the most common reason for my son watching tv is crying at night or not feeling good at any time of day.  He is able to calm down and relax, despite fever or teething.  I keep one of this series in at all times ready for a screaming emergency!

So, that is how I use it.  Now for a specific review, my son prefers these videos over the others that I have tried.  The music is wonderful as so many people have said.  He enjoys the anmimals and has his favorite scenes.  As for the other reviewers' complaints, I am glad for no narration as that makes it more relaxing.  I do not use tv to try to educate my child.  We do that all day long with personal interaction, books, etc.  Most of the time that he is watching tv I am right beside him and sometimes make the appropriate animal noises and identify the animals for him.  We find this series to have more real life footage and paced/matching music to the action.
Our favorite of the series is ""Forest Ranger"" but ""Farmer"" is great too.
If you occasionally allow some tv this is a great series to enjoy.",1194998400,2,1507,4.151724137931034
7983923,5,B00008H2HG,I purchased this video hoping it would captivate my little one like the Baby Einstein videos do.....and let me say this one exceeded my expectations!!! I Highly recommend this video!! In my opinion even better than Baby Einstein!! Music is upbeat and video is very engaging! My Five year old even loves watching it!! 5 STARS!!!!!!!!!,1136419200,,333,4.964285714285714
7983924,5,B00008H2HG,"I've read the comments from the odd person here and there complaining that the video isn't compelling enough, or criticizing the choice of visuals.

As a professional musician, I'm ecstatic that these videos used true orchestral versions of GOOD music, and didn't resort to watered-down synthesized versions that turned Mozart into pablum.

We've got 3 1/2-month-old twins, and they both love these DVDs.  I find it incredibly interesting to take note of which scenes really get them going; for instance, one of our little guys goes nuts as soon as the tractor/combine scenes start in the Farmer video.  Every time... every single time.  As for me, I just want to watch the piggies during the Sabre Dance.  Someone else commented that the manner in which the music and visuals were matched was amusing in a subtle way, which couldn't be more true.  These folks actually paid attention to the rhythm and melody of the music, which is really refreshing!

I love these, and wish there were more of them...

Baby Einstein videos seem like a huge ripoff after hearing these; they're like listening to one musical bouncy seat after another... I'd like my babies to know that there's more to music than that!",1116460800,2,1201,4.876847290640394
7983925,5,B00008H2HG,"This is the only DVD we have bought for our baby, so I can't compare to others, but we really like it. The music is great and there is lots of footage of real animals as well as puppets and other toys. The baby (11 months) likes it a lot and squeals when he sees the animals. My husband and I love it, too--the way they match the music to the images is very funny in a subtle way.",1096243200,2,380,3.8227848101265822
7983926,5,B00008H2HG,"We have been using ""Baby Superstar -- Farmer"" with our wee one (just turned 1) for several months now as one of her rotation of DVDs, and it has been a huge hit.
The DVD plays the well-known movements from various famous classical tunes over a montage of farm scenes.  Generally, there's one kind of animal or activity (numerous shots of cool John Deere tractors and combines) per tune.  Each vignette intersperes live action shots of the horse/pig/tractor with shots of a corresponding toy, which is a nice touch because it helps the baby track the toy to its real-world counterpart.  Each vignette seems to take about 2-3 minutes.
Between each vignette there is a (rather basic) animation shot of the Baby Superstar from the cover, accompanied by a giggle.  This has, until recently, been enough to make our baby laugh, too.
Mommy and Daddy will appreciate this DVD because the music is the ""real deal,"" not some child-Muzak version of the classical music.  Accordingly, you can have it on and not be driven crazy by the ""baby-oriented"" music that plagues so many products.
Not as complex as some of the Baby Einstein products, but it's a good, quality 30-minute activity/distraction for baby and parents.  (Be warned -- the DVD has an auto-replay function that apparently can't be turned off, so you can't just wait until the music stops as your cue to get baby to do something else.)",1086652800,,1387,4.7824267782426775
7983927,5,B00008H2HG,"My daughter (9 months old) received this DVD as a Christmas Present.  She gets very excited when I play the DVD and can watch the entire show (this gives me a needed break), she claps along to the music.  She has not been interested in other videos, but loves this DVD, especially the music and animals.  I would recommend this DVD to any parent with a child under 18 months.",1073174400,2,375,4.328571428571428
7983928,1,B00008H2HG,"I have many of the Brainy Baby and Baby Einstein DVD's and was encouraged to buy this one by the glowing reviews it had received. I was very disappointed. Unlike the others, there is NO narration at all. My biggest complaint: these videos do not identify the picture that is being shown--either verbally or in print on the screen. So, the video shows a hundred pictures of cows without ever showing the word ""cow"", or naming them, or the sound they make (or anything else about them)...just picture after picture set to classical music. No narration. No words to read. Pretty darn dull. So, I'm not sure why this is supposed to be so 'educational'; but personally I would not buy any more in this series. There are much better DVD's out there on which to spend your money.",1072915200,2,772,4.561151079136691
