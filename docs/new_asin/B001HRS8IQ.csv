8309427,5,B001HRS8IQ,"LAS TRES ALEGRES COMADRESTHE THREE MERRY COMADRES (or, as it applies here, GIRLFRIENDS)stars Mexican-cinema favorites Amalia Atomic Bomb Aguilar, Lilia Prado and Lilia del Valle as a trio of curvaceous comadres who work as models and movie extras while pursuing their dream of becoming successful cabaret entertainers.  This premise serves as a framework for a loosely-structured series of events designed to showcase the considerable charm, comic energy and musical talents of the three leads.
This DVD release (from Pegassus Films) is in Spanish only with no option for English subtitles.  Yet even for those like me who don't speak the language fluently, its an entertaining romp.  And certainly no subtitles are needed to enjoy the performances of the three leading ladies, whose combined appeal transcends any language barrier.
While the source material hasn't been remasteredthe B&W contrast levels vary and some scenes are washed outthe quality is pretty good overall and shouldnt ruin ones enjoyment of the movie.  (Im always amazed that films like this have survived at all.)  The official running time is given as 113 minutes but this copy runs just under 102, though the film doesnt appear to be incomplete.
Recommended for those who are familiar with (as well as those who want to discover) the talents of these three lovely ladies.",1526083200,,1344,5.232558139534884

The story: three girlfriends are trying to make it big in showbiz or films, but can't catch a break. Each one has a talent for singing and dancing and great comic timing. The leader of the three decides that in order to make it big, they all have to dump their boyfriends, who don't make very good money, and move to a big city with more opportunities. What they don't know is that one of the boyfriends is actually filthy rich, but pretends not to be. He just wants a girl that'll love him for himself and not his money. The girls take off for the city and start working at a night club singing and dancing... and swindling men out of their money. Things go south when the boyfriends find out their plans and track them down. They pay off some cops to round up the girls and keep them in jail overnight to teach them a lesson. When the girls call up their boyfriends for help, the boys show up and deny ever knowing these women. The girls lose their argument and try to use their feminine wiles on the guards to escape, but fail and end up spending the night locked up in a room. In the morning, the girls find that the door is unlocked and make a run for it, all the while being watched from afar by their boyfriends. Of course, there is a happy ending for all and there are a few musical dance numbers that showcase the talents of the actresses who were a big deal back in the day. Goood music, good dancing, good fun. You can check out a few clips of this movie on Youtube if you're not sure about it. This film is a gem; I'm really glad I found it on Amazon :)",1361145600,,1659,4.139318885448916
