8352535,4,B0026FURXC,"I first saw this film, ""Nunzio Pianese, 14 anni a maggio"" (to put the eponymous boy's first and last names back into normal sequence within the title, which reverses them, as the officialdom portrayed prefers), marketed in English as titled ""Sacred Silence"", when it came out or close to that, at an international gay film festival (""Images + Nations"") which takes place yearly in Montral. The memory of this film, so broodingly intimate and mysteriously full of tension between the homey and spacious interior of the presbytery (priest's residence) and the forebodingly looming worlds, outside, of crime, of corrupted law and politics, of sacred and secular singing, and of the Italian pop music industry, is very striking. It is very gratifying to be able to see the film as frequently as I desire by means of the particular DVD edition (Picture This! Home Video PTHV-5091, bearing the ISBN 1-893410-22-6, in Italian with English subtitles) which I chose to obtain. Having visited Naples twice in the early 1960s, while in the U.S. Navy, it also is for me a pleasure, as it will be for other viewers, to see in this movie so many images of the city's rather seedy but colourful, crowded, and lively street life.

There is constant suspense about what finally begins to transpire by the long-anticipated ending of the film, when disaster is about to befall the brave priest (compromisingly tainted by his ephebophile sexual proclivity) and the boy, Nunzio Pianese, whose whole situation will change as the film progresses. During all this, Nunzio has been attaining pop music star status as a skilled celebrity ""boy singer"" (going by the show-business name of ""Nino Pinis""), his pleasing adolescent beauty enhancing his public appeal, much as it has provoked the priest's illicit love for him.

The boy, who, essentially, is developing heterosexually despite his abnormal situation, accedes to the priest's sexual desires from respect and friendship for the adult man rather than from youthful passion or from any incipient homosexual or bisexual orientation on young Nunzio's own part. The city's corrupt criminal forces, and the local government authorities who facilitate in their undertakings, ensnare the priest, having learned of his scandalous sexual activites, in order to end the cleric's reforming efforts against their joint municipal turpitude, and also entrap the boy, whom they manoeuvre into betraying the priest who loves him and who has taken such an interest in furthering his musical attainments.

The film ends as the forces against the priest are closing in on him unawares. While some have found the slow development of the motion picture's action tiresome, my perception is that this gradual working out of the plight of the priest and of Nunzio, and of the depiction of the violence and corruption that surrounds them, make the hovering menace of the film's conclusion all the more effective.",1298764800,,2917,5.149789029535865
