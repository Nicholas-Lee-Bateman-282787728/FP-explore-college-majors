200976,5,1603996796,It shows the magical feeling of being at a Taylor's concert! Incredible prodution and her beautiful voice makes it INCREDIBLE.,1322784000,,126,5.35
200977,5,1603996796,"the blu-ray version is a best buy exclusive, get it there while you still can instead of buying it here, it's much cheaper
although if you're willing to wait, i think amazon will start offering the blu-ray version in january for a more reasonable price than the third party sellers",1321228800,8,281,4.64
200978,5,1603996796,"If you didn't get to watched this on TV (or you did), you won't be disappointed in the DVD. It contains all three episodes which aired on the Hub. It consist of interviews with Taylor herself, along with all those who were involved in the Fearless Tour and shows snippets of performance taken from the tour. The documentary gives you an in depth report on Taylor's life from her as a child to going to Nashville when she was 11 onto signing her record deal with Scott Borchetta, president and owner of Big Machine Records, onward to even a small snippet about Speak Now. You also get a behind the scenes look at how Taylor designed for the tour as well as behind the scenes stuff you'd originally would've known had you gone to her shows. Including about the T-Party and Mamma Swift's Backstage tour. Thirteen performances are included on the DVD all thirteen are seen in snippets throughout the Journey to Fearless documentary.

This is just amazing and as a Taylor Swift fan I am proud to own this. It isn't a disappointment and it's worth your money so be sure to get your copy. Taylor is just amazing! 5 stars!",1318291200,49,1114,4.514851485148514
200979,5,1603996796,I've been waiting for this to be released for a year.  Our family watched it the first time (October 2010) it was on the HUB and we DVRed it the second time (December 2010).  Now I will be able to get it off the DVR and my daughter will be able to watch it whenever and wherever she wants especially in the car for trip.  She is a hugh fan.  I agree with the other review that asked when will Speak Now be available.  That was my daughter's first concert and I'd love to get that for her too.  Keep making wonderful music Taylor.,1317859200,24,529,4.038461538461538
200980,5,1603996796,"This DVD was amazing! I can't wait to just flip it on and watch it again!
I don't even know where to start! When i was asked to give my thoughts on the DVD both positive, and any negative i was excited and ready to watch!

When the video first started, i thought oh, this might just be an E True Hollywood Story with basic facts about Taylor that i already know. But it wasn't even close!!! Its filled with information on Taylor i never even knew (and... not to brag but i know a lot haha)! All the questions that i ever had about Taylor, her songs, the true meaning behind them, the people who take part in her awesome performances, down to how she got to hand select all of her dancers and everything in between!!

I actually got to go to the Fearless Tour last summer and this DVD captures every little bit of the rush, emotions, feelings, music, and performances of that night. And now i can just turn on this DVD and experience all over again!

This DVD really helped me get to know Taylor. Sounds funny i know, but the things you learn in this DVD isn't just facts, its learning what kind of person she really is and how amazing she is. The thing about Taylor Swift is that she is one of us. She wasn't the noticed girl in high school, she was in love with boys who never noticed her, she had her heart broken and she came home and spent time with her family and wrote songs. This is the type of person that i want to be a fan of and whom i want to learn more about. Because she is imperfect,  and she is REAL and thats what makes her such an inspiration. Just her music alone helped me through so much in my life which sounds like a clique but it really has, and i only hope more and more girls listen to her music and get inspired, so they make the right choices.

The only question i would have about this DVD, is.... WHEN DOES THE ""SPEAK NOW"" DVD COME OUT???

I am truly so thankful to get to watch and experience and review this DVD before its even out!! its such an honor and a blessing. This DVD is amazing and i love the idea and the knowledge that it brings.",1316649600,11,2073,4.093596059113301
200981,5,1603996796,"Taylor Swift was born to be an artist/songwriter/musician/singer. This is the cable tv special that was aired over 3 nights, which is why I can offer an opinion before it's release.
This is an excellent dvd. It's a documentary about Taylor's extraordinary musical journey from early home movies to the great live & backstage footage of her Fearless Tour. My highest recommendation for this dvd. This is the one to get. I've enjoyed it several times on a dvd-r that I burnt from the HUB cable channel, but I'm replacing it with this factory dvd which will not have the station logo in the right hand corner and will look even better than what I copied off cable. I can't say enough about how much fun this dvd is. Great sound and picture quality! No question--5 stars and worth every penny!!
  I just noticed the listing that this is released by Shout Factory. I have bought cds and dvds released by Shout Factory and have always been impressed by the quality of their products. Another reason to buy Journey To Fearless!",1315872000,18,1020,4.629834254143646

This would be a good video for young people who have plans for their future and are shunned or bullied by classmates. Bullies don't usually end up following a dream, they are too busy trying to hurt others. I love this video and my Grandson likes Taylor Swift also.

No doubt her skills will improve substantial given the extraordinary advantages celebrity status can garnish, but it's doubtful her inherent talents will ever match her promoted ones.

Now that we have heard the commentary, although it was very interesting and well done, we would like to just here the concert sections. If you ""skip track"" you go to the start of the next song. A little annoying. I'd like a way to play the live songs without the commentary. However the songs are good and we put up with the minor aggravation. So we still give it 5 stars.

THis does not mean Taylor cannot sing but I was brought up in a different era where every word, note and breath had feeling.
In my day if a singer brought out a disc with ten songs, nine of them stirred the emotions.
Now it seems only one song in ten does that to me.
It could be a sign of aging..!!

While there's plenty of concert footage included in this three-episode music special, it's the interviews and behind the scenes stuff that makes it worth watching.  Taylor Swift is an amazing success story, and you get a chance to see her whirlwind life on the road during her first big headliner concert tour.

Through interviews with Taylor, her parents, band members, producers, friends and even her BFF Abigail (whom she wrote the song ""Fifteen"" about) you get to know this very talented and ambitious young lady. The DVD has the concert footage broken out by song if you just want to see the show. Most of the video is blu-ray quality, except for the camera-phone and home movie footage, and the audio is great throughout.

Her personality matches her great talent.",1366502400,,154,4.344827586206897
201064,5,1603996796,This DVD tells how much work Taylor Swift and many others put into this tour and just how much planning and rehearsing went into it.  I couldn't believe the amount of work goes into setting up AND playing a tour!!!  Taylor Swift was absolutely amazing in this DVD.  Every Taylor Swift fan should see this DVD!!!,1365724800,,311,4.517857142857143
201065,5,1603996796,"Taylor Swift is an exceptional person.  Warm, engaging, authentic, down-to-earth - she is very real and wonderful.  I have loved her since stumbling upon an interview with her after her win at the Grammy's, where she stole my heart with her winning humor and grace after, ""that guy"" made such an awful comment 'that beyonce should have got it' while making the award announcement that Taylor Swift was the Grammy Winner ~ Taylor Rocks it with Grace! and then some!

Taylor Swift inspires me to go for my dreams.  One day I very much hope to meet her and thank her in person.  There is no one quite like her. So talented and genuinely kind.  She is an excellent role model.

She is wonderful here in a personal way sharing her journey.  Lots of interviews and music, with herself, family, friends, and her fans.

This is something you can view with the whole family.  Inspiring to the little ones also!",1363305600,,901,4.575
201066,5,1603996796,"The dvd is amazing! I really liked it because Taylor tells us about her life as well as how things work in backstage.
In addition to this, we can see some parts of her concert and how she and other people prepare the entire show!
I totally recommend this product :)",1363305600,,265,4.215686274509804
201067,4,1603996796,An excellent video presentation of this album.  A little too much behind the scenes stuff for my taste but the live songs are great.,1363132800,,132,4.5
201068,5,1603996796,Greet for tweens and teens. Taylor Swift is not that much older and can totally relate to their lives. Thanks,1360627200,,109,4.5
201069,5,1603996796,"My 12yr old received this as a gift from my 13mos old(they all exchange gifts with each other to learn the joy of giving as well as receiving). She is still reading it and learning more facts.

This IS more of a ""fact"" book than a story, the pages are loaded with pictures that have captions-some have 4-5 captions 1-2 paragraphs long, others just have one paragraph or several pictures on one page each with a paragraph or two. The photos make it seem like she isn't even reading-which is good sometimes ;-)

Good read for a teen/tween Taylor Swift fan(or adult for that matter).",1359763200,,580,4.514285714285714
201070,5,1603996796,"Interesting background stories and information on Taylor, especially if you haven't heard her stories before. Not every song on the CD appears here. I'm not sure the Blu-ray version is all that much better than the DVD version. Being a member of Taylor Nation, I love watching her perform much more than just listening to a CD. Performance video quality and sound are excellent. If you love Taylor, you need to add this to your collection.",1359417600,,439,4.7894736842105265

201072,4,1603996796,"I knew her only through CD, so this is a great disc for me to get to know her better (about her personality, etc).  But from 2nd time, I wish I have option to watch only her concert, not all of those interviews everytime.",1358208000,,221,4.0227272727272725

201077,5,1603996796,"I know not everyone is a fan of Taylor Swift, but if you are, this is a must-see! My kids (8 and under) all really like her music, and she is a pretty good role model, as far as celebrities go, so I thought this would be a great gift for my oldest daughter's birthday. We have watched it together a few times, and have always enjoyed it. It is FULL of great live performances, interspersed with interviews with Taylor and others about Taylor and how she grew to be the country/pop star she is up to the point of her second album (Fearless) being released.

It is a lot of fun to watch, and I highly recommend it if you are a Taylor Swift fan!",1353369600,,642,4.095238095238095
201078,4,1603996796,"Overall it was worth the money and time. I received exactly what I paid for, and I enjoyed watching the Fearless DVD and so did the kids. There was nothing inappropriate. There was some additional commentary during some of the songs listed on the set list, which seemed to only slightly annoy the littles. It was a good buy and much cheaper than any other price elsewhere! I'd do it again in a heartbeat! So, once again,  interesting DVD, suitable for children and adults alike, and I learned a little more about the amazing Taylor Swift! It was a fun and entertaining DVD!",1348012800,2,573,4.563106796116505

201081,4,1603996796,"I bought this DVD because I admire the perseverance and inspirational performance of Taylor Swift. I'm not part of the typical demographic of fans, but I am moved by performers, business people and leaders who reach the top of their profession by unswerving perseverance and confidence in their abilities and genuiness in arriving at the top. The movie shows Taylor as she takes every opportunity as a young child to sing and play guitar.  We see many home movies, back stage videos and personal comments that allow the viewer to see she appears to be down-to-earth and thankful for her talents and good fortune. The background of being on the cusp of being discovered after moving to Nashville and walking away from a large recording company to record her own songs with a new and developing recording company was a calculated risk that paid off extremely well for her. There are many performances of her singing, but it isn't a concert video...it is defninitely more of her ""journey"" towards stardom and her appreciation of the fans who love and appreciate her. Recommend for any Taylor Swift fan or for someone who wants to see personal clips of her journey towards the top of her profession!",1331596800,4,1195,4.829268292682927
201082,5,1603996796,I enjoyed learning about Taylor's story.  I thought it was well done.  I passed it onto an eleven year old girl who I know will love it too.,1329782400,,140,3.9642857142857144
201083,5,1603996796,"I bought this for my 7 year old daughter and this DVD is so awesome, she has watched about a dozen or more times in just 2 months.  I have even watched it almost just as much.  It shows her performing at concerts and just tells us the story of how she got to Nashville and started up her career.  Interviewing Taylor herself, her family, her friends and band members.  This is not a waste of money, it is SO good!!",1328659200,,414,4.074074074074074
201084,5,1603996796,"Great music and a bunch of history about how Taylor became the wonderful entertainer she is.  Interesting to learn about her early years including how she happened to learn guitar, write songs, etc.  Truly enjoyed it!",1326672000,,217,5.0
201085,5,1603996796,"This is the best movie I have ever seen! It shows a mix of Taylor singing, home videos, and interviews. I am an enormous Taylor Swift fan and I fully intend to watch this many more times. This movie is great for any age, 6 to 66, and you can watch it as a family or alone. I would recommend this movie to anyone who will listen long enough.
THIS IS AN AMAZING MOVIE FOR TAYLOR SWIFT FANS!

201088,5,1603996796,"Taylor Swift is kind, talented, hard-working, and definitely knows how to put on a good show...and this DVD shows all of those things! This DVD isn't just a concert; it shows her entire journey from birth to her sold-out Fearless tour. It shows all the tough things she's been through, as well as some of the best moments of her life. This girl is truly something special, and I didn't realize that before this DVD. I actually really disliked her (for no reason) before watching this when it premiered on TV, but watching it completely changed my opinion of her! Now just a little over year later, I've already seen her in concert, memorized all her songs, and learned everything there is to know about her:)She's a great role model, and this DVD proves that over and over again!

201090,4,1603996796,"This is a pretty good dvd documentary of Taylor Swift's Fearless tour. It gives you more inside scoop behind the scenes of the tour rather than like in the Glee Movie, half the movie was about how much people like the singers, this is from Taylor's perspective. The only setback I had though was that I wished they had shown all the songs she done on tour in one way or another, like as an additional feature if they couldn't fit it into the documentary. I was surprised they didn't show Change because at the concert, she had an inspirational story behind it, and it was very moving. Other performances not included were You're Not Sorry/What Goes Around, I'm Only Me When I'm With You (w/ Kellie Pickler and Glorianna, maybe that's why?) and the Way I Loved You, which was sad for me since those were some of my more favorite performances from the concert from her. (But then again, looking on Wiki, Change and I'm Only Me When I'm With You wasn't done one the second leg of the North American tour, which I think was where they got most of the footage from. The Speak Now DVD/CD seemed better since it practically had the whole concert, but then again, less of the documentary aspect.",1323129600,,1187,4.474654377880184
201091,5,1603996796,"Having been to two of her Fearless Tour concerts (Phx, AZ and Los Angeles), I must say that this video really captures the atmosphere and experience of being at her concert. This movie also does a great job of showing what went into bringing this tour to life, and all the preparation that went into it.

All in all, this is a spectacular film that absolutely captures the experience of being at one of her concerts.",1322870400,3,416,4.473684210526316
