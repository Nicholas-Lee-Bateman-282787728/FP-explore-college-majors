3624434,5,B001H5X6QM,"As the blurb states, there is no such thing as over-the-top in this feature -- it IS over-the-top, and the result of Cumming's writing/directing is one of the most enjoyable, albeit quite ghoulish, arthouse films I've ever seen.

The movie centers around John Vandermark, a strange, angry and rather dislikeable man who has an admitted weakness for very handsome struggling young male artists. Enter Sebastian St. Germaine, a gorgeous author who is currently taking advantage of Vandermark's ""charity"" by staying in Vandermark's house, eating his meals, and ignoring his thinly veiled sexual advances.

The movie takes off from there in an explosion of fury and extremely dark comedy, blood and hysteria. David Boreanaz plays Sebastian to perfection as a dark, angry man who is also rather abusive and egotistic, and his performance as the young man (who is eventually murdered in a scene of gruesome macabre that is too memorable to go into detail here; you'd have to see it to believe it) is one of his best to date.

However, Alan Cumming's performance as John Vandermark is really the one that will stick with you. It's like watching a lunatic running through a hallway of funhouse mirrors; constantly shifting in a dizzying whirl. He cries and whines, he screams and tortures, he laughs and breaks into hysterics. His performance is pitch-perfect and his directing is, while not groundbreaking, definitely something different to see.

This movie is incredibly artistic and feeling, probing into the darkness of obsession and the explosions of passion therein with devastating effect. There aren't really any light moments throughout the film; but that only makes the overall theme of loss and obsession easier to maintain. Boreanaz and Cumming deliver amazing performances and make their characters really come to life, and they were the high points of this movie. However, memorable performances were also given by Anne Heche and of course Carrie Fisher.

I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys independant/arthouse films, but also to anyone who enjoys dark humor, the macabre, and the gore-splattered art. I was lucky enough to see this on a big screen, and I believe the DVD will not be lacking.

WARNINGS: This is a very dark film, and there is a scene of physical torture. The death scene is one of the most amazing in the movie and the shining point in particular of Boreanaz's acting performance, but it is very graphic and incredibly disturbing. Although this is not rated, be warned that there is blood, sex, and swearing, and nudity if my memory serves.

RECOMMENDATIONS: If you enjoyed this film, the extremely disturbing and highly enjoyable art film ""Perfume: The Scent of a Murder"" would also be highly recommended. Another David Boreanaz film with rather disturbing black humor subject matter that you may also enjoy would be the Canadian independant film ""These Girls.""",1226707200,27,2902,5.096842105263158

3624437,5,B001H5X6QM,"I can say it is an excellent film, because out of the conventional and is a reality soon accepted by the majority of the people.

3624440,5,B001H5X6QM,"Campy, dark, over-the-top!  I absolutely adore this movie.  I laugh harder each time I see it.  What does that say about me!?! As a matter of fact, I am watching it right now.

WONDERFUL performances from Cummings and Boreanaz, who both really shine. What a departure for Boreanaz.  I have to give kudos for the risk.

WOW, that bathroom scene is something vile and nasty. I liked it!  Give me the look any day Sebastian!!!  I'll bring the maple syrup.  Plus, you will never look at women's underwear and Christmas lights the same way again!

I will admit, this film is not for everyone, but it is good, not so clean fun, in the vein of Rocky Horror.",1278806400,3,650,4.432203389830509
3624441,4,B001H5X6QM,"Dread, paranoia and dire consequences are the ghostwriter's fate in this riveting Polanski film.  A former British Prime Minister, Adam Lang, (Pierce Brosman) wants his memoirs completed and has his agent hires a ghostwriter.  The ghostwriter (Ewan McGregor) reluctantly decides to do it for the amazing amount of money he will be paid.  He is initially asked to finish the edits of the first ghost writer, who died mysteriously when he fell into the ocean from a ferry.

He boards a plane and flies out to the ultra-modern stark oceanfront home off the East Coast. The weather is cold and rainy, set during the grey mid-winter it seems like a long ""dark and rainy"" night.  Adam Lang is in exile, as the unseated  The day he arrives he meets Adam Lang's beautiful blond executive assistant, (Kim Cattrall) who shows him the original manuscript, locked in a drawer.  She said it cannot leave the room and he has four hours to read and peruse before talking with Adam Lang on edits.

A day after he arrives he sees on TV that a former British cabinet minister is claiming Lang illegally seized suspected terrorists and handed them over to the CIA for torture.  Reporters and protesters are all over the area outside Lang's home. Lang is in exile (like the Director Polanski).

The former Prime Minister has a strange, jealous, manipulative wife Ruth (Olivia Williams).  She knows of the affair between her husband and his executive assistant.

The movie is full of paranoia, betrayal and dark riveting plots.  The ghostwriter stumbles upon some clues left by his predecessor.  He realizes there is a Pandora's box of plots and counter plots as he races for the answers and his life.  Nothing is like it seems and the big secret is uncovered with a gasp at the astonishing ending.

This is a riveting political thriller, well directed and acted.",1270512000,,1842,4.8

3624443,2,B001H5X6QM,This DVD was not for me. If it weren't for the cast and their previous performances I wouldn't have purchased this dvd on it's own merits as it did not justify their true acting abilities.  The dialogue is too long winded and totally above my comprehensive level. The crux of the story line came too late and finished rather open ended. I consider myself to be in to a good story but didn't feel it in this instance. My apologies to others who may find it gripping.,1258070400,2,465,4.344827586206897

Maybe he was just starting his career I don't know but if I had seen this movie before Angel or Bones I would not be a fan nor purchased the other series. I was disappointed in him after seeing this film, not that my opinion matters to him or that he would care.",1478908800,,414,3.9404761904761907

8308085,5,B001H5X6QM,"Love this movie, and I LOVE ALAN CUMMING. He is a brilliant actor in this ensemble, and a tortured soul. I think it was orginally titled, ""Suffering Man's Charity"".

Everything he creates is incredible: Macbeth, Cabaret, Any Day Now, The Anniversary Party, Happy Tears...this shows yet another aspect of his acting ability. Alan's projects usually seem to vary considerably from one thing to another. Karen Black makes a great appearance, and the torture scene is awesome with David Boreanaz.",1417651200,,492,5.227848101265823
