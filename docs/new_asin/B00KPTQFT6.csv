6437976,1,B00KPTQFT6,"This is a low end western with a substandard script and acting.

Sometime after a mother dies in childbirth, Dad, a gold miner decides he can't care for his children anymore and sends them all away, although he has a house keeper and an older daughter. The daughter works at a boarding house where she comes of age, with her love divided between a wealthy young man and a ""half breed."" But she is in no way torn by it.

Eventually the characters are all forced not to follow their dreams and it turns into a bad western soap opera. There were no skulls and the river only had a cameo. I am not sure where the interesting title came from.

There are better low budget westerns out there.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs, or nudity. Brief sex/ rape scenes. Prostitution.",1413072000,5,764,4.435714285714286

6437982,1,B00KPTQFT6,"This was about the most stupid production I've ever seen.  Beautiful scenery, costumes, etc.  Could have been an interesting plot but the way it was chopped up and put together and much of the high school quality acting finally got to me after about twenty minutes.  I tried to give it a fair chance several times but I couldn't stick with long enough to see if it got any better.  What a waste of money and spoiled my movie watching night then they added sales tax to my bill as well. Come on, Amazon Prime!  Do a little quality control.  For 99 bucks a year, you should pay me for sitting through the experience.",1436659200,,614,4.342105263157895
6437983,1,B00KPTQFT6,"Absolutely the worst movie I have ever partially watched. Pointless, poorly acted, boring, meandering, and ended before it began. There is so much more to say, but any profanity would not be impulsive and is, therefore, improper. I'll beg Amazon for my money back.",1435968000,,264,5.0227272727272725
