5059293,5,B00772M1D8,"I was lucky enough to see a screening of this film, and was blown away. To echo the reviews below, it's more than a war movie, it's a family movie. The movie crosses multiple generations, and encompasses stories from two wars. For those from the WWII generation this will bring back their own memories from a time with the war was very much part of their daily life. For those with loved ones serving now it gives a real face to what is happening. For everyone else it's a solid reminder that memories are stories that need to be shared, that burdens can't be carried alone and that all generations have something to give to one another.

Additionally, it teaches us that Memorial Day is more than a time for picnics and BBQ, more than just a free day off and a parade but that it's a day when we honor and remember.

I strongly recommend this for anyone, not just those with military ties",1332892800,79,889,4.381818181818182
5059294,5,B00772M1D8,"This is an amazing film!  From the momemt I first read the script, I felt I had to be a part of this film.  I had the privelege of spending 28 of the most amazing days on set with the cast and rest of the crew working on this  film.  I was only present for the battle scenes which are a very cool part of the show,  but the real magic of this film occurs on a front porch in Minnesotta.  The story is original, extremly well written and beatifully filmed.  When I finally was able to see the film on the big screen for the first time I sat in front of a row of military officers. I heard alot of sniffles and muffled wows comming from those men in that dark theater.  This film is truely worth having in your collection!",1332806400,3,720,3.986013986013986

5059296,5,B00772M1D8,"This movie is a poignant characterization of the conflict that combat veterans live with, during and after their experiences. Focused on a WWII U.S. Paratrooper and his grandson it gives us a sense of the emotions that many combat veterans of all eras may go through - having to make a decision during a war that you know is going to end badly for someone and then having to live with your decision or in having friends be killed or injured. Anyone who has had a family member or friend who has seen combat can recognize the defensive wall that many veterans erect as their way of dealing with the experience. Hopefully this movie will encourage at least some of those veterans to allow their friends and family to try to understand.",1330646400,122,733,4.5606060606060606

5059298,5,B00772M1D8,"If you are not a veteran,  you may not appreciate this.  If you are a veteran, especially a combat veteran,  you will be totally absorbed.  I would suggest to veterans it might be best to watch this alone.  When I watched it the movie brought out long suppressed emotions, and I was glad I was alone.",1470441600,3,300,4.285714285714286

5059308,5,B00772M1D8,"Rented this great movie on Amazon Prime Video for only $0.99!! Are you kidding me? A movie as awesome as this for only $0.99?? SCORE!!!

It is about a boy finding his Grandfather's (Opa's) footlocker from his Army service in WW2. He gets to pick 3 items and his ""Opa"" tells him the story about each piece. The stories were awesome and powerful. This bonding between the grandfather and the grandson brought them closer together and turned a grumpy old man into someone who loved and respected his grandson. It is a very powerful, touching, emotional movie. It also shows the military service of the grandson when he grows up, and how some of the stories told by Opa related to his service. It really is an amazing movie and I HIGHLY suggest it if you like war movies, family movies, and movies that instill life lessons. Watch it now!!",1464739200,,835,4.566666666666666

5059311,5,B00772M1D8,"Suitable for all ages.  Although the story is fiction it is believable.  It deals gently with the problems of post traumatic stress disorder and shows how the problem can last a lifetime, and that healing comes from talking it out with loved ones.  Family is invaluable - it's why we put on a uniform in the first place.  The ones who don't come back are never forgotten. But life goes on. And sharing the memory of them brings a healing to our grief as they live again in our words.  Our children walk in our footsteps.  And we need to tell them these things. Great job of re-enacting by the Minnesota National Guard and the many others who brought this to us.",1464739200,,661,4.377049180327869

5059313,4,B00772M1D8,"by utilizing the Minnesota National Guard, it shows that Guardsmen now face the same deployment challenges as the Active Duty Soldier, are no longer seen as the weekend party Soldier, and it provided proper terms and movements for the movie. The reflection on the grandfather's leadership style as a PL in WW2, and his grandson taking the role as a leader of his own squad in OIF show a strong bond and relationship between the two. It is a good movie specifically to play or rent on Memorial Day every year. It shows the challenges combat leaders have when making tough decisions as well.",1464739200,,589,4.673076923076923

5059315,4,B00772M1D8,"I don't normally watch military or war type movies, but this was surprisingly good. I think that's mostly because it's not really about war as the main story plot, but more about the memories and storytelling. The acting was solid as well. So even if you normally prefer action or superhero movies, give this one a chance and you might be pleasantly surprised as well.",1464566400,,368,4.676923076923077

Three stories in one outline wars, memories and love leaving one to understand all conflicts are the same: big and important national goals, individual lives that matter that are lost in the pursuit. Taking place from the stage of a farm house porch in LeCenter, Minnesota, one feels the lives of the old, young and soon to be grown. As the movie ends, the grandfather [whose ""name"" I won't reveal here] says he loves stories by birds . . . because they sing them.

5059364,5,B00772M1D8,"I was completely blindsided by how good this movie is. I've suggested (forced) that some close friends and family to watch this, and everyone who has seen it shares my sentiment. People that have military experience have said it is very accurate (ok, my brother who was in the infantry reserve).

It was recommended by Amazon because I had watched another miltary-related video. I was skeptical but thought I'd give it try.

Since then I've watched part or all of the movie 30 or 40 times.

There is so much going on in this movie that the more you see it, the more it sinks in. (Opa/Oma, birds/Vogel, etc. Watch the movie and you will know ;-)

Kyle: ""It's Memorial Day....""

Opa: ""Damn straight....""

Kyle:  ""So what am I supposed to remember?""

Opa: (sigh....)

I don't say this often, but trust me....find and watch this movie.",1432252800,,831,4.636986301369863

Very poignant and moving story of two war heroes separated by two generations. It nearly brought me to tears in a couple of places. The Cromwells were both brilliant and convincing. War violence but nothing like Saving Private Ryan. This movie didn't need it. Probably safe to watch with teenagers or older.

to remember those things that are important, even when they are things that we might, from time to
time, wish we might forget.  In time, it seems, that those are the very ones that grow in importance.

I usually avoid war movies in particular--I get too emotional. But there are many veterans in my family, so I watched this. I seek to better understand the internal turmoil, but I've never wanted to pry. My take away is to look for the right moment to ask, to show that I want to listen, to share the burden they carry.

Although a minor scene, the movie seems to suggest that ""Bud"" and his son where less able to understand each other than Bud's grandson because of the emotional scars they carried within.

5059524,5,B00772M1D8,"I would recommend Memorial Day to every parent of a junior high student or older to watch together.  If you never had a father or grandfather involved in war, the movie gives you a sense of the impact on the lives of soldier at the time and soldiers afterward loving way. Our children and students need to about the lives lost of Americans fighting for the freedom we enjoy.

It does not glamorize war and has a few realistic depictions that make it a bit to graphic for elementary children but if you skipped just a couple short scenes it could even be viewed by them.  War is ""love one another"" lived out is a close special bond and the film portrays the grandfather in a series of flash backs to his war days and key events that impacted him--each of which he has a memento kept in a chest to help him remember the story.

I like that the grandfather has also lived a good life following war and has a loving wife caring for him as he seems to getting to the end of his life.  The father brings his son and daughter to spend what seems like the week or weekend with his parents (the grandparents depicted) so that a special knowledge is passed on to his children about life and war.  As parents, it is our responsibly to get out students linked with teachers who can teach the, something we can note.  Also, we need to encourage the bond between generations (grandfather and grandmother) to grandson  and granddaughter.

5059525,5,B00772M1D8,"A wonderful story ruined by a little girl. I'm sure I'll be deemed as evil for attacking a little girl, but she is a wretched actress and the director who accepted her flailing is just as much to blame. ""But she's just a little kid, leave her alone."" Yeah-yeah, I hear you enablers already.

The character, Ruthy Vogel, is a child that should cause all of us to cringe, regardless of ""how cute"" she may be to some  (OK, most) people. Her lines are harsh and wraith-like on the ears. Her character is completely unbelievable as a reckless, mindless little harpy-child under the roof of an otherwise disciplined house. Now I know what Barbara Boxer was like as a child. Doing damage and instantly playing the victim. Poor baby! What horrible parents she must have to allow her to be so mentally unstable -- especially when compared to the thoughtful, respectful, wise-beyond-his-age Kyle, her older brother. Before you brush me off as the greatest villain of all time, consider how quickly she tries to rat-out Kyle for not immediately returning the footlocker when told to do so by Oma. In sing-song, no less! Psychotic. From ""playing nicely together"" to ""spiteful betrayal of her own brother"" in less than a second. It's downright Clintonian. If you think this is normal, you're part of societies problem.

This is a vile child character that will be whining, lying, scheming and manipulating her way through life until the new legal term, ""Justifiable Domestic Violence"" is coined. She'll probably hire Gloria Allred for some phony sex crime before she's a teenager. She makes the modern Mattie Ross (from the Jeff Bridges' True Grit abomination, not the true woman playing in the John Wayne classic) look decent. But, that's the society we live in, accepting bad behavior and attacking the victim or the messenger. Otherwise the movie is outstanding!",1401321600,,1852,4.9105431309904155

5059529,3,B00772M1D8,"I found this film watchable and by moments even quite good - but ultimately I felt a little bit disappointed. Below, more of my impressions, with some very limited SPOILERS.

Sergeant Kyle Vogel (Jonathan Bennett) is a young American soldier who serves in Iraq with the 34th Infantry Division. Briefly hospitalised for a not very serious injury, he strikes up a conversation with the resident military psychiatrist, Lieutenant Kelly Tripp (Emily Fradenburgh). Even if he is of course aware that this conversation is neither entirely accidental nor completely casual he accepts to play the game and tells to the the inifinitely patient psychiatrist a story from his childhood, about the one and only day when his grandfather (James Cromwell) accepted to tell him some of his own service with 82nd Airborne Division in WWII. The film then mixes four  story lines: Kyle's service in Iraq, Kyle's conversation with Lt. Tripp, Kyle's conversation with his grandfather and the WWII stories his grandfather tells him...

This is a rather well done film, but it is not entirely succesfull. Quite a lot of what we hear and see is quite clichd and banal and ultimately seems... quite flat. War time adventures of both men are not very interesting - we saw ALL OF THIS like hundreds of times. In fact the really interesting parts of this film, those which I liked the best are the moments when we see the grandfather struggling with his progressing sickness and slowly overwhelming dementia, brief but clever exchanges between Kyle and Lt. Tripp and especially the very ending which is a kind of post-scriptum of the whole story...

In war time fragments only some elements were really good and original, like a brief scene in which we can see in April 1945 a veteran Waffen SS officer fighting against the Americans side by side with his young son who can't be older that 14... There is also one soldier in Kyle's squad who is a really peculiar and highly entertaining fellow. Fighting scenes are not really good and there is few of them anyway - I admit however that there is one scene of a suicide bomber attack in Iraq which is very honest indeed... Finally, there is a grand total of three good one-liners - not enough to carry the film, but still it is better than in many recent works...

The most precious thing in this film is its respectful and grateful tone, as ""Memorial Day"" was clearly made as a tribute to all US soldiers who since 1941 served their country and fought bravely, risking loss of life or limb against really horrible regimes and cruel foes... It is also a respectful salute to those last people from the Great Generation who are still with us, but who unavoidably wage their last fight even now, as those words are written - and this one can not be won...

Bottom line, this is a honest film, but nor really great. I liked it but I don't think I will keep the DVD. Advised to rent rather than buy.",1400803200,,2915,4.6725146198830405

Obviously a great deal of time, effort and energy went into every aspect of this, from the attention to detail to the actual experiences and the plausibility of it all.

This is what it's like.  Then and now.  The acting was right on, even to the portrayal of the migraines (Which I, too, used to have, though ibuprofen didn't do a damned thing for them) to the loneliness of leadership to the feeling of loss to those who go up to the edge... but not quite over it.

A brilliant effort, a brilliant portrayal.

5059564,3,B00772M1D8,"An infantry veteran myself, I deeply appreciate what the filmmakers were attempting to achieve with this film; however, the modest budget showed itself throughout--again, not a criticism of itself: I understand not every meaningful war movie can have a 'Saving Private Ryan' budget. Not every movie can (or should be) a multi-million dollar blockbuster extravaganza. That said, the script--specifically the dialogue--was painfully flawed and the direction and cinematography were mediocre, at best.  I can't fault the actors, particularly James Cromwell, who--to me anyway--seemed to be doing the best he could with what he had.

So yes, I recommend this movie so that studios will see there is a market for films like this and allow the possibility that other, hopefully better movies like it will be made.",1394409600,,807,5.346456692913386

For those who choose to view 'Memorial Day,'  perhaps what you find within this story  will depend on your own experiences. Some may remember the stories they were told by a parent or spouse. WWII held so much for those who fought . . . decisions made, another few steps toward or away from death. The horror of combat and the loss of friends is not an easy thing to contemplate.  One can't but wonder that they could maintain any sense of emotional stability. Listen carefully, the stories are subtle and poignant . . . not easily told nor forgotten. The curiosity and persistence of a child who wants to know  these stories and the conflicts to be found within the answers may not be a storyline that everyone can appreciate. Recommended for those who may or may not have memories of their own. A student of military history, Army Brat and then an Army wife, for me this is an example of a lifetime. From one generation to another there is an understanding and the bond of memories!

Passing WWII experiences to a young boy who see those experiences in his leadership of men. The setting was peaceful but the message is clear that Memorial Day to many veterans is not a day of fun and hot dogs, it's that one more than any other day when the pain of loss overwhelms them inside. Many hide it and smile but if we could rip them open and look inside, we would be beside ourselves as why we have not to this day paid the respect that all veterans are owed after seeing what they lived through to be here today.

Godspeed to all that served and continue to serve our great nation. My heart and my soul is indeted to you.

James Cromwell is one of my favorite actors and really carries this film. It is a generational look at what it means to go to battle and reminds those who have not had the opportunity to serve, that only the ones who experience conflict truely understand. I have only one negitive observation and I hesitate to mention it but if there is any short coming it is in the supporting cast and dialog.

There is so much underlying reality to the plot and emotions the Characters in this movie portray. Having experience over the years with the real haunting horror of wars, mental trauma, and the lasting effects of some peoples horrible memories, is brought out in subtle but realistic way. I found myself taken in as if I was actually watching the lives of true combat veterans, and knowing the people personally. There is a full story beyond war. The movie also brings the reality of life coming full circle, love of family, Country, and the hopes of a future that has been paid for by the few.

Aside from the Cromwells, the acting is miserably bad. The storyline is more predictable than a Mighty Mouse cartoon and the entire ""interplay"" between the nurse and patient is acted so badly it not only *feels* contrived, it almost comes off as being read from cue cards.

Fortunately, I like James Cromwell, and just enough to sit through this travesty to enjoy his performance. Unfortunately, I had to grind through Jonathan Bennett and that nurse. He should stick to the lightweight-movie roles for which he's ""known"".

This movie almost set a record for the number of times I looked at my watch. Everyone touting this movie makes claims for heart-felt this and that... BS. Without James Cromwell, I'd wager most of the audience would vanish... Bennett scenes ground time to a crawl. The most touching scene had nothing to do with the scars of war and memories of military service, nor anything related to the movie title. That ""most touching"" scene was performed when Cromwell thanked his wife for his last lemonade--again, the emotional strength and impact of the big screen was only wielded by Cromwell's talent.

If you're suckered into watching this garbage despite having read these reviews, ask yourself one question while you're viewing the movie--""do I care what happens to this character?"" It'll tell you if you think there's any viable performance by the subject you're watching. I'll bet your answer is, ""no""... and if it is, skip the rest of the movie. Nothing happens that you didn't anticipate, and everything you'd predict comes to pass. There's a reason the IMDB rating for this movie was 5.6--I wish I'd seen their rating before renting this movie. Without the pre-29yr old female vote, the IMDB number would have been remarkably lower.

If you feel the need to watch a well-acted, or patriotic, or heart-felt, or handkerchief movie about how vets feel when they come home from war, do yourself a BIG favor--skip this and rent ""Coming Home"" or ""Born On the Fourth of July"".

It touches the soul and ties it in across the ages and generational boundaries are gone.

This was realistic, well written and superbly executed.  A true masterpiece and should have received so much more accolade than it did but then again, the silent hero is who we are all about.  If you want to feel pride and thanksgiving for the freedoms we have and enjoy, then see this film.  If you have family in the service or retired, this is for you.

It's not fundamentally an action movie, so don't watch if that's what you're looking for.

It doesn't have a lot of big names, so don't bother if that's what makes you love a movie.

It's not about looking for the worst in every American service member and then reveling in the muck, like the Valley of Elah and other films that have come out since 9/11.  Along that line, it's not an anti-war movie, though it's not a pro-war movie either.

Those with heightened aesthetic senses and a smug sense of elitism more suited to the Cannes Film Festival should move on.

For everyone else,the fundamental message is pretty simple.  War exists.  People are involved.  There are costs to be paid, and there are connections to be made.  In this movie the connections are made between comrades in arms and across generations. If you look there, you can look past the periods of stiff acting and the sometimes over-contrived dialogue.

Director: Samuel Fischer
Starring: Jonathan Bennett, James Cromwell, John Cromwell, Charles Hubbell, Emily Fradenburgh, Jackson Bond and Mary Kay Fortier-Spalding
Certification: 15
Runtime: 1hr 48mins
Cinema Release: 15 March 2013 (US, April 2012)

A really enjoyable War film, that brings home the meaning of how war affects us.

Memorial Day is a dual tale of War, starting with WWII veteran Bud Vogel (James Cromwell) who tells his grandson in flashback scenes about of the trials and tribulations of War. These flashback scenes feature Lt Bud Vogel played by John Cromwell the real life son of James - which adds to the realism of the tales.

Filmed in a similar style to `Saving Private Ryan', these action scenes are well made and scripted. Where for every item young Kyle takes from his grandfather's footlocker a tale begins. Move forward to Bud's grandson Kyle (Jonathan Bennett) now serving in the second Iraq war as Staff Sgt Kyle Vogel. Kyle is wounded from an IED, and while he recovers in hospital recalls the tales to his medical practitioner under duress. Where he realises he has similar war experiences to that of his grandfather.

This brought back a host of emotions, questions I wished I'd asked my grandparents, more, it brought forward my view of the honor due the many veterans who have served our nation.

The theme is fairly simple: there is honor and significant value to (at an appropriate time) take a challenging journey - into our memories and our past.  While there are things we want to forget - too often, these things define us, and are never really forgotten.

The conversations rendered in this film are honorable ... and encourage us to piece together a conversation we may YET have with the next generation.

Honored veterans, if you watch this, beware that it will open a portal to your experiences, if you're not ready, delay watching this one ... but don't discourage those around you.  I suspect it will be useful to all involved.",1364860800,,1038,4.701657458563536

The comparative stories between the two generations shows that the sacrifices are still on going and that freedom comes at a cost.,1364169600,,305,4.648148148148148
5059686,4,B00772M1D8,"This tells the story of Bud Vogel played by James Cromwell (`The Green Mile', L.A. Confidential' and `The Artist'). Bud has been trying to put the past memories of his time during WW 2 behind him, then on Memorial Day in 1993, his grandson Kyle finds his old footlocker and brings it to his Grandpa. At first he is none too pleased and when he tells Kyle to put it back, Kyle answers `but what am I supposed to remember?' So he decides to tell the story of some of the objects or souvenirs in the box.

We also have a the parallel story of Kyle after he has joined the US Army and is on a tour of duty in Iraq circa 2005, where he is recounting  his memories of that time to a lieutenant doctor. Both his life and the stories of his grandpa are told in flash back.

Military purists are going to find fault with the WW 2 depictions, especially as the budget did not stretch to a cast of thousands but the Iraq era action is actually very well done. This is not an action movie in any way at all so please avoid if that is what you are looking for. It is a touching tale of coming to terms with the past and with things you may not necessarily be at all proud of.

It is very moving in places and really well acted Jonathan Bennett (`The Dukes of Hazard' movie) as Kyle is both convincing and engaging and James Cromwell is always good. The young Bud is played by John Cromwell who must be related as they look so like each other. As I said there are a few plot stretchers too especially in the WW2 bits but all in all a very satisfying film about loss, life, love and being human  in a war situation and it was a really rewarding watch - recommended.",1364169600,,1650,4.095975232198143

If on the other hand you are a Veteran or keep one close to your heart, the film will touch you in ways that will open doors to understanding the memories and thoughts many of us keep buried and locked away.  Unfortunately buried memories are never far from vivid recall.  The walls we build around them we mistakenly believe are invisible are quite visible to others, though they may not understand why they are there.  Movies like ""Memorial Day"" remind us that we occassionally must open the vault door to those memories so we can deal with both the pain and the behavioral influence of the experience with the help of others.  It is in this area the film is wonderfully brilliant, a catharsis for those living with the memories and experience of facing the constant stress and experience of instantaneous death, either your own or someone close to you.  Prior to watching Memorial Day there were two other films that I found cathartic; ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Brothers.""  ""Memorial Day"" just became the third.",1362441600,,1137,4.655

The story, script and acting were all excellent.  All in all, if you like military movies with heart, BUY this movie.",1359072000,,270,5.255813953488372
5059707,5,B00772M1D8,"I spent 23 years in the military during a time (Viet Nam) when the wider culture was definitely not disposed to endorsing that lifestyle.  This movie demonstrates that finally it is possible for our stories to be told without the false romanticism of the early days nor the hideous distortions of the Anti-war crowd.

When a military person talks about ""doing his job"" there is an entire layer of meaning that is included there that simply does not communicate very well outside the circle.  He/She is not talking about simply putting in time at the desk nor just earning a paycheck.  That person is talking about an entire focus of life and mission that integrates sense of country, sense of responsibility, sense of mutual dependence, sense of honor, sense of necessity that transcends ordinary vocation.  This is not to romanticize it nor to unduly glorify it.  It simply is what it has to be.  The well understood observation that when the bullets are flying that a soldier is not fighting for his country, he is fighting for his buddies, is true.  But the reason why he is fighting for them is because, fundamentally, they share that same set of sensibilities, each to a greater or lesser extent and each in different proportions.  Life is clarified greatly when your immediate actions and those of your brothers in arms constitute issues of life and death.  The simultaneously liberating and depressing reality that death is only one bullet away at any given instant and that there really is no such thing as a ""safe area"" breeds a certain callousness as well as intense awareness of each moment.  There is the story of the soldier crossing Flanders field in World War I, in the midst of mind boggling carnage, suddenly being intensely aware of a single tree still standing and beautifully shrouded in fog.  Life is real when your business is death.

This of course does not mean, necessarily, that this intensity of experience is always conducive to mental stability.  There are those of us in whom sensory over-load simply is intolerable and the danger of foundational collapse is a real possibility.  That challenge is always present and as this movie shows, each person responds to it in their own unique manner.

I have seen few movies which rivets the audiences attention to the military experience as well as this one.  There are no rose colored glasses here but neither are honor and duty held in contempt.  The central character hates the statement ""it is what it is"" but in the last analysis, that is the message that the story communicates.  The connection between the grandson and the grandfather is far more than common military experience but it cannot be separated from it.  Their stories are different but fundamentally the same.  As the grandfather says... ""you cannot choose your war... you have to just go and do the best job you can.""  That statement communicates the fundamental integrity and prevailing moral virtue of military service.  A price has to be paid... but the whole point is that is a price that must be paid.  Not everyone is called to it and not everyone can do it... and that also is just how it is.  But for those who do and for those whose integrity is proven in it, there is a transcendent bond that is established among them that is as important as life itself.  It simple is the way it is.

What is possible to achieve is exactly what this movie portrays as being achieved, both by the grandfather and his grandson.  The respect and appreciation of superiors and inferiors alike, when the man they want to fight with is the man that is there with them.  Grandfather and grandson both walked the walk and their reward was not a grand parade and a bunch of medals.  Their reward was the look in their fellow soldiers' eyes when tough decisions had to be made.

Some will say that such is not worth it... they are the ones who don't know what it means to ""do their job.""

This is a great movie and it is well worth watching.",1358899200,,3969,4.666187050359712

Life is cyclic and it is experience shared that guides us in times of pure insanity.

I was very pleasantly surprised with this film.  Battle scenes have a real feel of authenticity to them, but they seemed to miss the mark on getting the weapons and firing audio better mixed.  It sounded way to low in volume compared to the rest of the movie.

I very muchly liked the way they cast John and James Cromwell (the grandson plays the youthful James)..

It's also one that makes it ok for a guy to have a tear come up.  Well... one tear only... and 1 one eye only.  :)

This film was a huge exception. It was so bad, it's almost hard to know where to begin. The acting was CRINGE-INDUCINGLY BAD. I mean terri-bad. Slap-yo-mama for bringing you into the world bad. And it's like a virus that spreads to each new character that is introduced on screen. And it just gets worse. And worse . . . and worse.

The action scenes are amateurish. Period.

In one scene, some wounded Waffen-SS soldiers are briefly interrogated by some members of the grandfather's unit. The language that the ""German"" soldiers speak is so transparently bad, spoken with American accents so thick you need a frigging machete to even make a dent in them. The actors - probably culled from the neighborhood homeless shelter, looking for an easy buck - pronounce German like old people play Twister: slow and sloppy. They couldn't even be bothered to get the grammar right. It was like listening to Rush Limbaugh trying to speak Spanish: even if you don't happen to know Spanish at all, you know at a visceral, almost primordial level that something is seriously, seriously wrong. Like a virgin going down on Courtney Love.

The melodrama. Oh my God. Every trite image you can think of. A white house with an American flag and the grandfather on the porch drinking lemonade and eating cookies that grandma made? Really? While the grandchildren run up to him like a bunch of Hitler Youth, standing in formation, saluting and reciting the ""general orders"" grandpa had just given them? Ugh.

One lady who saw this movie said it made her cry. This flick almost made me cry, too, when I thought about how someone took the time and effort to make a movie this forgettable.",1354406400,2,1895,4.7303030303030305

I couldn't help but be whisked back in time to those priceless experiences that only he and I shared, and I felt completely in-sync with the grandson following in his grandfather's footsteps, because I did the same.

I've never served although I spent many a sleepless night during the year my youngest was in Afghanistan. Governments are screwed up and most wars are truly fought for the wrong reasons, however this should never diminish the respect and care we give to our veterans and active troops.

The problem here is the acting.  James and John Cromwell (who I now know to be father and son) are a delight, and James Cromwell delivers (as always).  Aside from these two, the only other well-acted part in the film was played by the woman who was Cromwell's wife in the film (the grandmother).

The rest of the acting sounded like it was being read, and the relationship between the LT and the SGT in the SGT is completely unbelievable.  No war-time medic/nurse/doctor can spend all day trying to pry open the closed clamshell that is her wounded soldier.  The fact that she was so pushy (and such a poor actress) really made me struggle through much of the film.

5059748,5,B00772M1D8,"I picked up this movie on a friend's recommendation, surprised to find it was filmed here in my home state of Minnesota. I have to say, it was one of best movies about soldiers and war that I've seen.

I've always been interested in ""what happens after."" After the bullets fly, after the IED explodes, after the soldier leaves the war. How does what they experience impact their relationships with spouse, children, family... and themselves? These are the things I explore in much of my writing (especially as pertains to wounded veterans and PTSD).

This movie has it in spades.

I've tried writing a novel with flashbacks. It's hard to do well. Same with a movie. I have never seen a movie able to move from present to past the way Memorial Day does. And does it to great effect!

In the opening scene, we watch the main character (Kyle) get injured in the line of duty. On his last night in recovery an officer/doctor persuades him to talk about his past.

That past is a story of himself as a 13-year-old. He finds his grandfather's old locker and confronts him with it. His grandfather, who fought in WWII, agrees to tell Kyle the story behind three (and only three) items from the locker. In the process, we get three poignant stories in flashbacks, juxtaposed with Kyle's tight, reined-in emotional delivery.

We go ""forward"" to see Kyle having parallel experiences in Iraq. Different war, similar experiences. And because of his grandfather's stories, Kyle has a wisdom about him... an ability to hold onto compassion and learn to live with his decisions a lot earlier in life than his grandfather did.

I've seen some reviews that mentioned the acting. I personally thought the actors did a great job. It's almost easier to shoot an action scene than to show the kind of emotion these characters do.

I served proudly with Delta Co. 2nd Bat 8th Cav Rgt Abn 1st Air Cavalry Division in Vietnam in 68/69.  I was wounded for my third and final time on Jan 28th 1969 and spent two years recovering at Walson Army Hospital at Ft. Dix, NJ.  I was like I came full circle, Ft. Dix is where I started and it's where I ended upon my discharge date which was also my release date from the hospital.  I was very emotionally connected to this movie since every male in my family served in a war or the service at one time.  That includes my namesake Uncle Nick who was killed in Germany and who is buried in Holland.  My dad who was with the 440th Combat Engieneers and Uncle Nick was with Patton in the 2nd Armour Div as Armored Infantry and like me was also an Infantry Sergeant.  Dad and Uncle Nick spent leave time together for the last time just before D-Day in England and then both headed off to France.  I am so glad that a bunch of Americans have adotped my Uncle's burial plot and have paid for the maintainance and upkeep of it and have posted it on the internet.  I found it there accidentially one day and all his military info.  The only things I have to remind me of him is a last photo of he and my dad in England and a photo of his white cross that my dad took after the German's surrendered.  I tried many times to talk to my dad about his combat time but he never would open up about it or even any of his military time. He was a great dad and I loved my parents dearly but they are both gone now.  The only time he taled to me about it was when I got back from Vietnam and then he pulled out an old dufflebag and pulled out his uniforms and WWII awards, that was the first and only times that we ever talked about it.

Grandson becomes insistent that his Grand father tell him some stories of items that were in Grand Fathers foot locker.

This is an entertaining movie that helps you understand the costs and the benefits of being a family with a member in the Armed Forces.  It does this in an entertaining way, so it is not a war movie, it is a people movie that tells a war story.

The closeness between the grandfather and his grandson was also touching and special. I am lucky to be very close to the only grandchild I have, a boy of 5 1/2. We have, since his birth, had a special relationship that continues to grow each day. I too have things to share with him someday.

Sometimes fathers, because of their role and lack of experience/wisdom, cannot share with their son, daughter, or other family members. With the years comes a realization of the memories tucked away which those ""souvenirs"" represent. This film helped in my confirmation of that.

I recommend this film to all Vet's and their families, and everyone else. I hope I have/will not be the only veteran/grandfather that is touched in this way. I also hope that it helps all who view it to share, respect, and understand those ""things"" that may never be spoken of by the veteran.

5059789,5,B00772M1D8,"I get a little uncomfortable when they say that our military are sent to fight for our freedoms, whatever that means. So, when I first read this film's title -- ""Memorial Day"" --, I immediately thought that this was going to be one of these silly patriotic movies with no redeeming values - a brainwashing, propaganda experience, if you will. But how mistaken I was! ""Memorial Day"" is a very smart, touching and honest film about love and family, and how the military experience affect or lives.

The movie basically opens on Le Center, Minnesota, on Memorial Day, 1993. It is a hot, beautiful day, and we find Bud Vogel (James Cromwell), seating in the porch of his home, keeping an eye on his grandchildren, who were playing outside. At one point in time, the children are playing hide and seek, and young Kyle Vogel, one of Bud's grandsons, finds a trunk inside a barn house. He opens it, and discovers old memorabilia from his grandfather's military service during World War II. He is curious and, against his grandmother Betty's (Mary Kay Fortier-Spalding) advice, takes the trunk to his grandfather. Betty believes that showing it to Bud will bring bad memories. Initially, Bud is aggravated, but he consents to talk about the stuff inside the trunk with Kyle. However, as to not expand his grief, Bud only agrees to talk about three items. Kyle agrees, and proceeds to select the items, with Bud telling him stories about each one. For this purpose, we are taken to the war itself, when young Bud (then Lieutenant Bud Vogel, played by John Cromwell) was guiding his troops in Holland, Belgium and Germany. At the same time, we are transported to Iraq, in 2001, and we see SSGT Kyle Vogel (Jonathan Bennett) commanding his troops in war. He gets wounded, and ends up in a military hospital, were he talks to Dr. Kelly Tripp (Emily Fradenburgh) about that special Memorial Day on 1993.

Directed by Sam Fischer, ""Memorial Day"" is truly an unforgettable experience, and I am very happy to have watched it. It is not patronizing and it doesn't take political sides. It goes right to your heart, and it makes you appreciate life more. You will learn, too, as Bud tells Kyle, that ""we are different from other animals because we can do one thing they can't: we can kill at a distance."" And I have to say that I never get tired of watching James Cromwell acting - he has great presence. I also enjoyed Mary Kay Fortier-Spalding; she was very tender and understanding of her husband. Great movie. The Blu-ray includes audio commentary by Fischer, John Cromwell, and writer Marc Conklin, as well as a making-of feature. (USA, 2011, color, 104 min plus additional materials)

5059790,4,B00772M1D8,"The only thing missing from the ""Memorial Day"" is the a linkage with ""Hallmark Movie Classics"" as this movie is something I would expect to see on a Sunday night at home with the family around the TV.  In my opinion, a network should pick this up as our troops are returning home, and our veterans from previous wars and conflicts could benefit from its message.

This movie hints at realism because it does in fact utilize members of the Minnesota Red Bulls.  I first became aware of the movie because the Priest (Father Echert) in the Easter Sunday scene is actually a real priest, and a Chaplain with the Air Force no less.  I can envision him making sure everyone was prudent on their Latin before filming the scene and giving ""the look"".  With so many troops returning home, this movie captures fully the rounded life of many soldiers coming home from battle and the family ties including telling the stories especially to those who ""get it"".  I never quite grasped this fully in my younger years when a teacher brought his old slides from Vietnam into class one day this movie provided an insight into all that he shared with us that day.

5059796,3,B00772M1D8,"The worst part of movies dealing with war or soldiers during a specific time period is that they often feel like recruitment videos. Either that or they shove patriotism down your throat. ""Memorial Day"" isn't like that at all, which is a relief. What really balances out the entire movie is the time Kyle spends with his grandfather. James Cromwell's heartfelt performance is really fantastic. His emotion gives much needed heart to a story like this. The thing about grandfathers is that they're supposed to always have a story to tell and have words of wisdom. Bud is the epitome of that, but he waits to reveal that until somebody makes him talk.

The time Kyle and Bud spend together inspires Kyle to start a collection of his own once he becomes a soldier as an adult and has a family of his own. This is the other big intriguing aspect of the war drama. Seeing Kyle collect things throughout the movie only makes you realize what he's eventually going to tell his son one day, which is kind of heartwarming. The last five minutes of the movie are also its bread and butter. It's as if the entire movie was written to give those few scenes more impact and it works so well. It's just a series of really passionate performances along with perhaps the most memorable scene to take place on that porch in the entire movie.

Many of the other performances feel uninspired. Maybe it's just the way Hollywood writes soldiers, but most of them are pretty forgettable here other than Kyle. John Cromwell is pretty exceptional in his full length feature film debut though. Everyone else outside of the main cast just feels like filler. Ho-hum is an acceptable way to describe the majority of the movie as things like the score, battlefield sequences, and lines of dialogue will be a distant memory at best. Although roaming shots of the countryside are extremely colorful on the Blu-ray edition of the movie.

""Memorial Day"" is mostly watchable thanks to the performances of John and James Cromwell. The story does its best to reel you in and feel for these characters, but may feel like it's stringing you along with no pay off in sight at times. There are certainly worse war related movies you could spend your hard earned money on.

Special features include Audio Commentary with Director Sam Fischer, Writer Marc Conklin, and Actor John Cromwell and a less than two minute Behind the Scenes featurette.

""Memorial Day"" is being released as a single disc DVD and a single disc Blu-ray starting tomorrow, May 29. The movie is not rated, is presented in 1.85:1 widescreen aspect ratio in 1080p High-Definition and DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and Dolby Digital 5.1 audio. It is approximately 104 minutes in length.

The film was shot completely in Minnesota, the snow is real snow, the planes are real planes, and the message is really moving. My grandfather never told his stories, I don't know how he got his purple heart or his bronze star.  I hope that the people that see this movie are moved to tell the stories of their experiences, not just in war but in life.  When we learn from our past we are welcoming a better future.

I think that combat veterans should share their experiences in order to help others understand the sacrifices made in order to defend our country. While this is a very serious subject matter there was enough comic relief in order to lighten the mood. There were some discrepancies in the movie from the way the real Army operates, but not so much so that it detracted from the message they were trying to get across. Also, I had the chance to meet the producer, director, and John Cromwell all were very nice and easy to talk to.

While Kyle Vogel (Bennett) is at a hospital recovering from a wound he got in war his nurse begins to ask him about his life. He decides to tell her about a talk he had with his grandfather (Cromwell) when he was 13. This is another movie that I thought could have been either really good or really boring. I wasn't sure how a movie about a grandfather telling his grandson about war artifacts could be any good. After twenty minutes I was absolutely hooked. I really connected with this movie on a personal level as my grandpa was also a vet and always wanted to ask him about what he went through. I only heard one story and after hearing it I never asked again. That aside, this is one great movie that deserves to be watched. The acting buy Cromwell is Oscar caliber and he deserves to be nominated for this, but like most low budget movies it gets glossed over because of the budget. Which isn't fair at all. I highly recommend this movie and is in my top 10 of movies released this year. Overall, a must see movie that will leave you choked up at the end.

5059803,4,B00772M1D8,"By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MS

Memorial Day can be a difficult holiday to explain. It's beginnings came after the American Civil War to commemorate the fallen Union soldiers of the Civil War. Southern ladies also decorated Confederate graves in Richmond and other important Civil War cities.
Today, the holiday encompasses all wars.
The film Memorial Day brings the holiday to vivid life when 13-year-old Kyle discovers his grandfather's trunk while playing hide-and-seek. At first the grandfather, Bud, (James Cromwell) tells the youngster to put it back. But eventually decides to make a puzzle out of the trunk and the holiday. He tells Kyle to pick any three items out of the box and he'll tell the story behind the souvenir.
The film also flashes forward to show Kyle, now a soldier himself, in the Iraq war, injured and being questioned by a nurse about his own experiences.
Bud, a WWII soldier, shares decisions he made, some good, some bad -- but emphasized you just got to make them and live with them. Clearly as he remembers we realize what a difficult task it is to choose these verdicts.
Years later Kyle will remember his grandfather's choices, and find he can make his determinations a little more informed. He also comes to understand war is war.
Many times veterans have a hard time talking about their experiences. I think Memorial Day would certainly be a good starting point. The tagline for the DVD say a lot -- Two generations. Two wars. One story.",1337126400,,1496,4.84375

The heart of the movie is about families and relationships - those that are built by both blood ties and the bond that comes from serving side by side during war times.  This being the case, the emotion ran high.  From my seat in the back row, I saw lots of eyes being dried by napkins during some of the key scenes.
