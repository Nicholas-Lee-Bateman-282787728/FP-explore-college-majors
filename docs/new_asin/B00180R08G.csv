8268121,1,B00180R08G,"If you're interested in Wing Chun, stay away from William Cheung, his products, and his affiliated schools.

The system he teaches has some basic WC in it, but other than the most basic form (Siu Lim Tao), it's not Wing Chun - it's a bunch of stuff he made up himself.

He's yet another Ashida Kim or Frank Dux...one of those guys who had some basic training and then makes up a bunch of stuff and sells it as a ""secret, ancient deadly style"".

Don't reward that sort of behavior by lining his pocketbook.

If you want some stuff on Wing Chun, look up Wong Shun Leung, Wayne Belonoha, Ip Ching, David Peterson, or Gary Lam...there's lots of good books, videos, and schools out there.

Or, if you do want a modern system with some basic Wing Chun in it, just go to Jeet Kune Do.

But if the instructor makes any sort of claim to ""secret knowledge that only HE was taught"", then stay as far away as you can.",1325462400,3,905,4.2631578947368425
