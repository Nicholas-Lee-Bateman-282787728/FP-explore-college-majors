8249702,4,B0013B34WG,"After being betrayed by the government, Japan is under attack by the greedy and powerful. They will steal the life from the nation and take it for their amusement. Apparently, Saiga is the only one that can stop them. He must defeat Suitengu to save the country. The funny thing is, with the country at stake, he's doing it to save the freedom of one young girl. This is a shocking and dramatic conclusion. Don't miss it!

This anime starts off with a bang. It's a constant thrill ride with some cool characters that have alarming special powers. The animation, voice acting, soundtrack, and plot are all very well done. This anime is very strange. The premise is very original and kinda takes you by surprise. If you've seen Eyes Wide Shut, you can kind of get a feel for the type of vibe this show has. It's not as perverted as Eyes Wide Shut, and this is mainly an action series,but the mood is very similar. I really enjoyed it and recommend it to anime fans that don't mind a little weirdness sprinkled in with their anime.",1355011200,2,1028,4.468085106382978
