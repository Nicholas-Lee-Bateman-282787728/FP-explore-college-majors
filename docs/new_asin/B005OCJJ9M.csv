4852090,5,B005OCJJ9M,"52 minutes long, almost perfect for a highschool class period.  These events are all fair game on the AP Environmental Science test and all are related to pollution (30% of the test).  I really enjoyed the use of archival footage.  Much of it I hadn't seen before.  It's a quick way to familiarize students with these events.",1424995200,3,325,4.649122807017544

4852094,5,B005OCJJ9M,I am going to show this the first week of AP Environmental Science to give the kids an introductory look at Environmental Science.  I will probably show it during the ecology unit in biology too.,1374624000,4,195,4.571428571428571
4852095,4,B005OCJJ9M,"Students Liked How It Showed The Outcomes Of The Disaters.  However, sometimes It Seem Long And Drawn Out.

8481164,4,B005OCJJ9M,"Good video, good commentary rom the time these events occurred. I wish they were clearer about what event they're discussing. They go from one event to the next without any headings or title screens.",1442102400,,199,4.882352941176471
8481165,4,B005OCJJ9M,The video content was excellent the problem was the volume was low and difficult for students to hear in a full classroom.,1441670400,,122,4.590909090909091
8481166,2,B005OCJJ9M,Very dry. This is an interesting topic but the documentary is boring. I would not show this video to any student below the age of 20.,1438300800,,133,4.153846153846154

8481169,3,B005OCJJ9M,"I though the program was a bit outdated and confusing.  My expectations were higher.  When I finished watching it, I wasn't really sure what the 10 disasters actually were, and I'm not so sure that the program actually covered 10 disasters.  Anyway, I expected a program entitled ""The Rise of Ecology"" to at least pay some tribute to the contribution of Rachel Carson and ""Silent Spring"" to the science of ecology.  Succinctly, I was disappointed.",1425600000,2,447,4.92
