1846960,4,B00008HCA4,"I bought the WWE Rey Mysterio DVD yesterday. I have to say it was very well put together. Sure it's a little soon for a DVD, but they managed to but some excellent matches on there as part of the extras. The good thing is for hardcore WWE fans they left off matches we would already have especially from PPV's. They have some of his best WCW matches, and a lot of his stuff from Smackdown. There is even a match from 1994 back when he was in AAA IWC. The 1 hour story they do on him is one of the best and really goes into where Rey grew up and explains the history of lucha libre and ""the mask"". He visits his old neighborhood, there are interviews with his parents, and look at his home and other WWE superstars that talk about Rey and his influence on the sport and how he works with Heaveyweights. I was very pleased. Great comp for any fan of Rey Misterio. I was pleased to see the Rey Mysterio vs. Eddie Guerrero from Halloween Havoc 1997. It was a gem.

1846963,5,B00008HCA4,"Rey Mysterio Jr is one of the best high-flyers in the wrestling world today. He was in the original 4-man line-up of The Filthy Animals, and is one of the most recognizable athletes in professional wrestling.
Rey started out as a wrestler at the age of 16 in Mexico under the name 'Colibri'. This was after only two years of training by his uncle, Rey Mysterio. After wrestling independent shows in California, and after his success south of the border, his uncle persuaded him to change his ring name to 'Rey Mysterio Jr'.
They began tagging together drawing much fan support and after Rey Mysterio jumped ship to the AAA, Jr. went along with him.
Many stories have been told that Rey used to do his Math Homework in the locker room before matches, but he soon left High School in the 11th grade to become a full-time wrestler.
He soon found his ideal opponent: Juventud Guerrera. The two had many memorable matches, and both Rey Mysterio and Fuerza Guerrera(Juvi's father) became involved in the fued. He also fought Psychosis to many classic matches. They claim to have wrestled eachother over 150 times.
Jr soon found major fan support abroad as he wrestled briefly in Japan and then had a short stint with ECW. Then WCW gave him a call.
The US fans were amazed at Rey's high flying talent and good mat skills. The match which is thought to establish him as a star was his win over Psychosis at Bash at the Beach 1996. Mysterio reversed a Splash Mountain into a hurricanrana of the top-rope to seal the win in the opening bout of the card. This was the same night in which the nWo formed.
He went on to have famous clashes with Jushin 'Thunder' Liger and Eddy Guerrero, the last of which was when Guerrero pinned Rey at Halloween Havoc '98. As a result of this, Jr was forced to join the LWO. At first he was a reluctant member of the group, not happy with their evil ways and cheating during matches. But when the rest of the faction took the money from Ric Flair to stop the madness, Rey suprisingly kept on his shirt.
When the nWo Wolfpac reformed, they went on a mission to destroy any other organisations. With Rey the sole member left, he refused to take off the LWO shirt, and Konnan defended him for it. As a result. 'K-Dogg' was booted from the Wolfpac.
This led to a tag-team match against Kevin Nash and Lex Luger at Superbrawl '99, where the stipulation was Rey's mask against Miss Elizabeth's hair. After interference, Rey and Konnan went down to a loss and Mysterio was forced to unmask. This perhaps was blessing in disguise, as it only earned him more popularity.
Rey wanted revenge on Nash, and he pinned him cleanly in the middle of the ring on NITRO the day after Superbrawl. He then went on a winning streak, defeating Super-Heavyweights Scott Norton and Bam Bam Bigelow in consecutive weeks. When Nash and Rey met again at Uncensored, 'The Giant Killer' was on the verge of victory, until Lex Luger interfered and Nash got the win.
After this, he started tagging with Kidman, and they won the Tag Team Championship after fueding with Dean Malenko/Chris Benoit and Raven/Perry Saturn. Rey then went on to capture the World Cruiserweight Title for a record fifth time.
Rey then joined the ultimately unsuccessful No Limit Soldiers group with Konnan, but when it collapsed, he formed The Filthy Animals along with Konnan, Kidman and long-time enemy Eddy Guerrero.
After fueding with The Revolution, he was sidelined with a knee injury. After returning when Vince Russo and Eric Bischoff came to power in WCW, he had a brief stay in the New Blood faction with the rest of the Animals, and soon it was revealed that Tygress was his girlfriend.
The Filthy Animals soon turned face again, and have more popularity than ever.
After some absents Mysterio came back but this time in the WWE and got a shot at the Cruiserweight championship at Wrestlemania XIX against Matt Hardy.

1846966,2,B00008HCA4,"Rey Mysterio is an amazing athlete to behold.  His ECW days are the stuff of legend, his feud with Psicosis so epic it spanned past ECW, starting even before then and producing some of the most memorable feats of athleticism in professional wrestling ever.

You get a sampling of this magic he makes in the ring with the bonus matches featured in extra in this DVD.

The documentary, meanwhile, barely covers much of importance.  It seems to want to stick close to kayfabe, with Mysterio acting all pissed off at Albert for breaking his leg with a steel chair.  We see Mysterio in the operating room, giving us a WWE version of ""Cribs"" by showing us his house and his son, getting a tattoo, and going down to Mexico to meet up with old friends and talk about his early days in Mexican wrestling and the AAA.

The documentary doesn't even mention ECW, so it just goes from Rey's childhood, with interviews from his parents in spanish, then tells of his AAA tenure, then suddenly jerking ahead to WCW and covering pretty much just his feud with Dean Malenko and his first match with the late Eddie Guerrero.  Then it jerks ahead to 2001 where WCW closes down, and Rey is left to wrestle in independent promotions until 2002 when he comes into WWE.

The WWE part of the documentary only covers his feud with Kurt Angle, his tag team with Edge, and a few others, including the incident with Albert breaking his leg.

We never see his face either, as it must be some undeclared Lucadore code or tradition to never reveal your face to your fans or something, so the camera is either below his shoulders, avoiding his face, or when his face can't be avoided, is blurred out.

All in all, this DVD feels very incomplete, and while Mysterio wasn't in ECW as long as in WCW, it's probably the most important step in his career leading up to WWE.  I hope the new one coming out this year has a more complete story.",1176163200,,1903,4.455331412103747
1846967,3,B00008HCA4,"NOTE: I updated this review in 2015

""It's not the size of the dog in the fight but the size of the fight in the dog"" is a phrase that perfectly describes Rey Mysterio as he's always had to overcome the odds in his career weather it was wrestling underage to the point where he had to be sneaked into some establishments just to wrestle & always being told he's ""too small"" and here's WWE's first attempt at telling his story here in ""Rey Mysterio: 619"".

The documentary itself covers his time growing up & training to become a wrestler including a visit to his old school training ground in Tajuana. His time in WCW is glossed over including his feud with Dean Malenko & the feud with Eddie Guerrero leading up to their classic at Halloween Havoc '97. The prestige of his mask is also talked upon before getting into his debut in WWE. The stories around his matches with Kurt Angle at SummerSlam '02 and his tag team partnership with Edge leading up to his WrestleMania 19 match with Matt Hardy close out the documentary itself. You also get a ""MTV Cribs"" view of Mysterio's house along with him getting a new tattoo out in San Diego are also shown.

Matches Include:
w/Latin Lover & Heavy Metal vs. Madonna's Boyfriend, Fuerza Guerrera, Psicosis - Before I get started, it should be noted that this was a PPV put on by the AAA promotion in Mexico but broadcast on PPV via WCW, this was also the national television debut of Rey Mysterio, you would recognize the wrestler known as Madonna's boyfriend as Louie Spicolli. This match was held under lucha libre rules where you had to enter tag your partner or go to the floor in order for another member of the team to be legal as you saw signs of the style the we would know Rey for as such as the head scissors takeover from various parts of the ring & various top rope maneuvers while another standout in this contest is Madonna's Boyfriend who showcased his power & strength advantage throughout the match such as easily shrugging off Mysterio & even tossing him into the front row at one point while everyone else showcased their high flying & even ground wrestling with submission attempts in a match full of non-stop action from bell to bell that definitely made a first impression for Mysterio.
WCW/AAA When Worlds Collide '94
[Rey Mysterio: Biggest Little Man]

vs. WCW Crusierweight Champion Dean Malenko - This was Mysterio's WCW debut that saw both men having stalemates early on with Malenko keeping Mysterio on the mat directly targeting his arm with strikes & stretches along with moves like a hammerlock slam & dropkick directly to the arm while using any part of the ring to his advantage as Rey showcased his fast paced high flying lucha style such as coming off the top rope or a springboard position taking Malenko off his feet & out of the ring on more than one occasion including causing him to have a cameraman as this was very competitive to the point where both men received a standing ovation from the crowd afterwards.
WCW Great American Bash '96
[Rey Mysterio: Biggest Little Man]

vs. Psychosis - Despite both men's history against each other throughout their careers that this was this first encounter against each other in WCW with Rey attempting to shake hands only for Psychosis slapping him as both men grounded each other early using different submission holds working different parts of the body before Psychosis was able to take control always staying a step ahead of Rey but also taking risk that ended up hurting him as well as both men took the action to the outside hitting the guardrail various times along with coming off the apron & top rope to the floor as they continued to trade momentum with different high flying moves from the top rope & springboard position as these two men gave a very strong impression for what was still one of their early matches in their WCW careers.
WCW Bash At The Beach '96

vs. WCW Crusierweight Champion Dean Malenko - Rey came out very fast paced using his lucha style such as various springboard moves catching Dean off guard before Dean was able to catch him to slowing down the pace delivering either some impactful offense in & outside of the ring including a gutbuster coming off the top rope or various submission moves as they traded momentum as it came down to one man's focus eventually working against him.
""WCW Monday Nitro"" July '96
[Rey Mysterio: Biggest Little Man]

vs. WCW Cruiserweight Champion Eddie Guerrero - This had a ""Title vs. Mask"" stipulation meaning that Rey had to win the championship or unmask while it should be noted that he was wearing an outfit representing to the comic book/movie ""The Phantom"" with his mask attached to the outfit. Rey came out with very fast paced offense from either a springboard position or off the top rope including an over the top crossbody that sent both men over the top rope only for Rey to hold on while Eddie hit the guardrail causing Eddie to pick up the intensity using the ringside steps & heavily focusing on Rey's back with various impactful moves such a multiple backbreakers or stretch submissions including his father's Gory Guerrero Special while also continuing to rip at the mask as they traded momentum with Rey doing some aerial offense including some new offense that he would go on record saying that he did once & never again after this match along with an early version of what we now know as the West Coast Pop while Eddie continued to deliver intense impactful moves like a snap powerbomb & top rope crucifix drop. This has the reputation of being the greatest crusierweight match in WCW history & it's hard to argue that point after viewing this match.
WCW Halloween Havoc '97
[Rey Mysterio: Biggest Little Man; Cheating Death, Stealing Life: The Eddie Guerrero Story; Wrestling's Highest Flyers; WCW's Greatest PPV Matches Vol. 1]

No Disqualification Match vs. WCW Crusierweight Champion Chris Jericho - This was originally scheduled to be Dean Malenko challenging Jericho for the title under this stipulation but due to Malenko violating a condition that he couldn't touch Jericho before the match, Jericho accepted defending the title against a replacement not knowing it was Mysterio.  Rey went right after Jericho with punches & chops followed by his lucha libre offense including one that went the ring post sending Jericho into the guardrail before Jericho focused on the leg he previously injured as both men took advantage of the stipulation briefly taking the match away from ringside to the set area & bringing a chair into the match while continuing to trade momentum using impactful moves such as top rope powerbomb as it came down to one man losing his focus for just a second allowing the other to take advantage.
WCW Bash At The Beach '98

vs. Chavo Guerrero - Rey's WWE debut as his showcased his trademark lucha libre offense such as the head scissors takeover & high flying coming over the top rope & from a springboard position while Chavo focused on grounding Rey and heavily focusing on a specific part of the body with various stretches & impactful offense such as a Gory Special & Gory Bomb while also being able to counter some of Mysterio's offense in what was not only a strong debut but also Chavo's best showing in WWE to that point as well.
""SmackDown"" July '02
[""Rey Mysterio: Biggest Little Man""]

vs. Kurt Angle - Angle kept attempting to show up Mysterio early on only for Rey to frustrate Angle by making him chase him around the ring & constantly catching him in moves that kept taking him down as they traded momentum with Kurt using a variety of suplexes including some that just released Rey making him fly across the ring while Rey used different high flying moves from various positions from over the top to even Angle throwing him but catching himself on the top rope to deliver a moonsault in what was a repeat of their SummerSlam match a month earlier in that it was fast paced non-stop action.
""SmackDown"" Sept. '02

vs. Kurt Angle & Chris Benoit - This took place in Mysterio's hometown of San Diego with all three men interacting with each other right from the start with one man using Rey as a weapon against his opponent as each man match played out with each man using the strategy of ""divide & conquer"" keeping one opponent out of the ring so he can focus completely on the other before all three men interacted with each other such as Rey backdropped over the top rope only to execute a seated senton on his other opponent on the outside & later one man executing a top rope maneuver while his other two opponents were in a submission as this came down to one man being able to isolate one man while catching the other.
""SmackDown"" Sept. '02

Other matches include a match against Jamie Noble from ""SmackDown"" in March '03 & other DVD extras include hidden video packages promoting Mysterio's WWE debut & Rey talking about his theme music.  It should be noted that all the WCW matches are shown from opening bell to closing bell so you don't see the entrances or anything post-match due to them not having the rights to the WCW music at that time.

There were many negatives when it came to the documentary portion of this set as it was done with a mix of reality & ""storyline"" such as they kept putting over A-Train for injuring Mysterio during a SmackDown match in Dec. 2002 throughout the presentation when reality is that Mysterio was out for only a month yet they put it over as it was a major injury like Austin's neck or Triple H's quad along with completely ignoring the fact that fans who watched WCW after 1999 have seen Mysterio without his mask yet WWE chose to re-write history and completely ignore it to the point where all parts where his face is blurred whenever he didn't have his mask on plus WWE didn't obtain the ECW footage yet so that time period of his career was completely ignored as well.  The extra matches heavily made up for the documentary here but the bottom line is that this DVD came out too quickly in Mysterio's WWE career and WWE since then has put out a 3 disc set featuring a majority of the the matches on here along with other DVD sets that included more footage & Rey giving more insight into the matches & his career than he did here so unless your a huge Mysterio fan & have to have everything associated with him, this is a release you can skip & get his other releases instead (Biggest Little Man; Life Of A Masked Man; Superstar Collection).",1158624000,18,10454,4.615384615384615
1846968,5,B00008HCA4,"The MAIN PART of the DVD goes for approximately 67 minutes. It begins with his WWE colleagues giving their opinions on Rey & we head straight into his injury angle with A-Train toward the end of 2002. Of course, this was a real knee injury that Rey already had & the purpose of screening this was to show Rey in hospital. This includes actual footage of his knee scope. We then go to Mexico where Rey's parents, friends & first promoter are spoken to. He takes us to the gym/ring he first trained on, and speaks generally about the differences of life in Mexico compared to the USA.

Rey then briefly reflects about his early years as a professional wrestler (his first match was at the age of 15), Konnan getting him into AAA & then WCW. This part is done way too quickly as we immediately see footage of Mysterio's WCW debut against Dean Malenko in June-'96, and his subsequent cruiserweight title win against the same opponent the following month. Next in detail is Rey's excellent feud with Eddie Guerrero, including their Halloween Havoc '97 match, which I'll talk more on later. That was a 'mask vs title' match, which leads Rey to speak about the importance of the mask to Mexican wrestlers such as himself.

But again, a huge jump is made. This time to WWE's purchase of WCW & the effect it had on Rey's career. Over a year later on July-25, 2002, Rey Mysterio made his WWE debut in a match against Chavo Guerrero. But before detailing his WWE career, we go for a tour through Rey's house. The man's got a whole home in his master bedroom alone!!! A look at his memorabilia room is also fascinating. But back to the WWE we go, as his great singles feud with Kurt Angle is highlighted (footage of their SummerSlam match is shown), as is his tag-team run with Edge, which finally resulted with a SmackDown title win in October over Benoit & Angle. Back to life, as we see Rey getting his 619 tattoo on his arm.

The remainder of the main part of the DVD highlights Rey's return from injury, his 2003 focus on the cruiserweight title (which he won after the DVD was released) & some more comments about him from his WWE colleagues. In conclusion, the main part of this DVD is like many others the WWE have already put out. It jumps all over the place & conveniently misses out huge portions of the superstars career (the WWE showed no footage of Rey's face at all. Sometimes it was blurred out). There was no Filthy Animals or losing his mask. It is still worth a watch, especially anything referring to Rey's personal life & the parts shot in Mexico. Luckily however, any negatives can be forgiven, as the strengths of this DVD were always going to be the extras, all 2 hours of them.

EXTRAS

with Heavy Metal & Latin Lover vs Psicosis, Fuerza Guerrera & Louie Spicoli. AAA When Worlds Collide. November 13, 1994: This was a fascinating 13 minute match from the Mexican promotion's pay-per-view. Not only do you get to see Rey wrestling at age 19, but also the popular 6 man style match commonly held in Mexico. Entertaining & Mysterio is a big part of it.

vs Dean Malenko. Great American Bash. June 16, 1996: Rey's WCW debut is an entertaining clash of styles. Malenko works on Rey's arm for practically the entire match. This psychological war is probably a little too slow-paced for most of it's 18 minute length, but it's still a decent enough debut. Unfortunately, you have to put up with Dusty Rhodes' commentary!!!

vs Psicosis. Bash At The Beach. July 7, 1996: This match took place on the night of Hulk Hogan's legendary NWO heel turn. Excellent 15 minute bout which really established Rey in WCW. A couple of excellent top rope to outside moves are included, while in the ring, there is enough of a mixture of fast-paced & submission moves to keep everyone satisfied. A terrific ending caps off a truly excellent match.

vs Dean Malenko. Nitro. July 8, 1996: Held outdoors in Orlando, this was far from a perfect match, but is a favorite of mine. It took place approximately when I was getting back into the world of professional wrestling & was the match that made me notice that the WWE had a genuine contender on it's hands in WCW. The bout is entertaining, exciting & unpredictable, as Rey wins his 1st cruiserweight title. I just love Malenko's top-rope gut-buster when he does it to Mysterio!!!

vs Eddie Guerrero. Halloween Havoc. October 26, 1997: Rey wins his 2nd cruiserweight title in this ""mask vs title"" match, which is as close to perfect as any fan could hope for. Top notch in so many ways; Heel to face interaction, pacing, psychology, mat-wrestling, aerial wrestling, intensity, excitement, entertainment & unpredictability. I could probably go on!!! In my opinion, one of the five best matches I have ever seen. If anything, at 14 minutes in length, it could have been 5 minutes longer. Then again, it could have been 2 hours longer for all I care!!!

NOTE: Anytime during this match, if you continue pressing ""skip to next track"", you should see many of the WWE's ""He's Coming"" promos before Rey's debut.

vs Chris Jericho. Bash At The Beach. July 13, 1998: Average 6 minute No Disqualification cruiserweight title match, where Rey was an impromptu opponent for Jericho. This was his return bout after months on the sidelines due to knee surgery. Sloppy & predictable, it took place in Rey's hometown of San Diego.

vs Chavo Guerrero. SmackDown. July 23, 2002: Very good & under-rated match which was Rey's WWE debut. Served it's purpose in exciting the crowd with a new performer on the roster very well, although it was a little short at under 7 minutes in length. Michael Cole & Tazz very much go over the top trying to sound educated about Rey's moves.

vs Kurt Angle. SmackDown. September 12, 2002: Very entertaining 9 minute bout. These two really work well together. This took place approximately 2 weeks after their initial SummerSlam match. Actually, I'm not sure why that wasn't the match included, as Rey lost both, and they were almost identical in length. This was still definitely good enough though.

vs Kurt Angle vs Chris Benoit. SmackDown. September 26, 2002: Another match on this DVD that took place in San Diego, and another win for Rey Rey. While this bout does have the usual limitations of triple-threat matches, these three athletes more than counteract that with their creativity. Entertaining stuff & definitely worthy enough to be on this collection of matches.

vs Jamie Noble. SmackDown. November 21, 2002: Pretty much a filler bout that lasted all of 3 minutes. Decent for the short time it lasted.

Confidential 619: Four minute segment to end the DVD, where Rey briefly explains some of the hisory & detail behind 2 of his trademark moves; The '619' & 'West Coast Pop'. Pretty much filler.

If I went back over this section again, I'm sure that I wrote the word 'entertaining' a lot of times. And at the end of the day, that is exactly what this DVD is; Entertaining. I would have to say this is one of the WWE's best so far. 'Hulk Still Rules' probably just edges it out, but that's more to do with the quantity of extras, rather than the quality. While I seemed a little harsh on the main part of the DVD, it is sufficiently entertaining & provides a good backdrop for the matches contained within the extras. All the important Mysterio matches are included on the DVD & I would rate 7 of the 10 bouts, an 8 or better. The only probable exclusion was his bout with Ultimo Dragon at World War 3 in 1996. That probably should have been on here instead of the Jericho & Noble matches. But I'm very much nit-picking. This is an extremely entertaining & well put together DVD that will get repeated viewings in my household. Not only that, but it successfully showcases one of the best wrestlers of the last decade. Very much recommended.",1114732800,9,7806,4.624548736462094
1846969,3,B00008HCA4,"I picked this DVD up on sale today for an unbeleibly cheap price compared to what they normaly are, but I think I know why they couldn't sell some of these WWE titles, they simpely don't have enough material on them, at least, this one didn't anyway.

Rey Mysterio is my fav. cruiser weight, and has been for many years. I myself used to wrestle profesionaly and I am not easily impressed with a lot of wrestlers monuvers, but Rey is one wrestler that blows my my mind every single time. I wouldnt even call what Rey creates 'wrestling'. I'd call it art. I've never seen such athletisism and courage from anybody like Rey. I've never seen the Hurricanrana pulled off so quickly with such height, even from the top ropes and looking like there just as easy for Rey to execute as it is to walk.

Rey has invented so many eye popping monuvers over his carrer, starting from when he was only 15 and making his debut wrestling match, then going on to the AAA, Japan, WCW and then to the highest level of wrestling acheivable, the WWE.

This is a 1 disc video to the carreer of Rey Misterio, Jnr. The main feature runs for just over an hour. It shows mostly small highlights from time to time of some of the Unbeleivable things Rey has pulled off over the years, but mostly it's interveiws. With Rey, his mother, father, coule of friends. It's not something I think I will watch again very soon, it's kind of boring and the only time I was interested was when it actualy showed some parts of Rey's matches.

out of 5 stars I give the main feature a 2.

The Extra features however are excellent. There is 10 full matches, one or two from the AAA, a few from WCW (masked Rey days) and a couple from WWE. All pretty impressive matches.

There is also a small clip of Rey talking about his song 619 and where the number came from hidden in the Chapter selection section. As soon as you get in the chapter selection menu, press 'left' (make sure it's from the first chapters text) and it will show the clip.

And in the extra features there is 2 menus, on the first menu when you highlight any of the text of the matchs and press left, it will show the short sneak peak ""he's coming"" promo's that Smack Down used. There is about 7 of them. The other two are on the next menu found the exact same way on the the first two text's in the menu.

This DVD needs a lot more. It mostly focused on Rey talking about things. His face is never shown, when he isn't wearing the mask, it is blurred out. At the demise of the WCW they stripped Rey of the Mask. However the DVD explains that Lucidous respect there masked wrestlers. To them they are superheros and it is disrespectfull to take the mask off. It's a tradition, or culture. So I guess now that Rey is in the WWE and again wearing the mask and back to tradition, he probably didn't want to be seen on the video in those awful end of WCW days. Those matchs where the same evey week anyway because WCW lost the plot and didn't know what the hell they where doing..and thats why WWE triumphed and bought there arses out.

I don't recomend you pay alot for this DVD. I'm kind of ok with the lack of footage because I didn't pay much for it. But unless your the die hard Rey fan and wanna watch Rey taking a camera crew through his house and showing you where his DVD player is and where he sits when he eats, then you will probably find it a bore. The bonus features matches are great tho. Even the ones from the WCW playing there taped crowed chants during a show, you can hear the cheers and chants, but no one in the crowed's lips are moving... HAHAHA",1111536000,2,3588,4.241581259150805
1846970,1,B00008HCA4,"This dvd was at a good price and Ive always enjoyed watching him wrestle. The problem was the documentary was a joke, espeically when he talked about his mask. Its funny how he didn't talk about losing his mask in WCW then showing up in WWE with it on. Thats a big no no in Mexican wrestling (Not going explain, read it yourself). It didn't do him justice, and was like Hogan and Lesnar's dvds-just cashing in on who is hot at the moment. Anther big problem I had was his WCW matches.  They were amazing but as soon as he pinned his challenger, it stopped. It sucks espeically when he wins the cruiserweight title, and you don't get to see him awarded the title. In a great match, Rey pins Chris Jericho as Dean Malenko comes to ringside. He steps on the apron as Rey wins, and it just stops there. What the hell is that about? His WWE matches, you get to see him celebrate and the WCW matches are just cut off. I hope the Eddie Guerrerro DVD is not like that.  Rey is amazing talent and fun to watch, but this dvd is poorly done.",1108339200,,1030,4.1708542713567835
1846971,5,B00008HCA4,"""Rey Mysterio: 619"" is a very good piece of home video put together by the WWE.  Although, Rey has only been in the WWE for two years, he has been in the sports entertainment business for a very long time.  This DVD may have been put out pretty early in Mysterio's career, but who cares.  It is a great DVD.  The main portion of this DVD is a biography on the life of Mysterio.  It talks about him getting involved in wrestling and follows his career in Mexico, WCW, and WWE.  Mysterio also offers commentary on some his best matches.

As always, WWE puts a lot of very good extra matches.  In this case there are ten matches.

1. Rey Mysterio , Latin Lover, & Heavy Metal vs. Fuerza Guerrera, Psicosis, & Madonna's Boyfriend (AAA When Worlds Collide)

A real fast paced match.  Psicosis went on to a productive career in WCW.  This match shows Mysterio at a young age and shows that he had a great innovative attack back then.  (8.5/10)

2. Rey Mysterio vs. Dean Malenko (WCW Great American Bash 1996 - Cruiserweight Title)

This was Rey's first match in WCW.  Great match with two very contrasting styles by both men.  They worked very well together.  (9/10)

3. Rey Mysterio vs. Psicosis (WCW Bash At The Beach 1996)

Amazing match.  The fans got to see two very new styles in this match.  Both pulled off death defying and innovative moves that the fans in North America had never seen before.  Very fast paced and high flying match.  (9/10)

4. Rey Mysterio vs. Dean Malenko (WCW Nitro 7/8/1996 - Cruiserweight Title)

This was the opening match on Nitro the day after Hogan joined the NWO.  Good way to kick off a great show.  It is a very quick match.  (8/10)

5. Rey Mysterio vs. Eddie Guerrero (WCW Halloween Havoc 1997 - Mask vs. Title Match)

This match was voted Match of the Year for 1997.  It does not disappoint.  It is one of my favorite matches of all time.  Very exciting fast paced match with great spots and close falls.  (10/10)

6. Rey Mysterio vs. Chris Jericho (Bash At The Beach 1998)

Good match, but way to quick.  It is only like 6 minutes.  (8/10)

7. Rey Mysterio vs. Chavo Guerrero (Smackdown 7/23/2002)

Rey's WWE debut.  Not the best match by these two, but it is important for history's sake.  (8/10)

8. Rey Mysterio vs. Kurt Angle (Smackdown 9/12/2002)

Very good match.  It is not as a great as their match at Summerslam 2002, but very good nonetheless.  Good spot with the Angle slam off the top rope.  (9/10)

9. Rey Mysterio vs. Kurt Angle vs. Chris Benoit (Smackdown 9/26/2002)

Another very good match.  On interesting note, this was actually not the best match of the night.  Edge and Eddie Guerrero had a no DQ, no countout match that turned into a ladder match.  Anyways, still a good match.  These three mixed well together.  (9/10)

10. Rey Mysterio vs. Jamie Noble (Smackdown 11/21/2002)

This was an ok match, but the two have had way better matches.  I don't understand why they picked this one out of all matches.  (7.5/10)

Another extra is a Confidential feature on the ""619.""

Good DVD.  I wish they would have included Rey's match with Kurt Angle at Summerslam 2002 and some of his tag matches with Edge against Angle and Benoit or the Guerrero's.  Still a great DVD.

I definately recommend picking this one up.

1846972,4,B00008HCA4,"Maybe I'm just utterly amazed by the Ric Flair DVD I saw before this one.
Don't get the wrong idea.  This is a very good DVD, perhaps even a great one at that.  But it has its flaws, and they are very noticeable.
Personally, the hiding of Mysterio's face is INSIPID.  It is an insult to the intelligence and childish.
It would have been appreciated had they included the following matches, which he was maskless in:
WCW Greed 2001 (WCW's final PPV) - Cruiserweight Tag titles - Rey Mysterio and Billy Kidman v. Elix Skipper and Kid Romeo
WCW Nitro - March 1999 - Cruiserweight title - Billy Kidman v. Rey Mysterio
This one really irks me, because there are CLIPS of the match, and it's only available if you recorded the broadcast... Why in hell this was left out is beyond me:
WWE Smackdown - November 7, 2002 - WWE Tag titles - 2/3 Falls - Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit v. Edge and Rey Mysterio (Edge and Mysterio won this match, by the way)
This match would have been nice as well:
WWE Smackdown - November 14, 2002 - Eddie Guerrero v. Rey Mysterio
Instead of those classic matches, the WWE decides to stick these on here:
WCW Bash At the Beach 1998 - Cruiserweight title - Rey Mysterio v. Chris Jericho (I love Jericho, but this is blatanly egotistical of him to demand us to watch this garbage)
WWE Smackdown - November 21, 2002 - Rey Mysterio v. Jamie Noble
Oh, one more NEGATIVE comment:
I HATE the way the WCW matches are treated.  Here are examples...
WCW Great American Bash 1996 - my recording has better picture and sound quality than the DVD version
WCW Bash At the Beach 1996 - same as GAB 1996, in fact, the sound is WORSE
WCW Nitro - July 8, 1996 - the match is CLIPPED
ALL of the WCW matches are only shown BELL TO BELL.  No intros, no post-match celebrations.  Kinda takes away the excitement.
As for the WWE matches, I just wish the opponents' intros were shown as well.
Oh, and why on God's green earth is a Rey Mysterio LOSS to Kurt Angle on this DVD?
However, the good outweights the bad on this DVD:
The WCW matches are excellent, especially the Halloween Havoc match, which is worth the price alone.  The debut match is utterly tremendous, and the Bash At the Beach 1996 match with Psychosis is one of the greatest openers of all-time.
The three-way Smackdown match with Angle and Benoit is also stellar.
Thumbs up, but don't get angry at any of the bad on this very good DVD.",1072224000,,2398,4.36322869955157

1846975,5,B00008HCA4,"This DVD is excellent - one of the few DVDs that head all the way back into the past. Covering everything from Rey training with his uncle to his Wrestlemania loss, including WCW days, this DVD is a must-buy for fans of wrestling - even if you're not a fan of lucha libre.
Some of the extras include his cruiserweight championship matches from WCW, and some of his stand out WWE matches.
If you highlight one of the first seven matches under the 'Extras' heading and press 'left' with your DVD remote, you get seven Rey Mysterio debut promos - and if you highlight the 'Who's That?' chapter under the 'Jump To' heading you can see Rey in a 'WWE Anthology' clip talking about his music.",1056067200,2,685,4.444444444444445
1846976,4,B00008HCA4,"By today's standards, I am not a fan of Rey Mysterio.  I used to be when he first came into World Championship Wrestling, and the inclusion of those matches sparked my interest in the DVD.  I don't remember when I lost interest in Rey Mysterio, but it must have been around the time he lost his mask (no worries here; his face is blurred in maskless shots).
The program was different than most other ""WWE Personality"" DVD's issued.  In recent releases, the wrestlers have been less kayfabe than this program.  Kurt Angle speaks as a heel, and Rey Mysterio constantly jabs on A-Train for the injury.  It had been so long since I've seen interviews done in character that it threw me off.
The program started discussion the size difference between himself and other SuperStars, using Albert as an example.  In that match, Rey Mysterio suffers an injury and the program follows his rehabilitation, which includes a trip back to Mexico, which is where the chronicle begins on how his career went from Mexico to today.
The extras are great features as the matches capture the energy of Rey Mysterio, and the inclusion of Rey Mysterio/Psychosis was a blessing considering the history of those men.
For Rey Mysterio fans, this DVD is a must-have.  For wrestling historians that want to build their DVD collection, this DVD will do the trick.  For the casual fan that only sees Rey Mysterio when they're waiting for Brock Lesnar, that might be the only person for whom I would recommend a different DVD.

The part of the documentary that was off-putting for me was where Rey played the Albert injury angle as if it were legit. There were also a couple other areas in the documentary where there seemed to have been a mix between fantasy and reality.

There was a nice mix of matches for Rey showcasing his high-flying abilities. Missing is any ECW footage and WCW footage without the mask. I gave it 3 stars because there are better collections out there with a lot more matches(including some that are on here). Good DVD still if you can find it cheap but I recommend looking for the newer collections.",1337558400,,867,4.446540880503145
