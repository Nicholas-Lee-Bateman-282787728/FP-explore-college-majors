They have much purer hearts than we lesser (though supposedly superior)mortals. To see Koko showing embarrassment, grief and being coy as she looked at prospective partners showed such purity of heart and emotion that we usually only see in children. It is heartbreaking that hearts as pure as Koko's(in human form)grow up to hate, commit violence and start wars laden with atrocities.
Are we really the evolved species.
I don't think so.",1370736000,,496,5.135802469135802
7917068,5,B00003BDZE,"This is a movie for all ages.  An educational film for children and parents alike, single men or women will benefit too.  This film is informative about the intelligence and emotional range of gorillas.  It is touching to see the gorilla's discribe in their own words, using American Sign Language, the assasination of their mothers and the grief felt with the loss of a pet and friend, to see them paint and name their own at work, even the creation of games to play.  This is indeed a movie for everyone.",1071532800,4,506,4.527472527472527
7917069,5,B00003BDZE,"This is a great film which documents the lives and sign language abilities of Koko and Michael, two very intelligent Gorilla's.

7917070,5,B00003BDZE,"Wow! What a great video! Koko and Michael are amazing gorillas and their respective stories are very touching and endearing. The part where Michael (One of the gorillas) reveals his memories of seeing his parents killed by poachers is very powerful and you can see the emotion and scars in the beautiful beings eyes. Anyone who does not have compassion for gorillas and all beings after viewing the video, does not have a heart or soul. Must have video!",998870400,6,453,4.746835443037975
7917071,5,B00003BDZE,"A truly inspiring story of a breakthrough in communication between species - and the special friendship that has developed as a result. A must see for animal lovers and teachers - especially teachers and users of the American  Sign Language for the Deaf.  It is incredible, heartwarming and fun to  watch this relationship unfold - and even more amazing to see the depth of  emotion demonstrated by Koko and her gorilla companions. Wait until you see  their paintings!  A great video for any age group that appreciates animals  as the intelligent creatures they obviously are - and an eye opener for  anyone who doesn't!",946252800,34,620,4.894230769230769
