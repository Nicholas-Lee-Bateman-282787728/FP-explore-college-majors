I like the series VERY much. It's a period piece...late 50's and onward.

The background..clothing...cars...furniture all look fantastic.

All the actors do a great job.

This series has EVERTHING...including Mob characters....and people that swim with the fishies .

Kind of timely considering Man Men is also out there.",1333670400,32,393,5.078125

5103471,2,B007PTCRIW,"A long time ago, before the Video Revolution, a veteran screenwriter told me that if a movie did not grab me in the first ten minutes, to just walk out and not waste any more time on it. As time has gone by, I have learned that this gentleman was correct.

I purchased the 2 seasons of this show during the Black Friday weekend for about $7 apiece. That should have raised a red flag or two; but I am weak - I simply cannot resist a deal.

I got through the first DVD of the First Season - thats 3 Episodes (Im a retiree, plus I like to give the material a chance), but I could go no further. I also read somewhere that there would not be a 3rd season and I can see why: theres not a single character that I cared about, and I found the plot lines terribly shallow and predictable. What I watched played like someone had gone through Mario Puzos waste basket. Not that I was a fan of his, but at least his material had originality and substance.

I gave away the two sets to a neighbor who enjoyed all of the nudity and raunch. His wife, however, was furious with me.

I must learn to resist these Black Friday Starz temptations. Yes, Ive gotten stung before. Mea Culpa.",1483660800,,1170,4.140969162995595

The storytelling and characters are outstanding, the acting ensemble is a first rate dream cast, the costumes are as magnificent as the luxurious sets, and the cars from that era are just stunning, a fan favorite of the show.
This is a well-wriiten, quality TV series for adults only that you don't want to miss.
Unfortunately, it was canceled after only two seasons, which was one of the biggest mistakes in cable TV history by a short-sighted executive who refused to listen to legions of faithful fans and could not see they had a top quality show and cast, and had captured the ever illusive magic in a bottle.

5103515,4,B007PTCRIW,"A most interesting film, IMHO, obviously, of the original founder, and, private , the late Ben Novack, of the legendary Fontainbleau Hotel
4441 Collins Avenue, Miami Beach, FLA. the story was part fiction,and a lot of the basic outline of the story was true, such as.. the late
Frank Sinatra, had a private suite at the Fontainbleau, for decades, from winter season of 1954/55 up thru, the end of the winter season
of 1977, and founder Ben Novack, had a son, who had a reputation as being very cocky and gregarious, who also lived at his fathers
llandmark hotel. Ben Novack was also, from hearsay, friendly, with the late 1930's mobster, Meyer Lansky, who lived just 2 blocks up the
street in another high rise condo, next to the Eden Roc.  I get a lot of this information, from my employment as a bellhop at the original
Fontainbleau hotel in 1975 and 1976. The hotel was foreclosed on and closed down in April of 1977, (briefly) and Roland Int'l Corp/Steven Muss
of Miami and Hilton Hotels did a big time rehab, especially of the pool, and eliminated the famous beach bungalows.  The movie itself was
rather seedy at times, thus, I gave it a 4 star, rather than a 5 star rating.  Season II was also very interesting to view IMHO. The Fontainebleau
was unfortunately closed down for about 18 months, in 2006, when two investors, stripped down the main bldg., and, spent so much money
on it, they were facing foreclosure by 2008, heresay is the partner firm, a Dubai World, bailed out a near 2nd bankruptcy.  The hotel, now is
dwarfed by the 2004/2005 super high rise Fontainebleau II Condominium, (37 stoires) and furthermore, the former, Fontainebleau Spa, once the
Sorrento Hotel, until Ben Novack bought it, was imploded, and a 18  story Fontainebleau III condo has now replaced it (18 stories) making the
once spacious 22 acres, very, very crowded, in the here and now.  Movies, ""Goldfinger 1964"" ""Tony Rome 1967"" ""The Specialist"" were all
partially filmed on location there.  The Boom Boom Room, The Gardens, and the Tennis Courts are now gone, as, is Club Gigi, Tropigala Lounge,
and the LaRonde Superstar theater are also gone, from ABC TV's ""Surfside Six"" days filmed 1960 thru 1962.(so is the famous Houseboat, that
the murderer of fashion designer, Versace, hid out, until he was caught by LE.in the mid 1990's.  Again, the movie is still quite contagious to
watch for anyone, who ever vacationed there from the 1950's thru the 1990's heydays, under two different, managements.  Miami, ""truly the
Magic City"" has been totally transformed, as has Miami Beach, with the massive Cocaine Cartel influx of cash during the 1980's, and now the
population of greater Miami/Miami beach has changed from 25% Latino, to 65% Latino, based on the 2010 census.",1430697600,3,2757,4.811839323467231

5103522,5,B007PTCRIW,"Magic City is one of those series that really sticks to you if you fit into any one of the many reasons that might attract you to that kind of show.

Created by Mitch Glazer who is also one of the principle producers it stars Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Olga Kurylenko, Steven Strait and Jessica Marais, in the main roles. Produced for the Starz network Magic City originally ran from March 30, 2012 and finished up two seasons on August 9, 2013. It was not renewed for a third season. Currently it can be viewed on Netflix.

If you have any connection to Jewish or American Jewish life, Cuban or Cuban American life, and have any interest at all in stories about organized crime in the free world, or just enjoy anything salacious, violence, sex, steamy romance, intrigue, suspense, then you should watch Magic City.

The show takes place in 1959 Miami, the Kennedys, the 59 Dodgers, Hula hoops, great big Cadillacs with shark fins in the back and Ed Sullivan on Sunday nights, all come together at The Miramar Playa, a fictitious but very authentic first class Hotel on the Miami strand.

The set production was next to perfect. The dcor, the costumes were perfect for the time. As someone who was a very little boy in 1959 it took me back. The way men dressed with their tight pants and outer jac-shirts. Zippo lighters never seemed to be far away from a pack of cigarettes. And, of course, everyone smoked. Doctors were starting to warn about the health effects of smoking but It wasn't until 1966 when the Surgeon General became serious and placed warning labels on packs of cigarettes.

Jewish organized crime, hardly ever romanticized in favor of the Italians which were more demonstrative in 20th century Americana, plays a central role in this series as they live up to every underworld stereotype, from degenerate sex to the worst kinds of human sadistic behavior. Apparently, they ran Miami during the post World War II years, probably led by Meyer Lansky although his name is never mentioned. Rather, James Caan, in a supporting role plays Sy Berman, the Lansky type character in the story.

Shamefully, there is a part of me that is proud of Jewish gangsterism. Probably no different than being proud of Jewish sports heroes, Benny Leonard, Hank Greenberg, Sandy Koufax, etc. Not sure why that is. Maybe because they broke the mold of the stereotype bookish Jew, physically weak, and not able to stand up for himself. Of course, those are stereotypes and do not reveal reality. But, Jewish gangsters seem to prove that it doesnt. Maybe that is what I am proud of.

In the 1930s a group of the New York Jewish guys once broke up an American Nazi party meeting, they ran into the hall and just started beating every one up. How cool is that. But then afterward they probably went out and tortured to death one of their street enemies, something none of us could ever sanction. So its a strange kind of kinship the rest of have with that element.

As a Jewish Zionist I can never forget what American Jewish crime did for the Jews in 1948. Because of an international ban on weapons imposed by the Truman administration, the proposed Jewish State in Palestine was left to its own devices to secure proper weapons to fight the coming war with the Arabs everyone knew was coming.

American Jewish crime secured the kinds of weapons which enabled Israels fledgling armed forces to barely survive the first month of their War of Independence. It is quite possible that the Jews could have done it without that segment of American  Jewish society nevertheless the  contribution in history has always been appreciated by people like me.

One of my  favorite sayings attributed to Albert Schweitzer really applies to these types of situations. You don't have to be an angel to be a saint.

But I do digress.

Mitch Glazer, the producer grew up in Miami Beach, in and around hotels during that time period, so his experiences of being told stories and listening to staff and family tell him lurid tales of crime and how crime don't pay (for anything) became the basis for this series.

With character names like Ben Diamond, Judi Silver and Belvan Jaffe, living the low life in Miami Beach, they were gangsters and bad people but they were part of the Jewish family just the same. Like my own mother and father most of that generation were born from immigrant parents so the Yiddish expressions are common, the cultural ties of common background, heritage, and history bound that community together.

Its no different than the Italian or Irish or any other immigrant community in the American experience. These just happen to be Jewsgangster Jews. Criminal gangs have historically bonded over cultural similarities, and the Jewish crime, whether in Miami, Chicago or L.A. did the same.  Make no mistake, these are bad people, they did bad things but they make for exciting television.

Along with the magnificent set direction, wardrobe and meticulous detail of the period, the show does take on a realism. You think you are looking at 1959. With that prop expertly devised all Glazer had to do was to tell his story.

The show also tells of a symbiotic closeness between the anti-Castro Cubans who took asylum in Miami after the revolution. Castro took over Cuba in 1959 and along with his hatchet man Che Guevara instituted a reign of terror in which they jailed and executed Cuban nationals, many innocent people, sometimes whole families were murdered just because they were rich and had some kind of connection to the Batista regime.

On all levels those relationships between Jews and Cubans seem to work in Magic City, love, war, honesty, fidelity, it all comes together for the two communities going through life on two similar but parallel life lines never crossing, never descending into tension.  Almost like there is an understanding on the oppressive nature withstood by both groups. Im not sure if Miami history was that smooth between Cubans and Jews, but even if it wasnt, Glazer made it work for him and his story.

Unfortunately, for me, because I really liked it, the show was cancelled after two seasons. There is hope however. Netflix, has on occasion bought the rights to certain series that were left cliff hanging and consequently many disappointed fans. After purchasing the rights to the three seasons of The Killing from AMC, Netflix produced a season four to tie up all the loose ends. Not ideal but at least it was something. They produced 15 episodes of Arrested Development six years after Fox cancelled it, giving the loyal fans of the show something more that was perceived to be lost.

But, the point is that they could conceivably continue the series if they felt they could get enough of an audience. Whether the show has that or not I don't know.

But, at least we have those two seasons. If you fit into one of the categories I explained at the beginning you will probably like Magic City.

5103544,4,B007PTCRIW,"Thanks to almost no promotion from Starz and a terrible friday night timeslot, Magic City became the best show you never saw in 2012-2013. I won't waste time with a recap of the story since it's listed above these reviews. What I will say is that I JUST found out about this show in 2014 and started watching the Blu-ray sets last week. If you love the fashions of Mad Men, the violence of The Sopranos and some of the most decadent and luxurious sets ever featured on television, Magic City is your show. This show is pure eye candy and every episode looks VERY expensive. It's a shame Starz didn't make any real effort to promote and save this show. This is the kind of series that slowly builds an audience from word of mouth and rentals to become the next Breaking Bad (which was a sleeper hit for the first few seasons as well). I wish I was writing this review in 2016 talking about how great season 5 was but Starz pulled the plug already. To sum it up, if you enjoy seeing beautiful people, amazing sets, fantastic cars, shocking violence, nudity, boozing, breathtaking sunsets and a really cool chapter in American history, buy these dvd's. Maybe if they sell enough copies the show could be picked up again (this happened with Family Guy, Futureama & Arrested Development).",1403568000,2,1283,4.558441558441558

5103546,5,B007PTCRIW,"I have watched this show on TV with my husband quite a few times.  However, I never went back to the very beginning.  It is a fascinating synopsis of Miami in the late 50's/early 60's.  Basically, it shows the torments and traumas of the end of the Batista regime, and the beginning's of the Castro dictatorship.  My parent's honeymoon was at the Fountainbleu in '55; and I have several close friends who escaped Cuba when Castro took over.  This explains many things to me.  Great show!!!",1395792000,2,489,4.627906976744186
5103547,4,B007PTCRIW,I think magic city would have been a good movie if given enough time.  it had a good story line.,1395446400,,96,3.8
5103548,4,B007PTCRIW,Magic City imparts that feeling for the time that was.  History and glamour rolled into one.  And a great story as well!,1395360000,,120,4.409090909090909

5103550,5,B007PTCRIW,"Magic City is a great show...although I am just now writing a review for a cancelled cable series.  I can still weigh
in with my positive review for this series.

The action, acting and period costuming (clothes, cars, etc...) was very effective - it was a wonder that the cast
could even function in those vehicles!  (It definitely took me back...)

Get your own copy at a good price and view/re-view it again!

Five stars!",1394841600,,424,4.6

Then when the Jew mob boss kills the Jew union rep he all upset. I guess he just wanted him to beat him up. LOL. Then they all go to the synagogue for funeral of the union rep. What a lovely group. I know Moses would have been proud. Oh and their are so many sex scenes we thought we where watching porno for awhile. That is right lots & lots of Jewish woman showing it all along with some of the Jewish men. If your into to all this enjoy but I would suggest not because the plot line is not subtle but annoying.",1393632000,2,657,3.8666666666666667
5103553,5,B007PTCRIW,"The grand set featured in this series (The Miramar Playa Hotel) seems so stunningly authentic--if you're old enough to remember how the world looked and felt in 1959. Its a fascinating location to explore cinematically. Danny Huston, when he blows his stack, displays the most convincing rage youll probably ever see on-screen. This guy youd want more as your friend than the other thing, and his performance alone is worth your nickel. John Hustons children inherited such terrific acting genes from their old man.

For fifteen bucks you cant go wrong, and youll probably watch all the episodes more than once.",1393200000,,611,5.0495049504950495

5103578,5,B007PTCRIW,"Why do they cancel all the good stuff?  Maybe because it's Starz and nobody watches them.  People get weary of names like Starz, and SyFy that don't know how to spell.  How can the programming be any good if they have to resort to name tricks to get people to look at them?  Maybe Starz needs a shark show.  Sharktopus?  Taken.  Sharknado?  Taken.  Sharkphoon?  Let's get a writer in here!  But White Queen is worth watching.  Maybe its just the medieval sex scenes.  Maybe it's just there's nothing better to watch.

I thought the acting is very good and the characters are pretty exciting.  It is definitelyrated R for the sexual content.

In the second season, however, thematically the show was clearly finding it's legs....and then the cancellation was announced.  While I'm happy to see that the show really did have the capacity to be visually stunning and thematically intriguing, I'm sad to see that it's another example of potential gone to naught.",1375747200,,527,5.116279069767442
5103585,5,B007PTCRIW,Was born and raised in Miami and this series makes me nostalgic for the times and glimpses I recall as a child.  Sometimes Ike is too sentimental and mommy like with his sons and I find myself looking for signs of modern day Miami and all I can come up with is the metal guard rails on the causeways...But only because I know this place.

5103588,5,B007PTCRIW,"Magic City shot in the late 50's early sixties in a fantastic chromatic blue overtone. In a world with ""heros"" in their 20's its refreshing to see Jeffery Dean Morgan play the lead as the fabulous and believable Ike Evans ,fighting to keep the mob and one man in particular Ben ( The Butcher)Diamond. ( Danny Huston). Out of his casino. Union troubles forces Ike to make a deal with ""The Butcher"" that gets him into his casino and the tension grows between Ike and Ben Diamond ( played brilliantly by Danny Huston).

5103594,5,B007PTCRIW,"This is a great series with terrific story lines, acting, and production values. The story takes place in the Miami Beach of the fifties-just after Castro takes Cuba. Ike Evans' Miramar Playa is the showplace of the City. But everyone wants a piece of it. So the question becomes can he keep it and can he keep it legitimate. The Miami Beach of the series is populated by gangsters, politicians, ""honest"" businessmen and people on the make from every direction. The actors are uniformly good with special mention to Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Danny Houston, and Elena Satine. This girl is amazing as a hooker dealt an extremely dangerous hand who is terrorized by gangsters and an underhanded DA but refuses to buckle under the weight of her own fear.
The first couple of episodes set the general story line, the characters, and the place in time. The pace picks up considerably  with each passing episode.
This series can be compared to Boardwalk Empire. Both deal with a particular city and a particular historical period. But Magic City is superior for both the writing and the acting. I highly recommend this absorbing drama.",1372982400,2,1123,4.848958333333333

5103597,5,B007PTCRIW,this series on Starz was a grabber from the jump. Very Scorcese-esque. Terrific acting. Has a fantastic look - Miami in the early 60's - all pastels and sunlight and dark intrigue. Characters seem lived in and close to archetypes you might have seen before - but fresh and new and wonderful to watch in their world of high class hotels and the rich and powerful. I didn't stick with the addition to my cable lineup long enough to see more than the first 4 episodes - so jumped on the DVD set and watched it all. Great stuff. All in time for season 2 to be starting up. Might not be able to wait for the DVD season this time around.,1372550400,,631,4.180327868852459

5103602,5,B007PTCRIW,"I absolutely love the 50/early 60's era.  The women had such great style..  The show seems to capture the beautiful part of that Miami era.  As far as the characters go, the sex scenes to me are a little overplayed.  I know what sex is I don't need the reminder every 5 minutes.  I would say if they tone that part down and concentrate more on the dialogue and acting talent and events surrounding that time, the show stands a chance of having a great run.  Steve (Ike's son) needs an acting coach.  I've already grown tired of Ben's wife (Lilly Diamond).  Ben's a nut but I get his character.  Danny & Mercedes, they're okay.  I love Ike.  He is just so cool and handsome.  Yes he has a dark side but I do think something is going to take place between him and Meg Banack.  You can just sense the sexual tension there.  In fact, I like him and Meg more than Vera.  The color scheme and the cars, I could go on and on about that.",1372204800,,929,4.140449438202247

 It doesn't get any better than this for ringing your chimes and rattling the bars of your crib, if ya get my drift. Every show seems to trigger long lost emotions and rememberances!
I've already bought season one and hoping for a long run like the ""Sopranos"" will ensue. Since ""Havanna"" is my favorite movie, I can only urge my compatriots to watch it again until a new episode appears.

5103610,5,B007PTCRIW,"This is a short film, only 2 minutes, showcasing cars driven in the series with my favorite being the 1958 Corvette.  I was a teenager back then and remember all of them.  Fun times.  The Mercedes convertible was sleek, classy, and very expensive.

The series takes place in late-50s Miami Beach, which I also remember well.  My parents took me to the Fontainebleau for a vacation and the sights and sounds are forever burned in my psyche.  Everything was absolutely as glamorous as what is shown in the series.",1369699200,,511,4.685393258426966

5103612,5,B007PTCRIW,"My wife and I got hooked on it during its first season on Starz. She particulary loved the 50's soundtrack and the cars, while I went for the glamor and the girls!  My impression was if ""Godfather II"" were a TV series (and even the soundtrack music is reminiscent of it), it would be ""Magic City""!

The set is also a high quality transfer, even if you get the DVDs rather than Blu-Ray set.  It's been engineered to fill up the screen with no black bars at the top and bottom, which I like.

Highly recommended!",1368748800,,510,4.28125

It starts on New Year's Eve 1959 in Miami.  It's exciting and dramatic--great storylines!  The main character owns a huge hotel (like the Fontainebleu) on the beach.

5103646,3,B007PTCRIW,"I didn't enjoy this series as much as most of the other reviewers. The pace picks up after the second episode, the sets are authentic, and the ending of each episode does a good job of teasing you about what is coming next. However, I had trouble believing some of the characters - the hotel owner seems too laid back to be real, and his gangster partner appears to be a one-man show. Plus, the ending was low-key and disappointing (can someone please explain why one of the bad guys rescued the prostitute who was going to testify against them?) I get the felling that this was supposed to be a 13 episode season, but the producers ran out of money after nine episodes.",1356480000,,670,4.411290322580645

5103658,4,B007PTCRIW,"Good series, but both of the leads sons are real jerks.  They are not credible.

For one, the oldest son is head of the Beverage Dept. at the hotel, and yet he never wears the required uniform, does not act like he is in command, and smokes behind the bar as he serves drinks.  Very verboten -- cigarette ashes easily drop into the bar ice, therefore the drinks. I worked as a bartender at the #1 hotel in Las Vegas and not even the CEO's son could get away with that s***.

The younger son is graduating from law school and an ingrate.  His father has lavished love on him and paid his entire expense to get through college, yet he wants to join the local D.A.s office and put his father in prison -- with no other reason than he believes in ""justice"".  Then why not join the Organized Crime Task Force and go after the Cosa Nostra in New York?  The kid is so stupid that he doesn't realize that these second rate D.A.s are using him. Very poor screenwriting.

Four Stars for the really hot women in the series, and the definite feel of the late 50s.",1354924800,,1051,4.22

5103661,3,B007PTCRIW,"Once more cable TV sets out to make a series that hopes to deliver high class drama with low class subject matter. It's something they've come to do well for the most part but not always as effectively as they'd like. This time around the series revolves around the Miami hotel circuit near the end of the fifties and into the sixties, displaying the desire of Hollywood execs to try and capitalize off the success of other shows once more. Once MAD MEN took off and became a hit, suddenly everyone wanted to revisit the early 60s. The network series about Hugh Hefner and the Playboy Empire floundered shortly after it aired and PAN AM didn't even make it through the first season. So how does MAGIC CITY stand?

The story revolves around Ike Evans (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), a man who struggled from the bottom to get to the top. The owner and main driving force behind the Miramar Hotel on the famous beach does whatever he can to make his business succeed. Unfortunately that includes becoming involved with the mob in the form of boss Ben Diamond (Danny Huston).

The time is ripe for mob influence as well with Castro coming into power in Cuba and their hotels/casinos there being lost. They not only want to be involved in the hotels in Miami, they want to take ownership of them from behind the scenes. It's the only way they can with the FBI looking over their shoulder.

Ike sees the potential that the hotels in Miami have. He sees it as more than a simple place to rest yourself on the road to somewhere. This is a resort town in the making with the potential of casinos and high class entertainment much like Vegas which was developing at the same time. But he has problems that he thinks only these mob connections can solve, the first of which is a potential union strike by the hotel employees. With Frank Sinatra set to open on his stage, he can't afford to have them picketing out front. The mob solution of course ends in someone being killed and the body dumped. This plays into several episodes down the line and links Ike into the dealings behind the scenes as well as in front.

The story also involves Ike's sons, one of whom unknowingly begins a rather heated affair with Ben's wife and the other going to college to become involved with law enforcement. Either one has the potential of collapsing the dreams of Ike.

The show does capture the feel and the look of the times. It offers a glittery surface that most people who went their saw without the darker roots at its core. It's those darker roots that develop most of the drama in the show and that keep it interesting.

The acting is well played by all involved. Morgan has become a driving force in the roles he plays. I first saw him in the series SUPERNATURAL and wondered why he wasn't used more. Since then he's had several starring roles and with his turn here as Ike shows that he deserves more. Huston plays the slimy mob boss to perfection. Ruled more by temperamental fits than by sly cunning, Huston's Ben is to be feared first and foremost. He can be outmaneuvered but only if you don't forget that behind that temper is a cunning sense of evil that just might discover more than you want.

While the show is well made and thought out it didn't feel to me that it would be one that would last several seasons and yet season two is already in the works. It will be interesting to see how it plays out. The one thing that did bother me while watching was the reliance on nudity that all cable shows seem to feel the need to resort to. It's as if they feel the only way to let people know that the show is a cable show is to display nude women every so many minutes per episode. While the women on view are lovely isn't there a better use for them in a series than window dressing? I'm sure those who made the series would argue that women at that time in this arena were used for nothing more. For myself I've just grown tired of the same thing being dumped into cable series as nothing more than a way of saying ""See? We're a cable series. We have breasts and networks don't. Watch us instead."" It doesn't encourage me to watch. The story should be what matters and the focus of the show as well. The so called ""window dressing"" doesn't get me interested.

That being said there is potential in this show. If they can focus on the important aspects of it and move past the rest then it might be something worth watching. If it continues down this path then it is nothing more that a celebration of T&A with some story thrown in for good measure.",1352764800,14,4534,4.382877526753864
5103662,4,B007PTCRIW,"If you liked Mad Men, Damages, Revenge, and The Sopranos, this show's for you. Talk about late 50's, early 60's glamor, suspense and drama, this one has it all, right in Miami Beach, and it gets better with each episode. Music is superb and so are the sets. It takes you right back in time. I wish there were less blatant, raw sexual scenes. Too much, and leaves nothing to the imagination, which is where I like to be. ( and I do love sex and romance, just not so much as in this show. Way over the top, in my opinion )

The only other negative I have about the show, is the main actor, Jeffery Dean Morgan who plays Ike, the main man that owns the faboo hotel on the beach. He needs to have more verve, dynamics and excitement, as his older son possesses,and whom I love to watch. The younger son, really should have been another actor, if they needed him at all, in my opinion.

The girls are plentiful, and beautiful and sexy and so are the cars of that era. Can't wait until the second season. Hope Morgan comes back with more of a masculine touch, however. You know, raw, and unafraid....not so passive, as he was in the first season. The rest of the guys are hot though, especially my favorite, The Butcher, who is Danny Houston, son of John Houston and half-sister to Angelica Houston. This guy can ACT!!! And the writers have really done an A+ job of casting and writing him. He makes the show, in my opinion. :)",1352419200,5,1421,4.278810408921933

5103671,4,B007PTCRIW,"I suspect that the inspiration of this show is ""Mad Men"" and perhaps ""Boardwalk Empire"" in that it centers around a picturesque time (just as the Kennedy-Camelot was about to start) and in a scenic area (Miami Beach).  Another similarity is that the show centers around a ""man with a dream"" in this case, Ike Evans (played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan) who runs the oh, so photogenic hotel that is the epicenter of the show.

There are pluses and minuses to ""Magic City""

On the plus side:

-Jeffrey Dean Morgan is a charismatic and sympathetic lead as the hotelier, who has essentially made a deal with the devil.

-John Huston plays the villain, Ben Diamond, with a creepy languid menace

-The 1950s of Miami Beach is vividly brought back to life both in terms of scenery and background.

-The women in the show are gorgeous and stunningly dressed.

On the minus side:

-The actors playing the sons of Ike are pretty much non-entities (vapid pretty boys).

-Some of the plot-lines are truly predictable (like when one of Ike's sons starts sleeping with Diamond's wife and takes ""souvenir"" photos of their relationship...is it any great surprise that those photos fall into the wrong hands?

-Some of the sex scenes are pretty gratuitous.

With this said, I'm looking forward to next season, but not with the same anticipation that I'd have over ""Boardwalk Empire"" or ""Breaking Bad.""",1351382400,7,1378,4.817021276595745
5103672,5,B007PTCRIW,If you like mob shows and want to see what Miami Beach was like in the late 1950's and early 60's this is a great show. Sex scenes in almost all the episodes so if that is not your thing you may want to pass.,1351209600,3,208,3.6444444444444444
5103673,5,B007PTCRIW,"Magic City is a stunning example of a high-gloss period drama. Set around Miami Beach and the fictitious Miramar Hotel in 1959, the show depicts the Evans family and the main protagonist, Issac ""Ike"" Evans, as he navigates family responsibilities, running a major hotel, and fending off the mob. While the story takes a few episodes to develop its main arc, the style is always on overdrive, at times almost too much so. Double waxed Cadillacs with fins, tailored suits, and a wonderfully designed hotel set make the show sparkle out of your TV screen. Olga Kurylenko plays Ike's wife, Vera, with beautiful results. It's almost impossible to take your eyes off her when she's in a scene. The main plots point of season 1 revolve around Ike trying to hide a murder and the Mob's involvement in his business. Ike's two sons create contrast. One is a womanizing bar-tender, the other a more modest law-student. Danny Huston plays the cliche mob villain, Ben Diamond, a little over the top, but definitely provides fear into anyone dealing with him. While there isn't as much depth in story or character development as say, Mad Men, there is plenty of likability in the characters and as the season runs on you find yourself rooting more for the Evans family. To give fair warning, the show is much more graphic than its AMC counterpart. Excessive nudity, sex, and violence are peppered throughout each episode, sometimes adding to the emotion of the show and creating shock value, while at other times the nudity is indulgent at best. For period drama lovers, it's a must see! I'd recommend this show to fans of Mad Men, Sopranos, and Boardwalk Empire.",1351123200,4,1649,4.809859154929577

Guess this glitzy 'living in the fast lane' kind of show just isn't my type of entertainment. Terrible portrayal of women, despite the cultural differences of that era (circa 1959 - 1960). Characters have very little depth, seem flat/ one-dimensional and not well-rounded believeable / real people. Also,the plot seems shallow and predictable.

5103681,5,B007PTCRIW,"I am not one of those Amazon reviewers who spoils the movie by giving away the entire plot.  I absolutely hate that!  So, if you don't like my comments, that's OK with me.  Take a chance on this series, if you gravitate toward characters who, simultaneously, repulse you -- and, then, gain your sympathy.  Think of ""Casino"" and, more recenty, ""Boardwalk Empire"" the latter of which I am truly hooked on.  I could not get enough of ""Magic City"" when it was on TV, even though I had to turn my head away any number of times.  If you think that you know the difference between a ""sinner"" and a ""saint,"" you'll have to watch until the very end to decide for sure.",1349308800,2,659,4.317073170731708
5103682,5,B007PTCRIW,"Starz is kicking some serious butt --yes, sir. With the successful series ""Spartacus"" and ""Boss,"" this maverick entertainment company now releases the equally awesome ""Magic City,"" a classy, yet brutal look at the Miami of the late fifties.

We get hooked right away with the James-Bondish-beginning, when we see this woman swimming under water totally naked, with the background of a spicy, tropical soundtrack. We are then taken to the majestic Miramar Playa Hotel, in Miami Beach, during the early hours of December 31, 1958. We meet the powerful hotel boss, Isaac ""Ike"" Evans (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), who is being pressured to unionize, a costly move, for he is not ready for its economical impact.  The union is led by Mike Strauss (Leland Orser), who will not reconsider stopping the union from picketing the hotel at the new years' gala event, where Frank Sinatra is scheduled to perform. Ike tries to convince Mike, to no avail, that by picketing at such an important hour, he will ruin him - he spent a lot of money for this event. Regrettably, Mike tells him that the ""union attack when it hurts"" Ike, unfortunately, is against the wall and have to seek help fast - very fast --, and he contacts Ben Diamond (Danny Huston), also known as ""The Butcher,"" the local crime boss. The solution, of course, is to make Mike ""disappear,"" which is what eventually happens. As it turns out, it was a quick fix for a difficult situation for Mike, who likes to run his hotel in an almost  clean way - ""occasionally bending the letter of the law,"" as he says --, and is a descent man. However, when you make business with the Butcher, there are consequences that follow, and that, precisely, is what ""Magic City"" is all about: the blowback from that single favor. Hence, in the ten episodes of the first season, we'll have a lot murders, politics, congressional lobbying, gambling, prostitution, backstabbing, Cuban refugees, Santeria, boxing, nudity (male and female), all of which will test Ike's character. We will also learn a lot about his family, beginning with his beautiful, loyal and smart wife Vera (ex-bond girl Olga Lurylenko); his sons Stevie (Steven Strait), his dad's right hand, Danny, an aspiring lawyer (Christian Cooke), and his almost teenager daughter Lauren (Taylor Blackwell); his friend Victor Lazaro, (Yul Vzquez) the hotel's manager, and his daughter Mercedes Lazaro (Dominik Garcia-Lorido; yes, Andy Garcia's daughter); and his father Arthur Evans (Alex Rocco, ""the worst Jew in town,"" as he calls himself) But the character that is Ike's nemesis (in addition to The Butcher) is District Attorney Jack Klein (Matt Ross), who wants to send Ike to jail, telling him, ""Ike, you are between a rock and a hard place: the State of Florida and Ben Diamond... If I don't get you, The Butcher will.""  So, as you can see, Ike has a pretty full plate.

""Magic City,"" like the city that it tries to portray, has class and elegance in everything - the sex, the ambiance, the colors, the nudity... hell, even the violence. It has style and it has substance - great production design and photography --, and it feels like noir at times. The cast is superb, and it also includes Kelly Lynch, Jessica Marais, Elena Satine, and Michael Rispoli. Can't wait for the next season! The DVD version includes Starz studios for Magic City, the Cars and the Style of Magic City, The Golden Age of Music, and more. (USA, 2012, color, 419 min plus additional materials).

5103683,5,B007PTCRIW,"I'm slightly obsessed with this era anyway, so add great storylines and JDM and I'm sold! One of the things I love most is how they've added in historical figures without actually showing them. It gives the show more mystique. If you tried to show them, the Kennedys for instance, it would be very hard to pull off so it speaks to the show's credit that they involve these characters the way they do. An amazing show and my new favorite!",1338336000,22,437,4.407407407407407

It's set in the late 50's which was a real classy time, they really show just how classy the time period was, with the cars that rock and the music from the Rat Pack the mob guys are just icing on the cake.

8520659,2,B007PTCRIW,"I got through the first four episodes.  It is trying to be like MAD MEN but fails in every way.  First,  the central character is boring.  Then, his kids and his wife are boring.  The storyline goes nowhere.  The acting is only adequate.  The nudity is not sexy.  I am not sure why it gets high remarks from others.  Not surprised it got cancelled after two seasons.",1506297600,,366,4.343283582089552
8520660,3,B007PTCRIW,"This is a beautiful drama. It's beautifully shot, full of beautiful buildings, beautiful interiors/exteriors, beautiful cars, and beautiful people. It's sexy. Know that the level of sexuality on stage here is what a few years ago was labeled soft porn.

Magic City brings us a stylized look at 1959 Miami Beach with new dictator on the block Fidel Castro just in power. Thus there is a bit more sizzle than steak. The plot is decent. The bad guys are halfway decent bad guys. The casting is magnificent. I must call out to actor Olga Kurylenko for her fine performance as the boss's wife, Vera Evans. I pick on her only because she looks too beautiful to be a good actor, but she is in fact quite good. You could say that about a few other goddesses in this series as well. In the second season they bring in well aged Jimmy Caan, who has apparently fully healed from the injuries he suffered in Misery.

This series passes the time, offers a lot of eye candy and the now nearly ubiquitous and mandatory full nudity and simulated sex (which ALWAYS looks simulated). It feels like they really spent some money on the production. The resort owner's 50's style panoramic office I absolutely covet. If I had the money I would have that office recreated to the last detail and just hang out there. I actually live on the ocean so it would be pretty cool. Pretty, pretty, cool.

So what's wrong here? Perhaps the writing and pacing. Things happen a little too fast at times. Conflicts are brought to a head before they've had a chance to percolate.. to cook down.. to fully enroll the audience in the suspense and get us emotionally involved. Twists in the plot occur without the proper foundation. For example in the final episode of season one a girl is about to get murdered in her bathroom, but suddenly a man comes through the door of the cabana and kills the would-be murderer. We know all the characters in the scene but we don't no why that one character showed up and stopped the crime in progress. We never saw the set up for how and why he knew where to go there. So with scenes like  that pulling you out of the show it's harder to care... harder to get fully invested.

Although the cast is wonderful and the acting good, the writers employ many stereotypical characters, and rather than reshape the well-worn cliches into something fresh, they tend to 'lean in' to the stereotype, rendering a caricature as opposed to a fully rounded character.

My only other beef with the series is that the so-called original score that opens the show is not all that original. It strikes me as a not so well disguised rip off of Henry Mancini's Lujon (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lujon/dp/B0013AMR0M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lujon</a>). The other music is superb though, and they changed the opening score in season 2, so who knows, maybe someone else noticed too.

It's a series I happily watched once. Maybe again, not sure. I am reminded of an old crime drama called CRIME STORY (Dennis Farina) that was set in this general period. It can be viewed repeatedly.",1492473600,2,3102,4.733333333333333
