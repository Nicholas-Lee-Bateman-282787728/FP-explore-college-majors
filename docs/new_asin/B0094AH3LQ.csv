8535786,5,B0094AH3LQ,"Powerful performance!  Highlights:  The intensity of Sylvie Valayre as Lady Macbeth (keep your hands away from the screen while she is singing or risk losing fingers!), and the isolation of Macbeth in his monologue 'Pieta, rispetto, onore.'  There are some weak points, but these two features make it a performance worth having.",1416096000,2,328,5.269230769230769
8535787,5,B0094AH3LQ,Once again  Nucci and company do an outstanding job. The dance sequence is one of the best I have seen in any opera so far. Bravo!!!!!!!,1376438400,,136,4.230769230769231
