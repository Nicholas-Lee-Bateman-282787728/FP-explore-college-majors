8277835,2,B001AK3S8U,"These 2 movies sucked, not worth buying. I like B movies done on a low budget but they gotta have a good story or good dialog. The sentinel & final days of earth get 2 stars, that's it not even a half star more.",1342569600,,211,3.8181818181818183
8277836,1,B001AK3S8U,"Both films are derivative, nonsensecal, just plain stupid, and even look terrible.  They are a complete waste of time and money.  Amazon should be ashamed for selling this junk.",1297728000,,177,5.068965517241379
8277837,3,B001AK3S8U,"The Last Sentinel is not super original.  Some robo-cops have taken over the Earth.  A super soldier teams up with a girl from the resistance to fight them.  The soldier talks to his rifle.  It talks back.  In fact the rifle is the most interesting character in the film. (Like Kitt, the car from Night Rider).  Katee Sackhoff's character never mentions her name.  Even on the IMDB, it is just listed as ""girl"".  I can live with scant character development, but this is ridiculous.  Even the rifle has a name...Angel. Mostly the film is a bunch of fighting sequences.  They tend to done rather well.  Some of the CGI special effects could stand a little more work though.  The 5.1 sound was actually great.  And even if The Last Sentinel wasn't very original, I liked it.

The Final Days of Planet Earth seems to be a two part mini-series, so don't freak-out when the end credits role at the end of part 1.  Part 2 is on the disc and will auto-play next.  Alien bugs are taking over the planet and a few humans band together to stop them.  Also not super original.  It seemed to be a little too long and dragged down in places.  But the CGI bugs were awesome.  This is some of the best CGI work I have seen.  And the 5.1 sound was also very good.

I spent good money on my surround speakers... it's nice to hear them once in a while.  And I did with both of these films. The Last Sentinel is a very solid 3 stars.  The Final Days of Planet Earth is weaker, but I might give 3 stars anyway.  (My scale: 2 stars is ok to watch once.  3 stars I might watch again.)",1262304000,5,1561,4.206779661016949
