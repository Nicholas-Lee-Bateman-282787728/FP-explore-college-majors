534681,3,630301402X,"POst lend lease film of American in Soviet Russia trying to smuggle ballerina out of country. After the second world war many large american stars spent an extended time in europe and actually couldn't return home for a certain amount of time to reap tax savings. I believe the intent was to popularize films make european films although there were some sucesses there were more failures, like Paratroper Black Knight and others. Part of the problem was the actors here rugged Gable is written differently than he would be back home. The charm of he man Gable films is usually the romance which has a realism to it, you come off believing him as sincere, as entering into relations and the films are elevated into a theatrical performance. I think his films stand well compared to modern actors, they often do not come off as well. Theres just a special quality and he may not even be a good actor its just these romances from the 1930's gaine dhim an audience, with men as well, and in typically american films the woman are relating with him in adventures throughout the fim they don't disappear. In another Russian type film(certainly no Ninotchka) Comrade X which is a better film this is a case. Here we have gene Tierney one of the better actrresses from the 50's, who's able to relay romance and sophistication in a very realistic manner although she never appeared on a poster had a special talent and maturity(as we see in the Left Hand of GOd) but the trouble is after  afew early romantic scenes she disappears and so does our interest in the film..since if she is not there and there are scenes with quips regarding Gable with various people on boats in europe and Finland..and in a scene with some Russian military where the discussion ranges around divergent tastes of booze..the writer doesnt know how to put this film together..and Tierney appears at the end and the film improves..but why not have her there all along..the romance doesnt click and the relationship has discussions on sociology, cities and is more of an escape film..like BEtrayed..which seems to be of interest at the time. After Betrayed and films like this, Gable ended his long association with Mayer and MGM, and apologized to his fellow stars for these types of films. The romance is just missing..the escape at films end is well done with DElmer Daves a competent and well regarded director/writer doing what he can with this script..escape war adventure films were common in the 60's..and quite long..sometimes too long..",1366416000,,2512,4.8013856812933025

534683,5,630301402X,"This is my personal favorite Gable Film. 1945,Moscow,VE Day. Clark is an American newspaper man who falls for Russian ballerina(Gene Tierney)Needless,to say,Clark is soon deported by the NKVD leaving Gene behind.
Great adventure story when Clark rents a boat to get into the USSR and get Gene out from behind the Iron Curtain. Of course,he has his problems with Red spies,storms,narrow escapes,and trading places with a Russian doctor to get into the theatre where Gene is performing.
Very underated Gable film.
Clark and Gene are more than a match for Joe Stalin.",1339804800,4,564,5.141304347826087

534685,5,630301402X,This movie should be reissued on DVD.  The adventure scenes may not always be credible but the romance is great!  Gene Tierney and Clark Gable had chemistry.  Another film of her's - The Left Hand Of God (with Humphrey Bogart) should also be published on DVD.,1150934400,9,259,4.586956521739131
534686,3,630301402X,"One of Clark Gable's older films, the plot is a bit convoluted, and really avoids what made him so big, for such a macho guy to make fun of himself. Choppy at times it still is worth seeing Gable and his beautiful co-star Gene Tierney.",995155200,5,235,4.2444444444444445

Good performances and location shooting make the film well-worth watching.  One flaw.  Clark Gable was older than the role required and it is most noticable.",1425772800,,295,5.391304347826087

7834414,4,630301402X,"Never Let Me Go did not receive high praises by critics when it was originally released; however I found it to contain all the elements of good entertainment.  There was a viable chemistry between Clark Gable and Gene Tierney in a ""May-September"" match-up.  Gable was still holding up nicely in his late forties and looked famously stunning in uniform---even a Soviet uniform.  There was enough action and at times it contains pre-Indiana Jones action and suspense.  Tierney's study of ballet for the role proves good, and as always, Gable holds his own as strong romantic leading man who saves his lady in the end.  Worth while.",1399766400,2,629,4.89622641509434
