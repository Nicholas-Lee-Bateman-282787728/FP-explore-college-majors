6290413,5,B00IS6WPVK,"Not only is this a beautiful film for the eyes, but it has so much
powerful character and story design. For an indie film, ""As High as the Sky"" does not have that
""let's be arty for the sake of being arty"" feel to it. It does not
pander to any one audience. You are drawn in immediately by mere
curiosity--you want to know more about these characters, especially
Margaret. The artful composition of writer-director Nikki Braendlin
compliments the powerful performances of the three lead actors. These
fully-developed female characters pull together an emotionally-charged
story that will have you in tears one moment, and giggling the next. I
couldn't stop thinking about this film. Still can't.",1398729600,4,695,5.0
6290414,5,B00IS6WPVK,"Really nicely written and beautifully shot. This is a quirky little character piece; funny and emotional. I've seen it many times at film festivals (where it received a number of audience awards). Each time I see it, I notice something new and learn a little bit more about the characters. It touches on the complexities of single-motherhood as well as the relationship between siblings.",1398124800,4,387,5.0625

6290418,2,B00IS6WPVK,"I enjoy a plot which is slow to develop, but this movie hinges on a plot point which requires the viewer to care about the characters. I tried but found them insipid and blah; the acting is self conscious and most lines delivered as if read from a teleprompter. I wanted to like this film but I just can't. However, the house in which most action takes place is great. All furnishings appear to have come from Target, but purchased by someone with decent taste. Gave me a few decorating ideas before I turned it off about fifteen min before the end.",1413072000,,549,4.392156862745098

6290420,5,B00IS6WPVK,"'As High As The Sky' is simply a lovely film. Certainly an emotional roller coaster, but all in all a film about relationships and finding one's self.

Margaret, played by Caroline Fogarty, is one of those women who it seems it would be difficult to live with. She moves around her very modern, minimalist home arranging and cleaning everything. She cleans each blade of a plant, and the she tenderly cuts each blade.  It turns out she is a Party Planner, and very successful at her job. She is attractive, slim, dresses very casually in free flowing clothes. We find out her partner, Matthew, has left her, and she does not know why. And, on this day, her sister, Josephine, played by Bonnie McNeil, with her  ten year old daughter, played by Laurel Porter, arrive on her doorstep. Josephine is the exact opposite of Margaret. She is outgoing, bohemian, and has traveled most if her life. Their parents died when Josephine was 17 and Margaret at age 4. There is an age and cultural gulf. But they are family, and Margaret welcomes them. It is a bumpy time for them all.

Most of this film centers in Margaret's home. It is large enough with a pool and beautiful back yard, so it does not feel claustrophobic. The emotionless Margaret who does not share her emotions easily is found talking on the phone with her two aunts, who brought her up. Their closed world has become Margaret's world, and the question is, will Margaret stay in this world?

Such a well directed and acted film. The child, played by Lauren a Porter, is extraordinary. You want to reach out and hug her on screen. Margaret and Josephine are family, and as the film proceeds we note how far apart they seem, but also how much they are trying to find each other.

6290427,1,B00IS6WPVK,"I have no idea why this movie was so highly rated.  I stopped watching it, because neither the lead character nor the story line are compelling in the least.  I like long, slow thoughtful movies, so when I say that I found this one boring, you can trust that that the average person it would be really, really boring.",1409788800,,317,4.3559322033898304
6290428,4,B00IS6WPVK,Overall this movie delivers lots of good stuff. Memories for one become stories to fill in the blanks for another and then new memories in the making to build on. Forgiveness and honest to goodness family lovin'. It was nice to just relax and enjoy without concerns about who can be in the room. Definitely a chick flick but we always need a good cry now and then along with a few good laughs! It's not going to take home any big awards but it was worth the time spent! Sit back and let this movie make you feel good.......,1409529600,,523,4.24

6290431,5,B00IS6WPVK,"I gave this movie 5 stars mostly because of the cast or I should say the 3 main characters.  The main character, a red head, has a unique visual and she unfolds...uncoils...from a tightness that has style to a warmness that fits her.  You could see where the movie was going after a short while, but still left you wondering if something else was going to happen. Good story, interesting acting. Hope to see the red head (McNeil) in something else that's for sure!",1406505600,,464,4.511904761904762

6290433,5,B00IS6WPVK,"I loved this beautifully shot story about love and family. When I found out the crew as well as cast was mostly women, I loved it even more.

Nikki Braendlin both wrote and directed this impressive piece (which has won many audience awards on the film festival circuit). It's hard to believe this is Braendlin's first effort, and I look forward to more from her.

I'd seen Caroline Fogarty on stage in comedic roles, and was already a fan. She didn't disappoint in this drama with her nuanced and affecting portrayal of a woman finding her heart again after loss.

The relationship between Bonnie McNeil and Laurel Porter as mother and daughter was beautiful as both actors delivered powerful performances.

The house in which the story unfolds became a character itself, and the cinematography is stunning.

I highly recommend As High as the Sky.",1405987200,3,847,4.854166666666667
6290434,5,B00IS6WPVK,"I was totally touched by this very unexpected film. Buy it, and you'll see why! It slaps you with struggles of the human existence, yet leaves you feeling empowered by the beautiful strength of friendship, womanhood, and humanity. Thank you, Nikki Braendlin, for this film that shows how people can get through childhood trauma and lapses of ""mental illness"" without the stigma typically shown in films. The acting was superb! We are uncomfortable with Margaret (Caroline Fogarty), for being difficult at first, but love and root for her at the same time. I am sure that we will be seeing a lot more of Caroline Fogarty, Bonnie McNeil, and Laurel Porter. Bravo!!",1405814400,3,662,4.919642857142857

6290449,5,B00IS6WPVK,"Emily Blunt over at BluntReview(dot)com says: What a glorious film. And, it's chickbabe driven behind and in front of the lens. Send the boys out. This one is for the ladies. Nothing will blow up and there's a lot of feeling here. 'Nough said?

Story goes...Margaret (Caroline Fogarty) has just gone through a bad break up. She is not coping so well. But her feelings are manifesting themselves in a nasty outbreak of OCD; she's in dire need of intense order from her immediate surroundings.

Hold on to that image... because in swings her older sister and niece, Josephine and Hannah (Bonnie McNeil and Laurel Porter) for an unannounced visit. And the duo is far from orderly. They are flamboyant, giddy, charming and boiling over with love and life. And, in a very real way, just what Margaret needed and dreads most.

As the audience, you know something is up, but can't quite foretell the story's end. Brilliant. When was the last time you did not see a film's direction ten minutes in? As High as the Sky draws you in and gets very emotionally intimate.

The characters are delightful, the performances each a caliber not seen very often in ""lower budget"" films. And when you watch the extras, which you must, you discover 17 days and capelinni noodle-like budgets can still a masterpiece make. That is because these gals - all the leads are women - are exquisite. Laurel Porter is going to break your heart, and both Fogarty and McNeill will be etched into your spirit; they are so real.

Writer director Nikki Braendlin has really created an emotional powerhouse of a story and managed to place it (gorgeously) within the confines of a beautiful set/home. And this lady has built up an arsenal of talents tinkling behind the words. First is composer Kristen Baum who gives each player their own theme no less); listen for the subtle instrument choices. In fact, every ""key"" person who worked on the film is a woman. That's very cool, and unusual. The extras have a quick-but-wonderful discussion about key elements that help As High as the Sky blossom. Director of photography, Tarin Anderson, explains her techniques and use of camera - and film students buy AHSTS if only for the three featurettes that offer glimpses into how to make a very personal quiet and moving film pop to life on a big screen.

Buy a few of these as you'll want to share it with your film club. You don't have one you sniff towards your iPad? Start here.

6290450,5,B00IS6WPVK,"I absolutely loved this movie. The characters are all so well rounded and unique. I felt like the actors were all such naturals, there was no ""acting"" involved, and they simply became their characters. You feel as if you're just a fly on the wall who gets to see intimate moments of their lives. The storyline is seamless and the movie just flows, due in large part to the writing and witty dialogue that is both funny and touching. It left me feeling like I wanted to see more of these characters, yet I was happy I ""met"" them.",1399766400,7,528,4.343434343434343
6290451,4,B00IS6WPVK,"This film is intimate and appealing to viewers who want a look into the lives of three females, two sisters and one young girl. The film is about the relationship between an OCD woman and her older, mostly estranged and free-spirited sister and their coming to terms with their divergent pasts and their present situations. Between the two sisters is the daughter of the older sister, the product of a drunken one-night stand and what to do with her once cancer overtakes her mother. OCD sister is not prepared for instant motherhood and is coming off of a bad breakup. Can she become the aunt and responsible person who can eventually raise a child? She lost her parents at age four, she has a lifetime of love to give and receive, lost from a lonely childhood where she was raised by two quirky aunts (only met via phone calls). The deep emotional hurts are revealed and met head on. The direction maintains the intimate feel and keeps the emotion where it belongs, in the home and between the three of them. A great, smaller budget film that inspires indie film-making.",1399161600,5,1072,4.647368421052631
6290452,5,B00IS6WPVK,"This film got under my skin and soon after began to haunt me.
It intrigued me from the very start with the obsessive compulsive clean and neat eccentric Margaret who's recently lost her boyfriend. New layers of mystery came when she got an unannounced visit from her older sister Josephine and niece Hannah. Two very compelling characters:  Josephine is seemingly more down-to-earth while Hannah has maturity beyond her years and a childish exuberance and love for life. The film's humor comes in unexpected places and likewise the moments of sheer sadness.
The most unexpected fact: ""As High As The Sky"" is a first-time writing/directing effort by former actress Nikki Braendlin.
Excellent choice for character film lovers!",1399161600,5,724,5.241379310344827

6290454,5,B00IS6WPVK,"AS HIGH AS THE SKY is just that. Tightly written, brilliant performances and well executed. A womans well-organized and regimented life is shattered when her carefree and happy go lucky sister and her daughters drop in unexpectedly. Heres a family drama that dares to give us some of the universal complexities of real life in an unapologetic way that is clear and realistic.
Nikki Braendlin writing gave us a brief and endearing peek behind the curtain of a person afflicted with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Caroline Forgarty shed her usual comedic actor persona and took on the dramatic role of Margaret with a no holds barred and head on performance. Bonnie McNeil nails it as Josephine, the not so neat as a pin sister.  Laurel Porters performance as Hannah, the precocious daughter of Josephine is priceless.
Well worth seeing it, I bought the DVD as a gift to my wife and I am happy to have seen it.",1399161600,9,908,4.82051282051282
6290455,5,B00IS6WPVK,"First time writer-director Nikki Braendlins As High as the Sky is a movie for the audience who wants to see something other than a studio tent-pole franchise. There is no nudity, foul language, violence or improbable car chase. You won't notice that those elements missing, because they weren't necessary for the story.  As High as the Sky is funny, sad, inspiring, offbeat yet conventional, but most of all extremely well-made. The cast, led by a wonderful Caroline Fogarty (Big Love) are all female. The cinematographer, editor and composer are female. The producers are female. While the movie has a feminine sensitivity, As High as the Sky is not a womens movie. It is not girls night out.  Its not a movie about gender politics. As High as the Sky is just a delightful narrative film that youll probably enjoy if you like movies. As High as the Sky was privately financed, but made under union contracts and filmed entirely in Los Angeles.",1398988800,3,944,4.820987654320987
