4465683,5,B004TGUN6M,This video is excellent.  My four children have seen it and each has significantly improved their stroke.  I've seen many swim videos in the past but none compare to the Race Club Fundamentals.,1317772800,,193,4.818181818181818
4465684,5,B004TGUN6M,I purchased this for myself and my son last winter.  I started swimming at 39 and he just started at age 8.  We both benefited from gaining a fundamental understanding of how just how big a role drag plays for a moving object in the water and finding ways to be slippery through it.,1317772800,,282,4.203703703703703
4465685,5,B004TGUN6M,"A very engaging instructional video by Gary Hall, Sr, an atypical video, relative to all of the instructional videos you can purchase.

Gary strategically steps you through the reasons, building you up to an efficient machine that will guarantee improvement, from wherever your beginning point may be with this video.

All in a nice concise format, where you will never lose your attention, nor your interest in what is being taught.

There are plenty of drills, and sequence of drills introduced to build you up through the lessons. This covers not just the crawl, but translates the same ideas to the other strokes.

It is not just a do this and you go fast, but explains thoroughly the how and whys.

This DVD is definitely a worthwhile investment for your library, as well as for review.

Thank you Gary.",1317600000,,808,4.776978417266187
4465686,5,B004TGUN6M,"I recently purchased the Fundamentals of Fast Swimming DVD to help me with my swim portion of the triathlon.  I was a high school swimmer and a rescue swimmer in the Navy, so I am a decent swimmer and usually come out of the water in the top 10 of my age group.  I was looking for some tips to give me that extra edge and I got them.  The DVD goes through all of the basics of the Freestyle stroke that i needed.  No detail is left out.  I was able to learn quite a bit about arm postioning, how to guide your hand entry, and turnover rate to name a few.  The Hall's have spent a lifetime in swimming and it shows in this DVD.  The video of swimmers demonstrating the proper stroke technique is flawless and shown from multiple angles.  Every couple of months, I rewatch the video to help me reinforce my techniqueI was extremely happy with my purchase and would recommend it to swimmers of all levels.",1319155200,2,902,4.203488372093023
4465687,4,B004TGUN6M,"Fundamentals of Fast Swimming really helped me break through and improve as a swimmer.  I had been a poor triathlon swimmer for 20 years despite learning a lot from TI and lessons.  The things I learned from this disk were key to my FINALLY figuring out how to swim fast.  The disk has great video shots that clearly show proper body position and how to do the things you need to do to swim fast.  It is broken up into logical chapters and makes it easy to apply in the pool. I watch it at least a couple times a year in order to refresh my memory.  Highly, highly recommended.",1319068800,,577,4.209090909090909
4465688,5,B004TGUN6M,"Hi,
As a master swimmer i think the video was really helpful. Really think that its a strong learning tool for every swimmer. Congratulations to every one in The Race Club staff for this amazing video! After seeing this video I`m realy thinking about going to one of The Race Club Camps, so i can improve my technique even more.",1318204800,,328,4.483333333333333
4465689,5,B004TGUN6M,"If you want to get better in the water whether it be triathlons, masters swimming or just recreational swimming, Gary Hall Sr can help you.  The Fundamentals of Fast Swimming dives right into the important tools you need to make serious progress in your swimming. You can watch this DVD over and over and you can continue to find new tips!  Well done The Race Club.",1318204800,2,365,4.515151515151516
4465690,5,B004TGUN6M,"I bought this video a year ago and it surprise me a lot. I am working in swimming as a coach for almost 10 years and watching this DVD I could take a big number of new elements for my program. The Race Club is a innovative club, and the DVD goes by the same way, innovative and very interesting.",1318118400,,295,3.933333333333333
4465691,5,B004TGUN6M,"We use this DVD for our senior swimmers who are more technically advanced however, for the younger kids in our club, this is a very good learning tool and you will see results in a matter of practices and the dividends during/at your next meet....if you want results...watch and get your kids on track to better, technically sound speed.",1318118400,,337,4.728813559322034
4465692,5,B004TGUN6M,The concepts explained in this video has helped my daughter Jessica (Age Group swimmer) become a faster swimmer.  The concepts are explained in a clear concise formate.  The video is very motivational and interesting.  Jessica watches this video a few times each season to remind herself of what she needs to work on in practice and in racing.  I would highly recommend this video to anyone that is serious about swimming.,1318032000,,422,4.901408450704225
4465693,5,B004TGUN6M,"We picked these DVDs up in person as my daughter attended Race Club twice in Florida a few years ago.  She will be a Division 1 college swimmer next year and is an All-American in 3 strokes. I credit Race Club with much of her success. My daughter found the videos very informative and motivational. The DVDs were a great investment, and consider attending Race Club as well. Gary's experience (3 time Olympian) and hands-on instruction are invaluable.",1317772800,,452,4.794871794871795
4465694,5,B004TGUN6M,We have purchased several different swim stroke DVD's over the years and none has done as good a job as this DVD in explaining the concepts of drag and inertia and how to overcome drag in your stroke technique. My son is a competitive swimmer and has improved his technique and dropped time in all 4 strokes due to what he has learned from Gary's DVD.,1317772800,,351,4.333333333333333
4465695,5,B004TGUN6M,"I didn't really start swimming until I was about 18 years old and when I did I would just swim frequently hoping my form would smooth out. My form improved, but very slowly. I've had the DVD for about a year now and I'm able maintain my form and speed despite not having a chance to get in the pool as often as I used to. The reason is because I now focus on quality, not quantity. This DVD helped me realize what I should think about as I move through the water and makes every minute spent in the pool more valuable. I would recommend this DVD to people who did not grow up swimming and want to improve their overall stroke.

As an added bonus, Gary is very accessible and regularly posts on online forums to provide insight on swimming technique.",1317772800,,749,4.2377622377622375
8440659,3,B004TGUN6M,"Not much to it. I think just about all of this is available on YouTube. The main difference being targeting specific drills for each of the few main principles for fast swimming. If not for his credentials definitely not worth the money. If you're a newbie it's not for you. But didn't know if this was my DVD or what but the volume went from very low while he was talking at times to much louder - and unnecessary - music. Bottom line: should be longer with more detailed demonstrations with great swimmers. Also, he states high elbow is principal to reducing drag. However, there was an article a year ago in the NY TIMES about high elbow vs deep pull. Very good article that you can easily google.",1373932800,,700,4.434108527131783
8440660,1,B004TGUN6M,"there is maybe about 10 minutes of substantive information in this 31-minute dvd, maybe less. what's the purpose of underwater nature scenes of fish, or swimmers doing exercises out of the water, with no commentary but new-agey music? i don't understand all the 5-star ratings. they must be friends or students of the narrator. save your money. here's a four-point take-away: look down, not forward, in the freestyle stroke; begin the pull stroke with elbow high along surface of water; ''roll'' the body with each stroke -- don't keep torso parallel to bottom of pool while propelling yourself; and manage six kicks per stroke.",1365724800,9,628,5.048076923076923
8440661,3,B004TGUN6M,"There are a few good points, but for the most part, there wasn't a real technical discussion or plan of what to tell a swimmer to do.",1365033600,2,133,3.962962962962963
8440662,3,B004TGUN6M,"This video is for more advanced swimmers. The video does not discuss racing dives or flip turns which I consider techniques in the fundamentals of fast swimming. There were some excellent recommendations on how to reduce drag and increase speed for more advanced swimmers. If you already know all four basic swim strokes, this video will help you improve speed. This video is very short and does not cover as many swim techniques as I expected for my beginning racer.",1361318400,,467,4.85
8440663,5,B004TGUN6M,"I swam in college in the early 90's and bought this as I have young kids that are now beginning to swim competitively.  I wanted to modernize my knowledge with the current techniques employed at the highest levels of swimming today so that I could teach my kids properly.  This video was extremely helpful.  I wish I had it 30 years ago.  I've been working in the pool myself relearning how to swim and have also been working with my kids.  It has definitely helped and times have dropped quite significantly.  I personally could do without the music and non-instructive filler material some others seem to enjoy but I feel makes the video longer than  is necessary as I want to watch repeatedly with my kids for reinforcement purposes.  Please produce more on other strokes and especially, one on coaching/training!",1354838400,2,816,4.7785714285714285
8440664,5,B004TGUN6M,"I was a competitive swimmer and watched this DVD to improve my technique.
Gary Hall Sr does a great job in exlaining the important things which can improve your swimming. It is suitable for all athletes (swimmers, triathletes) frome sprinters to long-distance and can give you an edge in your competitive performance. Especially the reasoning behind the explained thoughts is perfectly clear and you are easily able to understand it and transfer it into the water.
If you are looking for a clear and precise guide on how to improve your swimming (no matter what level) this DVD is the right one for you.",1327449600,2,603,4.8076923076923075
8440665,5,B004TGUN6M,"This DVD is a well engineered teaching tool that continues to be helpful to our young swimmers as they aspire to higher levels in the competitive swimming universe. We all appreciate the lessons that are being put forth by Dr. Hall for swimmers of all levels and ages. There is very little literature or training material available for swimmers that are trying to technically improve, and the coaching instruction at most levels is woefully inadequate. This DVD fills a gap that we have found very useful.  We also find that repeated review of the DVD provides reinforcement and encouragement for our children. Thic is a terrific supplement to pool time, and certainly is far less mundane and boring than any that I have seen. Thank you so much for putting forward a helpful and user friendly instrument for all levels.  Thank you so much for your considerable effort in supporting our swimmers!",1321747200,3,895,4.881578947368421
8440666,5,B004TGUN6M,"Over the past year I've been trying to learn as much as I can about coaching swimming.  My daughter and some of her friends used to swim for a swim club that had become little more than an ATM for the head coach.  So, I learned what I could so that I could become a coach myself and help some little kids achieve 100% personal bests without wasting six days a week and thousands of dollars a year at the pool.  Also, to survive Ironman triathlons myself, I've had to crank up my own swimming proficiency.

This DVD captures in a nutshell what every swimmer needs to do to be able to swim faster.  A strong emphasis on streamlining, to which is added the importance of a high elbow catch and recovery, kicking, and hip rotation.  A huge strong point is the many specific drills.  My nine-year-old daughter watched the DVD and, after a few snickers about the avant garde music, went off to master the drills that Gary Sr. highlighted in the DVD.  Then she had 100% personal bests in her next swim meet.

There are lots of swimming DVDs out there that provide helpful tips, of which I probably own a third.  What this DVD adds is this:  a VERY high-yield, concise presentation of essential techniques that have previously been articulated by other authorities such as Terry Laughlin and Ernest Maglischo, to which is added the street cred of someone who's won Olympic Gold himself and who regularly coaches some of the world's best swimmers.",1319846400,,1438,4.556420233463035
8440667,5,B004TGUN6M,"Gary Sr. stresses a few simple, easy to understand, techniques that can make ALL the difference in your freestyle.
Great way to better understand the key elements to moving through the water in the most efficient way possible.
Very helpful for anyone looking to really have a more complete control of their movements through the water.",1319587200,,335,5.0
8440668,5,B004TGUN6M,"I purchased both Race Club DVD's - the Fundamentals of Fast Swimming and The Three Styles of Freestyle. They are very interesting, and probably the least boring swimming instructional/drill dvd's out there. I have a rather large library of vhs/dvd swimming videos and these are my favorite to watch. There is actually pretty cool cinematography to go along with very useful information. Our team actually sat down and watched the videos the other day and were able to stay focused and pick up great information that they were able to experiment with in practice later that day. We had talked about the 3 styles of freestyle in the past and they had trouble putting it into practice but after watching the video they were able to have much improved application.",1319500800,,760,4.8538461538461535
