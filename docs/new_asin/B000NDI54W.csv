8177455,1,B000NDI54W,"I was dissapointed with this video. Many things said in it are known to be wrong. For example, they credit Roy Brown as the one who shot down Richtofen. It is well known that the trajectory of the bullet that killed him came from the ground, probably from an Australian gunner (as is well explained and documented in an excellent Nova documentary).

Also, this video repeats many films that have been shown over and over (obviously, there is no new footage of Richtofen). Unfortunately, there is nothing interesting here. There is a long interview of the very polite German Commander of the current Richtofen Squadron, where he gives many facts about his squadron, it's history and origins plus Richtofen information, but unfortunately there is nothing really interesting or new there.

Look somewhere else for an interesting documentary on the Red Baron.",1293408000,3,855,5.056737588652482
8177456,1,B000NDI54W,Spent most of the time watching boring interviews. Not enough film about Richthofen or pictures. A lot of factual errors. The funeral clip is not even that of von Richthofen!,1178841600,22,174,4.833333333333333
