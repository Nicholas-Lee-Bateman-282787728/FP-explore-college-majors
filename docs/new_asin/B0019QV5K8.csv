8275049,5,B0019QV5K8,"I remember renting this movie over 25 years ago. It wasn't as exciting as the Rod Taylor/George Pal 1960s version, but it grows on you. I would love to see it on DVD or Blue Ray! John Beck is a great time traveler, and Andrew Duggan is a good modern villian. The evils of any type of nuclear war have to be continually held before the eyes of the world in order to show all people that it is something that must not happen at all costs.

It is a nice feature of remakes that they put in actors that appeared in earlier versions. Whit Bissell appears in this version as Alan Young appeared in the 2002 version--both Bissel and Young were in the 1960 George Pal movie.

John Beck is likable, and you really enjoy being with him on his journey. Fellow movie buffs, have Schick Sunn reissue this as a DVD/Blue Ray!",1265760000,4,810,4.253246753246753
