7876011,4,6304672993,"I love Petra.  She's a bundle of energy and creativity.  I'm not entirely impartial here; with a 25 year long background in exercise physiology, I've crossed paths with her and taken workshops with her a number of times over the years.  I am a highly experienced exercise instructor with a dance background, and I find the complexity of her steps and combinations challenging, but not physically demanding.  Someone without my background, however, would probably have a very difficult time with this.  She is not as adept at cuing as Gin Miller, so a beginner has to be patient and do this routine many times before catching on.  I am now retired from my profession and bought this as a routine to do on my ""rest"" days (I do high impact, high intensity interval routines on ""workout"" days).  As a professional, I do not recommend this for someone overweight and inexperienced with exercise.  It's exactly the type of routine that frustrates and causes people to drop out of an exercise program.  If, however, you're looking for something to spice-up what's starting to become routine and boring for you, this is it!",1289347200,,1115,4.826315789473684
7876012,3,6304672993,"This video is a good starting place for new ""floor aerobics"" exercisers.  It's challenging but not too hard and some parts are tedious (she does the same move over and over when you already had it 4 reviews ago).  I've been doing video workouts for over 3 years, this one I do maybe once every 3 months then stow it away again.  She has 2 guys in her ""class"", one of them just can't catch on and it's very annoying to watch him constantly screwing up.

If you're looking for a beginner's video this would be a good choice, lots of repetition, not a lot of fancy moves.",1102550400,,568,4.231481481481482
