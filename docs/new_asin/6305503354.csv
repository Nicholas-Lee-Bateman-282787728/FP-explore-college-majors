1044579,2,6305503354,"I heartily agree with what every other reviewer says about Eli Hollander's ""Deadly Drifter."" What a horribly confusing, absurdist film! Then I noticed the picture also goes by the title ""Out,"" and that someone named Ronald Sukenick wrote the screenplay based on a novel by, not surprisingly, Ronald Sukenick. Hmmm. Well, the obtuseness of the film inspired me to launch an Internet excursion in the hope that I would discover the idea behind this bizarre motion picture. I first searched for everything I could find on the film itself, under ""Deadly Drifter"" and then ""Out."" All I found were several angry movie reviews blasting Hollander's effort. Then I stumbled over a throwaway line somewhere that said ""Deadly Drifter"" is a satire of American radicalism. Aha! Unless you've seen the film, you can't imagine how much that one line helps to clear up a few of the mysteries surrounding this odd little movie. When I did a search for Ronald Sukenick, I understood even more. He's an avant-garde fiction writer, which means he writes nonsense and passes it off as serious literature. Whatever. If you think ""Deadly Drifter"" the film is weird, you haven't seen anything until you read the first few pages of ""Out.""

""Deadly Drifter"" stars Peter Coyote as Rex, a man caught up in a giant conspiracy. When we first meet up with Rex, he's toting dynamite and climbing around on a rooftop with fellow revolutionary Nixie (O-Lan Shepard). The two speak through thoughts, imploring each other not to fall and other nonsense as they look through a window just in time to see a woman with a knife cutting out a man's tongue. Confused yet? Don't worry; you will be within seconds. The movie then switches focus to a meeting of Rex's and Nixie's revolutionary cell. Carl (Jim Haynie), Jojo (Danny Glover), Arnold (Michael Grodenchik), and Trixie (Gail Dartez) sit around a table worrying about infiltration by agents, muse about ""The Commissioner,"" and talk about how important it is to contact the Old Man on the West Coast. They spell out secret messages using letters taken from bowls of alphabet soup, and then eat the message afterwards so the agents won't know what they're up to. Yes, I know how it sounds, but I didn't write the book or the screenplay. Anyway, most of the dialogue in these scenes falls in the category of paranoid delusional with characters questioning other characters about their ""real"" identities and accusing each other of being agents. Then they all leave Greenwich Village to head out on various missions that will take them to the West Coast.

Did I mention that the movie counts down from ten to zero, with each number representing a stage of the exodus west? We go from Greenwich Village to Newark, New Jersey to Central City, Iowa to Lincoln, Kansas to Colorado Springs, Colorado to ""The Mountains"" to Yucca Falls, Nevada to Venice, California to a Fourth of July celebration on the beach. Again, I didn't write the book or the screenplay. In each of these locations Rex encounters his former Greenwich Village compatriots, but this time they have different names and often don't recognize him. The scenes start to blur into total nonsense, but a few do stand out. For instance, Rex marries Nixie somewhere in the Midwest, the two spend their honeymoon in a hotel room, and make a big deal about dining on tongue (!). The most memorable segment involves Rex's encounter with an Indian named Empty Fox (Grandfather Semu Haute). The two talk about their boots and cars before ambling out into the deep woods for a peyote session that results in Rex's ability to recite passages from the Book of Jonah in an Indian language. The conclusion to the film finds the group reuniting on the beach in jovial spirits, not because they finally found the Old Man but because they can read minds and are now members of a flaky New Age group called the Institute for Creative Unity.

Wow! You haven't seen confusing until you watch ""Deadly Drifter."" Once I learned that the movie dealt with left-wing radicals, it made sense on one level. Many 1960s nuts did start out preaching revolutionary claptrap and blowing up stuff only to move into Native American rituals and New Age daffiness as the Summer of Love gave way to the dreary 1970s, and their transitions between belief systems were quick and not easily understandable to sane individuals. In that context ""Deadly Drifter"" does make some sense. But it's all lost under mountains of impenetrable dialogue and a plodding pace that almost forced me to fling my DVD player out the window. By the way, what's up with the title ""Deadly Drifter""? I can only conclude that someone thought the title would convince people they were renting a horror or an action film. ""Out"" is a far better title, as in ""I'm OUT of my mind to watch this movie"" or ""I'm OUT of luck trying to understand where this thing is going"" or ""You're watching Deadly Drifter? I'm getting OUT of here."" Too, putting Danny Glover's mug on the cover is a bit misleading since his part as one of Rex's rarely seen compatriots is a small one.

Hats off to Ronald Sukenick and director Eli Hollander for making a film that ranks as one of the biggest wastes of celluloid in motion picture history. The DVD version I watched contained only a trivia game as an extra. Yep, a trivia game. Are you kidding me? You expect me take a test after watching this mishmash? I'd have a better chance reading the Chinese translation of ""War and Peace"" than figuring out answers to questions dealing with ""Deadly Drifter."" I would probably watch the film again if Hollander did a commentary track for it, though. O.K., I likely wouldn't watch this one again under any circumstances. Stay far away, folks. FAR, far away!",1112227200,18,5727,4.781818181818182
1044580,1,6305503354,"If you liked the Blair Witch Project, you'll LOVE this inane waste of atoms!  The other reviewer who cited the inclusion of Danny Glover on the DVD cover as a hoped-for celebrity draw is right.  He must have been hard-up at the time, & ditto for all participants!!One star really overrates this abomination.",1072483200,2,307,4.773584905660377
1044581,1,6305503354,"""Out"" is part of the Hollywood genre where the audience is bombarded with chaos, leaving the majority of the audience confused and the snooty artistic types smugly thinking ""The common folk just don't get it.""  In this case, however, there is nothing to get.  The hero wanders aimlessly through the movie, unhampered by even the barest elements of a cohesive plot.  Strange things happen without explanation. For example, in one scene the hero puts a lit stick of dynamite in his mouth.  After it goes off his personality changes, okay.  Strangeness can be a great asset  to a movie (i.e. Brazil) but the audience needs to be able to relate to what is happening on the screen to some degree.  ""Out"" does not even allow that.  Overall the film plays like the producer's own practical joke rather than a movie, and as such it has nothing to recommend it.",1009152000,4,852,4.671140939597316
1044582,2,6305503354,"Danny has a very small role in this 1982 independent film, so I suspect his inclusion on the jacket is because of his recent popularity - in other words - just to sell the DVD. The best performance comes from O- Lan Shepard (O-Lan Jones), who is not listed on the CD. Her role provides the only semblance of a plot in this othwise pointless film. She is also a viable addition for the reasons Peter points out in in the course of the film. The drifter (Peter Coyote) is seen in each of 10 scenes which count down from 10 to 1. They seem to point out in absurdist terms the pointlessness of life as a man with early stages of ESP drifts from venue to venue encountering slimly related mini-plots. Some of the transitions would have required a Star Trek-like transporter to work. Characters reappear like themes in a cyclic symphony, feeding on the main characters paranoia and lack of direction. If you just love absurdist theatre, you might actually like this one a little. If not, stay home.",997401600,2,992,4.486187845303867
7891128,1,6305503354,"Two of us watched this all the way through and then looked at each other and said ""that was the worst film we have seen in twenty years""  Not exactly a shining moment for Peter Coyote and Danny Glover. I hope the checks didn't bounce.",1481414400,,234,4.2

7891130,1,6305503354,"Please know right off the bat that my rating of one star for this movie is totally unfair and not right. ""Deadly Drifter"" is nowhere near worthy of one star. But since Amazon requires at least one star for a rating when you write a review I have no choice then to be so generious with this rating. This is a totally bizarre, weird, confusing, obtuse and most of all unentertaining movie! Still if that is how you love your movies then this is the flick for you. In all fairness I probably shouldn't review this sorry excuse of a movie considering it was so bad I gave up trying to watch and understand the movie or what the plot was about, assuming there is a plot to it, about halfway through. There is no rhyme or reason to the story and I figured if halfway through this mess there was still no hint of a plot or any logic the best thing to do was give up wasting precious time out of my life watching such garbage. If you have an open mind and want to take a shot at watching this film then go for it. If you do watch it and can understand what the HELL is going on in the film then please please please write a review in Amazon on it and explain to the rest of us who don't get it what ""Deadly Drifter"" is suppose to be about. I am willing to guess however you will most likely be just as befuddled and confused by it as the rest of us. Just remember you have been warned!",1346889600,,1377,4.029197080291971
7891131,2,6305503354,"...it's obvious why. This has got to be the worst movie I've ever sat through, but it has some surprisingly redemptive qualities. The most obvious is getting to enjoy all these reviews afterwards - the best laugh I've had in a while. The story itself had potential (conceptually if not in how it was realized), and could perhaps be great if done completely differently (and I mean completely!). As it is, it comes across like a high school film project (conceived in committee from a mishmash of immature friend's psychedelic experiences) with adult actors somehow hoodwinked into donating their time....(oh, those oblivious parents).

But amid the disjointed Dadaist surrealism there is something remarkable and worth seeing here, and that is the Humpback Whale mother and child footage. These are some of the best close up whale images I have ever seen - seriously. While the rest of the movie is ponderously satiric and inessential these whales are the real deal. Like the sweet and perfect lotus arising from a sewer filled swamp they are sublime and unlikely - amazing in themselves, and perhaps even in what they are used to signify here, whatever that is....",1308960000,,1165,4.9743589743589745
7891132,1,6305503354,"Anyone who can pretend to ""review"" this ... I can't even call it a ""movie ... is fooling himself, herself and anyone reading these reviews.  I picked up this piece of garbage in a rec room where I live and only because of the title and the ""stars.""  That's about all the appeal this film has to offer mankind.  It doesn't make ANY statement, the acting is HORRIBLE, there is absolutely NO plot, theme, story or ANYTHING.  My father was a cinematographer in Hollywood and made some pretty bad movies, but THIS movie is on my all-time GARBAGE LIST.  A 5-year old with a Barney Video Camera could have done a better job!  I can only imagine that Peter Coyote is either completely EMBARRASSED by his participation in this mess, or he was on some major drugs when it was being made.  Don't even waste your time trying to conjur up some sort of mystic ""between the lines"" message or some ""New Age"" enlightening.  All you will be doing is making YOURSELF look stupid.  Coining a phrase from another movie ... if you watch this movie through to the end, ""YOU MUST BE STUPID, STUPID STUPID!""  Oh, and Danny Glover should hide this somewhere deep and dark too .... he must have been hungry and broke at the time to take on this project.",1262044800,,1226,4.433035714285714

I think that when artist's use alot of metephors some of them strike home, even if it wasn't the intending meaning the artist was trying to convey. my favorite line in the movie was right at the end when the girl said ""I went swimming....I cant swim"" I took it to mean living is what mankind is comfronted with however we don't seem to have the skills to handel this effectively, of cource it may have meant something totally different. anyway I appluad the movie for streatching out of the ordinary massage of the testicals or adrenaline glands that many movies are replicating over and over again.",1175126400,2,676,4.549180327868853

See it -- it's almost certain Hartley has, and if he has not, it certainly anticipated him. It's too bad this thing appears to have fallen into the public domain, because I would LOVE to see a widescreen print and some kind of commentary from director Hollander and the book's author Ronald Sukenick. As things stand, it seems to be available in full screen prints from every budget label currently producing DVDs -- the one I got isn't even listed on Amazon anymore. I'd be very grateful if someone in the know could recommend the best version, particularly if a widescreen print is available.",1146268800,,695,4.612903225806452

Without his informing me that this was a satire of American radicalism, I would have guessed it was somebody's high school film project - that got an F.  I'd give it a zero, but this system won't go that low.

The question the movie leaves me and the friends who sat through this is why would Danny Glover or Peter Coyote agree to this project?",1139184000,3,435,4.280487804878049
7891136,5,6305503354,"Deadly Drifter, is a fantastic movie. I find

a Gnostic Christian theme, running entirely

through it, from beginning, to end. The script

is fabulous, and symbolic, in my opinion, and

is an early version of The Matrix. Again, as

in the movie ""Small Time"", we have an Indian

man, very knowledgeable, and somewhat magical,

who shares his views about life, with Peter

Coyote's character. Tommy the tourist,

obviously a dark force, is eliminated, due to

his evil inclinations. I believe he represents

an Archon of the Demiurge, of Gnostic texts.

The Old Man, is the Demiurge. The commissioner

I believe, represents the True God, who none

of the characters ever meet, due to their

hylic, and psychic states. The characters meet

their demise, and are eventually reincarnated.

They come together on the beach, where they

have a barbecue, and talk about old times.

Peter Coyote's character, (now in the Pneumatic

Condition)- finds the way out..The Way Out Of

The Material Illusion.

This movie is filled with symbolism, and is

well worth watching many times.",1130198400,6,1070,5.022988505747127

""One day I am Rex, the next day Carl.""  His friends change roles as the movie progresses as well.  The time traveling between numbers represents time spent in the Bardo.  We see examples of continuation Karma as well as boomerang karma.  In the end we see the soul's development as it finally embraces detachment.  This is a great movie for those who have eyes to see and ears to hear.",1121299200,3,537,4.760869565217392
