8357584,4,B00295SL00,"It was great to see Raymond Burr again, playing the part of Ironside.  This is a classic that, among other things,  showcases the disabled, otherwise at that time, known as handicapped.  Life goes on even with Ironside being confined to a wheelchair.  Just like the tv show ""Emergency"" that changed America forever by demonstrating the need for emergency vehicles and personnel, the show Ironside was groundbreaking.  Just because you can't walk any longer doesn't mean your life is over.  so between solving cases, he brings to light the possibilites.",1379289600,,552,5.146067415730337
8357585,5,B00295SL00,"Hi, I purchased this dvd as a gift for my Mom.  She loved Raymond Burr when he played Perry Mason years ago, as well I did myself.  Then when he started playing Ironside, she of course started to watch that show too.  In fact she had a big collection of his t.v. show's, but they were all on vhs tape's at the time.  Now, she has started to collect dvd's in the place of all her old show's that she used to watch.  I have already purchased a few of the Ironside series for her, and she continues to watch them from time to time in between her many other favorite t.v. show's she now has on dvd too.  She's really enjoying these old program's.  Thanks!",1368057600,,651,4.119047619047619
8357586,4,B00295SL00,"Though I remember watching this series on TV and enjoying it, and still do, it is not nearly as good as the Perry Mason black and white TV series nor the Perry Mason made-for=TV movies of the 70s and 80s (?). Saying that, Ironside is still much better than most of the shows on TV today (well, except for NCIS and Bones). Most of the old TV dramas are better than the vulgar violent shows on TV these days.",1366156800,,406,4.151898734177215

8357588,5,B00295SL00,"This is one of the great TV pilots. One TV reviewer called it: ""Classy, well done"". He was right, too. There are several episodes on the DVD but I frankly haven't looked at any of the others. It's the great pilot episode that I wanted, for my DVD library. The image quality is a little soft, about like a VHS tape, but it's been 45 years and God only knows how many prints have been made for syndication. I'm not big on cop shows generally, but this pilot is first rate. Highly recommended.",1336953600,,490,4.279569892473118
8357589,3,B00295SL00,Looking at Ironside in the 80s and now - 2 different things altogether.  The tech and special effects today makes the movie wanting but nevertheless ... who does not love Ironside huh?  Raymond Burr does a wonderful job,1252886400,3,219,4.7368421052631575
