6734593,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"I have quite a few of Leslie's work out programs.  This one really takes it up a step!  A great workout.  Hits muscle groups that previously have not been addressed by her other workout programs.  Love it! By the way, I'm 61 and this is not too hard for me to do!  Thank you for another great work out.",1361059200,174,302,4.0508474576271185
6734594,3,B00OBQ9PDC,"It's nice to throw in some new moves, and Leslie does so, but just a gentle warning - this one is more high impact than her regular walking DVDs.  Thinking it may be a bit too high impact for me at my current weight, but will save it for later when/if I can shed a few pounds.  A little ""dancier"" than her other workouts.  Not bad - but more of a challenge to the joints.",1360972800,130,371,3.92
6734595,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"This is a great workout from Leslie but it is more of an ""advanced"" walk.  I wouldn't start with this work out if you are new to her DVD's.  It is faster paced- and a lot of her moves are new.  It really does get your heart rate up.

What I really like about it is that the DVD gives you lots of options- you can play the 2 mile walk with the 2 floor Ab sessions at the end, just play the walk, or just go straight to either of the ab sessions.

I think this DVD is worth it alone for the ab workouts.  They are definitely challenging but the moves are in themselves simple and easy to follow.  If you do not have the strength and endurance to complete as many sets as Leslie is doing, build up to that.  But the moves are in no way complicated.  Take it from me- I am an uncoordinated spaz and I can follow these.

This will go into my rotation when I am looking for a really high energy and stimulating walk and I am going to use it for the ab work outs themselves as well.

All in all a great workout from Leslie.",1360800000,9,1016,3.883495145631068
6734596,5,B00OBQ9PDC,I have purchased several of Leslie DVD's therefore i was looking for something by her a little more challenging.  I recieved an email regarding another one of Leslie's new DVD so I was looking for that one  and found this one due reading a previous review.  It was everything that the person discribe so i decided to purchase this one.  Plus my mid section is an area I'm working on.  This is the best DVD...some new moves..little more challenge ..30 mins go so quickly.  I love it getting ready to work out now.  You won't be sorry.  She also include an added section on toning which is great.,1360540800,13,594,4.435185185185185
6734597,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"I have 2 other DVDs by Leslie:  'Walk Away the Pounds' and 'Burn Body Fat'.  I turned to Leslie's DVDs about 7 weeks ago when I decided that it was too cold to drive to the gym.  I thought working out at home would be easier than having to warm up my car, worry about snow/ice, then drive back home.  I'm happy to report that this new DVD, Belly Blasting Walk, is great.  I know it will keep me motivated to remain moving in the comfort of my own family room.

I'm in my 40s, have little time to ""work out"" and hate to sweat.  Leslie's DVDs actually get me moving (and yes, sweating) and wow - the DVDs help the time pass by so quickly that I can't even use the 'too busy' excuse.

In 7 weeks I've gone from a BMI of 28 to 25 (still overweight, but nearly 'normal').  More importantly though, I've lost inches around my waistline.  My pants fit more comfortably, my buns are more firm and I'm losing my upper arm jiggle.  I've only used this 'Belly Blasting Walk' DVD twice but am happy to report it is better than the other two DVDs of Leslie's that I have.  I'm certain I'll continue to lose weight & inches.  (And I want to mention that I started eating more sensibly about 8 weeks ago, increasing my fresh fruit & veggie intake, cutting carbs, etc.  But eating better gives me more energy to do my exercise DVDs.  It's a good viscious cycle!)",1360022400,171,1346,4.203125
6734598,4,B00OBQ9PDC,"I have one other Leslie Sansone DVD (Walk Away the Pounds Ultimate Collection) and I bought this one at Target a few weeks ago.  This fast, 2 mile cardio workout is much higher intensity and higher impact than the other one.  It's a 30 minute ""fast 2 miles"" with the middle 10 minutes or so devoted to a calorie-burning ""boost"" that asks you to jog in place, jog a few steps up and back, jump, and do other moves that get you up on your toes.  You can modify to a lower impact if you want.  I love the twist and reach movements to target my obliques.  I feel like I've had a real workout after this.  In addition to the cardio, there are 2 different core strengthening and sculpting floor routines; one that targets your front core (abs, obliques) and one that targets your back core (glutes, back).  She doesn't do as much talking (other than instructing) on this one as she does in the other DVD I have.  My only complaint is that the participants on the video are all young women (all appear to be under 30) who already seem to be pretty fit, and some of them look like models.  I appreciate the diversity of her ""workout friends"" on the other DVD.  I like to see people of all ages and body types demonstrating the exercises.  Other than that, this is a good, solid, satisfying workout.",1359590400,456,1290,4.333333333333333
6734599,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"I purchased this DVD at my local Target and was actually looking for another one of her workout programs. I came across this one and had seen it online but it was not being sold yet. So, when I saw it on the shelf, I immediately grabbed it! After I got home, I popped in the DVD. I can say, this one has a different, more modern, up to date look than another DVD that I have of hers. The quality is really good. When I first tried her workouts she seemed to be more catered to an older crowd but this one definitely caters to a wide range of individuals and I appreciate that. The workouts keep you moving and you can feel them actually working! I enjoy doing this workout as I feel more challenged than her other ones. (At first I was using her 7 Day Calorie Blast DVD as a ""cool down"" workout after doing a Jillian Michaels workout.) Now, I just do her workouts and a few of my own afterwards and I feel like I have done a very involved workout. I look forward to doing her workouts and am more excited to see what results I will get from sticking with it! I will update in about a month!",1356825600,157,1090,4.050925925925926

6734601,1,B00OBQ9PDC,"I have several of Leslie's dvd's but on this one, you can hear Leslie speaking but you can't hear the music.  It's very faint and hard to keep up the pace of the exercising without being able to hear the music.",1527724800,,210,4.121951219512195
6734602,4,B00OBQ9PDC,"A 2 mike walk with emphasis on the core, then floor exercises for the belly. Not too difficult but a change of pace from some of the other tapes. Like all of Leslies tapes, you can increase the intensity by adding higher impact moves vs the lower ones she shows.",1527465600,,262,4.26
6734603,5,B00OBQ9PDC,This is another good one with people you will recognize. Her normal moves and good music. Enjoyable.,1526688000,,100,4.9411764705882355

6734606,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"This is my current favorite of Leslie Sansone's walk-at-home videos (and I have several). If you do the whole thing--the two miles and the floor exercises--you will begin to feel more fit, not just in the tummy area but everywhere. I use it three times a week. Don't be discouraged if you cannot do some of the exercises at first; just keep at them, and you will ""get there."" At first, I could not do the half-push-ups or the planking, but now I can! I feel stronger and more fit, no question. Leslie is very encouraging and clear in her instructions. I should note that there appears to be a video editing mistake in the last set of floor exercises (for the back side) for the leg exercises where your feet ""push up,"" so you will need to make a slight adjustment to make sure that you get an equal number on each side for those exercises. Otherwise, I feel the video works very well.",1526169600,2,884,4.363636363636363

We are all over weight, and were looking for something to start off without the gym hassel. Kids love it, I love it, even Hubby has time for this workout. In just one week, the family (7 total) have lost 13 lbs combined!! May not be much to many, but to loose 2 lbs in one week for a 5'6 40yr old 289lbs, its progress!! Oh, and no diet change!

I've gotten hooked on the Leslie Sansone workouts, and am getting physically fit for the first time in my life.  I've been going to the gym for almost a year, and I feel that this has done a lot more for me that the gym has done.",1524960000,2,355,3.9166666666666665

6734613,5,B00OBQ9PDC,I think this one is my favorite out of the 5 dvd's I have in this series.  It is fun to do and easy to adapt to my level and need.  My tummy is my problem area and I feel like I need to work on it all the time.  This walk helps.,1522627200,,228,3.2641509433962264

6734623,4,B00OBQ9PDC,"I love it..It's perfect for me, not too difficult or too easy.  Would have given it five starts, except Leslie is way too happy and talks too much during the video. I don't know the routine well enough to listen only to music but I will eventually. Otherwise, it's an excellent routine for this grandma of 5 who wants to stay fit. Actually, I use it in rotation with two other Leslie Sansone walking videos.",1516752000,2,407,4.426666666666667

6734627,3,B00OBQ9PDC,"Reviews said this is a good challenge compared to Leslies other videos, but it was easy. Her 4 mile one with boosted walking with Jimmy is a better workout if you're looking to get your heart rate up. BUT the 2nd ab workout option is good!

6734636,5,B00OBQ9PDC,This video is no joke. Leslie Sansone is amazing and I love all her workout videos. I now have 5 different types. I highly recommend this  video.

I feel like we are friends.,1504915200,,329,4.306451612903226
6734637,5,B00OBQ9PDC,Absolutely love this dvd! 30 minutes but packs a punch. I love that she added some one leg hopping and jump rope type movements. Really gets the heart rate up. I alternate this dvd with her Miracle Miles dvds. I find I sweat more with this 30 minute workout than I do with her 4 mile workout (about an hour).,1504742400,,308,4.15

6734641,5,B00OBQ9PDC,Leslie always delivers. Her work outs aren't meant for advanced.  I use to be a very athletic person and wouldnt break a sweat with her workouts.  But now that I'm starting over I'm glad I have 4 of her dvds. I sweat to them now,1501027200,3,228,4.044444444444444

6734643,2,B00OBQ9PDC,"If you need low impact exercise, skip this DVD. Seriously, I love Leslie's workouts, but I have a history of foot and knee injuries, and can't do the high impact. What I normally love about Leslie's workouts is that she gives modifications so you don't have to figure out your own moves when she goes into a high impact segment. This one didn't give modifications nearly at all...there was one mention halfway through one of the boosts, but it was over 10 minutes into the workout. Very high impact. I ended up stopping the workout at 18 minutes because I was frustrated with having to make so many modifications on my own, and ended up putting in one of her other DVDs. I don't mind doing a few modifications on my own, but having to modify more than half the workout is disappointing.",1500595200,,786,4.503496503496503

6734659,3,B00OBQ9PDC,"I am an enormous fan and supporter of Leslie Sansone. Unfortunately, this is the first workout of hers I cannot get behind or complete, lol. This is not a walking program in my opinion. This is a high impact aerobic workout: jumping, running, twisting, deep squatting and more. After mile one, I actually had to sit down and rest I was so dizzy due to the frenetic movement. That has never happened to me before. No matter how challenging the workout, I could always complete it. If you have problems with your knees, back, feet or equilibrium, I cannot recommend this DVD. Now this is solely my experience. I think if you don't have issues with high impact aerobic movement, this is a killer workout. I can see it really transforming your midsection in a very short time. But it's just not for me. Be forewarned, if you are expecting low impact, this is NOT the workout for you. The twentysomething sports models should have been my first tip off, lol. Keep walking everyone!

6734675,4,B00OBQ9PDC,This is more fast paced then usual for her programs. I use it when I can t walk outside and it gives me a really good workout. Music isn t much and it seems rushed because there are minimal transitions but it gets the job done and she gives alternatives if you can t keep up.,1488326400,,275,3.9285714285714284

6734679,3,B00OBQ9PDC,"I just bought this along with 2 of her other DVDs. This one I'm not as crazy about. The 2 mile walk is good. It's a bit harder than the other 2 DVDs I bought but it does focus on the belly. At the end is an exercise section done using a mat. I did not finish that part but did some of it. At some point I will probably try the exercises on the mat but it bothered my back and had to quit. I am approaching 60 YOA and was able to do the walk part of the dvd without an issue.
On a side note, this one seemed to skip in the beginning but once it got to the main exercise it was fine.
** NOTE: 2nd time I tried this one it skipped to the point I couldn't get it to play. I am returning it and will exchange for a new one that will hopefully work this time. Also 30 day refund window on these so make sure you check them out right away. Amazon is great to work with on giving me a refund for the bad DVD.",1485129600,,900,3.6443298969072164

6734682,5,B00OBQ9PDC,This is my first time purchasing a walking DVD and I Thoroughly enjoyed it!! Its such an ingenious way to workout by walking right in your home. -The packaging was exactly how the seller described it. A bit worn looking but the DVD was just fine. I have no complaints.,1484006400,,268,4.38

6734685,3,B00OBQ9PDC,"I love Leslie Sansone and have quite a few of her videos.  This was a good workout for sure, but so far is my least favorite of the videos I have by her.  I have bad knees, and there is a fair amount of squatting and lunges.  I just modify the moves for myself, or do something totally different, but I don't care to do that more than a couple times in a video.  I would say, this is not the ideal workout for anyone with knee problems.  Also, this is just my own thing, but I don't like the song ""The Heat is On"" (from the 80's) and that is played during this workout for a long time.  Some people in other reviews mentioned that they didn't like the look of the other walkers because they looked like models.  I wouldn't say that, as they were fit and healthy looking and seemed friendly, but there is one in particular that's so thin she looks like she has an eating disorder.  In general though, if you have healthy knees and don't mind the song ""The Heat is On"", it's a good workout and includes some unique belly-toning moves.  I liked the ab exercises.",1482796800,3,1059,4.177339901477833

6734687,3,B00OBQ9PDC,"Very much a Sansone walk cd. If you do aerobics regularly you will easily be able to convert some of the higher impact moves for low impact ones without going back to walking.  The two  ""walk"" sessions are under a half hour. Toning section is floor work. If you are not a fan of floor work due to back or neck issues I would not suggest this cd.  Much of ab floor work can be modified to standing and I wish she had shown that.",1481673600,,427,4.0

Also, there's jumping involved, which I didn't appreciate since I have bad knees.  This is a more advanced workout but it didn't get my heart rate up like her other videos.  Definitely very disappointed by this.  Wouldn't recommend, at all. 0 Stars.",1472515200,10,370,4.903225806451613

So as a result I have ZERO core strength or stamina. Two days into this video I'm in love. You're not tripping over your feet trying to get steps right because her steps are easy to follow but don't let the ""walk"" label fool you because you will break a sweat. I'm terribly out of shape and determined to get active again and I'm 100% pleased to have found this video and I'd recommend it to anyone wanting to start out with something basic but effective.

6734715,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"I just completed this workout and it is AWESOME!!!  I have a couple of her other DVDs, and this one definitely takes it up a challenge level which is what I was looking for.  This is probably now my favorite one.  I love all the boosted activity, and it's really fun!!  The music is really energizing, and I love the set and bight colors!  I love the 30 minute workouts that she does because sometimes it's hard to find time for longer sessions. This walk is such a great 2 mile, 30 minute workout to kick up the energy and challenge level.  I will definitely be adding this in to my workout rotation!!  I will say this is a little more advanced with the boosted walking, but I still think anyone could give this a try!

I also LOVED the ab workouts at the end. There are 2 ten minute abs segments that you can easily add in to your routine or complete after a different walk.  Exactly what I was looking for.  Lastly, I love these DVDs because of how positive and encouraging Leslie is.  She does a great job guiding you through the moves and makes you feel okay with wherever you are at fitness-wise.  I never feel intimidated or that her workouts are just too advanced for me.  I feel empowered at the end of each one.  She is very motivating, and these are workouts I truly look forward to doing every day!!  I can't wait to keep it going!",1471132800,15,1343,4.252964426877471

Although her videos are imperfect, they are fun and relatively easy and I especially like that this one and others are just 30 min long and that I can use weights and that I can adapt them to my needs and that I can do some of the work on my mid section and core while walking/standing!

6734723,2,B00OBQ9PDC,"I am a big fan of Leslie's workouts and own a dozen of them, but this one disappointed.

First the pros. The workout itself is fine.  There are some new moves, but nothing too taxing or hard on the joints which is important when you are 50+ like me.  I ended feeling like I worked up a good sweat and got a got middle range workout.  I am a big fan of the fun color outfit coordination in Leslie's videos and this one has a fun color scheme of pink and yellow -bright and cheerful.  And the music has some selections I am quite fond of... however... that provides a great segue to the cons... The music is so soft I can hardly hear it, so I either have to miss out on the music or turn up the volume so much that the cueing is too loud!  The first time through I thought I would just solve the problem by using the ""music only"" options that most of my Leslie videos provide - but then came to discover that THIS DVD does not allow for you to only listen to the music during the workout.  All in all, disappointed by the lack of quality control.  Someone should have realized the problem before mass producing this DVD.",1468195200,3,1118,4.119815668202765

6734726,4,B00OBQ9PDC,"This is more of a workout than her other 'Walk' DVDs.  The Four Mile video is good if you want only to walk with optional use of bands.  This one leaves you feeling like you have worked out.  My exercise buddy and I both work with various Gaiam yoga, pilates, tone and strengthen videos and we were glad to have the powerwalkl/workout combined in ""Just Walk.""  After going through the entire workout a couple times, we were able to ""mute"" her chatter (redundant) and get through it listening to upbeat music.

The 2 sculpting videos at the end I'm still trying to work my way up to doing 3 times per week. I do the sculpting about 2 times per week. Just trying to establish a routine. The first few days I did this I was a little sore.  The soreness was not intense though.  You can modify any move just about. I no longer modify. I complete both miles 3-4 times a week. I got tired of the music though. So, I mite the tv, and play my own. The workout goes by super fast! This is one everyone can do...Beginners, Moderate, and Advanced! On days you don't want to go to the gym or running outside, but need a quick and simple workout....this is my staple.

This DVD has a two mile fast walk (rate of 15 minutes a mile) and some new moves.  She adds some squats, lunges, and hops along with twisting and rotating for your waist.  As always, the moves are easy to follow and modify and Leslie is all energy and enthusiasm.  And you will sweat!  I am pleased to have this in my collection.  It is a good alternative to the basic walking.  The DVD also contains two different belly blasting floor exercise routines for toning and sculpting.  I have not tried these yet.

6734780,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"Walk, walk, walk..... I have been doing Leslie Samsone Videos for a few months now.  When someone first time me at the local gym that we would be doing a walking DVD, I laughed.  I have never done a walking DVD and assumed it would just be walking and honestly didn't think I could motivate myself to walk in place as exercise.  So at the gym, the instructor put in one of Leslie Samsone's walking DVDs and I had to eat my words.  WOW!  I was impressed with the workout.  After 3-4 times of doing these at the gym, I came home and ordered several so that I could do them at home when I could not go to the gym.

I specifically ordered this one because of the title - ""Belly Blasting"".  After 4 kids, that is still my flabbiest area.  I, honestly, do not enjoy exercise.  I make myself do it because I know it's good for me.  There are two workout on this DVD - 2 Fast Miles and 2 Fast Miles with Belly Flattening Moves.  The first time I did it, I did it with the Belly Flattening Moves.  The belly flattening moves are floor exercises (see not just walking)  focused on abs.  The rest of the 2 miles are fast paced and geared toward your core and abs.  There is side stepping, kicking, knee lifts, butt kicks and a lot of other moves.  These DVDs are called walking DVDs but definitely are not just walking.

After I do this DVD, I am sweaty and sore but I am so full of energy.  I am now a huge fan of Leslie Samsone and have multiple DVDs at home and do them at the gym when I go.  They are easy enough that any age person can do them and really in whatever shape you are in.  You can make these higher or lower impact by doing more with the moves or less.  I really like that the DVD offers a couple of different exercise options and really you could just do the second mile if you don't have a lot of time.

If you have never tried walking DVDs, I now highly recommend them.  I feel like I am finally getting into shape and not dreading every minute of working out.  You can get a good workout in 30 minutes and the time really does go by quickly.  Leslie Samsone is easy to follow and explains each move.",1454889600,88,2110,4.060679611650485

She really mixes it up with a bunch of high energy FUN moves - leg swings, jumping squats, jump ropes, hip shifts with punches and more.  If you like FAST paced walking workouts with lots of variety, this is the one for you.  The two floor core routines are excellent also.  I do strength training 3X a week and one of the times, I use these two routines.  I bought this dvd in a set with her Belly, Buns and Thighs Slimdown with fitcuff resistance band.

I've used a few of Leslie Sansone ""Walk Slim"" videos which I liked, then got ""Walk It Off in 30 Days"" last year, which I was not thrilled with - not intense enough for me.  Then I read reviews on this DVD & tried it today - much better!  I also like that there are delineations between the miles and the 2 toning sections as well.  You can do them all, or mix & match, depending on how much time & energy you have that day.  I did the 2 mile cardio and then the first section of toning, and that was enough for me to start.  Her music is still not the best, and you can hardly hear it, so it's not easy to pick up the beat; but other than that, this is an excellent workout DVD!",1447977600,2,694,3.8865248226950353

6734818,2,B00OBQ9PDC,"Generally, I adore walking with Leslie Sansone.  So, I was pretty keen to get this DVD and attempt to get rid of my baby fat (from my two kids).  After trying the program once, I am sending it to PARCA, a local collector of donation items.  The problem is that Leslie strayed from her usual painless program to increase the intensity of the workout.  I follow her programs because I have tendonitis in my ankle and surgical plate and screws in the same ankle due to a compound fracture a number of years ago.  So, simple, low impact workouts are my favorite.

In this DVD Leslie added a lot of twisting movements and high intensity jumping and jogging.  By the end of the workout my ankle was burning and my knees weren't too happy either.  There was also little to no modification of the movements.  The music was uninspiring.  The floor exercises were strenuous but I like the comfort of my great big exercise ball, rather than hard floor and I was unable to modify some of the movements using my ball.  So, again, very disappointed with this particular DVD only.",1442707200,3,1065,4.523560209424084

6734824,5,B00OBQ9PDC,This is more intense than most of her workouts. But if you want to challenge yourself a little more and chisel your waist line this is the workout for you. It's not so difficult that you can't get through it. She works you up to a good stiff level that makes you feel good about a challenge you can achieve without over challenging you.

6734825,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"This DVD has two workouts - a 2 mile walk that lasts about 30 minutes and a 2 part toning section that targets the core, but works the arms and the legs as well, lasing about 20 minutes. The walking portion includes some new moves for those familiar with Leslie's Four Core Steps of Walk, Side Steps, Kicks and Knee Lifts. The new moves: lunges, jumps and jogging help to melt the belly fat, along with the more traditional moves. Leslie did more Knee Lifts in this workout than in other of her walking workouts. It makes a great change to Leslie's other walks, whether you need to slim the belly or not. The toning work is all floor work - a series of crunches and a series of leg lifts and push ups, strengthening and toning the back, arms  and legs as well as the core. The moves are challenging enough to give you a great workout, but short enough to not get boring.",1441584000,5,870,4.2727272727272725

It goes by fast too, so it is great for days when you might not have a whole lot of time to get a work out in. It is high enough intensity that I feel like I've had a great workout by the end, but not high enough that I'm coughing and wheezing for the rest of the day after I'm done (I'm an asthmatic).

There are 2 mat workouts on the dvd, so depending on how much time I have, I can either do them back-to-back- or alternate them each day. I am starting to see results and am feeling stronger and more fit. I got to meet Leslie at the IDEA fitness event last weekend and do a ""live"" walk session with her. So much fun!",1437782400,3,562,3.9298245614035086

6734848,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"I just started working out 3 month ago so I'm not in excellent shape or anything but I have built some stamina and this video challenges me!  I wouldn't say it's super hard by any means but I'm definitely dripping in sweat by the end of it!  I did the 21 day fix videos for a month and some of them are just way too intense for me so I needed a happy medium. This DVD is the happy medium for me, this is the belly blasting walk but after this work out I feel it everywhere but not to the point that I can't walk for 2 days (ie:21 day fix)!  I don't do the floor exercises every time bc I only have limited time for work outs but I do this DVD almost every day and I feel really good!!",1437609600,7,684,3.8028169014084505

6734852,5,B00OBQ9PDC,What a workout,1436832000,,14,4.0
6734853,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"Completed the whole 40 minutes today and my fitbit lite up during the exercise.  I love Leslie Sansone and have so since 1998.  I bought her VHS tapes and they sit right next to none other than Richard Simmons God Bless Him and Keep Him.  My favorite part of this DVD were the size of the women only two of them were larger.  I have worked out for years and for me there is nothing worse than working out to a DVD and thinking I want to loose weight and those women are LARGER than me.  Not so with this one.  It is so inspiring to see small women working out with Leslie the two larger women look to be my size which is a draw back.  I wish that Leslie would introduce these women like an intro not part of the workout and tell us if they just had babies, new to fitness etc.  I realize we are all different sizes but large women are so prone to diseases they just don't look healthy to me.  Now I would not have said anything had i not seen the four stars given because small women were in the the DVD.",1436745600,,1004,3.98
6734854,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"I own 5-6 of Leslie's DVD's now and this is probably the toughest.  Unless you are good shape, do not start with this one!  Whereas many of Leslie's programs will be more repetitive in nature, this one switches steps much faster and the boosts really amp up your heart rate.  Love it!",1436745600,,284,4.423076923076923

6734856,5,B00OBQ9PDC,This is awesome ! Leslie has done it again. And this was even better. It is definitely a bit tougher than her usual. More squats more twists.. She definitely is keeping up to get promise on getting us a flatter belly. Overall this is a great workout and can be used on days when u don't want to do a more intense one.,1435881600,,317,4.0476190476190474
6734857,4,B00OBQ9PDC,"I like this DVD.  It was a good workout.  Some of the moves are high impact which definetly raises the heart rate. I will be 59 in August and I can perform the moves with the exception of the leg swings. For some reason I just can't do leg swings!  I'm also large breasted and even wearing a bra plus a compression bra, I found I needed to hold my breasts on some moves.  Walk Off Fat Fast is still my favorite.",1435622400,5,411,3.975609756097561
6734858,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"I like the combination of a 2-mile (30 minute) walk and the two 10 minute core sessions. If I have time, I do both.  Other days I just do the 2-mile walk.  It's great for cold or rainy days when you don't want to walk outside (or you're taking care of a small child indoors) but you want a good cardio workout. I would consider it a good video for a beginner to intermediate level workout. It's not very intense so if you are looking for intensity, I wouldn't choose this one.",1435622400,,476,4.163043478260869

6734862,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"I used Leelie Sansone's videos yrs ago and lost 72 lbs. They're easy to follow.
They're not high impact so if jarring aerobics isn't for you,  her videos are.
Also, if  you're just starting out, and are as out of shape as I've become,
these videos are easy to adjust your movements to slow your heart rate back down.
I recommend using Sansone's videos in combination with other aerobic videos,
free weights and resistence bands for at home cross training.",1434844800,12,455,4.675

6734873,4,B00OBQ9PDC,"I liked this alot! I have several of Leslie's DVDs and have struggled to really like them.  I'm not very coordinated, so I do appreciate the simple moves, but find it gets boring and repetitive. I wanted to give myself a real chance to like Leslie, so I looked for something that might be a bit more advanced.  This DVD introduces several new steps, and provides some variety.  The deep squat with a twist was my favorite.  There is a good bit of bouncing and jumping. Being in a 2nd floor apt I have to keep it low impact.  Instead of bouncing, I do the moves going up onto my toes and back down. There is some twisting that quickly goes into jogging and back and forth. I did feel like going in and out of the twisting so quickly could be prone to injury.  So I do both the twisting and jogging, but for longer periods.

My first time through I did it straight through to the first core exercises on the mat, and had to take a break before finishing with the last of the core workouts.  They are challenging but doable.  The first set of exercises are a variety of crunches. I did have to stop before the end of the twisting crunches, as those tend to hurt my back.  The second set of exercises are mostly plank work and some push ups. There are some balance challenges, in lifting opposite leg and arm, laying on your stomach.

From beginning of the DVD to the end, my health watch said I burned around 450 calories.  I would recommend this for someone wanting a bit more variety of moves, and something that is a bit more of a challenge but manageable.",1433030400,,1556,4.273037542662116

I used it on both DVD players. This time I don't want a replacement because it must be a defective batch of DVD's.

effective and so far, it is!  You can  go at your own pace until you can do

6734940,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"Have used a couple of times, LOVE it.  I've only done the 1 mile.  The time passes quickly & I love being able to do this inside.  I leave for work & get home when it's dark so this is perfect!  Easy to keep up with.  I'm not in shape & have Lupus, Fibromyalgia & Osteoarthritis.  I make a few modifications, for now.  Be willing to bet that as I progress, I won't have to do many modifications & will feel better!!  The docs say exercise, for a reason....it helps!  Don't say you can't, give it a try.  Walk in place when you need to, make modifications but do something.  I think this exercise DVD is a great way to go!  Going to order the others!!!",1422921600,,651,4.079365079365079
6734941,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"I LOVE Leslie Sansone and the fact that I can exercise in my own house in my pjs if I wanted to. This is a 2 mile workout with some new moves that I hadn't seen from some of her previous videos. If you are unsure if you can do 2 miles-you can stop after a mile, there is a slight break and you can just do a cool down, but if you want to do the full 2 miles, I say go for it. Leslie says several times that you can just walk if you don't want to do any of the extra stuff-or do side steps. Either way you will get a great workout.

The other great thing about this workout is that there's more than just a walk. There are two floor exercise routines that you can do (about 20 min) where she works your front and then your back muscles. I typically will do the walk one day, and then the floor exercises the next and then switch back to the walk etc.

The helpers-Okay, I saw complaints that they were all skinny women....kinda. There was one (Bree) that wasn't stick thin but still if you are a fan of Leslie's then what her helpers looked like won't matter.

If you are looking for something new or you are hesitate, don't be. I love it.",1422403200,4,1138,3.960698689956332

I was a bit disappointed that this was absolutely a HIGH impact workout without direction on how to keep it low impact.  I have bad knees and that's why I choose WATP.  So if you buy this, make sure you can do high impact.",1422230400,2,308,4.1

6734949,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"I have been a fan of Leslie's for over 10 years - I started with what I believe are near her original 2 & 3 mile walks and used them until they were literally worn out.  I bought this as a replacement and update.  This DVD in addition to regular pilates keeps my weight where it should be and builds some great muscle tone - especially in the abs.  I love the pace and her energy.  You don't realize 30 minutes have gone by and you are like wow, that was a great workout I just got in during my lunch break!  Some may find her annoying, but no one in the history of all workout dvd's is more annoying than Denise Austin, so I can't complain in the least.  The moves are fun and easy to do and you can make it as simple or as hard as you'd like.  When I want a challenge, I add my own arm movements and 3 lb ankle and wrist weights.  You can also just make smaller movements to ramp up if you are just getting started on a workout regimen.  I think this is well suited for all levels of fitness and body type - low impact.  I have horrible knees and the new fitness trend is to squat and jump and move like a cracked out monkey, which my knees absolutely cannot handle.  So while this may not be a trendy workout, it gets you fit, and that's the whole point!",1421712000,4,1257,3.9681274900398407

I like the 2 fast miles section b/c it is easy to follow and there are some new moves that aren't in her other DVDs.  I definitely break a sweat and feel energized w/o being exhausted.  However, I am really disappointed in the floor work segment.  I feel like it moves too slowly and the exercises are too simplistic to do me any good.  I like to feel the burn in my ab muscles after a workout and I don't get that with this one.  Overall, it's not a bad workout, but if you're looking for floor work that makes you feel the burn, you'll want to try something else.",1420588800,,633,4.105691056910569

6734964,3,B00OBQ9PDC,"I have a bunch of Leslie's videos and have worked out with them for 20+ years but this is not one of my favorites.  This one is almost too fast and I'm in pretty good shape, working out 6 days a week.  My heart monitor screamed at me to slow down during various segments.  My knees also didn't like a few of the moves, so I had to modify to be less twisty and less jumpy.  In addition, the switch/transition from one move to the next is not as smooth as they normally are and just seems like she's trying to fit as many ""higher"" impact moves as possible to get the heart pumping that normally wouldn't really fit.  Finally, the floor belly work is basically pilates movements but she breaks the moves up, never doing any for very long and comes back to repeat they same moves after doing something else, which really isn't that effective in building endurance or muscle.  She starts the 100 but gets to about 10 and moves on, which again for me makes the move ineffective.  I'll still use it, but I'll scatter it between the other ones I already have and my treadmill to save my knees!",1419724800,,1085,4.28921568627451

6734971,3,B00OBQ9PDC,"This workout is okay. There's a lot of bouncing and jumping. I can't do a lot of those exercises because it's too hard on my knees, I'm busty, and it causes me to feel nauseated. I modify the moves to be lower impact, but I don't feel I get that good of a workout as a result. I feel like she's ramping up my heart rate with all the jumping (which is fine) but it's not actually targeting my abs.  I actually prefer the Leslie Sansone: Mix and Match Walk Blasters.

Between The Leslie walk and the Atkins lifestyle I lost 83 pounds and after 12 years have kept most of it off. I work full time and have a lot of other professional and personal committments. So going to the gym and walking out doors is not always an option. With Leslie you can pop in the DVD and Walk Away those pounds. It helps strengthen your health, muscles, belly, arms etc. Don't laugh but I am 63 but 17 inside!! I can keep up with the younger ones on the DVD as well. You can work yourself up and don't have to do it all at once. Once you get yourself in gear you will feel so much better.

6735010,3,B00OBQ9PDC,"I am a big fan of Leslie Sansone videos.  I start every day with Leslie. Of all of them my favorite is still the Two Mile Walk, filmed in 1996, issued on DVD in 2002, and still sold online.  I like thinking that the people I'm exercising with are trapped in time on video from almost 20 years ago and now they are all middle aged ladies like me. :)

But I need some variety and I do have a belly, so this video made sense.  Much of this video is not a success for me.  I don't have true knee troubles, but I'm starting to feel some weakness and occasional pains in my left knee.  There are movements I avoid doing with my knees now so they don't feel strained.  This whole video is full of those moves.  A lot of twisting, jumping, and jumping with twisting.  It put stress on my knees.  Of course, I can substitute less twisty moves, but it's a great deal of substituting with this one.

I noted that all her group members in this one are 20-something's.  Maybe the intention is that it's not meant for older knees?  I always like picking a group member to watch for a whole video, looking for mistakes and differences in style.  This is actually a pretty uninteresting group in that regard. Also, the quality of the filming is not nearly as high as in older videos.  It doesn't matter, but if you use a lot of her DVDs you are going to notice this.

Leslie's videos are always good, but this one may not be the best choice if your knees aren't up to a lot of twisting movement.",1408233600,22,1479,4.173144876325089

6735021,4,B00OBQ9PDC,"Okay so as soon as I'd placed this DVD on my Amazon wishlist it magically appeared at my local Walmart.

Mile 1: This mile is a bit slower pace starting out than Mile 2, mainly due to the warm-up Leslie gives in the beginning with the basic steps (walking in place, knee lifts, kicks, and side steps). I will say that this mile is more knee-lift intensive than Mile 2 and you don't see many kicks done. The music is a bit low but for those of you with surround sound (or perhaps a newer, better tv than mine) hearing the music and catching the beat shouldn't be a problem. The lady walkers in this DVD are all fresh faces of different sizes and the energy I got from them all was very positive. They are all moderately dressed (no skimpy outfits) and Brianna is there to show you modifications should you need them. - New moves! Mini squats with twists (these are actually fun to do), and deep squats with twisting. If you have bad knees quite honestly I recommend using the old school kick backs from Leslie's earlier DVDs.

Mile 2: This one picks up right away, although you will hear a repeat of ""The Heat Is On"" when the pace picks up again. I'm big on music and overall this DVD is pretty decent and motivating. Sadly this mile slows down and ends right when I'm ready for a third mile.
- Personal recommendation: go ahead and repeat Mile 2! There are tons of knee lifts and some kicks and Leslie gives you punches and twists, etc to have fun with it and you do feel it in your core as well.

Core workouts: mainly bridgework, crunches, her version of the Hundred (for pilates fans out there). The second workout involved a lot of plank work which I like but honestly I'm more of an advanced exerciser and the poses were not particularly challenging for me, not even on a light day.
- For those overcoming injury, are new to exercise, or really just need to take it easy, the core workouts would be a good option.

OVERALL:  Miss Leslie you did a great job :)
- if you don't like squats, do knee lifts/kickbacks instead
- to pump up your side steps use the ""skater-like"" move introduced in Mile 1 to make it more fun (you also feel it in your sides more)",1406678400,4,2159,4.294840294840295
6735022,5,B00OBQ9PDC,This is a great workout!  I was looking for something to do at home to save myself the embarrassment at the gym.  What I love about her videos is that her moves are easy to follow.  You are not spending 1/2 the workout trying to figure out what move she is going to do next and if you are going to be able to do it.  She also has several levels of walkers in the background to follow so it works for all fitness levels.  If you follow Leslie this workout WILL make you lose weight and is pretty intense.,1406678400,,503,3.99
6735023,2,B00OBQ9PDC,I'm writing about the walking portion of this DVD.  There were a couple of things that I didn't like.  1.  Leslie's voice was a bit too loud and the music a bit too soft.  I couldn't hear when the music changed to quicker or slower beats.  2.  The moves seemed unplanned compared to some of Sansone's other DVDs.  There often weren't smooth transitions from one move to the next.,1406332800,3,379,4.405797101449275

3. This DVD can make you ""VINE FAMOUS"" if your kid secretly records you doing the crazy moves. I don't have the Moves Like Jagger, so I'm sure I'm a sight.

There is a one mile marker if you need it so you can do one or two miles depending on how your body feels. Then there are two 10 minute on-the-floor abs and glutes workouts. You burn off the fat with the cardio, then tone and shape the core muscles with the on-the-floor routines.

Same four basic moves (sidesteps, kicks, knee lifts and walking) with some new moves thrown in for variety (mini-squats, full squats, jump roping, twists, and lots of punching).

6735054,2,B00OBQ9PDC,"In regards to the toning exercises done on the floor, I do think that more of the exercises could have been done with your head on the mat, not suspended above, which is a BIG strain on back and neck muscles, if done for too long. The neck is such a delicate area, caution should be advised when doing any exercises that entails keeping the neck and head lifted for extended periods of time. And no mention of proper breathing techniques either, something I've noted on several of her dvds actually. Breathing properly is SO important, with any exercise regime, particularly for strength training.

The walking part of this dvd was just OK and it does include some high-impact moves that I did not like or expect. I didn't like the music either.

I also miss Leslie's 'old' pals on these newer dvds, one of the things I liked about her dvds from previous years was her inclusion of several age groups, not just young women. I think this trend is a big mistake and I know I won't be buying anymore of her dvds if this continues.

I'm in my 50's and in better than average shape. I don't want to watch dvds that exclude everyone but young women, working out in the group. I'm surprised that Leslie would go this route.

I still like the Intensity Walk DVD by Leslie, most of all and that does include people from a wide range of ages. I don't like to see ageism promoted anywhere and I was disappointed to note this on the 3 latest DVDs that I bought from this series.

Sending back for a refund as I know I won't actually use this DVD. I have a lot of other ones by Leslie and also Jane Fonda, that I like a lot more.",1401148800,8,1616,4.285245901639344

The cardio routines are (as always) easy to follow; these have mini-boosts that give high-intensity intervals.  The core-toning floor routines are 10 minutes each, aimed at beginner to intermediate-level core exercisers.  I've only done these routines a few times over several weeks and am already feeling changes in my core fitness.  One caution:  There's a lot of twisting in the cardio routines, to pump up the intensity.  My knees, always a weak spot, rebelled at all the twisting.

I thought I'd get this DVD for another 2 mile routine to give myself some variety and who doesn't like belly blasting exercises?!  Let me point out...there is only one workout that involves walking on this DVD.  The other workouts are floor routines that you do after the miles workout.  I just did the walking routine since I don't really want to get on the floor in my office.  I did scan the exercises for the floor routine and they look like they'd be good but I haven't done them.  Let me say this about the walk....it's intense.  She does break it up into 1 and 2 miles so you can stop after 1 mile if you want.  If you can't do high impact I would pass on this one.  She does a lot of jogging, jumping, bouncing, twisting, deep squats.  The beat is fast...she titles it ""2 Fast Miles"" which is correct!  The walk routine lasts a little over 30 minutes.  She does some fun things to get the core more involved...guess I'll know tomorrow if it made any muscles wake up.  I will also say that it was kind of hard to catch the beat of the music because it's very faint behind her voice audio.  I don't crank it too loud as I'm in the workplace but even when I had it up higher to begin with, I found it was hard to hear the music.  So I had to keep eye on her and mimic her movements which makes it hard to really get into the music and workout.

I have way more than a pudgy stomach and have always hated it. I noticed in both miles she really fires up that area with some really good unique moves I had never seen her do in her other DVDs. These more are very effective. For example, when you do kicks, she'll make you hit your knees as if you have a hammer. I noticed when I did that, I could really feel my core fire up. There is a LOT of high intensity moves such as hopping, jumping, shifts, twists, and leg swings. Bre is there to modify the moves if you prefer a low-intensity workout.

I was out of breath, my feet hurt,and she kind of got on my knees, which I should have wore a knee pad for this workout. You will need a sports bra or your stuff will jiggle :p

The first floor work session is my most favorite becuase she spends about 15 to 20 minutes targeting your abs in many different ways. I noticed when I woke up the next day, my stomach was sore. So, it's very effective stuff. Plus the music during this session is WAY comforting. I raised the windows to let the sunlight in, put on cool air and just relaxed through the session.

I burned about 204 calories during the mile part.

***CONS***

I knocked one star off this rating becuase the music was tough to hear. That was the ONLY thing I disliked about the workout.

She does tend to get off step a lot when she's trying to match with the music.

***OTHER***
Unfortunately, I can't review the floor session 2 part because it was too difficult for me. So, I apologize for that. All I know is that she makes you get on your stomach and tries to help you balance your weight on your core. I could NOT do that! So, I believe you're on your back in the first session, and on your stomach and knees on the second.

This is worth buying becuase every time I did this workout, I felt my abs.",1395446400,5,1992,4.193717277486911

6735086,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"I got this DVD today and I have to say I was really surprised. These newer DVDs in Leslie's Just Walk series are so much fun! If you are used to her older more classic workouts and you want a bit of an updated change...this is awesome! She is still the same Leslie...funny, energetic, over-the-top insane ;-) but in these she has added some new moves like ""Twist"", ""Squat Twist"", ""Leg Swings""...this particular walk is 2 miles and it does go fast! And let me also add that I have not felt this tired after a Leslie workout in a while so this was great.

Highly recommend!",1395273600,,571,4.336448598130841

They don't seem to take as much time, partially as she does about 10 count routines,incorporating 4 moves, with variations, always reminding me of my ""core"", suck that tummy in to my backbone.
Spending the money on her tapes is cheaper than one month at the gym and I will do it.
She does have a wacky laugh though.",1395187200,,479,4.288888888888889

6735096,4,B00OBQ9PDC,"Okay, yes Leslie is still a BIG talker in this one (and that fake laugh...yikes!).  And when she says ""walk walk walk"" too many times in a row it starts to sound like ""quack quack quack"".

BUT....the cues are spot on as usual.  The workout is intense and goes by really fast.  My personal problem with it is some of the steps can't really be done on carpet, but that's the only downfall from my perspective.

The music is great.  The set is bright and modern.  If you like Leslie Sansone and the WATP series, this will be a great addition to your collection.",1393891200,4,558,4.3076923076923075

6735100,5,B00OBQ9PDC,I love all her exercise DVDs  and this one delivers for those of us that need some high impact walking. The toning segments are a bonus and I love it too. I can't wait to improve my lifestyle by using her DVDs,1393200000,,209,3.9761904761904763

6735102,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"This may not be a popular opinion, but I absolutely LOVE the newer, updated and modern look of Leslie's newer DVD's, including the younger, fit girls in the background. I much prefer those to workout to vs. seeing someone still very much overweight (no offense) in the background doing the steps. I understand the appeal of having someone overweight or folks with different body types in the background, but that just does not motivate me to do the workouts as much as having the younger girls back there who look like I want to look. If I wanted to see someone overweight doing the moves, I would just look in the mirror. I am especially a fan of Carrie, who not only looks like she is having fun and adds a lot of energy to the workout, but is very graceful with her moves as well. I also enjoy Brianna (or maybe it's Rianna?) and Nikki. I'm not as big of a fan of the 2 super skinny sisters in the back. They don't seem to be as ""in to it"" and don't really bring any energy to the workout. Please keep making these videos and including Carrie, Brianna and Nikki!

Now, on to the video... I am a 32 year old female with really bad knees (3 knee surgeries 15 or so years ago) plus a bad back (3 discs with very bad degenerative disc disease) and am constantly extremely achy all the time from my lower back down. I was recently diagnosed with PCOS and Insulin Resistance (they seem to go together) and would like to lose weight to help with the PCOS/Insulin Resistance as well as prepare to try to get pregnant in the next few months. I also use a FitBit, and the combination of the FitBit and Leslie's DVD's has really helped me start to actually lose some weight (which apparently is very hard to do when you have PCOS). I love that her DVD's are low impact, because with my knees and back, I just can't do what I used to be able to do. This DVD is probably the most ""high impact"" of Leslie's DVD's and I was nervous about being able to do all the moves. I was pleasantly surprised that I was able to do all but one of the moves - the one where she has you swing your legs to the side, and doing a hop in between. Thankfully, she added a modification for that move, and it doesn't really last very long anyway. This is my favorite of all of Leslie's DVD's, followed closely by her 3 Mega Miles (which includes all of the same background walkers, plus a man). I love all the variations to the routines that she adds in these 2 DVD's. I HIGHLY recommend this DVD as well as the 3 Mega Miles one. Love them both!",1392854400,2,2512,4.200828157349896
6735103,5,B00OBQ9PDC,I love Leslie for days when I can't get outside to run or when the treadmill has that dreary quality to it! Anybody can make these workouts work!,1392681600,,145,4.214285714285714
6735104,4,B00OBQ9PDC,I loved this video. She does easy moves and practical moves for abs while walking. Would definitely recommend. The ab workout after walking session is also very good,1392595200,,165,4.928571428571429
6735105,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"I really like this dvd. It's easy to follow and eases you into fitness, either for beginners or those who haven't exercised in a while. It keeps my attention as it's not too long and makes me feel like I got a good workout. I like how there are ""everyday"" women with all body types depicted doing the workout.",1392422400,,309,4.254237288135593

It was hard to go anywhere with a nursing newborn, so the gym was just out of the question, and it was a bit too cold to take him out on walks.  I was too out of shape to run, but wanted to do more than just walk...and lifting weights didn't appeal to me.  This was the perfect solution.  It was hard and it made me sweat a ton, but it was great because I could attend to my son if I needed, and my toddler loved doing the workout with me.",1392422400,,517,3.759259259259259

I workout 5-7 days a week and with varying instructors, from Billy Blanks to Jillian Michaels, and an integral always effective part is Leslie Sansone. Don't sleep on Leslie! She is exceptionally fit; the fact that she talks through an entire workout and even jogging shows, she's no novice nor a gimmick!",1392336000,,460,4.654320987654321

6735109,5,B00OBQ9PDC,I have always loved Leslie Sansone.  Her videos are made so that anyone can follow at their own pace and then increase as their stamina builds.,1392249600,,143,4.5
6735110,5,B00OBQ9PDC,I own 3 Leslie Sansone videos and I switch between them to vary the workouts.  This one seem to be the most high-impact.  You could always opt to walk instead however if you wanted to keep in low impact.  I like the transitions between moves.  Knowing that we are changing to a different move helps me to avoid getting injured by concentrating on the muscle groups that I will be needing.,1392163200,,388,4.422535211267606
6735111,4,B00OBQ9PDC,"I love Leslie's workouts because they are low-impact but I found the high intensity parts of this workout too much for my bad knees.  Leslie emphasises that it is the high-intensity parts which most efficiently target stored fat but she encourages you to stay low-impact if you need to. The abdominal exercises are very good, they really targeted the right areas without hurting the wrong ones.  Leslie is so motivating, she seems to know exactly when to give you some cheerleading.  This would not be the best workout for an absolute beginner but otherwise I very much recommend it.",1392076800,,583,4.8686868686868685
6735112,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"I have a number of different dvd's of Leslie's. This one is fast paced and targets the Abs. I would say that is it more of an intermediate level. I wouldn't start out on this one if I haven't been exercising in a bit. There are some twisting moves that I have found uncomfortable for my back, but to be fair, I had back surgery years ago and it may just not be well suited for me. I usually modify those moves for myself. Nonetheless, it is a good workout! I would recommend it!",1392076800,,478,4.095744680851064
6735113,5,B00OBQ9PDC,I just love Leslie Sansone's walk DVD's.  She is fun and makes exercising enjoyable.

6735115,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"This is a great 2 mile walk, very intense and action-packed.  At the end are two yoga-based toning sessions.  You can pick any of the three sessions (the walk + two toner exercises) separately, or do all together.  It's a great workout!  She does not ""chat"" so much with the group in this video, which can get a little irritating in some of her other workouts.  I am 63, and even though I am in fair, but not great shape, I can still do this workout if I push myself.  This is worth the sweat :)",1391472000,,495,4.104166666666667
6735116,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"I love Leslie's ultimate collection walks, so this DVD was a bit of a change. I wanted something to make me sweat, because sometimes I wouldn't break a sweat until late into the three miles or so. This DVD definitely did the trick. I didn't care for the music, or more restrained relationship between Leslie and these walkers. But overtime, I found that I would pop in this DVD more often than I thought I would. The ab exercises are simply the best and I've already seen the difference in my waistline. When I want a faster pace that makes gives me a really great workout, this is definitely one of my favorites.",1391385600,,613,4.433628318584071

6735118,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"I've checked out several of Leslie's videos from the library and this is my favorite so I recently purchased it. Pros of this video:  the set isn't crowded with walkers standing too close to each other (I like my personal space and don't like to see people crowded!), each walker has good form and no one does their own dance-like variation of any of the exercises (like the party song remix video), there's no random hollering/singing by the exercisers (yeah, I'm probably ""type A"").  Many likely find some of Leslie's other videos more fun. I just prefer a structured workout. This 'walk' really is enjoyable. It is a good mix of moderate cardio and core/lower body work. Tough enough that you feel like you've accomplished something, but not so hard that you cringe when you pick up the dvd.  This wouldn't be the best workout for someone who has to stay strictly low impact, there is jogging, 'jump rope' and a hopping twist move. The sculpting floor segment that follows is excellent too.  I would love to have a 3 mile walk in a similar format.  An approximate summary of the walk -  5 minute warm up, 5 minute medium pace, 10 minute fast pace, 5 minute medium pace, 5 minute cool down and stretch. 30 minutes=2 miles and it goes by fast!",1391040000,,1244,4.556053811659193

The 2 mile walk is about 30 minutes and does basically walking and some other moves like leg kicks, knee lifts and a few other fun movements. Once you are done the walk, you can do the ab part of the DVD which is done on the floor.

6735122,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"I had heard of Leslie before but thought that a DVD focused on walking would be really dull.  However, I was pleased to find that it's not just walking--lots of other moves are added in to keep it interesting.  The moves are mostly simple and break up the walking nicely.  30 min of walking (she calls it a fast 2 miles) including squats, kicks, leg lifts, twisting, and other moves.  I keep going to the two 10-min workouts.  The first one works the front core and is mostly done lying on a mat on your back--no shoes needed.  The second 10-min workout works on the back core and is mostly done lying on a mat face-down (planks, push-ups, etc.)--a good arm workout.  Put them together for a 50-min workout that includes cardio plus toning.  Nice!",1390262400,5,747,4.481481481481482

I am in pretty good shape, but I've always had stubborn belly fat that just sits there. I ordered the Hip Hop abs DVDs....but then I realized I can't dance & I have no coordination. So, I gave up on that and decided to use this DVD for one month straight (at least 4 x a week) and guess what?!?! I still don't have a 6 pack, but I definitely did lose belly fat & my tummy has tightened!!

I have arthritis in my lower back so the higher intensity moves on this one ( jogging, twisting, jumping) are out but even just speed walking while they jump around, I felt that I got a very good cardio workout. It was paced fast enough that it got my heart rate up & had me sweating.

I like the floor exercises as well, particularly the exercises she does for the back. I've noticed an improvement in how my back feels from doing these exercises.

My only complaint is that I wish the walk was 3 miles instead of 2 but that's a very minor complaint. I highly recommend this one....",1389916800,,606,4.2155172413793105
6735125,4,B00OBQ9PDC,"I have always been overweight by 20-30 pounds and that continues. I always thought my body hated exercise because my feet would hurt, knees would pop, and (after a bad case of bronchitis and developing acid reflux) I would begin wheezing after pushing myself a bit.

I have tried to develop a habit to move over the years (walking in my neighborhood, treadmill, Zumba, insanity type stuff, couch25k) but not much lasted more than a few weeks (though I was able to jog for about 7 straight minutes at my best!). I just HATE exercise. Breathing hard, sweating profusely, shaking muscles, etc.

Somehow I came upon Leslie Sansones stuff. At first it was laughable to me. ""Walk away the pounds""? Seriously? By walking? I read amazing reviews and great success stories so I went to YouTube and tried a 2 mile walk on there. It never really crossed my mind to quit because it was hard. It was so easy to follow I just turned it on and listened to my audiobook while walking. I checked my heart rate throughout and it stayed pretty consistent at 130-160 which is a great target for me (26 years old). After searching amazon and seeing her DVDs are so cheap I ordered a couple.

I have done this one in its entirety a few times now and it is pretty enjoyable. It has some higher intensity stuff (jogging, jumping) but I don't want to die while doing it. I can see where it would NOT be good for people with joint problems as it is a little more stress on knees, hips, and ankles but, again, it is not bad at all if you are in poorly decent shape.

For the strength portion my neck did start to ache a little for holding it up so long but my form probably isn't great. During the walk I do add a little extra sometimes (a Zumba or insanity type move) or speed it up a little.

It's too early to tell about weight loss or a changing body but hopefully I will remember to update this in a few weeks. What I am most happy about is there is actually now an exercise that I don't hate doing. I pop the DVD in and watch a tv show on my laptop (it's hard for me to focus on one thing) and I don't really miss anything. I am hopeful that with a few of these DVDs I can keep up moving whether it's a quick 1 mile or a longer 5 mile ""walk.""

I do know that after several days of her workouts I do actually feel sore ALL over but I still did my workout this morning! That's a win for me!",1389484800,8,2367,4.1459694989106755
6735126,4,B00OBQ9PDC,"I am a collector of Leslie's videos. Of all my workout collections, hers are the only ones I consistently come back to, and consistently use to get results. I have little patience or tolerance for having to learn dance steps and complicated routines. I require simple moves that get results. It's like Leslie totally gets me. I pop in any one of her videos, get moving, start sweating, keep at it for 4 to 6 weeks, lose weight, become toned, have energy, and feel great. I recently had an abdominal hysterectomy and over the course of the next 18 months I put on a lot of weight in my belly. I decided to buy this video to try and work off my belly fat.

Approximately 10 minutes after popping it in, I was ready to jump through my TV screen and slap Leslie.

Leslie, what happened to our four basic steps? When did jogging twists, squats, and jumping rope find their way into our simple, comfortable routine? This was more work on my core than I've ever done. Could this bringing me out of my comfort zone be a good thing??

I plowed through all 30 minutes. When I was done I realized a few things. First, with all that jumping around I was going to need a better bra. Second, it was the best core (stomach, abs) workout I've ever done. Third, after working out to this video for the next several weeks I just may want to hug Leslie.

Leslie, you always keep it interesting. Good looking out.",1389398400,17,1393,4.346153846153846

This DVD is different that previous walk workouts I've done, but it goes by SO fast. I remember hitting the 15 minute mark and thinking ""I have to do 15 more minutes?"" and then the next thing I knew I was DONE with TWO miles! The walking portion of this workout really does focus on moves that help your core. Couple that with the mat workouts and you are better off than you were sitting on the couch! I definitely love the mat workouts at the end. I can never get through core workouts by myself (I have no idea what I'm doing), and Leslie is very motivating and encouraging.

I don't like the exercise pals all being a size 6 and cute as bugs....she needs an out of shape old gal or guy  to make the rest of feel better. Or a cute young guy for some of us old gals to watch. I tend to listen to directions the first two sessions then turn off the volume and turn on 60's music.",1388448000,2,360,3.675324675324675
6735135,5,B00OBQ9PDC,I like this workout DVD cause you really get a great workout. I love the Intervals and that this workout targets the belly.  I SO needed this one!  Thanks Leslie,1388361600,,161,4.333333333333333

6735137,4,B00OBQ9PDC,"Just when I had mastered the other Leslie walking routines she gives me the gift of creating this one.  it is full of new moves, but keeping with her original 4 exercises.  She throws in surges, boots, squats, and lots of core burning moves that actually reminded me that you should sweat when you are doing Leslie routines.  She really out did herself with this one and if you are already walking with Leslie add this to your library.",1388102400,,435,4.481012658227848

6735139,4,B00OBQ9PDC,This is my first purchase of a Leslie Sansone walking workout. I have enjoyed it and have gotten a good workout. Once I learn the routine I should be sweating even more. It comes with additional floor exercises for belly flattening and although I've never preferred a lot of stomach/floor exercises Leslie makes it easy to follow yet gets you working. She's a very positive person and makes the workout fun.,1387670400,,407,4.746478873239437
6735140,5,B00OBQ9PDC,I have to admit that I've only done the workout once. I was stiff and sore and walking funny for a week afterwards. This tells me that i really need the toning and that if I continue it could work. The workout is deceptively simple I think it is the repetition that gets you sore. Overall I loved it and I acknowledge the need to stick with it to see results.,1387670400,,359,4.070422535211268

6735153,4,B00OBQ9PDC,I started this 2 weeks ago and have other DVDs as well. I really enjoy the workouts and have seen a difference already. I haven't lost any weight but have lost inches. The only thing I really don't like is that she talks through the whole thing and over the music. Repeating the same thing over and over again when the moves are the same is really annoying. I especially hate how many times she says walk walk walk :) But I love the workouts nonetheless,1385078400,,453,4.27906976744186
6735154,1,B00OBQ9PDC,I had to rate it a one because halfway through the DVD it skips and doesn't work until you get to the ab workouts at the end.  If it worked I think it would be a great workout.,1384473600,2,176,3.6315789473684212
6735155,4,B00OBQ9PDC,I Love Leslie she is a very upbeat and fun gal  I started with her a while back and I love that you can follow along very easily and quickly would reccomend this to any beginner or walker who wants a different routine when its ugly outside,1384214400,,239,4.085106382978723

6735157,5,B00OBQ9PDC,A good exercise program to follow it you require to work on your mid section.  It really pushes the body to perform without being too strenuous. If you have been doing the earlier DVDs Leslie Sansone then this DVD is s bit higher in performance. Must do for everyone who requires a more toned down mid section,1383955200,,309,4.421052631578948
6735158,5,B00OBQ9PDC,I love this workout DVD.....I have others that are 3 mile workouts....even though this is only 2 miles it's more intense than the others that I have.  It has the same basic steps but yet there are different steps and movements included.  I love Leslie Sansone and I enjoy working out at home without interuptions of others when you are in a gym.  I have lost weight just by using these products without any effort. I have dropped 2 pant sizes in the last 5 to 6 months.  Looking forward to purchasing more of these products.,1383868800,2,524,4.427083333333333

6735161,5,B00OBQ9PDC,I did not but this from Amazon but I will still give my review since I bought this at the store.  This is my first Leslie Sansone DVD walk workout and I this was a good buy.  A very good walking workout and not too hard to deal with.  Leslie does say if you cannot do anymore just simply walk or just skip to the cooling down section.  So pretty much she's good overall in her walking workouts.,1383523200,,394,4.012820512820513

6735164,5,B00OBQ9PDC,I really enjoyed this DVD. I bought this because it's on Collage Video's top 10 videos. I already have a ton of Leslie's video but this one really does hit the abs. I have only done the walking part and not the ab workout as I'm fairly advanced and suspect Leslie's strength training would be too easy.  But the walking part is very good. I like the variety of moves. At first I wasn't a fan of the twists and the jumps but I've grown to like it. It's a nice 2 mile at a brisk pace.,1383350400,,482,3.9690721649484537
6735165,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"Love it!!  I have been doing Leslie's tapes for a few years now and it has been the ONLY exercise regime I have ever followed.  Happy to say I have lost 60 lbs SO FAR.  I am over 60 so I'm very happy with my success.  After so many ups and downs, this is the first time I can truly say that I will never gain that weight back.  So how do I say Thank You for giving me that confidence. I  truly owe Leslie Sassone for a more fulfilling life.

6735166,4,B00OBQ9PDC,I like this dvd although I expected a little more challenge.  It's easy to do and to finish.  I haven't done the floor exercise so maybe that's a little more challenging.,1383091200,,170,4.451612903225806

6735169,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"I just started working out again after about a year. The doctor suggest I walk instead of run because of a bum knee from years of running. (bummer). So I reluctantly bought this dvd. WOW!!  I got the best overall work out you could get. Leslie incorporates a low impact aerobics within a high powered 2 mile walk, in 30 minutes. The best thing about it is I can exercise inside, anytime, 3 times a week and I feel so much better. There is even floor exercise in part 3 of the dvd, but hey a little at a time(: I sent my sister a belly blasting walk dvd. I hope she likes it as much as I do. P.S. I can see the changes in just 3 workouts. Thank you Leslie",1382745600,4,654,3.9545454545454546
6735170,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"Let me start this review off by saying that I was hesitant to purchase a Leslie Sansone DVD. I know it's unfair, but she's an ""older"" (above 30) woman, and myself in my early 20's thought that this would be an ""old lady's workout"". While this workout would be friendly to beginners and people not too experienced with exercise, it was still totally effective for me, and I feel badly for pre-judging Ms. Sansone's DVDs.

True, it's not as hardcore of a workout as some of the Jillian Michael's DVDs I have, but it's still a good workout. I could do this everyday, never tire of it, and still be in great shape. I only do the JM DVDs because I'd like to get ripped, but Leslie Sansone's walking DVDs are great for both maintaining a healthy weight and getting in a complete and adequate daily workout. Also, I love to pop this DVD in and do it, whereas I pretty much dread the Jillian Michael's DVDs because they're so hard. Being challenged is a good thing, but I think this DVD in particular finds a good middle ground. It's never EASY, but it's not so hard that I want to die.

The floor work is very good here as well, in particular the 2nd one, which I can feel the results in my butt right now. Ouch (but a good ouch).

I'm excited to purchase more of Leslie's DVDs, particularly the 5-mile ones.",1382659200,4,1301,4.323770491803279

6735172,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"I liked this workout and the supplemental workout for polishing the core area. I do different workouts and this is one I like having in my line up. In fact, I have several of Leslie's walking taps in my library.",1382486400,,211,4.3

There is a lot if twisting involved in this workout, so make sure you have no physical limitations that would make it difficult to do the moves.  Definitely a keeper.",1382400000,,301,4.339285714285714

6735177,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"I accidentally bought leslie dvd walk away the pound, a few months ago and been a fan since. I was looking for her other dvd as i kind of used to the walk away the pound for this 2 months. I came across a few of her dvds in amazon since i live overseas. From the reviews i bought a few of her dvd. The dvds arrive like 2 days ago and decided to try this belly walk.
OMG, its the best. Its really the exercise i been looking for. Eventhough its 2 mile but i felt its different from her other 2 miles. There's a jog, jump and its all still easy to follow. Its a good exercise bring ur heart rate up in a second and down the next, which is more effective for fat burning. The exercise last around 30 mins which is good, doesnt take too much time but effective. Plus there are 2 floor exercise that you can choose. It last about 10 mins each. You can do it after the walk, basically its based on pilates. For me i love it, really focus on your abs muscle. I really love leslie, her exercises is easy to follow and it works. Hope it works with you guys too :)",1382140800,,1054,3.9299065420560746
6735178,4,B00OBQ9PDC,Love Leslie. Just wish she talked less. I've listened to the same talk over 100 times. I would turn diwn the volume but then I wouldn't hear beat of music.,1382054400,,155,4.2
6735179,4,B00OBQ9PDC,"It is a fast 1/2 hour, two mile walk. I really felt it in my back and stomach and arms, as well as stomach. I felt really good afterwards too. As I get used to it, I may add weights. It does go fast and then slows down, but I think that is recommended to burn calories.

She jumps quickly to other moves, but even if you lose a step or two, it's not rocket surgery to change too. You'll be ready by the 2nd or 3rd time thru the work out. And you don't lose that much since the main thing is to keep moving.

The floor work felt great too. It was a bit hard for me, but I felt tired afterwards. I felt it thru my back and arms as well. I am not terribly overweight (10 pounds) and I have 3 kids that I run around with, but I am not in shape and don't have tons of stamina. So this may be easy peasy for someone else, it was just right for me.

The entire session takes about 53 minutes (52 something), that includes warm up, warm down, stretching, and the two floor sessions.
I enjoy this work out, but I think I will switch it out with the 3 mile basic walk she has that seem to focus more on legs. That will also keep me from getting too bored.

She does not talk like in her other ones, where she is so perky and positive. She IS positive, don't get me wrong (she keeps saying how strong you are, etc), but she switches up the moves so much that she doesn't get a chance to be talky. If that makes sense.

The walkers are younger (20s and 30s) and in fairly good shape, all women. Different sizes, but they all look better than me (haha!). I didn't care about their ages or fitness levels, since they are dressed modestly and had smiles on their faces. So it was pleasant and not intimidating. Just adding that for those that care.

All in all, glad I purchased and looking forward to continuing.",1381795200,5,1798,4.022408963585434

6735181,5,B00OBQ9PDC,Got this for my sister and she uses it regularly.  Leslie Sansone has long been an exercise regiment in our homes.,1381104000,,114,4.428571428571429
6735182,5,B00OBQ9PDC,If you could just have a different sound track so once you have learned the routine you didn't have to meet all the helpers over and over again.  You would think there could be a choice of some good music on the DVD,1381104000,,215,4.0
6735183,2,B00OBQ9PDC,"For me, the beauty of Leslie Sansone's workouts is the simplicity of the movements.  They're awesome for someone who who isn't terribly coordinated.  There are usually 4 basic steps, and these moves are altered to increase the intensity.  Even by upping the energy level, a great deal of coordination is not required.

I did not fond this 2-mile workout to be like that.  I found some of the moves very confusing.  There were lots of twists while hopping, and I felt a lot of scary stress on my ankles.  I want to get back in shape, but I don't want to get injured in the process!  So this one just isn't a safe bet for me.

There's much fewer big arm movements, which are what really get my heart rate up.  I just didn't feel like I got a very good cardio workout.  I haven't exercised in a while, and I expected this workout to challenge me.  But despite being overweight, out of shape, out of practice, and a smoker of way too many cigarettes, I was hardly winded.  For my money, and more important, my time, I'll stick with other Leslie Sansone workouts.  The Walk Slim series is my personal favorite -- it has intensity, variety, better music, and the option of turning the talking off.  I'll stick with that.",1380931200,20,1214,4.429864253393665

6735185,4,B00OBQ9PDC,"I have a few of LS's walking DVDs - if you see my reviews, you'll see my favorites.  This is not a favorite, however, it was a great workout.  I was sweating and the cool down floor exercises felt good at the end.  I checked this out from the library to see if I wanted to buy it and I've decided not to.  When I do a walking DVD, high impact, I want to continue that pace and not stop in the middle and pick right back up at the fast pace.  Leslie throws in a drop and squat during the high impact walking, a couple of times, I refuse to do them, I just kept walking through those.  I did enjoy the jog and twist, the music is perfect for these.  For those who mention she throws in a new move with no warning, these exercises (walking) are pretty easy, you just keep walking and join in.  I would imagine being an instructor is like patting your head and rubbing your belly when trying to describe what is next.  Or is that rubbing your head and patting your belly?

 I have never enjoyed floor exercises from anyone other than Jillian M., but Leslie did a good job on these.  They were a Pilates type exercise and she is very calm and clear.  You don't feel you have to hurry to keep up.

I did miss the 'regulars' from her other DVDs, I enjoy seeing returning faces and also missed the variety of ages she usually has in her other DVDs.

This was a great workout - I was sweating quite a bit during and after the workout.",1380758400,,1425,4.075539568345324

6735187,4,B00OBQ9PDC,"I am a huge Leslie Sansone fan and have been for a long time.  I have about 8-10 of her DVDs.  This one is good because it focuses on abs but the first time I did it I felt like she was totally A.D.D.  She was changing moves a lot faster than usual and sometimes with little to no warning.  After I did it a few times it was fine.  The only thing is I feel like I get a better calorie burn from her longer ""boosted"" walking videos.  I wish she would do a new advanced 45 minute ab video.  I guess if you do the floor exercises this probably is but I am just used to her cardio/strength combo workouts so I haven't done the floor part yet.

I can tell you this.  If you want an easy to follow work out Leslie's videos are fool proof.  I am extremely uncoordinated and I can do these so that should tell you how easy they are.  They are also pretty fun.  The ""4 Fast Miles"" and ""4 Big Miles"" are my favorite workouts.  I also just bought another newer one called ""Walk It Off in 30 Days"" and I really like this one too.",1380585600,,1017,3.902439024390244

6735192,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"I LOVE LESLIES TAPES, BUT, THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES and I have about 10 of her DVD's. They are all good but, I do love this one. She is motivating and gets you too lose those inches!!!!!",1379462400,,189,3.871794871794872
6735193,4,B00OBQ9PDC,"I own maybe 5 or 6 Leslie DVD's.  I'm a big fan!  Was about to get the new 5 Mega Miles one but decided against it when I found out that you couldn't customize the miles you want from the DVD menu.

I thought the introduction on Belly Bleasting Walk was a bit slow,  but the workout picks up and she has a nice variety of movements in this one.  I am NOT crazy about the leg-swing, but I can substitute it for something else when she does that.  Because of the variety of moves, it goes by quickly and the next thing you know, you've done a half hour of exercise.  :-)

My all-time favorite DVD is the Ultimate 5 Day Walk Plan because you all you have to do is go to the DVD menu, click ""customize"" and then highlight the miles or sessions you want to do.  There are days when all I can fit in is one of those miles, but I feel good because at least I've done something.

Still, I'll do this one because she incorporates more twisting, which strenthens lateral abdominals.",1379376000,2,972,4.122340425531915
6735194,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"I put it in the minute I got it and loved it.  It starts slow, then without realizing it you are sweating!  Great belly exercises in the mat exercise portion.",1379116800,2,158,4.233333333333333
6735195,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"I loved it, except for the exercises at the end were too straining on my neck and I couldn't do them.  The walk is excellent though, so I highly recommend this one.",1379116800,,164,4.125
6735196,5,B00OBQ9PDC,Excellent workout with a good beat and music. The abdominal exercises at the end of the tape were also good. My muscles were sore the next day so obviously worked. I am a fan of hers.,1378857600,,183,4.111111111111111
6735197,4,B00OBQ9PDC,"I'm a Leslie Sansone fan and I really like this workout.  It is a fast but potent workout and does
target the belly area and who doesn't need that!",1378857600,,147,4.068965517241379
6735198,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"This is another great workout dvd from Leslie Sansone.  It includes a 30 minute walking segment with some new moves, as well as two strength training sessions which are a bit of a challenge.  I'm glad I purchased it.",1378771200,,216,4.512820512820513
6735199,5,B00OBQ9PDC,I love this DVD. I used often on my exercise routine and it is very good. I recommend this DVD,1378598400,,94,3.75
6735200,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"I have been to some Just WALK classes taught locally. Prior to this DVD I had two other Leslie DVDs that were lost. They were some of Leslie's older work, she had blonde hair and older instructors with her.  One was kickboxing which was my favorite and another was strength.  I enjoyed both of them but considered them both to beginner level for light days or to kick start after a period of not working out.  This DVD is different, the instructors are younger, the background is more modern.  The pace is quicker, which is why it is called ""fast miles"".  There are some high impact points which I could do but I often will modify out of due to knee issues.  As always the moves are easy to follow and fun.  I was just lightly sore the next day.  I do the whole set through for the 2 fast miles and the 24 minutes at the end of strength. If in a time crunch just one or the two set is still a solid work out.  I found the strength a challenging but attainable level. 53 total mins.  I would recommend this video to Leslie fans but if you are not familiar with her latest work to expect a little different.  Also if you have not tried her before or are an intermediate looking for a change up I think you would enjoy this as well.",1378512000,3,1229,4.143459915611814
6735201,5,B00OBQ9PDC,I enjoy this dvd.  I do my walks in the park with the dog then on some days do this dvd also.,1378425600,,93,3.227272727272727
6735202,3,B00OBQ9PDC,I really like her Walk Your Belly Flat better.  It is not as hard on the joints and the toning is much better.,1378339200,7,110,3.782608695652174
6735203,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"I'm a huge fan of boot camp, yoga, and core work outs but as I am getting older, I can hear and feel my knees pop and my shoulders are constantly achy.  I decided to ease off of my usual routines and change the pace with ""Leslie Sansone: Belly Blasting Walk DVD"". It's fantastic!  I am able to listen to audio books on my iPhone because it doesn't really bother me if I'm off a step or two.  Her narration doesn't really matter either so combining a personal development audio book (you must exercise the mind, too) along with physical exercise is like getting the best of both worlds!  I love it so much I bought the dvd for older adults for my mom.

There is also an ab work out on this dvd.  It is by far THE BEST CUED ab work out that I have personally seen.

I'm getting ready to buy another one of her dvd's!  Yay!",1378252800,,820,4.08125
6735204,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"I have a back injury and am unable to do super high impact exercising. This work out is actually perfect for me cause I sweat like crazy, but there's not a huge amount of twisting or bending. Perfect!",1377561600,,200,4.2894736842105265
6735205,5,B00OBQ9PDC,I love all of her walk tapes. This was great! I like the pace and the fact that you can vary the workouts. Lets you work at your own pace.,1377561600,,138,3.6333333333333333
6735206,4,B00OBQ9PDC,"The Belly Blasting Walk with Leslie Sansone is easy and I like because it is in 15 minutes intervals, I can do half in the morning and the other half in the evening.",1377302400,2,165,4.03030303030303
6735207,3,B00OBQ9PDC,This one is OK but not one of my faves.  It is a 30 minute cardio workout and then toning.  I use it maybe once a week as a fill in or when I am in a rush and have less than an hour to get my workout done.  I like Leslie's videos a lot and have several but this one is not a fave.,1377216000,2,280,3.276923076923077
6735208,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"as always leslie sansone tapes are the best.  this tape is especially good for  the abs.  I would recommend any of her tapes,",1376784000,,125,4.3478260869565215
6735209,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"I have quite a few of Leslie's Walk at Home DVDs, but I'm especially glad I got this one, because of the two 10-minute toning sessions for the core. They are super powerful--and fun!",1376697600,,182,4.382352941176471
6735210,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"I love this video.  After working the video on time I rediscovered muscle I had forgotten about.  This is a good fun workout that doesn't take too much time unless you do the toning exercises, which I do recommend.  I alternate workouts throughout the week.",1376006400,,257,4.666666666666667
6735211,5,B00OBQ9PDC,I like this DVD because it's a 30 minute walk. It's the perfect one for someone who doesn't have a lot of time. I love that you get a great 2 mile work out.,1375833600,,156,3.6176470588235294
6735212,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"The chatter is rather annoying, but the walking portion and the ab workouts are easy to follow, low impact and effective.",1375747200,,121,4.809523809523809
6735213,4,B00OBQ9PDC,"Leslie Sansone's Belly Blasting Walk was a high impact exercise. It was an intense 2 miles. She added some new moves; for example, jump rope, squats (minis and regulars), jumps, jabs, running, etc. This DVD gives you 30 minutes of working out where 10 minutes is a boosting session. The boost session definitely raises your heart level through intense movements. She also includes a warm up and cool down. Only thing is a couple times the transition wasn't as smooth as it could have been. Even with that, I will do this one again.",1375660800,,531,4.659574468085107
6735214,5,B00OBQ9PDC,I ORDERED A PACKAGE OF 3 DVDs OF WHICH THIS IS ONE OF THEM.  THE OTHER 2 ARE THE 5-DAY CHALLENGE & THE 4 MILE POWER WALK.  I ORDERED THEM ON THURS AND GOT THEM ON FRIDAY!  I DID THIS ONE THE SAME DAY AND LOVED IT. THESE DVDs HAVE NEW MOVES & NEW MUSIC.  I LOVE THE POWER SURGES; THEY REALLY CRANK UP YOUR HEART RATE AND MAKE YOU SWEAT!  THESE ARE MORE CHALLENGING THAN THE OLDER ONES. THESE ARE CERTAINLY MY NEW FAVORITES!,1375660800,,422,3.9176470588235293
6735215,4,B00OBQ9PDC,Good workout with a lot of twisting in it.  Would have liked a little bit more vigorous of a floor routine for myself.,1375574400,,118,4.130434782608695
6735216,3,B00OBQ9PDC,"If you have a strong back and like to dance, you'll love this CD. My back can't take jumping or/and twisting, and I don't like to dance, so it's not for me. I didn't know what to rate it --- it's a 5-star if you like to dance and a 2-star for me.",1375488000,31,246,3.660377358490566
6735217,5,B00OBQ9PDC,Loved this new Walking Tape by Leslie Sansone.  It gives you a really good workout.  Love the added workouts on the floor.,1375488000,,122,4.5
6735218,5,B00OBQ9PDC,Great DVD.  Love the two floor exercise sessions.  I like how she does two different types of routines for different muscle groups.  These really get your abs talking and I feel that my back is stronger.,1375488000,,203,4.583333333333333
6735219,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"I have many of Leslie Sansone's walking dvds. Like all the others, it is easy to follow and it really does work your abs.",1375401600,,121,4.083333333333333
6735220,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"Yep, love another one by Leslie Sansone - I have three now.  Great to take on the road with me and just pop it in my lap top.",1375142400,,125,3.4642857142857144
6735221,5,B00OBQ9PDC,Leslie never disappoints. Needed a new Walking at Home video to get me moving again and this fit the bill perfectly.,1375056000,,116,4.571428571428571
6735222,4,B00OBQ9PDC,It is not as fast paced as other Leslie Sansone workouts. I bought it based on other reviews. It is overall good but I like some of her other Walk workouts better.,1374451200,,163,4.125
6735223,5,B00OBQ9PDC,i like this series because i am a beginner and i can follow along and feel like i am getting a good workout,1373760000,,107,3.6956521739130435
6735224,4,B00OBQ9PDC,I really like that Leslie has two sets of floor exercises for the abs - one works the front and the second works the back.  Each is 10 minutes long.  Great 2 mile walk but just wish it was longer.  I use the floor work in combination with her other DVDs that are longer walks.,1373673600,2,276,3.981818181818182
6735225,4,B00OBQ9PDC,"If you don't have much time, this a good work out to get in - if you need more of a work out it won't be enough",1373500800,,111,3.1481481481481484
6735226,4,B00OBQ9PDC,Different from Leslies usual I enjoyed it. Good for ABS and LEGS. Will make you sweat. Hard but do able,1373328000,,103,4.2
6735227,5,B00OBQ9PDC,Leslie Sansone has been at this for a long time. She has learned a lot an the people who invest in her DVDs reap the rewards.,1373241600,,125,3.8461538461538463
6735228,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"Glad to be able to get this author's DVD's so reasonably priced and with such great, prompt shipping. A real bargain. Great workout",1373241600,,131,4.739130434782608
6735229,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"The walking portion of this workout is good, but the floor exercise parts (Part 1 and 2) are great.  The moves are similar to Pilates and takes endurance and strength, but Leslie is encouraging.  I can definitely feel this after a work out.  Highly recommend!",1373155200,,259,4.711111111111111
6735230,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"I have several of her DVD workouts, and this is one of my favorites. I have several of the DVD programs at various locations, and put one in for a quick pick-me-up.",1373068800,,164,4.15625
6735231,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"This DVD contains a really excellent floor workout session- something I've needed for a long time and that I used to do in the aerobics classes I took for decades. This DVD is quite recent and Leslie looks to be her best shape ever and also seems more reserved, cool and professional than in her DVDs of yore. We'll wear this DVD out!",1373068800,2,334,4.317460317460317

6735233,5,B00OBQ9PDC,good workout. I like doing a variety of movements for a total body workout. Haven't purchased workout yet i havenn't liked. Can't wait for her new one to come out.,1372809600,,163,4.466666666666667
6735234,5,B00OBQ9PDC,this is great easy and yet only 30 minute workout and you get a good sweat going and feel so good afterwards.,1372809600,,109,4.0
6735235,3,B00OBQ9PDC,"If Leslie insists on talking her way thru all her videos, the music needs to be louder!  This is the 2nd DVD that I have of hers in which the music is barely audible.  The routine was fine.  If you have balck problems, tho, be cautious with the ""plank.""  Maybe modify it.  That COULD have been mentioned during the routine. Over all, though, I really like the walking videos.  Good for young people and oldies but goodies alike.",1372723200,8,428,4.423076923076923
6735236,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"Once  I went over the program and  began a daily routine that evolved it as part of my work out. The results became apparent quickly. First,  how my cloths fit, then my posture and finally I was not having to make a conscious effort to hold in my abdomen.
My love handles are beginning to shrink. Another month and I think they will completely be gone. When you get it' stick with it, it works.",1372464000,,394,4.226666666666667
6735237,5,B00OBQ9PDC,I really appreciate Leslie for developing a program that helps people that are not ready for a marathon yet or even to walk a mile. She offers a safe plan for all fitness levels. The enthusiasm and hope coupled with the exercise makes her collection priceless.,1372377600,,260,4.673913043478261
6735238,4,B00OBQ9PDC,"Overall, this is pretty good workout.  I found the abs workout to be good - not intimidating - but pretty comprehensive.  I did have to change the soundtrack to my Leslie workouts.  I have custom soundtracks with all the fun workout songs and it makes this workout go by fast and it is so much fun - feels like a dance workout because the music makes me want to do more....love my music.

Still getting used to the ab workout so we'll see what my results look like over the next few months....will post an update later....",1372377600,,522,4.350515463917525
6735239,5,B00OBQ9PDC,I love Leslie Sansone's approach to exercise.  Her bubbly personality and presentation are so encouraging.  This is my 6th Sansone workout DVD,1372118400,,142,5.409090909090909
6735240,5,B00OBQ9PDC,I have several of Leslie Sansone's walking dvd's and I am glad I added this to my collection.  She uses some different moves from many of her other workouts - a bit more challenging and it really gets your heart rate up.,1372118400,,220,4.238095238095238
6735241,5,B00OBQ9PDC,I have used Leslie Sansone workouts in the past and this belly blast workout adds another dimension to the calorie burning walks.,1371859200,,129,4.909090909090909

6735243,4,B00OBQ9PDC,I am a big fan of Leslie Sansone and really like this workout. It is exactly what I was looking for and more challenging than her other tapes.,1371772800,,142,4.107142857142857
6735244,5,B00OBQ9PDC,I think this was a great walking workout and the time passes so quickly and you are done.  I recommend this one.,1371427200,,112,4.090909090909091
6735245,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"Very good DVD, this DVD targets all the right spots. So good thinking of purchase some more of Leslie's DVD's",1371340800,,109,4.5
6735246,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"This is definitely advanced - you sweat and jump a lot more.  I really enjoyed it.  I won't be doing it every day as there are some jumping, etc. and I don't think my body will be able to handle that much every day but definitely one to do at least 1-2 times a week for some change up moves.  I really enjoyed this video.  It is different from her other videos but in a good way.  I even find myself doing some of these moves in her other videos now instead of what she is doing for some added belly blasting.  If you are on the fence about getting this one - just buy it!!  I'm glad I did!!",1370908800,,591,3.875
6735247,4,B00OBQ9PDC,"I liked this video pretty well.  It wasn't as long or varied as the 5 day workout video, where you can choose different miles for each weekday, but it is a good workout.  There's a warm up and 1 mile on one portion, and another mile and cool down on the second portion.  There are also two floor exercises to choose from (one mostly works front abdomen, and one back abdomen).  There is a group of ladies walking, and they do seem on the more ""fashion"" side, with fancier hairdos than you'd typically expect for workouts, but whatever.  There's a lot of twisting moves, which I assume helps with the belly muscles.",1370822400,,614,4.446428571428571
6735248,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"I love this DVD.  Leslie Sansone introduces some new variations that really target the abs and belly.  The 20 minutes of ab workout after the two miles of  the walking workout offer a challenge that is great for someone looking to step up a bit from Leslie's other DVDs.  I have several Leslie Sansone DVDs and this is one of my favorites. If you are looking to decide between this DVD and her ""Walk Your Belly Flat"" three mile DVD, I would recommend this one.",1370822400,,460,4.376470588235295

6735250,4,B00OBQ9PDC,"I like this well enough. I got it cheap enough. I didn't care for the jumping due to foot trouble, but it's a pretty descent workout. I have a few of her workouts and can't complain too much about them. I don't know if it was my old DVD player, but it wouldn't let me choose the one I wanted to start. Kept going back to where I stopped it at.",1370649600,,343,3.8450704225352115
6735251,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"I just completed this Leslie Sansone Belly Blasting Walk DVD.  Very nice change.  I purchased it a while back and thought it wouldn't be enough since it was only 30 mins of walking with the toning.  Well, I was wrong!  I've got sweat dripping everywhere and so glad I finally decided to do it.  I LOVE the newer ""belly"" moves and faster pace.  Like Leslie says, ""I LOVE to sweat""! It was also nice to only walk the 30 mins and have the toning segment which was really good.  Love it..... Can't wait until the next time...",1370649600,,521,4.309278350515464

6735266,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"I really like Leslie's routines so I was looking for something new - something with an increased intensity and calorie burn. This one met my expectations. It offers a great aerobic workout that can fit into most any schedule (30 min.). It can be scaled down if I don't want to do some of the moves (like when they hop from one foot to another, as I prefer not to do that). It also has the targeted segment, which offers a good workout too. I am very pleased with this CD. I hope Leslie offers more soon.",1368921600,,503,4.195876288659794
6735267,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"This is one of my favorite Leslie DVDs.  A little higher impact than her older stuff, which I was looking for.  The walk is roughly 30 mins and then there are 2 sets of floor exercises.  I like the first set but will need to work up to the second.  Highly recommend.",1368748800,,266,4.0576923076923075

6735270,4,B00OBQ9PDC,"Leslie has kicked up her workout a notch with this release. It is a more energetic two-mile walk-out than several of her other DVDs that I own. This is exactly what I was seeking to burn a few more calories beyond my favorite Leslie and Ellen Barrett DVDs. Although you will get a heart-pumping 31 minutes, this title is less physically demanding than typical bootcamp workouts. This is a plus for me, since I like to sweat but can't do all the acrobatic moves of most bootcamp DVDs. Belly Blasting Walk is a great choice for those who have reached a plateau in their fitness journey when walking, Yoga, Pilates, etc. are not providing enough burn.

There are plenty of knee-lift, kicking, and sidestep intervals, which Leslie builds with fast arm movements. Several intervals feature hip-swishing moves that wake up layers of core muscles. Leslie and her small, pleasant group also do short jogs and walking intervals that move forward and backward. The two 10-minute mat sequences are easy to do for core strengthening if you are an intermediate exerciser.

I'm taking one star off a five-star rating due to cueing and pacing issues. I sometimes lose Leslie's pace or repeat booster moves when the group suddenly returns to walking. At times, her cueing is very sudden. In other instances, she says we're going to do sidesteps, etc., but continues to walk for several counts. When background songs change, some ladies are not with the beat. I noticed one instance where the lead exerciser featured in back of Leslie actually stepped with two left feet to match Leslie's walk.

Despite these flaws, it's an awesome workout. I will always love ya, Leslie!",1368489600,3,1655,4.861702127659575
6735271,4,B00OBQ9PDC,"As mentioned by other reviewers, this is only 2 miles, and it goes by pretty fast.  The entire workout, including doing both of the floor workouts is 50 minutes (30 minutes for the walking and stretch, 10 minutes for each floor routine).

The second floor workout has many of the exercises I used to do in a healthy backs yoga class, and I was happy to see those here.

This is a solid workout that I will combine with other Leslie walks.",1368489600,2,438,4.317073170731708

Do love the high impact and new moves added to the basic Leslie moves.  Waist toning is excellent.  Also enjoy the scenery and some new faces, too.  Would recommend that if you have bad knees you stick to the low impact version they also show.

6735299,4,B00OBQ9PDC,"Leslie's done a great job ramping up the walk with fun new moves for both feet and arms. There are quite a few moves that twist the trunk to work the obliques.
There's a good boost section that encompasses the end of the first mile & beginning of the 2nd.
There's a clean break between the miles, so you could do just one, but you'd be hitting the ground running if the 2nd mile is the one you chose.

The floor part is in 2 sections.
First is on your back. Variations on crunches, bridges & leg lifts. Killer, but do-able stuff.
The second is where I ran into trouble. It's on the stomach & hands-&-knees. There are some killer yoga planks & push-ups involved.  I've got a knee injury & couldn't do this set.
I'll try again after I get a super cushy mat, but couldn't do it on just a folded blanket.

I've got 2 of Leslie's 4 mile walks, 3 5 milers, The Big Burn, & 1 other sculpting video.
I enthusiastically recommend this video.
The walk section is a good tough workout that can be done in  hour.",1366243200,4,1000,4.192708333333333

6735301,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"I have quite a few of Leslie's videos and really enjoy them.  We've been using some of her other videos for about 3 months and decided to get some new ones for variety.  This one is definitely higher impact than her more traditional walking videos and although I can't do all of the moves in this one due to health limitations, I still did the entire 2 mile walk with some modifications to some of the moves.  In addition to the two mile walk, we've also done the first of the floor exercises.  Although we've only done both routines twice, I can definitely feel the effect in my stomach area.  We've done the floor exercises immediately after finishing the 2 mile walk, so by then we are pretty worn out and couldn't do everything that she did.  I also modified some of those moves as well, but I can see potential for this going a long way to getting a trimmer waistline.  I can't want to see the results in a few weeks.  The only suggestion I'd make if you are considering this video, is that you begin with some of her less intense videos first before moving to this one.  Having already been using some of her other lower impact walking videos, made it easier for me to handle most of the moves in this one.  Also, my husband is using the videos with me and he finds this one is really a work out for him too.  So her videos are great for ladies and men.",1366156800,5,1359,4.228682170542636

6735308,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"I've been walking with Leslie Sansone for years. I have almost all of her DVD's (and VCR tapes). This newest one is one of my favorite. Leslie takes you on a 2 mile fast-paced cardio walk with an energetic group of walkers.  She adds a toning/ab workout plus her usual cool down and stretch. The first time and each time I exercise with this DVD , I reallly feel it in my abs as she has some moves that are new to this workout along with her tried and true walk in place, knee and leg lifts. FYI, I'm 51 years old, in moderately good shape and had hip replacement surgery 2 years ago. This DVD is doable and enjoyable. It gets you moving, energized and is effective. For the price, I think it can't be beat. I workout in my home at my convenience and I see results. Besides losing weight, you feel great and endorphins kick in when you exercise with Leslie. As she says, our bodies are made for motion. Forget the diet pills and drinks and fads and try this DVD.",1365465600,6,962,4.2

I dislike all of the floor exercises and only tried a few minutes of them 1 time.  I like more walking and core exercises from a standing position.  I liked the new moves she incorporated in this DVD that I hadn't seen in others that I own (I own about 15 Leslie Sansone DVD's and have been walking with her for years).

I often have to add quite a bit (using bigger arm movements or some type of higher impact move) to get my heart rate up, but don't have to with this one.  If you're using Leslie for getting a certain number of steps in every day, this might not be for you.  For me, it's under two miles in steps, BUT it's a great workout.  Love the jumping squats that are so easy to make bigger.
The two additional segments are for abs and back and they are very good.  Each being ten minutes long, you really work each area.

The 2 miles I assumed would have knee lifts and torso moves and movement for the waist. BOY oh BOY was I pleasantly surprised, this DVD had me sweating way before I got to the end of mile 1. The twists, squats and other new challenging moves really kicked my work out into high gear.
It is my plan to use this one for 30 days and see where I am afterwards.

See this is what I get for thinking awww 2 miles easy peesy...HA!!!!
This DVD is not for someone just starting their journey, if you are looking for quick movements, high calorie burn, and total movement this is the DVD for you. If you're just beginning try one of Leslie's earlier 2 or 3 mile DVD.

6735319,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"I absolutely LOVE this DVD!  The Belly Blasting Walk workout is my first with Leslie Sansone.  I'm a busy, 34-year-old with very limited time within which to squeeze in a workout.  For me, this means that whatever I do to stay active and healthy HAS to enjoyable.  As a result, I've bought a slew of DVDs and just as many workouts looking for the best, most fun way for me to tone my abs.  As it turns out, I love to walk, so when I saw this DVD featured on my Amazon page, I just had to give it a shot.  A WALK that will tone the heck out of my belly?  Yes, please!  After placing my order, however, I noticed several reviews on here that led me to question my purchase.  I am so glad that I ignored the ""negative"" reviews and tried the workout anyway.  Leslie's Belly Blasting Walk is really fun, challenging, and did I mention fun?  Leslie's got a great personality, the moves that she has incorporated into the workout are simple and easy-to-follow, and the girls she walks with on the DVD seem to be having a lot of fun as well.  The sculpting floor exercises are fantastic, too, if not even better.

Is the Belly Blasting Walk the next P90X or Insanity?  No.  Is it an enjoyable, high-intensity workout that most certainly will produce results?  Definitely.

I'm really glad I purchased this DVD.  Just give the thing a try.  At best, you'll have fun walking, burning some calories, and steadily trimming your waist.  At worst?  You'll have fun walking, burning some calories, and trimming your waist!",1365033600,2,1507,4.466911764705882

6735324,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"I AMA big LS fan, with about 15 or so of her videos. The last 2 or 3 of her videos, featuring the younger cast rather than the ladies she'd featured for years, we're all ok, but they didn't really inspire me. However, THIS video I just love. It is one of the few I actually wish went 3 miles rather than just 2- it is that much fun. I admit, I haven't done the toning portions of the video, but I ADORE the cardio portion. There are the basic steps, but then Leslie adds more dancing moves that make it fun, but still doesn't transition into a full-scale dance aerobics routine. It's just the right amount of activity for a person like me, with an injured hip- I can work up a sweat without doing further damage to the joint. The one complaint I have is with the musical choices- why, in the name of all that is holy,did she decide to repeat the same 25-year old song (""The Heat Is On"" from Beverly Hills Cop) twice in one 30 minute routine? I know there must have been other music she could have used! Barring that questionable choice, I now use this video about 3 times a week, and genuinely wish it was longer! I hope Leslie's next DVD is as much fun as this one, and if she brings back some of her old cast, so much the better.",1364774400,,1231,4.1120331950207465

This one has a good concept but the moves for the two mile walk with the impossible to hear music and the faster rhythm, just do not combine for a good workout experience. If there was an option for music only, it may be better. I had no trouble doing any of the exercises, just found it to be choppy--the routine did not flow smoothly.",1363132800,10,380,4.219178082191781

6735358,4,B00OBQ9PDC,"I have several of Leslie's walking workout DVDs.  I really enjoy her because I get  workout while not being over worked.  I am not a big fan of exercising but her programs are easy to use and adjust to your personal fitness level.  And she does not yell at you while you are doing it!  The Belly Blasting Walk is a great addition to her collection.  This workout is 1/2 hour of her usual program moves along with some new moves I had not done before.  The walk is fast paced and you do work up a sweat, but there was nothing I couldn't handle.  When I felt a little too overwhelmed I was able to go back to a walk and still keep up the fast past.  After the 2 miles are over (and it feels as if it's over quicker than 30 minutes) there are two toning sessions.  One works your abs with standard crunches and bicycles and other moves done lying on your back.  The second session does more work of your back and involves kneeling and doing leg raises and arm raises.  I really recommend this as an addition to any of the Leslie walks you already own or as a first time walker!",1363046400,,1074,4.110576923076923

6735360,4,B00OBQ9PDC,"The idea behind the workout is a high calorie burn to lose the belly fat. There is a lot of bouncing and crunching of course, but added are a lot of squats and lunges. Hence the sore thighs. Following the walk are 2 floor routines: 1 is the standard crunches etc with legs in different positions - not too difficult but I did feel it. The second routine flips you over and works more of the back area - nice balance.  I only gave it a 4 because I haven't done the work out long enough to know whether it really blasts belly fat. I do like the routine - regardless of the belly fat issue.

I think this is good for beginner to novice, but if you are looking for ripped abs - I think you would have to do a more intense workout. This is fine for me. I am a senior with a pacemaker so this challenges me. A healthy active 30-year old might not find it challenging enough.",1363046400,4,868,4.040697674418604

The floor work is broken down into two ten-minute sections focusing on abs/core and back/core.  Again, I can always find 10 minutes!

6735381,4,B00OBQ9PDC,"NOTE:  I received a free review copy of this DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment.

This is the first Leslie Sansone workout I have done in some time.  I have tended to find her routines somewhat repetitive and not quite intense enough for my intermediate level, even when she attempts to take things up a notch (such as with her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Walk-Away-the-Pounds-Walk-and-Kick/dp/B000J4OYMM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Walk Away the Pounds - Walk and Kick</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Walk-Away-the-Pounds-Walk-and-Jog/dp/B0006213IK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Walk Away the Pounds - Walk and Jog</a>, both of which I owned for quite awhile).  In this latest DVD, however, Sansone adds quite a few new moves, and I'm happy to report that it just might be a keeper for me.

The Main Menu of this DVD offers four different options:  1) Play Entire Belly Blasting Walk, 2) Play Belly Blasting 2 Fast Miles, 3) Play Belly Blasting Floor Session 1, and 4) Play Belly Blasting Floor Session 2.  I will break down each individual segment below.  As always, Sansone is teaching live in a large studio, and she is joined by five young, long-haired, all-female background exercisers; everyone is attired brightly in pink and yellow.  One of her background exercisers shows a few modifications when Sansone specifically asks her to do so, but otherwise, low-impact modifications are NOT shown throughout the workout.

MILE #1
As always Leslie introduces her four main steps, which includes the walk (marches), side steps, knee ups, and kicks.  However, she adds MANY more variations here, including knee lifts with twists to the thigh, shuffles with punches across, larger squats with twists, and jogs forward and back with twists.  As you can see, Sansone incorporates many rotational moves with the specific intention of targeting the core.  Although this mile is fairly intense overall, Sansone builds up gradually--i.e., my heart rate did not hit my target zone until about 8 minutes into the 15.5 minute segment.

MILE #2
This mile begins at the quick pace where the first mile left off.  (Note:  The song ""The Heat is On"" is used in both miles to set a fast pace.)  Sansone adds even more new moves here, including side-facing shuffles with a punch, jumping rope and hops, and small plyo jumps.  At about 26.5 minutes, she begins slowing things down for the recovery period, and at 29 minutes, she starts about 2 1/2 minutes of very simple stretches, beginning with the upper body and then moving on to the lower.

FLOOR SESSION #1 (10.5 minutes)
This section focus on flexion.  Sansone incorporates traditional exercise such as curl-ups and bridgework.  She combines these with Pilates-inspired moves, including her version of the hundred, single leg stretch, and scissors.  Sansone moves VERY slow through this segment, and I did not think she provided effective instruction for the Pilates exercises.

FLOOR SESSION #2 (10.5 minutes)
Sansone notes that this segment will focus more on extension.  She begins on hands and knees for alternate arm/leg raises, incorporating both straight and bent leg lifts.  Coming forward, she performs half push-ups and half plank, and then coming all the way to a prone position, she moves through variations on supermans, including raising just the legs, just the arms, and alternate arm/leg.  Sansone is constantly moving in this section, flowing back to an elbow plank, adding in a few more push-ups, brief holding a full plank, and coming back to hands and knees to repeat the arm/leg raises.  She finishes by holding full plank for 10 seconds.  I liked this segment much better than the first corework section; it felt much more effective.

Overall, this is a nice new offering from Leslie Sansone.  I really enjoyed the new moves that she incorporated into the walk both to increase the intensity and to target the core.  I do wish that she had picked up the pace a bit sooner in Mile #1--and similarly, that she had delayed the start of the recovery a bit in Mile #2.  However, I do like that there is a chapter break at the start of the second mile, so I do have the option of skipping directly to that point; I may even try doing the second mile twice!  In the end, I would recommend this DVD, and if I could, I'd give it a rating of 4 1/2 stars.",1362182400,19,4404,5.149085794655415
6735382,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"I just received this item a few days ago, but I've done it every day since I've had it. I like this DVD much better than most of Leslie's other DVDs. This one is really challenging, so I'm not sure it's for beginners. There's power walking like usual, the sidesteps, kicks, and knee lifts. In this DVD she's also added some squats, jogging, and a few other new moves. You'll be sweating like crazy by the end of the first mile. The second mile just completely wears you out, which is good! There is also floor work, which is also great. I've loved every single part of this DVD.",1362096000,83,578,4.3119266055045875

6735384,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"I have many of her DVD's like a lot of LS fans and this one is very refreshing. It really gives you a good workout. I'm not an advanced user and I have weight to lose so for some people who are very fit, you may not find this challenging. Although, you may be a seasoned athlete, if you are not (smiles) There are a lot of ""boosted"" additions. If you are new to LS, the boosted parts are light jogging, boxers bounce, leg swings, hoping from side to side, jumping rope... and then you go back to a brisk walk, with knee lifts, a few squats and twists, side steps, and kicks..  This one and 3 mega miles are great additions for your collection and especially if you are needing a kick in your routine. I think you will really enjoy this one as LS is, as always, upbeat, motivating, encouraging, and she just keeps you in a great mood! There is also two ab floor workouts as well that REALLY pack a punch!!! I love LS, I have many Work out dvd's and yes, I like to switch things up to keep myself motivated and not bored to tears but no matter what, LS, is always in heavy rotation and something I always go back to over and over!!! One last thing, another reason I love her workouts is because, lets face it the only way you really keep at something for the long term is when it is doable and brings the desired results. There is no way in the world I'm going to do a hardcore Jillian michaels (nothing against JM mind you....) workout all the time all while dealing with Lupus and taking care of a family. What ever you do consistently brings the rewards and that is what matters in the long run.

6735385,5,B00OBQ9PDC,What I love about Leslie is not only do you get a moderate workout but she never fails to lift your spirits when you do one of her videos!,1361664000,4,138,3.793103448275862
6735386,5,B00OBQ9PDC,"I found Leslie by accident on Hulu. I enjoyed the clips so I decided to purchase on of her DVDS. I actually was not even aiming to lose weight, but it just started falling off. This Belly Blasting walk is quite high impact so if you are a beginner you may want to start with the modifications. The two miles go by so fast i could hardly believe it! It really does target the entire core. The floor workouts are very easy for any age, they are kind of like the cherry on top. I have lost approx 10 lbs in two weeks! I acually look forward to walking with Leslie and her mixed age group of cohorts. The music is easy to hear and follow. Just bought my third Leslie Dvd, cannot wait to drop another 10 lbs! I highly recommend this workout for anyone of any age.",1361491200,5,758,4.093959731543624
