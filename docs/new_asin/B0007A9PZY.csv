Instead of showing us the lives of soldiers and what battles were like, these films turn inside instead and show us stories and vingettes of life back home in the states while the war was raging in Europe and Japan.

You get to see how rationing and factory jobs, as well as war donations kept the country going but at a strong emotional price for hte people left behind.

Good restoration process and an interesting perspective.",1164672000,2,565,4.466019417475728
8159677,5,B0007A9PZY,"This is one of those documentaries that really makes you think. I know that when I thought of World War II I always thought the of way the soldiers fought and suffered to help us win overseas. These films, however, let you see how people at home had to suffer as well. Because everything was needed for the troops people had to ration their food, there were no new cars and everyone had to pitch in one way or another. This really made me feel proud to be an American and glad we won the war.",1154131200,,492,4.135416666666667
