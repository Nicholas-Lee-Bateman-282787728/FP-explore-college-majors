7118553,1,B00W3JQXUM,"CONTAINS PLOT SPOILERS

Six friends video chat on line a year after their friend Laura Barns commits suicide. This is followed by secrets revealed, evil suicide spirit playing ""10 little Indians"". Yes, this film had me pining for hand held camera footage. The entire film is pictures of the web cam video of the kids. All we see is the screen for the entire film. I would use the cliche ""I will never get 90 minutes of my life back"" except it was only 83 minutes and I should have walked out. Oh yea, another cliche for this film, ""Amazon won't let me give zero stars"" seems to apply.

Now I will admit, I don't video chat because I can only type naked. Perhaps young adults who spend their time video chatting with a circle of friends might love this film. I couldn't relate to it on any level. It did start off with a tease when she says, ""I want to make Prom night, tonight"" but they both stay at home in front of their computer, apparently meaning the film ""Prom Night"" and not doing the nasty.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1429920000,3,1032,4.309278350515464
7118554,1,B00W3JQXUM,"Worthless.  It's like all the other ""real footage"" rubbish, not anything to support the entire length of a film.  Avoid if you have a brain.  If you like watching dumb teens attempt to ""act"" and sit by a computer all day, then by all means pick this one up.",1429660800,4,257,4.204081632653061
7118555,3,B00W3JQXUM,"Laura Barns has some very embarrassing party videos of her posted to YouTube by certain friends (?), commits suicide, and returns to hack into her little circle's Skype/Facebook/Youtube/Google Mail/iChat accounts and play them off in deadly games against one another.

UNFRIENDED is a scarily fun film, more of the ""jump scene"" variety than the truly haunting, layered type, intended, it seems, mainly for the adolescent and adolescent-at-heart. I saw it in the theater and can testify that it elicited several screams of terror and loud ""Eews!"" of surprised disgust, mainly from the high school and college-aged kids in the audience. When it comes out on DVD and (appropriately) Instant Video, it will be a good one to watch late at night in a darkened house. Something will be lost by not seeing it on the big screen, but the Blu-ray version will definitely have its perks. There is some really gross and disturbing stuff here along with some humor, but UNFRIENDED does a nice job of separating the modes and not trying to make the scary stuff funny and vice versa.

Highs: All of UNFRIENDED takes place in the above-mentioned online forums between its teenaged characters, with virtually no view of the outside world. There's probably already a name for this technique (""cybernatural""?), but I have no idea what it is. Though confining, the whole effect is interesting; UNFRIENDED will most likely help spawn a whole new subgenre, just as the ""Blair Witch"" films assisted in the birth of ""found footage."" Some of its imitations will no doubt be quite awful; however, with a little more imagination and budget, others should well surpass UNFRIENDED. While it doesn't get preachy in this regard, there is also some nice satire on the foibles and pitfalls of social media.

Lows: It just seems that the makers of this film could have been a little more inventive in places. Though there are some good small surprises, the whole plot follows a rather predictable pattern. There are numerous blank spots and contradictions, which is almost to be expected; nevertheless, a more cohesive storyline would have been easily possible with a little more work and thought. Character development is tough in a short film using this online technique, but still, the high school cast seems soooo stereotypically California teen and comes across as a bit vapid. They're all toh-tally obsessed with who slept with whom, who started that rumor about who, who scored some good weed, etc, and that, like, keeps them from being as convincing as they might be. A little more back-story and character introduction, especially in showing what led up to Laura's suicide, would have helped, but I can see why the directors and writers didn't want to get into that. All that being said, UNFRIENDED still succeeds at believably showing adolescent rivalries and love-hate relationships even when its characters are utterly flat stereotypes.

UNFRIENDED is a film that depends entirely upon the individual. Many are bound to love it just as many are bound to be quite disappointed. It's mostly one for funzies and can't be taken too seriously, a very good very bad film. If you just enjoy a nice horror ride with something of a new twist, UNFRIENDED should be worth watching. If you enjoy dissecting films for quality of plot, acting, and so forth, there will be much you will love to hate.  Taking this film for what it is, lesser qualities aside and crabby old man of nearly 50 though I am, I basically enjoyed it.",1429574400,4,3488,4.925170068027211

Their was nothing to make you root for the kids, not even a decent jump scare in sight,nothing to really make you fear the killer and on that note, who or what was the killer?  The best scenes were in the trailer, not even the opening seconds gave a shiver up the spine and the ending, FLAT!

As an adult I found it hard to figure out what was going on as I don't use Skype and don't understand how it all works. The scare aspect of it was good and I got the premise of the movie but the typing sometimes was so fast, you couldn't read what they were saying. Typical for kids though. That's how they type and talk to each other. Scenes are quick and I found myself going back because I missed things. Acting was decent for kids and I'd recommend it to teens and young adults.",1515024000,,570,4.098214285714286

7118573,1,B00W3JQXUM,"Decent enough cautionary tale, but If I had paid money to see this in a cinema I would've walked out and demanded my money back. Watching this as a ""laptop"" screen listening to millennials talk all over each other and whine and scream hysterically (and unconvincingly, in the case of Blair Lily's ""actress"" ugh) is NOT my idea of any sort of entertainment.

When I was done, I felt the need to go to a massage parlor, or go drinking, or something to reward myself for managing to get through this tripe.

The television commercials for this were MUCH better than the movie itself.

What a waste.",1514419200,2,595,4.542056074766355

7118575,1,B00W3JQXUM,I hated this movie and you may ask why. I like the old classic horror films like Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street. This is nothing like a good horror film. The entire movie is just looking at a stupid computer screen with a bunch of dorky teenagers on skype writing messages to a dead girl who wants to kill them. It is worse than the Blair Witch project which was crap but I watched it to the end. This film I had to shut it down half way through and watch a good show.,1509840000,,481,3.9690721649484537

I can't believe I am even saying it, b/c this movie had every ingredient to be a total failure (i.e, the stupid one-sided camera angle, the 30 something ""teenagers"", the cheap computer tricks...) but this movie was complete: beginning, middle, end. pretty awesome.

7118589,3,B00W3JQXUM,"A film whose merits could also be its faults.  A teenage girl and her friends are receiving disturbing online reminders of the suicide of a classmate a year or so before.  Some anonymous member of their chat seems intent on provoking them to the point of rage, at least before she takes the last measure.  The writing is iffy - these teens seem to have sold their souls to the Internet - everything, including a call to the police, is done through an online medium.  It works in showing how histrionic and self-obsessed the characters are.  Craven and combative, they exemplify the nadir of a generation.  Written like this, I found myself not caring at all about their fate (and how obvious it is).  Is this the point?  I don't know, which is why I've gone halfsies.  The acting is hard to gauge as is the direction.  The production values are minimal.  So who exactly is being ""unfriended""?  And should we care?",1498521600,2,913,4.567901234567901

7118592,3,B00W3JQXUM,"Good, but not without lots of flaws. I quite like the tension, and the way each teen is portrayed is interested. For example, Val, one of the main character's friends, is a teen with an air of confidence and bossiness behind her tone of voice.

7118593,5,B00W3JQXUM,"I love game shows that are also mysterious in nature. This was one of those shows. I really enjoyed the way that it silently introduced the antagonist in this movie and how it released her motives for doing so at the end. The flash backs in the movie and the ways that the people die are also unique. I always wanted to watch a movie that was revolved around social media... and while many movies have done it wrong, this movie has done it right on so many levels.",1496620800,2,464,4.224719101123595

It shows Blair and her boyfriend engaging in a video where he flashes a knife... Soon her other friends pop in and it begins a night that no one may walk away from...

7118630,1,B00W3JQXUM,"There's very little to b e said about this train wreck.  It's pointless, boring and plodding, the characters are so flat and one-dimensional that it's impossible to invest in them, identify with them, or even care about them.  Also they're all such unbelievably terrible, despicable, and all together annoying people as well.

What makes this movie so entirely unwatchable is that all it is about is a group of teens and classmates who are on their computers communicating with eachother via Skype, Facebook and whatnot when they run afoul with a killer who knows about their deep, dark, secrets.  As they start being mysteriously offed, the big mystery is who's killing them and why.  I won't spoil anything about the turn out.  The turn out is dull and corny anyway.  Who the killer even is is totally predictable anyway.

Overall, if you want gore, sexy scenes, nudity, humor, camp, fun scenes of partying, or excitement, than you best look elsewhere because this dry movie offers none of those things in the least.

7118635,5,B00W3JQXUM,"This movie is AMAZING, and I am not in the least bit surprised how few people appreciate it.  It isn't actually accurate to call it a ""found footage"" movie because there is no taping going on, the story happens live.  It is brilliantly cleverly constructed.  The thing that I appreciated immediately was that everything we're watching, all the computer apps, are 100% real.  Always in movies they make up some website or something, here the whole thing takes place on Facebook, instagram, youtube, Skype, google, and macOS.  Whenever something happens, you watch her google it for more information.  And the actors are always just sitting in front of their computers.  And there's a mystery, and excitement, and it's scary.  I can tell from my own description it's difficult to explain how great this movie is.  But you have to appreciate the brilliant CRAFT of it.  I have not been so completely engrossed in a movie since Time Crimes.  Here's an example of how great the movie was.  You experience the tension of Blaire (the main character) thinking in a way that has never been shown on film before, and it could ONLY be done in this format.  She would try to figure out the right thing to say to the ""ghost,"" and she would type something, sometimes fast, sometimes slow, then she would back up and say something else, and it actually showed us what she was going through in a way that has never been seen before.  As I said, the brilliance of this movie is about eight miles over the heads of most people on here.",1476489600,19,1517,4.611940298507463

7118639,2,B00W3JQXUM,"Following the suicide of a schoolmate, six skyping teens find their regular session invaded by a malevolent troll intent on revealing their dark secrets.
Well, it had to be done. I guess the editing of this is extremely clever, and why not try it on a standard ghost story? Windows layered on windows, real time typing and clicking, octobox web cammery, buffering youtube vids, pixellating feeds. It's more pure than Open Windows, but still it doesn't work.
First problem is it's just boring to watch information typed out on screen, even when the deletes suggest the character of the typist. Second is that information jumps around so much you worry you're missing out. And the webcams are so tight on the characters that it becomes really stuffy, creating a constant desire for the relief of wide shots and physical interaction. At the same time I did miss well lit, full screen close-ups.
The director failed to take a lot of short cuts - I really don't need to see everything typed, to have characters say What? to a clear question that then gets repeated, and a few other things. I guess that's down to real-time realism, but hey - it's a ghost story.
The story is OK, similar to Smiley, but the characters do become really irritating. The main girl and her boyfriend start out sympathetic, and there is an overall decay as the secrets come out, but I wasn't really interested, and of course we had to have macho guys shouting and gurning in full ""Game over, man!"" melt-down. Some of it was down to the limitation of the form - how are actors expected to react in a skype scenario? - but please get some better dialogue.
Music very limited, couldn't be woven into the storytelling - so that cuts out half the usual effect of a horror. The computer squeaks and beeps didn't add anything. A couple of weak jump scares generated purely through silence/NOISE.
The one sequence I did enjoy and which really suited the form and the story was the chatroulette, so that's something to think about.
Overall, it's worth a watch if only to confirm the computer screen is not the movie screen. So far",1474243200,,2093,4.644204851752021

Yes, Unfriended takes place in its entirety on a computer screen, and builds up a rather sophisticated plot concerning high school bullying, and how it can take rather massive scale once it becomes viral, leading to tragic outcomes such as a person choosing to take her own life to get away from it. Throw in some elements of classic ghost story with an angry spirit coming to haunt its tormentors in a form of a hacker in your facebook group with the power to control the cameras, messengers, video feeds and images with a sole purpose to destroy you. All this seems a little too weird to really work as a movie, but quite surprisingly, it actually does.

The computer screen we are watching belongs to Blaire (Shelley Henning) as she fires up a video chat with her boyfriend, Mitch (Moses Storm), and engages in a sexually playful scene, until suddenly more people are connected to the same chat. They all turn out to be friends, and the odd anonymous person who comes along is pointed out as a software glitch, until it begins to manifest itself through their friend's facebook page, Laura (Heather Sossaman), who committed suicide exactly one year earlier, and who is clearly having a grudge against the entire group for events that eventually led to her suicide.

At first the entire setting seems a little awkward, and I found myself expecting for the whole computer screen view to be some kind of extended introduction before the story would kick off for real. Although the view doesn't change, the story, however, rockets on at the speed of viral nonsense that changed my state of mind from mildly interested to fully immersed. The usage of different social media tools, web cams, video feeds and internet search, and the way they're all combined into an information stream that carries the story forward in a coherent way, left me feeling quite satisfied afterwords. The story works, the setting works and it all boils down to a functional horror story with a deeply technological twist. I wasn't biting my nails while tense on the edge of my chair, it's just not really that kind of movie, but I was left with a lot of interesting facts about the power of social media to chew on, and that alone means that the movie managed to touch me a little deeper than your average horror flick ever could.

For those who use the available platforms of social media in their lives, Unfriended is a dreadful reminder about the power of a click. But then there is the other side of a coin; while the movie captivated me quite effortlessly, I can't see people, who are strangers to the wonders of the internet, getting excited over it, or being able to enjoy the simple but strong plot concept that is blurred by the unorthodox setting. The target crowd, for who this movie is obviously tailored, will find it refreshing, different and generally enjoyable little horror story, but the rest may shy away from it by the weirdness of execution. It has made $64 million, which against the $1 million dollar budget, is quite astounding. Personally, for what it's worth, I loved it.",1464393600,,3326,4.691780821917808

What this is rather unique way of telling a story and certainly nothing like your normal viewing process.  We are watching a computer screen and are silent part of a supposed live viewing of a group of teen friends chatting, Facebooking and Skyping online.  They talk and act like teens so this might be annoying to some people. They are played by unknown actors, I don't think they do a bad job, it's just as I said their acting like normal teens.  Perhaps you would or wouldn't  have been friends with people like them in high school but they are plausible as real teens.  Anyway after a while they notice another using sitting in on their Skyping session and try and delete them or hang up on them.  They are unsuccessful and everything they try, they just can't get rid of this stalker.  But it gets a lot worse for them, as the univited guest tells them they will die if they hang up or try and leave their computers.  It takes on the identity of another teen who killed herself and seems to hold them responsible.

Unfriended might not be the best film that you have seen but it does try to restore a genre that has not seen much novelty in a while. The found footage genre had sort of lost steam and this tale of cyber bullying is a much needed shot in the arm for the genre. Unfriended is unique because the entire tale unfolds only on the computer screen.
It is about a video of Laura Barnes, who is dead now. Her old friends are chatting online and are thinking about their school, life and other things.  As these friends chat online, they are joined by a mysterious person who is not their friend but also cannot be logged out of their private chat. This person taunts and provokes them to a game that will have lethal consequences. Slowly we realize that each of these friends have a hidden past that is somehow related to Laura's death.
This is a fresh script and obviously not without creative liberties but the film succeeds in holding your attention despite the action of the film taking place entirely on the screen of the computer.

The movie isn't that bad, wasn't the greatest, most definitely wasn't scary, but it held my attention and surely isn't as bad as everyone is making it out to be.
It's a modern take on the found footage film, instead of people walking around with video cameras, we are now watching everything through Blairs' computer screen.
As everyone should know, Laura is back haunting her friends and is trying to get them to admit who's at fault and what terrible friends they are to not only her but to each other.
It's a little predictable, I will give the negative reviewers that but what horror movie isn't. I mean, if you've seen one you've seen them all unfortunately. Hollywood seems to have this system they refuse to break, and it's making horror movies less horror and more... Just bloody and ""scary"".

Not only did they insist on overwhelming us with trailer previews even before even getting to the navigation menu (the latest bane by virtually all studios now against our ability & desire to enjoy movies in the comforts of our own homes), but they even had the brazen audacity to stick their middle finger up in our face one last time for good measure to say to us, ""Screw you, Audience: We're going to remind you once again who we are *BEFORE* we even let you watch this movie that you paid good money for, even though you just clicked on the ""Play Movie"" icon in the main menu!

7118721,5,B00W3JQXUM,"Contrary to all expectations, I found myself introduced to characters that feel like ""real people"" doing ""normal things"" and reacting credibly to incredible circumstances--I liked them a lot.

After reviewing a video of her friend Laura's (Heather Sossaman; Desecrated, Fairy Tales) suicide online and the embarrassing party video (posted by her ""friends"") that led to her suicide, we meet Blaire (Shelley Hennig; Teen Wolf, Ouija), a cute normal teenager Skyping with her boyfriend Mitch (Moses Storm).  They playfully joke about blue balls and virginity and make plans for prom night when they are ambushed on a group Skype call by a couple of their friendsalong with a mystery caller who joined the group.  What's weird is that this mystery caller must have answered for Mitch and Blaire, who was in the middle of a strip tease when the call was answered.

The group (Matt, Val, Adam, Jess, Ken) considers the mystery caller to be a hacker.  But things get immediately more disturbing when Mitch and Blaire begin to receive harassing messages from Laura's Facebook account (or whoever the hacker is)--so Blaire ""unfriends"" her account.

This hacker begins to type messages via the others' accounts and uses their accounts (like Facebook) to post incriminating photos of each other, all the while insisting that it is, in fact, the deceased Laura.  Conceptually, this may not sound so cool or edgy, but all this is happening in ""real time""--so 90 minutes to us viewers is 90 minutes in the lives of the characters--and Laura threatens that if Blaire hangs up all her friends will die.

The only hokey thing about this movie are the deaths.  While I giggled with satisfaction at the blender scene, the scene is choppy as if from poor internet signal.  This may annoy some viewers but I liked the flavor and it allowed this low budget flick work for me.  Evidently Laura's vengeful spirit is possessing those who slandered who one by one, and makes them kill themselves.  She also gets them to turn on each other, playing vicious mind games with them.

It's all a little juvenile.  But then, that's simply the age group of the protagonists.  And I must say how nice it is to see horror victims behaving in ways that largely make sense.  They may not think of everything we would, but they are in tough situations which makes their absent-mindedness all too credibly human.  What's more is that they use cell phones, texting, Google searches, Facebook, Youtube, Skype and Gmailmaking this the opposite of the communicative vacuum that is the ""cabin in the woods"" scenario.

I was especially impressed at the nuance in Mitch and Blaire's message typing; the pauses, the deletions and rewrites, the delays while thinking about how to word something or whether or not to click send, even the scrambling between message boards and Facebook chats.  It all felt very believable, very normal--but panicked.  You really need to see it to understand, but this simple thing (i.e., the depiction of ""typing messages"" in a movie) has perhaps never been done better.  This doesn't feel anything like found footage horror, but something else altogether.  I almost want to call it social media horror or console horror--""techno-horror.""

This neither scary nor gory movie was somehow VERY engaging to me--and I'm an over-analytical guy in his mid-30s.  I've got to say, if you can get me interested in a film that takes place entirely on a girl's computer monitor about a bunch of teenagers on a group Skype call turned-highway-to-Hell, then you've succeeded as a filmmaker.

Realistic, especially on a computer, it doesn't give you the same clich story that comes with a lot of other movies. I thought the actors were very convincing. The suspense real, but it emanates a more creepy-feels vibe than typical horror. The fact that they kept the actual deaths in this movie real, incredibly graphic, and horrifying is something I have to be grateful for since most movies try deleting those for a lower rating.

7118739,3,B00W3JQXUM,"I really wanted to give Unfriended a bad rating because let's be honest, it deserves it.  It's truly a bad horror movie, and not exactly one of those ""so bad it's good"" type either (or rather, so bad it's funny).  But... perhaps because I myself spend a lot of time online chatting to people, I admit I got sort of caught up in the plotline (despite how silly this would come across to someone who doesn't care for delving into constant online chatting and wouldn't understand the way teens communicate nowadays- this movie would be totally lost on them).

The story's about a teenage girl who killed herself, and the group of teenagers responsible for humiliating the girl and causing her death all happen to be chatting together one night online (3 girls and 3 boys).  We actually SEE the teens talking to each other online... and this makes up the ENTIRE story.  You have to be *heavily* into current technology/online activity and the way people communicate through computers nowadays to really grasp this movie because it's currently relevant and is entirely based around fresh several youtube, facebook and chat room stuff.

Anyway, with all these teens together chatting in one place, this is a perfect opportunity for the girl to come back from the dead and kill the teens one by one!  For the longest time I was convinced some child or teen predator was actually the killer because the killings occur in a way that makes me think someone carefully orchestrated the perfect plan, however later I started thinking ""You know, it doesn't really make sense that a killer would be able to not only track but break into these teens rooms and kill them without any of them noticing somebody's roaming around in their homes"".  What makes these deaths so gruesome is the way their friends online actually see it happen.  There's a fair bit of suspense leading up to their deaths... well as much as possible (we see a loading or black screen, chopped video feed or spinning youtube circle, hehe) but this all feels like a failed attempt at branching out the horror formula into something it should never try to be.

The storyline has some noticeable flaws.  This is a horror movie for the relationship-obsessed teen out there, because for a lengthy period of time (particularly near the end) these teens are forced to confront their sins and sexual behavior/secrets to the other ones, or else somebody else gets killed.  There's even a timer that counts down until a death is about to happen, and it better not run out.  Hehe, even at this point I was *still* convinced this was all a well-orchestrated plot by some teen obsessed murderer and the thought it could be something demonic never even occurred to me.

Also we're supposed to follow along to the mysterious messages these teens receive on screen that result in lengthy conversations.  This means a lot of reading for the viewers... however the text is usually really small so reading is sort of difficult for a good chunk of the movie.  Too bad.  Bigger text would have made things more readable, which would have helped me become more attached to the story.

Yeah yeah, Unfriended is bad.  It's perhaps a nice fictional revenge movie showing teens finally get what's coming to them for causing a classmate to kill herself.  Then again how we do know for sure these teens teased the girl and caused her to commit suicide?  There wasn't really any proof that I could see.  There was however, proof that they were friends at one point, with lots of pictures shown of the girl hanging out with the teens before she died.  Otherwise Unfriended isn't really scary because focusing strictly on online conversations and their frightened and confused facial expressions doesn't really cut the mustard with me.  Still though, the acting is decent and the writing has its moments.  It's just not scary enough and the writers should have realized this before turning this kind of daring idea (online chat and horror) into a movie.",1452988800,2,3977,4.779239766081871

This just premiered tonight on HBO. I previously contemplated rented this on Amazon and I am glad that did not. Other movies similar to this plot wise and concept wise are Smiley or Chain Letter (for the internet/social media factor) and Forget Me Not (for the bullied kid seeking revenge plot). I don't understand where common sense went or where the parents went.

***Major Spoiler Alert***
So you notice an anonymous person hacked into your Skype/Video Chat call. Instead of realizing that you've been hacked, then going offline, checking for malware and doing a deep clean of your hard drive, and doing some homework.... these dumb brats continue to call each other on Skype, with the misc. person in the convo, answering emails from the person, answering private chats from person, etc and still staying on after you notice one of your friends begins to act strange and is hurt.

It seriously gave me a headache. I did not feel any sympathy for those kids. I can't even say it was because of how they treated and talked about the spirit when it was alive. It was solely for the reason that they entertained the foolishness in the first place. UGH!

The entire movie takes place basically on a computer screen. It's a group of kids all video chatting with each other. That's it. There are no cuts from this that bring you into a traditionally shot movie style. If that doesn't sound like your cup of tea, avoid this at all costs. It takes something special to pull off a movie like this and while this is far from a perfect movie, it kept me entertained. I looked at it as myself being in on the conversation with these kids, seeing what they were going through on my own computer, basically being helpless to do anything about it. It was a cool feeling. Obviously, with this being a horror flick, teenagers aren't always the brightest and make certain dumb decisions as well as showing their true colors when it comes to a life and death situation.

I don't think you necessarily have to be a millennial to ""get"" this premise, as I've heard people say to me. It's just something that is clearly not for everyone. I held off on this simply because of reviews and regretted it, because it has actually become a favorite of mine, and I would have still been happy paying more than what I did for this. It's just another example of something that I should've just checked out because of interest rather than letting other people influence my opinion too much. I'd still say give this a rental first, just because of the way the movie is shot and presented can turn some people off to it. Still, I personally enjoyed it very much and don't regret the purchase at all.",1451520000,3,1799,4.370149253731343

7118781,5,B00W3JQXUM,"It would be easy to dismiss this film as the umpteenth found-footage cash-in featuring pretty teens slaughtered one by one. But youd be a fool to dismiss one of the most groundbreaking films of recent years. That might seem odd to attach to a low-budget Blumhouse horror film, but the gimmicky use of having the narrative unfold solely on a computer screen is one so simple and effective that it basically invents a whole new subgenre of films.

Academically, the brilliance of Unfriended has been dismissed as copying the earlier movie Open Windows, but that would be dismissing some key distinctions between the two. While, yes, Open Windows does unfold in real time on a single computer screen as well, the action is largely refined to watching a series of cameras showing scenes from various spaces. Its basically a different way of presenting split-screen action, a trick thats been around since the 70s.

However, Unfriended is so much more, diving the audience into the entire online social-media experience. If POV shots strive to immerse the viewer into a certain characters perspective, then Unfriended is completely successful in recreating how everything would appear to someone using a computer. The scenes are not limited to simply the talking heads on Skype, but also includes scenes of texting, Facebook, Googling research, watching YouTube... The entire gamut of the online experience is wonderfully recreated as the beleaguered heroes work to combat a mysterious entity with every program at their disposal.

The chaotic navigation of popping windows and rapid-fire typing is something that could have easily been bungled, but the filmmakers have competently handled its execution. Though not without its slight flaws or missed opportunities, the viewer still sees everything they should, while also afforded a freedom to let their eyes wander over to other parts of the screen and watch ancillary action unfold in the background. But the hesitant quake of the mouse, the back and forth typing and erasing of text, the flicker of buffering video, an agonizingly slow download bar, an inconvenient popup there are so many smart but tiny gestures which all speak to an extra attention to detail to give additional zest to the film.

All the great horror films transform the mundane into something terrifying  a ringing phone, camping, swimming in the ocean. Unfriended adds terrifying subtext to basic computer actions, making a bad link or odd glitch something far more sinister. Film critics from the older generation have not embraced the message and format of the film, dismissing it as trivial and cheap, but that only serves to reinforce the revolutionary inventiveness of the film when weighted to its youthful audience.

And unlike Open Windows, this film is very good. Beyond the inventive formatting, the story itself is an exciting and suspenseful mystery with intelligent insight into online identities, friendship and cyber-bullying. There are numerous countdown sequences that all perfectly ratchet up the tension with every tick of the clock. The acting is all well above average too, as the actors are all tasked to play characters both lovable and loathsome at the same time.

Most other films are at their worst when a character has to sit down in front of a computer, becoming a boring but necessary slog through action and exposition in a visually stale shot. But Unfriended has the expert precision to make the entire experience fun, engaging and thrilling. It won't be long before entire films take place on a pad or a phone too, and they won't be half as good as this seminal, groundbreaking film.",1448582400,,3636,5.111111111111111

I wasn't happy with the fact that it was all played out online. I spend all day in front of a computer and didn't want to spend part of my evening that way, too, but I stuck with it to see if the plot was going to take the inevitable route. At first, the distortions in the film made me think something was wrong with the DVD, then I realized this was merely an effect to show that it was online.  This is a very tense and unsettling film, all the more so because the end is a foregone conclusion.

7118837,5,B00W3JQXUM,"Unfriended is a new kind of found footage movie, almost a live footage movie as the viewer feels they're watching events as they unfold online during a chat session between several friends communicating via webcam.  Early in the movie we learn that a year ago a student named Laura Barns took her own life after being persecuted about a disturbing video of her that was annonymously posted online.  The exact nature of the video isn't known for a good portion of the film, but the viewer gets clues.  Also not known is precisely how the various characters in the chat session fit into the events and the suicide.  Some, none, or all of them may be guilty to varying degrees in the situation; as you watch the movie you may find your opinions on varying characters changing more than once.  We also only learn about Laura in bits and pieces - it's said or indicated a couple of times that she was a bully and thoroughly unpleasant person, although the characters offering opinions on her may have their own reasons for lying about that.

During a routine web chat, the friends are joined online by an unwanted and uninvited new participant who can't be blocked or shut out, who wants to bring up the Laura Barns tragedy and isn't taking no for an answer.  This mystery participant warns that anyone who leaves or tries to log off will die - a claim that is initially scoffed at but later taken quite seriously when the other chatters realize the mystery participant may have the means and the intention of backing that threat up.  High quality performances, an original way of approaching the storytelling technique, some really flinch-inducing moments, and a constantly changing dynamic over what to make of the different characters all help to make Unfriended a winning - and highly disturbing - horror film.",1445990400,3,1809,4.738853503184713

7118909,2,B00W3JQXUM,"*SPOILERS--though nothing that hasn't already been revealed by the movie's trailer*

This movie is about a group of teens receiving eerie messages from the inactive Facebook and Skype accounts of a deceased bullied classmate.

With all of the headlines over the past several years concerning teens and cyberbullying, the backstory of this movie isn't too hard to believe. But when it really gets going, you will be left with nothing but questions and ""Huh??"" moments, rather than receiving the anti-bullying message that *I think* this movie attempts to convey.

First of all, if you were easily bored by the Paranormal Activity series and its home video style of filming, you will be even less stimulated by Unfriended,  which takes place solely in the form of a girl flipping between Facebook/instant messages and Skype conference calls. The movie has no clear audience. Though it is marketed toward teens, the well-deserved R rating for vulgar language, violence, and sexual situations rules out that group. Also, I feel that to REALLY appeal to teens, this movie would have employed the use of a newer, trendier, and more relevant form of social media, rather than depending on Facebook and Skype to carry the story line. Older adults (especially those with limited vision) will find the instant messages hard to read and the basis of the film quite petty, nor do I feel that it really speaks to twenty or thirtysomethings. The puzzle that the viewers are challenged to solve (Is it really a supernatural entity,  some unkown bitter classmate, or one of the main characters behind the eerie messages?)is ultimately for naught because there is literally soooo little character development that you really just don't care. Unfriend's only ""plot twist"" was apparent a few minutes into the film, so don't expect any surprises.

While I give props to this movie for at least making the effort to be insightful, Unfriended is ultimately a dull waste of time and money.",1443830400,3,1966,5.033846153846154
7118910,4,B00W3JQXUM,"Nine Things About the Movie ""Unfriended""

1. This is not a great movie, but is much better than I expected. It's an innovative take on the tired ""found footage"" gimmick so popular in horror films today, and is an impressive attempt at a new type of storytelling.

2. It was produced by Timur Bekmambetov, who is best known for directing the Russian fantasy/horror classics ""Night Watch"" and ""Day Watch"" a decade ago.

3. The entire movie takes place in real time, on one computer screen. All the acting is done through video chats and instant messaging. For people not used to seeing the ability of young people to casually and expertly multi-task using modern technology - or who find it annoying - the movie will be a big turn-off. But that very ability is the ironic hinge of the entire movie.

4. The story is about five friends talking online one evening, who are joined by a mysterious sixth person connected to the one-year anniversary of the suicide of one of their classmates.

5. The smart thing for the kids to do would be to turn off their computers about 10 minutes into the movie. But of course they won't do that. They can't. Computers and phones are their interface with the world, and they attempt to negotiate the intrusions of the stranger in terms of that reality.

6. In an impressive feat of authenticity, the movie uses real programs like YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Skype, Google, and even LiveLeak, instead of generic imitations that you usually find in movies.

7. The supernatural aspects of the film are stupid and boring. But I think this movie is just pretending to be a horror film. It's not actually about a spirit looking for revenge. It's about the horrific ramifications that can follow from careless and thoughtless actions.

8. The movie uses the horror genre as an entrance to explore other issues such as cyber-bullying, technology as an authentic extension of real life, the self-destructive nature of high school relationships, and the self-centered stupidity of the teenage years as a whole. In this context, the movie is actually kind of compelling.

9. If you want an actual horror film, watch something else. If you don't understand modern technology, watch something else. At it's heart, this is a Generation-Y teen movie that explores themes going all the way back to ""Rebel Without a Cause"". But what makes this movie different (and more relevant) than those other teen films is the exploration of how fleeting teenage mood swings are no longer quickly felt and forgotten; they are too easily turned into permanent public records that can literally come back to haunt you.",1443744000,,2622,4.847874720357942

7118923,3,B00W3JQXUM,"I would give it 2.5 stars, if I could.

First off, for everyone giving it one star because ""it takes place on a computer""... you did watch the previews, right? Or did you just blindly grab a movie, and then complain about it? I understand the preview has some full-screen shots that aren't full-screen in the actual film, but it was pretty apparent what the film was about.

That said, I thought the movie was ""only OK"".

Plusses:
- Everyone acted well enough. It was supposed to be about a group of jerky friends who were too into the current technology. I felt they were all jerks, and felt they were real-enough teens. Nobody here is winning an Oscar, but I bought them as people.
- The use of current technology was great. This is NOT a movie that will age well. But as it stands, they did an admirable job of using everything that's popular now to relatively good effect.
- The initial use of the ""I've never"" game was actually fairly chilling. Great concept.

Minuses:
- ALL of the characters were unlikable. Every one of them. It's hard to care that people are dying if you kind of want to kill them yourself.
- The ""I've never"" game wears out its welcome, but they kept coming back to it, like they ran out of ideas.
- The ""no bullying"" message, though a nice one, was SUPER heavy-handed here. I'd rather they started with a movie, and then subtly inserted the message, instead of taking a message and trying to wrap a movie around it.
- As many said, the kills were pedestrian, the text could be hard to read (and I watched it on a 55-inch TV), and the computer screen ""set"" got tiresome after a bit.

All told, it was an OK movie with a great concept that I wish was put to better use in a better movie. I think it was worth the rental, but definitely not worth seeing in a theater or buying.",1443398400,,1802,4.303834808259587

7118966,4,B00W3JQXUM,"You read a lot of reviews that say ""I could have made this"" due to 95% of the movie taking place in the form of a well-connected mac user's desktop. But here's the thing - these people did. It's a bizarre setup that could fail miserably and doesn't.

Admittedly, I'm a fan of the horror genre in all its forms - including (especially?) the low-budget, shot-on-less-than-ideal-equipment with less-than-ideal sets, actors, scripts, directors, premises, etc. The actors themselves are believable, if not relatable. Reading some of the production notes online about shooting all the dialog simultaneously in one long take is adventurous and does lend a lot of realism.

The one thing that will ultimately hurt the movie even three years from now is just how much it's a period piece (and I'm not referring to Laura Berns' video). It's one social network and OSX update away from looking like Matthew Broderick putting his landline phone on a 300 baud modem in War Games.

But the horror/supernatural genre needs writers and directors to try new things. I give the movie a lot of style points for basically constructing a one act, linear narrative and doing it all inside a series of messages and video calls. It's not perfect, horror rarely is. But points for originality and believability.",1442707200,,1286,4.944444444444445

7118986,3,B00W3JQXUM,"I don't like hand-held films at all, and these computer display film things are no better. However this one for some strange reason somehow actually manged to be entertaining. For a film that is 99.9% like watching your computer screen as someone uses Skype, Facebook and the internet, they actually pulled off a half decent movie!

A year before the time the movie starts, a girl committed suicide. Now one year later on the anniversary of her death, some of her friends are Skyping when suddenly the dead girls account begins messaging them. Could it be a sick hackers prank? A joke, or is the dead girl really communicating through cyber space? Things soon heat up amongst the friends as this mysterious user plays mind games with the group, playing with their emotions, and forcing them to make very life changing decisions.

Somehow this worked! To me anyway. I hate reality TV, hand held movies, found footage etc... but this one I think was actually well made and somehow works for it being what it is and showing the events that unfolded one night amongst a couple of high-school friends communicating online. It even surprised me the are actually using Google, Skype, Youtube and Facebook... no silly alternate likeness programs because of copyright issues.

All I can say is, if you aren't already turning your nose up at the plot, and the trailer didn't put you off, check it out. It's OK for one nights viewing entertainment. I have a feeling quite a lot of the negative reviews are from people who have not bothered to actually watch the movie and are just jumping to conclusions on what they think it is going to be like.",1442448000,,1635,4.70979020979021

7118995,2,B00W3JQXUM,"Interesting concept badly realized. Like most films in this genre, this film never rises above its own tedium. When it first started with the Universal logo blurring into a digital mess, I thought maybe. Instead, we get a 1h 22m long screen share session. This ends up a whole lot of NOPE.

Imagine yourself with your notebook sitting around texting and Skyping to your friends for about 1.5 hours. I'm sure your conversation might actually be more interesting than this film. So, now imagine that you're doing this with a bunch of stupid bullying friends. Now imagine that you and your friends went to a party and you got drunk and passed out. Now imagine that your friends took photos of you having pooped yourself and then placing photos onto Facebook and publishing a video on YouTube. Not only would these 'friends' be crass and uncaring, you'd have to wonder if these people are really the kind of friends you need. So, I'd imagine you'd not only go and unfriend each of these stupid uncaring teens, you'd change your number so they couldn't actually call you anymore. With friends like these, why would you need enemies?

Not only are these teens horrible people in that they filmed and watched as one of their friends committed suicide, they did nothing to help her except keep filming. Really? Worse, all videos are shot through the lens of a Chrome browser watching YouTube videos on this fullscreen screen share session. Amazingly, though, while all of the Skype calls have tons of annoying glitchy dropouts, not once does this screen share do anything different on the big screen. The screen share itself is pristine with no dropouts or glitching. At least some horror films attempt to break the fourth wall by bringing the horror directly to the movie viewer by breaking through the screenshare. Nope. I was also hoping that the film would break the screen share at some point and show something other than the screen share. Nope.

Once the premise of this film begins to unfold, it's clearly predictable and not scary. Watching people self-mutilate through the lens of a bad quality webcam just doesn't really seem to have the impact that this film needs to be scary. On the acting front, the chosen actors are horrible. In fact, in a hilariously ironic twist, the filmmakers kill off the characters in order of acting badness. Leaving the final act of the ghost to the actor who could at least act without being cringeworthy.

Overall, this is a romp that's best left to days when there is nothing else to watch, your local RedBox has all of the good films rented, and you also don't feel like running to another. I also warn that you will need a large enough screen where you can actually read the text. In other words, watching this on a phone or a small screen tablet is out. You'll want to watch this on at least a 55inch TV, preferably 4k. Also, if you really want to see this film, see it now (as in the year 2015). This film is already outdated due to heavily relying on the Mac UI. It will become severely outdated (and laughable) in 1-2 years or as soon as Apple changes their UI interface (whichever comes first). Now imagine me giving this 2 stars because it's Wednesday.

I was watching on a 50 inch TV and I still had trouble reading. The entire movie has no scenery except about six friends on the screen using a Skype  type group forum. There is a seventh person who serves as an antagonist. They all are typing with the words coming up under each person's video feed and it is very small to try to read and see who is typing what.

Not many.  And that it really was never fully fleshed out.  Don't expect that everything will be neatly tied up - but not necessarily a bad thing, it is a movie after all.  It does make you wonder with friends like these, who needs enemies - not impressive character traits for sure!  Be sure that you can either read everything on your tv screen or watch on a computer - you need to be able to read the text.

7119035,5,B00W3JQXUM,"I usually don't write too many reviews, but I felt I had to for this movie. I am a HUGE horror buff and I enjoyed this movie for many reasons.

First, it's pretty original. In a world where almost every movie is a rehash of one that came out 30 years ago, this movie was fresh and dealt with sites that we use on a day to day basis (youtube, facebook, skype, etc.). I found myself jumping when I would hear my phone beep or my facebook.

Secondly, I felt there were many tense moments where you're waiting to see if something will happen. There are alot of tense moments, especially when someone's skype cam is buffering.

Lastly, in my opinion, this movie is a breath of fresh air in a polluted genre. Considering the whole movie takes place in front of a computer, you won't mind it. It really is very intense from the beginning to end.

I'm going to take another reviewers advice and watch it next time on my laptop to get the full effect.  I definitely recommend this movie!",1441756800,,978,4.3224043715847

My biggest gripes are how short it is, and the lack of features on either format. Considering how bad the bullying epidemic has gotten and cyber bullying- which is this films primary focus) from a psychological perspective, it is rather creepy. The social network is the victim's weapon to pursue their revenge, and the consequences are rather deadly... Certain viewers got this film and the frightening realism of how quick so-called friends will turn against each other when their faults are revealed. Our modern culture's problems are shown with frightening intensity for those who watch it in the proper context. If you don't do that, you'll miss the point.",1441670400,,765,4.937984496124031

7119048,1,B00W3JQXUM,am I glad I did not waste my money seeing this in theater.  some one who grew up with the cheesy low budget sci-fi and horror  movies 1950s and 1960s  I didn't think they'd be a film I hate as much as this one.  Sure from the previews I knew it would deal with some on line group chatting but even Dairy of the Living Dead and probably Blaire Witch Project (though been long time since I seen that one)  would have some of the movie not looking through the camcorder eye piece.  This movie concept was far worst. Especially with the google and all the other annoying pop ups having through the movie. When I heard of this movie thought it was going to be something like the Horror movie STAY ALIVE except video chat killings rather than video game ones.  But no this was just so much a disappointment.  how dumb can you be not to stop going on those video chats if the result is ending up dead.,1441670400,,894,4.187134502923977

7119057,4,B00W3JQXUM,"Found footage movie told from the POV of a dumb liberal teen who cyber bullied a girl who killed herself. Reality check - the kids in this movie are no more horrible than kids have been through the history of man, they just use social media for everything so the situation is a bit different. Also, people used to have to earn respect and accomplish feats to achieve renown, whereas now they are raised believing they are special and entitled. I would have liked a different ending, like a twist. As IRL, only one of the kids knows anything about computers. As IRL, they're engaging in debauchery; who says passing out contraceptives doesn't condone premarital sex? Pretty realistic except for the dead girl. Beats the SNOT out of quite a few teen revenge movies that AREN'T found footage. I just want to see once in one of these movies a gym teacher put these kids in the ring and make them fight it out and start telling the truth and acting like decent freaking human beings.  These people end up becoming POTUS without ever getting their butts kicked and likely without ever being told ""no."" Major Payne would have fixed these punks right up and prevented the suicide, but liberals keep kicking ROTC off of campuses in favor for Black Panther affiliated groups and homofascist groups who are the worst cyber bullies on the planet.

Favorite parts: lib chick threatening to burn another kid on Skype alive while on the phone with 911 filing a complaint about cyber bullying and death threats against her person, almost every time a teen gets killed, and every time these pukes are terrorized into telling the truth.

It definitely seems like the POV is intentional in order to fight cyber bullying at the very least if not to shame ALL arrogant Apple users and anti-social media addicts.",1441584000,,1790,4.712460063897764

-Spoiler- The only part I liked was the ""Never Have I Ever"" game that is forced onto the characters which showed those nasty little teenage secrets that everyone had back in the day. Other than that, I was severely disappointed. The ending where the last main character, the ex-best friend, is left alive was a weak aspect as well.

No. I would contend that it is not really scary at all, and I am scared fairly easily. There is not a lot of suspense as you learn quickly what the villains MO is, so you can anticipate the next kill. Overall though, if you are a horror fan it is worth a watch.

Don't judge this movie if this kind of stuff will not bother or scare you at all. That's just not fair to the movie. Stalkers scare me. Ghost scare me.

The acting was above average for a film of this budget and I found myself actually scared a few times.

Although I don't think this film will see the same genre-shaping effects of the found footage craze that Blair Witch spurred, the film's primary device (viewing the events of the film in real-time, through the monitor of one of the characters) works well and feels fresh.

If you are worried that the cinematic device will get old, don't.  The truth is that it does, but you may find that it doesn't matter. Having it established early on give the viewer more permission to focus on the plot elements, and ignore the narrative devices used to communicate them.  This was a silly, ambition and fun movie.

It's a glimmering example of cinematic excellence, canonically resonant with films such as Gone With the Wind, American Psycho, Citizen Kane, and The Human Centipede. The film manages to defy expectation after expectation while fulfilling expectation after expectation. It's like nothing you've never seen before. Socially, the film chronicles a bunch of preteens whose bouts of childish grouse flood your neocortex and remind you how fortunate you are to live in the first world, where you are free to talk about boys and hair on the internet and unfriend creepy people at will...that is, until those creepy people end up confirming your worst suspicions of them and start murdering your friends. Brilliant! The only thing that would have made it more brilliant is if the creep was a member of ISIS! But that's just nitpicking. Clearly the filmmakers did not have time to create a fictitious social media profile of a Syrian extremist. I mean, where would they even start? ""My name is Achmesh and I like killing people."" .... it would give the whole thing away before they even unfriend him! All in all, this film is a cautionary tale wrapped in a perfectly entertaining spotlight of the kids who you wanted to trip in middle school! The drama is Aristotelian, the narrative is as razor sharp as Un Chien Andalou, and the horror factor is bound to leave you up at night questioning why you still live in America.

7119160,5,B00W3JQXUM,"Levan Gabriadze beat all his contemporaries to the punch, and did so with a sadistic flair that only a true director of the macabre could get away with.

Basically (and with the other reviewer I would absolutely recommend watching this on a computer) a circle of friends are revealed to be what they are behind their facades. For all the screaming and adolescent posturing, this is a genuine morality play with virtual/supernatural judge presiding every second.

A girl (and this is something that happens everyday) is cyberbullied and caught in a most unladylike pose on camera.  As a result, she kills herself (also on camera). None of this is particularly subtle until the ever sadistic  Gabriadze does exactly what the situation calls for: shows each at his or her moral core. The entity is not unsparing in it's vengeance, and all it is doing is using the terrain of virtual reality we use everyday.

This is also a chilling commentary on how cavalier we are with things like Facebook and technology, and how our secrets will dethrone us eventually.

The negative reviewers haven't seen to many horror movies if they hate this one so bad. It's mostly subtle and masterful.  What to avoid: all the sequels.",1440806400,2,1210,4.844660194174757

Not only dealing with that but with a sudden mystery person hacking in their deased friends account texting them with threats and games and soon they learn who is a true friend or not.

In this movie we find out just like the real world you do something try to hide it sooner or later you will pay for your actions.  i enjoyed the fact it used computer screens and small digtal cameras  to shoot the film as well as first person view very orginal. some  may not find this scary but it makes u think of what things you have done in life because we will all be judged the same as we treat others good or bad so in this movie it shows that & that's  what makes it scary. the truth bothers people  and we've all done bad things and try to hide them and bury them but at the end faith has it in for all of us . this movie shows us the ugly truth we don't want to face in this world.,1440547200,2,1347,3.9301470588235294

 I really thought they did it well. now lot of the reviews are saying that that it was too confusing. well I suppose if you're not used to sitting at a computer with about a half a dozen screens up at once, it could be confusing. but to anyone used to sitting at a computer, talking to people, and doing multiple other things it kind of made perfect sense.
 now I definitely wouldn't recommend this movie to the computer non literate. but I don't think that was its target audience to begin with.
 But if you are just a tiny bit afraid of finding ghosts in your machine... I think you'll like this. but make sure you watch it in the dark and on your computer monitor. you'll  feel like you're part of the chat and it gets much scarier that way. Lol",1440374400,,971,4.171122994652406

This movie is really just a group of friends on Skype chat, who also google some websites and look at their Facebook pages.  That's really it.  Oh and once in a while one of them dies because of some ghost or something.  Because that's what you want to see when you watch a horror movie isn't it?  A bunch of teenagers and their high school drama/secrets on Skype chat, right?  Oh and let's not forget when we get a few minutes of this girl screaming hysterically on Chat Roulette.

-Innovative storytelling technique
-Manages to create a certain atmosphere or ""feel""
-Pretty decent characterization
-Tense enough to be enjoyable as a scary movie
-A decent enough cautionary tale about cyberbullying
-At least a couple of clever moments

CONS
-Though the storytelling technique is innovative and interesting, it places a step between the audience and the story which lessens some of the scariness
-While most of the time it's decent, at points the acting is subpar. I chalk this up to the fact that, as I understand it, the final cut of the film was mostly filmed in one take with the actors actually on laptops. Having said that, and especially considering the one-take nature, there are also moments of very good acting.

FINAL VERDICT
I enjoyed this movie and I would recommend it. I probably won't buy it, but then again I'm not a massive horror fan and only own one or two. If you like scary movies and want to check out something that--at least for the moment--is a somewhat fresh take on ghost stories, I would recommend checking this out.",1439856000,,1068,4.830601092896175

No matter what they say or do, they cant get the annoying brat to leave!  The lurker claims to be the ghost of dead friend Laura. Shes not leaving until she gets what she came for.

This movie is sort of like the book, Big Little Lies.  It has a slow start, but once you're ready to give up on it, thats when it gets interesting.  And it stays that way until the last frame.  I really loved how the film was made.  I don't think Ive seen a film done like this before.  Of course they have many, many movies that featured the Internet and computers.  But this is the 1st one Ive seen that has been done entirely on someones computer.  It feels so real, right down to the pixelation.  But that was a bit overdone.  It feels like a typical day at home on the computer. (I haven't actually used Skype yet, but hopefully I will.)  That may seem like a recipe for boredom, but its anything but.

As the movie progresses, it gets more intense.  Secrets are exposed.  Lies are told.  Theres a ton of backstabbing going on.  You wonder how close these friends actually are.  On top of being a horror movie, its also a look into the modern way of bullying.  Now you can hide behind anonymous fake usernames and the web.  How tragic. Its very sad to see, but also makes for an entertaining movie.

Despite the slow start and unlikable characters, I thought Unfriended was a fun, entertaining movie.  I give it a 8/10.

Unfriended was awful. Not one character in this movie was likeable. The plot was very poorly executed. There were several continuation errors. For instance, nobody was unfriended. There was a scene where the ""ghost"" of the protagonist decides to engage the group Skype group in a Saw-like game. She said, ""the person who loses 'never have I ever' dies."" That never even happened. The deaths in the movie were super cheesy. This was such a cliche movie... And a huge disappointment.

7119311,2,B00W3JQXUM,"I went into this movie thinking it was going to be a documentary about my life.  Boy was I wrong!  It's about a bunch of rich kids who use Macs and are easily frightened by people who invade their Skype calls.  The wisdom of the movie comes from the Internet's most credible resource:  Forums on the paranormal.  These kids are so clever that they search with Google (despite their default search engine in Chrome being set to Yahoo -- nevermind, it's just Blair's computer; Blair doesn't know how to computer).

They also have virus scanners that immediately send flagged files to the Trash Can instead of Quarantine -- despite a ""Quarantined Items"" button being right there.

The mysterious pervasive entity also has a narcissistic attitude and a knack for leading our protagonists to commit horrific acts on themselves.  Before you say to yourself, ""Man, I'd like to take this guy to Buffalo Wild Wings for a few rounds and pick his brain!"" let me just say, he won't let you off the Skype call long enough.

Bullies drove Laura Barns to commit suicide, and now she (maybe ... it's not really clear) has come to make them confess and pay for their sins. The story is told through an online conversation and takes place almost completely on the internet. The setting (plus the casting of unknowns) must've made production cheap for MTV, but it also severely mutes the affects of the horror. Not to mention, the characters are shrill, self-centered, and mostly unlikeable. It doesn't make for fun, for scary, or for particularly interesting movie watching.

I thought it was a very creative riff on the sub-genre ""Blair Witch Project"" pioneered, coupled with a very of-the-moment social network sensibility that made the most of a very limiting approach. I saw it as I suspect it's ultimately meant to be seen--on my tablet, where it looks as though the events of the movie are unfolding in real time right on your small screen. This was very far from a perfect effort--some of the acting was a little overwrought and the storyline was not exactly minty fresh. But as an American take on what has traditionally been a Japanese horror staple--the intersection of technology and revenge--""Unfriended"" was effective and fun to watch. And coming in at just over 70 minutes, the gimmick does not grow overly tired before it wraps up. I am on record hating the ""Paranormal Activity"" series.

7119389,1,B00W3JQXUM,"What a massive disappointment. The premise has SO much potential and it was squandered on a half-baked, razor thin plot that is predictable and really, honestly, to put it bluntly, STUPID. First off, I don't mind suspending disbelief for a movie, but at least make me do it for a reason that involves plot and development. Instead, this movie leads me to believe that despite seeing a friend DIE over Skype, they all stay on the computer, arguing, looking up stories on Google, and IMing with each other. That continues through even more unbelievable scenarios, where 100 out of 100 people would be speed dialing 911 and/or running out of their houses for help. Period. They would get help. What they would NEVER do would be to sit in front of their computers arguing about who slept with who and why.
None of them seem to care about the first death in the film at all. Or subsequent deaths for that matter.
That lack of reaction in the film continues to the predictable end. I waited for a twist that never came. I could add a million other problematic things about the believability factor, but they would involve too many spoilers. I guess this movie does deserve the 1 star for the decent editing of the film and the fun and unique use of the computer screen in the movie. The acting is decent, if way, way, way over acted.

however, 2 issues kept me from giving it 5 stars: (1) this is a minor problem.  there a a couple of scenes in which the characters fight and bicker with each other, and they are so shrill, annoying and/or douchebaggy. perhaps that is what 'real teenagers' are like, and this is just a realistic portrayal. but i found myself going 'come on, you're so annoying right now. how can anyone stand these people?'
(2) the BIG problem: before i mention the BIG problem, some advice: stop watching 'unfriended' about 30 seconds before it ends. seriously. up to that point, the movie was original, scary, and seemed to avoid cheap gimmicks. however, the absurd 'jump-scare' that ends the movie is so played-out and hackneyed that it made me question the decision making of the director(s). if that were edited out (or everyone agreed to turn the movie off shortly before this), it would have been a much better movie.",1439337600,2,1374,4.793248945147679

I've farted things more frightening. The blender scene was the best they had to offer for ""horror,"" and that looked more like an epileptic making a smoothie than anything scary.

The story was barely held together and based around a girl who kills herself because of some great embarrassment that happened when she was drunk. They hint to several decent reasons why a hormonal girl would want to kill herself...potential rape from a family member, possible pregnancy, but the actual reason was so full of s*** it made me want to laugh at the stupidness of it, but all I could do was shake my head in disgust.

If you want to waste a bunch of time pretending you are looking at a video conference that appears to be modern, but has so many freezing and clapworthy camera shots you would think it was being filmed in 1997, with a villain that has the power to possess the living and make you just sit...for like 15 minutes...doing nothing.

Bad acting which was expected, miserable writing also to be expected, and zero direction which makes sense when you plop down ""actors"" in front of computers and film everything with the overused shaky cam effect. The found footage style is growing very tiresome in Hollywood and now a large portion of ""horror"" films are using it to cut costs and make super low budget movies. You can still make a successful low budget horror film without using this boring, cheap filming style. Just look at the success of Saw, but then even that had a creative director and a nice twist ending in a decent enough script.

Unfriended, is nowhere near as creative nor suspenseful, it lacks both as well as depth. There are so many missing pieces in this train wreck. The premise could've worked, unfortunately the film failed on so many levels. It was laughable, a movie that could be easily compared to the worst student film ever made and still only be marginally better. Don't waste your time or money. I was irritated because I felt ripped off after buying 2 tickets for the girl I'm seeing and myself. We both looked at each other and said wtf was that? There are better fan made movies on YouTube with scenes from other movies spliced together than Unfriended. Skip it!

The people giving this high ratings are really blind. I rarely knock the opinions of moviegoers because to each their own, we all like what we like but seriously, no one should give this ""movie"" 5 stars. I'll admit I watched this because theaters are very dry with the horror genre right now, it's all remakes and sequels these days. But there have been some GOOD horror movies among so much trashy ones. The Gallows sucked and honestly I'm not sure which was worse, this or that. But, the ones that did shine are Insidous 3 and It Follows. Watch those instead.",1439078400,,1838,4.634969325153374
7119409,4,B00W3JQXUM,"Having heard so much about it in advance, and having seen the trailers for it ad nauseum, I was pretty sure I was going to be really disappointed, when I decided to just jump in with both feet, and pay full price to see UNFRIENDED.  Not only was I pleasantly surprised, even though I didn't find it to be a 'jump-out-of-your-skin"" experience, but now I'm kind of baffled that it really worked as well as it did in theaters.

Here's why I say this: another reviewer recommended that this be watched on your own computer as an 'immersive experience,' and they could not have been more correct.  A new ghost-revenge dark fairy tale for the cyber-powered generation of the 21st Century, it's all about secrets, lies, betrayal, cyberbullying, and the ultimate consequences of what you post online, who you post it about, and how it eventually always comes back to haunt them...AND you.

Originally titled CYBERNATURAL (when it was conceived by Russian wunderkind Timur Bekmambetov, the director of WANTED), all of the action takes place on the laptop of one Blaire Lilly (SHELLEY HENIG.) You already are pretty familiar with the premise by now, more than likely, but a quick review: Blaire and her friends all knew a girl named Laura Barns, (HEATHER SOSSAMAN), who though not a very nice girl, was eventually cyberbullied into committing suicide, after an embarrassing video of her was posted on YouTube. On the anniversary of Laura's death, Blaire and her boyfriend, Mitch (MOSES STORM), plus close friends Jess (RENEE OLSTEAD), Adam (WILL PELTZ), Ken (JACOB WYSOCKI) and Val (COURTNEY HALVERSON), are all conversing online via Skype, when their chat-space is infiltrated by a mysterious intruder named ""Billie"". When Billie's online presence can't be deleted or otherwise removed, the group's consternation and frustration soon turns to stone-cold terror, as the true identity and nature of this alleged cyber-troll is gradually revealed.

As viewed on a computer, UNFRIENDED is damn near perfect to watch, and director Leo Gabriazde takes every opportunity to mine the scenario given him by writer Nelson Greaves, to realize the potential for amusement - and terror - that is inherent in the tools and apps and browsers that we unconsciously take for granted every day.  The sound and visual design are better served on a laptop, because it's almost as if you're watching your own, all too familiar with everything that Blaire uses to communicate with her friends, listen to music, browse the web...and stay in contact with ""Billie"", which becomes a very important part of the plot line.

Kind of a twist on SCREAM carried into the digital age, rather than rely on a serial killer with a love of horror films, UNFRIENDED decides to skew a little less superficial, and goes for the jugular, depending on all of the things that good friends know - and DON'T know - about each other instead, relying on human nature, and the tendency to turn on one another as the catalyst for the meat of the action that takes place.

The performances are spot-on, as far as the actors playing older teens who are firmly established members of the ""pictures-or-it-didn't happen"" generation. Nobody is exactly a stand-out from anyone else in the ensemble, since the computer is fittingly, the 'star' of this particular show.

Movies like the V/H/S series, THE DEN, MEGAN IS MISSING and more than a few others, have been ushering in a new sub-genre of ""cyber-horror"" films, and UNFRIENDED, though it may not be the absolute best so far, is definitely a strong effort.  But for the full effect, I would suggest always viewing it on a PC or laptop, rather than a big TV screen, to be able to take in all of the impressive details of a night in a chatroom, that leads eventually to oblivion.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Unfriended-Blu-ray-DVD-DIGITAL-HD-with-UltraViolet/dp/B00WF9XP9W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Unfriended (Blu-ray + DVD + DIGITAL HD with UltraViolet)</a>",1439078400,5,3993,5.138674884437596

7119412,2,B00W3JQXUM,"This is one of the single worst movies that I have seen in a long time. First of all, the way that the movie is shot is terrible. I understand what they were trying to do, but it just didn't really work. It didn't allow the horror that the movie was supposed to have to come across. The highlight of the movie is the scene where the fat kid is forced to put his hand into the blender and somehow ends up dying. I laughed hysterically. Even now, when I think about it, I laugh. It was that stupid. Also, none of the characters were really all that likable. There is certainly a difference between being likable and being good. I am perfectly okay with a movie where none of the characters are good, but a movie with no likable characters is just hard to watch. The plot of the movie was also lacking. Basically, it is supposed to be a horror movie, but it's so bad that it became a comedy.

7119424,2,B00W3JQXUM,"I admit I have sadly seen this film. While I do praise its originality as far as the found footage genre is concerned, the film itself is rather stale.
The premise of the film is that five friends gather together on a Skype chat on the one year anniversary of the suicide of Laura Barnes. She was driven to suicide after an embarrassing video of her at a party was uploaded to the internet and the constant harassment she received afterward. Granted she was not a nice person. During the course of the film a mysterious sixth person joins the chat, with the account owner allegedly being Laura Barnes. The sixth person begins to taunt and reveal things about the group that causes tension between all of them. When they bring in a seventh who they accuse of hacking the profile, the seventh member is seemingly driven to suicide by they mystery person.
When one member of the group (who really isn't any more a bad guy than he is a dick) tries to permanently get rid of the mystery person the mystery person apparently is able to cause him to kill himself.
The mystery person then begins a game of 'Never Have I Ever' with the rest of the group; revealing deceptions, lies, and all the while providing proof of these events. As the tensions build the other members begin to help the mystery person in this game of torture out of sheer spite. They die one by one, revealing a not so shocking secret in the end, and apparently Laura (a ghost or not dead?) murders the last person.

Few problems I had; while they Skype chat is creative, the film looks lagged as can be. The frame rate is horrible and it looks like a buffering dial-up internet video.
Second; it's not scary. You're provided with some small jump scares but there's nothing scary about this film. If anything it's sad seeing just how cruel kids can be to each other and be ok with it.
Third; the plot. We're lead to believe the entire film that Laura's ghost is causing all of this. I have zero idea how a ghost can; get on Skype, post things to Facebook, film two people having sex and upload it to YouTube, fax people stuff (seriously, two teenagers have fax machines?) and be the eyes of video feed. Makes zero sense. And this ghost doesn't seem to have any real motivation that makes sense. Yes she's pissed, but as we learn at the end she knows who really caused all of this. But instead of just offing her, she causes all this drama and murders five other people.

I was intrigued by the originality of this film, but it wasn't executed properly. A missed opportunity. I'd recommend seeing a different film. Maybe the Poltergeist remake.",1438905600,2,2606,4.484210526315789
7119425,4,B00W3JQXUM,"Was it the scariest movie ever? No, not at all. This came across as more of a thrilling/slasher flick with a ghostly element.

That being said, it was still pretty decent plot wise and I really liked how they pulled off a movie with just a screen shot. Much different than The Blair Witch vibe a lot of ""documentry"" style movies have. These styles always leave me unable to make a ""connection"" or empathize with the characters so I get a little bored.

7119455,5,B00W3JQXUM,"This movie is the first of its kind and will probably be the only one like it. Yes, the entire movie takes place on a teenager's laptop screen, which is why i recommend watching it on a laptop or computer screen. When you watch it on a TV or theater its so big and you're so far away you won't be able to notice all the things going on the screen at once and might have trouble seeing what's being typed. If you watch it on a computer, you aren't that far from the screen and your eyes will follow every little thing that happens, and makes the environment feel real. There aren't many jumpscares and that's not even what makes this movie scary. It's just the whole idea of it. On top of that, the actors shot the whole thing in little more than one take, and they're acting is flawless, to the point i thought they actually believed everything that was going on that this could have been a prank. This is probably the best acting i've seen in a movie, or at least a horror movie. For best results watch at about 11 pm on computer with headphones in the dark. The only thing you'll regret is not being able to sleep that night.",1438300800,5,1127,4.1981566820276495
7119456,3,B00W3JQXUM," It is inventive: this particular means of telling a story hasn't been used previously. Don't believe anyone who tries to tell you that it's a ""found footage"" film, as there is nothing ""found"" about it. The story is told through the eyes of high school student Blaire Lily as she fusses around on her Mac while IMing or talking to her ""friends"" on Skype.
 What do you get when backstabbing teens are forced to confront each other with truths? A total train wreck... and in this case, it's all caught in real time.
 The juxtaposition between events in the script and technology that we are familiar with (e.g., sounds of apps and OS X) is quite humorous throughout. The irony of the first several Chatroulette pair ups is dark comedy in itself.
 The actors (who are not newcomers to acting) are surprisingly convincing during their horrific Skype calls.
 There are some startling moments (or maybe I just drank too much coffee before watching it).
 Laura Barnes has a real facebook page.

On the other hand... (CONs)
 The characters participate in one too many horror tropes, including (but not limited to) Unfinished Business, Everything Trying to Kill You, Surprisingly Sudden Death, Psychological Torment Zone, Leave the Camera Running, Obscured Special Effects, and of course, It Won't Turn Off
 Blaire Lily is using a crApple
 Really, it seems the characters might have escaped their fates had they just smashed their computers
 If Unfriended is indicative of real high school students, we are doomed as a species...",1438300800,2,1520,4.94488188976378
7119457,4,B00W3JQXUM,"Unfriended tells the old tale of supernatural revenge but in a very original way.  filmed in real-time (as far as I can tell) and is all shown on the screen of the main character, Blaire's Mac,  it's like I was remote connected in throughout the whole movie.

Jumping from Skype to Facebook to Spotify to iMessage to Safari etc. constantly was quite frustrating to begin with but once I got used to this and the cyber bullying ghost story really kicked in, I started to become totally immersed with this setting and felt like I was actually there experiencing the ""game"" that Laura Barnes was playing online with her old ""friends"". The acting isn't the best but I think that actually adds to the realism as these are supposed to be just everyday teens at the end of the day. There's quite a few surprises and really chilling scenes (yet subtle in some cases).  There's a couple of glaring mistakes I noticed (such as the characters saying it was the anniversary of Laura's death today - the Skype record showed it as November - then on Facebook the Date of Friends Passing was April) but still didn't spoil the experience for me too much.

This movie definitely isn't going to be for everyone - it actually reminded me of how people reacted to The Blair Witch Project when they first saw it, either absolutely loving it or really hating it (I loved it) however isn't one I'd probably watch again anytime soon but one I would recommend to horror fans, particularly of the supernatural variety.

The first 30 minutes are engaging but this film was short of being called thrilling, memorable or even remotely frightening. I mean one couldn't help but look at the lack of common denominator knowledge or basic instinct. What I mean is when one of them gets harmed the others stick on thinking their fate will be different, that is not at all basic human instinct. It all seemed like a tragic comedy in the end but no one was laughing. My wife and I weren't amused. Despite the negative reviews, I was expecting more...

Then, a group of friends get together one day through a group chat on Skype and things get ugly when a mysterious caller interrupts their group chat and starts a deadly game for them. Unfriended is one of the most heavily criticized horror movies that has ever come out in recent years and as a result, this movie does get a lot of hate. But, I can guarantee that the majority of people who claim that the movie sucked haven't even seen this movie for themselves. Before I go over the movie, I want to say a few things. When I saw the trailer for this movie, I was looking forward to seeing it in theaters due to its interesting and original concept. I did go into this movie with average expectations. As a result, I was impressed with the movie overall. The only few flaws it does have is that it does suffer from a few cliches and some of the scares are a little weak. But, the movie isn't the big pile of garbage that a lot of people have labeled it as. So if you are looking for a unique experience, check out this movie!",1438214400,,1261,4.2803347280334725
7119460,5,B00W3JQXUM,"I thought this movie was excellent! A lot of people will claim this is another ""found footage"" film, but it's more than that. In the world of complete and utter ""social"" takeover, I found this movie to be very entertaining. Also, I was watching it on my MAC computer, further enveloping myself into the world in which to movie takes place. There were a couple times when an alert of a chime would ring and I kept checking my notifications because I thought they were for me. Really felt like I was more involved than simply just being a viewer.

The ""story"" involves five friends talking in real time over Skype and Facebook messenger. It begins with just a hint of the back story. A high school girl by the name of Laura Barns (Heather Sossaman) committed suicide after an embarrassing video surfaced online. Ironically, someone ALSO posted the video of her taking her own life. Blaire (Shelley Hennig) and Mitch (Moses Storm) are talking over Skype discussing their future plans for ""Prom Night"" when suddenly their other four friends, Adam (Will Peltz), Ken (Jacob Wysocki), Val (Courtney Halverson), and Jess (Renee Olstead) all appear in a group chat. Also present in the chat is another mysterious person with no avatar. After resetting the chat, they discover the person still remains in the group, so they decide it's simply a glitch in the system and go about their business. However, they quickly realize someone IS on the other end of the line when the person, using the handle ""billie227"", begins talking to them.

It's amazing to me (and honestly pretty accurate) at just how quickly ""friends"" (especially high school friends) can, and WILL turn on each other when faced with the consequences of their actions. I thought this movie was REALLY well done in the sense that the internet running the skype chat didn't have an ultra fast connection and ofter ""pinwheels"" and ""clips"". This might be annoying for a lot of people, but this is my reality using the internet and if felt even more realistic. That's totally my opinion, however. This movie is definitely not for everyone. There will be a lot of hate for this movie simply due to the fact you're watching a girl's computer screen the entire time, but I thought it was a brilliant take on a different style of story telling.

The ghost or by all terms closer to a demon than anything is brilliant in the aspects of playing mind games on her victims.

Originally, this movie was called Cybernatural, which I think is a better title. The entire film takes place on a screencast of the laptop of the main girl named Blaire. I can't believe this movie is getting such low ratings. I was in suspense the entire film. The death scenes were creepy and had a great twist in the end. This review WILL contain spoilers!

A girl named Laura Barns gets drunk at a party one evening, and someone makes a video of it. Shortly after, she commits suicide. One year later on the Anniversary of her death, Laura's friend, Blaire and her friends are video calling each other. During the video call, an unknown party is there watching them and taunting them because they all played a part in Laura's death . At first, they think someone is pranking them, but it all becomes too real when Blaire realizes that Laura herself is sending her messages as the comments turn deadly. Soon, the group must play a game of 'Never have I ever' and the loser dies. Dark hidden secrets are revealed as members of the group are slowly being killed in grotesque ways one by one.

As we see nothing happen to her shes normal then just stops out of nowhere if she was stabed she would react as nothing covered her mouth and if poison gas she would gasp for air.

A group of high school friends are Skyping when a guest enters the conversation: Laura Barns, a classmate who committed suicide a year ago.

What did I think?

The entire movie takes place in real time on one of the characters computer desktop screens, and it makes smart cinematic use of familiar images from that environment. Less smart is the story, whose characters become hard to like at all as they are forced to answer for their transgressions. Their constant screaming and crying feels like seeing the Leave Britney Alone video play in several open windows, but the film they're in is enough of a fun novelty to be worth checking out.",1430438400,5,659,4.71304347826087
7119475,3,B00W3JQXUM,"By no stretch of the imagination is UNFRIENDED a good movie.  But it is kind of fun and perhaps even a bit clever.

The cleverness is due to the makers of the film coming up with a REALLY inexpensive way to make a movie.  Remember when BLAIR WITCH and particularly the first PARANORMAL ACTIVITY used the device of found footage to a) make a scary movie & b) make it CHEAPLY?  The graininess of the found footage idea allows for some un-glossy filmmaking ON PURPOSE, and yet when done well, can be quite effective in building suspense.  Yes, eventually the concept was stretched to a near breaking point (although a film like CHRONICLE showed that a good story and script can still milk something good out of a clich&eacute;d approach).

Now comes UNFRIENDED, which literally is just 80+ minutes of watching a high school girls computer screen.  She starts by watching some YouTube videos of a classmate of hers committing suicide.  Then the humiliating video of that girl which was posted online and led to the suicide.  Then this girl begins texting with her boyfriend, and eventually, we see a video chat between numerous friends.

Soon thereafter, the group is joined by a mysterious intruder that they just cant get rid of.  Could this by the cyber ghost of the dead, bullied girl?  (What do you think!?)  And then we get to watch this mysterious figure manipulate and terrify the kids.  Exposing secrets, driving them to extreme behavior and other sordid events.

The film is NOT very scary.  Yes, there were some tense moments, but nothing earth-shattering.  Frankly, if the language hadnt gotten fairly rough towards the end, this could easily have been a PG-13 film and probably not suffered for it.  But I did find the use of the single computer screen to be interesting and moderately effective.  It was also, clearly, very cheap to make.  Virtually no sets to speak of.  No costume budget.  Minimal need for complex editing, and very few special effects.  And, of course, as with nearly any horror movie featuring teensno stars with big paycheck demands.

I enjoyed seeing the use of technology.  I don't video chat myself, so it was interesting to see these tech savvy kids just doing what theyve been trained to do virtually since birth.  They all maneuver through this cyber world with ease.  Whats less enjoyable is how unlikeable everyone in the film is.  The characters (I use the term fairly loosely) are mostly just collections of smart-remarks, snark and dismissiveness.  Also, as things begin to go poorly, its hard to buy that theyd continue just sitting by their screens (unless we accept that these folks are really quite shallow and nearly incapable of empathy).  So when bad things start happening, its hard to care.  (How shallow are the characters?  Well, if youve seen any of the FINAL DESTINATION moviesIll just say those characters are masterworks compared to what UNFRIENDED brings to the table.)

Its hard to say I recommend this film, but I wouldnt just categorically tell you to stay away.  Its basic concept is clever.  Not just the execution but the literal ghost in the machine idea.  It moves fast, and towards the end, when all hell breaks loose, there are moments of real tension.  In the old days, I would have said wait to rent it.  Nowwait to stream it, or pay-per-view it, or download it.  Just watch it with expectations properly set at a fairly low level.",1430265600,11,3402,4.780068728522337
