8236539,2,B00102F62E,"I searched the internet without any success trying to find the movies on this DVD set before I bought it. I gave up searching and bought it anyway. I thought for the $12 I paid for 17 movies I couldn't go wrong. The jury is still out (that's why only 2 stars). If you are a Ginger Rogers fan you'll be disappointed with the selection. Anyway, this is not a review - just a list of the movies in case you are thinking of purchasing.
