8490386,3,B0060KGSDM,"Peter Lorre goes full-tilt psychopath in a slickly made Columbia potboiler. ""Island of Doomed Men"" (1940) is standard tropical-prison fare elevated by Lorre's vital presence, Benjamin H. Cline's moody cinematography and Charles Barton's efficient direction. The Columbia ""B movie"" stock company includes Three Stooges regulars Kenneth MacDonald, Richard Fiske, Eddie Laughton and John Tyrrell, along with memorable villainy from Charles Middleton. Too bad the ending falls flat. Classic Lorre dialogue: ""Keep that monkey away from me!""",1497052800,,535,6.052631578947368

Unlike some I have bought, I actually watched this through till the end.

Look for Charles Middleton- Ming the Merciless and Don Bledsoe, two great character actors",1359763200,,277,4.872340425531915
8490391,3,B0060KGSDM,"Island of Doomed Men (Charles Barton, 1940)

Pretty amazing that you could get away with this sort of thing as late as 1940, though they did soften the racist blow by having the male lead be white (and, of course, devastatingly handsome); uneasy undercurrents watching it today, but it's still surprisingly compelling. Much of this, of course, is down to Barton, one of the best-loved directors no one's ever heard of; he helmed this while in the middle of his first much-beloved film series (the Five Little Peppers movies), then went on to be a late addition to one of early filmdom's biggest franchises, Abbott and Costello. Barton directed what may be their best-remembered movie, Africa Screams, before turning to television, where he was synonymous with some of the iconic shows from the fifties and sixties (including Hazel, Dennis the Menace, McHale's Navy, and Petticoat Junction) before ending his career topping them all with Family Affair. And where does this sordid little prison romance fit into all that? I'll let you figure it out, because I haven't.

Stephen Danel (Peter Lorre) is an humanitarian, of sorts. He likes to hire people who are just being paroled from prison. What he never tells the prison officials is that he takes them back to the island where he lives, chains them up, and makes them slaves in his mines. His wife Lorraine (Rebel Without a Cause's Rochelle Hudson) is also there on the island, just as trapped as any of the prisoners, but she sees a possible way out when her husband brings back wrongly-convicted Mark Sheldon (The Man They Could Not Hang's Robert Wilcox), a guy who's got that kind of jaw that says ""I'm not going to take any of this guff."" Sure enough, as soon as Sheldon finds out what's really going on on this little island paradise, he starts trying to organize slaves and overseers alike into a mob to overthrow their tormentor, all the while passing love notes back and forth to Mrs. Danel through a house servant.

It's shallow, it's unintentionally funny, it's ludicrous, and it's a great time. At only a little over an hour, it's not like you're putting a huge time investment into it, either. Lorre chews scenery with the best of them, Wilcox stands around and looks grim when he's not evangelizing, and Rochelle Hudson has a great look of trepidation. Which is good, since it's the only look she wears in about three-quarters of the scenes she's in. All well and good, and watchable to boot. If you want to do more thinking about it, mull over how the painfully obvious pro-union message would have been received ten or twelve years later. (I'm half-surprised Barton didn't get blackballed.) Otherwise, just sit back and turn your brain off. ***",1358294400,3,2710,4.7987152034261245
8490392,5,B0060KGSDM,"On the surface, this is a sordid B exploitation thriller about a U.S. government agent who goes undercover to investigate a shady entrepreneur named Stephen Danel who's working paroled convicts to death in his private diamond mine. Look a little closer, and it's a high camp classic, a Theater of the Ridiculous showcase for the sublime talents of Peter Lorre. Given a character who's a standard sadistic villain (see the leering green-faced image on the packaging), he transforms Mr. Danel into a fascinating, frequently funny but ultimately tragic case study in the sort of emotionally stunted, repressed authoritarian personality that the ebullient Peter loathed in real life (like Hitler, Fritz Lang and Jack Warner.) The scenes between Mr. Danel and his rebellious American wife (Rochelle Hudson), who's all too happy to throw in her lot with the undercover agent when he shows up on the island where she and the doomed men are being held captive by Mr. Danel, are so much better than anything else in the film that you can tell Peter and indulgent director Charles Barton took special care to get the pacing and emotional temperature of the Danels' marital quarrels just right, in one particularly effective instance choreographing one tense exchange to a Chopin nocturne.

This is IODM's first (legal) home video release, and it's a beautiful, crystal clear print, so you can more fully enjoy the varieties of ways with which Peter expresses Mr. Danel's inner thoughts and impulses via manipulation of cigarettes, the way his eyes flash when he says ""KEEP that MONkey away from me!"", that melodious Viennese voice and the quietly hilarious ""Mr. Danel"" theme, with its ominous strings punctuated by muted cornets going ""waa-waaaaah.""",1323302400,14,1739,5.144876325088339
