8086899,4,B000BI2EAK,"I missed this ABC Weekend Special when it first aired, WAY back in 1978, but around that same timeframe I was very pleasantly spending parts of my summers on a farm outside of Longview, WA, learning about rural ways. Watching 'The Escape of the One-Ton Pet' brought back memories of my cousins' proudly displayed red, blue and white ribbons for their livestock from various local fairs. I'm not sure if they were members of FFA or 4H, but the overall feel of this obscure television special struck me as authentic (if a little dry-looking compared to what I was used to in southwest Washington State).

The girl in the lead role, Stacy Swor, is equal parts sassy and appealing, playing off well against veteran character actor James T. Callahan ('Charles in Charge') as her rancher father. It's too bad that she didn't pursue a career in acting - too bad for the viewing public, anyway, but perhaps best for her.

The actual program running time is a concise 64 minutes and, on the cassette I viewed, it was followed by a number of previews for other titles from Family Home Entertainment.

Appropriate (and recommended!) for viewers of all ages.",1487116800,,1146,4.748743718592965
