3696192,3,B001MFNB4O,Title of film delivers what you would expect. Blood. And plenty of it.. Lion's Gate has quite a way w/these low budget horror flicks. Worth the bargain daytime ticket price.. And a hottie in it to boot..,1217548800,,203,4.513513513513513
3696204,5,B001MFNB4O,wow that is one mess up movie love it!!!!!,1506211200,,42,3.7777777777777777
3696205,4,B001MFNB4O,Were not Bradley Cooper or Brooke Shields fans and that was OK since they really have little to add to the movie since the Butcher is the real star of this one. The gore is over the top and sometimes humorous but it works. Seems like a collective effort by some to bring down the rating by adding all those 1-star reviews and then to even call it predictable. When someone is killing on a late night subway and the killer is alone with one other person theres a good chance someone will be killed and thats not what Id call predictable in this type of movie. The descent of Coopers character and the ending are what this one is all about so stay with it and the end of the line will be worth it in my opinion. The IMDb rating of 6.1 is much more accurate than whats reflected in the more recent reviews on this site.,1506124800,2,816,4.138364779874214

3696213,1,B001MFNB4O,"To be completely honest I was bored throughout most of this film. the action was at best mediocre, the story was dry and predictable and I have no idea why I watched it to the end. This is your run the the mill half baked slasher that tried to be artsy.

3696243,5,B001MFNB4O,Scary good. Great acting and with a nod to Lovecraft at the end so I won't add any spoilers. This is part thriller mystery and unadulterated horror with supernatural elements. A must see.,1501372800,2,187,4.696969696969697

3696245,1,B001MFNB4O,"What in god's name did I just watch. And why did I watch ALL of it??!?!? I guess I was holding out hope it'd redeem itself? It did not. This was bad. Baaaaaaaaad. Not even so-bad-it's-good. Not even a little. Sooooo BAD. Unlikeable characters, terrible CGI, awful filming, and a sorry excuse for a ""twist"" that is ridiculous and just plain DUMB. I'm sitting here feeling a little shellshocked, like I've just beheld something far worse than any of the absurd gore scenes. I need to go into witness protection.

The one star is for the scene where Bradley Cooper gets hit in the face with a human skull.",1501372800,,602,4.522935779816514
3696246,1,B001MFNB4O,"Just when you think humanity can't go any lower, then you come upon a film like this one. Whoever wrote, produced and directed this crap must have been raised in psycho wards. It has an adolescent plot - mediocre acting - and hyped up filming - all combining to make it the cesspool for wasted time for any viewer. Put this up against the light of real horror works and it won't even make a shadow. Midnight Meat Train is a ride to nowhere, so take a walk, instead.",1501286400,,465,4.235955056179775

3696249,2,B001MFNB4O,I'm giving this movie two stars because of  Bradley Cooper and Brooke Shields -- suspenseful and bloody--but with a completely absurd plot twist  which makes it seem as though the screenwriters just threw it in at the last moment.,1501113600,,230,4.871794871794871

3696251,4,B001MFNB4O,"Not a big fan of Bradley Cooper or of gore, but Meat Train was unexpectedly good.  I couldn't help but finish it once it started. Vinnie Jones is awesome as the Butcher and has the ability to frighten you with his eyes alone.  Being a Vinnie Jones fan I am biased of course.

3696265,4,B001MFNB4O,"Curiosity kills the cat.

This movie has affirmed my fear of late night public transport. very dark and twisted movie but it was good to watch. perfect for a rainy night",1500854400,2,169,4.451612903225806
3696266,5,B001MFNB4O,I'm biased because I read Robert Bloch - The Hell-Bound Train a long time ago & thought it would make a great out-line for a movie or Twilight Zone type TV show. I still think it would make a great satire. Meat Train is a serious gore-fest without humor. The only let down is a special effect at the end which I won't give away here. Top notch acting & story telling. I'd like someone to name a better horror film from the last ten years.,1500768000,,438,4.104651162790698

3696269,3,B001MFNB4O,"Not bad... it had it's moments, especially the first third? An interesting premise, to start. But when people start doing really dumb things, I start to not care who survives. The only person whose actions made sense all the way through was Vinnie Jones' character, the Butcher.  I have to say, I saw this when it first came out, 2007, but decided to watch it again because I couldn't remember how it ended, or the reason for the butchering. Not the worst movie out there, but it could have been better.",1500422400,,503,4.527472527472527

3696284,1,B001MFNB4O,"Just awful. One thing I can't stand in horror flicks is people doing stupid things, and this movie was filled with characters doing really stupid things. The protagonist had a gun. Did she use it? Once. That's it. Where was she when her husband was getting the crap beaten out of him? Who knows? Maybe she went off to clean her gun. If you're searching someone's hotel room for a camera, don't stop for a long, long time looking at the suits in the closet ... one by one. Hmmm.... there are some strange things in the bathroom cabinet! Since I'm really pressed for time because the murderer is coming back at any moment and I desperately need to find the camera that contains photos incriminating him, I think I'll investigate what the hell these strange objects are in the cabinet. I didn't even care who survived in the end. I couldn't watch it all the way through.

3696287,3,B001MFNB4O,This movie has a slow start to the plot. It's quite the bloody horror flick. I enjoyed it until the end of the plot was kind of thrown in there. Confusing ending but overall I enjoyed the gore.,1499299200,,193,4.105263157894737

3696290,2,B001MFNB4O,"Blood and gore with little discernible plot and very low quality writing. In spite of the effort to achieve intensity, the movie dragged in places. I kept thinking it would get better, but it never did. Quite disgusting scenes of carnage along with inexplicably stupid actions by the characters render this movie almost unwatchable. It felt as if the movie plot was merely a loose framework upon which to hang copious gruesome scenes. I'm sorry I watched it. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 is that I can't even get passionate enough about it to really hate it. Fortunately, in spite of the gratuitous violence and torture-porn nature of the film, it is readily forgettable. Which is what I plan to do right after I finish writing this review; forget it.",1495929600,,773,4.6911764705882355

3696305,2,B001MFNB4O,"If you're inclined to enjoy ridiculously fake-looking cgi-rendered gore effects, 'The Midnight Meat Train' (2008) might be the film for you.  Myriad plot implausibilities aside, it's little more than a series of slasher/creature-feature clichs (the killer's a butcher by trade- get it?) strung together with some pretty bad cinematography, dialogue and acting to boot.  After almost shutting it off fifteen minutes in (from which vantage point the 'twist' ending is already apparent), I decided to see it through accepting that it's not meant to be anything more than a modern-era exploitation horror flick, though not quite bad enough to be good.  1 1/2 stars.",1491955200,,661,5.336538461538462

3696324,5,B001MFNB4O,"This movie is gorgeous, thrilling, transporting and terrifying. Shot and lit with care, every frame is wonderful to look at. The director and screenwriter have taken Clive Barker's brilliant but *very* short story and expanded it - with Barker's enthusiastic endorsement - into a full bodied and very, very gory and intense film. I have watched it at least 4 times. The cast is great. Bradley Cooper was just about to break out as a movie star, and his work here is wonderful. Brooke Shields, Roger Bart, Leslie Bibb and - especially Vinnie Jones as Mahogany - are all committed and excellent in their roles.

The Midnight Meat Train is a perfect triumph of a horror film.",1483747200,,672,4.743589743589744

So I'll give it 3 stars :)",1483315200,,289,4.37037037037037
3696327,3,B001MFNB4O,"I remember quite vividly the experience of discovering Clive Barker's six-volume short story collection ""Books of Blood"" as a teenager, and devouring each one in turn, often reading long into the night. As with Stephen King, it has become commonly accepted that movie adaptations of his work generally range in quality from the mediocre to the downright awful (""Rawhead Rex,"" I'm looking at you) and that even includes ""Nightbreed,"" which Barker wrote and directed himself, albeit with lackluster studio support and the world's worst marketing campaign.

""Hellraiser"" is an exception, adapting Barker's ""The Telltale Heart,"" and so is this movie. ""The Midnight Meat Train"" follows the attempts of a photographer (Bradley Cooper) to ""capture the soul of the city."" In order to achieve this, he takes it the subways at night in search of the stranger, more bizarre characters who ride the trains. It isn't long before he finds one in the form of a mute butcher (Vinnie Jones) who Cooper's character quickly realizes is behind a  long-running spate of disappearances.

Cue a great deal of human butchery and blood-letting, chases and escapes, and even monsters. The film feels disjointed but is entertaining and keeps the viewer interested in how it is all going to turn out in the end. One downside is the poor CGI. When the movie was made, CGI blood was notoriously difficult to get right (and still is, without spending a lot of money -- which the producers didn't have) and so a number of the bloodletting scenes look fake, as does one particularly memorable eye-popping scene. But this doesn't detract from the entertainment value of the piece, and ""The Midnight Meat Train"" is worth seeking out by both the casual horror movie viewer and fans of Barker's work alike. I wouldn't pay full price for it, but if you can catch it in the bargain bin, it's worth picking up.",1483228800,,1870,4.93015873015873

3696387,3,B001MFNB4O,"I enjoyed the short story by Clive Barker, so imagine how excited I was to see that someone was making a film based on it.  I wasn't exactly disappointed, but this was paced a little differently than I had hoped, although how much can you really do with such limited material?

What I DID enjoy was that the storyline incorporated ALL of the elements of the story.  I thought the end might suffer because they might avoid going into supernatural territory, but they delivered for the most part.  It wasn't my ""perfect"" ending, but it was better than omitting or straying from the story's original content.

The visceral scenes on the train didn't disappoint although I agree with one other reviewer that the CGI was a little overdone in some spots, although I'm really not sure how else you could have achieved the shocking POV shots without it.

All in all, this is an underrated sleeper that did more justice to Clive Barker's material than some other films.  It went mostly unnoticed, and was gone from theaters in the blink of an eye, but it's a good one to pick up for late night viewing with all the lights turned off.

If you're expecting teen-slasher ""found footage"" crap then this film is definitely not for you.  If you want fast-paced blockbuster action, then skip this film.  If you want a dark story that gradually unfolds, with a few gory interludes thrown into the mix then you might like this one.  It's a little slow paced, it chokes in a few spots, and some things that were added to the script that were not included in the story go mostly unanswered.  It's still a dark train ride into oblivion, so I would definitely recommend it, especially if you're a fan of Clive Barker's work.",1461628800,,1702,4.580858085808581

Bradley Cooper did a reasaonably good job at this horror thing, and the imagery while it felt like gore for gore's sake, was somehow artistic and horrifyling beautiful.

The ending is not a twist at all, I saw it coming from 20 minutes into the movie.

The real problem with this movie is all the loose ends and things not explained.  Maybe I'm missing something.  Was Brooke Shields ""in on"" the hidden community by encouraging Leon to go into the underworld in the first place?  And what was with the lesions on the butcher's body that he kept cutting off?  Also there's a love scene involving the waitress and Leon in the cafe.  It had almost a rapey feel to it.  She does not look like she's enjoying it at all and it's got a weird vibe.  I thought for sure they discuss these things eventually, but thus they never were.  I honestly dont' know if I can write a true good or bad review about this.

3696671,3,B001MFNB4O,"I had high hopes for this movie with all the rave reviews and its interesting concept, but it doesn't take long for the story to morph into a implausibly absurb story with equally implausible and absurb actions taken by most if not all the characters. This would have been so...so much better if it wasn't so predictable and if they would have backed off a step or two from the preposterious storyline and not insult the intelligence of their adult audience. The movie is geared for the young adult crowd while trying to bridge the gap somewhat for the maturer audience and their more developed need for good writing, acting and direction instead of CGI effects to carry the movie. The movie delivers for the most part on two of those accounts, but fails with the writing and somewhat on the direction. Maybe they tried to hard to appeal to the younger crowd and went with the gore and special effects and didn't spend as much time on the writing? After all thats where most of the money is generated from. I won't get into any detais to spoil the movie before you've seen it. The acting is very good especially for the genre and the lead couple Leon (Bradley Cooper) and Maya (Leslie Bibb) are believable as a loving couple. Maya works as a waitress and Leon as a photographer struggling to get noticed. Maya sets up his big chance through a mutual friend named Jurgis (Roger Bart) who has connections with Susan Hoff (Brooke Shields) a gallery owner. Hoff cirtiques Leons work and advises him to shoot more raw and visceral images of the city. He gets several shots of a model being accosted on a subway staircase before he intervenes. Shields character is quite impressed with the life and death moments captured on film and offers Leon a showing if he can get two more shots of breathtaking photos. Long story shortened he captures a partial image of a possible killer when he shoots the photos of the model. Instead of pursuing the images needed for the show Leon sets out to tail and photograph the butcher (his occupation) /killer named Mahogany (Vinney Jones) who plays his role quite well. This is where the story derails for me and what follows only reinforces my beliefs of the implausibility of the story and absurb actions taken by the characters. If I go into a detailed description I will be giving away to much of the story. Is this movie worth the time to watch? Yes.  Is it predictable? Yes, from early on. Is it entertaining? Yes, just don't expect a thought provoking thriller and you will be fine. 3+ Stars

Rating 0 to 5 Stars
Story = 3  Concept is very good, but delivery is average.
Acting = 4+
Direction =3- Fails to control scenes and allows for way to much over the top story and action that ruins plausibility. To many loose ends that aren't addressed for me.
Creepy/Scary = 3 It has a supernatural element that most will pick up on fairly early in the movie and is totally reveled at the end if you haven't figured it out before.
Gore = 4+ Copious amounts of blood interesting array of weapons and tools of his trade. Plus a whole lot more that you will just have to see for yourselves.
Violence = 4+ Kill scenes are violent and graphic with copious amounts of blood.
Sex/Nudity = Yes/Yes With a couple of sex scenes between the two leads and four + nude scenes during and after kill scenes.
Foul Language = Yes it covers most of the spectrum, but is not used in every sentence or scene.
Entertainment Value = 3- This is an good movie with a great concept/premise and acting, but with average writing and direction it looses its ""WOW"" Factor and misses its mark. I am hoping for a rewrite with the same cast and as soon as I win the lottery I'll make it happen!

Ps. Gore hounds should enjoy this movie.",1376956800,,3732,4.491899852724595

Needless to say, we enjoyed it, had some great spook moments and just when you thought Clive Barker couldn't come up with additional way to do away with victims...well he ups the gore.

3696697,5,B001MFNB4O,"I first saw this film when it was released, and I appreciated its uniqueness at first glance!  Although terror strikes at midnight, the scenes are all vivid, and the detail is easy to view and decipher.  The story is no better than any horror story in my opinion, but the delivery is head and shoulders above anything I have seen in several years.",1372982400,,347,4.492063492063492
3696698,3,B001MFNB4O,"Clive Barker is a very skillful writer.  He's capable of some beautiful and evocative narratives.  He can create moods almost effortlessly.  His imagination is boundless.  HOWEVER, he puts these considerable talents to use in creating some of the most disturbing stories and novels ever.  His work is called ""horror"", which puts him into the same category as the likes of Stephen King.  But where King and his contemporaries try to terrify or scare, Barker wants to give you a case of, for lack of a better term, icky creeps.  Not just the ""regular"" creeps, but he wants you to feel tangibly dirty.  After reading one of his darkly effective tales, you're not to have a moment of shuddery catharsis.  You want to take a shower and do just about anything to get your mind off what you've just experienced.  Over the years, I've enjoyed much of his work, admired much and regretted reading much of it (and in most cases, I had all these feelings about the exact same work).  This guy knows no depths of depravity or grotesqueness to which he will not stoop.

MIDNIGHT MEAT TRAIN is based on one of Barker's stories.  It follows a fairly frequent track.  An innocent person, often a person of no great personal courage, is drawn into or compelled by a series of every more mysterious events and clues and suddenly finds himself/herself in the thick of something dangerous, bloody and deeply disturbing.  In the case of this story, a photographer named Leon (Bradley Cooper), while trying to photograph the gritty underbelly of nighttime life in a major city, stumbles onto what appears to be a rather serious serial killer who dispatches his victims on subway trains.  The method of death and what happens afterwards I will not share...but let's just say it's brutal and hard to watch.

Leon becomes obsessed with this mystery, and the impact on his own psyche is actual integral to the story.  Leon does some pretty stupid things, but unlike most lousy horror/slasher movies, we understand what he's doing because we sense the dark compulsion that drives him.  He's even somewhat complicit, one might argue.  His girlfriend (Leslie Bibb) becomes more and more concerned with Leon's behavior and becomes drawn into events as well.

That's all I'll share about the plot.  The ""bad guy"" in this film is impressively (and silently) played by British character actor Vinnie Jones, most known for playing gangsters and thugs.  His demeanor in this film is memorable and effective.  If you're looking for a movie that isn't quite horror yet doesn't stoop to the completely mindless torture of movies like SAW or HOSTEL...you will appreciate MIDNIGHT MEAT TRAIN.  But don't misunderstand this...this is not a movie that's fun to watch.  Many of Barker's stories have made poor movies because his imagination is so unhinged that when not corralled by a master director, the plots come across as utterly silly on screen.  This film avoids most of those traps, but as the secrets of the story are slowly revealed, an element of laugh ability DOES slip in.  And the dialogue of the film is barely serviceable.  Director Ryuhei Kitamura does well at creating atmosphere and in translating that icky creepiness.  But he fails at creating believable humans.  Cooper is actually not terrible in this film, but he's just too lightweight to be believed in the more physical scenes.  He unravels well...but he doesn't fight as convincingly.  Bibb struggles because her character frequently does things of dubious logic.  Also on hand are Roger Bart (utterly miscast as a friend of the lead couple) and Brooke Shields (generic as an art dealer).

In the end, the film is only for fans of Clive Barker and those with a strong tolerance for the icky.  If you like your horror to stay within boundaries of good taste...stay away.  I give the film three stars, because it gets a lot of Barker right.  But I cannot actually recommend it, because 90% of the movie-going public will rightfully run out of the path of the MIDNIGHT MEAT TRAIN.",1367798400,,4012,4.8541973490427095

3696761,2,B001MFNB4O,"As a fan of Barker's short story of the same name, I was largely underwhelmed by this adaptation. This is surprising since it does more or less follow the short story's general plot trajectory, and of course adds in details to make it suitable as a feature length film.

  Despite good intentions, this film fails in some key areas that are crucial for the horror genre: atmosphere and gore. There is plenty of the latter; whole bucket loads in fact. However, the unsubtle and clumsy CGI gore effects practically neuter them, rendering them embarrassingly artificial and out-of-place. This is all the more disappointing when we consider that there are a number of clever ideas fused with some inventive cinematography (though, sometimes the camera work was a little too over the top for my tastes and reminded me of Saw's annoying MTV-style editing and flashiness). The current trend of computerized gore is really detrimental for horror since it never quite meshes well with the surrounding environments and thus it fails to convince me that the actors are truly interacting with the onscreen violence. Of course this nullifies the intended effect and my suspension of disbelief.

  All of the above works to undermine whatever atmosphere the film otherwise would have had. The cinematography is unsubtle and never truly creepy, and the bleached lighting oftentimes looks too clean and crisp to evoke any real sensation of dread. In truth, the art direction was rather boring, and I never got the surreal and fantastical feel that Barker infuses in his stories.

  The cast was fine, though I felt that the protagonist's girlfriend did little to connect me with the characters. It was surprising, however, to see Brooke Shields as the art gallery owner, and I felt she did a fine job (though, as an artist myself, I felt that her lines were too stereotypical of Hollywood's depiction of artists and so they felt contrived). The script as a whole is rather clumsy, and it isn't helped at all by the direction, but it is obvious that the actors and actresses here all have a degree of talent. Vinnie Jones has the most fun role here as Mahogany, though I often could not help but think; ""hey, it's that guy from Snatch!"" Really it would have benefited the whole production to find another intimidating and more obscure actor for the part, since his character is supposed to be both mysterious and 'alien,' though Jones did a fine job despite some excessive and even comical scowling. By contrast, Javier Bardem's role in No Country for Old Men was much more frightening, and that film had all the effective gore and atmosphere that this film lacked, and it wasn't even a horror film.

  As negative as this review is the film does deserve props for mostly preserving Barker's general plot-line. I found the last thirty minutes or so to be the film's most enjoyable moments even if they don't quite capture the sense of awe I got from reading the short story years ago. SPOILERS BEGIN!!! (I found the lizard people a poor substitute for the bloated creature that Barker describes in the original, but they were fun in any case) SPOILERS END.

  Overall, while this is not the worst Barker adaptation I have ever seen it still fails in too many aspects to be an effective horror film. Hellraiser is still the ultimate Barker film. As flawed as it is, its atmosphere and special effects are far more evocative, and it was made nearly 30 years ago.",1306800000,,3443,4.802030456852792

I found the pacing during the first half of this film a bit leaden. If you're the tolerant sort, though, and you like Barker, stick around for the ending.

3696775,4,B001MFNB4O,"Clive Barker must be a vegetarian.

How else to explain the fact that villain Mahogany (Vinnie Jones) in Midnight Meat Train is a butcher of livestock by day, butcher of men by night?

If Midnight Meat Train was merely about killing people, it would be another long entry in lame murder movies like Terror Train.  But it's actually about voyeurism - how we the audience can't tear our eyes away from gore - and director Ryhei Kitamura pounds that point home with a mallet.

Leon (Bradley Cooper) is a budding photographer trying to capture the spirit of the city.  But art patron Susan Hoff (Brooke Shields, all severe curves) pushes for more - more visceral, more dangerous, more real. She doesn't want the anticipation of the moment, she wants to SEE the moment - in the same way modern horror movies now shower us with gore that was hinted at in older films.  Hoff wants less PG-13 and more hard R.

And she gets it when Leon discovers a terrible secret in Mahogany. Changing clothes from his butcher apron to a suit and tie, the blue-collar master of meat becomes a white-collar killing machine.  You can dress up a killer, Barker seems to say, but he's still a killer.  All the while Leon clicks away with his camera, drawn into a cesspool of death and sacrifice.

The gore is inventively shot, which results in the occasionally goofy kill (see Ted Raimi's eyeball fly at the camera!).  The movie is relentlessly dreary with its blue lens, which is a bit (pardon the pun) overkill. If Se7en has taught us anything it's that all beautiful things in blue-lensed movies must suffer, so its no surprise when that's precisely what happens to just about everyone involved.

But Midnight Meat Train is something different. I'm not fond of films based on Barker's work, including the bookend to his series of short stories, The Book of Blood.  Midnight Meat Train is actually a retelling of H.P. Lovecraft's Pickman's Model, and that it manages to end with a punch worthy of Lovecraft is high praise indeed. Horror fans will find Midnight Meat Train messy, bloody, and very, very meaty.",1288915200,3,2083,4.705234159779614

In fact, I found myself jiving along to the atmospheric ride for most of the way. The plot details a photographer's obsession with finding out the identity of a strange butcher who happens to spend his nights smacking in skulls on the titular train. Bradley Cooper (of Wedding Crashers and the Hangover fame) is pretty likable as Leon, even after he starts his transformation about halfway into the movie. Things take some strange turns, and he grows less likable. The movie delves into bleak territory pretty head-on, don't expect a happy ending. I don't really have a problem with this, coming from Clive Barker. What did stick out was the use of CG Gore to show people's eyeballs popping out, etc. These effects could have been handled practically (see DEAD ALIVE-the best gore film ever made) for greater impact. As it is, under the blue filter, these scenes seem out of video-game territory.

3696782,4,B001MFNB4O,"Like ""The Ruins"", another horror film I recently enjoyed on DVD, ""The Midnight Meat Train"" is a horror movie that- gads!- isn't afraid to actually be horrifying.  There's lots of visceral and disturbing material here.  But it all serves a pretty good story, one that- due to its source material being a short story by the great Clive Barker- also has an energetic little ""literary"" vibe going on under the surface.  So you get some metaphors and social commentary along with all the bloodletting by the crazed ex-butcher who hangs out in lonely subway cars.  Other plusses:  some naturalistic, easygoing acting by the central young couple in the early going, which gets our guard down, and a quirky supporting character or two.  A small minus: some cartoony CGI among the otherwise painfully realistic gore effects.

Do yourself a favor and dip into the bonus features after taking in the movie.  They include generous interview material with Clive Barker, who really is a fascinating guy.  I never knew he had a passion for painting in addition to his writing career and activities in film.",1260921600,2,1091,4.918032786885246
3696783,3,B001MFNB4O,"I started this movie only because it reminded me of a book, ""Acceleration"", that was about a boy who discovers the existence of a serial killer on the subway and has to wrestle with his own mind about what to do.  Sounds familiar right?  Well I figured ""The Midnight Meat Train"" couldn't be that bad since I liked the book's story.  In that department, for me at least, the movie was a hit and miss.

I'll start with the pros and that was the first half (NOT including the bloody beginning intro scene).  The main character, Leon, is a photographer and has prospects to sell his photos to a high to-do art lady.  She poo-poos on his latest work and says that Leon was just too late in trying to capture ""the heart of the city"" on film.  So he accepts her challenge and decides to work the city AT NIGHT BY HIMSELF.  Long story short he captures a mugging/rape moment before stepping in and thus gets wrapped up in the underground subway murders by tracking a butcher throughout the city.

What I liked about this first part was, ironically, the camera shots and scene setups.  The pace of the first half is actually really slow with Leon walking carefull through each scene like a photographer looking at the world.  To amplify this idea all the shots are stunning, as if the movie is 'capturing the heart of the city' through Leon's actions.  My favorite shot has got to be the subway's escalators that seem to pop up like some sci-fi alien before the audience can figure out what they are.  The music is so subtle that I could just solely focus on the scenery that was filled with eye candy such as shadows and long shots of buildings.  The best eye candy had to be when Leon gets back from the subway train and is just standing in the middle of the meat plant.  While the camera's focused on him a worker is in the background slowly counting hanging meat hooks that sound in time with the quiet sounds of the music.  Pure horror beauty (if such a thing exists).

Now unfortunately onto the cons, which is the story and second half of the movie.  By the second half the director apparently figured out the viewers needed a little more substance than just pretty shots.  Instead of a proper escalation of the psychology battle, we get extremely intense blood sequences.  Now even I was a little squeamish during some of these scenes.  I don't know too much about anatomy, but a human can't possible get bloody as quickly as this movie depicted.  Blood by the buckets was literally thrown across the train floor.  I have a hard time believing that the killer and his cohorts were able to clean all of it for every morning.

Speaking of cohorts, I had a big problem with the final plot.  I won't be a spoiler, but what seems as an intense psychological showdown between two people turns into this conspiracy thing...just didn't work with the great pacing of the first half.

All in all I guess I didn't mind the movie that much.  I think the amount of gore was unnecessary and even cheapened what the director had going for him in the beginning.  This movie isn't for everyone, but I at least found something interesting about it.",1260835200,2,3129,4.480565371024735

I had seen previews for it on a horror DVD I own, and it looked decent, so I decided to check it out. I had read no reviews before watching it, so I was pretty open to whatever the movie had to offer.

I have to say, this movie was one he11 of a fun time. Bradley Cooper plays a struggling photographer named Leon, living with his girlfriend played by Brooke Shields. Upon having his work criticized by a prestigious art snob (they explain her qualifications better in the movie, I just don't recall what they are), he decides to follow suspicious, dangerous people in the night with his camera in order to truly capture the ""heart of the city"". He becomes obsessed with a creepy butcher played by Vinnie Jones, who also happens to be a mass murderer.

First, let's discuss the pros. If you are a gore hound like me, you will not be disappointed by THE MIDNIGHT MEAT TRAIN. There's a lot of gruesome stuff here, and the camera never shies away from the killings. There are also a lot of really cool camera angles and POV shots that really add to the movie stylistically. The movie is shot in a way that makes the whole city look muted, dismal, and bleak, adding to the film's dark atmosphere. At times, the movie is truly beautiful to watch. Vinnie Jones is awesome as the killer, totally believable and frightening. Cooper and Shields are pretty good in their roles, and their characters are likable enough.

Now the cons. I'm a fairly pragmatic person, so it was hard for me to suspend my disbelief enough to swallow some ludicrous aspects of the plot. For instance, Leon becomes psychotically obsessed with the butcher awfully fast. And gosh, he's pretty good at hand-to-hand combat for a frigging photographer. And I like gratuitous, excessive violence, but the fight scene at the end is just dumb. For instance, Leon blocks a knife coming at his face using HIS OWN ARM as a shield. I mean really? Seriously? You're totally surrounded by dismembered body parts, and you couldn't use one of them?

Despite all my complaints, I really had a good time watching this. I'm on the fence about buying it, but if I were to see it at a store really cheap, I'd definitely get it. It's a bloody, messy thrill ride, and you'll like it if you can get past the stupidity of some parts.",1258761600,2,2372,4.5093023255813955
3696796,5,B001MFNB4O,"Clive Barker's BOOKS OF BLOOD vols. 1-3 were far ahead of their time (the ridiculous 80s). I didn't think that anyone could capture Barker's stories on film without making a pig's breakfast of it. Well, THE MIDNIGHT MEAT TRAIN proves that cinema has finally caught up! Bradley Cooper plays the role of obsessed photographer with the perfect amount of growing bewilderment. Vinnie Jones IS Mahogany, making him a terrifyingly lethal creature w/ no other purpose than to serve out his blood-soaked mission. Mahogany is one of the best ber-killers in recent memory. His only competition lately might be Beatrice Dalle's unstoppable berserker from the french masterpiece, INSIDE! The atmosphere of MEAT TRAIN is thick and caustic. A building, irreversible feeling of damnation hangs over everything like a bitter japanese ghost! Few movies give me that thrilling sense of dread and desolation.

3696797,4,B001MFNB4O,"I remember reading this Clive Barker story years ago, but somehow got it tangled up in my mind with another subway horror tale called ""The Light at the End"". What is it about Subways that make them such a great horror setting? I've rarely ridden on a subway, living in a rural part of America, I would actually have to drive a considerable distance to ride a subway, actually the drive to the station would make the train ride pointless. Still I'm fascinated by films set in and around subways. Maybe it's because they roll around underground through those long dark tunnels, but films and novels set in and around subways and the tunnels have also struck a chord with me. ""The Warriors"" cruising to Coney, the subway attack in ""An American Werewolf in London"", the original ""Taking of Pelham 1-2-3"", getting pinned in the subway car at the end of ""Mimic"", hell the only memorable scene in that flick ""The Church"" occured underground with the subway car splattering that dude like a bug on the windsheild. So yes for some reason subways in films have always struck a chord with me.

Well welcome to THE subway horror film. ""The Midnight Meat Train"" was simply fantastic. The basic plot is that a freelance crime photographer gets the chance to showcase some of his photographic artwork, if he can capture the ""heart"" of the city on film. The photography journeys out into the night looking to capture the city at it's most raw....and finds it with a mysterious and sinister butcher that he becomes obsessed with.

The gore and special effects are top notch, this is definately not a movie for the squeemish. The blood flows freely, but it's not gratuitous. Ryuhei Kitamura's direction is AMAZING. Some of the point-of-veiw shots from the victims' perspective are mind-blowing, the lighting is extremely eerie, almost as if the entire film were lit with the blue lighting found in butcher freezers or deli-counters. The film is very raw as well, you can almost smell the blood onscreen.

If you want something original, not a remake or ""re-imagining"", give this movie a try.",1256688000,2,2073,4.784916201117318
3696798,4,B001MFNB4O,"""The Midnight Meat Train"" is directed by Ryuchei Kitamuri. What struck me initially with this film was how beautifully produced, directed, and lighted it is. Each and every frame is exquisite, and I found myself watching with fascination as each sequence of events unfolded. Anyone who enjoys the paintings of Francis Bacon might find this film particularly enjoyable.

Initially we are introduced to Leon (Bradley Cooper) who is a photographer looking to enter the art world. He's looking for those special, one of a kind photos of riveting moments. This leads him to take more and more chances in the subways photographing often dangerous confrontations. By chance he photographs a man, Mahogany (Vinne Jones), who appeared around the time he saw a woman who was later murdered. He thinks there might be a connection, and begins to follow this strange man who waits in the the subway and then boards the trains at a specific time every night.

One night Leon goes too far and boards the train with Mahogany and discovers the dreadful secret of the murders. This story seems flawed though. Leon is spared, but why? We're told by the train driver that Mahogany is no longer able to do the job, though he seemed to be doing a commendable job right up until he met Leon. The transformation of Leon to murderer seems unbelievable, but it does add an interesting twist to the story nonetheless. There are other aspects of the story that seem to come out of nowhere for dramatic effect, such as the beasts that are fed these corpses. What are these creatures, and where do they come from, and how have they managed to stay hidden from the general public for so long? Why do they have to enlist a man in order to do the murders. Why is the train driver and other humans working for these creatures? Who is the train driver? The ending leaves more questions than answers, but the ride is nevertheless thrilling and fascinating to watch.",1256515200,,1929,4.721068249258161
3696799,2,B001MFNB4O,"The Midnight Meat Train was an Ondemand leftover that Sid decided to jump on like it was a desperate actress with bad hair, teeth and a bad pink negligee as part of our October Horrorgreatsuccess. We really knew nothing at all about the film, and from the title, we blindly assumed it was an older flick. But then we saw Brooke Shields and Sack Lodge so we knew this was new school B. Like, it was shown on a mere 100 screens in its theatrical release then quickly put out on DVD B. That's what we were dealing with.

What bothers Sid as much as just about anything is potential unfulfilled. This movie was full of it, not good times. This started out as an awesome movie. Great premise, a subway that you get on but you don't leave unless its as a piece of Mario or Luigi Scallopini. Really cool killer(the big guy from Gone in 60 seconds). And to top it all off a killer female lead. Well, not her acting, but Leslie Bibb is a smokeshow. This leads us to problem number 1: How did Cooper not make her his mother-in-law in the first scene? That's not B at all. Problem number 2 was a huge lag in the middle that made this one seem about 3 hours long. Not cool when Sid was primed for some pranking, video games, and Monday Night Football.

The Midnight Meat Train was a decent movie that could have been really great horror. Another strike against it, it was bad horror but not really B. There's a huge difference. It ad some cheesy effects but not enough to make it B. Maybe it was Cooper's character's stupidity/wussiness. Maybe it was Leslie Bibb not giving us a full show. Whatever it was, this one didn't have it. This one would have been kept on the whole time in the old days with no payout. If young Sid was reviewing this one, it'd be a safe bet for 1 star.",1255910400,,1767,4.240356083086054

It did do a good job of making you care about the romantic relationship, but you'll regret ever giving a damn because of the ending.  All is lost and you're pissed you even started watching.

The movie would've ended GREAT in it's third act instead of going into the outlandish fourth act, but I suppose that would've been ruining the source material.

I think this would have played better as a thriller with most subtle gore and not such a hopeless, deary ending.  I realize hopeless dreary endings are a horror film staple, but I guess as the movie progressed I was expecting more and something original.

3696803,5,B001MFNB4O,"I caught a glimps of the film from my purchase of the After Dark Horror Fest III set from Best Buys. The every single DVD in this set had the preview of the Midnight Meat Train on it. I could not wait to see this film. This DVD is the best film in horrow I have seen all year.

Long story cut short: Vinny Jones chops up victims on a train, according to his "" daily timed schedule "" every night. Very brave subway riders, you know those folks who couldn't afford to have a car or take a taxi, end up being dinner for some strange ancient creatures who were created before the creation of H. Sapiens according to the conductor at the end of the film wind up being butchered by Vinnie Jones.

Leon the photographer, the lead character in this film pursues the butcher after recalling and photographing him the previous night while saving an Asian model in the traing station from three unsavory characters. Leon states to his girlfriend that he photographed the model who was butchered in the train after seeing her picture in the newspaper. Leon develops an obsession, tracking the butcher which leads him to an obvious confrontation on the train. His girlfriend gets her heart ripped out by the conductor who has been "" serving "" these ancient creatures who have been using Homo Sapiens as a food source from the beginning of time on the "" Midnight Meat Train"". After Leon finally kills the butcher, he becomes the new servant in taking over Vinnie Jones' station in life as the new "" butcher "".

There was a funny seen where this lady and her husband are talking about how "" unsafe "" riding on the subway is and how you hear all these "" stories about the subway"". The butcher happens to begin his dinner preparations standing up from his seat on the same subway car with his huge meat tenderizor, while their friend tries his best to reassure them that riding on the subway is perfectly safe and that there is nothing to worry about. All these individuals get killed. Imagine just a few seconds ago the husband and wife stated to their friend that they wanted to get off immediately at the next station. A second too late. Just take a taxi the next time.

This film was very well made. I highly recommend this DVD for anyone who loves horror and ketchup. Excellent meat tenderizing techniques. Who know you could tenderize meat while the dinner item is still alive. The meat hook seens were great. Vinnie Jones is one neatly dress butcher, in his suit and well combed hair. Next time you guys eat steak for dinner, see if the USDA label is on it.

P.S. Watching this film is also a great way to review your A & P and myology. Enjoy.",1247875200,,2633,4.420618556701031
3696804,4,B001MFNB4O,"The Midnight Meat Train (Ryhei Kitamura, 2008)

I know a lot of Barker fans were dissatisfied with The Midnight Meat Train, Ryhei Kitamura's film adaptation of Barker's story of the same name, but I'm not one of them. Sure, it's not the story (few things could be), but some perfect casting touches combined with Kitamura's distinctive directorial style, showcased in earlier hits like Versus and Alive, make this one into a creepy winner.

Mahogany (Guy Ritchie regular Vinnie Jones) is a serial killer who prowls the New York City subway system looking for victims. Leon (The Hangover's Bradley Cooper) is a photographer who catches Mahogany on film in the act of taking one. Leon quickly becomes obsessed with catching Mahogany in the act of actually killing in order to turn him over to the cops (who say they can't do anything until he's actually caught in the act), to the point of straining his relationship with his girlfriend Maya (Popular's Leslie Bibb). The closer Leon gets, though, the more he suspects that there's a method to Mahogany's seeming madness. And the more he finds out, the more he wonders just how far over his head he's actually in.

Jeff Buhler (Insanitarium) delivers a script that almost fires on all cylinders; the characters are well-done and their reactions are believable. Meanwhile, the casting is top-notch; every actor here feels as if he were born to play his role. Kitamura sets everything in an atmosphere that's almost palpable, even when you watch this flick on the small screen. Factor in enough competency in the editing room to ensure a good pace, and you've got yourself a winner. Not a classic for the ages (I don't think), but a solid horror flick that's well worth watching. I wish I could've seen it on the big screen; I imagine it'd be even better that way. ****",1246233600,,1814,4.8076923076923075

3696809,5,B001MFNB4O,"It takes alot to survive in the city.  And ""The Midnight Meat Train"" Proves this.  There is so much in this movie that shows just how Screwed up of a brain that Clive Barker has, and the Incredibly Ingenious Mind that he has as well to come up with these kinds of stories.  When you start this movie it seems just like your Everyday movie.  That Idea disappears Extremely Quickly, once you see the First Killing.  Not many people have the Wherewithal to kill someone with a Huge Metal Hammer, and a Meathook.  This is one of those movies that just takes you on a journey, that is Very Deeply Rooted in the Darkness of Everyday experiences.  The deaths in this movie are Very Disturbing, and Unforgettable.  There is Gore Aplenty, but not only that but there are several Twists that will keep you going back for more.  After watching this movie you may have Second thoughts about getting on another Subway Train in the middle of the night.  Once you watch this movie you will understand why I say that.  It has made me look at Subways a little different for sure.  Not to say that I will never ride one Again, but I think I will be looking over my back for a little while when I am On One.  It is Very Seriously Disturbing in more ways than one.  Only Clive Barker can make a movie where you will think twice before you follow someone with a Camera.  When you see something Very Disturbing your mind always seems to remember it in ways that you will never forget.  The Main Character in this movie learns this in a Very Strange and disturbing way.  His Girlfriend wants him to take Pictures of her in very Seductive Poses, But there is only one problem there, He keeps seing some of the more disturbing things he has witnessed through the eye of his Camera.  There is nothing like that to kill the mood of trying to take seductive pictures of your girlfriend.  Some of the things the main character has to go through in the course of this movie would make alot of people want to Run in Fear and Hide Anywhere out of sight.  At least I would.  There is a little bit of a Cat and Mouse Game in here as well.  This IS Based on a Clive Barker story from his ""Books Of Blood"" Series of Short Stories.  The First Story in the First Volume of the Series from what I understand.  This movie has made me Curious Enough to want to look up the Book Series and read more of Clive's Work.  I have read a good bit of his stuff, and I know for a fact that some of his stuff is Very Screwed Up, and Dark.  This is a Perfect Example of his Deeply Dark work.  Hellraiser was just a small Taste of what he is Capable of.  In My Opinion this will join ""Hellraiser"" and ""Candyman"" for a place in some of his Best Works for the Screen.  There aren't very many movies where you have a Killer that doesn't speak a Single Word, But still finds a way of being Very Creepy, and Scary.  This movie is able to carry that off and Very Well.  As Surprise Endings go, This has a Very Well Done Surprise Ending that will have you Rewinding it to Rewatch JUST the Ending so you can actually WRAP your HEAD Around it.

It is a typical  Clive Barker story in that the people in it are seen as being just lumps of meat. Here both literally and visually so. He has made this point time and time again in his works. Intellectually it is a refrain that is not interesting, not well argued, and in this film not particularly well presented visually.

Unfortunately the overuse of tricky editing, and video gimmicks to try and create a ""disturbing"" feel of uneasiness instead only made the movie seem detached, artsy, unreal.

As the film went along the odd behaviour of the characters that I think we intended to try and generate some feeling of creepiness or terror instead made the movie seem too much like an avante garde film.

I think we would have liked this better if it was filmed with a realistic feel instead of an artsy symbolic surreal ""mood enhancing"" feel.

We simply didn't care about any of the characters or even the victims by the time we were 30-40 minutes into the film and took it out of the DVD player, not really caring to see how it ended.

My wife summarized this film best in my eyes, her comment....

""This is the kind of thing that could only happen in the minds of a Hollywood urban mindset.

It's not a great movie but it does deliver on gore and other monster movie standards.  This one can trace it's roots back to a short story by Clive Barker and even farther back to the classic works of H.P. Lovecraft.  The blu ray print looks great and it is grainy as are many movies shot with this aspect. Blu ray can really bring this out but it's not distracting at all.  I won't go into the plot other than to say their is a killer and a conspiracy that revolves around a subway train set up as a 'meat train'.  To say anymore would ruin any surprises that you might enjoy watching this movie.  Some of the gore effects are done by cgi and this should have been done by standard effects because a eye flying out of a head done by cgi (computer generated effects) doesn't look as real as using the old fashioned methods of making a fake head etc, unless of course they had the money to do it with a higher cgi budget.  Sometimes the old methods are still the best unless you have the big cgi bucks to make it look real.  However to enjoy this movie you should first off be a b movie horror  fan and second enjoy a over the top movie with gore scenes.

3696863,3,B001MFNB4O,"For fans of horror literature, the origins of Midnight Meat Train are well known.  Included in the ""Books of Blood"" collection, it has long been a favorite amongst Clive Barker's many fans.  Despite being a classic, not many (myself included) would have expected a film adaptation of this, the reason being the entire short story takes place in a subway train and well, how could you make a movie of this?  Well it is here and Ryuhei Kitamura, a cult director from Japan known for over-the-top films like ""Versus"", has done an admirable job of adapting Barker's story to film format.

In a large unnamed American city, midnight subway commuters are being slaughtered by a strange, mute, imposing figure with a cleaver.  He is somehow able to carry on his deeds without the police or anyone noticing as his victims' bodies are promptly disposed of and are usually reported as ""disappearances"" in the media.  That is until the killer catches the attention of a young photographer who likes to shoot strange, disturbing urban landscapes.  The photographer will soon realize that his intrusions could cost him a lot more than just his job.  Much, much more...

This film starts off very strange, with a definite aura of mystique to it.  Why is nobody noticing the killings?  Who is this enigmatic killer, and what are his motives?  It takes a while, but these things do eventually get unraveled.  Throughout the film, there are some very powerful suspense scenes, and not all in the train either.  As a matter of fact, most of the film takes place outside of the subway station, which is somewhat of a relief because otherwise it probably would have a stretched a thin concept a little too far.  The subway scenes themselves are expertly done, maximizing the sense of claustrophobia: where can you go, or possibly hide, inside a subway car?

As for the gore, it is extremely graphic and gratuitous, almost to the point of being comical, but those who have seen Kitamura's other films would expect no less from him.  Although my star rating might seem a little low, I do think ""Midnight Meat Train"" is a good horror film.  What it came down to for me is that it was a rather unpleasant viewing experience because of how dark, grimy, despairing and without hope it is.  I realize this is probably what the director was going for though.  A good renter, and certainly one of the better Barker film adaptations, which I would rank third right behind Hellraiser and Candyman.",1236384000,4,2466,4.75764705882353

Atmosphere? Check.

Creepy settings? Check.

Interesting story? Check.

Decent actors? Check. (Well, they're good for a low budget horror film.)

Good direction? Usually. The 'action movie' direction (and fight scenes) seem out of place with the horror story and the CGI is pretty cheesy.

Good screenplay? Not so much. Too bad Clive didn't write this script himself. The direction could have been better but was serviceable. It's the screenplay that fails here.

3696876,4,B001MFNB4O,"THE MIDNIGHTMEAT TRAIN

There were two reasons for me to get this movie when it came out, well there were many but the two big ones were that it is a Clive Barker film and Ted Raimi is in it [not for long]. I have always been a fan of Barker's from his writing to his films I enjoy the man's work, same can be said for Mr. Raimi who I think is one of the most underused and underrated actors of all time. Any way the time came for this movie to be released and I could not have been happier I mean with a name like that how could you not want to see it. The end product is some what disappointing but it is not as bad as some say, I think it is good at least for a rental.

For those who don't know this film isn't so much about the train and the murders being committed on it as it is about a man's obsession to look into it more a find ""the truth"". The film follows a photographer who one night when looking for something to shoot he comes across a young woman that is being robbed. After doing the responsible thing of taking pictures of the event he steps in to help, nice guy I guess. After helping her out he notices a big guy lurking around on the train, the girl is never seen again. He takes his pictures and story and tries to run with it, he may be onto something. He starts to follow the man thinking that he may have had something to do with it and it turns out one night when he gets on the train he was very right. Aside from a close encounter at the meat factory he is now witnessing first hand what this man is all about. So the film follows this pattern from this point on the man after the killer and vice versa.

Director Ryhei Kitamura who is very well known for his films like Azumi, Aragami, Versus, and Godzilla: Final Wars does a great job keeping the film moving and as usual his expertise with the camera and editing shows through out the entire film. This is actually both an advantage to the film as well as a flaw, I know it doesn't make sense as of yet. The deal is this film is very stylized and that makes the film look really good and clear with some nice effects like eyes popping out and such. But that also takes away from what could have been a really creepy film, don't get me wrong it has its moments but over all this is just a good looking Slasher flick [at least until the end, wow]. Still if you were not expecting this to be as creepy as the short story then this is an excellent film.

Vinnie Jones was cast perfectly as the killer on the train who smashes people's heads in once the train goes off track. He is tall strong and very creepy looking in that suit with that weird attitude he has got going on. Bradley Cooper did a good job as Leon the obsessive photographer who just can't leave it alone, he gets what he deserves.  Leslie Bibb and Brooke Shields each turn in good performances as did the great Ted Raimi for the very limited amount of time he was on screen. The dude who played the train driver was great as well and rivaled Vinnie as creepiest character.

Screen writer Jeff Buhler did a good job adapting the short story into a feature length film, he added a lot to it. Still it feels like something is missing maybe in the dialogue department or something but something is a miss. Still Mr. Barker gave his seal of approval as they discus with each other on the excellent commentary track for the film. But this is a good enough film that most will enjoy, watch for that ending though, some may not see it coming",1236297600,2,3477,4.105882352941176
3696877,2,B001MFNB4O,"The first half of this movie is fairly good.  It establishes the presence of a serial killer, it gives us decent characterization of the main cast, and the story is intriguing.  Something evil is happening on a certain subway train at 2:06 AM, and we want to know what it is.  Unfortunately the entire films falls apart during the second half.

During the second act, the film changes focus and become the stereotypical torture-porn Lion's Gate is notorious for with their other ""goreno"" films.  It's as if the film was split down the middle between Clive Barker's original short story and Jeff Buhler's screenplay.  To add insult to injury (no pun intended), every primary plot point that was hinted upon is thrown aside, every seeming truth to the narrative is sunk, and the four or five revelations as to what is going on are nothing but gaping, nonsensical plot holes that the film does not even attempt to answer.  It will just throw out a ridiculously bizarre situation, but it will take no means to explain or even placate us as to what the heck is happening.  What was that scarification committed upon on the main character?  What was killing people?  Where did It come from?  What is It?!

I haven't read the original material, so I have no idea if the plot is revealed in the short story or not.  But as for a film, it doesn't work for me because midway through it stops being a character driven thriller and it devolves into near mindless exposition, ""The Matrix"" inspired scenes, and CGI gore without any intent to deliver anything except this.  It wastes the otherwise good performances by the principal  cast, and it throws aside any redeeming qualities it could have offered.  I'm not sure what Buhler was trying to say in his film, but to me it didn't work.  Fans of ""Saw"", ""Hostel"" and ""C.H.U.D."" may like this film, but if you want more than hack and slash, try something else.",1235952000,3,1896,4.62874251497006

Based on a short story from Clive Barker, you really get a Barker feel from parts of the movie.  What could have been a straight up slasher films, has elements of supernatural and twisted things that are so typical from a Clive Barker story.

Vinny Jones is perfectly cast as the butcher (aka Mahogany) who maims, dismembers and disembowels the passengers unlucky enough to board his late night train. What separates The Midnight Meat Train from the usual run of the mill horror film is the sheer brutality and violence that is presented unflinchingly by Kitamura. The ending of the film is shocking (to say the least) and one of the best I have ever seen. I'm still baffled as to how Lionsgate could have mishandled this film so poorly as it got virtually no theatrical release and no promotion.

Blood, guts, gore and everything else you fit into a flick like this!

I just watched The Midnight Meat Train and I must say it's a great horror movie. It's certainly a fun ride that is gruesome, brutal, and hard to watch. It has beautiful visuals, and the gore is eye pleasing! The acting is great (Especially Jones, he freaked me out), and is a breath of fresh air. So I'll try something different with my review here:

1. Yes the title is pretty cheesy, but it didn't distract me from the movie at all. It does indeed sound like the name of a porno. But looking past the cheesy title, it actually relates to the events in the movie.

2. It does stay faithful to the short story, and is the best CB adaptation.

3. Vinnie Jones is the bomb in this. He IS Mahogany. He really just pours himself into the role here. No effort required- he even looks like the last guy you'd wanna run into.

4. This movie is VERY gory. I was actually squirming in a few scenes, but in other places the gore was obviously CGI, but that didn't detract from the movie. I'm a gore hound and I even cringed at a few bits.

5. Ted Raimi makes a short cameo in this.

6. This film takes a VERY unexpected twist at the end. I, for one, was completely gob-smacked and did NOT see it coming. It was a well-done twist that you'll be shocked by when you see it.

7. The only thing I disliked is that at 100 minutes it actually felt longer, perhaps more like 2 hours and 15 minutes. I thought the fight scene on the train was the ending, but nope, I was wrong.

8. It has an excellent one-liner: ""Please, step away from the meat.""

9. And did I mention I totally did NOT see that twist at the end?

Anyways this is an excellent movie, and one of the best horror/thriller movies Ive seen. It's gruesome, brutal stuff that's hard to watch. And you will totally be shocked and surprised, so if you want a GOOD horror movie, be sure to take a ride on the MMT!",1235692800,11,2076,4.217171717171717

It was supposed to open theatrically on Aug. 1 but was buried by the distributor, appearing not at mainstream cinemas but at second run theaters, which are known by many as ""dollar theaters."" Having seen the film, I don't know why this was done because ""Midnight"" easily appeals to all kinds of horror fans, including those who are gorehounds, slasher lovers, and of course followers of Clive Barker's strange mind. The film focuses on a photographer who is told by an art dealer that he needs to do more to get the best pictures. He takes her advice and starts staying out after dark. In the subway system, he meets a silent man who seems to be up to no good. The film plays with concepts of good and evil, corruption, ""seeing,"" and more. I was actually impressed by its depth, given its subject matter. I sought it out because 1) I'm a huge horror buff and 2) it's directed by Ryuhei Kitamura, and stylishly so. The gore level is about the same as you might find in ""Machine Girl,"" but it's more realistic, so I found it more unsettling. Great special effects. The ending is tres strange, so be prepared.

Which is an asian director behind Versus, if you like asian fantasy fighting films that one is a great watch. So how could the film possibly go wrong? Lets start with the characters. The main character Bradley Cooper is from movies like Wedding Crashers, He's Just Not That Into You, and Failure To Launch. While those films are not bad, he really should just stick to the romance comedies. He is pretty much a joke when it comes to being taken serious. I didn't hate him, but he lacked in his role. His girlfriend Maya was kind of the same. She is not a terrible actress, but you couldn't make the connection with her. However the main bad guy played by Vinnie Jones, did a wonderful job. He was mean and creepy just like he was supposed to be. Second of all the film itself was inadequate as far as being scary. While it's nice to have lots of blood and gore, it doesn't always mean better. Particularly when a guy is spiraling into madness you should feel for him and be terrified at the realism of the situation. Instead the film went into two different directions. It was sort of like a mix between a Friday The 13th and Session 9. They shorted us on both accounts. While a movie that presents itself in those two ways could and should be fantastic, it just wasn't. I am not a big fan of CGI, but they did pretty good job at not making it so cheesy. The film presented style, some originality, good gore, some tension and a great bad guy, but was missing character development, a whole plot, scares, and basically the direction was lacking in some areas.

 Leon a New York photographer that is barely getting by with his current job. He soon gets a chance to become something more with being made to take photographs of the city and the people in it. Critized by leaving the scene before anything ever happens, he decides to remain late at night to capture everything on his camera. In the subway he takes pictures of a woman almost getting raped and he stops the gang from hurting her. The next day he sees in the paper that the woman has dissappeared. Trying to show the police the photos and what happened he realizes they do not believe him. So Leon sets out to find the mysteries of the subway and why so many individuals have ended up missing without a trace. He soon discoveries how horrific and unknown life can truly become.

 With all of the bad and lacking parts of the movie. It still delivers a pretty descent outcome. I enjoyed all of the blood and gore for sure. The bad guy Mahogany is definately who makes the film good. It had some creepy atmosphere to it being in a subway and all. But honestly it should have been so much better.

I feel that that's what saved this movie in a lot of ways.
Also at times it felt like the midnight train movie could've turned out to be one of those badly made horror flicks. The acting was weak at certain points in the film but the action and suspense made up for it in the end.
The film overall isn't all that bad. If you're a Cliver Barker fan then this is for you. If you're not then this can still be an entertaining ride.

3696909,4,B001MFNB4O,"All aboard the MIDNIGHT MEAT TRAIN!  The title is awesome and awesomely bad, but this flick is destined to chug forcefully into cult status.

You've got the solemn, mysterious killer who wears a suit and clubs passengers in the cranium with a lethal meat tenderizer.  The murders are just phenomenal.  The director doesn't go for gritty realism, there's an abundance of ruby red CGI blood spewage that splatters the screen.  Very stylistic and remarkable.

The plot develops pretty well, with nice characterization mixed in with the great mystery and brutality.  The acting is stellar, plus the cinematography is astounding and creative.

But this does have quite a dynamic plot twist that seems pretty improbable.  I don't want to give anything away, but it is pretty extreme.  I often like stories that have a major transformation, like HIGH TENSION or FROM DUSK TIL DAWN.  But I thought this deviation nearly derailed the entire movie.

Still it didn't spoil this visual trip into gory oblivion.  The limited release at the theaters was so horribly shameful, don't miss this on video.",1235088000,,1087,5.03932584269663

There is no distracting shaky cam or impossible to follow action sequences here. The only questions are the good ones that make you think when you are alone in the dark.

1. I CANNOT STAND CG.  There is so much unnecessary CG in this movie.  It obviously had quite a large budget, but they still couldn't get a few extra gallons of fake blood and a couple of decent props for the more violent scenes?  And how hard is it to get an actual shot of the train going down the tunnel?

2. Picture quality of the blu-ray.  I've seen blu-ray versions of movies that came out 30 years ago with less grain than this one.

3696914,3,B001MFNB4O,"Based on Clive Barker's short story in the ""Books of Blood"" series in 1984, ""MIDNIGHT MEAT TRAIN"" is directed by Japanese director Ryuhei Kitamura in his Hollywood film debut. Those who are familiar with Kitamura's works know that the man is excellent in visuals and editing tricks--the man is renowned for the terrific Jidai Geki hit ""Azumi"", shot an excellent film in a measly seven days with ""Aragami"", gave us the genre-bending cult hit ""Versus"" and thrilled us with the Yakuza occult short film ""The Messenger"". The man knows his stuff and has an impressive resume in Asia. However, this time around, he adapts a sub-par Barker story to the big screen, which restrains the man's visionary style.

Leon (Bradley Cooper) is an aspiring ""art"" photographer who moonlights as a photo journalist. He walks around this urban city in the hopes of capturing something significant to a gallery owner (played by Brooke Shields). During his rounds, Leon chances upon a potential mugging of a beautiful Japanese model named Nora (Erika Sakaki) by street thugs and scares the thugs away. Nora boards the train and disappears. By chance, the following night, Leon spies upon a huge, intimidating man named Mahogany (Vinnie Jones) and he is intrigued. Leon is hooked and he witnesses Mahogany murder the remaining passengers on a late subway train. Terrified, yet oddly drawn to this killer, Leon finds himself in the middle of this mystery and drags his sexy girlfriend Maya (Leslie Bibb) along with him.

Ryuhei Kitamura is an excellent director. He knows his stuff, and knows how to edit and make his shots look very cool. The gore and blood in the film are nicely executed--freeze frames, gorged eyes popping out, limbs hacked off, hammered heads, splattering arterial spray, quick zooms and close ups with the usual darkly lit cinematography and gloomy cinematography. It is quite stylish, visceral and the shots look very pretty. Director Kitamura is utilizing the best from what is available to him, a butcher-killer who stalks late subway trains has a very limited concept, so Kitamura uses style to cover up its very limited plot. There is a lot of brutal violence in the film, admittedly it isn't anything we haven't seen before, so what can ace director Kitamura do? He does what he does best, he shoots and sticks to his style.

The film does have very obvious limits to its narrative. The screenplay by Jeff Buhler seems  stretched out, he depends on Leon's visions and flashbacks to try to go into the depths of his mind and imminent psychosis. The rest of the script is pretty routine, relying on melodrama and insipid metaphor, the two leads does have their moments of intimacy to generate sympathy (it would`ve helped if it had abundant scenes of sex and nudity). Kitamura's skill is stretched to the limit in trying to find a good foothold on the film`s premise. The monstrous images utilizes the use of prosthetics and assisted by CGI, there are some legitimate attempts at scares but the problem is, what is meant to be gory and disquieting, looks too pretty--how can a scene supposed to be alarmingly frightening become mere eye candy? All the CGI blood feels a little out of place.

Alright, I know what you are wondering about--does ""Midnight Meat Train"" have an iconic antagonist? Well, this killer is an impeccably dressed psychotic individual and he does what he does very meticulously. He carries a briefcase based on a veterinarian's bag that holds his ""butcher"" tools. Vinnie Jones is rightly cast in the role of the mad killer and he does give off a  creepy, intimidating presence. Unlike, Jason or Freddy, Mahogany seems rather normal and does have certain complexities to his character. He is hinted as dying, and he doesn't want to give up his work in serving his twisted masters. Apparently, Mahogany has a disturbing purpose--to separate the human world from something evil, a task he believes needs to be done.

Most of the blame would have to fall on the adaptation of its source material. Barker's short story does have a very limited concept. The filmmakers would have done well to have just adapted the idea and evolved a plotline more fitting for movie scares; I would have loved to see a film about Mahogany's masters and they should've stuck to the basics of an old-fashioned gory, exploitive, horrific experience. ""Midnight Meat Train"" is a typical Clive Barker film; full of plot holes, usual descent into madness and an ending on the ""fantasy train"". The film's plot sure feels more aimed at a literary style and not as a film experience; it proved too flimsy and stretched out. It's just that when you've seen one Barker flick--it feels like you've seen them all. The main issue is, this film didn't scare me or gave me suspense at all--the impression it left was just how cool the movie looked.

Recommended with caution, rent it first [3 Stars]",1234915200,,4882,4.873493975903615
3696915,3,B001MFNB4O,"Okay, let me admit up front that I'm a huge fan of Clive Barker's written work and his paintings.  I enjoyed his first two Hellraiser films and I loved Bernard Rose's brilliant adaption of Candyman, and I do have a soft spot for Nightbreed(Cabal is probably my favorite Barker story).  Midnight Meat Train is one of his better and most odd, funny, creepy, and truly original stories from his Books Of Blood vol. 1.  I've been hoping for an adaption of this story forever!  Well, here it is and I got my wish...

Well, not entirely.  Sure, changes were made from the original text,but all were sensible and smart based on the obviously visual nature of films.  Our hero, so to speak, is no longer an loner accountant, but a photographer on the hunt for the real city, the dark heart of the big city.  The film has also given Leon a girlfriend, a very close and beautiful relationship of support.  Basically, instead of starting with a completely dark man who goes further we get a man hungry for success and suppressing his darkness.  And of course if you know your horror then you know what part of his personality will take over his life and cause problems for all around him.  All good stuff and appropriate changes.

So what's my beef with this film?  Well, it's poorly directed over-the-top to the point that it's no longer scary but rather funny, silly, and totally void of supsnse.  All the train murders use heavy CGI effects to  perform trick shots that wouldn't be possible without them, and it totally takes you out of the film.  Instead of being shocking or gross it just comes off as a nifty demo real for a future visual effects artist.  Not good in horror.  Horror doesn't need good, great or any in-your-face special effects to work.  There's a fight at the end of the film where the camera zips out of the train car and around to the other side, in and out of the windows like a low rent Matrix clone.  Why is this in my horror film?  It might sound slight to you, but this really takes some of the terror out of scenes that depict something terrible in a 'KEWL' way.  I don't want to be awed by death, I want it to bother me and make me uncomfortable and, well...um, HORRIFIED!  The bottom line, is that Barker's tale is already an over-the-top, screwy and weird tale with a larger Lovecraftian mythology at its core and a more stark, down-to-earth and gritty style would have been more applicable for this film.

On the plus side the acting is all good and convincing.  You do care about the main two protagonists.  Sure, a more subtle director would have eased Leon's obssession with darkness on the audience instead of sledgehammering it to us like he was Mohageny himself(the villain of said midnight meat train).  Barker's forementioned Lovecraftian mythology is in tact, which less daring producers and screenwriters would have totally removed from this film adaption.  Plus, it's left thankfully ambiguous.  I can't stand that American metnality to over explain the supernatural.  This film leaves it in the dark and in the unknown where it belongs.  Vinnie Jones is perfect as Mohageny.  Can't think of anyone better to come off as imposing and who could do more with simple body language and stares.

Basically, the screenwriter did right by Barker, but failed by an overzealous visual director, and by Barker himself who was one of the film's producers.  This film may work more for some....",1234915200,,3418,4.641666666666667

Vinnie Jones does A great job building a vilian with just body movments and looks.  Bradly Cooper who plays Leon our hero also does a great job, he makes you care about his fate.  The midnight meat train moves along at a fast pace, it starts of with a bang and has A perfict ending.  My favorit part of this movie is how Leon changes as he tracks the butcher. I enjoyed the camara work as well which is rare for me, I usally don't notice that when I watch a film.  The midnight meat train just as good as hellrasier maybe even better.

3696948,4,B001MFNB4O,"No doubt if you're a fan of three things (Horror fiction, Clive Barker and Ryuhei Kitamura) you've heard the unfortunate bungling The Midnight Meat Train recieved concerning its theatrical release. I won't go into detail as that shouldn't pertain to a review of the finished product. I will say however that even after the considerable wait, the stupid release, and the Fear Net showing it as at least nice to have some kind of DVD with at least some special features worth mentioning.
In Junior High I was a huge fan of Clive Barker but none more so than with The Midnight Meat Train from the Books of Blood, one of his stories that has stayed with me over the years. I haven't read the story in over twenty years so I can't compare the two works but I will say the movie is good in presenting a fairly cool concept story of two men destined to fight to the death. If you haven't read the story the plot concerns Leon Kaufmann, a photographer who one night looking to get photos of nocturnal city life rescues a girl from a group of thugs as She's getting on a train. The girl of course gets on the train with Mahogany, a killer who is butchering people on certain trains for undisclosed purposes. Leon seeing that the girl has gone missing becomes interested in finding out what happened coming upon Mahogany who in turn starts stalking him. If you read my previous statement concerning the duel to the death then you know how the movie must end.
I will admit that the movie isn't the perfect horror film, but then what is. For the first hour or so you have an atmospheric vicious thriller then a plot twist occurs which asks the audience to go in a different direction than a simple slasher film but thats probably something to be left up to the audiences decision. Personally I loved the film for being a decent adaptation of Barkers work and for what Kitamura wrings out of his budget. Say what you will about slick looking productions but the images Kitamura frames from slow motion shots of eyeballs popping out of heads, POV shots from a decapitated victim to a final 360 spin around a moving train car I never actually found myself becoming bored with the trickery. There is even a bit of suspense to be had which seems to pop up less and less for me when I watch a horror film so kudos to the filmmakers for achieving that. Another comment I suppose on the film should be about the use of CGI in the movie. On the commentary Kitamura says He tried heavilly not to rely on too much computer work but it does exist in the film and has drawn a bit of criticsm. Trutfully while its glarinly obvious for some reason I reminded of the same criticsm hurled at Takeshi Kitanos adaptation of Zatoichi with the same feeling from me that oddly I found the bad CGI to be beautiful in a way. Not everyone will think so but thats my opinion.
As for the DVD the image and sound quality are great for a standard definition DVD which is good. The extras we're given though are somewhat lacking including a few featurettes on a murder scene in the film, Clive Barker and backstory on Mahogany. What more than makes up for this though is a commentary from both Kitamura and Barker. I don't listen to many commentaries as they can range from banal to interesting to really good. This one thankfully fits in the later as both Barker and Kitamura are chatty through the entire film referencing influences and the way they tried to steer the film. They both share a love of film which shows and in the end discuss the sad state of the films release through Lionsgate which Barker seems to have gotten over- Kitamura still seemed a bit upset in his tone, and in the end thank Guillermo Del Toro who championed a large theatrical release for the film in Mexico.
In the end the Disc gets a hearty recommendation from me. It may not be the worlds greatest horror movie but it didn't deserve the fate it recieved.",1234828800,,3895,4.433751743375175

I had to roll a spliff to calm myself down! We had 10 spliffs throughout the movie, really tasty stuff, I'm smoking it right now actually.

The horror thriller Midnight Meat Train, the adapted screenplay by Lions Gate, stars Bradley Cooper, Vinnie Jones, Leslie Bibb, and Brooke Shields on a journey into the depths of hell! It even features UFC mixed martial arts fighter Quinton `Rampage' Jackson in a very small part.
The film was based on one of the legendary horror writer Clive Barker's (X-Box360's Jericho and PC's Undying) very popular and epic short story from his Books of Blood collection.

Bradley Cooper plays Leon Kaufman, a struggling photographer who's interests lie in the people of his home city. When Susan Hoff played by Brooke Shields disappoints Leon by refuses to exhibit his work until he gets grittier darker sides of the city's people for his upcoming art exhibition, he goes on late night sessions to see what he can find. Little does Leon now that he is luring himself and his concerned girlfriend played by Leslie Bibb further and further into a journey down the subway from hell and ultimately pure evil.

Leon's obsessive nature leads him to Mahogany (played excellently by Vinnie Jones) a vicious Serial Killer who stalks unsuspecting midnight train passengers. The butchering is most gruesomely savage thanks to Ryuhei Kitamura's (Versus, Sky High) visionary genius!

Right, to get this straight, the story starts off slow, but it's great since you get to know the main characters. The film gets intense, and the killing sometimes contains far more gore than initially expected. You are kept on the edge of your seat throughout!

Molotov, Agent M and myself kept freaky scene thanks to the Soundtrack . Vinnie is exceptionally strong armed with killer utensils in his pristine leather bag.

I had been reading a lot about this movie in Fangoria as I anticipated its release, and reviews seemed to regard it favorably. After all, this is Kitamura meets Barker with buckets of blood and gore. Sure to be a success, right?

The plot? A photographer who feels he needs to develop a bit of edge in his art finds himself on the trail of a subway serial killer who works during the day in a meat factory. There are a few threads to the plot such as why is the killer murdering on the subway and will the photographer wind up dead as he trails this obviously dangerous man. As the film progresses, the subway train itself becomes a meat locker full of bodies like cattle to be sliced up.

The first thing I noticed when the movie began to play is the blueish tint to everything. The coloring made the train scenes seem stark and glowing but shadowy and dark at the same time. All but the blood plastered everywhere seemed to glow a blueish-gray. In fact, the coloring of the scenes seemed an important element in setting up the mood throughout the film. Some scenes were very red and brown while others were more blue and gray. The scenes on the subway train where the brutal serial murders takes place are shot in such a way that you, the viewer, feel closed in and claustrophobic. As the meat hammer wielding killer strikes down his victims as if he were a butcher in a meat factory, you feel as if you were right next to them with no escape. The setting is very effective and I have to praise Kitamura for his style and directing with this one.

If you don't like bloody movies, this one isn't for you. It's very graphic and the red stuff just oozes and floods the scenes when the murders occur. The killer has a number of tools for his trade, but his favorite is a meat pounding mallet that smashes skulls. If you think the camera pulls away or shields the gore with a conveniently placed piece of hair, you're wrong. Kitamura makes sure we see every bit of the gore. Eyeballs fly and skulls smash right before our eyes. I am not one for gore for the sake of gore alone, but that is not what these scenes were about. It was never mindless gore, but rather a story that started shocking and jarring and got steadily more suspenseful and scary.

The twist at the end?  Well, I can't say I was surprised.  Barker IS the man who created the Cenobites.  Still, I feel that the ending took away from the element of realism that had until that point characterized the film.  Up until the ending was revealed, it almost seemed as if the subway <em>could</em> be plagued by a rogue train carrying a meat packing serial killer who strikes at night after work in a clever, clean suit.  I'd say see the movie but maybe turn it off before the last 15 minutes.  Unless you like weird monsters.  If so, watch it all the way through!

3696976,4,B001MFNB4O,"Clive Barker adaptations being good are a dime a dozen, which is why I didn't look too forward to The Midnight Meat Train, especially after Lion's Gate quietly dumped it into discount theaters before disappearing and recently premiering on FearNet.  Upon viewing however, The Midnight Meat Train proves to be surprisingly good, and is definitely the best Barker adaptation since Barker adapted his own work with the original Hellraiser.  Bradley Cooper stars as Leon, an up and coming photographer who inadvertantly ends up discovering a murderer dubbed Mahogany (Vinnie Jones) that travels via subway, and slaughters his victims like cattle.  As Leon learns more, his following of Mahogany becomes an obsession that is slowly changing him, and frightening his suffering girlfriend (Iron Man's Leslie Bibb).  This all eventually leads to a bloody showdown, and an ending that is simply dynamite.  The performances are solid (Jones is actually surprisingly scary) and the gore is aplenty, and the overall tone of the film retains the spirit of many of Barker's best works.  The only real flaws with The Midnight Meat Train lie within some of the gore effects.  A number of them suffer from the fact that they are obviously CGI-based, meaning sometimes they just look laughably fake.  Besides this however, The Midnight Meat Train is a surprisingly good and frightening ride that will definitely hold your interest, and is a film that deserved a better fate than what Lion's Gate gave it, and will hopefully find a deserved following now that it's making its way to DVD.",1232323200,28,1568,5.09765625

However, after viewing the film I'm far from surprised because no one in their right mind would ever willingly pay money for this stupid waste of an hour and a half.",1229904000,3,584,4.625
3696982,4,B001MFNB4O,"I can't imagine how truly horrid films like Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning, Hannibal Rising and Saw 3-5 get mass releases when a real horror film get's sent to $1.00 theaters, commercial cable TV and then, finally, Video. Sad.

Clive Barker is one of the best writers of our generation, and his work deserves better attention than it gets. This one, produced by Barker (along with the upcoming ""book of blood"" -- look of it) was the first in what he hopped would be a 2 film / year adaptation of his books of blood stories. Previous adaptations include the b-movie monster yawn Rawhead Rex, Candyman and Barker's own Lord of Illusions (based on elements of ""the last illusion"")

The Midnight Meat Train reminds us of Barker's Hellraiser days, in a good way. While the plot is similar to Candyman -- person stumbles upon murder / urban legend, find out it's real and tries to fight it while being sucked in by it -- this is not Candyman.

For one, it's beyond gory and not in the ultra-glitzy Hollywood horror way. Which explains the limited release, Hollywood doesn't like independents, that's why they keep buying up small studios. But Barker was tired of Hollywood telling him how to make films and limiting him or cutting huge chunks out (see: Nightbreed). So this is Barker against the system

Synopsis: Photographer witness brutal subway murders, investigates while trying to promote career by taking sordid photographs of crime and debauchery, but feels a need to act, only to find himself sucked in.

The movie is fresh, different and worth the time for real horror fans. The character arch is a little hard to swallow, but that's the only real flaw.

A good, solid, blood splattering of a horror flick by one of the genres greatest minds. What more do you need?",1229904000,6,1777,4.753246753246753
3696983,4,B001MFNB4O,"I caught The Midnight Meat Train for free on FearNet On Demand through my cable company. I was shocked to see it available, especially since the DVD isn't due out for months. Clive Barker can be proud of this film because other than Hellraiser, this is the best flick taken from his stories.

Vinnie Jones when used properly in roles like this, is one scary dude. He only has one line towards the end, but his stare alone says everything his mouth isn't. Bradley Cooper is likeable as the lead and the rest of the cast is decent.

You gotta love the gore here. It would make any fan of old school horror films proud. There was a little CGI used, but it didn't really get in the way. The visual style and cinematography are very good as well.

The only negatives would have to be that some of the dialogue is below average and certain characters do some really dumb things, but this is a horror movie, right? It comes with the territory.

The Midnight Meat Train deserved a wider release and will likely gain a strong following on DVD. One things for sure, I won't even think about riding on a subway train at night again.

3696984,4,B001MFNB4O,"Clive Barker adaptations being good are a dime a dozen, which is why I didn't look too forward to The Midnight Meat Train, especially after Lion's Gate quietly dumped it into discount theaters before disappearing and recently premiering on FearNet.  Upon viewing however, The Midnight Meat Train proves to be surprisingly good, and is definitely the best Barker adaptation since Barker adapted his own work with the original Hellraiser.  Bradley Cooper stars as Leon, an up and coming photographer who inadvertantly ends up discovering a murderer dubbed Mahogany (Vinnie Jones) that travels via subway, and slaughters his victims like cattle.  As Leon learns more, his following of Mahogany becomes an obsession that is slowly changing him, and frightening his suffering girlfriend (Iron Man's Leslie Bibb).  This all eventually leads to a bloody showdown, and an ending that is simply dynamite.  The performances are solid (Jones is actually surprisingly scary) and the gore is aplenty, and the overall tone of the film retains the spirit of many of Barker's best works.  The only real flaws with The Midnight Meat Train lie within some of the gore effects.  A number of them suffer from the fact that they are obviously CGI-based, meaning sometimes they just look laughably fake.  Besides this however, The Midnight Meat Train is a surprisingly good and frightening ride that will definitely hold your interest, and is a film that deserved a better fate than what Lion's Gate gave it, and will hopefully find a deserved following now that it's making it's way to DVD.",1229212800,,1569,5.1015625

The hype is real, this movie delivers.

Japanese cult cinema prodigy Ryuhei Kitamura has done it again.  But this time he has taken his anarchic genius and tossed us Westerners a bone by directing this American film based on a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/short-story/dp/0425165582/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">short story</a>&nbsp;by Clive Barker.  The result is spectacular at times and entertaining throughout.  Kitamura is best known for his B-classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Versus/dp/B000JBXP5W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Versus</a>&nbsp;and best loved by me for his modern samurai masterpiece&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Azumi/dp/B000IMUYM4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Azumi</a>.  He has never made a bad film and remains a director whose latest works I anticipate with baited breath. In the past, the biggest problems with his films have been budget-related, though he proved he can make a decent flick with only two real cast members in a single room with almost no special effects in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aragami-The-Raging-God-of-Battle/dp/B0002ZYE64/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aragami: The Raging God of Battle</a>.  Well, with a modest (but large for him) American budget and a damn fine cast including Brooke Shields and Vinnie Jones (he's STILL the Juggernaut, b!+ch!), Kitamura has staked his claim in Western horror and I like what I see. A lot. In fact, there are shades of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Texas-Chainsaw-Massacre/dp/B000FS9FE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</a>&nbsp;throughout.  This may never be quite the classic that one is, but it is almost guaranteed to gather a cult following of its own.

Our protagonist is Leon, a photographer on the verge of success with a beautiful girlfriend.  One night he happens upon a dizzying beauty being assailed by a group of thugs in the subway.  After bravely confronting the gang and using his head to escape harm while getting some outstandingly menacing photos in the process, he watches the girl get onto the late night train.  She is never seen again.  The girl turns out to be a popular model, and when her disappearance is noted by the paper, Leon becomes obsessed with the case.  Turns out folks have been disappearing along that route since at least the 1800's.  What follows is a riveting mystery with plenty of violence, a classic villain, and a twist that is genius even if the foreshadowing for it comes on too strong and gives it away.

Vinnie Jones is intimidating in his no-lines performance as Mahogany, the towering meathead of a butcher who rides the late train and cleans house before the last stop with a disturbingly shiny hammer in one hand and a meathook in the other. His carnage is something to behold and Kitamura's unparalleled eye for jaw-dropping shots that astound with their creativity and downright coolness is put to use on several occasions.  One victim's head goes flying after taking a particularly brutal hammer blow and it is shot entirely with what I'm going to call a decapi-cam.  This is my shot of the year.  The other contenders are also from this film.  The climactic battle aboard the train could have been another typical bad-guy-vs-good-guy slugfest, but Kitamura has the camera swooping 360 degrees around the train as we view the fight through the windows and it comes to a stop just as the combatants bust through the glass right in front of it.  This is the kind of creativity American filmmakers are lacking these days.  There's another fight early on where what has to be the most militant-looking black man I've ever seen steps aboard and mocks Mahogany with a gut-busting quote from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forrest-Gump/dp/B00003CXA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forrest Gump</a>&nbsp;that had me afraid I was going to wake up my wife across the house.  ""Midnight Meat Train"" may have a corny-sounding name, but it delivers the goods big-time.  There's less nudity than I would have liked considering what a sexpot Leon's woman is, but I'll trade some brief nude shots for hammer decapitations any day.

Aside from some obvious filler, a few cutaway shots when I was screaming for more gore, and the excessive foreshadowing -which starts pretty early as genius but begins pounding you in the face as the film approaches critical mass- there is little not to love about this film if you are a horror fanatic.  Craven, Carpenter, Romero, and the other horror directors have got to be shaking in their boots right now because Kitamura is coming on strong with this film.  It's an absolute disgrace that this didn't get a wide theatrical release when so much garbage and so many remakes by so many hacks get millions spent on promotion and become big successes even if you can't find a single person who will admit to enjoying them.  Here's an excerpt from an article that illustrates my point:

""Clive Barker was angry with the LionsGate's treatment, believing that Lionsgate president Joe Drake is essentially shortchanging other people's films in order to focus more attention on movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Strangers/dp/B001D2WU9I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Strangers</a>, where he received a producing credit: ""The politics that are being visited upon it have nothing to do with the movie at all. This is all about ego, and though I mourn the fact that `Midnight Meat Train' was never given its chance in theaters, it's a beautifully stylish, scary movie, and it isn't going anywhere. People will find it, and whether they find it in midnight shows or they find it on DVD, they'll find it, and in the end the Joe Drakes of the world will disappear.""

Amen.

""Midnight Meat Train"" is the kind of original horror that I crave.  I've been critical of Clive Barker in the past as his name plastered across a product often indicates mediocrity, but this film shut my mouth good and proper. Horror fans owe it to themselves to give this one a chance.

4 1/2 stars rounded up for a bleak ending that somehow made me feel elated.",1229040000,45,6469,5.783983140147524
3696987,4,B001MFNB4O,"As someone who takes public transportation on a daily basis and sometimes find myself in a train car with only one other person, MMT creeped me out just a bit more than I was expecting.  I won't go into the details of the plot, as it's already been very well elaborated on by other reviewers, but I will just add that as a piece of modern day horror/terror, I found it rewarding; it was both moody and menacing and though I'm not familiar with Clive Barker's short story, I really didn't feel that it suffered from excessive padding, at least, not so much that it proved to be too detrimental to either the story line or characters.  It's dark and deliberate pace may prove taxing for those that like their films delivered at breakneck speed but if you're looking for a more languid exploration of violence and obsession, MMT, I feel, fills that bill quite nicely.  Mind you, it's hardly a perfect movie, with some lukewarm performances and a few overly dark set pieces that obscure the action considerably, but overall it's a unnerving shocker that satisfies those interested society's grittier and darker side.  The direction, cinematography and art direction were really first rate, as everything seem to take on this shade of dread with subway trains racing through dark tunnels with a frenzied clatter, cameras pulling back along entire length of darkened multi-car trains at hyper speed, yielding shadowy glimpses of the brutality seething in that subterranean slaughterhouse and the omnipresent interchange between shadow and light, especially effective as the characters ascend up from and descend down into the subway stations.  For those who want to know, the gore factor is very much present and is, without question, a principal character.  As I get older and experience death more often, I find that I don't really enjoy that aspect of horror as much as I used to.  Mind you, it's done extremely well, with some very elaborate and original sequences, but, personally, I would have enjoyed the movie a great deal more if it hadn't been quite as graphic as it was.  I know for some, gore and splatter are their number one pre-requisite in a movie and that's cool, but I prefer a bit more subtlety and nuance as I no longer equate horror with blood and gut buts rather with a more unnerving sense of doom.",1228348800,,2315,4.784461152882206
3696988,4,B001MFNB4O,"I remember first seeing a preview for ""Midnight Meat Train"" when I went to see ""Rambo"" (which by the way was a great movie) in the theater earlier this year.  It would make sense that ""Midnight Meat Train"" was promoted before ""Rambo"" since both movies displayed graphic violence and were distributed by Lions Gate Entertainment.  I recall thinking ""This movie looks rather interesting"".  However I never saw the movie in any of the theaters in my neighborhood, so I forgot about it.

One night last month I found that ""Midnight Meat Train"" was playing on ""Demand TV"" so I watched it.  I have to say that this movie is quite bizarre and creepy but fits very well in the horror genre.  I suppose a movie that has the Clive Barker name attached to it is a good thing.  I must admit I felt this Brian De Palma or Alfred Hitchcock (with added gore) thing going on while I watched this movie. I would recommend this movie to horror movie enthusiasts; I don't think it would disappoint them.

The movie follows an aspiring photographer played by Bradley Cooper.  Now had I not been a fan of the television series ""Nip/Tuck"" I wouldn't know who Bradley Cooper is.  He played a supporting character in season five of ""Nip/Tuck""; well here he plays the lead.  I must say he does a good job.  Anyway, Cooper's character is able to get a meeting with a big wig art/photo promoter played stylishly by Brooke Shields (who also was in ""Nip/Tuck"" season 4...hmmm).  Shield's character states that Cooper's work isn't ""edgy"" enough for the city that is New York and tells him to keep trying.

So this takes our protagonist to the shadowy and dark parts of the New York City nights in order to capture ""edgy"" still life.  In the process he follows an attractive female model on the subway and takes her photo.  Then the next day finds out via newspaper that this same model has gone missing.  This leads our protagonist to again visit the subway and this time as he is taking photographs he witnesses a murder.

Now mind you he take photos of the murder and after lots and lots of developing realizes that the murderer is more than likely responsible for the disappearance (and likely death) of the model our protagonist followed the first night he was shooting ""edgy"" photography.  Now to really make matters strange, the murder (Vinnie Jones) is a butcher by day, serial killer by night.  This leads to our protagonist becoming obsessed with piecing the puzzle of this mystery together and being pushed to the edge of insanity in the process.

I will not give anything away, because this truly was a ""different"" type of horror movie.  I will admit there were a couple of ridiculous parts (some dubious CGI and a part where our ""hero"" successfully jumps on the ""Meat Train"" when it is traveling at full speed), but I was able to forgive them because this really was a good horror film, with many twits and turns.

I do think the one thing that might have hurt this movie was the title, ""Midnight Meat Train"".  Now the title was appropriate to the content of the film, but it sounds a lot like a porno movie, honestly.  I don't know what else the movie could have been called, maybe ""Subway Slaughter"" or ""Murder on the Metro"".  Perhaps my movie titles are just as bad; it doesn't omit the fact that ""Midnight Meat Train"" is a daft name for a horror movie.",1228262400,8,3338,4.558724832214765

3696992,5,B001MFNB4O,"I'm not a huge follower of slasher/gore films, but I have seen a fair number of them. For me to say that Midnight Meat Train is that genre of movie is unfair, but from the publicity and reviews I've seen, that is where it will end up. Midnight Meat Train is more of the ultimate fast paced thriller (the type that never lets you go)wrapped in one of my favorite themes of capturing reality through photography. There is a long history of movies that plays the reality of photography against the unreality of what's not quite seen. For me, the use of photography in that manner started with Blow-up in 1966. If you haven't seen Blow-up...try it and then look at Midnight Meat Train again.

This film left me stunned in the same way Apocalypse Now did in 1979. Apocalypse Now has the best set of mind grabbing images of any film I've seen. Midnight Meat Train equals the Marlon Brando slaughter scene for it's intensity. Vinnie Jones as Mahogany is no Marlon Brando, but he does a great job of capturing the dark, menacing image of a human clearly gone insane. Think of the ""Here's Johnny"" scene from The Shining.

For you gore fans, this film is excellent. Think visceral, gut wrenching, ""I really can't watch this"" gore. What I liked is that the gore is not gratuitous or over done, but complements the movie as a whole by being part of this breath taking, wild, thriller of a ride. While there are a couple of gore sequences that didn't work for me graphically, the majority of the work is excellent and very realistic.

This movie is complete from beautiful brown tone shots with light filtered through hazy dust motes to a chilling sound track. I loved that sound track! Every scene is intensely reinforced by the sound track in a way that literally overloads your senses as each series of scenes builds to a climax.

I haven't ready Clive Barker's short story on this, so it's probably poor taste for me even doing this review. I suspect that the movie relies on the viewer having read the story as there are portions of the movie that don't make sense. After seeing the movie all the way through, I could guess at what some of the earlier scenes meant...but this approach has always left me feeling a better job could have been done.

In summary, this movie will not disappoint. My only sadness is that really good movies like this that overstep many peoples sensibilities never get seen by enough people.",1226534400,,2410,4.569444444444445

3696995,4,B001MFNB4O,"Imagine if you will, a slasher movie co-starring Brooke Shields (!)

This movie adaptation of Clive Barker's short story is an edge of your seat, suspenseful chiller, but doesn't have many of those ""Psycho"" pull-back-the -curtain moments, and won't scare you enough to make you lose any sleep.

Never-the-less, this is fine entertainment for fans of the genre, with copious amounts of blood and gore, slashing steel implements and body parts galore.

Bradley Cooper plays Leon, a professional photographer looking for cutting edge material depicting real life in the city.  A chance encounter with a pack of muggers on the subway gives him the break he's been looking for, but it also jump starts his obsession with a silent, intimidating man nicknamed ""Mahogany"", played with just the right touch of menace by Vinnie Jones.

Leon, in true horror movie fashion, begins following Mahogany around, and learns that he is a butcher by trade, working in a meat packing plant.  Coincidentally, or maybe not, Mahogany always seems to be on the subway whenever people go missing, and soon Leon's obsession consumes him completely, much to the dismay of his intended fianc&eacute;e Maya (Leslie Bibb)

The plot moves along nicely, and as the other characters are developed, you learn that not everybody is who they appear to be.  The movie ends with three individual cinematic moments.  The first is a no-holds-barred fight scene aboard the ""meat train"" which really works, the second is the ""explanation"" for the disappearances which doesn't work at all, and the third is the defining moment which you knew was going to happen from around midway in the movie.

Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. Photographer looks for cutting edge material
2. Butcher offers blunt force trauma
3. Photographer gets hooked
4. People keep disappearing
5. Reasonably good movie gets strangled by absurdly cheesy title

3697016,5,B001MFNB4O,"I think the biggest question is how this movie would live up to the short story with the same name. I was a huge fan of not only the Midnight Meat Train short story, but The Books of Blood as well. So my expectations were a little high. Ryuhei Kitamura, the director best known for directing the foreign horror film Versus, had the huge task of this being his first American film. So, long story short, my expectations were high since I was a fan of the source material. Needless to say, I wound up being quite pleased with the film.

Midnight Meat Train wasn't exactly a scary film, in my eyes. It was more of a bloody, thrill ride to me that just wound up being a lot of fun. The gore in it is really exceptional and Kitamura's cinematography really adds to the film. There's a scene where Mahogany knocks off a woman's head with that mallet he's always carrying around. The cool thing is you see everything from her perspective. You see her putting up her hands as a last defense before the final blow, the room spinning, the camera being on Mahogany and the headless corpse, he lowers his mallet as she blinks a few times, and the camera pans out from her eyeball to show her severed head. The film is just filled with a lot of shots like that that'll wind up catching any viewer's eye.

Midnight Meat Train is a gorefest that stays true to its source material and is worth the watch for any fan of Clive Barker's or bloody horror films in general. My biggest worry was the ending staying in tact as I couldn't see how it could be done without terrible CGI or suits that just looked terrible. I don't want to say too much, but I will say this. Nothing was changed and I was completely satisfied with the ending. This is the best horror film I've seen in a long, long time.

It really deserved a better title, better marketing and a better fate.  It can best be described as a *slasher* movie, but it blends in a lot of other styles.  I normally am very picky with slasher movies.  But this movie is filmed very well and has interesting characters.

The film is shot in a dark shadowy way.  Most of the scenes take place on a subway train, covered in clean chromed metal.  In an older theatre or on a regular TV it may be difficult to see all the nuances due to this dark palette.  But watch this on a high quality TV with the lights out and you will see how well shot this is. I can only imagine how good this will look in an up-converted DVD or high definition.

The darkness is clearly used to set an ominous mood.  During many of the kill sequences, we see tons of technical details from reflections in blood to panoramic floating shots.  Based upon the resources that they had to work with, this film is a technical achievement that they should be proud of.

Bradley Cooper is probably best known for his role as the jerk boyfriend in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wedding-Crashers/dp/B000BKVQS4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wedding Crashers</a>.  Here he is very well cast in the lead role of Leon, a photographer trying to break into the art world.  He helps a woman while shooting in the subway late at night, and is intrigued when she ends up missing.  Eventually he discovers Mahogany, played by Vinnie Jones.  He is also well cast as the silent imposing killer.  He's probably most memorable for his silent role as Sphinx in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gone-in-60-Seconds/dp/B00004Z4WR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gone in 60 Seconds</a>.  Here again he is mostly without lines, but the close ups and his harsh cold stares are enough to communicate plenty.

Leon soon becomes obsessed with following Mahogany and finding out what he is up to and why he is doing it.  We see his obsession slowly changing him, and it also affects his relationship with his girlfriend, played by Leslie Bibb of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Iron-Man/dp/B001C08RHA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Iron Man</a>.

The story has many predictable turns and a violent ending with a few curveballs thrown in.  While I'm not crazy about the ending, the movie is executed so well that it mostly overcomes the predictable story line and emphasis on gore.  You also get the voyeuristic pleasure of watching our protagonist as he follows the killer hoping to learn more about him and catch a great picture in the process.

Granted there were a few things I would have changed with the movie.  I personally would have dropped the opening sequence, though it's not bad.  So much of the pleasure is in watching the main character *discover* more about the killer.  The opening sequence kind of desensitizes you to that.  Several aspects to the ending are also not as good as they could have been, but you'll have to see it to know what I mean about that.  In context though, those are minor complaints.

Conclusion

Despite the flaws, this is an entertaining movie that is worth watching. Perhaps the recent string of stinkers I have seen has made me a little more lenient on this movie.  I can understand some people rating this a 3, but for me the stylishness of the movie give it an extra star.  But whether it's a three star or a four star movie, this is one slasher film that you should see for yourself.  Considering how much sub-par horror there is out there, this is better than most.

3697019,4,B001MFNB4O,"Clive Barker adaptations being good are a dime a dozen, which is why I didn't look too forward to The Midnight Meat Train, especially after Lion's Gate quietly dumped it into discount theaters before disappearing and recently premiering on FearNet.  Upon viewing however, The Midnight Meat Train proves to be surprisingly good, and is definitely the best Barker adaptation since Barker adapted his own work with the original Hellraiser.  Bradley Cooper stars as Leon, an up and coming photographer who inadvertantly ends up discovering a murderer dubbed Mahogany (Vinnie Jones) that travels via subway, and slaughters his victims like cattle.  As Leon learns more, his following of Mahogany becomes an obsession that is slowly changing him, and frightening his suffering girlfriend (Iron Man's Leslie Bibb).  This all eventually leads to a bloody showdown, and an ending that is simply dynamite.  The performances are solid (Jones is actually surprisingly scary) and the gore is aplenty, and the overall tone of the film retains the spirit of many of Barker's best works.  The only real flaws with The Midnight Meat Train lie within some of the gore effects.  A number of them suffer from the fact that they are obviously CGI-based, meaning sometimes they just look laughably fake.  Besides this however, The Midnight Meat Train is a surprisingly good and frightening ride that will definitely hold your interest, and is a film that deserved a better fate than what Lion's Gate gave it, and will hopefully find a deserved following whenever it comes to DVD.",1222992000,6,1557,5.126482213438735
3697020,4,B001MFNB4O,"I caught The Midnight Meat Train for free on FearNet On Demand through my cable company. I was shocked to see it available, especially since the DVD isn't due out for months. Clive Barker can be proud of this film because other than Hellraiser, this is the best flick taken from his stories.

Vinnie Jones when used properly in roles like this, is one scary dude. He only has one line towards the end, but his stare alone says everything his mouth isn't. Bradley Cooper is likeable as the lead and the rest of the cast is decent.

You gotta love the gore here. It would make any fan of old school horror films proud. There was a little CGI used, but it didn't really get in the way. The visual style and cinematography are very good as well.

The only negatives would have to be that some of the dialogue is below average and certain characters do some really dumb things, but this is a horror movie, right? It comes with the territory.

The Midnight Meat Train deserved a wider release and will likely gain a strong following on DVD. One thing is for sure, I won't even think about riding on a subway train again.

3697021,2,B001MFNB4O,"So, if I tell you there's a horror movie called THE MIDNIGHT MEAT TRAIN, a few images and expectations might run through your mind.  Taking a wild guess here, whatever you'd imagine would probably be close enough to right to tell you if this is the kind of movie for you.

If I also tell you that it is inspired by a short story by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clive-Barker/dp/0425165582/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clive Barker</a>, it would probably clear up any hesitations you might have either way.  I've never read the short story in question, but based on what I saw, I'd imagine it comes close enough to count.

The story follows, without a trace of irony, Leon, a photographer (Bradley Cooper, he of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alias/dp/B000H5V8D6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alias</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wedding-Crashers/dp/B000BKVQS4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wedding Crashers</a>&nbsp;fame) who is on the search for a truly artistic photo of The City in which he lives.  When he is introduced to a big player in the Art Scene, he is told that his work shows too much fear to truly capture the heart of The City.  His work, you see, is vivid but meaningless.  This phrase is said almost verbatim.

How delightful, then, that the same phrase unabashedly fits the movie in which it is uttered.  Fans of gore will love this thing, as there are several brutal scenes filmed in lush, slo-mo.  The violence is saturated with a winky nod to the CGI that spawns it, and many of the film's most grotesque moments are almost overdone in their swerving, nauseating effectiveness.  If you happen to get off on watching people be dispatched in a subway car streaked and puddled with blood, prepare to be pleased.

Too bad that this blood-soaked sensibility is partnered up with the slow and predictable plight of our idealistic photog.  Flaunting his fear, Leon drives further into the scabby underbelly of The City in search of the perfect photo, and when he stumbles upon The Midnight Meat Train, he becomes obsessed with what it must mean.  There's really no trick to figuring out basic elements of the plot, although the ending -- to people unfamiliar with Barker -- might prove stupidly short.

My guess is that if THE MIDNIGHT MEAT TRAIN had followed to a T the contours of Barker's short story, it would've been a tighter film, although perhaps forty minutes shorter.  Instead, the makers decided to pad out the extra bits with a few pointless chase scenes, some protracted moments of angst, and Leon's urgent search for True Art.  In a film that's all about blood and guts, that poorly placed idealism proves to be the final killing blow.",1219363200,,2801,5.431870669745958
3697022,3,B001MFNB4O,"When I heard that The Midnight Meat Train was being unceremoniously dumped into about 100 or so dollar/second run theatres around the country, I was pretty confused.  Why would Lionsgate do that?  They could have kicked it to the direct-to-DVD crowd or let it die in obscurity in a full-fledged theatre.  This is probably the first time I've seen a first run film drop kicked into a second run theatre.

But onto the actual movie...

The Midnight Meat Train was an amalgamation of some things that worked really well, kind of well and...well not very well, at all.  I guess that same thing can be said of most short stories turned full-length movies.  What I really liked about the short story was that it was pretty self-contained.  The majority of the story was a man, on a train, trying to survive a serial killer dubbed The Butcher who's been systematically murdering people who didn't get off at the last stop of the night.  Mahogany--that's the serial killer--would sit on the subway in New York and wait until after the subway finished its last stop.  Then, he'd smack whoever was still on the train on the head with a big mallet and...well, do what a person nicknamed ""The Butcher"" would normally do.  Throw in a down-and-outer who falls asleep on the train and catches Mahogany in the act, and what follows is a cat-and-mouse game of the protagonist trying to stay alive whilst the killer is trying to do what he does best.

The movie, on the other hand, makes the protagonist into a photographer who wants to catch the ""Truth"" (with a capital ""T,"" no less) of New York City and inadvertently catches Mahogany in one of his photographs.  So, he starts to obsess over it, follows the killer around, almost gets murdered a couple of times, stumbles on the train, stays after he should leave, etc., all until the climax which, while not living up to the intensity, at least adheres to the story in its intent.

What the screenwriter did was take some common Clive Barker themes and input them into the movie.  Where the movie falters in providing a truly grueling tale, it succeeds in interjecting some typical Barker themes (the Self going mad, obsession, sex, violence, things not looking so peachy once you pull back the layer of illusion and opening Pandora's Box, to name a few).  The movie is definitely gory, but a lot of it looks kind of fake in that cheesy CGI sort of way.  Look for a CGEYE (sorry, I couldn't resist) and you'll see what I mean.

The cinematographer was fun and provided some nice camera angles that helped mask some truly cheesy acting.  But whereas the short story was a small glimpse of intensity and terror, the film felt incredibly muddled with a lot of false starts.  Hell, for a movie named The Midnight Meat Train, you'd think the protagonist would be spending most of his unpleasant time on the titular train and not in the streets of New York as he does. Which is too bad, because they could have taken the train sequence and stretched it out at a nerve-wracking pace and the movie would have been worlds' better.  While some of my friends found some sequences very intense (and I agree there were two such sequences), I didn't really find the movie all that terrifying.  Gory, yes.  But not terrifying.

Oh well, best $1.50 I've spent on a movie.",1217980800,4,3290,4.61340206185567

This is one of the most stylish, original horror films to come along in a LONG time.  There's the expected modern digital tricks, but the overall feel and tone of the film is more in line with a classic lost '70's frightfest.  The end result is the best Clive Barker film since Clive himself adapted Hellraiser two decades ago.  If you're a fan of horror, you need to see this, now, on the big screen; it'll likely be gone by next Friday.",1217635200,3,673,4.403225806451613

Midnight Meat Train was much better than I was expecting - I was expecting a VHS-quality movie with a minimally developed plot line, but instead it was actually well-filmed and the story was entertaining and actually logical.  The movie was great - even the normally super-annoying 'damsel in distress' situation which IMO was satisfyingly resolved - if you're going to wait and cower in a corner while your boyfriend gets a beat-down this is what should happen in the movies.  To be fair I like horror and gore when it accompanies a well-developed plot line and has some twisty-turny logic to it.  Worth the time viewing, and I'll watch it again soon as I didn't really watch it with my full attention until about a quarter of the way through because of my low expectations going in.
