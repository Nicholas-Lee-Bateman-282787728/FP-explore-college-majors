7842777,5,6303261817,"This is an instructional video by Liddon Griffith of his self-protection course that he gave in the 1970's. His companion book ""MUGGING - YOU CAN PROTECT YOURSELF"" also teaches these concepts. Various tips on avoiding violent confrontations, and common sense recommendations are presented.  Techniques that are easy to learn and effective are demonstrated, especially for seniors.  This is a valuable video, not only for the material, but for the historical value of presenting an early self-defense course without the hype or outlandish claims.
A great film.",1405382400,,559,5.488372093023256
