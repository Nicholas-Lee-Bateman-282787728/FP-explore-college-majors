He is completely obsessed with a young woman who stayed at the hotel one night, and is very actively stalking her for most of the movie.  He collects her garbage and other things and keeps it in his house.  He also kidnaps another girl and does various strange things to her, such as measuring all her body parts.  This movie is the culmination of a trilogy that took three average high school students from being sane, likeable characters, to the most insane, twisted, creepy state possible.  This movie is very over the top and not for the faint of heart!",1273449600,,720,4.458015267175573

Instead of three misfits whom fate has thrown together, this time we have a single protagonist who becomes further isolated as the film continues.  While the usual scenes of rape and torture are ever present, they affect the main character in an entirely different manner.  Rather than exploding with violent rage or hatred, this time our main character sees his emotions disintegrate entirely.  In the end, people are nothing more than objects to him...no more valuable than the trash we might discard.

I think what made this installment less enjoyable for me was the coldness with which the violece was approached.  In the other two films, the protagonists would take a sadistic pleasure in their actions, often followed by remorse.  These were overall good people who were forced to behave violently to survive in a violent world.  In this film, the main character feels absolutely nothing.  His intentions are neither good or bad; he is simply going through the motions. I understand this is intentional, but it is still somewhat less satisfying for me.",1160352000,,1284,4.875576036866359
