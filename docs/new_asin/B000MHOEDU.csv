8169295,5,B000MHOEDU,"I've seen about 6 of the BBC Productions of Shakespeare plays, and this by far was my favorite. The acting, mood and scenery are outstanding. Derek Jacobi does an excellent job of playing Hamlet, the man who seeks revenge for the untimely death of his father, King Hamlet. After Hamlet is visited by the ghost of his late father and told about a ""murder most foul"", he begins to formulate a plan of acting out revenge. Hamlet questions the existence of being and the essence of what it takes to carry on with tragedy. Jacobi does a phenomenal job with the ""To be or not to be"" monologue, in which Hamlet contemplates the idea of suicide. From here, he also questions his existence, and what it takes to act on impulses.

The notable villain, Claudius, is played by none other than Patrick Stewart. He does a commendable job as well as the man who weds Hamlet's mother. When Claudius sees that Hamlet is onto his crime, he also takes steps to make sure Hamlet will go away quietly. He used his son, Laertes, as a means of getting rid of Hamlet.

Of all Shakespeare plays, this is the one that is the most complex and intricate, and this film production lives up to the impact of the play itself. The acting in this production is fantastic and exemplary, and the dark scenery for many of the scenes is both realistic and fitting. For instance, the opening scene with King Hamlet's ghost is cold, dark and eerie, as Marcellus and Bernardo stay on watch before seeing the ghost.

Fantastic film from the BBC. If you like Shakespeare on film, this is the way to go. By the way, this is referring to the DVD version of the production, not the VHS.",1175731200,2,1641,4.463333333333333
