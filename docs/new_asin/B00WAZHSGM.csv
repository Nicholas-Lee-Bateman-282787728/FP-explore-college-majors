7129679,2,B00WAZHSGM,"When I saw the low-budget shot on video exploitation film Bloodlust on a PAL VHS tape in the early 1990's director John Hewitt was not someone I expected would still be making movies twenty years later.  Bloodlust wasn't the kind of movie that screamed bigger and better things and it was never released legitimately in the United States, although bootlegs did turn up at horror cons.  But his next film 7 years later, the corrupt police flick Redball was a giant leap forward--it played at some North American film festivals, got a positive review from Variety and is currently available to stream as part of Amazon Prime.  But Redball seemed good mainly if you had Bloodlust to compare it to.  Then in 2008 John Hewitt surprised again by making a genuinely fine film--Acolytes, about some disaffected Aussie teens who accidentally uncover the identity of a respectable suburban serial killer but aren't much interested in going to the police.  Hewitt followed that up with X: Night of Vengeance in 2011, a very polished but less interesting film about a high class call girl on what is supposed to be the last night of her professional life, showing the ropes to a teenage runaway just getting started.  It kind of felt like Stanley Kubrick directing a Roger Corman film with its twin impulses towards gleaming, airless artiness and exploitation.

Turkey Shoot (aka Elimination Game) is a loose remake of a 1982 exploitation film of the same name which was also renamed for its US release--in that case as Escape 2000.  The original film which never developed much of a reputation here was the gazillionth rip-off of The Most Dangerous Game, a famous in its day short story that was made into a 1932 film about a former big game hunter who lures shipwreck survivors onto his island so he can hunt them like animals.  At this point a lot of younger film-goers probably aren't familiar with the award winning short story or musty old black and white film--but they've probably seem at least two or three movies that ripped the idea off since it never seems to grow old.  Off the top of my head some newer variations that come to mind are the 1986 Cannon film Avenging Force, the 1987 Arnold Schwarzenegger film The Running Man, the 1993 John Woo directed Jean Claude Van Damme movie Hard Target and the 1994 Ice-T and Rutger Hauer flick Surviving the Game.  There are lots more although Battle Royale and The Hunger Games represent a variation on the idea that is much more popular now where contestants are forced to hunt each other.

The 1982 version of Turkey Shoot took place in a dystopian future where political prisoners were given the chance of receiving pardons if they survived being hunted by the very rich for sport.  The old movie deserves some credit for trying to slip some political commentary into an exploitation flick but it really isn't a very good film and its director pulled off the same trick better a few years later with Dead End Drive-In.  In both cases Brian Trenchard-Smith's targets were the conservatism of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan and their demonization and scapegoating of the poor.  In both Turkey Shoot and Dead End Drive-In that anti-poor conservatism eventually results in societies where the have-nots are either hunted like animals or imprisoned in concentration camps.

The targets of the slick 2014 version of Turkey Shoot are very different--the Iraq and Afghanistan wars (which are represented here by World War Africa which is started based on falsified intelligence) and the dehumanizing effect of reality television.  The main character Rick Tyler (Dominic Purcell, at this point no longer making much of an effort to act) assassinates the Libyan dictator with an amusingly lethal sniper shot but the Defense Secretary reports to the president that the mission was a failure to manipulate her into going to war.  Since Rick Tyler knows the truth and is a liability he is framed for a war crime and shot in the head and left to die by his own men--but he survived.  After attempts at killing him within the walls of the New Alcatraz prison fail someone comes up with the idea of making him a contestant on Turkey Shoot, the most popular reality television program on the planet where prisoners facing execution or life in prison are given the opportunity to win their freedom by surviving three round of the game.  Each round lasts 90 minutes and the turkey (the prisoner) has to get from point A to point B using GPS while being hunted by four killers voted in by the international television audience.  The turkey has to make it to a box and retrieve whatever is inside before the 90 minutes are up without being killed by the hunters.  No contestant has ever managed to advance past stage one of the game so making Rick Tyler a contestant seems like a fool-proof way to kill him and eliminate whatever loose-end threat he might pose.  But Tyler actually survives the first round and the next day in round 2 he will have to survive the 90 minutes with 8 hunters after him--and to make sure Tyler has no chance at survival four of those hunters are heavily armed Navy Seals from his own platoon who have a very personal interest in making sure their old comrade stays dead this time.

Co-writer/director Jon Hewitt does extremely well with the broader satirical elements of Turkey Shoot and has particular fun with the game show hosts and their silly banter and the program's slick graphics which all combine to turn murder into mass entertainment.  Unfortunately Hewitt seems to have no talent whatsoever for staging action sequences and there are quite a lot of them, not one exciting.  The action sequences in Turkey Shoot tend to be confusing, a collection of sloppy shots cut together awkwardly which make it hard to understand what's going on, let alone get involved or excited by any of it.

Turkey Shoot really starts off with a lot of promise but the poorly staged action scenes eventually overshadow the stuff that actually works, turning the movie into a dull and repetitive bone cruncher.  It doesn't help that Dominic Purcell seems satisfied playing a musclebound meat-head even though the movie would have worked better with a smarter and more cunning hero to root for.  Purcell makes so little acting effort that after a while I imagined a movie starring Dominic Purcell and Steven Seagal and wondered which would end up giving the lazier performance.  The fact that I was thinking about this while Turkey Shoot was unfolding in front of me should give a pretty good indication of how involving I found the film.  I also made a mental grocery shopping list.

I definitely can't recommend this one which is a shame because it actually had a lot going for it.  Hopefully writer/director Jon Hewitt will find a better fit for his talents next time.",1435190400,3,6817,4.7941929974380875

I think Dominic Purcell did great (given the job he was given) but the other actors didn't perform well. It's definitely corny at parts and some of the editing seems very amature, but I watched the whole movie if that says anything. I would love to see this story remade into a different film done by different people.

7129704,3,B00WAZHSGM,"This was an ok movie but nothing spectacular. It can best be described as a somewhat weak attempt to recreate Arnold Schwarzenegger's 1980s classic, The Running Man. Unfortunately it's nowhere near as good. The plot and cinematography are all over the place at times and the flashback scenes should come with a seizure warning. But perhaps the worst part is Dominic Purcell's performance because I know that guy is capable of so much better. The entire movie he seems like he just woke up from a bender and wandered onto the set half asleep. He shows zero emotion throughout the film.

The plot is simple.  A man is set up for a crime he can't remember if he committed or not and he finds himself pulled from prison and sent into a games life and death for the amusement of watching fans...kind of like The Running Man. In the game he has to escape various levels as killers are sent in to take him out...kind of like The Running Man. By the end he will discover the secrets that he can't remember and whether he is guilty or innocent of the crimes he was imprisoned for committing. And then some other very The Running Man elements pop up.

It's a decent enough movie to just pop in if you''re bored and maybe would like to see something in the vein of The Running Man. Just don''t expect too much and you won't be in for a disappointment. But if this sounds interesting to you at all I'd just suggest watching The Running Man instead. But if you can take 80s action movies (you poor dead soul you), try The Condemned starring Stone Cold Steve Austin. It's much better and Austin even through in some emotion.",1513296000,2,1610,4.450847457627119

7129762,4,B00WAZHSGM,I think Elimination Game was a great movie! It had plenty of action and was fast paced. I didn't give it five stars because I hate it when everybody is shooting at each other and all you see is a muzzle flash. Bullets don't hit anything so that makes it unreal. Otherwise if you like action movies this is a good one!,1437523200,,317,4.129032258064516

7129766,3,B00WAZHSGM,"This film is a modest version of the more successful ""Running Man."" Rick Tyler (Dominic Purcell) is a Navy Seal accused of killing women and children (not from a helicopter) and has an opportunity for freedom by playing the game ""Turkey Shoot"" by being the prey against killers. I didn't think that Richard Dawson was irreplaceable, but apparently it is so. The game lacked color commentary while it was airing. Then during the second round of the game, it gets weird and the film falls off a cliff while Purcell soars off into the sky.

It seems to me if you are going to copy ""Running Man"" copy the good aspects as well. They needed more colorful killers with a slight introduction. They spent too much time developing the subplot of the incident and they didn't do that entertainingly.

Guide: F-bomb. Sex. Purcell back nudity. Good scene of head getting blown off. They show it several times. Soft 3 stars",1436572800,,909,4.675

8712724,3,B00WAZHSGM,"I hate comments like this on a movie... you could have chose:
- Learning a new skill
- writing that thesis for college due next week
- Dishes
- Fido could really use some TLC, why not take him for a jog? people who just lock their dog up in a pin or leave on the leash all day really disgust me
- Anything Else

But you chose a movie, because you wanted to waste time, just blank for a minute, so no it wasn't a wast of time

Now for the movie,
Script could use work, and the acting was bad...but what  I hated most was the sniper camping the objective... gave me PTSD from my FPS MOBA days...
I think there are also way to many movies like this already, so it also lost a star for orginality, it tried to do condemned mixed with quirkieness of The Hunger Games, and add a comspiracy plot. but they didn't bother working it into the game to much.

If the anchormen were more serious with some comic relief it probably would of been flowed better, but the both of them couldn't pull off sociopath, not the actors fault the director shouldn't had went the sociopath route for their characters.
Ramrod: wasn't a very convincing exmarine, and they also should have shown more of the conspiracy being spun. Like why do I care about world war Africa, and what the hell led up to it? What made the Libian dictator such a crucial power play?

And the fight scenes, this why I watched it, nothing makes you forget about a story plot like some awesome fight scenes, and sadly their were none, the first hand to hand combat scene looked like they looped the first five moves over and over. in round 2 there was a moment when our War hero should have definitely been shot on the stairs, and why was he just shooting into empty rooms?",1534550400,,1721,4.250764525993884
8712725,3,B00WAZHSGM,Unfortunately you know what's going to happen in these dystopian killing games. So leave the plot behind and go to the action and suspense for your entertainment. That part doesn't hold up to well either.,1533772800,,204,4.857142857142857

8712728,2,B00WAZHSGM,"Dominic Purcell, is too good for this movie. All of the other actors are trash. The ""Turkey Shoot"" anchors are quite horrendous, but the script that they have to say during it, doesn't make their acting any better. Could have had a cool story line, but this Hunger Games Turkey Shoot BS was quite bad. They could have had a plot-line that was about a disgraced army commander who was trying to not be eliminated in his discovery of truth, but no they had to muck it up with this game show BS. The visual effects for the ""game show"" was quite sub par, they felt the need to spell everything out while you heard it being said, there was also a point where they had ""breaking news"" and the lights in the background kept flashing. NOT something that was visually appealing, but rather helped my eyes bleed. Also they had a good number of scenes through black and white security camera's. It got a bit annoying and unnecessary. Finally when they commandeered the vehicle. dumbest scene ever. Wish someone with some form of intelligence looked over the script before they put all their wasted $$ into it.",1529366400,,1098,4.55050505050505
