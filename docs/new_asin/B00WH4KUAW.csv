7132214,4,B00WH4KUAW,Cute movie. I think all the actors were really good. Ashlie Dawn Stevens is the next Julia Roberts. Gorgeous and talented.,1436227200,,122,4.857142857142857
7132215,5,B00WH4KUAW,Very funny movie with a unique storyline.  Also some serious relatable human moments...all in all good acting and flow.,1431475200,,119,5.2631578947368425
7132216,5,B00WH4KUAW,"An enjoyable movie. I saw this at a film festival, the entire audience loved it. Plenty of funny moments, but also some more serious dramatic moments.",1430870400,,150,4.8076923076923075
7132217,5,B00WH4KUAW,Very cute and funny!  Recommend it!,1430524800,,35,4.833333333333333
7132218,3,B00WH4KUAW,An easy love story to watch. Had some funny scenes.  The quality of the filming is lacking at times and the acting is B rated.,1486598400,,126,4.04

7132223,2,B00WH4KUAW,Just didn't like it,1482192000,,19,4.0
7132224,1,B00WH4KUAW,I couldn't watch the whole film.  Lost interest very quickly.,1482105600,,61,5.1
7132225,3,B00WH4KUAW,"I think some of the reviews are a bit harsh. It is a really cute,funny and witty romance/comedy. Yes it's an indie, but the storyline is hilarious and I personally thought the acting was in line with the plot and tone of the film. It's good entertainment.",1481846400,,255,4.446808510638298
7132226,2,B00WH4KUAW,"yet another story about an inadequate male, consuming too much All Co Hell and depending on other males, such as those who shut down places of worship of hetero religion with their object rape con dumbs, for guidance on how to relate to women.  Such an idiot that he flatly refuses to have sex with a female interested particularly in having sex with him while pursuing his nonsense pursuit of becoming feloniously enslaved in ""marriage"" with its vast majority conclusion in divorce racketeering.  Wasn't until an hour into this absurd waste of celluloid that I noticed the obvious that the lead ""male"" was a transvestite, chopping off his beard to match lesbian facial appearance and adopting lesbian divorce racketeering ""Beau Ring"" demands as part of the pretentious scheme to satisfy a prior two year nothingness.  Ultimately Ashlie Dawn Stevens character Jamie, the girl who actually seemed to want Thomas for ""something"", is shown as ""winning"".  Basically a sad moo bee about structural impediments to *human* relationships.",1479600000,,1030,5.186746987951807

7132228,1,B00WH4KUAW,Not worth the time to watch.,1479254400,,28,3.8333333333333335
7132229,3,B00WH4KUAW,"The over all plot of the movie was cute. The acting however was not that great it felt very rehearsed and the actors weren't very believable. However I did like the story line of the whole thing, it was not completely original but also not a story that has been done too many times, nor was it one that as soon as it started you knew what was going to happen. The audio was terrible the picture was delayed a few seconds so the words didn't match their mouths (which dose not bother some but it really annoys me), I did try to fix it by pausing it to see if maybe it would catch up and rewinding it neither of which worked. Over all the movie was ok.",1478390400,,650,4.046511627906977

7132232,1,B00WH4KUAW,Slow. Not believable. Not endearing. Ugly actors. Horrible storyline. No twists. Just an all-over irritating movie to watch.,1476576000,,124,5.944444444444445
7132233,5,B00WH4KUAW,cats and dogs are not to dissimilar just different in how they arrive at the same conclusion.,1473465600,,93,4.529411764705882

7132236,1,B00WH4KUAW,awful acting,1459209600,,12,5.5
7132237,1,B00WH4KUAW,"Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. The editing was pathetic, the acting even worse, and I literally had to turn it off after 15 mins. I wanted to turn it off after two, but since it got medium reviews, I thought I'd give it a little longer. Just completely awful. Don't waste your time.",1458259200,5,292,4.327272727272727
7132238,3,B00WH4KUAW,Great movie,1458259200,,11,5.0

7132246,1,B00WH4KUAW,"This movie wasn't released, it escaped.  Waste of time, rather watch paint dry slowly.",1457049600,2,86,5.142857142857143
7132248,1,B00WH4KUAW,I couldn't eve watch more than 10 minutes of it. Very bad movie and poor production.,1456531200,,84,4.3125
7132249,1,B00WH4KUAW,"I normally love indies but not this one. From the first scene the dialogue was awkward and clique. The screenplay seemed very amateurish, This was very disappointing. I hate turning off a movie halfway through yet this one earned it. The acting was good given the bad dialogue but nothing could save this",1456444800,3,304,4.754716981132075

7132253,5,B00WH4KUAW,I think it's good. There seems to some issues of course. But we're not talking Guardians of the Galaxy here. It's an indie romcom. So. My girl loved and I had to watch it. But in the end I liked it. The fat guy was the funniest in the film.,1456099200,,240,3.82
7132254,5,B00WH4KUAW,"This is a great comedy to watch on a rainy Saturday. The directors, producers and crew all seem to have had a great time bringing this story to life and that excitement carries through in the delivery. Great Film. A must watch.",1456099200,,227,4.428571428571429
7132255,1,B00WH4KUAW,"I am still wondering why I watched the whole thing,  Did I really think it would get better?  Terrible acting.  Lacking in originality.  I have no idea how or why this movie was ever produced.  And again, I can't believe I watched it from beginning to end.  How did anyone think this deserved more than one star?!?",1455926400,5,314,4.421052631578948
7132256,1,B00WH4KUAW,this was not a good movie got through 10 minutes and shut it down.. gross acting. No girl would date a slug like that.,1447632000,3,118,3.9583333333333335
7132257,1,B00WH4KUAW,Terrible!  Sound and picture quality was poor.  No closed captioning to help.  Couldn't even make it through the movie!  It might get half a star for effort.,1446508800,5,157,4.703703703703703
8713380,4,B00WH4KUAW,"Not sure why everyone is so harsh....oh yeah everyones a critic. No, Its not a blockbuster hit but it is a cute and entertaining movie.",1534636800,,135,4.44
8713381,1,B00WH4KUAW,"This undoubtedly is the worst movie weve ever watched. The acting is lackluster, and so amateurish. The camera work and sound is more than pathetic. It appears whoever did the editing had a lot to learn, as transitions between scenes are consistently lame and jerky. Its obviously very low budget, which in and of itself is not a bad thing, but in the whole we were very disappointed in this film. The only reason we kept watching was the hope it might improve. No such luck. Do yourself a favor, and take a pass on this abysmal effort.",1521331200,,536,4.479591836734694

8713384,1,B00WH4KUAW,slow & dumb,1512172800,,11,3.0
8713385,2,B00WH4KUAW,"I agree with one of the comments about the lead actor, he is non-believable as a heterosexual  male , too much feminity for this guy to be considered straight and too damn goofy at times, if you can muster it, a definite one time flick",1511481600,,235,4.222222222222222
8713386,1,B00WH4KUAW,"I could barely get through 5 minutes of this movie. Sorry but leading man is not believable as a heterosexual leading man. Definitely not Rock Hudson. A heterosexual woman watching this movie wants a believable leading man. If this actor is not out of the closet, he should be. AND no straight man yells in a restaurant that a woman is PMSing.",1509321600,,343,4.548387096774194
8713387,1,B00WH4KUAW,It was awful. I stuck it out hoping that it was going to get better. It didn't. Very poor acting. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.,1492387200,,140,4.222222222222222
8713388,1,B00WH4KUAW,Worst acting I've ever seen. Please don't waste your time with this movie!,1491091200,,74,4.769230769230769
