740708,5,6303962440,"What can I say, Christians have their bible, and I have Mr. Nanny. This has to be one of the greatest movies ever made. It takes the ""AMAZING"" acting skills of Hulk Hogan (the GREATEST wrestler of all time) with a plot that's undeniably sidsplittingly funny and you have a winner. The story is basically about how Hulk was at the top of the mountain in the wrestling world when one day, everything fell apart. While walking through the valley of the shadow of death, he winds up getting the job of Nanny for some problem children. Will Hulk get his wrestling career back on top? Will he turn these kids around? Buy it and find out! (As an added bonus, you get to see Hulk in a tutu!)",1093132800,12,683,4.3023255813953485

740710,3,6303962440,Mr. Nanny starring Hulk Hogan is quite literally so stupid it is funny.  Really bad acting and a totally off the wall storyline make this worth viewing.  If you like movies that you think are so bad their good you will like this one.,1083542400,4,233,4.2727272727272725
740711,4,6303962440,"I have this movie, alot of comedy, alot of action. I watch it sometimes. This is a good movie for the whole family and if u a Hulk Hogan fan.",1078617600,,141,3.7333333333333334
740712,1,6303962440,"Sometimes you expect a certain something from a film. You expect it to just be good. At least. But the first impression when you hear of ""Mr. Nanny"" is instant nausea. Now, you might not know why this produces nausea until I lay down the plot for you. Think of image no. 1: Hulk Hogan as a babysitter wearing a tutu. While I freely admit that it doesn't sound promising, it's nevertheless astounding that the production team was able to take this simple idea and create one of the most monstrously agonizing motion pictures to come along this year. Now, here is image no. 2: Hulk Hogan giving a small child weapons training. Image no. 3: The child electrifying the school bully with his newfound weapons interest. Image no. 4: Hogan and Kid celebrating because Kid has electrocuted Bully in an awful manner.
What we have here is good material for a spoof. How funny would it be to see an eight-year-old electrocute his bully in a Farrelly Brothers movie? But it's not a spoof. The problem is that in ""Mr. Nanny"" it is not played as a spoof, but as the real thing. The kid supposedly electrocutes his school bully (for real), and we are supposed to feel happy because he has beaten the bully at his own game. That has to be the most sappy excuse for an emotional rush I've ever heard. I don't feel like celebrating with this kid, but rather arresting Hogan and ordering a restraining order on him.
Hulk Hogan plays down-on-his-luck ex-wrestler Sean Armstrong (get it, ""Armstrong""?). He has long since exited the ring because of recurring nightmares involving violence in the ring. To give Sean something to do, his best buddy and manager, Barney (Sherman Hemsley), gets him a job as a bodyguard for computer genius Alex Mason (Austin Pendleton). Mason has invented a new super chip and a psycho is out to get it, so the engineer needs someone to look after his two motherless children (played by Raymond O'Connor and Madeline Zima). Reluctantly, Sean agrees, but only because they already have a nanny and his job will be strictly protection. No sooner has he arrived, however, than the nanny quits and Armstrong finds himself babysitting two demons.
A film like ""Mr. Nanny"" is intellectually insulting on all levels. You have to wonder what the producers and filmmakers were thinking when they gave the ""OK"" to this film. It doesn't have a plot. It doesn't have good acting. It doesn't even have a half-decent script. The only reason for this film, apparently, is so that Hulk Hogan could be shown in a ballet tutu.
Hulk Hogan can't act. His best performance was his three-liner in ""Gremlins 2: The New Batch."" So you can imagine how awful it is when the testosterone-junkie with the deep voice fills up the majority of screen-time in the film, and tries to teach a father the values of family interaction and why it's good to tell your kids you love them. Perhaps this would be good material for, say, a muscle-man that can act, like Arnold Schwarzenegger, but ""the Hulk"" can't act half as good as Mr. Schwarzenegger, and most likely never will be able to.
Most of the apparent laughs in this film come at the expense of Hogan, and at the expense of every film it has borrowed from. It's a bunch of recycled gags posing as new ones. But it might as well be said that I expected it.
To name some of the recycled gags, here they are: He's hit on the head with bowling balls (see ""Uncle Buck""), drenched with water (see ""Dennis the Menace""), covered in flour (see ""Dennis the Menace"" a second time), and electrocuted (see ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York""). Not one of these instances is funny, and it isn't because we've seen it so many times before. And another thing that doesn't help this film at all is the inept direction of Michael Gottlieb. Such comedy, while once amusing in Home Alone, has long since worn out its welcome. Here, it's handled in such a pedestrian manner that it comes across with the audible clunk of a standup comic's joke falling flat. Don't see this movie, whatever you do. If you see it glaring at you in the video store with Hulk Hogan's god-awful smirk on his face, pass it up. Even if it looks like clean family entertainment. It is far from it. It is PG-13 material packaged in a sweet little box. It's not a film. It's merchandising, plain and simple.
There used to be a time when wrestling and Hulk Hogan where what Tony Hawk and skateboarding are today to children. Anything with Hawk sells and, at one time, anything with Hogan sold. Film execs knew this, and played to it. And that's all ""Mr. Nanny"" is: Marketing, plain and simple. Don't give any more money to these selfish corporations. They can live with what they did. ""Mr. Nanny"" was a spur-of-the-moment film made for cash-purposes. I'm surprised that all copies weren't burned after Hogan withered away into the recesses of ""has-been,"" because this film stands out as a single merchandising attempt, and its time has long since passed.",1054512000,4,4929,4.621436716077537
740713,5,6303962440,"well movie is good enough, but i wanted to ask if somebody knows where to get one song from this film, it's called ""I Don't Wanna Go To School"" by Doghouse, i search for it for a long, but i can't find it anywhere. i'd be really thankful.",1020297600,4,238,3.9791666666666665
740714,3,6303962440,"C'mon now, it's a kid's movie. And for the elementary school kid there is no better fantasy than a dream of revenge against the babysitter. For its target audience, there is no disappointment here. Hulk is the retired grappler turned unwilling nanny for spoiled but lovable kids and quickly falls foil to their tricks and traps. Then, of course, they are kidnapped by the evil and campy Buster Poindexter (who is just divine as a criminal with a steel plated cranium) and only the big man can save the day. Radio host and author Mother Love steals the scenes she has as the maid who tolerates Hulk. Some interesting side notes to this film are as follows: the lair of Poindexter which contains a torturous ""poison pool"" was shot on the same soundstage as the original ""Flipper"" series in Miami and the floor was rolled back for the first time in years to accommodate the production. Not used to the opening in the floor, the crew members continually fell into the water during shooting. The part of the first nanny who exits the house screaming with her hair on fire is played by the assistant production coordinator who was the only person available and willing to get lit up at the time. The soundstage and offices were so busy due to the heavy production schedule that the production office actually occupied a small extra stage and the black and white opening of the film, which is a wrestling dream sequence had to be shot inside the same space, requiring the office staff to move all desks, phones, copiers and fax machines to the edges of the room and work quietly during filming. Look for wrestling legend George ""The Animal"" Steele (also in ""Ed Wood"") in the same scene, emoting the famous dialogue ""Hey. You. Nice.""",998006400,,1725,4.659016393442623
740715,1,6303962440,"Hulk Hogan should stick to wrestling, at least in the ring he doesn't have to speak.  Hasn't he ever heard of the wise phrase ""It is better to keep your mouth shut and raise doubt on your intelligence than it is to  open it, and remove all doubt.""  The only thing that keeps this movie  from being a total fop is the cute and intelligent performance of Madeline  Zima, the true star of the show.  We love you Maddie. -Kate",930009600,,422,4.2125

Back when i was a kid born in 1990 Hulk Hogan was my favorite wrestler and these movies i remember with such a fondness. It takes me back to a time when i was happy and my mom was still alive. Other than that man these to me now are great because it's like trippin' out for a little bit watching a few movies and getting soem laughs,while reminiscing. I had not remembered the names til now. Mr. Nanny i remember the best. Hulk has to be a bodyguard for a rich inventor genius who has badguys trying to get their hands on his invention. So he hides it in his daughters doll. Hogan takes to the kids in a kids but family comedy where it can be enjoyed by all. I did not really remember Suburban Commando until the second i popped it in,and like an lsd flashback i was caught up and re-introduced to an old friend. I am about to watch Suburban Commando again. If you are a kid from the 1990s or you are older than that or you dig Hulk Hogan and you know the vibe of that late 80's early 90's movie feel. They are both hilarious and entertaining.

Normally when Warner Bros., which owns New Line, puts out a Double/Triple/Quadruple Feature of previously-released material, they simple use the disc images from those previously-released DVDs to make new dual-sided DVDs.  For an example of this, look at any of their ""Four Film Favorites"" titles, or even the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2009-single-disc-re-release-of-Miss-Congeniality-1-2/dp/B002BIULMG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2009 single-disc re-release of Miss Congeniality 1 & 2</a>.  I figured that would be the case with this double feature, but I was wrong.

Instead of containing copies of the two previously-released DVDs, this single-sided, dual-layer DVD contains both movies and nothing else.  To make matters worse, the two films are presented in 4:3 Fullscreen ONLY!  The individual DVDs of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mr-Nanny/dp/B0000696HY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mr. Nanny</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Suburban-Commando/dp/B0000696HX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Suburban Commando</a>&nbsp;contain both 16:9 Anamorphic Widescreen & 4:3 Fullscreen (open matte) versions of each movie, along with each movie's Theatrical Trailer.  A useless ""Pick That Flick"" photo game, and an even more useless DVD-ROM menu that only takes you to New Line's now-defunct ""Hotspot"" website, are also included on those individual DVDs.

There is absolutely no reason to pick up this Family Double Feature.  If you like both movies, buy the individual DVDs instead.",1313625600,5,2211,7.498069498069498

741804,5,6303962440,"Mr. Nanny is a 1993 family comedy feature film starring WWE Hall Of Famer and current TNA Wrestling star Hollywood Hulk Hogan. In this film, Hogan plays a retired pro wrestler who has been hired by a computer programmer to watch over the widower's two young children, Hogan's character, being that he cannot tolerate kids, reluctantly accepts the job and from then on, the two youngsters drive the Hulkster crazy. Sherman Helmsley(The Jeffersons, All In The Family)also stars as the trainer of Hogan's character. The special features includes the trailer of the film and trailers of other New Line family films. Mr. Nanny is the perfect movie for kids, parents and pro wrestling fans as well.",1299801600,,692,4.974137931034483
741805,5,6303962440,"I originally wanted Suburban Commando but for the same price, I got Mr. Nanny as well. Nice deal. If you ask me why I love Suburban Commando so much, I'd be at a loss of words to explain. I just do! It's funny without being gross or filled with words that would embarass a drunken sailor! As for Mr. Nanny, it's okay but nothing to ""write home about"". I think Hogan over played his part a bit but acting isn't his career of choice. They're both worth seeing but I really recommend Suburban Commando. It's a family film that should keep everyone laughing.",1296691200,2,554,4.388349514563107
741806,4,6303962440,"We bought this to replace a previous copy which got misplaced.  My daughter is a big fan of Hulk Hogan, and loves the movie. Lots of silly stunts in it.  This movie should make anybody laugh.",1295827200,,191,4.277777777777778
741807,1,6303962440,"None of the jokes are funny. It tries to cash in on stuff that was popular back in the early-mid 1990's:Home Alone slapstick,top secert plot devices,family life lessons & big tough doing silly/goofy things but failed. It also has too many stereotypical characters like the Dad and the villians. The kids are psychotic,placing traps that would actually kill Hogan and wanting to be punished. Why don't the kids use these traps on the bullies? Overall,this film is ridiculous and dumb. I give this movie 1 out of 10.",1287187200,,514,4.8522727272727275
741945,5,6303962440,"Brothers, these are possibly the two greatest movies ever made.  I was involved in the production and believe me, I spared no effort in pleasing Hulkamaniacs world-wide.  I actually pride myself in being the stuntman for the Hulkster.  I'm only 5'4"" but, other than that, I look exactly like Hollywood Hulk Hogan.  Using different camera angles you can't even tell that I'm not Hulk Hogan.  I live my life like I am the Hulkster.  I saw some dude perform the Walls of Jericho on another guy at the video store so I knocked him down and gave him an Atomic Leg Drop.  It was then I realized that I had just knocked out Chris Jericho.  Then my buddy, Jake, came out and put a huge snake on his chest.

All this to say that if you havn't seen these movies, or if you don't like them, then you are not a true American.  Don't do that to your country.  I didn't fight for this country to have people ignore this movie.",1274745600,2,912,4.2748538011695905
741946,4,6303962440,Hulk Hogan mixed with children and a spoofy spy thriller plot. Good mindless and clean family entertainment.,1270166400,,108,5.411764705882353
741947,5,6303962440,"This movie rules. Had it on VHS now on DVD. Hulk does it again but this time as Mr. Nanny. Normally was hired as a body guard and then turned body guard/nanny. The movie was great, the plot feels like Problem child meets Home Alone but during the daytime. the 2 kids were good, the father looked iffy but good, and Hulk Hogan in a Tutu. Can't beat that and don't forget Mr. Jefferson as Hulk's manager Bert. No cussing in this that I can remember listening to so a great film for the family. All-in-all, worth the money and the time to watch.",1264982400,2,542,4.221153846153846

741949,5,6303962440,"Ever since I was a kid, I've loved this movie! Hulk Hogan is awesome and hilarious as Sean Armstrong, who is an ex-wrestler who is soon hired by Alex Mason, Sr to protect his kids. Mr. Mason is developing a new anti-missile system and a man by the name of Tommy Thanatos is after the microchip that has the information. Mason's kids; Alex and Kate make Sean's job harder because they want to get rid of him by setting up 'Home Alone' style traps so Sean will leave. Sean doesn't back down and the kids slowly begin to like him. After the Mason family is kidnapped, Sean does whatever it takes to get them back. I highly recommend MR. NANNY!!!",1254268800,,642,4.358333333333333

These are the movies I will forever remember Hulk Hogan from. Super cheesy and ridiculous so not for some. But for people who loved them growing up and maybe watched when past midnight - things are always funnier then!",1250035200,,343,4.4603174603174605

741952,5,6303962440,"I watched these films when i was a little kid and loved them, Hulk Hogan was my hero. They are cheesy as hell, if you don't like that then i would not get these. Now if you think Hulk Hogan is a god like I do, then buy these fast. The only problem is they are Fullscreen, but does it really matter with these movies?",1196553600,2,316,3.876923076923077
741953,5,6303962440,"This movie is such a masterpiece. My favorite part is after the credits when Hulk Hogan is playing guitar wearing an American flag cape, but everything before that point is almost as good. Every time Hulk Hogan punches someone (about every five minutes) there's a whistle sound effect. Outstanding! This movie shows that Hulk Hogan has a sensitive side to him while still being able beat evil doers/zombies/Sinbad into submission. I used to watch this every day and get really angry because it was so good.

But you have the get the DVD of this movie! The theatrical version is awesome enough by itself, but the DVD has some great easter eggs. In the cut version of the movie, Hulk Hogan is from outer space and lands on earth after crash landing. He has special powers like the ability to burrow underneath the ground and pop up behind his enemies. If you like cinema, you'll love Mr. Nanny.",1178755200,3,892,4.6455696202531644
