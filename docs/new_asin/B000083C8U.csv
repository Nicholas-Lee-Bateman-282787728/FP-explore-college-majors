1825344,5,B000083C8U,"I enjoyed the movie. I just saw it for the first time yesterday. The movie was deep. I love Nelly and I am a huge fan of his. The only thing I didn't like was that he curse too much in the movie, other than that I enjoyed him in it. I had been wanting to see the movie but, it sold out in the stores quick. I wanted to rent it but it was always rented out on VHS and that was the only way I could see the movie is on VHS. I guess I have to get me a DVD.  I recommend everybody get this movie especially if you like action packed movies. It's also funny.",1047254400,,553,3.6470588235294117
1825345,5,B000083C8U,"How was this movie not released until now? It was made when Nelly released his second album and Sam Jones (who pulls a Sean Nelson and steals the show)stars on Smallville. While you can figure out the plot of the movie in the middle of it. An unexpected plot twist happens that isout of the blue. There is another twist in this movie that reflects real life, however it will spoil the plot of the movie, so I'll post a warning here for those that doesn't want the movie's twist given away.
SPOILER....
Dante Suarez has a cameo in this movie and much like Prolifick, whose mucis is never released to the public. Dante's album was never released when RCA dropped him from thier label. So this is the only time you get to see him ever.",1046995200,2,732,4.350364963503649
1825346,4,B000083C8U,"""Snipes"" is entertaining. It's not a cinematic masterpiece, nor does it aspire to be. It's leaps and bounds better than your average hip-hop movie where the latest rapper du jour gets a starring vehicle...""Exit Wounds"" with DMX was a painful movie to watch. ""Snipes"" is enjoyable. Sure, there are some scenes that stretch the limits of plausibility, but all in all, it's a fun movie.
In the interest of full disclosure, I must say that I worked on this movie as a Production Assistant, but I'm not biased. I only worked on it for 2 days. But in one scene, they put me in the movie. I get carjacked near the end. Of course, I had to sit through the entire movie to see my 5 seconds of screen time, but ""Snipes"" made it an enjoyable wait. Check it out if you like fun urban thrillers.",1046390400,3,782,4.363013698630137
1825347,3,B000083C8U,"Just good, not great. But well worth watching. Nelly, as Prolifik, does the best he possibly could with what he given. Good for his first try. But if you are thinking this is a Nelly movie you'll be very disappointed, for this film centers around a kid named Erik who puts up snipes (promo posters) for Wax records. Caught up in middle of a deadly game of greed between low life hoods and a low life record label owner, Erik (or Snipes as dubbed by Prolifik) sets out to find the cause of his troubles. The movie starts off real good, but once you get through the main plot twist it loses momentum. Worth seeing once. After that you'll just watch it only half the enthusiasm of the first time.",1044489600,,693,4.338461538461538
1825348,5,B000083C8U,"I saw this movie in the theatres and it's really good. It has enough comedy, action and twists to keep the movie interesting. Also the acting is really good especially considering some of the actors are actually rappers (Nelly, Charlie Baltimore, Schooly D). I always want to say that in the symopsis they put the main character as Sam Jones III and the actor as Erik Triggs...Its the other way around the character is Erik Triggs and the actor is Sam Jones III.
GET THIS MOVIE TODAY!!",1040860800,,485,4.586206896551724
1825349,5,B000083C8U,"Nelly's debut movie was definitely a hit to me, not just because I'm his #1 fan, it just was. I recommend this movie it's good enough to see over again so I'm gon' hit the theaters back up. Although there were a very few things that weren't all that good but he's still a five!",1034294400,2,277,4.054545454545455
1825350,4,B000083C8U,"The reason I liked this film is b/c it exceeded my expectations.
The storyline was good. The acting was good. The overall premise was good. Nelly did an OK job.
good mixture of crime, exposing the criminals and digging for the truth.
This film shows just how ugly and misleading the music industry can be.
I recommend.",1295568000,,318,4.5964912280701755
1825351,4,B000083C8U,"While I have yet to see this movie, it looks great.  Nelly is talented and their is Brief Nudity.",1280361600,,97,4.105263157894737
1825352,5,B000083C8U,"If you're expecting ""Snipes"" to be a standard entry in the rapper-tries-his-hand-at-acting genre, prepare to be pleasantly surprised. This is a complex, intelligently written thriller filled with unexpected twists and turns. Fans of Nelly will find plenty to praise (yes, he actually does have acting chops!), and as a hardcore fan of the HBO series ""Oz"" I loved the supporting roles played by Dean Winters and J.D. Williams (who also stars on HBO's ""The Wire."") And interestingly, since this film came out, the female co-star, Zoe Saldana, has blown up as an actress. (She's had major roles in Steven Spielberg's ""The Terminal"" and starred opposite Ashton Kutcher in ""Guess Who."")

In a nutshell, a smart screenplay, a solid cast and a lot of surprising twists add up to make ""Snipes"" a very entertaining film, and much more than you might expect upon first glance.",1123372800,,866,5.013888888888889
1825353,5,B000083C8U,"I think that this movie is very, very, good. All the actors are good specially Nelly, he can act. Through out the movie there's a lot of twists and you can't stop watching, it keeps you wanting to know what's gonna happen next. I really recommend this movie to everybody dispite what other people say, SNIPES is awesome.",1103587200,,320,4.5344827586206895
1825354,3,B000083C8U,"First of all, I despise Nelly. I think he's one of the worst mainstream rappers out there. The man can't rap and this movie shows that he can't act either. I really don't understand why all the other reviewers praise him as one of the best rappers to act in a film (but then again, none of the other reviewers even bothered to mention Winter's brilliant acting, so what do they know?).
I know that it sounds like I'm being unfair to Nelly just because I don't like his music, I actually tried the best I could to give him a chance. The fact is, the guy didn't show any emotion whatsoever, had the same exact facial expression throughout the entire movie, and used nothing but annoying slang words (which is really probably the writer's fault).
The movie, however, really suprised me. After watching the first ten minutes, I was just about ready to shut it off (it seemed like just another steriotypical hood movie that uses a bunch of slang words that anyone who doesn't watch MTV or BET won't understand), but I'm glad that i stayed around. The plot turned out to be great, with lots of twists and suprising swerves.
In my opinion, the best thing about this film was Dean Winters. I'm a huge fan of the hit HBO show Oz (His character, Ryan O'Reily, is actually my favorite prisoner on the show), and I only rented this because he was in it. Dean didn't disappoint either. He plays the arrogant, greedy, and selfish Bobby Starr perfectly. In fact, he's so good that it's almost impossible not to hate him. I'd also like to mention that there's a terrific deleted/extended scene with Bobby Starr and Johnnie Marandino, where Bobby furtherly tries to persuade Marandino to fund him for his rap company.
Overall, Snipes was a suprisingly good film. I give it a 7/10.",1084579200,2,1763,4.564668769716088
1825355,1,B000083C8U,u get pretty sick of hearing 'f' this 473 times. Otherwise decent movie,1079308800,,71,4.538461538461538
1825356,5,B000083C8U,"I loved this movie.  Nelly has awesome tallent, the ability to act and the ability to rap.  I just got done watching this movie and I must say that it is way off track of what I thought it would be.  I pictured this movie like another 8 Mile but it is way different.  It's such a good movie yet too many people die in it and it makes it way too sad.  They completely confused me with the whole thing but once you've watched it you'll understand it, at least i did.  Nelly does an awesome job but what shocked me was him turning out to be the bad guy.  Either way, how ever you want to look at it, this is an awesome movie and i would recommend this movie to all people!!!",1056240000,,671,3.925925925925926
1825357,5,B000083C8U,"Yes, first of all I am a HUGE fan of Nelly's and that's a main reason I wanted to buy the movie. So, I did and I LOVED it. It's not a one of those 'rapper movies', it's actually very good and excellent to be Nelly's first film appearance. I actually could place myself into each characters situations and actions, and it's not often I'm persuaded into movies to that depth.
From the beginning of the movie until the end, I never wanted to stop the movie, anyone to interrupt me and never once did I get bored with any of it. There was ALWAYS something going on to keep me interested in the movie.
Others may disagree but I really think this is a good movie. It has some vulgar language and some mature situations, dealing with fights, guns and abuse - but I recommend this movie to everyone and that's why I give Nelly and the movie 5 stars!",1055894400,,841,4.229813664596273
1825358,1,B000083C8U,"Sj3 is the effin' man, dawg. When he ain't helpin' out in Smallville with his amazing deliverence of ""Aw Snap"", or doing death defying stunts (See the episode where he says ""It's ok, byron"" and gets thrown, then gets run into by a car. A parked car.). And he was awesome as that autistic hero in Zig Zag, downright brilliant, makes me think he should have been the lead in Titanic. Leo who? Leonardo Jones III, that's who.
But none of this flick measures up to the spouting of his one line per episode of Smallville. ""Bad"" Pete is the bomb digity. And he does it with dignity. ""For you, green means stop, red means go.""
SJ3 is a shallow nickname, let's step it up, SJ Cubed.
Snap on, brother.",1053129600,,692,4.3307692307692305
1825359,2,B000083C8U,"So we add yet another attempt by a rapper to enter into the movie industry.  And we add another failure.  Why can't these guys get a clue that they just cannot act?  Ok, so maybe Nelly is the best out of the lot.  DMX doesn't even compare to him.
Snipes is just a poorly directed and poorly acted film.  Sam Jones III is excellent, but besides him, everyone else fumbles through their lines.  The kid does have a future in movies unlike the rest of the actors.
The entire concept seems to be derived straight from a B rap movie that has been made a thousand times before.  There are twists and turns that make you want to find out what happens in the end, but I was in no way biting my nails or on the edge of my seat.
The directing was flat and led to a slow, slow pacing of the movie.  There was very little humor to fall back on.  It seemed as if the director couldn't figure out what sort of atmosphere he wanted to create.
Snipes really didn't hold its own and I would not recommend it for any situation.  It's just a bad, bad movie.  2 Stars",1047686400,,1047,4.083333333333333

I like Nelly, but I thank he should just stick to rapping, but I ain't mad at him! Shot out to Nelly! Oh I can't forget about Zoe Salanda! She's a pretty good actress! No doubt! Once again Thanks Amazon!
