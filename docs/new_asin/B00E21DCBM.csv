5886564,5,B00E21DCBM,"I'm looking forward to watching Ian McShane's earlier work and Ava Gardner is a superb actress. Directed by Roddy McDowell, it's sure to be an interesting movie.",1403049600,,161,5.0
5886565,1,B00E21DCBM,"There are movies that can kill careers and ""Tam-Lin"" is one of them. During its initial release I remember director MacDowall doing the talk show circuit praising his leading lady (Ava Gardner) and going on and on about how wonderful it had been working with her. Well, I hope they had a grand time shooting this dreary mess because not one single scene plays. Tedium settles in pretty fast and the unintended guffaws start to pop up almost continuously. No wonder this clunker disappeared before I could get to my local movie house, maybe explaining why MacDowall never directed another feature again.

Miscast as an evil woman, Gardner playes a femme fatale to end all femme fatales, luring young men to her trap and then disposing of them when they tire her or they've had enough. Also miscast is Stephanie Beacham (who looks too smart for the part) as the young ingenue who manages to interest the widow's current gigolo Ian MacShane. Amidst the most tiresome scenes of ""decadence"" since ""La Dolce Vita"", the young ones fall in love. The couple is then hounded in the style of ""The Most Dangerous Game"" as cliche follows cliche in a numbingly predictable pattern.

Olive Films is to be commended for resurrecting forgotten gems. In this case, it would have been better to let sleeping dogs lie. The Blu-Ray presentation probably looks better than the original release, unfortunately, this film is one big and lo-o-o-ong yawn.",1398470400,,1429,4.8765432098765435
5886566,4,B00E21DCBM,The 4th star is simply because Ava Gardner is in the flick...even at her age she still dominates this movie.  Plot is confusing but the acting in general is very well done.  Ava plays an evil sort of fairy godmother to an ever changing eclectic group of young wasterels.  Thrill seekers who gravitate to Ava's wealth and beauty rather than lead their on lives.  As the evil fairy queen she always gets her way until the stud of the moment in Tam Lin decides to go with another woman....Ava goes nuts and plans revenge.....see the movie for the climax,1396310400,,550,4.525252525252525
5886567,4,B00E21DCBM,"Roddy McDowall's only directorial effort,THE BALLAD OF TAM LIN, is one of the most misunderstood films of its time. Based on a ballad by Robert Burns, the story was updated to then contemporary 1970. The original story tells of a medieval knight who is seduced and held captive by a witch before being saved from her power by the love of a maiden. McDowall and screenwriter William Speier transform the witch into a fabulously wealthy older woman (Ava Gardner still looking great at 48) and the knight into a contemporary young man (Ian McShane in an early role) distracted from life by easy pleasures. He's happy to be the head boy toy amongst her minions of fashionable young people (which include Joanna Lumley, Madeline Smith, and future director Bruce Robinson) until he meets the local Vicar's daughter (Stephanie Beacham at her loveliest) and then he's in a quandry. Ava doesn't take kindly to competition and plots his demise, just as she has done with several boy toys before him. However, like the others, he'll be given a slight chance to survive although so far, no one has.

The misunderstanding arises from the fact that AIP (American International Pictures) promoted it as a horror film rather than as a poetic romance even reediting the film and retitiling it THE DEVIL'S WIDOW to try and achieve this effect. As a result, no one was happy, and the film sank witout a trace although I managed to catch it on a double bill with the Timothy Dalton version of WUTHERING HEIGHTS. I didn't understand it at the time but I was able to pick up on the romance angle and it was close to being the loveliest film I had ever seen. Seeing it now, uncut, in McDowall's original version is a true delight. Yes the fashions have dated along with some of the dialogue but the music by The Pentangle and Stanley Myers is still evocative and the cinematography reflects McDowall's expert knowledge of photography. Ava gets a great final leading role and Scotland has never looked lovelier. The drugged out finale has lost some of its punch but as a bittersweet statement on growing old and the power of young love, TAM LIN still has something to say. This Olive Films transfer is absolutely gorgeous.",1387324800,15,2198,4.723958333333333
5886568,5,B00E21DCBM,"I can only agree with the other two reviewers here. This is a neglected and underrated movie. The DVD transfer is beautiful. My only regret is that the terrific introduction by Roddy McDowall, which was on the Republic VHS tape, isn't included on the DVD. That small quibble aside, it is great to finally have it on DVD.",1382054400,6,320,4.5344827586206895
5886569,5,B00E21DCBM,"Actor Roddy McDowall's only directorial effort, 1970's ""Tam Lin"" was an AIP release and later on VHS from Republic.  Mentioned repeatedly in the same respect as Charles Laughton's only directorial effort, ""Night of the Hunter"" which also is an artistic rendering of kind of folklore.  McDowall, who around this time starred in the degradations of the British horror picture, ""It"" and AIP's ""Angel, Angel, Down We Go"" (AKA: ""Cult of the Damned"") and has never given the likes of the powerhouse performances Laughton gave.  But ""Tam Lin"" (AKA: ""The Devil's Widow"") is very good despite the critical panning the film received upon release which caused it to barely receive a distributing.  It never stopped AIP before, but I am not familiar with its initial release.  I'd been looking for its release on DVD for some time since reading a recent gothic novel of the Scottish folktale and poem upon which the original screenplay by William Spier is based.  Ava Gardner is chillingly cast as the evil ""Queen of the fairies"" and Ian McShane (who starred opposite Oliver Reed in ""Sitting Target"" that same year and was also the lead opposite Hayley Mills in her father, John Mills' only directorial effort, ""Sky West and Crooked"" (AKA: ""Gypsy Girl"") is cast as the hero of the fable.  Again, he is very appealing.  Stephanie Beacham is cast winningly as the good girl.  She has been known for some unusual roles in Hammer's ""Dracula A.D. 1972"" and ""Superbitch.""  Besides, McDowall's skill with actors and involvement with rather dated jet set mileau of the early seventies, he artfully and very colorfully directs with striking cinematography by Billy Williams and music by Stanley Myers and a number of songs by Pentangle.  It is a very good adaption of the Robert Burns poem and a rather literal version of the Tam Lin story despite the modern take.  The film is presented here by Olive Films in a very good and deserving Blu-ray with no extras.  They also manufacture a DVD version.",1381536000,7,1977,4.883233532934132
5886570,5,B00E21DCBM,"Olive Films continues to unearth rare films from the Paramount archives and here we have actor Roddy McDowell's only directorial effort 'TAM LIN' aka 'THE BALLAD OF TAM LIN' aka 'THE DEVIL'S WIDOW'-1970, a film which had the reputation of being a Horror film but instead emerges as a tragic tale of love and revenge.  McDowell along with screenwriter William Spier have taken the ancient Scottish folk tale adapted by poet Robert Burns , sung by folk artists such as 'SANDY DENNY AND FAIRPORT CONVENTION' ,'PENTANGLE ' of which their version is included throughout this film, and 'JUNE TABOR' among others and given it a Seventies reawakening.  Ageless actress Ava Gardner is excellent as Michaela Cazaret, a millionairess who hovers Charles Manson-like over her brood of teenage runaways in her Carter Hall mansion in Scotland.  When her boy toy Tom Lin played by a young Ian McShane falls in love with his outsider soul mate brilliantly played by Stephanie Beacham, the spell is broken and she vows to have him killed in a chilling take on Director Ernest B. Schoedsack's classic 'THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME'-1932. Gardner predates actress Delphine Seyrig's performance of Countess Elizabeth Bathory in Director Harry Kumel's excellent 'DAUGHTERS OF DARKNESS' aka 'LES LEVRES ROUGE'-1971 as she whispers her lines with a sinister twinge. Genre fans will spot Hammer actresses Jenny Hanley and Madeline Smith and also future 'NEW AVENGERS/ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS' star Joanna Lumley in nice cameos.  Other excellent characters are veteran actor Cyril Cusack as Beacham's vicar father and British comic Richard Wattis playing against type as Gardner's sinister private secretary.  Although the early Seventies hippie-like tendencies abound (one character asks a young nubile if she would like a pill and she reply's 'I'll swallow anything as long as its illegal') and date the film slightly, it is abetted by the wonderful images by cinematographer Billy Williams and the jazzy score by Stanley Myers.  It is a pity that McDowell never directed again for he has a great eye for visuals and gets excellent performances from his actors which reminds this fan of actor Charles Laughton's only directorial opus 'THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER'-1955.  Olive Films releases it in a beautiful 2.35 widescreen transfer with great colors making the Blu-Ray purchase a worthless option with chapter breaks but no extras, not even a trailer.  Not a film for everyone but if you allow it to envelop your senses, 'TAM LIN' will emerge as one of the most hauntingly mesmerizing films in all of British Cinema.",1381190400,7,2581,5.157894736842105
8600324,4,B00E21DCBM,"I had never heard of this film and I pride myself on familiarity with the odd and forgotten offerings of the era. This is a beautifully restored version of Roddy McDowell's sole directorial effort and it is surprisingly solid in that arena. A little slow maybe, but with an eclectic cast featuring Ava Gardner and Ian McShane. Also some surprises including like Bruce Robinson (""Withnall and I"") , Sinead Cusack (and Dad Cyril) and Joanna Lumley, later of ""Absolutely Fabulous."" Probably not anyone's favorite movie, but worth a peek.",1517184000,,534,5.01123595505618

8600326,3,B00E21DCBM,A bizarre 60's film. Lowbudget but oddly watchable.,1513468800,,51,5.5
8600327,3,B00E21DCBM,"This movie brings the story of the classic British ballad Tam Lin into modern times (at least, times contemporary with its 1971 release) by making the Faerie court a collection of mindlessly decadent, hippie-style Young Things under the sway of wealthy Ava Gardner in her manor house somewhere in rural England. Tom/Tam Lin, played by a youngish Ian McShane, is a favored member of the court decides to leave it after he falls in love with sweet, innocent local maiden Janet. Naturally Gardner, the Faerie Queen, is Not Amused at his defection; to punish him, she forces him to drink LSD or something like it and then sends him crashing out into the moors with the rest of the court in hot pursuit. Janet must help him fight off both his delusions and his pursuers.

I bought the film because Im a big fan of both McShane and British ballads. The story did a good job of updating the ballad, but I found McShane less than impressive. At this fairly early stage in his career he apparently was shooting for Dark and Brooding, which he had the looks for, but I think the trickster personality he later developed in Lovejoy, Deadwood, and, most recently, American Gods has served him much better. On the other hand, Ava Gardner knew exactly what she was doing and did it very well, appearing compelling and glamorous at almost 50. Janet was completely forgettable, but I think that was more the fault of the way the role was written than of the actress.

Overall, I found the film adequate but not impressive. As some other reviewers have remarked, it is not really a horror story, although it certainly has tension and suspense. It uses a few special effects in connection with Toms hallucinations, but not nearly as many as I would have liked. On the plus side, the ballad and some of the other music are performed by the classic British folk-rock band Pentangle.

Incidentally, ignore all the stuff in the blurbs and the DVD jacket about the Devils Widow. This term for Gardner is never used in the film, nor should it have been. Shes the Faerie Queen, and thats quite enough.",1498348800,,2076,4.635869565217392
8600328,3,B00E21DCBM,"Roddy McDowall's only directorial effort is a modern day retelling of an old legend from the England / Scotland border region, of a young man enthralled by the faerie queen. Set in the swinging 70s, it is a tale of obsession, decadence, and fury when the young man rejects the older wealthy woman for a younger woman his own age. It is an uneven effort, with the sex and drug culture of the 70s muddying the ritual nature of the drama. Though it would have cost more, a proper medieval setting would have served this story better. Ian McShane is quite good as the hapless young man, while Ava Gardner is perfectly cast as the faerie queen.",1446940800,2,639,4.47008547008547

8600330,2,B00E21DCBM,"With the statement that this is Roddy McDowall's ONLY directorial venture, one can only be thankful.  The pacing of the film is slow, plodding to it's predictable conclusion and could have benefitted from editing and also a little more depth of characters.  The film seems as shallow as the lives of the young people who apparently inhabit Mrs. Cazaret's estate.  No real answers as to who they are, why they're there and what they really do all day.  I started to deduct stars as I waited for the movie to end.",1438732800,,511,4.582417582417582

8600333,3,B00E21DCBM,I can't really review this movie because it had no sound (audio). This is the fourth blu ray from olive films that did not have audio.

If I had known it was an Olive release I would have tested it sooner . Please beware of Olive blu ray releases . Every one I've bought had no audio .,1424044800,2,439,3.888888888888889
