5469823,4,B00AQAZYVE,"My 4-year old son and I had been looking forward to this release for months.  We thought it was going to be a movie, but I was disappointed to learn upon delivery that it was a collection of short, unrelated episodes.  Of course, my son didn't seem to mind.",1366329600,2,257,4.224489795918367
5469824,5,B00AQAZYVE,This is and Awesome DVD. My son loves watching it over and over again. instructional and extremely sweet. perfect for hours of fun!,1365811200,,131,4.739130434782608
5469825,1,B00AQAZYVE,my son is a huge thomas the train fan. he found this movie to be extremely boring. waste of money,1364428800,,97,3.9
5469826,5,B00AQAZYVE,"All aboard for another Thomas adventure in Thomas & Friends: Go Go Thomas. Quite honestly, whenever a new Thomas DVD arrives I wonder if this will be the time my son grows tired of it. Nope! He can watch Thomas all day and never grow tired of it! I don't know what it is about that little blue engine but my son has adored him for years.

This Thomas DVD is a little shorter than most we have with five episodes. The Thomas episodes go by quickly so my son was a little disappointed when it was over so fast in just under an hour. I on the other hand think its the perfect length! Sometimes I need my kids to keep busy longer than  a regular TV show thats thirty minutes but shorter then a two hour movie. That makes this Thomas DVD my new favorite!

In the Welcome Stafford episode a new train is introduced. My son has already added it to his birthday list! His favorite episode was Race to the Rescue because aside from trains, fire trucks are his second favorite thing! Flynn is one of his favorites and we don't see him often enough.

I love that even though Thomas and his friends are always getting themselves into tricky situations they always work together to learn some life lessons. My four year old really absorbs these lessons and takes them to heart. After all, if it comes from Thomas it must be true (even though mom tells him the same thing).

Thomas & Friends: Go Go Thomas is another great addition to the beloved Thomas & Friends franchise. You can enter to win yours below!",1362614400,5,1494,4.321428571428571

5469832,4,B00AQAZYVE,"Thomas and Friends are Thomas and Friends once again. Thomas is the cheeky one; James is vain, but lots of fun; Percy pulls the mail on time; Gordon thunders down the line; Emily really knows her stuff; Henry toots and huffs and puffs; Edward loves to help and share; Toby... well, let's just say he's square.",1404172800,,309,4.535714285714286
5469833,4,B00AQAZYVE,"My nearly-two year old son loves the Thomas episode collections. This DVD includes:

Express Coming Through - Thomas pridefully tries to pull Gordon's Express carriages but realizes he isn't strong enough.
Race to the Rescue - Flynn overcomes his fear of looking silly when he wobbles on the road to put out fires
Flash Bang Wallop! - Thomas, James and Gordon all try to be in the most photographs the photographer is taking for a book about Sir Topham Hatt's railway. Their silliness causes problems, and Thomas learns a lesson in character.
Welcome Stafford - Spencer takes Stafford, the new electric engine, on a tour of Sodor but doesn't realize Stafford's battery runs down easily.
Ol' Wheezy Wobbles - Thomas thinks he knows best when it comes to asking Den and Dart to fix Ol' Wheezy, but he learns sometimes two minds are better than one.
Mr. Perkins Clips- Mr. Perkins is training Archie to be an Engine Driver, but Archie has alot to learn!

My son loves James, but also Flynn, Spencer and the Logging Locos. Because they're all featured, we've seen this one many, many times.",1404086400,,1086,4.7712765957446805

5469842,2,B00AQAZYVE,"This is not a movie, but a collection of tv episodes.  The description makes it sound like it is a full movie, I'm not dinging it for that.  My beef is that along with past collections, these are transferred to DVD as fullscreen instead of the original wide screen that is broadcasted on tv.  There is still places where the picture is awkward because it wasn't panned for fullscreen when the scene used widescreen for a better effect.  There are numerious places where a character is off on the side making use of the widescreen and being fully visible, but when it comes to the fullscreen crop, they get some of their face chopped off.",1367452800,,637,4.51304347826087
