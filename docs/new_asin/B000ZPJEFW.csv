8236285,5,B000ZPJEFW,"A very well done coverage of a project that is not easy to cover. Camera crew did
an excellent job with footage that is not easy to come by, especially at high
altitude and cold. Great video for the mountaineering as well as the peace efforts
between nations with conflict. It goes to show how much people are actually quite
similar if it were not for  government leaders and their agendas who create separtion between us. Well done Peace Project !!!!!  -""B""",1356739200,,458,4.573170731707317

8236287,5,B000ZPJEFW,"""I don't believe that I am here: what a present from God, to see all this,"" says one of the climbers.

This beautifully shot, well-edited, well-narrated film with its intriguing music and underlying theme of teamwork is enjoyable to watch, moving to experience, encouraging in its message.

Its message brings to mind Joanna Macy's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/World-as-Lover-World-as-Self-A-Guide-to-Living-Fully-in-Turbulent-times/dp/188837571X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">World as Lover, World as Self: A Guide to Living Fully in Turbulent times</a>, Marshall Rosenberg's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nonviolent-Communication-A-Language-of-Life-Create-Your-Life-Your-Relationships-and-Your-World-in-Harmony-with-Your-Values-Nonviolent-Communication-Guides/dp/1892005034/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life: Create Your Life, Your Relationships, and Your World in Harmony with Your Values (Nonviolent Communication Guides)</a>, and Robert Kegan's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-Over-Our-Heads-The-Mental-Demands-of-Modern-Life/dp/0674445880/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In Over Our Heads: The Mental Demands of Modern Life</a>.

For the climber, the traveler, the student of religion, politics, history, film or ecology on your list, this is a wonderful present, to be enjoyed many times.",1196380800,3,1462,9.579710144927537
8236288,5,B000ZPJEFW,"From my home in Maryland,  I followed the planning and the setbacks of this trip, long before it  became a reality.  To see this finally come  full circle is truly amazing.

I watched the computer monitor everyday during the weeks to see and follow the progress, thanks to Lance's skill as a writer.

This film brings to me the reality of this Peace Project.  I now can watch and drink in the beauty of the mountain and more important, the beauty of the people involved.

Each climber became a real friend to me after seeing this film.

I so pray that Sele  comes back to full health,  with his frost bite.

Thank you Lance for your insight,  to dream  very large,  and to follow, that dream to its beautiful conclusion.

 The skill and bravery of the  Sherpa  brings new meaning to doing the impossible.

I hope the sale of the video is as successful as the climb.  I hope this film is shown everywhere to educate as many as possible.

Thanks to everyone for bringing  me this knowledge.

8236289,4,B000ZPJEFW,"Heard about this film from a friend of mine so bought it because of his recommendation and also curiosity to see a different kind of Everest movie.  Wonderful film footage, beautiful music but more importantly, a thought-provoking message. Makes you think about both the men and women on the climb, their reasons for participating in a message for peace, but also the filmmaker.  Can't help but think about what you want your own life to mean.  on more superficial note - cool that Orlando narrates - a great voice.",1196208000,4,515,4.764044943820225
