8047915,5,B0007L7ISO,"The ""Perry Mason"" novels were a form of mystery stories where the lawyer is the detective and the solution occurs in a courtroom. A real life court trial is not as dramatic as in fiction. Erle Stanley Gardner often educated his readers with new technology or medical-legal facts, and warned of swindles. The TV shows were simplified and modified versions from the originals, or new stories. Some may criticize the tactics of Perry Mason but they represent life before the modern legal rules of the 1960s. The prices, automobiles, and monetary figures date these stories. They record the styles and culture of the 1960s. The many character actors who look like ordinary people enrich these stories, their emotions are often read from their facial expressions.

""The Case of the Reluctant Model"" begins with a Buick driving near the dock for a yacht. A small group is aboard. Did a man take his wife's painting? Is there a conflict? ""Have fun."" Is that Gauguin painting a fake? Is saying so slander? Miss Leslie Rankin goes to see painter Gilbert and Maxine Lindsay. Collin Durant tells her the truth. Miss Rankin goes to see Perry Mason about a suit. The experts say the picture is genuine. Perry explains why the buyer not the seller should bring suit. Durant denies he questioned the authenticity. Is there a trick here? Perry and Della visit Lindsay's rooms and find a surprise! The police are called. Perry agrees to defend Maxine Lindsay against the murder charge. He visits painter Gilbert to learn more. The witnesses testify in court. The objection tells the difference between eyewitness testimony and a conclusion. Can you identify a person by her coat and suitcase when you didn't see her face? A man at the bus station tells what he found. Perry questions a witness about the Gauguin painting. Perry also notices something about the bus station locker. ""It's a copy."" How many copies? Questioning brings out more facts and conflicts. This story ends on a yacht when a confession frees Perry's client. The last scene ties up the loose ends.
I remember the book as being a better story since the film omits details because of the time limit.

""The Case of the Gambling Lady"" begins at the Sierra Tahoe Club. A taxi brings a young woman to this gambling casino with a large crowd scene.

""Ned Beaumont"" is a character in Dashiell Hammett's ""The Glass Key"". This story is quite complex for a TV episode and deals with professional gamblers.",1247097600,,3484,4.795341098169717
