3736284,4,B001OSC4BK,".........but the poor man wouldn't accept the shy man's heart."" [this parable-like utterance is the lead-in to a love scene you won't want to miss]

((Here is my approach to obtaining/viewing/reviewing Gay tales in film form.  Simply, it's seeking the holy grail of that genre, or looking for the ""Addictive Film""---that movie one returns to time and again).  Selection/purchase is based mainly on finding new releases by favorite directors/screenwriters and/or your comments/reviews at major online film sales or review sites.  Sometimes I feel correctly steered by you (the ""Keepers"" filling my DVD shelves), other times mislead, occasionally badly (the ""Throwaways""----and I do toss 'em).  Rarely, I come across the ""Addictive,"" those watchable every couple of months or so (see below starred *** area for a list......and some ""near-addictive"" as well).  For some movies, I'll share a review with you, as follows.  Thanks for sticking with me so far.))

Opposites in life, they meet, they fight, they fall tumultuously in love (well, not so easily as all that). One of them (Jae-Min) is the wealthy and well educated son of a big industrialist........the other (Su-Min) is the lead we follow in this tale.  He's a just-in-from-the-country, young man (and an orphan) who is wise from life's hard knocks (yeah, yeah, it's cliched.....but how do you avoid that in these sorts of films). From the beginning, our unhappy, has-it-all-in-life second lead (who's engaged and on the verge of marriage) falls hard.  And it's through his persistent pursuit that lead character, Su-Min, finally overcomes his reluctance involving the several differences between them and accepts the reality of their love. What follows is one of gay filmdom's better love scenes. As one might expect, all that comes along is not smooth sailing. Through misunderstandings, both lovers pass the very brink of near-death, itself, before a resolution is reached.

PS--I should point out that the original Korean DVD release (Region 3) contained very, very poorly done translation to English subtitling. One can only hope that ""Liberation Entertainment's"" release, shown here on Amazon.com, will have made more correct translations.

3736287,5,B001OSC4BK,"I love a love story.  Here you have a handsome, but poor young man, who is, out of necessity, sort of pushed into a profession that he dislikes.  He later admits to a colleague that he  does sex with other men for the money.  He is later persued by a client that he despises, (unrequited love).  I guess if the sex is good and the persuit is persistent, the reluctant one can eventually be persuaded to return the affection that he once ignored.  These two guys are later seen as truly in love.  However, the very handsome Su-Min, later, accidentally meets  the finace if his lover, and with the help of his prostitute colleague, sets out to get revenge for what he sees as abetrayal.  This revenge is truly extraordinary and takes a dramatic twist at the end.  See for yourself.",1369180800,3,779,4.460992907801418
3736288,5,B001OSC4BK,"Instant classic and not just for gays. Pretty upsetting stuff, from overseas Korea where two guys end up having an inconceivable affair, and almost tear their lives apart in the process. Damn good drama. Some melodrama as well, of course.",1366848000,,238,4.975

3736291,4,B001OSC4BK,"This movie had the wow factor as far as I'm concerned. I laughed, cried and got angry at my television screen. I am being honest and saying that I had difficulty reading the subtitles as an English-only speaker but I adjusted quickly and it was well worth it. The story and plot were something so different from what I would normally watch yet I enjoyed it because it kept me involved and watching. Very great film.",1354320000,,415,4.473684210526316
3736292,1,B001OSC4BK,"I've been trying to think if I've ever seen a stupider and more annoying movie than this one. I'm sure I must have, but I can't remember any right now. I often disagree with other reviewers, but I can't remember another movie that got almost universally good reviews that I absolutely hated. I kept expecting it to get better, but it just kept getting worse.

Both leads, even the orphaned hustler - actually, everybody in this stupid movie - they're ALL selfish, arrogant, unattractive, manipulative people, expecting everybody else to bend under the pressure of their relentless, selfish demands - without EVER showing ANY sign of ANYTHING the least bit attractive to make such a surrender desirable.

If this were meant as a clinical study in extreme, unrelenting human dysfunctionality and co-dependence, I might have been able to stand it - just barely - but romance? PASSION? What movie did these people see? Not the one I saw. Not the mindless, petty, self-indulgent, tantrum-filled, grossly overwrought, hand-wringing, tear-jerking, IDIOTIC soap opera I just spent almost two hours with.

""Prepare to be captured and enthralled for every minute, beginning to end."" Well... I was prepared, but I was not ever, not for one second, captured (unless being held hostage counts) or enthralled, or even mildly interested. And ""Strong sexual content""? ""Nudity""? WHAT nudity? I didn't see any, unless a shirtless man smoking a cigarette merits an R rating now. What a profoundly disappointing and irritating afternoon this has been. This is the worst movie I've seen in ages, if not ever.",1353196800,2,1587,5.096153846153846
3736293,1,B001OSC4BK,"This movie has some good parts, but the disturbing ending makes it seem more like a very bad dream than any form of entertainment.

Although there was one difference that I found when visiting another website and its that there is a scene in there thats not included.  Might be because I had the english subtitle version.

3736296,4,B001OSC4BK,"I can't tell you how much i loved this touching tale of country boys who come to the city which could happen anywhere but is set in modern day Seoul. I think characters are well defined and the suspense is gripping, even on second or third viewing. Lead character is sympathetic without being sweet and his love interest is typically ruthless and cruel so they are a good match. As for secondary characters, male and female, like in Shelter, they are surprisingly well developed even when they die. It's the first gay movie from Korea so komapsumnida to all those involved.",1280880000,,573,4.683168316831683

The ending was a little twisted but I guess to each his own, especially his coworker. Overall, great film",1268524800,4,422,4.423076923076923
3736298,4,B001OSC4BK,"Overall, I liked the film although then ending left
me puzzled as to why someone could get sucked so easily into
a kidnapping and possible burial of a person, based on
the jealousy of a person's class, position, or perceived
wealth. I won't say more than that to prevent this being
a ""spoiler"", but the best part of the film is the aspect
of pursuing someone you are really attracted to, even at the
possible risk of turning someone off.  But even so, love conquers
all.",1268179200,2,470,4.465116279069767
3736299,4,B001OSC4BK,"The film No Regret is wonderful. Truly a gem. And for all those who whine about the twist toward the end, it helps if you understand Korean, Korean class hierarchies, and the notion of han. More than anything, make it through to the very touching (pun so not intended, but whatev) final scenes. It'll be rewarding.

This DVD version released by here!, unfortunately, cuts a couple scenes short. And I'll be blunt. The scenes truncated are the sex scenes, and though some might regard them purely gratuitous, the two scenes that are cut reveal much about the characters' changing relationship. I find it highly ironic that here! - seemingly a distributor primarily of gay films - of all distributors would delete the gay sex. Be proud.",1267401600,6,734,4.825396825396825
3736300,5,B001OSC4BK,"I first saw this movie in a theater here in Los Angeles. I was very impressed with the honesty of the story and acting. An inside view of Gay life in Korea. Life is life and
not all that different from country to country. The ending is very scary but all ends well.
I was very pleased when it came out on DVD. I thought it might not be released but it was.
I hope more Korean movies like this are made.

3736302,4,B001OSC4BK,"This is a movie that gets more complex and interesting as it goes along. First it seems like a nice little story about a small town boy trying to make it in the big city. Then it becomes a bit grittier for awhile, before morphing into a romantic drama about two guys from opposite sides of the tracks. But just when you think you know where it's going, it takes several dark twists and turns, and in the end leaves you with a devastatingly haunting feeling.
The main actor is excellent, not to mention incrediby handsome. The cinematography and direction are first-rate (if somewhat low-budget) and the movie is filled with indelible images. The city of Seoul is used to its best advantage, showcasing both its daytime beauty and its neon-lit, nocturnal excitement and danger. Overall, a very cool movie.",1244851200,5,804,4.75
3736303,5,B001OSC4BK,"A poor boy falls in love with a rich one ... it's a story that has been told over and over in gay films, but not as well as it is in ""No Regret"" (Huhwihaji anha) (South Korea 2006), a landmark Asian film now available (subtitled) on DVD for American audiences.

Lee Su-min is a poor 18 year old from a country orphanage, who stays with a friend in Seoul and tries to make a living, working at both a factory and as a driver for a service.  When a rich slightly older man makes a pass at him on the job, Lee Su-min overreacts and quits that job, and soon loses his factory job as well.  He goes to work for a ""host bar"" (brothel), where the rich older man finds him again, but is again told that he is not interested, but he persists.  Eventually, he becomes secure enough to realize that his suitor doesn't have all of the power, and genuinely falls in love with the man.  But the man's parents have already arranged a marriage for him, and that leaves Lee Su-min out in the cold.

This is very different than most Asian gay films I have seen, being  extremely emotional and more than a bit dark and violent.  But the director did wonders with his tiny budget, getting commendable performances from a cast of fully-developed characters, and pacing the film for maximum effect.  Rated R for rear nudity and simulated sex.  Adapted for US distribution by a subsidiary of Here! TV, so likely to be on their OnDemand schedule at some point.  DVD is in Korean with English subtitles, no extras other than a trailer and photo gallery.  Definitely worth a look, I give this one a full five stars out of five.",1244073600,18,1601,4.3355704697986575
3736304,5,B001OSC4BK,"NO REGRET (HUHWIHAJI ANHA) is an impressive film from Korea, especially in that it is the first venture for writer/director Hee-il Leesong who gives evidence of not only a his ability to create a film that examines life in Korea in a verismo style, but also knows how to cast and direct a crew of actors in a polished manner.  He is most assuredly a new artist to watch.

NO REGRET takes many chances with the story of Korean orphans growing to the age of self-sufficiency without the guidance of parents, fending out a life with the sole support of their fellow orphans.  The boys in this story come from the country with little exposure to the city life of Seoul and the tough choices that must be made to survive.  The other side of the story reflects the wealthy young men who come from homes burdened with high expectations and preordained 'lives' of inheriting the family business, marrying the right girl, continuing the level of 'sophistication' to which they were born.  NO REGRET places a member of each of these disparate groups together and the impact of opposite backgrounds is the thread that weaves so well through this love story.

Lee Su-min (the remarkably gifted newcomer Young-hoon Lee) is the orphan who works at menial jobs until he finds a source of good money as a rent boy in a company called XLarge.  Su-min adapts well as he is apparently comfortable with his sexuality: his fellow ex-orphans who work at XLarge present the gamut of types that find prostitution monetarily if not emotionally rewarding.  At a chance encounter Su-Min meets Song Jae-min (Nam-gil Kim) and while the attraction is one sided at first, Jae-min is bound by family expectations to marry and take over the family business and has not come to grips with his sexuality.  Fear and  recognition of class differences keeps Su-min from responding to the near stalking Jae-min, but eventually the attraction blossoms and differences seem to disappear.  The two young men have found love, but Jae-min must cope with the expectations of his family - the results being devastating to both men in different ways.  How the relationship works through this rocky road is the essence of the film and to discuss the ending would be to destroy the impact of the film.

Every aspect of this film - writing, directing, acting, lighting, music, editing - is first rate.  No one who sees this film will be able to escape the impact of the characterization by Young-hoon Lee: his screen presence is magnetic and his range of acting is solid.  He definitely is a rising star.  As for writer/director Hee-il Leesong, here is a man who not only knows the art of story telling but also the sensitive insight as to the parameters of both economy and exposition when each element of the story calls.  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, 09",1242172800,11,2810,4.758762886597938

8331440,5,B001OSC4BK,"I should have seen this one ages ago, but like all good things it is well worth the wait. Su-Min is an orphan and as such at the lower end of Korean society's pecking order. He has a job at a factory, but also moonlights as a driver whilst trying to better himself by going to night school. Then he meets a young executive, whom he drives home. This man turns out to be the boss's son at the factory and he makes it quite clear he is interested in more than production quotas. This is Jae-Min - and he is engaged to be married to a woman too just to really muddy the waters.

Well Su-Min decides to make it on his own in another way, but breaks are hard to come by so in desperation he gets a job at Karaoke Bar `X-Large'. This is where you can ruin your favourite pop song with mistuned caterwauling after too much booze and then `get it on' with the young hosts. Problem is Jae-Min just does not know when to give up and things are only ever going to come to a head - and seriously no pun intended.

This is just a barnstormingly good film. The plot is fresh and original, the acting was all great, there was a fair amount of simulated sex, but it was all in context so perfectly well placed. It sweeps the full gamut of emotions and will have you teetering on the edge of your seat till the final frame. The sub titles are good and even with a run time of 112 minutes it just seemed to fly by.

I liked how they developed each of the main characters before getting them together. The last act is one of those bizarre Asian traditions of throwing something from left field into the mix and leaving the viewer scratching their heads. This is based on many many movies and series I've watched where I just roll my eyes and think, Why?, as we reach the final act. I've rewatched it and understand where it came from but still think they could have resolved the story more believably.
