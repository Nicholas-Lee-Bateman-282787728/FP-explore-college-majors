After finishing the film, I genuinely questioned whether or not the creators actually intended to create a serious work. Of course, a quick Google search has confirmed that the creators genuinely intended to create a good film. This fact makes C Me Dance all the funnier.

Despite my one-star rating, I do highly recommend that you buy this film. (I'd like to see Greg Robbins make enough money to create another one of these masterpieces.) Watch C Me Dance with a group of friends and laugh out loud at one ridiculous situation after another.

[If you don't believe that this film is as bad as I say, look online for the trailer. It's epic.]",1258329600,15,724,4.6484375

8353725,5,B0026XUOD2,"If you believe in good and evil than you will enjoy this movie as in ""script only"" God uses a young girl Sherri ( Christina Demarco) after she learns that she has leukemia to leads others to him. She is given a great talent for being able to touch others and once they are touched they witness the crucifixtion of Christ. Sherri`s only desire is to make it big in ballet and only by viewing this movie will you find out just how the devil comes after someone that is standing up for Jesus. I first saw Christina in Creations Creatures when she was hosting the show, I didn't think this film would be that good but it turned out to be excellent in my opinion, others might not think so but as for my wife and I we give it a five star rating, Thumbs up all the way...",1382140800,,765,4.1066666666666665

8353727,3,B0026XUOD2,"This movie left me scratching my head in a few places. Was that because I lacked the smarts to unravel the complexities or was it simply a case of flaky scenes?  I realize the mystical elements will offend some, but will attract others but this movie perhaps wandered a little over the double yellow line. There is precedent for the Holy Spirit falling on people during times of revival. However I have never seen Biblical precedent for ridding a person or place of Satan without invoking the name of Jesus Christ. A simple ""Get Out"" by a pastor is not going to accomplish the task. I like what this movie was attempting to accomplish - not sure they got r done.",1358553600,,662,4.471074380165289
8353728,1,B0026XUOD2,"""C Me Dance"" is a low budget movie that tries to tackle big subjects, terminal illness and religion. The first few scenes had me laughing at the awful acting and its technical flaws. This seemded to improve somewhat after a while, but it was still bad. The story involves a teenage girl, Sheri, and her father Vince, a widower. Sheri is diagnosed with leukemia. After  a while she discovers a new ability to convert people to her faith, simply by staring at them, it seems. Realizing this is God's plan for her, she decides to use her ability during the limited time she's got left to live.

The film takes religion very seriously and Sheri gets a chance to preach to the audience. I'm not sure, however how most Christians would react to the movie, as Sheri's ability to convert people seem to be based more on some kind of hypnosis than on actually convincing people. The acting and production values are awful and the story impossible to take seriously, but ""C Me Dance"" certainly does provide some ""so bad it's good"" kind of entertainment. If that's what you're looking for, give it a chance, otherwise, stay away.",1320192000,3,1118,4.641414141414141
8353729,3,B0026XUOD2,"Let's face it, this movie is no ""Fireproof.""  In the beginning I almost wrote it off as some type of teen-drama that was borderline annoying due to the corny teen acting.  Then, as with characters in this movie, I found my attitude towards it transforming as the true message of this movie was slowly revealed along with a very convincing devil.

With God everything is possible, including the conquering of evil and the removal of fears.

So if you find yourself doubtful or fearful that the message in this movie is anything but divinely conceived, remember that evil feeds on our doubts and fears, causing us to renounce the actual blessings of God.  What we think we know of God only scratches the surface.

As a child I once believed that the wind was God blowing the dust off my face and the rain was God's tears cleansing the world.  I'd misplaced that belief somewhere along the path of life until I walked out of a hospital after a stay from a life threatening illness and felt God's breath and tears again.  The near death experience reawakened me to the many mysteries of God. I believe that this movie uses death and the threat of death in the same way, to reawaken our awareness of God's many mysteries.

8353730,4,B0026XUOD2,"Hi,
As far as I can recall this movie portrays the most realistic viewpoint of the daily, weekly, battle we all face.  I'm sure most people know around the world that evil is real.  Evil influences our culture quite a bit, and their is the opposite Love and Holiness.  That sure appear to be polarizing in our cultures.  This Movie seems to be one of the best representations of this battle in and through life and death.  A have to admit it helped me be a better warrior of love and power.

I have stumbled and am stunned to have found that God is tangibly real. :)  If you want to see a skeptics video documentary of finding the realness of God by filming throughout the world.  Check out Filming God, and the Finger of God  filmed by Darren Wilson.  Entertaining to say the least.",1306368000,5,783,4.337931034482758
8353731,5,B0026XUOD2,"This film moved me in a way no other has EVER moved me.  I cried!  I am not one to get emotional in films but this was......Wow!  I NEVER buy dvd's but I have to have this movie.  If you love God and you know that spiritual warfare exists, this movie will mean so much to you.  It has corny parts, yes, but the movie has such a powerful message that any corny parts seem petty to worry about.  I love how the movie gives the message in a way that would be WONDERFUL to educate a teenager on having full faith in Christ, letting God take control of your life, being selfless and fighting against the real enemy that Satan is.  Wow, she gave up all her desires in a selfless yet devoted way so that God could use her in beautiful ways on her last days.  Amazing movie!!!!!!!  I highly recommend this for teens.  It definitely has some scary parts when Satan enters the picture, but let's be realistic, you can't and shouldn't candy coat Satan.  This movie shows it like it is and has so much truth in it.  As frightening as the Satan parts might be to some, the movie teaches you and shows you how God has your back all the time.  Fear not, God will protect you from Satan if you let him. :)",1271462400,2,1189,4.1173913043478265
8353732,5,B0026XUOD2,"As a Christian who is extremely careful and choosy in what I watch, I highly recommend the movie, C Me Dance.

This powerful, tear-jerking movie was creatively written and has an engaging storyline that captured both my heart and my attention.

I very much appreciated how C Me Dance depicted real life (in the real world - with its real problems), with what I believe to be a spiritually balanced and Biblically accurate depiction.

This movie, although encouraging with its strong Christian theme, does not deny the reality that we live in a difficult world with dark, spiritual forces, whose purpose is to scare us into passivity. However, by the end of the movie, I was greatly encouraged and inspired to fight fear and passivity.

I must admit that, because it contains scenes that may be frightening, I was extremely afraid it would feed my, already present, fear. I was quite surprised, however, when I realized that C Me Dance was the tool that God desired to use to help me to face my fear and receive the much needed freedom from that specific fear!

I also was very touched by C Me Dance's powerful and dramatic scenes of transformation. Some scenes tugged at my heart, while others drew me closer to God as I watched the characters have a change of heart.

Of course, not all the scenes are intense. As someone who loves the beautiful art of dance, I also enjoyed the dancing scenes, and appreciated the talent flowing through the dancers. In addition, there are some other scenes that are just plain enjoyable to watch.

C Me Dance is a light that shines in the darkness. It touched my heart, and it left me emotionally and spiritually ready to receive God's touch for me personally...which I think is a great quality in a movie!",1264636800,3,1742,4.6547231270358305
