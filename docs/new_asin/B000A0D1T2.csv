Disc 2 is a profile of Camilla and rumored medial enhancements, her charity work and their relationship. Disc 3 is about Prince William (he would be King William V, his schooling and that he had met Kate (they will break up and reunite). Disc 4 is about 'Bad Boy' harry who is emotional and makes bad decisions, though he is a good athlete. Insightful.",1506211200,,520,4.6521739130434785
8071205,5,B000A0D1T2,"This 4 dvd set covers: Prince William, Harry, Charles, & Camilla-a bit of Kate. Keep in mind this set is dated to when William & Kate were still students in St. Andrews-hence the price. However don't let that hold you back. Yes, It has some thing we have seen before on the news & other documentaries: Diane-her drama & death. It also show the queen, Harry, William, @ a dedication for a fountain to the late Diana. The queen's speech is actually thoughtful. I didn't even know there was a fountain dedicated to Di after her passing. Anyway it my way of saying don't pass up this box set. Great buy!",1371254400,,599,4.405405405405405
8071206,4,B000A0D1T2,"For anyone interested in the British Royal Family, this is a must-have item! There's a documentary about Prince Harry that I particularly enjoyed, simply because there are few documentaries about Princes William & Harry and most of the ones that do exist are focused primarily on William. The documentary included titled ""Prisoners of Celebrity"" about Princes William & Harry was very enjoyable as well. The documentaries about Camilla (one of them is also about Prince Charles) were filmed either just prior to or directly following the wedding - ALL of the documentaries were made in 2005, so they're DEFINITELY a little outdated - so it's not what you'd expect but still worth watching in my opinion.

The only reason I gave 4 stars rather than 5 is that the bonus features are all the same and they aren't very extensive. The fact that the documentaries are about 5 years old took away from my personal enjoyment ever so slightly, but that has NOTHING to do with their quality, and I think they were well-made and I find myself enjoying them rather frequently! Worth watching more than once if you're a true fan/enthusiast, and personally I found the price fair & worth it.

Overall, a great buy!",1281312000,2,1200,4.820388349514563
8071207,3,B000A0D1T2,"Repetitious and ultimately boring (perhpas just like the royal family itself).

Press interviews with the press.

Very few words from the royals themselves.

Same film footage shown over and over again.",1179705600,3,202,5.451612903225806
8071208,5,B000A0D1T2,"Wonderful DVD set of the Royals. This set gives you the low-down, the dirt, but is well done. Wonderful footage and interviews by some valid sources. Worth every penny!",1169337600,4,168,4.827586206896552
