7827086,4,6302523826,"This video is symbollic and surrealistic, to match the music that Enigma creates.  I think one must remember that the video, released in 1990, probably shot and edited during 1989, was when music videos were still young, only 5 or 6 years from the start. One must reflect, that Enigma's music is best kept as a mentally created image.  Although the artist experimented in this medium, Im sure they felt the resultant output vs. the creative input was  not worth continued effort.  I enjoyed a little window into their visual work, allthough I am happy to see they continue to produce and release beautiful musical work on a regular basis.  If I had to make a choice, I'd keep things just as they are.  Much is best left to the imagination.....Florescia, 2000",976665600,7,758,4.704545454545454
7827087,1,6302523826,"This video is only 9 minutes long. I was beyond disappointed when I received it and found that there were only two songs on it, which total a whopping NINE MINUTES. I adore Enigma and am surprised they would release  something so half -..... They could have at least sold it for [less] to make  up for the length.",966643200,29,313,4.288135593220339
