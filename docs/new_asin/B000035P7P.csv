7916589,3,B000035P7P,"The film is essentially suffers from a too ordinary story and set-pieces such as car bomb and shoot-out, but ""Sheba Baby"" will surely entertain Pam Grier fans.
Sheba Shayne, a PI in Chicago, has to fly back to her hometown after hearing that her father was threatened by the local mob.  Naturally, before she knows it, Sheba is involved in a fight against the cruel syndicate.  The rest is almost the same as her movies prior to ""Sheba,"" only difference being some twists in a rather trite story.  The most attractive part is the last chase scene on a river, and there Pam herself operates a motor boat.  It is enjoyable, but has no cutting-edge of ""Coffy.""  At least ""Sheba Baby"" is not awfully banal or impossible like ""Drum,"" in which Pam is to appear the following year.  ""Sheba""s soundtrack by Barbara Mason.  Strictly for fans of genre.",1011139200,,842,4.648648648648648
7916590,2,B000035P7P,Man I love any blaxplotation but this movie [is bad]. No action no T&A the plot is asinine the sets look like the movie was shot on someones back yard. Good for a rainy Saturday when you don't care if you fall asleep before the movie ends.,993772800,,239,4.1063829787234045
7916591,3,B000035P7P,"Let's face it, nothing much comes close to Coffey, but if you like Pam Grier, chances are you'll enjoy this one. It's a good old funky shoot out flick that we love Pam for. There's NO nudity, but she looks great in that blue wetsuit. She's a private eye out for revenge after gangsters shootup her dad and his business. Pam hits the streets 'Sheba style' getting information from low life street scum, one who runs a travelling pawn shop out of the back of his car.
The 'catfight' on the yacht is too short and frankly uninteresting. The big gun fight at the end on yachts and power boats is cool, but has one case of bad editing. Watch for a white guy with long brown hair and a mustasche wearing white pants and a blue shirt. First he gets shot in the chest and falls overboard. Thirty seconds later the same guy (uninjured and dry) is back on the boat and gets shot in the leg. Pam finishes of 'Shark' with a spear gun to the back. Pam looks great as always, but the big fro and shotgun are missing.",989193600,,1002,4.223958333333333
