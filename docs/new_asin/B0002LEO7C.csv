8028869,1,B0002LEO7C,"I ordered without really checking the description, so I was a little sad to see that there were no English subtitles because my French isn't amazing, but I got over it. That is until the package arrived TORN AND DAMAGED oh my goodness. The box was broken, and the slip cover is literally slipping out. I thought maybe it had broken on the way over but then there would be pieces of the box inside the envelope--there weren't. The disc? Lord it looks like Freddy Kruger dropped it in his trash disposal. The disc plays with no error so I guess my only complaint is the fact that I paid SEVENTEEN bucks for this when instead I should have paid 25 cents and a potato. What did I do to deserve this? It is because I'm American? If it's my karma then I must have betrayed my country in a past life. I am so sad.",1506124800,,806,4.173076923076923

8028872,1,B0002LEO7C,"Not even naturally gifted Sophie Marceau and Claude Brasseur can save
this film from crashing.

Then only good thing I find about it is the ""social character""
of Parisian teen life in the early 80s. And I thought only my school
mates were corny :). It was the same at chic Saint Germain des Prs :).
The morals of this story are awful, the storyline is at times erratic,
at others it just doesn't make any sense, but overall I
wanted to turn off the TV about 20 times before it finally ended.
""Marriage survives all difficulties"", ""men can fool around, women can
do something out of spite, but they always come back to their man"" and so on.

I agree with vyto34 on IMDB that ""Brasseur is a most unfortunate choice for the dentist ..."" in that he looks more like a gangster than a dentist & family man . Brigitte Fossey is miscast as the wife of Brasseur, she's just too
beautiful and intelligent for a man who seems to have no ability for
anything. Pnlope's sister, precocious little blonde ""Samanta"" fancying Franois Beretton is just one of the very stupid choices this film has. One of the few ""lovable"" characters is Denise Grey' Poupette (the avant-garde harp playing great-grandma (??) who has all the answers), she is just
stereotyped. Bernard Giraudeau is Lehman, stud German lyce teacher does what he
can with the cardboard plot he's given. He did the extremely funny ""Viens chez moi..."" with M. Blanc, which proves he can star a brilliant comedy and also took part in ""Ridicule"" with Fanny Ardant. I mean, some of the actors have done great movies, in spite of this one :). By the way, in one
of the most unbelievable scenes of this illogical movie, he, who is
young and fit, is being held up by 2 men until, out of nowhere, Mr.
Beretton sends the 2 thieves away and later hits the teacher on his face
without resistance. Another of the silliest scenes is the comeuppance of Mme. Beretton and her husband's lover, and then Poupette finishes it. No sight of the police, of course. Worse of all, she did nothing her beloved husband didn't agree with. But those are the bourgeoise morals: the harlot has to suffer financial loss, but the pater familias is always welcome.

 The ending is particurarly devoid of meaning, but maybe ""it wants to show how teenagers change of love like a t-shirt"".

I found this film umbearable, but have to accept it's very popular. Particularly with Americans who took French somewhere in their education. The electrical piano version of ""Dreams..."" (slow music) is particularly jarring, veering on mental idiocy, specially after being hammered on all through the film. Paris is nice, thou, but I guess no director can harm it :)!

Watching a former Bond villain like Marceau as an early teenager with blossoming sexuality is not entriely a happy experience. Teen language and high school are interesting, but the film doesn't let us focus even on those moderately interesting topics. Instead it forces us to watch  the stupid parent's fights and predictable redemption of the male figure. The only funny scene was, perhaps, the botched sex scene with Mr. Beretton and his last lover.
Maybe it's just outdated.

Overall... avoid it.",1261180800,3,3168,4.726449275362318
8028873,5,B0002LEO7C,"I saw this cinematic masterpiece with my French class, and we were amazed and utterly captivated by the lush story of French teenaged despair. We felt close to Vic, as we could identify with her trauma and her crush on Mattieu. Vic's parents seemed similar to my French class' parents, and so did Vic's school, with its social hierarchy and innocent parties. I feel that ""La Boum"" truly makes a substantial effort to bridge the cultural gap in between American teenagers and their French peers. This effort is successful in my opinion, as our class found that we were laughing with Vic, crying with her, and screaming with her at her frustrating parents. We lived through ""La Boum"" in the shoes of a completely foreign and strange girl, and found that we weren't that much different, after all. ""La Boum"" made an impact on us more than ""Goodburger"" or ""Totoro"" ever could.",1150070400,4,872,4.743421052631579
8028874,4,B0002LEO7C,"For those who grew up watching the ""American Pie"" movies, the ""La Boum"" films must seem silly, harmless and bland.  If you expect to see a lot of nudity and hear a lot of raunchy jokes, don't bother with this movie.  If you want some harmless family fun and some conversational French practice - rent or buy ""La Boum"".",1136160000,8,318,4.372881355932203
8028875,5,B0002LEO7C,"I watched both parts of ""La Boum"" for the first time when I was about 12 years old. You can imagine how surprised I was when I found this movie on this website. This movie will definitely be appreciated by those who like French language, French cinematography and Sophie Morceau. It's a great listening practice. I don't want to go into details: if you want to know what it's about - watch it. It was made in 80s, and it makes it even more interesting.",1134000000,5,452,4.329411764705882
8028876,5,B0002LEO7C,"If I were to grade this movie on how I would grade any other movie (example, plot, quality of script, etc) I would definitely not give this movie 5 stars. But however, this is such a random, hilarious movie that I had to give it 5 stars!
We recently watched this in French class a couple weeks ago. It's such a horribly cheesy, strange movie that it instantly became a classic with us and we couldn't stop laughing (One of the boys in our class stood up and clapped during the extremely cheesy method of how a boy managed to win the heart of Vic-- the main character).
It has all the good elements of a very good outrageous, over the top movie: Affairs, passion, fights, parties, and other scense that make you think, ""Wow, that is wrong.""
I recommend this movie to anyone who has a sense of humor and a tolerance for corny foreign films!
As the French say, C'est tres magnifique!",1086134400,5,880,4.371951219512195
8028877,5,B0002LEO7C,"I wasn't into foreign films, but my sister said this was a movie worth watching. After is saw ""La Boum"", I wanted to see it again, and again, and again. I am not sure how may times I watched that movie! Marceau enchants you into her french teenage world of boys, friends, and family. ""La Boum"" is and always will be my favorite movie, it is timeless!",997660800,12,350,4.2388059701492535
