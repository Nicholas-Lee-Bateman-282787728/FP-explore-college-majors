I grew up watching it and still remembered the verses/songs into adulthood (which is why I looked it up and bought it for my kids).",1486684800,,292,4.327272727272727

7883102,5,6305107823,"ALL of the NIV Kids Club videos are absolutely wonderful!  We were given the Proverbs, Colossians, and Psalms NIV Kids Club videos as a gift.  Our three oldest children--ages 5, 4, and 2--just love them.  The songs are scripture verses word for word...and the reference is even in the songs also!  It's been a true joy for my husband and I to hear the kids singing the songs all the time wherever they are.  We highly recommend them.",1008028800,2,433,4.5
