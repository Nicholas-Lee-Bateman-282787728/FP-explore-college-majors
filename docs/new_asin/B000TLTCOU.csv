2906742,4,B000TLTCOU,"I disagree with all these previous reviews. I have the Riverboat TV set and it is quite good quality. No skips, jumps or any of the other problems that the other reviews say they are having. However I'm using a good quality high end DVD player not a $100.00 low end players like most people purchase. People are having these problems while trying to play North American discs on modified Region 2 players and while trying to rip the original DVDs. I have now watched this set on 4 different Sony players, 2 Pioneer, 1 Yamaha and a Panasonic DVD unit and all the discs in the set play fine without any problems.",1196467200,20,610,4.407079646017699
2906743,1,B000TLTCOU,"It's great to see all these titles being released by Timeless Media Group, but - if they are all as badly mastered as this set - they needn't have bothered.

I agree the previous comments - skips, pixilations - particularly on Disc Two.  Timeless need to get their act together quickly - I would have thought a recall of all dodgy discs a necessary first step.",1196467200,40,360,4.4393939393939394
2906744,1,B000TLTCOU,I agree with Peter Williams. It was great to finally see some episodes of this long-forgotten series come out on DVD. BUT...the quality is apalling!!  Discs 2 and 3 are full of pixelation problems...and the episode THE BLOWUP (on disc 2) jams...then jumps 6 minutes ahead. The result...a 48 minute episode plays for about 42 minutes...missing a few vital scenes in the middle of the episode. More care in mastering (or manufacturing) is required from Timeless Media before I'll be buying any more of their DVDs.,1196380800,20,511,4.941860465116279
2906745,1,B000TLTCOU,"This series which we have all longed for to be put on to DVD has a major fault with Discs 2 & 3. The episode BLOWUP is faulty and will not play. Not enough care and attention has been paid to copying these episodes to DVD. Its not only my copy that is faulty, but people I know in the USA and in Australia are finding this DVD susbstandard with faults on this episode. They all need to be recalled and we should be supplied with episodes that play properly in our DVD players. So I advise everyone to steer clear of these DVDs until this fault has been corrected.

2906758,5,B000TLTCOU,This is an entertaining program because it reflects the life these fellows lead while working on this riverboat. It has moments that are hilarious and moments of suspense.

2906772,4,B000TLTCOU,"Don't get me wrong, if you like classic TV drama, then this set is definitely worth it.  If you like Darren McGavin, he's at his charming best as the captain of the Enterprise (not that captain, and not that Enterprise).  The stories Riverboat tells lend credence to the old saying, ""They don't make them like that any more.""  But you have to watch Riverboat in a quiet room where there are no kids running around, no dogs barking, and no air conditioners running because the sound quality just stinks.  These shows have not been remastered in any way, and the prints look ever year their age.  Too bad.  A show of this quality really deserves better treatment than it gets here.  I can only imagine how great Elmer Bernstein's score would sound if Riverboat could be restored.  But don't let the missing star deter you from buying Riverboat. My wife and I are really enjoying these shows, in a nice quiet room.",1409788800,10,911,4.580246913580247

2906776,5,B000TLTCOU,"I grew up watching this show when I was 7 or 8. Always a great story with many famous guest stars and the fantastic Darren McGavin.  Burt Reynolds was in the first season (very young). Noah Beery(Rockford Files) joined the series later as the riverboat Enterprise(before Star Trek) plowed the the waters of the Mississippi, Missouri, and Ohio rivers. The whole set is in bold black & white.
With stories based on historical events in some cases. A thrilling joy to view the West in the 1840s from this perspective. Every DVD works perfectly with great sound and picture.",1392163200,11,570,4.757575757575758
2906777,5,B000TLTCOU,These remastered episodes are great!  It's fun seeing all the episodes in one place.  Timeless Media Group did it again!,1389225600,2,120,4.95
2906778,5,B000TLTCOU,"Each episode tought us a little more history or inspired us to think of how the Steam powered vessel changed our
country. Steam motive power was the rapid transit of its day. Burt Reynolds acting is very good, and Darren McGavin
was the perfect Steam Boat captain. Nothing slow or boring about the Riverboat Series.",1387843200,2,315,4.745454545454545
2906779,4,B000TLTCOU,"No trouble with the DVDs.  The series is generally entertaining, but it seems the writers experienced mood swings.  The Burt Reynolds character, for example, starts out as being ultra-cool, like a Steve McQueen, but then all of a sudden is a merry, high-school-ish prankster.  The captain, Darren McGaven, is a rock of morality and duty, but then as the series evolves he becomes a leering lecher, slobbering after the pretty girls.

I think they were casting about in an effort to improve ratings during the short life of the series.

But, overall, a well-produced, entertaining series, well worth the price.",1383782400,7,609,5.05
2906780,5,B000TLTCOU,I have really enjoyed viewing this feature! I was very intrigued by this show growing up and now I am enjoying it more as an adult!,1383004800,,131,4.076923076923077

2906784,3,B000TLTCOU,"Revue Productions back in the 1950s specialized in such series, several of which are available on DVD - ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents,"" Rod Cameron's ""State Trooper"" and ""Coronado 9"" and ""Soldiers of Fortune."" Filmed mostly at the former Republic Studios and Universal Pictures back lots, ""Riverboat"" stars Darren McGavin and Burt Reynolds. Utilizing a riverboat on the latter studio's waterways, exterior filming was very restricted giving the show a stage-bound effect. Miniatures with faked foregrounds and cyclorama backgrounds are used ad-nauseum for river travel scenes. The stories feature guest stars - era names familiar in both TV and movies - lots of contract players. ""Wagon Train"" with its ""(Character-of-the-week Story"" titles theme used by Universal of the same era. I give it an okay rating because one finds an engrossing episode occasionally after suffering through thoroughly miserable ones. Most of the suffering is due the flat dull ""humorous"" ones and to McGavin's at-the-top-of-his lungs performances as riverboat captain Gray Holden. That is when he is actually featured in the series. The prolonged absences are due to McGavin also starring as ""Mike Hammer"" in another Revue syndicated series filmed at the same time. During McGavin's absences Reynolds gets to play second fiddle to whichever guest star is on hand. Had I actually seen this series back in the day, it would not have enticed me into another look. McGavin as a similar hurry here and there, fast-talking character as ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"" was much more enjoyable and recommended for the late actor's fans.",1372204800,7,1599,5.349206349206349

2906794,3,B000TLTCOU,"I like it because I like McGavin and the whole Western genre, but its really a run of the mill adventure series where most episodes follow the same path: a crisis on one of the Riverboats trips up or down the Mississippi. And sometimes the action is so relentless that there's little time for drama or character development. Anyway, it desrves its place alongside Bronco, Cheyenne and the like.",1347408000,6,394,4.72463768115942

2906796,5,B000TLTCOU,"I was nine or ten years old when this TV series aired, and have been fascinated by Mississippi riverboats ever since! The series has very good production values for the period with ""established"" guest stars appearing in every episode.

After viewing the entire set of discs I find that, except for a few seconds of blurry closing shots on two episodes, the video quality is very good as is the sound. Too bad the series was not shot in color, but it is still well worth the price. It is a different kind of western to be sure. Nice packaging.

Now where can I get a scale model of the Enterprise?",1346198400,5,596,4.36036036036036

2906800,5,B000TLTCOU,"If you are purchasing Riverboat despite having never seen the program you will not be disappointed.

This was a very well produced, gripping Western series with excellent production values and terrific writing to match a top-notch cast. Some of the guest stars not mentioned above that you will see are a young and alluring Elizabeth Montgomery, the dashing Ricardo Montalban (look for a quick glimpse of Mary Tyler Moore as an extra), a guy from another ship called ""Enterprise"" - DeForest Kelley, Charles Bronson, Suzanne Pleshette and a familiarly scruffy-looking Buddy Ebsen (playing the role that might well have landed him the spot of the Beverly Hillbillies Jed Clampett) in ""The Waters of Gorgeous Springs"".

You will enjoy Burt Reynolds in his first TV role too - he manages to hang around for 21 episodes (before he goes overboard) and its too bad that he leaves the show. At this writing before the DVD release date I have not seen all the episodes, just a few I collected on original distribution reels but most were in the first 20 episodes and all thoroughly satisfying. There is a line of continuity - at least in the episodes with Reynolds and you will want to watch them in the correct order. There are a couple of episodes where Darren McGavin is missing from the cast - and that unfortunately leaves a void that Noah Berry Jr. cant really fill but the omission is brief and McGavin's brilliant performances carry Riverboat all the way to its final stop.

A fine show of the period, this truly deserved to be released in its entirety and I will be purchasing Riverboat: The Complete Series to finally see all the episodes!!",1335484800,55,1641,4.750877192982456

This is a great classic tv series that more people should have seen.

in a few episode when he was replaced. The show is well written and acted
by many of the familiar actos at the time. If you like old tv you'll like this.",1333843200,,366,4.027397260273973

This is a refreshing take on the western set on a riverboat. The series is action-packed and has a lot of guest stars past and future. There were 44 episodes made but only 15 are on this dvd. But each one is a gem.
A big thank you goes to Timeless Media Group who are releasing quite a few old TV shows of this kind  and from this era.

2906806,4,B000TLTCOU,"Just started watching this 15-episode 'best of' complilation, and I must say, this series is pretty darn good, sorta like ""Wagon Train' on the river, but set in an earlier time period of the early 1840s and St. Louis was as far west as you could go at the time. Darren McGavin is in fine form as the Captain of The Enterprise, Grey Holden, and Burt Reynolds is pretty good as his pilot Ben Frazier until he was given the pink slip in midseason for not getting along with McGavin. Why for reasons unbeknownst to me, Darren was not seen at all in the episode ""Fort Epitath"", but Dan Duryea filled in for him. Too bad ""Riverboat"" didn't stay around for a longer run than those 44 episodes, 31 in the first season, and just 13 in season two before getting the midseason axe by NBC, but let's see Timeless and NBC Universal bring out a complete series collection of this fine show!",1299628800,6,876,4.380368098159509

When I recently discovered that some of the episodes were now in a DVD series, I purchased it immediately. I did read the reviews on Amazon first. Most of the complaints where about poor video quality, but the complaints were about the earlier copies. On mention of some with good quality, I decided to chance it.

What a letdown! And I'm not talking about the video quality; that was fine. It was the episode selections that stunned me! I well remember that there were a number of humourous episodes in this series. I don't know who selected the episodes for this DVD series, but that person must have the nickname of ""Gloomy Gus"". There's not one of the humourous episodes in this. Not one! Oh, there's a little light-hearted banter between McGavin and Reynolds. But apart from that, this series should never have been released. It should not come as a surprise that I have put this up for re-sale. There's just no way I would have this in a permanent collection.",1293580800,6,1066,4.523316062176166

I have none of the technical problems listed above, and I am playing it on a small portable DVD player that I bought for less than $100.  The picture resolution is excellent and so is the sound. I am not sure if the company remastered, but I must rate it as excellent quality.

2906811,1,B000TLTCOU,"I bought my discs in March 2008 and had the same problem everybody else did. Lots of pixelation and the second episode on the second disc (""Blow Up"") stops half-way through. Timeless Media should be ashamed of themselves.

The quality of the show itself is fine. The source film prints are quite clear, the plots are adequate, and the acting is 1st rate. The show holds up quite well after all these years.",1205020800,42,406,4.561643835616438
2906812,3,B000TLTCOU,"The 44 hour long episodes (all in B&W) of the adventure series ""Riverboat"" ran from 1959- 1961 on NBC. If you wanted to see a lot of boats in those days your choices were ""Tugboat Annie"" and ""Riverboat"".

Set in the 1840's, the title character is ""The Enterprise"" (a pre-Star Trek version), a 100-foot paddle wheel steamer on the Mississippi River. The Captain is Grey Holden (Darren McGavin) who won the boat in a poker game. Bert Reynolds, fresh off the Florida State University football team, plays the ship's pilot Ben Frazier. Apparently their work together on this series made McGavin and Reynolds lifelong enemies and poor Burt was replaced by Noah Berry (Rockford's dad and Davy Crockett's sidekick) after the first season.

The 15 episodes on this DVD release (which is viewable but not of great quality-but neither was TV reception for many families back then) are a mix of the two seasons and have some notable guest stars. Each episode's title, original air-date, summary, and notable guest star(s) are detailed below.

Season #1

A Race to Cincinnati: 4 October 1959 Three ruthless men try to block the Enterprise's path so a farmer's crop of peaches will spoil and he won't be able to make the last payment on a valuable plot of land (Anne Baxter). The Unwilling: 11 October 1959 Even though Dan Simpson (Eddie Albert) lost his last cargo, he refuses to give up his dream of building a general store in the West. The river pirates that made $20,000 stealing his merchandise the first time are planning to stage another robbery, in spite of Ben Frazer's precautions (Debra Paget). The Fight Back: 18 October 1959 Seeking cargo for his riverboat, Captain Holden docks in the town of Hampton and discovers that Fowler, the town boss, won't allow the farmers to ship their crops. Desperate for work, Holden agrees to host the wedding of a local townsman. When Fowler's brother dies trying to kill the groom, the boss leads a lynch mob against Holden and his ship John Ireland, Joan O'Brien). Escape to Memphis: 25 October 1959 A woman (Jeanne Crain) kills her brutal husband (Claude Akins) in self-defense and flees her plantation, with the husband's ne'er- do-well brother in pursuit. She takes passage on the Enterprise and meets with an unscrupulous man who has stolen a fortune from his wife and wishes an accomplice to help him evade police pursuit. Witness No EvilA Night at Trapper's Landing: 8 November 1959 The U.S. Army plans to commandeer The Enterprise to launch a punitive expedition against the Indians and avenge the loss of Lieutenant Devereaux (Ricardo Montalban) and his men. Frazer tries to convince the army brass that the local Indian agent and his men are the cause of the Indian uprising. The Boy from Pittsburgh: 29 November 1959 Holden agrees to ship a box full of valuable diamonds, not realizing a pickpocket has already switched the box with the real stones for worthless paste. Complicating matters are a beautiful widow and a young stowaway who wants to become a riverboat pilot. The Blowup: 17 January 1960 A woman (Whitney Blake) with a load of unstable, experimental, gunpowder connives to draw Holden and his men into a barroom brawl and then agrees to bail out the entire crew from jail if the captain will agree to ship her volatile cargo to her father's diamond mine. Path of the Eagle: 1 February 1960 A wealthy but inexperience party of pioneers (Dianne Foster) hire Captain Holden to transport them to Independence, Missouri, so they can join a wagon train for California. One of the group's organizers connives with river pirates to hijack the riverboat and rob the party before they can reach their destination. The Fight at New Canal: 22 February 1960 Charged with building an canal that would shorten the river voyage and avoid rapids, Captain Holden runs into murderous opposition from the freight and stagecoach line that hauls cargo and passengers along the proposed route (Jean Allison). Fort Epitaph: 7 March 1960 In the absence of Captain Holden, Captain Brad Turner takes a cargo of military supplies to an outpost on the Little Missouri River - in the middle of Sioux country and must use the cannon he is delivering to disperse an Indian attack. He discovers the once peaceful Indians have been driven to the warpath by the actions of the fort's commander - a martinet who commandeers ""The Enterprise"" and its crew to fight the Sioux. The Quick Noose: 11 April 1960 Someone has stabbed the son of Judge Wingate in the back with Carney's knife and unless Captain Holden can find the real murderer, Carney will hang for the crime (Nan Leslie).

Season #2

The Two Faces of Grey Holden: 3 October 1960 When a pretty Cajun girl (Suzanne Pleshette) catches Captain Holden's eye, he's naturally interested in a bit of romance, until he learns that the young lady thinks he is her fiance, who was killed in a riverboat explosion over a year before. Trunk Full of Dreams: 31 October 1960 Captain Holden fishes a pair of actors out of the river and soon the Enterprise is fitting out to become a floating theater (Mary Tyler Moore).

2906813,1,B000TLTCOU,"I disagree with the guy who thinks the more expensive the DVD player the better job it will do.  And sorry fella, but some of the players $100 or less will play discs just as good.  The more expensive DVD players actually have so many added features that they sometimes will actually cause more disc problems.  I own 7 DVD players....two cost of $700.00 and I can say as one with experience that my less expensive machines have less problems with playback.  People think just because it costs more money it means it is better.  It may have better sound output or provide HDV quality.  But as for bad discs like that offered in RIVERBOAT no machine is going to play them properly.  I agree...these are poorly recorded.  Frankly it looks like someone who has copied them from VHS and were not professionally produced.  They were not digitally enhanced in any way.  They really look like copies of copies.",1200268800,18,902,4.616352201257862
2906814,2,B000TLTCOU,"I had the same experience as the previous reviewers.  The episodes skip, pixelate and the audio keeps dropping out.  It has nothing to do with the DVD player (I have a modern, expensive, state-of-the-art one), this set was just poorly mastered.  I was very disappointed considering I bought it for my father who loved this show when it first aired.",1198627200,6,348,4.766666666666667

8210077,4,B000TLTCOU,"G r e a t ! ,  old riverboat themed stories. One annoying problem is- The show is set in the early 1840 s, and they are using weapons from the 1860s and 1870s.  There were means to have as a part of the production, period weapon replicas etc.  Guess they just thought, back then, that no one would notice?  Maybe they just wanted to have cooler weapons while insisting upon the early 40s era.  Anyway the show is fun. Reminds me of The Loveboat regarding the detail in portraying the goings on in preparation and operation of the vessel.  Seeing Burt Reynolds constantly turning the wheel left and right, in a mundane and useless way, is stupid.  The story seems too boring with constant bad guy situations.",1483833600,,707,4.4765625
