Begin Again is a great film with wonderful performances, music and even some humor that never felt forced. I had a free pass to see it, but I will surely be buying the blu-ray when it comes out. Mark Ruffalo is dare I say Oscar worthy and Keira Knightly has a good voice to go along with a very nice performance here. What an unexpected and pleasant surprise.",1409356800,68,570,4.008771929824562
6562398,5,B00M7D81SQ,"Don'tcha just love movies about show business? This R-rated (language and alcohol) romantic dramedy features guerrilla concerts which last only until the cops arrive, a failed partnership which sets a frustrated music producer adrift, and enough gorgeous shots of New York City to satisfy even Woody Allen. Director John Carney (""Once"") sets his players on rooftops, in parks and alleys, under bridges and near well-known landmarks; this is an ode to the city and a tribute to the creative souls who make our music.

Here is a gentle, upbeat, unexpectedly sweet piece about the music business; we see performances in small clubs and big theaters, with music professionals who range from corporate officials to social networks gurus.

We enjoy:

  Keira Knightley (""Anna Karenina"") as a would-be songwriter/ singer dumped by her partner as his career unexpectedly takes off and she's left in his wake.
  Adam Levine (""American Horror Story"") is her dumper who succumbs to the siren song of success. How do you spell R-E-M-O-R-S-E?
  James Corden (""One Chance"") is an old friend who offers her shelter and a shoulder to cry on.
  Mark Ruffalo (""Iron Man 3"") as a has-been music producer who first alienated me until I saw the creative side of him, then he became someone I could root for.
  Catherine Keener (""Captain Phillips"") is his soon-to-be former wife, dealing with the detritus of her relationships. I LOVE the way she and her husband click into what is obviously an old habit of sharing a smoke and hiding it from their daughter.
  Hailee Steinfeld (""Ender's Game"") is the angry daughter of our recently split couple; but she gets seriously good advice from the would-be singer.
  Mos Def (as Yasiin Bey ""Life of Crime"") is the corporate official who asks our hero, ""What have you done for us lately?""
  CeeLo Green (""Sparkle"") is one of our hero's former clients who has never forgotten who helped him when he needed it the most.

Do you think our two leads might make beautiful music together? Seriously? I think I failed to mention that this is unpredictable. You'll have to see for yourself. And you'll have a clearer picture of what a gifted music producer can bring to the table.

Let me mention: No sweaty bodies, no vehicular mayhem, no guns and no blowie uppie stuff. That's probably good enough for many of you, right? It was for me: I liked it.",1409097600,6,2362,4.840399002493766
6562399,3,B00M7D81SQ,"Ruffalo always puts out quality performances (besides the insipid Avengers. Can't blame him for grabbing a big payday, though).

Liked the flick & the music, but they should have hired someone who CAN SING. Knightley has a VERY slight voice, and it certainly affects the film to a certain degree.

Still recommended for Ruffalo's performance, the song 'Lost Stars' (performed 'live' by Adam Levine, who nails it), the quality of the music (not the Knightly vocal performances, though), and some clever musical sequences.

One final note from 'The Fonz' : Keira. Fonzie here. Please eat more pasta. Mrs. C will make some for you.",1409011200,,628,5.019230769230769
6562400,5,B00M7D81SQ,"I had been eagerly awaiting this new film from John Carney.  He is known for ""Once"" which was one of my favorite movies of 2007 and there are certainly similarities to be drawn here.  In this film, Greta (Keira Knightley) has just been dumped by her longtime boyfriend, Dave (Adam Levine) who has just made it big as a rock star.  Dave, while on a gig in L. A., gets it on with his PR person.  We see this in flashback and I mention it because it is a scene to watch closely.

When Dave first returns to New York and Greta, he doesn't come clean but plays a song he had recorded.  Greta listens and we see her facial expression slowly change from anticipation to anger.  For a second, I couldn't figure it out.  Then I listened to the words in the song.  This is a great example of how Carney, who also wrote the script, takes little musical bits and pieces and creates these poignant moments in his movies.

The actual scene that opens the film is shot and shown from 3 perspectives.  In a small club in the East Village, Greta is coaxed up on the stage by an old friend she has been staying with.  We see the scene replayed from their eyes.  Then Dan (Mark Ruffalo, perfect), a drunk has-been record label founder and producer, staggers into the club.  He hears Greta sing in a quiet but lovely voice, accompanied only by her acoustic guitar.  It gets his attention.  Slowly, we see what he sees as he builds an imaginary band behind her.  We can see him arranging the music.  It's a remarkable scene, one of many.

The film also has a few expected clichs.  Dan got to his present state, because his wife left him for another man.  He moved out and rarely stayed in touch with his teen age daughter Violet (Hailee Steinfeld, playing the same character she played in ""3 Days to Kill"").  The ex-wife is nicely played by Catherine Keener.

Dan convinces Greta that she should sign with him.  She insists, she's a song writer not a performer, but with little to lose, agrees.  Since she had never cut a demo tape, Dan's partner and CEO (Mos Def) won't sign her until they make a recording.  With no money to spend, Dan and Greta decide to grab a musician from here and there and record in various locations in NYC.  Once again this organically created music process is brilliant.  And so are the songs.  If Oscar can't find a song among the batch in this movie, something is seriously wrong.  Ruffalo and Knightly have great chemistry but like ""Once"" the attraction between the couples is restrained.  This can be as agonizing to the viewer as it is portrayed by the characters.  It is remarkably effective acting.

Compared to ""Once,"" ""Begin Again"" is much slicker, uses some big stars and doesn't quite have the home grown feel that the Dublin setting did.  Having said that, this is a beautifully entertaining, well-acted film full of fresh new music.  I loved it.

BLU RAY UPDATE (2-6-15)

Director John Carney's ""Once"" was my favorite film of 2007 and as already noted, this film follows a similar theme.  After taking a second look at the movie on Blu ray, I'm even more impressed with Carney and the film.  Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo are a perfect match whose characters become close, yet they are still in love with others.  This emotional pull from 2 directions is also seen in ""Once.""  Carney doesn't give in, as most filmmakers would have.  Knightley, in particular has a couple interesting scenes.  Watch her facial expression as she first learns that her rock-star boyfriend is going to break up with her.  Again, at the end of the film when she attends Dave's concert, watch as the progression of ""her"" song (""Lost Stars"") changes as Dave sings it.

Fortunately the Blu ray disc is just as good as the film.  The digitally shot film has an almost film-like quality.  It retains the original 1.85:1 aspect ratio using a 1080p video resolution.  In a word the transfer is perfect.  The color is excellent, flesh tones are accurate, black levels are inky, the clarity and detail superb.  Even small print on various items in a room can be read.  You can see a small cut on Knightley's leg.  This is as good as it gets.  The audio is equal to the video.  The disc features a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track that enhances the excellent music as well as the dialog.  Street scenes are vibrant and perfectly captured.  The surrounds are effective and immersive.  Subtitles are available in Spanish and English SDH.  Extras include a 21 minute ""making of"" mini-doc and 4 music videos that include the lyrics.",1408320000,110,4516,4.546019900497512
6562401,5,B00M7D81SQ,Love love love. The way the characters appreciate the music and the way they're  careful to make sure that the meaning doesn't get lost in all the hype is just amazing. I wish everyone felt that way about music today.,1408320000,,217,4.425
6562402,5,B00M7D81SQ,"First time that I saw this film, I was alone. I loved it so much that I went back a second time and brought my son, He LOVED it also. I wanted my mom to see it so I saw it again with her. She LOVED IT!! Let this speak for itself!! :)",1408060800,,233,3.4150943396226414
6562403,5,B00M7D81SQ,"I expected this movie to be a romantic comedy; what it is, instead, is a movie about renewal and healing through creativity. The relationships felt real, the performances were lovely (especially Keira Knightley, who is a winning musical performer as well -- who knew?), and the music has stayed in my head ever since i saw it. Refreshing and delightful.",1407974400,,353,4.9
6562404,4,B00M7D81SQ,"I so thoroughly enjoyed this film that I had to see it twice.  I 'm a big fan of Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo.  Put them together in the same movie and it's magical.  The soundtrack is phenomenal!  I thought Adam Levine did a great job in his ""budding"" acting career.  Keira shows us she can carry a tune quite well.  ""Lost Stars"" is going to be a hit!",1407715200,,356,4.086956521739131
6562405,4,B00M7D81SQ,"""Begin Again"" (2013 release; 100 min.) brings the story of Greta (played by Keira Knightley) and Dan (played by Marc Ruffalo). As the movie opens, we find Greta reluctantly going on stage in a small bar venue to play a song, urged on by a friend. By complete coincidence Dan, a veteran of the music business, is in the audience, and loves what he's hearing. We later learn the background of how these two characters ended up in that very place, as things have not been going as planned (and I'm being mild). Dan tells her he wants to record an album with/for her. Along the way we get to know the side characters (Dan's wife and 14 yr. old daughter--both estranged from Dan), and Dave (played by Maroon 5's Adam Levine), Greta's boyfriend who has just hit the big time. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: as a general matter, unfortunately I did not ""fall"" for this movie like I did for ""Once"", writer-director John Carney's previous tale of romance and music. In fact, when it comes down to it, this movie feels a lot like a re-imagined ""Once"", set in a different city and with different leads, but in the end ""Begin Again"" is nothing more than a variation of what we've already seen. Lightning does not strike again: as sincere and moving and impossible Once was, as contrived and unoriginal and self-evident Begin Again is. There are some nice performances in the movie, none more so than Keira Knightley, who reportedly learned to play guitar from her rock-husband James Righton (of the Klaxons), and whose singing is surprisingly good. Despite my grumbling, there are several really good scenes in the movie, reason I'm giving it 3.5 stars, and which I cannot describe in more details so as not to give away anything. But then just when you've think you've seen it all, comes the REAL ending of the movie, which is revealed as the end titles roll. Wow, just wow. The irony of it all.

Even though I was afraid that I would be let down by this movie, I nevertheless went to see it right away when it opened (a good month ago) here in Cincinnati. The early evening screening where I saw this at was quite well attended, but I could tell that the sentiment of the crowd was quite divided: there were those who were clearly loving it, and other who simply were tormented/annoyed/bored. I encourage you to check out ""Begin Again"" for yourself, be it in the theatre or on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusions.",1407715200,4,2513,4.569844789356985
6562406,5,B00M7D81SQ,"There are some movies that are simple, with a great script, amazing actors and, a plus, beautiful music, and this is one of those movies. It is also great to see real singers (Adam Levine, who's voice is incredible and is a really good actor too) and actresses that we now know can sing beautifully (Keira Knightly), working together and trying new things, in such a great movie and setting. In a summer with a lot of blockbusters, which I enjoy as well, that there are still movies like this that can really show what Hollywood can still make. Definitely in my top 10 list of movies, and I am a Huge movie buff! Definitely one to watch over and over.",1407628800,119,651,4.3884297520661155
6562407,5,B00M7D81SQ,"An exciting film, uplifting, as it follows an unlikely twosome mastering adversity.  A mostly-drunk, acting-out Dan (Mark Ruffalo), whos pretty much exploded his career, hears the song and guitar of Gretta (Keira Knightley), a half-hiding performer in a dimly-lit bar.  He imagines, and its wonderfully depicted, a fantasy orchestra accompanying her. Hes got to record her. Shes on the verge of being dumped by Dave (Adam Levine), her ostensible soul mate and partner in songwriting, as he advances from performer to superstar, with all the attendant female swooning. Much of the film focuses on the exciting collaboration of Gretta and Dan as they collect diverse musicians along the way, record in subways, on rooftops, and all sorts of unheralded natural venues   NYC, en plein air sometimes fleeing just ahead of the cops or bribing kids to either stay quiet or join in.  The ambient sound becomes part of the music . Relationships, both failed and hopeful, are naturally explored, with little fanfare.  The themes of honesty, loyalty, and fairness, are taken seriously.  Resilience is modeled.  The music is superpunk meets pop.  James Cordens performance is outstanding.  James Carney does an impressive job as writer/director, as do Gregg Alexander,music; Yaron Orbach, cinematography; and Andrew Marcus, editing.  I bought it, watch it intermittently over the years, and love it.",1528848000,,1387,5.345622119815668

6562412,5,B00M7D81SQ,"I  love this movie! Just love it! It is a total feel great movie, without a hokey romance, or tearjerking drama.  Just a sweet story about people who do begin again and find their passion. Really, all the actors are terrific and I really, really enjoyed  the music--particularly a part with Mark Ruffalo imagines what a song could sound like.  New beginnings, the making of an album, recovering one's life and self  respect--it's all here and beautifully portrayed. Like others, I first rented the movie, then just bought it as I always want it available.

Complex & authentic enough without relying on quirky (my pet peeve - I detest quirky) or being overly dark. Recommended.",1523491200,,332,4.6440677966101696

6562419,2,B00M7D81SQ,"This isn't the movie it could've been. Not even close. It feel like a movie made in a corporate focus group, then it tossed out most of the good ideas.

Keira Knightly and Mark Ruffalo star, and they do their best to make a weak, unedited script better than it is. So much is cliche.

The music is common folk pop -- they are the kinds of songs you hear on the radio but never feel bothered to listen to.

The personalities are generic hipster. Adam Levine' character, Dave Kohl, seems like he is playing hipster dress-up, complete the requisite beard.

The beginning is confusing as it hops around the timeline too much. Instead kicking back and enjoying the flick, I found myself trying to figure out what was going on.

Loads of F-bombs, and not sex or violence, make this rated R.

The gist of the story: Knightly plays a singer-songwriter who just was dumped by her boyfriend (Kohl). He's a narcissistic jerk who goes off with another woman. Meanwhile, Ruffalo plays a has-been music producer who lost his mojo when his wife met a guy. Ruffalo hears Knightly sing in a bar, he offers to produce her, and off they go. The plot is predictable, but, had the movie made more sense, it might've worked.

This could've been a fun movie along the lines of ""That Thing You Do"" or ""Music and Lyrics."" It gets lost in bad direction, mostly, and is only tolerable because of Knightly and Ruffalo.

Don't bother.

A beautiful gem of a movie with deep smart characters, excellent rich script full of heart and meaning, and redemption. The music was so heartfelt and melodic, and Kiera Knightly absolutely shines. Not just a sparkling beauty, not just a talented actress, but a special lovely singer! Everyone in this movie was so real and perfect. I was happy to see one of my favorite actresses the beautiful Catherine Keener in a too small but lovely role.
Again, this movie was one of the best redemption, healing movies ever  with a strong female character finding her creative powers.  And another movie to add to my list of love stories to New York City.",1490227200,,825,4.5675675675675675

6562492,5,B00M7D81SQ,"Such an honest and emotional story... about music, songwriters, relationships that inspire, and the changing industry of music.

Mark Ruffalo (Dan) and Keira Knightley (Greta) have some awesome chemistry as has-been music-biz exec and singer/songwriter who team up to make her album despite no funds or interest from his former record label.  What they do have is her heartfelt talent, hot looks, and his massively inspiring vision of what she can be.  Despite sharing a broken heart, they use all that energy over one summer in New York City to create magic and bring people together.  So well-done. Says so much about the corruptive nature of fame and greed and what it does to the integrity of music. It's got all the honesty and realism I want from a plot and characters... with just enough cheese and romance to take the edge off reality and leave you feeling good. It's one you'll want to own and watch more than once.

A couple of truly authentic musical perks here that really brought the story to life are Adam Levine (Dave) as Greta's rising rock star boyfriend and the beautiful song she writes and gives him called ""Lost Stars.""  That is a genuine hit and made its way into a permanent spot on my personal playlists.  Love it!  All of the music here is pretty good but ""Lost Stars"" just makes the movie and gives us a very moving ending.

I have enjoyed other music-themed films by this director (John Carney)-- Once and Sing Street, but this one is truly unforgettable.  Though I have to add being greatly disappointed that Carney chose to badmouth his experience with Keira Knightley bigtime in public interviews ('I'll never make a film with supermodels again.') for her stardom and lack of musical talent (or whatever else)... very rude and unprofessional (even if he later apologized).  And weird considering she brought so much sweetness and emotion and humanity to a film I wouldn't have known existed if these superstars hadn't given their time to it.  All of the actors here were wonderful and believable in their roles.",1481328000,,2041,4.8

6562495,4,B00M7D81SQ,"I watched this because I love Mark Ruffalo and Kiera Knightley. Please be aware that it's not a traditional warm and fuzzy love story, but rather a reflection on the realities of love... Sometimes you get a second chance with the person you love, and other times you just have to start over with the prospect of meeting someone new. What I liked about this movie is that it examined the definition of ""art"" in the music industry. What is art? Is it music that stays true to the artist, or music that becomes what the crowd loves? Or is it both? Anyway, the one thing I didn't like was all the swearing. I realize that this has become a fact of life in most Hollywood movies, but I guess for me too many swear words starts to detract from the depth of emotion and intellectual flow of a film, and the movie starts to become just about the audial stimulation of swear words. I wish that Hollywood script writers would either wean themselves away from profanity or just cut it cold turkey - and explore what kinds of dialogues could happen when people are not constantly just flinging the ""F"" word back and forth at each other, like a monotonous verbal tennis match.",1480982400,4,1163,4.4392523364485985

6562497,5,B00M7D81SQ,"""Begin Again""  is a songwriter's story with Adam Levin performing the beautiful 'Lost Stars' written by D. Brisebols, G. Alexander, N. Lashley and N. Southwood.  Keira Knightley plays a sassy beautiful songwriter in New York for a few weeks when Mark
Ruffalo, playing a down and out record producer, approaches her after she's finished singing one of her songs in a dark dingy club. Ruffalo wants to put the sassy songwriter in the studio. The movie carries you along with beautiful songs, through the record producer's marriage problems, his troubled teenage daughter and the songwriter's broken relationship with Adam Levine's character. In other words...life goes on when you're chasing dreams. Everything ties up neatly in the end with a surprise twist. You must see this film. The music makes you sing continuing to echo in your head and the story feels very real and is entertaining.",1480896000,4,889,5.082191780821918

I had not really paid enough attention to the actor Marc Ruffalo before seeing this movie, but it is in my judgement his best work to date. He is simply terrific. The British comedian James Corden was really just coming on the scene when this movie was made, and again, the part was made for him. Keira Knightley ties the cast together, but I was especially pleased to watch and hear Adam Levine, who's music I have always loved, but had never seen in a movie before.
This movie is full of great music, and is fundamentally about love and friendship.  We watch as one couple comes back together, as a daughter and father rediscover their love and appreciation for each other, and as another couple falls apart, but leaving us interested in what will happen, especially to Knightley's character, in the future.  The movie is beautifully crafted and a joy to watch.

6562526,3,B00M7D81SQ,"[Minor Spoilers] Maybe it's because I've seen Mark Ruffalo in ""You Can Count on Me"" (which I gave 5 stars) and couldn't help but compare and contrast, but ""Begin Again,"" although pleasant enough in depicting a fine collaboration of music and relationships, isn't up on that same level and rarely rises above the norm.  Keira Knightly is slightly miscast but still moderately engaging as songwriter ""Gretta;"" real-life singer Adam Levine is well cast (and can act) as her on-again/off-again songwriting partner ""Dave;"" the movie music is seamlessly blended; and it's especially refreshing to see a rare intimate-yet-platonic relationship between music executive ""Dan"" (Ruffalo) and Gretta (the movie's most notable attribute).  Yet, surprisingly, none of it left an indelible and enduring impression, personally speaking (it's like a Teflon movie; nothing sticks, LOL).  Also, Hailee Steinfeld (Best Supporting Actress nominee for the ""True Grit"" remake) is miscast as Dan's daughter, with limited dialogue (and wardrobe) and often simply making faces, perhaps in an (unsuccessful) attempt to secure her another Oscar nomination, but her character is unappealing and forgettable, as is much of the film, though with no glaring weaknesses.  The acting talents of Rob Morrow (TV's ""Northern Exposure"" and ""Numb3ers"") are also lost in the lackluster shuffle.  Those with ties to the music industry will probably be most impressed, while probably also satisfying Ruffalo and Knightly fans, but don't expect your traditional romantic comedy.

6562553,2,B00M7D81SQ,"Sometimes you just know when a film isn't for you. This is not the same experience as watching a ""bad"" film, with deficiencies of script, characterization and directorial technique. The issue centers over questions of taste: what viewers expect from a film and what they are actually presented with.

This is certainly the case with John Carney's BEGIN AGAIN. The plot is straightforward: Brit expat Gretta (Keira Knightley) has a long- term relationship with Dave (Adam Levime) which crashes on the rocks when Dave is catapulted to stardom and has a brief fling with publicist Mim (Jennifer Li). Gretta meets accidentally with washed- up producer Dan (Mark Ruffalo) in a New York bar, and after an iffy start, the two of them agree to produce a do-it-yourself album of Gretta's songs, with the help of amateur musicians, Dan's daughter Violet (Hailee Stanfield), and some of Dan's acquaintances in the music business. The plot is an old one, a recycling of the ""Let's Put on a Show"" genre historically associated with Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland musicals of the Thirties.

The leading actors try their best with a shallowly-written script, but nonetheless Ruffalo's Dan comes across as someone entirely responsible for his own decline due to impatience and a fondness for alcohol. Knightley's Gretta is a passive figure, although apparently a talented song-writer, and she really cannot sing.

Yet the potential for character-development is set aside in a film with far too many unmemorable musical numbers for its own good. On several occasions viewers yearn for the singing to end and the plot to resume.

There remain one or two incidental pleasures: Carney's use of New York locations communicates something of the city's infinite riches, although we could have done without the clichd sequence in Times Square. James Corden rehearses his familiar role of a bouncy best friend (in his pre-LATE LATE SHOW incarnation).",1469145600,,1925,5.140575079872204

6562567,5,B00M7D81SQ,"The title of the movie encapsulates the overarching theme of the movie, but knowing the destination doesn't tell you about the journey. This type of movie will be typecast as a romantic movie, or love story, or the like. As someone who loves music, it's as much a love story with music as anything else. This isn't just a movie about a catchy soundtrack, a few songs you'll remember, with relationships serving to only get you to where the next song is performed, but the music is the star. Lyrically and in terms of arrangement, this soundtrack is superb. The idea of performing the album when and where they do is an incredible idea (though might not actually be possible, if you've recorded, the background noise would be a nightmare in the mix, I would think?) that really captures New York in so many ways. But overall, great performances in terms of the actors, the musicians, but the songwriters really excelled here. I can't stand Adam Levine, but that last live performance is everything he could be as an artist. Absolutely superbly written song and performance like few have ever been captured on film.

6562609,3,B00M7D81SQ,"No question, as I am personally very well aware of, trying to break into the record business (I know, I know records, vinyl, although making a come-back of sorts are so, well, yesterday) is a hard dollar, a very hard dollar. As it turns out after a look see at this film under review, Begin, Again, not only breaking into the record industry as a singer-song-writer is difficult but being an idea guy is too. Staying on top might just be harder for a guy who can spot the next big thing, the next big sound, the next million plus seller to keep the coffers of the record company filled. Those two themes are at the heart of this movie about the big breaks and bad falls inherent in such an unstable industry based on catering such an esoteric subject as musical tastes-and surviving. Of course this one is latched together with plenty of wry comedy and pathos but the main point in well taken. Luck is good, luck is probably necessary, you know being in the right place at the right time, for example sitting in some coffeehouse in the Village in 1960 just as the vaunted folk minute crept up an bit the young before settling back into its now greying demographic niche. But you better have that idea, that sound wired that new thing whatever luck you may have or you are cooked.

Here is how this one played out. Dan, played by Mark Ruffalo, a guy who built the record company he was at by being the big idea guy, being on top of what people, some segment of people anyway, wanted to hear by hearing something in his head had been for lots of reason including the break-up of his family life and serious drug and alcohol dependency having a rather long dry spell between hits of talent-spotting. Got canned for that, got canned from his own creation once the bottom line trumped creative genius, and other reasons.
So Dan was like a lot of guys and gals who are in such a situation desperate to break out, to find that next best thing-again. One night he was in a bar drinking, heavily drinking to be kind, during an open mic when he heard this female singer, hears this lovely English young woman, Gretta, played by Kiera Knightley, playing this mournful tune that the audience was going to sleep over. But to Dan this voice and basic was to be  his next big thing, his comeback trail all a-blazing. His ticket back to the top. (Frankly hearing both the open mic version of the song Gretta played on stage and the one Dan heard in his head left me dry but maybe I am still too attached to the rock, folk rock, rock and roll of my youth to catch what today s youthful ears might groove on.)

Problem: Kara was getting ready to blow town after a painful and difficult break-up with her lover-musical partner Don, played by The Voices Adam Levine, an up and coming singer, who had blown town for the Coast the with some honey from his record company. Had let some success go to his head, had gone commercial, meaning over-produced material, meaning elevator musak down the road. So Dan got a No sale. Well not no sale really once our boy Dan went to work on his concept, his no money, since he had none, big idea concept for her. She bit, bit big time once she got herself committed to the concept, the idea of producing a demo au natural, using New York City and its sounds as backdrop to her songs.

Along the way we get a glimpse at why Dan had been a king hell idea guy. But we also see why his family life busted up and why Gretta was still busted up about her relationship with Don. Although in the end Dan got back with his family and Gretta, gave Don the air after he flunked her test about doing her song in a folksy way not the over-produced fluff the record company had talked him into.

You probably won't get many suggestions about how to break into the music business (if you don't make it on The Voice, lets say) from this one but I would point out to you the fate of the guy, the English guy, who befriended Kara when Adam broke up with her, a guy who spent his life singing on lonely street corners near the subway entrances in New York City. That unfortunately is the fate of many very talented, and not so talented, musicians who don't get on somebody in the industrys radar. Nice in the end feel good film.

I have been a fan of Ruffalo's since I first saw him in You Can Count On Me. Also, I was pleasantly surprised to witness the many talents of Knightley. I have seen her in numerous movies. Some I loved, some I didn't. Though I must say that none of the disappointments seemed like they were entirely her fault. I know enough about film production to realize that a weak screenplay and poor direction can ruin a performance as well. In Begin Again, Knightley's voice is sweet and engaging. In fact, it was the songs that were my favorite thing about this film. So much so that I immediately bought the mp3 album and downloaded it to my Amazon cloud player. Adam Levine was another surprise. Before this, I only knew him from the Maroon 5 hit, ""Animals"" which I love, love, love! Now, I love his rendition of ""Lost Stars"". His voice is beautiful.

Now to what I did not like about this film. As a writer of novels and as screenplays, as well as an avid filmgoer, I felt the first half was disjointed. Mainly the backstories of the two main characters seemed poorly executed and at times overdone, especially Dan's. I didn't start enjoying the plot until Greta and Dan began creating their citywide album of New York. Even a second viewing of the film had me fast forwarding past most of Dan's ""cringeable"" history. Maybe I have seen too many drunken losers in tacky, disgusting man pads, but I hated all of that. And the drunken loser, losing his job because he was stupid and yes drunk. Please! And the hair, too many curls, too, too much. Fluffy, long man-curls are so passe, reminded me of a caveman. For me, those things just did nothing but take away from the film's charm. Sorry Mark R., but that part of the performance, I could have done without. Still, I will continue to watch every movie that you are in if I can get a hold of a copy.

Would I recommend this film to others? I already have.",1462060800,,2031,4.456989247311828

It could have easily been cliche or cheesy or dull and forgettable, but it played along in a beautiful and painful. Some complain that it's not realistic  for the music industry...but that was kind of the point (that it should be realistic) and it made that point without being weird and bitter. So many of the actors are very recognizable, but they play their roles so well I forgot they were all these other characters from the past films  and just saw them as they were here. Only when it ended did I pop out of the bubble and think ""Oh my goodness! that was Keira Knightly? That was Mark Ruffalo? Adam Levine?""

In addition to having many cliches, the movie failed to  create empathy for the characters and emotional connection. The characters felt forced and predictable. Knightley's acting was as usual, portraying a persona too familiar from her other roles. However, I did enjoy Ruffalo's performance, and Adam Levine is pretty good as an actor.",1454976000,,427,5.279411764705882
6562721,5,B00M7D81SQ,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Both leads, seconds, everyone really, who had a part in the process of bringing this film to fruition, thank you all so much. This is one outstanding film, something for a sensible PG rating, but parents should be cautioned, it isn't sunday school, New York.  Otherwise, I may have missed a zip word here and there, but still and all, older kids hear worse at school or otherwise.

This stpry is not unusual, down and out guy meets shy and sweet musically talented, as well as  penning ballads.. Lovely. Enter 1 separated spouse, 1 broken hearted lyricist,  one foul boy friend, and somehow, through mr. down and out's showbusiness  contacts, all the varying parts cohese into a diverse and talented group of musicians.  Not just bored studio sets, but upscale and fine musicians, talented all of them-they rocked this entire film.  As fate and sterling contacts, the group comes together, even mr down and out's teen queen daughter joins in, further proving a well thought out comedy, easily relatable to across the board audiences.  No nudity, sex, bombs of any sort,.  Safe to put on for just friends too.
The story is predictable, so I won't garnish with more than my usual, ""grew on me"",  but I think the one thing I may have missed was the lack of chemistry between Ruffallo  and Knightly.  If the chemistry had been a touch more genuine, or at least allow the scene to move past what looks to be utter boredom and disturbing staring over your shoulder sort of gaze from Knightly.  Mark kept squinting at Kiera when facing front on and speaking directly, his eyes squeezed halfway shut, or at least they did from my viewpoint.  Maybe it was dust in the air.
I also think his voice has strained out, perhaps with just age. Still I enjoy most all of his work, and was glad to see he would lead in this film. Knightly has impressed me since she began her career. I can't say I recall seeing either of these two ever working together, and it wouldn't matter. I just wanted to watch this film, right evening for good choice.
Can't say enough about the music, stellar productions.  Would be interesting to hear a disc, if one exists.

This is a film I will deliberately recommend to my friends. In it, except for little youngsters, something fun and entertaining exists.",1454803200,4,2302,4.646913580246913

Needless to say, I was very disappointed, as the plot and performances feel very contrived to me.  The lip-syncing (and lack of live music) is obvious; they've done all kinds of futzing with Keira's voice, and they've made the music played outside sound like a studio-recorded session.  It just doesn't feel natural, authentic and spontaneous like the music does in ""Once"".  Also, the character development is extremely weak, there's virtually no drama or tension, and the editing is choppy with lots of very short scenes.  The only character I really enjoyed was the British friend who played street guitar.  Employing a few famous actors just cannot help a weak script.",1453593600,,759,5.080645161290323

6562747,5,B00M7D81SQ,"I rarely write reviews, but I always read them. I'm not going to write a summary, because the beauty of this movie is watching it without knowing the plot.  I watched this movie On Demand on a whim and fell in love not only with the characters and story line, but the music is also amazing. Who knew Keira could sing? I immediately purchased the sound track.  I watched the movie two more times in less than 3 months which I never ever do.  The story line is not ordinary, which I appreciate a deviation from the formulaic, and the characters have great chemistry.  It's funny, and deep and very relatable.  There's no nudity, no violence - just a genuinely great movie.  So I bought the movie - I rarely buy movies, but I was afraid there would come a time that I'd want to watch it, and it wouldn't be available.  In my opinion it's a classic - like ""When Harry Met Sally,"" and ""You've Got Mail,"" and I don't own either of those movies.

6562857,5,B00M7D81SQ,"The tale of promising musician, Greta, playing muse to boyfriend and rising star, David who betrays her, and not the kind of film I usually watch. Being a Keira Knightly fan I expected this film would deliver and it did.

From the films opening it sustains interest and even though this is a feel-good film it isn't predictable and doesnt disappoint with clichs. One of its features is that its critical of corporate music publishing, but takes a fresh approach to how a promising singer becomes a star.

The film is critical of the corporate music world showing it to be out-of-touch with artists and only interested in the bottom line. One of its key ideas is how a group of musicians working collaboratively and not simply for money or fame is able to subvert the corporate model.",1443830400,,783,4.666666666666667

[minor spoilers]

Keira Knightley teaches young women to dress classy and not desperate. How cool is that? Mark Ruffalo on the other hand hilariously tries to bribe children with cigarettes. Adam Levine gets slapped in the face and also winds up with a giant beard. I couldn't predict the ending!

6563003,5,B00M7D81SQ,"If, like me, you were bowled over by Once (2006), then you must agree that its director, John Carney, has built up serious cachet. Carney's 2013 project, Begin Again, does nothing to lose him shine. Sure, it's not as devastatingly raw and grungy as Once, but it's raw enough and grungy enough and has enough moments of soul-deep heartache. Don't let the big Hollywood gloss fool ya, this is a John Carney joint, and he puts his all into this one. He gives Begin Again its beating heart.

It's about two people who end up saving each other: Gretta James and Dan. Gretta (Keira Knightly), the British songwriter who came to New York with her rock star boyfriend (Adam Levine) but whose heart was subsequently ripped to shreds. Dan (Mark Ruffalo) the New York music executive who used to be big noise but who lost his mojo somewhere along the way. Today, he just got fired  by his partner (Mos Def) from the indie label he himself launched years ago. When Dan throws a tantrum, he is told: ""You're not Jerry Maguire."" Do I go even go on about how Dan makes a complete ass of himself in front of his estranged 14-year-old daughter?

In a bar, that evening, Gretta and Dan meet, she having just performed impromptu on open mic night, he having listened to her sing and coming away impressed, even though no other in the bar seems to have been. And even though Gretta gives Dan the fish eye - because the man really does look down and out - she does eventually agree to make a record with him.

Maybe what Dan proposes strikes a chord with Gretta's adventurous side. Dan suggests a fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants enterprise - that they and whichever band members they could scrounge up roam the streets of New York and hunker down here and there and record a series of live sessions, and whatever happens, happens, only, for gosh's sake, keep the tape rolling. And that's the premise that hooked me. Along the way, the film explores heady stuff such as the desolation and perseverance of the human spirit, keeping faith with one's art versus selling out, not judging a book by its cover (something that Gretta and you and I do when it comes to Dan's marital woes). It's a movie that packs in these joyous moments that celebrate music as an art form and as panacea to deep loss and ruination. I wallowed in its grit and its ability to wring out emotion. Somewhere along the way I fell in love with Gretta and Dan. Ruffalo and Knightly have this amazing, amazing chemistry and it's so satisfying when they prove to be each other's salvation. Knightly has a surprisingly sweet voice, and I'm more gobsmacked by her blistering ""Like A Fool"" than with Levine's soaring rendition of ""Lost Stars."" Listening to Knightly's giving her damn all to ""Like A Fool"" - Gretta's drunken voice mail ef you to her betrayer - is like this raw nerve being exposed and plucked at. I would've loved this movie for that scene alone. Does it have a happy ending? It's up to you to decide. It sidesteps the obvious fairy tale ending. And yet, at the end, there is closure and a sense of people growing up and forgiving others and themselves. Mostly, there's the music. Music permeates each and every scene. And if ""Like A Fool"" is my favorite intimate moment, then Dan and Gretta's sharing the ear buds and 'fessing up what's on each other's playlist is a very close second. So, yeah, see this one. It'll get to your guts and make you feel something. I put it in the same awesome wheelhouse as Once, The Committments, and Bandslam (yes, Bandslam!).

The DVD's bonus stuff:

6563005,5,B00M7D81SQ,"This was one of those rare films that I loved so much on the first viewing that I immediately had to watch it again. I then proceeded to annoy all of my friends by pestering them to watch it. Knightley has a lovely singing voice, and the songwriting is just superb. I really liked the friendly relationship between Knightley's character and Ruffalo's, but really, pretty much everyone in this movie gives a great performance -- even Adam Levine, who has said he was nervous about acting in this film but pulls it off quite well. I can't say much more without revealing major plot details, so just trust me on this: It's worth watching. Rent it first if you must, but you'll probably want to buy it after seeing it.",1438300800,,714,4.5

6563010,4,B00M7D81SQ,"Imagine that that this is far from your favorite type of movie.  Add to that the fact that the music is not a kind that greatly appeals to you.  Then, consider the notion that a fairly formulaic, predictable movie like this ordinarily sets your teeth on edge.  What a surprise, in view of these critical factors, to discover that the entire experience of viewing ""Begin Again"" turned out to be highly pleasurable and engrossing.  Though the cinematography is hardly dazzling, the production is slick and handsome.  The entire cast is thoroughly convincing throughout the picture.  The director manages to deliver emotion-stirring highlights that are very potent.  What is highly exceptional are the songs.  Whether or not they are in a style that appeals to you, their composition and arrangement is entirely strong enough to cause you to believe that they could be credible hits.  I've seen too many movies about the music business wherein the sub-par quality of songs that are supposed to be popular winners is a serious distraction, straining one's ability to buy into the whole story.  The last movie I can recall that handled this issue as well as this one was the very spot-on ""That Thing You Do"".  I suspect that a surprisingly wide audience will take great delight in ""Begin Again"".",1438128000,,1290,4.925925925925926

6563041,3,B00M7D81SQ,"Early on, our Keira Knightley character says something like, ""I'm not Judy Garland, fresh off the bus and determined to be a star.""  Well, duh!  No, she's NOT Judy Garland.  Judy Garland was ENORMOUSLY talented, whereas Keira Knightly is only moderately so.  (Lose that smile and she'll fade away like Bilbo Baggins putting on his ring.) But every other rise-to-stardom cliche even remotely hinted at in Keira's statement is crammed into this film.  No, it's not bad, merely mediocre, the film equivalent of elevator music, a feel-good movie to lull people to sleep.  Seriously, no one actually WROTE this script.  It was assembled from the scraps scattered across Hollywood's cutting-room floors.  The box should come with a warning: DO NOT DRIVE A CAR OR OPERATE HEAVY MACHINERY AFTER VIEWING.

Such an honest sweetness conveyed by her character, ""Greta"".Mark Ruffalo nailed his part as the"" down on his luck"" record executive perfectly, as usual.

6563131,4,B00M7D81SQ,"Begin Again (2013)
  I missed this gem when it came out, thank goodness for netflix and Amazon.  Director John Carney likes to write his films as well as direct them, as he did with Born Again for which film the Academy nominated for best song and for the 2007 film Once which racked up an Oscar win for the same category.  So Director Carney hired himself to write the very warm and very true script.  My theory that the writing holds the key to a good movie stands up well with this one.
 Smart Directors also hire first class actors.  The two leads, Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo are both Oscar nominees, Knightley for best actress in Pride and Prejudice and Ruffalo for best supporting actor in The Kids are All Right.  Given that they have brilliant lines to deliver, they really come up to the task at hand.  Ruffalo plays an emotionally wrecked record producer who lives more or less from drink to drink and away from his estranged wife and teen age daughter.  His daughter is played by Oscar nominated Hailee Steinfeld (for True Grit).
 Knightley's character has a broken romance with her successful rocker boy friend surprisingly deftly played by real life musical success Adam Levine of Maroon 5.  He manages his few scenes with genuine acting power.  Often musicians transforming to the screen do so incompletely.  Not Adam.
 With her heart broken after her boyfriend dumps her, the young singer wants to flee New York when the nearly destroyed record producer chances upon her and hears her special brand of singing.  Most of the film then shows how they manage to make an album without studio money to back them.  In the process the producer switches from Bourbon to Pepsi and the unlucky in love singer finds the courage to go on.  All in all it makes a lovely story, full of the things that we humans like see and feel.
 Let's see, three Oscar nominated actors working with a script of unusual depth and intelligence, a writer/director who has managed two Oscar nominations for his films, one resulting in the golden gizmo for best song and Adam Levine of Maroon 5 singing for us.  Not at all bad.  If that isn't enough, I recommend it highly for those who want something in a movie besides flames and car wrecks.
 One hour and 44 minutes, this movie was made for only $8 million but returned almost $65 million world wide.  If the makers make a good movie, the ticket buyers will buy tickets.  At least in this instance.",1434412800,,2439,4.592592592592593

John Carney really crapped the bed on this one.  Mark Ruffalo, who I have always liked in the past, phones in a terrible and cliched performance.  While I can't claim to have been a Keira Knightley fan, I never really hated her but I will probably never sit through another one of her movies after this one.  I can't imagine what all of the people who liked this movie saw in it.  Really.  I can't.  It actually makes me wonder if the positive reviews were all written by a paid PR team.  This movie was THAT bad.  Some highlights:  horrible music, cliched dialogue, repulsive acting, that guy from Maroon 5 sporting a beard, Keira taking a hipster bike ride through NYC, the end of Ruffalo's previously stellar career, directed like an NYU film school project, horrible music, spouting off about ""bad"" and ""commercial"" music but every song in the movie was commercial garbage, the cliche line ""you can learn a lot about someone from their playlist,"" ... I can't keep going ... I just can't. My recommendation, stay far away from this movie.  My rating, two thumbs up the writer/director's dark cleft.",1434240000,5,1270,4.521929824561403

I didn't even know who Adam Levine was. I was doing my granddaughter's hair and the movie came on again. She asked, ""Is that Adam Levine?""  I said yea, who is he?  I thought he was just an actor in the movie lip syncing songs To wrap it up, loved the movie, love Mark Ruffalo, love Adam Levine, love Keira Knightly, love Mos Def,
Perfect movie. Many layers. Very inspirational for people who are just beginning a new creative endeavor. They will ""get"" it.",1434240000,,702,4.231343283582089
6563139,4,B00M7D81SQ,"Begin Again is a good film however it isn't a perfect one,i found certain things hard to believe and in my opinion the story falls apart toward the end of the film and speaking of the ending it lacks. In my opinion Keira Knightley and Mark Rufallo are the glue that hold this film together (for the most part) their scenes together are what i most enjoyed about this film especially the headphone splitter scene where they walk around Manhattan and ride the subway listening to each others playlists. I also felt that certain roles should have been played by other actors nothing personal against Adam Levine from Maroon 5 or the Rapper Mos Def but it would have been nice if some unknown upcoming actors were given those roles instead,some may consider this nitpicking but it is how i feel..In ending i will say that i like Begin Again which is why i gave it 4 stars but when it finishes it feels incomplete as if something is missing.",1434153600,,936,4.511764705882353
6563140,3,B00M7D81SQ,"Parts of this movie were good, but I think it was miscast.  Maybe the Adam Levine character should have been the discovered singer/songwriter and Keira Knightly the already successful, cheating girlfriend.  I usually like Keira Knightly but she didn't seem right in this part. It was worth watching just for Adam's performance at the end.  Mark Ruffalo was fine and the actress who played his daughter was very good.  I did enjoy the bits with Ceelo and James Corden (?).  Part of the movie seemed like a rip-off of the Beatles rooftop recording session.",1433894400,,554,4.851063829787234
6563141,5,B00M7D81SQ,"The director of 'Once' has done it again!  'Begin Again' is a story with lots of music, just like 'Once'.  This time the film is set in New York, where fired radio executive meets a signer-songwriter who writes only for herself.  He's entranced and things she could have a hit album on her hands.  She's not so sure, and takes quite a lot of prodding to finally come along.

Mark Ruffalo is just fantastic in this film.  He's very convincing as a troubled man who has a daughter he seldom sees. a career that's going nowhere, and a drinking problem to boot.  Kiera Knightley is also very good as the singer in question.

I've seen the film twice and enjoyed it both times.  I'd watch it again.",1433808000,,693,4.393700787401575

6563147,5,B00M7D81SQ,"I'm really crazy about both the main actors in this film and so it had me at 'hello' if you know what I mean. But this story was so gripping about a young girl, talented in her own right as a singer and guitarest, but didn't push herself forward due to her involvement with a real up and coming rock star singer with a band.  She was supportive of him and when he got famous he jilted her for someone else. Heartbroken and stuck in New York (she is English) she decides to sing at a bar where that sort of thing is welcomed.  In comes an alcoholic producer of Music CD's who is downtrodden and on a slippery slope of losing his own company and his position there.  He hears her and imagines in his mind how she would sound with added instruments. That scene where we see his imagination and hear what could be is a gripping scene and sets the pace for the rest of the movie.  He helps her and she in the most remarkable ways helps him with his beleagured life and estranged marriage and tough relationship with a very talented and impulsive, independent daughter.  The combination of characters and the eventual solving of the problems in all their lives is such a wonderful, inspiring tale. I could watch it again and again and still be satsified and entertained.  Bravo!  See Gee",1433376000,9,1281,4.379746835443038

6563198,4,B00M7D81SQ,"To be honest I wasn't that into this movie at the start, I found the constantly going back in time as a character looked at a photo on their phone or something then the event leading up to that replaying to be a bit annoying and I wasn't really that captivated by the events happening in the film.  But the film did grow on me and after I don't know 20 minutes or something I started to really get into it and enjoy it.  Knightly's singing performance got better as the film went on to, the opening number in the bar had the audience starting conversations with those beside them, I too was bored by it but that was probably intentional for us to see Mark Ruffalo's character's influence to make a music success of.  Knightly and Ruffalo do a good job in their respective roles.

The artistic angle of telling a tale is also extended as the ending plays out while the credits do.  I've seen bloopers or extended scenes of what we've seen before, even events after the ending that aren't essential, but never the actual ending of a film before done this way.

Basically the movie is about an alcoholic father who doesn't really connect with a nearly adult daughter he hardly sees since he has separated from his wife.  His once successful career has pretty much just ended due to his recent behaviour under the influence of alcohol but when he decides to have one more drink rather than killing himself in the New York subway he notices Knightly's character's tanking performance and sees something the rest of the audience doesn't when he adds in other instruments in his mind.  A potential star to make him worth something again.

Not a film I'd probably ever watch again but a decent film once it gets going.",1430611200,,1710,4.508090614886731
6563199,5,B00M7D81SQ,"I really, really liked this movie! I think that it was well cast, which is something I had been skeptical of prior to viewing.

It all comes together to take you on perfect trip of ups and downs. Overall, a pretty fantastic viewing experience!!!",1430524800,,404,4.704225352112676

I have to say that the surprise for me was Adam Levine, who does a really great job in his first acting gig.  We already know that he is a first-rate singer and musician but he surprised me with his vulnerability as ""Dave"".

6563234,5,B00M7D81SQ,"There is one scene in which it is said ""this all is a pearl"", or so, looking at life as it happens from the viewpoint of music. If you know the good side of rock'n'roll's attitude towards life, not the hype and certainly not the darkness, but this ""stay strong in the struggle"" ... maybe not at first sight, but there's a lot of these moments in this movie. As if every actress and actor has at least one shining, true moment. The face of the music producer in that music club, hearing that song at that point in his life. The staring in the eyes when two lifelines separate (or unite). This one guitar solo, followed by the idea to turn it into a commercial concept. The missing link between the mass experience of synthetical music and the individual experience of hand-played music. The moment when the one who is in the music shys away from showing off. The tension between original motivation and business aspects. And even the lack in technical knowledge describing a ""splitter"" as a device for inserting two headphones into one headphone ""input""? How did they capture all that in one movie?

But beware, if you fall for this, don't fall any further. Or you may end up like some guests in the first scene's music club, waiting for the next good song unable to recognize it when it is played to you.

Knowing that, this movie is very encouraging. A good place to get back to when you lost it. It is a pearl, indeed.",1429315200,,1420,4.436781609195402

I usually don't enjoy Keira but she made me a believer in this one. Adam Levine is dreamy. The whole crew works as a synergistic whole in this one. I even bought Mark R's ""Sympathy for Delicious"" after watching this* because I know he had been working on that just before this one. I haven't watched it yet, but I love everything he does so I'm sure it will be great too.

Different than ""Once"", but I think anyone who knows that good music is the soundtrack of our challenging (and often painful) lives, owes it to themselves give it a chance.  The music is quite good, but it's not all the film is about.  Gave me a totally knew respect for Keira Knightley.  Who knew she could sing?

I really enjoyed the realistic dialogue and interactions between the characters, like Mark Ruffalo saying to Catherine Keener, ""you want some sexy time?""  haha!  The only bad part of the movie was Adam Levine's awful facial hair, and that was the whole point...for it to be awful.  I could really feel the friendship and support between the 2 main characters.

They set out to record an album live in the streets (with one performance done just like the famous Rooftop Concert.).

As far as its music goes, Begin Again is perfect, nothing short of exhilarating. This is not a big surprise, as the film is directed by John Carney, best known for his Once. The live performance scenes will not disappoint you.

The same cannot be said about the films clichd storyline. There is nothing new about those characters, including Mark Ruffalos Dan, a disgraced producer, drunk, estranged from his daughter Violet (Hailee Steinfeld) and so on and on. The films satire on todays music industry is weak and simplistic.

Watch Begin Again for its wonderful music. There is a plenty of it.",1427241600,,874,4.891891891891892

Ruffalo is a wonderful addition to this movie. You get to watch him grow again like a phoenix from the ashes of his life. I was very happy that the movie did not follow the trite, predictable story that was there to be had. It took a chance and it worked! This movie could be view with one that you love or all alone!

6563374,3,B00M7D81SQ,It's a good movie. But I'd say there are some really missed emotional moments. Mark's performance was amazing. Adam was basically playing something he could relate to so I think he did well. But KeiraI felt like she really just phoned that performance in. I really didn't buy that she had been treated the way she was treated and I think that is what the missing element was in this movie. Overall tho I still would say that I enjoyed the movie and Lost Stars was definitely the cornerstone to what little real emotion there was in the film.,1426550400,,541,4.474747474747475

Mark Ruffalo's character is pretty much a clich, a divorced with a daughter, independent music exec who's fed up with trying to make money the conventional way and wants to rebel against the music establishment. Throw in a drinking problem and being broke for some reason and that's Ruffalo's character. Keira Knightley at least makes it interesting.",1425168000,,371,5.098360655737705

While the lyrics Keira sings are kinda  cool, her voice is way too soft and boring and this whole movie pretty much follows her and others around with a lot of really boring singing and dialogue. When Adam Levine's character sings, it shows even more how weak and not-entertaining the rest of the singing in this movie is. Just terrible.

Feeling lonely and financially broke she's decides to go back home. As luck would have it, she bumps into another musician friend in NY and her world is about to change. He convinces her to stay, offers to share his place and she accepts. He performs on an East Village stage and encourages her to go with him one evening.  After he performs, he tells the audience he has a friend who's great and asked them if they'd like to hear her.  She ends up on stage and a drunken, fallen-from-grace music exec hears her sing. He is immediately captivated by her raw talent. From this chance encounter, emerges a beautiful story of how both mutually transforms the other.

I am a fan of Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightly. The supporting cast is wonderful and includes James Corden. It's better than the movie Music and Lyrics, which is another musical/romantic comedy. I was surprised how good the music is in the movie. I had to purchase the CD after seeing this movie. I love both versions of the song Lost Stars. Keira actually has a decent voice and who doesn't like Adam Levine. The music is actually memorable and most songs written for movies are not. You will remember the songs long after the movie. There are so many great scenes in this movie, but my favorite is when is Gretta (Keria's character) is singing a voice mail message telling off her ex-boyfriend Dave (Adam Levine). See this movie and you will not be disappointed. Also, purchase the CD.",1424390400,2,939,4.662650602409639

6563483,5,B00M7D81SQ,"I was really pleasantly surprised by this movie.  In ways it's the typical musical/romantic/comedy, but it's unique, also.  I don't want to give too much away, but it really doesn't follow the typical plotline, and I loved the twist -- the happy ending which is a different happy ending than you might have expected.

In addition to the fact that this movie is a little different, it's also very clean.  There is none of the gratuitous nudity and sex that often accompanies this kind of film.  It's a sweet love story that couples would feel comfortable watching in front of their children.

Finally, the third reason I really enjoyed this film was the music.  It's about a record producer and his new protoge, so there are many scenes in which the girl and the band are performing.  I'm sure everybody likes different music, so not everybody would agree with me, but I really enjoyed the music.  The words were very poetic and heartfelt.

I had at first given this film four stars, but as I was writing and remembering the details, I went back and changed it to five stars.  I really did enjoy this movie, and I'd actually like to watch it again.",1424390400,,1147,4.573529411764706

6563500,4,B00M7D81SQ,"I am not a big fan of mainstream films, but this one caught my imagination. It stars Keira Knightly as Gretta - she has come to New York with her boyfriend Dave who has just had a big hit. Despite having collaborated on a number of songs he soon gets blinded by the glitz of the high life and leaves her stranded and alone in a foreign city.

Before deciding to head off home she hooks up with James Corden who gets her to play an open mic night where she is spotted by alcoholic shambles of an A and R man Dan (Mark Ruffalo) and he decides she can be a star. She on the other hand does not believe him and then the fun begins.

I really enjoyed this, the songs are great with Keira Knightley sounding a bit like Nat Johnson (check her out if you are not aware of her music) in places. Dan drives a great old Jaguar Mk X and the film has a heart a soul and a positive message all wrapped up with some great performances and it is even funny in places too. Bit of a guilty pleasure but one I am happy to admit.",1423872000,,1009,3.9411764705882355

Probably because nobody was standing face to face and singing at the drop of a hat. The story was good, there is some conflict  involving Mark Ruffalo and his wife and daughter and his business partner. At first he is kind of creepy and unsympathetic but in flash backs we learn about the origins of his anger and hurt and start to like him. Kiera Knightly is nice and sweet and kind of a doormat to Adam Levine so their conflict has a real impact on her growth as a person. Sounds really deep and depressing but its not, basically because the characters evolve and change for the better and are upbeat by the end.",1423094400,,744,4.276595744680851

6563529,5,B00M7D81SQ,"Besides being an incredibly nuanced, versatile actor, Mark Ruffalo just seems like the kind of down-to-earth guy you'd love to grab a beer with. Here he plays a scruffy, down-on-his-luck music producer who discovers the sublime voice of Greta (at pretty much the same time we, as the audience, discover the sublime voice of Keira Knightley -- who knew??). As a lifelong musician and vocalist, I pretty much figured ""Once"" would top my list of best-ever music movies. But this film, helmed by the same writer/director, comes pretty darn close. In fact the above-mentioned discovery scene includes one of the most awesome representations of how musicians often ""hear"" a complete song arrangement from a simple melody line. Most of the movie revolves around these two characters and their subsequent recording sessions, which (again, awesomely) leverage the actual ambient sounds of New York City as a backdrop. The songs themselves are fantastic, you truly root for the characters, and the script resists taking the easy way out. In fact, the whole story feels so natural and real that for a minute you might forget you're watching several high-wattage stars crafting a deceptively complex tale about identity, love, and longing. Absolutely stellar.",1422576000,,1247,5.24

Mark Ruffalo is wonderful as a grumpy old man of a music producer who accidentally discovers a new talent (Knightley). One thing I particularly loved is that this is a rare movie that shows a friendship between a man and a woman with NO romantic interest between them. See, Hollywood -- it can be done. This is a movie I will watch again and again. The soundtrack is also well worth buying. I should add: this movie got an R rating because it contains two F-bombs. That's all. There's no nudity or explicit sex, and no violence to speak of. There's nothing in this movie that you couldn't share with your grandma, as long as she's OK with the occasional naughty word.",1422057600,,802,4.5

It's a cute little film, with a number of missteps. And a tougher editor, film and script, would have done wonders. Put it this way: if Lennon and McCartney were filmmakers, not songwriters, this would have been a middlin' McCartney solo effort.

I think this film should have stayed truer to its opening, Ruffalo -- who is to always playing the same part what Catherine Keener is to always playing the same part, his wife here -- is good early. Tough, cynical A&R guy that's heard it all. Then major misstep number one -- when he ""hears"" the song Keira's really singing, in the bar, and the instruments start playing themselves ... uh, no.

Then the you-can-listen-to-my-playlist-if-I-can-listen-to-yours scene.... Think Red Rose the Speedway.

6563557,5,B00M7D81SQ,"I have to admit, this movie did not go the places I figured it would, the places that 'convention' seemed to indicate that it would.  That's my first take, having just finished watching it.  The cast is very strong, with Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightley carrying the film as a mentor/singer who have a very easy friendship, where they focus on what they have in common, and only tiptoe around what they don't.  They were so good in their scenes, just the two of them, that I wish that there had been more of them.  Hailee Steinfeld is fine as his daughter, she wasn't in the film nearly as much as I thought she would, while Catherine Keener plays the Catherine Keener role (and well).  Likewise CeeLo Green plays essentially himself, and has the charisma you'd expect him to have in front of the camera.  Mos Def gets to play the ""villain"" of sorts, while James Corden was very amusing as the sidekick relief.  Adam Levine won't win awards for his portrayal of the ex-boyfriend, this isn't 8 Mile after all, but he does a solid professional job.

The music is what draws you in though most, and New Radicals' frontman Gregg Alexander and his team of songwriters craft an entire album of great songs, and do them so that they work with the voices of Levine and Knightley, which is very important.  They didn't write the songs and hope that the actors could pull them off (or they did, and got lucky).  Knightley would be foolish to give up her day job to become a singer, but only financially, she's got chops.  Director John Carney continues to show signs that he might be the Irish Cameron Crowe, with this movie and Once, and we're the better for it.

Five stars.....easily.",1421452800,2,1677,4.534883720930233

I distinctly remember reading two quotes from Knightley: ""I'm so not musical"" and ""I'll probably never sing again [after this]."" Those statements lead me to believe that her voice was engineered for the film. Which is fine, but it made the whole concept seem limp.

6563602,3,B00M7D81SQ,"I liked Once so I thought another movie by the same person who did Once would be just as good. Not quite. Its a good story, jilted singer-song writer meets down on his luck music producer and together they put out an album of her songs, each one recorded outside in a different place in NYC.

Mark Ruffalo as the producer is great, has a disheveled homeless look about him that's actually pretty believable. Keira Knightly can't sing so listening to her was pretty painful and not my favorite part of the movie. And I seriously doubt, being a resident of NYC, that any album could be recorded outside the way they did it.

Dan Mulligan boasts the attitude of person who relies on a muse, and Gretta James is just a person who writes songs for her cat. Together, with some other bored friends, they make music - take away show style.

At the end, I couldn't say what either had learned from the other. Perhaps it was just about the music? It was a fun ride, and everyone came to terms with reality through the process. I felt good about watching the movie, and I empathized with all of the characters. The few scenes where it seemed that one character might fall in love with the other (and ruin the whole story/venture, imo) made me nervous, but were deftly avoided.",1420329600,,875,4.434782608695652

Never been a big Mark Ruffalo fan, and he continues his scenery chewing ways here, as if possessed by the ghost of James Dean. However, James Corden is natural and engaging, and there are winning performances by Hailee Steinfeld, Catherine Keener, and, yes, Cee-Lo Green. As for Keira Knightley, can the woman do any wrong? Not only is she engaging and completely believable, but the woman can sing. Adam Levine, on the other hand, can sing, but not act. Great fantasy scene in the early going where we see and hear what is going on in Ruffalo's mind. As he listens to Knightley's rather mousy performance of a song, the instruments of a proper arrangement play by themselves, and we hear how powerful the song could be. Nicely done. Only question left unanswered: Who is taking care of her cat all this time back in England?",1420156800,,1159,4.8291457286432165

6563691,4,B00M7D81SQ,"In Begin Again, an encounter at a bar between a disgraced music-business executive (Ruffalo) and a young singer-songwriter (Knightley) new to Manhattan turns into a promising collaboration between the two.

I am normally not a fan of these types of romantic drama movies, but this actually had a charm to it that I found myself enjoying it very much.  And with a soundtrack that fit in so well and sounded so fresh that I was wishing I had the album soundtrack in front of me to listen to again.  Knightley was great in her role and surprisingly can sing pretty well.  I didn't even realize Adam Levine was in it until he made his appearance and I said to the wife..Hey, that looks and sounds like the guy from Maroon 5."" (It is in fact, the guy from Maroon 5.)  There are some bits of humor in this but I wouldnt call this a romantic comedy at all as it tends to be more rom-dram than anything else.  Not a bad thing at all though, as this is not a typical rom-dram at that, being less mushy happy ending and more of a storyline that makes you smile at the end instead.

Overall, I enjoyed watching this more than I thought I would.

Wonderful to watch with the whole family (9-ish to 90-ish folks)  All will enjoy and there are not any cringe-worthy scenes you will be embarrassed in front of your kids about.  Highly recommend!

6563701,5,B00M7D81SQ,I watched this last night and then again today. It's one of the best movies I have seen lately and I've seen a lot of movies. I was quite surprised by Keira Knightley...there's more to her than I thought. Mark Ruffalo is always good but he shined in this movie.,1419984000,,261,4.24
6563702,5,B00M7D81SQ,"'Loved everything about this movie including Kiera's odd facial expression, Mark Ruffalo's ruffled appearance, the dirty underworld of the music industry but mostly the great music and musicality.

I know it was rated ""R"" but really must we have all this foul language.  It did not add one thing to the story, it took away from it.  Hollywood when are you going to get it.  Drop all the foul language and just let people ENJOY a good story.  It's kind of like cigarettes - we are so over it.

Keira Knightley also gave a strong performance as young, confident song writer who allows herself to develop into a unique performer with the help of Ruffalo, who does find the ""gift"" he has for finding the music.

6563839,2,B00M7D81SQ,"I noticed that this movie was the product of the director of ONCE and since I loved that movie, I rented this one.  My wife and I really loved ONCE and the Broadway show and we were excited to see this. NO. This was not like ONCE.  It was very disappointing.  Why the two stars?  Well lets start with chemistry.  There is no chemistry between the leads.  There was a strange relationship though.  I keep feeling that there was going to be a love story between the young singer and the older agent, but it felt like that at the end the director drop this :vibe"" for some reason.  Maybe it was because of the relationship of the two stars of ONCE.

I didn't become emotionally involved with the two leads.  I didn't really like the agent. His drunken behavior and arrogant attitude were off putting.  The singer character didn't seem.....well consistent in her motivation.  I know humans are not consistent, there are reasons for why we act or things.  I guess the lack of background to her character lead me astray, but I couldn't warm up to her either.

However there was one scene in the  movie where I knew who directed this movie.  Just seeing this scene let me know that this was the connection to ONCE.  In ONCE there is the scene in the music store where the man and the girl {that was their names in the movie] sit at the piano and sing Falling and the camera swings around them as they emotionally connect.  There is one scene here that captures that that type of magic for the viewer and that is when the agent hears the girl in the bar.  He is at the bar drinking and when he hears her sing he stops and gets up moves to the stage.  On the stage is the girl singing with a guitar and musical instruments laying around the stage like the musicians have walked off the stage to take a break.  Now the agent hears the song and begins to add instruments to the song adding one instrument at a time turning the plain song into full mature sounding song,  This was so beautifully done.

And that leads to why the two star.  ONCE had MUSIC that stayed with you long after the it end.  The music never reached the point of that.  I remember how the director staged the songs, in allies and on roof tops and these were good, but the songs themselves are forgettable.  I found myself watching the musicians playing at the different places and not listening to the songs.",1418515200,3,2370,4.339407744874715

6563841,5,B00M7D81SQ,"This movie is a gem--from the script, to the acting, to the music. I love the story of the search for independence of the female main character and the story of people following their dreams and succeeding in reaching them by doing it their way. Highly recommended.

As a Kiera Knightly fan, I knew I was going to see this film but I didn't know I was going to enjoy it as much as I did.  Also, who knew she could sing!?  I kind of want whoever created the music for her character in this film to keep creating music for her to sing.  Will be buying the soundtrack also.

The acting, filming, character development, and plot are all amazing.  And if you're ever looking for a post break up movie to lift your spirits and inspire you to move on and become everything amazing that you could be, this is it.",1417996800,,667,4.171875

In the first place, I realize that Keira is a much better action star than rom-com lead. Unfortunately, she is so awkward and pathetic in this movie, that I seriously wanted to shake her and slap her silly. Secondly, Mark Ruffalo is so vanilla as an actor, that sitting through 2 hours of them stumble around, writing music and falling in love was like watching two mentally challenged people try to express their feelings.

The soundtrack, of course, is great. There's a tension between some of the characters about authenticity vs sales potential, which I think is something we all wonder about when listening to our favorite music.

6563932,3,B00M7D81SQ,"I thought it was okay. I guess I was expecting a little more and what was delivered was pretty a much a full-length version of the trailer. I could have saved myself a lot of time and just gotten the gist with the clip. Keira Knightley was great and Mark Ruffalo's character was not the most likeable but he did a good job. I was the most curious to see Adam Levine attempt acting and he was a bit disappointing. He wasn't particularly good or bad, and it really could have been anyone playing that role, as opposed to what it seemed, which was a musician pretending to be an actor. I think Adam's time would be better served focusing on his music again rather than spreading himself thin and producing the techo-pop drivel he has been of late.

I think it's fine for a rental but frankly 'St. Vincent,' which I saw around the same time was a much better investment of time. It offered an original story and superior acting, which, 'Begin Again,' has just been done before.",1417478400,,973,4.405555555555556

It is a seemingly simple yet moving story about what it means to face struggles and begin again on your own terms.  Mark Ruffalo is brilliant, as always, and Keira Knightly is finally able to shine in a contemporary role.  And, oh yeah, Adam Levine can act.....really well.

Mark Ruffalo is convincing and interesting enough as fallen record company executive who basically learns to get excited about music again via the reluctant ingenue gamely protrayed by Keira Knightly.  But the big problem is that, while the music is good, getting the music (ie, the soundtrack) in the real world is done exactly the way this movie is telling you it SHOULDN'T have to happen.  By putting the music on a ""real"" record label, the makers of this movie feed the very beast they say is killing music as an art form.  The theme of the movie is to forgo the recording industry, but this is the opposite of what the makers of the movie end up doing.  If you're going to talk the talk, walk the walk.

If you really love music like me you will love this movie, the music itself is so wonderful and the story that goes along with it is so great to see put to film and now I have it. I don't want to say too much about the story, I knew nothing about this movie. A friend mentioned it to me while we were at a concert lately and then I saw it when I was shopping and picked it up. I think part of the reason this movie has such a big impact on me is that the person I thought I would live the rest of my life with is gone and it has taken me so long to get over it. I have just got to the place to move on and wow this movie hit everything that I was trying to say but everything I wrote was very negative. Yeah for me this is some pretty heavy stuff.

6564115,5,B00M7D81SQ,"I remember seeing ads for this movie and wanting to watch it. But I hate going to the movies. Don't know, I can't explain. So when it popped up for rent, I snatched it up.

Honestly I was really looking forward to this film just because I love Mark Ruffalo and though I won't admit it I kinda love Keira Knightley as well. I had no idea Adam Lavine was even in it until I read an interview with Keira and how she said he was incredibly good at acting like an a**hole during the shoot.

Begin again is a story about 3 separate people. Greta (Keira) and her boyfriend Dave (Adam) are song writers and they've embarked on many projects together. Always together. They're flown to NY to see about a record deal and for some reason Dave is forced to fly to LA without Greta. She tries not to be bummed out about this but as soon as Adam returns, he's showing her a song he wrote while he was in LA. About another girl. Dude, that's a really b*tchsh*t way to tell someone you're in love with someone else. I would had drowned him in the kitchen sink. That's just me though.

So you see Dave in glimpses of being a jerk, basically. And you follow Greta through trying to mend her broken heart. Her friend she ends up staying with was probably one of my favorite characters. The way he freaks out about her breakup, you don't meet many people like that. And it was him to forced her to get on stage and sing which caught Dan (Mark)'s attention. I loved his savvy you-matter-you-dont-matter attitude he had the whole film. I love the friendship that bound both Dan and Greta together. I love the impact Greta made on Dan's daughter the most and how she got her on the track. And I loved how no matter how much time was spent between Dan and Greta or what was going on, it was all business. All platonic. There wasn't romance in it. It was like a breath of fresh air.

Begin Again, I think is the perfect title to how everything plays out by the end of the movie. It was captivating, inspiring and really well done. I wasn't expecting to love this movie as much as I did!

If you're looking for a hear warming movie to watch on these soon-to-be cold winter nights that aren't drenched in romance then I would highly suggest Begin Again!",1416182400,,2226,4.27790973871734

6564125,3,B00M7D81SQ,"What Happened to Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova after ""Once"" became a hit?  It went to  the brilliant Hansard's head and Marketa rather disappeared into oblivion.  Oh, and their on and off-screen romance died. Director  of both films, John Carney , seems to have mined that real-life happening for ""Begin Again"".  Knightly, an aspiring songwriter in the film, and  even sings her wistful little""real""  tunes in her breathy little voice to acoustic guitar, similar to Irglova's material worked out on piano.  Adam Levine, as Keiria's partner and lover, belts out his material just like the wildly raw busker Hansard , leaving Knightly behind as he is rushed into Hollywood stardom. BTW, Levine is terrific.  The man can sing and just exudes chemistry.  Knightly is not my favorite and I only like her in period pieces because she is more model than actress, always posing and flashing the mega-watt teeth.  She seems a little too enthusiastically fake here and her mouth takes strange shapes when she is singing which I couldn't watch.  ( I always loved Streisand's music but could never watch her sing).  The ever-excellent, Mark Ruffalo has some great scenes here as once-talented music producer who is on an alcoholic skid. The scene where he takes Knightly's modest little acoustic song and imagines it after ""production""  is great fun and a music education.  (Ruffalo played a similar role in ""13 Going On ""30"", as a photographer who is ""choreographing a set of models to 60's feel-good music.)

As musicians and songwriters ourselves we loved how they captured a musicians ability to hear the details of song in it's early stage. How the song comes together in the end to make a something pure and pleasing to the ears. Mark Ruffalo is his always incredible genius self with his ability to seem slightly off balance throughout his performance. Keira Knightly was wonderful and was true to herself in this film. Who knew she could sing? The rest of the cast were equally pleasing to watch and you find yourself drawn into this movie. Starts off a little slow, but the momentum picks up after the lay the back story for the characters. Doesn't hurt t have a seasoned singer like Adam Levine add some very raw moments to this movie.

It has a great cast, including Keira Knightley, Mark Ruffalo, Adam Levine from Maroon 5, Catherine Keener and a Cameo by Ceelo Green. And Hailee Steinfeld, who was nominated for an Oscar for her role in the Coen Brothers film True Grit, has a good role here as well. The basic setup for the movie is that a famous record producer has lost his job, but discovers a great singer songwriter. Their work together makes a difference in their lives.

6564199,1,B00M7D81SQ,"Please don't waste your money on this movie! Only 30 minutes into the movie, I found myself waiting for it to be over. Even Adam Levine's wonderful voice couldn't save it.

The first thing that got to me was Mark Ruffalo's overacting. This was in play as he pretended to be a drunk loser with his life falling apart, but hit full swing as he jumped around like an overexcited four year old during the outdoor recording sessions when he pretended to produce songs for an album. You'll notice I use the word pretend. This wasn't acting.

The plot is completely unrealistic. (Spoiler!) As if recording songs outdoors is going to make them into hits. Nope. And as if posting an album from an unknown artist online is going to bring in 10,000 downloads on its first day, and leave a record label upset that they didn't get a contract for that album. Nonsense.

The filming of the movie took place in such an easy breezy atmosphere, that watching it, you can't forget that they're acting. There's not enough depth about each actor, and not enough interplay between them, to care about their characters.

I expected a movie too involve me emotionally. Begin Again utterly fails in this respect. The only redeeming thing about it is that we get to hear Adam Levine sing Lost Stars. I'm upset that I actually bought this on bluray, when it hardly deserves the $1.29 it would've cost to rent it at Redbox.",1415577600,3,1395,4.590361445783133

I suppose he shouldn't have been as musicians do well at showing emotion.  For the little time that he was actually in the movie, he portrayed his role very well.  My only complaint is that I don't think Keira Knightley is a good enough singer to pull off the role.  She's eh, okay, but I would never buy a song she performed.

I didn't expect the music to be wonderful, that would have taken some real doing. It felt as if I knew these people, had known them at different points in my life. I adore Kiera Knightly and can't imagine why there is a backlash against her luminous beauty. She walks through this role seemingly without makeup and wearing a charming wardrobe. The movie takes a big swipe at the corporatized music business. What's not to like about that?

6564227,5,B00M7D81SQ,This is my first online review of any type.  This movie is worthy of www praise.  The story is not one you have heard before.  It evokes wildly divided and ultimately unified emotions and nostalgias.  And it entertains every turn of the reel.  It is heartbreaking.  It is inspiring.  And it is awesomely fun all along.  With unbridled enthusiasm I recommend you watch this.,1415404800,,373,4.71875

6564237,3,B00M7D81SQ,"Good acting, unusual inside look at the hardships of the music world on a shoestring budget and the single-minded dedication it takes to 'make it'--along with a bit of luck.  The only reason this did not receive 4 stars was the language.  We are so weary of the F word used in so much of movie dialogue.  With well over 1 million words in the English language, and profanity taking up less than 1/10 of 1% of that, surely writers can come up with more intriguing or challenging interplay.  It comes across as laziness, and it fails to entertain, or even shock anymore.  Above that it takes away from the tremendous talent of the actors and dilutes the story.",1415318400,,658,4.495798319327731
6564238,4,B00M7D81SQ,"*Spoiler Alert

Very much like ONCE. Two strangers help heal deep wounds with strong romantic currents and a flurry of musical creativity.  But in the end we are robbed of the outcome we want.  It's an emotional twist but one we've had before.

Ultimately worth a watch - very creative and funnier than ONCE but the music is missing the fire that made ONCE so compelling",1415318400,,370,4.5606060606060606
6564239,5,B00M7D81SQ,"Back in 2007, I was spellbound with a little movie called Once.  It was full of magic and charm and just this earthy subtlety that compelled me to every scene.  And, there was the music, which was just enchanting and completely where my musical taste was at, at that time.  Revisiting the film only leaves me warm inside.  It still has all of the wonderful richness that made it so special and such a triumph nearly ten years ago.

Yes, I will be seeing it on the stage this winter.

So, this begs the question, why has it taken this long for director John Carney to give us a follow up?

Well, technically Carney has made two films in between Once and Begin Again, but one was a thriller and the other was a comedy about some guy in a red suit pretending to be an alien.  They don't count.  But, absence does make the heart grow fonder, and I couldn't be fonder of Begin Again than I am right now.  In fact, the same warm smitten feeling I got the first time I saw Once has fallen over me and I find myself chomping at the bit to watch it againand againand again.  While it doesnt quite have that gritty realism that Once encompassed, Begin Again being a far more polished and detailed work, it carries with it the same passionate sentiment that made the 2007 breakout film so delightful.

And this ensemble, as varied as it is, is exquisite.

Begin Again tells the story of a washed up music producer who has fallen from grace; far from grace.  Hes divorced, his daughter pretty much hates him and hes a drunk, and because of this aspect he has just been pushed out of his position in the company that he helped build.  Wasted, literally and figuratively, Dan is at a crossroads.  This is when he meets Gretta, by pure chance, in a Manhattan bar.  Shes an expat, straight from Britain, with a sad story to tell and a talent to help her tell it.  Dan looks at her and he sees success, but his credit has run up and no one is going to help him make her dreams come true; so they work together to help themselves.  In the process, they discover themselves, rediscover their passions and learn to grow.

A lot of the same points raised in Once are raised here, with obviously a difference in scenery and even in the handling.  I love how delicate the whole thing feels though.  Despite the fact that we have pop stars gallivanting and pop music blaring and a superb lensing of the city with flashy edits and musical montages to resemble a music video, the film always feels human and grounded.

A lot of this is due to the incredible cast.

Keira Knightley, in my eyes, is the next Kristen Scott Thomas.  This girl is such an underrated talent.  I feel like she is typecast by people who don't take the time to explore the depths of her filmography.  Shes seen as the skinny girl in corsets, but she builds such tremendous depth in a variety of roles, and this is yet another example of her versatility.  But, where I draw my Scott Thomas comparison is found in her ability to reflect so many raw and honest emotions in the way she controls her body.  Her body language is so natural, so effortless.  She never appears to be acting, ever (mostly ever).  She just embodies these characters with such life.  Mark Ruffalo is continuing to soar through the new life in his career, and he delivers a memorable performance.  I was really surprised with how tuned in Adam Levine was here.  He nails this performance, and while it doesnt really require a lot from him, he never comes off as a singer trying to act.  He feels like such a natural fit.

But MY GOD I think I fell in love with James Corden.  Like, I didn't even know who he was until this movie (you know, other than the fact that he was starring in Into the Woods later this year), but now hes on my radar and I cant wait to see more.  He was such a natural, delightful performance that filled the screen and stole my attention without ever being overbearing or unnecessary.  His character doesnt have a true arc and it he isn't even really important and yet he rests so comfortably in the scope of the film that I missed him when he wasn't on screen.  He lit up, and his line readings were by far my favorite aspect of the film (the whole guitar remark was GOLD).

This is what it means to be a true supporting player.

Begin Again gets pretty much everything right.  The music is catchy and charming, the story is fluid and memorable and the performances just seep into our hearts.  Its a feel good film that feels better than good, it feels great!",1415318400,2,4504,4.34251497005988

I loved the intimacy and vulnerability of ""Once"" and love music.
This movie had none of that intimacy and vulnerability was attempted but was not true. It was staged and had no real feeling, so I was disappointed.
On the up side, Knightley was tolerable, the music was pleasurable, and Adam Levine was a real surprise in that I felt he did a good job. He did not seem like a musician acting (see: Cee Lo Green) but was a natural actor whose character could have come across as an absolute arrogant, write-off jerk, but instead showed himself a flawed, flailing human being like the rest of us.
James Corden was also very good, filling the part as the ""funny, supportive pal"" of Knightley's character, he did have incredible energy and interesting presence. He stood out in thankful contrast next to Ruffalo and Catherine Keener, whose characters were, to me, stale and lifeless (I usually love Mark Ruffalo).
I understood what the script was trying to do, feeling-wise, all too well. There were no surprises, save Levine and Corden's performances.

Maybe it was his over-the-top, sloppy-drunk alcoholic character and the fact that it's hard for me to believe that someone that can barely stand up and walk has such sudden creative foresight to envision this unknown singer as the Next Big Thing...or maybe it's just that it took so long to get there.

His marriage is falling apart, his relationship with his daughter is strained and he drinks too much. After his drinking goes too far he loses his job and ends up at a bar wondering what to do next. When Gretta (Knightly) steps up to the mic both of their lives change for the better. Much like the movie Words and Pictures judging by the cover I was expecting a cheesy romantic comedy that has been done over and over. Much like the movie Words and Pictures I was wrong. The best way to describe this is a music version of Jerry Maguire without the love story aspect. I really like how the movie shows what is happening from more than one persons point of view. This also shows what is wrong with most of the music executives today, focusing too much on a single song rather than the artist. My favorite line of the movie is when Gretta tells Dave that his recording of the song she wrote got lost in the production of it. The movie itself is OK, a little generic but the acting and the music really make it great and I recommend this if for no other reason than for the music and the amazing ending. Keira Knightly does all her own singing and she is actually really good. Overall, a less romantic Jerry Maguire with great music and a perfect ending. I really enjoyed and recommend this.

Dan (Ruffalo's character) finds Knightly while drunk in a bar and slowly convinces her to produce ""a record"" where she creates film for her songs all over the great spots for music in NYC.  A lot of redemption in the themes and Ruffalo finding his way back to something meaningful.  I can even forgive them for casting Cee Lo Green in a bit part.  He really

He is separated from his wife (Catherine Keener) and his part time daughter (Hailee Steinfeld) is the typical hurt movie teen needing a father figure. While trying to get drunk he hears Gretta (Keira Knightley) give a really rotten night club performance, although Dan hears something great.

Gretta has just broken up with her rock star boyfriend (Adam Levine). She agrees to do an album with Dan recording outdoors in different parts of the city with Dan cashing in favors to get background musicians.

The film was not a good life drama. It was not a comedy and the music was fair. It has indie appeal to aspiring writers/singers as well as indie lovers who don't know a bad movie when they see one. Knightly gave us her typical role and looks, seemingly phoning this one in. Dan was hardly likeable. And in two minutes time Gretta can solve all of the teen's problems.

Anyone who hates on this movie is just a jerk who has no happiness in their lives or something. Or they are just not a hopeful person or a romantic and shouldn't have been watching a movie like this in the first place.

ALL of the characters did well, especially Mark Ruffalo. Just from the bar scene (from Mark's perspective) where he was drunk, getting off listening to Keira, imagining instruments moving and what not. Had me rolling!! Hilarious!

And let's not forget about the fact that Keira chose to be with NO ONE at the end of the movie. How empowering for a woman and an up-and-coming artist, not selling out with the label.

Yes, you can say the movie may have been a little corny and expected, with Mos Def being the studio head and Cee Lo being the cool, famous homeboy that backs Mark up on everything. But if you look past all that and really feel what was being portrayed. Family. Betrayal. Love. Forgiveness. Compassion. Taking Chances. Looking past people's faults and failures. Music!! (Who doesn't love music?!) Change. New Beginnings.

I should go to bed right now, but this movie has inspired me to write this review and probably watch something else. I could almost cry right now. I know this sounds crazy. But it was a beautiful movie, and in some way, different (mind you I've seen similar movies where people sing and/or the songs are relevant to the movie/characters, such as Country Strong, Blue Valentine, The First Wives Club, Almost Famous, and many other greats). For example, sharing the headphones and walking all around town. Poetic!

And then you get to hear Adam Levine's sexy ass kill the songs. Though I didn't care for all of the songs by Keira, the one that her character wrote for Adam's characterBEAUTIFUL!! I think sometimes people are too critical and they point out the negativity. It was too slow. Too predictable. This and that actor failed because they aren't real actors and should stick to singing/rapping. Whatever you want to call it. People are too ""something"" and they miss out on the beauty.

While I am a realist. Perhaps I am just a hopeless romantic at heart and that's why this movie moved me. But either way. With this crazy world we're living in. We need movies like this. I LOVED IT and will watch again!!",1413849600,,2357,4.626794258373206

6564379,4,B00M7D81SQ,"As John Carney's previous film ""Once"" did before, this movie is trying to capture the power and magic of music. There are several moments in the movie when nothing is being said in words, yet the music conveys the message beautifully and succinctly. Another theme in Begin Again is authenticity - artists attempting to stay true to themselves and their art, and artists who believe that bringing joy to the audience is what matters the most. And while there are some notes that might sound a bit off key (the boyfriend played by Adam Levine comes off more as a caricature than an actual person, and Hailee Steinfeld, who is terrific, gets to play a sulking teenager who pretty much out of the blue finds herself on a stage playing guitar with conviction and ease of a pro), the main characters played by Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightley are believable and likable. I particularly enjoyed that this is a movie where the two leads are male and female and passably close in age but yet this is not a love story and the plot is not concerned about their journey to each other but rather their parallel journeys to find themselves and connect through music and their respective love for it. They 'get' each other. And once the audience buys into that idea (I did), the movie unfolds nicely and makes sense.",1413849600,,1301,4.612068965517241

6564381,5,B00M7D81SQ,"It could be argued that John Carney has made ""Once"" twice. We have two lost souls who find one another and change their lives through the power of music. We're in New York now instead of Dublin and he's a down and out partner in a record label and she followed a boyfriend to New York from England after he signed a major label deal. His wife has left him and he hasn't signed any new talent in years. Her boyfriend cheats on her on his way to becoming a self absorbed rock star. She is a talented singer songwriter who's talent probably eclipses the boyfriend's. It doesn't matter that Carney is mining pretty much the same territory again. It works. Music really is as powerful as he believes and the chemistry of Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo is undeniable. He's gone beyond ""Once"" to make ""Begin Again"" a love letter to the streets of New York as the two take to the streets to use the city as their studio for recording an album. The rag tag band of guerrilla musicians is appealing and Carney also manages to lash out at the music industry to make a strong statement that music is art first and a business second. Adam Levine has said he didn't need acting lessons to play a self absorbed rock star and it's true. His job is mostly making music and he shines in that capacity. CeeLo Green shines as a Troublegum, a rapper who pays back Ruffalo for helping him get started. Mos Def is Ruffalo's prickly partner in an indie record label and James Corden is great as an Irish busker, yes an Irish busker who's Knightley's best friend and helps her in making her musical vision come to life.

She has just separated from her rock star boyfriend and writing partner Dave (Adam Levine), and is about to return to London, when she is asked to perform impromptu by his friend Steve (James Corden) in a club. Down and out producer Dan (Mark Ruffalo) happens to be there at the time, and is entranced by her performance and tries to sign her for a record label headed by his ex partner Saul (nicely played by rap artist Mos Def). She is initially reluctant but finally goes along.

Though marketed as a romantic comedy, it hardly follows the ""boy meets girl"" formula. Knightley sings many songs in the movie, not all memorable (I did like ""A step you can't take back"" which is included in the movie's best scene, as Dan imagines Gretta's acoustic performance accompanied by a full rock orchestra). Knightley usual charm is the major driver of this feel-good movie, though most performances are fine. Also with Catherine Keener and Hailee Stanfield, as Dan's ex wife and daughter. There is a great scene after the final credits you should wait for.",1412812800,,1133,4.751269035532995

6564387,5,B00M7D81SQ,"Written and directed by John Carney (Once), Begin Again is one of those films that gradually engages you, drawing you in to the lives of its characters and giving you a taste of how wonderful things come to be, and then stays with you long after the story is done. It works on two distinct levels, the first being how the characters are at once ordinary people but people capable of doing extraordinary things, and the second being how it deals with the very nature of creativity and inspiration.  And like Carney's earlier film Once - a really great little film if you haven't seen it already - Begin Again is all about the music, and how a chance meeting between two strangers can lead to something neither would've produced on their own.

Dan Mulligan (Mark Ruffalo) is a burned-out record label executive in New York City. The film begins with him out on a bender when, in a small East Village club, he encounters a songwriter named Gretta (Keira Knightley) whose music stirs something him, something he hasn't felt in years. He immediately approaches her, offering to sign her to his company's label. But Gretta, already not in a receptive frame of mind (for reasons we find out later), dismisses him as a typical big-talking drunk and turns him down, thinking it's all done with when he walks away. However, when she leaves the bar, Dan is waiting outside for her and in spite of her resistance persuades her to join him for a drink so that he can show her that he's for real.

The next sequence takes us through flashbacks where we find out why Dan was out getting drunk that night and why Gretta is in such an edgy frame of mind. Everything in Dan's life is in a downward spiral. He's just been fired from his record company - a company he helped found - by his partner Saul (Mos Def) - because of his indifferent attitude and the fact that he hasn't signed a single new artist in over seven years. His family life is in no better shape. He's estranged from his wife, Miriam (Catherine Keener) and can't seem to connect with his teenaged daughter Violet (Hailee Steinfeld). Gretta, for her part, has just broken up with her long-time boyfriend and songwriting partner Dave (Adam Levine). Gretta had followed Dave to New York from London when an opportunity for him came up, thinking that they were partners in all ways, but as Dave's success begins to rise, she finds herself being relegated to things like getting coffee.  The last straw comes when she finds out that he's had an affair with one of his new producers while on a business trip to Los Angeles. She immediately leaves, crashing temporarily with an old friend from London named Steve (James Corden) who now lives in New York and who is the one who persuaded her to go out and to play at the club that night. Her intent is to leave New York and return to London, but Dan manages to persuade her to at least think about his offer.

The road ahead though takes an immediate detour as the meeting Dan sets up for Gretta with his partner Saul goes nowhere.  Dan, however, is undeterred, and unwilling to let go of the feeling that Gretta has something special in her music. Using his knowledge of the business and a few connections he still has good relations with, the most significant of which is a successful hip-hop artist named Troublegum (CeeLo Green), who remembers Dan from when he was fully engaged by what he was doing and can see that Gretta has something that has brought the old spark back to life.

This is the point at which Begin Again really starts to shine.  There is an infectious joy the comes from watching people doing what they love and loving what they do, and it spreads as the film progresses, drawing in the most unexpected people under the oddest circumstances, the creativity going on inspiring others to add something of their own, which in turn spurs yet more creativity. It is really fun to simply watch and listen as Dan and Gretta and their cohorts produce their album on locations all through New York City, making the natural sounds of the city part of what they're trying for.

The songs were written for the movie by Gregg Alexander as principal songwriter in collaboration with a number of other songwriters including Danielle Brisebois, Nick Lashley, Nick Southwood and Rick Nowels. The film needed a unique and compelling sound and this team, along with the supporting musicians and sound technicians, managed to deliver wonderfully.

Highly, highly recommended.",1411084800,43,4469,4.6455696202531644
6564388,5,B00M7D81SQ,"The other starting-over character study from this summer that Begin Again is bound to be compared to was Jon Favreaus Chef, which I liked. Begin Again is just as delightful as Chef was, and there really is no comparing the two. John Carney, director of Once, has made another charming and delightful music film that goes far on the chemistry of its two leads.

Dan (Mark Ruffalo) is an aging alcoholic music producer who just told his boss to shove it. Dan is divorced and has a poor relationship with his daughter and ex-wife (Hailee Steinfeld, Catherine Keener.) Gretta (Keira Knightley) is reeling from her breakup with successful musician Dave (Adam Levine). Gretta sometimes wrote the songs and was torn to pieces by the breakup.

After her brother makes her sing at an open mic night, Dan just happens to be in the same bar the night his life has fallen apart. He uses his last bit of good will at the record label to get Gretta her big break. The record label people are skeptical. Dan and Gretta get musicians together and make an album on their own, simply because they have a mutual passion for the music. In the process, they both help each other start over and find where they're supposed to be in life.

""Begin Again"" is really nothing more than a decent character study with some great music. Keira Knightley can sing - who knew? Her voice isn't a revelation, but its perfect for the kind of music they do in ""Begin Again"" and doesnt sound autotuned. Adam Levine (who I didn't even know was in this movie) did a serviceable job as an actor, but is really just here to sing a few times.

""Begin Again"" is small and grand, an intimate spectacle, just the way it should be. It follows almost the exact same plot line as ""Chef,"" up to the end, except instead of food, the focus is music. ""Begin Again"" was made before, or maybe during production of ""Chef"", so plagiarism isn't an issue. Also, neither of these stories are exactly original. But ""Begin Again"" never hurts from feeling too familiar or predictable.

Knightley is the perfect yin to Ruffalos yang, and even the supporting players get a considerable chance to shine. Begin Again is bigger and maybe even better than Carneys cult classic Once. But even those two movies feel wrong to be compared. Theyre both great for different reasons. I feel like 20 years from now, people will be watching both movies in certain circles. And thats special, right?

6564389,5,B00M7D81SQ,This movie reminds me of Midnight in Paris. It's a simple movie. There is no great shocking moments. No twists or turns. It's just a really beautiful story that flows effortlessly like a little work of art. I remember watching this movie and smiling. I know I've thought about this movie more than once since we saw it. I can't wait to buy the DVD. It's got a great soundtrack. Mark Ruffalo creates a beautiful character that I thoroughly enjoyed watching. A broken man trying to piece himself back together. I highly recommend this movie. It's sweet but not in that overly sickly sweet way. This was the only movie we saw this summer that didn't have me check my watch at least once. It moved really well. It was effortless. Really well done and beautiful cinematography as well.,1410393600,3,780,4.618705035971223
6564390,4,B00M7D81SQ,"well, another good movie which easily could have been great....the usual complaints from this never satisfied viewer > needed to shave off 15-18 minutes and too much smart and sexy women versus guys who don't get it stuff.

first hour or so, quite satisfying and very often brilliantly insightful.

the director/writer/powers that be had a terrific chance for a surprise ending...but no.

I still recommend this really good movie from 2013. Mark (the hippie producer lucky enough to carry on, thru disco and rap), Keira (the open mike singer-songwriter who has something going for today's pop music world but insists on staying the ""artiste""), and Adam (the superstar too willing to believe his reviews) do a super job of acting. LOve Mark's ""Jim Morrison in Paris"" personae > he plays that to the hilt!

Mark and Keira stubbornly hang on to their dream...will their dreams coalesce? check it out!",1410048000,2,897,5.0
6564391,5,B00M7D81SQ,"Sometimes a movie magically comes together and delivers everything.  It is romantic, hilarious, poignant and exciting.  Be prepared to immediately buy the soundtrack.  I haven't stopped listening to it since I downloaded it two months ago.  Keira Knightley was absolutely perfect as a songwriter without any intention of becoming the next Mariah Carey -- and who knew she could sing??  I read a review here that they should have hired someone who could sing -- they missed the point of the movie and her character.  She never is supposed to be an American Idol contender.  Her voice and performance sweet and achy and believable.  Mark Ruffalo is a comic genius who brings a whole new meaning to the word underdog.  Genius.  And Adam Levine -- amazing.
