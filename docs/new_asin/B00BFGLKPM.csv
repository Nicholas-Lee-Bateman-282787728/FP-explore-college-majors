8567768,4,B00BFGLKPM,"""Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Desqueyroux"" (2012 release from France; 110 min.) is an adoptation of the famous novel written by Franois Mauriac in the 1920. As the movie opens, we get to know young Th&eacute;r&egrave;se, enjoying the summer in the south of France (near Bordeaux). She is about to marry Bernard Desqueyroux, but it is very much a question mark whether this is a marriage of love more so than a marriage of convenience. Meanwhile Bernard's younger sister Anne is falling in love with a young man, Jean Azevedo, whom her family does not approve of (mostly because he apparently is Jewish). Th&eacute;r&egrave;se soon becomes pregnant with Bernard's child, and she feels more and more trapped. Will Anne and Jean find true love despite the family objections? How will Th&eacute;r&egrave;se deal with her own insecurities and axienties? To tell you more of the plot would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is a remake of the French movie of the same name made in 1962, so in effect a 50th anniversary refresh. Second, the movie is set in the 1920s, and in those days life moved slower and less hectic, and the movie rightfully reflects this, and in fact one could say the movie moves at snail's pace. I for one find it refreshing. Third, the scenery in the movie is never anything less than sumptuous, almost as good (but not quite) as that other recent French movie called ""Renoir"" (sorry, nobody is going to exceed the beautiful photography from that movie anytime soon). Fourth, kudos to Audrey Tautou for her performance in the challenging title role. Last but certainly not least, this movie is a must-see for any buff of French cinema as this was the last movie directed by the legendary Claude Miller, who sadly passed away only a month before the movie got its premiere at the 2012 Cannes film festival.

Not sure why it has taken so long for this movie to find its way to the US but better late than never. I saw the movie just this past weekend at the Laemmle Royal Theatre in Los Angeles, and the screening I attended was very well attended, in fact surprisingly so (for me anyway). Hopefully this bodes well in the longer run when the movie will be released on DVD. If you are in the mood for a quality foreign movie that is miles away from--and plays as if in slow-motion compared to--your standard Hollywood fare, you cannot go wrong with ""Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Desqueyroux"", be it in the theatre or on DVD/Blue-ray. (Please note that the L.A. theatre advertized it as ""Therese"" but the full name of the movie as it shows up in the credits does say ""Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Desqueyroux"".)",1377561600,5,2700,4.779443254817987
