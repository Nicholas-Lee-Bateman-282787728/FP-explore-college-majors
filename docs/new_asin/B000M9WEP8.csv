Keep in mind, thi isn't for everyone. For people who are used to that whole ""bad-acting, but at least they are hot and doing what they should"", then this will be new to you. There is no acting, well... I don't know, maybe a little. And since it is amatuer, it makes you feel, or at least I felt like this, that you were right there in the room watching all of this unfold around you.

I bought 3 DVDs and want to buy the rest of the series. I really enjoy them so far.  :)
