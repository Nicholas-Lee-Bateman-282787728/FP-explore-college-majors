The beautiful imagery is complimented with unique world music which really brings the whole collection of stories together well. This is a great addition to anyone's movie collection, particularly if you enjoy Planet Earth!",1304726400,4,360,5.446428571428571
4338008,5,B004EPYSBE,"This Bluray set has 9 episodes, and I can tell you that the first one alone (Oceans) is worth the price.

Thank you, BBC!  I can't wait to watch the rest!",1304553600,8,154,3.935483870967742
4338009,5,B004EPYSBE,"To sum the content in as few words as possible I would say: This documentary chronicles the complex synergy between man and beast. Not only is there some amazing footage, but BBC has done a spectacular job of making this a cinematic experience worthy of anyone's plasma TV. They even go so far as to strap a camera around an eagles neck while it stops a fox in its tracks! Have you ever wondered what a rocketship might look like to a caveman? We get as close as possible to viewing that experience when a plane flys by an uncontacted tribe deep in the Brazilian jungle. Yes, as many have mentioned before me there is lots of animal hunting which may be hard to watch. Monkeys shot with blowguns, a sperm whale speared by primitive weaponry... etc. All this can emotionally drain people who are only used to ordering their meat from a counter, but what is most difficult to understand is the spiritual purity of man living off his environment and land without commercializing, profiting and interfering with its normal functions. These principles, I feel, are the documentaries greatest addition.",1304467200,10,1096,4.7434554973821985
4338010,5,B004EPYSBE,"Unfortunately I know too many people who are cynical of society and humanity in general.  They think the worst of people and apply anecdotal experiences to society in general.  Many are xenophobic and think people in third world countries are stupid, ignorant, and not living valuable lives.  This is the perfect film/series to show to people like this.

While I love the previous series Planet Earth and Life, Human Planet is my favorite and is just as important.  It vividly expresses the human condition and the beauty and struggle of the most interesting and complex species we know of.  It shows how people risk their lives on a daily basis and work extremely hard for mere subsistence or for the opportunity to learn.  These people do not dwell on their sorrows nor are they unhappy.  They may live rather meager lives relative to Westerners, but their lives are as happy and fulfilling, and more so than many living materialistically in our society.

This series is a cultural masterpiece and should be shown in public schools I think.  It helps give people a more global perspective and helps us to stop thinking of life and society in only our American or Western realm.",1303948800,23,1179,4.792079207920792
4338011,5,B004EPYSBE,"After watching it on Discovery, there are three reasons I bought this DVD:

1. It is surprisingly raw for American TV. Normally Americans prefer to watch cute people eat dirty things, rather than watching dirty people eat cute things. Audiences complain when people living in harsh conditions kill whales to survive. Not everyone wants to be confronted with the messier, complicated reality when they can find solace in a simplified television narrative. That this show has the temerity and honesty to require a parental a advisory for ""disturbing content and indigenous nudity"" instantly wins a place in my heart.

2. This series presents what I believe is our best way forward with the environment. It shows an alternative to our conquer or be conquered conflict with nature. The idea that man can live as part of nature rather than as either as it's master or at its mercy is ultimately the key to our own survival. The key is not to absent ourselves from nature, but reconnect with it. Although many of the people in this series maintain ancient traditions, most are by no means primitive, living modern lifestyles combined with traditional ways.

3. Human Planet, like the actual humans of the planet, is refreshingly polyglot. Abandoned is the obnoxious convention where a person begins speaking in a different language, only to be talked over by a translator. Instead they are granted the dignity of speaking in their own voice, with translations appearing in creatively inserted subtitles. This also allows me to practice my listening skills in some obscure languages.

But now that I've got the DVDs, there are three things that really surprised me:

1. John Hurt has a lot more gravitas as a narrator than Mike Rowe, who just seems a little too smug to narrate this kind of documentary as he did in the American release.

2. There is a hilarious advertisement for BBC America narrated by John Oliver (of Daily Show fame)

3. MOST IMPORTANTLY! THERE IS A LOT MORE. Not to overshadow it's other virtues, but the reason to buy these DVDs is simply there is a lot more to see. Discovery truncated the series down to 5 episodes and a sixth rehash of clips from previous episodes. The Original, contained on these DVDs, has 8 episodes: 1. Oceans 2. Deserts 3. Arctic 4. Jungles 5. Mountains 6. Grasslands 7. Rivers 8. Cities (and 9. Extras) The Discovery condensation was not only unwarranted (what's the hurry? Did they need to finish quickly in order to have more reruns of Desert Car Kings?) but also awkward. Although the episodes on Rivers and Oceans did combine smoothly, the juxtaposition of Jungles and Grasslands was jarring and disjointed. Worst of all, they entirely omitted the final episode on Cities, which re-contextualizes the entire series as a voyeuristic museum of the primitive, rather than a nuanced articulation of the place of nature and tradition in modernity and society.

In its entirety, this forms a vital document of humanity, nature, and a possible solution to some of our greatest problems today.",1303862400,120,3031,4.917808219178082
4338012,5,B004EPYSBE,"I've said this before the last time BBC came out with one of these  -  National Geographic has been shown up.  Where are they?  This Blu-Ray format is dying for a grand portrait of humanity and nature but it seems only the BBC is aware of this.  NatGeo where are you?  Who cares?

Just as before, this BBC series is full of amazing photography.  I'm a daily photojournalist with a critical eye, and these folks know what they're doing.  It looks fantastic on my 58"" plasma.  There are few better ways to kill nearly seven hours.

Just as Galapagos, Life and Planet Earth before it, Human Planet is a mosaic, a good one, but more depth would have been welcome.  This is an intensely entertaining piece, but a tad shallow in the end.  That's really the worst I can say.  While this isn't a Sebastio Salgado level story of humanity, it's epic otherwise.",1303776000,13,850,4.470588235294118
4338013,5,B004EPYSBE,"This review is based on the UK Blu-Ray release and, so far, there seems to be no reason to believe that the US version will be any different.

If you have seen the BBC's superb previous flagship series 'Life', then I can summarize this as being the human version of that series by way of Planet Earth: A collection of exotic and sensational footage of humans, some living in various cities or villages around the world, but most of them at the fringes of civilization, all having to meet nature's challenges using ingenuity, daring and downright unusual or dangerous solutions. This includes dealings with environmental dangers, human extents to find or hunt for food in the most extreme environments, various extreme forms of human dwellings and adaptations, and the many types of relationships between humans and animals ranging from exploitative, to practical survival tactics or pest-control, the religious, the conservationist, etc. The structure of these 8 episodes is modeled after Planet Earth, with a different terrain per episode: Oceans, deserts, the Arctic, jungles, mountains, grasslands, rivers and cities.

If you have seen some of the regional documentaries by the BBC such as Wild China, Wild Africa, South Pacific, Yellowstone, etc. then you have seen this kind of footage where the local humans and their unique adaptations to their environment are featured along with the indigenous wildlife. Except that this series focuses only on the humans, and manages to find some truly amazing footage, most of it new.

Frankly, I approached this series with skepticism, seeing as the series is about people rather than the relatively more surprising and exotic behaviour of wildlife. I also had a few apprehensions about their approach, and half-expected environmental preaching and a general attitude of 'pure nature vs. evil humans'. But these concerns were allayed, and within 2 episodes I was hooked. Only the final episode ends on a thoughtful, environmentally-aware note while the rest of the series rejoices in human ingenuity and rich footage of human resourcefulness and unusual adaptations to their environments.

Some examples: Dangerous digging of a network of underground aqueducts in the Algerian deserts, building 35-meter-high tree-houses in the jungle with nothing but jungle materials and agile footing, lung-killing sulphur mining in Indonesian volcanos, a shepherd racing against elephants in Mali to reach a water-hole, Mongolian hunting using golden eagles, fishing on the edge of Victoria Falls, using falcons to keep skyscrapers clean, a dangerous long trek over thin ice in the Himalayas by children just to go to school, bedbug infestations in cities, tricky street-gangs of aggressive monkey thieves, stealing food from hungry lions, and much much more.

Which brings me to the violence. This time there is violence between humans and animals, most of it involving hunting. I can see this causing an uproar among animal lovers when this is released. But I think the BBC did a wonderful job of showing what is needed without sugar-coating or censoring reality and practical concerns often denied by animal lovers, and all this without exploiting or being gratuitous either. In addition, many of the hunts are performed by people that rely on it for basic survival, and they often involve dangerous stunts by the desperate hunters.

That said, some scenes are not appropriate for children. The gore of the hunts is often, but not always, minimized or off-camera, and there are scattered scenes such as the ritual drinking of blood from an animal in Africa, and some cataract surgery on mountain people that have gone blind from the sun, that parents would want to censor, not to mention the parental guidance needed on various daring stunts performed by carefree locals.

I found it very entertaining and illuminating to compare this release to some of the Mondos from the 70s, especially the underrated work by Antonio Climati who made a series of shocking, exploitative but justifiably observational documentaries on the relationship of humans with animals. Some scenes from Human Planet would not only fit right in with those works, they even cover some of the same footage and I would not be surprised if they used those documentaries for ideas (e.g. children hunting and eating huge spiders, sky-burials in Tibet, dangerous and bloody whale hunting by men in a small boat, the Matis hunting monkeys in Brazil, etc). Except, of course, the shock is minimized as much as possible rather than exploited, and the narrative is more inspirational rather than sarcastic.

Picture quality: I add this almost as an afterthought because the images are obviously stunning and in high-definition 1080/16:9 and you would expect nothing less from the BBC. Except that, due to the content, don't expect as many wildlife color postcards that bleed off your screen. In other words, very slightly and relatively less jaw-dropping than Life/Planet Earth, but this is still full of breathtaking scenery and cinematography of the highest quality.

Narration: Many documentaries have been weakened or ruined by a poor choice of narrator, and I was starting to think that nothing but Attenborough would do anymore, but they made a find on this one with John Hurt who lends a warm, rich and nuanced narration. Superb.

Finally, the structure: As mentioned above, each episode focuses on various extreme adaptations to a specific terrain and this gives the series a somewhat systematic framework. They thankfully got rid of the overview episode seen in previous releases and replaced it with a 10 second preview at the beginning of each episode, and they continued the trend of the ten-minute behind the scenes footage at the end of every episode which always adds some depth or human angle to the footage.

In summary, I am tempted to remove one star because the style here is more modern sensationalist entertainment-oriented footage rather than the educational and fact-filled documentaries that Attenborough made in the past. But the series is inspirational, rich, fascinating, mostly new, and very well put together, so I can't give this anything but full marks. Just keep in mind the caveats mentioned above.",1300492800,245,6230,5.2075848303393215
4338014,5,B004EPYSBE,"It was Mark Twain who is usually credited with originating the maxim that ""the only two certainties in life are death and taxes"" He was wrong since Twain never had the benefit of the wonders of the BBC Natural History Unit. Their certainty appears to be the complete inability to construct a bad series and in achieving the consistant feat of producing the most wonderful and lavish programmes which throughly inform and educate at the same time. This latest series is a variant on a theme since the ""Human Planet"" looks at us as a species particularly our behaviour in subsistence and fundamentally dangerous environments (with the exception of the last episode ""Cities"") where humans are most challenged by nature, eco systems or competition with other mammals and animals.

The Human Planet is a series packed with what television producers describe as the ""gawp factor"". It is beautifully filmed and the intriguing ""Behind the Lens"" segments to every programme show the scale of the logistical challenge for the BBC film crews and the lengths they go to for the perfect shot. The background to the technical filming of the Loatian fisherman Sam Nang in the episode River is as fascinating as Nangs own precarious shuffle on a old blue pair of flip flops across the raging torrent of the Mekong River below suspended on self strung wire. Likewise throughout the warm narration of actor John Hurt is excellent (although the dulcet tones of Sir David Attenborough are missed) while the dramatic music provided by Nitin Sawhney adds considerably to all the drama. But obviously the main stars are the eight programmes human subjects with massive highlights screaming out of every episode. Some of my favourites include the Algerian well diggers, the Inuit fishing for mussels under sea ice as the tide rushes back, the race against the elephants to a desert waterhole by a teenage cow herder Mamadou who battles against a huge bull elephant, the Dogon people of Mali in a huge scrum frantically fishing fish in the sacred water of Lake Antogo, the uneven match of three men against 15 hungry lions, the hugely colourful and often amusing Wodaabe men and their bird like courtship dance and most of all the brilliant episode on the Jungle including the death defying search for honey and the Papuan Korowai tribes massive feat of tree house building.

There are some faults in the series not least that the last episode ""Cities"" which while excellent seems slightly out of kilter with the rest of the series. It serves however as a fair warning never to eat fast food in certain parts of New York and who could not be struck by the frustrating and poignant portrayal of a poor women market trader in Jaipur and her struggle against a gang of thuggish and marauding Rhesus Macaque's. On a larger scale than this there has also been some debate and complaints about the level of animal bloodletting in the series and perhaps the warnings of this could be clearer at the start of the programmes. The hunt of sperm whale in the first episode ""Oceans"" may be disturbing to some viewers likewise the brutal capture and kill of a huge Greenland shark in the third episode who is fed to dogs. Yet this series serves to remind us that we are mammals that dwell in nature and not everyone has a local supermarket packed full of food nicely shrink wrapped/presented and almost divorced from any act of killing. The death of the sperm whale in particular is shown as an essential lifeline to the Indonesian villagers who take a maximum of six whales per year and battle the whale in wooden boats over an agonising eight hours. Some may argue that this doesn't make it right but it proves that for many humans their daily existence is a Darwinian challenge to survive.

For the technical amongst you the series is stunning to watch and filmed in High Definition 1080/16.9 although you need to carefully navigate the discs opening formats since you can find yourself unwittingly switching on (for me at least) a somewhat intrusive audio navigation. All in all this is a complete triumph for the BBC/Discovery Channel and even if you have seen the series on TV this Blu Ray set repays an immediate and more detailed second visit. This is a series filmed over four years and nearly a hundred locations which is destined to be weighed down and laden with awards. It is one which the BBC should be justifiably proud of since it is a fantastic television achievement and groundbreaking in scope, scale and ambition. The use of the word ""essential"" at this point almost seems superfluous, order it now.",1299283200,159,4581,4.788874841972187

How do they build their homes? What do they do for entertainment? Their must be so many amazing things to learn about people around the world, but I felt like I didn't really learn that much. It felt like most of the mini 10 minute episode had the same plot of ""Life is difficult and treacherous for this group. How will they get their protein to survive? Hooray, there is now a very dangerous or clever way for them to kill an animal or somehow use one to get food.""

This series is just captivating with the techniques and camera angles used, you sometimes have to wonder how they get the footage they do. Everytime I put this Blu-ray in, it just sucks me in. The diversity of the human species just amazes me and to be able to see how so many cultures live just fill me with a need for adventure and to see and experience more. So many people live in a bubble but there is so much to see and experience out there in the world and I hope this series will open people's mind to the lifestyle of others no matter how they choose to live.

4338115,4,B004EPYSBE,"This review will probably show up for all versions of Human Planet, which I think stinks.  (Come on Amazon, STOP DOING THAT.)
I'm reviewing the BLU-RAY version for Region A/1: North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia, it has eight parts and is narrated by John Hurt just like it was when it played on BBC.

Seeing what some people do every day to survive is jaw dropping.  Crossing the desert for days, counting SAND DUNES to navigate to an oasis, knowing if you make a mistake that everyone with you and your flock will die?  Scary.  Harvesting turtle eggs to protect them from predators so you can release them later on and hunt them when they have grown bigger?  Amazing.  Building bridges over raging rivers by training tree roots, knowing your dad started training you to work on the bridge he started when he was a child and knowing the job won't be completed in your lifetime?  Incredible.  And crossing a wire rope bridge wearing FLIP FLOPS over the worlds most powerful raging rapids just so you can get a fish to feed your family?  I was afraid to watch, yet he does this every day.

The usual production values we have come to expect from BBS are there in abundance, stunning visuals that make owning an HDTV worthwhile.

The only negative is the ""Special BD-Live added feature Zanskar, about the people of this remarkable land on the edge of the Himilayas"" will not stream, it says my Bluray player doesn't have an internet connection.  My PS3 is most certainly connected to broadband internet and streams  HD video from Amazon and Netflix without any issues.  But even if Human Planet didn't have problems streaming, I would much rather have the content I paid for be included on the disc itself.  Otherwise, you have no guarantee of getting it today, let alone in five or 50 years.

I took off one star for the streaming failure since I can't view one of the features, otherwise it would have been five stars.",1418342400,4,1999,4.64957264957265

Minus one star for that.
Otherwise it was well edited. John Hurt did an adequate narrative.
The ""behind the scenes"" footage was most interesting.
Human behaviour is well documented and unless you're young or uneducated, you know most of this stuff already.
Blue Planet, Frozen Planet, Africa, Planet Earth and Life are all much more interesting and entertaining.

However, the narrator is a British man named John Hurt. I was expecting the late finger-picking blues man Mississippi John Hurt to be the narrator. It took some time to get over the fact that it was not the blues player. After awhile I realized that a documentary like this just wouldn't be the same with someone other than some proper-sounding British bloke.

At the end of each DVD, there is a ""Behind the Lens"" segment. Those were strange because the British film crew seemed more bizarre than the tribes they were filming. The tribesmen were so comfortable while the Brits were awkward and high-maintenance. I hope they make another Human Planet that documents how strange British people are.",1390089600,,839,4.819444444444445

This is truly something to treasure, as many of the peoples' way of life documented in this program will fast become extinct with the continued encroachment of urbanization.

The BBC ""Masters"" of video documentation in HD presentations is, in itself, mind boggling.  The number of crews and trips made is so incredible, but so appreciated with the viewers in our home.

To be honest, I wasn't sure I wanted to watch humans in my wildlife mix, but BBC proved me wrong. Way wrong. I'm not sure how they come up with such diverse beings to film in this vast world, but they did a superb job of educating the masses of what life is like outside of the cities we live in. I envied the simplicity, was in awe of everyday dangers people faced in their own hometowns, was inspired by their perseverance and humanity. This is by far my favorite and they need to continue this series because, let's face it, we are everywhere. I love learning about new cultures and social structures, the similarities and differences to our own. And with Mother Nature as a background, the scenery is breathtaking. John Hurt does an amazing narration as well.

4338740,5,B004EPYSBE,"Human Planet is a wonderful documentary that celebrates the ingenuity and resourcefulness of the human species where it still exists in wild places. The photography and presentation is top notch, reminiscent of the BBC's flagship series Life and Frozen Planet. There is some recycled footage from earlier documentaries (most notably Planet Earth) for some sequences, but the vast majority of the footage is new and suitably spectacular--one of my favorite sequences involved a fly-by of a previously uncontacted human tribe in the rain forest. There are several necessarily violent depictions of animal hunts in this series, and while all of them are treated with the respect such a long-standing tradition deserves, some are quite gruesome and perhaps unsuitable for younger viewers.

In my opinion, there are a few faults with this series. The narration is well written and for the most part well delivered, even if after watching so many landmark series by David Attenborough every other British narrator just sounds like a guy trying desperately to be David Attenborough. The documentary also falters whenever the emphasis shifts from survival and resourcefulness to exploitation, especially in the last few episodes. I thought the sequence featuring a million-dollar cattle drive in Australia and several sequences after that were superfluous to the theme that drives the other episodes. The narration also actively demonizes plenty of species in the ""Cities"" episode, which I thought was rather anthropocentric and immature.

The special features on this blu-ray are decent, with the highlight being the making-of featurettes at the end of each episode. In a few cases I actually enjoyed them more than the main feature, especially the one that documented the scary struggle of the crew while filming in the Arctic.

I would recommend this series to anybody with a high-definition setup who enjoys learning about the natural world. Even though there are definite traces of hubris here and there, for the most part it is a humble look at how humans have struggled to make a living in the natural world.",1373241600,,2107,5.246290801186944

THIS WAS SORT OF JUST ONE SHOT SCENARIOS OF WHAT HAPPENED IN SOME AREAS OR WITH ONE SUBGROUP IN THE AREA.  NOT QUITE UP TO THE STANDARD 'PLANET EARTH' STUFF BUT STILL ENTERTAINING.

If you really are into footage and seeing some different lifestyles to survive in the planet this show was great.

4339354,4,B004EPYSBE,"If you like to see how various traditional societies around the world have done things in the past, and a very few still do, this series provides excellent hands on viewing. In most cases, you get just a snapshot of one particular unique aspect of a given culture, rather than a feel for the entire culture.  Also, each subdivision of topics includes a behind the scenes program describing the filming techniques and difficulties, etc., involved in making the program. A few of the topics  involve unusual activities or animals in modern cultures. Most, but not all of these, are found in the section on cities.  My favorite section, overall, is the cultures in jungles, mostly in the Amazon, Africa, and New Guinea.  Children search for the largest species of tarantula, then cook and eat it, being very careful to avoid and destroy by fire its dangerous easily dislodged body hairs.... Brazilian Matis demonstrate exceptional talent in designing their blowgun technology, then exceptional ability in locating and  stalking their prey, and exceptional  accuracy in hitting their target monkey, high up in the canopy....  A Papuan community demonstrates exceptional agility and ability in climbing tall trees, then constructing a tree house high enough to avoid many biting insects, evil spirits, and possible kidnappers below and to catch more breezes The higher the house, the greater the status of the builders. Sound familiar?  Elsewhere, a Tibetan father guides his children 60 miles up a very treacherous partly frozen  winter river, to their school. A cave serves to protect them at night from the frigid air, retaining some of the heat from their campfire... Then, Africans demonstrated how to catch fish on a speck of land at the lip of Victoria Falls, where others dare not venture ... As no guide of the topics covered came with the DVD set, I made my own guide, which I would like to reproduce here for the benefit of others. I counted 74 topics. Here goes:

  I discoverd that one of my friends from Flores, Indonesia, has been to the featured whale-hunting island of Lembata. She says sometimes they use poison-tipped harpoons to help subdue the whales, but difficult to find the rare source plant. Also, in some areas they cook in ovens dug into the hot volcanic soil. Also, in the program on Inuit fishing for the large Greenland shark, it wasn't mentioned that the flesh of this shark is poisonous due to the large amount of TMA oxide, which is converted by gut bacteria into the poisonous TMA, which is mainly responsible for the odor of decaying fish. Thus, the flesh must be processed by boiling in several changes of water, drying, or by fermenting rather like shown in the program on auks, to produce Hakari, considered a delicacy. The TMA oxide is important to the sharks to help protect their enzymes and cells from the deleterious effects of high water pressure, cold water, and high urea content of their blood.",1336780800,22,6455,5.327037773359841
4339355,3,B004EPYSBE,"I think that the producer bought footage from many different sources and put this together with only the most sensational parts. While fascinating and down-right wrenching on the tastebuds at times...it doesn't have as much in depth information about the cultures as I hoped (expected) there to be. I must add though that the scenes of small tribes that eat 1 whale a year was done really well for all the whale-loving viewers out there.
It really made me appreciate the concept, ""live simply so that other may simply live."" It in not as BBC-like
(brainiac) as I hoped. Scenes of what all people eat around the world was an eye opener. My mother, who is 70 years old, didn't finish it, and she is a retired nurse!",1334275200,2,713,4.578125

4339359,5,B004EPYSBE,"An incredible dvd set.  It was extremely well written, directed, edited, narrated, and filmed.  And what the film crews had to go through to bring such beautiful scenery, people, cultures, and wildlife to the screen is nothing less than amazing and awesome.  They endured extremely grueling, harsh, and dangerous situations in order to capture a moment of perfection to create a legacy for future generations when those things no longer exist.  The making of this set is just as awesome as viewing it.  I can't wait to sit through it again.",1329350400,2,540,4.8901098901098905

I have seen Life, Planet Earth, and Blue Planet.  While they are all spectacular, they have a ton of overlap that gets redundant, especially if you're watching them marathon style.  I was a bit worried this would have the recycled feel of some of the current BBC shows and Blurays.

This series is BRAND SPANKING NEW (at least to me) and you'll be surprised every single time.

Just buy it you won't regret it.  I saw the Oceans episode and had my mouth open for maybe 50 of the 60 min.

4339446,5,B004EPYSBE,"I am a nature documentary junky, and the BBC documentaries are the tops in the business.  However, when I saw The Human Planet, I thought, ""I don't want to see PEOPLE, I want to see nature.""  I put off watching this show because of that misguided line of thinking.  Finally, I decided to give it a go.  I am here to say it's the best nature documentary I've ever seen.  The word that comes to mind repeatedly with every episode is ""inspiring.""  I am truly inspired by how people have faced the struggles of existence in the harshest of environments on the planet and scratched out a living.  When I see young women traveling 20 miles through endless desert to fill their water containers, young children going into the jungle to find and cook their own food, families living in a tree house 100 feet in the air, 3 defenseless men who scare off a pride of lions from their hard earned kill to steal enough meat to feed their families, and an elderly woman who is carried 10km on the back of a neighbor to have cataract surgery to restore her eyesight--I am inspired and humbled by the courage and tenacity of humans living on the edge of survival.  To be sure, there will be images that will make you uncomfortable (the hunt for narwhal whales, for example).  However, to sit in our warm living rooms and pass judgement on those who fight incredible odds for survival is simply arrogant. But those images are a small part of the story.  Each episode is beautifully shot--the photography is INCREDIBLE--and wonderfully told.

This is the finest efforts of the BBC.",1326499200,6,1562,4.562724014336918

But after watching the first disc focusing on 3 areas of the planet, I was wowed at how awesome this series really is! This is a must see to all of those who love the BBC series Planet Earth or Life. Truly breathtaking camera work! At the end of each episode, it gives a behind the scenes look at the challenges of filming the people in their habitat. Buy this series, you will not regret it.",1326153600,,523,4.137254901960785

The filming is beautiful, the scenes are extraordinary, and the vastly different people are relatable to the viewer/observer.  ""Human Planet"" uses exquisite HD filming and sweeping shots of people performing ordinary and extraordinary tasks.
  Having studied anthropology I acknowledge that this series is beautiful, yet it does not go into as much detail as other ethnographic productions.  The producers were more interested in capturing particular events than showing the day-to-day aspects of other cultures and persons.  I gave this series 4 stars because it succeeds in making anthropology accessible, exciting, and relevant to a large audience.  However, If the producers, photographers, and researchers acknowledged their own prejudices/biases I may have given this series five stars.  Though each episode is followed by a ""behind the lens"" short feature (somewhat ""raw footage"" of the crew), Human Planet still seems to exploit the people it observes.  For example, in one ""behind the lens"" the subject-person was asked to repeat a daring and dangerous tightrope walk several times just so the producers/videographers could capture the perfect shot.  In contrast, a different ""behind the lens"" showed a researcher participating in an event, and it documented his personal observations and experiences.

  To summarize:  This series provides countless examples of the remarkable ways people survive, thrive, and interact with nature.  I enjoyed this series but I wish the producers/videographers were more explicit in their personal biases.  The filming is beautiful, but a drawback may be that the filming is too polished and heavily edited.  Unfortunately, this series does little in the way of contextualizing its subjects's cultures, societies, tribes, and the individuals' characteristics.  Perhaps the ""Human Planet"" team would have benefited from reading&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Return-to-Laughter-An-Anthropological-Novel-The-Natural-History-Library/dp/0385053126/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Return to Laughter: An Anthropological Novel (The Natural History Library)</a>",1325116800,3,2620,7.423948220064725

Then they keep stabbing it for 10 hours and bring it home to eat! This one guy climbs up these huge trees and just starts getting stung by tons of bees!

4339534,5,B004EPYSBE,"When I saw the BBC Earth stamp on this DVD, I immediately assumed that it had to do with nature and animals.  Being a fan of David Attenborough, I could not understand why he was not involved but regardless I still got the DVDs since I have seen every single BBC Earth production and did not think that this would be any less amazing. This is a documentary in regard to humans and different cultures in the most remote places on this planet earth and relationships that they have created with nature and other humans for survival and pleasure with the simplest tools available to them. As an avid documentary watcher, I have never ever come across a documentary that it takes you to so many remote places on planet earth and captures cultures that it will have you glued to the TV unlike any documentary, suspense drama or what ever genera that you would want to define it as with a high quality production, beautiful music and cinematography. It is amazing how these tribes survive on water, land, mountains, deserts, frozen planes, etc. Next time when Forbes does an article for the best tree houses, they need to visit these tribes where homes are built 100 feet in the air, above the jungle floor without any tools with nothing other than the leaves and branches of the surrounding trees with the whole families and pets living in those homes, content with the daily struggles of life. It shows tribes who actually walk into 15 huge lions with blood all over their faces, feasting over a kill just to steal the kill from the lions. This documentary should air in every high school so kids would truly understand the meaning of happiness and being content without any material possession. The saddest part is that the producers do not caption the name of the places as they go from a spot to spot so that way not only the interested parties can educate themselves furthermore on the Internet and if needed, visit those unbelievable places as they wish eventhough it would be absolutely impossible. another quality BBC production.

Instead of focussing on various aspect of how humans live around the world, this documentary series highlight humans killing endangered, highly intelligent animals in horrific ways. Watch a sperm whale take hours to die. Watch rare narwhals suffer violent deaths far worse than any other predator would imagine inflicting. Horribly gory and disgusting. I kept hoping they'd show these people getting a taste of their own medicine. This series is nothing like Life or Planet Earth. It is almost exclusively about people torturing and killing (usually slowly) a wide variety of animals including some that are endangered or that there are international laws against hunting. Instead of assisting the sperm whale hunters, those filming this should have contacted Greenpeace to put a stop to what they were doing.

Instead, the series does something equally valuable, and more suitable for a general family audience - it shows the amazing diversity of ways people have adapted to diverse environments around the world, and the deep local knowledge and how-to skill they've gained in the process.  If you've been sheltered and have only one perspective on what human life is, this series has the potential to blow your mind wide open via a sequence of serious culture shocks.  Even with my background of dabbling in cultural anthropology for the past two decades, I finished each episode with my jaw having dropped multiple times.

4339596,5,B004EPYSBE,"Beast & Being....(one ""sapien"" each).  Let's teach Anthropology in Kindergarten and Middle School and High School on this theme of beastly reality and being reality. (Another way of saying Good & Evil).  That way we could even bring god back into the classroom intelligently.  Now we know that god is even a science so there will be a course one day: ""The Science of God"" about the absolute reality of god in the human experience and in human anatomy. Just as we teach and tell the students young and old about war.  [Anthropology is my passion.  It saved me from a lifetime of confusion so I praise the possibilities of making the curricula even better because the school was founded on ethnocentricism but now we can develop the Science of Anthropologic to help us move forward in the Human Universe.]

ABOUT THE DRAMATIC DOCUMENTARY: ""THE HUMAN PLANET""--Everybody seem to be put on an even plane as a human with human events and I like that. It brings home the message that humans live all sorts of ways in all sorts of environments. but even so, people are people and will have a basic human life no matter where they live and how they live.  It's a reminder to us all in the ""developed world"" what life is really like and that LIFE IS LIFE everywhere to all life--it is the same, but we can create events to live; we can develop traditions, design fashions, write comedy, sing and dance and make music forms but still LIFE IS LIFE everywhere in all life forms. And I think that all life-forms try as hard as we do to make their living better in their environments as we do.  Apparently, creating a ""better"" way to live is a hard sale to most humans since so few live the highly ""developed"" living styles in cities and civilization.  But then, somebody said, ""The natural-livers have freedom, real freedom, like in the open, in the wild, carefree, really, really free."" [That person was likely thinking of taxes.] The natural-livers may be free and all but they are hungry most days, but then we, the innovative-livers eat too much anyway.

The natural-livers are most concerned about survival not so much about being comfortable or cute but they do have their sense of beauty and can go overboard at times like we do, but healthcare is not an issue; village members will take care of them.  If the problem goes away then it goes away but if it doesn't they are disabled or they die.  In natural life death is a common companion.  But we innovative-livers, we believe in a concept called 'healthy' and 'healthy living' and we live our lives by these principles and practices but if we do not have enough money we suffer and succumb to death from illness and if we don't have family because we have not practiced family values above all else, we meet death seemingly alone but we are never alone.

These are the terms of life, not just human life but life itself!  And it is to be lived however it is lived, however one gets on, because we all have our turns in and around misery and disasters, but then love, compassion and kindness too..--MO",1315267200,,3046,4.553113553113553

4339599,5,B004EPYSBE,"There have already been some excellent reviews posted, so I'll be brief:

Visually stunning, this series shows how humans have adapted to survive in the most inhospitable and difficult environments on Earth. For anyone interested in documentaries of the world around us, this is a top-quality BBC production. Included in the boxed DVD set are episodes showcasing Oceanic, Jungle, Arctic, River, Desert, Mountain, Grassland and City cultures. Every episode might not be your cup of tea (I personally found the City episode to be less interesting than the others, though ymmv), but as a whole, the series paints an amazing picture of the ingenuity we have been endowed with as a race. (It also paints an amazing picture of how, even in the most primitive of places, we humans have the capacity to take advantage of each other.)

As it's from the BBC, the series does not shy away from nudity or sexual topics - though they're in no way 'waved in front of your face'. (Which i applaud - to be human is to possess the equipment and drives necessary for making more humans, and this is a series about humanity.) The only reason I mention this is because many people might look to purchase this for viewing with young children. Be warned that you will probably have to explain a few things to your kids as they watch this series. This bothers me in no way, but there might be more conservative Amazon members reading this review. (E.g., the puritans who successfully campaigned to have parts of the ""Walking With Beasts"" series blurred out.)

A monumental work of modern anthropology, and highly recommended.",1314057600,,1602,4.818181818181818

4339707,2,B004EPYSBE,"This is written after watching the Oceans segment, the first of eight. (Other segments are on mountains, grasslands, cities, etc.)

I was deeply disappointed at what was chosen -- or not chosen -- to be shared with the audience. It was, for me, a simple-minded glorification of the ""noble savage"" and his ""wisdom"":
-- Indonesian natives harpooning a whale
-- another native lassoing a shark (and then righteously releasing it)
-- surfing in Hawaii
-- deep diving without air in the Philippines
-- homes built in shallow ocean waters on stilts (around Indonesia, I think)

Are these not trivial interactions of mankind and the planet's oceans? Have not many been already filmed, and filmed better? For example, ENDLESS SUMMER, made in 1966, on surfing, or BLUE PLANET, on the beauty of our oceans.

I submit that far more relevant would have been to show us factory fishing ships and the destructive impact of their astonishing hauls. Or talk about container ships and their impact on the world's economy. Show us the polluting of the seas. Tell us about the influence of the oceans on worldwide commerce and weather.

Instead we're shown impoverished Filipino divers in their overfished waters.

What a wasted opportunity to educate us.

Update: I've since watched the entire series and am sad to report the perspective above is carried throughout. Simplistic episodes centered on a handful of people who are scarcely typical of humanity. The segment on the exterminator team in NYC was especially inane: two guys acting excited at catching rats even though it's part of their job and they probably catch rats every day.

The photography, let it be said, was excellent, but is matched in superb films like WILD CHINA, PLANET EARTH or KOYAANISQATSI. Still, it keeps this review from being just one-star.

Finally, a special place in Hell must go to the executive who decided that when each disc starts up, we are forced to watch about ten minutes of BBC commercials, with no way to get past them to the disc menu. Haven't we paid for the film? Shouldn't we be given the option to not watch the commercials?

I am reviewing the Blu-ray version, so the above comment about commercials may not apply to the DVD. The content of HUMAN PLANET, however, will be the same: off-target, a missed opportunity, in the end a waste of our time.",1309651200,15,2329,4.846347607052897

4339755,5,B004EPYSBE,"...perhaps Amazon should create a 6th star category for series like this one. Outstanding and it shows life as it is out here away from the developed world. In the third, sometimes fourth, world I live in it's all about survival and life can be too short for many people. Their daily existence sometimes depends on the kindness of others and usually what they can grow for themselves.

This series also shows what I see every day at it's most extreme and illustrates how in some parts of the world, humans still live in concert with nature. It goes on to warn us about what happens when that balance is upset and although well intentioned, development & 'progress' almost always affect traditional cultures in terrible ways. Over-population in the third world, the alarming deforestation across much of Africa, the pillaging of the resources, depletion of fish stocks, garbage, and the total lack of concern for nature in some parts of the world will eventually affect those who come after us.

And, the lack of respect by some important elected officials towards improving the environment is utterly depressing and will have hugely negative affects on countries around the world. If you think it's bad now just wait until 2025 when some of the most impoverished countries in the world will nearly double their populations from 2010 figures (for instance - some experts predict that one in four people in the world will be living on Africa continent by around 2050). Their much depleted natural resources are already in a negative decline and in some countries in Africa it will become even worse than it is today. For instance, in Ethiopia, by some estimates only three (3) percent of the trees that existed 35 years ago are still there. Entire hillsides have now been stripped of their foliage which has led to big problems with erosion, desertification, and etc. Meanwhile, unchecked population growth across the continent means that humans will take more and give back less (usually nothing) to replinish nature for the next generations.

So, I recommend that you watch this series to see where humankind currently is as it relates to managing its natural resources (a snap shot in time). Then, sit down with your grandchildren a decade, or two, from now and see if its gotten better or worse. I predict worse for the third world.",1308787200,4,2334,4.8740554156171285

Yet, somehow, as you travel through continents and environments, you soon start to expect a rather unpleasant pattern. At the beginning of each story, you find yourself wondering: 'OK, which animal are we going to kill this time, and in what clever way?' No, I'm not one of those animal-protecting nuts, I'm not a vegetarian, I'm not one to turn the blind eye to the killing that eating requires. But when you start dreading the next chapter because so many of them are painful to look at, you just have to wonder why you're watching this DVD. Honestly, weren't there other feats and achievements to focus on? The few stories that don't involve animal killing are so much more fascinating (fixing the mud mosque, crossing the Mekong on a rope, building amazing tree houses, tracking water under the desert, facing a frozen river to get to school...).

First of all, it doesn't live up to the production value of either Planet Earth or Life, two fantastic series. Moreover, the content is frivolous. I thought the premises of the vignettes would give fascinating insight into the human species, over-population, social and cultural impacts the planet; instead, it spotlights arbitrary stories of people who've found innovative ways to fish for food in unpredictable rivers and oceans and urban pigeon-taming experts. Somewhat interesting, yes, but such a teensy slice of human life. Perhaps some bigger picture stuff could have been added while the smaller stories would act as supplement. Disappointed!",1306713600,14,790,5.430894308943089
4339884,5,B004EPYSBE,"When it comes to documentary series, BBC has always met and exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend it. Watch it and you are going to put life in perspective.",1306627200,2,163,4.655172413793103
4339885,4,B004EPYSBE,"My family and I are really enjoying the videos.  It's a nice break to have humans more involved, this time as the subject.  It's ""only"" 1080i, but I find the quality very very high on our 42"" tv.  Having enjoyed David Attenborough, I was worried about John Hurt's narrative abilities.  My worries were unfounded.  Mr. Hurt does a terrific job!

The only reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is the pandering to ""climate change"" for hardships people face.",1306368000,,461,4.62962962962963
4339886,5,B004EPYSBE,This is a well done documentary. The material is fascinating and the cinematography is excellent. I found it also to be relevant in showing the contentment and happiness gained from living a simple life in direct connection with Nature. The film consistently made mention of how our overuse of resources is devastating the planet and showed sane and beautiful alternatives to this way of life. It is an important message in today's complex and consumer driven world. I also appreciated the segments at the end of each episode showing how the film was constructed. It was informative and provided a nice counterpoint to the lives of indigenous people. I highly recommend this film and would welcome seeing more of its kind.,1306368000,2,722,4.975206611570248
4339887,5,B004EPYSBE,"I actually saw a part of the Human Planet on television and I was already sold to get the video.  Sunday is family night and I showed the first DVD.  My parents, who are quite elderly, were so amazed.  It was far beyond their bedtime so I promised to show them more.  I must say the BBC has remarkable footage and they surely take chances.  Whoever plans to purchase this DVD, it is so well worth the buy.  You won't be sorry.

Aloha from Hawaii.

4339888,1,B004EPYSBE,I ordered it before it was even released and was looking forward to the experience. Unfortunately the set I recieved at $32.99 was badly damaged. It skipped terribly and for the most part did not have sound. I have a new very good Blu Ray player and have had no problems with anything else. I am hesitant to order another set from this source.,1306022400,3,343,4.375
4339889,2,B004EPYSBE,"This beautifully made movie was much more than I had expected.  It certainly had the panoramic images I was looking forward to, but it also included a great deal of violence.  I skipped though too many of the 80 stories to avoid the unnecessary violence.  Okay, we all know animals kill other animals in persuit of dominence or for food.  We know humans have always killed animals for a variety of reasons.  But I am weary of the trend of permeating nature movies with a heavy dose of blood.",1306022400,13,491,4.47191011235955
4339890,5,B004EPYSBE,"Very well selected stories, stuning , amazing and excellently presented. Good narative materials and narator. Provided you with exceptionally stories of human survival and adaptation to extreamly tough and impossible environments.  You will understand limit of human's tolerance and persistance much better.  Various rites and traditions of many unfamiliar people are both entertaining and mind boggling.  Really worth the cost and time spent, excellent works of many daring production teams.",1305849600,,492,6.0
4339891,5,B004EPYSBE,"I have thoroughly enjoyed watching Human Planet, and was as impressed with it as I was Planet Earth and Life. It takes us throughout the world into different remote cultures that live amongst the water, the arctic, the mountains, the grasslands, the deserts, and the rivers. It shows you how these cultures interact with nature. I would advise those who are sensitive to animal death that there is a lot of hunting in this series (some episodes may not be the best for children). However, that is life, and that is how these cultures must survive. I would recommend this DVD to anyone, I was very happy that I bought it, and everyone that I have showed it to thus far has been as impressed as I was. It is very educational and shows you cultural lifestyles that you would have never known exist (I am an anthropologist, and I learned A LOT from this series!). I cannot wait to buy the next BBC series, whatever that may be, as they keep coming out with excellent additions to my collection. Highly recommended!",1305763200,,1010,4.554945054945055
4339892,5,B004EPYSBE,"I was absolutely blown away by this series.  The cinematography is amazing, the musical score is perfect, and the vignettes into the lives of people are fascinating.  Each section on a person/people/people group was based on people living on the same Earth as me and yet living in a completely different world than my middle class, Midwestern USA lifestyle.  I could not recommend this series more highly, especially for anyone intestested in people groups around the world, and how they interact with our natural world.  Bravo, BBC!  Well done!",1305072000,2,545,5.078651685393258
4339893,4,B004EPYSBE,"Like Planet Earth before it, Blue Planet, Wild China etc.. the cinematography can not be faulted. Always first class. I also think the choice of John Hurt as narrator is excellent, and the occasional music very well selected.

All in all 5 stars apart from my half star gripe.

Quite often I'd hear myself thinking ""I've seen this before"" and I had. There is obviously some re-use going on, where they BBC has re-edited previous locations shootings now biased toward the human aspect. In itself not a bad thing but I felt some amount of disappointing ""I know what happens next"" feelings.

A nice plus are the how it was filmed segments that highlight some of the dangers and difficulties these crews had to undertake so that a lazy bugger like me can criticize them.

I won't go into any more detail on content as a number of others already have. Certainly a welcome addition to my ""Will watch more than once"" shelf.",1304899200,15,916,4.601226993865031
