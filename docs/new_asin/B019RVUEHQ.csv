7581520,2,B019RVUEHQ,"*My prefatory pledge to the Amazon reader: I will not intentionally create double meanings, cute rhymes and puns, or ""jokes"" that would serve no purpose for the potential moviegoer or be of any help to a filmmaker who was no doubt in a state of ecstatic satisfaction about every fame selected for the final print only to be perplexed at the public's indifference.

The director is clearly a professional filmmaker; he's found a colorful, varied and cooperative cast of relatable, ""real life"" actors; and, not least of all, he's been given a subject that guarantees a receptive audience (excluding, of course, anyone who chooses not to watch the film because of its subject).  So what exactly went wrong, leading to mostly negative reviews?

1. The plan is formulaic, pat, fail-safe--and every viewer senses as much within the first 20 minutes. Director rounds up about 8 groups--young and old, men and women, tyros and experts--simply be certain that all are conversant with the subject (but no vulgarity or profanity).  Now all the filmmaker figures he has to do is jump from one group to another, then again--and again after that.  Once the viewer catches on to this familiar gimmick, the show's over.  He's thinking: ""This movie is getting dull--and over-long. Why did I start this?"")  Even the maker of a successful documentary needs to think about things like exposition, development, climax and denouement--or there's no show, regardless of subject.

2. Mr. Methane is the director's star witness--or is he? The director seems to think so. But a little of Mr. Methane goes a long way.  The director apparently thinks he needs to show this exhibitionist performing ""at his best / worst"" from the opening scene in order to ""hook"" the audience.  A miscalculation.  Save him for the very end--and for no more than a single scene or two. Making the audience return to his foul ""art"" (the performer's term) is bad enough without repeating the identical shot each time.

3. Some re-editing (and deletion of repetitious, tedious footage) would definitely make a difference for the better--but not better enough.  The filmmaker has made two critical misjudgments: 1. he's overestimated, by a wide margin, the entertainment / informative value of his cast members' contributions; 2. he's underestimated, by an even wider margin, the savvy of his audience. For all of the biological, sociological, scientific dimensions of the film's subject, the truth of the matter is that, as far as most viewers are concerned, the film tells/shows us nothing that we don't already know. (At least one of the ""experts"" reminds us that the best writer / humorist in the English language when it comes to such bodily functions Jonathan Swift (though Chaucer's ""The Miller's Tale"" can give any writer from any century strong competition for first-place honors.

Of course, many viewers are not drawn to the movie expecting to learn something.  It may seem like a good way to exercise the body on a treadmill without taxing the mind. Or many viewers, without realizing it, might be drawn to the film's subject by its nostalgic properties.  Who among us doesn't remember how easily entertained we were by the subject for the first 5-6 years of our lives? Simply pronouncing the word was enough to keep us in high spirits for the longest road trips.  Or perhaps 45 years ago we saw Mel Brooks' ""Blazing Saddles"" when we were in our 20s and, on this memorable occasion, we for once felt young, energetic and ""good""--content with our humanity and alleviated of the stress of trying to figure out what we would do with our lives.  And even if the nostalgic experience was one of pain, isn't it a good feeling, now that we're older and wiser, to acknowledge how wrong we were to blame a romantic date-gone -wrong on the embarrassing incident that ""announced itself,"" exposing our humanity at the most inopportune moment?

At the risk of seeming too harsh on the film and its director, i was incredulous to hear Mr. Methane opine that he was probably the only person in the world capable, after much rigorous practice, of performing his profession at will.  Tell that to anyone who attended college when there were men's dorms and girl's dorms, and never did the twain meet (""panty raids"" were discussed, but never acted on). leaving out the life and ritualistic combativeness of the carnival acts, the howling of young men gone bonkers at this strange demonstration of superior musicianship and control,  the triumph of the scatological over the eschatological themes of our required religion courses (which were my favorite, though it took John Osborne's ""Luther"" to bring the two similar-sounding names together). Or, check out ""Call the Midwife,"" the most powerful, deeply affecting current television drama (the incident relevant to the present topic is in Season 2, Episode 1).

Recently, at a half-century reunion of my fraternity, I was eagerly sought out by another resident of the 2nd floor of Andreen Hall, where we were sophomores. To my surprise (and mortification) he was depending on me to verify to his wife stories about undergraduate college life in a men's dorm during that time.  I said as little as possible to maintain the credibility of practices that apparently required only a second witness's testimony.  I was never fearful of implication in such vulgar behavior.  I ddn't drink, smoke or cuss--I was just another P.K., envious of all the free and secular types who could finish off one of the new large bottles of carbonated soda (12 oz. instead of the traditional 6) and then alleviate any unwanted pressure with a maneuver I have yet to learn: they could perform what some call a ""burp""--but the more athletic types seemed to prefer the term ""belch.""  By any name, it's a skill well worth learning--but apparently an impossibility for some of us.

At least the gas produced by belching is not, unlike intestinal gas, inflammable.  Toward the end of the movie, a scientist hesitates before stating the obvious! Yes, methane gas--humanly-sourced or otherwise--is inflammable.  But again the movie stops short of the more important story: it's also dangerous!  As more than one performer discovered, it can inflict internal pain upon the auto-pyrotechnician foolish enough to practice it.  Even Sister Evangelina knows as much and warns against lighting a match.",1473811200,,6359,5.010446343779677
7581521,2,B019RVUEHQ,"Like the subject matter itself, it runs dry after a while. This would be a great documentary if it concluded in 15 minutes. That's about the extent to which this material works. So much of it it consumed by a married couple. Not sure why? Perhaps they're related to the producer or director?

7581955,2,B019RVUEHQ,"I thought a documentary about farting would be a whole lot more interesting and hilarious than this turned out to be. The problem is that it goes on for way too long, and it's mostly the same bunch of people sitting around talking about the same things (growing up and how acceptable farting was) over and over again.

It appears to be thinly researched and mostly devoid of historical, cultural, or scientific educational content. Instead, it spends too much time on family members and friends of the Hales (producers) talking about farting and growing up: the Hale grandparents, the Hale children, a group of 3 male friends, a group of 5 female friends, and a British couple in a car. It also shows Mr. Methane way too many times. He's a British professional farter. Yes, we get it. He makes a living doing this. It was funny the first 2 times he farts, but it gets old very fast seeing him do the same thing over and over again. I found all these people very repetitious and boring.

The most interesting person in the documentary is the doctor, John Wycoff, whose dry and clinical responses to the questions I found to be amusing and informative. There's a parody ""gas driven car"" commercial thrown in, as well as music video intercut into the documentary. The video is just stupid. While the actress in it is stunning, it adds no value to the documentary. It's not even funny. 30 minutes could've been trimmed from this film. It did not need to be over an hour.

Here's what I wanted from this documentary (and any documentary):

Scientific illustrations, animations, and infographics, scientists or physicians talking about the science of farting, the social and historical aspects of farting through the centuries. The film touched briefly on an Edo period Japanese scroll (from 1800's or earlier), which I thought was fascinating, but glossed over it. The film didn't even mention the name of the scroll. It's a real missed opportunity to inject much needed historical knowledge and humor, so I googled it. The thing is called He-gassen (""Fart competition"") and it's absolutely hilarious! The whole digitized scroll is on Wikipedia, and you can google ""rocket news fart battle"" for a detailed scene by scene explanation of it. Believe me, you'll want to see. It's got horses being farted on and trees being blown over.

I didn't learn anything new from this so-called documentary. How about ways to hide a fart noise, or origin of the ""pull my finger"" gag? The Hales had a real opportunity to make this educational and fun, but instead it's incredibly boring and long-winded (pun intended). Don't waste your time. Watch SciShow or any of the numerous channels/videos on YouTube instead, like ZeFrank's ""True Facts about the ...."" or ""How to escape a fart"" (from a Japanese variety TV show). They are far more interesting and educational.",1469232000,10,2845,4.845679012345679
