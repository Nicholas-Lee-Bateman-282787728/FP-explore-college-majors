8220943,4,B000W110HY,"I wanted to set this up on an LCD screen in the front window - sort of a supplimental decoration.  This worked so well, including the portrait format.  One little snag that got me (my playback machine is a Mac) - the main screen to start playing lacks a nagivation link to easily start the playback, so I had to switch to a different player that allowed a different type of control to get the thing started playing!  Kinda crazy, but a minor snag that took me a good 10m to figure out how to get it to go.  Otherwise, very nice!  There is a fair chunk of really scary images mixed in randomly and lightly - in-short, I would say the content is safe for 10y and older if you were going to let them watch it voluminously (like background decoration at home for a party, per-se.)",1292889600,6,776,4.216216216216216
