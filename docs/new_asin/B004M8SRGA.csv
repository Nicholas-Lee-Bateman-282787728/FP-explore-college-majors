8435701,5,B004M8SRGA,"All politics is local, said the late Tip O'Neill. Travis Irvine offers ample evidence of that in this short documentary of his efforts to become mayor of a small Ohio town. Irvine lost his bid for the office but used his run to increase awareness about a city zoning plan that would devastate his neighborhood. And there lies the powerful lesson in participatory democracy.",1507766400,,373,4.84375
8435702,5,B004M8SRGA,"Travis takes the sometimes seemingly murky arena of politics and makes it clear, understandable and dynamic.  People who previously may have believed themselves unable to get involved in the political process can see clearly through this documentary that no single factor is more important than the desire to make change.  Great Documentary Travis!",1505865600,,348,5.547169811320755
8435703,5,B004M8SRGA,Travis Irvine shows that politics can be humorous even when the mountain in front of you is so high that the peak can't be seen.,1505779200,,128,4.16
8435704,4,B004M8SRGA,"Small-town politics might not initially seem like interesting film fodder, but ""American Mayor"" will keep you glued to the screen.  It is a small but brilliant film; it treads a good balance of funny, serious, entertaining, and endearing. The picture itself is incredibly well put-together, especially for an independent film.  You really start to root for Mr. Irvine to win the election despite the odds, and the fact that it's a true story just makes the tension even thicker.  Overall, a solid film.",1297641600,,502,5.024096385542169
