4838908,4,B005MXQD4W,"This is a great bargain - but let me emphasize, if you are not British, a lot of it will go over your head (like Rumpole). It is good, action-packed stuff with great acting. Also it provides an interesting view of British society and the rigid militaristic class values. I would rate about 8 of the movies as really enjoyable. Operation Amsterdam is my favorite. Well worth the price.",1350777600,,384,4.579710144927536
4838909,4,B005MXQD4W,"These are better than average films, not just B-movies. They are uniformly (pardon the pun) of high quality, both in content and in transfer quality. I have, in past, purchased collections that are of far lower quality in both these areas. These are well directed, well written and well acted, some better than a few, but all surprisingly good. The weaker ones have some plot contrivance and brief use of stock war footage, but not so much as to detract from the overall quality. Most are remarkably good. An excellent choice for any fan of british and/or war films or for persons who just enjoy a ""jolly good show.""",1341360000,27,616,4.660550458715596
4838910,5,B005MXQD4W,"I found this at Sam's Club for $16 and have watched one movie so far and have upped
this from a 3 (because I knew nothing about them) to a 4 based solely on this first
movie.  Appointment with Venus is a lovely little story about rescuing a cow from
the Channel Islands.  It sounds stupid, but is a very entertaining movie on the resistance
movement.  Glynis Johns steals the show as she rescues the pregnant cow while David Niven
is running around dodging Germans.  If I find two more movies this entertaining in the
batch, I'll up it to a 5.  10 movies for under $20 is a deal, especially if there are
some gems and I've already found one.

UPDATE:  I'm now 3 movies into it.  Operation Amsterdam was also very entertaining. Eva Bartok
doing something nearly autobiographical as the Dutch woman conscripted to help the Brits
get the diamonds to London.  One more good one and it becomes a 5 star.  The Wind Cannot
Read is a love story that happens to be set in the war - get out the hankies, but not what
I was looking for in this set.

UPDATE 2:  Now 5 movies into it.  After reading the comment and noting the IMDB rating, I decided
to let Theirs is the Glory sit until last, so I moved to on to disc 3.  Secret Mission just
didn't do it for me, seemed slow and James Mason with a French accent was hard to swallow.
It's about Brits in France doing espionage.  However, The Flemish Farm was another movie I
thoroughly enjoyed.  It's about the remanant of the Belgium Air Force fleeing to Britain and
then returning to a farm to recover their flag.  Based upon true events, a sad story that brings
home the importance of symbols.  Clive Brook gets top billing but Clifford Evans is really the lead.
Good enough to up the set to a 5 and I still have the top 5 by IMDB standards ahead of me.

UPDATE 3:  Now 7 movies in.  The Day Will Dawn was another entertaining movie but it was more like
Hollywood and Errol Flynn than a British movie.  In the first half hour the playboy track handicapper
gets into a bar room brawl and Shanghaied.  He eventually returns to Norway to help find the German
sub base - complete with last minute rescue.  Seven Thunders is really just another romance with two
escaped British POW's waiting to leave Marsailles with an interesting little twist on their alternate
escape plan.  So as of now I'd say, four I enjoyed, two romances (decent if that's your thing) and
only one I didn't think held up.

UPDATE 4:  9 movies in.  Unpublished Story stars Richard Greene (Robin Hood on TV in the 1950's).
It takes place during the Battle of Britain and deals with German spies in London.  As a newspaperman
caught up in the middle of it all, Greene cannot publish his story.  I believe 2000 Women may be my
favorite of all.  Brits caught in France at the outbreak of the war and put up in a posh hotel.  Great
subplot about a nun who's gonna be shot by the French for spying only to be rescued by the German
takeover and it's all a big mistake.  The men show up in the form of downed flyers trying to get home.
Two more in the plus column, I'm gonna have to give Mr. Mason a second chance.

""Operation Amsterdam"" with Peter Finch had a fascinating storyline, and again was something we didn't know about.  ""Theirs Is the Glory"" was the story about the British in Anherne but told with people who actually had participated in the event.  It was more documentary in production.  Surely it was inspiration for the movie done much later, ""A Bridge Too Far.""  ""Seven Thunders"" with Stephen Boyd portrayed Marseilles during the occupation and that hasn't been shown that much.

Appointment with Venus - a comedy drama about an operation to rescue a prize cow from German hands in an occupied channel island

Worth the price as others have said.  Here are some thoughts on each movie.  I think it is important to have good - morally good - entertainment available.  This group of movies meets that standard.

Appointment With Venus (Island Rescue)  1951 2
David Niven, Glynis John, Kenneth Moore
Silly humor.  Some good acting.  Tenuous stretched unrealistic plot.  Neither the seriousness of war nor that of a relationship between a man and a woman is done well.

The Wind Cannot Read  1958 2
Dirk Bogard, Yoko Tani, Ronald Lewis
Corny play on interracial issues between English flier and Japanese teacher in Burma

Operation Amsterdam 1959  4.5
Peter Finch, Eva Bartok, Tony Britton
Very good acting. Plot is realistic taken from an actual event.

Theirs Is the Glory  1956 [1946]  4
Stanley Maxfed, Thomas Sculion, Allan Wood, British 1st  Abn Div
Re-enactment of the Battle of Arnhem in Holland done just after the war ended by the actual survivors of that battle

The Day Will Dawn  1942
Deborah Kerr, Ralph Richardson, male lead
Richardson has a very short appearance in this movie.  The male lead delivers a forgettable performance as a handsome loose living, wealthy society person who has become a newspaper reporter.  He is a protg of Richardson who help him to become the newspapers reported in Norway before the Germans invade.  Incredibly the lead charater is talked into parachuting into Norway  without any prior training.  Deborah Kerr is the romantic lead and is the daughter of a Norweigan fisherman (the powerful elderly Welch fisherman from I Know Where Im Going).  Long story short male lead saves the day and carried off Deborah Kerr to England with the expressed desire to return after the Nazis have been defeated.

Seven Thunders (The Beasts of Marseilles)  1957
Stephen Boyd, James Robertson Justice, Peter Ustinov, a French actress
This movie analyzes the moral corruption present in Marseilles, France in 1943 from the standpoint of 1957, when the movie was made.  Moral values of every sort came under great strain during the War that took 60 million lives.  The reverberations of this event are still with us.
Two British soldiers have escaped from an Italian POW camp.  They arrive in Marseilles and are awaiting a French fishing boat Captains offer to get them back to England so that they can re enter the fight.  Boydd character (he exhibits the same character traits and tics here as he did in Ben Hur and The Man Who Never Was} becomes involved with a young woman abandoned by her mother.  This is the romantic piece that holds the plot together.  Unfortunately in the end the relationship seems to trivialize the monstrous events and behaviors the movie has shown un occurring in Marseilles in 1943 German occupied France.  The analysis of moral climate here reminds me of The Third Man with Joseph Cotton and Orson Wells which analyzes the moral climate in Vienna just after the war.  We see nihilism in flower after the events of the war in the Third Man.  In Seven Thunders it is still germinating.

Unpublished Story  1942  3
Richard Greene, Vallerie Hobson
Slow starting until the thesis of the story begins more than half of the way through.  Some good acting.  Fifth column concerns in England.

Two Thousand Women  1944  3.5
Phylis Calvert, Flora Robson
Why would this be an interesting movie? Do women find a movie about 2,000 women in a French hotel under the police control of Nazis an interesting story line?  In what ways?  The movie dialogue is womens chatter with a strong element of British propaganda.  First to note about this movie is that it was made during the war in England.  As someone else has said men are naturally interested in a movie with 2,000 good looking women in it.  How did women feel about the loss of men at home in England during WWII?  Probably they felt similarly to the way men felt when they were away from women in military service:  they missed them.  So this is a movie made primarily for British women during WWII.  The characters include a social cross section of the possible female paths in life from the sacred to the profane; the upper class to the lower class. The relationship of the sexes during war time is a primary focus here viewed especially from the stand point of women.  For that reason, the womens point of view makes this film different and interesting.

Secret Mission  1942 2
James Mason, Michael Wilding, Kurt Stapanek, male lead not mentioned on the CD jacket
In spite of some good actors the screenplay is poor.  The film quality itself is very poor.  The Germans are made to seem foolish and silly and the British smart, brave and dashing.  The German Admiral of the Bismark in the eponymous movie has a part in this movie as is convincing in his role.  This movie includes a romance that is very unconvincing.  The male lead is the same as that in The Day Will Dawn.  The movie is in general silly.

The Flemish Farm  1943 4
Clive Brook, Clifford Evans, Jane Baxter
Plot and screen play is from a true story:  the folding of the colors of the Belgian Airforce as the Nazis closed in on Belgium and the restoration of those colors.  Very well acted.  The drama is sustained, plot and character are developed, there is tragedy and reward.  This is a good movie.",1491436800,3,5291,4.735455543358946
