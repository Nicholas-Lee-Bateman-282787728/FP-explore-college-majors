8546129,3,B00A29UJQO,"I am writing a review comparing three language programs for very young children: Dino Lingo, Whistlefritz, and Little Pim.  I rented an episode from each of these programs from amazon to see which one was the best fit for me.

Dino Lingo was my least favorite (three stars), however, watching it regularly will still help toddlers and very young children pick up new words.  The production value of this one was the lowest; the dvds are  animation, but the animation is pretty low end and a bit corny.  Shots with people in them aren't very clear either, however, kids aren't going to care about that.  The program comes with six dvds that are about a half hour each.  The cartoons are very spazzy, fast paced, and odd.  I would recommend this set for little ones that watch more cartoons or television in general.  Not being judgmental here, but kids that are already exposed to other faster paced cartoons that are all over the place (like a ton of kids shows are) will pay attention to this better.  I personally feel this set is best for kids aged two to four, or maybe five.  Younger is probably best, because an older child is going to get sick of six half hour long dvds like this pretty dang quick.

Little Pim came in second place (four stars), but this is the intro to French that I am choosing for my just turned three year old daughter.  Little Pim is a mix of cartoons, and segments with real people.  It isn't as annoying as Dino Lingo, and the pace is slower.  The cartoon segments aren't as bizarre either.  Production quality is decent, and huge steps up from Dino Lingo, but don't expect gorgeous and elaborate animation as it is still fairly plain.  Little Pim comes with six dvds (same as Dino Lingo) that are about half an hour each. They are cute and engaging enough for the two to four (maybe five?) year old age bracket.  Again, I cant really picture six or seven year olds having any interest in watching these dvds, but I could be wrong.  Rent episodes off amazon before spending the one hundred dollars to find out.

Whistlefritz (only comes in Spanish and French, we are starting with French) is by far the best of the three.  It flows like a kids show with songs, and the episodes are centered on a woman with an animated mouse for a side kick teaching to a group of kids.  Looks nice, although I bet all parents will be sick of the songs before the first month is out, but this is the price we pay.
This collection comes with four dvds with about a half hour of program on each one.  It also comes with two cds that have all the songs on them, in case youd like to listen on an endless loop in the car for the rest of your life. Whistlefritz is ten dollars cheaper than Dino Lingo and Little Pim, but you end up with two less episodes to watch.  I personally would take two more episodes over the music cds.
I felt Whistlefritz would be suitable for slightly older children too, and not just toddlers, because the songs and style are slightly more engaging.

Also, don't expect your children to become fully fluent in French (or whatever language you choose) from watching these videos alone.  You will have to keep going with the language.  It is disappointing to me that none of these programs have additional levels geared towards elementary aged children.  I guess we have to jump right into Pimsleur (which is not connected to Little Pim in any way) or Rosetta Stone.

My three year old liked all three episodes I rented, so I have decided to start by purchasing Little Pim.  We don't do a lot of screen time in our house, so I imagine maybe three days a week I will have her watch a half hour episode.  I also plan on following up that half hour with an episode of Puffin Rock or Mouk with the language set to French (thank you, Netflix!).  There are many other cartoons on Netflix that can be played in other languages, so take advantage of screen time by using it as a language learning tool.

I intend to purchase the Whistlefritz program in the future, maybe six to twelve months down the road depending on how it goes.  I also intend to start a collection of childrens books in French so she can hear me reading familiar books in another language.  (I took many years of French in school, or I probably wouldnt bother with that!)

Hope this helps!",1515456000,4,4288,4.424744897959184
8546130,3,B00A29UJQO,"I personally find Dino Lingo a bit trippy (which a lot of kid shows are). -example a Robot and a Flower dances together in space, or Dolls getting electrocuted and coming to life to dance.
It is colourful and has lots of different animation styles which help to hold kids attention.
My Son loves it. It is entertaining for him.
But there are 90 second stretches in the show with little to no talking where there is just instrumental music and video.

For children under 4 I personally prefer Little Pim.
If your child doesn't find Little Pim engaging enough Dino Lingo not a bad choose.

At my house we have Little Pim, Dino Lingo, and Muzzy.  The demos seem promising for Early Lingo so we have ordered them but we don't have them yet.

Dino Lingo is good about keeping toddlers and preschoolers attention.  If you choose this language video I would suggest if for ages 2 and a half to 5 year olds.",1406419200,4,899,4.424242424242424
8546131,5,B00A29UJQO,"They teach us the same French words again and again by showing some different animals,
 different situations...etc.
so you  never get bored watching and learning from these DVDs.",1385510400,4,178,5.321428571428571
8546132,5,B00A29UJQO,"I just watched the French Dino Lingo preview video on [...] with my niece (who is seven years old). Dino Lingo offers many language learning programs for kids. Kids learn a different language through fun cartoons, dvds, cds, books, games, songs and flash cards.  There are 30 different free previews to choose from on [...] and to view the French Dino Lingo preview go to [...].

My niece and I chose the French Dino Lingo preview video to view on youtube. I thought the video was cute and I thought it was very clever for the video to start teaching the French language by starting with popular animals since most children love animals. My niece is no exception.. she has two dogs (chiens) and a fish (poisson) at home. She was immediately taken with the preview video. She liked it so much she wound up watching the video more times. She mastered all the animal names after only watching the preview three times. (It helped a little that I already studied French for seven years).

I had never heard of this product before seeing it advertised on the Influenster website. I have decided that I am going to buy her either the French or Spanish language program for her upcoming birthday since she loved the preview so much. I think this program is a great, fun way for kids to learn a new language. I would highly recommend this program to anyone with kids!",1360627200,,1358,4.557377049180328
8546133,5,B00A29UJQO,I recently received this DVD and was amazed by the quality of the video.  It was very eye catching and very understandable for my 3 year old.  He is a busy body but as soon as we put the video on for him her was very attentive and repetitive of what they were asking him to say.  We have the DVD for French and it really is awesome for younger kids and those thinking of learning some basic words in another language.,1360627200,,417,4.060975609756097
