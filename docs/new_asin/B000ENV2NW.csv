8111809,5,B000ENV2NW,Great way to get ready for a hike or just look at the landscape. Not for the hard core. But great for everyone else.,1422230400,,116,3.875
8111810,4,B000ENV2NW,"I thought the Capitol Reef video very interesting. While I assume it's a bit dated now, I dare say the trails haven't changed much. The coverage of the trails seemed to be all-inclusive and the photography was beautiful even without HD. The portion of the video explaining hiking techniques could be old hat for many but this is some harsh country and a word to the wise is a good idea.",1406937600,,386,4.450704225352113
8111811,1,B000ENV2NW,"I'll say that sight unseen, based on their Canyonlands/Arches video, an incredibly mind-numbing piece for anything about hikers so novice they ought to be required to get a hiker's license first.

Literally more than half of their Arches/Canyonlands 90-minute video of two incredible national parks is of two hikers on sections of trail, including not just difficult slickrock, or deep, plod-inducing loose sand, but flat, packed, kindergarten-level hiking trails.

I will say, sight unseen, skip other ""Park BasiX"" videos by this same set of people. And, as they are also professional tour guides/outfitters in this area, skip their company as well.

As well as boring with the mind- and eye-numbing fluff of two people hiking, if I heard the hackneyed phrase ""It is worth your..."" one more time in the Arches/Canyonlands video, I was going to fly to Moab to strangle a couple of people.

And, there was the lack of quality footage of the sights/sites, to boot.

The folks, on that video, would say, ""visit this site at sunrise"" or ""visit here at sunset"" for best sun angle, etc., yet all their own shots were basically from 10 a.m.-4 p.m.

There's reasons why, at least with the Arches/Canyonlands video, used copies are selling here on Amazon for less than a buck. Think about it.",1220140800,2,1283,4.944186046511628
