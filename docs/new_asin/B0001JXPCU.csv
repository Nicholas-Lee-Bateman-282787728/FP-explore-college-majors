8013347,5,B0001JXPCU,The Verminators series is great and the first one is no exception!  I got these videos for to help me improve my calling skills and to get set ideas for stand set ups.  This video delivers all of that and more.  Randy Anderson and his guys are hilarious and you'll learn a lot from watching them.  Enjoy!,1453161600,,304,4.280701754385965

8013349,5,B0001JXPCU,"The previous poster did not like the fact that the shooter enjoyed killing these coyotes!  Ask the ranchers if they need killin.  These predators are wiping out the populations of deer, rabbits and domestic animals.  Their numbers are growing and, these guys are doing a fabulous job of thinning them out.  Doctor, go buy a knitting video!",1274313600,,339,4.894736842105263
8013350,4,B0001JXPCU,"This movie could be as good as the other movies by Anderson, but it is not quite there. It is off the mark only because the new guy, pallet, is too high on killing these animals. He is giving you some weird hand signs after kills, and acting like a nut. It is a little too much to handle. However, randy is still on, and doing well. Get this and enjoy.",1196812800,3,352,3.971830985915493
