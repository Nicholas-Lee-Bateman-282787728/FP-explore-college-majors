1222013,3,B00000IBV7,"I enjoyed the film because it had some humor and fun.  The cast is great and help the movie along.  This movie is short and if it had been any longer, it would have been a boring bomb.",1370131200,,184,3.8157894736842106
1222014,4,B00000IBV7,"I enjoyed the movie, it is definitely not a blockbuster hit.  I didn't think it was worth purchasing new so I purchased a used copy.",1365292800,,132,4.28
1222015,1,B00000IBV7,Too much discussing of filth.  I did not watch beyond the first chapter.  Unless you enjoy gay agenda stay away from this one.,1364774400,,126,4.434782608695652
1222016,5,B00000IBV7,very good and most funny show and I love it!  Reason I bought it cause of action and funny and crime movie,1358812800,,106,3.8181818181818183
1222017,5,B00000IBV7,"I'm not sure where I first saw this movie, but it's an excellent movie. Great cast across the board, interesting and fun movie with an early Sean Patrick, Dean Cain, Andy Dick, the other guy from Tremors. Good stuff.",1356652800,,216,4.564102564102564
1222018,3,B00000IBV7,"Talk about being in the wrong place at the wrong time. If ever there was a movie that explored that theory, this is it. A guy robs a bank. His friend walks into the bank to find out what is taking so long. He happens to be carrying a concealed weapon, so he decides to be a hero... until he realizes the robber is his friend. So he needs to rescue his friend instead of the customers, of course. Then the other friends walk in to find out what is taking so long, and suddenly they are all involved. One of the friends used to be a lawyer and says they are all accessories to the crime. Until, of course, he declares, ""I am no longer involved in this. I am now a hostage.""

What?? I really didn't get the plot. So I've never been a lawyer, but I really don't see how they could all be charged in court as bank robbers just because they were friends and arrived in the same car. Why not charge the customers for not fighting back? Or the bank guard, since he gave up his gun so easily? Granted, they all got in on helping him escape, but I think that was because the dumb lawyer had them convinced they were accessories from the start.

So the movie ended up being an exciting adventure/drama, with funny moments thrown in. It was just the implausible beginning that messed it up. I got this movie because I love Dean Cain, and he's pretty much the only reason I still have to give it 3 stars.",1346976000,,1391,4.148148148148148
1222019,1,B00000IBV7,Unbelievably bad! This movie has no reality whatsoever! I paid a penny for it and still feel ripped off! Don't know who the 5 star reviewers are but my guess is that they could be aliens where intelligence is non-existent and real movies are unknown. Save your time and money there are more important things to do with your life!,1343865600,,329,4.5
1222020,2,B00000IBV7,I love Dean Caine in most of his movies but this was not a good one for him. Do not recommend children watch this movie. It was too graphic for some part of it and totally disgusting for other ones. Thank you.....,1334793600,,213,4.095238095238095
1222021,1,B00000IBV7,I Didn't like it - kind of boring - I don't recommended it - but fast forward helped. Was hoping for a smarter movie...,1323302400,,119,4.0

1222031,5,B00000IBV7,I purchased this film because I am a big fan of Dean Cain. It is a very humourous video in the style of 'Dog Day Afternoon'.  I thoroughly enjoyed the film and will watch it many times when I need a good laugh.,1206230400,,210,3.883720930232558
1222032,2,B00000IBV7,Amateurish and plodding.  This is one of those movies that keeps you checking your watch.,1205280000,2,89,4.933333333333334
1222033,4,B00000IBV7,"The movie itself is pretty great. If you expected mission impossible that type of film, then i would highly recommend you to not buy this but if you like the actors then you will love this. Most of it is stuck inside the bank therefore would be a really boring movie for some as it isn't very action apart from parts of the movie towards the end it gets more shooting. If you are keen on a bit of action here and then and you don't mind having a film that dosen't really plot anywhere else than one place, you will sure like this. I would personally say though that this movie is well worth hiring before you buy, not at all what i expected but i did seem to like it. Not really ace but the film is still fairly great. You will either like it or you don't.",1105747200,,756,4.046666666666667
1222034,5,B00000IBV7,"BEST MEN surprised me very much; I wasn't expecting such a delightful, if a little bit depressing, movie.  Directed by Tamra Davis with a keen eye on characterization and humor, this movie is one of those you smile most of the time, and have a good time with its surreal and zany plot.

Luke Wilson plays Jesse, a convict getting out of prison after a theft, and who is getting married to his sweetheart, Hope (Drew Barrymore).  Along for the ride are his best friends (Dean Cain as a former Green Beret, who is gay; Mitchell Whitfield as the lawyer Saul, who was Wilson's lawyer; Andy Dick as the nerdy Teddy, who is in a bad marriage; and Sean Patrick Flannery, who plays Billy and is secretly the philanthropic bank robber known as Hamlet because he spouts off lines from the play when he robs the banks.  Billy doesn't tell his buddies that he's planning on robbing a bank before the wedding, but one thing leads to another and all the men are holed up in the bank with the local sheriff (Fred Ward) who also happens to be Billy's father!  Soon, the inevitably nasty FBI comes in, headed by the sadistic and cold agent, played with malevolent glee by the durable and dependable Raymond J. Barry (Dead Man Walking, The Chamber).

The movie moves from some very humorous scenes to a devastating finale.  This dramedy works because the performances are top notch and the script while manipulative is honest.  Brad Dourif gives one of his best performances since ""Cuckoo's Nest"" as the mentally challenged Vietnam vet.  Fred Ward, Dean Cain, Sean Patrick Flannery and Mitchell Whitfield are also excellent.  It's the best work I've seen Cain do.

The movie entertained me immensely, and I would recommend it to audiences who enjoy a dramatic comedy!  Or is it a comic drama?

Cheers!",1102550400,13,1783,4.676282051282051
1222035,3,B00000IBV7,"I'm surprised after the well received TV Series ""Superman"", Dean Cain can now only find roles in B-rated films. More suprisingly is the frequency Dean Cain plays a gay character once again. The movie as a whole was funny at times, but definitely a cable only viewing. Not once does Dean Cain even take off his shirt, which would have added to the character's development and my enjoyment. The idea of the ""son"" quoting Hamlet bored me to death. This movie needed the giant Monty Python foot to squish some characters for a good laugh thus improving the quality and rating of this film.",1091404800,5,585,4.634615384615385
1222036,3,B00000IBV7,"I received this DVD as a gift. The person who bought this knows that I am absolutely NUTS over Drew Barrymore. Even thought Drew is on the cover her actual role in the movie is minor. Her role here is comparable to her role in ""Donnie Darko."" The movie does start off a bit tepid and ends with a punch. Watch and listen carefully for there are some shocking surprises. I will say that the movie is well made and engrossing. However, if you must buy this movie, buy it for the fun of watching it and not for solely for seeing Drew.",1022457600,6,530,4.155339805825243
1222037,5,B00000IBV7,"To put it simply, this movie just goes to show that ""B"" grade movies doesn't necessarily mean that they are ""B"" in quality.  In fact, I would say that Best Men is better than some supposed ""A"" grade movies.
This movie has something that a lot of others lack - originality.  I was kept entertained throughout the entirity of this movie, as were other people that I have recommended this movie to.
This movie definitely definitely gets two thumbs up from me.",990921600,3,456,4.548780487804878
1222038,5,B00000IBV7,"This movie has it all. Exploration of relationships, platonic and romantic, self-examination, character study, comedy of folly, and all without being heavy-handed or boring.  All the performances are top-drawer and each character has something to offer which is great and rare, making this truely and ensemble piece.  Dean Cain's performance is especially captivating, but not so much that it fails the mix.  You like and care about each one of the characters, warts and all.  I would recommend this movie to anyone, because I think anyone regardless of taste preferences would find something to love about this movie.  Definately worth the look.",970876800,10,646,5.294117647058823

Dean Cain, Sean Patrick  Flannery & Andy Dick make the movie worthwhile the others are good  too.great story for everyone to watch no matter what or who you like/are!  the only thing that annoys me is the Hamlet stuff (it's hard to follow if  don't understand Shakespear) but the saying ""to your own self, be  true"" is o.k and the start is great (especially when you first see  Dean)",967939200,,427,4.341772151898734

This movie shows how tight friendship can be  and the ending is killer!  I never realized how much of the Hamlet ""To  Be or Not To Be"" soliliquy I actually knew.  Sean Patrick Flanery and  Dean Cain give stellar performances.  This is an under-rated,  under-marketed movie!

The poor thing is all of them die at last except Luke Wilson and Barrymore in  the movie . Everything that i can say is at last of this movie is really a  tear jerker .

This movie had everything from action, drama, and even a  few Shakespearean quotes.  Sean Patrick Flannery gives an award winning  performance in my book, and the rest of the cast works well together and  really make this movie come alive!

1222045,4,B00000IBV7,"Luke Wilson adn Drew Barrymore pair up again after being in ""Home Fries."" This is much better. Luke Wilson, who just got out of jail, pairs up with his friends Andy Dick, Sean Patrick Flannery, Raymond J.Barry  and Dean Cain. Flannery decides to rob a bank on the way to Wilson's  wedding and gets them all in involved in it. I haven't seen Andy Dick in  very many movies before, even though he is funny in this and I'm glad to  see him in movies because of how funny he is, it's just he plays the same  character he does in ""Newsradio."" Some parts of this movie lag,  which is the reason it only got 4 stars but it's still good. Fred Ward  stars as Flannery's father, who just happens to be the Sheriff. Good movie,  if you have Cinemax, I believe you can watch it on there because it's not  out on video yet. So, hey, see it.",941846400,2,827,4.150943396226415
