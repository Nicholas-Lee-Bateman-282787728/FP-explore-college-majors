2452735,3,B000C3L26Q,"""Eros"" (2004) is the collection of three short films directed by Michelangelo Antonioni (segment ""Il filo pericoloso delle cose""), Steven Soderbergh (segment ""Equilibrium"") , and Kar Wai Wong (segment ""The Hand""). Each film explores the always exiting and mysterious subjects of love, sexuality, and desire.

My favorite is ""The Hand"" - a sensual, emotional, powerful and very sad story about a young tailor who put the years of unrequited love for a beautiful call girl in an exquisite dress he created for her. He knew the exact measurements from touch. This segment is so great that I am ready to buy a DVD just to be able to see it often. It is a brilliant work of art from one of the greatest working directors now.

Steven Soderbergh's ""Equilibrium"" is a funny duet between two excellent actors, Alan Arkin as a voyeuristic shrink and Robert Downey Jr. as his patient who has a reoccurring dream about a beautiful woman.

Michelangelo Antonioni's segment ""Il filo pericoloso delle cose"" aka ""The Dangerous Thread of Things"" has been called the weakest in the trio. Many posters call it garbage, the total waste of time, the soft -porn made by a man who ""got old and got horny"". I personally did not find it a waste of time and if the man at 92 wants to make a little film that celebrates beauty and femininity - so be it. I feel that Michelangelo's segment is much deeper than it seems - even on the surface it is very attractive to look at.

2452736,2,B000C3L26Q,"""Dear Trio of Top Directors:

Women in see-through blouses do not an erotic film make. Eros depends on desire, excitement, passion, or the suggestion of same. The suggestiveness in your short features is to genuine eros as a sneeze is to a hurricane.

I've had more erotic moments than those depicted in your films in my travels. Heck I've had more erotic moments in my marriage than what is shown here (and my marriage is past the decade mark). Please spice things up next time.

Sincerely, This [Female] Reviewer.""

My open letter above is not to say that these three short features don't have their positive aspects, but really, both the title and the cover art for this DVD lead you on, into thinking you are about to get some real heat, not talk-talk-talk and women in see-through blouses.

Now, some positive words. Feature 1, where Gong Li stars as a washed-up courtesan -- this feature is well-crafted, though a downer, and predictably so. At least it starts with an explicitly sexual situation.

Feature 2, with Alan Arkin and Robert Downey Jr., has a wondrous mid-1950s feel, but pretty much nothing erotic happens or is even talked about.

Feature 3 is by Antonioni and is called ""The Dangerous Thread of Things."" At first, this seems to be more talky-talk in Italian, see-through blouses, and off-point meanderings (visits to waterfalls, a restaurant, and a mysterious and lovely seaside fortification converted to an artist's retreat). While watching this feature, I at first thought, it's pretty auteur stuff, but pointless.

Upon reflection, I do think Antonioni is trying to show us something important about love. This feature depicts a man bickering with his wife, who is beautiful but frowning, and the same husband enthralled with a mysterious mistress, who is also beautiful, but also carefree and confident. For those men keeping score, you can compare their equally attractive naked bodies in the closing scene. The director's point appears to be to show something obvious (when love works, it works, and when it doesn't, it doesn't) and perhaps suggest much more ... WHY does love work? How much of love is in the attitude of the husband, and the attitude of the wife vs. that of the mistress? How do we break the donkey-trudging-around-a-well routine of many years with a spouse, and keep a smile? Can the wife adopt the joyous pose of the mistress and re-excite the husband?

Is love magic and ethereal, or does a happy confidence quite simply beget and nurture love?

It's too bad an auteur director such as Antonioni couldn't explore this theme a bit more clearly. At the risk of sounding like a Philistine, I would think a bit more Hollywood-style clarity for the Antonioni short would have helped his audience follow what I am only guessing is his point.",1166918400,5,2784,4.879237288135593
2452737,2,B000C3L26Q,"The three stories are quite uneven, being the Wan Kar Wai's segment the most interesting: well acted, well photographed and with a kind of catchy story line. However, the other too are a wonderful invitation to sleep. The Steven Soderbergh tale is awfully dull and nothing really interesting happens. The Antonioni piece is the most disappointing one, not only for being the worst but for being Anyonioni's. It's absolutely pointless and confusing; in many instances, it seems to be an amateurish test from a lazy cinema student. It's a pity it's Antonioni's since his reputation deserves more than this. Only for the Wan Kar Wai piece, I give this movie 2 stars.",1153008000,2,663,4.928571428571429
2452738,4,B000C3L26Q,"It is painful to read some of the reviews, which look at Antonioni's films as literary texts. There are those who consider ""Gone With the Wind,"" or ""Casablanca"" to be great movies. Some, more sophisticated, movie fans hold ""Citizen Kane"" in the highest esteem. But these movies, like most Hollywood products are using cinema as a wheelbarrow to bring vaudeville, circus, theatre, opera, and literature to the masses. Cinema, unlike theatre, which is an illegitimate child of literature and poetry, is an original, unique, and independent form of communication. Actually, cinema is closer to music and painting than to literature and theatre. Antonioni is a master filmmaker and since L'Avventura in 1960 every film he has created has been a true cinematic text (Before L'Avventura, his films constitute his ""universities,"" trying to find and establish his personal style). Antonioni in cinema is like Michelangelo in painting and sculpture; like Tolstoy in literature; and Beethoven in music. His episode in ""Eros"" is a short film. To appreciate it, one has to think of Chekov, and then see it more like a painting and hear it like a sonata. It is not a literary text that goes from A to Z, it is in total, like a painting, a musical melody, that communicates feelings which affect us in the mood we are as we watch it. Then the experience lingers on and becomes a memory; on subsequent viewings, each time, we react differently. It has layers and layers of meanings, which affect us not only according to our mood at the time we watch it, but also according to our attitude to life and what we think of social issues and human relationships. I just wish the Maestro had made the other episodes as well.",1139788800,17,1703,4.815699658703072
2452739,3,B000C3L26Q,"I won't go through the plots of the three short films, because I didn't find them to be very interesting. They are very different in terms of style and mood, and I agree with those who prefer Wong Kar Wai's The Hands, which features his signature style that's filled with brilliant colours, music score, and impeccable kapo dresses by Cheung Suk Pink. Cheung Chang finally gets his starring role in a WKW film. He previously appeared in Happy Together in a supporting role, and this film demands him to show some serious emotions and daring sexual encounter with the leading lady. Gong Li is very powerful and touching as a ill-fated hooker who rejects Chen until she was afflicted by S.T.D.s. She's very good at playing scenes that calls her to reveal all her fire and emotions. Whether it was the scene of performing a hand job on Chen, or being held to the point of massive tears, or the moment when she reunited with Chen allowed her to show her intensity and range. Got to love her 1960's big wig and fancy kapo dresses! I was disappointed that the supposedly cameo appearance by Carina Lau didn't show up in this film. I didn't enjoy the Steven Soderbergh film, even though it had cast the amazingly talented Robert Downey Jr, but the film is quite boring. As for Antonioni's romantic film, I found it to be a bit unattractive when compared to the ultra glamorous The Hand. It's got a home video feel to it and even a bit semi-pornographic.",1139616000,4,1446,4.565384615384615
2452740,3,B000C3L26Q,"The initial concept for making this film was to offer three variations on the theme of love from three directors from three cultures.  Or is the title 'Eros' more about the erotic than about love?  Question unanswered by this triptych of minor works by some superb directors.  The end result seems to be three streams of conscious thoughts looking for a reason to make it to the screen.  With the brilliance of the three directors one would expect far more than the film delivers.

Wong Kar Wai presents the strongest of the three films in a dark story about a tailor who sublimates his desire for a courtesan (Gong Li) by making clothes for her - a 'servant' who finally reverses his role.  The photography and interweaving of the characters is very beautiful to experience.

Steven Soderberg makes a testy little script about an ad man (Robert Downey, Jr) in therapy with a bizarre psychiatrist (Alan Arkin) exploring a recurring sensual dream.  Shot is black and white the actors give it their all but the story is silly and becomes boring with all the distractions Soderberg works into the weak plot.

Antonioni attempts to breathe life into the old Italian movies of lover's spats and diversions and comes up with what feels like a scriptless little mess of a movie bent solely on see-through blouses and nude cavorting on beaches.

As a triptych the film just doesn't become airbourne, despite some very high powered, first rate directors.  Much ado about very little. Grady Harp, February 06",1139529600,,1498,4.8125
2452741,2,B000C3L26Q,"I'm not going to write too much. If you need to hear more just check other reviews down here.

From all the 3 episodes only the first one, by Kar-Wai, is worth your time.

""The Hand"" is well done and typical Kar-Wai. Beautifully shot by his usual contributor Christopher Doyle, it's the most compelling and sexy episode of the bunch. Gong Li, always very elegant, give us a powerful sexy scene and her presence establishes and guide the rest of the story. Well crafted but very predictable. The director lately seems to be referencing himself, which is halfway form self parody.

""Equilibrium"" is just a bad cinematic joke and absolutely non sexy. Other than a few gratuitous and unrelated naked shots, is a simple and boring exchange between Downey Jr. playing an adman and his analyst played by Arkin.

But the worst by far is the Antonioni's episode. Is just so poorly done and acted that is an embarrassment. The, once, great director should have just retired by now (he was 91 in 2004) and let the rest of the world appreciate his masterpieces.",1136160000,5,1049,4.684782608695652

""The Hand"" gets 5 out of 5 stars.
""Equilibrium"" gets 5 out of 5 stars.
""The Dangerous Thread of Things"" gets 2 out of 5 stars.

The movie supposedly explores ""eroticism and desire"".  The storyline of ""The Hand"" is the best of the three parts.  Gong Li and Cheng Chen give strong, unforgettable or memorable performances.  Gong Li is like a Chinese Julia Roberts.

Robert Downey, Jr. gives his usual outstanding performance as the male lead,  Alan Arkin is also great in a supporting role as Downey's psychiatrist.  Unfortunately, the female supporting role offers nothing or zero.  The female could have been replaced with a car, pet, food, etc.. However, the lack of female input is more than made up with the dream, a deeper part of consciousness, in the story.

""The Dangerous Thread of Things"", the third part of the movie, offers nothing in terms of a surprises.  A naked women moving herself around on bed and a guy wandering outdoors in search for her is the closest this short story gets to the aim of the movie.  I gave one star for that.  I also awarded a second star for the next to last clip of a naked women dancing on a beach.  She was just right for the part, not too skinny and not too fat and not too muscular.

2452753,3,B000C3L26Q,"It's tough to pull off something like Eros because it's a package deal. Three different minis from three different directors was truly the mixed bag you'd imagine, and unfortunately I only enjoyed one.

From least enjoyed to most enjoyed....Soderberg's middle entry ""Equilibrium"" tries to be funny and clever but never worked for me, and listening to Robert Downey, Jr. ramble endlessly didn't help. The black and white effect was hokey and I kept waiting for something interesting to be said and it never was. It's by far the talkiest of the three and yet it says by far the least.

Antonioni's end installment ""The Dangerous Thread of Things"" begs for harsh criticism as it has an air of pretension and art that nearly suffocates it, but the cinematography, the whimsical nature, and the quirky randomness of it made it a bit more interesting than its predecessor. His view on sexual attitudes, free spirits, and how they affect a relationship was thoughtful, but also felt a bit stereotypical. In the end, however, it was a beautiful Italian postcard that failed to appeal to me on any other level.

The real jewel in this trifecta is Wong Kar-Wai's offering, a beautiful, heartbreaking, and tender work that fills in all the emotional voids the other two create. It's a shame this is the first movie because the bar is set so high that the others have nowhere to go but under...and they do.

Gong Li turns in a fine performance, especially in the final scenes when the make-up is off and she is vulnerable and endearing. Chang Chen is superb as the quietly suffering tailor who blindly and faithfully pines for Gong Li's fading courtesan character. His timid uncertainty blossoms into soft-spoken strength and he demonstrates a heart big enough for both of them. It's an achingly sweet movie.

Is the forty-five minutes or so of the Kar-Wai feature strong enough to justify a purchase? It depends upon how much of a collector you are. At less than ten bucks, you'd have to make the call. It's a shame this little gem of a movie can't be released as some kind of extra to another of Kar-Wei's full length movies.",1323648000,,2115,4.752043596730245
2452754,5,B000C3L26Q,"I watched it because of the cover...

2452755,4,B000C3L26Q,"Put it this way.... to be honest and right to the point.....

Eros would have been a PERFECT BEAUTIFUL very erotic movie had the WHOLE movie been about the story and romance built between the two main characters: Chang Chen and Gong Li. But because they added the last two to the movie well.... geez! I just don't get it to save my life, why in the world they felt like they had to add the last two stories to this movie! UNREAL!!!! Down right stupid if you ask me. It totally ruined it! I mean.... They could've just made a 2 hour movie out of the first one with these two beautiful people/actors! I guarantee the movie then would've got the highest ratings and even gone up for an award!

The only reason why I love this movie and even bought the movie is because of the first short story about the Tailor Chang Chen and Courtesan Gong Li. It's so very erotic and beautiful. Once it's over, I turn the movie off and pretend as though that IS the movie itself. Forget about the other two!! Not even worth ones precious time - not even for a blink!

I would've given this movie 1 star because of the other two stupid stories but gave it 4 because the first story my favorite is in this movie. It's the only one that truly deserves 5 stars!!!!!!!!!! and more!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It's such a shame the first one couldn't have been a movie itself. So upsetting and very disappointing. But at least we got to see the first one even for it's blink of an eye second showing in this movie!!!

I think another Director/Producer should remake this short piece between Chen and Li into a regular full length movie one day. Trust me.... they would get millions back and more for it!!!

I still very much recommend this beautiful sexy movie but please ONLY get it for the FIRST story and THAT'S IT!!!!! Trust me.... after the first one... if you continue to watch it... you'll be very disappointed!",1297296000,,1882,4.39367816091954
2452756,3,B000C3L26Q,"Having thoroughly enjoyed the films of Wong Kar-wai, I rented Eros primarily to see ""The Hand,"" a short piece which Wong contributed to the anthology. For fans of Wong, and, for that matter, cinema in general, this segment will not disappoint. Indeed, ""The Hand"" is a classy, erotically charged and truly heart-rending exploration of the director's favorite themes: unrequited love; memory; and alienation. Well casted and beautifully choreographed, Gong Li and Chang Chen positively shine through their character's respective sadness. It is, quite simply, a phenomenal short piece, and, while it may not approach the brilliance of full lengths like In the Mood for Love, 2046 and Chunking Express, it clearly stands above all of Wong's other short film projects.

The second segment, Steven Soderbergh's ""Equilibrium,"" pales in comparison, but, all in all, it is an enjoyable, if overly campy, short revolving around one man's attempt to interpret an ethereal and mildly romantic recurring dream. Tragically, the final piece, Michelangelo Antonioni's ""The Dangerous Thread of Things,"" isn't worth the film stock it was shot on. Boring, shallow characters act out an unnecessarily drama-ridden, forcibly arty and utterly dull tryst which marries unengaging, unadulterated soft porn with failed, overblown symbolism. All things considered, there can be no disputing the fact that Eros is an utter failure when viewed as an anthology or portmanteau film; that said, ""The Hand"" is worth pursuing, irrespective of how it is presented and/or packaged.",1293494400,,1546,5.495798319327731

Sad, sad, sad, and Gong Li so beautiful and tragic.

quilibrium"" has Alan Arkin and Robert Downey Jr in a brief story that's a cross between Tony consulting Dr, Melfi in THE SOPRANOS and an episode of AMC's hit series MAD MEN.  As a lesson in how great advertising copy is born, not made, this cannot be topped.  I didn't enjoy, however, Soderbergh's superbusy direction of his stars, who wind up sounding nearly as artificially mannared as Jennifer Jason Leigh in THE HUDSUCKER PROXY.  You can see why these actors jumped into the project, but it isn't all that enjoyable.

Finally, in ""THE DANGEROUS THREAD OF THINGS,"" Michelangelo Antonioni wipes the floor with WKW and Soderbergh, and apparently he did so from an oxygen tank, flat on his back, without being able to speak to his actors.  What a story he gives us!  Christopher (Christopher Buchholz, the son of Horst Buchholz and nearly as good looking as his father) is married to Chloe, a beautiful young woman who now hates Christopher for the crime of boredom against her.  The two of them had once been successful vineyard owners and wine merchants, but their relationship has soured when he stopped wanting to make love to her.  She demands that they try to rekindle what they had with a trip to Sardinia, by the Adriatic Sea, and ultimately she prevails, though unfortunately she just picks and picks at him during this trip till he can't take it any more.  ""I used to love this place, but being with you here sours me on it,""she complains as they make their way through a hooded landscape of thorns and brambles.

The two of them had once lived at the time of ancient Rome, when Sardinia (in Latin, the place of little tuna -- sardo--) was an outlying province of the empire, famous for its twin towers on either side of Sardinia Bay.

Now Christopher and Chloe realize that the other tower is occupied by a second beautiful girl, a bit younger than Chloe, called Linda.  Linda is the daughter of Chloe's former husband, a man who now works as a bartender in a distant city.  He has left her one painting--a painting of pale orange flames, a vision of the hell he endured with Chloe.  Linda displays it proudly in the living room of the tower, a life she calls ""utter chaos"" as she leads Christopher playfully into her bedroom and onto the tower roof.  As you can imagine, Linda turns him on, but the ancient tie to Chloe makes him sad.  The ""dangerous thread"" that unites all these people is that of incest, the unspoken word in the town where this takes place.  The sea is the witness, and the souls of Sardinian victims of Roman oppression seem to howl with each wave lapping the shore.  (Antonioni, though too weak to climb the stairs himself, arranged to set Linda's scenes in the exact same tower in which the UK writer DH Lawrence contracted what was then called ""Roman Fever"" in the winter of 1921.  It is a famous tourist site, used as a rathskellar now and atmospherically restored by Antonioni's set designers to look something like it did in the days of Lawrence and Frieda.)",1245974400,6,3283,4.5777777777777775

The first, and best of the short films, ""The Hand"" is both moving and erotic. The third, ""The Dangerous Thread of Things"" is muddled. . .but it steams, and thus deserves its place in an collection of erotica. The second, well. . .

First story is set in China and explores connection between a concubine and a young tailor apprentice who makes her dresses for her clients. Young tailor falls in love hopelessly with a beautiful prostitute. He knows her body so well, he can make her clothes without taking her measurements.  I loved the part where is is alone in a shop one evening and imagines having her while caressing her silk dress he made for her.  I have never seen a film recently about a man so consumed by his desire for a woman he cannot have.  Second film written and produced by Steven Soderbeg starring Alan Arkin and Robet Downey, Jr. is the best of of the three.  It explores young marketing executive with a recurring erotic dream he cannot explain, who visits his shrink in attempt to undersatndf them.  The shrink seems to have preoccupations of his own during their therapy session.  Both actors give magnificent performance that is funny and engaging.  Setup for their dialog is in 1950s so this part of the film is made in black and white that adds even more power to it.  The weekest part of the trilogy is the Italian film that supposedly celebrates female sexuality.  But I found nude scenes and lovemaking scenes, scenes of lovers bickering privately and publicly too tedious to be able to celebrate what director wanted us to see. Perhaps in his case, less would have been more.  Good idea, but poor execution.

2452760,4,B000C3L26Q,"I may be the only one on this review thread to say this, but I think the trashing of Antonioni's segment is very short sighted.  The Dangerous Thread of Things (a great title) is very Antonioni like, with excellent compositions and some really beautiful, haunting moments.  The dialogue isn't the greatest (and the actors are dubbed into Italian, which doesn't help), but visually it's superb.  Many have said that Antonioni's use of nudity was gratuitous, accusing Michelangelo of being a dirty old man (he was 94 when he made this).  Similar accusations were leveled at Stanley Kubrick following Eyes Wide Shut (which had many similarities to Antonioni's work).  It didn't feel like an exploitation film at all (as some have said).  Wong Kar-Wai's segment is very much like his other work, haunting, sad, and quite moving, even though there isn't any real nudity.  Soderbergh's segment, while occasionally amusing (Arkin and Downey give good performances), doesn't belong in a film about eroticism.  There's nothing remotely erotic about it, other than Downey's character has an erotic dream of sorts (which isn't very erotic).  So, I think Antonioni's segment is just fine, and Kar-Wai's is very good too.  Like another reviewer said, the segments are too short, and it would have been nice if they were longer.

I am fully aware of the fact that human beings have the tendency to pursue the unattainable with the utmost intense passion that sometimes, the term ""pedestal"" does not even begin to scratch the surface.  If I were to compare this young tailor's obsession to something chemical, it was like watching a hollow heroin addict hopelessly devoted to the possibility of achieving his ultimate fix of love - from someone who was completely incapable of reciprocating such organic emotion.

We see it over and over again.

I wished they could have found a way to actually show her character in the end, rather than to just talk about what happened to her.  And I wish the tailor had gotten a little more dimension to his character.  But this was a solid and interesting story, much closer to the profound side of the spectrum than the shallow.",1453680000,,429,4.071428571428571

8095607,5,B000C3L26Q,"Eros brings together three very different filmmakers, who are telling us, each in his own way, stories about love/lust/desire/dreams.

The first segment (The Hand) is made by Wong Kar -Wai, with Christopher Doyle as cinematographer. It's a pure gem, gorgeous and intoxicating. Two very good actors: Gong Li and Chen Chang (the bandit from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon). It's the Weltanschaung of Wong Kar-Wai, where eros is actually a mean to meditate about time: time that heals everything while not solving anything; time that's as illusory as happiness is; time that breaks any hope in the end, while showing you that it doesn't matter.

I found the segment on youTube; unfortunately it has no subtitles, so if you aren't familiar with Chinese you are kind of lost, so I will try to summarize the plot: a tailor sends an apprentice to one of his rich customers, who is a high-class courtesane in her prime; she has the sadistic impulse to humiliate sexually the boy. This creates a strange dependence of unrequited lust, that grows through the years, while the courtesane is gradually loosing her status. The rich patrons leave her, the means to keep her style are vanishing and she eventually becomes a prostitute of the lowest kind. The apprentice remains attached to her down to the end and puts all his erotic desire in creating a dress that substitutes for him the woman.

Let's pass now to the second segment (Equilibrium), created by Steven Soderbergh. It's a different kind of an animal: a voyeuristic puzzle based on circular references. A guy (wonderfully played by Robert Downey Jr.) comes to the shrink to complain about an obsessive recurrence: a splendid woman appears naked in his dreams, bathing and dressing in front of him. The shrink puts the patient on the coach and makes him tell all details, while trying to live the dream by himself ! Eventually the patient falls asleep on the coach and the shrink leaves the room. The patient wakes up in front of the woman of his dreams: she's actually his wife and the dream was the visit to the doctor! Or the other way around :)

As for the third segment (Il filo pericoloso delle cose - The Dangerous Thread of Things), made by Michelangelo Antonioni, it was considered by many reviewers as the weakest part of the movie. Actually the segment of Antonioni is exquisite: an erotic fantasy subtly suggesting the sagesse of women in these matters. And you cannot compare the three segments in any way; each one follows a totally different approach.",1421712000,,2514,4.839534883720931
