7804056,3,6300183114,"This movie moves right along and has some chuckles along the way, but it's a mediocre comedy about how the upper class in England lived during
the 18th century (or thereabouts). Most of it is a fun romp featuring a lucky guy. The late great British comedian Terry-Thomas has a small part in it.
Joan Collins, once a real hottie is also in this one. This movie still seems to lack something, but it's reasonably enjoyable fare.",1455667200,,426,4.545454545454546

7804058,2,6300183114,"Oh sweet mystery of life revealed!  I have often wondered what spawned Bill Clinton's formidable libido, and THE BAWDY ADVENTURES OF TOM JONES must be it!
Featuring a story about a gentle, good-natured young lad who can't help it that he's the rowdy object of carnal desires of a stable full of 18th Century buxom beauties, I quickly zoomed in on the comparisons.  Young Tom enjoys the pleasures of the flesh, yet steadfastly maintains his innocence and his constant devotion to his true love.  Hmmm, haven't we heard that one before?  And when a lustful young lass literally throws herself at one's feet, what's a politician, er, a dashing young man to do?
One can only imagine the inspiration ignited by this film's countless romps and trysts and enthusiastic rolls in the hay.  If ever there was a film that pronounced one could indeed have one's cake and eat it, too (pun intended), this is it.  And no doubt the statures of screen veterans such as Trevor Howard, Joan Collins, and Terry-Thomas enhanced this movie's credibility--much like an acquittal from the U.S. Senate.  And sporting an absolutely nauseating musical score, THE BAWDY ADVENTURES OF TOM JONES also brings to mind Bill Clinton's brother, Roger.  Yet another example of noble inspiration!
