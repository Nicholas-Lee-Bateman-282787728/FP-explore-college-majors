The lighting on the video is good.
The camera work is also good.
Ms. Guerri clearly knows what she is doing on an Aikido mat.

Cons:
The description of the product is fairly sparse but I quote the following from it: ""You will easily learn these techniques due to the DVD's unique up-close photography and demonstrations.""  After watching this I really doubt this to be a true statement.  There is no verbal explanation of any of the techniques.  You occasionally get a graphic which tells you the root technique that she is demonstrating but that's about it.  Then you see one technique after another.

It's hard to know who her target audience is.  She states that her lack of explanation is intentional.  She studied directly under Morihiro Saito (I also follow his style) and therefore this choice seems strange to me.  Anyone with YouTube access can pull up videos of Saito sensei and you can see that he had no problems explaining how things should be done.  New comers to the art are going to need verbal instruction so clearly she isn't targeting them.  If you're already experienced enough to not need verbal help then you should already know most if not all of the material.  So what's the point then?  Look how good I am at Aikido?

The video could also have done with some editing.  There are scenes (admittedly not many) where she has clearly become disconnected from her uke.  Rather than restart the technique, or just scrapping the shot and doing it over, the uke speeds up to attempt to regain connection with her and then takes a fall.  This kind of thing is antithetical to those who follow Saito sensei's style and I was very surprised to see it here.

You can do just as good by searching YouTube.  For those wanting Iwama Ryu Aikido instruction head over to Aikido Journal and get the Saito sensei videos from them.",1395187200,6,1842,4.62962962962963
