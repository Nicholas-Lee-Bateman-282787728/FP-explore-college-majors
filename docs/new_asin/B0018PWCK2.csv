8270587,5,B0018PWCK2,"I bought this DVD a couple of years ago and I'm surprised that no one has reviewed it yet. Simply put, this DVD is jam-packed with great guitar-work, some good singing, and a couple tracks with a full bluegrass setup (guitar, mandolin, dog-house bass, and banjo, sorry no fiddling' here). It takes what I think is the best premise of bluegrass (the guitar solo) and amplifies it full force. There is so much good guitar work in this hour of music, that I have literally watched this DVD dozens of times; each time taking something different away from the experience. If you are a fan of bluegrass, old-timey music, or fantastic guitar work, check this DVD out!",1334534400,,660,4.64957264957265
