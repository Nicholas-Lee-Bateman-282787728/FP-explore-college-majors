The story lines are great entertainment for the whole family, wholesome with a great message.  You cannot help but be so touched.  These are video's that you will watch over and over again.",1206662400,12,351,5.214285714285714
3058066,5,B00110WFUQ,These movies are what the doctor order. They are inspirational and moving for anyone that is going thru. A must see!,1353369600,,116,4.571428571428571
3058067,5,B00110WFUQ,Our family loved these movies.  Great for teaching values to the family and clean movies.  Down to earth deal with real life issues.,1335052800,,132,4.695652173913044
3058068,5,B00110WFUQ,"We enjoyed these movies immensely!  They conveyed inspiration and encouragement in a very entertaining manner. I don't usually have the patience to sit through a movie, but I highly recommend these!",1325289600,,198,5.387096774193548
3058069,5,B00110WFUQ,"I had never heard of ""Flywheel"", but figured ""two was better than one""....I'm SO glad I bought this set.  My 10-year-old son watched both movies over and over, and ""Flywheel"" was his favorite of the two.  He also really likes ""Facing The Giants"", and we even had a season kick-off party for my son's football team where they watched it and all 16 boys liked it, too!  I personally think both movies are great for any age and either are perfect for a family movie night.",1284163200,,469,4.430232558139535
3058070,5,B00110WFUQ,"these are great moves. i was so excited to know i could order movies like this on the ionternet. they can in little time . so try these, you will be Blessed",1266969600,,156,3.90625
3058071,5,B00110WFUQ,O my God I really enjoy watching those movies they were such an inspiration. I learned a lot and I praise God for the person who wrote those stories. I shared the DVDs with friends and families and they were so happy. My husband and my father who lives in Haiti were very very happy to receive it as a gift for the holidays,1266537600,,323,4.0625
3058072,5,B00110WFUQ,I meant to buy Fireproof with these also and must have clicked on the wrong product.  These are great movies with a great Christ centered message.,1257206400,,146,4.615384615384615
3058073,5,B00110WFUQ,"Why did it take so long for someone to do this? These movies, along with Fireproof, are great for all of us to see that God moves in His time and in His ways. I hate to be the lone voice that criticizes the acting but I have to be honest. It gets a little better as you go from Flywheel to Facing the Giants and finally to Fireproof. Don't get me wrong, I have watched these over and over and love the message. I also highly recommend them to anyone (not just believers) who wants a family friendly movie that gets you really involved in the storyline and even has some twists. I did see some of the plot twists coming a mile away but some I didn't.

Again, I have to let you know not to get these two movies expecting a big Hollywood blockbuster with all the trimmings and astounding acting. They did very well for being just plain old folks. Get them for the message and you will not be disappointed.

Flywheel is the first movie they did and Facing is the second. I wish I had watched them in order but I didn't know about Flywheel when I saw Facing the Giants.

In response to one other reviwer's comment re: the characters being ""irresponsible"" for trying to have a baby when the lead character's job and future was not secure in Facing the Giants, it is a necessary part of the plot and when they start trying, his job is not going so bad. Plus who waits to have a baby when you want one as bad as they do? It was also a kind of leap of Faith for them (just my opinion).

For the guys, let the tears flow. These movies grab you and don't let go. It is amazing what God can, and will, do if we give Him just the smallest of chances. I tried to fight it at first but then gave up and rejoiced at these wonderful depictions of God's grace and mercy toward us. His love is really on display here and it softens even the hardest heart.",1253145600,,1836,4.091666666666667
3058074,4,B00110WFUQ,"I first saw ""Fireproof"" and then wanted to see the films that came before that one. The message is great in all the movies and becomes very obvious from the beginning. I liked all of them better the second time I watched them, which alot of times I do. They would not appeal to some who are not already Christian. Make sure you watch the extra features, it is amazing all the work and dedication that went into making these movies. Very impressive!",1251763200,,448,4.409638554216867
3058075,5,B00110WFUQ,"I so enjoyed both the movies.  My friends have come over to watch and we could not stop talking about them after it was over.

3058076,5,B00110WFUQ,"These movies are heartwarming, believable real life stories on how Jesus Christ can change a heart and a life.  I especially enjoyed that fact that even after a changed life, trials still come and God still works within those trials for His glory.",1246233600,,247,4.744186046511628
3058077,5,B00110WFUQ,"In ""Flywheel"", a car salesman listens to his wife (smart man!) and puts God first in his life, runnning his business with honesty and integrity. He eventually reaps great rewards, both spiritual and financial. The struggles he goes through and the perseverance demonstrated in doing what is right when it seems he is failing, and in the relationships that are built during those times, is inspiring. In ""Facing the Giants"", a man learns how to be a great football coach, inspires his team and others, and persists in taking the high road even when the odds are against him. What happens between a son (one of the players) and his father is a very poignant resolution of a healed relationship. The only thing I didn't like about this movie was the emphasis on the couple (coach and wife) trying so hard to have a baby. I thought that depicted them as very  irresponsible since they couldn't even afford to fix their car and his job prospects seemed so unstable. I loved the way he talked with his players and colleagues and others, not hiding his faith, but I can't imagine that kind of talking being allowed at a public school without someone complaining about it. If you can ignore the part about the couple being irresponsible and can imagine talk about God and scripture used at a school, you will really enjoy this movie.",1245974400,,1325,4.662393162393163
3058078,5,B00110WFUQ,How privileged we are to be recipients of such great movies as these! Very entertaining with absolutely believable stories.  We will be happy and blessed if more like these are made....and they are!,1244678400,,198,5.0
3058079,5,B00110WFUQ,I thought both movies were an inspiration to me and my family. As christians its quite hard to find really good christian movies for the whole family; and these movies have really touched on some issues that we were struggling with and has given us practical insight on how to tackle them. I even plan to share these movies with my youth group at church.,1242432000,,354,4.461538461538462

3058082,5,B00110WFUQ,"Both of these movies demonstrate the love God has for us, and how we just need to have faith in Him.  Allow God to take control of your life and do what is right, and He will bless you indeed.",1238976000,,192,3.8
3058083,5,B00110WFUQ,"Both excellent movies! Really good story lines! The only thing is you can tell they haven't acted long and the screen quality isn't like the one in the movies. But, I could watch them over and over! Good family movies!",1238889600,,218,4.475

3058085,5,B00110WFUQ,"Facing the Giants shows how life sometimes beats us up.  The coach decides he has no choice but to make a change.  The change he made included the football team and in turn influenced the school and community.  Many lives were transformed, and after watching the movie, I see life differently.  In Flywheel, most things in used car dealer, Jay Austin's life, seam to be getting him down.  A friend/employee gives Jay some advice/encouragement and after implementing it, Jay's life changes in ways he has trouble understanding.  Both movies show good values and can be watched by the whole family.",1237507200,,596,4.91
3058086,5,B00110WFUQ,Loved the movies Flywheel and Facing the Giants. Both have good stories and Christian messages. Have watched both more than once.,1231200000,,129,5.190476190476191
3058087,5,B00110WFUQ,"I enjoyed both Flywheel and Facing the Giants.  Both very inspirational movies on how some changes in the way we live our professional lives affect our family lives.  It is so nice to see good Christian films like this.

I have also seen Fireproof and highly recommend each of these movies.",1227657600,,290,4.647058823529412
3058088,5,B00110WFUQ,"In an age when most movies seem to be a cast of characters in search of a plot with poor acting, extensive special effects, offensive behavior included for shock value and no significant message, Facing the Giants and Flywheel were a breath of fresh air. Both of these movies had plots based on real world struggles by ordinary people. It was refreshing to see portrayals of lives where character, integrity, courage, humor, faith and persistence made a difference in their lives and the lives of others. The third movie in this series, Fireproof, followed the same format and was excellent; I can hardly wait for the DVD to become available. I can only hope that we are offered more movies of this genre.",1226707200,,705,4.739837398373984
3058089,5,B00110WFUQ,"It's a great family film and especially for young folks that are into athletics, though the lessons in the film are applicable in every day life as well. I'm making sure that all of my grandchildren have an opportunity to see it.",1226016000,,229,4.476190476190476
3058090,5,B00110WFUQ,The content of these movies was great and hold true to the values that I hold so dear.  I highly recommend them both.,1225584000,,117,4.086956521739131
3058091,5,B00110WFUQ,Both these videos are very well done and are excellent for families and couples. I highly recommend them both.,1225324800,,110,4.842105263157895
3058092,4,B00110WFUQ,"The first film 'Flywheel' was made for $20,000 - hardly enough to cover Tom Cruise's latte bill on MI3 - but more tan enough to show that these film makers have both heart and talent. The picture quality is adequate, though why oh why SOny didn't make it an anamorphic release is totally beyond me - non anamorphic widescreen is the worst of both worlds! The movie however is quite touching and well played by Alex Kendrick - it certainly belies its production budget and you get drawn into the characters rather than the limited technical prowess. The makers should be proud.

The second film 'Facing the Giants' is technically better, and features a bigger cast and a bigger story. Its a huge but enjoyable leap, whilst still retaining the heart and values of the first film. I enjoyed it immensely and it also has some very good extras. As a package these are very good value for money and I enjoyed seeing the film makers confidence transition over the two movies.

Looking forward to Fireproof!",1225324800,,999,4.670454545454546
3058093,5,B00110WFUQ,"Both were surprisingly entertaining films, especially Flywheel considering it was the first of these - made with a minimal budget.
If you like inspiring stories of success out of integrity and love, these are well worth watching. They're tear jerkers sometimes, yet funny also.

The picture quality is adequate, though why oh why SOny didn't make it an anamorphic release is totally beyond me - non anamorphic widescreen is the worst of both worlds! The movie however is quite touching and well played by Alex Kendrick - it certainly belies its production budget and you get drawn into the characters rather than the limited technical prowess. The makers should be proud.

The second film 'Facing the Giants' is technically better, and features a bigger cast and a bigger story. Its a huge but enjoyable leap, whilst still retaining the heart and values of the first film. I enjoyed it immensely and it also has some very good extras. As a package these are very good value for money and I enjoyed seeing the film makers confidence transition over the two movies.

Looking forward to Fireproof!",1225324800,,999,4.670454545454546
3292590,5,B00110WFUQ,"Both were surprisingly entertaining films, especially Flywheel considering it was the first of these - made with a minimal budget.
If you like inspiring stories of success out of integrity and love, these are well worth watching. They're tear jerkers sometimes, yet funny also.
2 thumbs up!!",1224547200,5,291,5.212765957446808
