2963448,5,B000W90SMY,"This movie brings Ti Lung and David Chiang back together again. If you have watched Water Margin, then this is a must have. The copy itself is clean and crisp and great audio as well. The action is hard and combat all the way but has the signature Chika chika chi-ka sound for David Chiang's character.",1408838400,3,302,4.410714285714286
2963449,5,B000W90SMY,This is a really good movie on some of the history of that error.  Also there is good kung fu too,1400544000,,97,3.619047619047619
2963450,4,B000W90SMY,"This Movie is the sequal as posted. They tried very hard to bring out the same power of 7 Blows. I won't say that they did it, however if you look at it as a different movie it is very good. Either way its worth getting. The fights are good. The out come isn't the same as 7 Blows. And there are some sad parts to this movie. Its action packet and fighting is pretty good. They spent much money on this one. And the music score is similar to 7 blows. If your a fan of Shaw brothers then you will like this movie.",1198713600,,512,3.8857142857142857

8221698,2,B000W90SMY,"This movie is dubbed in Mandarin and has no English subtitles (on the streaming version) even when the subtitles are turned on in the settings.  The story is very basic.  The new emperor is not a good one as he seems to not care much about the commoners.  So, a clan of rebellions organized themselves to take down this emperor as previous rebellious forces failed to take down this newly installed emperor.  The emperor is surrounded by bad advisors and generals.  Being that the rebels cannot seem to reach the emperor, they decide to go after the advisors and generals.  The fight scenes are not very well choreographed as the kung-fu displayed are rudimentary.  The rebel forces hired various experts to penetrate the emperor's palace which is well guarded both by land and by sea.  It's a slow paced movie in the first half, but it picks up later.  The story is just too weak in that it's just about rebels going after the emperor's guards and the guards go after the rebels. The end.",1522627200,,989,4.605714285714286
8221699,1,B000W90SMY,"This is a critique on the streamed version NOT the DVD.  The Streamed Version has no proper subtitles. I am aware the actors are speaking in a foreign language. It's Mandarin. As I do not speak the language, I rely on subtitles. I was informed last week this problem would be corrected. Nothing has been done nearly a week later.

This movie is part of the story line I am following from The Water Margin and would like to continue it. Kindly fix the problem Amazon.",1520121600,,466,4.406976744186046
8221700,1,B000W90SMY,"I could not actually finish seeing the movie as there are no English subs or English dubbing. The previous comments are related to a DVD version and I tried the streaming version.

Again, the streaming version lacks either English subs or English dubbing which I am sure would be on the DVD.

Amazon, please fix it.",1519603200,2,315,4.607142857142857

I am so happy that it is dubbed over in english and the martial arts was choriographed wonderfully.  I wish I had every movie that Ti was in.  You will love the action in this movie.",1424476800,,279,3.9464285714285716
