However, there are several different releases of this Movie on DVD - do not waste your money on any of them; I bought all three hoping each time to replace my VHS shop-bought Video Copy for my Collection, but the quality of these DVDs are horrendous...

 I don't know what is wrong; they all look like copies of a copy of a copy... I thought DVDs were supposed to give you a better quality source than Video Tapes - like CDs are supposed to be better quality than records, but this isn't the case with this particular Movie 'Twinky'/'Lola'.  I can't understand why no one is doing anything about this; something is very wrong.  What Master Tape are they using for these DVD releases??  The most recent release of only this month (March 2006) is no better, but exactly the same as the others...

If anyone feels the same, then please email me and let's get together to get this out on DVD properly! In the meantime, I'm holding on to my Video release which is FABULOUS quality!  Instead of buying any of the DVD releases available, look around for a looked-after Video release.

Another Movie which has exactly the same problem as these is 'The Beast In The Cellar' - same story with regard to quality.",1144022400,13,1297,4.536480686695279
