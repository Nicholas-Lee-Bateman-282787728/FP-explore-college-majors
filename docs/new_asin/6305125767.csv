968830,1,6305125767,"Boring.  Could have done better.  I had to hit fast-forward button on my remote control to some pieces of its story that I need to know before ""wrapping up"" this movie (finish at its ending credits).",1439683200,,199,4.5
968831,5,6305125767,Very good movie.  You need to pay attention to the episodes so you will understand the ending.,1439596800,,94,4.529411764705882
968832,4,6305125767,"it's real, although not real enough; it only scratches the surface. it's been liberally sugar coated, but still worth watching.",1438992000,,127,5.4
968833,1,6305125767,The worst movie ever!,1438819200,,21,4.5
968834,5,6305125767,"So experimental that it is almost unwatchable. Don't watch it for entertainment, and it is pretty repulsive. But with those qualifications I give it five stars because it is so very brave in an effort to be creative and there are some brilliant ideas crammed into it and it can even be quite touching.

If you are interested in independent experimental films, take note of this one. I would love to see what some of this talent might do in the future if given the chance and with a few years to reflect on this work. I see a lot of artistic potential here in terms of cinematography, script, direction, acting, etc. At times I thought, Ken Russell meets John Waters.

It is worth mentioning that I think some reviewers are wrong in calling this a gay themed film. True there are mostly gay characters in it. But so what? It is more about down-and-outers and the seamy side of life where money and hard breaks rule and yet where compassion sometimes has a chance. This is not to say that the story is all that important, it is mostly the way the film is ""done.""  I think the ""low-life"" gay stuff just contributes to the overall exotic and gritty atmosphere.

The short ""Loopy"" was a cute experimental short of the sort that would fit in well with other shorts at a film festival.

All in all, this film will only be appreciated by certain types of viewers -- perhaps those who like to check out film festivals for new talent.",1315612800,,1424,4.440613026819923
968835,1,6305125767,"This was a terrible movie, but the short, ""Loopy,"" is a gem.  It's the work of two film students and I believe served as their thesis.  A retelling of ""Little Red Riding Hood,"" it serves up chills, good acting, and the best wolf costume in existence.",1239753600,,250,4.413043478260869
968836,3,6305125767,I consider the movie to be average; it did not appear to be a particularly clever take on the original tale - and the acting didn't particularly engage me.,1154649600,,155,4.379310344827586
968837,2,6305125767,"I wanted to like this movie so much more than I actually did. Unfortately it was pretty much a mess from beginning to end.

A great performance from Anthony Crivello though.",1152748800,4,173,4.580645161290323
968838,4,6305125767,"What really makes this low-budget, indi film are the magnificent performances of this highly talented ensemble cast. Seth Michael Donsky, who wrote and directed it, had an excellent idea: set Charles Dickens' classic ""Oliver Twist"" in contemporary New York City. God knows, not much has changed since Dickens wrote his socially critical study of a young orphan boy, caught in the grips of an unfair society. With the low-budget that Donsky obviously had, he makes a valiant attempt at creating a visually dark and atmospheric montage of the underbelly of modern urban society. He doesn't always succeed, and the film is at points muddled, but the ultimate effect is strong.
The Twist: ""Oliver"", or as he's called here, Lee, has run away from an abusive foster home and fines comfort and shelter from the elderly street performer, Can Man (beautifully played by Ray Aranha). Can Man teaches him about dreams being the basis of hope, and how you must keep your dreams safe. After Can Man is brutally murdered by a gang of thugs, Lee is comforted and brought ""home"" by Fine Art - a cute take off on ""The Artful Dodger"". Fine Art (Jean Loup Wolfman gives an eerie performance) is a young call-boy living in Andre's all-male brothel. The elderly Andre (no less than William Hickey) is the story's Euro-trash version of ""Fagan"", who is reliant on Eddie (akin to ""Bill Sykes"") for the house's supply of drugs. Eddie (a scary performance by Anthony Crivello) has a fairly large revere in the city under his control. He pimps his boys and runs his deals, and no one gets in his way and lives to tell about it. Angel (a beautiful and sensitive performance by David Norona) is Eddie's ""Nancy"". All Angel wants out of life is to make Eddie happy, and become a serious musician. The first is impossible and the later doesn't suit Eddie.
Angel meets Lee at Andre's and take an instant liking to the child. He starts meeting Lee regularly to give him piano lessons. Andre of course, has a different career plan in mind for Lee and sends him out with Fine Art to learn the delicate art of hustling. Unfortunately, they hustle an undercover cop, who snaps Lee and turns him over to the juvenal authorities. Eddie and Andre fear what Lee might say, and strong-arm Angel into ""kidnapping"" him from the police.
In the end, Angel - along with his best friend, the drag queen, Shiniqua (Billy Porter is worth the price of the video), make a daring attempt at saving Lee's life while risking their own.
Independent movie-making almost at its best!",1005177600,22,2524,4.72562358276644
