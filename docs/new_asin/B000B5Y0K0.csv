8081924,1,B000B5Y0K0,"I can't understand why the powers that be

would bring thia piece of c**p out on dvd

and completely ignore that terrific gem

TELEPHON.I am not a big Bronson fan,but

his performance along with Lee Remick

in Telephon was great.",1176854400,5,229,4.625
8081925,1,B000B5Y0K0,"i'd give the three movies in order

1.cold sweat=2 1/2

2.guns of diablo=3

3.someone behind the door=2

 i give this hopless transfer no stars as they look like they fished their copy out of the river before they dubed it. skip this and look for better copies!!!!",1150070400,13,264,4.531914893617022
8081926,3,B000B5Y0K0,"The 1st of this trilogy, ""Guns of Diablo,"" apparently a 1964(?) piece, is somewhat reminicient of a milder version of ""The Magnificent Seven,"" also starring Susan Oliver. ""Cold Sweat,"" a 1970 movie, is much more traditional Bronson, with more suspense, and a spectacular car chase. The last of the three presented, ""Someone Behind The Door,"" a 1971 release, has a rather frustrating, twisted plot, limiting useage of Bronson's best acting talents. Overall, this is an interesting smorgasboard for comparison to Bronson's later, superior works.",1142726400,6,543,5.476190476190476
