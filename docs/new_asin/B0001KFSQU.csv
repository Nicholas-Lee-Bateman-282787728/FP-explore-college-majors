8013609,5,B0001KFSQU,"The Book of Five Rings is difficult even for someone with swordsmanship training to understand.  Dr. Alexander's thorough explanation of the five chapters of Musashi's summation of his many years as a sword strategist is very helpful to obtain an overall feel for the development and emphasis of Musashi's themes.  The demonstrations of the stances, cuts and techniques really bring the concepts to life.  Anyone interested in Musashi or in the history of Japanese swordsmanship will enjoy this presentation and find it useful in their sword practice.",1209427200,3,551,5.310344827586207
