8650692,1,B00JGMSBSG,Turned out to be a movie that could not be played in the US. Had to return it. I watched the movie on Netflix originally and loved the story so much I wanted a copy. Will keep looking around until I find the right one. Sweet quirky story (Korean).,1427328000,2,247,4.061224489795919
8650693,4,B00JGMSBSG,"I saw this movie years ago (when I was a Comcast customer).  The movie is hilarious, thought provoking, and emphasis the idea that failure can lead to amazing outcomes.
The movie is about a businessman who loses everything and attempts to commit suicide by jumping into the Han River.  Well, he isn't successful and ends up on an island in the middle of the Han River.  The movie follows his ordeal as he tries desperately to grow the ingredients for black bean noodles (flashbacks will tell you why this has become an obsession to him).  He develops an unlikely relationship with a very reclusive hermit, who lives in an apartment with her mother.  They communicate by writing letters in the sand (for him) and throwing bottles out at night (for her).

Oh, the island is too far for him to swim to shore and his pleas for help are drowned out by the city noise.  Which is just hilarious when you realize just how ironic his situation is.
It is funny and beautiful.",1419379200,,965,4.543352601156069
