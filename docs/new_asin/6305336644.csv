7887808,4,6305336644,"We all know who lost the Battle of Waterloo.  Yet even now, after more than 180 years, the debate still rages about who actually ""won"" the battle.  The noted historian and former head of War Studies at Sandhurst, David Chandler, gives expert testimony to overstate the obvious:  D'Erlon's thirty thousand un-used troops at both Quatre Bas and Ligny saved both the English and Prussians from certain disaster and the outcome of Waterloo was directly affected by this crucial mistake.  The video also has some great scenes from the famous movie ""Waterloo"" from 1970 and an in-depth analysis of early 19th Century strategies (e.g. Napoleon's famous ""Central Strategy"" and Wellington's use of ""Reverse Slopes"").  The Prussian contributions are not neglected until the very end.  For some reason, the makers of this video saw fit to exclude them from the final assault on Napoleon's right flank when the battle was indeed still in question.  Most historians now agree that Wellington did not advance the Allied line until informed that the Prussians had arrived in strength and that Napoleon's forces were already reeling all across the battlefield.  Allied mistakes are pretty much overlooked except for Wellington's famous ""Humbugged, by God!"" epiphet after learning that Napoleon was closing in on him.  Marshal Blucher is given his due and cited for both his bravery and his determination to get to Waterloo before it was too late.  All in all, this video will help a novice historian in discovering this famous battle.  The narration of Robert Powell is also excellent (if a bit pro-British).  Wellington and Blucher did meet and shake hands after the battle was over and congratulate each other on a job well-done.  It would behoove historians on both the Prussian side and the British side to learn from that generous gesture of these outstanding commanders. It would also be well-advised to revive this gracious practice among these same ""historians"".",995328000,19,1954,5.1455696202531644
7887809,4,6305336644,"One of the most epic battles ever fought, This video of ""Waterloo"" grandstands the pageantry and pomp surrounding the inter-relationships between common man and gentry within the context of  open battlefield warfare!
You can witness the colour and splendour of  the uniforms in their magnificence as the Generals, like shepherds  mustering sheep, herd their masses of men ""to & fro"" to their  deaths.
Witness how the apparent flippency of these actions belie the  calculation and orchestration of primal strategies relating to this era of  open battlefield warfare.
This video helped place into context for me  numerous events of the battle which had only been envisaged through books,  such as distances between opposing lines and ""flanks"" and sizes  and numbers of armies and cavalries etc. Also I was able to better  understand the the entry of ""Blucher"" and his Prussian army into  the battle, and more importantly the timing and effect this had on the  outcome.
Awesome!",962496000,23,975,5.17948717948718
