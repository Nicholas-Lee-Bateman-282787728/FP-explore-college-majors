8111142,4,B000EMG92M,"I won't waste anyone's time by writing too much about the plot, because to be honest, there isn't that much plot.  But that's not a put-down.  It's just a fair assessment of the movie, and of life.  It's about the summer that everyone has at one point in their life or another: when do I grow up and take responsibility and how do I balance that with keeping a childlike wonder and optimism about the world.  For example, Karen Cliche's character is an actress who starts a relationship with an up-and-coming actor in the hopes that her relationship with him will advance her career.  Will she stay with him or choose one of her best guy friends who's always respected her and had a crush on her?  Of course, we all know the answer to that one.  Despite that, the movie remains an entertaining, truthful, funny, and sincere look at growing up in Montreal.  And this is a TV movie, by the way!  I wish there were more honest, intelligent, and entertaining coming-of-age movies like this one rather than the countless ""trying-so-hard-to-be-hip"" teen comedies that are produced every year.",1119744000,2,1086,4.703703703703703
