8024791,4,B00029PLZS,"If you've ever wondered about Bishop, California's Mule Days, here's your chance to find out what it's all about.  Longears Everywhere is an introduction/documentary on some of the people, events, and history of Bishop's annual celebration.  The narrative of the interviewer is relaxed and colloquial, but will give you a taste of what to expect if you're planning on visiting Mule Days.

An IMPORTANT note about the DVD media: This disc won't play in all DVD players.  The following text-sticker is affixed inside the case:

This is a custom made DVD-R disc.  This disc is playable on 95% of current table-model DVD players.  Some computer DVD players do not play the DVD-R format.  If your table-model DVD player is older or an odd model that does not play this custom DVD, please obtain an appropriate DVD player or VHS tape copy.

(I especially like that last sentence about how to resolve this problem!)  In fact, I couldn't play the disc on an older (1998) model player, but it worked fine using a newer (2004) model.",1143676800,,1023,4.7942857142857145
