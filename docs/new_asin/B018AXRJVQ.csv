8741957,5,B018AXRJVQ,"""Waiting in the Summer"" is a 12-episode, slice-of-life, romantic-comedy.  It runs about the perfect length and wraps up nicely with a bit of a teaser that could leave open a second season, but isn't a blatant cliff-hanger.  It follows the story of 6 teenagers wanting to make a summer film to show off at school.  What originally begins as a semi-frivolous project quickly becomes much more meaningful to all of them.  It was directed by Nagai Tatsuyuki, whose other directorial credits include ""Anohana"" and ""Toradora!"".  (I secretly believe that his director is a mad genius because he ""trains"" you to react emotionally to certain songs.  Even now if I hear particular songs, I'll immediately flash back to those moments in the series.)  I became emotionally invested with the characters and almost stood up and cheered at some moments in the show (damn music!).  Obviously I recommend it for anyone interested in this genre.",1489104000,,927,5.0130718954248366

8741959,5,B018AXRJVQ,"J.C. Staff brings you another excellent Rom Com.
Spanning 12 episodes, this rom com examines the life of a small group of friends in high school.  When a beautiful exchange student moves to their school, the fine balance maintained by romantic interests and friendships are thrown into chaos.  Fairly typical teenagers in high school setup with a twist.  However, this is not a show with endless sequels.  Decisions are made and hearts are broken.

Fairly light on the fan service (there is some) this show favors laughs, a few out of this world scenarios and several heart felt moments to move the story along.  Definitely one for the collection.

Recommended if you were a fan of Toradora! (same studio), or Please Teacher! (same author for source material)",1473897600,,759,4.929133858267717
8741960,4,B018AXRJVQ,"If you have ever watched the anime Please Teacher than you will know what you are in for. Both are eerily similar to each other to a degree that you begin searching for a connection between them. If you love Please Teacher, you will like to this show.",1466294400,,251,4.25
8741961,5,B018AXRJVQ,"Its A higher pedigree version of please teacher and that's a good and bad thing over all a better anime with good characters with some stand out that do not feel stereo typical. They have good twists to there archetypes. With good music and a story that floes well and does not trip over its self. so pretty good slice of life drama./SYFI?

Not for everyone but I think that all slice of life shows.",1465171200,,399,4.32

8741963,5,B018AXRJVQ,"Not to go into any depth regarding this series other than the fact that it is very good. I only watched three programs so far but they have been very entertaining and highly recommend anyone who enjoys anime to watch this series. The only negative is that you have to read subtitles and watch at the same time. Also the fact that for some reason there are a lot of misspelled words. Oh well, I guess you can't have everything. Just buy it and enjoy it...",1458086400,,454,4.290697674418604
