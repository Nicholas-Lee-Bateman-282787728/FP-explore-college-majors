900261,2,6304586582,"FEVER LAKE is tedious, derivative, full of plot holes and inconsistencies.  Corey Haim, the glory boy of the 80s, tries playing a college freshman, and even though he still looks pretty young, he doesn't look young enough to be that.  Add Bo Hopkins as the local sheriff, looking dyspeptic to say the least and Michael Wise as a demon spouting Indian, you have the first inclination of the movie's problems.  IN the opening scene, a father chops up his wife, and looks up at his son who has been hidden in the attic and says ""You're cursed..just like me.""  Then his eyes glow green and that's it for that segment.  Segue into the present day (although one has to wonder; the opening sequence looks like it was in the 40s; if that was the case, the little boy would be at least in his fifties by now).  Anyway, Corey has invited five of his friends to join him at where else, Fever Lake, for a weekend getaway.  Of course, the townspeople don't cotton to strangers so they immediately suspect the kids of something, although the local teen waitress tells them the gory history of Fever Lake, which is reinforced by the local fish bait store manager.  If you listen to his tales, you will find that the script doesn't stick to the stories; for instance, there's no little boy this time.  Well, the evil finally gets released from the lake and the kids find themselves hacked up....if you can't figure out who the killer is, you haven't watched enough slasher films.
This wouldn't be so bad, but the acting is abysmmal, the direction shoddy, and the background music altogether annoying and inappropriate.
FEVER LAKE will go on Mr. haim's resume as another attempt to recapture the youth of the 80s.",1090022400,2,1696,4.626666666666667
900262,1,6304586582,"The acting was horrible and the directing was even worse. What the hell were they thinking? It starts off interesting enough with a man chasing a woman down with an axe and slicing her to bits, then the killer looks up at this little boy that's hiding in the attic and says something about it'll happen to you and it just ends there. How dumb, boring, and pathetic waste of time. AVOID!",1065657600,4,386,4.375
900263,2,6304586582,"the only thing good about this movie is that it has corey haim.  that is it, guys.  also, it's laughability factor, assuming you go into it knowing that it's got more cheese than wisconsin.  it's even got the white guy dressed up as an indian, who, of course, is in touch with the land and its spirits (can we say STEREOTYPICAL?).  well... it's also got mario lopez, post-SBTB and pre-other half.  which has to count for something.
but yeah, as a corey fan, i don't regret buying this movie.  had someone else played his role, tho, i'd be pretty disappointed.",1037059200,,559,4.54
900264,1,6304586582,"This trash DTV horror film should have been released as a DTG (Direct-to-Garbage). Horrible acting, accompanied by lousy script, direction and a completely ridiculous spoof of the Shining at the beggining make this film one of the worst that I have ever viewed.",967852800,2,261,5.093023255813954
900265,1,6304586582,"What isn't wrong with this movie? First of all, lets start the ridiculous use of stock footage from a discovery channel program about wolves, terribly editted into the movie.  Next... the use of a white man in the  role of the indian, who by the way, couldn't act a lick.  We also see some  of the worst acting from the worst assemblence of has-beens.  Corey Haim  and Mario Lopez should immediately fire their agents. Nothing in this movie  made any sense.  Talk about huge plot holes! There is about 78 continuity  errors.  What power of evil are we dealing with here?  The evil that  bubbles from the lake has such random, ludicrous powers that control a  wolf, can make cars mysteriously run out of gas, knows how to use a laptop  computer and can turn our beloved Corey Haim into a raving psycho.  This  movie is the biggest bag over the head.  There seems like there are four  movies intertwined into one awful plot.  Some scenes should have been left  on the cutting room floor, especially any involving the incompetent police  officer who wore the same jeans throughout the movie.  Can we get a better  wardrobe budget please! All in all, this movie looks like it cost $1000 to  make and grossed even less.  However, if you want a good laugh, watch this  movie.  You'll chuckle at the fact that Corey haim is 35 years old and once  again playing a teenager. Will this guy ever escape typecasting?  The sad  fact is, the director didn't even think to shave Haim's dirtstache before  shooting.  This movie should have been called ""Script should have been  thrown in the lake"".  I actually felt nausious after viewing this  piece of garbage.  I totaly lost faith in the American filmmakers guild.  I  don't know how this movie made it to HBO or let alone was funded for.  The  more I think about it, the more it has become clear to me that everybody  should see this movie just to laugh and realize that Hollywood is spuing us  a huge pile of puke.",956620800,10,1953,4.510086455331412
900266,4,6304586582,"As I say,the first half is worth watching and last half is realy boring. Besides, Mario Lopez,Corey Haim and Randy Josseyln are very cute!",949104000,,138,4.791666666666667
7874440,2,6304586582,"A bit bizarre, and as you would expect with a movie of this caliber, crappy acting, but it's actually not as bad as I'd thought it would be once they stopped plagiarizing Friday the 13th and other such pioneering movies.",1508025600,,220,4.525
7874441,1,6304586582,Really bad flick. The killer in the first scenes looks as if he'd taken too many laxatives and was trying to not let go.,1507852800,,120,4.041666666666667

7874444,3,6304586582,"I love this movie! Only 3 stars because its kind of dumb, but still funny and enjoyable. Some things didn't make sense in the end, but still had a few scary moments. Bought it because some of it was filmed at carthage college.",1389916800,,226,4.27906976744186
7874445,3,6304586582,I only bought this movie because of the late and great Corey Haim for my collection. It was a very predictable movie and cheesy.,1285977600,,128,4.375
7874446,3,6304586582,3*s. Nice treat is seeing actors Corey Haim and Mario Lopez in the same movie.,1242604800,,78,4.266666666666667
7874447,2,6304586582,"You knew what you were getting into when you saw the cover, right? No? Caught it on late-night? I'm sorry to hear that...

We can not blame the actors here. No, this is sloppy, horrific, editing and direction. The director it would seem had a hard time coaxing the best from his actors, who, while not overtly talented, could've been motivated and bumped to do better. Sloppy direction combined with useless editing (some of the worst I've seen), wrecked this movie from attaining B-flick status. Still...

This is good for laughs (see the getting pulled over sequence) no doubt about it. From the goofy Indian (played by a white dude), to that mildly retarded wolf, over to the wretched make-up. The script is dreadful...and that's a good thing if you're looking for fun.

I have, believe it or not, seen worse. Just look at any of Feldman's work circa '95.

I don't know...rent it if you are a Haim or Slater fan, or just into awful productions.",1218240000,,947,4.652694610778443
7874448,1,6304586582,"Before I read any reviews on ""Fever Lake"" I had already bought the dvd. However, before I watched it I did read the reviews. I said to myself.. ""This movie can't be as bad as these folks are saying."".. I know Corey Haim hasn't done much to do cart wheels over in many years but, I was hoping this might be at least decent!! To my sadness the reviews were very right! Avoid this one if at all possible. Basically everything the other reviewers said came true before my eyes. Will Haim ever have a comeback movie?? As of now it doesn't seem so but, I am still a fan of his early works like ""Lucas"", ""Lost Boys"" and, a couple others.",1162857600,,630,4.172131147540983
7874449,1,6304586582,cory hamm isn't going to save his cereer by making junk like this. the story is so thin even the writers can't figure out what's going on.just a waste of time and money,1146873600,,168,4.121212121212121
