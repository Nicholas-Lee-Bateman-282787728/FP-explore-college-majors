6853932,5,B00Q4MRSLM,"Of all the live action interpretations I've seen - Death Note, Blood+, Dororo, et al, this series is the BEST, hands down. The actors do an awesome job, the action is very well choreographed (AND executed), and though the story isn't exactly like the series, the changes do not take away from the essence. If you love Kenshin, you will be pleased- this second movie is a great; maybe even better than the 1st!",1420156800,10,409,4.54054054054054

6853935,5,B00Q4MRSLM,"As a fan of the Anime, Rurouni Kenshin was a great live action adaptation. Not exactly like the Anime for obvious  reasons. A movie is just to short pull off an exact adaptation.",1454630400,,178,4.393939393939394
6853936,4,B00Q4MRSLM,Worth the money for for die-hard fans,1447113600,,37,4.428571428571429
6853937,5,B00Q4MRSLM,"This is a fantastic movie which follows the manga and anime just enough to please fans but also changes just enough to add a new dynamic to the story. I won't say much so as not to spoil the movie but I will say the fight sequences are spectacular. The final fight, especially, is one you will not forget any time soon.

The acting is great with lots of emotion and there is enough going on to keep the tempo moving at a fast pace from beginning to end. The downside is some of the characters you may love are given abbreviated screentime - such as Soujuro or Sano.

Well worth the purchase and one which even non-Kenshin fans can enjoy.",1443571200,,637,4.256198347107438
6853938,2,B00Q4MRSLM,Love the movie! Disappointed with the video and subs quality. this seems to be common as it happened in other JP movies i purchased here. Get the blue-ray version and hope subs don't fall short.,1441929600,,194,4.571428571428571

6853942,4,B00Q4MRSLM,"The Movie: Ever since getting hooked on the anime, then the manga, this series has always occupied a special place in my heart. You can tell by watching the live action adaptations the director, actors, and production staff share these same feelings. Though changes were made to the original arc to logically follow the adaptation presented in the first movie, they make sense and show character development. That said, because they were hampered by the universe they'd established in the first movie, new characters arrive on the scene with obvious pasts, but with no time to properly fill in those pasts. those new to the series may find the pathos a bit weak for the new characters. Devoted fans can easily fill in the blanks (and chatter endlessly to argue for their favorite supporting male/female) and as I'm one of them, I was extremely impressed with how well every actor embraced their role. As always, the action is fantastic and proves a good action-adventure does not need a lot of CGI to make fight scenes any less thrilling. THE DVD: arrived intact, unscratched, and in beautiful condition. The quality is outstanding and the translation is very good. The subtitling tracks appropriately with the dialogue (one of my biggest pet peeves) and you'll be disappointed when the cliffhanger suddenly appears and you're left scrambling to put in the next disc.",1437091200,,1367,4.973799126637554

6853944,5,B00Q4MRSLM,Beautiful steel-book. The live action Kenshin trilogy features some of the most exhilarating sword based action sequences ever put on film. Love these movies and I highly recommend this limited steel-book.,1435968000,,205,5.645161290322581

6853946,5,B00Q4MRSLM,"Excellently acted live action version of the anime I grew up loving. Great production values,help tell the story that is a paired down version of season two of the television series. Despite the compacted story, it still manages to hit every important point of this first half of the second season. My only complaint would be the cliff hanger ending, I hate those! However as the second half is already out, I didn't have to wait to see it. If you loved Kenshin as much as I do you won't be disappointed in this movie!",1434326400,,518,4.463157894736842

I have seen some of the Kenshin anise's abd the actors did a great job depicting the story to the tee. I would recommend it to others who like Kenshin.",1432684800,,286,4.071428571428571

6853964,5,B00Q4MRSLM,The whole trilogy was close to perfect.,1427932800,,39,4.714285714285714
6853965,4,B00Q4MRSLM,Very good continuation from where they left off.  The only bummer is that this is just part 1 so you have to buy part 2 to see the ending.  I haven't bought that yet.  But the subtitles seemed good and pretty accurate and the video quality was also good.  The fighting scenes were well done but not as much as the first Rurouni Kenshin or maybe I just really liked them because I hadn't seen such great fight scene with excellent editing and minimal wire work.  The DVD came on time and in good condition.  No complaints.,1427846400,,521,4.319587628865979
6853966,5,B00Q4MRSLM,I absolutely love this trilogy. I was so excited to finally have my copy of this movie since I had to wait six extra months after it came out for someone to sell it on Amazon. The action sequences are amazing and I am so glad that they kept to the original storyline so closely. This movie comes with subtitles and the quality of the English subtitles is really good. I recommend this seller.,1427155200,,392,4.3108108108108105

6853969,3,B00Q4MRSLM,"The Movie was ok. But i really preferred the anime. I don't know if it was because it was a live action movie. bye didn't give Kaoru, Yahiko and Sano the Strength they have in the anime. Even Misao was much stronger character in the anime. In the movie the got a more secondary part Even Kenshin master. In the anime he had a stronger personality.
Maybe its because they tried make movie more realistic...In the anime the Kenshin master was deliciously irritating. In movie.. not so... Yet I had a good time with the movie. week build plot anad as true as the anime as a more realistic movie would allow...
I kind of expected more... considering how popular  the anime is.
Also this is a movie is a connection between 1st and 3rd..from a trilogy., usually those sandwiched episodes movies aren't great as the first and the last of trilogies.(I make exception to the 2 of lord of rings, only.)",1426636800,,892,4.506172839506172
6853970,1,B00Q4MRSLM,"Movie was amazing!!!!! But this is Amazon and we rate the seller and their product. This is not an original!!! This was definitely pirated and filmed from the screen. Although they did a good job at camouflaging it, it's still pretty obvious. Just buy it from Australia because it was actually released in English there...",1426464000,,322,4.872727272727273

6853979,5,B00Q4MRSLM,"This movie, as a whole, is absolutely spectacular. I was so very pleased with the first one, and I really didn't expect the second one to match up. I was wondering, first of all, how they would depict the decidedly cartoonish Juppon-Gatana, how on earth they would manage to introduce Aoshi Shinomori and Misao (considering that they altered the storyline so much in the first film), and how on earth they were going to manage to compress all of the ""filler"" that was in the manga and anime during this arc.

I need not have been concerned, it turns out. Yes, some things were changed, but they were somewhat necessary. They did a reasonable job explaining Aoshi's appearance, though it certainly would have been easier if they had just left things how they were originally. They also did a pretty good job hurrying along certain elements that were very detail-rich in the anime and manga, while not making the story feel rushed.

By far, the most incredible thing about this movie is that they managed to keep the characters' integrity. That is something that seems impossible in most anime movies. All the characters acted and behaved just like I would imagine they would in real life. They changed the story around a bit, but not in ways that hurt it. If you've watched the anime or read the manga, this will be a real treat for you. If you haven't, then you're going to be incredibly confused. I highly recommend acquainting yourself with this series in those forms before you watch these films.

As far as the packaging/quality of this particular copy goes, it's pretty good. An obvious bootleg, but not as bad as some I've seen. Some people have commented on the subtitles being a little bit broken, but I think that part of that is the odd way that Kenshin usually speaks (adding ""Yoda-like"" endings to his sentences). Some of it is a little too literally translated, but it gets the point across, and it's totally worth it to be able to see the movie now before it's officially released in the USA (and goodness knows when that will be).",1424908800,6,2045,4.643646408839779
6853980,5,B00Q4MRSLM,"This is a great live action film. Probably the best anime to live action there is.
This DVD is pretty good picture quality. Could be better. The subtitles are decent and not too much of a problem for me.
Sometimes Kenshin speaks oddly and the translation may seem weird but that is basically how he talks...like Yoda.
Overall this is a great preliminary DVD to own until a big corporation officially produces these films.",1424822400,2,421,4.702702702702703
6853981,5,B00Q4MRSLM,"This movie successfully avoid the pitfall of disappointing-sequel! Any fan of the original (especially the manga) will be more than pleased with this live-action retelling. It's full of action, full of heart, and full of glorious character portrayals - about as close to perfect as you get!",1424736000,,290,5.191489361702128

6853993,5,B00Q4MRSLM,"The live action adaptation was very entertaining. I was impressed with how well they stayed true to the anime without giving me the feeling I was watching performers act like cartoons. Amazing action. Very well executed. They did adapt the plot to fit the time frame of a movie (with the understanding that this movie has a second part- Rurouni Kenshin the Legend Ends) so it ends on a bit of a cliff hanger, but I felt they covered more of the original plot fom the anime and manga than I expected them to in that much time. If you are already a fan of RK, I think it is worth watching all 3 live action movies.",1423612800,,612,4.239316239316239

6853996,4,B00Q4MRSLM,"I loved the movie itself. I personally rate it 5 stars because the fighting scenes were amazing and I just absolutely love how Takeru Satoh played his role as Kenshin. Great storyline and I can't wait to buy the next movie when it comes out in HD on DVD.
I just didn't like the quality it came in. It hurt my eyes with how jarring the scenes were visually (it wasn't smooth and fluid). The subtitles had grammatical errors -but you can understand what they mean to say. I do hope they come out with a better quality one eventually.

8690288,1,B00Q4MRSLM,"I do not as a practice give one star reviews, however this is an exception. It has come to my knowledge that Amazon has accepted for sale at its portal some foreign films, not all from the same country, these are films that have no translation and no subtitles. That's fine because there are people who can understand the language. OK.

I purchased this DVD and promptly found that does not play in this region and that region happens to be America. OK.

Now I contacted the seller and the seller promptly told me that they announce that the DVD only plays in certain regions. It was not something, obviously, that was apparent to me or I would not have ordered the DVD. Now my problem is now I'm feeling like it was my fault I didn't know the DVD wasn't for American viewing and I feel bad. So now I have to tell everybody the guy made me feel like a dope and on top of that I can't find the DVD to send it back. So lesson learned.

Now, I have been ordering these Chinese movies and a couple of eastern european movies or two and they have no translation and no subtitles, There used to be a standard to sell in this marketplace, and there is no longer a standard where you sell movies that english speaking people can understand what is said. OK.
I will try not to buy movies who's languages I cannot understand so I will not get frustrated. I have to admit, however, the movies are not bad movies, but you just miss knowing what the plot is and what some important conversations are;. That's it.",1470009600,,1499,4.289752650176679
