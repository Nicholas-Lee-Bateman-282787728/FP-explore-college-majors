7872550,5,6304475101,"A very interesting film made from contemporary documents about a complex and ambiguous character who was the First Lady of Argentina in the mid-twentieth century .  She was a very strong young woman (Madonna is a very pale and very bad copy in Evita"", the film from Parker). Some saw Pern's wife as a whore, others as a holy woman, it summarizes all the ambiguity of Eva.  Anyway, in her action well and evil were mixed. She worked to give a better way of life for poor people but often used despicable and terrible means against opposition. Eva Duarte de Pern had no political consciousness, no moral principles but her own. She was not a good actress but had an extraordinary sense of theater. At the end of her life, although suffering martyrdom, she even stage her own death, so that her death, only at 33, serves Peronist propaganda. Megalomania? Fanaticism? Courage? Probably all three. Because even if you don't like her; you have to admit it took probably fanaticism but also a lot of courage to face death in this way. The mummification and complicated history of her corpse added elements to her legend. Who was really Maria Eva Duarte de Pern? Even now, its difficult to know her.",1361836800,,1191,4.666666666666667

I wished A&E would have released a 90 minute biography of Eva Pern. What we have here is a documentary that is less than 60 minutes and although it does its job in trying to explain the legend and legacy of the mythic Eva, most of her story remains untold. There is a lot this woman accomplished in her short life time and she aroused such fierce passions that even after her death, the mere mention of her name would cause controversy and riots.

Narrated by Jack Perkins, this biography traces Eva's meteoric rise from her humble beginnings to becoming one of the most powerful woman in the world. It includes several photographs and archival film footage. For the most part, the footage is pretty clear, especially the segment showcasing her ""Rainbow Tour""- her visit to Europe in1947, where she looks radiant, glamourous and beautiful. The remainder of the footage is choppy and can be seen in countless other documentaries but the quality here is much cleaner. Highlights include some interesting pics of Eva during her years as an actress, revealing commentaries from historians and biographers (Tomas Eloy Martinez, Maryssa Navarro) and Eva Pern's friends and rivals, including some bitter commentary from her actress rival Libertad Lamarque (1908-2000), and some haunting photos of Eva's embalmed corpse in colour. This is one of the more engrossing Biography episodes in the long series and although it tries to be objective, it does repeat some mis-information. This is forgivable though since the woman herself has become such an enigma, it is increasingly difficult in trying to establish what is truth and what is just bad gossip from those who had a bone to pick with her as a woman, a demanding actress, or a fiery politician. Take the good with the bad and hopefully this biography will push those that are still interested in knowing more about her, to do a little more research and read a good book. Since the release of the musical in the 70's and the film version of the musical in the 90's, a lot of literature about Evita or works based on her, have been written.

Another documentary that was released around the same time period (mid 90's) and is recommended (although the photographs and archival footage is of lesser quality than this one) is the Lifetime biography ""Eva Pern: An Intimate Portrait"". Unfortunately it has not been released on DVD but the VHS (remember those?) version can be purchased on Amazon. The musical film Evita is also recommended. Althought the latter should be treated solely as entertainment and not as a history lesson since it is inaccurate in places and a lot falls under the category of ""fantasy.""

In his excellent book PERN AND THE ENIGMAS OF ARGENTINA, Robert Crassweller wrote of her (after Eva dies):

""Thus she passed from the scene, this remarkable woman for whom no counterpart can be discerned. She was at once admitted to legend and, indeed, to sacred legend... Behind her she left an interesting amalgam of grief, guilt, mythology, celebration, and despair as her friends and her enemies sought to adjust to an Argentine world devoid of her central presence. Above all, perhaps, she left a large space and no successor.""

And later on he would write:

...""There would be no second Evita and no pretender to that eminence.""

Love her or hate her, one cannot deny the mark Eva Maria Duarte de Pern left in the pages of Latin American history books. The woman was and is a star and her star still shines, just as it did over 60 years ago when she graced the world stage. This documentary gives you a brief glimpse of her appeal, her influence while bringing to life those turbulent times and passionate place that was Argentina of the 1940's and beyond.",1109635200,9,3748,4.809006211180124

It is such a good video that I bought it from amazon.com yesterday. If you are intersted in learning about Eva Peron then I suggest watching this biography.",1030233600,8,302,4.410714285714286

Showing photos of her in her sexy prime as a young girl in Buenos Aires to her rise as the myth as we know her. Telling her  short life story in a respectable manner. Bravo,Eva!
