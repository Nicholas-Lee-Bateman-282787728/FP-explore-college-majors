8335397,4,B001QDDVM4,"Having been to Barker Ranch a couple of times in the past few years I wanted to see it back in the day when they were living there.  I liked the video, for me it was a must have.  The only reason that I did not give it five stars is because I would have liked more audio from Gypsy and Clem up at the ranch......if you see this movie you will know what I mean.
