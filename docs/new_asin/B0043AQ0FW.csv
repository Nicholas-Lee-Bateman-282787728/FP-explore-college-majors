4254946,4,B0043AQ0FW,"This video could be an excellent tool if given a little more attention to the diction of the lady performing the grooming. At times one cannot decipher what is she saying. At any rate, not a bad investment.",1261353600,,206,4.447368421052632
4254947,4,B0043AQ0FW,"Very good instruction that I have been looking for a long time. I am tired of paying for shoddy work by people who call themselves groomers. Now I have the confidence to do it myself. My only complaint is that sometimes I can not hear/understand what the lady is saying. Also, on the anal glands; vets are telling me that squeezing (expressing) the anal glands is NOT recommended and doing so can actually cause problems. I know there are videos on youtube and you can go to ""lovetoknow dogs: anal glands"" for more info on this.",1370131200,2,528,4.510416666666667
4254948,5,B0043AQ0FW,"I found this DVD very helpful and informative. Everything is explained in detail, which I think is great, for someone who had no idea on how to groom a Maltese. I really liked this DVD and would recommend it to anyone who wishes to learn how to groom a Maltese.",1367539200,2,261,4.24
4254949,2,B0043AQ0FW,"The presenter had a lot of good information, very knowledegable on the subject, but...
The intro music blast you out of the chair but the volumn on the speaker/presenter is so low that some of the information is lost. the clip on microphone keeps gettong feeback from somewhere. many product information should have had more closeups on to see the detail of tool choices.",1361318400,,371,4.8125
4254950,5,B0043AQ0FW,It's the best!  I love this DVD.  The instructor was very thorough.  I can watch this DVD over and over again to do a better job grooming my dog.,1358985600,,145,3.9310344827586206
4254951,3,B0043AQ0FW,"The video is done in order of how you would do a groom on your dog at home, and she starts with tools and supplies which is great.  The two grooming techniques shown allow for a longer coat and a shorter summer type cut.  The only issue I have with the video is that it can spend a little too much time on the same thing like using the clippers on the pads.  Once you see one, maybe two, you've seen it.  No need to show all four being done.  I have used the tools on my own dog and have had better luck since watching the video than before.  It still takes a lot of practice though.",1347926400,5,583,3.8983050847457625
4254952,5,B0043AQ0FW,A great starting guide to grooming your maltese. Easy to navigate and watch better than any book I've found. Would suggest to any first time groomers.,1319328000,3,150,4.8076923076923075
4254953,5,B0043AQ0FW,"The dvd is just what I was looking for. Now I can do the bathing, clipping and all the grooming myself. The dvd has easy to follow instructions and it covers cleaning the ears, clipping the nails, remove anal glands, short cut and clipping the hair with scissors. And more. Everything I need to groom my little maltese boy. The quality is good. I do not understand those people that says it has poor quality. My dvd is fine. Thank you for a nice dvd.",1313798400,4,450,4.305882352941176
4254954,5,B0043AQ0FW,"I am very satisfied with this purchase.  The product description states that is about 2 hours long and will show you two different grooming styles for Maltese, and that is what you get.  The introduction goes over several grooming tools, how to use them and care for them, and is very useful.  The DVD is easy to navigate, with ""scenes"" clearly labeled.  This was a great feature, as I prefer to keep my Maltese cut short, and I was able to quickly skip to the second, ""Summer/Puppy"" groom.  The segment on trimming the hair between the paw pads alone was worth the purchase price.  I have hard floors and I have spent hours painstakingly clipping this hair with scissors - gives me a sore neck and my dogs hate it.  The clipper technique gets it done painlessly, in just a few minutes!  The narrator expresses the anal glands with bare hands, which is a bit unpleasant since the liquid that comes out really smells bad - the technique can be done while holding a paper towel as well, which catches most of the liquid and can be used to wipe the area down.  I also like the fact that the dog struggles a bit in the video, so the narrator can demonstrate methods of calming and restraining the dog during the groom.  I was hoping to see clipper combs used in the video for the puppy groom - instead a longer clipper blade was used, which is more expensive than a set of combs.  However, compared to the expense of professional grooming every 6 weeks, it still saves money to buy the additional blade.  Overall, this video is worth the investment.",1289779200,10,1545,4.459074733096085
4254955,5,B0043AQ0FW,THIS IS THE BEST AND MOST INFORMATIVE VIDEO I HAVE EVER WATCHED FOR GROOMING.  I HAVE HAD OTHERS AND THIS ONE IS ABSOLUTELY HANDS DOWN THE ULTIMATE OF GROOMING INSTRUCTIONS.  IT'S DETAILED EXTREMELY WELL AND TAKES YOU STEP BY STEP THROUGH THE WHOLE PROCESS START TO FINISH.  BY USING THIS VIDEO I HAVE ALREADY SAVED $45.00 FOR EVERY ONE OF MY MALTS THAT I'VE GROOMED.  HAVING THREE MALTS OF MY OWN AND RESCUED FOSTERS TOO I'D SAY I HAVE ALREADY SAVED AT LEAST $200.00 IN THE PAST 2 MONTHS ALONE. LENA TEACHES EVERYTHING YOU'LL NEED TO KNOW TO DO AN EXPERT JOB ON YOUR LITTLE FURBABIES.. WHAT A GREAT AND OUTSTANDING INVESTMENT.,1280275200,3,627,4.571428571428571
4254956,4,B0043AQ0FW,"Wish I had found this video sooner. Great basics and a must have for new Maltese owners, especially if you want to groom your dog yourself.  I've been grooming my own dogs for the past couple of years. I went through a long period of trial and error, not to mention very funny looking dogs.  I believe this video would have given me the extra confidence I needed.",1270425600,7,363,4.323529411764706
8414529,5,B0043AQ0FW,"I was a little hesitant to purchase as I've seen lower-priced videos, but I have to say this is the most thorough of any I have seen. I recommend this to anyone who is a beginner/intermediate groomer and is looking for a very comprehensive instruction.",1504742400,,252,4.622222222222222
8414530,5,B0043AQ0FW,"Great and thorough DVD for the pet Maltese owner.  Very clear explanations and directions, as well as cute doggies :). Unfortunately, for me, my rescue did receive DNA testing (she was completely shaved when we saw her and the vets she had seen assumed she was a Maltese due to her size) and she's a Bichon Poo!",1452556800,,311,4.456140350877193
8414531,5,B0043AQ0FW,"I love this DVD! I highly recommend it for folks that want to groom their dogs from home or if you are like me and just starting out in the grooming field and need a good reference guide! It's very detailed and she shows you how to achieve a teddy bear cut which is a common request with a lot of my clients.
The groomer is very gentle, patient and thorough in her instruction as well as the groom itself.
I plan to purchase more DVDs soon!",1434326400,,440,4.068965517241379
8414532,3,B0043AQ0FW,"Too expensive for what it is. The setting where the recording takes place is too austere and shows lack of professionalism. They invested the littlest possible on the recording but the product was priced as if it were of Disney quality. The cover looks professionally made, the information provided is for the most part okay but the recording-setting is very mediocre including the dress code and appearance of the groomer. Presentation of the product is extremely important. They observed that on the outside, the cover, but they didn't inside.  It needs to be pleasant and attractive to the eye especially if I have to watch it over and over again to learn or be reminded of certain grooming technique.",1416787200,,704,4.915966386554622
8414533,5,B0043AQ0FW,Very helpful for dog owners looking to start grooming their dogs.  I thought it was useful to see her do each part of the dog because holding the legs and positioning the dog is different for each.,1410912000,2,197,4.324324324324325
8414534,5,B0043AQ0FW,"I bought this DVD because my Maltese nearly died at the groomer and they didn't notice anything wrong.  Lena gives complete explanation of the needed tools, and demonstrates a full grooming session.  I took notes so I could order the basics.  The speed was real time.  I have read some descriptions online and this is much better because you can watch her grooming, not imagine what is being described.  I have minimal grooming experience with my cats and a toy poodle years ago.  I feel I can confidently groom my little girl now and she will be safe and not terrorized by the experience.  Thanks, Lena!",1402444800,,604,4.6415094339622645
8414535,4,B0043AQ0FW,The  Maltese Dog Grooming Instructional How To DVD Video and Equipment Guide was very informative for those of us that know nothing at all about grooming. I very much enjoyed it,1396051200,,177,4.709677419354839
8414536,3,B0043AQ0FW,"This video is a simple home-done video and that adds to the appeal.  You see her doing the various grooming elements, she goes slowly, talks about such things as the way to hold the dog for front leg trim vs. back leg, etc. and you feel that you could do that too!

No magical editing, where suddenly the left side has been done.  I believe some have complained about that but I liked it.  I needed the repetition and there are some different techniques needed to do the left vs. right or front vs. back.

She covers some nitty gritty tasks--removing hair from the ears, emptying the anal glands, special grooming for (I have forgotten the term she uses) the private areas.  And, she goes into detail about electric trimmers and the blades needed for each task, with an emphasis on how to trim hair from the paw pads.

What this video lacks: her sweet Maltese does not have long hair.  It looks like a slightly grown out puppy cut. She 'trims' that a bit and then shows you how to do a puppy cut.  My sweetie has long hair and I found I needed a specific demonstration on how to trim her so that her coat looks graceful and flowing;  no desire to take her coat short.",1379462400,3,1167,4.3119266055045875
8414537,4,B0043AQ0FW,I enjoyed this guide. It was thorough and easy to follow. It gave me the confidence to groom my own little guy.,1378166400,3,111,4.090909090909091
8414538,4,B0043AQ0FW,"I liked it very much, I just saw it once and it helped me a lot.
Now I do grooming on my Maltese  and my savings are $65.00 a month.",1376784000,,132,3.4
