2031056,4,B0001W7QEA,"I would agree with the previous reviewer about the quality of this film.  I subtract one star simply because the now-scarce VHS version has an absolutely terrible audio track.  Especially in the scenes in the stoker hold, it's almost impossible to discern what William Bendix is shouting.  Picture quality is somewhat better, but if ever a film cried out for restoration and re-release on DVD it's this one.

It was fun to see Alan Napier of Batman fame put in a brief appearance as the captain of the ship.  And the tragic Dorothy Comingore, whose career was ended by Joe McCarthy, plays a supporting role in one of her few appearances after the release of ""Citizen Kane.""  Her marvelous work opposite Orson Welles in that film led many movie critics to predict a bright future, but she never starred in another film, courtesy of the HUAAC hearings and the vindictive nature of William Randolph Hearst.  Here she offers up a wan, pallid imitation of her former brilliance in ""Kane"" in a part that just isn't written very well.

As the previous reviewer stated, this movie departs radically from the O'Neill play by emphasizing the relationship between Hank (formerly Yank) and Mildred Douglas and omitting the many political concerns which permeated the original, including Yank's abortive attempt to join the organized labor movement.  But because it's more concise and yet still preserves the original theme of frustrated longing for acceptance and affiliation, for me the movie version is even more powerful and timely than the play.

Of course, the main reason to see this film is the final scene between Bendix and Hayworth. The mingled emotions of pride, scorn, guilty longing, sado-masochistic attraction and wry acknowledgment are handled so persuasively and magnificently that I wouldn't hesitate to call this sequence one of the greatest in 40's Hollywood films.  In general, Bendix plays Hank as less gentle giant than incipient sociopath, but whatever he's doing it works.  And Susan Hayward, a truly beautiful and much underrated actress by many, never displayed more range than in this unsympathetic role.

Please, please, TCM or somebody re-release this on DVD!!",1126224000,8,2178,5.101408450704225
2031057,5,B0001W7QEA,"Eugene O'Neill's play is used only as a frame for this production, with even the name of the eponymous lead being changed, and the action brought forward in time into the Second World (U-Boat) War period, wherein are added additional sub-plots, characters and dialogue not even remotely descended from the original. It is notable, therefore, that O'Neill's powerful brand of Expressionism is incorporated within the making of this work, by director Alfred Santell, displaying the strongest creative impulses in his career, by the splendid cinematographer Lucien Andriot, as well as production and art designer James Sullivan, and others. The result is a cultural hybrid, geared partially to please wartime audiences, but marked by the finest performance in the career of William Bendix; a singularly consistent and vicious interpretation by Susan Hayward; and by fine work from always reliable Dorothy Comingore and Roman Bohnen - the few scenes that Bendix and Hayward share are incandescent and directed brilliantly by Santell.",1112745600,5,1029,5.477987421383648
2031068,3,B0001W7QEA,An offbeat movie not what I had expected but not bad,1435708800,,52,3.8181818181818183
2031069,3,B0001W7QEA,"A grimy old tin can of a film,  full of G & G (Gruff and Greek):  A brute of a laborer is insulted by a rich woman and becomes obsessed with revenge.  The spoiled rich girl is played by Hayward, who always struck me as a pretty but unimaginative actress; here she lacks -critically, I think- the charm and viciousness that would have made her character memorable. The other actors are functionally OK but  not much more. What then are the three stars for?  In part, for the grindingly steadfast direction of Santell, the wonderful staging of the furnace room and, most of all, for Bendix's performance.  He is ( as the French might say) a poete maudit: Willful, frightening, fiercely mournful and utterly unique - and uniquely unpleasant.  What a man!  Note:  I haven't read the play, so I wonder if the ending is as slight and upbeat as the one in the film.",1429401600,,858,4.483870967741935

2031075,1,B0001W7QEA,"Last year, I was the sponsor for a literary criticism group and the play The Hairy Ape was on the list. Since I like the students to delve into the literature in a variety of ways, I purchased the film. It is TERRIBLE, veering completely from the script of the play. The only time I enjoyed it was the few minutes that I fell asleep as my students and I sat around the fire watching it.",1328918400,5,386,4.092105263157895

8016766,1,B0001W7QEA,"Alpha Video's presentation of THE HAIRY APE is positively the worst--repeat, the worst--presentation of any movie I've seen in long years of viewing DVDs.

It's too bad because this is a fine film, deserving of  far more respectful presentation.  Instead,we get a  fuzzy, grey-and-white version likely transferred from some 1980's p.d. VHS.  The sound's awful too.

I don't blame Amazon for selling it, but feel strongly that continuing to offer this sorry mess would be an unwarranted disservice to loyal customers.",1465689600,,516,5.308641975308642

In comparison to other projects from Warner Brothers or Universal which really restored their old films....this one is the same crap as it was before on earlier versions. The only excuse i would accept is that they lost the originals for restoring. But if, they shouldn't irritate the customers who look for better versions of old classics. I give 5 stars for Hayward and Bendix and 1 star for the quality. I won't buy anymore DVD's of this fraudulent company!",1447632000,,531,4.846153846153846
