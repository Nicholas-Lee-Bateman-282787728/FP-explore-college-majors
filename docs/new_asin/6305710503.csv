1073021,1,6305710503,"Are you people serious???!!! This PPV sucked sooooo bad it wasn't even funny. OMG!! It was EASILY THE WORST PPV OF 2000!!! I don't know what kind of wrestling fans we have in here!!! Listen to me... a TRUE wrestling fan:
1. Regal vs. Naked Mideon- A mockery to Regal's name, and Mideon's. They both bumbled around the ring ending when Mideon takes his clothes off. * (out of *****)
2. Table Death thing with all the tag teams- you can watch Raw every Monday night and see the same thing. It was just another table match except nobody did anything cool. GMS tried to pull a Jerry Lynn by turning a sunset flip into a powerbomb throught the table but he screwed it up. His legs broke the table first... just sad. ** 3. Acolytes and Lita vs. T&A and Trish- The match didn't even happen... extremely disapointing. (T&A beat up the APA in the back, the T&A cornered Lita following the Hardys' run in to save Lita) 0 stars... this does not deserve to be rated.
4. Hardys vs. Conqustidors- An ok match but the E and C gimmick as the Conquistadors sucked. **
5. Jericho vs. X-Pac in a steel cage- S-T-U-P-I-D. The only highlights are when Jericho powerbombs X-Pac of the top rope and X-Pac is hit in the groin. DISAPPOINTING!!! **
6. Venis and Richards vs. Chyna and Billy Gunn-A sloppy match with no excitement. *
7. HHH vs. Benoit- Pretty good match, but kinda boring... best match of the night. ***
8. SCSA vs. Rikishi- You people are insane. This match was a BIG MISTAKE. It was a stupid 10- minute chair fight that ended stupid. NEVER WATCH THIS MATCH *
9. Rock vs. Angle- Stupid and sluggish... Angle and Rock at their worst. *
I feel for you if you ordered this PPV.. or if you bought it on tape. IT SUCKED!!! Please SAVE YOUR MONEY DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!",995155200,,1750,4.371165644171779
1073022,4,6305710503,"This was one of the top PPV of the year which featured an excellant tag team elimanition table match which had at least 6 or more tables broken, one of them was a big huge screw up which is relly fun to watch.
Then theres the cage match with X-pac and Jericho which was even more amazing then the table match, It had everything, huge drops from the top of the cage, submissions, technical wrestling and tremendous groin pains.
The Comeback match with Rikishi and Austin was excellent untill the end when the police came into play, I thought the match was apost to be that everything was legal, oh well i didn't really want to see somebody get run over by a car.
Overall Great matches that you will want to watch more than once and you get to see why they call the event NO MERCY",989539200,,778,4.263513513513513
1073023,5,6305710503,"Everybody says that this pay per view stunk.  The reason for this is that the Austin Comeback match didn't live up to it's Hype. well, Duh. Nobody could live up to the hype of Stone Cold coming back after almost a year on the shelf. The Dudley'd Table Invational was a great match with lots of action. X-Pac and Y2J in a cage. One of the best cage matches(HHH vs. Mankind/Dude Love  SS 1997 being the best)The Hardy's and ""Los Conquistadors"" had a good match, not as good as the Hardy's and Edge and Chistian, but good non-the-less. Triple H and Chris Benoit put on one of the BEST technical wrestling matches ever. Bret Hart would be proud. The Austin-Rikishi match was still a pretty good match if you look at it.  And, once you get this(you better get this) you will hold a piece of History, As It was the first time that ""Angle the Great"" became the WWF World Champion. Thid video has a bit of everything rolled up in around 3 hours. You have hardcore with tables, high flying with Hardyz-Los Conquistadors, you got the greatest techical action in a long, long time. And to top it off, you have Kurt Angle putting on a great show, pinning the Rock 1-2-3 in the middle of the ring after the Olympic Slam. Here's how I would rate each match match(out of 10)
Table Invitational-- 8.0
X-Pac Vs. Y2J Steel Cage---8.5
Val Venis and Steven Richards Vs. Mr. Ass and Chyna---7.0
Austin Vs. Rikishi No Holds Barred----8.0
William(Don't call me Steven) Regal vs. Naked Mideon---6.0 (9.5 on humor factor)
Los Conquisadors Vs. Hardyz-----8.5
HHH vs Benoit-----10.0
Kurt Angle vs. The Rock----9.0
Overall PPV AVERAGE------8.125
Overall PPV------8.5

1073024,5,6305710503,"No mercy was another in a long line of great ppv's the wwf has released this year. The Dudlye's Table Inventational was a great quick paced opener. Next was a spectacular Cage match between X-Pac and Chris Jericho. Best cage match in a long time. Billy Gunn & Chyna v. Steven Richards & Val Venis was ok, but it was great to see Billy back in his first match since being injured at No Way Out. Next was No Holds Barred between Rikishi and Stone Cold Steve Austin. This was a quick match which was brutal but has a terrible finish. William Regal vs. Mideon was of heat quality and the worst match of the night. The Hardy Boys vs. Los Conquistadors (Edge & Christian) was not one of there best matches together (Look to No Mercy 99 for that one), but still had some great high spots by the suicidal Hardy's. Triple H vs. Chris Benoit was an wonderful match. Triple H just gets better every match he is in and is the hardest worker in the wwf. Benoit is the best wrestler in the world today so naturally  his match really stole the show, just spectacular work by both parties. The Rock v. Kurt Angle was also great, and was one of  the best matches The Rock has been in this year. Overall a great ppv, only a shame it's being underrated by alot of people because of the Ausitn v Rikishi match. I great addation to any wwf fans collection.",973123200,2,1335,4.2727272727272725
1073025,5,6305710503,"I am a very big wrestling fan and have seen every ppv for the last two years and this and wwf summerslam 2000 were the two best.  Here are the matches and how I rated them (1 to ten) and then a comment about about the match.
Dudley tag team table invitational 7/10 - expected alot more but still a great match
Cage match Chris Jericho vs X-pac 8.5/10 - a great match lots of highlits and action
Chyna and Billy Gunn vs Val Venis and Steven Richards  6.5/10  Decent match, not badd nice to see billy gunn back
Los Conquistidors vs Hardy Boyz  7.5/10 a good tag match lots of action
No holds barred Stone Cold vs Rikishi  8/10- expected alot more but lots of hardcore action (10 big chairshots)
No DQ The Rock vs Kurt Angle 9.5/10 - alot more than I expected, just a plain out great match
Chris Beniot vs HHH  9/10  A great match, very technical match

7894901,5,6305710503,"2000 was a pretty good year for WWF in terms of PPV and No Mercy 2000 is a prime example of it. The Albany, New York crowd at the Pepsi Arena was in for a night of No Mercy and new beginnings.

1.) Dudley Boyz Invitational Tables Match: Too Cool vs Lo Down vs Tazz and Raven vs The Dudley Boyz vs RTC

This was similar to a Tag Team Turmoil match only tables were involved. Two teams would start in the ring and could only be eliminated by being put through a table. The last team remaining was the winner. This was a nice appetizer to prepare the crowd for what was to come later as the night went by. The Dudleyz win the match after giving The Goodfather from RTC a 3D through a table
_____________________________

2.) 6 Intergender Tag Team Match: Lita and APA vs T&A and Trish Stratus

This match never happened due to T&A attacking the APA backstage just before they were about to enter. Before Lita can retreat to the back, she's blocked by T&A and Trish who take her back to the ring and prepare to do damage to her. Before any harm is done, The Hardyz make the save. No match, just an attack and a save.

_____________________________

3.) Steel Cage Match: Chris Jericho vs X-Pac

The final match of the Jericho/X-Pac feud would be consisted inside of a 15 foot high Steel Cage. It kind of annoys me how X-Pac still had the same gimmick since DX had ended months before. Still had the same music, still doing the same crotch chops. It became boring, fans became bored of X-Pac, he was no longer charismatic, and was in serious need of a gimmick revamp. I was never an X-Pac fan and his stale gimmick didn't help. Jericho was well into his second year in the company and was perhaps WWF's top mid-carder at this time. Jericho once again makes X-Pac look good throughout the match and Y2J wins the match, climbing over the cage.

_____________________________

A Steve Blackman segment, putting on a show for the fans at The World. Ahh The World. I miss when WWE used to have that little nightclub in New York. Makes me sad that could I never go. Moving on!

_____________________________

A segment with Rikishi confronting Commissioner Foley in his office, which looks to be in his alter ego Mankind's home, the boiler room. Rikishi who had been hogging the doors to the parking lot since Sunday Night Heat with a sledgehammer in hand, demanded to know where Steve Austin was. Foley decides that if Austin doesn't show up soon, he'll announce Rikishi as the winner via forfeit. Foley reminds Rikishi that Stone Cold is always closer than you think and Rikishi simply scoffs and walks off

_____________________________

4.) Val Venis and Steven Richards vs Billy Gunn and Chyna

Boring match. RTC get the win after Eddie Guerrero interferes, hits Chyna with a pipe and Val pins Chyna for the win

_____________________________

5.) No Holds Barred Match: Rikishi vs Stone Cold Steve Austin

- The wait was finally over! The Rattlesnake was back! Stone Cold Steve Austin hadn't competed in a ring since the previous year's No Mercy PPV and was making his in-ring return at this No Mercy. Rikishi had recently started his first heel run in the company after he admitted to being the one who ran over Stone Cold at the 1999 Survivor Series. Just as Foley was about to announce Rikishi as the winner via forfeit, Austin sped into the arena in his truck. This wasn't even a match. This was more of a one sided annihilation. Rikishi gets in one or two shots, but for the most part, Steve Austin beat Rikishi up and down, left and right, and in the crowd. He even busted Rikishi open before dumping him in the back of his truck and driving him outside of the arena. Austin prepared to run Rikishi over with his truck but before he could, suddenly a large swarm of police officers showed up and arrested Stone Cold. For so much hype this was a really disappointing way to end the match. But at least fans got to witness a brutal Stone Cold beat down

_____________________________

6.) European Championship Match: William Regal (c) vs Naked Mideon

Supposed to be nothing more than a comical match. How appropriate for this match to take place right after Austin tried to kill Rikishi in the outside arena. Mideon ends up taking all his clothes off with nothing but a fanny pack on. Regal gets the win with the Regal Cutter

_____________________________

A edited video of Kurt Angle ""interviewing"" The Rock on Sunday Night Heat is shown. A pretty funny video. That's what I liked a lot about Kurt's early years in WWF/WWE. He was a heel who was a goofball and knew how to make you laugh

_____________________________

7.) Tag Team Championship Match: Hardy Boyz (c) vs Los Conquistadors

It didn't take a brain surgeon to know that Edge and Christian were Los Conquistadors. Anyways this was a fast paced action match that ends when Conquistador Dos, uses the Unprettier on Matt for the win and the Tag Team Titles.

_____________________________

8.) Triple H vs Chris Benoit

This match came about after Benoit headbutted Stephanie McMahon a month ago on an episode of Raw Is War. A great technical match from 2 of the WWF's best. Chris Benoit was one of the WWF's most ruthless wrestlers and this was his first time encountering Triple H. These 2 would go on to have several great matches in 2004 for the World Heavyweight Championship. An interference from Stephanie leads to Triple H hitting the Pedigree on Benoit for the win

_____________________________

9.) No Disqualifications WWF Championship Match: Kurt Angle w/Stephanie McMahon vs The Rock (c)

The build up for this match was terrific. Great story telling leading up to and during the match. Kurt Angle had a successful rookie year so far. Earlier in the year, he was the Eurocontinental Champion, had a classic bout with Chris Benoit and Chris Jericho at Wrestlemania, and won the King of the Ring. Now he faced his biggest challenge so far. Fighting The Rock for the WWF Championship. Angle's athleticism and Rock's showmanship made this a great main event match. Stephanie got hurt earlier in the match and was taken to the back by Triple H. Rikishi returned to the arena and interfered in the match towards the end and tried to help The Rock by attacking Kurt Angle on 2 different occasions but failed both times and unintentionally attacked The Rock. Angle followed this through with an Olympic Slam on Rikishi and an Olympic Slam on Rock to get the win and his first WWF Championship! The Angle Era officially began!

_____________________________

Overall: A great great GREAT PPV! Aside from the 1 or 2 pointless or boring matches, this PPV was classic and one of my favorite No Mercy PPVs. Stone Cold returned and The Angle Era began! 5/5 stars from me! Either get this VHS, find the UK DVD, or watch this on the WWE Network!",1393545600,,6807,4.645833333333333

October 22, 2000

Pepsi Arena

Albany, New York

Dudley Boyz Tag Team Table Elimination Invitational:

Dudley Boyz V. Right To Censor V. Tazz & Raven V. Too Cool V. Lo Down

Good opener. Could have been alot better. Yeah, like the Dudleyz are going to lose their own Invitational?  **3/4

Acolytes & Lita V. Tes, Alber, & Trish

This match never happened. Lita just got the hell beat out of her.

Steel Cage Match:

Chris Jericho V. X-Pac

This was the 3rd Cage Match in 4 months. Can you say, ""overusing of a match."" Again, like their Unforgiven match, this one could have stole the show, and again, it didn't. This match was ok until the end. Jericho wins. ***1/4

Billy Gunn & Chyna V. Steven Richards & Val Venis

This match sucked. Right To Censor (Steven & Val) win. **

No Holds Barred Match:

Stone Cold Steve Austin V. Rikishi

This match never ended. The whole match Austin kicks Rikishi's ass and then the cops show up ""just in time"" to safe Rikishi from being ran-over by Austin.

WWF European Championship:

William Regal (Champion) V. Naked Mideon

um...Regal wins and why did Mideon even agree to this gimmack? **

WWF Tag Team Championship:

Hardy Boyz (Champions) V. Los Conquistadores

I wonder who the Conquistadores are. Anyways, this match was great and very action paced. The Conquistadores (Edge & Christian) win the Tag Titles. ****

Triple H V. Chris Benoit

Remember last year when Triple H has never defeated Chris Benoit?...They must have forgotten about this match. This match was great, but the Iron Match Match was their best match that they had together. Yes...Triple H does win. ****

WWF Championship:

The Rock (Champion) V. Kurt Angle

Awesome match. This match had a great story to it and Angle finally wins the WWF Championship! ****1/2

Overall, a pretty good show. The Austin/Rikishi match could have had an ending but didn't. Angle title win was awesome but he should have held it atleast until WrestleMania.",1122508800,5,1964,4.744807121661721

Now if you read my Summerslam 98' review, you know I went into to much detail so I will just give you what you want to hear on a scale from 0 to 10 with ten being the highest.
1. Dudley Boyz Tag Team Elimination Table Invitational Match Too Cool (Scotty 2 Hotty and Grandmaster Sexay) vs. LoDown (D-Lo and Chaz) vs. Taz and Raven vs. The Dudley Boyz (Bubba and D-Von) vs. Right to Censors Goodfather and Bull Buchanan.
(this is the exact order as they come out) The first match lasted for a few minutes with Too Cool beating LoDown by Scotty pushing Chaz into a table from the top rope. Then Taz and Raven suplexed Scotty through a table beating Too Cool. Then the Dudleyz came out and D-Von leg dropped Taz through a table. Then the Right To Censor people came out and Bubba originally  powerbomed Bull through the table but the ref was down. Then the Goodfather came and nailed Bubba with a chair and dragged Bubba into the table and rolled Bull out. The ref said RTC won but then another ref came and then they restarted the match and the Dudleys 3-D the Goodfather.
Winner The Dudleyz Rating: 7/10
Pretty good Table match, but somewhat predictable.
2. 6-Man Inter-gender Tag Team Match T&A and Trish against The Acolytes and Lita.
This match never happened. Lita came out with her hair in a ponytail (which up to this point she has never done) and after a minute they showed T and A beating up the Acolytes. T and A came out and were about to destroy Lita but then Matt and Jeff saved her.
Winner: ??? Rating: 0/10
This would have been good but never happened.
After a stupid joke about nuts from Edge and Christian the next match started.
3. X-Pac vs. Chris Jericho in a Cage Match
This match some high points but never really had any high points (literally) until X-Pac and Jericho were both on the top. Y2J did a Walls of Jericho on the top then X-Pac kicked Y2J off the top onto the ring. Then X-Pac jumped on the door and thought he had won but Y2J kicked the door and X-Pac hit his jewels and Jericho won.
Winner Chris Jericho Rating: 8/10
The match is really 6/10 but X-Pac hit his nuts 3 times and still almost won!!
4. RTC members Val Venis and Steven Richards against Mr. A$$ and Chyna
This match was short and ended with a low blow by Chyna and a Fame-A$$er by Mr. A$$ but before either one could pin Eddie Gurrero came out and hit Chyna with a lead pipe, so RTC won =(
Winner: RTC Pinfall Rating: 5/10
Good Match, bad ending.
5. Stone Cold vs. Rikishi
This match was cruel. Rikishi barely got any shots at Austin as Austin slammed Rikishi into cement, with a chair, and almost through a table before Austin through him into the back of his truck and drove him to the parking lot entrance. Then he kicked Rikishi into stone barriers and attempted to pretty much kill Rikishi by ramming into him at 70 miles per hour. But right before he could hit him a police officer was making his rounds and ended up getting slammed by Austin's truck instead of Rikishi. Then some more officers came and actually arrested him for attempted murder and vehicular assault!!! The officer was almost dead and Rikishi was beat up.
Rating: 9/10
Way intense!!!!!!!!!!!!
The next 2 matches between HHH and Benoit and Rock against Angle were your typical main event never give up matches but both had Stephinie interferring.
Ratings: HHH vs Benoit 8/10 Rock vs. Angle 9/10
Another match is for the Tag Team Championchip
Hardy Boyz vs. Los Quiestadors
You don't need to be a rocket scientist to know this is really Edge and Christian vs. the Hardyz. Pretty good tag team match. Surprise ending with Los Quiestadors winning the titles.
Winner and new Tag Team Champions Edge and Christian (I mean, Los Quiestadors) Rating 6/10
Pretty Good Match!

The other matches I didn't really care for except for the Rock/Angle match which was awesome too.
I normaly review every match but for this I won't.
I thought this and Unforgivin were two great ppvs for 2001...I think that was the year I saw them....
