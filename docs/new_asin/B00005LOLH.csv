1623638,5,B00005LOLH,"NOTE: I UPDATED THIS REVIEW IN 2013

It should be noted that ECW Champion Shane Dougas & Francine did guest commentary along with Joey Styles for this PPV but the DVD did edit out Douglas' opening promo including Francine giving Joey a closeup look at her ""double breasted"" outfit.

Jerry Lynn vs. Justin Credible - This was the finals of their summer series that started out with Lynn staying one step ahead of Justin early on but ended up hurting his own ribs when attempting a top rope dive to which Justin capitalized on by first grounding Lynn followed by a series of offense such as the inverted DDT & using a chair for a running knee & sitout powerbomb while Jason & Nicole Bass got their hits in on the outside as they traded momentum exchanging offense such as a flapjack, sidewalk slam, tiger bomb, top rope frankensteiner while using weapons to make things more impactful such as a DDT on a chair & going through a table.  This was a very athletic fast paced contest between both men as you saw them pullout all the stops here from high flyin' & mat wrestling along with each man knowing each other so much from these series that they had counters for moves you expect from the other wrestlers & some top rope moves that made you go ""Oh My God!""

Lance Storm vs. Chris Candido - Despite making appearances in the past, this was the full-time debut of Tammy Lynn Sytch in ECW while her fiance Candido was wearing headgear to protect his injured ear which just had plastic surgery as both men started out exchanging chops with Storm getting the advantage using his feet for offense such as the spinning heel kick & dropkick to the corner before exposing his ear removing the headgear but Candido went aerial with a top rope crossbody to the floor while Tammy got involved distracting Storm allowing Chris to take advantage with a running tigerbomb & delayed vertical suplex followed by multiple pin attempts causing Tammy to get real loud & verbal after each kick out as they continued to trade momentum with Storm suplexing Candido out of the ring to the outside & knocking him into the front row while Candido also countered Storm's springboard into a powerslam while Tammy once again got involved getting ""physical"" with Lance.  This was a very competitive & athletic match between both men.

Masato Tanaka vs. Mike Awesome - Awesome started out strong with various offense from a springboard position like a back elbow & shoulderblock & splash while showing his crusierweight ability with a over the top rope suicide dive & top rope clothesline while Tanaka brought a strong power game with a snap powerslam & easily shrugging off a release german suplex before things started to dirty with both men having a dueling chairs battle on the floor.  Both men traded momentum & get more physical with each offensive move such as a top rope dive into the front row, various powerbombs including a release that sent someone over the top rope through a table, top rope splash, and unprotected chairshots that indented the chair itself including one coming off the top rope & a tornado DDT onto a pile of chairs.  Anyone who's watched ECW knows exactly what to expect from the matches featuring these two against each other & this was no different.

Tag Team Champions Sabu & Rob Van Dam vs. Hayabusa & Jinsei Shinzaki - With Sabu & RVD being the top tag team in ECW at this time, their challengers for this match came from the FMW promotion in Japan while it should be noted for those who don't already know, Jensei Shinzaki is the wrestler formerly known as Hakushi in the WWE back in the mid 90's. You saw this was going to be competitive right from the early going as both teams tried to stay one step ahead of the other as Sabu stick with a quick hit & move ground attack while focusing on Hayabusa's legs while RVD was mostly focused on using his legs for various kicks & double teaming but unfortunately showed off one too many times allowing Jensei to catch RVD with a dropkick to RVD's back at one point. Things really started to pick up when the match went to the floor as we had one aerial move after another like top rope moonsaults & frankensteiners, a triple jump dive into the crowd, Sabu delivering a chair off the top rope into Jensei's midsection, a 450 top rope splash, and RVD changing direction in mid-air to deliver a splash from the top rope along with later delivering a top rope legdrop that had his entire body land on Jensei's head. Definitely one of the most physical & athletic matches in ECW history.
[ECW Unreleased Vol. 1]

Falls Count Anywhere/Death Match: FTW Champion Taz vs. Bam Bam Bigelow - For those who don't know the story behind the FTW Championship, it was Taz's personal championship he created to spite the company due to not getting a title shot against ECW Champion Shane Douglas despite the fact that Douglas was out with an injury. This was the rematch from Living Dangerously as Douglas was on commentary for this match was Bigelow was a fellow member of the Triple Threat faction. You know the direction this was going when Bigelow powerbombed Taz in the first few seconds only for Taz to get right up & deliever two strong clotheslines before taking Bigelow down with a samoan drop. They fought onto the rampway & through the crowd where chairs & guardrails where used as Taz kept focusing on using submissions. They made their way back to the ring where both men were victims of a table including Taz being busted open before making their way to the ramp again where a strong impact was felt on both men. Both men put in a strong performance here with Douglas only adding to the feel of the match on commentary.
[Bloodsport: ECW's Most Violent Matches; Falls Count Anywhere]

Street Fight Match: Sandman, Tommy Dreamer, Spike Dudley vs. Dudley Boyz - This started off with both teams wrestling & taking some big moves early from D-Von taking a reverse neckbreaker while hanging off the top rope to Spike being tossed & thrown around like a rag doll before the match broke out in an all out brawl on the outside & into the crowd before making it back to the ring where various weapons were being used such as a dive off a ladder in the ring to the outside & later a senton off the ropes onto their opponent laying on the ladder, four way trees of woe dropkicks with chairs, one tossed out of the ring through a table, one guy on the receiving end of a killer chairshot, and a DDT onto a ladder.  This was nothing more than a weapons filled brawl that not only got physical with all six men but anyone else associated with them both during & after the match.

This was just about the perfect PPV that ECW ever put on in their entire history. It was only 6 matches but that gave enough time for each match to be a high quality encounter that could stand on it's own. If your looking for ECW events to collect, this is the top one to get based off quality wrestling alone.",1148688000,,6925,4.5304
1623639,5,B00005LOLH,"This is what wrestling should still be like I miss ECW so much they were without a doubt the perfect mix of in your face hardcore action and pure straight wrestling, with guys ranging from the likes of Sandman or New Jack then seeing someone like Lance Storm or Jerry Lynn, definitely the #1 company in wrestling in my opinion no matter what McMahon or Bischoff says and this is one of my favorite releases from them, I absolutely love the match between Mike Awesome and Masato Tanaka both making names for themselves in FMW in Japan then coming to ECW and had amazing bouts together I love every single match these guys have together I just sit in amazement at their chemistry this along with their match from Anarchy Rulz '99 are amazing worth the price of this DVD alone. You won't be dissapointed in the least bit buying this.",1116374400,,830,4.503311258278146
1623640,5,B00005LOLH,"Best ECW ppv ever?? That's up for you to decide, but if you like hardcore wrestling, look no further than Heatwave '98. Here are my fave matches:

Justin Credible vs. Jerry Lynn - 10/10 - What a way to start a ppv. Classic good guy vs. bad guy. This match had so many changes in momentum, it was ridiculous. Credible has Nicole Bass (yuk!) some other blonde and Jason, the sexiest man in wrestling (what a funny gimmick) in his corner. It went back and forth. The ending was just sick, if I was a wrestler, I would never let anyone do that to me. Watch it to find what the hell i'm talking about.

Chris Candido vs. Lance Storm - 9/10 - This was just solid wrestling, what ECW is known for. It was so easy to hate Storm back then. Candido has his g/f in his corner, she was fun to look at. Technical wrestling here, no gimmicks.

Mike Awesome vs. Masato Tanaka - 10/10 - I have 3 ECW dvd's, and on all 3, their match is always the highlight. I was privileged to see them square off in MLW. There matches are always the same, Tanaka takes some monstrous chair shots to the head, he makes a comeback, someone gets thrown through a table outside the ring, and so forth, but who cares, its so f'n hardcore. Someone should tell these guys this stuff is supposed to be ""fake""

Sabu & RVD vs. Hayabusa & Shinzaki - 10/10 - What's that you say, you wanna see some big spots? Well here's your match. It starts off a little slow but then picks up. The ending is insane I must say. My fave move was the 720 splash (is that right name for it?) by Hayabusa. I hear he's paralyzed now, so here he is in his prime.

Two more matches on the card, but I'm too drunk too review those, but if you like cheese graters to the forehead, then you'll like the the main event. Also Taz vs. Bam Bam Bigelow can be found here. What else needs to be said about Heatwave '98, buy it now dumb@ss.",1113350400,,1866,4.129476584022038

1623642,5,B00005LOLH,"I SAW THIS THE NIGHT IT WAS SHOWN ON PAY-PER-VIEW. IT COSTED $21.95, WHICH WAS WHAT ALL ECW PPVS COSTED. HERE'S MY THOUGHTS ON THIS MESMERIZING PPV;

1. JUSTIN CREDIBLE VS. JERRY LYNN
A GREAT WAY TO KICK OFF THE EVENT. THE TOP ROPE THAT'S INCREDIBLE PILEDRIVER THAT JUSTIN CREDIBLE PUTS JERRY LYNN IN AT THE END OF THE MATCH WAS JUST F'N EXTREME! RATING; 5/5

2. CHRIS CANDIDO VS. LANCE STORM
YOU MAY REMEMBER CHRIS CANDIDO FOR HIS WWE STINT, WHICH HE WRESTLED UNDER THE NAME SKIP. ANYWAY, THIS WAS ANOTHER GOOD MATCH. RATING; 4.5/5

3. MIKE AWESOME VS. MASATO TANAKA
ANOTHER GOOD MATCH. IT'S A SHAME HOW MIKE AWESOME'S CAREER JUST FIZZLED ALMOST THE VERY MOMENT HE ARRIVED IN THE WWE. RATING; 5/5

4. FOR THE ECW TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIPS
CHAMPIONS ROB VAN DAM & SABU VS. JINSEI SHINZAKI & HYABUSA
THE BEST MATCH ON THIS PAY-PER-VIEW. HIGHLIGHT OF THIS MATCH; RVD & SABU, AT THE SAME TIME, LEGDROP JINSEI SHINZAKI & HYABUSA THROUGH A TABLE! YOU JUST GOTTA SEE THIS ONE. UNFORTUNATELY, HYABUSA IS CURRENTLY PARALYZED AND IS UNABLE TO WRESTLE AGAIN. RATING; 5/5

5. DEATH MATCH
TAZ VS. BAM BAM BIGELOW
AN ENTERTAINING MATCH. YOU'LL BE REAL SHOCKED WHEN YOU SEE TAZ AND BAM BAM BIGELOW KNOCK EACH OTHER INTO THE ENTRANCE WAY SO HARD, THAT THEY ACTUALLY TORE A HOLE IN IT AND THEY BOTH WENT UNDERNEATH! RATING; 5/5

6. THE DUDLEY BOYZ VS. TOMMY DREAMER, SPIKE DUDLEY, & THE SANDMAN
THE LOWEST POINT OF THE EVENT. BUT, IT'S STILL NOT BAD ENOUGH TO LOWER THIS PPV'S PERFECT RATING! RATING; 4/5

THIS EVENT STANDS AS A TESTEMENT TO THE GOOD OLD DAYS OF WRESTLING THAT WE'LL NEVER EVER SEE AGAIN. ALL WRESTLING FANS NEED TO GET THIS ONE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!",1091923200,,1647,4.525252525252525
1623643,5,B00005LOLH,"Being a long time fan of Extreme Championship Wrestling, I have to say that this was HANDS DOWN the most exciting ECW Pay-Per-View I had the pleasure of watching. There wasn't one match that I thought was boring ""filler,"" every match had its own history and importance -- and to be honest, either of them could have qualified as ""main event"" status in my opinion.
My absolute favorite matches were:
Mike Awesome VS. Masato Tanaka:
These two have history which dates back to Awesome's days in FMW, wrestling under ""The Gladiator"" name (Better gimmick since Awesome epitomizes the name.) This was the start of many matches between the two afterwards, and the ""awesome"" bump which sees Masato Tanaka powerbomb him OVER the top-rope and out of the ring through a table, demolishing it in the process!
Rob Van Dam & Sabu VS. Hayabusa & Jinsei Shinzaki
This is DEFINITELY my favorite tag-team match of all time. Both teams were constantly trying to show the other up with spectacular double-team maneuvers. Even Van Dam and Sabu constantly out-do eachother and hog for the spotlight! The ending involves Hayabusa and Shinzaki both laying on two tables side by side in the center of the ring and Sabu/Van Dam on opposite ends of the top turnbuckles dropping double leg-drop's in unison to flatten their opponents (and the tables!)
Dudley Boyz VS. Sandman, Dreamer, & Little Spike Dudley
There was an emotional build up leading to this match. The Dudley Boyz had previously delivered Beulah, Dreamer's vallet, ""3D: The Dudley Death Drop"" at a prior event, thus breaking her neck which sent Tommy Dreamer into a tantrum wanting revenge on his crude, foul mouthed aggressors. Boy, is revenge sweet! This was a riot! Near the end when all four members of Dudleyville are hanging upside down on the turnbuckles (Tree-of-Woe position) Sandman, Dreamer, and Little Spike Dudley place chairs next to their faces and of all people the REFEREE decides to lend a hand as everyone baseball slides into the chairs! This was halarious and pretty F'N cool. To top it off, New Jack comes out and adds the icing to the cake with his small arsenal of weapons.
Some people try to pass off ECW as a ""mindless violence"" organization, but I guarantee that it wouldn't have had the following it does without some GREAT wrestling. What many fail to see is that ECW had many of the best PURE wrestling matches you or I had ever seen this side of Japan, where they treat it moreso as a sport and not ""sports entertainment."" WWE's watered down, cliched wrestling matches are 90% not even worth keeping your eyes open for, whereas ECW would have you literally standing, eyes glued to the television in disbelief saying ""I've never seen that in my life!"" ECW was all about originality -- it started the ""hardcore"" trend over here, and despite many weak attempts by feds like XPW to mold themselves after ECW, they could never quite get the knock-off ingredients to work. Many of ECW's wrestlers were extremely innovative in the wrestling department, and we've seen moves and ideas both copied and stolen by the WWE and WCW in their respective time. Speaking of the WWE, it's rather saddening to see former ECW talent being held back, thrown away, or ruined. I wish Vince McMahon and the higher-ups would wake up and market these guys correctly.. Can't you still hear those ""ECW"" chants for guys like Tommy Dreamer on Monday Night Raw?",1071446400,,3398,4.800341296928328
1623644,4,B00005LOLH,"I'm sure I'm not the only one who watched this tape as the first exposure to ECW.  Before I watched this show I was convinced ECW was pointless, unecessary violent garbage wrestling.  This tape was an absolute eye-opener back in the day when ECW was the most influential and innovative wrestling promotion anywhere.  And although the production quality may not be first rate it still rates highly today because of the great in ring action.
There are plenty of other reviews on this page giving a run down of the great matches on this show so I won't got through them all.  I guess now watching this tape five years after the event it just goes to show how badly talented guys like Mike Awesome and Jerry Lynn where mistreated during there time in the big two.  This show has everything, if you haven't checked out you owe it to yourself to watch  this tape.",1060905600,,857,4.496774193548387
1623645,4,B00005LOLH,"A lot of reviewers have missed out on a few things that should be told to anyone thinking of purchasing this tape.
As an ECW fan, this was one of their best shows ever. I have seen every ECW pay-per-view, except for a few. This is not the official pay-per-view version and a few things have been cut, due to copyright problems and other reasons.
Make no mistake, every match on here was classic and if I was ever going to show a non-ECW fan an event in hopes of getting them to enjoy, this would more than likely be in the top 5. However, I was slightly dissapointed by the fact that a number of things were cut included a pretty good entrance by Taz.",1059350400,,651,4.174603174603175
1623646,5,B00005LOLH,"This is the absolute best wrestling show of all time... not just for ECW, but for anybody!  I saw this show live on PPV back when. At the time I had never seen anything so awesome... and I've yet to see an event so great since.  This was the first ECW show I ever saw, and after watching Heat Wave '98, I had to see EVERYTHING to come.
To put it blunt... the greatest show of all time put on by the greatest promotion of all time with some of the greatest matches of all time.
Awesome Vs. Tanaka is the best singles match I have ever seen, and RVD/Sabu Vs. Hayabusa/Shinzaki is dito for a tag match.
I can't comment on the DVD's quality because I have the original ECW white box VHS edition I bought as soon as it came out, but I'm sure it's great and I plan on buying it soon.",1057968000,,777,4.006451612903226
1623647,5,B00005LOLH,"The was by far my favorite ECW Tape. Unlike other tapes there were no ""filler"" matches. All carried a purpose and all were done pardon the expression EXREMELY, well. Justin Credible w/ Chastidy,Nicole Bass and Jason def. Jerry Lynn. Cool match. Chris Candido w/ Tammy AKA Sunny def. Lance Storm. great wrestling. Masato Tanaka def. Mike Awesome one of their best. Rob Van Dam and Sabu w/ Bill Alfonso def. Hayabusa and Jinsei ""HAKUSHI"" Shinzaki ECW Tag team title match. Oh my God, words cannot describe the action and the diversity of moves utilized. six man dudlyville street fight. Tommy Dreamer, the Sandman and Little Spike Dudley def. D-Von, Buh-Buh Ray and Big Dick w/ Sign Guy, Joel Gertner and Jeff Jones. This match came about when D-Von and Buh-Buh Ray Dudley gave Beaulla the 3D(Dudley Death Drop) breaking her neck and putting her out of wrestling forever. They also sent the Sandman to the hospital and Spike is fed up with his brother's abuse. Alot of scores to be settled here. Taz faces the ""Beast from the East"" Bam Bam Bigelow in an ECW Death Match AKA Falls count Anywhere with Taz's FTW(F*** The World) title on the line. An amazing tape from start to finish this truely is the Best of ECW.
There are also backstage segments with Rob Van Dam,Sabu and Bill Alfonso. RVD says they will defend ""his"" world tag team belts against Japan's best tag team. RVD :""And after tonight RVD's record will be six and 0."" The other interview segment is with the Dudleyz it is ok in my opinion the worst part of the PPV wich means it is not bad.",1047600000,,1549,4.575539568345324

1623649,5,B00005LOLH,"ECW performed one of there most hot wired performances of there short history. All matches were done with 100% effort, if you are a WWE fan you would find this hard to believe considering the WWE PPV's, but welcome to ECW where all wrestlers poor there guts out for there fans no matter how bad they are injured these guys will give top performances.
THE SUMMER SERIES FINALS!
JUSTIN CREDIBLE  vs  JERRY LYNN
Unbelievable opener, if you know these guys from the WWE, you don't really know them. This is a back and forth scientific wrestling war with a nice table spot and a great ending. I really enjoyed this match.
FORMER PARTNERS COLLIDE!
CHRIS CANDIDO vs LANCE STORM
Very nice match up between these two. Fans of Lance Storm will enjoy this, although he has had better matches, these two worked very well with each other which ends with a powerbomb from the top rope to the other side of the ring.
INTERNATIONAL WARFARE!
MIKE AWESOME vs MASATO TANAKA
Extremely hard hitting matches you would expect from these two. Alot of chairs, high flying moves and a table makes this a very in your face confrontation. No rest periods taking in this match just back and forth fast paced power move after power move battle which ends with a very extreme table break which Awesome landed to the concrete on the back of his neck and somehow finsihed the match. Most defanatly one of the nights HOTTEST.
ECW WORLD TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP!
SABU & ROB VAN DAM vs HAYABUSA & JINSEI SHINZAKI
WOW what a match, alot of effort poured into this hard fought match. A slow start but do give it time as it will turn into a classic back and forth, martial arts war. The japanese guys are very good in this match and really shine more than RVD and Sabu. The match also features another AWE inspiring finisher. This would have to be one ECW's finest tag matches and if there is another one like it i do really want to see it. Some say this is the best match on the card and i cant really argue with that. MUST SEE MATCH
FTW DEATH MATCH!
TAZ vs BAM BAM BIGALOW
If you are a fan of out of control brawls you will love this. Im not a fan of brawls so to me this wasn't the best match but the scorching hot ending is worth the wait.
DUDLEYVILLE STREET FIGHT!
TOMMY DREAMER, THE SANDMAN & SPIKE DUDLY vs THE DUDLY BOYZ
The name of the match says it all. They start off with some wrestling but doesnt take long till all participants spread out to ring side and ladders and chairs come in to use. Some say this was very dissapointing, i can see why as when the brawling started to get really interesting and fast it all of a sudden just ends. But for some reason i put this dvd on just to watch this match, probably because it is a fun bumb fest match. If there are more matches like this i want to know what they are.
New Jack also makes an appearance and makes work of the Dudlyz and jack victory with all sorts of weapons with a great picture of the champs.
OVERALL
Im going to say it straight out, this is a must have dvd whether you are a fan of hardcore, high flying, techniqle or scientific wrestling it is all here on one HOT disc.",1023926400,,3105,4.287904599659284

1623651,5,B00005LOLH,"Paul Heyman pulled all the stops when in 1998, he brought a Heat Wave to Dayton, Ohio, and took ""Extreme"" to new extremes! Joined by gutter-mouth announcer Joey Styles and aggravated World Heavyweight Champ Shane Douglas, you will see why this DVD beats anything you have seen from Vinnie Mac's company.
1. Jerry Lynn vs. Justin Credible- If you ever saw these two men only on the WWF, you will be very surprised. Reverse slams, power bombs and lots of hurrincanranas abound as both men fight off in the supposed final chapter of their rivalry. Lynn does a hurrincanrana that sends Credible diving through a table outside the ring. But Credible fights back, and with the aid of his cronies, lands a piledriver on Lynn from the top rope to get this show cooking! ****1/2
2. Lance Storm vs. Chris Candido- Former friends collide in the weakest but also safest match of the night. Don't let that drop your confidence, because they still do some extreme work. A huge chop fest and a superplex out of the ring are this match's highlights. Whoops, how can I forget the moment with Tammy Lynn Stych and the powder, or Candido's huge power bomb off the top rope?! ****
3. Masato Tanaka vs. Mike Awesome- DANGAN! This is the bestest best battle I've ever seen between these two titans. This can't be just a hardcore match; it's a strategic hardcore confrontation where aerial flight, steel chairs and a table all come into play at the hands of both these men. You'll scream ""Holy S."" when Awesome leaps over the ropes to land on Tanaka, and this senor's almost 300 pounds! But that's not all. Awesome lands 4 steel chair shots that almost breaks the seat of the chair onto Tanaka's head, and Tanaka still kicks out! However, you'll love Tanaka even more when he dashes 70 feet to cave in a chair on Awesome's head (""Mike Awesome went down like a giant redwood tree!""), throws Awesome OVER the rope through a table outside (THE BEST TABLE BUMP EVER), and lands a tornado DDT through two stacked chairs to get the win. This match especially had the crowd going wild at the end, and it shocked Styles and Douglas from head to toe. Check it out! *****+++
4. Sabu and Rob Van Dam vs. Hayabusa and Jinsei Shinzaki- If you love airborne warfare, you got it when two wrestlers each from two different companies (ECW & FMW) square each other off for the ECW Tag Titles! Undoubtly, Hayabusa and Shinzaki fly off the rings and injure Sabu and Rob with plenty of strikes to the face and chests. But the extreme tag team rocket themselves with full power, trapping each of their opponents to nightmarish double teams and terrific head-busting chair shots. They also gain the final advantage as Hayabusa and Shinzaki are simultaneously drop-kicked through a single table by Sabu and the Whole Effin' Show! What a match, but it loses points only for two mistakes in the match (Missed chair catch and broken table leg). ****1/2
5. Taz vs. Bam Bam Bigelow- This is a wild, fast-paced brawl with the goliath Beast From the East trying to tear apart Taz before the suplexing machine can have a title shot against none other than Douglas himself! Spills outside of the ring, but once the match gets back inside, BBB then smashes Taz through a table. Taz fights back, and gives Bigelow his own medicine, suplexing the giant onto that same table! Back out of the ring, Taz tornado DDTs BBB through the ramp floor, causing both to fall inside! (""They killed each other!"") But just as it seems only Bigelow had the strength to get back up from the fall, out pops Taz as he finishes off Bigelow with a Taz-mission, and forces Douglas to accept that his days as a champ are about to be numbered! ****1/2
6. Dudleyz vs. Tommy Dreamer, Sandman, and Spike Dudley- The final match has got nothing on technical skill, but this brawl will have you laughing at the insanity of it all. Several chairs, a ladder (they could've used all three), and a table all are demolished in this insane feud for vengeance for Beulah's (Dreamer's girlfriend) injury! The story is one worth telling, as the Dudleyz obnoxious buddies, including fatty boy Joel Gertner, taste the wrath of the odd trio from chair shots to piledrivers! The match ends rather abruptly with a ddt on Bubba-Ray Dudley by Tommy Dreamer through a ladder, but just as it seems to be done, in comes Jack Victory to help out the Dudleyz. But wait! Out comes New Jack to deliver some comeuppance to Victory and the Dudleyz! New Jack throws a few garbage weapons for Dreamer, Sandman and Spike to fulfill the revenge and get those losers out of there. Oh, and did I forget to mention that Jack Victory gets planted on the head by a brutal guitar shot?!Tommy Dreamer was perfectly right at the end, when he said, ""It's safe to say...that Dayton, Ohio...is EXTREME COUNTRY!""
****
So if you love hardcore battles, if you enjoy table spots in almost every match, and if you think ECW was not the greatest company in U.S. wrestling, grab this dvd now and see what you've been missing. No amount of fans could possibly cool you off after this one.",1018310400,,5052,4.608213096559378
1623652,5,B00005LOLH,"Heatwave '98 was a gold mine. It showed what ECW was all about, hardcore and barely legal wrestling. This DVD has it all, and you can`t even compare ""Extreme Evolution"" or ""Deep Impact"" to this showing. Every match kept you on your feet right from the start.
1. Jerry Lynn vs Justin Credible. This was a great match and proved the WWF wrong, on how they use both of these competitors. They both had a strong showing. (4.5/5 Stars)
2. Chris Candido vs Lance Storm. This proved me wrong on how good Candino is, because I saw him when he was in the WWF and WCW and he sucked ass. Now it shows why he is ""Mister No Gimmicks Needed""! Lance Storm was also very impressive. (4/5 Stars)
3. Mike Awesome vs Masato Tanaka. This match was AWESOME. This is one of those matches that you just to pop in and watch anytime you want. Personally I thought the match with Awesome vs. Tanaka on ""Extreme Evolution"" was better, but this one was very good too. (4.5/5 Stars)
4. RVD/Sabu vs Hayabusa/Shinzaki. This was the show stealer, and it wasn`t really RVD or Sabu that made this match an instant classic it was Shinzaki (Formally Known as Hakushi, WWF), and Hayabusa!

1623653,5,B00005LOLH,"I gog this DVD a couple of months ago...and have now decided to write a review for one of ECW's BEST PPV's in history!!! Let's get a rundown of some of the fine matches:
Match 1: Justin Credible vs. Jerry Lynn-What an awesome match! These two waged war to end their feud in the Summer Series Finale. Great table work by Jerry Lynn (hurricanranna off the top rope outside through a table!) Also, a great and brutal ending! ****1/2 (out of 5)
Match 2: Chris Candido vs. Lance Storm-Also a great matc with good technical contest at some points-but at some points an all-out brawl. Good entertainment. ****
Match 3: Mike Awesome vs. Masato Tanaka-Oh My God. What a match. Tanaka with his chairs, and Awesome with the tables (even though that backfired on him bad!) makes this a must-see match. Great action...not a boring moment!! ****1/2
Match 4: Sabu and RVD vs. Hayabusa and Shinzaki-Another classic. I couldn't believe what these guys did to each other. This match is so hot you're gonna want to hose yourself down afterwards. *****
Match 5: Taz vs. Bam Bam Bigelow-A huge brawl that spanned the arena until it ended up right back in the ring where they use a table and some chairs...and then...then ending! Taz putting BBB through the ring was nothing compared to what he puts him through this time! A good quote just after the ""ending"" happened: ""They are dead...oh my God!""-Shane Douglas. *****
Match 6: Dudley Boyz vs. Dreamer, Sandman, and Spike Dudley-Well...this sums it up...the last match on the dvd. Not even the best...but the most HARDCORE. Spike flies off about 20 feet in the air...4-way- sliding-kick-chair-in-the-face. Dudleys pissing the crowd off, chairs, tables, and canes. What a match!
X-Tra Stuff:
1. Footage of New Jack being attacked by Dudleys and Jack Victory in the parking lot. REALLY cool.
2. RVD/Sabu/Bill Alfonso Promo-Hilarious
3. Taz Promo
4. Dudley Boyz promo
And...an appearence of New Jack at the end of the last match...really cool!
Overall...a great PPV. One of the best ever. Go ahead and buy it! *****",1007596800,,2041,4.8342857142857145
1623654,5,B00005LOLH,"You must get this DVD.  The matches and highlights of this pay-per-view are amazing.  All the matches are top-notched and purely incredible.  Soo much hardcore matches that will leave you breathless.  You may think, just because it is a pay-per-view there are bound to be some boring matches, but trust me, there aren't.  Each match is special.  It is not like the WWF where they may be some amazing matches and then there are some other matches that just leave you bored oout of your mind.  Trust me, this is the greatest event that was on television.
Justin Credible and Jerry Lynn  is a great opening match wiith an incredible ending.
Candido and Lance Storm is another match with all around great wrestling and an amazing finisher.
Dudleyville- Street fight was hardcore.  All men get bloodied and New Jack and Victory get it on
RVD and Sabue Vs. Haybussa and Shinseki  Amazing high-flying match with enough high spots to make you sick.
Taz Vs. Bigelow  Much better match than at Living Dangerlously.  The brawling is soo much fun you don't get bored of it.  A bigger drop than at Living D. in the match.
Masato Tanaka Vs. Mike Awesome  One spot that tells us  why Mike Awesome is sooooo under-utilized.  Great chair shots.  More mat wrestling and aerial moves and less chairs and table in this match than at November to REmember 99.  But onw table shot will leave you breathless.
In the DVd are the promos and written down biographies.  The promos are no the best but acceptionally very goo.  This is the greates",1002672000,,1517,4.652830188679245
1623655,5,B00005LOLH,"WOW. I never thought ECW would top Barely Legal, but they sure proved me wrong. Jerry Lynn vs. Justin Credible is a great match with a SWEEET ending. Chris Candido vs. Lance Storm is a good technical match, with another GREAT look at the Blonde Bombshell(Pun intended..)Mike Awesome vs. Masato Tanaka, one of the most hard hitting matches ive ever seen. The chair shots are so BRUTAL, and the crowd totally gets into the match. Once again, a great ending. Sabu/RVD vs. Hayabusa + Jinsei Shinzaki is definitely a highlight reel with an AWESOME ending. Taz vs. Bam Bam Bigelow definitely beat the crap out of each other, and this match was SO much better than their match at Living Dangerously. Another GREAT ending. Hey, all the matches have great endings so far! Dreamer, Sandman, + Spike vs. Buh Buh, D-Von, + Big Dick Dudley was a great brawl with chairs and ladders. Sadly enough, the ending wasn't AWESOME, so there goes the streak, but its not horrible. New Jack comes in after the match and has his garbage cans, so you can predict what happens after that. All in all, definitely ECWS BEST ppv EVER.",1000080000,,1105,4.642857142857143
1623656,4,B00005LOLH,"I saw Heatwave '98 at Suncoast Video and decided to buy it. I've been interested in ECW since the Invasion started. Regretfully, I only watched Hardcore TV once in a great while, so I was never properly introduced to the world of EXTREME. Anyway, on to the review of my first ever ECW ppv:
Jerry Lynn VS. Justin Credible
Great choice for an opener here. Credible and Lynn looked most impressive working together here. The highlights: Lynn's Top rope Frankensteiner to Credible through a table on the outside; Credible's tope rope Tombstone; and Lynn's lowblow to Nicole Bass (that was HILARIOUS!). Exciting match that got the fans fired up. ***
Storm VS. Candido
Why hasn't the WWF signed Candido? Anyway, long story short, both guys are AWESOME. Great hybrid of aerial manuevers, psychology, and stiff shots. The ending was particularly memorable for Sunny getting her top ripped off and Candido delivering a top rope release powerbomb to Storm! ***1/2
Awesome VS. Tanaka
No backstory here needed, although there is one: these two have been fueding all over Japan with Awesome dominating nearly every match. Will the outcome be different in Dayton? Brutal match, highlighted by a Tanaka bomb delivered to Awesome through a table on the outside...ooh, someone read Awesome his last rites. ***3/4
RVD/Sabu VS. Shinzaki/Hayabusa
Oh, c'mon do you really need a recap? The action is really too fast and furious to thoroughly document here. Everyone in this matchup is well suited for this type of acrobatic, suicidal affair. RVD was as impressive as ever. My new favorite wrestler...****1/4 After watching this match, it is abundantly clear how much the WWF copied ECW's format for tag team brawls.
Taz VS. Bam Bam
These guys REALLY hate each other and that mood is conveyed beautifully in this match. I never realized how strong Taz was, but after watching this, I'm a believer. Great stuff here. ***3/4
Spike/Dreamer/Sandman VS. Bubba Ray/D-Von/Big Dick Dudley
Dreamer hates the Dudleys because they broke Buela's neck with the 3D. As someone else said, this match was the original TLC match with very innovative spots, especially for back then. The ending is super-hot and leaves one with a VERY good impression...****
Analysis: THIS was an excellent ppv. All five matches were excellent with the highpoint being the Tag team title match. Watching this event makes me REALLY upset that I didn't watch ECW when it was on television. I have to get the other five videos in the series now. Also, I hope that they release more ""best of ECW"" videos, because darn it, I want MORE! ECW! ECW! ECW!",999388800,,2588,4.951724137931034
1623657,4,B00005LOLH,"For all of you WWF fans who are only now getting your first glimpse at ECW and their superstars, this is for you: you absolutely, positively have got to watch the old school ECW, before Paul Heyman came to work for the WWF. Sabu & Rob Van Dam take on Hayabusa and Jinsei Shinzaki (Hakushi from the WWF in the mid 90's) in one of the greatest ECW tag team matches of all time. ""The Human Suplex Machine"" Taz takes on ""The Beast From The East"" Bam Bam Bigelow in a match with a contraversial ending. One of the hardest hitting wrestlers from Japan, Masato Tanaka takes on Mike Awesome in a match that occured two years before they would battle for the ECW World Heavyweight Title. Former ECW tag team champions Chris Candido and Lance Storm go at it, plus many more! Commentated by Joey Styles and ECW Heavyweight Champion of the time, Shane Douglas. For those of you new to ECW, this will serve as a good introduction into the world of extreme. To all ECW fans, you already know exactly what I'm talking about! ECW will live on forever, thanks to these DVD's!",998697600,,1058,4.403061224489796
1623658,5,B00005LOLH,"With the resurgence of ECW in the public eye on WWF television, more casual wrestling fans may find an interest in learning about the revolutionary promotion that changed the face of sports entertainment in the mid to late `90s.  Touted by many (with GOOD reason) as ECW's best Pay-Per-View, Heatwave '98 featured 6 GREAT matches.  This DVD recounts all 6 matches, plus all the promos and backstage antics from the Pay-Per-View (aired August 2, 1998 from the Hara Arena in Dayton, Ohio).  Included on the DVD are the match histories detailing the feuds and situations at the time written by Michael Johnson II of 1wrestling.com, the same guy who wrote the wrestler bios for the other ECW DVDs and the ECW website.  Johnson's match history write-ups provide nice background and sets the tone nicely for the matches.  I recommend reading his write-ups BEFORE watching the matches.
Here are the matches and line-up for the program:
Heatwave `98
Your commentators are Joey Styles and ""The Franchise"" Shane Douglas (w/ Francine)
1. Justin Credible (w/ Jason, Nicole Bass and Chastity) vs. Jerry Lynn:  Summer Series Finale.  This was the cap off match to the big feud these two had during the summer of '98.  Solid wrestling match between these two with several high spots, great technical wrestling and all participants getting involved.  The brutal finish to the match is one for the highlight reel.  4  stars.
2. Lance Storm vs. Chris Candido (w/ Tammy Lynn Sytch):  Grudge Match Between Former Partners.  This match was also a cap off to a feud between both men.  Again, this is another solid match between two great workers with great technical wrestling and solid aerial spots.  Like the previous match, the ending is also one for the highlight reel.  4  stars.
3. New Jack promo with the fans outside the arena, featuring appearances by the Dudleys, Balls Mahoney and Axl Rotten.
4. Rob Van Dam, Sabu and Fonzie Promo
5. Masato Tanaka vs. Mike Awesome:  AWESOME match between these two as always.  This is another GREAT match in the loooong history in the continent spanning war between these two gladiators.  Lots of power moves, lots of aerial moves, tables and chairs mark this match.  In another moment for the highlight reel, there is this one TOTALLY KILLER spot (emphasis on KILLER) that the crowd and even the announcers cringed at. 4  stars.
6. Taz promo
7. Dudleys promo
8. RVD and Sabu (w/ Fonzie) vs. Hayabusa and Jinsei Shinzaki:  ECW Tag Title Match.  Shinzaki may be better known to American fans as Hakushi from the mid-90s WWF.  AWESOME match.  It's aerial and martial arts warfare from 4 of the best workers in the world.  Hands down, to me this was THE best match of the night and realistically, one of the best matches I've ever seen!!!  Jaw dropping back and forth war with TONS of high spots, TON of martial arts, tables and chairs in this one.  The match was a virtual highlight reel!!!  5 stars.
9. Highlights Package featuring Taz' war with the Triple Threat.
10. Taz vs. Bam Bam Bigelow:  FTW Championship Match.  Falls Count Anywhere Death Match.  Hard-hitting, intense and BRUTAL brawl across the arena, notable for yet another jaw dropping, unbelievable moment.  It was a battle so intense, not even the ground could hold it... 4  stars for the match, 5 stars for the finish!!!
11. The Dudleys (Buh Buh Ray, D'Von and Big Dick, w/ Jeff Jones, Joel Gertner and Sign Guy) vs. The Sandman, ""The Innovator of Violence"" Tommy Dreamer and Spike Dudley:  Dudleyville Street Fight.  This is a big pay-off match to the intertwined feuds all three faces had with the Dudleys. Fun match complete with the classic Dudley and Sandman ring intros.  Classical ECW arena-spanning brawl featuring tables, ladders, chairs, canes, etc... ECW at its best.  4  stars for the match.  5 stars for the Intro
Overall, this Pay-Per-View has been noted as ECW's best for good reason.  All 6 matches on this card were just top notch.  The two opening matches were solid scientific classics, Tanaka and Awesome was a WAR (plus that INSANE bump), the Tag Match was just AWE INSPIRING and the two top matches featured the hard-hitting, hardcore style that made ECW famous.
Though the card may look small (with only six matches) and the run time on the DVD may be just a little over two hours (with NO special features other than the match histories), Heatwave '98 proves the old adage about ""quality"" vs. ""quantity.""  ECW became famous for giving its fans their monies worth in action.  Heatwave '98, with six of the best matches you'll see on a wrestling card, does just that.
Highly Recommended",997660800,,4596,4.8061224489795915
1623659,5,B00005LOLH,"Get out a cold glass of water because after watching one of the hottest ECW Pay Per Views your going to want to soak yourself.
On August 2nd 1998, there was one of the biggest wars that ever took place, There where 6 outstanding matches that at the end of every match you will see yourself yelling ECW ECW ECW ECW.Here is a rundown of all the matches with a rating of 10 being the highest.
Justin Credible vs. Jerry Lynn
I belive that this was there last match that they had against each other and oh man they didn't go down soft. This match has some very high spots, at one point Jerry Lyn gave Justin Creadible a hurricarana to the outside and threw a table!!! but Justin Creadible gives the crowd a huge surprise and didn't stay down. This match ends with Justin Creadibles finisher (Thats Increadible) off the top rope!!!, Jerry Lyn lands right on his head and looks like he his dead. 8/10
Lance storm vs. Chris Candido
This is another grudge match of former tag team partners Collideing. Both Storm and Candino hit some amazing top rope moves but it is Storm who takes a huge beating, Storm falls victim to one of the most devasting Powerbombs ever. 7.5/10
Tag Team Champions Sabu and Rob Van Dam vs. Shinzaki and Hayabusa
This match is AMAZING! If you like high flying matches well this is the best. I think I counted 15 jumps off the ropes and almost all of them where perfectly executed. All of the great top rope moves are here like the 450 splash, Asia Moonsault, Swantom Bomb and even a pair of dueling leg drops threw a table. Increadible Match 9/10
Mike Awesome vs. Masato Tanaka
Heres a question, when have these two men ever been in a match that sucked. Anwser.....NEVER, Once again in this match they pull off so many power spots like a dive into the crowd and a devasting Awesome Bomb or shall I call it the Tanaka Bomb to the outside threw a table. Tanaka actully wins the match with a tornado DDT on two steel chairs. 8.5/10
FTW champion Taz vs. Bam Bam Bigelow
This is just like there match at living dangerously, the diffrence.. Its better. This has so many cool spots like a firemens carry on the concreat, an irsh whip threw a table that was planted in the corner and Taz even used the remains of the table to T-Bone Tazplex Bam Bam threw. Now just like living dangerously they go out and destroy the arena. Literally!! this time its not the ring it the entire RAMP!!!!(no joke) Great match 8.5/10
The Sandman, Spike Dudley, and Tommy Dreamer vs. Big Dick, D-Von, and Buh Buh Ray Dudley in a streetfight.
This main event is AWESOME and ECW at its best. The spots in this match where very impressive, Spike makes a leap off the top of a ladder in the ring to the outside! The ending of the match is a little disapointing where tommy DDTed Buh Buh Ray on a ladder and pinned him for the win. This match is great. After the match is over Jack victory comes in the ring and hits dreamer over the head with a guitar so to even out the score comes New Jack with tons of weapons. The show ended with New Jack, Tommy Dreamer and Sandman on 3 seperate ladders with little Spike running around them, what a match, WHAT A SHOW. 9.5/10
Overall this is one of top or even maybe the best PPV that ECW has ever had.
If you do not buy this DVD when it comes out you will be sorry because you will be missing one of the greatest PPV from one of the greatest promotions ECW.",994723200,,3379,4.297805642633229

But when you ask me whats my favorite for some reason ECW Heatwave 98 stands out to me, for a guy who seen all of ECW's ppv live when they happended this is one of my favorite. But the dvd really disapointed me, they totally skip the pre-show with Shane Douglas, The Head Cheerleader Francine, and Joey Styles, which to me set the tempo to the ppv.

Justin Credible vs Jerry Lynn. These two had series of matches throughout the summer & each time delivered with great action. Another great match between these two as I felt these two were heavily underrated in the ring. Nice way to start the show.

Chris Candido vs Lance Storm. The old former partners turned enemies highlight this grudge match as both men meshed well to put on a great wrestling match with the highlight being Tammy Lynn Sytch(WWF's Sunny) having a wardrobe malfunction in the end.

Mike Awesome vs Masato Tanaka. What else more can be said from an Awesome/Tanaka encounter that has not been said already. Hardcore warfare with high-flying, power moves, sick chair shots & table spots that result in another match that does not disappoint.

ECW Tag Team Champions Rob Van Dam & Sabu vs Hayabusa & Jinsei Shinzaki. For those that don't know, Shinzaki is actually WWF's Hakushi. This was my favorite match of the night as this redefined tag team action. Words don't do it justice as this match has it all including, mat-wrestling, high-flying, fast-paced tag team action, tables & chairs along with the usual cameos from Bill Alfonso. The real highlight is RVD/Sabu's finishing maneuver with stereo leg drops through a table on both men. Awesome match & one of the best tag team matches in ECW history.

FTW Death Match: FTW Champion Taz vs Bam Bam Bigelow. Again for those fans that may not know, TW means ""The World"" while I think everyone knows what the F means. This is the rematch from Living Dangerously where both men went through the ring & these two picked up right where they left off. Taz held his own here & we all know what Bigelow is capable of but the highlight would be the infamous ""ramp"" sequence with Shane Douglas providing hilarious commentary after seeing it.

Dudleyville Street Fight: Tommy Dreamer, The Sandman & Spike Dudley vs Bubba Ray, D-Von & Big Dick Dudley. The rules are..there are no rules. Hardcore brawl with all men going at it around the arena, through the crowd, using various weapons like ladders, chairs, stop signs, tables (you know that was coming) & etc. Bloodbath with cameo appearances from Sign Guy Dudley, Jeff Jones, Joel Gertner, Jack Victory & New Jack.

In the end, even though Barely Legal '97 was the most emotional event in ECW history, this was the best event in ECW history & worth of being it's ""WrestleMania"". There are only six matches but each match is worth the price so I highly recommend.",1236816000,,2744,4.680497925311204

Justin Credible VS Jerry Lynn: The thing that ECW had in its short time was rivalries. They did them better then WCW and WWF at the time, alot of rivalries are on display on this set. Good match.

Lance Storm VS Chris Candido: Anther feud, anther great match. ECW was on its game during this PPV.

Masato Tanaka VS Mike Awesome: One of the greatest feuds in all of time  wrestling. These men never had a bad match between'em. Enough said.

RVD and Sabu VS Hayabusa and Jinsei Shinzaki: The reason why I bought this dvd. One of the greatest tag team matches ive ever seen in my almost twenty years of watching wrestling. Friggin awesome with no weak spots-worth the money. Hayabusa wrestling is a treat in itself. The only match on the PPV that isn't a feud.

Taz VS Bam Bam Bigelow: This is beter then there first encounter.

The Dudleys VS The Sandman, Tommy Dreamer, and Spike Dudley: This was the only weak match-the main event at that. The whole PPV was excellent and then this match happened. Nothing speical came from this match and its a typical six man brawl featuring the Dudleys.

Justin Credible w/ Jason, Chastity, Nicole Bass vs Jerry Lynn
If you've never seen Jerry Lynn or Justin Credible wrestle, please stop watching WWE and watch a match of theirs, or no, just watch this one!  Everything that is the ""wrestling"" in ECW was on display here, as well as the passion and skill and devotion of great wrestlers who put on a technical wrestling masterpiece with some of the best ring psychology of any match in history.  (10/10)

Lance Storm vs Chris Candido w/ Tammy Lynn Sytch
I'm ashamed to say I expected an average bout here.  These two managed to put on a match with just as much fervor and intensity as the first match, and yet made sure it was different enough to be unique on its own.  Classical technical wrestling.  (10/10)

Masato Tanaka vs Mike Awesome
These two have had arguably the greatest midcard-to-main event feud in ECW history, and while their ECW One Night Stand 2005 match was a stellar performance on its own, this one is significant competition in being the BEST Tanaka vs Awesome match in the history of these two's feud!  Tremendous wrestling, including amazing cruiserweight-style action from the superheavyweight Mike Awesome, and a BRUTALLY SICKENING bump in which Awesome is powerbombed out of the ring through a table ON THE BACK OF HIS NECK!  Utter classic.  (10/10)

ECW Tag Team Championship
Rob Van Dam and Sabu (C) vs Hayabusa and Jinsei Shinzaki
If ever you had a criticism about Sabu's sloppy style, this is perhaps one of his better (or arguably one of his best) matches, as he and Rob Van Dam work with perfect harmony, against two of the best Japanese wrestlers I have ever seen.  This match, like the previous three, blew me away.  (10/10)

Taz vs Bam Bam Bigelow
A rematch of Living Dangerously which featured the classic bump of Bigelow slamming Taz THROUGH the ring canvas to a DEAFENING pop (that's wrestling slang for a positive fan reaction).  This match had a lot to live up to, but it didn't live up to it.  It made it's own reputation.  A similar bump features Bigelow and Taz breaking through the entrance ramp, and an edge-of-your-seat ending.  (10/10)

The Dudley Boyz (Buh Buh Ray, D-Von, Big Dick) vs Spike Dudley, Tommy Dreamer, and The Sandman
Despite being the main event, I can't help but feel this match was upstaged by the previous matches.  But ECW isn't ECW without some hardcore brawling, and so these six delivered.  There was no phenomenal technical wrestling, but there is plenty to make you go ""OHH!"" with the ECW fans, and make you envious of those getting to chant ""ECW!"" while this happens live.  Just the right sort of ending for arguably the perfect ECW pay per view.  (9/10)

I said it already; this is perhaps the best ECW pay per view ever.  It is perhaps the perfect ECW pay per view.  This deserves my HIGHEST rating for any individual pay per view, even more so than Wrestlemania X7 or either ECW One Night Stand (not WWE).

On an editorial note: The WWE owns the ECW video library.  They've indulged us with plenty of ECW footage, especially for ""ECW Blood Sport"", but for god's sake, if the WWE never releases anything ECW related again, the least they could do is re-release THIS pay per view, bring it back in print.  It is the shining example of everything that is GOOD in pro wrestling, and just how to put on a PERFECT pay per view.",1205971200,,3527,4.587859424920127

The 2 main events on this card also made the WWE 2 Best of ECW dvd's and both tore down the house. They even have a color commentator (Shane Douglas) for those of us who can't stand listening to silence while Joey Styles searches for something to say.  There is Hardcore, Scientific and High Flying wrestling throughout this video it won't disappoint.",1187827200,,522,4.553191489361702
7944521,5,B00005LOLH,"Back when I was in high school, wrestling was all the rage back then, the brutality, the immaturity and hot girls in very little and I loved it. But now wrestling is unexciting and sometimes dull but ECW was way different then imaginable. They had matches that were exciting and adrenaline rushing that left you on the edge of your seat.

This pay per view is considered a classic amongst hardcore wrestling fans, every match could have been a main event caliber match, even without champion Shane Douglas fighting. My highlight matches are Sabu/RVD vs 2 Japanese wrestlers, high risk and extreme, Sabu is one of my Idols in life (see him with Terry Funk on Born To Be Wired and see why) Another was Masato Tanaka vs Mike Awesome, back and forth action with great table spots. Bam Bam Bigelow vs Taz in a Falls count anywhere match with one of my favorite ends ever. And the Street fight with 3D versus Tommy Dreamer, Spike Dudley and the Sandman in basically a weapons galore, table filled and ladders that were not meant for that purpose. Basically for people who want to relive why they liked wrestling at the first place or for those who want a great wrestling brutality view like me. Doubt the WWE version of ECW will be anywhere as good as this back in the day.",1149724800,,1267,4.508695652173913
