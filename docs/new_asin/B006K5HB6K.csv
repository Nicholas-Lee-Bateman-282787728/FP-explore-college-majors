8500075,5,B006K5HB6K,"Excellent copy.  Perfect fidelity and video.  Plays on my DVD player without a hitch.  Tell you a story.  I first saw this Claymation cartoon when I was seven (40 years ago) and is the foundation of what made me a car aficionado to date.  This is a first choice gift DVD for any little boy with just good clean fun.  A story of success that is well written and portrayed in the movie as team spirit.  Long live iL Tempo Gigante ""8"" (my current prototype that carries this name).",1430352000,,478,4.303370786516854
8500076,5,B006K5HB6K,"For many years I have been looking for this movie and it's almost a miracle that I was able to find it considering what I remembered about it.  When I was young and my parents first got cable TV, I remembered watching a movie on TV that was animated (but not how they do The Simpsons or Family Guy, but more like how they did Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer with the Stop/Go Animation using figurines), I remembered it being about a car race, and the ONLY other thing I remember was that the guy who won the car race...did so, buy pushing the gas petal through the floorboard to give the maximum amount of gas to the car and that was how he won.  So for the longest time I was searching online using search phrases like: Wins Race By Pushing Gas Pedal Through Floorboard, or: Figurine Movie About Car Race, etc... and I kept coming up short.  Then...recently...I searched for: Vintage Animated Movie About A Car Race.  It brought me to Wikipedia where it gave me a list including movies like: Cars and Turbo (which aren't vintage either), and as I was scrolling down I saw something about a movie called: The Pinchcliffe Grand Prix, which was done in 1975, and it was Stop/Go Animation.  I immediately looked for it on YouTube and found a clip of the movie where I saw the guy pushing the gas pedal through the floorboard.  I then yelled to myself THAT'S IT!!!  After all these years I had finally found it.  I'm now the proud owner of this rare film and I couldn't be more thrilled to relive a memory from my childhood whenever I want to.

I know this review is more of my story on how I remembered it and how I found it, but I just had to share that story in some form of a public mannerism.  As for the film, it's incredible animation considering the tedious fashion in which it was created and that it was done in 1975 (took them 6 Years to make it), if they did this today it would probably be CGI and it would lose some of its nostalgia that way. It's also critically acclaimed as: The Best Norwegian Film Ever, and was even said to have inspired scenes in Star Wars I (The Phantom Menace).

By all means get yourself a copy of this, if you can, you will love watching it.",1423440000,3,2177,4.285365853658536
8500077,5,B006K5HB6K,Best Movie Ever Made!!!!,1421971200,,24,5.25
8500078,4,B006K5HB6K,"This review is for the English language DVD for viewing on NTSC (American) TVs. I had seen clips for years and have been waiting quite sometime to be able to watch it. However, at this time I have only been able to watch about a third of the film, so I can't comment much on the story except to say I'm really looking forward to watching the rest of it. So far the film is delightful, and the image and sound quality of the disc are terrific. If I had watched it all by this time, I would give it 5 stars.  I can't imagine being disappointed in the rest of the film.  I would love to get this on blu-ray.",1370736000,2,604,3.9834710743801653

8500080,5,B006K5HB6K,Anyone who has purchased this. Does this have the US dub from the states or does it use the British one as seen on Youtube?,1350000000,,123,3.96
8500081,5,B006K5HB6K,I remember watching this as a kid with my grandparents... I have been looking for it for years and finally found it on amazon. Com...
