2183605,3,B0006GAOM2,It was a long time since I had first seen this movie and have been looking for it ever since. The action of the motocross was very good. The stunts exceeded my expectations would recommend.,1237248000,,189,4.428571428571429
2183606,5,B0006GAOM2,"i remember seeing this movie when i was 9 or 10 and searched everywhere for what the title was.  im glad i found it.  in my opinion, this movie is better than the newer ""supercross"" movie.  maybe its just me, but i like the older type movies without the dumbass and repetative computer generated graphics.  also, this movie doesnt press the teenie bopper love story as bad as most these days.  granted, this movie is really cheesey, but still one of the best",1220659200,2,458,4.469879518072289

2183609,5,B0006GAOM2,"Awesome! This once obscure and out of print film is finally out on DVD. If you like motocross then this film will be sure to entertain. Much better than todays ""Rock video"" type films, Winners Take All actualy has charecters and a plot. plus lots of supercross action with Broc Glover, David Baily & others.",1109030400,4,307,4.6
2183610,5,B0006GAOM2,"This movie is so great. I loved it since the day it came out. I have been looking for it everywhere. If you have not seen this movie yet, then you're missing out.",1008460800,5,162,3.9393939393939394

2183612,4,B0006GAOM2,"Some of it was wrong completely like: The part about the night before the big race looks like a spring break not a serous night before a motocross race. That was the way we did it back in the 70's when I raced but todays riders have too much at stake to party like that and then go race hung over!!!

The part about the AMA (American Motorcyclist Association) taking action after the fight is just how they do things I am a member of the AMA and still race and that is how they do things in real racing. They will let some rider knock people around and even wreck other rider and then when someone gets knocked down a few times and has had enough and throws a punch the AMA fines that rider or suspends them or both and warns the rider that was causing all the problem to behave. There are certain riders and teams that can do no wrong but if someone else does it they get fined or docked points or black flagged. It is a shame when you have riders trying to make a living and the AMA wants to run racing like it is wrestling.",1463529600,,1026,4.054187192118227
2183613,5,B0006GAOM2,Classic 80s movie...if you were into dirt bikes growing up...its a must see...,1456790400,,78,5.076923076923077
2183614,3,B0006GAOM2,"The wide screen is fake on this DVD. it is the full screen with top, and bottom cut off, and zoomed in. so their is no true wide screen on this DVD you will actually see less on the wide screen version. you will be missing top and bottom picture, one place of many is when walley repeats tub of lard before the fight. on full screen you can see the nestles crunch bar, but on wide screen you can't see the candy bar. so stick with full screen to get the most picture. but is still one of my favorite movies of all times. so five stars for the movie, but only 3 for this version, because they tried to pull a fast on on us",1451865600,,621,3.8976377952755907

2183627,5,B0006GAOM2,"Coolest movie next to RAD and that's something. These type of movies basically have to same plot so nothing new. It's got a lot of action, very funny at times, and has a decent story. Luckily I bought this 2 years ago for 10 bucks..it cost to much now, but it's worth picking up if you find a good deal.",1383955200,,303,4.066666666666666

2183630,1,B0006GAOM2,"this movie is very lame. it is so old fashioned (well its from the 80's),the acting is horrible.  I got it for my kids to watch because they love dirt bikes. I had to turn the movie off about 25 minutes into the movie because there is a hotel scene between a girl and guy!  It starts out with  a girl in a slinky bikini too!  Definately not for young viewers!  I would NOT recommend this movie to the young or old; the first 25 min were horrible, couldn't even watch anymore.",1271203200,,475,4.119565217391305
