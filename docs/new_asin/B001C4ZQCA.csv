This has to be the best sonic x saga dvd of them all so far
Because it is based off of the Sonic Adventure DX Director's Cut and the
Sonic Adventure 2 Battle video games for nintendo gamecube.",1222387200,10,370,6.8936170212765955

3505520,5,B001C4ZQCA,"My son is a Sonic fanatic. Bought this set for him, and they do a great job. He'll sit in the tv room for an hour and watch the episodes on this DVD leaving me free to get other things done.",1401753600,,190,3.658536585365854
3505521,5,B001C4ZQCA,My grandson loved this-Sonics are his new heroes and they were all he wanted for his birthday. Great birthday gift for a second grader!,1378598400,,135,4.666666666666667
3505522,4,B001C4ZQCA,My son loves this so I bought it for him. I thought it was two whole seasons of Sonic X. But instead it's 12 episodes; six episodes on each DVD. If I had known it was so little for so much money I probably wouldn't have bought it. He is happy though.,1336694400,,250,3.826923076923077
3505523,5,B001C4ZQCA,"I would have to say it's probably one of the best Saturday morning like cartoons I have ever seen.  There is kind of a sad ending to the series though, leaving a lot unexplained.  Some say that the series is complete, but I think they planed on having a lot more personally.  Oh ya, and good job on the prompt delivery.  It was in good condition too :)",1290556800,,352,4.132352941176471
3505524,4,B001C4ZQCA,"Sonic X has spiked the level of urgency & suspense in this DVD compilation. The storyline revolves around the destructive power of an unknown liquid-based Chao life-form Chaos & the ""Ultimate Life-form"" super weapon Shadow the Hedgehog. These are some of the most famous villains from the franchise of Sonic the Hedgehog. The plot is very fast paced & loaded with lots of details surrounding the most dangerous enemies in all of the Sonic Team. Viewers can appreciate the amount of epic action, adventure, & danger as the plot progresses to unfold the storyline of Chaos & Shadow the Hedgehog. The dialogue is very tense due to the characters facing massive competition between hero & villain with an added consequence that failure as a hero will mean widespread destruction for the Earth.
The voice acting is very good in portraying the fears, worries, & conflicts within the characters of the anime series. The amount of emotions the voice actors invest into the characters make the anime series more lively & realistic.
I recommend this portion of the anime series to all anime fans, but optional since 4Kids Entertainment is still very hesitant of keeping the anime series uncut & unedited.
Thank you.",1287100800,2,1205,4.97029702970297
3505525,5,B001C4ZQCA,"This DVD contains the 2 Sonic X Sagas from Sonic Adventure & Sonic Adventure 2 from Season 2 they contain 14 episodes of the series on each disc. This helped me complete my Sonic X season 1 & 2 collection because they don't sell Sonic X DVDs in Australia anymore, so I buy them off Amazon.",1265068800,3,289,4.178571428571429
3505526,5,B001C4ZQCA,"This is probably the best US Sonic X release aside from the Metarex series. Covering Sonic Adventure and Sonic Adventure 2 for the Dreamcast it stays pretty true to the games aside from the added characters so its great if you're a fan. The original Japanese anime is obviously better due to the inclusion of ""Live and Learn"" (the latter game's theme), but this'll do until 4Kids releases an uncut, subtitled version like they're working at on Youtube (support the 4Kids channel on Youtube!). Only thing that ticked me off a bit was the disc art. Shadow on disc 1 (Chaos Saga) and Eggman on disc 2 (Shadow Saga), switching main antagonists could be confusing. Overall great, but no extras.",1249084800,5,689,4.75
