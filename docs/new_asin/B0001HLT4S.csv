8012727,5,B0001HLT4S,"The unsurpassed singing by Ethel Merman and Frank Sinatra more than makes up for the poor, grainy visual quality of the film.  The songs are wonderful.  The stage lighting of Merman is very unflattering - making her look much older than her age.  ""There's No Business Like Show Business"" was produced that same year and Merman looks much, much younger in that film.  I have watched this film several times in the last few months and I believe that it is a superb showcase for Merman's talent.  If you enjoy this film, I would suggest you also check out the DVD ""Judy Duet"", where Merman and Garland sing a medley of Merman's top songs.",1327622400,,635,4.535087719298246
8012728,1,B0001HLT4S,"This DVD is substandard for its' cost.  It seems as though the DVD was recorded from a copy of the original version taken by the viewer as they watched it on a screen.  The picture is difficult to watch, making you dizzy at times, many distortion lines running through the production and the picture is often off the center of the screen. I do not recommend the purchase.",1219968000,20,371,4.4411764705882355
8012729,2,B0001HLT4S,"If this video didn't have a few minutes of Ethel Merman singing some of her signature tunes (""Blow Gabriel,"" ""You're the Top,"" ""Anything Goes"") this would be a total waste of time.

HUGE sections of the play (including subplots and songs) have been cut to fit into the tv time slot - and, Frank Sinatra is miserably miscast (though sings beautifully). Oh. And the film is grainy and dark.

Worthy only as a curiosity.

(2stars in stead of 1 because it IS fun to watch Ms. Merman)",1106092800,8,479,4.482758620689655
