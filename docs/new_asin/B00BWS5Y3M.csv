5679524,4,B00BWS5Y3M,"This new documentary explores the topic of Hell from the POV of those who accept the notion of the continuation of human consciousness beyond death.  It is interesting to note that the ancient Hebrews had no concept of life beyond the grave, and therefore there is no specific mention of Hell in the Old Testament.

As I have discovered from my own research, many of the ideas underlying both Judaism and Christianity came originally from ancient Mesopotamia -- specifically Zoroastrianism, which pre-dated Abraham by at least 1,500 years.  Central to their beliefs was the concept of Monotheism -- only one God.  Most Christians are taught early on that Abraham came up with this idea, but that is simply not true.  On the matter of an afterlife and Hell, the switch in Jewish thinking came through the Pharisees during the period of time between the composition of the OT and NT, according to this film.

I thought this film did a very good job of presenting the dilemma in which the modern Christian Church (especially the Protestant branches) finds itself.  How to rationalize the God of Retributive Justice (Old Testament) with the God of Restorative Justice (NT).  It is a puzzle, and as one of the interviewees stated, we have to be able to live peaceably, both with ourselves as well as others, within the context of that mystery.

Almost exactly half-way through the film, three columns of verses from the Bible are displayed -- each revealing a different interpretation of Hell -- Eternal Torment, Annihilationism, or Universal Salvation.  Excellent, as this proves what has always been true:  the majority of modern Christians have replaced the idols of old with their own interpretation of their holy book (the ""Paper Pope"", as one person puts it).  Each individual's interpretation (and Book) becomes the new ""idol"".

No two humans will ever fully agree on matters of faith, but most, if not all thinking people agree we all want meaning, and therefore Justice, in our lives.  Unfortunately, as the film clearly shows, each group and sub-group finds itself constantly proclaiming ""truth"" at the expense of honesty.  All human belief is subjective and therefore imperfect, even our ""free will choices and decisions"" about that which we believe.  The film does a good job of laying this out.  Before one can commit to any religion or god, one must decide about life after death.  That mystery, however, by definition remains impenetrable.",1369872000,2,2449,5.004938271604939
5679525,5,B00BWS5Y3M,"Overall it was great & gave each view a fair hearing (including views I strongly disagree with!).

Even though I've studied Hell a lot over recent years, I still found it very thought provoking & learned a few new things, particularly as it also looks at other important things, like how we treat others, belief & interpretation.

Like the first time I watched ""An Inconvenient Truth"", it's left me really wishing everyone around me, both religious & non-religious, could watch it & share the experience :-)",1368921600,2,507,4.883720930232558
5679526,5,B00BWS5Y3M,"A documentary on hell, you say? Wow! How did they get that footage?

Actually HELLBOUND? is a feature-length film that uses interviews with a quirky parade of theologians, pastors, authors, exorcists, and even heavy-metal musicians.

The movie explores the current debate over the Christian doctrine of hell, with a special focus on Protestant quarrels that Catholics should find fascinating.

Moreover, in a nice touch, Catholic philosopher Peter Kreeft makes an appearance in the exact centre of the film. Whether it is intentional or not (the writer and director Kevin Miller attends an Anglican church), this beautiful formal structure artfully communicates the Catholic position for what it is: namely, the golden mean for a hot theological argument.

Hell really exists, says Kreeft, but we simply do not know whether it is populated with many, few, or even one person. Kreeft admirably communicates the Catholic Church's sane and balanced view. He points out that, ""Lead all souls to heaven, especially those most in need of thy mercy,"" is part of her famous rosary prayer.

Kreeft is surrounded on either side of the film by the non-Catholic extremes. One Protestant extreme wants to affirm that over 99% of humanity winds up damned. The film begins with this group of angry cranks.

They abusively voice their extremist view as they demonstrate at the 9/11 ""Ground Zero"" Memorial in New York. The filmmaker himself debates them in a riveting series of episodes.

The opposite extreme is represented in the film by Frank Schaeffer, author of Crazy for God: How I Grew Up as One of the Elect, Helped Found the Religious Right, and Lived to Take All (or Almost All) of It Back.

Schaeffer denies that hell exists, and his contempt for the rationality of Western Christianity's intellectual tradition is palpable.

No doubt Schaeffer's dogmatic skepticism and radical-left politics are a reaction to whatever in his evangelical upbringing has embittered him, but his substitute creed is indistinguishable from a crude and militant atheism, and an angry anti-Catholicism is on display in many of his publications.

Schaeffer is therefore a mimetic double of the other extremist cranks that the film opens with at Ground Zero.
Both extremes are mirror images possessing a deadly certainty, whether it is the misanthropic certainty that hell is stuffed full with most of humanity, or the equally contemptuous certainty that hell is a fairy tale, useful only for spiritual abuse and political manipulation (and therefore obviously empty).

Both extremes are self-righteously certain about who the monstrous villains are.

When avoiding these two extremes, the remaining voices in the film have more interesting things to say about the hell debate. Filmmaker Kevin Miller even reveals his screenwriter's interest in the topic, because hell highlights the dramatic problem of human choice, as screen-writing guru Robert McKee explains in his interview.

HELLBOUND? is subtly and sympathetically committed to promoting a reconsideration of ""universalism,"" the theological idea that everybody will be saved from hell.

From the Catholic point of view, this position would be heretical if, moving beyond a seriously lived Christian hope for the salvation of all, it were to profess in addition that we can know with certainty that everybody will in fact be saved.

(For more details see Joseph Ratzinger's book Eschatology and Hans Urs von Balthasar's Dare We Hope ""That All Men Be Saved""?)

The strength of the film is that it honestly invites us to rediscover what the Christian love is that ""hopes all things.""

It's a salutary invitation, since everybody is daily tempted to scapegoat convenient targets. This ""consignment to hell"" of our favourite hated enemies is always and everywhere a failure to live the Gospel fully.

For people that have only heard the traditional view of Hell, you will never look at hell the same way again, which in my opinion is a good thing.",1368921600,7,550,4.989130434782608
5679529,4,B00BWS5Y3M,"I had the privilege of seeing an early screening of Hellbound?, and I posted my initial (mostly non-specific) thoughts here. Kevin Miller said he found the comment about ""tactical nuclear strike"" to be the highlight of the review. So consider this my full review.

Spoilers are included. Read at your own discretion.

What is Hell? Is it a place of sulfur and ash, or is it more akin to a really bad eternally present Nickelback concert? And, most importantly from a theodicy and soteriology standpoint, who goes there?

Kevin Miller sets off on this journey, and he brings along everyone from atheists, musicians, theologians and bloggers. His goal isn't necessarily to answer the heavy questions introduced.

TECHNICAL

The film looks good. The cinematography captures the humanity behind the people giving their thoughts on this contentious topic, and the landscapes are photographed with naturalistic beauty. The scenes in New York are especially harrowing, especially when encountered with fundamentalist kitten lovers, the Phelps clan.

The sound design is key for a documentary to succeed, and there is nothing in here to detract from the overall thrust of the narrative. Everything is as smooth as one ought to expect from a studious production.

Pacing and editing often (and should) go together, and this film clips along at a nice pace, leapfrogging from fundamentalists, conservatives, info cards, liberals and horror houses. It all blends together, especially after the surprising opening reflecting on 9/11.

NARRATIVE

it is far more difficult to analyze the film as a documentary, but there is a very specific ebb and flow towards the end. The first act deals with setting the stage, introducing the ""who's who"" of the afterlife debate. The second act deals with deconstructing some common misconceptions about hell, as well as some push back.

The third act, which I call ascension, is perhaps the strongest section. The music begins to kick in, the arguments become less about doctrine and more about orthopraxy, and how do we then live in regards to knowing such things. The final shot, which I won't spoil, brings everything full circle.

A tightly done journey.

THEMES

Here is where the bulk of my praise and some of my critiques will arise. I will start with my critiques first, as I always prefer bad news to proceed good news.

I wish there had been more annihilationists present. Though I am on the fence regarding annihilationism, it would've been nice to see more thoughts from the annihilationist camp. I do know Greg Boyd leans toward annihilationism, but I do wish the topic had been explored in a more full fashion. Although, to have Mark Driscoll admit that annihilationists are not out of ""national boundaries"" was insightful and a helpful change in tone from his earlier comments about Justin Brierley.

My second critique is more of a personal nature. I would've liked to have seen more push back on the part of traditionalists, although I sympathize with the idea that it is a majority held view and thus doesn't need to be as strongly promoted.

My praise, being reserved for last, is quite general. The thread of universalism runs through, but is firmly grounded not only in a healthy respect for Scripture but also deeply embedded in christology. Robin Parry makes an excellent point that I will paraphrase, ""Jesus is pretty the reason he is a universalist."" And if you haven't read his book The Evangelical Universalist, you ought to. The film is an incredible resource of literature, articles, blogs and a diverse spread of opinions that will challenge and provoke you to think long and hard about the nature and timelessness of the afterlife.

Greg Boyd's humble tone is wonderful, as he makes it clear that christian universalists are not outside the bound of orthodoxy. Though he is not a universalist, his remarks are helpful for keeping the debate civil and responsible. Robin Parry is lucid and, dare I say, lovely? Though I had heard several of his excellent lectures, I did not expect him to be as down to earth as he was. Rounding out the excellent cast is Frank Schaeffer who is both blunt and uncompromising, and Brian McLaren who offers his general thoughts on the sociological nature of the hell debate, as well as the idea of Jerusalem's destruction in 70AD.

Preterism. Atonement. Soteriology. Gehenna. Free will. It's all here.

And on a final humorous note, Michael Hardin's comparison of ""The Satan"" to a prosecuting attorney ala Rudy Giuliani still makes me chuckle.

CONCLUSION

Where does Hellbound? land theologically? Honestly, right where it needs to. Presenting a case for universalism in the hopes of creating a discussion is right where this film ought to be. The film does not compromise it's vision, but doesn't disrespect the audience into thinking it must make an instantaneous decision.

Robin Parry makes a point here, as well as in his book, that the traditional view should not be easily abandoned. Tradition and history have their place.

Though annihilationism is largely absent, the manner and conduct of Hellbound? is both respectful and largely positive. The cast is uniformly interesting and compelling, and Kevin Miller has created a timely piece that addresses the nature of evil in a profound and different way.

And I still stand by my previous comments about ""tactical nuclear strike.""

5679531,4,B00BWS5Y3M,"This is a great film, but I wish it had gotten more into the proofs about how we know, biblically, that hell is to purify people so they can stop resisting God's love and go to heaven with everyone else. That's what many of the Church Father's believed for a long time and a good half of the church, as well, before Augustin and the Holy Roman Empire crushed that belief and wiped out most of its recorded documentation. The Jews never had the eternal hell belief. It came from the Pagans originally, all of whom eventually converted to Christianity and brought over some of their beliefs. That's why there were so many Pagan beliefs passed down from the Holy Roman Catholic church. The Old Testament has several passages that say things like God will restore everyone and everything, all of creation, not just some people. And it uses that same basic wording, too.

That's why the New Testament says Jesus saved the whole world, not just some of it. It's why Jesus' parable of the 100 sheep says Jesus save all 100, not just a few or most. Once the church ruled that hell was eternal in the 6th Century, suddenly people start saying that when Jesus said He saved ""all,"" He only meant ""some."" But it's pretty easy to prove that's not what He meant. Religion tends to interpret scripture through its own doctrines rather than take a fresh and honest look at it, because we're raised with these old beliefs and therefore predisposed to see them in scripture.

A couple of good books on this subject are Hope Beyond He'll and At the End of the Ages. They sort out the subject pretty well and in pretty simple terms.",1453075200,4,1612,4.517123287671233

The heart of the argument starts just before the middle with scriptural references and some very good logic on why a God who says to ""love your enemies"" and ""forgive so you will be forgiven"" must be compassionate to always do the same.  But the movie tends to deny the existence of hell.  This of course is not biblical, for even if you don't refer to the times the specific word hell is used, Jesus says so many other times and in so many other ways that denial of God and/or him (the gospel) will cause separation from God and himself at one's death.

I do not believe the men and women in this movie are bad, I do however believe there is some deception entwined with good healthy questions. This movie raises some excellent questions until you hear the other side of the scriptures. If a very liberal Christian watched this or perhaps even an atheist/deist they would probably find the ideas expressed to be on par with their beliefs. They demonize evangelicals or those that disagree with their belief in all people going to Heaven. Scripture does not teach all people end up in heaven, if so why choose Jesus now when really you can do all you wish suffer for an alloted amount of time then you are ready for heaven. Please view the words of Paul and Jesus on those written in the book of life. When taking on scholarly matters please do not trust the opinions of those who are not scholars. Why would I trust someone who read WebMD to diagnose an illness when I have a Dr. that has studied these subjects to give his service to those in need. They had a hand full of scholars or those who write academically to address those that are revered in the academic and evangelical world.

5679544,1,B00BWS5Y3M,"Christianity had been plagued with various false teachers since the days of the Apostles. That is certainly true today. It is difficult to know what interpretation of the Bible to believe. And then there are the Mystics who believe in practicing Hindu meditation to get fresh revelation and yoga.... My first viewing of this movie deeply troubled me. I viewed it twice to take a closer look at the three categories of Christianity they put forth. Traditional or reformed view of Hell; Univeralism, wherein all are saved and go to heaven - no one goes to hell; and annihilation, wherein people do not suffer in flames eternally.
I have read through the Bible numerous times and listened to many different preachers during the past decade and am in the reformed mindset. I thought the Bible stated those beliefs when I first read through it and I chose a church that I thought preached the Bible. Am I right? Well, I will be the one who suffers if I am not right. I certainly am looking closely so that I might not err, my title is from Isaiah 9. That verse troubles me, and the books of Kings are full of examples of people being led astray to destruction by their spiritual leaders.
  I don't understand how anybody could be a universalist knowing that Jesus talked so much about hell.
  I also don't understand how people can deny that God the Father sent His Son to be a ransom for sinners who would believe in him. The Old and New Testaments talk about the purpose of his coming.
  The only possible explanation for many of these interpretations of Christianity is that these people have decided that scripture is outdated and that God has spoken some new revelation to them. I know that the emergent church seeks new revelation via Hindu meditation, they have certainly gotten corrupt revelation, because it is UN-biblical.
  Reading through it frightened me. Yes God is loving, but as Paul Washer put it in one of his sermons, ...""if you love children, then you have to hate abortion; if you love Blacks, then you have to hate slavery; if you love Jews then you have to hate the holicost..."" The scriptures talk about God's hatred of those who sin. And sin is equivalent to doing what transgresses God's commandments.",1423180800,3,2222,4.664961636828645

My criticism of the film is their choice of persons presenting the more traditional view of a literal hell.  Using Westboro Baptist, Mark Driscoll and the lead singer of GWAR are not exactly the most objective persons they could have used.  There are excellent scholars and theologians that line up with this view and it would have done the film much better to use them, but I think the film makers choose the ones they did for a certain purpose.

While objectivity may be a little suspect, I don't think it greatly affects the overall quality of the film.

Rather, he pushes a specific outcome by setting a stage that those with one view are close minded, uneducated, and somewhat heretical. Using soundbites from those on a spectrum with whom he disagrees, and mostly, bringing into focus what any Bible believing Christian would call a whacked out nut job (the crazies in NYC), our wanderer makes it almost inevitable to come to a certain conclusion and that sits poorly with me. Not the actual conclusion, but the way he funnels viewers into said conclusion. However, the questions themselves are solid, the need to ponder them fascinating. I would like to have seen an equal representation but I suppose all documentaries are sort of biased in nature.

It may not answer definitively if there is a Hell or not, but for sure you will have a better understanding that God isn't about sending people to Hell, He's about loving all of His creation. Some believe that if you don't believe the way they do, yes, you're going to Hell. Not because you crossed a moral line, but because you don't accept their interpretation of scripture.

The documentary does not delve much into a comparison of the proof-texts used by Bible interpreters to prove their differing views on Hell--whether preterist, eternalist, annihilationist, or universalist.  Rather, it contrasts those who arrive at their doctrine of hell from a literalist, black-and-white, wrathful letter-of-the-law, Bible analysis and those who seek to understand hell from a spiritual, loving, law-written-in-the-heart approach.  The documentary demonstrated the narrow-sightedness of a more immature pop-religion.  One ""evangelical"" fundamentalist interviewed, in seeking support for his own view of hell, collapses the complexity and differences on the issue by stating that ""even the Eastern Orthodox believe in hell.""  Thankfully, the documentary doesn't let the sleeping dog lie with this remark, but actually includes commentary on hell from at least two Eastern Orthodox Christians--Bishop Lazar Puhalo and Frank Schaeffer (Francis Schaeffer's son who left ""evangelical"" fundamentalism to become an Orthodox Christian).  Actually giving air-time to Orthodox Christians is a refreshing surprise in this documentary.  In my experience of watching every documentary I can find on spiritual issues, usually Eastern Christian perspectives (e.g., Ethiopian, Greek, Assyrian) are either neglected or ignored.  Although I wish the documentary would have given more time to looking into Eastern Orthodox understandings of hell-fire, at least they allowed some members of this ancient Christianity to speak rather than ignoring them.  The documentary highlights the chasm between the God who is Love and the whimsical, wrathful god of the calvinist ""gospel"" or the limited, wrathful god of the arminian ""gospel.""  The documentary failed to demonstrate the differences between Roman Catholic teachings of hell and Orthodox Christian teachings.  For instance, it fails to mention that ideas on hell were a major point of contention between the Western, Latin Church and the Eastern, Greek Church.  At one of the Lateran councils, Saint Mark of Ephesus upheld the Orthodox Christian view of uncreated hell-fire against the punitive, Augustinian view of material, created hell-fire as maintained by the Pope.  Luther and Calvin simply imported the Latin view of hell into their own self-defined theological systems based primarily on Augustine, who was influenced greatly by Manichaeism.  So the documentary doesn't go much into the nitty-gritty of things, but it does present to the viewer alternative views on hell, giving voice to those less heard in our Protestant-vs.-Catholic culture, serving as a gateway to further exploration and a springboard for inter-faith dialogue and interpersonal discussion.  The documentary also gave time to looking at counter-culture movements which have reacted against the Western view of hell.  A great step toward realizing the number which Western Christianity has done on the minds of people born under its sway!",1390435200,2,3275,5.863157894736842

5679557,5,B00BWS5Y3M,"Hellbound? opens up in New York on the anniversary of 9/11. I must admit my first impression was mixed given a certain sense of 9/11 saturation. Nonetheless, I could appreciate the logic of beginning a documentary on hell at Ground Zero. Not only are these terrorist acts taken by many to be the very embodiment of evil (thereby raising the question of justice and hell) but 9/11 is one horrific moment in a long history of justice by retribution. Al Qaeda attacked the United States as an act of retribution for the US presence in Saudi Arabia. And in the wake of 9/11 the United States responded in kind by attacking Afghanistan and Iraq, culminating in the killing of Osama bin Laden in Pakistan on May 2, 2011. An eye for an eye for an eye  for an eye for an eye.

Ground Zero serves as ground zero for the film, as we return several times to the streets of New York culminating in the closing scene of the film to which I will return. Kevin Miller, the director, makes his first appearance moments into the film on the streets of New York speaking to a couple members of the infamous Westboro Baptist Church. There they are on the streets of the Big Apple, trampling all sense of decorum and basic humanity as they elevate their incendiary placards promoting the hatred of God on this somber anniversary.

Now I have to pause at this point and note the complaint of Mark Galli who opens his review of the film at Christianity Today by grumping: You know a documentary about Christian faith is in trouble when it begins with film clips of and interviews with people from Westboro Baptist, the infamous hate-filled fundamentalist church in Topeka, Kansas. Whats Gallis problem? Apparently that Westboro folk are not representative of those who advocate for eternal conscious torment and thus their inclusion poisons the well. As far as cinematic complaints go, that sounds about as sophisticated as a thirteen year old Bieber fan dismissing the latest Wynton Marsalis album by complaining It has too many horns.

For any thoughtful reviewer of the film, it becomes clear that the Westboro folk are included for several thematic reasons. For example, there is the theme of hatred. Theologians from Tertullian to John Piper have argued that the elect will share Gods hatred for the reprobate and thereby will delight in their eternal damnation. There will be no sadness among the elect in eternity regarding the fate of the reprobate. Westboro folk unsettle us because they express hatred and happiness over hell now. So how can traditional advocates of hell avoid the prospect that Westboro presents a sobering prolepsis of eschatological misanthropy?

The Westboro folk also illumine the theme of retributive violence. Just as Al Qaeda acted with retributive violence toward the occupants of the Twin Towers, and Americans in turn exercised retributive violence in the Middle East, so now Westboro strikes out in retributive violence on the streets of New York with their hate-filled placards. Millers abortive attempt to conversate with them begs the question of what can break through these cycles of retributive violence.

Finally, I note the theme of what I call two-tiered total depravity. Many advocates of traditional views of hell argue against universalism by appealing to our moral revulsion at the prospect of folk like Hitler being saved. (See my article The very worst reason to reject universalism.) Needless to say, many of us would not have Westboro congregants at the top of our to-be-saved list. The temptation to return hatred for hatred forces us to ask whether we would be disappointed if we were to find the most hateful folk receiving Gods grace. (I recommend everyone consider the list of those to be saved in the Lost Dogs song Breathe Deep (the breath of God). If there are anybody you don't want on that list ask yourself why.)

It must be said that the inclusion of the Westboro folk effectively illumines these themes in an emotionally powerful way that serves the purpose of the documentary well. And thus Gallis initial complaint does indeed reflect poorly on his sophistication as a reviewer of film.

Now you're probably wondering why Ive taken the time to mount a critique of the opening sentence of Gallis review. The reason is because the review, which really consists of little more than an angry and dismissive bit of sermonizing, has a single purpose: keep people from seeing this film. Folk like Galli apparently don't even want people to have conversations on the universalist interpretation of hell. And I think I understand why. Because in his view the Church has already settled that issue. Perhaps Galli thinks of himself as a latter day Athanasius. Just as Athanasius looked with horror at the Third Council of Sirmium in 357 which rejected the homoousios doctrine of the Council of Nicaea so Galli looks with horror at a contemporary Sirmium which would question hell.

The problem is that the nature of hell is quite different from Christology. The church has always had defenders of annihilationism and universalism as minority witnesses over the dominant eternal conscious torment view. And we cannot let people like Galli stifle these important conversations.

Miller interviews a large number of people for the film (perhaps too many) and he skillfully interweaves clips from the various interviews from pastors, theologians, evangelists, Bible scholars, atheists and others. Annihilationism does not get much attention as the battle lines are drawn between two sides. On the one hand there are those who defend eternal conscious torment (ranging from the scary pastor Mark Driscoll to the reasonable and approachable philosopher Jerry Walls). And on the other hand you have those who defend universalism (ranging from the affable Old Testament scholar/editor Robin Parry to the lively Frank Schaffer).

The best documentaries manage both to inform and entertain and Miller aims to do both. To that end the film makes sparing but effective use of animation to illumine the points of some talking heads as well as an intriguing, if somewhat tangential segment featuring heavy metal performers.

Along the way the film provides a sufficient number of provocative topics to fuel hours of searching discussion. What does the Bible really teach? How do we decide which texts will have interpretive trump when we read the Bible? How could the God of Jesus Christ require eternal retribution for some of his subjects? If those who are saved are no better than those who are damned, then is not the choice to save one group rather than the other not arbitrary? And so on.

Of course, equally hard questions could be raised about universalism. If God really will ultimately save all, why is the Bible not clearer on the fact? And if universalism is true then why have most Christians repudiated it? And can a church that believes in universal redemption through Christ maintain its fervent evangelical witness to a suffering world?

Based on the documentarys failure to raise these questions one could argue that it is not a perfectly balanced portrayal of the issues by a disinterested bystander. It is, rather, a provocative exploration of the issues from a documentarian who has his own personal beliefs and invested interests which clearly lean in the direction of a universal reconciliation of all humanity through the atoning work of Christ.

But then why would somebody think that a perfectly balanced portrayal would provide a better documentary? People who complain about balance forget that a documentary isn't the final word. Its a platform for further discussion.  To that end the film achieves its goal in spades. It intrigues, provokes, surprises, and occasionally irritates.  And in that regard it does just what it should do.

This brings me to the final scene of the film which is back in New York and movingly depicts people on the evening of 9/11 releasing fragile, flickering paper lanterns into the dark water. And as these lanterns are carried out into the surrounding darkness, we see in their flickering light the promise of hope for a better tomorrow that might finally break the cycles of retributive violence  for now and eternity.

Almost to the point of being central - the primary reason for believing in G*d and Christ is to avoid going to hell.  They may not say it overtly, but it was interesting that in 2 of the film's examples, and countless others from my own Fundamentalist past, the main approach by evangelizers is to drum up the fear of hell and divine punishment.

Using the Bible as my sole reference

1. Are unwilling to ask the tough questions
2. Are just trying to protect their position of power and influence as ""the gatekeepers""
3. Are doing ""exactly"" what the Pharisees who killed Jesus did
4. Are insecure
5. Are more concerned with theology than the content of their own character
6. Are afraid they have wasted their lives
7. Need their enemies to roast in hell forever
8. Believe they are ""the good people who deserve heaven"" and others are ""the bad people that deserve punishment""

and on and on and on. So, the motives and intellectual honesty of those who hold the view of hell that the church has held since its founding are suspect. On the other hand, the universalist view that has been held as heretical is presented as rooted in pure hearts, pure motives, and intellectual rigor.

And don't even get me started on the repeated inclusion of the nutjobs from the Westboro Baptist Church. There are no nutjob universalists that could have been included? Of course there are, but they would have embarrassed the universalist position that the documentary maker is attempted to convert viewers to.

The ""documentary"" also makes sure to include out of context scenes of those holding the biblical view, such as Mark Driscoll passionately shouting from the pulpit. It then presents the contrasting situation of a universalist speaking calmly in an office, so Driscoll (intentionally) comes across as emotional, not intellectual. Particularly unfair is when it pairs a Driscoll interview segment with a Westboro Baptist interview segment, as if they are of a kind.

As the title of this review says, the whole ""documentary"" is ridiculously unbalanced.

It is no coincidence that some of those interviewed for the universalist position reject the central gospel position that ""Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved."" (Acts 4:12) However, that fact isn't fleshed out because, again, it would undermine the documentary maker's goal of presenting universalism in the most positive light possible.

Anyone really looking for a balanced discussion of the various views of hell won't find it here. For those who want a quick response to Rob Bell and universalism, there's an 11 minute video called ""The Bible Answers Rob Bell: A Response to Love Wins"", by CPA - Christian Prepared With Answers. For anyone wanting to give Mark Driscoll a balanced hearing, do an internet search for ""Mark Driscoll, To Hell With Hell."" Both of these are, of course, brief treatments of the subject. It would be better to view a rigorous debate between respected representatives, so that flaws in each side's arguments could be exposed by the other party. I can assure you that there are MANY extremely weak universalist arguments that go unchallenged in this documentary.

Most of the positions are well-argued (or well-presented), including those with which I disagree.  There are a couple of strong exceptions.
The friendly folks of WBC are so far off the map that I truly consider them mentally ill.
Also, famous atheist Robert McKee rambles on without making a lick of sense.

Mind you, he doesnt believe in God, but he believes that if you DO believe in God, you must believe in an angry, mean-spirited god.  He comes off not sounding like a true atheist, but as a spoiled little boy trying make his daddy angry.

We get to clearly see the hate and the love of various theologies, and the definite impact those beliefs have on those who hold them, as well as the impact that our beliefs have on the rest of the world.

5679576,2,B00BWS5Y3M,"MOVIE'S OPENING PREMISE (Verbatim Quote after showing some 9/11 related video): ""This is why we want hell. In the face of such overwhelming evil sometimes our only comfort is the hope that somehow, someday, the people who do such things will have hell to pay. But if we're completely honest, is this way of dealing with evil really satisfying? Because if the only way to get rid of evil is to get rid of evil people, who among us will be left? Is hell really God's final answer to our pain? Because if God responds to evil in the same way we do, how can we call Him good? How can we call Him God?""

I cannot buy into the above premise at all and I like to think I am pretty mainstream within the traditional Biblical view of a literal hell. Knowing evil people will eventually have hell to pay is NOT my ""only comfort"". In fact, it's not a comfort at all. God and the salvation God provided me is my comfort. I take no joy in others going to hell because I deserved to go to hell too. It is by grace I was saved. As long as evil people have the breath of life in them, I am rooting for them to come to a saving relationship with Christ and willing to share the Gospel with them if given the opportunity. To answer ""Who among us will be left?"", it is those who were adopted into God's family and became his children whereas previously they were enemies of God (Romans 5:10, Colossians 1:21) and their father was the devil (John 8:41-44).

The film's premise then asks ""Is hell really God's final answer to our pain?"" I have never viewed nor have I ever even heard a pastor teach that hell is God's response to human pain, but rather hell is God's fair and just response in ultimately dealing with demons and sinners that rejected his free and open invitation to eternal life. The film suggesting hell as a final answer to our human pain is a straw man argument that implies God is providing us humans with vengeance for the purposes of soothing us. I say straw man because such an argument doesn't seem logical or Biblical and I don't know anyone that holds such a view. Rather than soothing human need for vengeance, isn't the purpose instead to satisfy God's justice? I DON'T believe ""God deals with evil in same way we do"". I think I am far from alone as a person that believes in a literal hell from COMPLETELY rejecting ALL of the movie's initial premise. Given the poor premise foundation at the beginning of the movie, you can guess what follows.

I see nothing wrong with bias if a person is upfront about it and they are striving as best they can to have their bias line up with what is true. I wish this filmmaker had been more honest about his own bias rather than attempting to disguise the film as an objective documentary. Clearly the film was slanted away from a literal hell view.

Can't say the film was all bad which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of just 1. It did provide a few chances for those that believe in a literal hell to make their case and in a couple of instances picked some relevant well-stated views in support of a literal hell view. That said, if you compare the amount of film time allotted to those who do not believe in a literal hell to expound and make their case, it dwarfed the amount of time allotted to those that hold to a literal hell view. The number of interviewees holding a position of a literal hell were also outnumbered by those that didn't. I did not see balance.

There were people and groups interviewed that hold a literal view of hell that not only I do not support, but that I greatly oppose like the Westboro Baptists who are famous for protesting at funerals with horrible signs claiming God hates f***, God hates soldiers, and the like. These horrible people were given a similar amount of time to explain their view of a literal hell than time was given to more appropriate scholars or pastors with mainstream legitimate credentials that more accurately represent the masses on the literal hell view.

Bob Larson was also interviewed and while he isn't as bad as the Westboro Baptists, his overall theology makes him more of a fringe guy that I would not want representing the literal hell view on the mainstream's behalf.

I don't mind the film making a very brief mention of some fringe views like the Westboro Baptists, but the strong implication of the allotted film time given to the fringe is at worst to lump them together with mainstream literal hell subscribers as a single group or at best to suggest they are separate but equally invalid groups.

The advertising for the film didn't indicate a focus on fringe groups. I was expecting from the film a more balanced contrast between the widely held views on hell rather than on the fringe extreme. I didn't actually time it, but I bet the Westboro Baptists and other fringe that hold a literal hell view in the film got more film time than was allotted to well-credentialed mainstream scholars and pastors that hold a literal hell view.  There was already a greatly disproportionate share of film time given to the view everyone ultimately goes to heaven compared to those that believe in a literal hell which made it all the more unfair that what little time was given to the literal hell view had to be split in half with fringe groups.

Clearly both sides have their fringe, but the film never portrayed the view that everyone ultimately goes to heaven as fringe but always presented the the interviewees with this position as reasonable and enlightened.

Another tactic the filmmaker seemed to employ in order to downplay the literal hell view was to put what little time allotted to this view almost entirely towards the early part of the movie rather than balanced throughout. Points made early are not as impactful at the end as they are not as freshly made and the rest of the film allowed much time to attempt to tear down the earlier points made for the literal hell view. I would have hoped for a more balanced back-and-forth between the views leaving it up to the viewer to decide at the end of the film.

Robert McKee, Author/Atheist was extremely interesting. Putting himself in the shoes of a Christian, he had great comments/insights about why hell cannot be eliminated. He pointed out the dichotomy of God as a God of love and a punisher and that there are what he called ""wussy"" Christians who cannot handle God as a punisher so they try to soften the view of God to suit themselves. He points out that choices in life matter, but if there is no hell (ie, no real consequences for our choices), then choices don't have any meaning because everyone goes to heaven regardless ... and if choices don't have meaning, life has no meaning. By eliminating hell, he suggests the Christians promoting this view are sucking the meaning out of life. Wow. That's well-articulated and very insightful coming from an atheist.

Mark Driscoll is known for being animated at times and pushing envelope a bit in communicating. He's not typical. Why an expert with a more moderate style was not chosen to be the primary representative of the literal hell view in the film seems obvious. Because of his style, it was easy to find a clip of Driscoll that was self-serving for the film's bias and the clips were played without giving well-rounded context. The incorrect implication is that all people that hold a literal view of hell push the envelope with an animated style like Driscoll.

When actually interviewed as opposed to sermon clips, Mark Driscoll did a very good job of defending a literal hell view of hell in the short amount of time given. There were some lost opportunities on some people that would have made great interviews, but the film instead gave extremely little interview time to these people and/or carefully chose non-interview clips of them speaking elsewhere that left their true viewpoint poorly communicated. These include John Piper, Ray Comfort, and Hank Hanegraaff.

The film never communicated a well-rounded overview of the literal hell view. It got bits and pieces, but not a cohesive whole. I doubt it is because Mark Driscoll failed to provide the filmmaker a better and fuller overview, but who knows what ended up on the cutting room floor? I'm tempted to elaborate here with a fuller overview of the literal view of hell, but this comment is already long and it would be hard to do it justice in such a short space. I'll try to make some short comments on aspects the film was moving towards, but stopped half-way.

Driscoll made a great and important point that not everyone is a child of God, but rather they are adopted into God's family. As good a point as this was, it came across weak without providing more support. I wish the film had shown the Biblical support to validate not everyone is adopted as a child of God such as: (1) prior to our salvation, we were enemies of God (Romans 5:10, Colossians 1:21). (2) Prior to our salvation our father was not God but instead our father was the devil (John 8:41-44). (3) If everyone goes to heaven, then God has no enemies and destroys no one, but clearly He does have enemies and they are destroyed (Hebrews 10:27). If everyone is an adopted child of God, shouldn't no one be left to be an enemy and be destroyed? (4) If everyone goes to heaven (implying everyone is adopted), why does the Bible say few find the path to salvation and broad is the road to destruction (Matthew 7:13)? None of these points were made in the film.

There seemed to be general agreement from all views in the film that we all deserved hell with the difference remaining on whether all or only some actually escape the hell they deserve. If only one person was pardoned, does that change the fact the rest are still justly getting what they deserved? If not, what happened to the previous general agreement that everyone deserved hell? Did that one pardon really suddenly make all the rest unjustly punished? If so, how? There is no Scripture to support God is obligated to save everyone. The pardoned one got non-justice, but are not the rest still justly punished?

This analogy might be helpful. If the governor of your state chose to pardon one serial killer that was clearly guilty, would that make the rest of the clearly guilty serial killers in your state unjustly imprisoned or would it mean that one killer got mercy while the rest got what they deserved? Based on that one pardon, would you demand the governor to pardon and set free all the serial killers in the state in order for him to be fair about it? Would you view your governor as a monster if he didn't conform to your demand to free all serial killers?

In your honest reaction to such a situation, would you truly be more focused on why the governor pardoned the one serial killer or would your focus be on why he didn't pardon all the serial killers in order to be fair about it? If you are honest, my guess is you would view your governor as a monster if he did pardon and set free all the serial killers in the state. I think 99.9%+ of us would focus on why the governor showed such mercy to such a single undeserving serial killer and NOT focused on the rest of the serial killers who remain justly imprisoned. Why then should we focus so incredibly hard on God not pardoning all sinners from hell? Why then is our focus not on why God provided unthinkable mercy of pardoning even one undeserving sinner?

I understand the well intentioned and purely human logic that God is strong enough to successfully save everyone in the end, but the result is to essentially require God to conform to their view of saving everyone or else they judge/reject God as an unloving monster. Isn't that demanding grace and mercy for everyone? By definition, grace and mercy cease to be grace and mercy if they are demanded or expected or required. Rather than demanding or requiring grace and mercy for everyone in order for us to have a favorable view of God, instead shouldn't we who God chose to give grace and mercy be all the more thankful for it?

God is indeed love, but love is not His only attribute.  Justice is also an attribute of God. Many people seem to expect God to display His love, but they have a huge problem with God displaying His justice. Both are glorious attributes of God. In my finite human mind, I don't like the concept of hell and I wish no one goes there, but I'm not God and I recognize that God's ways are higher than my ways (Isaiah 55:9). If God wants to display His justice, who are we to say he cannot? I think Romans 9-18-24 is pretty clear and this compelling viewpoint provided in Scripture was nowhere to be found in the documentary. How could a balanced, even-handed presentation leave out such a clear point?

Romans 9:18-24
18 Therefore God has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy, and he hardens whom he wants to harden. 19 One of you will say to me: ""Then why does God still blame us? For who is able to resist his will?"" 20 But who are you, a human being, to talk back to God? ""Shall what is formed say to the one who formed it, `Why did you make me like this?'"" 21 Does not the potter have the right to make out of the same lump of clay some pottery for special purposes and some for common use? 22 What if God, although choosing to show his wrath and make his power known, bore with great patience the objects of his wrath--prepared for destruction? 23 What if he did this to make the riches of his glory known to the objects of his mercy, whom he prepared in advance for glory-- 24 even us, whom he also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles?

For those holding a view that God is a monster if he doesn't save everyone, I ask you to prayerfully consider that God can be every bit as powerful when He displays His justice as when He displays His love. I'm not suggesting it isn't hard to understand how that can be in our human minds, but I think we need to have the perspective that we cannot fathom His higher ways, but that we trust Him and we believe His Word (ie, the Bible).

There is so much more I wish I could provide in support of the literal hell view, but I don't want to make this long review any longer. I hope what I have written has helped provide some balance and food for thought and discussion on this topic.  Even if you disagree with my view, I hope you can see there is a more reasoned view and support for the literal hell view than provided in this film and that it was at least helpful in that sense.",1372723200,12,14447,4.460810299129117
5679577,5,B00BWS5Y3M,"Should you purchase and/or view this film? Well, duh, Hell yeah!

Why? When you're in Hell, keep on truckin' through it until you get out. So this film takes us on a road trip--from the common view of Hell--and then, it goes even deeper into Hell. The history. The biblical background. The historical views of the church. The options: infernalism, annihiliationism, and universalism. The consequences: what the different views say about who God is and how we live out our theology.  For example, the documentary is bookended by 9/11 terrorists who had a particular view of their God and Hell, and they acted it out. So, for me, the message of the documentary is for humanity to find its way, by the grace of God, out of the Hell we are creating right now.

To those with ears to hear, listen! Our view of God and Hell shapes us. If we see God as ultimately excluding, expelling and executing the people marked ""damned,"" then ""righteous people"" (let the reader understand) will act this out.

Isn't this a depressing topic for a movie? Hell no! There is a lot of humor in this film. And the film ends, rightly, on a joyful, Christ-centered, hopeful note. The last few minutes feature testimony from a dude named Michael Hardin who absolutely nails it. Pure Gospel, do not be afraid, casting out all fear gold!

Anything else? You bet! The director's commentary takes you on another Hell of a Ride. The back story is captivating, with a few more crazy twists and turns. The bonus features include even more interviews with folks who have thought deeply about the consequences of how we live out our views of Hell.

Any criticisms? Look, there is only so much you can fit into one 2-hour documentary. So we are treated to a largely Western, white, mostly male, internal Christian debate/conversation. Director Kevin Miller crammed in a much as he could. Yet he left out many vital perspectives.

Not everyone is going to appreciate where this film ends up...  And they (Israel) go on building the high place of Topheth, which is the valley of the son of Hinnon (that's Gehenna, folks) to burn their sons and daughters in the fire--which I did not command, nor did it come into my mind. (Jeremiah 7:31) In other words, it did not enter God's mind to send children, people, into the fire of Gehenna--it never entered his mind! The document, thus, points to a hopeful, loving, never-give-up-on-people vision of God.

Time to rethink, repent, revision what God is saying to us through the scriptures. I believe this documentary contributes to this needed, healing process.",1372550400,3,2565,4.759009009009009

It spends a disturbing amount of time showing scenes from 911...which have nothing to do with whether Hell exists or not.  The conservative Pastors were given very little time to educate the audience from their prospective(and what time they did get was taken out of context to help prove the universalists points)...and WHY in the world would they feature (way more than any other group in the film) the Westwood Baptist group?  #1, they are NOT Baptist, and #2 they are NOT Christians.

While I agreed with it's overall conclusion and premise, if you want fair and balanced, keep looking or make a documentary for yourself. Overall though, the talking head moments with Frank Schaeffer, Mark Driscoll, and Greg Boyd were terrific. I would definitely recommend this to anyone, anywhere of any belief.

5679586,5,B00BWS5Y3M,"I saw this movie when it played for a short time at a local theatre and could not wait to get it on DVD in order to dissect it more thoroughly.

You can watch this movie 10x and still have trouble grasping all the information it has to offer on the aspects of hell, different interpretations of life after death as well as how religion reacts to the idea of an eternity of punishment. The special features include more in-depth interviews with certain authors/theologians which is a great bonus for those who want to hear more from certain people featured in the movie.

If you are a fan of Mark Driscoll or John Piper, I would suggest you prepare yourself for a poorer view of them to be shown but in all fairness to the movie, their words were not taken out of context but shown to contrast different views and presentations of faith as well as the ability to be open to views other than their own.

This is a movie that needs to be given full attention and even if you disagree with some aspects, it is a great learning tool to address the idea the hell and open a discussion with those who watch it with you. STRONGLY RECOMMEND for anyone; atheists, agnostics, christians, catholics, mormons, ect.

I feel like the movie was respectful of many world views of hell, minus the Westboro Baptist advocates--but let's be honest, the interviewer was as respectful as he could be when interviewing that group of people.",1370649600,3,1416,4.51953125
5679587,5,B00BWS5Y3M,"I just watched this for the first time last night, and got a lot out of it. :)

After struggling with the traditional teaching of hell (people being punished by or separated from, God forever and ever without end), and the picture of God it painted, for years; about a couple of years ago, after reading Rob Bell's Love Wins, I started looking into Christian Universalism, and eventually I embraced it wholeheartedly.
I believe that was where my heart was for a long time, what I longed to believe and ached to believe, that God would eventually save everyone and that everything and everyone would be okay in the end, but my mind wouldn't go there because I didn't think I was allowed to believe it or thought it was too good to be true.

But when I actually started to look more deeply into it rather than just assuming it couldn't be true, I found how much support there was for it biblically and logically, and how much better it lined up with my own experience of God, and so I don 't feel like it's just wishful thinking or something crazy.

Of course this is just my take, but I will say that coming to see things in this way has helped quell much of the turmoil inside of me that I had for years.
I still have my struggles, still have fears and doubts sometimes like anyone, but I have more hope for the future now, more hope for my family and friends, and for the world, and I feel a little more free to ask questions and to wonder about things without fear of getting thumped by God if I maybe get off track, because I have a little more confidence in God's love, and that's certainly an improvement, imo :)

Anyways, enough about me...

I thought the movie was pretty well balanced for the most part, and gave both of the opposing sides a fair hearing (though I will say that the annihilationists, the people in the middle on this matter, maybe could have used some more airtime, Greg Boyd being the only one in the film to my knowledge, and perhaps people from other religions could have given their input), though it leaned in favor of universal reconciliation, but I think that's because Kevin Miller leans in that direction himself, and he wanted to show that there is another way, a more hopeful way, of looking at the world, and looking at the gospel, than looking at it through the traditional, and decidedly 'us and them'/'winners and losers', lens.

And I have to say that Miller as an interviewer is pretty patient and respectful even towards those he disagrees with, though you can tell his patience is wearing thin with the Westboro folks (though I love how he backed them into a corner when he asked them about their love for their children...), but then who can blame him? ;)

(Just to point out though, not every person who believes in eternal conscious torment is like the Phelps, thankfully.
There are a lot of people who hold to a more or less traditional hell teaching and yet are decent people of good character, capable of compassion and understanding.
I've met a few people like that myself, so I know this is the case. :)
There were even people like that, decent people who happen to believe in an everlasting hell, interviewed in the documentary, though the Phelps were not among them, I'd venture to say. :/)

The first half of the documentary focuses more on those who uphold the traditional view, while the second half focuses more on those who oppose it, or have a more hopeful view.
Granted, this means that those in opposition to the traditional view get the last word in the documentary, but then I think Kevin was trying to show that there are is another way of looking at things, and its not like the traditional view hasn't gotten enough airplay over the last 1500 years or so, if we're honest.
I think the other side deserves to be heard out a little more, without being completely drowned out by accusations of heresy or wishful thinking or false teaching or what have you.

This isn't just some mere abstract philosophical idea that we're debating about here... we're talking, as Rob Bell put it, about the fate of every person who ever lived.
We're talking about the final fate of human beings here, people with names and faces, people with struggles and fears, people with hopes and dreams, with stories to tell, people who laugh and cry, who feel pain and who love and are loved... they're not statistics or just a bunch of filthy rotten good-for-nothing sinners. They're people, like you and like me.
Jesus said his disciples would be known by their love, and I don't think he meant the love of his disciples to be restricted only to their fellow disciples.
We should love our neighbor as ourselves, right? And our neighbor is whoever happens to be around us, and no matter how different they may be from us. Easier said than done, I know, but that's the calling, and the direction we should be moving in, right?
So if we are to care about other people, all other people, and no matter who they are, then what shame is there in hoping that everyone would be redeemed in the end, that everyone would be healed in the end, that everyone would saved from their own brokenness and their own darkness, would be set free and would be a brother or a sister, a son or a daughter?
What is wrong with at least hoping for that, that they'll have what you believe you have, that they'll be okay like you believe you'll be okay, what's wrong with wanting that for your neighbor, and whoever they may be?

Sorry, I think I'm getting carried away... as I'm sure you can tell, I'm pretty passionate about this. ;)
But I'm just trying to say that I think the people who have a greater hope in and a greater vision of God's power and love, than what much of the church is offering the world today, deserve to be heard out, and if nothing else for the sake of all people out there who are wondering if God's love will fail them, or if God loves their family or friends less than they do, or if God can be trusted with their hearts and their lives, and the hearts and the lives of those they love, or if God were to give up on those people over there, then what's to say He won't give up on me... and it goes on.

I think this documentary, at least to me, wasn't just about hell, but it's also about hope, hope in the name of love for our fellow man, and hope in a God whose grace and love runs deeper than ours ever could...

There was a lot of things to chew on in the documentary, and I'll have to watch it again to pick up whatever I may have missed, but my favorite part was the ending. I wonder if maybe Kevin Miller was trying to share something of his own heart towards the end, and what he believes the heart of God is.

I thought how he wrapped things up was pretty powerful and beautiful and moving, and it brought me to tears actually (and that's saying something, as I'm not much of a cryer), because it spoke to the hope in my own heart, that in the end, because of God's great love, in the words of Julian of Norwich, 'all will be well, and all manner of things shall be well'...

I know there will be those who will disagree with a lot of things in this documentary (or with me here), and I imagine there will be negative reviews that will pop up here and there on the internet, but don't let anyone dissuade you from at least giving this a look.
It's a very important discussion that this documentary addresses, and I think this is a good way to enter into it. :)
So be sure to check it out whenever you get the chance. :)

Blessings to you and peace :)

5679588,3,B00BWS5Y3M,"I think Kevin Miller did a great job of putting together a documentary that leads toward new conversations about the subject of hell. The movie highlights three main positions, while clearly pointing toward a perspective of ""Christian Universalism."" I think the movie could have been titled, ""Christian Universalism: A Not So New Perspective on Hell."" The attention given to the ""traditional/conservative"" view of hell in the movie in my opinion was more with the intent to show how silly and foolish someone looks who holds this view. If the aim was to give a series documentary on exposing various views on hell then Kevin should have addressed the theological/hermeneutical reasons why scholars past and present believe scripture points toward a real eternal hell. All in all, I would recommend the movie with caution as a primer for healthy reflective conversations. As stated in the movie, you have to do your homework and not just know what you believe, but why you believe it.",1370390400,14,983,5.03680981595092
5679589,5,B00BWS5Y3M,"The title of my review comes from a portion of a sermon by Mark Driscoll which you can see for yourself in ""Hellbound?"". The full quote is: ""God hates, right now, personally, objectively, hates some of you. He has had enough. He doesn't care if you compare yourself to someone worse than you - He hates them too."" Driscoll's blood pressure obviously elevates as he belts this out to his congregation; his face turning ruddy, his eyes seething with rage. His demeanor behind the pulpit made me recall Mr. T's character, ""Clubber Lang"", in Rocky III. Just imagine the dialogue if ""Hellbound?"" had been done Rocky style:

Kevin Miller: ""What's your prediction for the salvation of the bulk of the human population?""
Mark Driscoll: ""My prediction?""
Kevin Miller: ""Yes, your prediction.""
[Mark looks into camera]
Mark Driscoll: ""Pain!""

In all seriousness, however, Driscoll comes off to me as just a notch or so below the self-described ""zeal"" of Shirley Lynn Phelps-Roper of the Westboro Baptist Church (who also makes several jaw-dropping appearances in ""Hellbound?""). We are told by numerous fundamentalist/evangelical ""professional Christians"" that rigid, unyielding adherence to very narrow theological viewpoints is the sine qua non of Christianity and that failing to toe the line is the broad way that leads to eternal conscious torment in hell. For those who just can't bring themselves to accept that this is how an immensely intelligent and unfathomable God set up the universe and who question theologies that largely developed after the establishment of scholasticism in the twelfth century, Driscoll has this to say: ""Sometimes when certain questions are asked it's by someone who's a coward and doesn't have the conviction to declare their answer so they throw the question out to cause others to postulate those answers and then they can say 'Well that's not what I said and that's not what I meant, I was just posing a question' - which is the same thing that Satan did in the garden."" So there you have it, if you ask questions driven by your sense that something is amiss with the theology of Driscoll & Company, you're just like Satan! Later in the film, Driscoll and Kevin DeYoung come to agreement that not all people are God's children and some are predestined to eternal conscious torment in hell. It's Calvinism in its full, uncompromising glory and somehow those of us who aren't able to be and think like Driscoll are still eternally responsible for our predestined, ""depraved"" inability to be anything other than what we are as well as for our incredulity toward ideas that simply don't make sense to us.

Mercifully, this film interviews less disagreeable individuals with a more generous theological bent and far less despair-inducing visions of God. One shining example of spiritual health and well-being comes courtesy of Archbishop Lazar Puhalo of the Canadian Orthodox Monastery and whose spiritual radiance was strongly palpable to me during his short appearances during this film. Contrasting Driscoll's barely disguised rage against Puhalo's obvious spiritual attainment says a lot about the (very limited) value of theological dogfights and insistence on ideological adherence to rigid doctrine. As Puhalo states, ""Hell is really your condition, it's not a place. The malice we feel is the fire that burns ... even in this life, if you're really angry with somebody, who burns? You or the person you're angry with? So you're already having a foretaste of hell."" By Puhalo's standard, it is clear that several of the professional Christians in this film may already be getting their foretaste of eternal conscious torment.

I don't want to spoil the film by saying anything more about its content and I highly recommend that you give it a viewing or two. If there is one takeaway message of this film that I didn't expect to encounter, it is that our beliefs about God really say something about our character and way of being in the world. What I find myself wondering after watching ""Hellbound?"" is whether our personality determines what theological viewpoints we will ultimately embrace, or if our theology alters our personality. Maybe it's some of both? Why does one person come to know a God of love and another of fear or hate? In any case, I know what individuals in this film I'd prefer to have a cup of tea with - or see leading a church or engaging in youth ministry, for that matter.
