I was really happy that it came with the original wrap and everything. No scratches and unruined also. as for the movie itself, If you are looking for something good to watch that's cute and interesting then this is the show for you! I actually got it for my two year old (anime family) because he found season one interesting but the second season was a bit darker. Would recommend at least 4+ LOL!",1323129600,,513,4.298969072164948

But besides focusing on the negative of this little anime series, I will focus more on the good qualities of this series. Its a real shame that a lot of people are very negative towards this series, the majority say that it is crappy, but they are far from wrong. Sure its no Fullmetal Alchemist, but neither it is Yugio GX either...
Anyway, enough of my pattering. Here continues the quest of the six adventurers who go out for fun adventures but soon find themselves battling against a Dark Lord and his evil minions. Roan, Yuffa, Takius, Maya, Iruga, and Judia are traveling together when they discover more of the Dark Lord's evil work. They than become wrapped up in a journey to save the world. But there quest are individual, such as Yuffa and Iruga who want their sister/friend back who was taken under the wing of the Dark Lord. Maya is a merchant who only joined at first to get out of danger and to collect and sell rare items, but soon finds herself coming along on the journey for reasons she doesn't entirely understand, but claims that she doesn't want to be left behind. Takius is on the quest for the ultimate truth. And finally Roan and Yudia are after love and a good adventure.
All the while the Dark Lord is convincing and drawing more mystical creatures under his wing, Keough randomly shows up during the series and Yuffa gets her heart broken every time he appears.
There quest takes them to all different places, discovering new dangers and facing old enemies. This series reminded me very much of Final Fantasy or Dragonlance. If you love fantasy and a cute, lighthearted series, than Ragnarok is what you probably enjoy watching. But if you dislike cheerful and cheesy fight scenes than don't bother. And don't allow those that hate the series to discourage/scare you away. Give this series a chance. I even went out and bought the first DVDs out of the three set.",1220140800,3,2027,4.602209944751381
