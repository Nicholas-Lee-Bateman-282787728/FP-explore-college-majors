8539461,3,B009BW0AIA,"The 4 films in this set are truly rarities and the sheer variety of entertainment on offer is worthwhile. TCM have provided a sublime idiotic comedy in ""Million Dollar Legs,' with W.C. Fields in top form heading the madness, a Mae West melodrama with its quota of one-liners and some marvellous songs with Duke Ellington backing the star,  a weak musical comedy in ""Artists and Models,"" with a miscast Jack Benny in the lead, and a robust and exciting epic about the 19th Century slave trade in ""Souls at Sea.""  In fact, ""Souls at Sea"" is an unsung gem, with great performances by Gary Cooper and George Raft, superb production values and direction by Henry Hathaway and a really thrilling climax with a fire and sinking of a ship.

In general, this is a great package but the extras are trivial with the exception of the essays on each film which are available on the TCM website. The prints are very good except for splicing jumps but the bad news is that every disk was faulty and I was unable to see any of the films without the discs jumping reels.  TCM's quality control is suspect and it seems I am not alone in identifying this problem.",1422230400,7,1144,4.51207729468599
8539462,4,B009BW0AIA,"I got this because of W.C. Fields in 'Million Dollar Legs'. I collected volumes 1 and 2 of his comedy collection, and expected a third. There were enough films left for a good 3rd volume, but the DVD market must have tanked along with the rest of the economy. I'm now left to try and scrounge the remaining films individually. And 'Million Dollar Legs' is truly a rarity. I've only caught it once on TCM, and that was during a W.C. Fields month some years back. I don't even remember it in the group of films they used to show late on Friday nights when I was a kid, along with the Marx Brothers movies. As they mention in the notes, it's ahead of it's time. This film was made in 1932, a full year before the Marx Brothers made 'Duck Soup'. And this one is similarly anarchic and goofy. Fields is not the headliner, Jack Oakie is, but Fields still dominates. I am glad to now own this film.

An odd thing about this set is its name, 'Universal Rarities'. Not one of the 4 films on this collection is a Universal picture. All 4 are Paramount productions. And pay attention to the 'Vault Collection' in tiny letters under the TCM logo. It means that the films aren't remastered and cleaned up. Luckily there were decent prints for three of them, but 'Artists & Models' suffers for lack of care and restoration.

I knew that 'Million Dollar Legs' would be good, but I expected more out of Mae West's 'Belle of the Nineties', and Jack Benny's 'Artists & Models'. 'Belle' was made in the dark year of 1934, when the Code was finally able to crush artistic freedom and turn films into government propaganda. Mae West was ruined by the Code and you can feel her chafing under the new restrictions and unable to be the naughty star America loved, and who pulled Paramount from bankruptcy. 'Artists & Models' is more of a curiosity than a film. It really never gets off the ground. It has 'specialties' from the likes of Martha Raye, Louis Armstrong, Ben Blue and Judy Canova, but none of their spots are particularly memorable.

The find of the set is Gary Cooper's 'Souls At Sea'. This wasn't made until 1937, when the jackboot of the Code was firmly on Hollywood's throat. Cooper is a sailor in the 1840s who is helping to fight the slave trade to America. I was surprised that an anti-slavery movie was made during this period. Hollywood would wring its hands at the prospect of alienating its precious Southern audience, and yet this film got made. There were even slaves shown in the hold of the ship. They almost murder a white slavemaster and yet you feel more sympathy for the slaves. By 1937 blacks were not allowed to be seen as anything but slow witted fools. It makes me wonder if this movie played well in the South. I would also be curious about the writers to see if they were politically active. George Raft steps out of his comfort zone and gives a surprisingly good performance as a sailor.

This set is worth having. I don't understand why these particular films don't circulate more, or have more viewings on TCM. I hope they do more sets in the future, but as with the W.C. Fields collections, you just never know.",1356652800,29,3128,4.472854640980736
