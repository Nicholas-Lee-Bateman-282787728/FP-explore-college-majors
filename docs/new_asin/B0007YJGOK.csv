8054050,5,B0007YJGOK,Creative and well done.  There were several approaches to playing Udu I hadn't seen elsewhere.,1490659200,,94,5.266666666666667
8054051,5,B0007YJGOK,"The video was informative, and fun to watch. I don't think I have watched a video of this variety  and had more fun.",1454112000,,116,4.043478260869565
8054052,5,B0007YJGOK,Just right!,1411862400,,11,5.0
8054053,3,B0007YJGOK,"It's OK, considering that it is the only tutorial on the UD, as far as I know. The author is a nice person, it shows several kind of udud, which is useful, but it doesn't tech a lot of rhythms.",1384905600,,193,3.85
8054054,1,B0007YJGOK,"This video was pretty weak on everything, they shot the video in there living room and in there bedroom. The guy actually teaches you sitting on his bed. Not a good teacher, waste of money.",1329091200,,189,4.428571428571429
8054055,2,B0007YJGOK,"This video is a great introduction for novice musicians to gain a better insight into the creation of, and techniques used to play the Udu. Unfortunately the video does not provide the type of information that an advanced player could utilize. Overall good introduction to the art of Udu if you are a beginner.",1239235200,,310,4.7592592592592595
8054056,5,B0007YJGOK,"If you want to learn how to play an udu drum, this will get you started. Lots of background information.",1203984000,,104,4.25
8054057,5,B0007YJGOK,"This is a great video. Barry Hall presents an engaging and highly informational Udu survey.  The sound quality is super and a wide variety of drum designs are discussed and played by several skilled performers.  No prior knowledge of Udu or skill base is presumed. The presenters are very kind to the viewer in breaking down the complexities of their performance into bite size learning bits.  If you are like me and can't wait to get an Udu after viewing this video, I think that you will find that most of what is taught is quite accessible.
The conclusion of the tape features some really tight Udu duets, a gorgeous Udu and ceramic flute duet, and an Udu and ""stone fiddle"" duet.  What is a stone fiddle?  I won't spoil the surprise for you, but I will say that it is pretty unbelievable.  Downsides?  at times the camera work sacrifices aesthetics for a really good look at what is being done with the drum (my wife asked ""where is his head?"".  And If you were Nigerian and had played Udu since childhood, you probably wouldn't go for this one, but then again......",1049155200,10,1070,4.536458333333333
8054058,5,B0007YJGOK,"Even if you only have a passing interest in Clay Pot Drums or THINK you might be interested, this video is worthwhile. If you are already playing or planning to do so, the video is worth its weight in gold.
I've either watched or own just about every drum video that's come down the pike, and this is by far the most entertaining and informative. (Even my wife who has no interest in the Clay Pot Drum whatsoever watched it twice with interest).
I have another Udu Drum Video which I watched many times, but my Udu Drum gathered dust until I watched this one. Obviously I highly recommend this video.",1041552000,9,600,4.414414414414415
