8143138,5,B000I1IX2I,"Admit to wondering what the heck I'd gotten into in first ten minutes, like silent movie type acting.  Once Dr. Watson shows up though, film becomes a hoot.  Amazing classic ""British"" cars (a limo based on a tractor ?) and motorcycle. 221 Baker Street looking whole lot more like Eastern Europe than London.  And some of the supporting characters.",1522195200,,347,4.8474576271186445
8143139,5,B000I1IX2I,"This Russian language English subtitle (activate it via subtitles at top right left of the volume control) and superb production value version of the Engineers Thumb etc. is very well done. The furniture, the houses, the settings, the costumes, the acting are top notch. No wonder the Queen gave the actor a medal for the quality of his portrayal.  I am very fond of this version and I find myself even knowing the story so well following along even though I don't speak a word of Russian. I do like the fact that Russian for Dr. Watson is Watson. A high quality production that treats Holmes as literature with respect. I liked this so well I bought the boxed set in DVD with subtitles of course. Sometimes the subtitles struggle, but it is not too distracting. The furniture, the carvings, the use of wood railings, the chandeliers, and cobble stone streets are very well done. Some of the houses capture the Victorian England feel so well it makes me wonder if Russian architecture still shows that time periods tastes. Elegantly done. Well worth the time to view it. I heartedly recommend it.",1518134400,,1096,4.708333333333333
8143140,1,B000I1IX2I,Awfully slow plot. Russian setting under the pretense it's Sherlock Holmes. What a bummer.,1508889600,,90,5.5
8143141,3,B000I1IX2I,"Clearly not the level of Jeremy Brett or Basil Rathbone. Their over exertion to be British is so Russian it hurts. Good production not bad actors terrible score. For me, after seeing the best, these got tedious.",1508889600,,211,4.72972972972973

8143144,1,B000I1IX2I,"Really Amazon?  Russian Sherlock Holmes, in Russian? Not even subtitles? No mention of this in the description?

Does anybody there even look at these for even a minute?  Digging a little deep in the Blockbuster dumpster here guys.",1496793600,10,231,5.026315789473684
