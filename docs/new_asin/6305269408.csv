7886659,5,6305269408,"I first read Paul Monette when I purchased his ""Becoming a Man"".  I all but fell in love with him!  In some ways, I could identify with his life, and he wrote about it so eloquently.  I have since purchased many of his other novels and memoirs.  When I saw that there was a documentary about him, I immediately bought it.
  It was wonderful to hear his voice and see him in action.  He was a gorgeous young man, and even in his later years, as AIDS slowly destroyed him, he retained that beauty.  I found this documentary to be insightful, and I envy the people who knew him and worked with him.  I wish I could let him know what his writing means to me.
  Anyone who has enjoyed Mr. Monette's writing will enjoy this documentary.  His spirit lives on through his writing and this movie.",1185667200,10,787,4.27891156462585
7886660,5,6305269408,"I was a member of the advisory board of the Hong Kong Queer Festival '98, and I watch this video during our screening session. I found this video a really moving documentary. I realise that, no matter you have AIDS or not you are going to die, but if you are not brave enough to admit to  yourselves that you are gay, and you are not honest enough to love. You  will surely die painfully.",945734400,18,388,4.16
