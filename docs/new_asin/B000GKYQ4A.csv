No doubt as Beauty is in the eyes of the Beholder who goes to any extent to conquer  and very few also go to any extent to keep it alive. That is the other and realistic side of this gift by the Mother Nature. Very good resolution, photography and sceneries. It is also priceless. Full of Hit songs one can continue to enjoy..",1457654400,,434,4.228915662650603

8185748,1,B000GKYQ4A,"I purchased this on DVD (the DEI Eternal Classics edition).  The disc would not register in my player and just sat at a blank screen for many minutes.  Then I hit the DVD menu button and it jumped to the menu where I was able to play the movie. However, it only played to about the half-way point then froze up completely.  It would not skip back or forth from there.  I couldn't play the second half of the movie even using the scene selection menu.  I returned that disc and purchased another copy hoping it was just a faulty disc.  The second one arrived and, to my dismay, operates exactly like the first one!  Two discs faulty in exactly the same way.  I tried it on a second DVD player and that one wouldn't play it at all.

Incidentally, it is a very enjoyable movie.  Too bad I couldn't watch the whole thing.  The one-star rating (should be zero stars, etc.) is for this particular DVD edition by Digital Entertainment Inc. (DEI).  Beware of a possible bad batch or defective mastering.",1370044800,,995,4.406593406593407
8185749,4,B000GKYQ4A,"Shami Kapoor is one of the great comic actors of all time, any continent.  he's a great dancer and dramatic actor as well, but his comic timing is impeccable.  Jaanwar is perhaps most famous to Westerners for the musical number: Tumse Hai Dil.  The music is I saw Her Standing There, but the words are completely different  in the subtitles.  The guys singing don Beatle suits and look like they've had facial reconstruction.  There is something so bazar when you first see this number, your jaw will drop. When Shami Kapoor enters into frame dancing with Beatlesque haircut, it's fantastic.  He shakes and twists and it's amazing. I show this clip to friends all the time and no one ever believes it's for real. But it is.  Aside from the Indian Beatles number, it's a pretty good picture. Some other fun numbers and dancing. And it's always wonderful viewing these 1960's films in Eastmancolor.  4 stars minimum for any picture with Shami Kapoor.",1310342400,2,948,4.766871165644171
