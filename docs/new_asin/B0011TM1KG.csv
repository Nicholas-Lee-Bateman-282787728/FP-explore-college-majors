8242273,3,B0011TM1KG,"I struggled with what to rate this so in the end I gave it three stars. Cons: Very repetitive and obnoxious music background, narrator sounds like he makes 8th grade history video's, photography is pretty poor and touristy, poor editing and film quality, and most of it looks like it was taken in the 80's or 90's, even though it is dated 2006. Pros: I plan to travel there and want to learn more of the sites that interest me the most prior to going. I was able to glean some information in this regard so am glad I watched it to the end, even though a few times I almost shut it off.",1400889600,,585,4.140350877192983

8242275,5,B0011TM1KG,I thought this was a great program had to watch it twice.  The beautiful Buddhist  art and architecture  was breathtaking.  I wish Myanmar the best on becoming democratic!,1364515200,,171,5.0
8242276,1,B0011TM1KG,Camera work is poor and the video has very little in the way of content.  Narrative jumps from one topic to another.  We were spoiled by the BBC travel films and this falls far short of any minium standard for travel videos.,1362009600,2,224,4.309523809523809
