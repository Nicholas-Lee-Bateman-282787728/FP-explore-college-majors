8347636,5,B001XBEHJ0,"It seems like every year that another ""expose"" of the Bible comes out, and the James Cameron production on the possibility that Jesus's bones have been found. If it sells, as Time, Newsweek, and National Geographic have discovered, then who cares about the facts, publish it anyway. Cameron tries to pawn off a great conspiracy, yet his hypothesis has too many holes in it. This video is recommended for anyone who buys the Cameron theory. Good research and evidence trumps every time.",1251244800,3,485,4.926829268292683
8347637,5,B001XBEHJ0,This is an excellent top quality documentary like all the other ones they have ever produced. This is highly recommended for anyone who desires to see unbiased truth. Their films all seek the truth out no matter what the outcome may be. Excellent!,1250640000,3,247,4.767441860465116
8347638,4,B001XBEHJ0,"I thought this was a very informative and insightful film. I like how the filmmakers brought the guests from the original ""Lost Tomb of Jesus"" back to explain how the findings they revealed on the previous James Cameron film were taken out of context.

The only thing I didn't really understand is why they used some house beat for certain scenes in the film. It seemed to throw the tone off for me. In any event, this film wasn't about the execution. I think it did a great job of debunking a misnomer that challenges a lot of people's faith.

Well done.",1244764800,4,555,4.431372549019608
8347639,5,B001XBEHJ0,"I deeply value the careful investigation revealed in the objective evidence shown on The Jesus Tomb Unmasked. Christians have no reason to fear the truth since Jesus came to proclaim the truth that ""set you free"".",1244592000,3,213,4.944444444444445
