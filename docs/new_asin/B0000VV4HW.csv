1956835,2,B0000VV4HW,I started watching this and it was just too slow for me.  I couldn't get past the first 15mins really.  I finally went on to watch something else.  Perhaps it picked up later throughout the movie?,1394150400,2,196,4.388888888888889
1956836,5,B0000VV4HW,This is a great movie. I am glad I bought it for my collection. Neil Patrick Harris is amazing. Recommended must see.,1392940800,,117,4.363636363636363
1956837,3,B0000VV4HW,More of an afternoon special than a feature film.  Terri Garr over acted as usual while Neil Patrick Harris was okay in a part that could have been better written.  Interesting to see him as a teen post Doogie.,1392422400,,210,4.358974358974359
1956838,2,B0000VV4HW,"Dissociative Disorder is a decision deep down within the psyche of the person, that no one really understands.  Whether this is a substantiated case or a feigned condition is my first thought???  If a person hates themselves and who they are enough is it possible they would establish a new identity to be someone new???  This movie raises a lot of questions in my mind.  Terri Garr perhaps over plays her role, but I don't feel like it was an authentic portrayal of the case.  I can't explain why exactly, but it just doesn't convince me.",1391731200,,539,4.572916666666667
1956839,3,B0000VV4HW,"""Stranger in the Family"", was good, yet left me with unsettling feeling that it could have been much better.
I would recommend on the pure fact that it's based on a true story.",1390953600,,176,4.363636363636363
1956840,3,B0000VV4HW,Ok....a very tragic and devastating story of how life can change forever in an instant...I enjoyed seeing Neil Patrick Harris very early in his acting career...,1390953600,,160,5.1923076923076925
1956841,5,B0000VV4HW,I live with this family that this movie is about and they were my foster parents and it was really hard to talk to them about there son that had passed away,1364688000,4,156,3.90625
1956842,4,B0000VV4HW,"This was a made for television movie, but I really enjoyed it. Very suspenseful and keeps you watching. Would recommend to family and friends",1360540800,,141,4.916666666666667
1956843,5,B0000VV4HW,"Stranger In the Family a 1991 TV movie starting Neil Patrick Harris.  Base on the true life story of Steve Thompson, a 16 year-old who seemed to have everything going for him until a car accident brings all to a halt.  The cover say.""He will never remember what they can never forget.""  That the problem he will never be the old Steve, he is trying to find the new Steve.  But his Mom and other do not want the new him but the old Steve.  This is a must see movie to help those we love to understand we not going to be just like befor our brain injuries, but we can have a a great life",1266710400,10,585,3.965811965811966

1956847,3,B0000VV4HW,"I liked the movie, although unbelievable in parts. Am I the only one, who thought the mother acted like a cruel tyrant?? Like, she seemed so uncaring for the 'new Steve' in parts. It actually made me mad.",1454025600,3,204,4.394736842105263
1956848,5,B0000VV4HW,"This is such a sad, heartbreaking story.

What makes it so sad is that it is all true.

You can all look it up. ""Steve Thompson Amnesia""

The movie does not show how bad it really was.

Steve never got his memory back, and everyone had to accept that the ""Old Steve"" was just gone.

The family suffered.

The mother had a nervous breakdown.

The sister attempted suicide twice.

Steve spent six months in a rehab center before he actually went home.

He could not walk or talk or feed himself or use the bathroom and he was like a baby.

It took him three years to do what the movie made it look like a few days.",1453161600,9,612,4.110169491525424

1956858,5,B0000VV4HW,"Dr. Doogie does a great job portraying someone dealing with serious problems of the mind and memory loss! It's a frightening thought to loose your identity,among other necessary knowledge and physical functions. Neil Patrick Harris,Teri Garr and the whole (family),cast deliver very emotional and touching performances. Well worth the watch. Leaves an individual with some things to contemplate! Thank you to the Thompson family for sharing their heartbreaking and bittersweet,(for lack of a better choice of words),life story about their dearly loved son,Steve.",1426032000,,562,5.783132530120482
1956859,5,B0000VV4HW,"Wow!  What a powerful and emotional movie.  Neil Patrick Harris played the character so well.  It really sheds some light on TBI (traumatic brain injury).  So easily overlooked.  I would recommend this movie to everyone.  What a devoted mother.  Even though she was trying to bring back the ""old"" Steve, she went above and beyond to reteach him the basics skills that one learns in elementary school.  I'm not a person that likes to sue for any old reason but the ER doctor was just ridiculous.  If a person can't walk out on their own, when there was ""nothing wrong"", that should have been a big 'ol red flag of SOMETHING being wrong.  if you can't get a doctor to listen when you know there is something wrong then go get a 2nd opinion, 3rd opinion, 4th opinion, etc...  My problem wasn't like Steve's but I suffered a heart attack at the age of 40.  If it wasn't for me to keep pushing that my chest hurt and the ER doctor needed to call my family doctor, I wouldn't be here today.  I was going to get released from the hospital but luckily I had a caring doctor that said ""shut up and listen to her"".  Later I was told that if I went home, I would have suffered a major heart attack and would not have been able to survive it.  If you know something is wrong, keep pushing and pushing and pushing.",1420070400,10,1301,4.274590163934426

1956864,4,B0000VV4HW,"I enjoyed this film. The acting was good, and the story line is still valid today.

The reactions depicted in the movie were so bizarre that I can only imagine that much has been left out and much was altered to neatly fit the story-telling format of a movie of this type.,1459123200,,332,4.203125
