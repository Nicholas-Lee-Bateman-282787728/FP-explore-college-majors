2630929,5,B000H7JCJQ,"Ahhh so now here is where JAG really got its start!!! The chemistry b/w David James Elliott and Catherine Bell was the BEST!! When CB came on the show, she was so awesome as Mac-- first off what a cool TV character name; she was tough, strong, smart, beautiful, kick-a@# marine who gave her ""flyboy"" (a nickname she had for Harm)a huge run for his money. But the partnership is what was so special to watch... You NEED to buy this DVD--VERY WORTH IT!! :) It is the beginning of what people became known as ""shippers"" being for Harm and Mac being together. Also the rest of the cast ROCKED-- Bud was hysterical and Admiral was very entertaining to watch! Semper Fi JAG SEASON 2!!! :)",1154304000,19,682,4.420634920634921

2630979,4,B000H7JCJQ,"I love this show and the only reason I have given this 4 stars is that the first episode of each disc is only able to be viewed with audio commentary from 2 of the cast members talking throughout the whole thing.  This includes while the show is running so you are unable to hear what is being said and not able to follow the story line completely.  Maybe there is a way to get around this but I have not been able to discover any as I am watching these on an external drive with my laptop with no access to television or standard DVD player.  It seems if you pay for episodes of a television show most people are doing so because they want to watch these shows, not miss out on 4 episodes because of audio commentary.",1436227200,2,718,4.114285714285714

2631001,5,B000H7JCJQ,I almost have the whole collection.  that should tell you what I think of the series.  The on going love story of Mac and Harm and the dangers they faced together made a terrific story.  Bud and Harriet helped to give the story a more real life thing as they fell in love and got married and had children.  For me it was 10 years of pure joy!,1420070400,,342,3.985294117647059

2631005,5,B000H7JCJQ,"Although I only caught the original airing of this show in its final few seasons, I watched the re-runs religiously in my teens. As such, more recently, my family and I have been picking up and watching JAG from the beginning, season by season. David James Elliott (Harm) and Catherine Bell (Mac) have fantastic chemistry, the supporting actors, such as Patrick Labyorteaux (Bud) and John Jackson (the Admiral) play their roles brilliantly, and the stories themselves are often well thought out, provoke thinking, especially in the more contentious episodes, and, most importantly, provide entertainment. This review is only for season two of JAG, but I could not speak more highly of one season over another. I've never been let down and I've always been excited to move onto the next season. JAG is a fantastic show that you and your family will enjoy.",1416700800,3,854,4.979020979020979

2631075,2,B000H7JCJQ,"This is the end, my friend.
This is the end, my Jaggy friend,
The end...

I bought this season because (a) it was cheap, and (b) I was interested to see how the Season 1 cliff-hanger was resolved. And my reaction to Episode 1 was - HUH? The cliff-hanger wasn't resolved. We went straight on as if nothing had happened, except that Meg, the delicious blonde Navy sidekick, was now replaced by Mac, the delicious brunette Marine sidekick and murdered Harm girlfriend lookalike, and we have a new comic element in the cherubic, slightly bumbling, but also slightly smart Lt. Roberts, met previously in Season 1 on a carrier. We also have a regular State Department type who moonlights for the CIA. Or is it the other way around?

So what happened? A bit of research revealed that the show had been dropped in its first season and that the last episode (the murder of the Mac lookalike) hadn't even been shown at the time. By the time it was picked up by a different network, Meg had vamoosed.

Two main things remain from the first season; the glossy, glamorous, perpetually well-laundered cast with all the answers, and the steadily increasing improbability of the stories, especially the fact that Navy lawyers get involved in so much action. The two first episodes were among the most ridiculous bits of television I've ever seen and stretched credulity far beyond my breaking point. The fourth episode actually got into a courtroom (finally!) and what happened there was even crazier. I shall not give any spoilers, but suffice to say that, in real life, Lt. Cdr. Rabb would probably have been hung from the yard arm, never mind cashiered. Mind you, it has to be said that the courtroom episodes (of which there were a few) were more realistic and (to me) more entertaining than the ""action"" episodes.

The episode, ""Trinity"", set in my native Northern Ireland during ""the Troubles"", was hilariously nonsensical - I especially enjoyed the often distinctly southern Irish accents of the RUC and the allegedly Belfast double-decker with ""Carnaby Street"" on the front! (That's one long bus ride). And I can't imagine any RUC inspector affording a steel/gold Rolex GMT-Master. (Lots of Rolex product placement by the way - Harm wears a Submariner, a Marine captain elsewhere has one of those steel/gold GMTs and Mac's looks like a lady Oyster Perpetual. Good taste!)

There were a few worthwhile episodes that addressed real issues in an interesting way (women in combat roles, homosexuality in the forces), but these were outnumbered by the cheesy/nonsensical ones.

Enough, no more! No matter that the military background is often interesting, no matter how handsome are the characters, no matter that they play their often staggeringly cheesy parts well, no matter the interest in the inevitable twists and turns of Harm and Mac clearly en route to true love, if the story lines are so staggeringly implausible, I can't watch it. Given the thing's success, the formula clearly has worked well, so clearly there are a lot of folk out there who can suspend disbelief much more than I can. But this is where I get off.

One thing the JAG series did do for me - it caused me to admire enormously the guys and gals who somehow manage to land big, heavy jet fighters on something that appears to be the size of a postage stamp, and which is going up and down the way postage stamps generally don't.

I truly believe if Harm had no dropped out it could have gone on for many more years.  Every character had a story of their own going on and yet you were able to follow the series without getting lost.  It was one of those stories that redefined human love many times over.

It is such a terrific series that I decided to buy the dvds to have on hand at my leisure; especially when I get bored or disappointed with other shows that fail miserably by comparison.  In my opinion this is a ""must have"" in the field of drama and excellent entertainment.  The stories are wonderfully written and perfectly cast with actors who know how to live up to the stories and capture your attention no matter how often you watch it.  My only regret is that I bought the seasons all in piece meal thinking I didn't really need them all since I had seen most of them.  But once I began watching them again, I wanted them ALL!  While each episode can stand on its own, it is really much more fun to watch the seasons in sequence in order to discover all of the interconnections you would miss otherwise. JAG is still worth the extra money I ended up paying for the separate seasons.  I guarantee you will also enjoy the series!

This series had lots of action, drama, some light comedy spots here and there and the development of the characters and the interplay made this a highly entertaining, especially between the admiral and his 2 star judge advocates. My husband and I watched this series from the beginning Season 1 which aired on NBC. The network opted not to renew JAG and so it switched to CBS after a short absence where it aired from season 2 to the end. I'm sure the NBC executives regret that decision! This was the series which would ultimately create another winning series spin-off,  NCIS which just completed it's 7 season and which now airs in JAGS old Tuesday night time slot also on CBS. This series gave the average viewer an inside look to some of the goings on in our military and the politics of the time. It also very tastefully worked into the story line the tragedy of the 9-11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon and our ongoing fight against the Taliban in Afghanistan and Al Queda.

The last episode from season 1 seemed to not continue at all in this season (but it does happen later; season 3 I believe).

2631122,5,B000H7JCJQ,"This is an EXCELLENT show; from seasons 1-10...

The following is my comment to a 2 star review for the 4th season; which I find an odd way to judge the series anyhow. Either you like it and watch all seasons possible, or you watch a couple of shows and you're done. This person doesn't seem worthy of writing the review if he started in the middle and watched a few episodes. I couldn't help but notice his HOBBY of writing so many reviews of everything.

I have to give HIGH HONOURS for this show; if only for others like myself who grew up constantly hearing of wars, had many relatives involved in many wars and services, and just took it as a part of life. This show, although glamorized, will change your perspective of what National Defense and patriotism mean...
............
I think you missed the whole POINT of the series; and couldn't possibly have watched the whole season, yet alone the full 10 years it ran, and come to the conclusion that you did. If so, you saw only what you wanted; ""Politically Correct storylines with purty people flirting or otherwise fooling around. Good entertainment after a fashion, but not my cup of tea.""

If this were true, I don't think the Navy and the Marines would have exposed themselves as much as they did. What JAG, the TV show did was show you, using actual scenarios from many different cases, much of the true heroism these men and women did and faced. Much was taken out of true files, as taught in one of the documentaries of Bellisario. As the show earned the respect from the ""real life"" Marines and Navy, they were invited to learn more about the actual protocols, happenings, receive real film footage, etc. This all began in Season 2 and continued through the complete series. I think the show has been a dedication to ALL those serving.

More important than the inner office workings (which seem to be what you noticed; this is a GOOD storyline if you follow it), is seeing how all the battle equipment looks & works, the ranks and roles of the people, protocols, etc. I have learned SO MUCH. This is real military footage; (and my husband backs up at least the Navy protocols/ rules, etc). There were also official Navy and Marine representatives on stage/scene/filming, making sure everything is as realistic as possible for the audience to follow.

Yes, it all seems to happen to this one, small, head of JAG unit, of dashing young men and women; but this IS a TV series and needs to keep the social dilemmas, histories, etc, ""where they all came from to where they strive to get themselves to""; that is necessary to discuss the real social problems that remain the undercurrents of these special ""grin and bear it"" personalities. As many of the court cases show, it is an opportunity to take something to the public that needs to be rethought. A large variety of actual ""truths"" come forward in an investigation, that may not have been foreseen initially. There is a lot of ""gray area"" in the court room which leaves the viewer with something to think about for a few days; not just in the JAG court room, but also how it applies into their own lives.

Many of us have our own jobs that risk lives and careers within split seconds, and work hard to get to that highest of perfection; where we know that those who are counting on us have a very good chance of finding 'our best moment' in there. There are many people and occupations that reach that high, but this show is the ONLY SHOW I know of that gives you an inner look, as realistic as it can be, to those people who choose these careers, with so much at stake. I have learned such GREAT RESPECT for ALL THOSE involved in our military. I think we heard so much about it while growing up, that we never understood the true dedication, heartaches and misfortunes.

This IS a much better series than you rated it.
Perhaps you should have stopped watching it once it wasn't for you...",1235952000,2,3904,4.5134370579915135
2631123,5,B000H7JCJQ,"If you're a JAG fan, season two sets the bar and kicks off the relationships between the core cast.  Halfway through the season the U.S. Navy became more involved further backing the military support for the show (started with the Marines at the end of season one) making the sets as well as the use of military equipment even cooler.

You'll also see a few actors' first appearances before signing on in later seasons as regulars, including a blond assassin (David James Elliott's wife) later cast to portray The Ice Queen Lt. Loren Singer and Harm's favorite reo. Lt. Elizabeth 'Skates' Hawkes who makes a rookie appearance in the same episode CAG Thomas Boone (Terry O'Quinn) comes under investigarion... the first time.

Season two is also crucial in the character development of both Bud Roberts and Harriet Sims.  Not to mention the first season with the unforgettable John M. Jackson as Adm. Albert Jethro 'A.J.' Chegwidden.

As I said before, if you're a JAG fan season two is a must have!",1235433600,,997,4.807017543859649

I love the immediate chemistry between them and the looks Harm gives her...my heart swoons.

The relationship between Mac and Harm, played by David James Elliot, is of equals and so much more interesting than when his partner was played by Tracy Needham, who was more like his kid sister. In this series you can see the groundwork for the future series which became so great. With the introduction of the Bud, Harriet and Admiral Chegwidden characters, all of whom are just right, it is like having all the right ingredients in a recipe.  The introduction of the court room scenes as well as more time spent at the Jag offices, serves as a balance to the tension in the adventure scenes and really allows us to get to know the characters.",1178928000,12,779,4.63768115942029

I am definately a JAG addict I just cannot get enough of it. If you like the navy and the law of the sea. This series is a must. The cast are brilliant and the stories great. I have just ordered from Amazon season 3.

JAG is family friendly, with a good mix of action, courtroom drama and humor.  It's also a show that you can watch over and over and not get tired of. There are so many little things that keep you guessing as to what comes next, and often a sudden plot twist that catches you off balance.

Top notch acting and original plots keep the fascination high throughout the show. But what makes JAG exceptional is the interaction between Rab(David James Elliott) and Sarah MacKenzie(Catherine Bell). The suspense of waiting for the next lapse in their purely professional behavior toward each other is  what makes the show so spectacular.

The set is well packaged with excellent graphics on the box, covers, and DVDs. The special features are limited, but interesting and fun.

The only reason I assigned 4 stars instead of 5 is because the DVDs do not have an option for selecting scences. Other than that, they hit a homerun with me.",1168300800,,468,4.367816091954023

2631166,4,B000H7JCJQ,"I am a huge fan of JAG and watched all ten seasons as they aired. Like most good tv series, what made it work so well for me was the chemistry of the cast. One can easily accept the dramatic licence used to constantly place the main characters into implausible and dangerous situations ala Captain James T. Kirk. Ultimately, JAG is about the relationship between Harm & Mac (partners, friends, romantics) which was exploited superbly over the show's 10 season run. Despite my concerns over the technical quality of the discs which I'll try to express below, these DVD sets are a must for true fans of the show.

My only disappointment is the quality of the video which raises some questions I simply can't answer. Having gone to HD a few years back, I was able to watch the final seasons in 16x9 widescreen and hi-definition on a 100"" screen. It was absolutely awesome. The JAG DVD's are in 4x3 aspect ratio with lots of motion artifacts. By way of comparison, Belisario's NCIS DVD's seem to have a much superior image quality. At first, I assumed this is due to technology advancements in the cameras used to shoot the episides and later seasons of JAG will look equally as good.

I have seen episodes of ""The Equalizer"" and ""Law & Order"" from the same or earlier time frame rebroadcast on HD channels. While not as good as the images on current over the air HD broadcasts, they appear to at least be shot in widescreen and ""upconverted."" I haven't seen dvd's of these shows as a comparison, but now wonder whether the early JAG seasons could at least be presented in 16x9. DVD's are scanned at 480i. Nevertheless, newer DVD players such as what I am utilizing seem to be able to get exceptional results upconverting. For some reason, the early JAG DVD's don't match up very well. Whether this is an issue with the telecine process or a comparison of apples to oranges, I simply can't say.",1168300800,2,1890,4.572271386430678

2631171,5,B000H7JCJQ,"From the first episode Harm and MAC have the chemistry that makes the show work.  While the second season apparently didn't run the number of episodes that I would consider a full season and I would have liked a little more explanation in the commentaries about why, everything about the DVD set will make it one of my favorites (until seasons 3 through 10 -- or were there 11 seasons -- come out).  If you aren't familiar with the plotline, Don Belisario and crew do a great job of bringing you up to date.  Get it with season one, since Kate re-appears from time to time and it would be nice to put her in context as Harm's original partner (although the pairing was short-lived).  If you aren't a Catherine Bell fan after say, the second episode, then there's something wrong somewhere.  Her character is the perfect match for Harm.",1168214400,,835,4.54

2631175,4,B000H7JCJQ,"i bought this DVD not because it was a great show. It had its moments, but for the most part i thought it was one of the most poorly written shows on TV.

but there are a lot of things i liked about this show. they had some of the best actors on TV. (including from season one) the cimenatography was one of the best on TV. it always had a movie feel to it. the music is incredibly memorable. it had one of the greatest music themes in TV history.they got the technical aspects right. down to the uniform code and the lingo both military and legal.

but what i never liked about the show was it was incredibly cliched. the storylines throughout the series were quite hard and even improbable to believe. except for harm and mac the characters never really grew and they constantly contradicted themselves in discussing their own histories. they had great actors but hardly no real scripts to match it. it is not that i find the characters hard to believe in. it just that they were on there so long that i just got used to them and how they were acting. i never really cared for them except for a few moments during the course of the series.

But i did believe in Harm and Mac. i understood and got the chemistry between the two. they were a team definetly - i bought it. it was like watching a good pitcher and catcher during a game. they will probably go down in history as one of the great partnerings in television.  but that is as far as it went. they had good chemistry. but not much else.

the series itself as a whole could have done much better. the potiential was there. but like i said, it was an incrediably cliched show that pandered to the 45 and up audience that presented itself as an in your face die-hard yeah military - i'm not going to rock the boat - show. it never ventured from that premise. it never told the same tired stories that they did from a different perspective. no real depth ever attempted, they will never be confused with Law & Order or MASH which are the best Miliatary and legal shows on tv. but i realized that was never the producers point.  so inspite of my criticisms. i still enjoyed the show. and the reason for me, at least, is simple. CATHERIME BELL!

from the time Catherine Bell was introduced it became - slowly but surely - her show. i think i'm not alone in that.  she is what made the show fun and worth coming back too. week after week. David James Elliot did a good job. but you can only do so much with that character. and that was exhausted really after the third season. Sarah Mackenzie was the same way. she really was just a female version of Harm. but that is what made Catherime so great. she brought herself to the role. her personality was in all over Mac. she is a woman that does not take herself too seriously and that is what she made mac become. that was really the only difference between Harm and Mac. one did not take themself too seriously. the other did very much. Catherine and Mac had a genuine sense of humor, i never got that from DJE and Harm. it was like he tried to hard to show he had one.

when DJE threatened to quit the show. i think it would have been a safe bet that the show would have survived nicely without him. as a matter of fact i think that was what there intentions were. to make the show about sarah. i think it would have been a little better even. but if CB had left. i don't know if it could have lasted too much longer.

but all that being said. i like the Second Season. i will reccommend it. i don't have the first season. i don't want it. to me Catherine Bell was the star of the show. the reason to watch it and the reason to own this DVD and the rest the show that is sure to come.",1163376000,8,3687,4.172995780590718

I admit that I stopped watching JAG at the end of the first season, but through a good friend of mine, I started watching season 2. The almost mystical relationship that develops between Harm and Mac is difficult to understand at first, but for those that watched the future episodes for the series, it laid it's ground rules in season 2. I think that all of us would agree that the chemistry between Harm and Mac is something that we all wish for, but we hope that it doesn't take 10 years to figure it all out. I have to say thank you to the makers of this DVD set. We the fans of JAG have waited a long time for these to become available to us, and I'm sure we all hope the the remaining seasons are soon to follow on DVD.

However, I'm rather angry at the producers for ending Season 1 with a cliffhanger (i.e. Harm has been arrested for murdering his ex-girl friend), then abandoning that storyline without resolving it.

Season 2 opens with a brand new episode, totally ignoring the unfinished final episode of the first season.

Season 2 showed great improvement over the first one due to a combination of better actors who play more extensive roles, a change in focus for the show, and seemingly greater logistical resources for Bellisario that translated into better television.

The Season of course continues its focus of Harmon Rabb (David James Elliot) but introduces Sarah McKenzie, played by the talented and beautiful Catherine Bell who, as some have alluded to, adds a romantic and sexual element to the show.  But past that, Bell's character simply trumps that of Lt JG Austin (Tracy Needham) with personality and character.  The fact that she's a Marine undoubtedly augments her role.

One could argue however that the show's change in focus was the saving grace.  Season 1 was action outside the courtroom.  Season 2 places the camera more inside the courtroom, depicting military law and illustrating just what it is JAG's have to do.  This was a brilliant move.  For one, it adds a level of realism to the show, as the audience no longer is left coming to terms with how a lawyer would end up so often in the trenches.  And second, the focus to courtroom drama contributes to the development of Harm's character and others.  It's like discovering a new favorite flavor.

There are other contributing elements--such as Bellisario being able to shoot scenes that aren't taken so much from Hollywood scenes--that make Season 2 and the following seasons great, but  JAG's improvement can mostly be traced to the above reasons.  The best part is Season 2 is only a taste of things to come; JAG's greatness has been embodied in the model Season 2 established and the following seasons carried on.",1156464000,11,1781,4.8349834983498345
2631180,5,B000H7JCJQ,"I can't really review this DVD per se since it isn't released yet, but I just want to thank the powers-that-be for putting Season 2 out so soon after Season 1 was released.  I am a huge JAG fan who still misses the show.  I really enjoyed the Harm and Mac relationship, but since I didn't start watching JAG until about half-way through Season 2, I am really looking forward to getting Season 2 to catch up on the earlier episodes.  I have Season 1 and I'm enjoying it immensely, but I won't be happy until they announce the release of the rest of the seasons.  And I'll buy them all,too!

TV was rarely ever better.  So, to the people who do the work of getting JAG onto DVD, I have one thing to say:  BRING 'EM ON - AND DON'T DILLY-DALLY!!!",1155772800,12,742,4.183098591549296
2631181,5,B000H7JCJQ,"YES! I am glad that they also publish the 2nd season so shortly after the first one, for the secnd season is where the series actually starts for me with the introduction of Sarah 'Mac' Mackenzie as Harm's third and final partner.

The only thing I am hoping for now is, that they will also publish the DVDs over here in Germany very soon. If the 1st season isn't at least announced here by November, I think I will go for the American DVD boxes.

I can recommend this series for all fans of action and military series (or movies).",1154908800,9,531,4.3

I recommend this series for anyone who appreciates a good clean drama with a little romance thrown in here and there. I fully intend to buy each one as they come available.

Diane Schonke, who was murdered in her car in a parking lot. Harm investigated this murder with his partner. It was known that Harm had a plutonic relationship with the murdered Lt. Schonke,(Catherine Bell) & Harm was arrested for her murder at the end of the episode.. Season 2 episode 1 should finish Harms'  arrest & how he gets off of the charge..Then HOW is Mac (Catherine Bell) introduced as an ""alive"" new character?--as ""Mac""..Sooo--Where is Episode 1 of Season2? the only place I found to bview it is to go to CBS-ALL ACCESS.- or to buy the entire Season2 from Amazon.
