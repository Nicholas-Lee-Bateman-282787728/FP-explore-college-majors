7900222,5,7880977511,Great film  if you are interested in Chinese history of the period. Unfortunatly it is the only set available with english subtitles. I wish I could finish the story.,1316476800,4,166,4.724137931034483
7900223,3,7880977511,"This series is a masterpiece and would be a great addition to any collection. But it has the most atrocious English subtitles. After having watched this online I was excited to see that it had finally come out. I was very disappointed. The subtitles are full of grammatical errors, spelling errors and crude English slang. It's obvious this was slapped together quickly for quick sale. Part of the beauty of Three Kingdoms is the poetic and dramatic language. Those responsible for the titles in this set have a very basic understanding of English at best. Watch it online first! If you understand Mandarin buy it today!!",1311206400,10,621,4.867924528301887
7900224,5,7880977511,"This is absolutely the best entertainment ever!  Been waiting for this to be out, and I want MORE!  This set has the firs 33 episodes, and YES it has ENGLISH SUBTITLES!  In the Main Menu go to: SETUP, and in Setup you can choose Simlified Charcters, Traditional Characters, and ENGLISH as a Subtitle option.  When you choose it is KEY to hit RESUME or the subtitle might not work and you have to do the whole selection process again.

I have a DVD player where I can switch between languages with the push of a button, both sound and Subtitles.

This set is a good starter set.  PLEASE have the rest of the series available with ENGLISH SUBTITLES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!",1308182400,9,667,4.418032786885246
