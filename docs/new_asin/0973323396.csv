7794552,5,0973323396,"I loved this movie about ""alottments,"" in Britain, which are basically, in my own simplified terms, community gardens. A central story with multiple sub stories, some related to the main one, some not, but all interesting. With the derth of garden or garden themed movies available, for gardeners like me, desperate to watch anything garden related during the cold snowy winter months, this was a lovely little treat.",1453593600,,417,5.147058823529412

7794555,3,0973323396,"This British 'Dramedy' has all the bits and pieces you want; great acting, an interesting and involving plot, and great sets and scenery. Unfortunately it feels as if the individual bits aren't sewn together well enough, and it gives the film a somewhat disjointed feeling at times. The film also lacks some of that whimsical, slightly detached-from-reality feel that great British dramedies do so well. In the end, it's the quality of the acting that makes me recommend this film, as there are just so many fine performances from the cast. Enjoy each tile, and you'll hardly notice that the mosaic has some cracks.",1399507200,,615,4.923076923076923
7794556,5,0973323396,"Cam Mather is a quirky Canadian with a lot of excellent advice on vegetable gardening. You'll get to like his warm, folksy style as he moves you from start to finish in gardening advice and folklore. Some good suggestions on appropriate technology also. Don't miss it!",1384732800,3,268,4.8478260869565215
7794557,4,0973323396,"A very good funky production of extensive vegetable gardening.  While Mr. Mather's project is in Eastern Ontario, the basics apply all over North America.  Production values are funky, like a counter-culture course on limited budget.  Nothing quite like it however, and it'll make a good addition to your edutainment library.  Recommended.",1361836800,4,339,5.588235294117647
