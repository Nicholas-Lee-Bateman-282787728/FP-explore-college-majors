And I have seen this movie many years ago whIle in Europe and it is awesome!",1493164800,,192,3.707317073170732
8567226,1,B00BEK8LBK,"I was unaware when purchasing that there are no subtitles on these discs! They are all in French with NO subtitles. I think the seller and/or Amazon should have taken a moment to add this important information to their minimal description, especially for DVDs sold in the United States! I returned the item once I was able to read the box and see there were no subtitles and Amazon charged a restocking fee of $25.00, half of what I paid.",1410307200,10,438,4.4875
