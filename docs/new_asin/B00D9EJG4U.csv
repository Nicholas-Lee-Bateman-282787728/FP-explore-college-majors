8590884,4,B00D9EJG4U,Good movies but mainly formulaic - still worth getting for your library.,1429833600,,72,5.083333333333333
8590885,3,B00D9EJG4U,"No battalion to speak of,  as the action revolves around a lone T41 Walker Bulldog and it's crew.  Combat and maneuver footage is ""seen"" through the viewports of the Hollywood set tank interior.  Crew experiences mechanical failure and returns to base for repairs.  After melodrama involving girlfriends, and an attack by guerillas, they return to the front lines and receive battle damage.  Two guys go for help.  Film ends abruptly as it began.  Very low budget with simple sets, few actors and few locations.  Only of interest if you want to see the M41 running around by itself.",1423958400,,582,4.86734693877551
8590886,2,B00D9EJG4U,"The image quality is OK on all of the titles but GO FOR BROKE. Why this was included when this company has plenty of AIP war films to choose from is a mystery. None of these movies are worthwhile, except for TANK BATTALION which is so inept it's funny if you're in the right frame of mind. Otherwise, forget it.",1409529600,,311,4.2
8590887,4,B00D9EJG4U,Four really bad (but enjoyable) movies at one great price. What more can I say?,1409443200,,79,4.333333333333333
8590888,5,B00D9EJG4U,"If you are a fan of this type of this type of low budget movie of any type, you will really find these quite entertaining!",1396569600,,122,3.92
8590889,4,B00D9EJG4U,another great 4 film set from shout factory good action pack go for broke poor copy but 3 out of 4 not bad keep them coming,1382486400,4,123,3.769230769230769
8590890,4,B00D9EJG4U,"Although none of these are great movies, it is nice to have the three which have never been available before. I was surprised to discover that both Tank Battalion and Lost Battalion are anamorphic widescreen, although the box says they are full screen presentations. Hell Raiders has surprisingly good color for a Larry Buchanan movie. If you have seen any of his other films which are out on DVD you will know what I mean. Go For Broke is a poor quality dupe transfer and looks as bad as the other PD DVDs of this title that are out there. Too bad they didn't include another American International war film instead.",1380585600,10,617,4.5675675675675675
