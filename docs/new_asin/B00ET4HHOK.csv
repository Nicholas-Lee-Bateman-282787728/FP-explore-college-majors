8609194,5,B00ET4HHOK,Saw it on a flight from London to LAX yesterday.  A very entertaining movie and apparently based on a true story.  The ending credits provided some background on the principal real-life people involved.  Thought I could purchase on Amazon but it is not offered for the USA region DVD players.  Bummer!,1388534400,,301,4.8431372549019605
