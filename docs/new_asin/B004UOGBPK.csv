Thus giving the impression that this is an historical battle a thon, well it aint. He does fire one shot from said crossbow, but misses the water melon and later there is some sword play but no battles here at all, so shame on the marketers. It was called 'The Outlaw in the UK, with an even more misleading cover, so this is not as bad.

What it is though is a film `based' on a chapter in the life of Spain's most prolific playwright, Lope de Vega. He was in the Spanish navy and fought for the recapture of the Azores. The film picks up just after that when he returns to Madrid to take up his playwriting career. He is taken on by a play promoter and being the silver tongued devil that he is, he immediately falls for his daughter. This is Elena Osorio. They start a passionate but secretive affair as she is already wed, but hubby has been off some place for years and she will not refute the marriage. In a bid to get her to change her mind, he publicly exposes her and is sued for slander. Which was taken a tad more seriously in those days than it is now.

This results in him being forced into exile, but he takes a young sixteen year old with him - Isabel de Urbina. That is the basic synopsis and actually quite accurately follows that part of Lopes life. His real story would have made a much better film, for instance he was in the Spanish Armada that attacked England and was one of the few ships that made it back, he wrote over 1,800 plays and oodles more besides.

Where the film does score high is in the attention to period detail and high production values, but this is really a story of passion, love and writing plays, not a war type film at all. Still I really quite enjoyed it despite the above. It is in Spanish with good sub titles and has a run time of 105 minutes. It is both stylish and passionate but will not be to everybody's tastes, but I love European cinema, so was not disappointed, despite the lack of serious action.",1324857600,8,2115,4.204433497536946
