8739689,2,B017LJFRV4,"I had gotten away from yoga for a few years I thought this would be a good video to get me started again. Where is the yoga? I watched over a third of this video I have yet to see any yoga. It is tai chi and stretching with a lot of babble. Come on ""talk like Robin Williams in Mrs. Doubtfire"". Cannot say I have heard that in a yoga class.  I thought watching Scott would get me back into the swing of things, but as the saying goes and holds true here ""Looks aren't everything.""

The best video I have found is INTEGRAL YOGA HATHA with Sri Swami Satchidananda. Try that one",1505260800,2,575,4.035087719298246

8739692,4,B017LJFRV4,"This beginner yoga dvd workout was just what we were looking for.  It is really gentle stretching yoga  moves more than a yoga ""workout"", which we were glad of.  We had never done yoga before, and were really just looking for some a stretching moves as we have noticed a loss of flexibility and agility.  Scott Cole has a pleasant manner and soothing voice.",1501372800,2,357,4.53125
8739693,5,B017LJFRV4,"Scott Cole makes Yoga fun. He instructs with confidence along with humor. Anyone can do this video, I'm 63 not very flexible but I do what I can and feel good after the workout.",1490140800,,177,4.235294117647059
8739694,5,B017LJFRV4,I love this video! It stretches your upper and lower body. There are two segments. I am mid 40's and have had muscle and nerve issues that have made it painful to even move. This is what he promotes- gentle. He is encouraging unlike some other videos and doesn't discourage you. He encourages everyone to do at their own pace. I also have knee issues and many videos aggravate my knees. Doing at my own pace this video does not make my knees worse! LOVE IT!,1489795200,2,457,4.325581395348837
8739695,5,B017LJFRV4,"This is a fantastic stretch video! Sometimes after a long day and a hot shower, a good stretch is just what I need! I love Scott's calming voice and demeanor! I'm 54 and in decent shape but not super flexible! This DVD is very doable and I feel really good after using it! It's not necessarily Yoga but great for a relaxing stretch! Thanks Scott!",1472256000,,346,4.338461538461538

8739697,1,B017LJFRV4,"This video consists of two sections.  The main section is broken up into standing and seated stretches, and a bonus section with partnered stretches.  The main section lasts for 33 minutes.  I did not do or watch the partnered stretch.

My main beef with this video is that it bills itself as a yoga video, and only about half (perhaps even less) of what is presented is recognizable as yoga.  I have been doing yoga off and on for 20 years and was looking for a non-rigorous way to get some active recovery on my off days.  This is in-between running to train for a marathon, aerobics, and weight training.  For the purpose of active recovery, this is a barely passable video, but if one is a total beginner looking to learn about yoga (which is the market this video is supposedly aiming for), this is definitely not recommended.

Throughout the video, the instructor constantly talks about tai chi moves, and even early on pitches his other videos on exactly that type of workout.  The flow moves are also more tai chi, rather than yoga inspired.  He tells the viewer to ""breathe"", but doesn't exactly explain what that means or how to do it.  IMO, breathing (ujjayi) is a key element that should be reviewed and emphasized in a beginner video.  Further, although he correctly identifies some of the poses, such as ""child's pose"", he typically either never identifies the yoga pose he is doing, or he calls it something else.  When he demonstrates what is ""bound angular pose"", he mistakenly calls it ""diamond pose"".  Bound angular and diamond are actually two entirely different poses in yoga.

For what is billed as a beginner video, this is also seriously lacking in form pointers and instruction.  Instead, there is a plethora of commentary that will only get more annoying over time as one repeatedly watches this video. For example, during chair pose, the instructor says that instead of keeping the palms facing inward as one would normally do for this pose, he tells you to cup them open, as if ""holding a bowl of organic food"".  He makes this lame joke twice, and never explains why he is modifying the pose with his own variation.  He even jokes that it's OK to laugh at his bad jokes.  At another point, he exclaims that he is going to play one of his favorite games called ""find the neck"", and proceeds to walk around to the other exercisers, presumably to adjust their form and alignment.  He does this twice, but never explains exactly what it means to ""find the neck"" so that the viewer at home can do this as well.  It would have been nice to have the camera zoom in on him showing how he is adjusting the alignment, along with a verbal explanation of what it is supposed to feel and look like.  Finally, his mirror cueing is off, and he even acknowledges that even though he calls out his left side, he means the right side on you and to just follow the moves like a mirror.  In this day and age of fitness video making, workout videos should simply not have mistakes in mirror cueing like this.

This video would be much better labeled if it simply did not mention yoga at all.  A better title would be ""Gentle dynamic stretch"" or some such, so as not to mislead the buyer into thinking that this is a beginner's yoga video where one will learn some basic yoga.

A general breakdown of the main workout is as follows.  The seated section of this video is more reminiscent of yoga than is the standing. 1) Standing section:  Starts with what the instructor calls qigong inspired moves consisting of shaking your body around, tapping your body with your hands. Move onto modified chair pose, modified back bends, and side stretches for each side of the body. Proceed to what the instructor calls ""monkey bear"" move, which he says is qigong-inspired.  He says he made that one up himself, which is really just moving side-to-side.  More dynamic side stretches, modified dynamic front and back bends.  Some plies with tai-chi inspired wrist stretches.  2)  Seated section:  Start seated in cross-legged position, swaying like a ""tree in the breeze"".  Moving on to hamstring stretches, spinal twists, seated forward bends one leg at a time, some hip opening stretches, modified bow pose, bound angular pose (which he mistakenly calls diamond pose) for the inner thighs, some cat stretches, and finishing off with child's pose.

In sum, this video is OK if you want some easy flow-ey movement and a little bit of stretching, but IMO there are better videos out there for that.  I definitely do NOT recommend it if one is a beginner wanting to learn some yoga.  It seems to me that this instructor, who is known for tai chi, wanted to cash-in on the current popularity of yoga by putting a few stretches in between his tai chi moves and slapping the word ""yoga"" in the video title.",1458345600,7,4795,4.624113475177305
