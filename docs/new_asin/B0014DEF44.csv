8255302,5,B0014DEF44,"Watching these videos was, for me, a spiritual and almost religious experience. No written description or static photos can compare to the sight of a human being taken apart, functional organ after the another, with full graphical details accompanied by a calm and confident explanation. You see skin, layers of fat, muscles, blood vessels, internal organs, bones -- how everything is laid out in a normal, healthy body, how everything is connected, the intestines stretched out to their full length, fingers poking into various valves in the heart. The skull, the brain. What fat looks like. How the eye passes information to the brain. The digestive system. The entire wonder of the human body brought out into the open and explained.

These are not easy videos to watch. Some people might find them repulsive. But I feel that I came a lot closer to understanding some really basic facts about the human body with a clarity that no written description could convey.  To me, this is an entirely respectable, serious and serene celebration of curiosity and rationality. If the human body interests you, then come and join this journey led by two anatomists, into the human body.",1208908800,7,1178,4.974619289340102
