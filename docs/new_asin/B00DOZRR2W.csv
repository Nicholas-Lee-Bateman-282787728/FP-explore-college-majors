1. The Christmas Castle
2. The Snow Dragon
3. Santa's Little Helper
4. The Sneezing Reindeer

5839443,3,B00DOZRR2W,"For those wondering about the price difference between this and some of the other Mike the Knight titles of similar length; this is actually a compilation of several Christmas-themed episodes of Mike the Knight.  It is not a feature-length film.  That said, anyone familiar with Mike the Knight knows about what to expect.  My 3 year old enjoys watching this show.",1419033600,2,364,4.934426229508197

5839448,5,B00DOZRR2W,"Wow this month is just flying by, hard to believe Christmas is right around the corner. I have been running around like crazy over here. But I wanted to get my review in for Mike the Knight: Mike's Christmas Surprise!

As an NSider I get to review a movie each month and this month we went with Mike the Knight"" Mike's Christmas Surprise! I have to say I really liked that this was an actual Christmas movie and not just one that at first look seems to be. This time of year a lot of movies have covers that make it look like a holiday movie but it might have an episode that has snow in it and then that is it. Since we don't have snow here yet it hasn't felt much like the holidays. So I was hoping for something that would help get us in the mood here and this movie does just that. I love that this whole dvd has a fun holiday feel to it as well as teaches my son some good lessons.

This Mike the Knight movie says it runs 57 minutes and there are 4 episodes. But there is also a bonus episode in the special feature section too. So between them all you can find a few minutes to sneak away to wrap some gifts. ;) The first episode is the holiday special ""The Christmas Castle"" in this one the family gets trapped in a board game and they all have to work together to get out in time for Christmas. Next you have ""The Snow Dragon"" where Mike helps Squirt to enjoy the snow. In ""Santa's Little Helper"" Mike thinks he isn't on Santa's nice list and tries to help Santa  so that he can get on it. Then you have ""The Sneezing Reindeer"" where one of Santa's reindeer is sick and Mike helps him get better in time for their Christmas ride. But that's not all, don't forget you still have a bonus episode. In ""The Great Protector"" Mike tries to protect Evie but ends up get's Mr Cuddles into some trouble instead.

Me and my son really like this whole dvd. He loves the watching Mike and I love that not only are they cute episodes but they all teach him some important lessons. I would definitely recommend this dvd to others. Also even though Mike is the main character his sister Evie is always around so it's not just for boys. Plus I love that there is no violence ever. Just a sweet little knight doing knightly things.",1387152000,2,2223,4.150812064965197
5839449,5,B00DOZRR2W,"Mike the Knight Mike's Christmas Surprise is by far one of the cutest dvd's we own.  If you have a little knight (or princess) who loves the Mike the Knight series, I would definitely recommend getting this dvd for them.

The DVD features :

1. The Christmas Castle
2. The Snow Dragon
3. Santa's Little Helper
4. The Sneezing Reindeer
5. The Great Protector (Bonus Episode)

The main episode on the dvd is the Holiday Special: The Christmas Castle.
It is December 24th and the whole town of Glendragon is preparing for Christmas Day! Mike's dad returns home and the only thing Mike wants to do is go on a quest with his father.  The King (Mike's Dad), instead has an idea that the family should play a Christmas board game.  Evie (Mike's sister) tries to cast a spell to make the counters look like the players, but something goes wrong and she accidentally shrinks her family into the game.  The family has to work together to get through the game and get back to their 'normal' size. While going through the game, Mike realizes that his wish for a mission ended up coming true!",1386028800,7,1206,4.576744186046511
5839450,5,B00DOZRR2W,We love Mike the Knight and this Christmas movie is no different. Cute movie and my 4 year old son has already watched it over and over again.,1385856000,4,142,4.107142857142857
5839451,5,B00DOZRR2W,"Can we watch it again mama. I think I have heard this EVERY time the four episodes on this disk end- ever since the first time we watched it. At this point- I believe it has been watched at LEAST 20 times,  and it would be more if she had her choice. Her absolute favorite episode is the one about the Reindeer with a cold- mainly because she is fascinated by Santa, and he is in this episode the most out of the four.  Plus, she LOVES to sing the reindeer lullaby and has taken to singing it randomly throughout the day. Mike teaches great lessons, especially as we are nearing the holidays. It is wonderful that Mike reminds us that family is the most important part of the holiday season, and that helping others and making a fun holiday for friends can be even more rewarding than the presents you get yourself.  Invaluable lessons taught in a simple, fun way. This movie will be watched throughout the year I am sure, and will be a holiday favorite for many years.",1385337600,2,969,4.342541436464089
5839452,5,B00DOZRR2W,"Huzzah! Just in time for the holiday season comes this adorable DVD featuring a never before seen Christmas Special!  My 4 year old LOVED this DVD and the adorable antics of Mike and Evie.  Our favorite episode was the episode where the family played the game and had to work together to undo a spell gone awry.  This is a great DVD for children ages 3-7.  It teaches good morals, cooperation, and the importance of family and friends.  We love Mike and this DVD is a new Christmas favorite in our home!",1384300800,2,503,4.423913043478261

Mom and Dad probably doesn't think that it's such a good idea though!  LOL.

8595583,5,B00DOZRR2W,This DVD is wonderful we had given it our son for a Christmas present and it is still one of the most requested movies we own. He loves that there is snow and Santa Claus in the some of the episodes. It contains 4 wintery fun filled adventurous episodes even after as many times its been watched here I find I still don't mind watching it with him. It's nice that Mike always learns a lesson in the episodes great for toddlers.,1435449600,,427,4.219512195121951
