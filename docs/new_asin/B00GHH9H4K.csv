8623093,1,B00GHH9H4K,"Buyer Beware!!! This has nothing on it that says it has except for Roundabout and Owner of a Lonely Heart. The songs listings are all false in front. Makes it look like the live concert they did in 1994 in South America. DVD has video from the Lost Broadcasts, 9012live and other sources. Quality is CRAP. The CD is just a"" best of""someone put together.",1490486400,2,353,4.446153846153846

8623095,1,B00GHH9H4K,"The Yes collector (umm, yeah, that's me) will want to have this disk on the shelf but the casual fan should be aware it is a disappointing ripoff. The first several cuts are terrible black and white dubs of (maybe BBC?) television appearances from the days of The Yes Album. The performance is spirited but uninspired. The only redeeming value of this disk is to discover that, even 40 years ago, Jon Anderson awkwardly fills gaps between songs with stumbling patter. The audio and video quality is a joke. ""Lonely Heart"" is in color but is a bad dub ripped from a live Union-era performance (mullets all around) that you've already got in better quality on another DVD.

Like the audio CD Yes Live On The Air, this appears to be a deliberate attempt to sell pirated and unauthorized archive material to gullible consumers and fans. Do not buy this disk expecting to receive cool and fun Yes performances.",1400025600,3,905,4.6918238993710695
8623096,1,B00GHH9H4K,"Love their music, But Packaging is a fooler on this one. Not Clean and Not worth it! Sorry, YES Fans.",1396396800,7,101,4.1
8623097,2,B00GHH9H4K,"The front cover pictured and the songs mentioned there are not the same as on the actual item received. If you look at the customer image of the back of the package, you will see the actual track list. The tracks listed on the false front would make it seem that this is from the Talk tour in 1994. However, the actual content is the same as the previously released Voiceprint compilation The Lost Broadcasts (1969-71), with added songs ""Owner"" from 9012Live and ""Soon"" from Live at QPR. Disappointing at best. Buyer beware.",1393977600,15,524,4.645161290322581
8623098,2,B00GHH9H4K,Roundabout is misspelled on the package as Rundabout.  What that tells me is this is a cheaply produced package.  I'll let someone else be the judge of the personnel in the band and the performance.,1392508800,3,198,4.628571428571429
