8259779,5,B0015SVNXY,"Once again in this three DVD set of classic ""Good Eats"" episodes Alton Brown dishes up delicious food with interesting lessons from history, chemistry, and other subjects you probably hated in high school. Obviously the theme here is fish, beef, and vegetables, but you know it won't be ordinaryand it's not. Let me say right off the bat that ""Tastes From the Sea"" was my least favorite disc of the set as I am very picky about seafood and absolutely loathe oysters. Interestingly in the extras, Alton reveals that the show on oysters, ""Shell Game"", was the only ""Good Eats"" episode where he didn't eat the food that was prepared (you'll notice if you look for it) as he has violent physical reactions to oysters requiring hospitalization. I don't have that issue, but every time I have tried oysters I have been revolted and now they are permanently on my do not eat list. ""Shell Game IV"" on scallops was a quite amusing episode, especially if you ever wanted to see Alton be a browbeaten cook on a fishing boat.

The other two DVDs, ""Garden Greats"" and ""Prime Meats"" are excellent in every way. I was especially taken with ""Beet It"" as I try to eat beets for their nutritional goodness, but admit to not especially loving them (try the Beet Green Gratin.) ""Prime Meats"" is all about beef, and all I will say is that if you are a fan of hooved ungulate flesh, you will adore this DVD. I particularly recommend Alton's preparation of Steak au Poivre.

I have been a ""Good Eats"" fan since the very beginning and this DVD set is another in a long line of excellent educational, inspirational, and just plain fun installments to spring from Alton Brown's fevered imagination.",1432512000,,1672,4.64527027027027
