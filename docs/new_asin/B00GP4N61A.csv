8626004,2,B00GP4N61A,"Very disappointed in this DVD The narrator spends a large amount of the video putting down other airbrush artists videos. His time would have been better spent describing the types of airbrushes and compressors he uses, paint viscosity etc. While I'm sure there are other DVDs and companies that rip people off you don't need to hear it said more than once and certainly not repeated time after time on a DVD about airbrushing flames.",1455148800,,434,4.8
