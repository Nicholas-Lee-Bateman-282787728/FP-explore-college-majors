when they were forced to leave their home land due to Hitler's occupation. The DVD arrived in perfect condition. The juxtaposition of
survivors' interviews with historical footage/flashbacks of the era was especially informative and had a great impact on me.",1465344000,6,395,5.711864406779661

7713196,5,B01DJQ7GKI,"Karen Thomas 2009 documentary Cinemas Exiles is mandatory viewing for any film buff. She tells the story of how hundreds of (mostly Jewish) film makers fled Germany beginning in 1930 and how they helped shape the emerging American cinema.

Her choice of the subjects to single out for attention is broadly based, including producer Erich Pommer, composers Erich Wolfgang Korngold and Franz Waxman, directors Fritz Land, Billy Wilder, and Ernst Lubitsch, actors Peter Lorre, Marlene Dietrich, Hedy Lamarr, and S.Z.Sakall, cinematographer Rudi Fehr, writer Curt Siodmak, etc.",1463961600,7,573,5.586206896551724

8756079,5,B01DJQ7GKI,"This DVD is  incredibly interesting historically, documented with old film that is fascinating, and gives a human soul to the many, many Jews in the German film industry of the '20s and '30s who were forced to flee when the Nazi's seized power.  Their stories are each different, and yet they are mostly all the same -- with the exception that some were able to become successful in the US while others never successfully made the transition.

Many probably think that Germany did not become terrifyingly dangerous until after 1937ish, but this film shows how targeted and stark a situation the Jews had to confront beginning in the early '30s.  The small clips of some genius films that I had never heard of, plus ones that have become timeless classics (e.g., Casablanca, High Noon, Maltese Falcon, and others by Billy Wilder) make the film glitter with an insight into the hearts of these immigrants -- translating their experiences into modern, American stories of character and heart.

Spending two hours with this film is a fulfilling investment of time and attention.  You will remember it for a long time.",1476489600,3,1113,4.8936170212765955
8756080,5,B01DJQ7GKI,"Fascinating look at how Hollywood was influenced by the German film community who emigrated to America during the Hitler era.  Heartbreaking to see some major European stars, writers and directors not be able to make the transition, but interested to see the impact those who did made on the industry, especially horror and film noir.  Nice section on the composers as well.  Signorney Weaver does an excellent job as narrator.",1471564800,3,427,5.071428571428571
