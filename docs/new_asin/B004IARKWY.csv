4385605,3,B004IARKWY,"I remembered this little romance from its original airing and was thrilled to see it available on DVD.  Of course, nothing is as shiny as memory - I don't fault it at all for not being quite as wonderful as I remembered it.  It was great seeing Jan Michael Vincent young, healthy and especially sober (or before he lost his glow due to substance abuse).  I've always admired Bonnie Bedelia starting with They Shoot Horses to her current part in Parenthood.  (Too bad whoever put together this DVD couldn't even bother to spell her name right on the cover.) The picture quality was a bit fuzzy - it looked like it had been copied from a second or third generation VHS tape. No extras, no cleanup of the picture.  Mainly recommended for collectors of the works of one of the two stars or for folks with nostalgia for a TV movie seen as a teen.",1273708800,12,841,4.4
8430525,1,B004IARKWY,This wonderful love story is all but ruined by the awful recording on this DVD.  Don't bother.  I like this story but the movie is so low quality it is painful to watch.,1395014400,,169,4.090909090909091
8430526,1,B004IARKWY,This dvd movie of Sandcastles was of very poor quality. Bad sound and picture. I was very disappointed in it as I remember the movie being awesome as a young teen.,1346284800,,163,4.290322580645161
8430527,5,B004IARKWY,"In the summer of 1975, I saw this movie televised.  I was awe-struck-- he manifests the ideal woman for himself and she, the ideal man and of the power of a love so great that it transcends time and space, life and death.  Each of the actors wonderfully portrays their characters and the storyline left me on the edge of my seat! The story is everyone's wish to have a love of their own.  The photography is wonderful.  Sine 1975, I have searched, asked and wondered how I could ever see the movie again, much less obtain a copy of it either VHS or DVD.  It was never listed in their characters' resumes or even in any media catalog.  FINALLY-- after almost 37 years-- I am able to relive this story and the wonder I first experienced when I first saw the movie since I have a copy of my own.  Actually, I bought two!!!-- so that if the first wears out I have another!! I highly recommend this movie to anyone who imagines the power and purpose of love to uplift, liberate, transcend and connect one human being to another-- it delivers a sense of hope and the integrity of love  that our world so desperately cries out for today.  See it, Buy it, Give it as a gift!",1338163200,6,1166,4.263636363636364
8430528,5,B004IARKWY,I decided to comment here with a 5-star rating since none of the 1-star reviews had anything to do with the movie itself. I cannot believe the number of people who do this on Amazon. REVIEW THE PRODUCT ITSELF - not your experience with the purchasing or packaging of such. I'm just saying....,1338076800,3,292,4.528301886792453
8430529,4,B004IARKWY,This movie was just as I remembered it as a teenager. I loved it just as much then as now.,1311465600,2,90,3.55

8430531,1,B004IARKWY,"I Love the movie but the copy is so bad I can't even watch it. It cuts in and out.
They shouldn't be selling these bad copies.
Beware buying from AMAZON.",1301356800,3,153,3.967741935483871
8430532,2,B004IARKWY,"I would purchase this exceptional TV-movie, but unfortunately the quality of the video to film transfer is quite poor.  Also the aspect ratio of the original video broadcast was 4:3, and has been incorrectly stretched to a 16:9 wide screen.  This is the second release for this movie and they still can't it get it right.",1299456000,8,321,4.714285714285714
8430533,1,B004IARKWY,"I have been trying for years to find this video. I found it on amazon.com and was so excited to get it.  But, within 5 minutes of
watching the video, I was so disappointed. The quality was horrible and in some night scenes, you can barely see what is going on.  I immediately went back on amazon and tried to return it for a better copy.  You cannot return it.  I ended up watching the whole thing.  But, what was a fond memory ended up being such a disappointment.  And the price was too much!  If you are thinking about getting this video don't do it.  I wished I would have read the reviews first.",1291507200,10,600,4.156521739130435
