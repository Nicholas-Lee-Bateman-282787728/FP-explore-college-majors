8452767,4,B0051ID2WO,"Very good story! A hidden treasure to some. I consider Species 1 & 2 underrated sci-fi gems.

This is the story of an alien/human hybrid. I consider one of a kind that I can't say I have witnessed any similar stories/films out there, original!

Species 1 : The beginning of this story and the best of these 3 films. Great cast! Art designs created by the terrific H.R.Giger. Certainly some great science fiction/horror that fans of this style respect. I know I consider the first 2 films classics, no doubt.

Species 2 : A strong continuance of this story presented very good with mostly the same cast. Maybe part 2 has more gore?! Nearly as good as the 1st film. Good stuff!

Species 3 : Worth one view, then never bother to watch it again. It's OK just barely tho, oh well. I considered part 3 to be just an added extra when I purchased this trilogy. Different cast, weak purpose. Seems like the producers were a little greedy perhaps, narrow minded.

Certainly a strong recommendation to buy this trilogy! All fans if sci-fi should like this, horror fans also.",1425772800,,1063,4.573684210526316
