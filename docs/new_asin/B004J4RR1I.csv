8431589,1,B004J4RR1I,THE SOUND QUALITY WAS VERY POOR. TURNING UP THE VOLUME ONLY MADE THE HUMMING LOUDER. I WAS TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED IN THE EFFORT PUT FORTH BY THE PRODUCERS OF THIS VIDEO. I COULDN'T MAKE IT THROUGH A COMPLETE VIEWING AND TOSSED THE DISC IN THE TRASH. THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE HOLOCAUST AND THE COMPOUND AT DACHAU DESERVES MUCH MORE EFFORT THAN THIS. THE NARRATOR WAS BARELY AUDIBLE ON MY COPY. JERRY W IN TX.,1305676800,4,406,4.5
