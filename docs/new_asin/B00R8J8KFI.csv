6906561,3,B00R8J8KFI,"I watched all the films (four of them) on Amazon Instant, but it is here where you can purchase all of them as DVDs, so I felt a review regarding all four films would be most appropriate here. Right away my position is this: I find the films to be 95% accurate, very inspiring, and an excellent resource for laypeople; however, as an instructional or informative guide to the more experienced, these films are disappointing. I'm writing this review because it's important that the less experienced be aware of the films' deceptions. It's really the last film that is the Achilles heel of the package, but I'll elaborate to support my position.

First, the films are heavily laden with Eastern esotericism, primarily Buddhist tenets. Western Mystery teachings are barely considered, which is what makes the films themselves imbalanced. I admit that a great deal of Eastern thought is in Western mysticism, but there's a reason why one is Western and the other is Eastern that goes beyond geography. Practical applications for the ancient wisdom, especially when it comes to spiritual technology, are largely dismissed or simply glossed over. As a result, there's a tremendous focus on natural transmutation and barely a footnote regarding the electrical similarities between modern engineering and the human body, which would open the doorway for a reconsideration of the magic-science of the priest kings of ancient times. This is what Western esotericism offers, and without it the entire premise of the films becomes extremely short-sighted.

Second, there's at least twice in the films a discussion of dark matter, even a comparison between dark matter and human anatomy. Because the films are so focused on Eastern cosmologies, they fail to point out what their comparison actually reveals: commonalities between cosmic energy systems (call them the macrocosm) and the human body (call it the microcosm). As above, so below. However, dark matter is based on a faulty assumption about gravity and its effects on space-time. Science will never find dark matter as science currently understands it anymore than a hike in the nearest forest will grant its sojourner a glimpse of a unicorn. An electrical model is needed, one based on mass and frequencies; thus, gravity plays a role, but is not the key to a unifying theory (and by this I mean a theory that is truly unifying for all levels of inquisition).

Third, the last film, the fourth one, is hypocritical. I say this because it emphasizes the importance of passive acceptance, even in the face of great adversity. Simply accept the world as it is, it mentions, and the world will change. Well, if that were true, then these films would be unnecessary. Instead, these films were created to educate because someone felt more needed to know. That's action and an attempt to change what is and not a passive acceptance of what is already there. But Eastern philosophy, especially Zen Buddhism, prefers this meek approach and always has, which is why Western occult engineering practices rose up as an antithetical solution to problems the Eastern world could not solve, even unwilling to explore. On the macroscopic scale, the Middle Way is not either hemisphere of thought, East nor West, but a combination of both, and sometimes one must act, go forth, and teach to the masses what needs to be or only cycles of evil will continue.

(For more on this deliberation, consider the architectural works of the ancient Egyptians, philosophies involving Socrates, Plato, Heraclitus, and Plotinus. Jewish mysticism is another field to study, especially the Sefer Yetzirah. More modern literature would be the writings of Manly Hall, Blavatsky, and similar theosophical studies. Occult circuitry are important key terms. Seek and you shall find.)",1467244800,8,3793,5.112903225806452

6906566,5,B00R8J8KFI,"Just a few minutes into the film, tears ran down my face and fell into my shirt.  So entranced, I didn't even bother to wipe them off and didn't care who might notice.  If you ever thought about meditation or do meditate and would like to know the basis and benefits, this movie will fill the bill.  A combination of nature, CG and ancient cites; these clips are coupled with expert narration without being preachy or pedantic.  Highly recommended.",1432944000,12,448,4.632911392405063

8694529,4,B00R8J8KFI,I originally watched it all on Utube and was enthralled.  The created images were just beautiful and the ideas flowed for me. My only negative comment would be that on popping it into my DVD player in my computer... the images lost the crispness I had seen while watching it on Utube. I just wondered about the resolution involved in the original program.  But friend who have watched it with me have made comment that they loved it; found it informative and beautiful.,1472428800,5,469,4.63855421686747
