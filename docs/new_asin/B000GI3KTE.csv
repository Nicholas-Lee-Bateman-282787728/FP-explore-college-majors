This is for the Tank and armor enthusiast or the military historian looking for information on IFVs. The chapter
list is:

1. Big Problems - begins with a discussion of half-tracks, universal carrier during the North Africa campaign of WWII.
  Also includes footage of the LVTPs in the Pacific during WWII.
2. Ultimate Weapon - content on the effect of the atomic bomb on infrantry fighting vehicles after WWII, then moves on to the
  Piranha wheeled family of vehicles.
3. BMP Series - coverage of the BMP-1, Marder, Puma and CV-90 from Sweden
4. Stormer and Warrior vehicles from the UK
5. US M113 - and its later variants from the late 1980s, Bradley IFVs test and exercise footage
6. Impressive US LVTP-7 which has footage of the equipment and features of the LVTP-7, beach assaults and land exercises
  from the 1980s. Also includes discussion and footage of operations in Grenada, Lebanon and the
  first Gulf War. Gulf War footage is the latest footage included on this program, with Bradleys and
  Warriors along with various tanks of Gulf War I.

I was trying to find a program on modern IFVs and this is the closest that I have found. The material is dated to mostly
the Cold War period. I gave this a four star rating because it is mostly what I have been looking for.",1373068800,,1388,4.574898785425101
