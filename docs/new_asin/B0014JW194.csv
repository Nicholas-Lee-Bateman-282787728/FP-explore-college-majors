It left me wanting even more insight into the camp, kitsch and chaos of the life of a working artist. I own the film now, as well as the tongue-in-cheek fun memoir that follows, 'Showgirl Confidential'. Love the Princess!",1415491200,,338,4.65
8255934,1,B0014JW194,"This could have been a great film...if it had never been made.  Acting, sound, editing and creativity is non-existent.  How could anyone give this 5 stars?  My 5-year-old grandson could have done better.  Not only is this film sick, degrading and mindless, it made me feel like a fool for buying it...watching it.  I had to fast-forward on many occasions.  The scenes are drawn out with dismal shots of dismal Texas.  Maybe that was intentional...but there's nothing of substance in this film.  Every actor and actress should reconsider their careers...or, perhaps, they could recommend other films they starred in for me to peruse.  Don't waste a dime...don't waste a minute of your time on this insult to film.  Amen.  I threw this DVD away.  I considered offering it to those in my sphere of friends, but I value my friends.  AVOID!!!",1391990400,,837,4.851063829787234

8255936,5,B0014JW194,"Loved this dvd, very informative! If you are belly dancer, you must watch this! Princess Farhana is a beautiful dancer, and the history of how she got there was amazing journey to witness.",1319328000,4,188,4.7272727272727275
8255937,4,B0014JW194,"""Underbelly"" is flashy, trashy fun.  I found the short section on burlesque a little silly, but bottom line, Princess Farhana is an amazing Middle Eastern dancer.  Both her technique AND her life story are inspirational.  It's worth buying the DVD just to see her performances.",1286409600,4,277,5.111111111111111
8255938,5,B0014JW194,"I spent six months in the editing room working on this movie, staring at footage until my eyes crossed and things stopped making sense, and I still love it.  If that doesn't speak to its awesomeness, I don't know what does.  You should buy it!",1276646400,,243,4.377777777777778
8255939,1,B0014JW194,Couldn't even finish viewing it. No comment except boring. Disappointing! It could not even tempt me to view on with the hope of discovering what is so interesting about this DVD.,1265760000,2,179,4.806451612903226
8255940,5,B0014JW194,"Going back as far as the early 80s...I have always considered this woman to be one of the finest story writers ever. And her poetry AIN'T bad either. The only problem I have is that she does not write enough...due to her busy schedule traveling, teaching, and bellydancing all over the world.

Now, regarding UNDERBELLY. It's informative, it's fun, and it is quite terrific.

Although I have never been interested in bellydancing, nor would I drive a great distance to see a bellydancer, I still got a real kick from watching all of these terriifc women pursuing something that they get so much enjoyment from. The ladies are having a blast, earning a buck, and living life to the fullest. How can anyone fault that?

My only ""complaint"" is this: there is not enough writing coming from the one and only Pleasant Gehman.
Most short story writers just plain suck. Why? Because they haven't got a clue. They seem to think that there always has to be a death, a killing or something for a story to work, for a story to have impact. This could not be farther from the truth.

 Charles Bukowski knew that isn't so, and so does Plez. And she does it by not putting a bunch of b.s. in her tales to pump them up, either.

We're waiting for something to read, Princess Farhana.

By now you must assume that I dig this talented woman. Yep. Just a bit.",1261612800,3,1341,4.471311475409836
8255941,1,B0014JW194,"What a major disappointment. I love belly dancing, but this DVD was awful. I expected interviews with quality. A waste of time and money. Not what I was expecting to get.",1240704000,3,170,4.516129032258065
8255942,5,B0014JW194,"Ah, ""Underbelly."" that scandalous bellydance film for which the teasers show Princess Farhana taking her clothes off, a la burlesque.  Oh, the horror, the shame...!  How COULD she?!

But having read some of Princess Farhana's writing on the subjects of Bellydance and Burlesque, I felt I knew better.  I pre-ordered the DVD mostly because I wanted it, but also because I trusted her to have done this right and I wanted to remind people that they should not judge a movie by its trailers.

And Director Steve Balderson and Princess Farhana definitely did not disappoint me.

This film has been done with incredible respect for everyone involved, with yet just the right amount of irreverence to keep you laughing while you take in its message.  Dancers of all shapes, sizes, ages, and sexes are represented in interviews, photos, and dances, and it's a breath of fresh air to seeing women on film who are out there and so proud of their curves and who they are.

""Underbelly"" embraces reality and explores the evolution of bellydance, even as it talks about departure from traditions and how the original Oriental Dance forms are in danger of being lost due to the appearance of fusion styles.  It's honest, and the burlesque scenes towards the end  make a lot of sense in the context of the film.  They certainly don't do anything to ""cheapen"" bellydance, and they do help distinguish.  The two art forms -- at least in the U.S. -- do have a lot of history in common and, like it or not, so do the performers.

This film is a fabulous reminder of why we dance or, if we don't, why we should.  Ultimately, it's about who we are and what we are and being okay with that.  Would that more films delivered such a positive message so effectively.",1207008000,31,1742,4.628664495114006
