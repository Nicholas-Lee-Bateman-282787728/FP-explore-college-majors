8193659,1,B000PX1632,"Undoubtedly a good teaching system in live sessions.

This DVD set is a two hour INFOMERCIAL for their training system.
They demonstrate their range of training topics and moves 100% with kids but NO actual instruction on HOW to do each move.

I was very disappointed and more importantly my daughter was bored.

Again, there is NO COERVER coaching or instruction provided on these DVDs - only rapid fire vide examples of their training drills.
I am very disappointed at the very inaccurate review I read that 5 star recommended this as a teaching video.",1221350400,15,554,4.810526315789474
