8097598,5,B000CCW2NO,"I LOVE this movie, but its almost impossible to find it in English or with subtitles, I had seen this movie plenty of times online; I wanted to share it with my husband but his Spanish isn't as good (yet) to be able to understand everything so we got this one and he really liked it too.
The movie came in excelent conditions, brand new and still in the wrapping plastic.",1513987200,,371,4.23943661971831
8097599,5,B000CCW2NO,"This is an excellent ''con"" movie in the same vain as House of Games and Nine Queens.  It is not an ""action"" movie full of explosions, fights and other absurd situations.  It is a drama, with a sprinkle of dark humor, where the acting, plot, script, cinematography are all top notch.  The character development is excellent all around.  The highlight for me was the restaurant scene where the Federico Luppi character calmly and coldly explains the ""philosophy"" that guides his activities and way of life to his younger protege.  This scene is one of the few in films in recent memory that attempts to ""explains"" this activity from the perpetrator's point of view, and it will linger in your mind for some time.  There really isn't that much diiference between him and the people in Wall Street.  He could well be a Wall Street hedge fund manager.  The only reason this film did not have the success it deserved was that it is in Spanish, with subtitles in English.  But it is so good that it sustains multiple viewing in order to fully appreciate it, if Spanish is not your first language.  Borrow, rent, or buy like I did and you will not regret it.",1433808000,,1151,4.570731707317073
8097600,5,B000CCW2NO,"I bought the movie based on the title and the fact that Federico Luppi was one of the starring players.  This is a movie that resembles ""The Sting"" or ""Nine Queens.""  It is very well done--great dialog, fast paced.  Throughout the movie I tried to anticipate the ending--I had constructed several plausible endings--and all of them wrong!  I won't give away any plot details and various instances of plausible misdirection--you should discover these on your own.",1365638400,,462,5.0394736842105265
8097601,3,B000CCW2NO,"The first reviewer of this DVD pretty much nailed it. I do not believe there is need to comment any further. And I also like watching Spanish films to improve my Spanish. :)

I like watching and hearing Victoria Abril's voice in movies. I am a fan. I also enjoy Frederico's acting.",1281398400,,281,4.403846153846154
8097602,3,B000CCW2NO,"This was a non-comedic, Spanish version of ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.""  It tests whether you can deal with having a main character be villanous.  ""The Talented Mr. Rpipley"" did the same thing.  The scenery reminded me of Almadovar's work, but the film lacked is quorky messages about gender, sexuality, and sundry topics.  It was more interesting near the beginning than by the end.  Watching this was a great way to listen to more Spanish and bone up on those skills.  This wasn't award-winning, but it wasn't terrible either.  Why not peep it?",1265673600,,544,4.912087912087912
