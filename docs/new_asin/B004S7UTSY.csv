8439561,1,B004S7UTSY,"I have to say this is one of the worst transfers to dvd of this program. Audio and picture were poor. I just recently purchased ""Hollywood Streets of Gold"" put out by Mill Creek. It was done in June 2013. It has the best video quality of ""The Legend of Marilyn Monroe"" I have ever seen on dvd before. The program on that dvd release was aired on ABC in 1967 and edited for time slot on TV. It is black and white, narrated by John Huston and was originally done in 1964. It was cleaned up considerably by Mill Creek which makes this release I am rating one of the all time worst. The ""Bonus footage"" is cut scenes from SYI. You can find those on the dvd of the movie in much better quality. Don't bother wasting your hard earned money on this.",1372550400,,742,4.124137931034483
8439562,2,B004S7UTSY,The quality of a picture is so poor. It seems like the DVD was rerecorded so may times. I'm not satisfied.,1368489600,,106,4.095238095238095
8439563,1,B004S7UTSY,"The only good thing about this  is the biographical audio. PD productions has insulted the viewer with almost unviewable video transfer film.  I have not seen the Synergy release but I can not understand why this  has been rated over a 1 star if that.  Far better would be to get or view ""Marilyn Monroe: The Mortal Goddess"" with similar footage but released by Image and very good quality,and alo an excerpted version available called Marily Monroe: The Final Days""- you will be satisfied.",1338595200,8,490,4.7976190476190474
8439564,3,B004S7UTSY,"I have been a long time fan of MM and looked forward to receiving this item. Perhaps I didn't notice in the description that it was black and white only, and I was a little disappointed with that.  The narration was good, and I was left with a feeling of sadness for her after viewing it.  Not much new information for me, but the tragedy of her life was effecively presented.",1323907200,5,376,4.28169014084507
8439565,1,B004S7UTSY,"THIS IS A VERY BAD QUALITY BOOTLE.
IN THIS CASE
TEN TIMES WORSE THAN A BOOTLEG.
DON'T BUY THIS AS I DID. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!",1304640000,,134,4.1923076923076925
