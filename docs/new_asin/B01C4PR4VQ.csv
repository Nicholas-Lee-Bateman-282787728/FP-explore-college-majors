8752244,4,B01C4PR4VQ,This is a good movie make no mistake.  The crazed taxi driver you want to be crazed and he is.  Definitely worth a watch. Or buy to keep.,1517011200,,137,3.857142857142857
8752245,1,B01C4PR4VQ,"Nauseating cheap movie that is a complete waste of time. It starts bad and just gets worse. What I really resent in a movie like this is the depiction of runt-like young men in a calculated move to impress similar who presumably form a market for this type of trash, despicably set against the backdrop of one of the most beautiful, refined cultured cities in the world. The City of Light.",1497916800,,389,4.492957746478873
