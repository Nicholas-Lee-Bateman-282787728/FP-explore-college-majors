7926444,5,B00004Y3PE,"Those who have been frustrated trying to obtain this DVD, as I have been, need to check out ""WW-II, in Color, The British Story.""  I bought the latter one and it is outstanding.  Narrator is the late John Thaw, of Inspector Morse fame.  Although run time is not listed it is around 4 hours, a real bargain for the price.

My DVD is labelled, Digital Collector's Edition, and has a 2000 copyright.  The video appears to have most of its color film re-mastered.  Color is vivid and clear, just as though it was shot yesterday.  Narration is typically British--understated but effective.  Chapter titles include Darkest Hour, Beginning of the End, Unknown Warriors, and Special Features.  The latter has outstanding pieces on the heroic Battle of Britain and the London Blitz.

Of course, one of the great mysteries of the past century is how the same nation could elect the lilliputian,  Neville Chamberlain, as Prime Minister and then follow him up with a giant of a man named Winston Churchill.  Chamberlain sold out Czechoslovakia, weakening the western allies, Poland, Russia and the defense system in eastern and western Europe.  No question, this really led to World War II.  Then in May, 1940, Chamberlain left Churchill to clean up his mess.  The DVD doesn't attempt to resolve this and other strategic questions of the time but you have to wonder about them, nonetheless.  As Churchill said, Chamberlain had the choice between dishonor and war and he chose dishonor.  But he would get war, later.

This DVD is a must for anyone interested in World War II and the implications it has for our present day.",1150329600,7,1610,4.835164835164835
