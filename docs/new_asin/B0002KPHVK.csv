2101350,5,B0002KPHVK,"My wife and I have been watching Teen Titans on cable for several weeks. As other reviews confirm, it has a strong anime-attitude influence combined with the 'Batman animated series' style of animation. There is a good deal of character development and old-school fans of the Teen Titans comics of the 80's (like my wife and I) will be pleased to know that the show is reasonably true to the old comics. It's also nice to see Robin dominating in combat instead of playing sidekick to Batman. All in all, Teen Titans gives good story, action and characters you will care about.",1091059200,3,576,4.6568627450980395
2101351,5,B0002KPHVK,"This is just an all out fun cartoon to watch.  It has action, humor, and great stories.  The thing I love the most about this cartoon is that there is always tones of action with amazing powers.  It's not like other shows where they have to learn there powers.  Right from the first episode they use there powers and know how to use them.  The caracters are Robin (yes Batman's Robin), Cyborg, Beastboy, Ravin, and Starfire.  Great characters and I'm sure there are much more to come.  Enjoy",1090713600,,491,4.511363636363637
2101352,5,B0002KPHVK,"Who ever says the Teen Titans is ridiculas has absolutly no tast what so ever.  Those guys are hystericle!  My favorite episode, so far is in the second season, (all the episodes all fantastic, by the way) the episode where Robin agrees to take a girl, named Kitty, to her high school prom and Starfire is having the mother of all hissy fits.  I mean talk about all the RAGE!!!  All the while, Raven, Cyborg and Beastboy check out basement/labratory of the episodes top villian, Killer Moth, who also happens to be Kitty's daddy.

Anyhow, I can't wait for Teen Titan to be released on DVD.  I'm also looking forward the third season.",1090540800,4,633,4.557522123893805
2101353,5,B0002KPHVK,"I completely disagree with the previous review.  Teen Titans is a splendid serries filled with zany comedy, colorful characters, interesting plots, and superior voice acting.  The anime-esque animation is stunning and hillarious.  The music by Puff-Ami-Yumi is worth buying the soundtrack for.  To top everything off, the DVD contains SIX whopping episodes(that's half of the first season!).  You can't beat such a sweet deal!  Give it a try, even if you are skeptical due to the way it was promoted, you will soon find that it wasn't what you expected it to be.  Its charm is sure to win you over!

Teen Titans Go!

PS.  Starfire and Robin make an adorable couple.",1090368000,6,665,4.857142857142857

2101375,5,B0002KPHVK,"I got this for my daughter to watch on a long road trip to San Diego. She loved it so much, it has become one of her favorite videos. At first, I couldn't stand what they had done to one of my favorite comics as a teenager, but I learned to like it and now my daughter and I watch it together, along with the regular series.",1125187200,3,324,3.8507462686567164
2101376,4,B0002KPHVK,"First and foremost, Teen Titans is not anime. Many people have said the show sucks because it claims to be but it isn't. Well, those people are stupid. Teen Titans blends classic American cartoonism with some anime conventions, such as the emotions in the little bubbles and the enormous eyes. It's a fun mix between American cartoons and anime and the show is conveyed very well this way.

Next, Teen Titans has some great character development. Each of the characters (Robin, Beast Boy, Raven, Starfire, and Cyborg) each have their own personalities, catch phrases, internal struggles, and of course, powers. Each of the characters balance the others out. Robin has a strong sense of duty while Beast Boy is the prankster comic relief. Cyborg is strong-headed and clashes with Robin in a few episodes, while Raven's dark and mysterious nature is balanced by Starfire's excitement for life.

Third of all, the show conveys, somewhat accurately, what it's like to be a teenager. The show is filled with angst, romance, comedy, and other elements of being a teen. Plus some of the dialogue is hysterical, especially Starfire's.

There is just one thing that bothers me, and that's the lack of interaction with the people the Teen Titans are saving. Civillians serve merely as cannon fodder and additions to the background. A lot of the battles are just Titans vs the bad guy and where's the fun in it if there's no saving of the common folk? Minus half a star for that AND for the fact that this is only half of the first season.",1119225600,,1528,4.78030303030303
2101377,4,B0002KPHVK,"This series is what I would call an ""anime facsimile.""  That means it's a cartoon made in the USA, but has a bit of that fresh flavor from Japan.  Others include ""Totally Spies"" and ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" on Nickelodeon.

Anyway, this DVD has the first half of the first season of the ""Teen Titans"" series.  And to tell you the truth, some of those episodes are some of my favorites.  Perhaps it's the first three episodes like the ones on the mini-DVD version.  As well as the one where Cyborg meets Fixit.

The bonus features include how the Titans went from comic book to cartoon series, the ""Find the Remote"" DVD game, and a music video of the theme song performed by J-pop band PuffyAmiYumi.

And speaking of Puffy, the DVD also has a sneak peek of the duo's very own cartoon series called ""Hi Hi PuffyAmiYumi.""  Along with the toon version of the band's wacky adventures, the actual singers do some live-action skits at the start of each show.  It's not a bad show, for another girl-powered series.

Look for new episodes of ""Teen Titans"" and ""Hi Hi Puffy"" this summer on Cartoon Network.",1117670400,,1100,4.561224489795919
2101378,1,B0002KPHVK,"I agree, this show isn't real anime, it much more resembles the art styles out of Batman Beyond which is not an anime cartoon.  When it first came out I thought it was ok, but they claim it to be anime and it just isn't.  Plus the episodes got stupider as the seasons went by so I gave up on it.

There's nothing original about this show... Robin is straight out of Batman, he's a carbon copy.  And I ""love"" the theme song at the beginning.  Puffy Ami Yumi might be from Japan but it does nothing but demean the image of true anime... it makes the show look more desperate to be anime from Japan than it already is.  And why they added the new character Bumble Bee I have no clue, but it makes the show all the worse.",1117324800,3,717,4.049645390070922
2101379,1,B0002KPHVK,"Teen Titans... hmmm... let's see, they call it anime and it's NOT! This cartoon is trying too hard to be something that it can't possibly be. And the fact that they had Puffy Ami Yumi sing the beginning theme song in Japanese proves my point all the more. This cartoon tries too hard to be an original anime piece, and basically it just isn't. The backgrounds look like average American action cartoon backgrounds similar to Gotham City. The characters look regular too (Robin has no eyes, Cyborg has regular eyes, Beast Boy, Starfire, and Raven kind of have an anime look but it's very feint). They use the anime symbols like the teardrop and the mad symbol, but you could put those same symbols on Batman and try to call it anime, but it's NOT. The episodes lack entertainment and fail to promote any good action what-so-ever. If you wan't real anime, look at Rurouni Kenshin, or Yu-Gi-Oh!, not Teen Titans.

In short this cartoon is fake and is what I like to call ""poser.""",1117065600,2,976,4.577142857142857
2101380,5,B0002KPHVK,"This is a great tv series! The episodes are great. It has something for everyone. Tears, laughter, sillyness, and darkness. Unfortunatly, this DVD doesn't have the greatest episodes on it. Check out the second DVD - way better!",1113436800,2,227,5.0
2101381,4,B0002KPHVK,"This DVD contains the first five episodes of the Teen Titans TV show.  There is no bonus footage and no added or deleted scenes.  While I am not a big fan of those first five episodes, what swayed me into purchasing the DVD was the interview with Marv Wolfman and George Perez, the two individuals who created the Titans.  I found it interesting to hear how they went about re-developing the comic, what goals they had for it, etc.
If you are a fan of the Titans TV show, then this is probably a good DVD to add to your collection.  However if you are just out surfing for a good cartoon to watch over and over again, and have no interest in the Titans or their creators, then you may wish to pass on this disc.",1111449600,2,711,4.1678832116788325
2101382,5,B0002KPHVK,"For a year or so I have ignored Teen Titans thinking it was gonna be lame because lets face it almost all cartoon shows today are LAME! I finally decided to recently give it a shot cause my sister said she saw an episode at a friends house and said it was pretty funny and enjoyable. So about 2 or 3 weeks ago I sat down and watched an episode(forgot which one!) and I enjoyed it(unfortunately I missed like the first 5 minutes). I thought Beast Boy was adorable and funny, Cyborg was funny, Starfire was cute, Robin was cool, and well Raven I really didn't like her because her voice and her attitude. And I enjoyed the ending song. Pretty catchy! The next time I saw an episode I again missed the very very beginning(mostly the opening song) but I found myself enjoying the show even more. And finally like the 3rd time watching it I was able to see it from the very beginning and finally heard the opening song which is one of the catchiest theme songs I have ever heard! I couldn't get the darn song out of my head(Darn you catchy Japanese music! :) )! And I just found out recently that the opening theme and ending theme are the same song(just different parts of it). Anyways enough about the songs this is really a great cartoon and I plan on buying it on DVD in the very near future! Also I have learned to love Raven as much as the other characters. She just needed to grow on me. Well if you haven't seen Teen Titans you better check it out even if it is a kids cartoon show. I'd say this and Kim Possible are if not the only good shows then the best cartoons on today! Definitly check out both!",1108598400,5,1605,4.214285714285714

2101384,5,B0002KPHVK,"I love anime.  I'm not terribly well acquainted with DC comics, but I loved the Batman animated series from the 90's, and I think that I like Teen Titans even better.  And not because of the anime-like features or the character depth - both of which are outstanding.

My favorite part of this series is the originality.  The creators of this show are willing to try everything once.  They took an idea from a comic already in existance and ran with it, ending up with something completely new and original.  Crayon-painted backdrops, Beatles-movie-reminiscant episodes, musicals...they have comedy for kids and adults mixed in with a subtle romantic plotline and a tangled character-development plot surrounding the main villain that rivals that of any adult show.  I actually cried during one of the episodes.

The show is an automatic winner for anybody who likes anime, and for anybody who enjoys watching when producers try something new and aren't afraid to experiment.  The creators of this show didn't just adapt an old cartoon - they created something of their very own, with spectacular results.",1107302400,4,1104,5.05524861878453
2101385,5,B0002KPHVK,"I think this series greatest strength is that the characters not only act like teenagers, but they look like teenagers.  The comics have them as full developed and toned adults in the their prime, while the cartoon shows them as younger and ganglier.  You would peg them at 14 at the oldest, and even that is being generous.

Visually, they meld anime conventions upon a typical American situation.  Having grown up with Robotech and G-Force along with Mickey Mouse and Donald duck, my eye is used to the sometimes odd Japanese conventions.  For some people, it takes a while to adjust.

Another good point is the balancing of personalities.  Boy Scout Robin levels-ff Beast Boy's puckishness, and Cyborg's broodiness.  More pointedly, manic Starfire counters Raven's depression.  This is key, because life an leadership is about managing different personalities.  And each episode's lesson is that you can have E Pluribus Unum: out of the diversity, you can achieve unity.

Really, they have captured the essence of being a teen. You always see them playing video games, watching weird movies, or just loafing around the house.  They have no hobbies, and they only get to work when the bad guys.  The series tag line is ""Truth, justice, and the last slice of pizza.""

Exactly.

There are two quirks in this series. The first is that these heroes are always heroes. They have no secret identities, and are always in costume, even when the sleep.  This gives them an awkward existence since they tend to be isolated in the large T-tower. They do not intermingle with us common folk, the people who they are trying to serve.

This chafes because, as Joseph Campbell points out, the hero must be a Master of Two Worlds (Hero With A Thousand Faces, 229).  He bridges the spiritual and the mundane.  The Teen Titans, however, are always superheroes, and you are not sure if they actual understand what they are doing and whom they are saving.

This bring me to the next point. There is no mentor.  Luke has Ben Kenobi, Frodo has Gandalf  but who is leading the Titans? I  know that teenagers would like the parents to bug-off, and than in many respects this is healthy.  But we all need mentors, and this seems to be a form of parental abandonment and is problematic.

Except for Starfire, they have no family.  This may be hitting to close to home with the many latch-key children in rent and torn families.  Hopefully, the Teen Titans can convey the message that even when your parents abandon you, you can still be a hero.",1105833600,,2520,4.733333333333333
2101386,4,B0002KPHVK,"Teen Titans Volume I, Divide and Conquer blasts off with six full episodes and lots of extras.  What a value for your money! Owning the DVD is a must for fans of the show, because the animation is so cute, but moves so fast that you need to view episodes multiple times.

The five characters of Starfire, Raven, Beast Boy, Cyborg and Robin are very loose adaptations of the comic book Teen Titans that I read in the early 1990's.  In the comics, Raven and Starfire were bodacious babes, young women in their late 'teens.  In the show, the girls are around fifteen and look it.  In the comics there were many more characters and soap opera romances.  Here, the five are friends, living platonically in the Titans Tower.  There is a hint of budding romance between Starfire and Robin, a nod to the comics when Robin became Nightwing, had a long and torrid relationship with Starfire, and married her.

I hope in future episodes we will see more characters from the comic book - especially Wondergirl.

The DVD extras include the producer, writer, and director talking in depth about how they created the series, a Puffy Ami Yumi video, a ""find the remote game,"" and ""sneak peeks.""  You know, I never could find that remote!",1103068800,5,1221,4.611111111111111
2101397,3,B0002KPHVK,"Rating this DVD may as well as be a rating of the entire series, which I've seen most of on TV.  I'm actually editing my review.

The crux of Teen Titans is about five abnormal kids with superpowers that fight villans (with villanous intents, obviously).  The overall premise is woefully unoriginal, as we can see.

However, the execution of the show is where it makes up ground.  Some of the characters, Raven and Robin in particular, have a surprising amount of depth to them for a ""kid's cartoon"".  The dialogue is smart and well written for the most part, though often the one-episode villans have some cery corny dialogue.

Interestingly, this seems to be a show of extremes.  For the most part, that's a good thing.  Some episodes are very dark and serious, some are totally goofy, some are in between.  Some of the jokes are very ""in jokes"", some are totally childish, and some will make everyone laugh.  Some characters are very deep, others very shallow, with only a few in the middle.  The animation can be extremely ""zany"" and overdone, or it can be very grim and almost ""batman""ish.  Good variety, eh?

Sadly, this rule applies to the quality of the show as a whole, and while some episodes are very good, others are very bad.  This DVD showcases five of the worst episodes in the entire series.  Hence the 3 star rating.  But don't let that fool you... the last half of the first series is absolutely excellent.

In the end, it's a show that is probably best watched on TV before you buy.  Some will love it, some will hate it, some will love it but won't be able to admit it to themselves (or others).",1102291200,3,1615,4.506896551724138
2101398,4,B0002KPHVK,"This dvd contains pretty cool episodes from Season 1 from TT. Lots of fun and actions for all ages. However, it lacks of extras and also, even the back cover of the DVD says its WIDESCREEN, actually its NOT.",1102032000,,207,4.333333333333333
2101399,4,B0002KPHVK,"Teen Titans is probably my favorite animated series, but season 1 -- especially the first episodes {which are in this DVD}, weren't that great.

Divide and Conquer -- not a bad episode. It was funny, it was cute, and Plasmus was disgusting. Yet, the writers wanted so bad to make a good ending -- and to make one in twenty minutes, not more, so the ending pretty much ruins the episode. Cyborg pops out of nowhere and saves Robin? How did he even get there? How did he know where Robin was? How the heck did he catch Robin when the Bird-Boy was inches away from burning into ash in acid? Out of ten, this episode would be six and a half/seven.

Sisters -- one of my favorites. I love it to bits -- Blackfire is too cool, Starfire acts like a five-year-old, and like David Slack, I believe, said in an interview you can also find in this DVD: that episode reflects the life of completely normal teenagers, just with super powers, aliens, and whatnot. Sibling rivalry is the greatest, and is also perfectly normal.

Eight outta ten.

Final Exam -- I love that episode. The HIVE's agents kick ass. Especially the Titans'. I don't have much to say about this episode, it only disturbs me that Beast Boy and Raven looked all over Jump City and couldn't find Robin, and when they need him -- Poof, Robin pops out of nowhere -- yes, just like Cy in the Divide and Conquer. Seven and a half.

Forces of Nature -- God, that episode is so clich. Teen Titans, even though a cartoon aimed for kids, is usually quite entertaining for older people is well. This episode was just boring. Thunder and Lightning are simply bad characters, that's all I have to say. BB's prank and his fight with Starfire I actually liked, but the rest of it... the horror! Five and a half out of ten.

The Sum Of His Parts -- L-A-M-E. Pointless, like all Cyborg episodes. Don't take me wrong, Cy is truly a great character, they just don't do him justice. The Titans chasing stupid Mumbo around while Cyborg was nearly dead -- annoying. Cyborg's memories make Fixit be all... umm, human, if this thing can even be human... And once again, the Titans come near the end to fight the bad guy, even though they were too late this time. Too bad, really, this episode had some potential. 6.

Nevermore -- of course I liked the other episodes {Well, most of them}, but this episode is actually the reason I bought the DVD. All Raven episodes are serious, meaningful, and well-written. This episode is hilarious, and I'm sorry to sound like a 7 years old but... RAVEN'S MIND IS SOOO COOL!!11one. The different sides of Raven's personality are just brilliant. Especially Trigon. Raaaaage becomes youuuuuu! I love that guy. I love Raven. I love that floating strawberry thing. 10/10.

Special features: Comic Creations -- I love that thing. Creator interviews, some information about ""The New Teen Titans"", character discussion, about the theme song and whatnot. Funnn.

Find the Remote -- Cute. I'm sure 8-year-old TT-obsessives would like it.

Theme Song Music Video -- Again I say cute. Puffy AmiYumi can really get on my nerves, but the TT theme song isn't too bad, in my opinion.

Sneak Peek -- I have no idea what this thing's for, except for advertisement. Meh.",1101427200,9,3224,4.579861111111111
2101400,4,B0002KPHVK,"My husband and son have enjoyed several cartoon superhero shows together over the years - especially Batman.  Teen Titans, another superhero type cartoon, caught their attention and both agree it's a great show to watch.  Like the movie Shrek - Teen Titans has enough subtle humor that adults (mostly men, I think) will enjoy the cartoon too.  How can you beat superheros fighting the bad guys?

Hardcore fan of the comics, the show really isn't all that bad compared to what others believe.  This anime wasn't made for older folks, but for children.  Otherwise, if it had gone by the comics, it would be much darker and sinister.  I find it funny when a person leaves a comment about the show when they don't take in the facts first.  Made for kids, most animes are -not- made for children, sorry...but it's the truth.  Seeing as I have a son that enjoys the show, I have no complaints and even watch it myself.

When I heard that Cartoon Network was going to do a Teen Titans series, I was skepticle. I have enjoyed the various Animated Batman/ Superman/ Justice League series of the 90s and now, but the TT were a different type of team than the grim and gritty JLA members (Well, except for Elongated Man and Plasticman...don't get me started) and I wasn't sure how well that would translate on the little screen.

 Turns out I had nothing to worry about. Teen Titans is the most original take on Superheros I've ever seen on television. Humor and coming of age angst is mixed with clever dialouge and decent animation (Though I preferred the orig. Animated Batman style). It's a toon I can watch with my kids (or even by myself) and thoroughly enjoy. Best of all, they include a little something for the adults watching as well. What do I mean? Something you hardly ever see in kids cartoons, character developement. Enjoy it while you can. Something this good hardly ever lasts.

But since I watched a couple times, I found the anime to be minimal, and it really gives the series a lot of character. It has sort of a Justice League feel to it, but integrates many animation styles. In my personal opinion, this is the best cartoon series of all time. The characters have real deapth and you can relate to them. It also offers fantastic comedy I find myself laughing out loud to. This is very rare in a cartoon. Robin has also forged a new identity for himself. Instead of the anoyng ""Holly whatever Batman"" side kick, he is now a leader, who by the way kicks serious [...]. The earliest episodes, all of which are on this DVD are not the greatest. They simpley can't compaire to the other episodes. The only problem I have with this DVD is that it does not come with all 13 episodes of the first season. The special features are pretty lame too. Accept the interview, it's worth watching. I would also like to point out to other viewers that this series was not intended to be anime, but a combonation of all the best animation styles out there.

2101416,4,B0002KPHVK,"I grew up reading and collecting the ""New Teen Titans"" comic books by creators Marv Wolfman and artist extraordinaire George Perez. Since then I've always wanted and wished they made an animated version back then. Decades later, a network finally noticed the dynamics of this super-hero group and finally brought it to the boob tube (or in some, HDTVs), where it's meant to be...

To the fans of the comic books, Teen Titans the animated series is a younger teen version of the comics where most of the team in comics were on their mid to late teens. And this difference is for a good reason. It was geared to attract the kids of today.

But despite that, I am so glad that the makers were true to the comic book. The fun, the craziness, the angst, the character dilemmas, the friendships, and the coming of age of each character were well shown. I think that's the great thing about it, its depth. And that's a lot to say for a kid cartoon.

So even if i'm no longer a kid. I love this cartoon.

And despite it not being in a complete season, the compilation of the first six episodes is enough to whet my appetite for the next set.

A great buy to give your kids. And for hardcore Titans fans liek me, a must for collection.

2101417,4,B0002KPHVK,"Teen Titans is a great animated series for both adults and children. The creativity of the series is unique and fresh. I at first thought it leaned heavily on anime influences, but now I don't see as much anime in it as I initially thought. The series actually combines a lot of elements from different genres of animation and pop culture. The Mad Mod episode is a great example of this animated melting pot. Besides having great humor and fun, the series also has an underlying arc, which is a format I love: stand alone episodes with some episodes having connecting storylines. It adds a bit of drama to this already eclectic series.

I docked off a star because this is a single disc release and not a season set. I have so many TV shows I want to buy that it's so much easier to collect them as box sets. Box sets are a better way to organize the episodes, no annoying snapper cases, and usually easier on the wallet too, price per episode.

8028655,5,B0002KPHVK,"OK, I was surprised to read such negativity in some of the reviews. Our family has been watching Teen Titans on Cartoon Network for a while. We were so excited when the First Season on DVD was released. Now we can watch our favorite episodes anytime! To those comic book junkies...THIS IS NOT LIKE THE 1960-1970'S COMICS!! IT'S NOTHING LIKE THE JR JUSTICE LEAGUE! This is a new take on an old comic. Kids today LOVE IT! It still has incredible characters, action, humor, and wit, with a story line kids today can follow and relate to. We are a family of four. We have a 9yr old girl and a 5yr old boy. We all end up laughing out loud to this cartoon. The characters are unique, and you get to know them well. We can never decide who is our favorite. People in the reviews are trying to say their ""Anime"" is superior. Who cares?? At least viewers can follow the story line, this isn't an animated soap opera!  This is a great show for KIDS and adults, and a great addition to our DVD collection!!!!!",1140998400,,998,4.308510638297872
8028656,1,B0002KPHVK,"I normally don't write reviews on items so trust me if I take the time to write about how absolutely bad this DVD is it means something.  If you are expecting some great animation and stories similar to the George Perez Titan days FORGET IT.  The target audience is for kids 6 and younger.  The characters are far too silly for this to be good story telling.  This is by far the worst animated series ever made based on comic characters.  DC and Warner get a big, fat ""F"" for this!  Go back and try again!",1136937600,2,505,4.208333333333333
8028657,1,B0002KPHVK,This show joins the long list of comic cartoon abominations.  And it's done in anime.  Maybe someday they'll do a Teen Titans: The Animated Series.,1131062400,3,147,4.84
8028658,3,B0002KPHVK,"In honesty, I never really liked Teen Titans (or Young Justice, although issue #1 was funny) old or the versions of the 1990s and 2003 era. Whatever. Young superheros really don't work in the DC comic universe (unless your partnered with Batman or Superman) like it does in the Ultimate Marvel universe. So when I heard they were going to make a cartoon series out of it, I wasn't in the least excited. But I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt although at the time my love for comic books gone cartoon series had died when Batman Beyond went off the air. So I put my skepticism aside for a moment to look at this ever popular cartoon from Warner BROS. I only have to say one thing -- they could've done better, waaay better for this comic book gone Cartoon. So I know that this series was aimed at a younger audience (via ages 10 up) so I won't even comment on the atmosphere surrounding the characters, just the characters - storyline/plot - writing - and art/voice acting. Brace yourself loyal otaku/fans of the cartoon.

Cyborg (Khary Payton) as the be the most annoying character in the Titans, only second to Beast Boy. He's got be the densest male character in the entire series; I'm not sure what they were thinking when they adapted his character from the comic books. He's not so much as funny as he is stupid. Best Boy (Greg Cipes) has to be the equivalent of a bad character that does absolutely ""nothing"" when there's no danger. His character really only shines when he's beating the crap of bad guys with his ever powerful ability to change into any animal he wants. The character based episodes on him are like watching ""Dude Where's my car?"" over and over again, its painful. Is it not enough that Cyborg is the comic relief, but now we have to have two idiots? Raven's (Tara Strong) character, is the usual stereotyped ""silent but deadly/grouchy"" character, but at least she's the most likable character of the group who has an actual personality and backstory that sadly, does not translate well in the cartoon (her constant chant for her attack and meditation is bothersome).

Robin (Scott Menville) was someone I was hoping like as much as I did him in the comics/1992-98 Batman Cartoon series, but alas it was not so. He ended up being characterized as a too macho - to obsessed with slade character and I didn't like the fact that seemed more worried about Starfire than he did his other teammates. The episodes surrounding thie skimpy teenagerI were so dramatized that I found myself laughing at them. I also didn't like what they did with Nightwing when he appeared in one episode (""how long is forever"" if I remember correctly). His chest stuck to far out - his back was in a little too much - the overall body articulation for Nightwing was just simply horrible despite the fact that he almost resembled the Nightwing in ""The New Batman Adventures."" I'm not sure why they didn't go out their way to bother Loren Lester instead of settling over Scott Menville who currently voices ""the amalgam of all Robins"" - Robin. At least the episode would've been slightly bearable to watch. Another down fall is that they try to make this character fart too serious ultimately destroying at little likableness there is in his personality.

Last of the characters is Starfire (or Cory) - the half-dressed alien of another planet (Hynden Walch) is unbearable. I honestly don't like her character - she probably only third densest next to Beast Boy and Cyborg. She's doesn't seem to understand human vocabulary or culture, she's not convincing when she's fighting along side the other Titans, let alone angry and overall she doesn't seem to be very bright. One of her most annoying characteristics is that she tries to be friends with everyone (in other words she too darn friendly toward everyone) and then she equally worries over Robin more so than her other teammates (sound familiar?). And at any given moment of any episode throughout the entire season of Teen Titans, the creators will make up some absurd moment for the duo to hint a romantic relationship forming between the two cartoon characters, covering up as friendship (though at times it does seem that way). I'm also aware that the Starfire and Robin/Nightwing had a romantic relationship in the comics, heck, even tried to get married once before they were interrupted by Mad-Raven. But if your gonna ""loosely base"" a cartoon an original 80s' comic then yous better leave the romance behind in the comic book as well.

Another bothersome character was the outside Terra --""like terra forming""-- (Ashley Johnson) - the girl with the power to manipulate earth. Throughout the episodes she appeared in (""Terra"" - ""Terra Rising"" - ""Betrayal"" -""Aftershock Parts 1 & 2""), Terra is the usual abandoned dog character that the Titans befriend and make an official part of the team. She even starts to have feelings for Beast Boy. All that happens with this character has been seen and done, its just done a just a tiny-bit better with Terra. However, as she progressed throughout her short time on the series, she just became another ""Anakin Skywalker"" type character; She turns to the dark-side and then somewhere along the line decides to atone for her sins by destroying Slade along with herself by turning herself into a statue. A fitting end for such a character if I do say so myself.

That aside, another plus that Teen Titans managed to acquire many characters from the comics, such as Aqualad and Speedy. They have appeared occasionally throughout the show. The only persons they were missing is Wonder Girl and Impulse of Young Justice. The so called ""self-referential humor with villains of the week -----equivalent of Smallville's ""freak of the weak,"" Buffy or The X-Files ""monster of the week""------ for many episodes"" villain's is when the show really falls in the character department. From the villain who looks like a younger version of Elton John, the lightening and thunder twins to the HIVE ACADEMY teen villains among others, there really is no depth to these bad guys or much of a challenge. The Titans pretend that they're struggling against them. Probably the only actual interesting villain is Slade voiced by Mr. Helloboy himself - Ron Perlman, who also did some voice acting in ""Batman: The animated series"" as monstrous Clayface. No wonder I like him. I always figured it was Bruce Wayne gone bad or something. He kept saying ""you learned from the best""- duh, its only a natural line of thinking. Slade's probably the only villain who actually holds his own character and storyline - no matter how flimsy it is. The only down fall with this character is that he appears in one to many episodes throughout the seasons of ""T-T""; When the creators can't think of a villain to make up they use Slade. In all honesty they should've spaced him in-between seasons like MacGyver, Buffy, and Xena did with Murdoc, Faith, and Callisto or Ares.

As for the DVD - I think Amazon.com explains plenty to you about what the DVD contains. Most notably it holds out of order episodes contrary to the original airing of the episodes, which were:

.01.01: Divide and Conquer: Cinderblock breaks into a prison only to find the Teen Titans waiting for him. But when Robin and Cyborg's big ""Sonic Boom"" maneuver goes awry, the bad guys get away and the boys blame each other. An argument erupts, and when the shouting stops, Cyborg quits. Robin later regrets the argument, especially when the group faces off against Plasmus.

 01.02: Sisters: When Starfire's sister, Blackfire, shows up to visit, Starfire just wishes she would leave. Blackfire is wild, cool, and hip...everything Starfire's not. Since the other Titans seem to like Blackfire so much, Starfire thinks they won't need her around anymore. But just as Star's thinking about leaving, a couple of alien thugs show up to haul her away.

01.03: Final Exam: The H.I.V.E Academy unveils its top graduates: three teenage supervillains known as Gizmo, Mammoth, and Jinx. Before Slade will hire the new HIVE agents, he requires that they pass one final test: they must destroy the Teen Titans.

01.04: Forces of Nature: Dark, ominous clouds blow in from the East, bringing Thunder and Lightning with them: two forces of nature made flesh in the form of costumed super-teens. The stormy brothers aren't evil...they're just looking for a good time. Unfortunately, their idea of fun involves wrecking everything in sight.

01.05: The Sum of His Parts: A day of fun in the park is cut short when Cyborg suddenly freezes like a statue. His power cell is dying. But before Cyborg can get home to fix his power cell, the Titans are called into action. During a wild junkyard battle with the Amazing Mumbo, Cyborg's battery goes dead. While the Titans search the city for Mumbo, Fixit, a strange cybernetic hermit with sinister intentions, finds Cyborg.

01.06: Nevermore: When a battle with Dr. Light pushes Raven over the edge, the Titans see a side of their mysterious friend that they've never seen before. After Raven's creepy tantrum of crackling black energy leaves Dr. Light begging for mercy, Beast Boy isn't quite sure how to treat her.

Instead the DVD showcases the first season episodes in this order.

DVD. Episode 01: Final Exam

DVD. Episode 02: Sisters

DVD. Episode 03: Divide and Conquer

DVD. Episode 04: Forces of Nature

DVD. Episode 05: The Sum of His Parts

DVD. Episode 06: Nevermore

Now for the animation and art. People call this art-style a 'hybrid' western and eastern art (Japanese and American), but the animation for the show is low grade. A majority of the mistakes in the animation can be seen from the action poses to just simple walking animations. The character designs are just a bit on the flimsy side (A majority of the character's necks are too skinny & their heads are too big). It tires just a little too hard to play off the ever popular ""Anime"" (Japanese for ""Animation"") styled art with the action-stylized backgrounds, expressions varying from Shocked to absolute stupefied. The list goes on and on. Another thing wrong with Teen Titans are the storylines. Aside from the fact that Seasons two and four were based upon two of the most popular New Teen Titans arcs, ""Judas Contract"" and ""Terror of Trigon"" respectively, a majority of the episodes (seasons 1-5) don't have one. Their just you're usual action romp - beat the bad guys episodes. Your usual ""wash-rinse-dry-repeat"" so to speak. Expect nothing less from a cartoon for children via ages 10 and up. Lastly the show basically does another thing wrong similar to X-men: Evolution; it tires to be too cool with rock music blaring in the background, the over exaggerated attacks from the heroes/villains along with Robin always shouting ""Titans Go!."" Now Jaded-30 something's adults seem to enjoy this action a lot but me being a teenager, I know a good cartoon when I see one. This ain't it. Of course Reviewers will say otherwise. And, as much as I would like to enjoy watching ""Teen Titans"" I just can't find the will power to overcome the gaping flesh-wound flaws of the series so I'll be sure to dodge this DVD. Read the comic books (ones not affiliated with the cartoon) instead. [a 3 out of 5]",1128729600,4,11236,4.793388429752066
