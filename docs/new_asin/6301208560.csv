7810182,3,6301208560,"Dangerous Curves is a mediocre movie it is worth watching for the moments Leslie Nielsen is in(a very dry performance but He was great),and for the PoorMan's Porsche(Don't care for Porsches or Ferraris)aka the wanna-be Corvette, as well the Mondial Ferrari,and some of the women. But the most beautiful girl in the movie is the Mexican one with Huge front bumpers.don't expect this however to be a skin-a-max with the obligatory shots as they say,it is hardly funny or entertaining and the plot is a rip-off of Corvette Summer and Stingray(the movie not the show 1978).Overall an Okay Movie.",1323820800,6,591,4.97979797979798

It stars Tate Donovan, Grant Heslov, Danielle Von Zerneck, Robert Stack, Robert Klein, and Leslie Nielson.  When a college kid is asked by his father's old Marine buddy to pick up a very nice but expensive Porsche and take it to his daughter so that she'll get on her daddy's good side, his friend comes along in hopes of partying but not caring about what his friend needs to do cause a job is on the line for this simple task.  When they get to a convienence store, the Porsche gets stolen by a high roller auto theft giant. They come to find out that the Porsche was stolen and used for a Mission Beach Pageant for the grand prize.  They must put a stop to it and get the Porsche back from the ones who stole it and get it to the girl.  In the end, the auto theft giant sees the change in the car and sees it's HIS car that got placed in it and gets arrested.  I wish and hope that this movie would become a DVD RErelease because it has a lot of action and high speed action.  So if you ever want to see this movie, you might have to locate it on some website cause I doubt it'll be to rent since it is so old.  DANGEROUS CURVES so it you'll love it....Also, watch for the beginning and see if you can find the unexpected cameo of MTV's fmr. V.J. Martha Quinn!!!!",1132617600,10,1430,4.039007092198582
