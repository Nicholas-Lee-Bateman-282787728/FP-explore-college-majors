8663953,5,B00L5V9TTQ,This show inspired me to travel to Myanmar aka Burma.  A country that has fascinated me since childhood Geography studies in the fifties.  I will be making that trek in February 2017.  Myanmar is the only country I've not been to in SE Asia.  Very informative and well done as usual videography is excellent.  I would strongly recommend this video to anyone interested in going to Myanmar as kind of a preview of the country and culture.,1471132800,,437,4.623376623376624
