8162833,1,B000LP5D74,"I remember when Florida was chosen to play Ohio State in this game. The result was a lot of ""chatter"" about them being undeserving and Michigan deserving a #1 vs. #2 rematch. I was part of that chatter. I was wrong. And then some. Florida's dismantling of Ohio State here coupled with USC's domination of Michigan in the Rose Bowl affirmed that. The Buckeyes seemed to be the team to be questioned not the Gators. Perhaps USC, LSU, or even Boise State would have been a better opponent and provided a more competitive game. Probably would not have done any worse. That's not how the system worked though. Honestly, who could have known? Surely not even the most avid Gator fan could have forseen this.
This is FOX's complete telecast of the 2007 BCS NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP presented commercial free. An abbreviated pregame is provided along with the postgame being offered as part of the BONUS FEATURES. Halftime is not available in any form. This is not a blu-ray so don't expect a high definition experience with your viewing. However, the picture quality is excellent. You just have to accept it for what it is.
Okay, a five star review gets a one star rating? Ah, there's the rub. This dvd, by far, has the most edited huddles of any I have viewed in this game series. And it definitely takes away from the overall quality of the product. This practice, a pet peeve of mine to begin with, causes the whole game to seemingly have a lack of continuity. For no apparent benefit.
You can probably find a more complete version of this game with equal or perhaps better picture quality with on online trader. They are out there.",1490054400,,1625,4.626297577854671

8162840,5,B000LP5D74,Once again the GATORS prove that Over-rated State Univerity can't handle the SEC-GATORS!  It was a pleasure watching the #1 ranked team (from season start to finish) go down.  But that's what happens when a division champion of a lackluster conference meets a true champion in the toughest conference in the NCAAF!  GO GATORS!,1196121600,,326,5.0

8162842,5,B000LP5D74,"I have to admit the first 5 minutes of the game made me nervous. But then the Gator defense stepped up their game and starting dismantling OSU's perfect season record. Troy Smith got very little help from his team mates as he scrambled again and again while being hunted by the Gator defense.

 To be fair, all Urban Meyer had to do to motivate his team was let them know that no one gave them a prayer of being able to play the #1 ranked OSU football team. Too bad OSU believed it also.

 Truly hilarious moments when you see the fans literally crying about the shellacking their team is taking. Unfortunately the second half was a let down. Steve Spurrier would have run up the score and it would have been much worse than the 41 to 14 debacle it was.",1172361600,6,753,4.28169014084507
