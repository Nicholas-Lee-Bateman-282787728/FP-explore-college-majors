8742043,4,B018EHR54E,"You're probably asking yourself who is Daniel Martin and why is he (or is he?) the star of two early Euro-Westerns? Not a name in the same league alongside Franco Nero, Tomas Milian. George Hilton or even Anthony Steffen who also stars in THE LAST TOMAHAWK. The most famous Spaghetti Western that Martin appeared in was A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS. Not bad considering you'd probably be cast as a thug heavy in either the Baxter or Rojo gang. That way you get to do neat things like spit, beat people up and/or laugh maniacally. Not Martin. He got to play the worse role in the film, the sissy husband of Ramon's captive woman. I can't remember if he even had a line of dialogue, but I do remember him mothering up to that loud mouth kid and cowering and whimpering a lot. So why does this guy rate top billing status in this Wild East DVD release?

THE LAST TOMAHAWK seems to cry out for someone to become the main hero. Joachim Fuchsberger, star of countless German Edgar Wallace mysteries, was probably the most recognizable star in the cast, but his role seemed secondary to both Steffen and Martin who played Hawkeye and Uncas respectively. You see, this film was an adaptation of James Fennimore Cooper's THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS, transplanting Mohicans, Mohawks, and the 1750s New York frontier to the American southwest via Cuenca, Almeria. We get cavalry soldiers and banditos also thrown into the mix as well. It's really pretty wacky but rather entertaining. The print is widescreen and looks great. Early into the movie we are treated to an unusual location of large mushroom shaped rock formations which could pass as the landscape of Venus in a sci-fi movie. THE LAST TOMAHAWK moves along briskly enough with lots of action and a high body count, pretty good stuff for an early Euro Western. Dan Martin, as Uncas, rises to the task and pretty much takes over as the main hero during the last quarter of the movie. He gets the climatic fight scene at the end and most of the screen time. So I guess it would be fair to consider him the main hero and top billed star. Fuchsberger had pretty much already peaked as a star when THE LAST TOMAHAWK was filmed and Steffen was just starting his rise to Spaghetti Western fame.

THE MAN CALLED GRINGO had Martin as the title character, but not the lead in this one. That role definitely belongs to Goetz George as Mace Carson, a stranger who is up to something mysterious. Martin plays a gun thug in the employ of crooked lawyer (was there any other kind out west?) Ken Denton who wants to grab up mostly everything for himself. As Gringo, Martin discovers his real identity and true calling in life, which is to take a bullet in the chest for being a misunderstood creep for so many years. The plot groans with predictability and plays like a standard TV episode of THE VIRGINIAN, GUNSMOKE or BONANZA. Still, the locations are always interesting and the Euro slant is evident even though the director Roy Rowland was American responsible for many fine B-features, Westerns included. Rowland's best Euro Western, in my opinion, was GUNFIGHTERS OF CASA GRANDE starring a wonderfully insane Alex Nicol and made around the same time.

All in all, Wild East does it again, producing a neat package of two seldom seen German/Italian Westerns. Both look pretty good in widescreen format and both providing a fascinating look at how Westerns were made in Europe in the early 1960s. Highly recommended for the historical aspect and definitely for fans of the genre...and for fans of Daniel Martin, whoever you may be.",1514419200,,3557,4.678913738019169

8742045,5,B018EHR54E,I enjoyed the films. I love Spaghetti Westerns and these are 2 of the early ones. The prints are excellent and the casing is nice as usual. I do wish that the company used captioning but Im lucky to be getting to see most of these that has never seen U.S. Soil before.,1458604800,2,268,4.0754716981132075
