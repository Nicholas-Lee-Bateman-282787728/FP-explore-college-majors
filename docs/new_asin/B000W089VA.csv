2959847,4,B000W089VA,"This is the first one of these I've seen in the series.  And I'm certainly not a Christian fiction reader, but I am a film buff and a couple we are friends with turned me on to this series.  I gotta say, I came away very moved.  Plenty to pick on to be sure, but dang it, that adoption scene in the church was a tearjerker.  And, I kind of like films that are predictable and romantic especially when my wife is getting all caught up in it if you know what I mean.  I want to go back and check out the one with the Grey's Anatomy actress, though how she got from Christian fiction to Knocked Up I'd rather not speculate.  Anyway, certainly worth watching, and if you like these pioneer sagas, worth buying.",1196812800,6,706,4.154411764705882
2959848,2,B000W089VA,"This series started with such promise. I enjoyed the first two movies (granted they more closely followed the books).  Janette Oke wrote such wonderful stories, I really have a hard time understanding why they would make SO many changes.  The actress who plays Missie in this movie does not act emotion very well at all.  Moments that were supposed to be serious were laughably ridiculous because of her demeanor and the faces she would make.  She made the same stern, straight-lined mouth expression for everything, whether she was supposed to be angry, happy or sad.  And I cannot believe that they killed off Willie.  He was the one redeeming character that I was still watching for.  The actor who plays Clark is the only one that has remained the same for the whole series.  (He too makes me laugh because he sometimes morphs into talking like Elvis- as he starred in a TV movie playing Elvis...)

I understand that this is still good family entertainment.  I appreciate the fact that Hallmark is making family and faithful entertainment (hence the two stars rather than one).  I just think that they could be doing a better job.  Ms. Oke wrote great stories- they didn't need to be changed.  Yes, edited for time constraints but that's all that was really necessary.  This story wasn't even a Love Comes Softly book- some of the characters were the same but there the similarities end.  I'm still sad that Katherine Heigl was unable to reprise her role as Marty but I don't blame her for not wanting to be associated with the mediocre movie.  The acting was pretty horrible- I only watched the whole thing to see how they wrapped things up.  The majority of the time, though, I couldn't help laughing about how the story, the facial expressions, the acting - was all supposed to be fairly serious but because the quality and caliber of talent was so low it was laughably ridiculous.  A big disappointment- I would watch this on TV before spending any money on it.  If the same actress is still playing Missy I don't plan on bothering with the rest of the series.  A series of movies that could have been so much better- that's the main reason for my disappointment.  With such a great premise, you wouldn't think it could go so wrong...",1196812800,14,2242,4.653944020356234
2959849,4,B000W089VA,"but not really up to par as far as the story goes. I don't understand why they kill Willie off. It would have been fine on its own. If this movie was a single movie it would have been alright but isn't and can't be thought of like that. Where is the rest of the family? When Missie gets back to her parents place she doesn't even ask about her little brothers and Pa doesn't ask about his grandson, Jeff. That is just too weird! Recommend as a family movie but not as a good series continuation.",1196812800,,495,4.11340206185567
2959850,2,B000W089VA,"I have watched all of the movies since the very first one, Love Comes Softly, and fell in love with the series so much so that I bought the books to read and couldn't wait for this movie.  I was very disappointed with this particular installment.  This was so far away from the book that I didn't recognize it when I watched it. Other than the observations already noted (Belinda as Missie's daughter not sister, etc.), it also seems to have lost her brothers and their adopted son, Jeff.  If there was only about 4 years difference between this movie and the last one, then her brothers would not have been old enough to be out on their own, yet there was no mention that they even exist.  However, I am glad that they are able to keep Dale Midkiff as Clark, but think they could find a better substitute for Katherine Heigl as Marty.  To kill off Willie just to give Missy a new love interest was a travesty.  I gave it two stars and hope if they make the last books, they follow the books as best they can (outside of resurrecting Willie via a dream sequence).",1193270400,52,1063,4.316582914572864
2959851,1,B000W089VA,"The first four movies went along great with the books.
This one is not even on track with the book by the same title.  It doesn't go with it at all.

I also don't know how they will continue the movie series as this movie had not much at all to do with the book.",1191024000,7,262,3.7454545454545456
2959852,5,B000W089VA,No movie from book to film are ever the same. However I myself and my family have enjoyed the Love Comes Softly series. I don't have to worry about language or nudity. These are great family films and would buy again.,1190678400,15,217,4.317073170731708
2959853,1,B000W089VA,"The BOOK ""Love's Unending Legacy"" is about Clark and Marty Davis returning home from the west where they visited daughter Missie in the previous book (said visit having been badly botched in the corresponding movie for that book), and Marty then discovers she's pregnant with baby Melinda.  I read the plot on the Hallmark Channel website, and it's TOTALLY messed up:  Missy's husband Willie has died (he was still very much alive at the end of the original 8-book series, as were the 4 children who are non-existent in the movies), and she moves back home to her father's house with her one son and takes in an orphan girl named Belinda.  They've ruined this story so badly, I can't imagine what they might do with the last 3 books (which are ABOUT Missy's BABY SISTER Belinda, not ADOPTED DAUGHTER Belinda)!  And why do they persist in leaving Marty out of the later movies?  3 different people have played Missie so far, surely they could have found a replacement for Katherine Heigl if she's not available to play Marty!  One star is too good a rating for this monstrosity.",1190332800,27,1077,4.671957671957672

2959877,5,B000W089VA,"After having watched some very macho testosterone man oriented Westerns, I was relieved to watch this more tranquil and soothing film.  I haven't read the books that this series is based off of, however, I have watched the first four movies in this series.  And, I really enjoyed this one.  I was puzzled by the fact, that in this movie they didn't mention any children on the part of Missie's parents, and I do recall them having had children.  So, that was a loose end that was never addressed in this movie.  However, in this movie, we have Missie returning back to her home after going out even further West with her husband, Willie.  Willie, as the Sheriff, was shot and killed.  And so, Missie returns home to get back to teaching.  It is very nice to see her home again, as her father is such a likeable fellow, that as a viewer, I don't ever want her far away from her Daddy!  As the orphan train comes into town, she adopts a young teenage girl who needs a home.  And the Sheriff helps her with the girl and reuniting the girl with her brother.  And, I have to say, the Sheriff in this film was very romantically and handsomely portrayed by the fellow (I'm not familiar with the actor).  And Missie is one of the luckiest ladies in literature to have such handsome Sheriffs continually in love with her.  :)  On a serious note, though, in this movie, especially, it felt like the actors were just modern people in old timey attire.  In fact, they seem so modern, sometimes one doesn't even notice the old timey attire.  As they don't even attempt to have a time period appropriate dialogue nor mannerisms.  That is a flaw in this show that I hope they take more seriously and remedy in the future.  Otherwise, it is clean and wholesome and a nice soothing movie to relax with.",1458691200,,1785,4.44

2959938,3,B000W089VA,"For the past four movies, I've said that you just cannot compare the movie to the book, but I'm going to make an exception here.  You just CANNOT kill off a main character that stayed alive in the books!  What the writers and producers were thinking here is way beyond me!  How they can even call this ""based on..."" I don't know.  Nothing in this is true.  Missy only had one son, Willie has died, and Belinda is her adopted DAUGHTER instead of her later in life sister...

I think they had trouble coming up with new quotes and concepts as well.  Missy was quoting Marty from ""Love Comes Softly.""  Clark even helped Missy move on the exact same way he helped Missy move on...

If the story hadn't been ""based on..."" I probably would have been a lot nicer in my review, but one thing that cannot be done is killing off main characters in movies that lived in books!",1388793600,2,865,4.3229813664596275

2959943,5,B000W089VA,"Possibly one of my favorite movies. I like good clean movies (or as clean as you can get nowadays). Love's Unending Legacy was really, really clean. A girl kicks a man; a boy has an accident and a little blood is seen on his arm; a horse which shatters its leg has to be shot but it is heard not seen; a girl fights with boy at school; a woman dreams about her husband's violent death but it's not graphic, you only hear a gut shot; there is also talk about a man being abusive to a child.  Most people would skip it because they think it is too predictable or ""lame"", but I like movies like that because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been ""slimed"".  The Dove Foundation gave it a five star and approved it for ages 12 and older.

I don't like the entire series, several are a little boring and it seems that Janette Oke has a thing with killing off the husbands and having the women remarry. So I only watch certain ones. Love Begins first (since is covers how the ""Love Comes Softly"" saga began), second is Love Comes Softly, third is Love's Enduring Promise, fourth is Love's Unending Legacy, and 5th is Love's Unfolding Dream. They are all amazing, really clean, high morals, family friendly, inspiring, and focuses on the more important things in life.

Two years have passed since the tragic death of Missie LaHaye's husband Willie. Unable to work the land on her own, Missie and son Maddie leave there home to go back to her father's ranch.  She becomes a school teacher again and tries to start a new life, even though she still has nightmares about her husband's death.  An orphan train comes to town and even though she is determined not to take one in, something makes take in a fourteen year old girl who no ones else wants.  The transition is difficult, especially when the girl sees that another family is mistreating her brother, whom the family adopted. Missie attempts to prove the boy is being mistreated, and at the same time she attempts to fight her feelings for the town sheriff, Zach.

Overall, I really love this move and will definitely watch it over and over again.",1372636800,2,2138,4.436224489795919

2959975,2,B000W089VA,"Warning spoiler alert I must say I love the beginning, very touching as she sits at Willie's grave.  When I found out in the book that Willie doesn't die, my opinion of the movie went down because I see that Willie could have lived. Her she was with a beautiful relationship with a guy she loved only for him to die and her to marry a guy that seemed to just be there.  Zack is not a good replacement for Willie. Unless they made a very good romance between them, they shouldn't have killed Willie off.  As other people said Missy did not know Zach long before she fell in love and it seems like it only took days for Missy to fall for him.  Here she is still mourning her late husband, knowing that she will never love anyone else as much, when a random guy comes along doesn't do anything special and she falls for him.  At least in Love Comes Softly there is a story behind how Marty falls in love with Clark, here there is nothing.  I thought it would take more then a single guy being there for her to fall in love with him.  Plus this struck, why would she want to marry another sheriff, who could meet the fate as Willie?  Where she would have to worry over him all the time, him being a sheriff didn't seem to bug her at all.  The parts where she talked about Willie were more touching then all the scenes with Zach, other then when she tells Zack about Willie.",1344297600,,1369,4.15530303030303

2959996,3,B000W089VA,"Love's Abidiing Joy, the previous installment of the Love Series, was a laughable crash of an adapation. This installment is a vast improvement over LAJ. A director who has kept the situations heartfelt and real. Material that may veer toward mauldlin, but knows just when to cut back in order to keep it real. While there seems to be questions with some liberties take from the book, on it's own the film works fairly well. One of my sticking points is the abrupt dismissal of Missie's first husband, in a poorly reenactment of his death. Once that is over, the film begins to gain it's track and right itself from his previous quality detour. Whereas the loss of a infant child is handled poorly in the previous film, this time around, it is dealt with with much humanity, poignancy and in a realistic manner. Kudos to the writer in the scene relating the loss of a child and tying it in beautifully with the new installment. Glad to see the series right itself and begin to get back on track with this installment. While far from the best (see LOVE COMES SOFTLY), it is a fine sequel (5th!) and makes you want to continue the sage. Thanks Mark Griffin for returning to the humanity of the situation and getting the series out of it's laughable detour of Love's Abiding Joy (do we really find abiding Joy in dreadful laughable films?????!)",1248048000,,1341,4.591666666666667
2959997,5,B000W089VA,This was another great piece of the puzzle.  My family has enjoyed watching this serious; from the seven-year-old to the grandparents.,1241395200,,134,5.380952380952381
2959998,2,B000W089VA,"First off, I don't think this movie is horrible. This was my first exposure to the series (I haven't read Janette Oke's books) and on my first viewing I thought it was a nice, enjoyable movie. Then I watched a few of the others and rewatched this one again, and it leaves me shaking my head. Why kill off Willie? As many viewers have said over and over, he was an excellent character, and the actor did a wonderful job of creating a soft-spoken, hard working, loving man--perfect romance hero material. Viewers have gone through three movies with this character/actor and have made a deep connection with him, and suddenly he's gone? Personally I mourned the character's demise more than his wife apparently did--she was primed and ready for romance with ANOTHER sheriff. The fact that Willie is alive in the book series makes the director/producer/screenwriters' decision all that more deplorable.

If they needed to get Missie back to Anderson Corner to renunite with her mother and father there were a number of ways to do that without killing off Willie. If Logan Bartholomew wasn't available for this movie, I think Victor Browne would have worked as a recast. His character was a carbon copy of Willie anyway. And at least make a mention of Jeff and Colette, and Cookie and Scottie. Leaving viewers to wonder what happened is lazy and disrespectful to those who have invested time in watching and buying the movie.

All these complaints aside, I do think more sweet, clean movies need to be produced. There is an audience that craves family and faith based entertainment. However, film makers don't need to sacrifice quality, as they did with this movie.",1240012800,,1660,4.841549295774648

2960000,5,B000W089VA,I enjoyed this addition to the Love Comes Softly series just as much as I have all of them and wait eagerly for the one to follow Love's Unfolding Dream.  I love them all and sit down to watch the whole series all in a row quite often.  I have not read the books as movies are very often not like the books they are based on.  I give every one in the series a five star rating but my favorite is Love's Long Journey.,1229990400,,416,3.8705882352941177
2960001,3,B000W089VA,"I've watched all the previous movies, so was interested to see this one also.  Like all the previous movies, though, there seems to be a certain lack of romance between the protagonists.

You could almost excuse the first movie, because that was the point of the title (that love comes softly), but all the movies have that strange situation where the protagonists suddenly realize they love each other in the last few minutes of the movie (well, mostly the women..the men are pretty clear about their romantic interests).

Other than that continuing strange aspect of these movies, I still enjoyed this movie, independent of the books (having not read any of them).  A couple of sobbing scenes, but  I can really imagine how tough life was for orphans in that (and this) time period.

I liked Dale Midkiff before discovering him in this series, and I have to say, he rocks as a dad in these movies.  I'm really glad he didn't leave the series, like practically all the other actors/actresses (for whatever  reasons).",1228003200,,1017,4.804597701149425

The story from start to finish keeps you drawn in.  You're always wondering what will happen next.  I would recommend this movie and the entire series to anyone who likes a good old fashion love story.  I will watch it again and again.

How bad is it?  We had to turn it off because our wisecracking was waking up the kids.  the plot is weak, the acting is weak, and the movie is not worth watching.  I donated it to the library to spare as many from purchasing it as possible.

2960034,1,B000W089VA,"This movie is so far off from the book, it is infuriating.  To think that they killed off Missie's husband Willie for theatrics and so she could have a new love interest is horrible.  Also, what happened to all of Missie's brothers, and her other children?  In the books, her and Willie stayed at the ranch and raised a very lovely family and prospered on their ranch.  Now, all of the sudden, all of that is gone.  Also, Belinda is Marty and Clark's daughter, who was a late surprise, not an adopted daughter of Missie's.  I couldn't even finish the movie, I was so upset.

2960037,2,B000W089VA,I have to chime in on the other reviews about killing off Willie. He was the character that I kept looking forward to seeing in the movies and by killing him off ruined the movie. He is an excellent actor and gave me the connection I needed form the second movie.  I loved the fact that he and Dale were still in it. The purpose of series are for us to be able to follow the movies and this was a disappointment. I agree with one of the reviews that said can you have him and the orginal Missy come back because someone was dreaming or had amnesia or something. Erin was not a good choice to be substitued for the orginal adult Missy. There are few choices for Family movies out there and I was hoping this one would continue as a series. We as readers and movie goers tend to get attached to the actors that play the characters.  We do realize sometimes there is a time restraint but I know if you made them an offer they can't refuse they would do the series. That is up to you to make it so they will not turn the part down.

I didn't like the third movie and thought it was mostly do to the change in the actress that plays Missie.

The fourth movie was absolutely terrible.  I have little good to say about it.

This is the fifth in the series.  I still didn't like the actress that plays Missie.  However, I felt the story (after I got over the fact of why she was there) was nice.

As far as these being Christian movies, I am unsure.  They do refer to God but since the Christmas scene in the first movie, Christ has not been mentioned.  Many so called religions out there honor God, but have no faith in Jesus our Saviour.",1198454400,3,469,4.247191011235955
2960152,4,B000W089VA,"Like many of the other reviewers, I was hesitant about this movie with as much as it seemed to deviate from the real story and because they killed off Willie.  I wasn't sure how I was going to rate it, but I just saw the new TV release of Love's Unfolding Dream, and Wow! that brought the series back around.  It took this story to set up the really well done version of the next story, which focuses on Elinda and her decision to want to be a doctor.  The humor and strength that comes from a strong-headed, Bible-believing prairie girl that was so endearing in Love Comes Softly is renewed in the newest installment.  If you watch this one with Love's Unfolding Dream, I am sure you will find it worth it to set up this great story, which I feel really redeems the movie series.  Yes, it still deviates from the book, but I feel it captures much more of Janette Oke's spirit of the newest installment.  Love's Unfolding Dream definitely gets five stars from me.  I hope you enjoy these two movies together as much as I did.",1197849600,,1025,4.335078534031414

2960155,5,B000W089VA,"I too have read all of the books in the ""Love"" series, and have seen all of the movies as well.  I LOVED this movie!  It upsets me that there are such negative reviews on here when this film promotes such inspiration and faith.  Every movie based on a book is adapted differently on film.  This is no different.  I felt that the storyline with Missie returning home, adopting a teenager, and learning to love again was very relatable regardless of the differences in time period and setting.  I think many people, including myself, would be able to relate to Missie's struggle to accept change and find her way back with GOD's guidance.  Change is difficult for everyone, and the message in this movie is that we can make it through the hard times and the challenges in life, and that with the grace of GOD we will be led home again.

I would highly recommend this movie to anyone regardless of their faith.  I think that the message is overwhelmingly positive in a world where most movies are dominated by the opposite.  I also highly encourage those who have written a negative review here to watch the movie again with an open mind.  You may find, as I did, that you may even learn something about yourself... and as far as I am concerned that is the greatest lesson of them all.",1197244800,7,1282,4.459227467811159

I do appreciate the production of wholesome family entertainment and I think these Love Come Softly movies have a good message. However, I think it's really unfortunate that with each movie they get further and further away from the words that Janette Oke wrote. Kill off Willie?! :( Janette Oke is a very good author and was the top Canadian author for sales in the late 1980's. She even outsold Margaret Atwood!  I loved the Love Come Softly books. What's really sad is that the writer has borrowed the characters and titles, but has used great poetic license with the stories...so much now that they have ceased to belong to Janette Oke.",1197072000,31,821,4.578231292517007

I have watched this and the other movies on the Hallmark channel and found them truly delightful, entertaining and great for the whole family.  My girls 6 & 3 years love the movies.  We love the Little House on the Prairie series (we own all of them) and this is along the same line as a great family movie.  Clean with no cursing and no risque scenes which is so hard to find.  Highly recommend this movie as a movie not as a movie from a book.  If you like books, just stick to them and judge a movie based on the movie.  It was just based on the characters it is never exactly like the books, just like Little House was not exactly like the books.",1196899200,4,793,4.137254901960785
2960158,3,B000W089VA,"Love's Abiding Joy had a cliffhanger ending, making any additional installment to the series something of a challenge. They decided to go with standard ""love series"" formula: Have someone die. (Someone died in every one of the Love Comes Softly movies -- it just didn't bother us too much because it was never a character we had gotten too attatched to -- until now). Willie has been dead for a few years at the beginning of the movie, and Missy leaves the home they made together in the West to return to her Ma and Pa. The lady who played for Marty exceeded my expectations, but I was put off by the primness of her greeting to Mattie. Other than that one scene I liked her. Dale Midkiff was good, as always. Jeff is out. Missy's beloved brothers make no appearence, and are not even mentioned. That was weird. Though Missy tells Marty in their first heart-to-heart that she can never love someone again, she has not been home for a week before she notices the town's dashing young sherrif. No foreshadowing needed -- we know where this is going . . . The plot takes an imaginative loop with Missy suddenly taking in a teenage girl named Belinda, along with her attitude. Most of the movie is taken up with the highs and lows of their relationship, with brief encounters between Missy and Zach -- the town sherrif. The busy sherrif of course has time to break up fights in the school yard, carry Mattie home after he hurt himself, or help the pretty teacher look for her locket, as he ""just happened"" to be riding by. Belinda at first hides the fact that Jacob, a little boy who was adopted by a hard-nosed farmer, is actually her brother, but eventually reveals the truth when Missy (and Zach) catch her sneeking him food in the night. Then a fight begins to get Jacob away from his abusive gaurdian. Thus, a reason for Missy to cling to Zach for support. Zach himself is a pretty flat character, so the developments between he and Missy are not romantic, though no doubt interesting. Climax comes when, desperate to help her brother, Belinda runs away with him. If not for a miricle in the dark of the rainy night, Zach would not have found them. Jacob tells the truth about what he has been suffering, so the sherrif finially is able to get him away. Missy has been confused by her feelings for Zach, but in the end declares her love for him and they get married. Over all, an acceptable, run of the mill Hallmark release. Not up to par with Love Comes Softly, with the flimsy plot, cheesy dialog, underdeveloped characters, etc; etc. If Love's Unfolding Dream turns out to be as good as the preview looks, I will definately be glad they decided to continue the series instead of ending it with Missy sadly waving goodbye to Clark at the end of Love's Abiding Joy. I enjoyed this in spite of its flaws and reccomend it to fans of the series.",1196899200,2,2846,4.464491362763916

As other reviewers have pointed out,WHY did they have to make Willie die!?! Its like they're trying to repeat the first installment,Love comes sofly,all over again and doing a sorry job at it. They killed off one of the best and most enjoyable actors which left me rather annoyed. Also what happened to some  of the characters,Marty and Clark's kids and Jeff and the ranch hands? No explaination is given about them. That said, it still has some good points, Dale Midkiff has returned in his role as Clark and Christian morals play a big part in the film.",1196812800,4,681,4.491935483870968

Plenty to pick on to be sure, but dang it, that adoption scene in the church was a tearjerker.  And, I kind of like films that are predictable and romantic especially when my wife is getting all caught up in it if you know what I mean.  I want to go back and check out the one with the Grey's Anatomy actress, though how she got from Christian fiction to Knocked Up I'd rather not speculate.  Anyway, certainly worth watching, and if you like these pioneer sagas, worth buying.",1196812800,6,706,4.154411764705882
3194345,2,B000W089VA,"This series started with such promise. I enjoyed the first two movies (granted they more closely followed the books).  Janette Oke wrote such wonderful stories, I really have a hard time understanding why they would make SO many changes.  The actress who plays Missie in this movie does not act emotion very well at all.  Moments that were supposed to be serious were laughably ridiculous because of her demeanor and the faces she would make.  She made the same stern, straight-lined mouth expression for everything, whether she was supposed to be angry, happy or sad.  And I cannot believe that they killed off Willie.  He was the one redeeming character that I was still watching for.  The actor who plays Clark is the only one that has remained the same for the whole series.  (He too makes me laugh because he sometimes morphs into talking like Elvis- as he starred in a TV movie playing Elvis...)

I understand that this is still good family entertainment.  I appreciate the fact that Hallmark is making family and faithful entertainment (hence the two stars rather than one).  I just think that they could be doing a better job.  Ms. Oke wrote great stories- they didn't need to be changed.  Yes, edited for time constraints but that's all that was really necessary.  This story wasn't even a Love Comes Softly book- some of the characters were the same but there the similarities end.  I'm still sad that Katherine Heigl was unable to reprise her role as Marty but I don't blame her for not wanting to be associated with the mediocre movie.  The acting was pretty horrible- I only watched the whole thing to see how they wrapped things up.  The majority of the time, though, I couldn't help laughing about how the story, the facial expressions, the acting - was all supposed to be fairly serious but because the quality and caliber of talent was so low it was laughably ridiculous.  A big disappointment- I would watch this on TV before spending any money on it.  If the same actress is still playing Missy I don't plan on bothering with the rest of the series.  A series of movies that could have been so much better- that's the main reason for my disappointment.  With such a great premise, you wouldn't think it could go so wrong...",1196812800,14,2242,4.653944020356234
3194346,4,B000W089VA,"but not really up to par as far as the story goes. I don't understand why they kill Willie off. It would have been fine on its own. If this movie was a single movie it would have been alright but isn't and can't be thought of like that. Where is the rest of the family? When Missie gets back to her parents place she doesn't even ask about her little brothers and Pa doesn't ask about his grandson, Jeff. That is just too weird!

I was very disappointed with this particular installment.  This was so far away from the book that I didn't recognize it when I watched it. Other than the observations already noted (Belinda as Missie's daughter not sister, etc.), it also seems to have lost her brothers and their adopted son, Jeff.  If there was only about 4 years difference between this movie and the last one, then her brothers would not have been old enough to be out on their own, yet there was no mention that they even exist.  However, I am glad that they are able to keep Dale Midkiff as Clark, but think they could find a better substitute for Katherine Heigl as Marty.  To kill off Willie just to give Missy a new love interest was a travesty.  I gave it two stars and hope if they make the last books, they follow the books as best they can (outside of resurrecting Willie via a dream sequence).",1193270400,52,1063,4.316582914572864

I read the plot on the Hallmark Channel website, and it's TOTALLY messed up:  Missy's husband Willie has died (he was still very much alive at the end of the original 8-book series, as were the 4 children who are non-existent in the movies), and she moves back home to her father's house with her one son and takes in an orphan girl named Belinda.  They've ruined this story so badly, I can't imagine what they might do with the last 3 books (which are ABOUT Missy's BABY SISTER Belinda, not ADOPTED DAUGHTER Belinda)!  And why do they persist in leaving Marty out of the later movies?  3 different people have played Missie so far, surely they could have found a replacement for Katherine Heigl if she's not available to play Marty!

I haven't read the books that this series is based off of, however, I have watched the first four movies in this series.  And, I really enjoyed this one.  I was puzzled by the fact, that in this movie they didn't mention any children on the part of Missie's parents, and I do recall them having had children.  So, that was a loose end that was never addressed in this movie.  However, in this movie, we have Missie returning back to her home after going out even further West with her husband, Willie.  Willie, as the Sheriff, was shot and killed.  And so, Missie returns home to get back to teaching.  It is very nice to see her home again, as her father is such a likeable fellow, that as a viewer, I don't ever want her far away from her Daddy!  As the orphan train comes into town, she adopts a young teenage girl who needs a home.  And the Sheriff helps her with the girl and reuniting the girl with her brother.  And, I have to say, the Sheriff in this film was very romantically and handsomely portrayed by the fellow (I'm not familiar with the actor).  And Missie is one of the luckiest ladies in literature to have such handsome Sheriffs continually in love with her.  :)  On a serious note, though, in this movie, especially, it felt like the actors were just modern people in old timey attire.  In fact, they seem so modern, sometimes one doesn't even notice the old timey attire.  As they don't even attempt to have a time period appropriate dialogue nor mannerisms.  That is a flaw in this show that I hope they take more seriously and remedy in the future.  Otherwise, it is clean and wholesome and a nice soothing movie to relax with.",1458691200,,1785,4.44

Most people would skip it because they think it is too predictable or ""lame"", but I like movies like that because I know I will be watching something that won't make me feel like I have just been ""slimed"".  The Dove Foundation gave it a five star and approved it for ages 12 and older.

I don't like the entire series, several are a little boring and it seems that Janette Oke has a thing with killing off the husbands and having the women remarry. So I only watch certain ones. Love Begins first (since is covers how the ""Love Comes Softly"" saga began), second is Love Comes Softly, third is Love's Enduring Promise, fourth is Love's Unending Legacy, and 5th is Love's Unfolding Dream. They are all amazing, really clean, high morals, family friendly, inspiring, and focuses on the more important things in life.

Two years have passed since the tragic death of Missie LaHaye's husband Willie. Unable to work the land on her own, Missie and son Maddie leave there home to go back to her father's ranch.  She becomes a school teacher again and tries to start a new life, even though she still has nightmares about her husband's death.  An orphan train comes to town and even though she is determined not to take one in, something makes take in a fourteen year old girl who no ones else wants.  The transition is difficult, especially when the girl sees that another family is mistreating her brother, whom the family adopted. Missie attempts to prove the boy is being mistreated, and at the same time she attempts to fight her feelings for the town sheriff, Zach.

Overall, I really love this move and will definitely watch it over and over again.",1372636800,2,2138,4.436224489795919

3194472,2,B000W089VA,"Warning spoiler alert I must say I love the beginning, very touching as she sits at Willie's grave.  When I found out in the book that Willie doesn't die, my opinion of the movie went down because I see that Willie could have lived. Her she was with a beautiful relationship with a guy she loved only for him to die and her to marry a guy that seemed to just be there.  Zack is not a good replacement for Willie. Unless they made a very good romance between them, they shouldn't have killed Willie off.  As other people said Missy did not know Zach long before she fell in love and it seems like it only took days for Missy to fall for him.  Here she is still mourning her late husband, knowing that she will never love anyone else as much, when a random guy comes along doesn't do anything special and she falls for him.  At least in Love Comes Softly there is a story behind how Marty falls in love with Clark, here there is nothing.  I thought it would take more then a single guy being there for her to fall in love with him.  Plus this struck, why would she want to marry another sheriff, who could meet the fate as Willie?  Where she would have to worry over him all the time, him being a sheriff didn't seem to bug her at all.  The parts where she talked about Willie were more touching then all the scenes with Zach, other then when she tells Zack about Willie.",1344297600,,1369,4.15530303030303

3194493,3,B000W089VA,"Love's Abidiing Joy, the previous installment of the Love Series, was a laughable crash of an adapation. This installment is a vast improvement over LAJ. A director who has kept the situations heartfelt and real. Material that may veer toward mauldlin, but knows just when to cut back in order to keep it real. While there seems to be questions with some liberties take from the book, on it's own the film works fairly well. One of my sticking points is the abrupt dismissal of Missie's first husband, in a poorly reenactment of his death. Once that is over, the film begins to gain it's track and right itself from his previous quality detour. Whereas the loss of a infant child is handled poorly in the previous film, this time around, it is dealt with with much humanity, poignancy and in a realistic manner. Kudos to the writer in the scene relating the loss of a child and tying it in beautifully with the new installment. Glad to see the series right itself and begin to get back on track with this installment. While far from the best (see LOVE COMES SOFTLY), it is a fine sequel (5th!) and makes you want to continue the sage. Thanks Mark Griffin for returning to the humanity of the situation and getting the series out of it's laughable detour of Love's Abiding Joy (do we really find abiding Joy in dreadful laughable films?????!)",1248048000,,1341,4.591666666666667

3194495,2,B000W089VA,"First off, I don't think this movie is horrible. This was my first exposure to the series (I haven't read Janette Oke's books) and on my first viewing I thought it was a nice, enjoyable movie. Then I watched a few of the others and rewatched this one again, and it leaves me shaking my head. Why kill off Willie? As many viewers have said over and over, he was an excellent character, and the actor did a wonderful job of creating a soft-spoken, hard working, loving man--perfect romance hero material. Viewers have gone through three movies with this character/actor and have made a deep connection with him, and suddenly he's gone? Personally I mourned the character's demise more than his wife apparently did--she was primed and ready for romance with ANOTHER sheriff. The fact that Willie is alive in the book series makes the director/producer/screenwriters' decision all that more deplorable.

If they needed to get Missie back to Anderson Corner to renunite with her mother and father there were a number of ways to do that without killing off Willie. If Logan Bartholomew wasn't available for this movie, I think Victor Browne would have worked as a recast. His character was a carbon copy of Willie anyway. And at least make a mention of Jeff and Colette, and Cookie and Scottie. Leaving viewers to wonder what happened is lazy and disrespectful to those who have invested time in watching and buying the movie.

All these complaints aside, I do think more sweet, clean movies need to be produced. There is an audience that craves family and faith based entertainment. However, film makers don't need to sacrifice quality, as they did with this movie.",1240012800,,1660,4.841549295774648

I give every one in the series a five star rating but my favorite is Love's Long Journey.,1229990400,,416,3.8705882352941177
3194498,3,B000W089VA,"I've watched all the previous movies, so was interested to see this one also.  Like all the previous movies, though, there seems to be a certain lack of romance between the protagonists.

You could almost excuse the first movie, because that was the point of the title (that love comes softly), but all the movies have that strange situation where the protagonists suddenly realize they love each other in the last few minutes of the movie (well, mostly the women..the men are pretty clear about their romantic interests).

Other than that continuing strange aspect of these movies, I still enjoyed this movie, independent of the books (having not read any of them).  A couple of sobbing scenes, but  I can really imagine how tough life was for orphans in that (and this) time period.

I liked Dale Midkiff before discovering him in this series, and I have to say, he rocks as a dad in these movies.  I'm really glad he didn't leave the series, like practically all the other actors/actresses (for whatever  reasons).",1228003200,,1017,4.804597701149425

He was the character that I kept looking forward to seeing in the movies and by killing him off ruined the movie. He is an excellent actor and gave me the connection I needed form the second movie.  I loved the fact that he and Dale were still in it. The purpose of series are for us to be able to follow the movies and this was a disappointment. I agree with one of the reviews that said can you have him and the orginal Missy come back because someone was dreaming or had amnesia or something. Erin was not a good choice to be substitued for the orginal adult Missy. There are few choices for Family movies out there and I was hoping this one would continue as a series. We as readers and movie goers tend to get attached to the actors that play the characters.  We do realize sometimes there is a time restraint but I know if you made them an offer they can't refuse they would do the series. That is up to you to make it so they will not turn the part down.

Then the actress they cast to play Marty was terrible, she did not bring that spunk and inner fire to the part the way Katherine Heigel did. Finally, what happen to the virtues Missy had instilled in her? I was quite surprised to see her kiss the sheriff, if you remember in the 2nd one she felt that she should only kiss the man she would marry and not before marriage! I know it's only a kiss, but remember this is not set in the 21st century. The ONLY redeeming quality this has is my favorite DALE MIDKIFF. He is a great actor, when you get pass all the facial nuiances! In short I will not be purchasing this one for my girls.",1200441600,,788,4.225165562913907

Dale Midkiff and Erin Cottrell (Clark & Missie) thankfully continue on in this installment, providing continuity to the series.  Yes, as many other reviewers have expressed, I too miss Katherine Heigl as Marty but nonetheless the woman chosen to play Marty did a fine and believable job of portraying a slightly older, mature Marty.  The acting in this latest series was much improved over the prior 2, and I found the story held my interest and was not disappointed in the least.

As far as these being Christian movies, I am unsure.  They do refer to God but since the Christmas scene in the first movie, Christ has not been mentioned.  Many so called religions out there honor God, but have no faith in Jesus our Saviour.",1198454400,3,469,4.247191011235955
3194649,4,B000W089VA,"Like many of the other reviewers, I was hesitant about this movie with as much as it seemed to deviate from the real story and because they killed off Willie.  I wasn't sure how I was going to rate it, but I just saw the new TV release of Love's Unfolding Dream, and Wow! that brought the series back around.  It took this story to set up the really well done version of the next story, which focuses on Elinda and her decision to want to be a doctor.  The humor and strength that comes from a strong-headed, Bible-believing prairie girl that was so endearing in Love Comes Softly is renewed in the newest installment.  If you watch this one with Love's Unfolding Dream, I am sure you will find it worth it to set up this great story, which I feel really redeems the movie series.  Yes, it still deviates from the book, but I feel it captures much more of Janette Oke's spirit of the newest installment.  Love's Unfolding Dream definitely gets five stars from me.  I hope you enjoy these two movies together as much as I did.",1197849600,,1025,4.335078534031414

3194651,4,B000W089VA,"This is a great movie.

Let's be honest, Heigl set the bar pretty high but this carries through the timeless message.

3194652,5,B000W089VA,"I too have read all of the books in the ""Love"" series, and have seen all of the movies as well.  I LOVED this movie!  It upsets me that there are such negative reviews on here when this film promotes such inspiration and faith.  Every movie based on a book is adapted differently on film.  This is no different.  I felt that the storyline with Missie returning home, adopting a teenager, and learning to love again was very relatable regardless of the differences in time period and setting.  I think many people, including myself, would be able to relate to Missie's struggle to accept change and find her way back with GOD's guidance.  Change is difficult for everyone, and the message in this movie is that we can make it through the hard times and the challenges in life, and that with the grace of GOD we will be led home again.

I would highly recommend this movie to anyone regardless of their faith.  I think that the message is overwhelmingly positive in a world where most movies are dominated by the opposite.  I also highly encourage those who have written a negative review here to watch the movie again with an open mind.  You may find, as I did, that you may even learn something about yourself... and as far as I am concerned that is the greatest lesson of them all.",1197244800,7,1282,4.459227467811159

I do appreciate the production of wholesome family entertainment and I think these Love Come Softly movies have a good message. However, I think it's really unfortunate that with each movie they get further and further away from the words that Janette Oke wrote. Kill off Willie?! :( Janette Oke is a very good author and was the top Canadian author for sales in the late 1980's. She even outsold Margaret Atwood!  I loved the Love Come Softly books. What's really sad is that the writer has borrowed the characters and titles, but has used great poetic license with the stories...so much now that they have ceased to belong to Janette Oke.",1197072000,31,821,4.578231292517007

I have watched this and the other movies on the Hallmark channel and found them truly delightful, entertaining and great for the whole family.  My girls 6 & 3 years love the movies.  We love the Little House on the Prairie series (we own all of them) and this is along the same line as a great family movie.  Clean with no cursing and no risque scenes which is so hard to find.  Highly recommend this movie as a movie not as a movie from a book.  If you like books, just stick to them and judge a movie based on the movie.  It was just based on the characters it is never exactly like the books, just like Little House was not exactly like the books.",1196899200,4,793,4.137254901960785
3194655,3,B000W089VA,"Love's Abiding Joy had a cliffhanger ending, making any additional installment to the series something of a challenge. They decided to go with standard ""love series"" formula: Have someone die. (Someone died in every one of the Love Comes Softly movies -- it just didn't bother us too much because it was never a character we had gotten too attatched to -- until now). Willie has been dead for a few years at the beginning of the movie, and Missy leaves the home they made together in the West to return to her Ma and Pa. The lady who played for Marty exceeded my expectations, but I was put off by the primness of her greeting to Mattie. Other than that one scene I liked her. Dale Midkiff was good, as always. Jeff is out. Missy's beloved brothers make no appearence, and are not even mentioned. That was weird. Though Missy tells Marty in their first heart-to-heart that she can never love someone again, she has not been home for a week before she notices the town's dashing young sherrif. No foreshadowing needed -- we know where this is going . . . The plot takes an imaginative loop with Missy suddenly taking in a teenage girl named Belinda, along with her attitude. Most of the movie is taken up with the highs and lows of their relationship, with brief encounters between Missy and Zach -- the town sherrif. The busy sherrif of course has time to break up fights in the school yard, carry Mattie home after he hurt himself, or help the pretty teacher look for her locket, as he ""just happened"" to be riding by. Belinda at first hides the fact that Jacob, a little boy who was adopted by a hard-nosed farmer, is actually her brother, but eventually reveals the truth when Missy (and Zach) catch her sneeking him food in the night. Then a fight begins to get Jacob away from his abusive gaurdian. Thus, a reason for Missy to cling to Zach for support. Zach himself is a pretty flat character, so the developments between he and Missy are not romantic, though no doubt interesting. Climax comes when, desperate to help her brother, Belinda runs away with him. If not for a miricle in the dark of the rainy night, Zach would not have found them. Jacob tells the truth about what he has been suffering, so the sherrif finially is able to get him away. Missy has been confused by her feelings for Zach, but in the end declares her love for him and they get married. Over all, an acceptable, run of the mill Hallmark release. Not up to par with Love Comes Softly, with the flimsy plot, cheesy dialog, underdeveloped characters, etc; etc. If Love's Unfolding Dream turns out to be as good as the preview looks, I will definately be glad they decided to continue the series instead of ending it with Missy sadly waving goodbye to Clark at the end of Love's Abiding Joy.

As other reviewers have pointed out,WHY did they have to make Willie die!?! Its like they're trying to repeat the first installment,Love comes sofly,all over again and doing a sorry job at it. They killed off one of the best and most enjoyable actors which left me rather annoyed. Also what happened to some  of the characters,Marty and Clark's kids and Jeff and the ranch hands? No explaination is given about them.
