8131486,4,B000GFLKI0,"The anime Tokyo Underground hasn't had much luck, and has largely gone unnoticed. Nevertheless, it's a fun shonen series that will reward viewers who have a bit of patience.

The premise of Tokyo Underground is cool: hidden beneath Tokyo is an underground city many levels deep, which has been cut off from the surface for years, and our heroes have to go questing through it. The problem with the execution of the show is that at the start it takes place mostly ABOVE-ground, with more of an emphasis on comedy (from the hero's dojo-running grandpappy). My theory is that the ratings dropped because of this misdirection, leading to the show being cancelled even though it gets better after this weak start.

And indeed it DOES get better. There is a good variety of likeable characters whose agendas slowly become known, and although the show was made on a TV budget, you really get the sense of a vast mysterious labyrinth. The ending is undeniably a bit rushed - you can tell they had a lot more story and exploration planned before the climax, but they manage to tie things up in an acceptable fashion.

It is a shame this show was cancelled, as it had potential for a couple more seasons. It would be nice if someone tried remaking it, maybe with a slightly grittier, more realistic feel (not too gritty, or it would end up being like Texhnolyze). In the meantime, this is a great investment if you can get it at a reasonable price. I've watched it three times so far.",1329696000,4,1474,4.596958174904943

This is an amazing action, comedy, and fun packed series with a great plot, it is one of the best animes I have ever watched and owned I am very happy

In this you will find the voices of David Kaye, Sesshoumaru. Paul dobson, Naraku. And Kirby Morrow, Miroku used in the Inuyasha series I was quite pleased with this unexpected little surprise. David Kaye is the voice of the bad boy and the one plotting to sacrifice Ruri in this series he is deliciously evil",1328313600,,1626,4.398671096345515
