5085729,5,B007GQMANG,"A wonderful, informative, and inspiring DVD. The detail is amazing!  A great addition to any artists library. You get to learn from one of the legendary movie poster artists of all time!!",1336003200,,187,4.84375
5085730,5,B007GQMANG,It's an amazing gift that the legendary film poster artist Drew Struzan has shared with fans and aspiring artists in this DVD. A fantastic and informative DVD that takes you right from the starting point of ideas to the finished work with such clarity. I have used this DVD to teach college level art courses and have learned so many valuable tools to use in my own work. It's a difference maker and makes an impact on many levels.,1332374400,4,431,4.468354430379747
5085731,3,B007GQMANG,"The Good: Beautifully shot instructional DVD.  Drew Struzan does an exceptional job at narrating himself through the initial concept design stages to finalizing the painting.  There are plenty of creative techniques that any acrylic artist can appreciate and Drew's thoughts on design, the creative process and the mindset of a professional illustrator are both insightful and inspiring.

The Bad: DVD quality shot in old 4:3 standard (not 16:9 that all modern HDTVs display).  Meaning if you have an HDTV, the displayed aspect ratio will be boxed in the center of the screen, like your watching an old pre-2003 TV show on Hulu or Netflix.  Although Drew shares many techniques, this DVD runs only about an hour an half, so there is a lot of information missing that would be beneficial to beginners to intermediate viewers.  Such as, there is no information given on mixing or rendering flesh-tones and no explanations/commentary of basic color theory.

The Ugly:  80 bucks for an hour and a half standard definition 480p DVD shot in old 4:3! Come on guys!  Drew's work is awesome and his insights are amazing, but 80 bucks is just too high for a standard definition DVD shot in 4:3. I could see paying 80 bucks if shot in 16:9 on full 1080p HD blu-ray with a 3 hour running time.  As it is, this DVD should be priced at about 30 bucks max. I'm just grateful I used a gift card for nearly the full amount.  One of the reviews rebutted about the high price comparing the DVD as to going to a workshop.  That is false, as you cannot ask a DVD questions and get a reply.  A DVD is still just a DVD and can't replace the experience of a live workshop with a master painter.",1421107200,15,1670,4.563758389261745
5085732,5,B007GQMANG,Excellent DVD from one of the greatest Illustrators of our time! A great step by step video class;Highly recommendable!,1420761600,,119,5.315789473684211

5085735,5,B007GQMANG,"Highly recommended!  Unlike 98% of the 'art instruction' DVDs out there - most of which do indeed contain good information - this one is set apart because it doesn't put you to sleep!  Not only do we get insights into Drew's process, but the film is MOTIVATING!  You cannot watch this and not want to head into the studio with your hair on fire.  Buy!",1405468800,,351,4.3538461538461535
5085736,5,B007GQMANG,Best demonstration video I've ever bought. Drew shows how it's done and makes it look easy. It will definitely help my work.,1400112000,,124,4.681818181818182
5085737,5,B007GQMANG,"This DVD is amazing. Too bad its so hard to find a copy of. This movie shows Drew Srtuzan at his best going through his process of creating a film poster, from concept through execution to the final product. Truly a must have for any beginning to professional artist.",1398211200,,267,4.469387755102041
5085738,5,B007GQMANG,"A well-done recording of Drew Struzan sharing his process. The documentary about Mr. Struzan on Netflix made me want to find more out about him and how he did these iconic movie posters/covers I've loved since I was a kid. I found out about this DVD on Mr. Struzan's site, I saved up for it and finally got it.

If the price is causing you to hesitate, take a look at it this way: you're not just paying for a DVD. If Mr. Struzan offered a workshop, you need to pay for his time and what you learn by the end, right? Add in the cost of the DVD, say $20 (the same price you'd probably pay these days for a movie that you love), it makes sense. Of course, I want to have had more time on the DVD, but that's a fan and artist thing.",1397952000,,729,3.9591836734693877
5085739,5,B007GQMANG,"Drew Struzan is the greatest movie poster artist of the past 30+ years.

Artists: watch, and learn from a legendary artist at the peak of his career.",1394841600,,286,4.627450980392157

5085742,5,B007GQMANG,"This video was perfect for someone like me.  As an illustrator, it was so informative to see, step by step, how a top professional produces a movie poster from conceptual work, materials used, right up to the finished product.  As an art teacher, I'm sure the students will be amazed at Drew Struzan's talent but will also be inspired to create their own work.  Drew has an easygoing style of explaining his techniques that demystifies the process.  I loved this video.  My only complaint was the cost but it was worth it.",1392681600,,522,4.630434782608695
5085743,5,B007GQMANG,This is an amazing DVD. A must see. I believe that anyone who admires Drew Struzan would be in awe of this DVD.,1367712000,,111,3.869565217391304

5085745,5,B007GQMANG,"This is an exceptional teaching video for beginning and experienced artists who wish to advance their skills two hundred fold.  Congratulations to the artist, Drew Struzan, and the director, James Sanders.  They both did an incredible job.",1339891200,2,239,5.4324324324324325
5085746,5,B007GQMANG,"Drew Struzan needs no introduction!

Together with the awesomely talented people over at ReelIdeas (THANKS!!), we get the chance to enter Drew's private studio, where some of the world's most iconic artworks have been conceived. We get to sit and watch the master at work, from start to finish.

As an artist myself, I have learned a lot from this DVD. I can definitely say that my artworks have improved. I just love Drew's technique. Apart from technique, it is also nice to get an insight on Drew's thought process while creating his art.

As someone who will rather watch the ""Behind the scenes"" of a movie, than the actually movie, this DVD is heaven on earth!! It is definitely the ""holy grail"" in my DVD collection, and certainly the one I've watched the most of all...and I will continue to do so!

This is a must have to all artists and Drew Struzan fans...or anyone who has a love for art! Amazing production. Amazing Art.
A very informative DVD.

Thanks Drew...and of course...thanks ReelIdeas!

5085750,5,B007GQMANG,"Great tool for both professional and classroom work. Mr. Struzen is a master at explaining technique in detail. In addition, the production value of this work is what blew me away.  Its an extraordinary to watch. A master artist paired with brilliant production and editing, made this a gem for both professional and budding artists.

It seems that another of Amazon's DVDs are produced by the same team.

The video is clear and aside from 1 rushed section, the jist of his process is included. You will get a good perspective of the process, so I recommend it to any artist.",1476403200,,297,4.418181818181818
8516472,5,B007GQMANG,"I love this video! I am an amateur artist who prefers realism. Like Drew, I am more skilled at drawing than airbrush painting, but can do both. I have always been a big fan of Drew's work and style and wanted to know some of his secrets to produce pieces in a way similar to his. This video gives you those secrets. Obviously you have to have natural talent and acquired skills to emulate his techniques, but following along to this video can open vast new creative abilities for inspired artists. Drew shows you his method step by step, and even provides a list of his tools and products at the end. I really had no questions remaining after watching this video. And I have watched it multiple times just so the knowledge could become more deeply ingrained in my artistic cache.  I have created 3 large mixed media paintings since purchasing this video and they have all incorporated things I learned from watching the master work. Thank you Drew for putting this out there! This amateur artist could not appreciate this video any more.",1467763200,,1037,4.605405405405405

8516477,5,B007GQMANG,This is great. Wish it was longer with more details and blue ray would've been nice. A dvd case would have been better than the paper sleeve for the money but overall great. Thanks Drew,1449014400,,185,4.314285714285714
