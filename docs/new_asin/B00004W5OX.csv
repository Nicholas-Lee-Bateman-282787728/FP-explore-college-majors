If you want a truly well rounded view of cinema, throw this into your collection, it'll take you a direction almost nothing else can. Love, love, love. $23 of the best dollars I've ever spent as an art lover.",1296518400,,325,4.344262295081967
8620275,4,B00004W5OX,"First hearing of Nick Zedd through it's ""Cinema of Transgression"" video, released in the UK by the BFI, he is a director who has really grown on me. This auteur is a genius.
Always a theme of sexuality in his films, not just the act but also the display, his films also pose problems for audiences. If you have been a longstanding, hardcore fan of Zedd, the meaning he conveys would come through much easily. For total novices, his films are hard, nigh impossible to understand or comprehend. So it's worth bearing in mind, that these films force you to think rather than think for you.
Why Do You Exist? is one such film. It poses the question, why do you exist? Alas a film about existentialism, sexuality is a main current theme. Whoregasm is difficult to watch, with it's explicit sexual imagery but has an important point. It links sex with film making, is shot as if it were a hardcore porn film juxtaposed with psychedelic graphics and images so breaks down the eroticism, presenting the sexual act as a set of mechanisms. Police State does not have the theme of sexuality, but concentrates on police brutality in capitalist America. It's more political than artistic and the film was loosely based on experiences of Zedd and his friends. An anti-capitalist film, it is even more relevant now than before.
The running time is for 89 mins and the set of films contained in this video is enough to convert the most conservative film fan. Enjoy.
This video contains scenes of violence and explicit sex you may find disturbing.",996192000,,1530,4.691449814126394
