8076895,5,B000AA4PCE,"I love this drama, it was Ahn Jae Wook's first drama as the main male character, his performance is excellent as are the ones by Choi Jin Sil and Cha In Pyo.  Ahn Jae Wook's singing is an added bonus.  It is understandable how this drama launched his singing and composing career.",1367798400,,280,4.365384615384615
8076896,5,B000AA4PCE,"Star in My Heart was done a few years ago when Ahn Jae Wook was young and, I suspect, just beginning to be  recognized as the huge singer/composer/actor he has become.  The story involves the struggles of young hopefuls who want to be entertainers, as well as the usual obstacles and sad love stories which seem to plague all the characters in Korean dramas; but, there is some comedy injected occasionally to keep it from being a complete ""downer.""  Note particularly, the last song in the drama, called ""Forever"", which Ahn Jae Wook sings and, incidentally, composed.  This show will take the viewer back to the experience of falling in love for the first time.",1348185600,3,663,4.739130434782608
8076897,5,B000AA4PCE,"Do not let product of 1997 fools you. I purchased this in February 2008. This is one of the very quality series that i own and I own some of the very good ones such as: winter sonata, stairway to heaven, hotelier ....... the 3 main characters are good looking, good actors and have the movie star quality about them. unlike some of the new series today where the actors are so unattractive and couldn't act.",1204329600,11,407,4.368421052631579
8076898,4,B000AA4PCE,"This drama is a little cheesy and dated, but if you suspend your cynicism for a little while, the story itself is really well told.  It's the traditional poor but happy orphan girl falling in love with a rock star story, but the characters are a little different.  Choi JinShil's character is not the simpering MarySue that is the fatal flaw of a lot of these dramas.  She has a fiery little temper and fights back quite a bit, it's amusing to see her get all wound up.  Kang Min, played by Ahn Jae Wook, is suitably dreamy with rough edges.  His music is gorgeous.  It may take two or three episodes to get into it, but I don't think anyone would regret watching this classic, heart-wrenching tale.",1170979200,12,699,4.421875
8076899,4,B000AA4PCE,Just watched this movie...It's a nice love story...I can't say great (only because it didn't quite end the way I'd hoped it would end)...That's just me... The songs played in the movie are really good (even if you don't understand Korean...the songs will speak to you)  If you want to watch a nice love story...this is one of them.....Don't forget to buy the sound track to this movie...you won't regret it!,1155427200,8,407,4.732394366197183
