7432577,4,B015D443A0,"Unfortunately I wanted to see more guitars than close up's but that is the way the setup was that day.
To much faces and to few guitars. The rest is the Rolling Stones, great show and great song versions, to me Let Me Go is the greatest version, even better than the one in 1981 package. During more than one guitar solo, the camera is not even close to Keith or Ronnie, you are really expecting to watch the guitar solos, but does not happen. Examples are Tumbling dice, Honky Tonk Woman: In this one just during the solo, the camera is taking Chuck Lavelle hands playing the cowbell !! Seriously ?, what they were thinking.
 Of course Richard Havers is not a golfer, his comments inside the package's brochure about Jagger's outfit are good, but those are more likely football pants than baseball pants (this is just for fun, is not important at all).
Is good to have this one, sound is really good and the CD's are great recorded, after all, how many times can someone watch the video?",1448668800,,988,4.458563535911602
7432578,4,B015D443A0,"The ""Vault"" series continues with another fine release from 1982.  It's very nice to finally see some video in good quality from this tour but I'm going to have to pick it apart a little.  The video is obviously the edit from the actual concert that day.  It has many close-ups of the band which absolutely makes sense if you were there watching the Jumbotron in the audience from a quarter mile away.  But at home on the TV it gets just a little annoying.  Also, Bobby K. and Gene B. are on the screen for way too many minutes.  They're both great and again this makes sense the day of the concert but now at home 30+ years later I'd rather see Keith and the boys featured a little more.  Other than those minor flaws the show is pretty darn good.

The sound is absolutely perfect on the video and CD and features some nice renditions of some classics.  Check out the 3 guitar onslaught of ""When the Whip Comes Down"" and a nice version of ""Neighbors.""  Bill Wyman's rare bass sole during ""Miss You"" is a nice treat and ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"" features some very nice solo work from Ronnie.  And unlike the Hampton release you can actually hear the keyboards on this show!  Bobby Keys plays some amazing cowbell during ""Honky Tonk Women"" too !  - be sure to check it out and you'll see what I mean about the ""concert day"" video editing.  Cowbell shots during almost the entire song instead of close-ups on the guitars?  I can just see some young, spotty faced producer back then screaming ""gimme more cowbell !!!!""

Packaging is like the others in the series but this one doesn't feature anything really of substance in the liner notes.  And the obligatory LP release is to follow soon I'm sure.  Be sure to grab this one up and give it a listen.",1448409600,9,1759,4.3765432098765435
7432579,5,B015D443A0,Stu's last show. Epic performance. The boys are really on fire here.,1447977600,,68,4.75
7432580,4,B015D443A0,"The audio on this set is a fun listen. The band is crisp, albeit fast on some songs. The sound quality and mix is pleasing. BUT -

The direction on the video is awful. WAY too many tight shots on their faces, no intuition in cutting (tight shot on piano keys during Keith's intro licks to ""Tumbling Dice - really?) and no flow, rhyme or reason to panning and/or angles. Actually worse than ""Ladies and Gentlemen, The Rolling Stones"" - something I thought wasn't possible.

I've really enjoyed the ""From The Vault"" series and this is worth the money (I like Blu Ray audio) if you are a Stones fan - but don't come into this thinking the video is anything other than the polar opposite of ""Shine A Light.""",1447977600,12,703,4.4
7432581,3,B015D443A0,"It's pretty good, but not as good as ""Hampton 1981,"" ""Some Girls Live in Texas 1978"" and ""Ladies and Gentlemen .... The Rolling Stones."" There's a nice energy to the performance, and Bill Wyman's bass sound is prominently featured without drowning out the work of Keith Richards and Ron Wood. But four or five songs in, the viewer will begin feeling a sense of claustrophobia, as the cameras crop the musicians too tightly. We get lots of shots of Bill Wyman, a super rarity in the Stones world, but most of the shots crop out his bass, his hands and everything else below his neck. We are served with lots and lots of head shots of Bill and Keith. I don't know if it's a zooming effect by the DVD authors, or if it really was shot that way. It's not a horrible live document - the sound is decent - but I really want to see more of Keith's and Bill's fingers and instruments.",1447977600,7,876,4.315151515151515
7432582,4,B015D443A0,"The Rolling Stones are systematically releasing audio/video sets of shows that were available as downloads on Google Play back in 2012. The only two missing are Brussels 1973 (which did get a pricey limited-edition box set treatment) and the Toronto Phoenix club show that preceded the Bigger Band tour. Hopefully those two will soon follow.

Fans complained when this show was available on Google Play because the Hampton 81 had been released previously. This show does have a historical significance, as it is the last live performance of Ian Stewart with the band. Stu died of a heart attack in 1985 and truly, the Stones have not been the same since. If you have the Hampton 81 show and you're not a collector then maybe you might pass on this. Stones collectors will need to pick up on this one (and don't tell me how you've had this on bootleg since the days of cassette tapes - nobody cares so stop bragging). The set list is essentially the same as Hampton with three exceptions. Angie is not on Hampton, and Waiting On A Friend and Let It Bleed are missing here. The performance as I have heard it on Google Play is as tight as you would expect from this tour.

What I particularly love about the 81-82 tour is that it was what I would call the last ""pure"" Stones tour. No back up singers. No inflatables. No massive stage. Just the Stones with Stu, Mac and Bobby, plus Ernie Watts on sax. Keith and Ron sing back up vocals, which they never did again after this tour. And it was my first Stones tour (Chicago Rosemont Horizon '81).",1445385600,64,1541,4.5
7432583,3,B015D443A0,"This is a good show for that particular era, but as others have mentioned, the director seemed to be only interetsed in showing the performers' faces.  Weird.  Did the director think this was some avant garde play or something?  :)",1471046400,,231,4.725
7432584,3,B015D443A0,"I really wish I could rate this one higher, because I really enjoy watching these old Stones concerts.  What's frustrating with this concert video is that there are TOO MANY close-ups of the band members, and not enough shots of the actual performance.  Instead of seeing Keith power away on guitar, we get a shot of Keith's face. Same with Ronnie, and it is especially true with Bill. The bass player is always the least-animated performer to begin with, but for some reason the director thought we needed dozens of cuts of Bill's face instead of his finger-work. Lots of close-ups, not enough footage of the actual action.

The music, of course, is awesome, and this concert is significant because it is Ian Stewart's final live performance. But if you want a definitive example of what the live Rolling Stones '81-'82 concert looked like, go with Live at Hampton Coliseum '81.",1470009600,,879,4.80794701986755
7432585,1,B015D443A0,Buy the fabulous Hampton roads show or the excellent let's spend the night together. Avoid this. Whoever filmed this show did a lousey job. Great sound.,1469664000,,152,4.884615384615385

7432590,5,B015D443A0,Great great show!  Mick and the boys are in high energy from start to finish! Dvd is great to watch as well. I prefer this release to the Hampton 81 release but that is a matter of opinion. This release is worth purchasing if you are the polished Stones fan. You won't be dissapointed!,1457308800,,285,4.277777777777778
7432591,1,B015D443A0,"As others have said, the music is great.  As a CD it would be awesome.  As a DVD it is terrible.  Either the cameramen or editor had a fixation on Wyman's stoic mug.  Very, very little guitar action seen.  Very little crowd action seen.  A few seconds of Jagger prancing around, but mostly it is mug shot after mug shot.  Listen to it, don't look at it..",1457222400,3,354,4.1940298507462686

7432596,1,B015D443A0,"Hate it Hate it Hate it. Once again, some jerk with a camera that is completely clueless at to how to film a rock n roll show. Coulda been great, but whoever the pinhead was that filmed this, he basically ruined what could have been an amazing film to watch if shot correctly. Sure the quality is there, but once again, most of the shots are tight on Mick, and even when you see the rest of the band, they too are shot way to tight. Someone said, when he would shoot Bill, it looked like he was just standing there posing with the wind blowing in his hair. Looks like s freaking hair spray commercial. Wouldn't it be great to see a show of this caliber, where you actually see everyone playing there instruments at length without all these fast cut aways. I shot film of some of these shows and that's exactly what I did. I have amazing shots of the entire band where they are not only tight shots, but plenty of shots from the knees up. I just wish I could have been the one in charge of shooting this show, then you would have had a masterpiece. You know what it's like to sit  thru an entire show like this and you keep thinking all the way thru, okay, now the guys is gonna zoom out a bit and we can see some guitar playing at length? Nope, not with this pinhead that shot it. If you must see it, my guess is you'll watch it maybe once. Not the kind of DVD for when people come over and you're gonna want to pop this on the giant flat screen.",1452297600,10,1446,4.073684210526316
7432597,1,B015D443A0,"Bought blu-ray. Sound quality is awful. There's a lot of bass on the DTS track but if you turn that down it sounds like something's wrong. I had to check my sound system to make sure IT wasn't the problem. Using the stereo LPCM only makes it worse. Was there a screw up at the factory? The problem does make ""When The Whip Comes Down"" an interesting mix as it sounds like the main guitar riff is missing. The whole thing is sort of like going to a concert in a stadium with bad acoustics.
And then there's the visuals. Too many close ups. If they gave me a nickel for every shot of Bill Wyman looking to his right with the wind blowing in his hair, I would not only get the disc for free,  I think they may owe me. People talk and joke about Kieth and Bill but I think they're the best looking ones in the bunch, mind you!",1450742400,3,822,4.042944785276074
7432598,4,B015D443A0,"This is my first From the Vault purchase, inspired mostly as I am a long time Stones Fan and just saw them for the first time this year on the Zip Code tour.  They still put on a great show now but always nice to see them back in the day.  I recommend this disc mostly for the CD and always looking to add to my collection.  The Blu Ray concert video is very good quality, as mentioned some flaws with the filming for sure but the picture is very clean.  This was not my favorite Stones period of songs as probably with most Stones fans but my favorite was the long jazzy version of Beasts of Burden.  I definitely recommend this one.",1450310400,,634,4.121951219512195
7432599,5,B015D443A0,"This was a stellar show----and for good reason! It was the last show of the tour. The band roars with an incredible sound and awesome performance that's up there as one of their career's best! This concert has stellar sound and performance on songs like 20 Flight Rock, Little T and A,  Let me go, Hang fire, she's so cold, start me up. I believe this performance was far better then the Hampton '81 show. Even Woody plays well at this Leeds '82  show, slamming the tremolo bar to make that strat scream. What's wrong with you naysayers? Every time the Stones play Leeds in the Midlands it's an epoch recorded event. Remember the spring '71 ""leaving England"" show? That show was historic too! This concert for me was one of my faves along with Tokyo '95, MSG '69, Brussels Affair '73...those tours and shows all stood out to me as being Stone's exemplars for sound quality and performance.",1449964800,8,889,4.584905660377358
7432600,1,B015D443A0,"Awful!!! the video and audio quality are fine but who ever filmed this show had no idea what they were doing. Most of the  shots of the performers is from the chest up with no showing of them actually playing the instruments. The ones of Bill Wyman are hysterical, it looks like he is just standing there getting his hair windblown. No showing of how great of a bass player he was. Its amazing how really terrible it is. Do not waste your money unless you just want to listen and just buy the CD's. I agree with all the other reviews on just how terrible this film really is. Just one to listen to not watch because you see more of the horn players playing their horns than you do seeing the band play their guitars. WOW",1449446400,11,720,4.217391304347826
7432601,1,B015D443A0,Rolling Stones' videos are the worst for 99% (with only slight exaggeration) shows Jagger and not the rest of the band. But they are the best live band ever and if it is on CD I'll get every From the Vault album.,1449446400,3,212,4.071428571428571
8733217,4,B015D443A0,"Great performance from the Stones on their last tour before they were augmented by many other musicians and vocalists which began to change their sound.  The recording is good, but the mix is a little out of balance at times with Ronnie's guitar drowning out Keith, still a decent recording and a great document of the Stones in the early 80's.  The video is disappointing as it appears that it is probably the same video footage that was shown on a big screen during the performance, hence all the tight head shots and very little long of medium range shots of band interplay and action.  I doubt any consideration was given to future release of the video footage at the time of the concert. Much better to listen to than watch.",1530921600,,729,4.549618320610687
