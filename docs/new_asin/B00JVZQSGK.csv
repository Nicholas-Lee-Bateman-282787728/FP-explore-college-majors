The 20 strums are incredibly easy to play and now my guitar ""sings."" Thank you Paul and Elena (admin support) for your DVD and additional material support. Dr. H. Mark McGibbon",1423440000,,287,5.0
6395223,2,B00JVZQSGK,if the back tracks would be on a disc you wood double your sales even if you increased your price as I do not wish to sit in front. of a computer and down load a product. robron2@yahoo.com.thanks ron,1422403200,,199,4.128205128205129

6395225,5,B00JVZQSGK,"A fun disc to practice guitar exercises with.  Exercises are presented well.  Too bad you have to download the book if you want it.  I still give 5 stars, but I think a double-sided summary page could have been included and would make the item more complete.",1420934400,,258,4.446808510638298
6395226,5,B00JVZQSGK,"If you are a beginner to intermediate guitar player this lesson series by Paul Perry will provide an excellent foundation. Paul is an exceptional teacher. The video clarity is top notch. Paul has a number of other products on his website: www. guitar-in-a-nutshell.com ranging from Spanish, Country and Blues and all done with expertise. I recently ordered his latest production on 'Rock and Roll' guitar which I think is a masterpiece. I did return it though because I found that I wasn't going to use it because of my focus on basic folk and country acoustic guitar. But if you have an electric guitar and you want to learn to rock the house down like they did in the 50's this is where you need to go. Paul's lessons are vastly superior to anything you can find for free on You Tube and in the long run getting his reasonably priced productions will save you not just time and money but will make you a better player.",1417910400,2,920,4.514970059880239

6395230,5,B00JVZQSGK,I'm very happy with this DVD and highly recommend it to anyone that wants to improve their strumming. Paul is an excellent teacher and does a great job of clearly explaining each strum.  The PDF manual is simple and easy to understand and the backing tracks are great for practice.,1407283200,6,281,4.62

6395232,5,B00JVZQSGK,"I recommend Paul's guitar courses in general and I own a number of them, including this DVD.  This DVD is suitable for beginners though anyone can have fun with the backing tracks and these strums.  I am not a beginner but I bought this DVD as much or more for the backing tracks as the strums instruction, and in particular the one flamenco rumba strum in this set.  When I received the DVD I found that neither the PDF manual nor the backing tracks were on the DVD.  No worries, I just sent an email with a copy of my order to the given support email address and I was supplied a download link for the backing tracks and manual in less than a day and downloaded the backing tracks and the manual in short order.  There are only up to five stars to rate this product, but when I consider how reliable and dependable Paul is, always with a no questions asked refund policy and excellent support, I'd give 10 stars if I could. :-)",1407196800,4,929,4.255681818181818
6395233,5,B00JVZQSGK,"This is one of the best guitar instruction dvd's that I have purchased. After getting the strum down and getting smooth on the chord changes, playing along with the backing tracks are a blast. Hope you release more of your lessons.  Must be getting pretty good, the wife hasn't  picked up anything and throwed it at me yet.",1406764800,2,323,4.551724137931035

8654122,5,B00JVZQSGK,"I have been searching for a strumming guide for such a long time.  It was like discovering a 'music gold mine' when I found Paul Perry's 20 Essential Guitar Strums DVD.  The course book presentation, backing tracks and play-along are simply amazing.  Paul - you are a very talented guitarist and teacher!",1445904000,,304,4.8076923076923075

8654124,1,B00JVZQSGK,"Absolutely the worst purchase I have ever made through Amazon. Does very,very,very little instruction. If you try to download the guide, your anti-virus software will tell you the site is contaminated. Asking for help is fruitless.",1433808000,4,231,5.444444444444445
8654125,5,B00JVZQSGK,"I played rhythm guitar in my youth, but never learned how to strum chords properly. I've learnt many chords, and enjoyed playing jazz. I've recently purchased another guitar after a long spell of not playing and decided to also purchase this course on strumming. I guess its never to late to learn it properly. The DVD is awesome. Paul does an excellent job in explaining and showing the right technique in strumming. I searched out a number of courses and I'm very glad I chose this one. If anyone wants to properly learn how to strum a guitar, then look no further. Believe me, this is well worth the money. If you go for personal guitar lessons, be prepared to pay hundreds of dollars. This is like having an instructor right in your living room. I highly recommend it.",1430956800,2,772,4.561151079136691
8654126,5,B00JVZQSGK,"WOW! I was amazed at how much I like this DVD! Strumming is one of my hardest things to learn (that and bar chords) and although I'm only on Strum #8 so far, it has helped immensely!  Once I downloaded the course and backing tracks it was like getting 2 other whole courses for free! i can't wait to work with these additional tools that Paul made available for everyone. I'm very happy with the investment...and you will be, too!",1428451200,,430,4.375
