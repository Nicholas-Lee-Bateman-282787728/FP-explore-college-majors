8296853,1,B001E6TFHS,"Buy the award winning movie ""Cromwell"" with Charles Gray. It is only $10. The movie is great. This particular Phoenix Group dvd is, ""i kid you not,"" 30 minutes of the exact 1971 movie, ""Cromwell,"" for 5 times the price. Phoenix group plays 30 minutes of the movie for you and adds in about 3 or 4 extra voice-over comments. The end. Not worth a fifth of what i paid.",1473724800,2,366,4.242857142857143
