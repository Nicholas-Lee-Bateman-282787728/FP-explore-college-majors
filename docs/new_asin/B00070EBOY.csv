2198637,4,B00070EBOY,"Cowboys & Angels is a film that is more than the sum of its parts. Michael Legge is the breakout star of this film and, I believe, a young actor of whom we will see a great deal more in the future. You may remember him as the ""older"" Frank McCourt in the painfully fine film, ""Angela's Ashes"". Legge plays Shane, a straight, young civil servant who has just moved to downtown Limmerick (that's in Ireland folks) to get away from home with his mother. Allen Leech plays Vincent, his gay fashion school roommate. The two young men meet for the ""first"" time as they both are looking for flats. After a time, they realize they know each other from secondary school (high school).

It is telling that the film doesn't focus on the homosexuality angle. It isn't so much a major focal point of the film as it is simply a plot point. It's an aside; something to be thought of as a character aspect of Vincent, much as his being in fashion school or a blonde is.

Shane has moved to Limmerick to get away from home after the death of his beloved father in an automobile accident. He is a civil servant (something that many films have described as existing on one of the lower rings Hell). He took the job merely because he passed the test. He wanted to go to university, but could not because after his father's death, there just wasn't the money.

Shane is a nerd. Vincent is flamboyant without being effeminate. Vincent helps Shane fit into the youthful society that exists in the big city, which, in turn, should help Shane become more of a lady's man.

Shane wants to be as comfortable with the ladies as Vincent is, but alas, that has more to do with Vincent's sexuality than it does his looks and style. It is interesting to note that Shane is willing to compromise his morals by being a drug runner but he isn't willing to compromise them to sleep with another man.

Trials and tribulations bring Shane and Vincent together as best friends, with each helping the other out along the way.

Legge is an absolutely fine actor. He is natural and believable as Shane, even as he grows from backwards youth to jaded boy-man. Leech is refreshing as his gay best friend. Leech wisely does not play Vincent as flamboyantly feminine, but rather ""artistically flamboyant"" something that many straight art school students are as well. Both young actors are refreshing, believable, and charming. I found myself wanting to know these characters and follow their journey after the the credits began to roll as the film ended.

This is a light, refreshing character study that is, sadly, something the American filmmakers seem to be unable to create. It takes the British and the Irish to deliver the goods in this department.

Watch this film and see if you don't agree.",1117497600,2,2753,4.58130081300813
2198638,4,B00070EBOY,"""Cowboys & Angels"" is an entertaining tale showing how a brief rooming together of one gay and one straight man results in benefit to both.  Twenty-year old, straight Shane Butler (played by Michael Legge) moves to downtown Limerick to be closer to his safe, dull civil service job in Ireland's Department of Agriculture.  Not being able to afford the rent alone, he rooms with a gay, 23-year old student of fashion design, Vincent Cusack (played by Allen Leech).  Shane becomes attracted to a fast-food server, Gemma (played by Amy Shiels), and gets life and career advice from a retiring co-worker, Jerry (played by Frank Kelly).  It turns out that Gemma is a close friend of Vincent and is a possible lesbian.  Dowdy Shane is not going anywhere fast and is even not being allowed into the trendy night club. Vincent rides to the rescue.  Along the way Shane realizes that his career passion is drawing and that art school might make sense.  Art schoool is expensive; so Shane is subject to temptation.  Temptation leads to big trouble.  Along the way the more disciplined Vincent gets roped in and has to come up with a way both to put on a successful show of his fashions for graduation and to get out of the soup.  Through luck and good character, there is a happy ending.

The extras include a good commentary track with Writer/ Director David Gleeson and actors Legge and Leech, some deleted scenes (two of which have some frisson), a director's text statement on his purpose for the movie, and some trailers.

The skin shots are modest - Gemma's back, side-views of chests with open shirts and the like.  There is good use of suggestion.

The movie is successful in showing how people of good will with different backgrounds can negotiate a living arrangement and help each other live better.  When Shane has his downward spiral, Vincent is able to keep matters under control.  This is a reversal of the stereotype of the stalwart straight person and the flustered gay one.  Limerick looks very beautiful, with castles and riverfront views.  There is good use of humor throughout.

My one issue with the movie is that it continues the traditional focus on the straight character at the expense of the gay one.  At the end Vincent is able to help Shane change his look, his career, and his loneliness, while staying out of jail.  Separately, Shane gets good advice through his job.  Despite the fabulous clothes, makeup, and apartment, Vincent is never shown with a boyfriend or even a date.  Vincent is shown having a single, brief encounter with a nice-looking greying-haired gentleman and is shown hanging out at both the local club and at home only with the woman, Gemma.  Vincent's parents are glimpsed once, at his graduation, and are never mentioned otherwise.  Where does the money for art school and all the clothes and home decorations come from?  Vincent seems to have no adult coaches.  Vincent is an inherently good and sensible person, but the questions about his social life, funding, and mentors are never asked.  Seen unsympathetically, this movie might appear to be a partial upgrade of the old story of the gay sidekick doing his all to help his straight buddy and ending up with not much for himself.

(Shane does help Vincent overcome a creative block and does behave well at the end; so it is not quite as one-sided as the above might imply.)

I liked the movie, especially the acting and Limerick, and would be happy to watch a sequel.",1109030400,18,3465,4.755443886097153
2198639,4,B00070EBOY,"This could have been a great film. What took it from a great film to a good film, for me, was the drug running. I understand that there needed to be a contrivance to get Shane money that he didn't have for both art school and a turnabout from geek to cute, but I just thought there could have been something less expectant. I remember myself thinking, before the idea even came out, ""God, I hope he doesn't get into drug running"". Yet he did. By the way, with his hair, clothes, and everything else, I thought he was perfectly fine. A person doesn't need to be wildly fashionable to be attractive. Shane was attractive as he was.

This was such a great concept. Two guys from totally different worlds manage to find themselves in the same world, and the gay guy works a ""miracle"" on the straight guy to turn him into something more than he is. This too is something rather simple, but the actors made it something more. Both Vincent and Shane really turned in terrific performances. Okay, maybe not a ""great"" concept, but it was a concept that was acted out magnificently. Vincent and Shane were completely believable characters. At first I didn't quite buy Shane's interest in drugs at all - never mind the drug running - but when you consider his relative loneliness, it fits quite well. Vincent's hatred of drugs was a welcome compliment to that. A very welcome compliment.

There have been countless girls (Gemma) who have fallen in love with beautiful gay guys, and tried to turn them. The scene when Gemma tried to make love to Vincent was entirely believable. Even though Vincent was gay, ""everybody tries it once"", and he gave it his best shot. It didn't work.

There was a tension in the film that was so powerful that it made me angry that the drug running was a part of it. That was Vincent's obvious attraction to Shane. Whenever the two were shown together in their apartment, they were very close to each other, sometimes shoulder to shoulder, and on more than one occasion, Vincent had his knee on Shane's leg. I found it completely believable that Shane didn't sense Vincent's attraction to him, and when Shane was ""seduced"" by the drug runner and turned him away, that was believable as well. Vincent was gay. Shane was straight. I won't deny that part of me wished that Shane would fall for Vincent, but it's almost better that they were simply best friends, that Shane took whatever money he had left over to give Vincent a ticket to New York to pursue his dream of fashion.

Again, my only problem in the film was the drug running. It took up too much time in a movie that had a considerable amount of material to mine. I wanted to see so much more of Vincent and Shane - and I'm not talking about wanting to see them in sexual situations. They were just such believable characters that if the drug running was removed and more time given to their relationship, it would have been a great film. Perhaps instead of the drug running, they could have given more time to Shane's infatuation with Gemma. That would have been terrific.",1108944000,37,3049,4.538181818181818
2198640,5,B00070EBOY,"Writer and Director David Gleeson has molded a film about contemporary youth and the life problems and decisions they make and in doing so has created a story unblemished by the conventional tropes - an unusual and commendable feat.

Small town lad  Shane (Michael Legge) narrates this adventure as he enters the 'big city' civil service employment in Limerick to support his newly widowed mother and family.  An artist at heart and of talent, Shane stumbles along trying to find a flat he can afford, eventually settling into a shared mid-city flat with a young gay art student Vincent (Allen Leech).  The two seem polar opposites at first: Shane is conservative in dress and job and social demeanor while Vincent is garish, ebullient, and progressive in this artsy way of life.

Slowly, through a wondrous honesty about who they are, the two become close and Vincent does a makeover of Shane to give him a chance to be more engaged in the world.  By a curious accident, Shane discovers a stash of drugs in the lobby of their flat, only to discover that it belongs to two men who live there -  Keith (David Manning) and Budgie (Colm Coogan).  Serendipitously, Shane is talked into 'transporting' drugs from Dublin to Limerick for 1000 Euros, money Shane desperately needs if he is to maintain his newly designed lifestyle.

Shane's adventure in Dublin is complicated by dire happenings but he manages to return to Limerick and his reward.  Shane tries some of the drugs with bad consequences and is eventually arrested along with Vincent for possession of a tiny amount of drugs in their flat.  One of Vincent's ex tricks happens to work in the Police Department and the two are freed.

Subplots include a tender friendship between Shane and a retiring civil servant Jerry (Frank Kelly) whose end to his boring career and life alters Shane's outlook considerably.  In the end Shane and Vincent (along with Gemma - Amy Shiels - a fellow art student of Vincent's who shares many qualities with both lads) are warmly bonded and the results of their friendship are the unexpected but lovely end to this film.

All of the actors are first rate and the direction is fast paced and unbelievably unbiased and tender.  This is a fine film for audiences young of age and of heart and is one of the better-balanced films about the spectrum of sexuality that has been made.  Wonderful film!

2198641,4,B00070EBOY,"Although there is a gay lead in first-time director David Gleeson's ""Cowboys and Angels"", this is by no means a gay film, rather a touching and heartwarming story of two young men coming-of-age in the heart of Dublin. Rivaling anything that's on the market today in the way of teen films, this rises above any of them with great performances and a fresh look at some old themes. It might be too sweet at times and neatly wrapped but the Irish charm of the characters keeps it afloat throughout.

Michael Legge plays Shane Butler, a geeky 20 year old lad from the suburbs who has just moved to Dublin. While searching for a flat to rent he stumbles upon a fellow classmate from high school, Vincent (Allen Leech), and the two reconnect when they both happen to be looking at the same apartment to rent. They decide to share it and Shane's adventure in the big city begins.

Shane is straight, has a quiet demeanor, and looks like his mom dressed him, while Vincent is more outgoing, dresses and looks funky, oh, and is gay. The two don't quite hit it off at first, but their friendship develops over time and Vincent takes him under his wing, as a friend and partly as a fashion project. Shane falls for a girl named Gemma (Amy Shiels) who works in a nearby burger joint, and it just so happens an old classmate of Vincent's. Shane has a hard time making the connection with her and is envious of her and Vincent's friendship. To make matters worse, Shane finds some drugs in the buildings lobby, he gets caught by the dealer (David Murray), and is then offered a large sum of money to make a run. He takes the offer hoping the money can either buy him a new wardrobe or help put him into art school and get him out of his dead-end job at the civil service department. A subplot involves a coworker named Jerry that is truly touching. In any event, Shane falls into the wrong crowd and friendships are tested, hearts broken, and loved ones lost. But in the end, true friendship endures and you can't help be touched by either one, the cowboy or angel.",1108425600,3,2050,4.43501326259947

2198649,4,B00070EBOY,"Cowboys and Angels is an entertaining film, and exciting to watch.  This film should have become a landmark in showing how two men, one straight, one gay, can develop, not only a true loving relationship, but affect each other's lives so dramatically.  Michael Legge (Shane, straight boy) and Allen Leech (Vincent, his gay roommate) are excellent in their two portrals of men facing real crises in their lives - uncertain about their futures.  Amy Shiels plays Genna with a charming brightness, herself seeming a bit uncertain about her sexuality, but not for long.  The last scenes are truly heart warming and tear jerking, as Shane's life becomes transformed and Vincent gets his chance in New York, thanks to Shane.

2198675,2,B00070EBOY,"I often like how countries outside of America tend to make better character comedies and dramas. They typically are better at character development and the actors really get a chance to show their acting chops. Admittedly, I watched this for the guy from DOWNTON ABBEY--Allen Leech is amazing on the show and he looked like a great presence here. And while he is engaging and spot on as a young gay designer with a wee bit of wisdom to his edge, the film itself is poorly written and its key plot points are a bit too contrived, including a twist toward the end that's far from credible. Two young men, one gay and the other straight, rent an apartment out of necessity. The straight one gets a fashion make over while the gay one struggles to develop a show for his final coursework. The gay one also knows the girl who slings fish and chips at the local joint--a girl the straight one admires. Then the straight guy gets involved in drugs and the film takes a turn toward SCARED STRAIGHT and it loses its luster. As this section unfolds, I kept thinking how incredibly ridiculous the script was and how the inevitable fight over the ""friendship"" between the two roomies was overblown since there were no signs of said friendship other than the straight boy dressing better. At the end, everything works out nicely, even though someone gets shot and the film really skirts its aftermath. In the end, I feel the actors were fine. Leech is engaging and fun to watch, and his work since then has gotten incredibly more mature. Michael Legge does well in a role that's poorly conceived as the straight man who ends up being a carrier pigeon for narcotics. The rest of the cast is fine, but the film revolves mostly around the poor choices of Legge's character, who is far less interesting than Leech's gay designer. It's worth a rental if you cannot find ANYTHING else to watch and are looking to waste 90 minutes without thinking about it....",1347753600,2,1940,4.593659942363113

2198694,3,B00070EBOY,"I watched this movie last night.  Why it has been labled a ""gay"" movie is beyond my grasp.  It is simply a story of growing up:  learning to make your own decisions, to make your own way, and to understand that happiness usually is standing right in front of us.

The movie's two central characters are Shane and Allen.  I don't agree at all that the gay character (Allen) caused the huge change in Shane. Shane CHANGED HIMSELF.  Like most of us going through life's journey, you have to experience--and hopefully LEARN from that experience--as you continue to grow.  Are you going to make some mistakes?  Sure you are; you're human.  This particular movie dealt more with the intricate bonding of two people:  one just happened to be gay.  So, if you're gay and you think you'll get some T&A between the two lead characters, forget it.  That is NOT what this movie is about.

Directed by David Gleeson, this movie's running time is 89 minutes and the version I watched was not rated.  There are a few ""off color"" words, some adult situations, and that's about it.  Nothing to offend.  I highly recommend this one.",1201651200,,1114,4.607142857142857
2198695,3,B00070EBOY,"""Cowboys and Angels,"" released in 2005, is a mild, pleasant little comedy-drama, a semi-autobiographical Irish coming of age tale if ever there was one, set, unusually enough, in Limerick,-- yes, that Limerick-- a place we've seldom seen onscreen (save for the film of Frank Mc Court's ""Angela's Ashes--"" that sure didn't make it look like a pleasant place to be.)  But the city looks much more presentable in ""Cowboys and Angels."" The film stars Michael Legge, who played the teenaged Frank Mc Court in ""Angela's Ashes,"" and may possibly, therefore, be Limerick's leading young actor, as Shane Butler, geeky suburban kid, dressed by Mom, come to town to work in a dull civil service job.

Interestingly enough, the film's written and directed by David Gleeson, who once worked in the exact same Department of Agriculture office, with some of the exact same people, as does his protaganist.  At any rate, here we have young Shane fresh in the city, looking for affordable lodgings.  He decides to room with Vincent Cusack (Allen Leech), a guy he knew in school, now attending the local art college, and a way out there gay wannabe fashion designer.  Thence hangs the tale.  Amy Shiels plays Gemma, Vincent's hot, close friend: Shane yearns in her direction, but he's too geeky to consider until taken in hand by Vincent.  Frank Kelly turns in a touching performance as Jerry, an older worker in Shane's office, who doesn't realize until too late that it wasn't the best way to spend his time.  There are some regrettable interludes where Shane gets into drug smuggling: but how else is he to pay, someone must have thought, for his new wardrobe, and his new directions in life?

As often happens in works about gays and straights, much more attention is paid to the love life problems of the straights, rather than the gays, but Vincent is respectfully treated.  The film, by and large, covers familiar territory, but it did win five awards, and it's set in a part of the world we don't often see.",1187395200,,1997,4.795918367346939

Don't miss this movie! It is well worth the price and share it with someone special friend lover or family they will thak you for it",1129161600,3,424,4.182926829268292
2198698,4,B00070EBOY,"Cowboys and Angels is an engaging Irish dramaedy with somegreat acting and great accents. Nothing too novel in the plot, but it's still a well done movie (especially from a new director) A pleasure to watch.",1128038400,2,207,4.777777777777778
2198699,5,B00070EBOY,"Ahhh those wonderful Irish. luckily , being an aussie, I am well used to the Irish accent. I loved everything about this movie and recommend it to everyone. I put this on a par with 'beautiful thing' and know it will get more viewings from me.",1127433600,4,243,4.304347826086956
2198700,5,B00070EBOY,This movie defines the word charming.  An uplifting feel good movie that is aimed at a younger crowd but has lessons for all us older folks to learn.  Production values are excellent as is the cast and the acting.  It's worth watching the directors narrative as there are many interesting facts to learn along the way.  This is defintely a personal work from the heart of the director writer.  His talent and vision enabled him to bring to life a story about friendship that is both heartwarming and satisfying.  Can easily be watched numerous times.  It's a winner!,1127088000,4,566,4.714285714285714
2198701,4,B00070EBOY,"This film is a touching,sweet story from start to finish. Legge's inherent strengths as an actor are a triumph of naivete over vulgarity. Very lttle,if any,of this film feels contrived or forced. A subtly written tale regarding two gorgeous young men. This film was regarded with intense pleasure from start to finish.",1126137600,2,318,5.134615384615385
2198702,4,B00070EBOY,"At first I was kind of ""Here we go another low buget gay film"". It started a little slow for me but the longer I watched the more I was like ""Shhh! Their British and I am trying to concentrate"". Cause my partner and pets were all distruptive and such.  I really felt drawn to the dark haired character even though he was straight, my life was and is quite similar. Hanging out with the wrong crowd falling and rising above.  Living with stranger who you remember for the rest of you life because they changed your life forever. This is a great gay film that does not force sex down your throat. (Not that I would have minded) It was a relief to so a good gay story that was not about getting laid.  Lastly watch the previews cause Bear Cub and My Wife Maurice seem to be hillarious and at the same level of interest.",1121212800,,816,4.1847133757961785

8044351,5,B00070EBOY,"At first, this seems as if it could be a boy-meets-boy romance. But it isn't. It doesn't fall under the niche label ""gay film"" at all. It's a coming-of-age story, with a few madcap antics and moments of farce, fun for a broad audience to watch as light entertainment.",1488585600,,267,4.469387755102041
