2792925,1,B000O78AE2,"I never finished watching the video so I will not comment on the actors and their roles.  However, the movie moved very slowly so as to not hold my interest.  The quality of the video was extremely poor to the point that even if the movie had kept my interest I wouldn't have stayed with it.",1378684800,,291,4.178571428571429
2792926,4,B000O78AE2,This movie was no doubt an older film made with a different though process from movies today. It has a different idea to it that I had never given thought before and did it very well.,1350086400,,183,4.111111111111111
2792927,1,B000O78AE2,"This is not just a bad movie (especially since it spent the first 20+ minutes with some narration and videos of the whole ""war is bad"" stuff of the 70's), but the actual DVD is the worst ""quality"" (and I use that term loosely here) I have ever seen.  Grainy and blurry, like watching a 30 year old, deteriorating VHS copy.  Even going so far as to have a gap in the movie at around 32 minutes in!
Over all, this is another bad movie from a terrible time period for sci-fi (pre-Star Wars).  Giving this movie a 1 star is being way too kind - it deserves no stars.",1333670400,4,562,4.090909090909091
2792928,1,B000O78AE2,"""Beyond the Bermuda Triangle"" is an intriguing story - BUT - this double feature dvd is such poor quality, it's barely watchable.",1205452800,9,129,4.909090909090909
8183993,1,B000O78AE2,"This is typical no budget 1970s material.  It is surprising Robert Vaughn took this role, after seeing the outlay.  The direction and production value are near zero, even for its time.  Also this copy from VHS is of very poor quality.  It is understandable why this fiasco never saw standard distribution and went straight to TV.  It is so mediocre it couldn't attain ""cult"" status.",1521849600,,382,4.815384615384615
8183994,1,B000O78AE2,"This was almost the worst movie I've ever seen. Yes, I've seen worst, believe it or not.(The sifi movies of the 1920's through the 1940's)  the up-side is- HOW NOT TO MAKE A MOVIE.",1486080000,,180,4.294117647058823
8183995,3,B000O78AE2,Quite a low budget affair.  I found the beginning more interesting than the main story.  It seemed like a history lesson with an anti-war slant and so very 70's.  This copy is on the Treeline label and is in full screen.  Quality is acceptable and quite watchable with no major splicing problems.  It's obviously from VHS and the night scenes don't look so great.,1454112000,,363,4.609375
8183996,5,B000O78AE2,fascinating and fun movie to watch. thanks for the fast shipment.,1453420800,,65,5.0
8183997,1,B000O78AE2,"Lucifer Complex seems to have been cobbled together out of shards. I hate to kick a movie when it's down but this one deserves the boot. The narrative device is absurd and the main story a jumble of cliches and poorly acted scenes. It's not fun bad, just bad bad.",1449273600,,263,4.28

8184002,4,B000O78AE2,"Classis 70s ham extravaganza. Vaughn is pure entertainment, and very much a man for his era.  Deffo worth a watch.",1397865600,,114,4.7
