8039328,1,B00066N9WE,"I agree with the other one star reviewers. The description of this dvd is misleading. I thought I was going to get a capoeira workout by a professional. This dvd is basic, boring and production has much room for improvement. I gave this dvd away. Save your money.",1281916800,,263,4.5
8039329,1,B00066N9WE,"I was dumb enough to buy the VHS copies of these years ago for megabucks. I have hundreds of workout videos. These shouldn't even be categorized as ""workout"" videos. There is no cuing, no instruction, no routines, nothing. Just the lady swaying around and smiling in her living room, and the occasional clips of real capoeira artists. I can't believe these are still on the market and still being hawked as ""workout videos"" !",1181779200,,425,4.756756756756757
8039330,1,B00066N9WE,I am sorry to say these were the worst video's ever made. There is no instruction...just a woman in her livingroom it seems moving while flashing to a group of men performing self-defense. I was truly disappointed . I cannot stress enough not to buy these.,1168473600,,256,4.586956521739131
8039331,4,B00066N9WE,I found these DVDs different and fun to workout to.  I found new muscles that I didn't know I had.,1153267200,,98,3.9
8039332,1,B00066N9WE,"Boring !

Poor sound - horrific sound !

The Capoeirista seems to get tired and running out of breath after first 5 min.

No explanations !

No flow !

The REAL capoeira clips are teasingly annoying !

No substance, no goal, no pace, NOTHING !

It took Amazon 2 months to deliver ! And it was shipped from So Cal to So Cal, no more than 50 miles away...

The worst video (instructional or entertainment or anything) ever !

Too bad there's no option less than one star for the rating !!!",1122940800,20,487,4.206521739130435
