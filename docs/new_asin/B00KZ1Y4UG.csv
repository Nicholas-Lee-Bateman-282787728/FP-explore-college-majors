6454648,5,B00KZ1Y4UG,"It's a good movie, marks the style of the director Julian Hernandez, sometimes difficult to understand, with long sequences and little dialogue;  little logical interventions in the development of the movie. Someone justif that well they are movies film art; you feel that is a crazy movie; but still I was hooked and I will continue buying the works of this director.
Las obras de este director me recuerdan las pelculas de arte de los 70s como la ""Montaa Sagrada"" de Alejandro Jodorowski, donde se mezcla lo sicodlico, con el subrealismo; tambin son un poco parecidas a las pelculas de Derek Jarman, o las de Pier Paolo Pasolini, donde es difcil de entender el sentido de la pelcula, pero aun as me gustan y las seguire comprando.",1412467200,8,732,4.7637795275590555

6454651,4,B00KZ1Y4UG,"Intriguing; slow moving yet absorbing.  Plenty of eye candy to keep you watching.  Several plots revolving at one time but all of them focus on desire, longing and coming together.  Rented it, watched it once and hope to watch again before the rental period is over.",1410825600,10,266,4.739130434782608
6454652,1,B00KZ1Y4UG,"Glorified porn pretending to be an artsy love story.  There's no love here.  Beyond that, I find this endless, endless stream of films about the endless, endless sexual exploits of gay men to be so worn out.  These are one-dimensional characters defined by sex.  Except for one of the leads - the young dancer - who has the sense to steer clear of Emiliano - the other lead.  But I didn't need to sit through an hour and a half of porn to reach the same conclusion.  Of the many dozens of films about gay men I've seen on Amazon and Netflix in the past year, almost every one is like this one - portraying gay men as sexually obsessed, and having no other aspects to their personalities except hot bodies and anonymous sex.  Get lost with this already.  It's actually very heterosexist (even if it comes from a gay director).  And this is how it has been for the past 25 years.  Before this, gay characters didn't survive the end of the film.  They were either murdered or committed suicide.  Now they survive, but their lives are about nothing but sex.  I wish I hadn't wasted the afternoon on this, and I intend to ask for my money back since the description was anything but accurate.  It's not about love, it's not about ""happiness on earth"" - even pizza delivery guy porn has more of a plot than this film",1409961600,24,1310,4.381742738589212
6454653,4,B00KZ1Y4UG,"This film captivated me but I'm not entirely sure why.  It is a rather soulless look at sexually ambiguous young people, told in long gazes and passionate but impersonal sexual encounters.  The preview available here on Amazon gives a very good idea of what the entire film is like.  I don't know why I enjoyed it, but the actors definitely drew me in and wouldn't let go.",1409788800,19,372,4.522388059701493

6454657,1,B00KZ1Y4UG,I have seen some amazing foreign films with subtitles that I would highly recommend and this is not one of them.  I fell asleep 15 minutes in and did not stay around for the rest. It was boring and uneventful.,1434758400,,209,4.225

6454661,1,B00KZ1Y4UG,"the worst 30 minutes of my year , and i had a colonoscopy....  . pointless. dull. un-engaging . i could not have cared less about anyone involved in this ""film"". visually dull. no connection between actors. no life . as erotic as day old coffee grounds. vile. totally unmemorable. this was lousy on every level.",1425600000,,311,4.654545454545454
6454662,4,B00KZ1Y4UG,Hernandez's film techniques are evident but the sex scene with the three characters is confusing and difficult to understand in the context of the film...,1423353600,2,154,5.2
6454663,5,B00KZ1Y4UG,"This is a film that starts out rather boring, due to misunderstanding and ignorance of the reviewer, but ends up a tremendous comment on love and life!  Yes, it is a foreign film, Mexican with subtitles, but what a comment it is!  If you understand Spanish, it will be a much stronger effect on you!  This is not a film for the general audiences.  You and the one you care about, should view this film in the privacy of your home, apartment, etc.  ""SOMETIMES WE HAVE A PROBLEM SEEING LOVE, TRUE LOVE, UNTIL IT GRABS US BACK TO REALITY!""  NJMJr!",1423353600,5,544,4.39
6454664,5,B00KZ1Y4UG,Julian Hernandez is an excellent movie producer & director. I love his work. I've been dying to see this film for so long. I still may purchase just to have in my collection. Guys were smashing in it.,1422403200,,200,4.2894736842105265
6454665,5,B00KZ1Y4UG,Alan Ramirez alone makes the film worth viewing. The Emilio character becomes an annoyance you wish to just go away it makes no sense to mix up the boys-will-be-boys scenes with this confused druggie downer of a person.,1418515200,,219,4.7894736842105265

6454669,2,B00KZ1Y4UG,Kind of a confusing mixed bag. Not very engaging. What happened there in the middle? Yuk!  Just remember thinking... when will this ever end?,1414713600,,141,4.875

6454672,4,B00KZ1Y4UG,"Graphic but interesting story, reasonably well acted.  Probably takes too long to say what it is communicating, but it did leave me with some important questions.  Is Happiness possible on earth? Can we have Happiness without a relationship? Is recognizing the lack of Happiness in others as important as finding Happiness with another? Can we change others or ourselves in order to find Happiness?",1413676800,6,398,5.203125

8662778,2,B00KZ1Y4UG,"I am giving this film two stars because of the sections that involve the dancer Alan Ramirez (and I'd actually give him more but I don't want to raise the rating on the overall film which barely deserves one star).  The rest of this cinematic mess is both banal and pretentious. . .which, I suppose, is something of a feat in and of itself.  Pretty people (especially the men) but they are wasted, and often wasted at great and tedious length.  Thank goodness I found it on Netflix and didn't buy it!  Avoid.  Really.",1508544000,,517,4.457446808510638

8662781,5,B00KZ1Y4UG,"Having been a fan of Julian Hernandez work, I looked forward to seeing his latest film. I was not disappointed. The film is beautiful to look at, yet at times confusing. Instead of taking something away from the piece as one might expect, it actually makes you reflect on the film. The 4 short films are all different, yet retain the Hernandez feel. Without giving away the plot, one of the films could definitely rated x in this country.
If you are fan of Mr. Hernandez work, I recommend adding this to your list.",1454889600,3,514,4.4787234042553195

8662784,1,B00KZ1Y4UG,"This is what I imagine a gay porno would be if written while tripping on acid - and I don't mean that in a good way. Wow. I just had flashbacks to the worst 1960s movies I ever attempted to watch, but with some additional male nudity. As another reviewer aptly put it: 'Complete garbage masquerading as an artsy film.'",1451088000,,318,4.316666666666666
8662785,5,B00KZ1Y4UG,"Stunningingly conceived--and expertly executed--I Am Happiness On Earth is a cinematic revelation that blends dance, longing and music in a blend that could not have been imagined even a few years ago. A film rich in imagery and fluidity, its structure is both puzzling and liberating.
It's like nothing I've ever seen before. Brilliant, unsettling and endlessly fascinating, it's one extraordinary moment after another.",1448582400,2,420,5.578125
