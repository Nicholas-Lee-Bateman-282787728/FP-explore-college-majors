8184296,4,B000OCY62C,"Rebecca has started her new job teaching high school. She's an 11 year old genius. This makes it hard for her to relate to her students, whom all have major personality quirks. Their day to day life is filled with dopiness and insanity.

This show is like Azumanga Daioh on crack. The best things about this anime are the animation and comedy. It's extremely strange, so don't try to understand it. Just get past the first 5 episodes and enjoy all of the goofiness that comes. If you can get a close up picture of the cover; then you can get a get a good idea of how Paniponi is drawn. The color shading and character designs are very unique and cool. There are also some pretty good voice talents in this one. It's not one of the better animes I've seen, but it's definitely funny and good mindless entertainment.",1354838400,,814,4.426666666666667

8184298,5,B000OCY62C,"Best to start with volume one. Not that this one doesn't stand alone in it's wacky, fast pace, off the wall, all out funny stuff. This is one of the anime we show people who aren't familiar with anime to show them how good this stuff really is.",1248307200,,244,4.104166666666667
