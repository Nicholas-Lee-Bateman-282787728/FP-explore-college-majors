1896214,5,B00009WW17,"The film is basicly a bout a Indian American who does not like Indian culture and does everything he can to avoid it, but it doesnt help that his family id Indian. Krishnagopal (The main character, the Indian American) lives his life the American way. When he goes to college, things change, in a way he would never have imagined. Whilst there he falls in love with a Indian girl called Nina Shah. This is a comedy. Watch the ways he tries to win Nina over and deal with his room mates - who if i may say are hilarious. This is a must watch movie",1091145600,6,546,4.160377358490566
1896215,5,B00009WW17,IF YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE INDIAN CULTURE SEE THIS MOVIE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I LIKED ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS THAT IT'S NOT A TYPICAL BOLLYWOOD MOVIE WHERE THERE ARE DANCES AND LIP-SINGING. THIS MOVIE IS NOT LIKE THAT AT ALL. IT SHOWS LIKE A HOLLYWOOD MOVIE. IT'S DIFFERENT.,1087257600,8,281,4.320754716981132
1896216,5,B00009WW17,"American Desi is the best! it shows a boy(Krishna/Kris) who hates the indian culture yet falls for a girl who is very indianized. very funny!

BUY THIS DVD!!! it is great!!",1086912000,2,350,4.4

7994064,5,B00009WW17,"Being a desi myself, this movie had me in stitches the entire way through. Even my (white) boyfriend gets some of the references and finds it absolutely hysterical.",1358380800,,164,4.892857142857143
7994065,5,B00009WW17,"American Desi is about a college freshman named Krishna Reddy, who is on the verge of finding himself along with his Sikh, Muslim and rap-listening roommates.  What I liked about it is not only the incredibly talented cast (which includes Kal Penn), but the scene in the kitchen where Kris and his roomies try to cook an Indian dinner for Nina and end up messing up the entire place.  It is set to a song by Penn Masala and one of the highlights of the movie.  Funny dialogues and some truly heartwarming moments between the four roommates are what made the film an enjoyable one for me.  If you watch just one indie flick about desi culture, this should be it.  It breaks some common stereotypes of the Indian culture, but in a humorous way.",1358208000,,742,4.466666666666667
7994066,4,B00009WW17,"It's funny because so many ABCDs go through this phase sooner or later. I'm guilty as charged for sure. It reminds us of the importance of our cultural identity in a country where people are modernized through peer pressure, and not just in the US. This is also a good way to explain to non-Indians what we have to go through.

The only problem I have with this movie was the fact that they practically glamorized the stereotype of Patels being bad people. I took offense to that, especially since it's been proven that so many of us are just as decent as other Indians. It wouldnt've hurt to give the villian a different last name.

Great movie otherwise =)",1234656000,,658,4.475
7994067,1,B00009WW17,"How many more movies do we need about younger generations clashing with older ones? Are ABCD, American Chai, Second Generation, and Bend it Like Beckham not enough? Of the aforementionned movies, the only one worth seeing is BILB. The rest are absolutely horrific with bad scripts, poor acting, and the same over the top, overused storylines. American Desi can be added to that list of bad ones.

The protagonist, Kris, is extremely rude and narrow minded when it comes to his own culture. He knows, nor wants to know, anything about his own heritage and the whole movie becomes a rant about India from his viewpoint. When he does become interested, it's only because of a girl he has a crush on, which is lame and has a high school mentatlity behind it. Unlike the humorous and sincere BILB, which is an affectionate satire WITHOUT being rude and disrespectful, American Desi is nothing more than a 2 hour sitcom-like pseudo drama that is a total waste of your time.

I'll admit there were a few jokes I laughed at (very few though) and his roommates were colorful characters. But that's about it. The acting is poor and there is no depth to any of these characters. The script is also clumsy and very predictable. Overall, this is a total waste of a film.",1120089600,7,1257,4.632286995515695
7994068,4,B00009WW17,"Let me start by saying this is a great film that you can watch a lot of times and enjoy a few great scenes. Its comfortably placed and is quite funny and precise in navigating the humor it seeks to explore. Ah well...I don't need to get technical.

A wanna be cool NRI leaves town for university. He's sick of his Indian upbringing and wants a change and looks forward to the university. Fortunately for him, he's an optimist. Unfortunately, optimism runs him into four Indians. One of whom is a colorful Sikh(like me) , another who's a strict Muslim , another who thinks he's a homie and a fat guy who loves eating.

What follows is a couple of hours of entertainment. Its good how these characters are introduced and played.

Watch this if your interested. Don't watch it if you're not willing to try. Don't expect too much cause the end is a bit filmi(bollywood) but your a satisified audience by then.",1113264000,3,905,4.5060975609756095
