8069969,5,B0009XUX0K,"This is truly a worthy follow-up to their hit movie ""Hellzapoppin'"" (which in turn is inspired by their famous stage show). However, the team of Ole Olsen & Chic Johnson's brand of loony humor is more at home on the stage instead of the big screen. This might explain their short track record at the box office, as they've done films which never allowed them to run full steam (the Marx Brothers faced similar problems; the closest they came to screen anarchy was probably ""Duck Soup"" and ""Horse Feathers""). But even small doses of O & J is plenty of fun to watch. Then there's ""Crazy House"", which just goes all out with the craziest sight gags and situations one can imagine. From what has to be the wildest opening to a film (the great ""Olsen & Johnson are coming!"" introduction; these guys know how to make an entrance!) to the climactic advanced movie preview (where the boys hog the credits, and even shoot the romantic leads, claiming ""they'll be no happy ending with this picture""), CH is quite possibly a truly insane comic masterpiece. Borrowing its premise from W.C. Fields' ""Never Give a Sucker an Even Break"" (which expertly & merrily throws movie logic out the window), the boys, after getting downright rejected decide to make their own picture under their own studio banner. Universal went all out in cramming this movie with stars galore. And while you might think this is a bad idea, the movie really sprints along at a brisk pace, thanks to the deft comedy directing hand of Edward Cline (""The Bank Dick""). So even when the boys leave the screen for the typical intrusion of musical numbers & plot exposition, it's all done quickly, bringing back its two stars. Cass Daly may be anything but subtle (she makes Martha Raye seem like a wallflower), but her rollicking style clicks well with her boisterous surroundings. Such comedy talent as Shemp Howard, Edgar Kennedy, Franklin Pangborn, Billy Gilbert & Hans Conried lend their distinct personalities to the fun. A ""pre-Pa Kettle"" Percy Kilbride has some good moments as an eccentric investor. There's even cameo appearances (Basil Rathbone has the best throwaway as Sherlock Holmes) as well.
There's just too much content here to go over, so I won't bore you. See the movie for yourself and find out why O & J were indeed the Kings of Crazy Comedy!",1389657600,2,2318,4.754342431761787
8069970,5,B0009XUX0K,"""Crazy House"" is a classic Olson and Johnson ""Tour De Farce!""  Their hi-jinks and rapid-fire dialogue are their standard fare, and this movie is no exception.  From the start, where their studio greets them with loaded arms, you are in for their standard routines.  (It should be noted that Rowan and Martin's ""Laugh-In"" used a lot of ideas from these two, as well as the late, great Ernie Kovacs.)  About the only downside to this film was the inclusion of Cass Daley.  Although she does provide a couple of chuckles she, quite honestly, wasn't all that good, I'm sorry to say.  Ole Olson and Chic Johnson are their usual zany selves, and I feel that this movie is worth seeing, as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hellzapoppin/dp/B000OV7OVS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hellzapoppin</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-Over-Town/dp/B002DSY8N2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All Over Town</a>, as well as their ""Ghost Chasers.""  For someone like myself who loved these flicks as a youngster, it's almost therapeutic to watch them again.  Although the actors and actresses have long since been called to that Big Studio Up Yonder, they still live on in these delightful old movies",1328313600,3,1272,6.106741573033708
8069971,4,B0009XUX0K,"""Crazy House"" is as entertainingly riotous as ""Hellzapoppin'"". The opening scenes of the film are hilarious, particularly their 'welcome home' at the movie studio. Olsen and Johnson's vaudeville comedy works very well here. Except for the generally unfunny (that is, annoying) presence of Cass Daley (well, you be the judge), a funny, funny, film.",1142467200,6,347,5.444444444444445
