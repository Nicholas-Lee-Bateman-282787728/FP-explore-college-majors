1425380,3,B00005BJXT,For an older movie the acting was not that great. The idea that people can survive in extremely harsh environments is learned in this movie. Everybody wanted to give up and just die except one man that refused to give up and got very creative for survival. Not a bad movie but not great either.,1414108800,,294,4.363636363636363

1425384,3,B00005BJXT,"FLESHBURN is directed by George Gage, a former creator of over 2000 TV commercials who in recent years has done only documentaries. Gage and wife Beth co-scripted this feature, also their ads and docs.
.

It's the story of a former Vietnam vet (Landham) a Native American conscientious objector who went AWOL and was sent to the looney bin as punishment. He escapes, captures the people responsible for his incarceration and leaves them barefoot and without supplies way out in the Arizona desert. Then he hovers nearby but unseen, waiting to find out if they'll die or figure how to get back to civilization.

The desert scenes are most realistic, you can empathize with deprivations the victims experience and with their terror. This thanks to decent acting by a cast of unknowns.

A real sleeper from CROWN INTERNATIONAL that just may surprise you.
It's also available on MCE's Crown Int. package,

1425385,3,B00005BJXT,"I first saw FLESHBURN in a theatre in 1984 and I suppose it left a large enough impression on me that I would

buy it all these years later--is it really 23 years gone by?  Definite B cinema with a few interesting ideas but

nothing all that horrific...just a good, mediocre action flick.  Supposed to be a psychological thriller but it's not

really psychological and it's not really thrilling.  A few scenes are really bad, er...embarrassing--lighting, acting(especially in the early scenes)...maybe i should read the book but i don't think i will...it's sad when a bad movie turns you from the written word.  I actually only bought this as research on my own novel about watching that film in that theatre but now I'm not even going to include that scene in my book--anymore.

  I was going to write a horror film inspired by the opening moments of this film but I think I will scrap that too...most all horror films today are crap.  Sorry, wish i could say something better but you asked for it. msd.",1179014400,3,1004,4.6158192090395485

7938012,1,B00005BJXT,"Calvin Duggai (Sonny Landham) a PTSD Vietnam vet and Native American decided to settle a tribal dispute by leaving 5 people in the desert. For some strange reason a bunch of white folk judged him mentally insane and locked him up. Calvin gets out and guess what? He goes after those that put him in the asylum and makes them live in the desert...to prove he is not crazy no doubt. The film has some flashbacks and internal conflicts plus that final expected conflict. The dialogue was as dry as the desert. A waste of my time.
