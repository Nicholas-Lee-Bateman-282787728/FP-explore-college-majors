It is defining momento of childhood which still resonants with me today: The glorious music, the Mare of Steel, the recovery of the bell...And at last it is on DVD!

His father: Krok, a tremendous  beer-swilling thane, builder of the long ship.  King Harald dupes Krok,  paying him a mere two gold pieces for his two years of effort. So Rolf (RW)  and his brother Orm consider it fair to steal the long ship to search for a  legendary golden bell, ""as tall as three tall men"" to recoup  their fortunes. To guard against reprisals against their family while they  are absent, Rolf and Orm also kidnap the king's lovely daughter.

872140,4,6304329008,"RELEASED IN 1964 and directed by Jack Cardiff, ""The Long Ships"" chronicles events circa 1000 AD when a Viking misadventurer, Rolfe (Richard Widmark), and a Moorish king (Sidney Poitier) from the Barbary Coast strive to find ""The Mother of All Voices,"" a priceless gigantic golden bell near the Pillars of Hercules, which refer to the promontories that flank the entrance to the Strait of Gibraltar (the northern pillar is Calpe Mons, aka the Rock of Gibraltar). Russ Tamblyn plays Rolfes athletic brother, Orm, while Oskar Homolka appears as their father.

This is a mishmash of The Vikings and The 7th Voyage of Sinbad (both released in 1958) in theme and tone. Its larger-than-life and essentially serious, but there are a few fun moments, like the amusing harem sequence later in the movie. Its far from great like The Vikings, but its almost on par with 7th Voyage, minus the sorcery and fantastical creatures. If you favor these two films then The Long Ships is a must. The Moorish sets are superb and there are some interesting props, like The Mare of Steel, a torturous execution device dreamed-up by someone with a dubious imagination.

The movie scores pretty well on the female front with Beba Loncar as Gerda, the Viking babe, Rosanna Schiaffino as the Moorish kings wife and Jeanne Moody as another Norse beauty; all stunning in their unique ways. There are several others on the periphery. They couldve/shouldve done more with these stellar resources, however.

THE FILM RUNS 126 minutes and was shot in Yugoslavia. WRITERS: Berkely Mather & Beverley Cross wrote the script loosely based on Frans G. Bengtssons novel.

872141,1,6304329008,"Review of The Long Ships
Hot Toasty Rag, November 28, 2017

In this Viking epic, Richard Widmark plays a Norseman with a talent for telling tall tales. Theres a flaw in that plot description, however. Richard Widmark sounds like a cowboy, not a Viking, so how can he convincingly pull off his schemes? He cant. But, for some unknown reason, no one questions his supposed heritage; when hes captured by Prince Sidney Poitiers guards, he tells a tale of a giant golden bell, supposedly worth millions. Sidney agrees to spare his life if he helps him find the bell. Meanwhile, Sidneys wife, Rosanna Schiaffino, is more than frustrated with her husbands lack of intimate interest in her, and with another good-looking man in the picture, she might look elsewhere to get her needs met.

While you're busy scratching your head wondering why anyone cast Dick Widmark in a period piece, youll find out hes not the only unconvincing Viking in the movie. Russ Tamblyn plays his younger brother, whos in love with Bebe Loncar, and both of them are painfully contemporary. The Long Ships gives period pieces a bad name. Its full of expensive sets and costumes, action scenes and supposedly dramatic dialogue, but its just too ridiculous to be taken seriously. Russ gets to demonstrate his famous acrobatic talents in some of the fight scenes, but you're better off watching Tom Thumb.

The only realistic part of the film is actually quite disturbing. In the middle of the night, the Vikings break into the safety of palace. They see dozens of scantily-clad sleeping women and absolutely lose their minds and attack them. The women are screaming, and the men grab incessantly, pulling them offscreen, dragging them to the floor or wherever they can exert their force and have their way. Since the film was made in 1964, nothing besides forced kisses are shown, but its an extremely upsetting scene since thats probably exactly what happened back then.

Even though 1964 was a more liberated film-making era than the previous decade, certain restrictions were still in place. The womens costumes bared their bellybuttonswhich was previously a no-nobut their torsos were covered with a flesh-colored mesh so as to not shock the audience. Actually, the mens costumes were much more risqu than the womens! The Vikings were clad in leather tunics, with extremely short shorts underneath. Russ and Dick seemed to be in constant competition as to who could show off their biceps more often and who could wear the shortest Speedo.

The bottom line is yes, Richard Widmark is incredibly good-looking, but this is a pretty terrible movie. You don't need to watch it, unless you're having serious beefcake withdrawals.",1511827200,,2695,4.98

The movie plot has been outlined by others so I will skip that. It is meant as pure fun so don't take it seriously or expect historical accuracy (the book is much better in  that regard). The one thing I really loved was the music. I once had the main theme on a 45 record but then found a very rare copy of the full soundtrack and bought that (still have it today). Good movie to relax to, one could see the main stars were having fun and there is humor interspersed throughout along with some action and angst.

872470,4,6304329008,"This is a fun and enjoyable film so long as you are able to suspend a fair bit of disbelief. Richard Widmark manages to dive from a Tower window of the Moorish palace rpresumably into the Mediteranean Sea and then washes up some time later alive in Viking Scandinavia. Not a bad swim. The Golden Bell as tall as three men and presumably weighing many hundreds of tons breaks it's ropes while being lowered onto a barge and falls into the sea where it floats happily along. And this is my favourite, capital punishment in the Moorish Kingdom is via the mare of steel, a device closely resembling the forty foot razorblade that was the subject of many childhood jokes around my way, and the breaking mechanism is the same.

For all that, I loved this film as a pre teen and still like it today.",1477526400,,792,4.424657534246576

872479,1,6304329008,"i understand the majority opinion that we should all lighten up and enjoy the ""rollicking"" and ""action packed"" spirit of this film. but the problem is that inebriation is required for that state of mind. the action is packed like a rollicking bag of rocks, or a swashbucking tub of clichs.

the swashbuckle doesn't really create a plot or develop the one dimensional characters, so the film is just a flimsy series of episodic set pieces -- the telling of a fable, a scowling moor, a neglected wife, ignominious capture, a dungeon of torture, a daring escape, boorish vikings, banquet pratfalls, busty maidens aching for touch, a midnight raid, a storm sloshed ship, a shipwreck, various hand to hand battles, another capture, another daring escape, harem intrigues, ceremonial execution (wait! i'll take you to the bell already!), finding the treasure, retrieving the treasure, triumphal return, surprise ambush, anguished deaths, last minute reprieves, boisterous finale.

the conceit that snarky widmark and sissified tamblin can pass as vikings is too risible to be ironic, especially when they prance around their viking father, the slobbermouthed, bleary eyed and visibly greasy oskar homolka.

what's your favorite detail, fans? is it when the solid gold bell tumbles down the mountain and into the sea, only to visibly float in the water? sidney poitier exuberantly sleeked with pomade? homolka's drooling diction? those busty maidens, nordic and african, who just are not getting enough of what all maidens need?

man, this was a dispiriting experience. even when fast forwarding through all the jumping out windows and flailing with swords, ""Long Ships"" is a pastiche of pointlessness.",1463961600,,1695,5.289962825278811

The fight scenes are pretty bad, but I guess that is to be expected.  To be honest, my one gripe is Richard Widmark, I thought he was a terrible viking, and only in his scenes did I feel like the movie slipped bad.  I mean as soon as he started talking, it felt like he was in the wrong movie.  If his performance doesn't bother you, you'll probably enjoy the movie.  Sidney Poitier was outstanding.

They definitely could have classed up the movie a bit with better scenery, and props, I mean The Vikings with Kirk Douglas had already been out for years, and is a true classic.  I'm guessing this one didn't have the budget?  Not sure.  Anyway, its okay.",1418860800,,807,4.25

There is a legend about a great bell, called ""The Mother of Voices,"" made of pure gold, three times the size of a man, made by monks many years ago... This is the story told in the marketplace by a Viking called Rolfe. This information finds its way to a loyal guard and he informs the Islamic ruler Aly Manush, who is obsessed with finding the bell. Aly Manush interagates the lost Viking, but Rolfe claims not to know where the bell is, and escapes, back to his homeland. All for the purpose to convince his father and brother to give him a ship and crew to replace the one he lost. But, his father is broke.

After stealing the Norse king's funeral ship and his beautiful daughter, Gerda (Beba Loncar), Viking brothers Rolfe (Richard Widmark) and Orm (Russ Tamblyn) set off in search of a fabled solid gold bell. During the course of their journey, they encounter a massive storm, a mutinous crew, and troops led by El Mansuh, Prince of the Moors (Sidney Poitier). This was a period adventure and based on the novel by Frank G. Bengtsson.

It was a great film that had action and adventure with superstitious atmosphere that implied anything could happen. It ended with the possibility of a sequel, which unfortunately never happened. That was the only let-down.",1402790400,4,1426,4.654761904761905

His pronouncements are oh so serious.
Not to be outdone, the Viking princess and Viking warrior intent on thwarting Richard Widmark's character's self interest come across just as pompous as Poitier.

873850,3,6304329008,"This film is good for me for one reason and one reason only - it is Hollywood once again showing that the Moors were black even if the Aryan Nations Spanish/Portuguese in the diaspora want to say otherwise.  It is a good adventure film and a Poitier film that even Poitier lovers hardly heard of.  It is good that they show the clearly black Moor (although he could not have kinky hair), but Poitier is the only clearly black one there - the rest are slaves!  His wife is Italian!

Of course since this is 1963, they cannot have the black man be the hero over whites, so they throw some Vikings into the mix and make them the stars.  Of course most of the viewing audience would not be aware of why Poitier is in the lead role of a black man in Spain and why the Vikings are in a position that the black man finds himself in today.  During this time period, this is when the black man ruled over parts of Europe (Spain, Portugal, a little of France and some of Italy, now you know why they are dark...) and was on top and almost had had the world. This is the period that creates the turning point in world history and is why Europeans have a love HATE relationship with the black man.  That is, they love what blacks create, but hate the fact they created something and not whites.  The black man once ruled and educated the European and is responsible for his having been able to break out of Europe and venture off into ""new worlds"" for the first time (1492) in their history outside of the Roman Empire (Italian, not British, French etc.) or the Greeks, who dealt more with Asia and Africa than Europe.

Aside from the writing out the black man from this chapter in history, even Hollywood at arguably the peak of racism in America knew they had to make at least some of the Moors clear blacks, as opposed to the usual black-faced white actors who play people you can't pin-point.  Of course there are the black-faced peoples in the background.  I guess they could not find enough black actors.  Either that, or they just did not want the audience to get too much of the  wrong idea - that the black man ruled parts of Europe.

Now, about this disc.  The cover is nice, but this disc is only 4.13GB!  I thought that dual layers were the standard?  I guess they are doing this to make DVD's even cheaper.  I would have bought it on Blu-Ray but it is not out and probably will not be out for some time.  The picture looks like they grabbed it from TV or a somewhat high quality tape of some kind.

Over the years there weren't many films of this type produced. It wasn't until a decade and a half later when Star Wars hit the big screen that I got to see another variation of the elements which make the Long Ships great. While critics missed the point of Star Wars and compared it to 2001: A Space Odyssey, I could instantly see that Lucas was far more influenced (story-wise) by films such as the Long Ships than he was 2001. In order to enjoy either film, you have to leave reality behind and become a kid again.

If you find science and history class more fun than reading a fairy tale, you won't like this film.

873939,1,6304329008,"Anyone tempted to believe this racist nonsense should give themselves a small history lesson by reading what happened to the Vikings when they raided the coast of Moslem Spain in 844, and again in 859.  Nor should your interest in world history end there.  Contrary to what the film makers, among others, would have you believe, Islam in that day was perhaps the most enlightened society in the world.  European nobility sent their children to universities in Cordova and elsewhere in the Moslem world.  Science, mathematics, and medical technologies were greatly expanded in the Islamic lands.  Since their empire had spread primarily through military conquest, they were for a long time the world's sole superpower.  I have more than a passing interest in history, and so I don't care for blatantly bad portrayals of it.  This film serves mainly as an outrageous example of Western style propaganda, pandering to the tastes of xenophobic ignoramuses and directed against the peoples of the Near East, a time honored custom that goes back at least as far as The Song Of Roland (the hero of which was actually done in by Basques, not Moslems).  Speaking of which, Charlemagne himself thought twice about invading the kingdom of Moorish Spain (which remained firmly entrenched on the European continent for some 500 years, its later period spanning almost the entirety of the Crusades).  But in this film, a band of Viking raiders takes over an entire walled city (even though, as I understand it, Moslem military strategy at this time relied more on mobility than fixed defenses) because the Moslem warriors were so afraid of them.  Right.  With this kind of propaganda continuously churned out by Hollywood (one exception would be 1935's oddly even-handed production The Crusades, historically inaccurate though it is) and other film industries, not to mention other media, it's no wonder that these attitudes have long helped to color foreign policy.

Continuing the long tradition of portraying Near Easterners in Western media as inept, cowardly villains, the torch was passed into the Twentieth Century through the fiction of at least two prominent writers (though there are of course many others) of note:  Robert E. Howard and J.R.R. Tolkien.  Much as I love and admire the respective works of both authors, their colorful, if disparaging, representations of the inhabitants of that part of the world should not be mistaken for history, as many seem to do.  But thusly is the multimedia stereotype maintained even when a casual reading of actual world history should indicate otherwise.

I love a good, challenging, period war drama along the lines of Spartacus, Excalibur, The Warlord, Cromwell, The Last Valley, Waterloo, Lawrence of Arabia, just to name a few, but this doesn't come anywhere near that level of quality.

I give this flick a one star rating, mainly for Richard Widmark's performance, who was convincing in his role as the dickering, resourceful and quick witted Viking chieftain.  Also for a portion of the cinematography and, if my memory serves, at least some of the rousing and catchy soundtrack (would that the movie itself had been worthy of it).  Sidney Poitier, miscast as the Moorish prince, unfortunately turned in one of the worst performances of his illustrious career, portraying his character with the abysmally heavy hand the director no doubt required of the role.

A better movie of this type would be The Vikings, if you haven't already seen it.

There are so many minor plot flaws in this thing that it really gets annoying at time (The Vikings didn't realize their ship had a black sail until they unfurled it? Rolfe SWAM all the way from North Africa to Norway?) but it can be a fun movie at times.",1198800000,,455,4.181818181818182
873941,4,6304329008,"Sidney Poitier ,quoted in Halliwell's Movie and Video Guide ,said ""To call it a disaster would be an understatement "".Mr Poitier is being a tad on the stuffy side here ,methinks ,and certainly the movie is a lot less straightlaced than typical Poitier movies from the era and his stiff performance (to be fair he is miscast)is no great help to the movie .

Richard Widmark plays Rolfe ,a Viking whose vessel sinks in a storm and who is eking out a living telling traveller's tales in the marketplace .One such tale is of a giant bell cast of solid gold and he is overheard bysoldier's of the local ruler El Mansuh (Poitier).Knowing this bell to be an obsession of their boss they take him prisoner and bring him to El Mansuh. Being an enterprising sort of chap Rolfe escapes and the enxt time we se e him he is emerging from the waters of his homeland. Norway .(Presumably he swam all the way from North Africa! Not  very credible surely)

He arrives at an opportune time ,as the King of Norway ,Harald (Clifford Evans)has just taken delivery of an impressive new ship which Rolfe hijacks and sets out to locate the great bell .An understandably miffed (annoyed)Harold sets out in pursuit .The biggest worry for Rolfe however is another shipwreck and once again falling into the clutches of El Mansuh.

Eventually the two join forces -the Arabs needing Viking seamanship skills .Not that the"" marriage"" comes about without problems including a dice with an especially malevolent death device called the ""mare of steel "" things build to a lively climax as the forces involved meet in the city square as the expedition returns home to El Mansuh's city

Christopher Challis makes a key contribution with some lustrous cinematography-the movie has a sheen to it that makes it a visual treat .There is also a rousing score

Neither Widmark or Poitier are at their absolute best but Widmark brings some dash and brio to the role ;Poitier seems too reserved in his portrayal of the tyraniccal El Mansuh-almost as if he thought he was playing Othello. Russ Tamblyn brings athleticism and vigour to his role as Rolfe's right hand man and a solid ,mostly British cast flesh out roles as crew  and royalty .Look out in  particular for Edward Judd ,Gordon Jackson and David Lodge -all stalwarts of the UK screen .The most enjoyable -not best just the most enjoyable-is a ripe slice of ham from Oscar Homilka as the roistering drunken Viking lord Krok

The broad comedic sceens don't work for me and the gay stereotype which is the Lionel Jeffries character is singularly unfortunate .On balance this is an enjoyabe movie which performs one useful historic service -it reminds us that the Vikings roamed all over the known (and unknown )world including North Africa

873948,4,6304329008,"I saw this film at least 22 times as a kid in the mid-sixties. It is a truly fascinating adventure story, based on a famous book by Frans G. Bengtsson. An adventurous Viking is marooned by a storm somewhere in Byzantium. By chance, a group of monks take him into their care at a time when they are in the process of making a Bell of pure gold. A bell as large as a house and made by the donations of pagan relics and the captured gold of Islam from the time of the Crusades. The existence of ""The Mother of Voices"" seems like a myth but like all myths, it also has a basis in fact. The bell and the storyline revolves around the obsession of two men. El Mansur, played by Sidney Poitier, who means to return it to Islam, and the Viking plunderer, Richard Widmark, who intends to find it for the sake of his own fame and to redeem his poor village and family. What follows is a great and glamorous adventure story, well plotted and interesting. Especially for young minds geared to the idea of the quest. There are some problems with casting and it is not to be taken too seriously as there are intentional humorous scenes in the production.

874052,3,6304329008,"Finding a good viking film is never an easy task. One must wade through a lot of bad movies before discovering that rare gem. The 1964 lusty epic ""The Long Ships"" is not a gem. In fact, it is so laughably bad as to be amusing - but that's a good thing.

Certainly not as horrid as ""The Norsemen,"" but far inferior to ""The Vikings"" and ""The 13th Warrior,"" this film tells the tale of a band of vikings in search of a huge golden bell. Led by Richard Widmark and Russ Tamblyn (that's right, Russ Tamblyn), these colorful warriors steal a ship, oar through a maelstrom and battle Moors, all the while trying to find that darn golden bell.
Sidney Poitier, starring in probably the worst film of his career, is the leader of the Moors. He's got a sexually frustrated wife back home who's irritated with his obsession with finding this golden bell. Everyone's looking for the golden bell. I suppose when found, it can be melted down and provide untold riches for all involved. Which is really kind of a shame, because when it rings, it makes such beautiful music.
Anyway, Poitier and the Vikings reluctantly join forces to find the golden bell - which is about 20 feet tall. Such a golden bell must be awfully heavy, but it's carted around on a Gilligan's Island-like raft and pulled by a few horses once they reach land. At one point the bell falls down a cliff, killing a lot of vikings, and then oddly floating on the ocean. Thank goodness it didn't sink because I don't think viking scuba gear had been invented yet.
Oh well, I first saw this film as a child and thought it was the greatest darn film in history. It plays like a comic book, with Richard Widmark delivering Indiana Jones wisecracks throughout. It's a lot of fun if in the right mood and the battle sequences are exciting. The sets are also appropriately elaborate.
The film clocks in at over two hours and it drags because of it. But to edit ""The Long Ships"" down would mean to delete the scene where the vikings stumble upon a female harem. Rather than escape with their lives, they decide to sample the wares, which of course leads to chaos.

I think some of the negative reviews must come from people who took this movie far too seriously. What we have here is good, old-fashioned ""hokum""--the actors knew it--the director knew it--so lighten up, and enjoy this rousing, exciting adventure.

I'm sure that Widmark and Poitier realised that they were not going to win Oscars for this movie--but sometimes even the best actors like to do things that are fun ! I suspect that Widmark was in his 40s, yet like that other famous ""viking""--Kirk Douglas--he obviously stayed in shape, and acquits himself well in the action scenes. Mr. Poitier must have had a ball, wearing an outlandish wig, and flowing ""Moorish"" robes.

Movie buffs will see many familiar faces in this one, although--in a number of cases--they may not be so apparent at first. Terrific character actor, Lionel Jeffries, with heavy make-up and a top-knot, is the eunuch guarding the harem ( not too well ! )--his purpose is clearly comic relief. Stalwart British actors, David Lodge and Edward Judd, are ""on board"" as thick-bearded vikings. Another viking is played by that quintessential Scotsman, Gordon Jackson--I suppose some Scots might have travelled to Norway ? Clifford Evans ( on leave from Hammer Films ? ) is dignified as the viking king. Russ Tamblyn, always an acrobatic, athletic force, has his moments as the younger viking brother. Rossana Shiaffino and Beba Loncar are beautiful women--but that's all. Finally, the award for unbelievable over-acting goes to Oscar Homolka, as Widmark's ( and Tamblyn's ) father--his ""drunken"" scene at the mandatory ""viking orgy"" is quite surreal !

There are a number of memorable scenes, and I agree with other reviewers about the ""Mare of Steel""--in 40 years, I never forgot it. You will not forget the poor ""guinea pig"" selected for a demonstration of this lethal device. Will Mr. Widmark be next ? Start chewing those finger nails !

One small criticism--as I mentioned, Columbia has done a beautiful job of presenting this film in all of it's colourful glory. However, someone in the ""proof-reading"" department really blew it. On the cover of the DVD case, the two stars' names are at the top--Mr. Poitier's name is spelled incorrectly. He is only one of the biggest stars in the history of film--so this glitch is unfortunate.

Anyway--for history scholars and lovers of authenticity--stay away. For the rest of us who like pure entertainment, ""The Long Ships"" is an exciting voyage !

A very sad footnote, dated 27 March 2008--Mr. Richard Widmark has passed away at 93, after a long illness. One of the finest actors of his generation, he impressed movie fans with many fine performances--another great star gone.",1057017600,90,2935,5.002049180327869
874137,5,6304329008,"This is one of my favourite fantasy film. I remember seeing it at a Saturday matinee in the early 60s. Wonderful stuff. One other reviewer put it succinctly: it's like a Ray Harryhausen movie minus the monsters. However, the golden bell (the mother of voices), Mare of Steel, and the overall mood of the film is worth the watch. I'm sure this must have been a right of passage for both George Lucas and Stephen Speilberg. Even Richard Whitmark's corney imitation of a norse adventurer is fascinating. Sidney Portier's portrayal of the moorish king also must have inspired Prince (you'll see what I mean). This film is worth the purchase. Buy some popcorn, sit back, sing along with the great theme song and enjoy a great yarn!!",1056758400,4,727,4.732283464566929
874138,5,6304329008,"My Dad took me to see this film when I was 10, in 1964. In 1988 I took my Mum on a retirement 'journey' that ventured through Yugoslavia. I swam in the town of Budva (Montenegro) and remembered something...this was where 'The Long Ships' was filmed! I remembered the scenery from 1964! I tried to ask the locals (in my pigeon Russian) but only a few seemed to remember...then I found it...the Great Golden Bell! 'The Mother of Voices'...O.K. it was wood, the gold leaf having long ago fallen off but what the hell! Do see this film! It's a great adventure with a brilliant score and an ensamble cast that obviously had great fun. 'The Vikings' takes realism to the 9th degree, this film takes adventure and mid-60's film making to an equal plateau...enjoy it!",1052265600,6,759,4.588235294117647
874139,5,6304329008,"Finally, a digital ride on the Mare of Steel. Widmark, and Poitier play it to the max in one of the best Viking films of all time. A must see for action/adventure lovers.",1052092800,4,170,4.181818181818182
874140,4,6304329008,"Now some will tell you ""Vikings"" is the best or some other film. I myself have a copy of ""Vikings"" too. But when it comes to the most fun I would have to say ""The Long Ships"" wins the prize. Take a swarthy group of Vikings on the quest for a giant golden bell, a dangerous sea journey, an army of Moors to battle, a ruthless King, and a fiendishly unusual device, ""The Steel Mare"", to kill a man and you have a classic.

It has great scenery, sets, costumes, music, and the cast does a great job of hamming it up. Richard Widmark and Sidney Poitier are perfect. You can tell they all had fun doing this movie. Though we don't get to see some carnage such as the results of riding the Mare, who needs to, my imagination works fine thank you. Quite honestly the in your face gratuitous gore of many other movies is overrated. When you think about it there are few movies about Vikings, and of those you definitely want to add this to your collection. The whole family should get a kick out of this one.

You will be humming the theme song after the movie, and may find yourself swinging pillows at one another seeing imaginary Moors. I couldn't wait any longer to see it on TV or until this comes out on DVD so I bought it on VHS. Now that I got the VHS copy it is coming out on DVD. DOH! I ended up buying this DVD and it is incredibly sharp. What a beautiful job of transferring it. Not much in the way of extras but still a wonderful DVD to own.",1046131200,15,1446,4.106007067137809
874141,5,6304329008,"This is a rousing rock 'em and sock 'em Viking movie.  It is far better than ""The Vikings"" (Kirk Douglas) which more or less launched the genre.  The storyline moves at a breakneck pace. This is a ripping adventure film about a bunch of rogues who steal a Long Ship and head out into the unknown near ""the edge of the world"" in search of loot.  There is a tremendous amount to like about this movie.  It is tongue-in-cheek at times, but ultimately this is an old-style adventure film.  The film is very unpretentious, and accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do, which is entertain.  No dreary political messages here.  This movie is entertaining and great fun, and that's the end of it.
Widmark, Portier, and cast do a fine job.  The acting is consistently good.  Buy it, watch it, keep it.  My only gripe is why can I not find this movie on DVD?",1036627200,4,851,4.397435897435898
874142,3,6304329008,"A real comic book of a movie with a bizarre cast, nonsensical script, shaky special effects, repetitive music yet a striking visual style with occasionally impressive direction. The Long Ships is one of those films that is so awful that it becomes enjoyable - a real Saturday afternoon popcorn flick that would make a great double bill with that other misguided epic - Taras Bulba.
I'm always amazed that Hollywood has not made more films about the Vikings, especially after the success of Kirk Douglas's film in the late fifties. The Long Ships seems a poor relation in comparison - I'm sure the ships were the ones left over from The Vikings. The director of The Long Ships - Jack Cardiff - was director of photography on The Vikings. But there the similarity between the two films ends.
The heroes of this soggy saga are two all-American Norsemen - Richard Widmark and (!) Russ Tamblyn (the only ones without beards) - who lead a motley crew of English, Irish and Scottish Vikings whose thane is a Hungarian (the always watchable Oscar Homolka). The bad guys, by an incredible plot device, are the Moors of North Africa led by an unsmiling and uncomfortable Sidney Poitier. At least the rest of the cast know that the film is tongue in cheek (just listen to the dialogue) but Poitier is so gravely serious that you suspect he is auditioning for Othello. The wonderful British character actor Lionel Jeffries is blacked up as a comic mute eunuch in what must surely be the strangest piece of casting of the century. The female members of the cast were obviously selected for their physical charms rather than any acting ability - and what a great pity it is that Rosanna Schiaffino ever changed out of her initial costume.
The plot revolves around the search for a huge bell made of solid gold - ""as tall as three tall men"". There is plenty of action along the way. A battle on a beach is particularly well staged - the sight of the Moorish army in the distance is reminiscent of Omar Sharif's entrance in Lawrence of Arabia. But there are also too many shots of model ships in a very obvious studio tank. Much of the film was shot in Yugoslavia with Croatia's famous Lim Fjord standing in for Scandinavia. The contrast between the grainly Nordic scenes and the brightly lit Moorish ones is a nice touch and, hopefully, intentional. Much of the film is a cheerful mixture of disparate elements, recklessly blending action, gore and comedy. The one thing everybody remembers about it is the Mare of Steel whose effects are discreetly and, some would say, disappointingly edited.
In the end, it is hard to dislike The Long Ships even if it is a bargain basement variation on a better Viking film. But at least it has more humour than Kirk Douglas's movie. Richard Widmark gets the best line in the film after the mighty golden bell goes crashing down a cliff to the sea. But you still wonder what the casting people were thinking about.",1024876800,17,2936,4.648076923076923
874143,5,6304329008,"This is one of my favorite adventure movies ever. I saw it at the theatre as a kid and bought it a couple of years back on VHS and it is as good as ever. It has the unlikely plot of Vikings and Moors clashing and coming together to find ""the Bell"". Widmark and Portier are great. They really don't make them like this anymore.",1018742400,3,326,4.030769230769231

I own it on VHS, but it would be a great full-screen epic to watch on DVD if it becomes available! Sidney Poitier is excellent as the Saracin lord who is obsessed with the legend of the Golden Bell! Richard widmark has always been one of my favourite actors, and this picture is non-stop thrills,from his daring escape at the beginning of the picture to his;and his viking cohorts brush with "" the mare of death "" (Sids' unique way of dispatching his enemies), near the end. A winner on all counts! - R.L.",1016928000,3,592,4.342342342342342
