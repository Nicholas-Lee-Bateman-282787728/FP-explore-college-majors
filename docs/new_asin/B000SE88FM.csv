I am a fan of Marilyn, but this was extremely over priced for what little I got with NO SOUND!!!. Are you a good mouth reader? Through the whole thing their was no sound only footage! This should have been mention, it would have been extremely helpful! The first part lasts only 3 MINUTES (Marilyn Monroe At Tokyo Army Hospital, Tokyo Japan (1954)(""Ms. Monroe visits hospitalized military men as she brightens the lives of wounded soldiers with her infectious smile"")and the 2nd part lasts 7 Minutes(""Marilyn Monroe shows in Korea (1954)- Ms. Monroe performs for the troops in this rare glimpse of her army base tour through Asia"")! For what you get it is not worth the over $15.00 with s & H that I paid! It was way over priced with NO SOUND! I could not tell what she, Marilyn Monroe was saying and all the GI's in the EXTREMELY SHORT BRIEF CLIPS! I was very disappointed! The clips did not show her shows through from begging to end thoroughly. They were all cut up in pieces and clips! The only way I knew with out sound she was singing, ""Diamonds are a girls best friend"", in a brief 10 or so seconds cut up clip, was due to the movie on another DVD I own and Another DVD I own has a more complete showing with sound of this extremely short clip/piece, but at least is shows more then what I got in this DVD!  They should have had put that one in this one! It looks like a seriously bad editing job with numbers short pieces and clips, that do not show everything it should. I wish some one who had previously rated this DVD would have mentioned this, in addition to; how short the DVD really is! Part of the time of the total 10 minutes was many signs through out the clips of where Marilyn was and on what date it was. The majority of them were very hard to read! I feel they could have done a better job to organize these clips, with a commentary/Narration at least! The price is overly inflated for what very little you get! Not all the footage that is shown is of Marilyn Monroe! They show clips of the show of other performers, who I do not recognize! This DVD is made by: Quality Information Publishers 2007

Shows Marilyn visiting troops in the hospital mostly and kids as well, even signing a few autographs. Definately worth owning!!!!!! If you are an avid MM fan like me, you MUST get this.",1287619200,,282,4.4423076923076925
8205160,5,B000SE88FM,"Precious minutes of Marilyn's visit to a hospital and during her concerts in Asia. Far from the medias, Marilyn looks even more glamorous and her warmth towards the injured soldiers is poignant and tangible. No sound... but the images speak for themselves. A must for Marilyn fans!",1285372800,,281,5.0
8205161,5,B000SE88FM,"This cd is amazing. It is perfect for any Marilyn Monroe fan. As a long time fan, I am always looking for new video of Marilyn. At first I kept putting this off because I thought I had seen all Korea footage that is around, but I was wrong. Most of the footage is of Marilyn in the hospital. It shows her walking around and talking to so many people. Definitely purchase this and enjoy some Marilyn footage that is so rare!",1243296000,,423,4.170731707317073
