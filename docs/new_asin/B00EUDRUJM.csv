I think the favorite of all of them was the chocolate episode! Thanks for another great DVD, NCircle!",1391385600,,271,4.230769230769231
8609464,5,B00EUDRUJM,"I think the Cat in the Hat television series is extremely clever! I really appreciate all the creativity that goes into the development of the show, and my kids love that it makes them laugh while they learn new things. My kids and I were very excited to be able to preview the newest release in the series titled The Cat in the Hat: Lets Celebrate. The dvd includes five educational episodes with a running time of about 60 minutes. In these episodes, Nick and Sally adventure all over with the Cat to learn about the world around them. One of my favorite aspects of the show is that the characters travel to fictional places like the beaches of Splishy Splash and the Snowy Blowy mountains, which makes the show extra silly for kids, while at the same time it teaches real scientific principles. On this dvd release, two of the episodes instruct viewers on how chocolate and glass are made. In another episode, we learn how the giraffe weevil wraps a leaf to protect its egg. We also learn how different birds catch their meals in one episode. In the final episode, we learn about the fundamentals of keeping our balance. The dvd also includes a few extras that are fun and informational. My kids are ages 2, 5 and 7. They all enjoy the Cat in the Hat because it is comical, but the older two also appreciate that they are learning new things while they watch. This is such a great television series, and the newest release doesnt disappoint so pick up your copy on January 14!",1388966400,2,1479,4.481481481481482

My kids love that silliness and comedy of The Cat in the Hat, I love that they are learning along the way.  The DVD provides 4 episodes that provide different learning opportunities, everything from how chocolate is made to how different birds catch fish.  I've even caught myself sitting down and watching a show or two with them.  Its great family fun.",1388361600,,462,4.597560975609756
