6598912,5,B00MP2FWE0,"This is now one of my most favorite anime's of all time. It's all weird and crazy like One Piece which is another one of my favorites. The characters are weird and awesome and the animation is bright and colorful. If you have the first volume already then you already know what the story is and I'm not going to go into detail about it. Volume 2 picks up right where Volume 1 left off with them in the ice area. If you loved volume 1 then get ready for more awesomeness. Highly recommended if your into One Piece, Dragon Ball Z, or even Fairy Tail.",1422662400,5,548,4.179245283018868

8673743,5,B00MP2FWE0,Toriko is within the genre of shonen with other juggernaut anime such as naruto or dragon ball z. It's a funny show about a gourmet hunter. A person who devotes his life to discovering new and delishes foods. $22 for 25 episodes is really quite a good deal. Less than $1 per episode while shows like naruto sell limited episodes like 15 for more money.,1482537600,,352,4.430769230769231
