2075879,4,B0002BSHDY,"This is an episode from the TV series (depending upon your location, called ""Lonely Planet"", ""Globe Trekker"", or ""Pilot Productions"").
You can see more about it at [...]
This episode covers travels on the North Island and the South Island of New Zealand.
Your travel host is Ian Wright (a truly zany bloke).
Focus is on travel-on-a-shoestring methods, and off-the-beaten-path sights, and gives you a realistic sense of ""being there"".
Locations visited: [North Island] Auckland, Maori meeting house in Matauri Bay, Bay of Islands, Rotorua volcanic area, crossing at Wellington; [South Island] Christchurch, Queenstown, and Fox Glacier.
Although funny as ever, this episode was not able to thorougly cover many worthy sights in a (what is for most people undexpectedly) large country.",1089504000,26,782,5.418032786885246

8025888,2,B0002BSHDY,"I'm getting to the point where, if I see the label ""Globe Trekker"" on a travel DVD, I consider not watching it.  Globe Trekker is notorious for having hosts who do their utmost to make themselves the center of attention vs. creating quality travel shows.  Admittedly, Ian Wright (the host of this segment) is humorous at times.  However, true to the Globe Trekker ""modus operandi,"" he is primarily an attention-seeking ham and his antics often detract from the viewing experience.  Moreover, I'm also a little bit puzzled by Globe Trekker's decision making process as to what they believe constitutes quality travel television.  Case in point -- their show is only 60 minutes long, and they try to cram coverage of an entire country into that short period of time.  One would assume that, given the brevity of the show, they would want to present the quintessential elements that best define the essence of each area that their host is visiting.  However, after 2 weary days of travel for Ian down to Auckland, what do they decide to focus on?  Answer: Ian paying about $50 to ""walk"" down the face of a skyscraper - something that 99% of the people who actually spend their money to travel to New Zealand are not going to do.  (They subsequently have Ian doing other ""extreme sport"" activities in other parts of New Zealand as well).  While I'm sure these activities must be fun and exciting, I question their validity in the context of a travel show.  I could see them as part of a ""bonus segment"" in the DVD, but not as a primary focus.  This being said, I can only surmise that the executives at Globe Trekker prefer to focus on ""trendy"" activities they believe will appeal to silver spoon 20 - 30 somethings who are backpacking around the world on their parents' dime.
In summary, just like in previous Globe Trekker presentations, the New Zealand episode attempts to cover too much in a 60 minute segment.  Moreover, the host acts as if his personality is much more important that the actual travel experience.  Finally, much of the focus is on activities that most travelers to the region will not be doing. For anyone looking for good insight into travel down to New Zealand, this isn't the DVD that you want to watch.",1332288000,2,2225,4.671794871794872
8025889,2,B0002BSHDY,"Cheesy, and wow - a giant advertisement for companies providing tours in New Zealand. Can't find a nice travel video of NZ that gives an overall scenic view of the country, with an emphasis on Auckland.",1276300800,5,202,4.638888888888889

8025891,1,B0002BSHDY,This couldn't be much worse.  It was more about the host trying to convince you that he was cute than about New Zealand.  A wasted hour.,1217030400,,136,4.1923076923076925
8025892,1,B0002BSHDY,"Cheaply shot, unflattering look at New Zealand.  Apparently the place is really pretty, but it doesn't come through on this DVD.)",1190937600,2,129,5.142857142857143
8025893,3,B0002BSHDY,"I am looking into emigrating to New Zealand and will watch pretty much anything covering it.  They completely skipped Wellington (on the NORTH island, folks) which was disappointing, but there was enough to keep me interested.  Definitely focused on traveler's needs, not immigrants of course!

Also check out Billy Connolly's (the stand up comic) tour of New Zealand.  In between his routines, he does the sights.  He is much more familiar with the place than Ian is.

There is also a documentary on walking the Milford Track, beautiful.  Unfortunately I don't know the details on finding it.",1171929600,2,593,5.051546391752577

8025896,1,B0002BSHDY,"In a nutshell: He travels 1/2 way around the world to go show us the bars and thrill rides of New Zealand and only mentions in passing the things that someone would really want to go to New Zealand to see.

If you really want to see a show about New Zealand, forget this one. If you want to see a show about bars, why not just go to a local bar?",1108252800,32,345,3.7916666666666665
