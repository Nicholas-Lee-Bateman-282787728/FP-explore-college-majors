846755,1,6304316267,"Yeah, right!
This film reeks.  A bunch of people decide to disregard all traffic laws, waste gasoline, and endanger innocent lives just to be the first of many to drive cross-country.  Hoo-Boy!  Now that's  entertainment!
I supose a bunch of guys juiced up on testosterone might  like this film, but that's about it.",943142400,2,316,4.886792452830188
846756,1,6304316267,"Burt Reynolds was the biggest movie star in the world when (1980) he made CANNONBALL RUN.  Did he appear in this bomb to test his fans' patience?  Did he really think the script was humorous or exciting?  Maybe the  filmmakers spent so much time recruiting CANNONBALL RUN's all-star cast  that they forgot to write jokes or develop any story.  Except for Dom  Deluise's very funny performance, the only laughs are at the paying  audience's expense.  Burt Reynolds redeemed himself with the appropriately  titled STARTING OVER once the stench of CANNONBALL RUN died down.",936316800,2,570,5.032258064516129

847087,5,6304316267,"Crazy, madcap fun movie I remember from my youth. Tremendous cast. I can only imagine how fun and goofy it would have been to be there on the set while these Hollywood icons ""tore it up""! The bloopers in the end credits are only a taste of how it really was, I'm sure. A must have to add to your collection alongside Cannonball 2, the Smokey and the Bandit films, The Blues Brothers, Caddyshack, and similar great comedies from the early 70's to mid 80's. None of these movies were polluted by the political correctness that we've been annoyed with since the 90's.",1519948800,,564,4.485436893203883

847089,4,6304316267,This is by far one of my favorite and iconic movies would watch it over and over again.

847223,5,6304316267,"Okay, yes, I agree this is far from being the world's greatest movie, but it was never meant to be. The humour is childish and silly - but delightfully so. It's wonderfully entertaining ... and this bluray edition is the best I've seen this movie look since I saw it on the big screen as a kid. The print and restoration is as clean as I've ever seen for a 1980s movie, and it brings this classic to life. Although the disk might be lacking on special features, the movie (and the fact that it includes english subtitles) are all I really care about. This gets a 100% score from me.

847352,4,6304316267,"Just finished watching ""The Cannonball Run"" released by Warner Brothers.
""The Cannonball Run"" ironically is based on a real race that used to be held annually in the Untied States.  I do not know if this race is still being held today, but if so, it's being held under the radar.
""The Cannonball Run"" loosely adapts some of the incidents from the real race - like using an ambulance to transport a ""patient"" across state lines because flying would kill her; to an Arab Sheikh competing in the race; to two women drivers using their attributes to get out of speeding tickets.
It's a toss up as to who steals this movie - Dom Deluise as Captain Chaos, or Roger Moore lampooning himself.
A Great '70s Movie.
Highly Recommended!

Then add in a very young Jackie Chan, Dean Martin and Sammy Jr...  The cast goes on and on and funnier and funnier.  I hope Hollywood never remakes this.  If they do, then Captain Chaos can have at them.  Seen it dozens of times, will probably see it some more.  Childhood favorite still in the top 100 so many years later.  The outtakes at the end, you can see the genuine inability to keep it together making for what was obviously a fun shoot for this crew.  If you haven't seen it, buy it.  Watch it.

848232,5,6304316267,"The Cannonball Run, a film originally hitting screens in 1981, is still pretty entertaining today. You do notice the old grainy style look of the film it was shot on when watching it on a high definition TV.  A lot of the actors have passed away but they all did a great job in this one.  Cannonball certainly had a heap of stars, some were nearing the end of their careers (at least as A-list actors) and others such as Jackie Chan, we see a small glimpse of what they will become over the next decades.  They all looked like they were having a lot of fun making the film, it certainly comes through the screen as a lot of fun for the viewer.  I hadn't seen this in probably around 30 years, until I got the DVD, but it's a movie I won't be waiting another 30 years before watching again.

The basic plot is that a lot people after some quick cash (the prize money)  enter a race from one side of the US, to the other.  Roads aren't closed for this race though, and the police are out there.  They are aided by a safety conscious fanatic in this one who runs into some of the drivers at the hotel they are staying at before the race who irk him to no end.  It's not helped when a photographer (Farrah Fawcett) he's met is abducted by Burt Reynold's and Dom Deluize to be their ambulance patient.  (They've picked an Ambulance as their vehicle of choice).  Other drivers include, a young Jackie Chan who is playing a version of himself and is driving a technologically advanced Japanese car,  also playing himself is Roger Moore who picks up various beautiful women companions along the way while driving a James Bond type car,  Jamie Farr (they guy who wore dresses in M.A.S.H.) is a tycoon sheik, Sammy Davis Jr, Dean Martin are also in this too.

There are a few plot holes such as they all put a punch card into a box at the beginning the announcer tells the crowd their time is the time between that and an identical one at the finishing line and the quickest time wins, yet we have a race to the line at the end.  There's a big fight scene with bikers (although it is obvious especially with Chan that kicks and punches are not connecting), plenty of sabotaging between the competitors and plenty of police car chases.  There is a fair bit of drink driving in this, which disappeared in the sequel but apart from speeding of course where no one gets hurt, there isn't really anything that keeps this from being family friendly.  I watched this when I was a kid, everyone did, what kid didn't love all the cars?

The DVD cover for some reason has a red Lamborghini on the cover, which of course didn't appear until the sequel.  There is a nice black one in this one with as the police radio tells us ""a couple of great looking chicks in it.""",1464393600,,2746,4.307392996108949

I bought the DVD as I figured the Blu-Ray upgrade may not be that good due to the age of the movie.  Anyone know if the Blu-Ray version as the voice-over edits?,1441497600,,462,4.264367816091954

849251,3,6304316267,"THE CANNONBALL RUN
Classic car race film where car maniacs go into a car racing competition to win thousands & thousands of Dollars
the race is from Connetticut to California
an all star cast are the Drivers, Roger moore, Dean martin, Sammy Davis Jnr, Tara buckman, Adrienne Barbeau, Farrah fawcett
the way this film was shot was definitely a one off, alot of cameras on car hoods driving at extreme High speeds
even some of the camera crew had to drive at high speeds along the cars in the film
according to Hal needhams commentary
still very funny after 35 years, Burt reynolds & Dom De luse are extremely funny Duo
plus i still love the Theme song Cannonball performed by Ray stevens still very catchy rockin' song

the film was first released on DVD with a new Digital remastered transfer in 1:78:1 widescreen
 with an Audio commentary with Director Hal needham as the only special feature
tragically no new retrospect interviews with Burt reynolds or Hal needham was added to this dvd

well it's now on blu-ray by HBO with a new High Definition transfer in the same screen ratio as the DVD 1:78:1
the only difference is the picture quality, the picture is very sharp & clear for sure better quality than the old DVD
plus a new 5.1 Master audio mix has been added which does sound alot better than the Dolby digital sound quality
tragically no new special features for this new blu-ray version
it would've been Great if HBO got a new retrospect interview with Burt reynolds & Hal needham
aswell as Tara buckman & Adrienne Barbeau
but HBO did not bother making an effort, all they did was recycle the old commentary track from the DVD

if you love this old classic Cannonball run like i Do
get the blu-ray version, picture quality looks much better than the old dvd version
5 stars for the film, about 3 stars for this new blu-ray version mainly cause there's no new extras.",1428278400,17,1877,4.5773809523809526

My favorites are Burt Reynolds, Farrah Fawcett, Roger Moore and Dom DeLuise.
I loved how Roger Moore always had a new girl on his arm in every scene and they made fun of the whole James Bond thing.
This movie is really silly but will take you back to your childhood.

It's the movie, in 16:9 fullscreen (i.e. widescreen, but probably not the theatrical release's original aspect ratio) without much in the way of extras.  The movie itself was goofy fun and of course I enjoyed it, but the lackluster packaging left a little to be desired.  I'd love to see a full movie + documentary + interviews set including info on the original race the movie was inspired from...maybe bundle it with Gumball 3000.",1423353600,,478,4.734939759036145

Editing is terrible and so is the acting and situations. Just a bunch of scenes tossed together to get something on film. Don't get me wrong, some of it is definitely fun.

This is a star studded comedy the likes of ""Its A mad mad mad mad world"" meaning its packed with A- list stars! I can remember being a kid & very familiar with Jacky Chan from watching Kung Fu theater on Sunday mornings & how excited I was when I saw him in this movie!  It would be another 20 years before the rest of America would finally catch Chan fever but this may be his debut in an American film? If your a fan of muscle cars or sports cars or hot women or Burt Reynolds or zany comedy then this is a must have for your collection. I can't believe this isn't paired with its sequel but there you go, just good old fashion American Capitalism! This is just good light hearted fun & a chance to get Burt back into more high speed high jinx's after the success of Smokey & the Bandit.",1410220800,2,1002,4.138461538461539

850448,4,6304316267,"Cannonball Run is a comedy action film featuring a host of superstars such as Burt Reynolds as JJ, Roger Moore who plays the role of a man who behaves like a James Bond. Also it must be noted that this film is one of the early appearances of Hong Kong-based action star Jackie Chan, who at that time was a rising star among Asian movie fans but yet unknown to Hollywood. It is based on the real cross-country race and what's funny is that the each team has its own strategy to deal with law enforcement officers. Jackie Chan is supposed to be an Japanese driver equipped with high-tech Subaru vehicle which might have given the inspiration to Knight Rider series. But strangely enough he speaks Cantonese and showcases his kanfu techniques. In American films Asian actors often play the role of characters different from the country of their decent. Japanese-Americans often play the role of Chinese the most notable case of which is Tamlyn Tomita. Hong Kong viewers might not be happy for Chan being changed to Japanese. While Japanese viewers enjoyed it as a practical joke.

Verdict: Waste of talents? Maybe. But it's funny.

850495,2,6304316267,"This is another one of those movies where they put all these famous comedians and actors together for a race type film, and yet they want to call it a comedy, but this one really stunk at being a comedy.  I would say that ""Cannonball Run II"" was marginally better because it featured Ricardo Montelban as Jamie Farr's sheik father, who finances the second race.  Plus, it had Tony Danza, Frank Sinatra, Richard Kiel, Abe Vigoda, Charles Nelson Reilly, and a whole lot of other great stars to help the rather lame comedy.

I don't know why Hollywood thinks that Burt Reynolds was a good investment for comedy and film.  He's rather ridiculous and even annoying as someone who thinks he's some kind of ""lady's fantasy guy"". I hope he realizes how much he embarrasses himself. But, this film had enough other annoyances that takes your mind off of Burt Reynolds. Two people that made this ""Cannonball Run"" a little more stupid than it had to be is the pansy acting of Dom Deluise, and the atrocious farce of Roger Moore thinking (and only thinking, and fantasizing about being) James Bond.

Anyway, I hope that ""Cannonball Run II"" will eventually be released.  I had hoped that these two films would have been released together as a double feature of the same dull concept that they are, because only then will I think it would be worth maybe about six to ten bucks.

I would rather see Burt Reynolds ""Stroker Ace"" released on Blu-Ray instead of this bore of a comedy.  So, let's see what happens for next year for more 80's releases on to Blu-Ray.",1318032000,,1545,4.592727272727273
850496,4,6304316267,"Where to start? This movie is crazy, no doubt. The plot is insane, the stuff they do in this film would never go down with the politically correct age we live in...I can imagine Reynold's comment ""the chocolate monk"" to Sammy Davis nowdays!

I love the one-liners, the constant references to ""Mr..uh...Foyt!,"" Jamie Farr steals the show as the sheik who is determined that the Cannonball Race will ""fall to the forces of Islam!"" and Roger Moore stars as a Jewish rich kid who thinks he's Roger Moore!  There are enough crashes and explosions to put in ten movies, plenty of goofy stuff with ""Captain Chaos"" and the Hell's Angels battle.

Jack Elam is priceless as a creepy proctologist who agrees to go with Reynolds and Deluise for $200....His desires to give an exam to everyone, hilarious!

Jackie Chan is in this movie, super young, full of energy, and trying to watch a porn film ""Behind the Green Door"" that almost gets him killed while driving!

I'm frustrated that so many words were dubbed out of this movie, just like Smokey and the Bandit. I'm not a vulgarity fan but sometimes it works in the film and just makes it funny. The words they substitute are lame and untimely.

I love the Lamborghini scenes and the two girls in the car were even better!

If you don't know the set-up -- in which case, I hope you're as young as my sons, or spent most of your life other than in North America -- it's pretty simple: there was a real, essentially ""outlaw"" cross-country race in the '70s, from the New York area to a Los Angeles suburb, and this movie is the officially-licensed comedy version of those races. A bunch of odd teams -- Dean Martin and Sammy Davis, Jr. dressed up as priests in a Ferrari, Mel Tillis and Terry Bradshaw (and a half-ton of Budweiser) in a painted-over NASCAR vehicle, two guys on a motorcycle, Jamie Farr as a random Arab sheik, and so on -- compete for glory and a big check, by driving as quickly as possible across the country. Our hero is Burt, of course, and his sidekick is Dom DeLuise. They're driving an ambulance, so, for reasons never quite stated by obvious enough for a comedy like this, they need both a doctor and a patient. The former is Jack Elam, in one of his late bug-eyed comedy roles, and the latter is Farrah Fawcett, in a tight shirt and no bra.

A series of gags and car-chase scenes follow, though very little that could be described as a single, coherent plot. But who wanted that, anyway? Eventually, everyone makes it to California and the end of the race. Again, this is a silly comedy, very much of its time -- but that was a fun, easy-going, big-smile kind of time in America, and there's nothing at all wrong with that.",1302912000,,3057,6.154566744730679

850499,5,6304316267,"I love this film. I first saw it as a kid and I'm familiar with most of the cast, so that'll at least partly explain my attraction to it.

Highlights here for me...
- Intro with Lamborghini police chase in desert.
- Real camels in desert intro scene with the sheik.
- Any scene with Roger Moore, Jackie Chan, or Jamie Farr, with their corresponding theme music.
- Jackie Chan's 1st intro to mainstream America, not including his earlier Big Brawl.
- A great cast of stars & neat cars, including a red Ferrari, a silver Aston Martin, and a white Rolls Royce.

Kids today may actually recognize Jackie Chan & Terry Bradshaw before they recognize anybody else. Roger Moore playing Seymour Goldfarb, Jr., a guy who thinks he's Roger Moore, is fantastic to me. He along with his gadget-filled Aston Martin & near James Bond music is almost single-handedly the reason I prefer this 1st film to the sequel. In this 1st movie we also see a lot of the great Lamborghini, whereas in the sequel, the Lamborghini is ditched near the beginning due to a breakdown.

I actually appreciate the humor in this. Jamie Farr as the sheik here is impressively politically incorrect, as is much of the film, but in a mainly tame way. I re-watch this a lot, with my favorite sections being the beginning to Bert Convy riding a motorcycle out of an airplane over Arizona, and then from when Jackie first enters the desert to the end of the film. These beginning & end sequences simply have the most replay value for me.

In the audio commentary, the directer & producer incorrectly state that this is Jackie Chan's 1st American film. The producer later clarifies this, saying it's Jackie's 1st exposure to a broad, American audience. This is mainly true. Jackie's 1st American film was actually the Big Brawl, which was released a year earlier, in 1980. Because Cannonball Run was a huge hit, and the Big Brawl was a huge flop, it's logical that Jackie's 1st widespread introduction to America would be considered Cannonball Run. It actually was my introduction to Jackie Chan, although I didn't become fanatical about him & his movies until I rediscovered him in the mid-90's.

850525,4,6304316267,"I'll begin by saying that this film is a great tribute to Farrah Fawcett. And the media should be ASHAMED of itself for virtually ignoring her death!

This is an interesting movie in that while it appears to be a race across the country, it is a clever group of different comedy acts that are united in a single story.

The story basically involves an illegal race across the country. But we appreciate the film fully if we just enjoy the separated acts of comedy rather than just being concerned with who will win the race.

The 2 main rivals JJ and Jim (Reynolds and Martin) do some deliberate cheating to try to get ahead of the other. But there is something really satisfying about how in the final fight they are fighting back to back.

Victor (Deluise) is an especially interesting character. He seems to be this hopelessly trapped naive and bumbling child in a man's body. But through a conversation with Farrah Fawcett, we come to understand him as he endears himself to us.

Farrah Fawcett's character is especially worth some attention. She seems to start out as this annoying nature lover; but when she is in a sense kidnapped, she adds just the right element of sadness to this comedy: ""This isn't a joke anymore. I've been kidnapped."" A touch of sadness that breaks the comedy a little prevents a comedy from becoming an utter farce. But her character expands to the point where she understands JJ and Victor. And she goes from being hurt and depressed to actually cheering Victor on to win the race. And she gets annoyed by an action that costs them the race.

The Dean Martin / Sammy Davis Jr pair is great also. They disguise themselves as priests; Dean Martin is more often than not sloshed; and of course he is always after women. And there is something too comical about seeing him dressed like a priest punching different members of the cycle gang out.

Roger Moore has an interesting role in that he is playing a character who is impersonating Roger Moore.

Another point worth mentioning is the role of the highway cops who are often outran. The film may appear to be anti cop. BUT, while the cops are often outran, the director is usually careful to film and show that the cop wasn't actually hurt. (Annoyed and outran yes. But not hurt or killed.) And the 2 women wearing tights with their shirts wide open who were seducing their way out of tickets all the way have a hilarious comeuppance when they are caught and stopped by a woman cop. And later we run across 3 cops on the smarter side who stop the sheik and show themselves to be great drivers. Who could forget the Fire Bird cop's line: ""God damned camel jockey!""

I shouldn't ruin the movie for those who haven't seen it. But there is a hilarious end that defies the typical happy end for the main characters JJ and Victor.

Overall it's a great group of comic acts that are unified in a race with just the right touch of sadness. If this film does not become a classic, it will certainly have a cult following.

It held 90 gallons of gasoline and they would get up to 145 MPH at times.  A lot of the situations and characters in the movie were based on real events and people from the races.

850589,4,6304316267,"The Cannonball Run was one of those flicks I saw constantly on TV growing up in the 80's.  I think it was a law that all UHF or like Fox had to play it on the weekends at least once a month or something; this and flicks like Red Dawn or the Outsiders.

For me, this is the prime example of the type of flick that I'd buy in a heartbeat when I see it in the $5.50 bin at Wal-Mart, something that I know I'll watch at least once a year and just has a bunch of fun nostalgia memories to it.  Though while I just showed it to a friend recently and was sort of disappointed by it (we watched this directly after Smokey and the Bandit which is a much tighter film, though it's the same principal creators and actor), I'd have to say this when I was a kid this was my favorite ""grown up"" movie.  There's just something magical about the duo of Dom DeLuise and Burt Reynolds, between the appearances of ""Him"" and the relentless self-mockery of Reynolds, it's just gold to me.

Add to this Adrienne Barbeau's ""Barbeaus"" clad in tight purple Lycra, the Black Lamborghini, Jackie Chan, a silly cameo by Peter Fonda, the amazingly drunk and on-his-death-bed Dean Martin, and some really funny lines from the crazy Jack Elam as Dr. Nikolas Van Helsing and this is a comedy smrgsbord.  Unfortunately it is pretty choppy in terms of editing and flow (the cannonballers don't even start the race until like 50 minutes in) there is a lot to love.

If nothing else this flick was a labor of love for the writer, Brock Yates, and the Director Hal Needham (who organized and participated in the actual Cannonball Run race) which weird gives a little bit of credit to an otherwise insanely over the top madcap romp.  In fact a lot of the background actors and most of the vehicles used were from the real race including the ambulance and the Ferrari.  It's also one of five or so pairings Needham had with Reynolds in the 70's and 80's including Smokey and the Bandit I+II, Hooper, Stroker Ace, and the Cannonball Run sequel.",1244678400,,2004,4.380053908355795

850592,3,6304316267,"Burt Reynolds made a fortune with these goofy ""chase"" movies (this and Smoky and The Bandit plus all the sequels). They featured an irreverent, comic '70s attitude toward about anything decent  and were successful. They worked because they were fast-moving generally fun movies to watch.....certainly not any great works of art.

Cannonball Run had an all-star cast of Reynolds, his good buddy Dom DeLuise, Farah Fawcettt, Jack Elan, Roger Moore, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Farr, Jackie Chan, on and on....pretty amazing.

Reynolds, of course, was Mr. Cool/Mr. Macho. Fawcett and Barbeau meant beauty and boobs whom all men - especially dimwitted cops which Hollywood loved to feature - drooled over. The Japanese were made to look stupid (this was pre-PC days) as were priests (nothing's changed there with filmmakers). The movie is filled with really profound statements such as, ""Why do we take all these risks? Oh, just for the hell of it.""

Yes, words to live by.

Yet, as dumb as this movie can be at times, is does provide a lot of good humor and speaking of that, DeLuise's laugh always made everyone do the same.

850593,5,6304316267,"This picture opened in theaters every in the country on June 19 1981 starring Burt Reynolds as JJ McClure, Dom Deluise as Victor Prinizim, Farrah Fawcett as Pamela Glover, Dean martin as Jamie Blake, Sammy Davis Jr. as Morris Fenderbaum, Jack Elam played the doctor, The Gorgeous Adrienne Barbeau as Marcie Thatcher, Lamborghini Babe #1 The Lovely Tara Buckman as Jill Rivers, Lamborghini Babe #2, along with Terry Bradshaw, Mel Tills, and Jamie Farr as the Sheik. This movie was about a bunch of people who wanted to race in the Cannonball Run a Race that went from New York to California and the first one to stamp there card wins the prize. Let's start with the drivers as they arrived at the hotel where the Cannonball Race will stat. There's Marcie Thatcher and Jill Rivers riding around the highways going 220 MPH and spraying traffic and speed limit signs. Then you got JJ McClure and Victor who are also in this race. Victor and JJ are trying to figure out what kind of vehicle they need to win this race. So JJ can think first they go riding in an airplane, landing the in the middle of town in order to get beer. Next they go boat riding, only to crash and both JJ and Victor and up in an ambulance. JJ asks the doctor how far away is the hospital and he was told about 15 miles. But they were also told it would only take 5 minutes because with an ambulance you can go in and out of traffic with no one bothering to stop you. So they look at each other and laugh as they continue to fly through traffic. Next you got Jamie Blake and Morris Fendebaum who are dress like priest but they sure don't act like one. So everyone one is at the hotel having a party the night before the race starts. That's when JJ discovers Pamela Glover a very young and beautiful girl who happens to like trees. As JJ is trying to talk to Pamela he is interrupted by Victor who wants to talk about the doctor.
JJ tells Victor that they need a doctor to ride in the ambulance so right before the race starts Victor finds Doctor Nikolas Van Helsing but JJ doesn't want to know where in found this doctor. So while the race has started, and JJ realizes that that they don't have a patient for in back of the ambulance. So as there going down the road they come upon and accident where Pamela Glover is standing when JJ and Victor pull up. Pamela ask if they will help the young man and so JJ opens the door, get Pamela Glover inside and Victor takes of leaving the man behind. As there going down the highway a New Jersey State Trooper has his lights on stopping the ambulance. Inside the doctor has given Pamela laughing gas to make it look like she really sick. The girls had a few tricks of the own. You see they would go down the states highways like a bat out of hell only to get pulled over by State Troopers. They were both wearing one piece suits so they open up the zipper show a little and the State Troopers would let them go every time. Who wins this race? Where does Captain Chaos come into play? How many of them get caught and don't finish the race?  Here are some thoughts of my own on this movie. I thought the plot and the comedy of this movie was great from beginning to end. However, I bought this movie because of Adrienne Barbeau and Tara Buckman and I sure once disappointed. They walked around in those tight spandex and they were looking real good. Based on that and the great comedy I have no problem giving this movie 10 weasel stars.",1233446400,2,3446,4.285276073619632

A lot of things could've been forgiven about THE CANNONBALL RUN if the movie had only been funny.  But it's not.  It's just an astounding waste of talent that ends with the amusing outtakes proving that the people who made the movie had a better time than the people who paid to see the movie.

A good friend of mine despised this movie because he said, ""It's like watching a party I didn't get invited to.""  He took it a little too personally but you get the idea.

The shame is that I really love so many people in this: Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise look like they're having a blast, Farrah Fawcett, Addrienne Barbeau and much-too-brief Valerie Perrine never looked hotter, Roger Moore was spoofing 007 during the peak of his tenure as James Bond, and how cool to watch Rat Packers Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. clowning as leering priests...if only the script could've risen to such a cast.

You could tell that the actors were just having a good time and it helps to make the film that fun to watch.  As such, the performances aren't that bad.  For example, try to watch Jack Elam in this and picture him in all of those serious, nasty villian roles he had in westerns.  Sammy Davis and Dean Martin working together is almost worth the price alone.  Their great chemistry is apparent.  Frank Sinatra wanted to be in the sequel after seeing them in this.  Roger Moore may have only been doing a parody of himself, but I have always wanted to see him do more comedy.  He was known for helping to maintain a light-hearted atmosphere during the long filming of the Bond pictures.  Also, this is the only one of Jackie Chan's (who actually does race cars) early Hollywood films that shows his talent for mixing martial arts and comedy.  Who cares if he doesn't look japanese (which his character is supposed to be).  Hollywood wouldn't realize what they had been missing until the success of Rush Hour.  Hal Needam (Smokey and the Bandit) was just making a film to entertain, not educate or win oscars.  And, it worked.  Fast cars, laughs and great looking ladies (Adrienne Barbeau, yow!).  I have grown tired of critics reviewing all films under the same guidelines instead of for what they are.

From phony car chase scenes where the action is sped up and quick turns are made over the top of 50 pre-existing sets of black rubber on the highway to the ridiculous improv mugging of Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise who seem to think that because they make each other laugh that they are actually funny this movie seems to say ""You are stupid enough to have paid to see this crapball that we are going to refuse to put any effort into entertaining you."" If your idea of humor is DeLuise morphing into a fat superhero cleverly referred to as Captain Chaos, or Him and characters who not only drive drunk but actually flaunt their cocktails/beer when pulled over by police then you will pee your pants with glee when watching this movie. It's difficult to determine who phones in the worst acting performance in Cannonball Run: Farrah Fawcett who seems to be under the influence of bus fumes throughout; Burt Reynolds whose lack of self-awareness is almost frightening; Dom DeLuise who apparently didn't realize the camera was rolling in his scenes; Dean Martin/Sammy Davis Jr. who pass off their drunken rat pack stage antics as acting or Adrienne Barbeau who flashes her prodigious bosoms to every cracker state trooper in the country. It's difficult to decide what element of crapness is the most frustrating: The fact that no matter where in the country the action is supposed to be taking place it looks like Barstow; the car chase that conveniently supplies a ramp to jump the train (which conveniently has a long row of flatbed cars just as the truck approaches the ramp) or the seemingly endless number of scenes where one of the ""racers"" has been pulled over by the (usually dimwitted and incompetent) local authorities. Like ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"", Cannonball Run has that slapped together in 4 days of shooting feel. As though Hal Needham was oblivious to what was happening and just shouting ""Print it."" My favorite example is the scene where Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise land a plane in a small town's downtown area. Barricades and crowds just happen to already exist as the plane lands. When the plane takes off check out the left side of the shot as a cameraman is obviously apparent standing on a stairway. To sum up, this movie really irks me with its complete lack of regard to everything moviemaking stands for. And writer Brock Yates has tried to divorce himself from this movie claiming that it was taken in a different direction than he has intended. C'mon Brock, the scenes where you appear at the beginning of the race would seem to indicate you were ""acting"" of your own accord (no pun intended.)

This whacky car race accross the states, involves some of the best stunts caught on film! Hal Needham sure knew what he was doing when he put this classic together!

Oh, I almost forgot, Dom Deluise as Captain Chaos is both off the wall, but yet funny.
I only wish there would've been more detail in some areas like with Bond picking up the girls, more time on that red Ferrari, showing that big, muscular guy who was holding up a van showing more feats of strength, some more of that Shiek in the white Rolls Royce seducing women and to show who be more successful, Bond or the Shiek, and finally I guess, with just all the different characters, it just would've been nice if the movie would've been a tad longer, maybe as long as the Godfather. If this movie were extended and in more detail like the Godfather 1 or 2, then this movie in my opinion, would be just as good as the Godfather 2, if not better!

Some of these standout entertainers featured in ""The Cannonball Run"" include the likes of Dean Martin and fellow ""Rat Packer"" Sammy Davis, Jr. as well. Jack Elam, Mel Tillis, Terry Bradshaw, Dom DeLuise, Burt Reynolds and even a young, up-and-coming Jackie Chan also come along for the ride in this free-for-all run for some big bucks (and not to mention some FAST women!!!). The race is on from New Jersey to California, as everyone is out to claim the big prize, no matter what the cost. The closing moments, as well as the bloopers featured in the final credits, make ""The Cannonball Run"" well worth the purchase. So, race on down to your local retailer, and order this souped up vehicle today, or you'll be left at the finish line (in last place, with nothing to show for it, of course)!",1017360000,,1539,4.9689922480620154
850748,4,6304316267,"Cannonball Run is a guilty pleasure.  No one would ever say it's a good movie, but it's a like train wreck, you find yourself staring.  Burt Reynolds tries to live his glory days of Smokey and The Bandit, bringing along the same Director, Hal Needham as well as a slew of falling stars to prop him up.  Its as if all of them knew their careers were sliding and it was one last ditch effort to make a great noise.  Don't get me wrong, many of these people are talented.  Lets explain the premise first.  The 'Run' is an auto street (or highway) race, based closely on a real race that was run throughout the 70s that went from New York to California.  It was highly illegal, and probably a lot a fun.  There is even an appearance by one of the original drivers, Brock Yates, who is now an editor for Car & Driver Magazine and makes an amusing appearance as the MC, explaining how the race goes.  Reynolds is JJ McClure, a former race car driver and mechanic who is the standing champ in the race.  Eager to keep his title, he is desperate to win again.  In this race though, that doesn't just mean going fast, anyone can go fast, but sooner or later, you will get stopped.  JJ and his strange friend, Victor (Dom Delouse) adopt a personality of two paramedics driving a patient cross country.  Apparently this worked in the actual race one year.  The supporting cast of competition includes Jamie Farr as an overzealous Sheik in a hopped up Rolls Royce, Roger Moore playing a comic version of his James Bond character driving his popular silver Austin Martin, Mel Tillus and Terry Bradshaw playing a couple of southern boys cruising in a stolen race car and my personal favorite, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. playing womanizing, gambling hard drinking priests driving a red Ferrari (they aren't really priests).  All this adds up to a movie where every scene you see a star.  Dean and Sammy steal the show in almost every scene they're in, they are class acts adding something unattainable in most pictures of this caliber.  The racing antics are not quite as funny as the beginning scenes where all the characters are introduced, but it is entertaining.  The best part of the movie comes at the end though where the bloopers are shown during the closing credits.  It's worth the price of the DVD alone.  Don't expect a great movie out of Cannonball Run, all you can really expect is a good time, but isn't that what it's all about?",1010707200,77,2434,4.501138952164009

First watching this movie, you know your in for a treat as almost every actor and actress of the all-star acting cast allowed themselves to conduct parodies of their best movie roles. Burt Reynolds played a character very similar to has acclaimed role in Smokey and the Bandit. Roger Moore, best known for being 007 and The Saint, used his debonair qualities to create a hillarious series of self-humilating scenes having fun with the staples of his career.
Although other great talents have also thrown themselves behind The Cannonball Run. Farrah Fawcett, a drop-dead funny two-thirds of the ""Rat Pack"" with Sammy Davis Jr. and Dean Martin as well as a younger Jackie Chan driving a Japan entry to the race.

850844,5,6304316267,"A zany cross country race based on an
actual event called ""The Cannonball
Sea-to-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash."" The brainchild of writer Brock
Yates, who competed in the first Cannonball in 1971. The object is to
drive as fast and as safely as possible from Connecticut to Redondo Beach, California.
In every Cannonball, no driver or person has ever been injured.
The worst case, a team or two put behind
bars for no more than an hour.
""The Cannonball Run"" is based on real
characters and adventures. It was penned
by Yates,  who makes an appearance in the early stages of the movie as the ""organizer.""

Burt Reynolds headlines an all star lineup as ""J.J. McClure"" a wealthy
entrepreneur who, along with his
'executive assistant' Victor Prinze,
played with great verve by comedian
Dom DeLuise. Victor has some issues.
In times of 'mortal danger' his personality changes from mild mannered
mechanic, into an alter-ego called
""Captain Chaos"" who wreaks havoc on
some less than respectable hombres we encounter along the way.
Farrah Fawcett is teamed with J.J. and Victor when she's kidnapped in their ambulance.
Jack Elam as ""Doctor Nikolas Van Helsing"" provides lots of laughs
and few chills when needed.

Veteran performers Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. join the ensemble as
a pair of priests in a souped-up Ferrari.

Roger Moore makes a departure from his
'James Bond' character playing ""Seymor Goldfarb."" An individual who believes he's
Roger Moore. It's a great spoof and Moore plays it with perfection.

Mel Tillis and former quarterback
Terry Bradshaw show up as just a
couple of good ol' boys ala ""Dukes
of Hazzard"" style, toting cases of beer but sans the ""General Lee.""

Tara Buckman and Adrienne Barbeau are seen throughout the film in their
custom black Lamborghini Countach,
breaking speed limits and the hearts
of some unsuspecting law enforcement
officers along the route.

Jamie Farr from ""MASH"" is cast in the role of a Sheik obsessed with winning the Cannonball
in a hot-rod Rolls Royce.

The Cannonball Run was directed by
Hal Needham who brought us ""Smokey and
the Bandit"" and ""Hooper."" Hal and Brock
were partners in a Cannonball held in the late 70S.  Needham sets a flat out,
pedal to the metal pace for ""Cannonball"" and it doesn't let
up till the finish line.

One big mistake, this movie could have used a lot more Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr.
They have the funniest lines in the movie along with the always great Jack Elam.
The voice-over commentary track was fun too, a couple of old-school movie guys talking  about ""makin' pictures"".

About as good as you can expect from this era. And after all these years Cannonball Run is still very funny. I forgot Jackie Chan was even in the movie, so that was a pleasant surprise. Burt Reynolds and Dom Deluise play well off each other, as do Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. It was fun to watch Roger Moore spoof his James Bond persona, which almost got him and this film in hot water. Listen to the commentary track to find out more. I like this movie enough that I wanted to buy Cannonball Run II, Smokey and the Bandit or even Hooper.

850899,5,6304316267,"Citizen Kane, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Annie Hall, Convoy, these film's names are often bandied about whenever a serious discussion of the greatest American films ensues. However there is one that stands, head and shoulders, above the rest. Literally dwarfing the competition. The Cannonball Run is that behemoth. Never before had such an amazing array of talent been assembled for one film. We are treated to the combined acting prowess of Roger Moore, Farrah Fawcett, Dom DeLuise, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Terry Bradshaw, Jackie Chan, Bert Convy, Jamie Farr (as the sheik!), Peter Fonda, Bianca Jagger, Jimmy The Greek, Mel Tilis, and the one, the only Mr. Burt Reynolds as the indomitable J.J. McClure. This film tells the story of an illegal, cross-country car race that attracts an assortment of eccentric entrants (above listed actors) who will stop at nothing to win. Ultimately however, it is a tale of the triumph of the human spirit over insurmountable odds, the EPA (in the form of Arthur J. Foyt) and the Police. Not mention being one hell of a vehicle for Burt Reynolds' ego, as most of his pictures were. We get to see him degrade Dom DeLuise thoroughly, not only during the movie, but also during the credits as they roll outtakes of Burt literally beating the hell out of the lovable oaf he used as his sidekick for so many years. This movie reflects a time and an innocence long gone in America. Filmed in 1981 it is still very much of the free-spirited, sex and drug fueled 70s that had yet to dissipate during the Reagan ""Just Say No"" 80s. Most obviously evidenced by the passionate way these drivers embraced Recreational Drunk Driving (most noticeably the two duos of Dean and Sammy and Bradshaw - Tilis), it is a quality I find sorely lacking in today's Cinema. The film was made before the term Politically Correct had been coined. It treats Authority, Women and Minorities with equal disrespect. In fact it seems to revel in irreverence, and cheap stereotypes abound. We've got the Jamie Farr Sheik, The Tilis/Bradshaw Rednecks, Rick Aviles as Mad Dog; The Cannonball Run did not hesitate to offend anyone. The only rule it seems the producers laid down was that they couldn't make Burt look bad. So long as it served Reynolds' ego, go for it. And go for it they did.

Rumor even has it guys like A.J. Foyt, Mario Andretti, etc. drove the race as well. Just seeing the movie makes me want to hop into a fast car and fly down the interstate at 100-plus MPH.
