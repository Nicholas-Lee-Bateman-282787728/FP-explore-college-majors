8614050,5,B00FBKSFVU,"This series is a complete joy to watch.  You will learn from it.  You will attach yourself to the characters.  You will hardly be able to wait for the next episode when one is ended.  You will experience history, beauty, culture, good overcoming evil and  love and perseverance overcoming seemingly constant obstacles.  The medical scenes and introduction to old time veterinary and human medical practices, herbal treatments, acupuncture and surgery are fascinating.  The actors are fabulous.  I love Korean historical dramas and this was one of my all time favorites.  You won't be disappointed!",1410825600,10,597,5.26595744680851
