4992907,5,B006JAAKGY,"The greatest trapshooter to ever live. Big Leo aka the gentile giant tells all in an easy understandable format. I've personally won a championship at the grand American after watching this video. 2 years in a row! Unfortunately Leo passed at a young age but you can get lots from his videos. Anything I couldn't understand I called his wife Karla and she helped me understand.

4992913,5,B006JAAKGY,"Great DVD! Leo Harrison has a logical approach to trap shooting, mixed with humility and ""down home"" humor.

I have been an avid pistol and rifle shooter, but I had never shot a shotgun, let alone trap. After studying this DVD several times and then shooting 50 straight away birds to get the feel of the shotgun, I shot rounds of 19, 16, 17, and 20! I am elated!",1346716800,3,363,4.260869565217392

8499297,5,B006JAAKGY,The DVD is very helpful and is easy to follow.  Great price on a great DVD!  Leo Harrison definitely knows what he is talking about!,1441411200,,132,4.24
8499298,5,B006JAAKGY,"Leo's video takes painstaking efforts to 'show' what he is talking about.
I have been seriously shooting trap for awhile now and read and listen to almost everything that I find.
I've come to the realization that once you know the correct basics of trap shooting, good basics are good basics.
I will say this, I wished I started with this video from day one. It would have saved years of trial and error.
If you are just starting out in the sport of trap shooting, watch and listen to this video over and over until you thoroughly understand exactly what he is doing and talking about.
The one area of technology that I wish could be improved is the shooters view of the shot. the camera is never where the shooter is looking. The camera is either too high or low.
It's a lot to ask because when you put the camera in the direct sight(s) path, you are blocking the view of the shooter.
Anyway, I have a new found respect for Leo Harrison. You'll see why.",1439596800,,954,4.335195530726257
8499299,5,B006JAAKGY,"Though I am a long time shooter, I am new to Trap Shooting; just two months.  And although the old boys at my shooting club mean well, their advice and ""coaching"" is mostly worth what it costs ... Nothing.  Experience has taught me that I really do need to do a lot of research and seek out the most accomplished and experienced teachers in order to learn solid basics, know what and how to practice, and understand the mechanics and principles of any sport or artistic pursuit.  This DVD by the late Leo Harrison is all of the above.  I learned more from the this DVD and the Harlan Campbell Jr. DVD than all the ""advice"" I been given so far.  While not as athletically challenging as the other shotgun sports, Trap does demand a solidity, steadiness, and consistency all it's own.  Like they say, 2/3 of all the blocks in the Grest Pyramid are the lower half of the structure.  Foundation is the key.  Good foundation is a must.  Leo offers this.  He is highly accomplished, his wealth of knowledge is presented in an organized and comprehensive way, and he is comfortable in front of camera, so he's easy to listen to.  The over the shoulder and eye cam shots are the highlights of the DVD.  we get to see what Leo sees.  And ""seeing"" is everything in Trap Shooting.  I jokingly tell my shooting buddies that this DVD is not a ""loaner"".  They're welcome to bring some good BBQ and beer to my house to watch it, because it ain't leavin' the premises.  As my scores are now consistently in the low 20's after just two months in, they're beginning to get interested in my approach.  Leo's DVD is a big part of it.  I recommend it without qualification or hesitation.",1432771200,3,1666,4.442244224422442
