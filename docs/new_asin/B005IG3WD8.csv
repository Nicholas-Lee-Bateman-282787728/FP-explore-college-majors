8474609,4,B005IG3WD8,"Tara VanDerveer is one of the most respected coaches in womens basketball.  This is the biggest reason I chose this DVD. Her discussions of basketball philosophies, practice breakdowns, and strategies are excellent.

This is the 3rd All-Access DVD that I have purchased...Geno Auriemma and Sheri Cole is the other.  Both of them are excellent.  As a high school coach, the application for me is the number of drills, offensive/defensive sets, and other activities that are shown.

I would prefer less staff meetings and roundtable discussions...they are all excellent but for a high school coach who doesn't have the same resources and/or coaching staff; this area of focus is far removed from our ""world"" of high school basketball!

Other than that, I would recommend this DVD simply because it is ""Stanford Basketball!""

Nice Job Coach VanDerveer!",1349222400,2,849,5.2444444444444445
