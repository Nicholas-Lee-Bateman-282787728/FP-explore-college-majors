8507960,5,B00710VA24,"Miriam's 'Let's Do Yoga!' dvd is adorable to look at since it is so '80's... but her system is timeless.  She addresses every single muscle and joint within 90 minutes and leaves you with a deep relaxation and healing meditation that is nothing short of transformational.  Yoga is, after all, a 5000 year old system.  Miriam makes it easily accessible.  This is one of my all-time favorite yoga dvd's.",1458172800,,401,4.768115942028985

Now that this DVD is available, others can experience her mastery.  Buy this one and any that she offers for sale. She is beyond a teacher, and the DVD is beyond whatever else is on the market. This is a must for anyone interested in yoga.
Miriam teaches yoga in a very special way, she is a rare gem that stands out.

8507963,5,B00710VA24,"I've used this yoga routine for many years and was so grateful to find it available on DVD.  Many other yoga tapes seem to just get you warmed up and then it's over. This one warms you up and progressively works out each area of the body. The instruction is simple and clear enough for a novice to safely experience the benefits of a deep yoga practice. I especially get a lot of relief from tense shoulders with this routine.  The entire practice (including meditation) takes about 90 minutes and it is so worth it. However it's possible to just do a part and pick up the rest later. I've never found another yoga sequence, live or taped, that leaves me feeling so at peace, so complete. The meditation at the end is truly a blessing.",1339286400,2,735,4.397058823529412
