7826442,4,6302480744,"This show has me conflicted.  On the one hand it is an excellent edu-tainer for children.  On the other hand the closing ""song that never ends"" leaves two possibilities:
In one aspect it teaches children the nature of misrepresentation, in that while the ""song that never ends"" continues (presumably) beyond the end of the programme it must end at some point afterward as the subsequent episodes are not simply the characters singing non-stop beginning to end ad infinitum.  As such they must have stopped somewhere betwixt episodes.  This teaches children the cold reality that nothing lasts forever and that things are not always what they are marketed to be.  While useful lessons, a little macabre for children I should think.
The other possibility is that each episode takes place in an alternate reality in which the song was not begun at the end of the previous episode.  While this is an intriguing prospect it does draw continuity among episodes into question.  Furthermore, it may leave children with an overwhelming sense of nihilism when faced with the prospect that there may be an infinite number of themselves somewhere out there, combined with the worrying thought that many of those ""alternate selves"" are locked perpetually in song.
In either case deep metaphysical consequences are presented by plush puppets instead of trained academic instructors.  That being said, the lack of philosophical credentials may be overlooked for the adorable and affable friends the series provides.",1318032000,,1500,5.195020746887967
