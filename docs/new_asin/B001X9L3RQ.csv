3827202,5,B001X9L3RQ,"I am a Tahiti fanatic and this was filmed on location in the early 60's before the airport was built and the tourists invaded so I'm biased, what can I say. It also has James Mason, Halley Mills' father, Herbert Lom of Pink Panther fame  and Rosenda Monteros. You've probably never heard of Rosenda but she's a delightful Mexican actress who was also in the film ""She"" with Ursula Andress.",1395964800,2,389,4.557142857142857
3827203,5,B001X9L3RQ,"Many people don't realize the talent Mason had for light comedy, and this movie is one of his more comedic roles. The story is funny, the cast is excellent (Sir John Mills, Herbert Lom) and the scenery is beautiful. This is a sweet light comedy that is perfect for a day when you want to watch a light comedy. If you are a James Mason fan, this is a must-see. He is charming, handsome and at his comedic best. The smile you see on his face on the cover of the DVD tells it all; this movie is very sweet and I recommend it for those who enjoy light comedy and I highly recommend it for any James Mason fans. It's always nice to see him play something like this, that deviates from his more serious roles and shows his delightful sense of humor. You'll love it!",1365379200,,759,4.170068027210885
3827204,5,B001X9L3RQ,"I am a fan of James Mason, and I was very happy to see him in two comedies, one of them being ""Tiara Tahiti"". He is usually thought of as a very serious actor, but he can pull off light comedy with a flare and his usual charisma. The story is cute, as Mason spars with John Mills throughout. It's light and fluffy; this is no serious drama, it is a romantic comedy, and if you enjoy such fare, I highly recommend this movie. If you are fan of James Mason, this is a must-have for your collection. Enjoy!",1364601600,,503,4.090909090909091
3827205,3,B001X9L3RQ,Don't buy this movie for the nudity which is brief. The movie's story line is good and the acting is also good. I like movies that leave you feeling vindicated...the kind of movie where the victim finds justice. If you're a James Mason fan you'll like this one. It's not one of his finest but it is fun to watch and I think most will enjoy it.,1355184000,,343,4.134328358208955
3827206,5,B001X9L3RQ,"Interesting little movie has the feel of Donovan's Reef. Just put it on and enjoy the witty exchanges of Mills and Mason. Herbert Lom plays an Asian shop keeper. The love interest for Mason is the woman who was Horst Buchholtz's love interest in The Magnificent Seven. I think her name is Roseana Moreles or something like that. She's like a brown skinned Audrey Hepburn. Lovely actress. The quality of the film overall is very good and the colors are nice, but some scenes shot at dusk or in the evening with only moonlight are almost impossible to make out. They are just dark silhouettes. The director should have put some light on his subjects. Otherwise highly recommended film of this period.",1311465600,9,698,4.729508196721311
3827207,4,B001X9L3RQ,"VCI Entertainment and Ivan Foxwell Productions presents ""TIARA TAHITI"" (1962) (101 min/Color) -- Starring James Mason, John Mills, Claude Dauphin, Herbert Lom & Rosenda Monteros

Directed by Ted Kotcheff

Another great film from the British Invasion via VCI.

Two old pro's James Mason and John Mills, doing what they do best, just masterful high class acting.

Mason was the perfect choice to play Aimsley, the charming, likable scoundrel. Oddly enought we remain on his side throughout the film because his charm that eventually wins us over.

Mills' performance as  Lt. Col. Clifford Southey is quite hilarious. Creating one of those absurd characters that needs only to walk into a room for one to start laughing.

Check out the scenes which involve Mills who is alone apart from us, rehearsing how he is going to confront Mason. Despite his basically good moral character, he's one of those characters we love to hate because of his pomposity and his many unreasonable assumptions about Mason.

3827208,4,B001X9L3RQ,"Ted Kotcheff must have had more of his movies go walkabout than any other significant director. Both this and his Australian masterpiece, Wake in Fright (sometimes called Outback in the U.S.) were rescued (via single prints) from the edge of oblivion. Unfortunately, this one survived in 16 mm, and, though decently restored, has limited visual quality as a result. Still, the performances, especially of James Mason, are delightful, and lovers of Pacifica will be enchanted to see the post-WWII Tahiti, before the tourist industry really struck (and its striking is one of the film's plot points). There is brief nudity, not found in American studio movies of that vintage, and Herbert Lom's character is more than a little culturally insensitive. The German subtitles are optional, of course, so the only barrier is the region code. Since there are scads of great movies unavailable in region 1, but common elsewhere, anyone without a region-free player might want to check out Oppo's region-free Blu-ray players, which also play just about any disc you're likely to own, including SACD and DVD-audio. Region coding is obnoxious and insulting, and I bless the Chinese for stabbing it in the neck.
  Wake in Fright has also been restored and is finally available, in Australia's region 4 code. A big reason to thank Oppo.",1285200000,17,1322,5.087557603686636

8347589,3,B001X9L3RQ,"Comedic premise, but a bit short on actual yuks. Good acting though, and good eye candy. Worth a watch.",1429401600,4,103,4.473684210526316
8347590,2,B001X9L3RQ,"I wanted to give this movie 2.5 stars, and maybe another whole star for the backdrop.  But the thing that really torpedoes it for me is that I simply don't get this film.  That, and it's not funny, even though it's supposed to be comedy; i.e. make you laugh or present something that's humorous or worthy of laughter.

What we have here is the story of a con artist and card shark who is a former captain in the wartime British Army.  There's a plot about his migrating to and making a living in the islands via his skill, and a plot regarding a murder, but nothing much beyond that.

No jokes.  No gags.  Lots of upbeat attitudes, a Tahitian hottie who poses nude for the camera in a few select scenes, and not much more.  There's an implied card shark relationship between Mason's character and his former employer who rose in the military ranks (possibly shaking him down for lots of money).  Then there's a couple of Canadian ladies for no reason whatsoever.

No, I take it back, this film deserves two stars for being aimless and pointless.  The only thing that keeps me from giving it one star is the fact that it looks okay.

p.s. I can only guess that this is a film based on a real life criminal, possibly someone who's pathological, and uses deceit to get ahead in life.  A film was made regarding various happenings around his life, and possibly to see if anyone identified with him or his circumstances; i.e. another criminal investigative film, billed as a comedy for some idiotic reason.",1421366400,,1501,4.514814814814815
