8197015,5,B000QRIKAE,"This is the best World War II official documentary ever made. The footage is all genuine and varies in quality, although most of it is excellent. The narrative is powerful and at times even moving. And the message, that it took all the United Nations to defeat Nazi Germany, is tremendously important. ""The True Glory"" is considered one of the best World War II films and the model for such films as ""Saving Private Ryan"".",1379548800,4,422,4.64
8197016,2,B000QRIKAE,Historically interesting but underwhelming. Narratives seem disjointed and the clips not very enthralling. Not the best but certainly not the worst.,1378857600,,148,6.095238095238095
8197017,5,B000QRIKAE,"If you were wanting something like ""Saving Private Ryan,"" this isn't it.  If you were hoping for widescreen and Technicolor, this isn't it.  If you were looking for dramatic special effects, this isn't it either.  The film is grainy and dirty, the sound is bad, and Ike's introduction is out of sync.  But if you don't watch it, you'll miss a chance to see real war, real soldiers, real death, as narrated by the men who were there, and filmed by equally courageous photographers.  You'll miss the elation of liberated civilians, the sneers and grins of nazi prisoners.  Now, almost 70 years later, it's still hard to believe.",1348790400,15,626,4.75
