6898742,5,B00R4JLJ4G,I did the lower and upper body workouts the day I received it (release date) and I have to say this is one of my favorite Jillian dvd's. The workouts are solid and challenging. Unfortunately I had to follow the modifier for most of it since I am 36 weeks pregnant but I can't wait to get back to doing the hardcore versions and get back in shape quickly.,1425427200,,354,4.144927536231884
6898743,5,B00R4JLJ4G,"Got this dvd last night since I pre-ordered it and have amazon prime.
This dvd comes with 3 workouts-Core, Upper Body and Lower Body. She suggests doing 1 workout 2x per week. For example, Core workout on Monday and Thursday. Upper Body on Tuesday and Friday. and Lower Body on Wednesday and Saturday. (Or whatever 2 days you want.)
My first impression of the video was that my eyes needed to adjust because the filming seemed ""jerky"" or something. Not a deal breaker-just seemed weird and I thought I would mention it.
I did UPPER BODY this morning which was 33 minutes-it included a warm up and cool down.
Jillian was with 2 other girls in this workout. One girl was showing advanced moves and the other one showing less intense moves. I am not going to say beginner moves, because this workout is NOT FOR BEGINNERS! I would consider myself intermediate and it was fun but challenging for me.
Upper Body has 4 circuits total. You repeat the moves 2 times, then do a 1 min cardio HIIT, then move on to the next circuit.
You will need a set of hand weights, maybe 2 sets-heavy and light.
This dvd is challenging but doable-like I said its not for beginners. I need a one arm burpee!!
I really like that the last 2 workout dvds (this one and Beginner Shred) have been ""family friendly"". Meaning she isn't screaming at you or cussing so I can do her workouts with my family around. She is still very motivating and encouraging-I can tell she loves what she's doing!
I can't wait to do the other 2 workouts on this dvd. You won't be disappointed in this workout!

Edited to add:
I just finished the Lower Body and wow it was great and sweaty! That workout was not ""jerky"" recording like I posted the Upper body workout video was. Another awesome workout. Was about 35 mins with warm up and cool down included.",1425427200,29,1806,4.45619335347432
6898744,4,B00R4JLJ4G,"I can only speak to the Lower Body workout.  I did it last night and it was ROUGH.  I really liked it, however some of the moves were difficult to follow along.  I think after I do it a few more times it will be easier.  I'm not sure I will ever get beyond the modified moves though.  I was hot, sweaty, tired and sore afterwards.  I have about 8-10 of Jillian's workouts and this one is definitely a whole new animal.  I think I'm going to like it though.  My favorite is still No More Trouble Zones :)",1425427200,12,503,4.01010101010101
6898745,4,B00R4JLJ4G,"Received this DVD on its release date 3/3/15.  The video has 3 - 30 minute workouts.  Abs/Core, Upper body, & Lower body.  As usual she has 1 person doing the ""hardcore"" version and 1 person doing the ""beginner"" version of each move.  The format is a warm up, 4 circuits, and a cool down.  Each circuit has 3 or 4 strength moves you repeat for 30 seconds each and then 1 one-minute cardio move.
I did the Core and Upper body workouts the first night I got the DVD.  Total time was just under an hour.  It was definitely challenging - and included some new moves I've not yet seen in Jillian's DVD's (I've got at least 10 of Jillian's DVD's).  Jillian was very upbeat and energetic (especially in the Upper Body workout - she seemed to be having a really good time).
I have not yet done the Lower Body yet -- but I wanted to post my initial impression - as I didn't see any reviews yet that actually spoke to the content of the video itself.
The only negative I have to report is that it seems the production is a little weird.  The camera felt ""jerky""?  Will be interested to see if others notice this or if maybe I was just hallucinating from working so hard ;)
I will put this DVD in my rotation, as I did enjoy it.  I don't think I'll ever pick just 1 to use exclusively.  I really like rotating through the different DVD's she offers.",1425427200,52,1338,4.203921568627451
6898746,1,B00R4JLJ4G,So I did receive my dvd and like all the others the quality did seem that great. It seemed jerky and slow. The quality is not that great as her other ones. Jillian what's up with this?!! I have all her DVDs and let me tell you this could be one of my favs expect for the quality.,1425254400,39,279,3.8275862068965516
6898747,4,B00R4JLJ4G,"Every year or two, I am always looking to up my game or find a creative way to cross train other muscle groups.  This one has a number of good core moves.  Not much cardio like her set of 12 workouts and music is not as motivating, but pretty good 25 minute kettlebell workout (total 28 minutes).  I have yet to venture into Level 2.  Jillian is such a bad a**",1424044800,8,360,4.028169014084507
6898748,5,B00R4JLJ4G,She will kill you but the results are excellent just be patient,1520726400,5,63,4.333333333333333
6898749,5,B00R4JLJ4G,"I've been doing Ripped in 30 off and on for years and I think this is a great dvd to use when you've grown tired of RI30. I have noticed a big improvement in my endurance, I have actual arm and leg muscles, my tummy has gotten flatter. My results would have been even better if I were stricter on my diet so keep that in mind when you start! Lots of great modifications if you can't handle some of the moves, I still modify on pushups, its totally okay! Ps Jillian is much ""nicer"" in this dvd if you do not enjoy getting yelled at!",1519084800,,531,4.018867924528302

6898751,5,B00R4JLJ4G,"I love all of Jillian's workout DVDs.  These are a great addition to my collection.  A little more challenging, which is great.  I would rate these as immediate.",1515715200,,161,4.678571428571429
6898752,1,B00R4JLJ4G,"First,  let me say that I LOVE Jillian and own many of her DVDs. This one,  by comparison,  is terrible!  The visual quality is so bad that it's sometimes difficult to see the moves. It's like watching The Blair witch project! 2 of the workouts hiccup,  which is annoying.  It's like nobody rehearsed.  The two women in the background are often out of sync. Jillian's verbal instruction,  which is usually superb, is terrible!  For example,  she'll say to open your feet hip width apart and then does something totally different.  If she says to do one more rep, you may end up doing 1 rep, or 4, or 8. Some of the one minute cardio intervals are only 20 seconds long...what's the point?  Some of the background people exhibit terrible form! The actual workouts don't seem well planned.  You'll be using lots of upper body weights in the lower body workout, for example.  The whole thing felt like it was slapped together in an afternoon.  The stretches are a joke, too. It does no good to hold a stretch for 2 seconds.  I expected so much more from Jillian!",1515283200,,1058,4.518518518518518
6898753,5,B00R4JLJ4G,"I have been doing JM workouts 4-6 days a week for over a year now. This DVD lives up to its name. It was a killer and each body section worked was sore for two days after. I was shying away from buying this one because I felt there was not enough cardio to get a good overall workout. There are some seriously challenging minute long cardio intervals in this, so don't you worry, you'll get that heart rate up. Awesome physical challenges in this one! Give it a try!",1515283200,,466,4.188888888888889
6898754,4,B00R4JLJ4G,"These are 3 great workouts targeting upper body, lower body and core separately and each is 30 minutes. Each workout shows the modified version and a badass version as Jillian likes to call it. Overall the workouts are fantastic, although the blond girl in the lower body workout is super annoying. My only real complaint is the absolutely terrible picture quality of the DVD, it's super blurry.",1514851200,,395,4.91044776119403
6898755,5,B00R4JLJ4G,Last years gift.  She loves it.,1513382400,,31,4.166666666666667
6898756,4,B00R4JLJ4G,My second Jillian Michaels DVD as people have mentioned the picture quality is weird eventually you get used to it instruction and workouts are challenging as usual and the loft-like set is cool,1508025600,,194,4.909090909090909
6898757,4,B00R4JLJ4G,Fast moving I feel some of the exercises will be difficult for beginners but it is a good workout,1506384000,,97,4.157894736842105
6898758,5,B00R4JLJ4G,"Great workouts.  Works different muscles than Jillian Michaels ""Ripped in 30""....which I've been doing for years.  These workouts are relatively simple, in that, just as you start thinking you can't do it, she changes it up, making you feel like you're really conquering it!  The best part is that even though you don't feel like your near as worn out as in ""Ripped in 30"" you feel it in your whole body the next day.  It's a good feeling to know you're getting a great workout and really changing your body.",1505433600,,508,4.549450549450549

6898767,3,B00R4JLJ4G,"So I'm a big JM fan. I have most of her DVDs and she helped me lose big after my second child. But at the end of the day I always go back to her 30 Day Shred and Ripped in 30 DVDs. This one was not one of my favorites. I feel like with every DVD she is trying to come up with brand new moves and exercises. I work out a lot, and even I struggle. Some of the moves are just awkward! I spend more time watching and trying to figure out what they are doing than actually exercising. With 30 Day Shred or Ripped in 30 it's more straight forward exercises. If it's too easy you add heavier weights or get more deep in to the move. Too hard? Drop the weights or lighten them. Don't go so deep in the movement. Easy! This DVD is often too complicated and that doesn't make it better, sadly.",1494374400,2,783,3.9
6898768,3,B00R4JLJ4G,"I love jillian Michaels and I own alot of her DVDS. This is a good workout dvd however, the moves are very complicated and have multiple steps. Most of her DVDS are like this but this one is probably the most complex as far as the moves go. I really didn't get a good workout in because I had a hard time following and mastering the moves. You may want to play the dvd and master the moves before you try the whole thing if you want a good workout. I stopped the dvd and put in her ripped in 30 so that I could get a good workout In. I may try it again soon.",1491004800,11,558,3.8189655172413794
6898769,5,B00R4JLJ4G,Wow....one of the hardest workouts I have ever done.  I exercise regularly and consider myself pretty strong. Requires and works on core and body weight strength training.  There is a lower impact version that I had to revert to for some moves.  This hurt my pride but that shows you how hard it is.  I may never be able to do some of her moves like going from a surrender to jumping to both feet. I would do the core and an upper or lower body on the same day and would feel totally wiped.  I needed a break from weight training and monotonous cardio.  Perfect HIIT workout. I have most of her workouts and some have been sub par but this has changed my mind so I have ordered the newest video. They are so affordable.,1489536000,2,719,4.211678832116788
6898770,5,B00R4JLJ4G,I have many jillian michaels workouts and this one and cardio kickstart are my favorite! I'm not sure how anyone doesn't see results from doing jillian michaels!,1489104000,2,161,5.0
6898771,2,B00R4JLJ4G,Too difficult to continue more than a week or two..  My least favorite of her DVDs.,1488844800,,83,4.1875
6898772,5,B00R4JLJ4G,"Awesome video with awesome workouts!  I really like that there are two versions of every exercise going on at the same time so you can choose immediately either the full blown version or the modified version.  That way you can work your way, at your own pace, to the full blown version.",1486684800,2,286,4.480769230769231
6898773,3,B00R4JLJ4G,"I LOVE Jillian Michaels but I feel like these workouts are not all inclusive, they focus on weight training targeted muscle areas and then I usually have to follow up with another cardio circuit of my own. I much prefer her other videos that include weight training, abs, and cardio all in one 30 min cycle.",1486684800,5,307,4.5

6898775,5,B00R4JLJ4G,"This workout is no joke! I did the workouts for a month and everyday it kicked my butt! The DVD has 3 workouts, Lower and Upper Body and Core.
Lower Body really is killer! A LOT of jumping! But there are modifications. Really works your whole leg and glutes
Upper Body incorporates the whole body as well which is good.
Core had quite a few new moves that I have never done which was good.
After the first full 3 days my whole body was sore! Great workouts Jillian!!",1486339200,,466,4.247191011235955

6898777,4,B00R4JLJ4G,I gave this four star probably because of how angry I am at Jillian right now.  NOT because it doesn't work but because of how sore I am!  This obviously does what it is supposed to do but keep in mind if you have any knee or back issues it might not be the video for you.  Overall she did what she promised and as always Amazon shipped within 2 days.....LOVE my AMAZON prime!!!!!,1485302400,,380,4.108108108108108
6898778,5,B00R4JLJ4G,"I received this DVD yesterday, and I did the core workout this morning.  I'm a huge Jillian fan, and I rotate between her 30 day shred and total body dvds 5 days a week.  I can safely say this one will be added to the rotation also.  I've watched the other 2 workouts on this DVD, and I'm sure they'll have me sweating and short of breath just like the core workout.

This DVD is my favorite so far I think. It kicked my ass in a good way! I literally LOL'd several times during the workouts because of her or her back up girls comments. :) I love that she always offers modifications while also encouraging you to try the bad ass version if only for a couple reps. I find her engaging and motivating and as hard as it is in the moment sometimes, I'm always surprised when it's time to be done! This one so far is my fave of all I've tried.

6898797,5,B00R4JLJ4G,"I have only 3 JM DVDs.. 30ds, ripped in 30 and killer body. The progression in difficulty is the order I named them. Killer body is a tough workout. I sweat much more in this workout than the others.

I consider myself intermediate level. I used to exercise daily and ran in high school. Fast forward 10 years and 3 kids later I was out of shape. I was actually on the too thin side and originally picked up 30ds to get have better endurance and strengthen my body and get some ""meat on my bones"". I've been working on her videos since October and I've gained 20 pounds which I'm maintaining, going from an unhealthy bmi of 18 to a healthy 22. I'm much healthier now and look much more fit and in shape. Definitely recommend. No issues with quality other than the girls are less rehearsed in this one so they tend to stop awkwardly and miss steps. But it's all good.

Update in 2018: Ive decided I am done with the shred and ripped in 30 (ri30 was in my opinion her worst dvd) because the expectation of hiit every day for 30 days is way too unrealistic and puts too much stress on the joints. Killer body is great because it cycles through the body focus. Plus she offers a rest day (thanks Jillian!). I also prefer it because Jillian is authentic to herself in this videos. Shes tough without being nuts and shes not hyper sexual or body image focused as she was in some of the other videos.",1466726400,,1393,4.2727272727272725

They're about just as hard as most of her other workouts. She still had her signature sense of humor, even though some think she didn't use as much no-nonsense talk. I thought Golden was really amusing, especially when she kept reaching over to Natalie and she just ignored her, or when she was making ""Oh Jesus"" faces.

She doesn't pause to talk in between workouts ( I want to work out not converse and not have to have the remote in hand to fast forward through speeches and tutorials) , it is continuous and consistent,which is why it is my favorite.  I alternate 3 of her DVDs throughout the week. The 4 stars is because the quality of the DVD is poor, but the more I do it the least it bothers me.",1460678400,3,469,3.9368421052631577

The first time I thought I was doing Upper Body but didn't have on my glasses and ended up doing Killer Abs. And it was just that...killer. I love Jillian's personality. She is motivating, offers discipline, but then is humorous at the same time. She is one of the few fitness instructors I don't find annoying after a while. I also like the modifications because I have several injuries (2 ACL reconstructions that have turned into arthritis and Scheuermann's Disease). I do as Jillian instructs, start with the harder version and do as many as I can, then drop down to the modification.

It feels like a video cassette from the 80's that was played one too many times and is worn out and is now hard if not almost impossible to watch. Shame, because the workout itself seems really good, but it is very hard to follow the pace due to it being greatly hampered/hindered by this random skipping/fast forward movements..disappointed..Looks like a poorly produced home movie from 1980...:-( This was a Christmas present, otherwise I would be returning this myself.

I couldn't even finish the arms workout and I am not weak. the push up move where you walk your hands to the side and do a criss/crossed hand push up is a bit advanced I think.  Also, I have only a set of 10lb weights at home and that is way too heavy for the moves in this video.  So for probably most women, be sure lighter weights are on hand.  I would definitely do this video...after I'm in shape!  Regarding video quality, I saw some other reviews about that and as soon as the picture came on the screen, I immediately noticed that the picture wasn't that smooth and clear.  Looked a little like I was watching the video on a CRT tv.

You should definitely preview the workouts first because i got lost a couple times and craned my neck so dealing with a sore neck now. Otherwise very good workout

This video has 3 different 30-min workouts that target upper, core, and lower body. All are great workouts that make you sweat and make you feel like you're getting a good workout in a half hour.

I have watched part of it.  It seems that some of the moves are a little more complicated than many of her other workouts, but I love the fact that she divides the workouts into differing muscle groups, so you can train them on alternate days.  My favorites are Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism and No More Trouble Zones.  These workouts use the latest research in exercise physiology to help you get the most benefit both from a health standpoint and a body-sculpting one.  They are general very easy to do, and only require a minimum of equipment (hand weights and a mat if working out on a hard floor).  I use weight lifting gloves also to give me more traction for pushups and planks since I work out on berber carpeting.  As Jillian says, saying you can't afford to join a gym is not an excuse to not work out.  With these inexpensive videos, plus walking and running outdoors (free), you can stay very fit.",1437177600,,1073,4.298507462686567

I love her no nonsense attitude and her motivation always gets me ramped up. In this DVD she acts like a whole different person. She talks in a sing song voice that comes off as patronizing and then downright annoying towards the end of the workout.
The workouts themselves are odd combinations that don't make sense especially when she doesn't clearly explain what the movement is supposed to work or explain proper form. I don't know why this is called ""Killer Body"" because I know I won't get one using this.

I have done other Jillian workouts and I just completed P90X, and never had a problem learning the moves with any of those, but I did with this one. The moves are complicated, but after a few times I caught on and enjoyed it a lot more. I find this challenging enough if I follow the harder moves, and I like that these workouts are 30 minutes and combine strength and cardio. I feel like Jillian is more fun in this video than she is in the 30 Day Shred and other videos. Golden is like a hyper puppy and was very distracting at first, but I have even grown used to her.

I was weary of ordering and encountering the issues with the shaky camera shots and blurry images other reviewers were mentioning but I ordered anyway. Is the camera a little blurry at times? Well, I guess it sort of is but quite minimally and it's really not that big of a deal. Should production have caught this somewhere in the editing room? Yes, but again it's kind of so insignificant that maybe no one really noticed. I like what another reviewer said, if you're giving your all to the workouts, who even has time to notice the blurry shots anyway? This is true though, when I'm jumping to the floor doing burpees sure the shot may look blurry but I only noticed when I rewinded the frame and watched it again without doing the move. So basically people, if you want to get a killer bod, get this DVD. Jillian is awesome and her two companions are great, one does modifiers for those who need it and the other goes all the way. This is another addition to my Jillian collection and it is one of my favs. Stop thinking about it, order this DVD, you won't be disappointed!",1436313600,4,1175,4.36986301369863

I love the choice upper, lower, core because I don't want to do the same routine everyday and sometimes I get motivated by telling myself You just have to do core.

When she says you have to concentrate, she ain't kidding, but after a full day sometimes this mamma has a hard time focusing.  Second time through, and I really love it!  They are all HARD, and I would consider myself intermediate.  I'm only a week in and definitely seeing results.  I tend to rotate my Jillian videos and always gravitate to the No More Trouble Zones (my personal favorite!), but I think this set will stay in regular rotation.  I feel like by focusing on each area for a full 30 minutes, I'm really able to work those areas and see better results in a shorter period of time.

One HUGE pet peeve of mine is the advanced model for the lower body, Golden.  Super annoying!  What are those facial expressions?!  Why is your mouth agape for every freaking move?

6898876,4,B00R4JLJ4G,"I have just about every single JM video, love her. She packs a great circuit training workout into small amounts of time. I used to do the ""badass"" versions.,, but sadly have gained a bunch of weight and lost a bunch of fitness so here I am. That being said, I just finished my first week, and although I picked up the more intricate moves a little more on the second go around, it bothers me that her ""modifier"" (for beginners/less athletic) doesn't modify nearly enough. There are a few moves I can't do just due the the extra actual inches I have on my body; nothing to do with my physical strength or desire to do them. Like that table move on the Core workout- you're supposed to ""slide your butt and then go into table..."" Umm yea, my big ole butt ain't sliding anywhere! I physically can't do the move properly, so on the few moves I struggle with because of my weight I have to make up my own thing to do so I can be sure to get the burn. I wish she would have modifier demonstrate at least once a way that's not ""easier,"" but something I can physically do being the bigger girl that I presently am. She even laughs several times throughout that her ""badass"" can't even do some of the moves... So how am I supposed to? This is not me trying to justify half-assing some of the moves, I just want to warn bigger people out there like me to be prepared to be a little frustrated at times. But it's Jillian, I definitely didn't expect-or want- it to be easy! I want the killer body, after all. Still sticking with it. Anxious to see what moves I'll be able to do in a month that I can't do now. If I think about it I'll post an update at the end of the month. :)",1430352000,5,1666,4.1292307692307695

6898886,5,B00R4JLJ4G,"Fantastic! I normally don't write reviews, but this one deserves a good review after reading some of the ridiculous negative reviews out there. Let's start with the picture quality and sound. I was initially worried about purchasing this dvd, although I have most of her others, because of the negative reactions. However, I find it barely noticeable and the sound is spot on. If you're exercising and focusing more on the picture quality, then you are not working hard enough because the focus should be on you, your form, and making it through the workout to the best of your ability. The workouts are different and fairly challenging. I lift heavy weights at the gym, am in good cardiovascular shape, and I still find these workouts to have a moderate level of difficulty. Light weight circuit training is a great alternate way to condition your body. The sequence of the moves in the lower body workout are great - I feel like I'm dying and I love it! If the moves are too easy or too hard, then modify or progress, just like Jillian says. Do it and don't complain - it doesn't produce results!

As for Golden in the lower body workout, I love her! Her facial expressions are hilarious and they keep me going. I'm pretty sure she's not seriously making cheesy smiley faces, she's just being silly and more of the girls in these types of videos should have more fun with it.",1429401600,30,1377,4.597560975609756

Aside from Extreme Shed & Shred, which is a extremely long video, Killer Body is the most challenging of the Jillian workouts I've done. The combination of strength moves and cardio bursts really make me work hard and sweat like crazy and I'm in fairly good shape and exercise six days a week. I'm not trying to discourage anyone by saying the workouts are hard because there are beginner modifications, and I have to use a few of them. But, all three videos target different muscles and they are fun and I would recommend this video to everyone!",1429056000,19,768,4.654411764705882

6898894,5,B00R4JLJ4G,"I really love this video. I have all of Jillian Michaels' DVDs and this one is unique.

There are three different workouts: upper body, core and lower body.  There are four circuits for each. You go through one circuit twice, add a minute of cardio and then move onto the next circuit.

What's great about it is the new and interesting moves. I would say the majority of the moves are ones I haven't seen in the other videos. And they are difficult moves! I can't do all of them (yet). But it gives me something to work towards. Typically, workouts are made harder by adding resistance or deeper range of motion. But the actual moves are more challenging.

I highly, highly recommend this. Definitely not a beginner workout. Even the modifications are a challenge. But, again, it gives you something to work towards!",1428624000,,816,4.645833333333333

She looks awesome as herself, and better than what they did to her. Once again, awesome exercise routines as always!",1428624000,,418,4.30379746835443

6898905,5,B00R4JLJ4G,"I love this set of Jillian workouts. Killer workout; i add in heavier weights on some of the moves. Its excellent. It's up there as a favorite alongside Extreme S+S/Hard Body/Body Rev/ Level 3 of Ripped in 30. I also love to rotate between lower/upper/abs. Gives some muscles a breather.

One of the main reasons I am biting the bullet in writing my first ever JM review is about the quality issues people are experiencing: I bought the digital download via itunes and those aren't jerky or bad quality from what i can tell. Pretty crisp, sound is fine. I see a lot of people complaining about quality and i believe it may have something to do with the DVD itself, and not the production. Mine is perfect.

Now, if only I can get Jillian's Body Shred DVD as a digital download as I do not have a DVD player on my laptop and just have an apple tv box for my TV. (please please please JM, release Body Shred as a digital download -- take my money for a digital download please!)",1427932800,,976,4.327868852459017
6898906,4,B00R4JLJ4G,"This would easily get 5 stars if it weren't for the production quality.  How does a professional production get released this way???  Mine isn't as bad as it sounds like others', but it is distracting and annoying - it's jerky and the sound is off in spots.  I have several of Jillian's dvds, and like most of them, but this one has become my favorite because of the high quality and interesting workouts, but also I like the three different target area workouts instead of different levels.  I've been working out consistently for several years and I'm in decent shape, so I always skip right to the highest level, so I feel like I'm only getting one workout on each dvd.  This one has 3 that I can use.- and I really love the core workout - it's totally refreshing to work the core in a new way.  Jillian has also matured a bit in her manner from her early dvd's - she's toned it down a bit and become more professional, but kept the fun factor.",1427846400,2,947,4.322033898305085

The moves are totally fresh and fun - this is great because I have all of Jillian's DVDs and I feel like this one really mixes things up - with both the moves and the way that the circuits work.  As far as the jerky quality, it doesn't bother me.  I spend most of my time focusing on verbal cues to perform the moves and to work on my form - I don't watch the actual television that much.

6898915,5,B00R4JLJ4G,"This Jillian workout series is in my top three along with Body Revolution and Extreme Shed & Shred.  I loved the vibe, loved Jillian's attitude, and loved the moves.  I like being able to use all of my energy working my upper body, core, etc., rather than it being compromised because I've used all of my oxygen destroying my bigger leg muscles.  As usual, she offers a variations of each move making them more or less challenging, so there is room for growth.  I agree that the video quality is ""weird"" at best.  I'm not sure what kind of effect they were going for, there.  But it didn't distract me from the actual workouts, which are excellent.  My other complaint would be one cast member, Golden.  She does the advanced workout in the lower body segment.  She belongs in a Denise Austin video, not Jillian's!  She had the WORST, cheesy, open-mouthed smile going the entire time. I ignored her and focused on Jillian and Natalie, and all was good.",1427587200,4,952,4.579881656804734

6898918,5,B00R4JLJ4G,"I love the 3 workout options. I have done all of them and I am really happy with the variety. She seems a bit 'softer' in her personality in this DVD, and does take more time to explain the moves  - at a slightly slower pace than her other DVDs - which is a nice relief. There are new moves that are a bit challenging on my balance and coordination - but she encourages me to work harder to get them right. I think this may be my favorite of all of her DVDs so far. I have ben using it everyday and am motivated to keep going. I personally did not notice any issues with the DVD quality or jerking as some other reviewers have stated.

6898920,3,B00R4JLJ4G,Compared to Jillians other videos the quality is pretty bad. It looks like it was a video someone shot with their phone of the tv playing the actual video. Very disappointing. So far I don't like it as much as ripped in 30 or the 30 day shred. It's a good workout but some of the moves are so awkward that I feel like I could get a better burn if she just stuck to more basic moves. I feel like she just had to come up with new elaborate moves to sell another video.

I agree that the video quality is less than perfect, but it doesn't seem to bother me since I'm working out and not watching a movie.  I find the workouts to be challenging and fun as well as face paced.  The time required form your day is perfect...before you know it your done!  However, I guess I am one of those rare people that like it better when Jillian is tough and pushing hard. That motivates me. In this video she sounds like she is forcing herself to sound sweet and understanding. I like a drill seargent voice when I workout, it makes me push harder.  But either way, sweet voice or not, the workout is worth buying! I already see more muscle in my 47 year old body and I have only been doing this for about 3 weeks.  Keep it up Jillian!

In my opinion, this is definitely the best DVD if your looking for a total body makeover! In all three workouts I'm left drenched in sweat! I have only had this dvd for 1 week and already see results!! I'm excited to see my results after a month!!! Jillian is always upbeat and pushes you to try your hardest in this DVD and her others as well. I also have cervical/shoulder injury, I still have been working out, I just modify!!!

I am in good shape and work out daily. I think it is a very good work out - it was a while since I hadn't done one of Jillian's DVDs and she did not disappoint. I combined two out of three workouts every time and I was breathless and sore.

I just finished Insanity Max and while I consider the Beach-body workouts really tough, I sweated a lot more with these. Jillian's rhythm is somewhat slower but I think she builds more strengths and a better foundation for a stronger body. I find that everytime I do the Insanity work out my strength suffers and I need to lower my weight.

I have to wait at least two weeks to see the results, but overall the work out is very pleasant, easy to follow but yet good enough to give you a good workout. Jillian is very motivating as always and the girls she has chosen do a great job!",1426809600,,874,4.069767441860465

The compound exercises keep your heart rate up and you can add weight to make it more challenging.  Some of the moves I have never seen before and I love that!!  It's always great to try something new.  I highly recommend this dvd.  The price is low and you get three workouts for the price of one...can't beat it!!",1426550400,2,624,4.442477876106195

6898934,5,B00R4JLJ4G,"I preordered this and have done the core and the upper body workouts. FYI...they are HARD. This is by far the hardest Jillian that I own. I am in fairly good shape and I had modify quite bit, but I'll get there! Definitely a good purchase!

I read the other reviews and am surprised that others are having issues with the quality of the DVD. My copy is great and there are no issues at all.",1426377600,2,390,4.131578947368421
6898935,4,B00R4JLJ4G,I am a huge JM fan. I have a good collection of her DVDs. I really love this one. I did the upper body and core workout in the same day-30 minutes each. I couldn't believe how much I sweat. It really kicked my ass and I am not a beginner let me clear that. I love the workouts and I don't regret buying this DVD.Anyone who complains about this workout have to be either lazy or confuse because she does have a modifier for beginners. I Love it and it will be kicking my butt a few times a week. I will have to say though that the quality of the DVD seems bootleg though. I might ask for a replacement. I gave 4 stars because of the dvd quality.,1426291200,,644,3.9236641221374047
6898936,4,B00R4JLJ4G,"I am an advanced exerciser. This DVD is pretty much all resistance training using both light weights and body resistance, with a 1 min cardio blast with each circuit.  It is split out into three workouts (upper, lower and core) which I liked.

The upper body workout is good. As others mentioned, there are some new moves. The one that I loved was a rocking move where you are on your belly and rocking and then push up, this really worked my arms and was amazing! I had never done this before. I had to use 8-10 lb weights to really feel it in the other upper body segments. I really didn't love the lower body workout, it was just OK. I felt the moves were dangerous to do at home, especially if you have bad knees. She does show modifications, but even as advanced, you really have to be careful. She does a move where you jump in the air and do a bent leg split. There is another one that you kneel on the floor and then jump up to standing with both feet (she does show modifications) but don't attempt this if you are a beginner or have knee problems. If you do all the high impact plyometric moves, I would think this video is intermediate-advanced, and if you are modifying the moves and doing lower-impact it would be more of an intermediate workout (I modified a bit and I was in zone 3 most of the time with my heart rate monitor). For a really great workout, I used this with her 1 week shred. I had my computer and DVD player going at the same time and did 1 circuit of cardio from her 1 week shred, and then 1 upper body circuit from this DVD, and then alternated back and forth. That gave me a great workout! The cardio in 1 week shred is great.

Jillian is great in the video (not annoying) and does point out some important tips. I really wish Jillian would start doing more pre-mixes rather than just complete workouts.  The reason I bring this up, is because all of her DVDs are very similar from the standpoint that she does an each exercise for 30 seconds and then moves onto the next exercise.  I really wish she would do higher reps in some of her videos, especially a mostly all-resistance video. I felt like I could go for 30 more seconds with each exercise. Jackie Warner has different strength training styles, such as one video that focuses on pyramid and one that does each move for 1 min (she mixes it up). Cathe Friedrich is also really good about switching up the repetitions in her different videos(she has a high-rep video, or a slow and heavy, or interval). I feel that with as many videos as Jillian has, I really wish she would switch up the length of time she does a particular exercise. I wish she would come out with pyramid, slow and heavy or high-rep weight training video. I just end up modifying the moves to fit my workout. If she does an exercise for 30 seconds, rather than moving on to the next exercise, I'll just keep doing that move for 30 more seconds until I get muscle failure and then move onto the next (or I'll pause it and continue the move).

Overall it was OK and I will do it again, and I liked it, but I will just modify it to meet my training needs. The quality is poor, but nothing that prevented me from doing the workout. Someone mentioned the matrix, and it did make me laugh during the arm warmup when they were doing arm circles (it just lasts for a few seconds) and then is OK again (and laughter is good for the abs!)",1426291200,,3388,4.253105590062112
6898937,4,B00R4JLJ4G,"Unlike many people, I am not a big fan of her earlier DVD's. She tried too hard to be tough. But, in her later DVD's including this one, she is still tough but much, much more encouraging and positive. The workouts were tough. Not for beginners! I definitely worked up a good sweat. I completed all three. The Core was the most challenging for me. But, I these will be part of my training calendar. And, at just 30 minutes, it makes it hard to skip a workout.",1426118400,10,459,4.2272727272727275
6898938,4,B00R4JLJ4G,"The workouts are as promising as any of Jillian's other DVD workouts. There are three thirty minute workouts - one workout focusing on arms, one on core and one on legs. However, the visual quality of this release is pretty poor. I thought something was wrong with my TV picture quality, but after fiddling around with my TV picture settings, I realized it was the DVD. I can't describe the picture quality other than to say that it is a little ""jerky."" Still, it isn't enough to make me return the DVD.",1426032000,2,503,4.478260869565218
6898939,2,B00R4JLJ4G,Preordered this and got it the day it came out. Returned it because I thought something was wrong with the picture. Received another with same issue. The workouts are good just seems like a bootleg production. Same quality as pirated movies. I'll keep it and rotate with the other DVDs I have by her but could have been better without the visual problem,1426032000,6,353,4.619047619047619
6898940,4,B00R4JLJ4G,"I loooove jillian ! I'm in the best shape of my life and I have her to thank ! That being said.. This video is just okay .. I get that she has to come up new moves, however some of the moves are a little much, not hard just difficult to master... I'm an an advanced person in good shape..",1425945600,,288,3.737704918032787
6898941,5,B00R4JLJ4G,"If you like Jillian Michaels, this DVD will not disappoint (except maybe for the DVD quality as noted by other reviewers, although I haven't had any issues with that myself). I have many, but not all, of Jillians DVDs and have been using them on and off in my rotation. I think that in this DVD, she isn't as hurried as in some of the others and pays more attention to explaining form and modifications if you need them (although oddly enough for some moves such as rock star jumps in the upper body workout no alternatives are offered for those with bum knees etc).

The workouts are focused on strength, with one a minute cardio interval after each of the 4 circuits to spike your heart rate. There are 3 workouts, and I completed all 3 in the last 3 days. I think that the upper body is the most challenging, followed by lower body, and core. Overall I found them very doable but I don't think that I would recommend these to anyone just getting of the couch not used to exercising at all. Jillian gets creative with some of the moves and some of them I fumbled through (given that I only did each workout once so far), such as the cross-over push-up, and pike-press combo in the upper body workout. I generally didn't need any of the offered modifications, except for the ninja squat in the lower body work out. Yeah, maybe not, I don't think I am going to jump straight to my feet from knees on the ground, very funny!

Here are my comments on each work out:
Upper body: what is the thing about not giving a guideline what weight would be appropriate for each exercise (with a note to listen to your body and adapt as necessary)? I have noticed that in other DVD/online workouts as well lately. Does 'heavy' mean heavy for 8 reps or heavy for 30 reps? I like to know where I stand with the weight I use and/or what to aspire to. I used 8 lbs dumbbells throughout this workout, and that was definitely heavy for me. Although apparently not too heavy since now, a day later, I am a bit sore but not in a bad way.

Lower body: as expected this workout contains a lot of plyometrics (with lower impact modifications offered), but also some static holds in yoga warrior poses that challenge your balance and core along with the legs. I love yoga, but don't like doing these with my shoes on (which you need for the rest of the workout). i think that in this DVD, Jillian appears more 'human' than in some previous ones. In this workout she is kind of in awe of this 25-year-old fitness model who is demonstrating the advanced version of the exercises, which I found very funny and relatable since i am closer in age to Jillian than to that model.

Core: This is the first work out I did from this DVD. I would have preferred this workout to have a bit more lower back exercises (which are in the lower-body work-out) to be more balanced in itself, but it definitely hits your core in almost every imaginable way. One note of caution is that especially the second part of this workout is not friendly to those with any kind of shoulder injury. Variation of plank upon variation of plank; there is no way to modify your way out of these if you have any shoulder issues. Also, if you have bum knees modify the situp to jump-squat (no modifications are offered if I remember correctly). I have an old knee injury that allows me to do all the jumps just fine but I cannot have any torque on that joint so if I get tired and don't get up exactly straight then that's really bad news. I will modify this move next time.",1425945600,17,3512,4.332826747720365
6898942,5,B00R4JLJ4G,Did lower body at 6am and was begging for mercy by 6:30! Thanks for the great workout AS ALWAYS jillian! I have no complaints with the production and actually thought the outfits were super cute and colorful! I have every Jillian DVD and this is a great addition as always!,1425945600,3,273,4.48
6898943,2,B00R4JLJ4G,"There's something seriously wrong with the video quality here. The audio is fine, but the picture lags and seems to skip. I would give this workout 5 stars if somebody would have caught this GLARING issue before it was mass produced. I did the upper body work out, and although I liked it, I was seriously pissed off at how much the picture seemed to lag. Any time there is rapid movement, the girls limbs seem to slow down  la The Matrix (unless I am mistaken, and these girls ACTUALLY have super powers...). I'd be curious to know if the streaming version of Killer Body also has this problem. I love JM's DVDs (I own 11 of them), but I'm annoyed that I dropped 12 bucks on something that hurts my eyes, and frankly discouraged me from working my hardest.",1425859200,19,757,4.4071428571428575
6898944,5,B00R4JLJ4G,"Workout  is the best workout i have done so far.i just got and it already kicked my but,it is hard but as jillian says you have to work hard to get results i recomend thise dvd 100% i can't wait to do it again",1425513600,,209,3.75
6898945,2,B00R4JLJ4G,"My husband pre-ordered this for me.  I have all of Jillian's DVDs and love her and her workouts!  However, if you get motion sickness, this DVD is not for you.  It is blurry and jerky, just as the other reviewers said.  This rating is solely based on the quality of the DVD itself, not the workouts.  Awful quality.",1425513600,16,315,4.362068965517241
6898946,5,B00R4JLJ4G,"This is the DVD I've been waiting for!!  Besides Jillian's Kickbox Fastfix DVD, I don't think she has any other dvd that provides 3 different workouts targeting different zones.  If you follow Jillian's recommendations and follow the workout schedule accordingly, I believe you will see amazing results.  In addition, this workout schedule allows you to exercise 6 times a week without hammering the same muscle groups over & over again (your muscles need rest).

The workouts are closer to 35 minutes than 30 (for those of you who may be limited with time).  Some of the moves & combinations may seem confusing at first, so I highly recommend watching the workouts prior to trying them.  Each workout contains a warm up, 4 circuits & a cool down.  In between each circuit, Jillian makes you do a minute long cardio interval, which is awesome because it keeps your heart rate up.  So, these workouts are basically strength AND cardio (what a time saver).

Here are SOME examples of the exercises (not in order).

Upper Body
Walkout push-ups
Plank up-downs
Cobra rock-ups
Wide rows with flies
Bridge with lat pulls & chest press
Bridge with flies & headbangers
Wide push-ups into crossover push-ups
Static good mornings with low row
Cardio intervals: back crossover jacks, jab cross into rockstar jumps, single arm burpees, and arm circle kickouts.

Lower Body
Pendulum lunges
Static chair pose
Sumo scissor jumps
Curtesy pendulum lunges
Warrior 2 pose
Warrior 3 pose
Standing donkey kicks
Supermans
Surrenders
Deadlifts with heavy weights
Cardio intervals: long jumps with zigzags, donkey kick jumps into rockstar jumps, squat jumps into star jumps, and squat jumps into jumping lunges (ouch).

Core
Triangle pose with weights
Standing side crunches with weights
Elevator planks
Split crunches
Sit-ups into jump squats
Dolphins
Boat pose into sprawls
Cardio intervals: knee thrusters, high knees with twists, 3 point burpees, & squat jumps with sledge hammers

This is just a summary of the exercises (no way I can remember all of them!) just to give you guys an idea.

Some of the moves are hard, I won't lie.  I consider myself intermediate & even I chose to use the modifications most of the time. Speaking of, please don't complain about how hard the exercises are because Jillian provides very good modifications!!  If you want to, you could actually skip the plyo moves all together!

If you are a beginner, I would recommend starting with Jillian's Beginner Shred DVD first.  I'll admit, I'm a huge fan of Jillian Michaels, but that's because I have seen amazing results from using her workout dvds!!!  You get what you put in!!

Update (3/9/15):  some reviewers have mentioned that the video production is not that great.  I have now completed each workout twice, and I haven't noticed any of the ""jerking"" that the other reviewers have mentioned.  Then again, I'm not constantly staring at the TV screen; once I understand the movements, I tend to take my eyes off the screen to focus on my own form until the next exercise.",1425427200,141,3033,4.950592885375494
6898947,5,B00R4JLJ4G,"I purchased the ab workout only on Amazon Instant Video so this review is only for that portion. To be honest, I was expecting a variation of moves that have already been introduced to me by Jillian Michaels (I rotate several dvds/instant videos), which is why I only purchased part of Killer Body so far--just to feel Killer Body out. Let me just say, holy hell, my abs are killin me. I would not recommend it to anyone who is just starting out as a beginner. I have been working out with Jillian Michaels for a little over a year now and it took me a year to do all the moves in One Week Shred semi-comfortably. Killer Body reminds me of that particular shred but toned down just a half of a notch. Get ready to work! I've lost 14 inches and 20 pounds overall due to following this trainer's work and once again, Jillian delivers. I'll be purchasing at least one more portion of Killer Body.",1425427200,4,893,4.321428571428571

I was fooled by the chatter on the box claiming that it offered easy modifications, but found myself incapable of everything with my  damaged elbows and spine. I gave it a shot because it was cheap, and regret it.

I have had this for about 2 months now and I cannot seem to stick with it and instead return to a different dvd.  The issues I have with this is that the workouts seem lack a sense of ""flow"" (that is hard to explain).  It also drives me crazy that the models often get really out of sync with each other.  I realize they are offering modifiers, but there have been modifiers in many other JM workouts and they always stay at the same pace.  You really have to guess what you're supposed to be doing when they don't show the model you are following.  Lastly, the model ""Golden"" in the leg workout is totally distracting.  She makes really ridiculous faces and it's just hard to watch.  I also experience the technical issues that others have commented on, but that was not as big of a deal for me.  I cannot comment to the effectiveness of this DVD as I just can't stick with it long enough to see if it yields results.  Overall, I would not buy this one again.",1526860800,,1079,4.240196078431373

The workout would've flowed better if she explained the move first. I often found myself waiting to see what they were doing before I could begin.

So I started out with beginner shred, even that was tough because Id hyperventilate everytime my heart rate went up. I got lots of her other dvds and eventually worked up to this one. With lots of tears and sheer will power of course with the encouragement from Jillian Im happy and emotional to say that her DVDs have literally transformed the way I think about my ability to cope and push through.
