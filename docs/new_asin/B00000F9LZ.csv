8440285,4,B00000F9LZ,"""The Golf Specialist"", ""The Dentist"", and "" The Fatal Glass of Beer"" are the three short films that are included here.  The synopsis for these films are well known to Fields fanatics. These three have been found in many collections and, if you are looking for classic Fields on a budget, this is a cheap place to start.
The ranking reflects Field's participation in these classic short films, but a star has been removed for the poor tracking quality of ""The Golf Specialist"".  (Is there a decent print of this short around?)",1007164800,6,525,4.695652173913044
