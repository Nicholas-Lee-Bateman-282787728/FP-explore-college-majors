Ben Turpin and his trademark crossed-eyes shot to super-stardom when he joined Mack Sennett's studio in 1917. At the height of his career he would introduce himself with, ""I'm Ben Turpin; I make $3000 a week."" Hardly an overnight success, he had worked for decades in the circus, vaudeville, burlesque and film before being signed by Sennett. There, his comicpotential was maximized by casting him against type, as when he plays a sophisticated playboy. With the advent of sound motion pictures, he retired, having made a fortune with wise real estate investment. He occasionally returned to movies for highly-paid cameos. Viewing his work almost a century later, he is still hilarious.

This is NOT the best of Ben Turpin, one is really a Charlie Chaplin comedy with an appearance from Ben, another is from Ben's decline at the Weiss Brothers Studios. Only 'A Clever Dummy' is from the best years of Ben Turpin.
