7730294,5,B01E5XJGPW,"This show was far better than I remembered it to be.  I have been disappoined in other shows that I thought I liked but not in this case.  I think that the writting and the characters are excellent.  Sometimes it takes a few episodes for the characters to develope but not in this case.  It was great from the beginning.  I have savored each episode and cannot wait for the rest of the seasons.  I hope they will be released because it would be a shame if they weren't.  This has become one of my all-time favorites.  I think you would not be disappointed in this show if you are a fan of the old detective series.  The DVD quality is good and almost like it was filmed recently.  I especially enjoyed the promos.  Buddy Ebsen is excellent as the senior detective Barnaby Jones.  I liked that we got a complete first season even if it was only 13 episodes.  I felt that the price, although not a bargain, was ok.",1266710400,3,912,4.2631578947368425
7730295,5,B01E5XJGPW,"I remembered watching this as a kid and loved it, remembered the characters and style and song but you really never know until you watch it now, if it's as good as you remember, or just fond memories of a simpler time.  I love it!! I agree with everyone who says it....too much money for 13 eps...but at least it's not a half season!

I really loved watching it at bedtime, it's a great mystery/crime show...and loved that that Cannon was a cross over in the first episode.

UPDATE:

NOW I'M DEPRESSED! IT'S OVER, WATCHED THEM ALL, NOW I'M LEFT FLOUNDERING IN THE ""WILL THERE BE MORE"" ZONE WHICH AS ALL FANS OF ALL SHOWS KNOW, IS THE SECOND WORST PLACE TO BE (WORST OF COURSE IS, THERE'S NO MORE FOR SURE). IT WON'T LIKELY TAKE LONG TO ENTER THE ""FRUSTRATED"" ZONE WHERE I START REMINISCING ABOUT ALL THE GREAT DVD RELEASES THAT NEVER RELEASED A SECOND SEASON - OR WE WAITED 4 YEARS FOR A 2ND SEASON AND THEN THEY GAVE UP BEFORE WE COULD GET THE REST OF THE SERIES...

I can only hope Barnaby Jones goes the way of Vega$, only a few months later we were notified of the second set release date - as opposed to Quincy which took years and years, and Taxi, years and years for the final season, or Charlie's Angels, or worst of all Family where we never got anymore after the first set, or Knots Landing where they tested a second set years later and then almost immediately announced they weren't planning any more, American Dreams (never watched it live but fell in love with the dvd set right out of my mother's childhood), no word after the first release....etc... But on a higher note at least it's not still in the same boat as Trapper John MD (sitting in a giant vault buried in the desert somewhere, no word on any release ever).

Yes, I enjoyed Barnaby Jones more now than as a kid, and I sure wish there was more..now...not next year, not 3 years away, tonight, at bedtime, I want more episodes!",1266364800,14,1902,4.343661971830986
7730296,5,B01E5XJGPW,"It's fun to have Barnaby Jones on DVD at long last.  This was one of my favorite shows back in the 70s, partly because of Lee Meriweather, partly because of the snazzy theme song, but mostly because of the extremely likeable character created by Buddy Ebsen.  The basic idea of the wily old codger who rarely resorts to fisticuffs or guns, and only drinks milk, could have been painfully corny, but Ebsen's laid-back style makes Barnaby the kind of guy you want to hang around with.

The series holds up fairly well for a show of this vintage, and again it's Ebsen's performance, along with some above-average writing, that keeps it lively and interesting.  The style may be dated, but the characterizations are enjoyable, if not always convincing.

The DVD is nothing short of spectacular.  The colors are rich and vibrant and pop off the screen.  The picture is sharp and richly detailed.  Sound is mono and as good as it needs to be.  The only disappointment is the lack of any extra features, other than promo trailers for each episode.

If you're a fan of the series, this is a no-brainer purchase.  A solid presentation of a classic show.",1266278400,9,1144,4.67
7730297,5,B01E5XJGPW,"I love this show in reruns. But to own it on dvd and restored is worth it to me. The price is not bad at all I have a few of these shows on 16mm film one film cost what this set cost

Take the shows they are not edited at all just cut out the ad's. This set has something that in reruns is gone act I etc after the ad break. Also the next week 60 sec promo.

The colors are great unlike the films they are not red and are sharp and nice looking. Sound is also good.

No bonus stuff but so what to me I got the shows in order of air date and they look almost like new prints.

Best part it is a qm productions.

edit to add noticed one edit beep disc two ep4 The murdering class. word cut beeped out is the n word. Right at the end of act 1 when in the locker room. Do not think it was beep in the cbs run of the show.

The line goes like this.

""WE HAVE TO THROW A LITTLE LIGHT ON THE N IN A WOOD PILE""

To add this was not beeped in the first run or when wwor tv ran it in reruns. I think they should not change history with a bleep.",1266278400,6,1034,3.5644444444444443
7730298,5,B01E5XJGPW,"In terms of entertainment, Barnaby Jones ranks right up there amongst the best.  I have to say, I love US crime dramas from the 1970s - for me, this was the halcyon period for the detective / crime drama and this show is no exception.  Barnaby Jones is a show I consider to be somewhat underrated - it has a killer theme tune by legendary composer, Jerry Goldsmith, - so imagine my dismay when I saw an interview with the aforementioned composer in which he goes onto slate the show...! I'd not seen the programme in 18 years so was curious to see if Mr Goldsmith was correct in his derision or whether I was looking back through rose tinted glasses with regards to my memories of how good it was.  I'm happy to say it wasn't the former and neither were my memories clouded by rose tinted glasses! Barnaby Jones was never critically acclaimed but acclaim doesn't always ensure a programme is enjoyable - sometimes a show just comes together and if you think too much as to what makes it works you end up with more questions than answers - for me, this is one of those shows.  As I say, it's around 18 years since last I saw these episodes - I remember back then thinking the `Quinn Martin' announcer helped to date the show's titles and this was only reaffirmed upon viewing these discs! I live in the UK and actually received my copy today. I've watched a handful of episodes thus far and it seems that each episode runs at circa 51 minutes. The picture quality is very good with what appears to be crisp remastered images. With the exception of the episodic trailers; there are no extras on the discs. Also at just 13 episodes this is a complete Season 1 DVD release. You may argue that at the price, this is a lot to pay for what effectively seems like half a season. However; these are 13 decent episodes of classic television.  With 8 seasons in total, I sincerely hope that the show will continue to be released in complete seasons. That said, I have to say that  my interest in the show waned circa season 5 - this was the season that Barnaby took a back seat and Mark Shera joined the cast. Forget the price, take a punt on Season 1 and enjoy a few escapist hours with Mr Jones.",1265760000,4,2186,4.332518337408313
7730299,5,B01E5XJGPW,"I have waited a very long time for this series to come out on Dvd. I do wonder however is this going to be the only season of the series to be released?
I certainly hope not!!",1263600000,5,175,3.7567567567567566
7730300,3,B01E5XJGPW,"Shows might be great but come on, there are only 13 episodes in the 1st season so lower the price accordingly for I'm sure not paying this much.",1261526400,16,144,4.178571428571429
7730301,4,B01E5XJGPW,"Buddy Ebsen played Jed Clampett for nine seasons on The Beverly Hillbillies (1962 through 1971).  Anyone familiar with the series' theme song, The Ballad of Jed Clampett, is probably aware that Jed struck oil on his property while out hunting, became a millionaire, and moved with his family to Beverly Hills.  Ebsen, who up to this time, was mostly known for his dancing skills, played the grizzled, humble, and down to Earth mountain man, who was completely clueless, and out of his element in the big city.  While Jed was ignorant about some things, he was wise in others, honest as the day was long, and also one hell of a shot with a gun.  As the Clampett clan's moral conscience, Jed taught life lessons, and tried to show that doing what was right and fair, was the way to go.

Ebsen was 62, when The Beverly Hillbillies ended, but he was far from ready to hang it up.  Crime shows were very popular, and in 1973 Ebsen made his debut as investigator Barnaby Jones on Quinn Martin's private eye series Cannon, before quickly launching the character into his own series.  When his son Hal, a private investigator, is murdered, Barnaby decides to look into the case, aided by daughter-in-law Betty Jones, played by the lovely Lee Meriwether (Time Tunnel).  After solving the case, Barnaby decides to continue as a private investigator.

Because of his age, fights, chases, and physically demanding stunts were mostly out, and Jones usually relied on his intelligence, experience, persistence, and forensic skills, to solve cases.  There seems to be a lot of Jed Clampett in Barnaby Jones.  Soft spoken, possessing a similar sage wisdom, and strong moral fiber, the tall and affable Jones, carried himself with great dignity.  While not a drinker of anything stronger than milk, his eyes would blaze with fire when annoyed.  Some of Clampett's shooting skills appear to have rubbed off, as Barnaby Jones was probably one of the greatest shots in the history of television detectives.  In one episode, he hit the mark even though he had temporarily lost his sight.  As a midseason replacement, there are only thirteen episodes in the first season.  The premium price for what is essentially half a season's worth of content, results in a one star deduct.

With a super cool theme composed by the legendary Jerry Goldsmith, Barnaby Jones ran for eight seasons, and the total of 178 episodes, is one of the highest for a private detective drama.  Being the lead in a series, Buddy Ebsen was an inspiration.  An example that seniors were capable of a lot more than just sitting around in a rocking chair.  When the Barnaby Jones was cancelled in 1980, Buddy was 71.",1261008000,46,2664,4.800438596491228
7730302,5,B01E5XJGPW,"I have waited a long time for ""Barnaby Jones"" to be released on dvd and am thrilled to hear it will be released in HD with the full broadcast episodes.

I wanted to comment on the review where it was stated that first episode of ""Barnaby Jones"" was a two part episode where the first half half was on ""Cannon"". That is not true, originally ""Barnaby"" was suppose to be a spin-off of ""Cannon"" but then the network changed its mind and they redid the first episode to just have William Conrad be a guest star on the first episode of ""Barnaby Jones"".  There is however a two part episode several seasons later called 'Deadly Conspiracy' that starts out on ""Cannon"" and then continues on ""Barnaby Jones"" so I am sure that is what the reviewer is thinking about. I just want to mention this in case people read his review and think they will be missing something if they haven't seen the first part on ""Cannon"", no need to worry the first part was not on Cannon.

I didn't start watching ""Barnaby Jones"" until the 5th season when Mark Shera joined the show. After watching the 5th-8th seasons over and over and over I decided a few years ago it was time to see the first season to see how the show got started. Just the acting alone from Lee Meriwether and Buddy Ebsen in the pilot was enough to make me want to see all of the first season and I wasn't disappointed. The storylines and guest stars are great. I am really looking forward to getting to see the episodes from the original broadcast instead of the versions from syndication.

Since I wrote my review I have received my set and I am just amazed at the great job they did remastering these episodes.  They look so clear that I am seeing things I never saw before. The scenery in these episodes is stunning, you can tell they didn't cut corners when it came to location shooting. Also Barnaby's office never looked better.

I definitely recommend this set, it is certainly worth the price.",1258761600,14,1943,4.428571428571429
7730303,5,B01E5XJGPW,"For the first time, fan favorite Barnaby Jones is coming to DVD in a boxed set collecting the first season of the Classic TV detective series.

After years of fans wanting and waiting, our patience has finally been rewarded! This 662-minute DVD set brings all 13 the episodes as originally broadcast, in full screen video and English mono sound. They are also closed captioned. It's being released by CBS/Paramount, and while I've not yet seen the set, it's reportedly been carefully remastered, and contains all of the original musical cues.

Buddy ""Beverly Hillbillies"" Ebsen plays the tile role, while Lee ""Batman, Time Tunnel"" Meriwether portrays his daughter-in-law, Betty Jones. Barnaby heads his LA firm, while Betty provides him with invaluable assistance.

The Classic TV detective series aired on CBS from Jan. 28, 1973, to April 3, 1980. It premiered as a midseason replacement show, shaking up the CBS lineup by taking the timeslot of the Iconic Classic TV detective series Mannix, pushing it back to air one hour before the new kid on the block. Because of that, there were fewer episodes produced in its first season.

The Barnaby Jones character was introduced in 1973 in an episode in the third-season of the Classic TV detective series, Cannon, entitled, ""The Deadly Conspiracy."" The two-part episode began on Cannon and concluded on the premiere of Barnaby Jones with ""Requiem for a Son.""

An aging Barnaby had decided to retire and had left the private investigation business to his son, Hal. The now-grieving Barnaby decides to take the advice of his friend, Frank Cannon (William Conrad, in the cross-over from the show Cannon), to come out of retirement and solve the case in the pilot episode, ""Requiem for a Son."" His widowed daughter-in-law, Betty, joined forces with him to solve the case of her husband's murder.

At the conclusion of the case, the pair decided that they had worked together so well that they would continue to keep the detective agency open.

Until the cancellation of Cannon, the characters of both series moved back and forth between the two shows, an unique arrangement and a first for TV

Jones was also unusual, ordering milk in restaurants and bars, countering the stereotypical hard drinking detective. (Ironically, Ebsen was to disclose that he had struggled with alcoholism for decades.)

In 1976, the character of J. R. Jones, portrayed by Mark Shera, was introduced. J.R. was Barnaby's cousin. He had come to LA to try to solve the murder of his father, but stayed to help Barnaby and Betty, while also attending law school.

Barnaby was quite astute, noticing clues most other P.I.'s or the police had missed. Because of his age, Jones knew he would be bested in a fistfight with the criminals he pursued, so he used other means to protect himself, like slamming a door on the hand of a gun-carrying thug!

First season episodes collected here are: Requiem for a Son; To Catch a Dead Man; Sunday: Doomsday; The Murdering Class; Perchance to Kill; The Loose Connection; Murder in the Doll's House; Sing a Song of Murder; See Some Evil, Do Some Evil; Murder-Go-Round; To Denise, with Love and Murder; Little Glory, a Little Death; and Twenty Million Alibis.

Guest stars during the series were a virtual who's who of the acting talent of the day, including: Conlan Carter, Gary Lockwood, Stefanie Powers, Wayne Rogers, William Shatner, Leslie Nielsen, Richard Anderson, Claude Akins, Carl Betz, Meredith Baxter Birney, Bill Bixby, Jack Cassidy, Geraldine Brooks, Richard Bull, Dabney Coleman, Jackie Coogan, Glenn Corbett, Cathy Lee Crosby, Meg Foster, Anne Francis, Lynda Day George, Richard Hatch, James Hong, Claudia Jennings, Margot Kidder, Geoffrey Lewis, Ida Lupino, Roddy McDowell, George Maharis, Nick Nolte, Jessica Walter, Lynn Hamilton, Jon Cedar, Paul Sorenson, Roddy McDowall, and Gary Owens.

Let's hope the remaining seasons are promptly released!",1258588800,99,3917,5.1015625

HILLBILLIES"" and many other popular TV shows,many of which,STILL were superior in the Ratings,this show,a spin-off from ""CANNON"",really packed
a strong punch,considering that many TV viewers were used to seeing  ""Jed Clampett""-but now,Buddy Ebsen left another great TV trademark in the annals of TV history,with this,the second TV series for CBS by the great Quinn Martin,who began the 1970s,by branching-out to other networks,after an incredible decade at ABC-TV,where it began with classics like ""THE UNTOUCHABLES"",""THE NEW BREED"", the Emmy winning drama,""THE FUGITIVE"",
""TWELVE 'O CLOCK HIGH"",""THE FBI"",and the science fiction series,""THE INVADERS"",Martin's golden touch certainly did not diminish,when his other TV shows thrived on other TV networks,with equally amazing success! ""BARNABY JONES"" was really an amazing crime drama,because Ebsen really
 played a straight faced,""wiley,and brilliant private detective-and why not,,especially with an ally like ""Frank Cannon"",who got into his timeline! the first season of this 1973-1980 TV series,got off to a great start,for a crime drama,that ran some 8 amazing years! i'd recommend this TV series,to really serious fans of Quinn Martin's TV history,because this CBS show was really great to watch!",1422921600,2,1397,5.876847290640394

These continued well into the 80's also. Barnaby Jones ranks at the top of my list of favorites...along with Simon & Simon, Riptide and Cannon!
These dramas had very strong plots and overall excellent acting!
Although I wasn't a big fan of The Beverly Hillbillies, Buddy Ebsen brings a downhome charm and appeal to this character! He's great at piecing together clues and bringing criminals to justice.
He seems like a man of principals that a person could really trust! In other words, he makes an excellent private
detective!

It begins with the episode luring Barnaby out of retirement and also features a guest starring role by William Conrad as Frank Cannon. The two excellent private detective series ran in tandem during the mid-1970s and featured a few crossover episodes. Ebsen was a fine actor and gave the role credibility. Lee Meriweather played his widowed daughter-in-law and office assistant. She was a former Miss America and a pretty good actress, too. These shows are a pleasure to watch. Plenty of characterization, fine writing, and excellent action. I hope they continue to release the rest of the series.

7730386,1,B01E5XJGPW,"Let me preface my review by saying I love Buddy Ebsen and have been a fan of his work throughout his career, but he's way too old to give the character he's portraying even the remotest hint of energy or spark here.  Indeed, he's miscast, and as a result the series overall lacks a center of gravity.  If you're going to go with an older actor in a role like this, you need someone shrewd and tough and crafty, and vital enough to do his share of scrapping.  Ebsen is simply too soft.  Portraying an aging private eye as someone slow and plodding, his hands cupped around his signature choice of drink -- a glass of milk! -- makes for very dull viewing.  Barnaby exists in the passive rather than active tense, and is painfully slow off the mark. Nor do the plots rise above the predictable and pedestrian.  The writing is cliched and ordinary at best.  Even the jazzy theme music doesn't seem to fit the tenor of the show.  Quinn Martin, who produced the classic ""Fugitive"" series, uses his four-act structure in ""Barnaby,"" but it just doesn't quite seem to work this time around.",1370304000,,1081,4.479591836734694

The overall impression is very ""70's"", but I'd have to say, the way this series is put together had to have had some influence on how many others in the same venue were done.  Sort of laid the ground work for how to do detective shows for tv.  I enjoy it very much, in particular Mr. Ebson's performances and certainly look forward to the release of the following seasons.  I like how the discs are set up, you can watch a ""preview"" of the episode or just watch each one in it's entirety.

With fine actors such as Karl Malden, David Janssen, and of course Buddy Ebsen, you had a quality product that the network censors had no problem with. CBS / Paramount has started releasing early seasons of these shows and then stopped.

As for Barnaby Jones, I remember it being a mid-season replacement and put into the Mannix slot on Sunday nights. Season 1 set the tone. A retired detective finds his son's murderer. Using his own crime lab, contacts with the police and his lovely daughter-in-law Betty, he goes on to solve crimes for 178 weeks. If season 2 is ever released, you will see guest stars Dabney Coleman, Belinda Montgomery, Susan Howard, Daniel Travanti, Margot Kidder, Stefanie Powers, Linda Day George, Leslie Nielsen, Jessica Walter, Meredith Baxter, Susan Oliver, Nick Nolte, Teri Garr, among others. 24 episodes in all.",1325030400,9,903,4.901960784313726

7730411,5,B01E5XJGPW,"I grew up as a kid watching this show with my mom in re-runs during the hot summers around here around noon time.  I had remembered it, for some reason, as being a little corney yet fun.  But when I went and bought this DVD set some thirty years later, WOW, I didn't realize what a gem Barnaby really was.

Honestly this show is a lot like Columbo. Like Columbo, Barnaby is wise and figures out who the killer, kidnapper, or crook is pretty early on. Like Columbo, we actually know the badguys right off the bat and don't have to wonder ""who dunnit?""  Like Columbo, Barnaby ""plays dumb"" with the crooks and gains their confidence or uses his country boy charm (Columbo dummies himself down, Barnaby uses innocent charms).  Columbo likes a bowl of chili beans and a hard-boiled egg, Barnaby likes a tall glass of milk....

Both shows usually have a wealthy, powerful, arrogant antagonist who has the ""perfect crime"" set up only to have the hero unravel it steadily.  Barnaby is a charming, fun, I-wish-he-was my grandpa type of character.  He's a good-hearted man who gets to the bottom of things and doesn't take any crap either....

I think this show was severely underrated and an all-too-forgotten gem.

My favorite episodes on this DVD set are:

Requiem for a Son (great pilot, thoroughly enjoyed it, nice Cannon tie-in!)
To Catch a Deadman (just like on Columbo, Shatner plays a real turkey!)
The Loose Connection (Barnaby used unwittingly as a heroin transport)
Sing A Song of Murder (awesome episode about fraud and deception, loved it!)
Murder-Go-Round (maybe my favorite episode of them all with Claude Akins)
A Little Glory, A Little Death (outstanding plot, many twists)
Twenty Million Alibis (this is the most Columbo-like of them all)

I am just SICK that only one season of this great series has been released. Release em all for God's sake! Hurry! I'm dying now that I finished this season and there's nothing left.....help!

Anyone considering this show, ignore the $$$, it's worth it...enjoy!  The episodic promos, great picture quality, and quality discs are excellent.  Release them all!!!",1280275200,10,2108,4.8655462184873945

The video is beautifully restored and the many variations of the unforgettable theme song really make the show come alive.  In addition to the likeable acting of its stars and intriguing writing, ""Barnaby Jones"" often filmed on location, making the show much more realistic than shows that were taped entirely on a set.  It's enjoyable to watch a detective show that relies on wit and intelligence rather than violence and gore.

7730416,5,B01E5XJGPW,"Rather like Lew Grade in the UK, Quinn Martin was the engine behind so many great things on US TV in the halcyon days of the 60s and 70s.  Here is another prime example.  As a Brit I loved getting all those great shows here, usually a bit late, and usually on a Friday or Saturday night.  The list is endless: Barnaby Jones - Cannon - The Fugitive - The Invaders (shame it was cancelled!!) The F.B.I. - The Streets of San Francisco etc, etc, etc.  And what a wonderful roster of Guest Stars! Top calibre character actors like William Windom -  Jack Cassidy - Bradford Dillman - Robert Webber - Tim O'Connor - Lloyd Bochner - Murray Hamilton - Stephanie Powers, and the delectable Lynette Mettey (dear God I hope she reads this).  Together with so many others I cannot possibly list here they made these shows live by providing strong believable characters.  And who could fail to love that ""A Quinn Martin Production"" voice over - who was that chap?  Add to that some fantastic episode titles, read by the same guy, such as Perchance To Kill - Rendezvous With Terror and Sing A Song of Murder.  It's an irresistible package (well it is if you are 50+)

Anyway here is another classic from the Quinn Martin stable.  Thank heavens for multiregion DVD players. It means I can have `em all.  All I can say is MORE PLEASE and quickly.

Nothing.  Shows like Barnaby Jones had stories, and the people who made the shows knew how to tell the story.
  When I was a kid, shows like Barnaby Jones were the grown up shows you loved to be able to stay up to watch.  Now, grown up shows border on the perverse.  In the 70's, my sainted mom and dad took us to visit Cooperstown, New York.  It was a treat to be able to stay up late and watch a show like Barnaby Jones, while nibbling on Chicken in a Bisquet crackers (back then, that was one of the unusual crackers.  Now, there's a million varieties).  Now that my wife bought me the DVD from Amazon, I intend to watch Barnaby Jones, savoring not just the nostalgia, but the quality.

Jones is as calm, cool and collected as they come, his nonsense approach is like watching a master taking in every clue he can possibly find and solve the puzzle of who done it right before your eyes.
Buddy Ebsen plays the role of Barnaby Jones to a T.
If you want one of the more classier detective series of years gone by, ""Barnaby Jones"" would surely not let you down.",1270339200,4,644,4.201612903225806
7730420,5,B01E5XJGPW,"I vaguely remember watching Barnaby Jones as a child; couldn't wait to view this release.  If you're a fan of retro TV, don't hesitate to buy.  Great video quality, that haunting Jerry Goldsmith theme music, believable chemistry between Ebsen and Merriwether.  Lots of great '70s guest stars, wonderful vintage LA sets and scenery, Barnaby's cool brown Crown Victoria.  Are the plotlines a tad hokey and campy? Perhaps -- but Barnaby is much more than a doddering sleuth -- he's got a badass no-nonsense sarcasm with the perps, an easy rapport with 70s hipsters (He can ""dig"" rock music) and a gentlemanly dignity with everyone else.  Storywise these classic crime dramas still have a trick or two up their sleeves and are a great panacea to the frenetic, hyper, violent, techno crime shows on network TV today.  Not just for grandma!

Please, don't make us wait years for subsequent seasons.  I'd buy all eight at once given the chance.",1269561600,4,937,4.886075949367089
7730421,5,B01E5XJGPW,"This is such a quality series, from the acting to the attention to detail.  It is so 70's, and anyone who grew up in that decade will love this.  Buddy Ebsen is always wonderful to watch.  He is such a character!  The scenery and even the background music just make this a joy to experience. Also, lots of stars who are no longer with us, when they were in their prime are guest stars. I hope they come out with more Barnaby.  I can't get enough!",1269302400,8,446,4.1395348837209305
7730422,5,B01E5XJGPW,"Barnaby Jones was at the very top of my wish list for series that had yet to be released on DVD.  I haven't been able to see it even on reruns for over 20 years, so I am thrilled that the first season has FINALLY been released.  It's even better than I remembered: Buddy Ebsen is wonderfully understated as the soft-spoken, milk-drinking PI that does his own forensics work 1970s style.  The picture quality and colors on this set are amazing.  I can't believe anyone is carping about the price when it took this long for it to come out at all, but I guess some people can't be happy about anything.

I can't wait for the Second Season.  I would have bought the whole series at once.",1269043200,8,683,4.296875
7730423,5,B01E5XJGPW,"This is a fantastic DVD set. Iv'e seen a few episodes already and can't wait to see the rest. It Brings back great memories. Lee Meriwether looks as beautiful as I remember. Barnaby Jones contains a load of entertainment. It is a must buy. I own many Dvd sets from classic television shows. For example, Mannix, Cannon, Voyage to the bottom of the Sea, Gilligan's Island, Gomer Pyle, The Rookies, Get Smart, Time Tunnel, Lost in Space, Here Come the Brides, The Invaders...etc.. and by far this has the best picture quality. I can't get enough of Barnaby Jones. I sure hope they bring out all of the seasons.

7730424,5,B01E5XJGPW,"Although, as some reviewers have pointed out, these are on the expensive side for just 13 episodes, the DVD quality is fantastic.  These are quality single-sided dual-layer DVDs with 3 episodes per DVD, except for the last which has 4 episodes.  The original film been remastered and digitized with more than 2 gigabytes per episode.  So, as another reviewer pointed out, the quality on a large LCD screen is very much like Blu-Ray.  At least in this case, there is some truth to ""you get what you pay for"".  The Barnaby Jones series is excellent and ran for 8 seasons.  Hopefully the other seasons will be released with similar quality DVDs.",1267920000,6,642,4.738738738738738
7730425,5,B01E5XJGPW,"This is a great fun show and one of the best at the time it was on. Ebsen is great and the show just gets better as it goes. I got the first season, and have watch all 13 episodes. I just hope CBS does not pull a fast one and make us sit for a year are more for season two. I also got Cannon Season two Vol two.. This Vol bit really sucks. They need to put it all out at one time. i love all the old private detective shows and get them when they come out on DVD. Barnaby Jones, Cannon, The Rockford Files, Mannix. TV was just great back then. Now most of it is just trash. You got to  love DVD's and the good Old Shows......",1266883200,4,625,3.734848484848485
7730426,5,B01E5XJGPW,"I have been waiting for years for this and my only prayer is that all the seasons of this wonderful series will be released.  Every episode is a gem...true some are better than others but all of them are excellent!!!  Buddy Ebsen is charming, folksy and the main reason this show was almost as huge a success as ""The Beverly Hillbillies"".

The restortion has been done beautifully with all the episodes and I love the episodic promos before each of the episodes!!

Classic television entertainment at its finest from an era long past when television detectives were people to root for.  You can have your CSIs.......I don't even watch Prime-Time anymore...don't even have cable....but I do have a huge collection of classic TV that provides me and my DVR with hours and hours of splendid entertainment!!! I even have a schedule for every night of the week.....its as if I had my own Classic Network and I am proud to add Barnaby JOnes to the list.

If you recall this brilliant series and have not purchased it...I recommend it highly.  You will not be disappointed and I'm so looking forward to the rest of the seasons!!!",1266883200,4,1122,4.6938775510204085
7730427,4,B01E5XJGPW,"This show is one of those hard ones to rate.. the star of the show makes the show but the guest stars often shake it.. often hammy (Shatner) and uneven (Lt. Mitchell.. I mean Gary Lockwood) to the point that the shows are just merely 'good'. God bless him, Barnaby steals every scene and is in there throwing his folksy logic-filled right hooks but the truly 'great' shows (Columbo) are solid because nearly every show is laced with credible guest stars, sadly, that's not this one.

Now, the video transfer is another story; eye-popping.. to the point that on my 42"" LCD widescreen I have to wonder if this show were on Blu Ray.. would it look any better? Seriously, that good. I can't say much for the lousy looking photo shop cover-art.. but I guess it's not important.

Can't forget that theme song.. I can't say the theme song 'makes' this show but wow, something about it, in its many iterations throughout it truly blends sound and time into a memorable show.. as if by force. If the Fringe made you cringe at its lame attempt at a cast give Barnaby a look -- he may be old but he's bold, and I like that.",1266796800,4,1112,4.393203883495145
7730428,4,B01E5XJGPW,"What a great show! I love classic TV and got this for my Birthday from my mom. Loved Buddy Ebsen as Jed Clampett and have been wanting to see this show but it nobody has ever reran it inmy area. The pilot episode was great and can't wait to see the other shows. If you like classic Tv or detective shows, you will enjoy Barnaby Jones!!",1266796800,3,335,4.090909090909091
8757715,5,B01E5XJGPW,Great series from the 70's.  Video quality is very good as well.  Very pleased.,1530835200,,79,4.571428571428571
8757716,4,B01E5XJGPW,"I wasn't expecting much when I bought the first season BARNABY JONES. I was only getting it for the appearance of Gary Lockwood in one episode. I knew going in it was a Quinn Martin production and having viewed the entire five seasons of STREETS OF SAN FRANCISCO, I figured if nothing else, it would boast some great 1970s location work as well as a dizzying array of guest stars.

I was not wrong, nor was I disappointed. I was also wary because of not being a big fan of Buddy Ebsen, but he doesnt get on my nerves as much since hes not spouting the hillbilly dialect on this show. The lack of action (compared to other 70s cop shows like CHARLIES ANGELS, STARSKY & HUTCH and POLICE WOMAN) isn't really glaring either, because the writing and performances are so good.

This was a mid-season replacement so theres only 13 shows here and IMO the best episodes are the ones where Meg Foster plays a young woman who pulls a Gaslight on Barry Sullivan because he killed her mother; and another where a teen idol singer (played by Canadian icon Andy Kim) dies accidentally and his managers (Jackie Coogan and Arlene Golonka, who plays wickedly against type) try and profit from death. This episode also features Judy Strangis (Dyna Girl herself!) and minor 70s hunks Jonathan Goldsmith and Michael DeLano (as a pool boy).

Its kind of laughable how many of the bad guys just stand there and listen when Barnaby makes the final confrontationtotally unrealisticbut then its 70s TV. Its fun, quaint at times, and entertaining as a time capsule.

Enjoy the stellar video quality on this set, because it takes a nose dive on the other 7 seasons that were licensed to VEI by CBS.",1528588800,,1670,4.593959731543624
8757717,5,B01E5XJGPW,Great show.  It was always refreshing to see Buddy Ebsen solve the cases he would come across.  The guest stars in differently roles was very enjoyable.  William Shatner for one was excellent in a role other than Captain Kirk.,1502236800,,226,4.743589743589744

8757720,4,B01E5XJGPW,"G r a n d  70s  scenes of old L.A.  Seems to be a lot of Malibu type shots ,, rich folk and such.  Seems the producers were intent on illuminating Hollywood somewhat.  Barnaby, this gentle giant, manages to convince all the bad guys to just accept his insessant questioning with, hardly a blink of the eye.  A little silly how all just seem to  'Hollywoodishly'  allow his questioning of them.  Oh!  Another thing!  Smoking.  There is little to  N O  smoking!  Ashtrays  e v e r y w h e r e  though!  Smoking advertisements/billboards, but no smoking.  I wonder what s  up with that?  Some influence/message?!",1495670400,,609,4.453703703703703
