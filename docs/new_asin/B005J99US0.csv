8588939,5,B005J99US0,"As the old story goes, you can only push a guy too far before he stand up to fight back. ""Booley"" is a dark feature with a strange twist, and well done on a shoe-string budget. Concidering it's not a fresh storyline, how did Christian Grillo pull it off? Simple, he created a solid character and surrounded himself with fresh blood in the acting pool. Tom Detrik plays the title shlub, Angus Booley and he rules the role. A married guy with a dead end job who sees things going badly quick, and nice guys finish last. He is fired for no good reason, his wife is cheating and his lil daughter Rose is bullied in school. Angus grows to be a badass after viewing a Tony Robbins like guru on DVD named Jack Harrington, played by a good actor named Christopher Mann. Angus reads the guy all wrong and thinks it's good to committ murder and mayhem. Funny idea!

Grillo peppers the movie with stark images and over-the-top violence, and Detrik has a fun time in the mix of humor and pathos. It's not ""Straw Dogs"" (the original) because the ending is not what you expect, and the hook is original. Good movie about a fool with a mean streak. Supporting cast is quite good.",1319068800,7,1164,4.388888888888889
