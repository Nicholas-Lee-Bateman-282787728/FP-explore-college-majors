7849241,5,6303493696,"This is my favorite ST:TNG episode, mainly because of the introduction of  Reg Barclay, the extremely shy lieutenant with a crush on Troi. Dwight  Schultz (Murdock on ""The A-Team"") plays Barclay very well. Having  shown a talent for playing insane pilots and murdering  psychiatrists(""Diagnosis Murder""), among other things, Schultz  reveals his versatility through his portrayal of Barclay's awkwardness and  social anxiety. His behavior in the holodeck, as he fences with Picard and  flirts with Troi (the Goddess of Empathy) make this episode  hilarious.
Beyond Schultz's performance, I enjoyed the attitudes of the  rest of the crew during the show. Their initial mockery of  ""Broccoli"" gave way to offense when they saw how they were  represented in the holodeck. Troi's indignation alone made the episode  worth watching (she's funny when she's mad!). I would recommend this video  to any Trekkies, of course, but also to fans of Dwight Schultz, as his  acting is a large part of what makes this such a good episode.",965260800,13,1022,5.190184049079755
7849242,5,6303493696,"This is one of my all time favorite episodes.  Barclay, a junior officer who suffers from social anxiety and an extrememly nervous disposition retreats from interaction in the real world to the holodeck, where he  creates alternate personas for the main crew of the Enterprise.  Picard,  Riker and (I think!) Data are the three musketeers, Crusher is a pastoral  maiden who feeds Barclay grapes, and, best of all, Troi stars as the  ""Goddess of Empathy"" dressed in Greek robes.  When the crew finds  out about this program, you can guess how they all repsond to their  holodeck counterparts.  The best point of the show- when Troi tells the  Goddess of Empathy, who is spewing comforting pyschobabble to ""stuff  it.""  A must-see episode!",946684800,12,737,4.942622950819672
