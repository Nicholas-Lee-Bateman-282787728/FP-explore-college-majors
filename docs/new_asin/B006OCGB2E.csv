8501836,5,B006OCGB2E,"Mostly about technical aspects of playing, which is the fundamental issue with any instrument.  Will improve your speed and accuracy, even if you can already play Stick.",1419379200,,169,5.2592592592592595
8501837,5,B006OCGB2E,"Personal, one-on-one instruction on the Chapman Stick isn't readily available at every music instrument store nationwide, and that poses a challenge for a student on two levels: one, getting to know the instrument itself (which is helped by the books that are available), and two, learning the physical mechanics of playing the Stick, and how to get good tone out of the instrument. For that second challenge, the books don't quite fulfill the need.
Greg Howard's ""Basic Free Hands Technique"" DVD addresses that second challenge, and does it well. This DVD will help Stick players avoid awkward (and potentially harmful) technique. Highly recommended.",1333497600,6,651,5.330097087378641
8501838,5,B006OCGB2E,"I received the Basic Free Hands DVD back in January. I have had lessons with Greg on multiple occasions in the last 7 years, and my complaint has always been that Greg imparts so much information in such a short time, that I can't possibly remember it all. Each time I have met with Greg, much of the lesson has been reviewing material that he had previously taught me that I forgot.

That should never be a problem again unless I lose this DVD, because the first two chapters covers the material that I keep forgetting. That leaves the majority of the DVD for new explorations. The DVD has not left the laptop player since I received it. I have Emmet Chapman's book, both of Greg's books, Steve Adelson's book and DVD, the Sticktionary (Chris Crain), and the first tape in Bob Culbertson's series, and Basic Free Hands has earned it's place amongst these other incredible resources.

Whether you are just beginning, or an old pro, I would highly recommend this DVD.",1333411200,8,966,4.6104651162790695
