317632,5,6301166671,"I have been a fan of this film since its original big screen introduction in the early 1980s. In fact, while it was still on the big screen, I would drive great distances if I had to just to watch it again and again. Frankly, I have lost count of those joyous occasions. And with the recent death of Richard Farnsworth, The Grey Fox will remain as a great tribute to this wonderful film and its star. The dialogue is simple and authentic to the time. The cinematography is some of the best in modern filmdom. No special effects required here. Farnsworth does his own riding showing once again, that he was such a great and respected presence on the screen.  The photography will simply blow you away. The scene where Bill Minor and his lover are dancing with the glow of the Canadian Rockies at dusk in the background may be one of the most beautiful scenes ever. Other great scenes include the steam locomotive traveling along a steep canyon with the shape of the river below mimicking the gleaming railroad bed and the trail of smoke from the train under a darkening and damp Canadian sky. I get chills every time I watch it. This true story from Francis Ford Coppala's Zoetrope Productions, is beautifully, intelligently and skillfully presented and should be the keystone of every video library. Until the studios re-release this classic, hunt it down at your local video store while you can.",982627200,121,1396,4.651821862348178

317819,4,6301166671,I love this movie.  I enjoyed it in VHS.  But for some reason in the DVD release the not-too-brights who did this version use Irish music for the robbery scenes.  It makes a travesty of these robbery scenes and manages to damage what was a pretty good movie.  What were they thinking?  What has Ireland to do with the Far West?,1394582400,,327,4.295081967213115
317820,4,6301166671,"This 1982 film by director Phillip Borsos deals with a familiar theme. BIll Miner, played by Richard Farnsworth, is released from prison after serving more than three decades in San Quentin for stagecoach robbery. What he discovers at the turn of the century is that the wild west that he knew before his incarceration has disappeared. Not only are there no longer any stagecoaches, but technology has moved forward at such a rapid pace. There are mechanical gizmos to peel apples, stoves that work on electricity, and automobiles. To begin his reintegration with this new world this former gentleman bandit makes his way to the Pacific Northwest to live with his sister and her husband. Bill soon discovers that normal labor is not the life for him. A chance visit to a movie house where The Great Train Robbery (Edwin S. Porter, 1903) is playing informs this charming rogue that his new career will be holding up trains.
After a botched robbery in Oregon the protagonist makes his way north to Canada. It is here that he meets the people that will change the course of his life. He becomes a respected member of the community in a south central part of British Columbia (Kamloops).  Meanwhile the Pinkerton detectives are still in pursuit of Miner for the botched Oregon train robbery.
This film is based on a real life character and is true to the western genre established by The Great Train Robbery and continued by such directors as John Ford. Ford's influence can be seen in this Borsos film, particularly scenes that borrow from films like Stagecoach (1939).
The quality of the VHS tape is a huge step back compared to what we expect from more modern formats, still it is better to see this film on tape than to miss this Canadian classic altogether.",1394409600,2,1758,4.745098039215686

Any movie moment in which he appears is special.  He's the only person you see.

It's sad enough that he was ""discovered"" so late in life, leaving such a limited legacy.  But it's tragic that this quiet but beautiful film has -- apparently -- been lost.

or wrench your heart out  It just quietly entertains you with the funny/sad story of an aging thief having his
last go at glory and love.

If Farnsworth's performance wasn't so damn honest, true and lovable the film wouldn't work.
But, against all reason you root for this train robber, and take him into your heart.

317938,5,6301166671,Too bad this film is not yet available on DVD.  Farnsworth is a dream in this film.  The scenic views are spectacular.  A wonderful unexpected ending. But my favorite scene that stays in my head is Farnsworth and and his love dancing in a gazebo out on the plains with no musical accompaniment; surely the best scene ever in a film.  One of the very few films that I would give a 5 star rating for.,1360713600,,398,4.197368421052632
317939,5,6301166671,"I saw this movie at least twice in the theater. That's by far the best way. The cinematography is utterly stunning. The shots of steam locomotives coming around bends on mountain passes are gorgeous beyond description. Outside of a theatrical re-release (which will have to wait until I've made my fortune and ""planned out my pile"" and bought at least one theater) a full HD Blu-ray, or at least a DVD, would show off this work of art to best advantage. When will we get that? How did this gem just disappear?

The Grey Fox is a compelling film with a standout performance by Richard Farnsworth--possibly his best ever. His character, Bill Miner, is neither talkative nor eloquent. So everything depends on Farnsworth being able to communicate his character's thoughts non-verbally, with subtle facial expressions, mannerisms that are neither mannered nor labored, and body language that seems completely natural. Farnsworth utterly inhabits this character. You understand him. You root for him even when you don't necessarily agree with his decisions. Without this performance, that lovely cinematography would be a background to nothing.

Adding to that gorgeous background is a lively soundtrack by The Chieftains. I don't know who thought to put these visuals of the Pacific Northwest over a bed of Irish folk music, but the result is unaccountably perfect. The recurring main theme is not, I believe, by The Chieftains but is also wonderful. I used to own the soundtrack on cassette tape, but it developed that magnetic screech that they all do after being played too many times. I never got the CD and now it's out of production. Looks like I can get a used copy on Amazon for just $80. Sigh. Good thing I was able to locate a torrent and download the MP3s. (Ha ha! That's just a joke, FBI man!) It includes a lovely rendition of ""Sweet Betsy from Pike"" by Richard Farnsworth.

Cinematography, music, and acting. This film is engrossing and worth repeated views. I remain mystified by its obscurity and inaccessibility.",1359936000,4,2025,4.967551622418879

Then he sees a movie by Edwin S. Porter: ""The Great Train Robbery"". He's found his new calling.

Moving to Canada, he develops a love interest and some in town bcome slowly aware of his past. This is not a shoot them up western but a carefully crafted sensitive film, loyal to the period, where Farnsworth plays a likeable, well mannered and kind individual who would be the last person one would suspect of being a criminal. Of course, eventually a very dramatic crime is committed and Farnsworth is suspected by the local Police yet he seems elusive. Nicely done fim with an ending that leaves one wondering.

Farnsworth is so believable in the role, which is studied and beautifully underplayed. He is supported by a flawless cast and the burgeoning romance between Miner and feminist Kate Flynn - another great performance, this time by Jackie Burroughs - is both tender and credible.

The wole thing is played out against the rugged splendour of the Canadian Rockies and is topped off with a jaunty score provided by the Chieftains. Listen out for the haunting melody played over the closing credits.

After a number of years searching, I recently managed to get hold of an ex-rental video of the film The quality is not too good, but it will do for the moment.

This gem of a movie is crying out for DVD release - NOW!",1153094400,41,1142,4.742424242424242

Richard Farnsworth, Hollywood stuntman for decades, advances his career through prominent character roles and finally is cast in the lead of the Grey Fox and the Straight Story and upon his death the copyright owners cannot see their way clear to release a DVD of the Grey Fox?

And this is the same film industry that vociferously defends its property rights against copyright pirates?

The breath-taking cinematography, a riveting storyline and the surging rhythm of The Chiefton's score mentioned in nearly all past reviews make this work an obvious candidate for anyone's Top 100 Films.

318167,4,6301166671,"What's not to like about Richard Farnsworth? He was one of the few actors that received nothing but compliments during his acting days, an extremely likable ""old man."" Hey, few people every remember seeing this guy as anything but old, since he spent his younger days as a stuntman, rather than as an actor.

So, he was a very good choice to portray a likable thief: Bill Miner, the last of the stagecoach and train robbers. ""The Gentleman Bandit,"" I believe, was his label. This is a nice low-key adventure, with almost no bad language and the British Columbia and Washington state scenery is absolutely gorgeous. It would look great on widescreen DVD. What's the holdup? (pun intended)

The only bad news of this tale is the usual filmmakers' twisted message to root for a man who simply was a crook, nothing else. The film also - especially to get the younger audience - needs more action. It will be too slow for them, but I liked it, if for no other reason that I can listen to Farnsworth's voice all night.

It is a cinematography masterwork, and the actors, especially Farnsworth, gave subtle, compelling performances.  I have to send a ""shout-out"" to the studios responsible to PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE re-release this film so that everyone can enjoy it and see what a gentle and lovely actor Farnsworth was.

With no useful skills, and at an age where manual labor would drastically reduce his last remaining ""twilight"" years, he falls back on the only think he knows. Robbing. A blundered train robbery attempt, however, sends him fleeing across the U.S. - Canadian border to a small town where he can remain anonymous until the ""heat"" dies down. It is here that he meets a middle aged independent woman and falls in love. Here he befriends the local Police authority. Here where he reinvents himself as George Edwards, a new man with no past - just a future. But the past refuses to forget and when a persistent Pinkerton Detective agent arrives in town, past and future become inseparable and the ""Grey Fox"" must flee the chicken coup once again.

318170,5,6301166671,"Excellent movie based on the true story of Bill Miner (played wonderfully by Richard Farnsworth), a train robber who served 20 years in San Quentin only to emerge to rob again. It's his life, it's all he knows; he tries to fit in to the way of the world when he gets out of prison, but it doesn't work. So he goes back to train robbing.

He is a ""professional,"" a Robin Hood, gallant and wise. He gets caught again, but by then Miner realizes he's just an old man who life has passed by. The story undolds a bit too slowly at first, but gets better. There are some great scenes - one in particular in a hicktown movie house showing ""The Great Train Robbery"": Miner is mesmerized by the movie (cinema is a new invention) and we can see and feel it in his face. The Canadian locations are also beautifully photographed. Hopefully it will be out on DVD SOON!",1135123200,6,855,4.277777777777778
318171,5,6301166671,"The Grey Fox is one of the most thoughtful and beautiful westerns ever committed to film. Richard Farnsworth enjoyed a very long career, first as a stuntman and later as a character actor, and this performance is the pinnacle of his work. He is magnetic as the historical outlaw Bill Miner, and his portrayal presents a complexity of character rarely achieved by any actor in any generation. His remarkable face and expressive blue eyes convey with incredible subtlety both the innate tenderness and temperamental cruelty of a man whom progress has left behind, a man struggling to understand the world he finds upon his release, from over thirty years in prison, into a new century. This is one of the finest westerns of all time, and to this day percolates at the back of my mind.

Sensitively acted, beautifully filmed, and so completely authentic, this true tale of a lifestyle long gone and then tragically replaced by one just as bad, is among a meager handful of films that truly deserve to be called a ""keeper.""  And with few exceptions has a town been more beautifully portrayed than Kamloops.  Incredibly beautiful and so deserving to be photographed, this Pacific Northwest locale was the perfect spot for the telling of outlaw Bill Minor's escape from and then gradual emergence back into society.  Farnsworth and his costar, Jackie Burroughs, are a delight, and their slow and gradual courtship sequence is one of the most romantic to ever reach the screen.  The rest of the excellent cast complement them very well, and the fantastic use of film-within-film is perfectly done!  Farnsworth's large eyes and always bemused mustache steal every scene in which he appears, and the final scenes where he accepts the orange from the little boy are as real-to-life as it gets!  This one ranks right up there alongside a precious special few, such as Jackie Gleason's ""Gigot,"" Robert Duvall's ""Tomorrow,""  Robert Redford's ""Jeremiah Johnson,"" along with ""Silent Running,"" ""The French Connection,"" ""A Little Romance,"" ""Sophie's Choice,"" ""Conagher,"" and ""Dave,"" all outstanding films that deserve special recognition due to the intense, magnetic and all-out personal performances of their stars.

7810108,5,6301166671,"Like everyone else here, I have nothing but the highest praise for this incredibly beautiful piece of filmmaking.
It's the kind of film that inspires you to go to Film school for, (I did, CAL-ARTS).
Sadly, film's like this just aren't being made anymore. In fact, the state of film these days is so depressing I've
all but given up on watching the more current ones being made, turning to international & older films more often than not for entertainment,
delight & magic. ""Magic"" is a word that's missing these days in the film arts. Violence, sex, gore, hedonism & boredom
seem to be the only ingredients expressed in the medium these days & I'm ashamed of what the industry has become as a whole.
Dumbed down titillation & voyeuristic masturbation for the masses to get you through your morning commute is about
all that film is worth anymore or your basic ""ipad toilet room material"" when you have to go. And then, hope you don't fall asleep on the
can watching because that's how boring & unforgettable film has become. The waste of it (no pun intended) makes me ill.
The Grey Fox is the antithesis of all that is indecent in filmmaking these days. Because it is what taste & high praise in this art is all
about. It IS art. It is NOT crap. It's an intelligent film portraying quality characters w/ a top-notch script.
I don't feel the need to go into all the technical/artistic aspects of this film, they're perfect as everyone before me have so well expressed &
to say that the casting, particularly Richard Farnsworth as the Grey Fox, in the most prolific role of his career is spot on would be an
understatement. His performance is simply put, one of the greatest performances from an actor I have ever seen on film. If you weren't
familiar with him before seeing this, you will never forget him afterwards. Although he had worked in several well know
blockbusters before this, (Papillion, The Outlaw Josey  Wales, Blazing Saddles, The Duchess & the Dirtwater Fox, The Cowboys &
Tom Horn to name just a very few) and went on to work on many blockbusters after, (The Straight Story, in another standout
performance, nominated for an Academy Award, The Natural, Independence Day and Misery) & loads of television.., you may not
remember him in any of them but you will always remember & associate him with The Grey Fox after you see it and
for the achievements he made in this role forever more. I miss him sorely and when he died we lost a great actor
and a wonderful human being, another rarity in a business where you wouldn't want to be friends with most of the people working
there. In truth, I can't think of one thing about this film that wouldn't make it the complete, perfect little film. It's been a
long time since I've seen it, I have it on an old video somewhere but I've no video recorder any longer & like everyone else here
I check back once a year or so to see if it's been released on dvd or digitally yet but always in vain & I don't understand why.
If it sucks..,it's available. But this little masterpiece just isn't sexy or gross or violent or tacky enough to make the grade
to resurrect it. AMAZON, there is an enormous audience waiting for this film. YOU WILL MAKE MONEY OFF OF IT! DOES
THIS GET YOUR ATTENTION? MONEY!! PLEASE, BRING GREY FOX to digital & DVD. Thanks!
For those of you who haven't seen Grey Fox, I can't encourage you more to do yourself a favor & try to find a way to experience it.
Whether or not you are a fan of Westerns is irrelevant. I'm not a Western aficionado. I promise, you won't be disappointed!",1494806400,,3555,4.486111111111111
