4120858,5,B003G0E3EA,"This is my favorite of the hillsong DVDs. As it happens, it's my daughter's favorite, too!  It is funny, relevant and a great asset to teach my little girl about a relationship with God.",1359590400,,186,4.470588235294118
4120859,3,B003G0E3EA,"I bought this dvd and also ""Hillsong Kids: Tell the World"" to use at our church for our children's ministry. I like the ""Tell the World"" one much better. For some reason, I just don't love this ""Follow You"" one. It has a very, very 70's feel and they are all dressed very 70's, which I think I could get past, but I just don't love the songs, either. The kids at church never ask for this one, so we never use it and I ended up just selling it. I think I am going to buy ""Supernatural"" or ""Super Strong God"" to replace it. I love Hillsong Kids dvds, and usually love their songs, but I just did not love this particular dvd they put out.",1323820800,9,637,4.0236220472440944
4120860,5,B003G0E3EA,My daughter loves music and creative activities more then anything else. She has loved the previous kids videos fro Hillsong and this one is loved just as much. She sings the songs throughout the day and really just makes her happy. Great video and a great series of up beat happy songs.,1306108800,,287,4.538461538461538
4120861,5,B003G0E3EA,"It's great to be able to see music performed and the resulting worship, not just hear the cd. This is a really good product and will be helpful in my children' ministry.",1295049600,2,169,4.3125
4120862,5,B003G0E3EA,I really like how this is done.  Very genuine.  Upbeat songs and tender worship songs.  Special short segments of excited young adults sharing relevant scripture. Glad I purchased it.  I use it at kids church as kids are entering the area to help them focus on the Lord.  I also use it to reinforce themes that are being taught.,1294099200,6,328,4.491525423728813
