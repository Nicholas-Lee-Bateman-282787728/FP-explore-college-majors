8021139,3,B00023BN88,"No problems playing the movie.  Great condition, but not so great movie.  I purchased this movie because I'm a family member of one of the cast members.  So I was excited to get this movie for an awesome price.",1412035200,,210,4.333333333333333
8021140,1,B00023BN88,"Honestly, you can pretty much tell from the title and description that this one isn't going to win any awards.  I had looked to rent or stream it somewhere but who was I kidding?  It was purchase it or nothing.  The only reason I was even interested is because I live in Los Angeles and found myself dating one of the ""stars"" of this movie.  Since it was always a major topic of conversation, I thought it must be the modern-yet-unrecognized ""Citizen Kane.""

Sadly, it's rubbish.

The first red flag is that it was co-written by Dezzani and Waterer, who went on to star and direct (respectively).  Clearly a rsum-building piece, it tries to be a risqu romp of awkward sexual situations and humorous hang-ups but plays as if they were too uncomfortable to take us there.  Rsum-builders aren't always bad (never forget Damon's & Affleck's ""Good Will Hunting"" for a modest-budget example, or Dan Bucatinsky's ""All Over the Guy"" for a low-budget gem) but this one certainly explains why neither Dezzani nor Waterer ever made it beyond vehicles of their own crafting.

Though there were some interesting premises, it was clear that neither of them could move the story beyond the initial concept.  They can take some comfort in the fact that almost no one in front of the camera could have executed it even had the script been brilliant.  The acting leads you to believe that all the primaries walked off the set day one so they just handed the script to the extras and said, ""Here, read this out loud while we film you.""

Johanna Black is among the few spots of potential among the cast.  But Ana Mercedes as Rosey, the housekeeper who collects her clients' pubic hair, was the film's best prospect for success.  Once more, the premise was strong.  But this time, with Mercedes, so was the character.  Unlike the other characters, Mercedes let you feel her soul being torn by shame for her proclivities yet arousal upon their realization without once falling across the line into cheap camp.  For some incalculable reason (perhaps the writers finally realized they could not develop a character?) she got practically no screen time.  I found myself watching every other scene thinking, ""...but where is Rosey?!?""  An opportunity missed, to be sure.

People watch movies like this to be titillated, shocked, embarrassed, and to hopefully expand your mind beyond your own ideas by seeing the humanity in the characters.  Instead, you find yourself coping with story lines that never get off the ground and passionless characters wandering aimlessly through a poorly managed set.  Discontinuity fans, you'll love this one.

If you're interested in this genre, skip this movie and check out John Cameron Mitchell's ""Shortbus.""  Mitchell, whom you should remember as the Director and Star of ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" gives himself only a brief cameo in this much more sophisticated, fully developed and brilliantly executed exploration of human sexuality.  Mitchell skillfully ratchets up the intensity each time you find yourself comfortable with a character but never becomes unbelievable or unrealistic, and never ever loses their humanity.

Am I just lashing out at a bad date here?  Not at all.  It was a lot of fun and ended quite amicably.  But if this is the pinnacle of achievement in that career, as it seemed to be, I shudder to consider the future.",1304812800,,3354,4.886725663716814
8021141,4,B00023BN88,"It clearly teaches that there isn't such a thing as a deviant behavior,as the title strongly suggest. At least during  the time you watch the dvd. The film may be very upsetting , if taken seriously,but it's unlikely to happen.",1210032000,2,227,4.675

8021143,5,B00023BN88,"I was hesitant on purchasing the Deviants seeing I am a horror fan, but being a fan of Tiffany Shepis I decided to jump genres and check this movie out.  This was an excellent movie about finding matches for people with strange behaviors/deviants.  I guess you can kind of consider it a romantic comedy.  Tiffany Shepis was great in this movie.  Any Tiffany Shepis fans need to check this movie out.  I highly recommend purchasing it for your Tiffany collection.  5 Stars for a very enjoyable film. Tgoddess is rocks and I can't wait until the Hazing comes out in September!!!!",1092355200,4,577,4.663366336633663
