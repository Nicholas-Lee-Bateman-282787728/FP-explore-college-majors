8653905,1,B009V1SMT0,"If you are an avid athlete who has watched numerous Everest, Western 100, and historic Athlete Documentaries...this movie is not for you.  It is a complete ""whine"" fest from these superior athletes because they were stuck in a time warp and couldn't take their usual course of action if they were on a solo event.  This movie should never had made it to publication...tsk tsk Leki for sponsoring and for Trailrunner for sending us an invite.  There is no story...it is filled with haphazard feelings of frustration between Frost, Olson, and Clark as to what they endured while climbing peaks at a rate of 11 miles per day.  Congrats on making the speed record!!!",1526601600,,662,4.780701754385965
