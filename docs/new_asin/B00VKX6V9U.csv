7093199,4,B00VKX6V9U,"This is a perfectly charming, though not brilliant, police procedural. The lead detective is quirky, the pretty girl sergeant is smart and not a bit afraid of her boss. The locale is New Zealand, so don't expect to understand a word they say without captioning, as the New Zealand accent is unique and absolutely not a bit OZ-like. (Well, maybe a bit.) The point is, it is a lot of fun, well made, interesting characters, interesting crimes. More ""Midsommer Murders"" than ""Foyle's War,"" but that ain't a bad thing. Watch it.",1431993600,53,524,4.769230769230769
7093200,4,B00VKX6V9U,"I would give this series 4.5 stars, but it's certainly not worth $60 for 4 episodes of 90 minutes each! Nothing would be at that price, so this is not a comment unique to this series. Fortunately, I'm currently (May 2015) enjoying a free 30-day trial on Acorn. TV, which has released 2 episodes of this series so far. The last 2 episodes will be released on the next 2 Monday's in May.  I've also found many UK police procedurals and mysteries on Acorn, which I first learned about when reading reviews of similar series on Amazon prime. At first I assumed Acorn was available only in the UK, but then (coincidentally? not likely) I received an email from Acorn regarding their free 30-day trial. Then you can cancel or subscribe monthly for $5 - a super deal because they have so many TV series of this genre available & free.  In the course of 12-18 months, I had pretty much watched everything in this genre with a decent (4 stars) rating that Amazon Prime offered free and was forced to begin paying to watch successive seasons of my favorites or for any other new-to-me series that simply weren't free. Those small per episode charges really began to add up, particularly given the $99/year subscription. So I was delighted to find so much great programming (this specific genre, mysteries in general, dramas, etc) on Acorn that either wasn't available at all on Amazon Prime or that came at a fairly steep price. Admittedly, Acorn. TV's website, iPad app, & technology are downright clunky & almost amateurish compared to Amazon Prime! Sometimes (but not routinely) the quality of the video isn't great, and I do occasionally encounter difficulties with live streaming, which I assume are an Acorn issue. No, I'm not getting paid to advocate for Acorn! I'm just grateful I stumbled across it being mentioned in several Amazon Prime Instant Video reviews, and I'm passing along that favor to other readers of reviews! Unfortunately, this review will appear only in connection with the DVD set purchase, not on Amazon Prime since they don't make it available on Instant Video.
Back to Brokenwood Mysteries:  I thought this TV series from New Zealand was very well done and perhaps a bit undersold by the previous reviewer, even though I generally agreed with most of his comments & his overall assessment, which may or may not have been influenced somewhat by the high price. It's superior in many ways to ""Midsomer Murders,"" which comes off somewhat hokey to me & includes far too many instances of ""just in the nick of time"" rescues.  (This is true not just of the very early/old episodes. I've found it to be so even with the much more recent episodes/ series.)  The acting is significantly & consistently better in Brokewood, too! I gave it 4.5 stars and highly recommend it - just not at $60! Either wait until Amazon puts it on Prime Instant Video or give Acorn a try! Even if their free trial isn't available then, it's well worth the $5 monthly fee just to watch Brokenwood Mysteries.",1431302400,5,2996,4.720841300191204
7093201,4,B00VKX6V9U,"If you go by mystery TV shows, then just about every city or town in America and the UK has elaborately-murdered corpses cropping up all over the place.

So why should New Zealand be denied the fun? Hence we get ""The Brokenwood Mysteries,"" which focuses on a pleasant little down in the land of the long white cloud that just happens to have a number of mysterious corpses. While the first season of this series isn't dramatically different from other shows like ""Midsomer Murders,"" it has a pleasantly languid air and a quirky side that sets it apart.

In ""Blood and Water,"" Detective Inspector Mike Shepherd (Neill Rea) is sent to the rural town of Brokenwood to investigate an alcoholic farmer found dead in the river. Since the dead man was commonly considered to be an abusive beast who probably murdered his own wife, everyone assumes that he simply committed suicide... but Shepherd isn't convinced. As he digs deeper into the town's ugly little secrets, he discovers that both murders -- and the victim himself -- are not what they appear to be.

In ""Sour Grapes,"" the annual Brokenwood wine contest hits a sour note when one of the judges is drowned in a vat of wine. The immediate suspect is a brilliant but socially inept woman whose wine inexplicably didn't win the competition, but Mike quickly sniffs out a bunch of other desperate competitors who might have wanted this judge dead -- debt, sex and prestige being just a few of the motives -- and a merry-go-round of suspect vintages.

In ""Playing the Lie,"" the local golf committee stumbles across the body of one of their own -- Adele Stone, a cutthroat cougar who angered everyone who knew her, including the rest of the committee and her own sullen daughter. So there are no shortage of suspects for Mike to sift through, as he tries to deal with a ""Clubhouse Bandit,"" an illegal weed-killer, and the possibility that the world's least exciting major sport could have driven someone to murder.

And finally, ""Hunting the Stag"" when a literal stag trip ends in murder when the potential groom is found shot dead through the head. It seems like a tragic accident, but all three of his friends had discharged their rifles with nothing to show for it -- and they insist they didn't kill him. Furthermore, the bride doesn't seem as grief-stricken as she should be. Mike suspects that something darker is at play, and must figure out the killer's identity before someone else dies.

One thing I've come to expect from movies and TV out of New Zealand is a kind of quirky edge that you don't find from most other countries. And while it's sublimated to murder in ""The Brokenwood Mysteries,"" it's definitely there -- Mike'sT country music and tendency to talk to the dead bodies, the eccentric Russian forensics lady, and the cheery Maori jack-of-trades living next door to Mike. Oh, and did I mention that Mike's new house has a vineyard? For no real reason?

Don't worry, the crimes are still treated with seriousness -- each episode has a fairly brutal murder, leaving behind a string of seemingly unconnected clues that eventually prove that the obvious answer isn't the right one. Wrong wine, gun ballistics, odd pieces of clothing. There's also a running subplot about a mysterious woman who is hiding in Brokenwood, and whom Mike somehow knows.

In short, it has much the same whodunnit rhythms as many other mystery shows, especially ones from the United Kingdom, but it has a humorous edge (""You are aware she's in an aeroplane? ""Yeah, but just a small one!"") and a more languid, laid-back pace. It also makes New Zealand look pretty pleasant -- lushly green, with mist-wrapped forests and little farms, sunlit and sometimes redolent with recent rain, with white-painted buildings on either side of wide roads.

Mike Shepherd also makes for a pretty likable protagonist -- an unshaven cop who goes with his gut, listens to cassettes of country music, talks casually to corpses and claims to have an unknown number of ex-wives (only one has been confirmed). And while wheels are always turning in his head, Rea's mellow performance gives him the sense of great clarity -- he doesn't let himself be swayed in his estimations by a person's job, their reputation or their abilities.

While Sims can be irritatingly grumpy at times, Fern Sutherland makes a solid conventional foil for Rea's unshaven maverick; Pana Hema Taylor makes a fun neighbor who wanders over to offer beer and a smile. He does border on a deus ex machina at times, though -- he always seems to know someone or have bits of expertise relevant to the cast.

Country music and country murders litter ""The Brokenwood Mysteries Series 1,"" which takes the small-town mystery model and shifts it down to New Zealand. A pleasant if not groundbreaking little show.",1431216000,94,4792,4.81044957472661

There is NO Thrill or Suspense in the stories, or even any urgency on the part of the Team to solve these crimes. They are so relaxed and nonchalant about their job, like they are solving a cross-word puzzle, not murders. The characters are also 2 dimensional, so it's impossible to get to know them or to care about who done the crimes and why.

7093261,5,B00VKX6V9U,"This is a pleasant and reliable series.  Mike Shepherd, a much-married, tousled, urban detective takes a cut in rank in order to serve as Senior Sergeant in the small New Zealand town of Brokenwood, trading off hustle, bustle and stress for natural beauty and an easier pace of life.  That does not mean that Brokenwood is a prelapsarian Eden; brothers are still killing brothers and mayhem is still on the daily menu.

Neill Rea plays Shepherd.  He is a country music fan, the driver of a nearly antique car, and an individual who seems to have never learned that collars are to be buttoned and tie knots are supposed to cover the button, not hang halfway down the shirt.  Mikes female partner, Kristin Sims (Fern Sutherland) is more staid and disciplined; the two complement each other nicely.

I think of the series as a kind of Midsomer Murders Lite.  The stories are violent, but not obsessively so, the central detectives have interesting and attractive personalities; there is considerable natural beauty.  The difference is that MM contains top flight guest stars, higher production values and charming cultural quaintness accompanying the natural beauty.  The Cotswolds trump the New Zealand countryside.

Still, TBM is a series that one can count on for pleasant entertainment, decent storytelling and interesting characters.  As in Longmire, we learn about the local culture; a Maori actor has a recurring, strong role and we visit the local vineyards along with the highways and byways.  The series seldom disappoints.

7093273,5,B00VKX6V9U,"I'm new to this series and my wife and I find it very enjoyable. I like the chemistry between the different actors. The stories run about 90 minutes and generally keep ones interest. The main character detective Mike Sheppard (Neil Rea) is a lot like Tom Barnaby Of Mid Summer Murders. but with a different accent. I'm guessing that this takes place in Australia based on the accents although it could be New Zealand. Sometimes the accent from Rea doesn't quite sound authentic. Sheppard's side kick is a good looker, detective Kristin Sims (Fern Sutherland) . Sheppard doesn't carry a gun because he says he can't hit anything with one but Sims does but I think she keeps it in her car as you never see her carry it on her body except when she needs it and then the viewer will see it in her back pocket. Sheppard drives what is described as a classic car although in my day it would have been called a granny car. I have no idea what make it is. Sheppard loves country music so when ever he's in the car one will hear country music playing. This is a typical who done it series. My only complaint is there are only 4 stories in a set. I'm looking forward to getting series 2 & 3.",1488326400,2,1181,4.300448430493273

7093281,4,B00VKX6V9U,"New Zealanders must have grown weary of watching detective series from Great Britain, the United States, and Australia. In 2014, they came up with their own: The Brokenwood Mysteries. Brokenwood is a fictional farming town whose nearest urban neighbor is Auckland. In the first episode, Detective Senior Sergeant Mike Shepherd (Neill Rea) makes a trip from the city to Brokenwood on a caseand decides he likes the country life. He takes the soon-to-be-open position as head of Brokenwood CID, where he will be working with Detective Kristin Sims (Fern Sutherland), DC Sam Breen (Nic Sampson), and consulting pathologist Dr. Gina Kadinsky (Christina Ionda), originally of Vladivostok, Russia, whose morbid personality and deadpan delivery contrast with New Zealand conviviality.

""The Brokenwood Mysteries"" are fun shows for Americans, as we get to see the bucolic, very green New Zealand countryside and listen to a different accent than we are accustomed. But the best aspects of this series are that it is entirely lacking in dysfunctional recurring characters, and it makes fun of itself. The episode titles are often macabre puns. Its humor is good-natured and funnily morbid. Methods of murder of sometimes comically absurd, if horrific. Main characters are eccentric but never dysfunctional or insufferably self-absorbed. The oft-married and divorced- DSS Mike Shepherd loves his 1971 Holden Kingswood gas-guzzling car and country music, which he listens to on cassette tapes, but he is a meticulous detective with a friendly manner.

Det. Kristin Sims is at first frustrated with Shepherd's tendency to keep his reasoning to himself, but the two develop a working rapport. She seems normal not neurotic, alcoholic, unable to cope, or glammed up. She wears skin-tight jeans to work all the time, while her male colleagues wear suits and ties, but that is the only oddity. DC Breen is a regular guy good enough at his job, but he would rather be on a pub crawl. Everyone is friendly and enjoys his job. No one wallows in angst over anything. They are enjoyable to watch, no matter how improbable the murders and methods of investigation. The only criticism I have is that some episodes feel too long at 90 minutes. The detectives go around in circles a lot to fill them out, but 60-minute episodes would have been better.

The episodes are:

When the body of Nate Dunn (Chris Sherwood) is found by two fisherman beneath a bridge, it looks like a suicide or drunken accident. DSS Gary McLeod (Mark Clare) of the local police should be in charge of the investigation, but DI Mike Shepherd uses it as an excuse to make the trip out from Auckland. Gary has a personal interest in the case, having failed to solve the hit-and-run death of Nates wife Evelyn ten years ago, so he excuses himself from the investigation, leaving Detective Kristin Simms to work with the unorthodox Shepherd, who neglects to keep her informed. Nates son Dwayne (Marc Pritchard) and girlfriend Sally (Shoshana McCallum) are hiding something, and neighboring farmer Philip Henderson (Mike Edward) and Evelyns sister Jacinta OConner (Gillian Baxter) longstanding feuds with Nate lead Shepherd to suspect foul play.

Det. Mike Shepherd has traded his career ladder for the country life, purchased DSS McLeods home and 10 acres of grapevines, and become the new head of Brokenwoods CID in the comically-titled Sour Grapes. A wine from Bright Valley Vineyards, owned by Auckland radio personality Julian Bright (Peter Elliot) wins Brokenwoods annual competition, usurping Amanda James Vineyards and leaving Ms. James (Josephine Davison) outraged and upset. The next morning, the body of competition judge Paul Winterson (Alistair Browning) is found floating in one of Amanda James wine fermentors. The obsessive vintner is more concerned that the contents of the vat will be lost, and her wine for the competition many have been tampered with, for which she blames Brights manager Rob Visnic (Jeff Szusterman). Det. Simms thinks James has motive and opportunity for murder.

Allison Stone (Roz Turnbull), on her morning walk on the golf course, is sprayed in the face with insecticide and subsequently dies in one of the bunkers in ""Playing the Lie."" Allison lived next door and sat on the Brokenwood Golf Club Committee, along with pharmacist Neil Bloom (Phil Peleton), Roger Harrington (Ian Hughes), retired beekeeper Walter Elliot (Calvin Tuteao), and Committee Chairman Doug Randall (Peter Tait). Stone had a strained relationship with daughter Nicky (Greta Gregory), was carrying on an affair with the young greenskeeper Hamish Grimm (Elliot Wrightson), and was despised by all, leaving detectives Shepherd and Sims with an unusually long list of suspects and not much to do except continually interview them about their relationships with the deceased in order to piece together the ""tapestry"" that was the Golf Club.

Three men on a stag hunting trip go into the woods, but only two return in ""Hunting the Stag."" Hayden Reid (Francis Mountjoy), Frankie ""Frodo"" Oades (Karl Willetts), and Stent Baker (Ben Wright) were celebrating the impending marriage of Hayden to Kelly McKenzie (Jessica Joy Wood) with a drink and one bullet each to try to bag a deer, when Hayden was shot dead. With three men in the woods, three guns, three bullets, and two shots fired, it is up to Shepherd and Sims to determine if this was a tragic accident or murder. Kelly was a crack shot herself and doesn't seem to have an alibi. She and Hayden had become close after a car accident in which they escaped but a friend, the sister of Rory Parks, owner of the local Tire Center, was killed. Stent and Frodo work for Rory, as does Tania (Miriama McDowell), a woman Shepherd knows from witness protection.",1485129600,,5760,5.095338983050848

7093286,4,B00VKX6V9U,"I love British TV so anytime I can find a new show to enjoy, I'm ecstatic.  I have to admit that the first time I tried to watch this show, I wasn't impressed and turned it off within 10 minutes but I recently decided to give it another go, and I truly enjoyed it.  It is possible to skip an episode that may not interest you because each episode is s own story....there are no season long storylines to worry about!

Brokenwood is a small town in New Zealand that is populated by a quirky bunch of residents.  Detective Senior Superintendent Mike Shepherd is sent to Brokenwood to investigate a murder but also to check out a fellow police officer's performance.... After solving the murder, he decides to stay.  He quickly finds that the quiet little town has an awful lot of murders to keep him busy.  He's helped by Detective Constable Kristen Sims and DC Sam Breen, pathologist Gina Kandinsky, a Russian expat, and neighbor Jared Morehu, a Maori local who offers insight into the people and customs.  DSS Shepherd is an ""old school"" detective who doesn't like to carry a gun or chase after suspects; he prefers gathering as much information as he can and sifting through it until he finds the solution.  Shepherd is laid back and often comes across as bumbling but he is actually very perceptive and observant, frequently catching suspects off guard....similar to Peter Falk's Columbo.  DC Sims and DC Breen are still learning the ropes but are polar opposites:  Sims is by the book while Breen is more haphazard.  Pathologist Kandinsky is often brusque and frequently reminds the team how bleak Russia is compared to New Zealand.

The mysteries are interesting, storylines well written with a touch of humor...I've often found myself laughing.  There is limited violence, foul language and sexual situations so appropriate for most audiences and unlike most British TV shows, packed full with country music!  If you enjoy British TV but are a little bored with the usual fare, give this show a chance!",1483315200,,2007,4.796511627906977

Do not watch any version which does not have either close captioning or subtitles. Once that requisite is satisfied, this is a fairly charming and good mystery show. Someone else here compared it to MIDSOMER MURDERS but I am not willing to go that far. It does not have MMs wicked sense of humor and absolutely impeccable scripts.

The male of this team is the unmade bed type. He does almost nothing by the book. His partner, the female, is a by the book type. I am glad to see the police can use guns in New Zealand. She is always with hers but he considers it optional. When there is any shooting to be done, he lets her do it. He'd rather talk his way out of just about anything.

New Zealand policing in these smaller regions is not all that different from the policing on a UK mystery show. I expected it to be more different. It is much more like a UK mystery show than it is an American one. Well, except for the guns.

Give it a try using the captions.",1462406400,,1092,4.190476190476191
7093331,4,B00VKX6V9U,"Coming from way down under (think New Zealand) is a rather interesting crime show with a little country music to entertain.  Love the NZ accents! Seeing that I actually have distant cousins in New Zealand (thanks to my 2nd great Uncle Henry who left England in 1860 and sailed to the other new world), Im enjoying the show and scenery. Apparently, its filmed near Auckland.

Rather than the usual DI with deep emotional problems, we have a semi-entertaining character, Mike Shepherd (played by Neill Rea).  Hes had four wives, loves country music, looks a bit scruffy in his clothes, could use a good shave and haircut, and drives a classic junker.  Every time hes in the car cruising down the highway (on the wrong side of the road to us U.S. folks), he has an old cassette in the dash, playing a country song. The show pretty much uses all country tunes as its backdrop music.

His partner in crime, Detective Kristin Sims, is played by Fern Sutherland. She carries the gun, gives a good chase after runaway suspects, and banters with Mike adding to the entertainment.  They make a good team, and Im enjoying a more lighthearted atmosphere after having left the grim Hinterland that ticked me off after the season finale.  (I still have visions of that darn burning trailer.)

Brokenwood is a fictional location, small town, and everyone knows everyone.  Reminds me of Midsomer Murders.  Actually, you wonder after all the killing how in the world the population keeps steady. Of course, in this New Zealand version, there are no bushes being parted in the dead of night by gloved hands or peacocks screaming in the background.

As far as the mysteries, actually they are a fairly good mixture of who-done-it.  Deaths scenes are not quite as bloody and gross and some shows  thank goodness.  My guessing of the culprit has been off a few times, but as good detective shows go, they always get their killer in the end.

If you're looking for another binge watch, you might enjoy this.  Its not as binge-prone as most shows because I can still wait to see the next episode at my leisure.  Unfortunately, I cant say that about a lot of others that drive me to post-traumatic series disorder (or whatever that make-believe mental disease I came up with a few posts back).

If you have the patience for that minimal change of acceleration expectation, you'll find this series charming, and fun.

7093400,5,B00VKX6V9U,"Hi,

Loved this. This is actually the first New Zealand series I've ever bought - which is probably shameful since I am a kiwi. But it was worth the wait. This is clearly New Zealand's answer to the Midsummer Murders, and it's surprisingly well done. Replace the English counties with rural New Zealand towns and the rest sort of follows. And for those of you not from this neck of the woods let me tell you, I've been through dozens of towns exactly like Brokenwood - except for the murders of course! (Must go make sure the door's shut properly!) I believe the show is filmed in Warkworth, but for those who wouldn't credit it, most of the smaller rural towns of the central North Island are much the same.

The real strengths of the shows are the characters - and not just the detectives - the humour and the scenery. The plots are also pretty decent. But in truth I have to say that for season one, they weren't that hard to solve. Season two which has just screened here, has been much tougher. But half the fun of these shows is solving the crime and then seeing if you're right. So working out whodunnit is no bad thing.

So here's hoping there's a season three.

Cheers, Greg.",1447027200,,1184,4.392694063926941

7093486,5,B00VKX6V9U,"Peter Falk's Lt. Columbo was, perhaps, the prototypical rumpled detective.
Columbo always looked as though he'd slept in his clothes, drove an old car that looked as though it might die at any minute and seldom carried a gun. He solved cases by asking the right questions of the right people until, at last, all the puzzle pieces fit together and he arrested the killer.
Neill Rea, the star of ""The Brokenwood Mysteries,"" is, in my opinion, a worthy successor to Falk's Columbo. Equally rumpled, his Senior Sergeant Mike Shepherd is a fan of country western music, has been married (and divorced) an indeterminate number of times, would rather talk than shoot, and drives a car that is 20 years older than his erstwhile female partner Detective Kristin Sims (played admirably by Fern Sutherland.)
Brokenwood is a small town on New Zealand's North Island and Shepherd's first case involves the death of a man widely assumed to have gotten away with the murder of his wife several years earlier. Shepherd is sent to town from police headquarters to take over the investigation from local officers, much to their consternation, and his lone-wolf approach to crime solving rubs most of the Brokenwood force the wrong way. The fact that the earlier investigation into the dead man's wife's death seems to have been badly botched doesn't make his work on the current case any easier or win him any new friends.
Shepherd is a tough-minded, big city cop but, despite that, he's also someone willing to give people a break when that seems called for. Sims, meanwhile, is young and ambitious and pretty much by-the-book in her approach to law enforcement. They don't get on together at first but, gradually, they develop a rapport that serves them well in all four mysteries in this set.
The series is heightened by the fact that the beautiful New Zealand scenery is featured prominently throughout all four mysteries and by a fine supporting cast. The writing is crisp, the action plausible - no costumed crime fighters - and the direction keeps each episode moving smoothly.
An excellent series.",1437609600,37,2087,4.915014164305949

7093502,4,B00VKX6V9U,"THE BROKENWOOD MYSTERIES is a very good show.  Not great, but not bad, with the singularly attractive feature that it was produced in New Zealand, which provides some unique elements.

Where the producers have maybe overstepped themselves a bit is by advertising the show as a ""New Zealand Midsomer Murders"".  For fans of Midsomer Murders, that is a pretty enticing lead in.  But as it invites, indeed emphasizes the inevitable comparison, things become problematic when it becomes apparent that, while very good, THE BROKENWOOD MYSTERIES just does not have the pedigree that Midsomer Murders has.

Neill Rea as Detective Senior Sergeant Mike Shepherd is very good.  He projects the world-weary detective we are all familiar with, but succeeds in putting his own stamp on the paradigm.  Where THE BROKENWOOD MYSTERIES might have the slightest edge on Midsomer Murders is that Shepherd's sidekick is a very attractive female, Detective Kristin Sims, played by Fern Sutherland.  Her interplay with Shepherd has a long way to go before it will become as endearing as either Tom or John Barnaby's rapport with any of their underlings, but the fact that she is a beautiful woman and Shepherd is an oft-married sort of jaded Romantic--well, anything could happen.

The four feature length mysteries themselves are pretty straight-forward.  No new ground here.  But as in most police procedurals, it's the style, the flair, the inventiveness that really counts.  In that regard, THE BROKENWOOD MYSTERIES is still finding its feet.

Bravo though for showing the world that New Zealand is more than just a location for fantasy films.  As the show is being renewed for a second season, viewers can only hope that it will continue to evolve as a good show in its own right, and not one that relies on comparisons that might show up its weaknesses rather than its strengths.",1437177600,3,1862,5.042483660130719

There aren't quite that many homicides for DI Mike Shepherd (Neil Rea) and DC Kristin Sims (Fern Sutherland) to trip over just yet, but it's early! The setting of a small New Zealand town (and the lovely NZ accents!) gives this series a fresh feeling, even though Brokenwood, like small towns everywhere, is filled with secrets and busybodies. Shepherd has a trace of Columbo: a rumpled cop in his ratty 70s wheels and love of C&W music. His starchy partner goes strictly by procedure, so she finds herself at odds sometimes with his policing.

7093521,5,B00VKX6V9U,"THE BROKENWOOD MYSTERIES, SERIES 1.  This new crime drama, a television series, is one of the few detective dramas  set in lovely Down Under New Zealand, a place outsiders don't often see.  The police procedural features a mix of mystery and dry humor reminiscent of MIDSOMER MURDERS.  This Kiwi series , set in a scenic, seemingly quiet country town; was filmed in the beautiful  country of New Zealands North Island. There  Detective Inspector Mike Shepherd(Neill Rea), a true slob of a man  think COLUMBOfind that murder can happen anywhere as he works alongside Detective Constable Kristin Sims,( Fern Sutherland). I received this as a review copy. This DVD 4-disc set and the Blu-ray 2-disc set each feature four feature-length mysteries, running approximately 376 minutes, plus bonus cast interviews. And, thank goodness, its got subtitles, for the New Zealand accent we hear here is even more difficult than the Australian.

Detective Senior Sergeant Mike Shepherd (Neill Rea) is seconded  to Brokenwood, a rural  town where memoriesand animositiesrun deep. Hes an experienced cop who owns a 1971 classic car, a collection of country music cassettes, an indeterminate number of ex-wives. He decides to move permanently to the sweet-looking town, taking  demotion to do so.  Where the new woman in his life is his assistant, Detective Sims, a by-the-book investigator nearly 20 years younger than his car, who has to pronto get used to his lone-wolf ways. But, as Shepherd adapts to the slower pace of life away from the city, he soon discovers that Brokenwood is a place of secrets and suspicions. Everyone and everything may be connected, and the serenity of the countryside can easily be shattered by violence and death.  The episodes are:

1. Blood and Water.
The body of a local farmer , a well-known drunk, is fished out of the slow-moving river. Shepherd , seconded to town, wonders if it was suicide, accidental death, or something more sinister. The man had  a reputation for violence; many in town might have motive to do him harm. However, the inspector comes to believe the answer to the case may lie in an unsolved 10-year-old murder .
2. Sour Grapes.
The morning after he has chosen the winner of the annual Brokenwood wine show, a guest judge is found dead in one of the loser's vats of fermenting pinot noir. But the vintner  in question, who, perhaps, unusually for a woman, has Aspergers syndrome, is more concerned with another crime-the tampering with her wine before the show. The detectives suspect the same criminal is responsible for both.
3. Playing the Lie.
Four of the five committee members of Brokenwood Golf Club start on their regular morning round - only to find the horribly disfigured body of the fifth committee person near the first green. Shepherd and Sims find that the deceased inspired loyalty and loathing in equal measure around town.
4. Hunting the Stag.
During a bachelor weekend hunting trip, three friends set off in pursuit of a kill. One of them ends up dead, with a bullet in the head. Who fired the fatal shot? Or was there a fourth shooter?  The detective pair  find the deceased's fiance  had other relationships that may have led to the killing.

The series is well-written, the plots are tight, original and involving; there are some fairly gruesome deaths, but the overall tone is lighter than some other contemporary detective series and there is no onscreen sex.  Big pluses: Among the cast are some fairly visible Maori, the natives of New Zealand; Sims is not portrayed as a gushing, simpering girly girl blond.  The acting is uniformly good.  And the scenery, the sun dappled fields of New Zealands  countryside, cant be beat. Recommended.",1435622400,3,3705,4.948303715670436
7093522,5,B00VKX6V9U,"I'm a huge fan of what are called ""procedural crime shows"", where a crime is committed and you watch the detective (or police officer) solve the crime by putting the pieces together. Some of the best are those produced for British, Australian or Canadian TV. This may be the first one from New Zealand that I've seen. It snuck up on my and I was hooked.

If you've read my other ""TV mystery"" reviews, you know that I do not believe in ""spoilers"" so you won't find any in this review and I'll try to provide info that will help you decide if the show is for you, but not spoil any of the enjoyment. (After all, it wouldn't be a ""mystery"" then, would it?)
The series aired in New Zealand in 2014 and may, or may not, have had commercials. Each of the four episodes runs from 91 to 95 minutes and each is on a separate DVD. Each story uses the same format: A murder is committed in the opening moments and nearly always has at least three obvious ""suspects"". It is then up to Detective Inspector Mike Shepherd (Neill Rea - who is a male, I might add) to solve it, with the help of his female assistant Detective Constable Kristin Sims (Fern Sutherland - another actor not familiar to me). Shepherd arrives in the small rural community of Brokenwood just as Episode 1 begins. He drives an old  1971 ""classic"" car and dresses in frumpy jacket and tie (at no point in the whole season is his collar button closed or his tie straight!). With is ""black humor comments"" and dress he'll remind you of Peter Falk's character Columbo.

Each of the four stories stands on it's own and there is little (though some) info about Shepherd's and Sim's private lives. The plots are ones you've seem before (and way too often) - someone is poisoned at a wine tasting, a hunter is killed which hunting with his friends, a golfer is killed at his fancy country club - but you will be caught up by the finely drawn suspects written by head writer Tim Balme. And, when solved by Shepherd, it will all come together.

The show has been available on Acorn's (the DVD's distributor) streaming service since last year but has never aired on US television to my knowledge. Since this is ""Season One"", I was glad to see that the series was renewed. You should know that, as the fourth episode ends, there are no ""cliffhangers"" or major loose ends, and so you can watch this set on its own.

Another interesting thing about this series is the music - not something you look for in a mystery series. Shepherd likes ""country music"" (and still plays cassettes in his car) and each episode includes about a dozen songs playing in the background, nearly all written and performed by a guy named Delaney Davidson or a woman named Tami Neilson. I even learned that there is soundtrack album on itunes NZ.
There are two short bonuses on the fourth DVD. There is a five minute interview with Neill and Fern and a five minute interview with writer Balme. (For some strange reason the first interview has a ""cave-like"" echo!)
There is some graphic violence but no strong language and no nudity.

There are English subtitles but I found the NZ accents very easy to understand and didn't need them.

If you like well-crafted mysteries, I can highly recommend this series. Another winner from Acorn.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7093523,5,B00VKX6V9U,"A cop show that engages the viewer better than the average murder mystery TV show. It is not heavy and dark like many of the contemporary shows. Less blood, more brain work. The investigation is more intellectual, not reliant as much on science and technology as are most current police who-dun-its. More realistic.
I LIKE THAT.
Brokenwood has action, humor, real front-page-possible plots while visually stimulating like a travelogue (filmed on New Zealand's north island.)

Characters are well developed for a new series. Mike Shepherd (Neill Rea) goes from DI, to DC, and finally DSS in the Brokenwood CIB (Criminal Investigation Branch). He uses his wits to assimilate clues, and even sits and talks to the dead victims. He's the team outsider, while young but dedicated Sims (Fern Sutherland) feels no comradery, and she hates the Country Western music Shepherd plays in his classic car's cassette player. Jared (Pana Herma Taylor) is the local love-magnet, but he can also get in touch with the rougher class of locals. Sam Breen (Nic Sampson) is third man on the team with Gina Kadinsky (Christina Ionda) the pathologist.

SDH SUBTITLES for all 4 stories, as well as the interesting bonus features. A disc for each episode. Quality picture.
[Ep1] Blood and Water ==92min: A body is fished from the river by fly fishermen. DI Shepherd investigates the possible suicide or murderer's victim. Too many have motive & secrets. An excellent first taste of the friction between Shepherd & Sims due to age, gender, style, and investigative modes.
[Ep2] Sour Grapes ==99min: Brokenwood wine show guest judge is found drown in a wine vat. The vat owner is more distressed over the wine loss than the victim. Now DC Shepherd's become a vineyard owner. Wow, Country Western wine songs, who'd-a-thought? Scenery can't get any better than this.
[Ep3] Playing the Lie ==90min: 4 Brokenwood Park Golf Club committee members happen upon the body of a female committeeite on the 1st green, in the bunker of her last hole--after a life full of accumulating enemies. A very funny LOL ending on the course.
[Ep4] Hunting the Stag ==95min: A pre-marriage stag party hunting trip to Cutters Gully gets a kill but unfortunately it is one of the hunters--the groom--not a deer. Could the shot have come from one of the victim's co-hunters or as another gun in the woods? A subplot is left open, begging for a second season.

A true KIWI delight.",1434499200,,2427,4.943627450980392
7093524,5,B00VKX6V9U,"Episode 1 starts with a Country & Western song in the background. I thought - ""Wait a minute. I thought this took place in New Zealand?"" It does, and there's no reason why that should stop Detective Mike Shepherd from playing nothing but C&W on his car's tape deck.
'Tape deck?"", you ask. Yes, Mike Shepherd is inordinately fond of his ""classic"" 1971 Chevy Kingswood V6. Everybody else thinks it is a joke to ride in it, but he will not be dissuaded from his car or his music.

As Mike tells Detective Kristin Sims, there is a good reason for him to like Country & Western songs: ""Come on, they're the best three-minute crime stories ever sung. There's heartache, adultery, jealousy, divorce, death. It's all in there.""

This show has a great cast of characters. Mike Shepherd is not just a seriously effective Detective, he has a goofy sense of humor. He also talks to the victims. He doesn't expect any answers back, but he likes to fill them in. Detective Kristin Sims is his right hand, and they work well as a team. Then there's Gina Kadinsky, the pathologist from Russia, and Jared Morehu, Mike's Maori neighbor and jack-of-all-trades. Good acting all around.

Brokenwood is a small town in the heart of New Zealand. Per the show's lead writer, in a bonus feature, it doesn't have more than 5,000 people. Travel a bit outside of town and you can find farms, vineyards and woods for hiking and hunting. Look in the right direction, and there's a mountain range in the distance, because, after all, New Zealand is not that big. I've attached a map because I'm still working on figuring out where my new favorite New Zealand town ""is"".

""Brokenwood Mysteries Series 1"" originally aired in 2014 in New Zealand on NZ On Air. It is a total 396 minutes of very good mysteries. Each of the four stories is over 90 minutes in length - that's a lot of time to develop the characters and tell a good story. I thought some of the plotting was really excellent. This is an original TV series, not based on any books.

The 4-disc DVD set is distributed by Acorn, and presented in 16.9 widescreen and stereo sound. English subtitles are available. The last disc has two Bonus Features

1. ""Blood & Water"" (92 minutes) Nate Dunn is very drunk, which surprises no one at the bar. So when he tells his son, Dwayne, ""I tell you, I'm going to blow the lid,"" it doesn't even register. Dwayne drives his dad home, and leaves to join his girlfriend. It's 8:30 on a dark clear night, and Nate makes his way alone to a bridge over a lazy river. He points at a meteor tracking through the sky and starts to cry, murmuring, ""There you are."" That's just before someone approaches in the dark, knocks Nate out, and pushes his body over the railing into the water.
The next morning, Detective Senior Sergeant Gary McLeod is examining Dunn's body, pulled from the river. A Field Crime Inspector from Police Central turns up, Detective Inspector Mike Shepherd. Gary asks, ""Our body's on your computer already?""
Shepherd, ""I know, I know. Facebook. Twitter. It's all a miracle to me.""
A little later, one of McLeod's Detectives gets a call to check out a ""loiterer with intent"". Detective Sims pulls up to a parked car, with the driver watching a woman cross the road with two kids. There's a humorous exchange before she finds out it is Shepherd watching the woman.
So, in the first 10 minutes of the show, we have 3 mysteries. Who killed Dunn? Why did Shepherd start out from Control (2 hours away) before they even discovered Dunn's body? And who is the mysterious woman that Shepherd is watching?
This first episode is great - excellent plotting with twists and heartache all around. Enough even for a C&W song.

2. ""Sour Grapes"" (99 minutes) After the end of episode 1, Mike quit Control to stay in Brokenwood as a Detective. He bought a home outside of town with 10 acres, 4 of it in grapes. It's this last that encourages him to attend the Brokenwood Wine Festival in the Town Hall. Paul Winterston, head judge, announces the winning wine. Some people are pleased. Some are not. Which is probably why Winterson is found the next morning, drowned in a vat of wine owned by Amanda James.
I mentioned Mike's sense of humor. When Amanda arrives at the crime scene, Mike asks her, ""Merlot, was it?""
Amanda, ""Pinot Noir.""
Mike: ""Pinot Noir with a hint of dead wine judge. Could make for an interesting vintage. <pregnant pause as he sees their faces> Too soon?""
This episode, again, has great characterizations. In particular, Josephine Davison is brilliant as Amanda James, an adult with Asperger's. I'm happy to say that the episode presents Amanda without caricature, good and bad.
[Off topic, but for a good idea of how Amanda's mind works, I'll mention one of the best novels I've read the past year.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rosie-Project/dp/B00BSBR9N6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rosie Project</a>, by Graeme Simsion, is a very funny and loving novel of an Australian man who has Asperger's syndrome, and his search for a wife.]

3. Playing the Lie"" (90 minutes) Just after dawn, Alison Stone is power-walking through the Brokenwood Park Golf Club, as is her habit. She notices that the door of a groundkeeper's shed is ajar, the broken lock on the ground. Suddenly, someone bursts out of the door in a full hazmat suit and sprays Alison in the face. The screaming Alison stumbles off, her face one big chemical burn and blood coming out of her mouth.
Her body is found by the first foursome out on the course, who just happen to be members of the Golf Club Committee with Alison. The same committee which had a most unharmonious meeting the night before: ""Let's vote before someone kills somebody.""
This is another complex story. Not without humor, such as after they've interviewed Nicky, Alison's unlikable teenage daughter: ""If you believe her phone, Nicky Stone was tweeting her little heart out yesterday morning. So little to say, so many opportunities to say it.""

4. ""Hunting the Stag"" (95 minutes) It's three hours before dark. At a cabin in Cutters Gully, three friends get ready to hunt. Their tradition is, they each throw down a shot of tequila, then each hunter gets one bullet. One bullet, so you have to make it count. To make it extra special, it's a stag party for Hayden, and he's using a brand new Klusener 55 rifle, a wedding gift from his fiancee. They head into the woods their separate ways, each in a blaze hunting vest. But only two come back. Hayden has been shot with his own gun. But from 50 yards away. Now that's a puzzle.
But the pathologist is sure. As she tells Mike, ""I'm from Vladivostok. I know about gunshot wounds.... a man gets up. he walks to work. A car pulls up, takes him into the forest. He didn't pay his dues. He gets shot. His dues are paid.""

Bonus Features:
1. ""Interview with Neill Rea and Fern Sutherland"" (6 minutes) Rea plays Shepherd and Sutherland plays Sims. Rea cannot talk without gesturing with both hands.
2. ""Interview with Writer Tim Balme"" (8 minutes) Tim says, ""It was really important in 'Brokenwood' that it wasn't a heavy and dark kind of procedural."" I think he succeeded with that. He also has a good take on why people love murder mysteries.

If you like Mike's taste in music, you can find the atmospheric songs from ""The Brokenwood Mysteries Original Motion Picture Soundtrack"" on itunes. According to the show's official website, season 2 will start filming in 2015.

Edited to Add:  Season 2 is now available!

7093526,4,B00VKX6V9U,"I started watching these on Acorn. The first one seemed a little slow, but I read somewhere that it was Midsomer-like, so I stuck with it. By the end of the first episode I was pleasantly surprised. The pace is like Midsomer, stately with an undercurrent of humor, and the locals dropping like flies. The plotting, casting, and acting is first rate. Some of the dialog is incomprehensible due to local accents and slang, but that adds a bit to the charm. Not quite Midsomer Murders or Foyle's War, but what is? This series is well worth the time spent watching it. Oh, yes -- the country western music adds an oddly endearing background to the series.",1432512000,2,651,4.572649572649572
7093527,4,B00VKX6V9U,"What started out as a cliche murder mystery series did turn out much better than expected. 'The Brokenwood Mysteries' is a series of two-hour murder mystery stories set in a New Zealand country town, Brokenwood. The death of a man who's wife was killed years ago, brings Detective Inspector Mike Shepherd, from the big city. There is a worry that the current chief won't be able to put two and two together.

Neill Rea, plays DI Shepherd, a slovenly man, with an unshaved face, who loves country western music, has at least 4 ex wives, and has a sharp wit and IQ. Fern Sutherland, plays Detective Constable Kristin Sims. She is a pretty young woman with a good head on her shoulders and resents the appearance of DI Shepard on her turf. Eventually they get on, but there are trials.

I found this series on Acorn TV, and so far there are only three episodes, and each one is better than the last. The rural New Zealand countryside is beautiful, however, we find everyone has something in common. DI Shepard knows his crime, he picks up clues easily that lead to interesting perspectives. I like country western music, but the apparent disdain for this music by everyone but Shepard gets old very quickly. The accent is lovely and easy on the ears. The episodes are well written. Shepard needs to look less slovenly, this does not become him or the series. The jeans on everyone else are tight and well fitting. I enjoyed this series, and I understand series two is on it's way.

My favorite country western song title : How Can You Believe Me When I Say I Love You When You Know I've Been A Liar All My Life?
