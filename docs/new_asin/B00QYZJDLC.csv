6890719,5,B00QYZJDLC,"I love this show! It is a feast for the eyes, the mind and the senses. Vivian (sp?), the chef, has such a lovely, easy going manner about her, while managing a very complicated life. She and her husband are new parents, live in a very rural area and run a high end restaurant completely focused on showcasing the best of what local farmers have to offer for the season: vegetables, meat, fruit, seafood... everything.  What I love is that we get to go with Vivian to meet the farmers, see where they produce what they are growing, appreciate the gifts that they offer and understand the special magic she sees in what they have produced  Even better, we then get to go inside the restaurant kitchen and witness the additional magic that she applies to what just came out of the field. Bonus is that every now and then we get a recipe from her and get to watch her make it. On a Thursday night I watched Vivian make smoked corn relish, realized I had most of the ingredients I needed, got the rest from the market the next morning and made it for a dinner party that night. HUGE hit! Rave reviews all around. Thanks V!  I also enjoy Vivian going into personal kitchens and asking home cooks about how and why they do what they do so that we can learn from them as well. It's fun to learn about the traditions of Southern food this way. My family has lived in the south since the 1600s and I spent a lot of time in the kitchen with my grandmother and my Mom. It was always my favorite place to be. But, I've never had this much fun as being in Vivian's kitchen, witnessing and learning from her. The videography is great, the subject matter for each episode intrigues me, and I am entertained every moment. Truly a visual and sensory journey  So much fun.",1436054400,2,1753,4.319148936170213

6890722,5,B00QYZJDLC,"Big fan of the show, and was happy to add this to my collection.  Vivian Howard explores all facets of farm to table cooking in a restaurant milieu. Take a trip to a farm or a producer in each episode to see where the foods come from that she prepares as chef of her own first class restaurant.  She also takes you on a journey to see how traditional country dinner and dessert staples are prepared, as done by local ""chefs"" - the cooks we grew up with in Eastern North Carolina.
Vivian and Ben run a great restaurant, and this series takes you places you will never go on any other cooking show.  You will learn a new appreciation for old favorites.",1433030400,5,650,4.2682926829268295

6890729,2,B00QYZJDLC,"I watched this show a few times and agree with the reviewer who said she'd like less venting on the show.

Right away, Vivien seems a little cynical about ""having to move back home"" just because her parents's financial backing required it. That tone permeates her responses to conflict that she has with her husband, her staff and it seems, herself. Rather than being grateful for the opportunity not only to have her own restaurant, but to have it FILMED and aired for others to see, it just seems that either she is unsure of herself and therefore gripes about how things will turn out. Or, is just ungenerous in spirit for everything that she has been given and offered in life. I don't watch it anymore.",1475798400,2,707,4.566929133858268

6890733,5,B00QYZJDLC,"Even if you aren't into Southern food, cooking programs, or reality TV, you will enjoy this engaging, captivating series. There is nothing else like it on television today. Essentially, it is the day-by-day story of chef Vivian Howard and her family as they encounter the struggles, surprises and thrills of running a couple of restaurants in Eastern North Carolina (very far from where I live!). What I love about the show is that it is so real, so human. There is nothing artificial about this family; they do not relish celebrity or try to ""act"" for the cameras. We walk through the mud with them, smell the fermenting grapes, sweat in sweltering home kitchens with masterful cooking grandmas, watch their twins grow, and cry with them as their restaurant burns down in the beginning of the series. Full of heart and soul, A Chef's Life is one of those rare viewing experiences which allows you to completely connect with the people and places it portrays. Okay, it's about food. But it's about so much more.",1452902400,3,1011,4.782857142857143
6890734,3,B00QYZJDLC,"Reality show meets downhome Carolina cooking. Chef Vivian and her husband leave the bright lights and Jerusalem artichokes of Manhattan for eastern North Carolina, where she vowed never to return. They opened the Chef and the Farmer http://chefandthefarmer.com/ restaurant in Kinston, NC, to introduce upscale locavore fine dining in an area where the average per capita income is less than $18K per year. If successful, they could add jobs, provide new revenue streams for local farmers, and slow the rate of decline.

Seems like a great idea, but I kept getting the feeling that Chef Vivian doesn't really believe it. She seems almost ashamed that she wound up in Kinston. When a noted food writer comes for lunch, she mentions that his group will spend the day exploring Kinston so, rolling her eyes, ""Let's face it, lunch will be the highlight of the day.""

I can't imagine anything less likely to endear a restaurant owner to her town.

She all but calls her employees hicks, explaining that no one in the area has ever eaten in a good restaurant, so everything, from wine to service to food to presentation, must be taught from scratch.

She doesn't spare her friends; a pastry chef comes to help make strawberry shortcake and Vivian announces that her cake isn't as nice as Vivian's. Even if she's teasing, I thought it was a bit rude to a guest.

She makes fun of her diners' food choices, grumbling at being forced to include steak on the menu. (By contrast, I was once eating an incredible meal at Elderberry House, in Oakhurst, CA, when a diner complained that he had no ketchup for his ""tater tots."" (pommes duchesse) Owner didn't miss a beat, apologized profusely, served the ketchup herself, and gave him a free glass of wine. That kind of service--ensuring that your customer has a superb dining experience, no matter what--is what fine dining is all about.)

Ultimately, there are some really nice sequences in each show, which is why I gave it three stars. It's a nice survey of North Carolina foods. I wish the producers had put more research into the foods being discussed, which all have remarkable histories and interesting chemistries.

This season is on Amazon Prime, so I'm viewing it for free. If I had to pay for it, probably would skip it, but at this price, it's a fair evening's entertainment.",1452038400,3,2322,4.79
6890735,5,B00QYZJDLC,Love the show I hope someday to go and visit! !! I cannot stop watching I am addicted!,1451347200,,86,3.8333333333333335
6890736,3,B00QYZJDLC,"I started watching this show with high hopes. I love the South and Vivian seems like a real person. At first I was okay with her little problems and her venting to the camera about being overwhelmed or upset or worried about a big meal. But then I noticed that the venting happens every week. At times she and her husband are at odds about running the restaurant, or the other one they now own. My take now - I'd like less venting, more cooking. It seems she may be in over her head.
  In addition, I didn't like seeing the turkeys being killed. Also, one week the main dish was a pig organ, not sure exactly which one, but I couldn't watch. Perhaps I'm squeamish. On the plus side, I like the visits with local farmers and the scenery.",1450569600,3,736,4.25

6890744,5,B00QYZJDLC,"I enjoy this series for many reasons.  #1 - it's not an uppity cooking show.  It's more of a welcoming, down home atmosphere.
I like the way Vivian uses local, fresh ingredients in 'her own take"" of unique recipes.  She visits local farms and works with others cooks in their own homes to experience and learn their way of cooking certain foods.  It's fun to hear the stories told from the different folks there.  I get ideas from some of the ingredients and the way she uses them - lol, especially enjoyed the moonshine show :)  It's nice to meet her family and friends and see how food connects them - and the value of being able to share meals like generations earlier did.  I really like hearing southern accents and seeing the different landscapes and changing seasons.  My kind of reality show <3",1448323200,2,802,4.520833333333333

I'm a Virginian, SW Virginia, and I can relate and would love to try her food.

She knows how to pronounce the words as a true Southern, except I will take exceptions w/ PECAN.  As my husband says, you use the bathroom in a pe-can!!! So its pe-con!",1444176000,,553,4.435643564356436

I was stuck after surgery with my foot up and happened upon this series, it is so interesting in terms of the food that they make but also the glimpse of another place and life and the characters that inhabit that small 'town' and the restaurant.  Watched hours at a stretch.",1440633600,,352,4.555555555555555

6890824,4,B00QYZJDLC,Well worth watching. Not your ordinary boring cooking show but rather a glimpse into the restaurant business startup with two displaced persons. Back to a little biddy town (probably at deaths door) in the coastal Carolina region with possibly little in their pockets but a whole lot of family probably with a few coins for support. Watching her organizational skills and her teaching abilities is a pleasure. I will have to get on line to see their menu I am curious to see the prices and how they fit with a limited in dollars and numbers customer base. On a personal level there are two just adorable children and an unbelievable amount of energy between her and one of the local farmers. The restaurant is written in my notebook as a must eat there.,1439596800,,753,4.626865671641791

6890827,5,B00QYZJDLC,This show manages to blend behind the scenes life at a restaurant with cooking lessons and a portrait of an all but unknown American region. It's far better than most food shows on TV. Excellent watching!,1439510400,,204,4.694444444444445

6890844,5,B00QYZJDLC,simply compelling.,1438300800,,18,8.5
6890845,4,B00QYZJDLC,"Basically, I enjoy this program -- I like the tales of local foods, how they're prepared and the different ways they can be enjoyed.  It's also fun to see some of the 'behind the scenes' stories involved in running a restaurant.  Some of the episodes have been really informative, like the one on buttermilk, how it's made, cultured and used.  Another one on heirloom tomatoes was also great, but in truth, I've enjoyed them all.

What I don't enjoy is how snippy Vivian is -- she routinely puts down her husband, her mother and her employees, and then publicly complains about how hard it is to get help!  Frankly, I'm not surprised.  I have no idea what she's paying, but it wouldn't be enough for most people to put up with that kind of a nasty, sniping, boss.

Just one example?  She was preparing a dessert with the help of a young female employee.  She introduced the girl, gave her name, and then said, ""(So-and-so) is temporarily our pastry chef"", adding, ""Our regular pastry chef is out on maternity leave.""  Then, after a few seconds, Vivian said,
""She'll be back soon --and thank God for that!""  During this, the camera focused on the face of the young girl as she worked, and you could just see her face fall.  Poor thing!  Did she really deserve to be humiliated like that?

Every program has Vivian making a few of these zingers, after which she laughs, hilariously.  Supposed to be funny, I guess, putting other people down.  And her poor husband? Let's put it this way:  I'm pretty sure that restaurant will survive longer than the marriage.",1438214400,,1557,4.6036363636363635

6890848,5,B00QYZJDLC,"I just happened on to this show last week ""A Chef's Life"" because I love to cook and enjoy cooking shows. Now my husband and I are hooked on the show. We watched all of Season 1 and will be so sad when we finish Season 2. Vivian is amazing. So creative, is who she is, and does everything to perfection. Her husband Ben is also very professional at his job in the restaurant and the wine shop. Both of them work as a team and get it done - no matter what transpires. There are usually some ""bumps"" in the road, but that's life for all of us if people would only be honest. Their twins, an adorable little girl and boy are so cute picking fruit etc. in the field at one of the farms the restaurant buys from. Vivian and Ben treat all the farmers with such respect and appreciate all that they grow and the freshness of everything they purchase for the restaurant. Fresh everything. In season, grown in the area, home town people and just a joy to watch. Love this show!!",1437955200,,969,4.18716577540107

6890859,5,B00QYZJDLC,"As a retired high school foods teacher, this type of show is right up my alley. This series is highly enjoyable to watch. Chefs are so hard working...so many challenges to balance with family, friends and 'me' time. Focusing on one ingredient at a time is exactly what we are given. Having watched both seasons now, I have learned a lot....very informative and genuine background on food, some humor and wit, and a look into the special life of a chef and her family but most importantly, into the life of one woman's passion.",1436745600,,526,4.6063829787234045

Born with that attitude, no doubt, of southern stock; she comes by it naturally. No one coaches her, much the pity. Now only on rare occasions when there is NOTHING else to watch, I tune her in; that is getting less, as my patience is exhausted.
I prefer to read, not her material. The good days of Julia Child or even today with Joanne Weir or Sarah, who connect with people.

I agree with her philosophy of including southern food traditions along with innovation in her restaurant's menu.  I love her visits to local southern farms to see how food is grown.  I love her visits with local characters (including her own mother's chicken with rice) to see how traditional southern recipes are prepared.  Her twins are adorable.
