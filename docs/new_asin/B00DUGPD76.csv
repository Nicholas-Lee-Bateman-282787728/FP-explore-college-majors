5856581,4,B00DUGPD76,"I enjoyed this a lot; there's not a great deal of gayness in the film, as I was expecting, but the story itself is a very intriguing one.  Never having lived in London, I don't know what the gangs there are like but if they're no different than the ones portrayed in this film, I'd say they were pretty horrifying.  You can smell the cigarette smoke and the expensive cologne on the 'DGM' guys.  The characters are all tangible and completely believable, usually interesting, and likeable.  The black muslim gal who plays Mo's ""eye apple"" is such a sweetheart and lord only knows why she's hanging around him; she's kinda angelic.  Rashid, despite bad choices in the past, has a head on his shoulders and a brain in his head and now that he's discovered himself, he'll do well in life.  Mo is not that interesting a character but it's not hard to empathize with him and your heart may even go out to him.  My favorite character is Said the photographer - he's done well in life but he's lonely despite the success.  Many guys are in the same boat; successful economically but love-starved.  So now life looks even better for him too. Why didn't I give it five stars?  It's a bit hard to follow at times and the accents are thick throughout.  The ending isn't very strong, either.  The writer/director is a newcomer and there are times when the storyline wanders and lacks focus.  But for a first effort, it's very good.  If she can do some more gay films, I'd definitely check them out.  And I agree with other reviews that a Rashid-Said sequel woule be interesting.",1401062400,4,1566,4.523131672597865
5856582,3,B00DUGPD76,"An interesting theme of culturally different immigrants desperately trying to survive in a hostile environment. The film is well acted, well shot but about 90% of the dialog is unintelligible and ruins the good intentions of the serious filmmakers. This film desperately needs subtitles.",1392163200,,287,5.545454545454546
5856583,4,B00DUGPD76,"This tells the story of two brothers Mo, the younger and Rashid (James Floyd who played Freddie Mercury in the TV biopic of Kenny Everett) they are both British but from Egyptian parents. As such they have been drawn to the local gangs that deal in drugs and guns and violence. They live in Hackney which has one of the most cluttered number of gangs any where in the UK like `London Fields', `Hoxton Boys' and `Legends of Stokie' to name but three. Kids actually come from outside the borough to take part in the real inter gang rivalry.

In the film the gang is a mixed bunch who call them selves `DMG' which is a code for `drugs, money and guns', that will fool the `Feds' guys!. They have full on youth swagger and macho lame sensibilities. Then Mo gets a bit too involved and Rashid wants to get out, but in between ignoring his girlfriend showing disrespect to his erstwhile `homies', he also develops a taste for more than what the gang has to offer, or will ever accept. Everything is then set up for a big head on collision.

This is actually not a bad effort, it is well acted, shot and directed, but some will be wanting sub titles when the `kidz' are talking all `street', so be warned. The story has one foot in reality but is not so far from the possible to be of at least some entertainment value. There is not much actual bedroom stuff here and the violence is realistic but far from gratuitous so nothing to frighten the horses or anything. Director Sally El Hosaini has done a pretty good job in this 111 minute film. It will not be for everyone so if you want a full on action fest then avoid this one completely, but if you like a semi, gritty Brit gang flick then this might well do.",1388880000,3,1704,4.305295950155763
5856584,3,B00DUGPD76,"This is supposed to be a gay movie right?  Well there are way too many scenes with the sniveling homophobic younger brother and his black girlfriend(?) whereas the focus should have been on ""My Brother the Devil"" & his gay lover. They are a perfect couple but the movie lacks passion or romance. The Devil  comes out of the closet so abruptly it appears that whole sections of the movie have been edited out disallowing his character a chance to develop. It was like the director was afraid to go gay ""all the way"".

Most of the gang action is lame and borrring!

The two brothers are drop dead gorgeous but need acting lessons while the the movie needs subtitles because British accents often make it hard to understand what the actors are saying.",1388793600,3,748,4.559701492537314
5856585,5,B00DUGPD76,I was so surprised at the final situation in this film.  Veryy well gone  I loved this movie very much,1384473600,,102,4.05
5856586,5,B00DUGPD76,"Often, even good movies have plots that are too familiar. Not with thiis picture. No chance you are going to think as you watch it: 'oh that old twist again.' ""My Brother the Devil"" is an original. Nor does it strain for uniqueness at the expense of credibility. The story is believable. James Floyd is brilliant as the older brother whose life is changed by the sudden violent finish of a friend before his eyes: What he had only known before as a fact, he now knows profoundly and viscerally: death is irrevocable. All that has made him an idol to his younger brother is put aside as he enters a different way of life and love.",1382745600,3,629,4.384615384615385
5856587,4,B00DUGPD76,"I saw this movie a few months ago in May at the E Street Landmark Theatre in Washington DC, and now notice that Amazon has it finally listed as a future DVD release.

""My Brother The Devil"" (2012 release from the UK; 110 min.) brings the story of two teenager brothers living in the socially and racially diverse (and charged) neighborhood of Hackney, London. The younger brother Mo (played by Fady Elsayed) worships his older brother Rashid (played by James Floyd). Rashid is a member of a teenage gang called DMG (which stands for ""drugs, money, guns""). Rashid does not want Mo to follow in his footsteps and instead is mapping out a better life for his younger brother. In the first half, we see Rashid making drug deliveries in and around the neighborhood, and at some point becoming involved in a fight with a rival gang, leading to tragic results. Then there is yet another significant turn in the movie involving Rashid, which I did not see coming at all and I will not reveal as it surely would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: writer-director Sally El Hosaini brings a gritty take on what it's like to be an ethnic youth growing up in London. This is not the London that tourists know! While there is a lot of tension throughout the movie, the actual violence that is shown on screen is kept to a surprising minimum, and that is just fine with me. As a complete aside, the movie plays of course in the authentic British (Hackney) accent, and as a result I had difficulty at times to understand the dialogue. But bottom line: if you are in the mood for a quality foreign movie that is MILES away from your standard Hollywood fare, ""My Brother The Devil"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1373414400,12,1759,4.563291139240507

5856598,1,B00DUGPD76,the name of the movie sounds great MY BROTHER THE DEVIL but the movie was a  waste of time with a poor ending,1423440000,,109,3.739130434782609
5856599,3,B00DUGPD76,"The movie is well done in terms of tone, mood/atmosphere, cinematography and performances. It's a little slow and unfocused, though there are moments of real tension. The younger of 2 siblings idolizes his street gangster criminal older brother until he learns the older has become involved with another man. The movie is not about the gay relationship, rather the perspective on one. An interesting perspective I took to question the who, what, when & where the ""devil"" is in all this. Observing some horrific violent criminal choices, the younger brother opts to out the other as a terrorist instead of gay. It's an interesting statement. The pace is uneven and editing is choppy especially in the final third of the film. Scenes become disconnected, unclear in their intent and a little confusing or out of place. The POV is inconsistent which I'd like to imagine is with the purpose of exhibiting the growing distance in the brother's relationship. Early on we know the elder, later we become focused on the younger and loose touch with the elder's. I thought it a good though really flawed movie that is evidence of some talented storytellers. Uptick to 3 stars for a unique perspective, quality production and talented players. Downtick to 3 for choppy editing, unclear focus that muddied the end, and pacing too slow for the content.",1422662400,,1340,4.96

5856607,4,B00DUGPD76,"Great movie.  I loved the way the movie progressed and built tension, I don't want to ruin the movie, but it definitely drew me in with character development.  There were times where I actually sat up and tensed up waiting to see what was going to happen.  Was someone going to die?  If so, who?  The story is great, not a lot of sex or nudity happening, which would normally bore me, but by the time I realized everyone was going to stay dressed, the story had already hooked me.  And I loved it.",1404432000,,497,4.23404255319149
8597925,5,B00DUGPD76,"Strong film about family loyalty, gang life, love, and homophobia. Ultimately, being gay is worse in some quarters than being a gang member or a terrorist. Rather bleak tone overall and violent in parts, but true to life and eye-opening. However, there is hope that lives will get better.",1504569600,,288,4.8979591836734695
8597926,4,B00DUGPD76,Good movie. Real life on the streets & how the younger brother will do anything to be like his older brother no matter what he has to do or danger he puts himself in. Reminds me of 2 brothers I use to know well.,1503705600,,211,3.8181818181818183
