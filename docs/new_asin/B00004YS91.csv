I loved watching this show on Sunday mornings & I still love watching it now.  It is every bit as good as the original, though sometimes in different ways.  The character animation wasn't as good as on the Mainframe shows, but it was serviceable and the spectacular fight scenes more than made up for it.  The voices that came back were just as good as they were 14 years ago, but some of the new voices are a little jarring.  Not bad in the least, just not as good as in the original (Peter Cullen is especially missed, as I thought he was the greatest narrator ever).  On the plus side, Billy West was a much better Pidge, & Tim Curry is a great Lotor, even if I consider his old voice more fitting of the character.  But this is definitely a worthy successor.

I spent years trying to find the video release of this cool series and now it's here. Though I am older and supoosedly wiser then I was when this series first aired, it is still my guilty pleasure to curl up on my couch and watch this tape over again. I recommend it all who enjoy not only like voltron but just like good well-thought out short TV series. It's a classic I enjoy and I'm sure others will to.",1119830400,,517,4.128712871287129
