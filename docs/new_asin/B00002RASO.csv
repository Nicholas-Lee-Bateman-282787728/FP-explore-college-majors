1255979,4,B00002RASO,"Don't listen to any claims made made for Bullet For A General, Django is without a doubt the best non-Leone spaghetti Western of all time.  The opening scene (blue-clad Nero carrying a saddle over his shoulder and dragging a coffin through the gooiest mud in film history)is beautiful.  Corbucci's direction is more controlled here than anywhere else--less zooms, less jarring close-ups, and neater editing.  And Django has to be one of the first action heroes to fire a heavy machine gun from the hip (without even pulling the trigger, no less!).
But make no mistake.  This is Italian exploitation--love it or hate it.  An ear is cut off, prostitutes fight in the mud, and our hero's hands are crushed in gory detail that would make One-Eyed Jacks mumble in disgust.  Don't expect John Ford here.  But if you're looking for something different, are curious about spaghetti Westerns but afraid to buy any because so many are horrible--then this is the movie for you!",1000771200,87,966,4.889570552147239
1255980,4,B00002RASO,"Even though I gave this movie four stars (for originality and for its contribution to the genre),with a bigger budget(a Leone/Morricone kind of treatment),better dialogue (the dub-job was,quite frankly,abyssmal)and some fine tuning on the plot,this movie could have been the greatest western of all time. The opening scene where this mysterious stranger (Django)is dragging this coffin through the mud and its contrast against the sentimental crooning of the opening music is,possibly,one of the weirdest visuals I've ever seen in a movie,let alone a western. There are a couple of stomach turningly violent scenes that I did not care for and the body count is probably comparable to ""the matrix""....I don't know what all to say...This is one weird,gloomy,gothic,machine gun,spaghetti western. The addition of the trailer and the Franco Nero interview were nice bonuses.",993513600,2,870,5.548872180451128
1255981,5,B00002RASO,"I am not too fond of westerns. I only enjoyed the westerns of Terence Hill and Bud Spencer until I saw Sergio Corbucci's ""DJANGO"". He is a mysterious stranger who enters the town dragging a coffin and riding no horse. He's the guy everyone loves to hate, seeing that he's quick with his gun. This movie is very gory & violent, so watch it if you can stomach it. It's no wonder why it was banned in many countires! Strongly recomended, I rank ""DJANGO"" one of the best westerns along with ""MY NAME IS NOBODY"", ""ACE HIGH"" and ""THEY CALL ME TRINITY"".",974937600,5,546,4.362745098039215

1256094,3,B00002RASO,"It's worth seeing once, maybe twice. The extras, where there's an interview with people who made / were in this movie is of particular interest. Basically hearing Franco Nero talk about making this and how he got cast is worth getting the movie. Whereas Clint Eastwood is no kidding really good at drawing a pistol (an 1851 Navy Colt no less!), Franco would probably be better suited to rolling up some spicy meatballs. Or perhaps schmoozing with some pretty ladies poolside. So they had to ugly up the guy a bit to get him to look like he's right for the roll. Eastwood? They just told him to put the razor down and put on some dirty clothes.

As for the movie, not much to it. The violence is ok, pretty good in some parts. Django's gunfight scenes are hilarious. Again, Nero didn't know one end of a pistol from the other. So the editing is fantastically hilarious. It's kind of brilliant, actually. Anything pivotal that happens (most of which is killing) happens so quick it's damn near unique to this movie.

The theme song is rad. I bought it. I read there is going to be another Django (there are TONS of them) coming out in 2015 and includes Franco Nero. Thrilled. As for this one.. meh.. worth seeing once, maybe a second time in a year or so.",1441670400,,1253,4.443478260869565

1256116,5,B00002RASO,"...makes a different Western. Where Sergio Leone gets all the recognition for films like FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY and OUATITW, The ""other"" Sergio, Corbucci (not to be confused with the OTHER other Sergio, Sergio Sollima) made this important and influential entry in the Spaghetti Western pantheon. How influential? Well, there were literally dozens of films after this one that added the name ""Django"" to the tile, even though they had nothing whatsoever to do with this film.

Where Leone's films are spectacular, surgical-tool clean masterpieces of pure design, pure STYLE and FEEL...this movie sees the muck and filth and blood and just puts out its arms and does the Nestea Plunge into it all. As a film, it shrieks out its low budget from the rooftops, it revels in its flawed script, and shamelessly declares itself as exploitation cinema. And because of all that, it makes you love it and never let it go. DJANGO's energy and excesses showcase its flaws, but its raw garage-punk sensibility simply sneers winningly and says ""So?"" It is no exaggeration to say there are images here that will haunt you - the bloody pistol grip propped on the grave marker, the coffin dragged through mud, a red scarf disappearing into quicksand - long after the DVD is back on your shelf. Where, btw, it probably won't gather much in the way of dust - this is one that earns repeat viewings. Bacalov's score is the perfect combination of ghost-town-revenge-western and nightmare circus music, and it fits DJANGO like a glove (a glove caked in mud and dried blood, with the fingertips cut off, natch).

I guess you can tell I like this one. You will too. It's tough not to like. The DVD from Blue Underground gives us a good presentation of Corbucci's classic, along with some nice extras and even an Easter egg. If all you know of Spaghetti Westerns is Leone's work, this is a fantastic jumping off point for exploring the rest of the Euro-western universe. The English dub is...okay, but I recommend the Italian dub, which is fa bene. In the original Italian, Django himself comes across as more of a bastard and less of a Western Hero type, which makes the unfolding events even more satisfying.",1399075200,,2213,4.775456919060052

1256130,3,B00002RASO,"Inspired by Sergio Leone's ""Man With No Name"" trilogy, another Italian Sergio (Corbucci) keeps the genre popular worldwide with this violent but fun film.  Starring a young (23) blue-eyed stud with a shortened name of Franco Nero, the movie is pretty simple and follows the Leone formula.

Django (Nero) walks throughout the film dragging a coffin behind him using an attached rope.  We don't know what happened to his normal transportation.  Filmed in Italy and Spain, the setting is the U. S. /Mexican border just after the Civil War.  Django is a former Union soldier (still wears the yellow striped pants) headed for a small town on the Mexican side.  Along the way he finds a woman who is being beaten by a handful of Mexicans.  After dispatching them quickly with his six-shooter, another group of horsemen arrive.  These are Americans but wear red scarves or hoods, suggesting an element of the Klan.  They suffer a fate similar to the Mexicans.

Django takes Maria (Loredana Nusciak) with him into town.  Django's goal is to avenge his wife who died at the hand of one of the equally evil group of bad guys.  Either the Mexican revolutionaries led by Gen. Rodriguez (Jose Bodalo) or more likely, the red KKK dudes and their leader Maj. Jackson (Eduardo Fajardo).  Jackson is so evil that he dispatches young Mexicans one at a time to run up a hill, before shooting them with his rifle as target practice.  While Django is adept with his handgun, he only has one and it only has six bullets.  So to everyone's surprise he invites Jackson to bring his 40 member gang into town for a final shootout.  Naturally Django has a surprise waiting.

Corbucci who wrote the story as well as directed the film, is brutal with his confrontations.  Kids are killed, ears are severed and hands are crushed along with the unusually severe beatings.  Keeping with the times of 1966, it's not overly gory, but would surely earn an ""R"" rating, even today.  The film has plenty of logic-distancing scenes as well as some continuity issues.  And there are some noticeable blunders that might leaving one shaking their head.  Still, considering the budget and the scope, ""Django"" is a film worth seeing if you are a Western film aficionado.  ""Django"" continued on with several sequels and was fondly remembered by filmmaker Quinton Tarantino as evidenced by his 2012 film ""Django Unchained"" which featured a brief cameo by Nero.

The Blu ray adaptation has some problems but is overall well done.  The film begins with an optional introduction by Nero and the following disclaimer: The print used was ""transferred from its original camera negative, which contained some intermittent age-related damage.""  And yes, it's pretty evident.  There are a couple incidents of a pause between scenes.  In other cases, the picture fluctuates from scene to scene.  There is some unusually heavy grain in evidence in some frames.  Having said all that, at least they told us.  And in reality, most of the film looks very good.  Excellent color, good detail and contrast.

I wasn't exactly thrilled with the audio either.  We get two DTS-HD Master Audio Mono (1.0) tracks.  One is in the original Italian with English subtitles.  The other is an English dubbed version.  I watched the dubbed version for a few minutes but didn't like Nero's voice actor.  It also seemed like the translation didn't always make sense.  This was verified when I went over to the Italian and the subtitles were in fact different.  Neither audio version is all that strong in either case.  The film begs for a more immersive track.  Subtitles include English, English SDH, French and Spanish.

Extras include an interview with Nero and asst. director Ruggero Deodato, a 10 minute film starring Nero called  'The Last Pistolero.'  There is also a 1968 documentary featuring several filmmakers about the ""Spaghetti Western Phenomenon.""",1381795200,3,3885,4.918335901386749

Go back, read that sentence again. I've tried to watch this thing five or six times and just give up around the 15 or 20 min mark everytime. And yes, I've checked later chapters, and the image never improves. After viewing the last Django BU DVD release - which I recommend btw (see, I'm NOT a Blue Underground hater), I'd say that the problem may well lie (is that correct grammar?) with the film elements themselves. Some movies just weren't meant to be seen in the over-cranked blu format...or maybe it's the mastering equipment...I dunno. All I can say is that I wanted to fall in love with this disc and...I just can't. No quibs with the actual film itself. Stone classic. And maybe I'm expecting too much - nah! This disc falls flat on every level. If you've seen the Tarantino tribute film thingy, you know how good the theme song can sound. The sound on this disc is ""true to original"" but it's still mono, flat and slightly distorted. I know, I know - that's the way it was supposed to sound.

1256156,4,B00002RASO,"In 1966 the spaghetti western, that is westerns made in Italy and Spain, was just starting to explode. A different kind of western than was made in Hollywood, it wasn't just a cheap imitation as was dismissed by critics at the time, but a wholly new genre that was a cultural mix of two different nations.
 One title that stands out among the rest is Sergio Corbucci's Django. A gothic anti-western that caught unsuspecting movie goers off guard in the 1960's. It is brutal, violent and full of various sorts of symbolism including a hefty dose of catholism, it is also very entertaining.
 Starring a then unknown 23 year-old named Franco Nero. It would catapult him to international stardom. As a wondering former Union soldier in the days following the American civil war, who drags a coffin behind him everywhere he goes, Nero makes an immediate and lasting impression.
 Best seen in the spiffy blu-ray from Blue Underground, or DVD if you don't have the option, with the movie's original Italian language and English subtitles. Not only does it give Nero back his voice (he was badly dubbed in the English version), but the dialogue resonates better, it doesn't sound quite as stiff and wooden.
 Hugely influencal at the time of it's release, there are said to be as many as sixty movies that somewhere in the world was released as a Django sequel. It's still being felt today as Quentin Tarantino's just released epic Django Unchained follows Takashi Miike's wonderfully warped Sukiyaki Western Django by about five years. There is also plans to see Nero reprise the role, he already did once in 1987's Django Strikes Again, in an upcoming film.
 Probably more of a curiosity as of right now. This is a solid Mediterranean revenge sagebrush adventure. You'll be able to see what influence it has had over the entire output of auteur filmmakers such as Tarantino and Miike.

1256165,1,B00002RASO,"I saw the rave reviews about DJANGO and wondered if the current DJANGO UNCHAINED was based on this film. Apparently, DJANGO caused such a stir in its day that the name was used in countless films having nothing to do with the original. I hadn't heard of this film and was ready for a spaghetti western. These campy spaghetti westerns were made famous by Sergio Leone and Sergio Corbucci. Filmed in Spain to mimic the old west with a cast of Italians and Spaniards along with possibly a famous American actor or two (as in Clint Eastwood), spaghetti westerns had a strong fan base.

A young up and coming actor whose long Italian name was shortened to Franco Nero stars as Django. Nero was only 23 at the time and was made to look older. Famously handsome, Nero seemed like a great choice as mystery man Django. One line from the DVDs cover art, tells it all, Django is a mysterious man ""dragging a coffin filled with chaos towards a destiny ruled by vengeance."" That description was as bad as the awful dubbing. The dialogue on this dubbed version was almost unbearable with voices that didn't seem to match the actor voices of actors like Franco Nero. Of course, that can be the fun of a spaghetti western so it can be overlooked.

As Django drags his coffin, he comes across a woman about to be tortured and killed by a gang of Americans. Next come the Mexicans. Everyone is out to kill Maria, but why?
Back in the near ghost town, we are introduced to the dismal saloon and its band of currently unemployed prostitutes. The war between the Mexicans and the Americans have turned the hamlet into a ghost town. It all gets confusing figuring out which Americans are bad and which are worse and it is the same with the Mexicans. DJANGO is filled with constant brutality and violence. A particularly unnerving scene has an American ""general"" using Mexican peasants as target practice. Absolutely awful. Now the Mexican peasants are obviously not affiliated with the Mexicans on horseback who want to get back to Mexico to fight the Mexican soldiers..or something like that. DJANGO seems to be willing to befriend the Mexican bad guys but is out to destroy the American bad guys.

If this sounds confusing, it certainly is. The story seems to be just thrown together to have a total as much violence as possible. It's amazing to read that this film is a classic. Apparently, it was never released theatrically in the US but was a huge hit in Europe. The film extras help with the history of DJANGO but it still doesn't save a bad movie from being so terrible.",1359849600,6,2557,4.590809628008753

1256188,3,B00002RASO,"Chances are if you're thinking of watching this you're a fan of Sergio Leone's films and the Italian western. That being the case, I'd recommend Django but suggest you manage your expectations.

First, the similarities with Leone. You see a lot of familiar faces from the Dollars films. There's also plenty of ingenious and well orchestrated violence with some very clever set pieces: the gun battle in the muddy town (overtones of WWI here?), the fist fight in the saloon where the camerawork is incredibly mobile, especially for the period. Plenty of the aesthetics are familiar too from the sound effects (the gun shot sound is exactly the same) to the sets which were designed by Carlo Simi (here credited as Giancarlo), though in the latter the differences creep in. Instead of the dust dry south-west, Django is set in the lush and wet mid-west.

However, many trademark aspects of Leone's film making are missing and here the comparisons are not favourable. The most obvious difference is that Django wasn't shot in Techniscope. It makes a huge difference to the look and feel of the film. Also absent is Leone's appreciation of grotesque physiognomy. The other sorely missed element is that the score wasn't written by Morricone. It's impossible to stress what a difference this makes. Even Morricone's less successful music, say in Once upon a time the Revolution, adds a cohesion and mood to Leone's films that is unique. That said the title track of Django is a winner!

What about Corbucci in his own right? He certainly has some moments, from the opening sequence where Django is dragging a coffin through the wilderness, to the moment when he reveals its contents and when the `red masks' invade town. Franco Nero isn't Clint Eastwood but does brings a silent charisma to the part.

Django is a must see for fans of the spaghetti western but it's very much second league in comparison to Leone - which maybe an unfair comparison. A huge number of sequels were made, though only one 'official one' (in the late 70s if I recall) though I suggest these are left to the aficionados only! 3.5 stars.",1339372800,2,2108,4.814917127071824

I moved on and began watching as many other spaghetti westerns as I could get my hands on.  Eventually I stumbled across one of Sergio Corbucci's other films 'The Great Silence'.  I was floored.  I decided to give Django another shot.

When viewed outside the lens of Leone films and measured by it's own merits, Django is a fantastic film, and one of the great Spaghetti Westerns.

It has everything a red blooded man needs in a movie.  It's smart, violent, and slightly cheesy at times (something tells me it's not as bad in italian). And if you are a Quentin Tarantino fan as am I, you'll quickly notice just how much this movie and the genre inspired him.

Even the scenery, which normally delivers a heaping portion of a western's aura and mystique, falls flat in Django. Here the wide-open promise of a broad, sweeping landscape is reduced to dreary patch of mud, a fistful of thin, trail-weary horses and four pathetic, lifeless wooden shacks. If a steady diet of ricocheting bullets, heavy drinking and utterly pointless double-crossery is what you're hungry for, by all means chow down - this is ninety solid minutes of just that with little variation.

Towns were ruled by gangs of thugs who had more guns than the towns. Django came in a reluctantly saved what was left of the town.

1256195,4,B00002RASO,"Django stands out as an early spaghetti western that helped establish the tone and themes of the genre. In fact the film became so popular that studios started slapping the name Django onto all of their westerns, which resulted in hundreds of unofficial sequels that really had nothing to do with the original Django. Franco Nero inhabits the iconic titular character who manages to match Clint Eastwood's disquietingly monosyllabic man-with-no-name character. The plot borrows elements from A Fist Full of Dollars (which in turn borrowed elements for Kurosawa's Yojimbo, which in turn borrowed elements from Dashiell Hammett's novel, Red Harvest). I won't hold the fact that Django is a twice told tale against it, since most of these films trade in homage and bricolage anyway and because director Sergio Corbucci brings an economic style that marks the film has wholly his own.

Early in the movie, the titular hero, Django, who appears to drag a coffin with him wherever he goes, saves a woman, Maria, from being flogged to death at the hands of an unruly mob. He brings her back with him to a nearby town that is nearly abandoned except, naturally, for a whorehouse, which happens to employ Maria. The residents of the town have been trapped between two warring factions, a rogue contingent of the Mexican army and a gang of Southern white supremacists. Django appears disinterested in these small town politics at first--a position reinforced by Nero's minimalist performance--but we eventually come to understand that Django carries around more baggage than that old coffin.

As for what is inside the coffin, I won't ruin the surprise, although the trope has been borrowed often, specifically in the space-western anime, Trigun, that you likely have a good guess already. I will say, however, that the item in question becomes an all purpose device, serving as means for Django to carve a way out of a corner he has trapped himself in and, later on, as a macguffin to drive the plot forward. Of the two gangs, the ex-Confederate, white supremacists are the most menacing. These men wear red, pointed hoods that are obviously reminiscent of the KKK and capture and release Mexican farmers so that they can shoot them down like pheasants. Naturally, they don't take kindly to the Django's Union uniform.

The film itself is decidedly low rent. We are told that the town Django stumbles into is deserted because of the warring gangs, but most audiences know that the town is deserted because extras cost money. Unlike some of Sergio Leone's westerns, Django doesn't transcend the genre (it's less Raiders of the Lost Ark and more The Rocketeer). At times the commanding score by Luis Bacalov appears to be the only thing keeping the flimsy sets standing. And yet it's impossible to hold all of the films B-movie trappings against it, and not only because the filmmakers do a tremendous job with so little. One of the joys of the spaghetti western is that the genre has been emptied out. All of the weight of American myth, the trappings of manifest destiny, the world wearied job of nation building, have been dropped in favor of the truly essential elements of the genre, and then the filmmakers proceeded to push these elements to the breaking point. Unlike John Wayne and John Ford who became responsible for galvanizing the country around symbols of America, Carbucci and Leone had no such responsibilities. They saw the western genre for what it was: a fiction. They have not lied to themselves that these stories are anything other than movies removed by centuries, an ocean, and a few tropes from their source material. Spaghetti westerns are less concerned with the American west than they are with American movies.

I suppose this is why spaghetti westerns have captured the imagination of contemporary filmmakers like Tarantino, Takeshi Miike, and Jee-Woon Kim. Spaghetti westerns are movies about movies, the sort of meta-narratives that appeal to film nerds who have consumed the entire repertoire of whole directors. It is also the reason why Django feels light footed, making its way from scene to scene without the burden of history. It is also why, as much as I love some of the work by Ford and Hawks, when it comes to stories about stoic men with a fast draw, I'll take Leone, Carbucci, Eastwood, and Nero every time.",1305763200,,4340,4.93296853625171

1256197,4,B00002RASO,"Disclaimer: I watched this film as a streaming rental, and cannot comment on the package details of the product offered on this page.  My review concerns the entertainment value of the film only.

This VHS version probably tallies closest with the version I saw streaming, as I was forced to watch it dubbed, and even though I eventually got used to the actor's voice who substituted for Franco Nero, I thought it was exremely distracting and took a great deal away from the film.  Apparently there are now new transfers, in both blu-ray and regular DVD with alternate tracks that contain Nero's own voice, which I hope to find under the tree this Christmas.  But even dubbed, this is a must see for fans of Italian Westerns, a flawed classic with crazy imperfections that just don't matter.

This film is over-the-top from the very start, with Nero walking through boot-top-high mud as the opening credits roll, dragging a coffin behind him.  If you don't have a good guess at what's really in the coffin, then you just haven't seen enough Italian westerns, at least Sergio Corbucci style.  Next, the man we eventually learn is Django interupts the attractive (what else?) Loredana Nusciak as she is falling out the frying pan of getting flogged by Mexican Bandits, and into the fire of a private army of Southern marauders who intend to burn her alive.  Rescuing her puts Django in between these two forces which are battling one another for supremacy in the area - but despite the similarity in the beginning to 'For a Few Dollars More' (released a year earlier), 'Django' departs radically from Leone's film into its own bull-in-a-china-shop brand of storytelling.

Turns out Django has a private grievance with the leader of the Southerners, Major Jackson, and a previous friendship with the self styled general of the bandits, General Rodriquez.  Together, Django and the general plot against Major Jackson, and cook up a plan to rob a ton of gold from both Jackson and the Mexican Army.  I thought it would be interesting to see if I could keep track of the body count in this film, and though I was able to score the first few scenes, my mental arithmetic petered out around 55 or so, which is well before Django and his bandit friends even assault the Federales garrison, and before the eventual, inevitable falling out between Django and the General.

All the hallmarks of the genre are here - crosses and double-crosses, high body counts and the impression that human life isn't worth spit, impossible gunplay, sneering bandits with bad teeth, quicksand, machine guns, an iconic finale, and of course the horrible, Christ-like torture of the main character before he redeems everyone's soul with hot lead.  I don't think there's really anything more one could ask for in a picture like this.

Obviously this film is going to appeal to Italian western fans, and quite possible NOT appeal to American western fans - I think there are elements within these two genres that are often diametrically opposed to one another.  Regardless, if you are not a fan of this type of film, it's doubtful that 'Django' is going to win you over.  If, however, you have enjoyed Spaghetti Westerns before but have not seen 'Django', then I highly recommend it - though I would consider watching the updated version, either in blu-ray or in the regular edition.  I thought the biggest drawback to the film was the dubbed voices, especially Nero's, and I'm excited to watch it as it was originally filmed.  But even in this dubbed, slightly washed out version, I'd still rank 'Django' on the same level as 'Duck You Sucker', and much better than 'Fistful of Dollars' and 'A Few Dollars More'.  A genre classic.",1290211200,,3699,4.815165876777251
1256198,3,B00002RASO,"""DJANGO! Have you always been alone? Have you never loved again?"" These ridicules lyrics open up Django--a film directed by ""the other Sergio"", Sergio Corbucci. Released in 1966, Django starred Franco Nero and went on to spawn over 100 imitators (though according to the Spaghetti Western Database there is only one sequel, Django 2: il grande ritorno AKA Django Strikes Again). Even recent films such as Takeshi Miike's Sukiyaki Western Django feature the Django name. Upon its release, Django was considered to be one of the most violent films ever made, most notably due to a scene where an ear is severed. In countries such as Sweden, it was actually banned!

The Story: Django is a quite a sight to see. The man (who has a striking resemblance to Clint Eastwood and happens to act much like the character from the Dollars trilogy) slowly drags a coffin behind that contains a machine gun. He stumbles upon a racist group lead by Major Jackson and saves a young woman named Maria from being killed. Because of this, Django becomes involved in the major events effecting the local mucky town. But there is more than meets the eye to the quite man who has a purpose.

For the most part, the video quality is so-so but there are spots where the video certainly looks even more dated. The original Italian track is thankfully presented here as well as a (pretty badly done) English dub. Both are Dolby Digital 2.0. The documentary portion has a really neat interview with Franco Nero as well as various people who worked on the film. It's interesting, especially for those of us who are fans of the genera.

THE CONCLUSION:
In my opinion, no Spaghetti Western's are as good as Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy. While there's usually some unique and often times charming elements to be found in them, they are typically B level movies at best. Django falls into this B-movie category. The idea of storing a machine gun inside of a coffin that a guy slowly drags behind himself is a pretty cool one and I can fully understand why back in the 1960's this film was so successful. The dark, quite atmosphere is certainly nifty. That being said, compared to Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy, Django's world feels very small. It's a film worth watching but the plot and pacing are perhaps something that a 12-year old boy would enjoy more than an adult.",1289692800,2,2342,4.721271393643032
1256199,5,B00002RASO,"Previously released in multiple DVD editions by both Anchor Bay and Blue Underground, the latter company now brings Sergio Corbucci's seminal Spaghetti Western DJANGO (1966) to high definition Blu-Ray disc.

A man on foot wearing a tattered Union uniform and dragging a coffin behind him (Franco Nero, ENTER THE NINJA) comes upon a bunch of rowdies whipping a woman. Watching from a distance, the man, Django, does not interfere. But when the rowdies are gunned down by a second group of men with red hoods, and they prepare to burn the girl to death on a makeshift cross, he unleashes the fury of his Colts and soon finds himself caught up in a conflict between an army of white supremacists and a group of Mexican banditos. But what are the mysterious gunslinger's true motives, and what's in that damned coffin?

Violent and brutal, DJANGO is a gothic drama of the American west (even though it was mostly shot in Spain), rich with colorful characters, memorable set-pieces and director Corbucci's (THE GREAT SILENCE, THE HELLBENDERS) unique visual style. Anchoring the film is Nero's star-making turn as the titular protagonist; handsome, tough and utterly convincing dealing death to all comers, even when the film pushes the limits of credibility.

Not as well known in America as the Sergio Leone-directed EuroWesterns starring Clint Eastwood, DJANGO, was, arguably, even more popular and influential with continental audiences. So much so, in fact, that countless unauthorized/unofficial ""sequels"" were released throughout the the rest of the Sixties, and most of Nero's later movies -whether Westerns or not - ended up being marketed across Europe as DJANGO films.

Blue Underground's hi-def reissue is gorgeous, with a 1.66:1 widescreen transfer from the original negative at 1080p definition. There are rare occurrences of minor age-related wear and damage throughout, but otherwise the image is amazing. Audio options include the original Italian soundtrack in DTS-HD Mono or the English language dub in DTS-HD. Optional English subtitles are included.

For extras, Blue Underground has ported over all the features from its two-disc special edition DVD release, with a great new addition. There's a Franco Nero introduction, a short retrospective featurette called DJANGO: THE ONE AND ONLY that includes interviews with Nero and Assistant Director Ruggero Deodato, a short film starring Nero called THE LAST PISTOLERO, and the international and Italian trailers for the film.

New to this Blu-Ray edition is the vintage 1968 documentary, WESTERN, ITALIAN STYLE, which explored the Spaghetti Western phenomenon while it was still going on, and includes interviews with Corbucci along with other genre masters, like Enzo G. Castellari (ANY GUN CAN PLAY, THE INGLORIOUS BASTARDS) and Sergio Sollima (THE BIG GUNDOWN).

DJANGO is one of the great Spaghetti Westerns, and Blue Underground's new Blu-Ray edition is the definitive home video version. Highly recommended!",1280880000,10,2976,5.373390557939914

""Django"" on blu-ray features a transfer which appears far superior to the recent ""Man With No Name"" trilogy blu-ray collection.  It is clean, colors are rich, and the image is stable throughout.  The sound is also well balanced and clear.  If you know the film, the purchase is an easy one.  If you have never seen ""Django"", this is the best the film has ever looked in a home format and is required viewing for genre fans.

1256202,2,B00002RASO,"There's a note before the film begins that the original negative was badly damaged in some sections of the film and that one should try to enjoy it anyway. It seemed to me that throughout most of the movie, there was such an incredibly high level of grain that it caused a very drastic shimmer effect. It was extremely distracting. If this is the best they could do, they really shouldn't have bothered at all in my opinion.

As for the movie itself, I'm sorry to say I was disappointed in that as well. It was many years ago that I first heard of Django, back when the Thrones were covering the Django theme song. I asked them where it was from, and they described what sounded like one of the coolest spaghetti westerns ever made, starring an awesome antihero who drags around a coffin with a Gatling gun concealed within. That was about 15 years ago. I suppose there was no way anything could live up to high expectations that lasted that long. As far as I'm concerned, it's one of the downright *silliest* spaghetti westerns ever made. I tried to convince myself that it was intentional tongue-in-cheek parody... but I really don't think that's the case. I could easily see Mystery Science Theater 3000 giving it a highly deserved send-up. Quite surprising considering what I'd heard about it over the years.

Django is not up to par with the Dollars trilogy or Once Upon a Time in the West but is nevertheless recommended for any true fan of the genre.

It's all about excess; excessive violence, excessive fire power, excessive villainy, excessive machismo, etc.

The direction is good, the acting is passable, the music is great. If you're a fan of this sort of movie you owe it to yourself to see it at least once. If youve seen the Leone/Eastwood films and are looking for a good place to start exploring the Italian Western, this movie will serve, but I would suggest Sergio Corbucci's The Great Silence or The Hellbenders, as I think they are better films on the whole.

1256205,5,B00002RASO,"A 1966 release directed by the legendary Sergio Corbucci, Django features Franco Nero as the title character in one of the greatest of the spaghetti western genre. The main character was adapted from a comic book anti-hero who drags a mysterious coffin behind him in search of answers and more importantly, revenge. Django, follows suit with other movies of its likeness, mainly the Leone ""Dollars"" films and yet it mixes its own twists and contributions that lend something to later films like Sabata and the Sartana trilogy. While few similarities can be traced from this film to the unofficial 30+ sequels, Django and its influence can be seen in other outlets like the video games Boktai, Gungrave and Red Dead Revolver, the music of Rancid, the anime series Cowboy Bebop and of course, the ""ear scene"" from Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs. While the English dubbing does take away some of the style and feel of both the dialogue and the soundtrack, the movie itself stands alone as a premiere example of a spaghetti western in a time when the genre was really coming into its own and earning a place in cinema history.
Bandits, renegades, stolen gold, a fatal love, a corrupt general, a mysterious stranger dragging a coffin around... this one has it all! Fans of the man with no name films might disagree, but I say add this to the top of your ""must watch"" list.",1255737600,,1371,4.764705882352941

All while dragging a coffin behind him, for reasons unknown to someone who's never seen the film.

I actually like this one way more than A Fistful of Dollars. Franco Nero as Django is just as awesome as Clint Eastwood in any of his ""Dollars"" roles. The music also spectacular and just as good as anything Morricone ever did. If you've ever even HEARD of this film, then you should just flat out order it RIGHT NOW.

By the way, this DVD presentation is excellent, and while a few frames are dirty, it's still the best way to see this film and doesn't hamper it at all.

The film has a very flimsy plot, but if that's what you're after then a spaghetti western isn't what you should be looking for.  It does however excel in most other ways, the editing, photography, way over the top style and even the performances are decent.  Franco Nero's tough-and-silent-type charisma has rarely been as effective.  This may be the least political of Sergio Corbucci's spaghetti westerns and that is in some ways good and some ways bad (ie making it perhaps more accessible to a mainstream audience, but perhaps making it slightly more shallow at the same time).

Blue underground's dvd is excellent.  The transfer is great and you rarely see a 1.66 AR film with a proper anamorphic release but this has it down perfectly.  It also has the Italian soundtrack, which is a big plus as the dialogue (what little there is of it) is marginally better than the English.  Other extras are fine all round.  Word of warning though, the extra disc is a mini-dvd and contains a brilliant short with Franco Nero.

Highly recommended for (spaghetti) western fans especially, but also for anyone with an interest in the World Cinema explosion of the 60's and cult films.

I also like Franco Nero after being exposed to him the first time in the movie The Salamander. I was looking up some info on Franco and I came across some info on his movies and read about Django. Many said that it was equal to the Leone westerns and that it was darker and more brutal. After watching it, and enjoying Django, I must say that I don't think that it is on par with any of the Leone westerns. That is not to say that it is not good though. When you consider that most of the time they didn't even have a script and that they improvised the script most of the time, it is a pretty entertaining movie. The cast of characters is really good and like Leone the faces that he comes up with to play the parts are all interesting. It is a down and dirty western with lots of mud, dirt, and plenty of really over the top violence including an ear scene that inspired Quenting Tarrentino to film his scene in Resevoir Dogs. The gun play is also cool and Django himself is one cool dude.

This movie of course is dumbed in English. Unlike the Leone westerns I don't think there are any English speaking actors. Nero is dubbed and the guy has the typical hero voice but it is ok (not great and if it was redone I would love to have somebody else dubbed in or Nero himself).

1256221,3,B00002RASO,"I grew up with and loved Sergio Leone's ""Man with No Name"" trilogy with Clint Eastwood. I tend to love Italian pictures (horror and otherwise) and recently having watched Leone's trilogy again, I decided to quench my Spaghetti Western thirst by purchasing a number of now rather unseen ""classics"" that Leone's films inspired.

Of all the Spaghetti Westerns I purchased the film Django was one of the best. Does that make it a great film? Oh hell no. Django, released in 1966 was one of the first films to be ""inspired"" (ah-hem...Rip-off) Leone's Fistful of Dollars. The film molds itself along the same lines as that film. A loner anti-heroic cowboy (played by Italian B-great Franco Nero) travels to a remote, dying western town and ends up fighting two rival bands, a Mexican rag-tag army and an American rag-tag army. As you can tell from the story...it was majorly influenced by the much much better Leone picture. Not only the story, but the appearance of Franco Nero himself is a direct take-off of Clint Eastwood's character. The actor that dubs the voice for the English release even does his best to do a Clint Eastwood impression...an impression that only really induces laughter.

The film tries to be another Fistful of Dollars but it doesn't come close to Leone's grand low-budget feature. The reason why is that this film suffers from some poor acting and some majorly poor dialogue. The bad dialogue could just be the fact of bad translating but some of the lines Nero spouts off are just hilarious! The plot also has some weird aspects such as how Django drags a coffin around. I won't tell what he keeps in the coffin (as it is a nice plot device) but I just found it thigh-slapping funny how this guy drags a coffin around wherever he goes! That would get really old after walking hundreds of miles! What's so great as they take this ridiculous plot device seriously! The directing on the other hand is typical Italian greatness. Sergio Corbucci has a real eye for making the camera shots interesting. He would prove to be the master of the genre (right after Leone) with his great films The Great Silence and Companeros...both of which are FAR better than Django when it comes to quality.

Though Django has many problems it doesn't mean it isn't entertaining. I had a great time with this cheesy spaghetti western that took itself a little too seriously. If you go into this expecting another ""Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" then your going to be sourly disappointed. But if you go into this expecting a nice little cheeseball spaghetti western that delivers on the entertainment value, then you will find it much to your liking.

As for the DVD Blue-Underground does another fantastic job at reasserting a long forgotten film. However, it should be warned, that Blue-Underground used the original uncut negative of the film and some of the scenes were damaged because of age. This could put off some people of but for viewers like me, we are just glad to the UNCUT version available in all its bloody glory. This includes an awesomely gruesome ""ear cutting"" scene. Being a huge fan of Italian horror cinema with the likes of Dario Argento and Lucio Fulci, I get a kick out of these controversial violent gore scenes. Thanks blue-Underground!

The limited edition that I got comes with a bonus disc that features a Franco Nero western film short on one of those little mini-DVDs. The bonus film is under 10 minutes, features no talking making it basically a way for the director to show off style. It's good for a one-time watcher as most probably won't stick it into their DVD player after viewing it the first time.

On a side note I love how Django was so popular that it inspired 50 unofficial sequels? Over 50?! That's unheard of. I know Italy is known for making lots of unrelated ""unofficial"" sequels (as in the case of Dawn of the Dead) but over 50 is just incredible! Of all the ""sequels"" there is only one official one made in 1987 called Django Strikes Again starring Franco Nero (haven't seen it yet but soon will). Blue-Underground released one of the ""unofficial"" sequels strangely titled Django Kill...if you live, Shoot! which I just ordered. One of my new goals in life to view every single one of the 50+ unofficial sequels to Django. Hell, I might even name my kid Django. Oh my God Django...what have you done to me?!

1256222,4,B00002RASO,"In Django a laconic anti-hero drags around a crucifix incrusted coffin with a little surprise inside. Django seems to be surrounded by more Christ symbolism then I can count including a death wielding crucifix in a grave yard showdown(with symbolic red rose bush and a Catholic prayer).
I assume Django must represent the vengeful Christ of Revelations. This is because as Christ figure Django certainly is not of the ""turn the other cheek"" variety.

Very unfortunately Franco Nero's understated anti-hero style of acting is completely ruined be thin Casper Milquetoast voice, hokey dialogue and flat sound in the English version of the film and the English version is the only one where the words seem to match the actors' mouths.  Djangos voice is far richer and fitting in the Italian dub of the film but now the words don't match the mouth. The sound effects and music and are far richer and natural in the Italian dub of the film too.

I found that the music score in Django by Luis Bacalovis is far better then average for a none-Ennio score but the opening Django song is cliched, bombastic and belongs to a much older conventional American western style and not a spaghetti. An Ennio Morricone-like opening piece of music is definitely missed.

Anchor Bay's DVD of Django looks and sounds only OK soI only recommend the Blue Underground Italian language version of Django as their print is the most pristine of all that I have seen. Their Italian version of the film is by far the richer and fuller. (although I did find it a bit odd watching a western dubbed in Italian where the mouths don't match the words.)

I'd give Anchor Bay's bland English version of Django only 2 stars not for the orignal film but for the quality of the DVD print and sound.  But Blue Underground's beautiful clear Italian dubbed version rates 4 stars.",1133136000,5,1838,4.746081504702194

I'd have to rank it just a notch below Leone's ""A Fist Full of Dollars"" and nowhere close to Leone's other masterpieces (For a Few Dollars More, The Good The Bad and The Ugly, and Once Upon A Time in the West). This is mostly because it lacks the timeless qualities that the Leone classics have maintained over the decades..an atmospheric grittiness and realism that few films, western of otherwise have  been able to achieve.

Django is purhaps a slightly better than a average film. What has probably made it a cult classic is the violence in it that was shocking to film goers in the mid 1960's.

The first time I viewed Django, I was a little disappointed. But I the next time I viewed it, I made a point to look at it by transporting myself to a 1960's mindset.

Looking at the film this way made me see why this movie has been such a cult favorite. But it lacks the appeal to go beyond that.

If it did, it would most certainly be right up there with the Leone epics. but it falls far short...at least for me.

The detractors of Django are most likely looking at it with at least from a present day view point. From this view point the film may look like a jumbled unrealistic mess. You would be a lot less likely to get the same opinions from any of the Leone films.

One reviewer claimed Django mows down 100 or so bad guys with a machine gun that is neither cooled or reloaded, then he complains that they should have attacked at all directions. First Django only himself kills a few dozen or so with this weapon. And since neither guerilla not terrorist tactics were not perfected in those days, why would a few dozen men feel the need to sneak up a a lone gunman who they believe they out number.

The scene itself is realistic enough considering the exploits of Stallone's Rambo and Swarzenegger's antics.

Django is entertaining. But it doesn't quite hold up as a timeless masterpiece.",1122508800,5,2015,4.395161290322581
1256225,4,B00002RASO,"AWESOME!! Yes, the sound track is bla and it is obviously a low budget movie - but inspite of that it is one of the best westerns I ever saw. The violence might have been hard in the 60's, but everybody who can cope watching the Sopranos will have no problems with this film. After we viewed this film, my husband's first comment was:"" When  do you get another Django movie?"". Great entertainment!",1115856000,2,397,4.438356164383562
1256226,1,B00002RASO,"This is an overated film and I have heard that it was always great. Once I got around to renting it, I was sorely mislead, not only by all the hype this piece of junk got, but by the reviews, who wrote them anyways? If you watch the DVD extra on the making of the film, the actor talks about how they didn't have a script or money for most of the film, and I said to myself, ""that is why its so bad."" And truly, this is one bad piece of film making, played by bad actors, on bad, dirty sets on some abandoned Spanish/Italian back lot. The absurd plot puts Django, some half drunk injun carrying a loaded coffin with a 800 lb Maxim machine gun, which was used out of context in the film, because it never was cooled or ran out of bullets. He visits a sect of ""red hooded"" hooligans who look stupid with the red hoods as they shoot mexicans for fun. Okay, who wrote the script, a 12 year old? The Mexican bandits are even worse, they shoot anyone. There's a terrible scene where Djano shoots 120 of the red hooded bad guys without burning the barrel of the gun or running out of ammo, nice touch. In effect, this is a film without a basis, and the only thing remotely resembling interest is the young, blue eyed, non-English speaking early role of (Nero). Grade D.",1102723200,11,1262,4.197530864197531
1256227,5,B00002RASO,"I think most people who don't care much for this movie had been spoiled by Leone before watching it.  I mean, Leone really set the bar high for westerns and I don't think anyone has done it as good since.  He pretty much reinvented the western and set the rules.  Italian directors who followed in his wake were directors who usually did other kinds of films, but started doing westerns coz they were big bucks at the box office.  Django was the first of the non-Leone spaghetti westerns, and it's a great movie.  Sure, the budget shows and the acting isn't always the best, but I'm able to look past that.  The look of the film is unique-Instead of the blazing hot deserts, most of this film is cloudy and muddy(I know it was shot in winter and I think it takes place in winter as well), giving it it's own look.  Franco Nero is no Eastwood or Bronson, but he has the right stuff for the part and pulls it off nicely.  Very violent for 1966, but we've become so desensitized over the years that it won't have you gasping in shock.  It's still brutal enough though.  Lots of complaints about the soundtrack again.  Well, once again this isn't Leone, therefore the epic music isn't here either.  But I don't see how you can hear the theme song and not laugh.  You can just see Tom Jones singing this to a crowd of screaming women in Vegas.  Once again Blue Underground has given another forgotten film the best possible treatment it can have.  They give us an interview with Franco Nero and a very interesting short film with Nero as well.  And as always, Blue Underground gives us the original poster as the cover(I love how they do that with these old flicks!).  If you have any interest at all in westerns and have seen the Dollars trilogy too many times, you can't go wrong with Django-that is if you lower your expectations a tad.",1101600000,39,1834,4.410714285714286
1256228,4,B00002RASO,"This is a classic spaghetti western and an unforgettable film. Filmed on a low budget in the Spanish winter of 65/66, it shows an inventiveness and exuberance that takes the whole genre forward by the scruff of the neck. Hauntingly atmospheric, brilliantly designed and full of almost non-stop action, it repays endless viewings. A particular bonus with this release is the option of a subtitled Italian-language track, which means (a) that you don't have to listen to the awful English version and (b)you get a taste of the original script, which sometimes differs markedly from the dubbed version. The extras include enlightening interviews with Franco Nero and Ruggero Deodato, and a bonus 10-minute monochrome short (stylised and wordless) featuring Nero as an ageing gunslinger, which is worth a look. The main disappointment is the poor quality of some scenes due to the DVD being sourced from a damaged negative. According to the sleeve, this had been found in an Italian vault, ""untouched for three decades"" - but the British Film Institute was able to source a pristine version for the UK cinema and video release in 1991. Apart from that, full marks for presentation. If you want a lesson in how to make an action masterpiece on a shoestring budget then this is the film for you.",1099353600,20,1289,4.944700460829493
1256229,3,B00002RASO,"This DVD came with The Spaghetti Western Collection. I simply didn't relate to the characters as most others seem to have. My enjoyment of the movie was limited by the lack of what I felt was a thoughtful score. Maybe I'm so used to Ennio Morricone's moving scores, as they seem to fit movies like another character. I wasn't impressed with the composition by Luis Enriquez Bacalov, whose music starts the title off. I don't know, maybe I don't care for lyrics. I guess lyrics shouldn't be used if the story is well- told in the movie.
This movie is quite dark and opens to some intense beating of a woman. Django is also dragging a coffin through mud towards a bleak- looking town where havoc eventually fills the streets which were emptied by the numerous killings.
I would lie to give it 4 stars because the music to me detracts from the movie. And the English dubbing just adds to not help me identify with the characters like I'd enjoy. Other macaroni flicks have gotten me to feel something for the characters, but something was missing here. I couldn't even feel for the woman being tortured (Loredana Nusciak). Yet for a movie like The Good The Bad and The Ugly, I could even identify with Al Mulock's character at the very beginning (the bounty killer whose head fills the screen from a once- empty desert scene). I would give it a very average score and tack on just a smidgen more for the DVD quality presented by Blue Underground, which is consistent with the other nice presentations they have distributed.
Tech Specs and Easter Eggs: Region- free NTSC DVD from a 90- minute master print, in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.66:1 (only) and enhanced for 16X9; English mono and Italian mono with optional English subtitles; Django: The One and Only interviews; trailer; movie poster/production stills photos; linear notes; a two- page double- sided pamphlet with more detailed notes.

1256230,4,B00002RASO,"I'd heard lots about this film over the years but was unable to see it until a few years ago. It has the usual flaws of a spaghetti western (poor dubbing, choppy editting and almost silly lyrics for the title song), which are to be expected,and after having seen so many, are even endearing, but its quirkiness more than makes up for it. (Any film with the main character constantly dragging a coffin behind him in the mud has a certain deviant appeal.) Excepting the Leone westerns (which are so far above the ordinary Italian western that they are literally in a class by themselves), this is one of the best.",1017446400,6,611,4.513513513513513
1256231,1,B00002RASO,"I head a lot of good things about this -- comparisons to Leone's films and that it was so popular it spawned a horde of sequals. I had contemplated buying the Anchor Bay DVD, and upon viewing, I'm so glad I didn't. Franco Nero is absolutely dreadful -- i'm not sure if he or the dubbing is to blame but the delivery and dialogue are some of the worst I've ever witnessed. The character is such a goody goody with lines like, ""You shouldn't treat women like that"" and ""That's not right."" To compare this to Leone is to reduce Leone's interesting characters and cinematography into cardboard gunfights. I didn't even finish the film.",1006387200,8,631,4.543859649122807

I like spaghetti westerns and this one is filed with plenty of surprises and it's quite enjoyable for a spaghetti western fan.  If you ever heard about the TOP TEN reasons you might be a spaghetti western fan  joke which I read somewhere, a top ten list which mentioned you might be a fan and one of the reasons is . .  ""you're pulling a coffin through town"" well this movie answers the question one might ask about that joke as to why you'd be pulling one through town.  It's completely enjoyable as a fan of this style of movie and with enough surprises in it to be interesting  my old man who is quite elderly.

If you hate spaghetti westerns, well then you probably won't find this enjoyable, but this certainly although a budget movie is one of the great ones because it has enough dramatic surprises that will make a B-movie fan who likes this kind of stuff laugh or be surprised.  This is certainly not a feel good western but doesn't leave the viewer with a down feeling.  It's somewhat typical of this kind of style of C-movie budget film.

7916186,4,B00002RASO,"Just watched ""Django,"" for the first time. Pretty good, interesting movie. Django is definitely a man of mystery. Leaves you wondering: What was Django's true identity? I think there are a few clues to it: The woman he loved was buried in the local cemetery. Makes me think Django wasn't new to the town, it was his hometown, but anyone he knew, and who knew him had gone. A clue to this to me was at the beginning at the movie, when Jackson asked him if he was from the North, he answered, ""I FOUGHT for the North-""Not that he was from the North  Also, why would Jackson kill Django's wife(or lover)? My guess is she was Mexican, and he didn't like ""race-mixing."" I'm not able to help but to think he was killed quite brutally, and quite possibly Django found her dead. Anyone else get this impression? Also, think Jackson recognized Django from who he was before? Also, when he talked of ""burying Django,"" I know his machine gun was in that coffin, but I am not able to help but to think, he was also referring t the person he had become, and he didn't like who he had become, and he hoped somehow he could go back as much as possible, to who he was before. Seems to leave the individual viewer, to decide for themselves, weather Django, really was a bad guy. Also, where did Django  learn his skills?  In listening to the song, it seems to hint, that beneath everything, Django, is a very sad-grief-stricken, heart-broken man. Like he told Maria, ""Even you may not be able to help me forget."" Meaning he may have been in too much pain, to really get past the death, of the woman he loved. ""When the song, says, ""you loved her, and you lost her, forever, Django."" I wonder if they are referring to his dead wife/lover? I know he told Maria, he didn't save her, because of her, makes me wonder if she reminded him of the woman he loved? Think Maria died at the end? I think a backstory to Django would be interesting. I'm just interested in everyone's thoughts on this. Thanks.",1516492800,,1978,4.384196185286103
