5200644,3,B0090EDEQY,This was a really cute story and I've always loved Alicia Silverstone. My only complaint is that maybe it was too expensive?,1351123200,,124,4.681818181818182

5200646,3,B0090EDEQY,"Amy Heckerling's ""Clueless"" is such a touchstone film that I went into ""Vamps"" with high hopes.

It's a cute movie, with some funny moments. Alicia Silverstone shines in it. The characters are well written. The story, however, seems very small for the big screen. This seemed like something that could have been told in a TV episode, even. I kept waiting for something bigger to happen, and it just never did. The whole movie ended up feeling anticlimactic.

Sigourney Weaver's performance was so silly and over the top, it was a true shame. She made a crappy villain of the piece.

All in all, it was worth the price of renting it, but I won't bother seeing it again, nor will I add it to my permanent collection.",1350691200,2,714,4.5625
5200647,4,B0090EDEQY,This was a very well made film. It was funny and clever. It isn't the best film ever but its definitely worth watching a couple times. 3.5 stars.,1350604800,3,145,4.214285714285714
5200648,4,B0090EDEQY,"Amy Heckerling (Director of Fast Times At Ridgemont High, writer director of Clueless) may not have the best track record for helming good movies. She did write and direct both Look Who's Talking and Look Who's Talking Too, and those movies were awful. Vamps however, is not. I always love a movie with supernatural elements coming out around Halloween. While this is a less traditional and more modern approach to a Vampire movie, they don't reinvent the mythos like Twilight did with having Vampires walking around during the day...which is stupid. Krysten Ritter (Breaking Bad, She's Out Of My League) and Alicia Silverstone (Clueless, The Crush) star in this upbeat comedy about two socialite Vampire friends who start relationships and fall in love while being hunted by Vampire Hunters. There are some great cameos from Richard Lewis, Malcolm McDowell and Sigourney Weaver. The film is getting a very limited release on November 2nd, and you can own it on Blu-Ray on November 13th. Amy Heckerling may have made some bad movies, but she has also made some great movies like Fast Times At Ridgemont High and arguably Clueless and now Vamps. If you like movies like Once Bitten, or Vampires Kiss or other comedies about Vampires, or if you like Clueless, you'll enjoy this movie.",1349222400,13,1282,4.967441860465116

5200650,4,B0090EDEQY,"A cute, charming take on modern-day vampires: ageless Goody and the much more freshly-turned Stacy, a pair of sweet ""20-something"" vampires making their way in modern NYC.

If you're looking for something along the lines of The Vampire Diaries or Twilight, then this isn't for you. (If you didn't get that from the film's poster, I don't know what to say!) But if you've got a sense of humor about your vampires, and are looking for a fun and moderately campy vampire film, this chick flick is perfect.",1512432000,,502,4.704545454545454

5200660,3,B0090EDEQY,"Vamps is a quirky vampire movie. Vamps follows two vampires (played by Krysten Ritter and Alicia Silverstone) and how they live in New York. They work at night, go to school at night, and do various night time as vampires are want to do if they want to survive. The movie delves into some of the ol cliche's of vampirism, but adds just a touch of their own twist to them. You'll encounter Van Helsing, Renfield, Vlad, etc. Vamps is a movie to just veg out to and to not expect it to be a masterpiece. If you have an afternoon or night to kill then this movie will just do the trick.",1500336000,,582,4.15929203539823

5200706,3,B0090EDEQY,"In all honesty, I think this might be one of the cheesiest vampire flicks I've ever seen. I can't say I got much out of watching this movie except for a few of no-brain giggles here and there. That's not to say I don't appreciate this lighthearted parody for what it was. Even though I often found myself rolling my eyes at the antics of ditsy roommates, Goody (Alicia Silverstone) and Stacy (Krysten Ritter), these ""vegetarian"" vamps definitely have a certain charm. As the two have to continuously adapt to the ever changing fashion trends, technology, and romance in NYC, they find that being stuck in your 20s is not all what it's cracked up to be. Despite the corniness of it all, Vamps does have its positives, including a great cast and a creative storyline. I will warn viewers though: This is a total chick flick!",1419984000,3,822,4.598639455782313

Together they face challenges as trivial as where to get home town dirt for a coffin to as daunting as an IRS audit during the day. But when love and an unexpected pregnancy occurs will one make the ultimate sacrifice? Even though this film is rather recent (2012) it reminds me of the campy movies from the 80s.

5200729,2,B0090EDEQY,"There are so many vampire movies, TV series and other stuff that it did not hurt to see another one of those just before the Halloween.  In this film there are many famous actors: Alicia Silverstone, Richard Lewis, Kristen Johnson and most daringly so  Sigourney Weaver who make factastic sociopathic vampire.

Ina ny case two young women are vampires and they spend their life attending parties, sleeping with any guy they want and just having fun any minute they can.  Do not take it wrong - they are not bad girls - after all, they do not kill people.  When these two get hungry, they drink rats' blood.  So one day when one of them falls in love and the other runs into a man who was the only man she ever loved - they have to make a hard choice.  Do they continue their lives of a vampires and let their true lovesgo away - or do they become mortals again and give it all up for the men they love.

It is a silly movie that will be easily forgotten - except for Sigourney Weaver's performance that is just sublime.  Have fun, rent this movie, but I would not spend my money buying it.",1382832000,,1089,4.247572815533981

Now that I've watched the pilot and know the back story it's a pleasure! I am obsessed with Betty White's character! She has those same punchy and hilarious snips she did on Golden Girls but her character is smarter and sassier on this show and I love it.

I mean granted, its not Oscar worthy or going to go down in time as one of those incredible films, but the humor, sarcasm and light hearted tone are greatly enjoyable. Perhaps some people cannot vibe with the blunt somewhat twisted humor, but I loved it.

For a movie of this caliber, the story was actually fun and entertaining, despite being as campy and cheesy as it actually is. But what really made the movie work was the list of people credited to the cast; Alicia Silverstone, Krysten Ritter, Sigourney Weaver, Marilu Henner, Richard Lewis, Wallace Shawn and Malcolm McDowell.

When one is suddenly summoned for jury duty, the fear of being found out causes them to go on a quest that will change their lives forever. Great cast, Malcolm McDowell plays a supporting role. His character is fun. Wallace Shaun is wonderful in the role of the father of the love interest. Sigourney Weaver is fun in the master vampire role. The stories that interweave are sweet, and the movie leaves you feeling good. Totally not my normal style but I am glad I gave it a chance.

5200743,4,B0090EDEQY,"When we got this via 2-day rental I saw the cover, knew who both actresses were, but I didn't really think I would enjoy it. Before I continue let me just say that I rarely write a review on a movie with the exception of reviews regarding Blu ray quality. It was late at night and about 20 minutes into it my wife fell asleep and I paused it. Due to one thing or another we never got back to finish it before the 2 days were up, but that 20 minutes I saw convinced me to buy it, so I did.

When I hear two words ""Vampire"" and ""Comedy"" used to describe a movie I usually cringe because I haven't found many of them funny much less memorable. While Alicia Silverstone has aged a bit since ""Clueless"", it hardly showed, and this is probably the second best movie I've seen her in. It's one of those movies where if you're flipping through the channels and see this one, you'll stop and watch it from whatever point you caught it on.

It's a comedy - of course - but the story was actually very sweet, about a young woman who chooses being a vampire over dying and leaving her children orphaned.  This vampire later chooses to die to allow her friend's baby to live.  It has a strong buddy theme, a lot of subtle humor, and a few laugh out loud moments.  OK, it's another vampire movie when it there are so many of them.  Enough with the vampires already!  ...but, still, this was worth watching.

Wallace Shawn and Dan Stevens (""Downton Abbey"") as Dr. Van Helsing and his son, Joey Van Helsing:  good casting!

This film has the feel of a movie that was made up as they went along.  It's hard to imagine that this film got the green light with the story that's in the final product.

This movie is more witty, than funny. The comedy is more along the lines of ""Clueless"" but with the irony and social opinions of ""Idiocracy"".  If you were looking for flat out comedy then you should see ""Pitch Perfect"" or ""Bridesmaids"" instead. There are a few one liners in this movie that are brilliant, but over all unless you are familiar with the previous generations depicted in the movie or are 30 years or older then a lot of the jokes/tirades/opinions in the movie will have been confusing or go over your head. As someone who is 30+ I could relate to a lot of the opinions that Goody had about technology and ""progress"". I'm sure many others can as well.

5200782,4,B0090EDEQY,"Vamps is a chick flick. It would most likely get a five star review at a Taylor Swift concert. Alicia Silverstone and Krysten Ritter play two vampires in the modern dating era. Alicia dates back to the 1840's and has trouble adjusting to modern gadgets, while Krysten is at home with them. Both of the women develop love interests. Alicia meets an old boyfriend (Richard Lewis) from the 1960's while Krysten falls for a man named Van Helsing (Dan Stevens) who has a father who hunts vampires.

The Vamps are part of a support group who only drink animal blood. The jokes consist of mostly lame vampire humor such as women attempting to apply make-up without a mirror. There is one scene where Alicia is looking through pictures of old boyfriends. One of the pictures is Edgar Allen Poe. There were some scenes that worked and were funny. Unfortunately too much of the film had humor and scenes that didn't make it for a mature audience. Definitely only a rental. A sometimes fun film you might want to see once.

5200783,4,B0090EDEQY,"It has been awhile since we have last hard of Amy Heckerling, the renown director for creating popular films such as ""Clueless"", ""Loser"", ""European Vacation"", ""Johnny Dangerously"" and most notably for her directorial debut with ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"".

While Heckerling has been busy with directing and writing for television series, in 2012, the filmmaker went to work on a vampire comedy known as ""Vamps"".  Instead of going the same route as many other vampire films, Heckerling injects humor and life about two vampires who don't want to suck on human blood but enjoy the good life.

The film reunites Heckerling with her ""Clueless"" actress Alicia Silverstone, 16-years later and the film features a talented cast which includes Krysten Ritter (""Confessions of a Shopaholic"", ""She's Out of My League"", ""What Happens in Vegas""), Sigourney Weaver (""Aliens"", ""Avatar""), Dan Stevens (""Hilde"", ""Dracula""), Richard Lewis (""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"", ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"", ""Anything But Love""), Wallace Shawn (""The Princess Bride"", ""Toy Story"" films), Malcolm McDowell (""A Clockwork Orange"", ""Easy A"", ""The Artist""), Marilu Henner (""Taxi"", ""L.A. Story""), Zack Orth (""Romeo + Juliet"", ""Music and Lyrics"", ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona""), Justin Kirk (""Weeds"", ""Angels in America"") and Kristen Johnson (""3rd Rock From the Sun"", ""Bride Wars"").

And now the film will be released on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of Anchor Bay Entertainment in November 2012.

""Vamps"" revolves around two friends, Goody (portrayed by Alicia Silverstone) is a vampire who has been around since the mid-1800s and remembers the '20s and the '30s of New York City as her golden years, but to keep up with her young friend Stacy (portrayed by Krysten Ritter), who was turned into a vampire back in the '80s, Goody tries to be youthful and learn the lingo and fashion of today's world.

Both socialites love to have fun by going to the local vampire bar and hanging out with their technological savvy human friend Renfield (portrayed by Zak Orth) but unlike other vampires, they don't suck on human blood, nor do they attack humans.  In order to feed, both work at a company that captures rats in the city and they feast on the animals for blood.

But Goody is a kind and compassionate vampire and she has taught Stacy how to use her abilities for good and for Stacy, she is happy to have a good friend like Goody watching over her and giving her a second chance at life, having been a drug addict in the past.  But both Goody and Stacy must follow the direction of her stem (the person who turned her to a vampire), the vampire queen known as Ciccerus (portrayed by Sigourney Weaver).

While the two try to live normal lives (knowing that they can't partake in daytime activities), both attend their local vampire meetings (with other vampires who try to live normal lives) and Stacy attends college, taking night classes with Joey (portrayed by Dan Stevens).

When Joey invites her to his home, she is ecstatic.  But she suddenly finds out at the home that Joey's last name is Van Helsing, the family descended of vampire hunters.  And his parents Dr. Van Helsing (portrayed by Wallace Shawn) and Mrs. Van Helsing (portrayed by Kristen Johnson) are aware that she is a vampire and may try to hurt her.

Meanwhile, Goody sees her old ex-boyfriend Danny (portrayed by Richard Lewis) from when they used to do anti-war protests in the late '60s.  When Danny is shocked to see someone that looks exactly like the Goody he knew back in the '60s, Goody tells Danny that she is her daughter.  While it's a shock for her to see Danny again, Danny is busy trying to take care of his wife Angela (portrayed by Marilu Henner) who has terminal cancer.

But as the two try to enjoy their lives, Ciccerus is on a killing spree and the vampires start to worry that the vampire queen may give all vampires a bad name.  And to make things even more difficult, what happens when both women must reveal to the men that they are actually vampires.

VIDEO:

""Vamps"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen presentation 1:78:1).  The picture quality for the film is actually quite wonderful as skin tones are natural, black levels are nice and deep and while the special effects were a bit cheesy at times and sometimes certain green screen utilization of New York City backdrops look a bit fake, these imperfections actually work for a film such as ""Vamps"" as the film is somewhat parodying vampire films/series.

But scenes in New York City look fantastic and for the most part, ""Vamps"" is a film that looks great on Blu-ray!  I didn't notice any artifacts, banding or DNR issues while watching the film.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Vamps"" is presented in Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  The film features crisp dialogue and because the film is primarily a dialogue-driven film (with a short action scene at the end), it's primarily front-channel driven.  I didn't really hear surround sound utilization throughout the film that caught my attention but for the most part, dialogue is crystal clear.

Subtitles are in English SDH and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""Vamps"" comes with the no special features.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I absolutely love Amy Heckerling films.  Not only does she capture the life of adolescents with efficacy but she is able to craft films that are hilarious and fun!

""Vamps"" is a film that is so cheesy, but yet so hilarious, you can't help but laugh and be entertained by it.

Right off the bat, I just loved how ""Vamps"" takes a storyline of vampires and injects it to a storyline of two New York socialites.  But the twist is not only are these two vampires but you have Goody, who tries to act young but having grown up in the 1800s and experience the good life of the early 1900s, she is wise woman that is over a 100-years-old but never reveals her true age, even to her good friend Stacy.

As for Stacy, she's a woman stuck in the '80s.  She is also very naive and takes everything Goody says as golden.

But these two women are just so fun to watch because they are unlike any vampire you have seen on film and television.  Sure, there are shows like ""Angel"" where the protagonist tries to feed on animal blood, but with ""Vamps"", what is hilarious is the way the two handle their vampire life.  From picking up dead rats and plopping a straw into them, how these two young women try to have a ""good morning"" sleep with soil in their coffins yet trying to take care of their skin with moisturizer and most importantly, trying to live a socialite life by venturing into bars and just having fun.

Also, as a cinema fan, you can't help but love Goody's taste in silent films and films of the '30s.  With images of silent films to the playing of Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" or even seeing the famous ""eye"" scene from Luis Bunuel's ""Un Chien Andalou"", for a film that is so fun and kitschy, you just don't expect to see these films show up as clips throughout the film.

And the film also has its fair share of talent from the past such as Sigourney Weaver, Malcolm McDowell, Richard Lewis, Wallace Shawn, Marilu Henner, etc.  And these talents are not wasted on screen.  Sigourney Weaver's as a vampire queen is just hilarious and fun to watch, especially at the end.

But there is also some scenes that have you do a second take because there is someone doing something crazy or foolish in the background.  For instance, during one vampire meeting, a woman in the background can be seen trying to gnaw on a rat.

The film does have violence, I suppose if you call it that.  There are body limbs that are featured and severed heads, but the way they are presented is hilarious.  For example, one pizza delivery person who is pretty much found scattered all over an alley and found by police, the face of the man is just hilarious.  The violence is never shown as scary at all, if anything, you just feel like laughing.

If anything, Amy Heckerling has created a comedy that is meant to be kitschy and an interesting take on the whole vampire genre, but does it her way, with her humor and for the most part, I enjoyed the film!

While the Blu-ray release looks and sounds great, unfortunately there are no special features included.

Overall, fans of Amy Heckerling films will surely want to give ""Vamps"" a try.  As long as they know they are about to watch a film that is not meant to be taken seriously but for those who have an odd sense of humor and just wants to sit back and laugh because of the ridiculous situations that are presented in throughout the film.  ""Vamps"" is one of those, so cheesy but yet so entertaining films that you find once in awhile.

Hilarious, fun and cheesy but yet in a good way... filmmaker/writer Amy Heckerling has made us laugh with her films such as ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" and ""Clueless"" and she will definitely make you laugh in ""Vamps"", a comedy film parodying vampire films/television series.

5200784,3,B0090EDEQY,"When I saw the reviews on this movie I was excited because of the actors that are in it and well, what they showed in the review, it looked good!  BUT OH MY WORD!!  This was close to horrible up until about the last 30 minutes of the movie.  Then it was tolerable with a little laughter.  There are some parts that are funny and actually make you laugh out loud but overall, I would NOT recommend anyone wasting their money on it.  If you can streamline it for a couple dollars, okay.  But even then I would still warn you for disappointment.",1354233600,,542,4.213592233009709
5200785,4,B0090EDEQY,"Amy Heckerling's name on a film as director is usually enough to get me to watch it. She has an undeniable talent for presenting life lessons through her work while capturing a snapshot of a certain cultural time period, whether it be the 1980s through ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High,"" the 1990s with ""Clueless,"" or the 2000's with ""Loser"" and the CW's successful ""Gossip Girl."" ""Vamps"" is Heckerling's latest movie and continues the trend.

Goody (Alicia Silverstone) and Stacy (Krysten Ritter) are modern day vampires living life to its fullest. Every night they feed on rats which are easy to come by thanks to the rodent control business they work for. They're part of a new movement of vampires who don't drink the blood of humans. After work, they hit the clubs and hot spots of New York City before heading home at dawn for a good day's sleep in their coffins.

The girl's soon begin to realize that being young forever isn't all it's cracked up to be. Goody has trouble adjusting to the modern technologies and trends of the 21st century. Stacy finds herself falling in love with the son (Dan Stevens) of the descendant of Van Helsing and longing to be human again. Unfortunately, the only way for the two to get their wishes of ending their immortality and getting on with their real human lives is by killing their maker, Cisserus (Sigourney Weaver).

Heckerling does a superb job exploring the mid-20s age range and our difficulty facing the fears we have or had of growing up and getting older. Being a woman in her late 50s, she has a lot of experience dealing with the subject matter. It just so happens this time around she uses vampires as her vehicle to deliver the messages. What viewers get is an entertaining and humorous film that leaves you with something to think about in the end.

The cast is a very impressive combination of talents. Many of them have appeared in Heckerling's films in the past, giving this a sort of ""connection"" to her other works. Besides Silverstone, we get Wallace Shawn (""Clueless""), Meredith Scott Lynn (""Night at the Roxbury""), and a cameo by Brian Backer (Mark ""Rat"" Ratner in ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High""). Add to that the star power of Sigourney Weaver, Malcolm McDowell, Richard Lewis, and Marilu Henner and you have a winning combination.

The audio and video quality of ""Vamps"" for its Blu-ray release is hit and miss. The 5.1 surround sound does a great job administering the sounds of New York City around a home theater. However, the lighting for some scenes is drastically different from shot to shot. This caused me some distraction when watching the film. There's also some questionable CGI and green screen work, but for the most part the picture is clean and vibrant.

I'm disappointed in the lack of special features for the movie. Amy Heckerling is the type of director and writer movie enthusiasts would love to hear talk about the making of one of her movies. I'd be willing to bet Blu-ray producers could have convinced Alicia Silverstone and Krysten Ritter to be involved in some sort of commentary as well. It was probably just a question of budget to put together featurettes or a commentary track.

The ""Vamps"" Blu-ray is a required purchase for any fan of Amy Heckerling's works. Her trademark off-beat charm, sincerity, and wit emanates from the film. Fans of light vampire fare will probably find more enjoyment in this than ones who enjoy the harder edged gore flicks like ""30 Days of Night"" and ""Fright Night."" I'm a huge horror fan and still found it enjoyable.",1354060800,10,3542,4.74959349593496
5200786,3,B0090EDEQY,I would suggest watching this knowing it is fun but not great movie writing. Loved the actors - all great.,1353888000,2,106,4.35
5200787,4,B0090EDEQY,"This is definitively not everyone's kind of movie, but it reminded me of those cute cheesy 80's movies that are both campy and funny. You got the quirky and cute Kristen  Ritter, and you have adorable Alicia Silverstone, who at first I was a little hesitant to watch. (Shes a mouth feeder, who knows what shes capable of!?)... I was delighted and happy after watching this...and that's all this movie is... entertainment. There are not profound meanings or philosophical type thoughts that will arise from this film...unless you want to talk about man's mortality and the possible idea of living forever...
Sigorney Weaver in my opinion, should have had more face time...but then again, I'm no expert.
I gave this a 4 out 5 rating because I love camp and cheese.
 I love stupid movies both ironically and seriously.

  The movie was like a Buffy episode... very Joss Whedon-esque
which reminds me, If this were a tv I'd watch it for sure.

The ending was cute too...

that's my review and ims sticking to it.",1353801600,6,1008,4.725714285714286

5200789,2,B0090EDEQY,"I expected a ""Clueless"" kinda funny film. What I got was a predictable poor attempt at moviemaking. With that cast this film should have been much better. Dont waste your time on Vamps",1353715200,3,184,4.606060606060606
5200790,4,B0090EDEQY,"I was presently surprised by this movie.  It was just simple fun, not hysterically funny, but fun.  There wasn't anything really new in this movie, the concepts have all been done in one way or the other before, but it was all put together nicely.  For those vampire fans out there this one is in the vein of Innocent Blood, a less cheesy Sundown the Vampire in Retreat, My Best Friend is a Vampire, or Once Bitten.",1353715200,,415,4.363636363636363
5200791,5,B0090EDEQY,"If you're an Alicia Silverstone fan, I don't even need to tell you that you're going to enjoy this movie. It has a heart of gold and a great ending. The running theme of anachronism was actually fuller than I was expecting, as well. I would recommend it to a very specific subset of film lover. I can't really speak to the general public, but I would urge you to give it a shot.",1353369600,,378,4.121621621621622
5200792,5,B0090EDEQY,Loved it! Amy Heckerling is better then ever directing this fun movie starring Alicia Silverstone and Krysten Ritter.  I hope there's a sequel.,1353369600,,143,5.217391304347826
5200793,1,B0090EDEQY,Unwatchable. Literally tried to watch it and couldn't. Avoid at all costs. This movie is not worth seeing for any amount of money.,1353283200,3,130,4.695652173913044
5200794,5,B0090EDEQY,"Vampire films are as popular as they can possible be, thanks, perhaps, to the so-called Twilight saga. For better or for worse, that is the case and we have to live with it. Following this trend, comes ""Vamps,"" a charming, touching - if that is possible in vampire movie --, and funny take on the lives of two attractive Manhattan young ladies who happen to be vampires.

Well-directed by Amy Heckerling (of ""Clueless"" and ""Fact Times at Ridgemont High"" fame), the film stars Alicia Silverstone as Goody, and Krysten Ritter as Stacy, two perfectly-matched roommates, who share an apartment in Manhattan. Because they are vampires - each one which her own story and age --, they sleep in coffins and work during the night in a pest-control company. Most importantly, they are very friendly and don't feed on humans' blood; they consume mice blood, sometimes by inserting a straw inside the mouse's gut (looks funny, believe me). Their time off from work, they spend going from disco to disco, finding one night stands, and just enjoying their lives. However, their world is going to drastically change when both of them fall in love. Goody falls for Danny (Richard Lewis), a boyfriend that she used to date in the seventies, and Stacy is attracted by Joey Van Helsing (Dan Stevens), whose father (the always dependable Wallace Shawn) is a vampire hunter. Add to this Cisserus (Sigourney Weaver, in a sexy role), the so-called stem mother, who, contrary to Goody and Stacy, enjoys killing humans for their blood, and exercise control over them.

""Vamps"" is truly funny and will win you over. At one point, a friend refers to Goody as vampire, to which she responds, ""I just don't appreciate being called the `V' word."" Her friend then asks, ""You prefer ELF?"" And she answers, ""Extended Life Form, yes."" Another one: if somebody realizes that they are vampires, they brainwash the individual with a ""complete Sgt. Schultz,"" that is, ""I know nothing, I saw nothing."" The movie also stars Malcolm McDowell as a friend from a vampire support group, and a cameo of Taylor Negron, who you might remember as the pizza guy from ""Fact Times at Ridgemont High.""

5200796,3,B0090EDEQY,"One of the most uneven films I've ever seen. At its core it's a metaphor for growing up and dealing with growing old, and at times it succeeds marvelously at this. It uses vampire absurdity as a method of dealing with very grounded issues and it does this with charm and warmth.

At the same time it's often sloppily edited to an amateurish degree.

It is at times a much, much smarter movie than you'd expect. And it's very sincere, very much wears its heart on its sleeve in a way that very endearing.

Then almost immediately thereafter it will get sloppy in a manner worthy of a first-year-film-student.

I suppose what puts it over the mid-point of the thumb-o-meter into thumbs-up-land for me is that at the end, I cared about Goody and was glad to have been taken on her life's-journey with her.",1352592000,2,802,4.510344827586207
5200797,5,B0090EDEQY,"This film has the satire for this vamp generation of movies that Young Frankenstein had for those certain classics. The actresses are great, and the appearances of stars-you-may-remember all make this a very fun movie. Very refreshing! The more you know about vampire mythology, the more you will enjoy the humor (a great Vlad the Impaler). A film that the ""clueless"" x-generation will enjoy.",1351728000,13,392,5.140625
5200798,2,B0090EDEQY,"The movie started off well, funny parts, good actors, then for no reason at all there was a disturbing pointless scene of an eyeball being sliced with a straight razor.  Why?  I have no idea.  It was supposed to be a comedy, or maybe a romantic comedy, why would you put that in there.

It was at that point the whole movie started to turn.  Funny concept, Sex in the City meets Love at First Bite.  Van Helsing's son in love w/ a vampire. Parents know whats going on, son in denial, plenty of potential but this is when  the movie takes off on this whole ""Evil Government""  ""Evil Patriot Act""  political statement. The characters start talking about the Patriot Act and the governments intrusion on good people's privacy and never lets up.

I watch movies for entertainment; escapism.  Not the political commentary of a hollywood person.  The humor completely ended. The romantic/comedy story became an after thought.  I was out $7 for a rental.  Too bad.

Wouldnt buy , rent it or even watch it again which is a shame because I like all the actors.  Richard Lewis is brilliant as an aging Jewish Hippy.  You totally believe he is a aging jewish hippy.",1351382400,4,1153,4.546341463414634
