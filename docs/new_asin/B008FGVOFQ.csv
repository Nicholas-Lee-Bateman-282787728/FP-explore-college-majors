There is a lot of good info here about Juliet, not just as a sex star but as a creative person with a wonderful sense of humor.

The DVD is not well organized, though, and it's difficult to find what one is looking for.",1355356800,,445,4.349397590361446
8527328,5,B008FGVOFQ,"For anyone at all familiar with adult movie star Juliet Anderson, they'll know that this innocent sounding DVD title of JULIET AND THE BEARS, is not some fairy tale for children. The illustrations here, are a collection of erotic, hardcore photos, which feature Juliet with two ""lucky"" members of her fan club from 1983, a pair of twins that she thought of as ""bears"". It was a photo shoot taken by noted erotic photographer Paul Johnson, and it really is something very special and unique.

To anyone who knew her, Juliet Anderson was really special and unique. She stood out from scores of other women working in porn during the ""Golden Era"" of the seventies and eighties. As the oldest woman to enter the world of adult movies and magazines at that time, Juliet had more than just a sexy look. She had style, elegance and a wicked sense of sexual fun. You could say she was ahead of her time, as she really was the original milf, cougar or any other description of a mature temptress you can think of. More than her fans, the camera liked her. The camera of Paul Johnson captured the very essence of Juliet. An essence that clearly shows how much Juliet liked to perform, and how much she enjoyed the abundant sex that was such a big part of her life.

Johnson's photos are pure eroticism. They draw you in and make you feel like you are there. Juliet's wicked smile and educated tongue, say it all. These two ""bears"", these two short hairy guys, really were blessed to be immortalized, kodachromed and well satisfied, by such a sexual legend. Photographer and close intimate friend Paul Johnson, brings out in brilliant color not just Juliet and her ""bears"", but also featured on the DVD, is a sizzling magazine layout with fellow porn star Holly McCall. It's made even more hot by the fact that Paul himself manages to become part of the three-way action.  There's a brief tribute from the legendary Nina Hartley, who incidently Juliet discovered herself, and from adult star Richard Pacheco. In addition, we have a great sample of Paul's photographic skills in general, from models on the beach, to landscapes and flowers, and all well composed and well focused.

Paul Johnson introduces us to his work, a career that well married his love of photography and art, with his deep passionate love of women. As he said himself, a ""dream job"" that we very much get to become a part of, with this exceptional, loving and erotic DVD. Its a wonderful tribute to Juliet's memory, a woman that brought so much love and passion into this crazy world, and never got the fame or fortune she so well deserved. But again, this is a rare treat, thats just meant for the grown-ups, or rather the ""enlightened"" variety of grown-ups!",1350777600,,2720,4.660416666666666
