8630632,5,B00H7RAHX4,"This is not a super movie, but it's like watching Tornado Alley on the Weather Channel, except no commercials.  It was entertaining and I'll probably watch it one more time when I am bored.",1408924800,,189,4.5588235294117645
8630633,5,B00H7RAHX4,"Jeff Piotrowski is a Storm Chaser who was involved with many of the storms like Joplin or Moore. These videos are be bit more raw than what one would ordinarily see on TV but they describe much for 2013. There is also a full accounting of the El Reno tornado on 5-31-13 and a rather touching tribute to the Chasers who lost their lives in that disaster. While they have been edited somewhat, these showcase the storms very well. For those seeking videos of tornadoes, this is a good one as it focuses on the storms in detail.",1406419200,3,525,4.36734693877551
8630634,5,B00H7RAHX4,"I recently watched TwisterChasers presents: The Year of Record Breaking Extremes featuring tornadic storms from 2013. This is another in a series of storm chase DVDs by Jeff Piotrowski and Kathryn Piotrowski . Both are well-known and highly regarded storm chasers who have had impressive success over the years. Despite this success, one of the main strengths of this production is the inclusion of footage from several other storm chasers in addition to Jeff and Kathryns video. No single chaser can be on every storm or obtain video from all perspectives. This combined approach allows for a comprehensive review of the main storm events of 2013. They feature the El Reno, Bennington, Moore, Rozel and Wayne/Correctionville storms. The wild Bray, Oklahoma video is especially frustrating for me as I was very close yet missed the entire tornado due to rain and positioning. Some of the tornado video is insanely close. The video and sound quality is very good. I am also impressed with the editing and documentation. This DVD isn't just a series of video clips. Instead, each storm event is presented with ample maps, radar, narration and text. There are time-lapse videos and even aerial damage surveys. I also enjoyed beautiful structure shots of lightning, supercells and mammatus. This DVD is a great way to spend a cold winter evening while awaiting storm season. My only complaint is that only a DVD version is available. Almost all storm chasers shoot HD video and that video should be shown in its full glory. I still highly recommend this video.
