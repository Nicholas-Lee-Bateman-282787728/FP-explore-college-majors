7067349,5,B00URJFYEG,"I would absolutely give this movie more stars if I could! This movie came out in select theaters in January. We had the intention to go see it, but it disappeared as quickly as it appeared. We waited on pins and needles for it to come out so we could buy it. It came out yesterday but it was too late for us to watch, so we watched it tonight. We were not disappointed! We were interested in this movie because my 16 year old son has been on a high school robotics team in Denver, CO for 2 years now. Last year the team came in 2nd in State, making us ineligible to compete in the World Championship. This school year, we not only won nearly every competition, but we took State, and made it to the World Championship this year! The team won their division of 90 teams and then went on to compete against the other 4 division winners for the top prize. Our Fuse team took 3rd in the World! We knew what these kids in this movie have been through, we have been the underdogs, and we came out nearly on top. We have felt the defeat, but we have felt the exhilaration too!",1430870400,,1069,4.119617224880383

7067359,5,B00URJFYEG,"Great movie for the family about a current issues. Raises some tough questions, and gets you to think about the issue of immigration and how we need to have a real discussion about it and try to solve it.

I did buy the DVD because it has the digital copy also, but the code has expired and did not work, total bummer. I would have ordered the digital version instead. Dissapointed.",1519516800,,382,4.380281690140845
7067360,5,B00URJFYEG,Great movie for kids and Teens.  This true story shows them what is possible with a little effort.,1517184000,,98,4.444444444444445

7067366,5,B00URJFYEG,This is the type of movie I like watching over and over. It is very inspiring. It shows how a very determined group of kids were undefeated to reach their goal in spite of their lack of resources. I admire their efforts !!!,1505692800,,223,4.209302325581396
7067367,5,B00URJFYEG,Great story and well executed with good acting.  Very relevant in these times of immigrant controversy.  Gives you some real insight into what's really out there instead of what the politicians tell you.  And it really happened pretty much the way it does in the movie!,1503964800,,269,4.804347826086956
7067368,4,B00URJFYEG,I watched it free on Amazon Prime last week but didn't finish it. Now it costs money. What's up?,1501977600,,96,4.105263157894737
7067369,5,B00URJFYEG,"This is a feel-good story based on actual events.  Geoorge Lopez has a more serious role in this movie, and Jamie Lee Curtis and Marissa Tomei round this out.  The four students profiled are unknowns and that is what makes this movie so enjoyable.  Their characters are based on real students who thought they stood no chance of succeeding despite their talents.

Lopez plays a man needing a job.  He takes on a substitute teaching job for a few months.  Several boys relate to him and when one student wants to join the robotics club and enter in a competition, that's when the plot truly begins.  But each kid has personal challenges to overcome, and we also learn that the teacher does, too.  Against all odds, this ends in a happy end for the team and at the end, during the credits, we learn what happened to the real kids this story is based on.

This movie is suitable for classroom viewing.  There is some violence and a few cuss words but they are realistic for the scenes.",1501977600,2,982,4.466292134831461

7067374,1,B00URJFYEG,"George Lopez was funny when he was a sitcom actor, now he's a political hack commentator.
Thanks but no thanks George, can't have it both ways, your stuff really sucks now.",1500076800,,172,4.580645161290323
7067375,5,B00URJFYEG,"Enjoyable telling of an inspirational story.  I love a good underdog story and those based on real people are even better.  It's hard to imagine that a scientific competition could be so exciting.  The three known stars deliver solid performances, but so do the ""unknowns"" portraying the team.  We thoroughly enjoyed it.",1500076800,,320,5.096153846153846

7067382,4,B00URJFYEG,"This was a truly inspiring movie, on a par with Stand & Deliver.  It would have gotten a 5-star from me, if someone hadn't felt it necessary to throw in a political commercial at the end (I'm not a voting conservative or Republican, and I do agree that deporting kids, in particular, is not the best way to handle illegal aliens, but I live in the United States so I have freedom to choose what I want to believe and not have propaganda shoved down my throat; Hollywood would do well to remember that!).",1498348800,,503,4.351063829787234

7067385,5,B00URJFYEG,"Excellent movie. It's funny and heartwarming and makes you think. Is it a perfect movie? Amazing acting? Awesome script? Not quite, but more than good enough to get a hearty recommendation and 5 stars. Another movie I recommend that has some similarities is East Side Sushi. These aren't blockbusters, but they're good tales that need to be told and enjoying to watch.",1497830400,,368,4.951612903225806

7067387,5,B00URJFYEG,"No words! Just one of the best movies made that I've watched recently about true life challenges for Hispanic undocumented people.

7067399,5,B00URJFYEG,"This is such a great movie, so inspiring and worth watching over and over. It's a great movie that shows that it takes one person to believe in kids who don't think they have a chance in the country, to lift them up and not give up on them. These teachers have impacted the lives of these boys in a way they probably never thought would happen.",1495756800,,344,4.149253731343284

7067404,5,B00URJFYEG,"Great movie. People complaining that it has a ""liberal agenda"" are generally not happy when confronted with facts that don't meet their personal view of the world. Nonetheless, this movie is based on fact, and yes, the characters are portraying real life kids who grew up in the States, and wanted to better themselves and lead productive lives. One actually served in the Middle East and received his citizenship after putting his life on the line for our country. These kids proved that even though they are minorities, even though they were here illegally, they had something positive to offer our country in the form of intelligence and diligence. To beat top engineering schools in a national competition on a dime is no small feat, and their story is inspirational. Alas, we value dumb/self righteous ""American born"" people who sit on their butts and complain about their jobs being taken away by minorities more than we do what made America great in the first place: Gumption and drive, and the understanding that education leads to a better quality of life for all. Sad ending for some of these young men. Had they been from Europe here illegally, they might have had better luck, but alas, they had dark skin.",1494460800,,1218,4.832535885167464
7067405,4,B00URJFYEG,"I loved this movie - the message, the actors (despite George Lopez, who is traditionally not known as a tour-de-force dramatic actor :).  I will say that I am disappointed that this movie is not issued with Spanish subtitles at Amazon.  I have two students new to the U.S. from El Salvador, and they really wanted to watch it with the rest of the students, and had a hard time following.  It would definitely had touched them, especially as brand new to America, if they had been able to read along to follow along.  Considering the setting and the characters, it's a real oversight not to offer Spanish subtitles.",1494374400,,614,4.605504587155964

7067408,5,B00URJFYEG,"Great movie that my students could relate to (we have a large Latino population in our school, a Title I school) and we just competed in our 2nd Robotic competition.

7067410,5,B00URJFYEG,What a great story! They did embellish a few things and altered a few details. In general they get it right. Great movie for days that I am out of the classroom combined with a study guide it is a positive message and beneficial for my students.,1493424000,,245,4.23404255319149

7067426,4,B00URJFYEG,"This is inspiring movie and enjoyable to watch - but after seeing ""Underwater Dreams"" - which I totally dislike,  I felt they made these events more than what they were in real life - good example of this was MIT's Robot - in this movie they made like some Star Wars death star but in real life it was no where near as high tech.

I almost gave it 5 stars but this other movie ruin it for me. - I was glad about this story being underdog story,  but the politics of ""Underwater Dreams"" ruin the movie and the entire situation - it is funny how politics in movies can destroy the entire concept of movies.  I love how the ""George Lopez"" character was helping these kids to become more than what has been handed to them.

I be honest if it was not for this movie, ""Underwater Dreams"" would likely be in garbage can.",1489363200,,813,4.185897435897436

Once you have been in the dark, you're going to appreciate everything that shines."" The sentiment resonates strongly watching this movie about four young ""undocumented"" high school kids, who came from broken families (a parent or a sibling deported) and hopes, but were resilient and determined enough to compete against likes of MIT for underwater robotics competition. The story is true (fact checked.) The theme also resonates with what the son of a Syrian immigrant once said, ""stay hungry, stay foolish.""",1486512000,,605,5.06

7067825,5,B00URJFYEG,"I'm not going to say it's a perfect movie because it's not. It can be draggy and disjointed and meanders a little off the story of these boys. But I absolutely loved the theme, the inspiring story behind it, and the reality of being illegal in the US. I'm not here to point one way or another at the politics of this topic because that's not what this is about. I think the movie shows it best, these are kids that didn't choose the life they were given. Whether here or there, being young is hard enough but to be thrown into this harsh life where you're seen as a criminal for existing is tough on any young mind. On top of that, they feel limited in their dreams because their options are so limited.
For anyone that judges innocent children as if they're nothing, your humanity has shriveled up and died.
That being said, I appreciate that this is a story of kids that put their passion into something and really impressed. I like that the real life parallels were shown at the end and we got to see where they ended up. It's a cute movie and if you watch it with an open mind you'll find that despite its imperfections, it's heartwarming, funny and will draw you in to root for these kids.",1484611200,3,1194,4.287610619469026

The movie is quite timely now as it centers on 4 high school students, all of them brought to the United States as children by their parents.  The movie addresses the hardships they face because of that, but mostly the connection they make with George Lopez', who plays a substitute teacher at their troubled high school.

7068467,5,B00URJFYEG,"I was pleasantly surprised by Spare Parts.  I guess that's because I hadn't heard about the movie.  The acting was quite good and the production quality was excellent.  As always, with a ""based on a true story"" movie, I wonder how many of the details were fabricated.  But, the story was inspirational and it lacked nothing that you'd expect in a first rate movie with actual plot and character development.  The subplots were very good and carried some excellent messages.  It was a very nice break from CGI and endless battle scenes.  Having said all of that, I think I'd be remiss if I didn't address what appears to be the underlying message in this movie.  It is one that can take on the ""us and them"" flavor of so many controversial issues.  As a country, do we want to throw out the rules to allow undocumented people in?  I do not know the true character of the individuals in the movie.  They are portrayed as flawed, but justifiably so.  No attempt is made to cover some of the unacceptable behaviors but we are expected to be sympathetic.  This is a tough one for me because I believe in being held accountable for one's actions.  I had a very flawed upbringing.  Does that excuse me from following a reasonable set of rules?  No.  Do I sometimes fail?  Yes.  Should the rules then be set aside to accommodate my failures?  No.  I don't want to over simplify a very complex issue.  But, a society needs to have some basic rules.  If the rules regarding people entering our country are unfair or unreasonable, fix them.  Don't simply ignore them then enable those who break them.  I am only second generation born in this country.  My grandparents came through Ellis Island, legally and went through the process of becoming citizens.  Was that unfair?  They didn't think so.",1466380800,3,1784,4.595541401273885

There are not enough quality family movies nor TV shows being made. It was great to watch this with my young boys. Are there better movies/shows with bigger budgets? Yes. Do many of them target families with engaging, positive stories? No. Somewhere Hollywood decided that the Family category belongs to animation targeting 7 year old kids.

7068955,2,B00URJFYEG,"In all honesty - I only made it 20 minutes into this film before I got frustrated enough to turn it off.  That said - it might get better, I just didn't have the fortitude to stick it out.

I appreciate the story of scrappy young men wanting to compete in an underwater robotics competition (full disclosure: I have been affiliated with the MATE Competition - the one featured, but not named in the film - for six years) but the writers missed the mark on the technical aspects and completely cheapened the hard work and steep learning curve for every student who enters this competition for weak laughs.

The first cringe-worthy comment was made during the sales pitch by the students - ""we can use these Styrofoam blocks as ballast"" (Yeah, good luck with that). Which was quickly followed on by some mysterious electrical work that blows up leaving a student with char-marks around his safety glasses.

That's when I turned it off.  The acting might have eventually been brilliant.  The story of the Carl Hayden team is inspirational - but it was reduced to trite gags and bad science.  I couldn't stomach it and shut it down.

The rating it two stars - only because one star seems too harsh for the REAL people in this story.  Take the writers out to the pasture - this could have been so much more.",1462924800,4,1302,4.52991452991453

7069161,4,B00URJFYEG,"A charming feel-good story about a misplaced PhD engineer-become science teacher, who coaches a handful of underprivileged, immigrant boys to compete in a national underwater robotics contest.
(My daughter says it's the same plot as McFarland, USA, but McFarland was better.)
Spare Parts has the usual plot elements - a guy down on his luck (skipping from job to job for reasons you'll discover later in the movie), taking a substitute teaching job for just a few months (Jamie Lee Curtis having a HOOT as the Principal who hires him), and being challenged by a group of lost high school boys to let them show their stuff and compete.  Also, (perhaps?) a love interest in Marisa Tomei, dodging ICE's illegal immigrant hunters, conflicts in mixed families (citizen children mixed with illegal immigrant children), and how easy it is to judge other's harsh family life until you know all the problems they face.
Based on the true story.  (With real photos in the closing credits - where are they now...)",1462147200,3,1001,4.9171597633136095

7069287,3,B00URJFYEG,"Certainly likable, and covering an inspiring underdog story. The story does a great job juggling the unfortunate lives of those involved with the fun montage of building an underwater robot and entering a prestigious competition. The story covered the varied harsh realities of the four boys, while still balancing it out with fun antics. A great addition to the racially-based underdog stories, a la Cool Runnings.

However, the two plot lines involving slapdash-love-stories seemed forced, and watered down the admirable motivation to succeed in the face of financial and racial barriers with the mundane motivation to impress women. Additionally, Lopez's character's motivations were sloppy, with a sad backstory added in halfway through to sloppily plug the plot hole.",1461715200,,772,5.5423728813559325

No matter what climate change believers say, if you claim that the science is settled then you do not understand that Science is all about trying to prove or disprove a hypothesis.  Science is never settled no matter what they say.  So much of what people believed just 100 years ago was proved untrue, or not understood.  Sure, I believe that the climate is changing, I just don't believe that man is the main cause of it or that man can do anything about it other than prepare for emergencies.  I believe that is simply arrogant of man to believe that man has that much power in changing the weather.",1461715200,,730,4.534351145038168

There were silly moments of kissing a new BF/GF, but I can actually recommend this one to families who are looking for something without sex scenes or really vulgar language.  There are a few d@%ns, etc... according to my wife, and there are a few places where the characters stop themselves just before obviously almost saying the F word, but I didn't hear anything worse than that. There's an attempted robbery scene with a gun shown, but no shots are fired. Also some bullying scenes; one with some serious punches thrown.

7069715,3,B00URJFYEG,"I would love to give it 5 stars, because it really is a pretty good show - but the reason I didn't is because it's not exclusively about the technological sciences; it's also Amnesty and global warming propaganda.  It tries to draw an emotional response for illegal aliens (Amnesty), and in not so many words scoffs at those who question global warming (not climate change); it even makes an appeal (or tries to, rather) by showcasing video footage of Obama in the closing sequence.  I hate it when writers/directors throw politics into an otherwise good show - a show that is not about politics - I think it shows how detached they are form the public, and just want to push their own personal viewpoint on them.

Overall cool story.  Leave the politics to the politicians next time.",1460332800,,784,4.659420289855072

The acting was fantastic.  The movie was based on actual events and there was the main theme of the underwater robotics competition which was interesting in itself but with the added  drama of inner city, high school relationships and each of the kids with their individual problems they had to deal with, this movie was an absolute winner.

A down-on-his luck Engineer with his doctorate degree takes a substitute teaching position in a High School with a large population of illegal students. While there he inspires and mentors several students who are  interested in engineering, technology, and the application of the same.

The movie is another testimonial to what might occur with challenged students who are given sufficient motivation, instruction, and care. There are some unanswered questions that are prominent in the movie, concerning immigration, dysfunctional families, and the like. The writers and director do not attempt to answer those, which is probably for the best, leaving the viewer to sort those out for themselves, if they can be sorted out.

Over-all, a great ""feel-good"" movie that is appropriate for most family members, particularly unmotivated teens, and those who grossly generalize entire populations, or ethnicities.",1458000000,,948,5.615384615384615

Puts a point on the rock and hard place that young kids are put in by their parents who bring them here illegally, and the fact that countries have laws, doesn't change the fact that a child grows up in a place and that is his ""home,"" and that is tragic that adults can be so short sited... but if you're driven you can find a way forward.",1457049600,,610,4.267241379310345

They got the job done with $800 while top tier college team spent $10,000 +. Team work is very important in this movie.",1452556800,,409,4.774647887323944

7070380,5,B00URJFYEG,"The book is always better than the movie.  Don't get me wrong, I loved the movie.  But then I had to read the book to know the real life details.  While the movie ends on an ""up"" note, real life has both ups and downs.  Indeed, there is a lot more to the story of these young men.  I think it should be required for everyone in the U.S. to read this book and/or something like it.  There is such a negative outlook on immigrants, and particularly those who came to the U.S. illegally, but what about kids?  They are brought here and it's the only life they know.  Should they be expected to give up their life and move to a country that is strange to them when they turn 18?  And, the portrayal of an immigrant is often negative, yet here is a group of young men who weren't out getting into trouble.  They were sharpening their minds and becoming very promising engineers who could certainly contribute to our country.  When I read this I can't help but think what a shame it is that public policy is so rigid and so negative that we, as a country, are missing out on great talent like these kids.  And, these kids may miss out on a bright future for which they worked hard.  It just doesn't seem like the American Dream.  Read the story; it will definitely make you think, and hopefully, act.",1447891200,11,1294,4.25

7070440,5,B00URJFYEG,"Based on a true story, a group of high school students on a limited budget create an underwater robotic machine for competition. The kids are undocumented immigrants and take a chance competing.

If you have seen ""Stand and Deliver,""  ""McFarland,""  or ""Up in Smoke"" you must realize it is just a matter of time before Spanish speaking people will take over the world. The film creates internal conflict to keep us watching and spends minimum time on the mechanics. At one point a kid says to Jamie Lee Curtis, ""I saw something like this in a horror movie once.""  Perhaps the funniest line in the film, for me anyway.

It is a decent family film. There some fighting and parental yelling. The theme of the film supports ""The Dream Act.""",1439769600,3,735,4.623076923076923

7070501,5,B00URJFYEG,This is Hollywood version of what happened. As a mentor for a high school robot team the movie does a good job of capturing some of the highs and lows of robot competitions.  They changed the mentor story. This movie was about the student and showing his story would have made a great but totally different movie. One of the better things about the movie is that they did not portray the other teams with the usual Hollywood stereotypes (rich spoiled kid ). My biggest qualm with the movie is they showed the mentor coming up with ideas that in the book were the student ideas. Their timing of the release of movie could not have been worse.  They released in during the middle First Robotics Competition build season when the biggest audience for this movie were too busy building their own robots to have time to go see a movie.,1436659200,3,830,4.490066225165563

7070523,5,B00URJFYEG,"After watching McFarland USA which features Mexican immigrants who excelled in cross country racing,Spare Parts is another film that features them. This time,we get to see them excel in the robotics competition.

This film based on ""La Vida Robot"" focuses on the journey of a group that consist of four Mexican high school students from Carl Hayden High School as they prepare and compete in the 2004 national robotics competition going up against college students from excellent schools like M.I.T and Stanford University. The students have only used $800 compared to their opponents which have used thousands for the competition.

While this maybe another typical inspirational film that could also be classified as an underdog story,it managed to provide joy and entertainment as we get to see a group of self-determined and intelligent students who managed to excel despite the challenges and obstacles that are against them. It also provided a great lesson that anyone can achieve anything in life as long as one is willing to his best and everything that he's got. Also,we also get to the contribution that Mexican immigrants have brought into this country regardless of one's opinion of them.",1435881600,2,1199,5.175257731958763
7070524,5,B00URJFYEG,Great family movie!  My kids and I loved it!  We've watched it several times and still enjoy it.,1435795200,,96,4.277777777777778
7070525,3,B00URJFYEG,"When I saw information on this movie online, I thought it sounded familiar -- I had read an article in Reader's Digest that sounded a lot like the premise of this movie.  Intrigued, I decided to check out the movie for myself.  I'm mostly familiar with George Lopez as a comedic actor, and I could only hope that his presence wouldn't detract from the more serious premise of the movie.  And I hoped to get a little more insight into the story of four underprivileged high school students who managed to not only compete among elite college students, but achieve greatness.

The movie is simply... okay.  I like a good underdog story, but at the same time this movie feels too much like a bog-standard ""teacher reforms tough-luck students"" story, one we've seen countless times before.

George Lopez plays Fredi Cameron, an engineer who's taking on a temporary job as a substitute teacher at Carl Hayden High School in Arizona.  The principal, played by Jamie Lee Curtis, has grim expectations for all Cameron's students, saying that many of them are undocumented and all are simply out to cause trouble.  But Cameron has more faith in his students, and when the robotics club he founds on a whim attracts four Hispanic students (one an illegal alien who harbors dreams of serving in the military), he decides they're going to build their own robot... and enter it into a prestigious robotics competition.  The four students must band together, scrape together funds and materials for building their robot, and overcome parental strife and run-ins with the law to make it to the competition, and even then they'll be competing against some of the top colleges in the nation...

I loved the original story, but somehow seeing it in film form weakens and dilutes it.  The filmmakers have taken the original story and turned it into a typical ""teacher comes to tough high school and does good"" story, in the same vein as ""Stand and Deliver,"" ""Lean On Me,"" and countless other films.  And some parts of the film make me wonder if they weren't tacked on or exaggerated in order to make for more dramatic moments or to further mold the original story to fit the ""teacher saves students"" plot.  I understand that this is Hollywood and that they will inevitably alter details of true stories to make for a more watchable film, but it's still irksome when it happens.

The acting in this film is strong, however, and mostly saves it from being simply mediocre.  George Lopez tones down his funny-man act and turns in a good dramatic performance -- still friendly, but keeping a rein on the goofy antics.  Jamie Lee Curtis shows grit and toughness as the school's cynical principal, but also has a good heart beneath.  And the actors playing the four students show various sides to the audience -- tough, funny, smart, cynical -- but these sides never clash and make for a good group dynamic among them.  Most other roles are fairly flat and unmemorable, with the rest of the cast seeming to be there simply to ""fill in the blanks,"" as it were.

While the movie makes me curious to learn more about the true story behind it, it feels pretty average and bog-standard to me.  If you've seen ""Stand and Deliver"" or ""Lean On Me,"" you already have a good idea how this movie's going to go, and it holds little in the way of surprises.  Still, it's worth a watch, mostly for the acting and the group dynamic amongst the students.  Probably best for ages 12 and up due to language and some frightening moments.",1435795200,3,3493,4.682487725040916

That type of story is nothing new but in ""Spare Parts"" he comes to care for a group of undocumented kids with a gift for robotics and no budget to enter into a contest - well that's new.

Unfortunately the indoctrination in this movie was so thick and so over the top it took away from all of that.  If you must watch this movie skip to the last half hour to save yourself the agony or better yet just read the Wired article.

Aside from that it was like watching a really bad remake of Dangerous Minds.  The acting was by the adult characters was barely believable.",1432252800,4,559,4.346153846153846
7070637,4,B00URJFYEG,"In Spare Parts, 4 Hispanic high school students form a robotics club in an attempt to compete with some of the best engineering colleges in the country.

I didn't know much about the movie prior to watching and was something my better half picked to watch.  Although the story is a bit predictable and follows a familiar plot line, this is a classic underdog tale and most amazingly is based on a true story.  Each student has their own backstory and each play their roles well with George Lopez playing a very surprisingly good serious role.  The movie surprised me in the fact that it was better than I expected it to be.  The movie was inspiring and worth watching.

Jamie Lee Curtis is a little over-the-top in her portrayal of the principal and I kept seeing Marissa Tomei in ""My Cousin Vinny"", but that in no way diminishes the believable (and true) story of these kids and their teacher.

I had never even heard of it, but based on a recommendation from a friend and the good reviews I found online, I took a chance.  The acting is generally very good (I was surprised at how good George Lopez is in a somewhat serious role) as is the mostly hip-hop soundtrack. Yes, a few parts of the script are a bit predictable, but that is more than compensated for by this amazing true-life story. This is a story which, if it hadn't really happened, you would have to say would be an impossible premise. Definitely watch it to the end so that you can see the photos of the real-life students who are depicted in the film and what has happened to them since the events shown.

Here's the message - we are better off with all the willing help we can get.
