8366297,5,B002DY9KTI,I love this DVD on how it shows a episode from each of the seasons keep up the good work. For crying out loud is one of my favorite episodes from the johto journeys season I only wish I had gotten the whole season on DVD when I had the chance it would be great if the season could be re-released on DVD so people could re-live the journey through the johto region. If you like the earlier seasons of Pokemon I definitely recommend this DVD so you can go back to those earlier days of the Pokemon series.,1337472000,,503,4.090909090909091
