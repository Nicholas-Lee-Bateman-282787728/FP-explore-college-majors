7849450,3,6303443117,"This review is for the VHS movie ""Stalked"" (1994). The movie focuses on a young man named Daryl Gleeson (Jay Underwood) who by chance saves the life of a young boy named Mikey (Tod Fennell). Naturally, his mother Brooke Daniels (Maryam d'Abo) is extremely grateful and invites the young man to her restaurant for a free meal. (At this point know one knows that Daryl was recently released from a mental facility and is still psychotic.) From the moment Daryl first meets Brooke, he begins to plot just how to win her over and make her love him. As the movie goes on, we begin to see that Daryl is deadly serious about his desires for Brooke and will stop at nothing to carry out his increasingly evil plan. I don't want to give away too much of the movie, but as things begin to go wrong, Daryl begins to manipulate the situation to try to make it look like Brooke is the one who is really crazy. But his plan slowly begins to unravel. When Brooke's life is on the line, her son's skills as a little league pitcher saves the day. I loved that scene. (By the way, Tod Fennell, as the boy, was the only one in the movie who wasn't creepy. He was genuinely sweet and adorable and had a cool head on his shoulders.) This movie contains very strong language, topless nudity, and lots of bloody scenes, so be warned.

I also need to point out that this movie is not on DVD. If you look on the Amazon page, it shows that the movie is on both VHS and DVD. However, if you click on the DVD movie, you will discover it is a completely different movie, with a different plot and different actors. But is has the same name. This is an error on the part of Amazon. It is misleading to customers and should be corrected.",1433980800,,1706,4.265432098765432
7849451,3,6303443117,"This movie is hilariously low budget. I first saw it on Lifetime and loved how funny it was. It's surprising that it's rated R. It is supposed to be a serious movie but there is alot of bad acting, a super lame script and even lamer characters, music and plotlines. I'm glad I bought it though because it's a riot.",1253750400,3,314,4.25
