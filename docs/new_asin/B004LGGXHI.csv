4401357,4,B004LGGXHI,"A true display of the heightened level of xenophobia some Americans experienced post September 11th.  It begs the question of what might have been witnessed or overheard in the homes of countless numbers of young, seemingly disenfranchised White American males following the horrific attacks of that day.  While I found some aspects of this film difficult, I also believe it important that we continue having open discussions related to our biases and prejudices so that as Americans we learn to move from a place of tolerance to acceptance of all...",1409097600,5,550,5.1

4401359,1,B004LGGXHI,"Pointless movie, This was just a good excuse to work in a 9/11 plot element.. But the movie is no more disturbing than what goes on in other countries and cultures. To paint this picture that ""OMG, WHITE KIDS ARE MONSTERS"" is bigoted itself. I'm not saying this doesn't and didn't happen after 9/11, and it is wrong if it did or does happen; however,  the majority of people do NOT act like this or support this kind of behavior, from ANY group, regardless of color, religious affiliation, ethnicity, sexual orientation, etc....

Anti social behavior is Anti social behavior..PERIOD.. Your background doesn't give you a pass to act differently from everyone else when it comes to such behavior.. Whether it's Muslim extremists who stone, castrate or BEHEAD people (as done many times online and in the movie - no one wants to discuss that), African nations committing white and gay genocide, Latino gangs and murdering border jumping drug cartels, Asian street gangs, Boyz in da Hood drive by shootings, A Clockwork Orange style gangs, The Italian Mafia, the Russian Mafia or Heteros beating up Gays, or Christian and Religious people persecuting non believers of their fairytales, which they've done for centuries - NONE of it is new....Anyone who thinks it is, is totally nave or refuses to admit it.. This whole notion that any group can say whatever they want and preach hate, but if it's coming from anyone white - ""OMG, it's atrocious, and so scary!!!"" is beyond ridiculous. Drive by's are scary, Beheadings are scary, kidnapping drug lords are scary... But a white guy with an angry opinion - ""OMG - SO TERRIFYING!!!"". It's such a huge double standard.. and sometimes double standards can and will create animosity. I'm just pointing out the inconstancies in our society's ever growing hypocrisy due to apathy, ignorance and out of control political lopsided correctness.

Personally, I didn't really care for this movie.. I saw the trailer and the first 30 mins, then skimmed and said forget it.. it's a gimmick film with a 9/11 excuse to exploit this TV movie fare. It was also pandering to those who really believe that white people are all evil and hate filled deep down, and not only is that sickening, bigoted and wrong, it's reckless ignorant and just as biased.

I bought this today on DVD for a buck at Dollar General - new in a full sized case... and it's from Echobridge Ent.... It's not a DVD-R, like the Green Apples version; and the quality is way up there.. How these companies  (not necessarily referring to Amazon) get away selling DVD-R and passing it off as quality stuff is a total joke.. Try trading in a DVD-R at a used store - no one will take it.. It's no better than a bootleg you made yourself on your DVD recorder or computer with a spool of 100 blank DVD's..Not to mention, DVD-R is not commercial grade by any means .. It's an expensive full priced bootleg, which cost 30 cents to produce, complete with a Xerox'd blurred cover - Yeah, that's totally legit.. Here's my $10 - $30! (sarcasm).",1385769600,6,3026,4.745247148288973

Every comic book, TV show and book showed Asians as always being evil. The people that picked on me sounded just like the kids in this film.  There were the crazy kids and the fools that just stood there and did nothing.  I was so scared I brought a knife with me at all times for fear of something like this happening to me and I'm talking about the 70s and 80s. This film was great.

4401363,3,B004LGGXHI,"""American Bully"" contains a decent attempt to illustrate bigotry and intolerance in post-911 America. The chronically profane dialogue carries a lot of weight in characterizing the wild--but still, Brandon excepted, fairly typical--adolescent protagonists despite the fact that the boys' voices all sound alike (and is it just my imagination, or is the lip-syncing off?). The Typical Smaller Town, USA, setting is, perhaps intentionally, confining, and, while low budget films often have a certain appeal, this one's limitations work against it pretty glaringly. I had much higher hopes for ""American Bully"": More development of the storyline and characters' motivations, particularly those of arch-bully Brandon O'Leary, could do miracles here. All the same, it certainly kept my attention and honestly surprised me in a couple of spots. If you don't expect too wide a scope and appreciate tense, disturbing films centered on teenagers getting themselves and others into troublesome, ultimately tragic situations, ""American Bully"" is for you.",1343001600,6,1043,5.735483870967742
4401364,5,B004LGGXHI,"I was really satisfied with the film and the seller's timely fashion in shipping the item to me. The movie was a drama-thriller, I'd say. Focuses on the different opinions of people based on the effects of the events of 9/11. Truly a mortifying film on how far one's hate will take them to harm others. Great performances from actors, Marshall Allman (Prison Break), Matt O'Leary (Domestic Disturbance) and Ross Britz (Maskerade).",1342656000,3,430,4.986111111111111

4401372,5,B004LGGXHI,"Idiots of all ages don't seem to learn.  Being nice does not help.  When trying to explain that what one crime may do to one's record. The individual acts as though he/she knows all about the situation.  Perhaps the accurate object to occur is for all 'bullies to experience the receipt of ridicule and mental and emotional beatings they were granting to others.

4401373,3,B004LGGXHI,"This is a film about a group of American teens with a sick, twisted view of defending our country. The maniacal leader, Brandon, holds ALL Arabs responsible for 9/11 and justifies ANY action perpetrated against ANY of them to be justified on that basis.

Profoundly, Brandon's attitude mirrors that of ISIS and other terrorist groups, which slaughter our innocent citizens because of our military's involvement in the wars in the M.E. We should all be as appalled at the crimes perpetrated by these lunatic teenagers as we are of those committed by ISIS and other terrorist groups.

This film is fiction (at least I'm not aware of any ties to actual events), but tragically I am sure that actions of this nature occur here to some degree. This film demands that we examine ourselves and do everything possible to ensure that we do not become our own worst enemy by becoming a reflection of our enemies. I just hope it's not too late.

I have to credit Matt O'Leary in his portrayal of Brandon--great acting.

Still, I felt I left this movie without a sense of justice having been served. I really didn't care for the ending.",1426550400,4,1124,4.690355329949239

4401378,1,B004LGGXHI,"I searched and searched for a reason to at least give this film two stars because the concept was interesting, but the poor acting, writing and execution of this film was simply insurmountable for me. First of all, this movie is not about bullying so if you're looking for that kind of subject matter, it'd be best to save your time. Instead it's a movie about a teenage kid who has a violent psychotic break for reasons the writers or director felt they didn't need to adequately explain.

Basically, the movie starts with twenty minutes of disconnected scenes that have nothing to do with the main narrative of the film. The next thirty minutes are the meanderings of a group of teenagers with virtually no character development whatsoever which makes the last half of the movie pointless because you really just don't care about anyone by that point. The only character we even slightly care about is Mike, the best friend of the ""bully"" because he's torn between doing the right thing and remaining loyal to his mentally unstable friend. Unfortunately, the film does little to actually develop any sense of real friendship between the two that would actually make us care about any sort of unraveling of that friendship.

Finally, to add insult to injury, we're left with a horribly cliche' news report to sum up the horrors we just witnessed and proceed to editorialize how it's all this exposure to mass media that has corrupted our children and turned them into monsters. Nothing grates on my nerves more than a director who thinks that they need to summarize how we're supposed to feel about what we just watched and this film is a prime example of that.

Anyway, feel free to watch if there's absolutely nothing else in your playlist, but be prepared for a disappointing execution of a halfway decent idea.",1422662400,4,1815,4.773885350318471

4401383,2,B004LGGXHI,"I gave the movie two stars because the title implied it was about a bully. The movie is actually about a mentally unstable racist who commits a violent murder with a less dominant counterpart.  Although the acting was good it was over the top with American Patriotism and the effect the news can have on the younger generation.  For kids to carry that type of racism it usually is taught by the very family and community they live in not the television set. There are murders being committed across the county involving hate crimes whether they be racist, religious differences or focused on the transgender. It is truly a problem.

This movie over simplified a complex problem without exposing the root causes that nurture and allow the hatred to grow. By doing so it glosses over the problem instead of treating it with the seriousness it deserves.",1419292800,,850,4.7687074829931975
4401384,1,B004LGGXHI,This movie sucked and made a mockery of the horror of 9/11. I cannot believe they allowed this even to be shown.

8434356,4,B004LGGXHI,"Perhaps the actors were not star quality and the direction academy award winning, but the idea behind the movie was spot on. I felt like I was watching the whole thing on a home movie showing. Since we can't seem to NOT film everything that happens to us during a day, we certainly would want to have a record of something this mind blowing.

When I was in school, many moons ago, the cops would bring movies of horrific car accidents in the hopes that we would drive slower and without drinking.  Didn't seem to change many minds. This movie might be a good substitute in this era. I'm sure a room full of teens would think that they don't know anyone that could such horrible things, but they just might. If only one person can watch this and see how easy it is to go from thinking about doing something to doing it, then it would be worth the time spent.

Adults could benefit as well. Kids have to be given the inner strength to stand up for what they know is right. To be able to say no and stick with your conviction. We should all be better informed about what's going on in the world and more importantly what's going on in our homes.  I'm sure none of the parents could have imagined that their child could participate in this scenario. That's what we hear after every mass shooting.",1527379200,,1292,4.3264462809917354
