8759453,3,B01ERRG0CS,"This mostly high-quality and very interesting English-language documentary provides a glimpse into whats happening at Wudang today. The Daoist counterpart to the Buddhist Shaolin Temple in the history, folklore, and legends of Chinese martial arts, Wudang is once again gaining equal stature. Those familiar with these arts or Mandarin Chinese may have some criticisms, but most will still find this interesting.

The film takes an uncritical approach to recent tourism-focused development at Wudang, and to the rediscovered traditions now combined there into a modern syncretism of religion, martial arts, health cultivation, and mediation techniques that advocates often claim without much evidence to be hundreds or even thousands of years old. And then there's the truly ancient Chinese pursuit of immortality; apparently that's still a thing. This approach results in somewhat superficial reporting on many of the topics, but there is only so much that can be delved into within an hour or so, and masters who have devoted their lives to teaching and upkeep of key Wudang traditions receive positive and respectful coverage.

Anyone who has even passing familiarity with these arts or the language will wince at the otherwise professional English-speaking narrators repeated mispronunciation of the ""Tai"" in ""Tai-chi"" as Dai. His small struggles with other Chinese terms are more acceptable, but theres no excuse for that one. (Its actually ""T'ai"" in the old Wade-Giles system they chose to use. Using the apostrophe correctly in the script they gave him, or better yet using Pinyin, might have prevented this.) There are also a few problems in the translation subtitles during interviews of Chinese speakers, but I encourage you to persevere. It is unfortunately all too common in many businesses to rely upon staff members who speak both languages well but also have other responsibilities, rather than hiring professional translators. Im guessing that is what happened here. I got past it, but whatever was saved in time and money by this approach cheapens an otherwise professional production.

Left entirely unmentioned is extensive Chinese and Western scholarship that clearly shows Taijiquan and most other arts taught at Wudang today did not actually originate there. Discussions of this history could fill volumes, and youll find plenty of footnotes in Wikipedia articles on Wudang Quan and related topics if you're interested. Overall this is an enjoyable video with something for everyone. For one thing, this foreign devil found that Daoist horsetail whisk (fchn) way !",1465948800,8,2586,5.4278606965174125
