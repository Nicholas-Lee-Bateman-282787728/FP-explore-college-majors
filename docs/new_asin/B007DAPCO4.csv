8514912,5,B007DAPCO4,"Fast paced, well acted, gritty and intelligent.....I watched this over 1 weekend!!
It surpasses most North American drama in its ability to offer the viewer complex concurrent stories with characters that have depth as well as flaws. I loved this series.",1386720000,,254,5.219512195121951
8514913,4,B007DAPCO4,"This is pretty entertaining for about 2-1/2 seasons.  After that, watching supposedly responsible adults make a dog's breakfast of their private and professional lives gets tedious, boring and predictable.  The crime and the detective work take a back (far back) seat.  While it is an intellectual change attempting understand the bureaucratic structure and relationships of the French justice system, I hope for the sake of French friends and acquaintances I've had that this fictional tale has no remote basis in reality.",1382659200,,523,5.432098765432099
8514914,2,B007DAPCO4,"Purchased it after reading somewhere that it was as good as ""The Wire"".  Not even close!  I wanted to polish up my French language skilld before heading to Paris and Provence next month.  But this did not hold my interest enough.",1375228800,,229,4.536585365853658
8514915,4,B007DAPCO4,Good story line and an interesting insight on the French criminal justice system.  I hope that a  lot of what is depicted is French theatrical.,1367712000,,143,4.68
8514916,5,B007DAPCO4,"The acting is superb - you totally believe in the characters and they are much more real than in American police shows. You see much more of their personal lives and it is often not pretty.  One of the lead detectives is sexually involved with superiors, subordinates and co-workers and behaves in ways that at times have compromised investigations.  Another detective is using cocaine and staying with a prostitute and thereby compromises an investigation and he is not fired or demoted.  The other characters yell at him and tell him to get himself cleaned up. Characters have bitter fights and say ugly things to each other, but risk their lives and careers to stand behind each other, even defending major mistakes. The differences in the French legal system are also interesting.  With the exception of the police, very few of the other legal roles are like those in the American and British common law system. I watched the first three seasons pretty rapidly, and I am eagerly awaiting season 4 (just completed) and an upcoming season 5.",1363996800,5,1043,4.875706214689266
8514917,5,B007DAPCO4,"I watch a lot of crime shows, including the UK ones and now the other European ones, such as THE KILLING, THE EAGLE, and THE BRIDGE. Now there is this French series, in French language with English subtitles, which comes in right at the top of the heap of all crime shows. (I watched all three seasons on Netflix instant, which also has THE EAGLE).

What this show achieves is the French criminal department in its entirety. I say department because the linking of the police, lawyers and prosecutors and judges is much different from the UK and USA. It is as if they are all one department, all working together or at cross purposes. The action is located in one building in Paris and then out on the streets.  In that one building are all of these characters, the police, the prosecutors, the lawyers, the judges.

The biggest difference of all is that judges are involved in the directing and solving of cases and indeed one of the very best characters is Francois Roban, a magistrate who handles some of the biggest cases and works closely with a French police captain, a woman, Laure. Pierre, a prosecutor, also works with them until he is eventually forced into private practice.  He joins forces with a woman defense lawyer who gives him an eye opening view of what it is really like to work with hard core criminals.

I think the rights of the accused must be less in France than they are in the USA. In one episode for example there was going to be a rape trial even though there was absolutely no forensic evidence whatsoever to support that charge.  In fact, the only evidence was that the two people knew one another and had spent a night sleeping in the same apartment.  There was no proof of anything else and no hope of obtaining any.  This could have never gotten so far along in an American courtroom as the rights of the accused would have torpedoed its going forward.

There is no glamorizing of anything in this series. It does not sugar coat anything. It blows shows like Law & Order, which I normally enjoy, right out of the water.  This is fascinating stuff and it will keep you riveted for hours.

8514918,5,B007DAPCO4,"This review is from: Spiral: Series 1-3 Box Set [DVD] (DVD)

The French have made some great gangster/police films over the years and it looks like they are now producing a TV cop show to match. Spiral is clearly influenced by both the Wire and the Shield yet it is no mere 'knock off. The show remains very French. All three seasons start with the discovery of a body and an investigation by what must be the scruffiest coppers in any TV show. No French Chic here.

The show also goes into the working of the French legal system, but don't worry a lack of knowledge of what the different legal officers does will not spoil your viewing. However it does appear that some French judges are more like an American DA than someone who presides over a trial.

This show will also take you to a Paris the tourist never sees. Not many shots of the Eiffel Tower or the Sacre Cour here.

Better than any current US or UK cop show and only matched by the recent Swedish productions of Wallander. Beware however much of the violence and it's results are not for the squeamish.

All three seasons are great but each is also better than those which went before.",1333584000,10,1148,4.39622641509434
