2333176,5,B0009X77G8,DVD exactly as advertised & in perfect condition.  Great gift for our 5-year-old daughter (a professed future-farmer)!,1199059200,,118,5.9411764705882355
2333177,1,B0009X77G8,"I thought I could not go wrong for my toddler who loves Old MacDonald and anything related to farms. This video is awful. Even for the low price point.

This was such a weird video. It was more like an instructional for someone who wanted to run a farm and did not even have the Old MacDonald song in it except a small instrumental at the beginning. It was geared towards much much older kids- not the typical toddler/pre-school age of kids who like Old MacDonald. I.e there is a whole section with a too long diatribe about keeping the chicken coop clean so the chickens don't get sick and die- not age appropriate. The actors are creepy and the beginning is a whole 10 minute thing where they try to set up who the head of the farm is and the management of a farm and this strange lecture. Little kids just want to see the animals!

I honestly don't think my son (age 3) will ever watch this again. My husband and I could not even sit through it and fast forwarded through almost everything to find something remotely interesting for our son to watch.",1193443200,2,1053,4.340101522842639

2333179,5,B0009X77G8,"This is the only dvd my son will actually sit down and watch. He loves the Old McDonald part of the dvd. I just wonder what kind of farm Old McDonald runs because when Farmer Joe talks about what a tractor does, he states ""pulls cars outta ditches"". Classic! I've seen this masterpiece about 10 times and I haven't gotten tired of it yet! I wish I could only find more dvds that had Old McDonald and Farmer Joe in them.",1183248000,7,419,4.185185185185185
2333180,4,B0009X77G8,I have yet to find a video that actually keeps my 3 year olds attention the entire time but he does like this one. The only thing I don't like is that it doesn't have continuous play! I think all DVD's should just automatically do this. My son likes the farm side versus the horse side!,1180051200,2,286,4.125
2333181,5,B0009X77G8,"If you have a child or are a child at heart that loves tractors, buy this DVD. My son loves it and watches it daily!",1179964800,,116,3.68
2333182,5,B0009X77G8,"Ever since we watched the Rose Bowl parade my daughter has been pointing to the TV and saying ""horses"" (she is only 18 months)  I was really grateful to find this DVD.  The horse section of this DVD is perfect because all of the narration is accompanied by video footage of horses.  No talking heads just horses! Yea!  It also uses the ABCs to talk about different horse terms ie ""A is for Arabian.""  I would reccommend it for anyone who needs a good all horses, all the time DVD.  I can't speak to the ""All about the Farm"" section b/c we are too busy watching horses.",1173139200,3,568,4.261682242990654
2333183,5,B0009X77G8,"This is a great video.  My son loves horses and tractors.  The video goes from A-Z giving facts about horses.  The section on farms is very fun and shows a real working farm.  I really like this video but I have borrowed others from the ""All About"" series and have not cared for them at all.",1168473600,,291,4.142857142857143
2333215,4,B0009X77G8,"My three-year old adores this video, probably because it reminds him of his grandparents' farm in IL. The best way to describe this DVD is ""awesomely awful."" The video quality is poor, the host is cheesy, but there is something very charming about it. With all of the fantasy videos kids watch, this one actually teaches kids that hard work is a reality of our world. Other than the host, everyone else are real farmers and there is something cool about how awkward they are in front of the camera.

Make no mistake, this DVD is not high quality. However, your kid will love it, they will learn something, and you can make fun of it MST3K style.",1375833600,,645,4.466101694915254
2333216,4,B0009X77G8,Our granddaughter lived it. She dances and sings along with it daily. Its great to pass on the historical and old family favorites to our youngsters.,1367452800,,149,4.769230769230769
2333217,5,B0009X77G8,My grandson is a tractor fanatic. He loves to see tractors plow. And he likes the horses on this very good video. It teaches a child what really happens on on the farm,1361577600,,167,4.090909090909091
2333218,1,B0009X77G8,This would be good but they call a hay roller a grass cutter. Why didn't someone catch this mistake it's a big one.,1349654400,,115,4.043478260869565
2333219,2,B0009X77G8,This was filmed in the 19th century and is so old school!  Its very outdated and filming is poor quality.  my son still likes it but its annoying to listen to in the background as a parent.  I'd find something else.,1336953600,,215,4.195121951219512
2333220,4,B0009X77G8,"My two year old son loves this video and will watch it over and over and over again.  We adults have even learned a thing or two about cows, chickens, horses and more.",1301788800,,167,4.0606060606060606
2333221,5,B0009X77G8,"My 3-4 year old just loves these series and will sit for hours if we let him as he watches them.  I have to say that he does learn things on them all.  It does give a good overview of things he sees like trucks, ships, etc.  Same with this one too on the farm.  Good that this one doesn't have Hard Hat Harry and has another actor in this series...change is good!",1296345600,,363,3.9315068493150687
2333222,2,B0009X77G8,"We live on a farm, and this may be, as far as learning, the worst video I have ever seen.  However our two year old daughter asks for it by name, ""FARM"", every day.  If you're looking for something useful, stay away.  If you just need a distraction to get dinner fixed, it's worth the cost.",1295395200,,290,4.142857142857143
2333223,4,B0009X77G8,I purchased this for my 2 1/2 year old grandson who is crazy about horses and tractors.  He is fascinated by it and asks to watch it over and over again.  I'm glad that it teaches something about farms and horses without the glitz of animation or cartoons.,1271203200,,256,4.3125
2333224,3,B0009X77G8,I purchased this along with the all about John Deere. The cover looks cute but the editing and the excitement is not great.  My son loves farms and tractors but didn't love this one.  Spend a little extra and get the John Deere dvd's my son loves them we have several copies. This one is ok but cheaper made.,1264982400,,308,4.203389830508475
8069213,5,B0009X77G8,The kids love the dvd,1468195200,,21,3.4
8069214,4,B0009X77G8,"I think this is one of the corniest videos I have ever bothered to watch.  It reminds me of something I would have had to watch in grade school.  My 2 yr old daughter, however, is absolutely addicted to this video. In fact, this is the second time I have had to buy it. The first disk got badly scratched and she had a complete meltdown when it would freeze up.  But she would get hysterical if I took the video away from her.  Since the poor kid has been recovering from a trampoline-related broken leg, I obliged her and replaced this movie just in time for her to discover a similar one about trains.",1446336000,,603,4.217391304347826
8069215,1,B0009X77G8,Not for farm kids,1432684800,,17,3.5
8069216,1,B0009X77G8,"As a farmer, this video gets so much information wrong it's unbelievable. I think they had one day to film this. Why else would someone plough in a field that's under 6"" of water.",1418774400,,179,4.294117647058823
8069217,3,B0009X77G8,Our two-year-old immensely enjoyed the horse portion during his horse-interest days.  But there is so much information in the farm portion that is incorrect that it seems inappropriate to let him watch it.,1410566400,,205,5.212121212121212
8069218,5,B0009X77G8,The kiddies LOVE this video!,1396137600,,28,4.8
8069219,4,B0009X77G8,"My grandkids are 2 and 4 years old and they really liked the Horses DVD. It showed all types of horses and how to care for them. It is educational but very relaxing for any age.
 The farm DVD was good too but not as spellbinding as the horses.",1389830400,,243,3.9591836734693877
8069220,5,B0009X77G8,"Despite the fact that the production quality is terrible.  (Was everything really that blurry in the '90's?)  The content entertains my two year old over and over again.  This short film was available for streaming on Netflix and when it became unavailable, I didn't hesitate to buy the DVD.  After probably having seen it 30 times, my son still asks for it.",1389052800,,358,4.725806451612903
8069221,5,B0009X77G8,Good fun farm video.  It's a little dated but that's kind of cool in itself.  They really show and demonstrate some of the more less known farm equipment.,1388793600,,154,4.464285714285714
8069222,5,B0009X77G8,"I think my nephew wore this DVD out he watched it so much, not one of those that parents can't stand the repetition.",1386288000,,116,4.086956521739131
