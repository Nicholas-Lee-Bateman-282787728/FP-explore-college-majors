8224196,4,B000WMEAWK,I am an avid collector of A Christmas Carol movies. This is an outstanding performance by Professor Engel that all fans of A Christmas Carol will enjoy. It is a must add to your collection. My only complaint is not with the performance but rather the quality of the recording. The DVD recording is really poor. There are lines running across the screen and jumpiness throughout which make for an unpleasant viewing. I don't understand how in this day and age someone could release such a poor quality DVD. The technology to clean it up is available. I already returned three copies hoping to get one that is a bit more watchable than the previous copies. I hope the problem is addressed with future releases.,1520380800,,708,4.672
8224197,5,B000WMEAWK,I am an avid collector of all Christmas Carol versions and this one adds to my collection nicely.  Don't expect your typical Christmas carol movie with this dvd.  It is a one man play.  The actor portrays Charles Dickens in his study and how it might have been as he came up with the ideal of this play and put it down on paper.  It is actually quite good and interesting.  The set and clothes are true to the era.,1388880000,2,414,4.125
8224198,5,B000WMEAWK,"I am a huge fan of A Christmas Carol, I have collected every available rendering with the exception of the ballet. I had ""The Night Before Christmas Carol"" on my Amazon wish list for years but was sceptical. I do so hate poor performances of the classics. I was Overwhelmingly pleased with how well this was made. It was captivating and smart and funny and a pleasure to watch. Any Dickens fan will appreciate and treasure it!",1287532800,,426,4.545454545454546
8224199,4,B000WMEAWK,"My husband collects ""Christmas Carol"" versions and it is getting harder and harder to find him something new each year. After reading the review already posted, I figured, ""Why not?"" and gave it a try.  We were so pleasantly surprised and completely entertained by the performance on this video.  My husband says he is very proud to add this to his collection and feels it will certainly be one that is watched again...maybe even several times.  It is a version we would highly recommend to the serious collector!",1262131200,2,513,4.806818181818182
8224200,5,B000WMEAWK,"I bought this DVD merely because I've started collecting various versions of ""A Christmas Carol"" - not because I thought this version would be particularly well worth watching, other than to compare it to other versions, and for the sake of satisfying my curiosity.  When I saw the picture of it on Amazon.com, with its black and white sketch for a cover, I assumed that it was a low-budget version that I wouldn't like.  When I received my copy of it, and saw that the DVD and its cover seemed to be homemade, my presumption seemed reinforced.

This presumption continued to be reinforced when I started watching it, and saw that the show was a one-man show on a theatrical stage.

However, as I continued to watch this one-man show, I found myself amazed again and again by how well Jeffery West acted, and by how well he recreated and gave life to the characters in ""A Christmas Carol,"" including female characters!  Merely using ""household items"" and sheer acting ability!  He made me feel as if I were ""there,"" so to speak, without any special video effects - just simple stage techniques, such as dimming and raising the lights.  I still can't believe how well he pulled this off, and will watch this version again and again for the sheer entertainment value of it!

I've already lent this DVD to two of my friends, a man and a woman, both of whom have college degrees and are professional musicians, and they both agreed that Jeffery West's performance is excellent!

Of all the versions of ""A Christmas Carol"" I've seen (and I've seen and own over two dozen of them), I consider this one to be the one that features the best acting.  If you admire the art of acting, and/or enjoy a well-produced version of ""A Christmas Carol,"" I guarantee you will enjoy this version.  Unless you already own a copy of this movie, if you are, like me, collecting different movie versions of ""A Christmas Carol,"" this one belongs near the top of your wish list!",1231891200,5,1952,4.596541786743516
