There's no reason these benefits should be enjoyed only by adults, so I strongly endorse Beth Reese's programs - they bring yoga to children in an easy, accessible format. The fact that she leads sessions in a world-class museum, surrounded by great works of ancient Indian and Asian art, makes them all the more enriching and valuable."" ~ Andrew Weil, M.D.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yogios-Yoga-for-Youth-DVD-The-Story-of-Ganesha/dp/B003PCS5Y8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yogios: Yoga for Youth DVD, The Story of Ganesha</a>",1335830400,,659,6.662790697674419
