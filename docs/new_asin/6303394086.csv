From Memphis to Morocco, San Diego to Singapore, he has played with everyone, everywhere, on all the world's greatest courses. His foursomes have included presidents, kings, top golf pros, movie stars, comedians and other world class celebrities...

Hope is one of the foremost proponents of the game and has contributed immensely to the popularity of golf- both as a participant and as a spectator. So it is little wonder that his very first feature ""video"" would be about the game he loves so well. Incidentally, soon after completing this tape,Bob, at the young age of 90-plus, had a hole-in-one while playing with friends in Palm Springs, California!

Shanks for the Memory is a visual treasure of the world of golf according to Bob Hope.
