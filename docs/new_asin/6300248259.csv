7806915,1,6300248259,"Latino is not the best film about the war between the Reagan government and the Sandinistas in Nicaragua in the 1980s. My favorite film on that war is Under Fire (1983) directed by Ron Shelton and starring Nick Nolte, Gene Hackman, Joanna Cassidy and Ed Harris. I lived in Nicaragua for several months after the war ended. Nicaragua is a country with beautiful lakes and many volcanoes. The American supported dictator Somoza did nothing to remove the rubble of an earthquake in Managua, the capital city. After the Sandinistas won the war they cleaned up Managua and built parks.
Don't miss Oliver Stone's film Salvador with James Woods and James Belushi, the best of the three mentioned here. The wars in El Salvador and Nicaragua were funded by the US government, which hired mercenaries who killed many peasants. Reagan funded the wars in Central America by selling arms to Iran, which was opposed by Congress (known as Iran-Contra). Thousands of peasants in both countries were killed by our government and their proxies while pretending they were winning the war against Communism.
You will see very little of Nicaragua or El Salvador in any of these films because there are only two countries that have a large enough film industry to make a film like these: the US and Mexico. Latino has actors that look like Central Americans,but they mostly speak English (very few people in that area speak English fluently). I guess that Latino was filmed mostly in Hollywood.
Under Fire was filmed primarily at Mexican sites that look like they could be in Nicaragua and El Salvador and, except for the American actors, they speak Spanish.",1368748800,3,1636,4.909747292418772
7806916,5,6300248259,"This movie is highly political and got a lot of flack from the establishment when it was released.  It is quite possibly based on a true story, in my opinion, but there is no way to verify that.  Thought provoking! ""Unrated"" but I'll give it an ""R"" rating, or at least a ""PG-13"" (war violence, language, nudity, sexual situations).",1336003200,2,331,4.593220338983051
7806917,5,6300248259,I wish more people had a chance to see this film when Haskel Wexler made it in the mid 80's. It's a good depiction of what the Nicaraguan people struggled with in the immediate years following the success of the revolution. I found it much better than the Hollywood made Under Fire.,1335657600,,282,4.4423076923076925
7806918,5,6300248259,"it's a good movie, it really describes the other side of the story, the soldier side, this chicanos US soldiers sent to nicaragua to train the contras and forced to fight without their dog tags cause US didn't want dead american soldiers in a nicaraguan civil war, that made them feel like they were not doing the right thing and they shouldn't even be there, it was a real story, i'm Costa Rican and i know some central-american history, i remember about this nicaraguan civil war, but i didn't know USA was financing the contras, interesting story, it would be better to read about the contra and sandinistas history before watching this movie, cause it'll help you understand it better, cause i think that in the movie is not very clear which side of that civil war was the right side. i liked it.",1326585600,4,800,4.5625
7806919,3,6300248259,"Judge Russell Engebretson, DVD Verdict-- The story has all the elements needed for a rousing, suspenseful war drama: romance with a woman who sympathizes with the declared enemy, duty versus moral choice, witness to brutal torture and murder, a running gun battle in a small village, and realistic depiction of guerrilla warfare. The problem is that none of the story elements hang together all that well. The movie is coherent and presents a clear picture of what is going on in post-Somoza Nicaragua, but it does not propel the viewer into the story; it does not, for the most part, create a passionate sense of outrage that should be building throughout the film. There are a few very good scenes which are engaging and disturbing: the torture and attempted brainwashing of a young village boy; the casual rape and murder of peasants suspected of harboring Sandinista rebels; the attack on an unarmed village. However, a few good scenes do not a good movie make.

I don't fault the acting, although it rarely rises above a workman-like level; the understated performances help to reinforce the documentary feel of the movie.

The editing may contribute to the film's lack of forward momentum. The jumps between locations in Honduras and Nicaragua serve the important romantic subplot, but also defuse the tension of the Nicaraguan scenes

The most fascinating aspect of Latino is that it was actually filmed in Nicaragua during the time it portrays. Real villagers and Sandinista fighters were used during the shooting, some of whom had freshly experienced events similar to those depicted in the film. Wexler relates several stories of the hardships endured by the cast and crew during the filming in what was, quite literally, a war zone--a case of genuine guerrilla filmmaking.

Audio is a lackluster but serviceable Dolby Digital stereo track. The picture is simply terrible. I've seen worse, but there is no getting around the fact that this is a subpar transfer

7806920,5,6300248259,"Make no mistake this is a film that involves a political war and a small piece of history that most of us won't be aware of but while the story itself is made up the facts of what occurred is real.
Robert Beltran gives a great performance of a Latino green beret who comes to question his assignment and ultimately wakes up the viewer to ask themselves if what the government is doing at any given time the right thing. After all we are only told bits and pieces of these things and films such as this one help to clarify. To bad it's only available on vhs.",1200700800,6,557,4.166666666666667
7806921,4,6300248259,"A film passed over. Theme of the movie shows U.S. as the bad boy
on the block.  That is why it got very little notice, hardly
available and who would care, except left wing radicals who
care about social injustice perpetrated by the Empire against
the people shown clearly in the film.  I wondered how the movie
got made in the first place given the anti-US slant. The scenes
were enlightening and the somewhat filmy/grainy visual effect
added to the surreal quality.  Very scarry. Characters were a
back drop to the theme. I was afraid of the CIA barging into my
home to confiscate the video and taking me in for questioning
as to why I was watching this film as they pulled my finger nails
out and my arms out of their sockets.  Few have knowledge of this
movie and the U.S. government is happy to keep it that way.",1022630400,7,817,4.3907284768211925
