Gonna be ordering this again to replace the case(which no longer closes) and the CDS(which got scratched up when the case stopped closing properly).",1381449600,,272,4.934782608695652
8017283,5,B0001WTW24,"This item contains six of the episodes that lead up to the season finale of Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon S, which I loved watching on Cartoon Network when a was younger. Every time I watch this DVD, I remember how I watched the episodes on TV with my Aunt, and it's a good memory, especially because my aunt likes Mimet's personality. If anyone is a fan of Sailor Moon, I highly recommend buying this DVD.",1280361600,4,403,4.386666666666667
