5722255,3,B00CHMBQ7K,"Our LO saw a few clips on Disney Junior and absolutely FELL IN LOVE with the small potatoes and their music. When I saw this on Amazon I was SO excited. The movie is okay but definitely more grown-up than I expected it to be, especially since the bits that were shown on Disney Jr. seemed to be aimed at a much younger audience. The movie is basically about a rock band (Small Potatoes), how they formed, various drama that occurs, how they fell apart and eventually reunite. Essentially it is the basic ""rock band story"" and my LO lost interest fairly quickly with the movie, but she still LOVES the little clips on Disney Jr. Every now and then I'll still turn it on for her, but it was definitely not the very upbeat, happy-go-lucky, small children movie I expected.",1429574400,,769,4.460992907801418

5722272,5,B00CHMBQ7K,"Meet the small potatoes is the best movie ever! Me and my friend watched this because it was a special on Comcast, and I knew I had to buy it!!! I would recommend this to people of all ages, even tho it's intended for little kids. I showed this to my mom, my grandma, my 7 year old brother and each one of them loved it! It's REALLY clever, and super funny. I don't understand how anyone could give this film a rating less than 5 stars. The songs are really catchy, and I love their British accents!",1388534400,5,499,4.1020408163265305

8581802,5,B00CHMBQ7K,"Came across this jem while flipping through Netflix one day while I was have a couple 'glasses' of wine with my cat, for no reason anyways, ya know. Decided to give it a chance, because what else would you be doing on a Tuesday eating tuna again? I haven't decided wether this films supposed to make me cry, but years of therapy will only tell. It's charming, funny, slightly aurousing (in a good way), romantic, chilling, jaw dropping beauty that only can be experienced, not seen. Maybe Ellen should pick this one up and talk about it for the show. That would make it popular for sure. End of review.",1490140800,,602,4.4818181818181815

8581805,5,B00CHMBQ7K,"Watched this on Netflix for a laugh and ended up loving it enough to buy it. A hard hitting documentary about the world famous Small Potatoes with Beatles and doors influences. Meet The Small Potatoes is a rare breed in an age of Hollywood projectile vomiting out garbage children's movies for profit. The film presents a premise that is extrodinarily imaginative while still pulling inspirations from real life. If you're like me and are not looking for a movie for your kids. Don't worry, The Small Potatoes have you covered the movie will leave you with a barage of extistintial questions about the world of these potatoes. Such as how can they talk, why are the potatoes the size of a small child, do humans still eat potatoes? Is that not a terrifying world for these plants to live in? The potatoes song about eating fruit and it would appear this is something akin to cannibalism. Does this movie intend to promote that? Are the French fries in the movie just young potato burn victims? Why would they show that to such a young audience? It would appear the potatoes can have parents leading to the question.. How? Like really how does that work? Are there potato genders are there interspecies relationships? Also where do their mouth holes go? How do they digest food? As well as the movie presnting potato of different races, I support the representation but how did this come to be? Is there potato racism? Potato body standards influencing young potato viewers everywhere. And not to reopen the box of potatoes but seriously if anyone knows how? How on earth do potatoes make or North children?? The synopsis implies they sprung from the ground but there are references to childhood, parental figures in The Small Potatoes life. Is their reproduction asexual can potatoes love or feel pain? Once the band becomes irrelevant in modern music will they face the same tragic fate as their young French fry brethren? All pressing questions to potato lovers everywhere although sadly most go unanswered or more likely go unasked by any sane person just trying to watch a Damn kids movie. Perhaps akin to the immortal style of Miusakki the creators who birthed these potatoes wanted to maintain an element of mystery to the small potatoes world. Perhaps the film means to leave these questions unanswered. Whether that is to spare us from the truth behind a dystopian world of produce abuse and enslavement for the human race or more likely to leave the unfinished corners up to the vivid imaginations of the adults and children alike in order to paint a new experience for every viewer of every background. Perhaps it is a gift a gift of love and creation only true small potatoes and the pure of heart and mind will be able to fully appreciate. These small potatoes bounce? Walk maybe Or fly I'm not sure how they move.. But anyways these small potatoes will fill your t.v. with something worthwhile something made with a purpose and without greed or corporate cynicism. For once in your life stop allowing the mediocre and take a chance. A chance on the small potatoes. Take from them what you may this is only the opinion of one but I think maybe what you see will suprise you at the very least and maybe just maybe it'll touch your heart and give you the strength to face another day in this sad and angry world.
Got help you if you read the whole review there's almost certainly something more productive you should be doing. In all seriousness this movie is refreshingly good and you'll win major brownie points from the kiddos once they grow up to be rad AF or simply impress your stoner friend(s) with a movie that'll relate to the potato inside of is all.
Support this masterpiece and tell your mom you spent up to 30$ on a movie about drug culture influenced rockin roll star potatoes They'll never be prouder.
Pro tip:( to be an extra groovy parental follow this movie up with the doors documentary (warning does contain nudity, copious drug use, sexual content, and general grooviness) kool ass kids should develop in two to six weeks. If your children start asking questions as to why the potatoes are doing illegal drugs simply return child to sender and you'll receive your favorite small potato for your very own! Free of charge!",1475712000,2,4251,4.707382550335571

8581809,3,B00CHMBQ7K,"This is really for adults - small kids do not have the attention span nor sense of humor for this video.  I thought it was cute, but it is nothing like the little bits seen on the kid's channel.",1449100800,,194,3.9743589743589745
