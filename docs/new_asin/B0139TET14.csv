7360810,5,B0139TET14,"I was flipping channels and happened upon this documentary--I couldn't stop watching. Stayed up WAY past my bedtime. Truly a horror story, brilliantly produced.

I didn't know, for instance, that LRH started his career as a pulp sci-fi writer, but it makes sense now--Scientology is pure science fiction. In this expose, we learn that he REALLY BELIEVED that the universe was created by a galactic overlord named XENU and 75,000 million years ago people looks much like they did in the 1950's--if that doesn't tell you how truly nuts he was, nothing will.

But I don't get the title--The Prison of Belief? Is their point that all belief in bad? Scientology is NOT a religion. Its use of the word ""church"" is completely false. Hubbard's main intent from the beginning was to make money by scamming millions--that is NOT what religion is about. Say what you want about Christianity, but Jesus' followers weren't in it for profit. Most of them gave up not only all their earthly wealth but their very lives for their faith. The Prison in this case is not Belief or Faith, but in WHAT you believe in. It really does matter, and there really is a difference.

There's one point in which John Travolta, with a beatific smile on his face (and incidentally wearing a combat uniform) waxes poetic about Scientology being all about love and peace (a world without war!) and joy and blah blah blah. And then he says (with a straight face) ""tell me another religion that's founded on those principles?"" (paraphrase) HELLO???? EARTH TO BARBARINO!!!! Have you never heard of Jesus Christ??

Travolta and Cruise come off as total Scientology Bimbos in this movie, as well they should. They watch their friends be abused and imprisoned and do nothing to intervene. They keep spouting the party line despite all the organization's blatant crimes, eerily reminiscent of Hitler's Germany. But it's clear they really CAN'T do anything, because the Organization has them by the short hairs. One of the really clever things the organization does is get people to totally confess their deepest darkest secrets (though this fake science thing called ""auditing"") and they keep these secrets on file for insurance against anyone tries to turn on them--I bet Hitler wishes he'd thought of that one.

Or maybe those two really have drunk the Kool-Aid.

Anyway, bravo to those who did come forward to tell the truth about this horrific organization, risking their lives (literally). I do wonder, though, why Paul Haggis, after knowing everything the organization was doing, was finally sent over the edge by their opposition to Gay Marriage. Really Paul? The abuse, the scams, the lies, the strong-arming, the smear campaigns, the enslavement, the extortions, the mind control, the unadulterated EVIL of this group wasn't enough for you?",1441238400,66,2808,4.989316239316239

I was actually shocked by the use of information gleaned from supposedly confidential auditing sessions to intimidate and blackmail ordinary Scientologists and particularly celebrities, like Tom Cruise. That the higher up used Cruises auditing sessions to destroy his relationship with non-Scientologist Nicole Kidman and manipulate their relationship with their two children was also shocking. The final shock was seeing the Church of Scientology's Annual Meetings, which were like something out of Nazi German, but with tuxedos rather than uniforms. I came away thinking that Scientology is a sick, greedy and selfish, and destructive cult. I feel sorry for those caught in its insidious web.",1528761600,,763,5.52991452991453

7360825,5,B0139TET14,"I only wished there was more than just the documentary on this DVD. I have been riveted by Leah Remini's series on Scientology with Mark Rinder who appeared in the documentary. Of course, the documentary covers Tom Cruise more than John Travolta. Spanky Taylor was Travolta's assistant for years. Her story is both shocking and horrifying but all true. Unlike Cruise, Travolta has downplayed his relationship with scientology in recent years. John is still a member of the church but not actively promoting it to the public like Cruise. Tom Cruise's relationship with scientology is particularly troubling in the least.

The other former scientologists in the film recall their history, lives and encounters with the church from a promising beginning to troubling departures which are modern day escapes. The documentary is only two hours but I wished it lasted longer. I was riveted by the former scientologists who confessed their roles in the church. Scientology must be the most troubling and disturbing cult in recent history. L. Ron Hubbard based a life on lies and delusions. His successor, David Miscavige, has been more troubling, disturbing, abusive and violent towards other scientologists. I find Miscavige to be the root of evil in this organization.

David's wife, Shelly, has been out of sight for over a decade. Her sudden absence at Tom and Kate's wedding in Italy awakened Leah Remini. Many of the scientologists were lured by doing good for the world and their lives. Many of the former scientologists have lost money, relationships and education as well but they were also abused in all forms.

I wished the documentary DVD came with special features about the participants and their lives. There could even a link to a website for more on scientology.",1524355200,,1772,5.082474226804123

This film is very informative, but definitely NOT for kids. There's no sexual nudity or anything, but some brief scenes from the controversial film ""Eyes Wide Shut"" are included, and a lot of the subject matter is mentally and emotionally disturbing. That said, its supposed to be...because the documentary's purpose is to expose the horrors of a cult started and spread by pathological liars and thieves. Originally founded on Satanism and currently disguised as a tax-exempt ""religion"", Scientology is actually a core-rotten business with two goals - steal as much money as possible, and silence all opposition. From prison camps staffed entirely by children and teenagers, to a doctrine of complete disconnection from anyone outside the so-called ""church"", and disgusting living conditions inflicted on abandoned infants - this is the kind of stuff that makes you squirm, but hopefully will also motivate you into action. Scientology is mental, emotional, and spiritual terrorism, both on American soil and around the world. Its most high-profile members are celebrities like Tom Cruise, Kirstie Alley, and John Travolta...who are either clueless about the truth, or fully aware yet choose to ignore it. The cult's current leader, David Miscavige, has repeatedly assaulted people who challenged his authority...and perhaps even killed others. But it all goes back to a deluded and selfish man named L. Ron Hubbard...who's been dead since 1986 while the horrendous cult he started continues to expand. Lives have been torn apart every day by this evil organization, since the 1950s...and it needs to end now. The first step is permanently revoking Scientology's tax-exempt status; they owe more than $1 billion to the IRS.",1509235200,,1830,5.376306620209059

There are so many aspects of this story that fascinate:  How otherwise intelligent people allow themselves to be captured by a mind-control regime.  How the aggressive campaign to recruit celebrities works.  How seemingly bottomless financial resources are used to sustain all sorts of abuses.  How the establishment clause of the first amendment is used to shield so many nefarious activies.  How families are destroyed.

Current independent estimates of the size of Scientology seem to be in the 30-50,000 range, so it can hardly be said to be a mass movement, and these days it can't be said to be growing, thanks at least partially to projects like this.

Or what if someone had held up Islam to this level of scrutiny and disbelief before it got rolling? Or Hinduism? Or any of the other leading ""Religions"" of the world. People often like to distance their particular ""Religion"" from a ""Cult"" but, in truth, all existing major world religions began as just another small cult of followers that blossomed, sought refuge and was allowed to grow into the megaliths they are today.

There's not really that much new information about the cult in this, unless you don't know anything about Scientology. I've been researching it for a while, because I wanted to understand why people willingly subject themselves to abuse and near-slavery for years. There are some really shocking stories about families being ripped apart by their policy of disconnection and they barely touched on that. The accounts of abuse they chose to detail were some of the more mild ones compared to other stories I've read about. Scientology has a lot of reclusive hideaways where no one really knows what's going on, but there are security gates, barbed wire fences, guard dogs, armed security teams, and cameras surrounding them. I was hoping they would get into what goes on there, but alas, no.",1501804800,,876,5.006849315068493
7360876,1,B0139TET14,"The movie begins with the narrator speaking about his interest in understanding why people are drawn to the teachings of Scientology. As the documentary continues, it's clear to see that the narrator uses the same format as others before him to deliver the same tired information. He begins with a smear campaign against L. Ron Hubbard and how off his rocker he clearly was. Then he gathers up a group of disgruntled ex-members of the church and gives them a soapbox to vent their grievances. While all this is going on, I can't help but to wonder where the proof to all of these allegations are. If the church of Scientology is as bad as he makes it to be, why has no one gone to the police with this? Not only that, the people that are being interviewed have made appearances on other Scientology documentaries and some news and talk shows as well. It just seems like these people are enjoying their 15 minutes of fame while making a few bucks at the same time. I can't prove that the information presented is right or wrong, but I have to wonder why is there such an attack on a religion that seemingly attempts to offer help and solutions to its members as a way to deal with every day lives? And I don't see why anyone should be upset if people are paying for the services. It's their money. They can do what they like with it. Other religious institutions do the same thing! And who cares if they truly believe they have to extract aliens from their body. Others believe in a zombie carpenter. It's hypocritical to say Scientologist are crazy without bunching in the rest of the world religious views. This movie is no more interesting than any other negative Scientology documentary out there. Same stories. Same people. Same lame information. This movie is not worth the watch... and besides, he never got around to answering his original question, why are people drawn to the philosophy?",1501459200,4,1896,4.595870206489676

The Sermon on the Mount, the teaching from Jesus, is all about making an individual have joy. The Beatitudes are not an easy concept, but when studied, and acted upon, an individual will have joy, an eternal joy. A joy that positively affects others.",1500076800,,487,4.597701149425287

7360882,4,B0139TET14,"I recommend this to anyone who has ever been interested by this, or other topics relating to cult like organizations. Unlike most productions on scientology survival, this contains stories from a handful of people who were in high positions of power within the organization. Instead of just regular, lower on the ladder members.
  Unfortunately, like all the other productions I've seen on the issue, this still leaves a lot of the more fascinating questions on the table. Specifically the belief system it all revolves around, and the details of what is at the top if the ladder. I suppose to spare the survivors further humiliation. They do touch on the basics, but if you have ever heard Leah remini talk at length about it, there is a lot more insanity to it than most are willing to discuss.
  Overall it is a good watch. Just a shame there is not yet a downfall of the organization to make these stories have a happy ending. Maybe we will see it in this lifetime.",1499558400,,969,4.616279069767442

7360891,5,B0139TET14,"Fantastic documentary about one of our more recent insidious and successful cults.  There is true genius in getting intelligent, self aware people to get sucked in to such rubbish.  L. Ron was truly despicable, but I'm pretty sure David Miscavige is the friggin antichrist. (Not literally.  I don't believe in boogeymen and fairy tales!)

L. Ron Hubbard, Joseph Smith, Mohammed: power mad schizophrenic con men with with a messiah complex among other serious psychiatric issues.  I'd even throw Jesus in there too, if I was 100% convinced he was a real guy.  At least he (allegedly) had a kinder, gentler side.  Anyone seeing a pattern here?

It's too bad that doing a similar expose of Dawa, the deliberate systematic spreading of Sharia and Islamism, would get you labeled a bigot in spite of it's equally noxious ideology.  This goal is openly and actively pursued by the Muslim Brotherhood and funded by the Saudis, who own/fund nearly 80% of all the mosques in Germany, and numbers nearly as great elsewhere.  Their funding is contingent on the promotion of Dawa, in which immigrants are encouraged not to assimilate in civil society so that the nations of the infidel can be Islamified.",1495843200,3,1192,4.944723618090452

Kudos to all those involved with this documentary that had the conviction  to  share their story after being involved for many years, and in the hope of preventing others from experiencing the abuses and trauma that they experienced.

My biggest surprise - I expected to feel bad for the former members being interviewed.  Instead I felt less and less sympathy as the documentary wound on.  I know the whole point of the documentary was to explore the idea of why intelligent people would fall into these entrapping and degrading beliefs... but I think there is and was a simple answer.  The world is full of the weak minded and the gullible.  Hubbard saw this and decided to prey on them.  His genius, if one can call it that, was to realize that rich successful people are skeptical of any solution that isn't somehow expensive, obscure, and not accessible to the masses.

So there you have it.  This documentary left me feeling flat - realizing that these people who deprogrammed got nothing at all from the experience, except perhaps realizing that they were gullible, stupid, and did terrible things (implied) to others simply because they were told to do so.",1484438400,,1196,4.818627450980392

It is extremely sad and disheartening that SO MANY have clearly lost their way in the involvement with this organization?  Common sense and decency dictate an awareness that MANY Scientology Church Doctrines and/or practices are just VERY BASIC crimes against humanity in any sense.
  Personally, I'm at a loss to understand how our government has NOT intervened thru thorough investigations & rather, allowed their immoral practices to continue ?  It's NOT a church or religion in any 'logical' sense at least?  Rather, it's got EVERY indication of being a lucrative cult and scam project preying on thousands and thousands of the planet's citizens,  whom in all likelihood, are otherwise decent human beings.  Very sad.  Wish there were avenues available to non-members made public where we could.provide help and support to a cause to bring this organization either down OR insure their practices could be cleaned up 2b ethical, moral AND SAFE to the mentality and emotional welfare of ALL those choosing to participate and LEAVE if they so choose, without retribution.

In my opinion no religion should be tax exempt - especially Scientology that does nothing to help the improve the human condition. Money taken in is used to enrich a few at the top. While the material here is shocking, and we get some good insight into why stars like Travolta, and Cruise remain committed (fear of exposure regarding secretes divulged in ""audits"", and massive ego building), still I cannot help but think of the abuses that have been exposed in other more traditional churches. The major difference is that while religions like Catholicism, Mormonism, etc. do work for good in communities, and worldwide - Scientology works only to enrich its top leaders, and abuse all others. I have never heard of ""Scientology Community Services"" or ""Scientology Housing First"" NOTHING - they contribute nothing to the communities in which they operate. That distinction alone should send the likes of Cruise, and Travolta running the other way.

But when I read Going Clear and saw the movie version, It really opened my eyes as to what some members were going through and the brain washing that occurred. The more I see some of the celeberties defending this organization the more I start to boycott their movies. I have looked to other religious organzations in my life time and have seen some that I feel are cults. I finally went back to my old church of Presbyterian values and have never regretted it.

He writes a book of faith and it sells well. Eventually the IRS is after him. He gets three ships and anoints himself as commodore. He gets some followers and heads to the Mediterranean Sea where he says he buried treasures in a possible past life.(?) eventually his is no longer welcome in the area.

The accumulated material of the Jewish faith was a platform for Christianity.  All of history was available to consult in crafting this group's doctrine; science fiction apparently a big influence.  Somehow,  Aleister Crowley turns up as an influence in this going clear project.  Can't avoid thinking of the notion 'prison of belief'.  Is belief in Santa Claus a prison?  If something appears to be helpful, we may give it a try.  Perhaps some join the Mafia for just that reason. One might start off with a simple faith, mixed with doubt.  But sticking with it might require that our faith be shifted from the doctrine to the notion that the faith, however bizarre seeming, has great value to humanity in itself.  Or maybe with much invested we go on in hope and fear, desperately.

Highlighted in the movie was the personality of L Ron Hubbard who was determined to ""shelter"" any monies flowing into the organization under the category ""religion"", as a not for profit so he could financially benefit from profits.

It is disgusting how Scientology movement managed to attain protected status - it is the method that all whacked out groups utilize - law suits.  There is no truth, no objective measure, just arm twisting, which is also how they deal with their own.  I highly recommend this documentary.  I am puzzled by the fact that it states Tom Cruise is a star in it, except he does appear quite a bit and so maybe the producers had to indicate as much in order to prevent a law suit.  It does have some pretty rough language, so be aware.",1458000000,,608,4.336283185840708

They do explain the ""religion"", but don't expect to completely understand it when the documentary is over. Of course, to be fair, even it's most stalwart followers don't seem to completely understand it either so I guess that's to be expected.
I'll look to podcasts, such as Oh NO! Ross and Carrie, for more in-depth conversation on what it's like as an outsider going into the church, but I take it they will never get as deep and dangerous as the rabbit hole is said to go. You have to spend a lot of money and/or give up your life to be abused in the name of belief.
What is most confusing is the famous people who follow this religion and their seeming tolerance to the abuse that happens within.

7361262,5,B0139TET14,"I was in a very tiny cult - with nothing near the level of abuse and danger presented by Scientology - but, I can tell you, no one is immune from the victimization of brainwashing.  I was young, vulnerable, suffering from depression... I got love bombed and I was hooked.  When I left, only 1 year later, I lost who I thought was my best friend, I had missed most family functions, had cancelled a family vacation - all because my church told me that was what Jesus required of me.  It took me a few years to get past the pain and embarrassment of the experience.  I have been fascinated by all organized religions and their doctrines ever since.  I've studied Mormonism, Jehovah's Witnesses, Christian Scientist, and on and on.  The common denominator is that a huge percentage of members of all these religions don't know from where/whom or even what their church's doctrine really is. I can't imagine that.  How could you put your faith of your eternal destiny into the hands of a religion that you haven't even learned about?  I never ever will fall for that crap ever again.  I now know what I believe, WHY I believe it's true, and HOW it came to be.

When I started looking at Scientology, it was like getting struck by lightening.  I've just read Lawrence Wright's book and Leah Remini's book and now seen this expose - all within the last 3 days.  I feel like I've been swimming in sewage.  I cried through half of that movie.  I already knew most of the things that were revealed, but, as other reviewers have said - something about seeing the faces and hearing the voices of those who's lives have been destroyed, who have suffered so greatly - just broke me.  I can't bear the thought of this evil thing with it's tentacles of lies out there, backed by billions of dollars, waiting to claim it's next victims.

I've just read that Monique Rathbun has fired her attorneys... I'm hoping she isn't backing down from her suit against Miscavige.

I thought something would be mentioned in the documentary about Shelly Miscavige, David's wife who hasn't been seen in about 10 years.  I suppose that it is impossible to cover all of the horrors and mysteries of Scientology's maze of deceit in one program.

There are many tragedies - suicides, broken families and even deaths that are directly or indirectly due to this heinous organization.  I only found out today, one was in my neck of the woods.  A family who's son was schizophrenic refused to allow him to be treated by doctors of Psychiatry for his serious problems due to Scientology's belief of the evil of that medical practice.  The boy killed his mother.  Stabbed her 77 times.  You can see the details at PerkinsTragedy.org.

I wait and pray that the IRS will soon revoke the tax exempt status of Scientology and/or that the COB finally pushes the line too far or decides to leave his material body and this devil's spawn of a ""religion"" implodes.  Tom Cruise is beneath contempt.  I believe in a God of justice, and I wouldn't be surprised if someday thousands of former RPG members will walk by and spit on him for all eternity.",1454630400,36,3098,4.575317604355717

7361283,4,B0139TET14,"Why is this called a film about religion?  L. Ron Hubbard immediately appeals to be a sexually ambivalent character with a frightening similarity to Adolf Hitler, and Ponzi  Scheme reeks from his tiny pores of a personality that hungers to be fed by those who feed him.  One ends with a sense of worry that the people involved need to be rescued, for the steps lead them in to the Nazi allegiance which led the powerless thugs of a Godless nature to murder whomsoever failed to agree with them to send Priest, Gypsies, and a Jewish population to be accused of all world ills and then to be shamed, starved, beaten and murdered by people who on a daily basis who might otherwise not harm an animal.  Deviants are like that,  and only the wealth appeal will keep preppy white folks who are too cool to seek the God of Biblical history and who seem to relish a podium, Tom Cruise--These are bait for the insecure with wealth to be a part of a scheme.  I only wish that we did not know from so early in the film the ramblings of L. Ron Hubbard and his top tier information of when the space ships would pick up the Scientology folks before the destruction of this civilization. //  The E-Meter reminds me of a Tens Unit with tin cans attached, only it does far less good.  Ancient religions are not all the same, but all tend to lead to a higher purpose for members to attain for others, not just a note for themselves.  The movie leaves us with little doubt that L. Ron wanted for himself a kingdom--Only he was not a regal man. One feels no love and little joy anywhere is this film,  and the Nazi analogy makes one feel sad for the young German people who are forced to bear a stain they would apt never been a part of.",1453507200,7,1718,4.2746913580246915

7361302,5,B0139TET14,"Going Clear the book, is of course more detailed and informative, but this documentary illuminates and authenticates the emotion behind a backlash against what is obviously a self-serving, paranoia-driven cult.  A cult which terrorized the IRS to the point that, in a ludicrous decision, it was compelled to concede that the Church of Scientology qualified as a ""religious"" organization.  An organization that has amassed billions in wealth, much of which it has spent on enhancing its celebrity members' surroundings and cachet.  And much spent on lawyers and aggressive tactics against anyone who has disagreed with or criticized them.  Sound like a church?

Reading a variety of articles on Wiki after viewing the film was quite interesting and revealing.  Apparently, Wiki had a prolonged arbitration with the Church re. its persistent ""editing"" of articles.  The latter has now been banned from further interference in Wiki.  Check out some of the other articles, including the main one on the Church itself, not to mention the one on Hubbard.

I was a lover of sic-fi from youth and was familiar with Hubbard, although not caring for his unsophisticated and tabloid work.  And metaphysical and religious approaches are fascinating to me, but after trying in vain three times to penetrate the mysteries of ""Dianetics"" as explained by Hubbard himself, I gave up and concluded that the guy was nuts.  I also have a background in psychology, and the red flags are all over the place with LRH.  He had constructed a rambling, incoherent system of supposed mind discipline, that became more turgid and unbelievable as one approached the higher levels.

But just the thing for vulnerable, depressed, and/or unstable individuals who suffer from a lack of healthy identity.  Typical fodder for cults.  Hubbard and successive minions have woven this nonsense into a magnificent edifice of political and cultural power for a number of decades.  Supremely arrogant and confident beyond belief, the Church has succeeded in turning many of their members against their own best interests, all the while scamming them for all their money.  Hubbard quite admittedly began this little escapade because a tax-exempt religion was a money-maker, but as the movie shows, he began to believe his own b.s.

Going Clear is a courageous and compelling expose that cannot be denied.  There are many books and other sources out there now that have survived the gauntlet of Scientologys litigation and suppressive techniques.  Too many to be just a bunch of disgruntled and vengeful ex-members.

Where theres enough smoke, theres got to be a big fire burning.  Wright, Gibney, HBO et al have performed a valuable and stylish contribution to society through their persistence in presenting this story to the masses.

It is definitely an eye-opener on the Church called Scientology.  It starts from the beginning when L. Ron Hubbard first started it and discusses his published book ""Dianetics"", which caught the minds and hearts of people as a sort of philosophical approach to living life and obtaining your goals.

It shows pictures and interviews of Hubbard, and discusses his life while in the service, and his life after and his two marriages, so that you an get a feel for the sort of man that he was.

It discusses its basic beliefs, various terminologies used with their interpretations, and the reason behind audits and using the e-meter.

It is seriously documented by numerous interviews given by past Scientology members and actors who had been in Scientology for 20-30 years, So you really have to listen to what they have to say about their experiences and why they chose to leave it.  Because many of these people were in top leadership positions at the very beginning of Scientology and stayed there so long.

The people discuss the Bridge to Freedom, where through numerous audits on the e-meter you climb to what they term as ""Clear"", which costs thousands of dollars to get to the very top.  There are various levels that you climb to and each one costs money.

Some people reported that it took 20 years or so before they were finally given copied hand written notes by L. Ron Hubbard discussing the true basis of the Scientology belief system.  It is like a science fiction movie.  I will not tell it here for those who have never saw the DVD

It discusses Tom Cruise and John Travolta and their involvement in Scientology, which will give you another view to consider.

It discusses the maneuvers that were used to get an IRA tax-exemption as being a church so that Scientology does not have to pay taxes.

Through copies that were obtained of Scientology tax forms, which is shown to the viewer on the DVD, you see the vast amount of wealth that the church has accrued due to this tax exemption.  Churches are supposed to be non-profit.

I encourage you to buy this DVD so that you can be well informed about Scientology and make your own decision as to what you think.",1451260800,21,2298,4.5931372549019605

7361320,5,B0139TET14,"Going Clear, directed by Alex Gibney, is a documentary about Scientology, revealing what is unknown to most of us. Xenu, the dictator of the ""Galactic Confederacy 75 million hears ago brought people to Earth, as a prison, stacked them in volcanoes, then killed them with hydrogen bombs. Scientology's scriptures show that thetas (immortal spirits) of these aliens are within us, humans, causing spiritual harm. This is the foundation of scientology, that most people find it crazy that people would believe in this so called religion. Throughout this documentary, Alex Gibney uses factual evidence and personal memories from ex-scientologist to discover what makes scientology so different from any other religion.

  This documentary starts off with the fundamentals and history of scientology. It was founded by an American author L Ron Hubbard with the release of Dianetics. This was an explanation to auditing, where a counsellor would get rid of your negative emotions associated with a traumatising experience, by reliving that experience. His main teaching was that Scientology teaches us that we are immortal beings who have forgotten their true selves. Scientology drag you in, with the first test free, but start requesting money for the sessions. The more you do, the more money it will cost you. They use an e-meter, which calculates the level of thetas throughout your body, and the whole point of these sessions are to try and get rid of your thetans. The higher you progress, the more information is given to you about the secrets of Scientology, such as the secrets of Xenu. Sooner or later, people realise what Scientology really does to you. Only a few have, and have been able to escape it but there are many consequences for those actions. There is a disconnection policy, where if you know anyone who is skeptical or doubtful about this religion, you are obligated to disconnect from them. For the ex-scientologist, it has caused their whole family turning their backs on them. Most of the ones who realised what Scientology was really about, and who were able to escape have lost all their family because of this. Scientology manipulates is followers, to drown their bank accounts. They use this type of addiction mixed with consequences, policies and blackmailing to access your money. For members of the Sea Org., a branch of Scientology, they have been manipulated to give up everything they have to be apart of scientology, and torture them and use physical abuse for their own benefit.

 When I started to learn about this religion, I thought it was a joke but as I started to read more about I realised how legitimate it was. It was only after I watched this documentary that I discovered the truth about Scientology. They didn't just tell us the information and the statistics but showed using ex-scientologist and live footage. It made you connect personally with the documentary and the life-style of people who still believe in such absurdity. Throughout this documentary, Alex Gibney exposed the truth of Scientology and the schemes that they have been pulling on everyone. It is a fantastic documentary that does not just regurgitate the information given to them, but puts it in context to connect empathically with the viewer. It also reveals the true essence of Scientology and how they came about to be so successful. No matter what you believe in, I strongly suggest this documentary. Alex Gibney has managed to direct a documentary that is not only factual, but connects with the viewer on a deeper level. The use of emotional connections and interviews with ex-scientologist really helped demonstrate the casualties that this organisation is creating, on an emotional or physical level. I would rate this 10/10 without a single doubt. This is one of the most interesting and thought provoking documentary you will ever see.",1449619200,4,3864,5.069182389937107

And the goofy 'squirrel patrol' - wow - you gotta be kidding.  And forcing people to 'disconnect' from their immediate family members and friends?  And people still give these lunatics money?
A must watch for people that may not understand the cult control tactics Scientology has on its members or maybe you're curious on how expensive it is to get 'Clear' - which is just another BS term from that garbage called Dianetics.

(spoiler alert) I salute the people that came forward and especially the woman that sued the Scientology cult - their tactic was to use the 1st amendment as the suit described part of their religion - a standard tactic - oops - the woman wasn't a member of the Scientology cult so their relied on tactic didn't work which is what blew this whole thing open.

HBO revealed nothing unusual that we haven't heard about Catholics, Mormons, Muslims, and other groups. There were numerous problems that the documentary ""exposed,"" while each was, at best, implied only. That is, zero proof of all allegations was offered, and even if each and every allegation were true, the faults attributed to Scientologists are common to all religious organizations. Much was made of Hubbard's invention of the religion. The same could be said about Mormonism with Jos. Smith, or Islam with Muhammad. But the documentary avoided these obvious comparisons, treating Scientology as if it were a unique and never-before heard-of invention. Ho-hum.

7361348,4,B0139TET14,"I grew up in Clearwater FL, where Scientology headquarters resides. The shroud of mystery surrounding church members, those considered ""on staff"", wearing what looks like a naval/military uniform, always intrigued me. I had a friend, who was an active member of the church, who had a successful business, just blocks away from HQ. He was paranoid and worried, since he was secretly wanting to leave the organization. He swore his business was wire-tapped, and certain he would lose his livelihood if he spoke of his intentions aloud. We would leave the area in order to speak freely of his plight. Wow, was he stuck between a rock and a hard place! The belief system, the propaganda, and the red tape of negating of his ""billion year contract"" had this man in a chokehold. I was always very curious of the deeper, inner-workings of this cult, and this documentary certainly gets to the truth of what really goes on on the inside!!",1448409600,22,930,4.782608695652174
7361349,5,B0139TET14,"I became more curious about the actual philosophy of Scientology after reading Leah Remini's new book, Troublemaker. This documentary is comprehensive in its research and does a great job of interviewing ex-high officials within the church. Their first-hand testimony to the inner workings of the church is truly shocking, yet we clearly see that each individual had their breaking point; a boundary which even they will not cross. For some it is their children, for others it is the constant abuse that was the final straw on the camel's back. Whatever each individual's reason for leaving, it is clear that the thought was always in their mind and they just needed a powerful enough reason to finally break free.

Perhaps the most interesting aspect to Scientology which I was previously unaware of, was how L Ron Hubbard or David Miscavige structured the business. Each individual must pay a fee for courses to enlighten them on the study and philosophy of Scientology. They must also perform 'audits' which is another form of psychoanalysis where the individual is asked to find the seed catalyst for the thought, emotion, behavior, action that is labelled as negative or unethical. With each stage there is a 'end phenomena' which is the expectation of the individual to perform in a certain expected way after clearing themselves of the previous hindrance. If you ever wondered why Tom Cruise acts the way he does in interviews (oddly robotic, nonaffective and pompous) you'll now understand why. He truly believes that he has reached the upper echelons of what is defined by Scientology as a 'free being' or 'OT' and thus he must outwardly act as if he is the living embodiment of this. He is afterall, a good actor.

Scientologists are told to think freely and question everything, yet once they are inside the church and thousands have been paid in courses/sessions, they are now beholden to the belief that Scientology must work. They are told not to question what L Ron Hubbard wrote as they take his text literally. They are told not to go on the internet or expose themselves to any criticism of the church less they be considered a SP or suppressive person. This is the perfect psychological trap and was consciously created by the controllers to keep their subjects in line and oblivious to ultimate reality.

Most Scientologists believe that they are the chosen few to be called to save the world. They consider most people asleep and like cattle; blindly following authority without questioning. Though I don't disagree with this, the fact is that most Scientologist' are romanced into this religion based on ego needs and the strong desire to be part of a group or tribe mentality. The need to identify with others that have labelled themselves as the Messiah's to save the Earth convinces them to sign a billion year contract based on the premise of reincarnation.

The truth is that Scientology preys on the weak minded. As all humans are weak at various points in time, we are all somewhat at risk in believing at least some of the tenets of the philosophy. However, what most individuals don't understand is that to become Enlightened or to be free from our mental mind chatter/ego, we must go this route alone. If you focus on daily transgressions and try to clear them away by shining light on them, it will be a never-ending and futile process. It was Albert Einstein that said, 'You cannot solve a problem at the level in which it was created.' The entire point to going beyond the 'mind' is to realize your attachment to it. The belief that you are bad is an attachment. The belief that you are special and are meant to save the planet is an attachment. The belief that the world is wrong and something needs to be done about it, is although a lofty thought, still an attachment. All beliefs are attachments.

If one truly wants to be free then paying money to an institution for another fellow human being to question you through your transgressions is not the answer. To truly be free is to be autonomous without co-dependence on an institution, individual, or belief system.",1448409600,37,4104,4.815602836879433

""Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief"" helped me understand why the people continue to submit to the demands of this group and why they never seem to question the group's motives.
While I certainly feel there is more to the story, this DVD opens the dark recesses of this secretive and vindictive group to the light of reason and analysis. Since Scientology refuses to honestly talk about their deepest beliefs, I will have to rely on the testimony of those that left the group.

At the end of the film, it is mentioned that the active membership is down to 50,000.  Although true believers may be dwindling, the church's power comes from the massive amounts of wealth and property it has accumulated all over the world.  Hopefully exposes such as this will lead to federal investigations and loss of tax-free status.

7361367,5,B0139TET14,"Janet Reitman's ""Inside Scientology"" is the definitive book on this cult of seduction, larceny, and mind control. ""Going Clear,"" the HBO documentary, is now the definitive film on the topic. It takes a complex story and makes it riveting. At the center of the film are interviews with people who spent decades in the organization, in some cases high up, as perpetrators in Scientology's criminal enterprise. But they all inevitably became victims. Most were interviewed by Reitman for her book, but watching and listening to their stories is more emotionally charged and powerful. I have a lot of respect for them. The decision to leave and then speak out against Scientology comes at grave personal risk. In some cases it has resulted in being cut off forever from close family members, as well as other forms of vicious harassment and character assassination. The fact that children, spouses and parents can be convinced to sever their ties with defectors for the rest of their lives speaks volumes about the stranglehold Scientology has over its members.

This well-produced documentary intersperses the interviews with archival film footage, placing the history of Scientology in context.  The saga of founder L. Ron Hubbard and his successor David Miscavige is incredible and horrifying. At the end of the film, the interviewees try to answer the question:  why and how do apparently intelligent people get themselves mixed up with such evil and insanity and end up staying for years, despite all kinds of abuse?  Someone says it all comes down to faith, but I think it goes deeper.  Scientology is just one of many fanatical cults predicated on bizarre metaphysical dogma cooked up by a charismatic psychopath, that vie for our hearts, minds and especially our wallets.  Human beings are very susceptible to brainwashing and scare tactics, mixed in with promises of perfect happiness and eternal life. Scientology is a first-world, current-day example of how we can be seduced and coerced into choosing slavery over freedom. What does this say about us as a species?

The good news is that membership in Scientology is declining as defectors speak out and the public learns more about its true nature through excellent documentaries like this one.

7361395,5,B0139TET14,"GOING CLEAR: SCIENTOLOGY AND THE PRISON OF BELIEF is directed by Alex Gibney and is based on the book by Lawrence Wright. While it doesn't really replace the book in any meaningful sense, it was a great companion piece that filled in a lot of gaps that a book was never going to fill anyway. Among these significant additions were archival footage of Scientology gatherings and L. Ron Hubbard, as well as interviews with many of the key people who provided anecdotes for the book. I suppose the edge that the film has is in being able to actually go behind the scenes with a look at how Scientology operates. Even still, the book goes into far more detail than the film had time to do. As for its documentary qualities, I thought it was well put-together, as is to be expected from veteran documentarian Alex Gibney. The interviews were sufficiently interesting, alternating between talking heads and archival footage. A couple of the crazier moments were courtesy of Tom Cruise, shown in one clip fervently saluting a portrait of Scientology founder, L. Ron Hubbard. The film even manages to tug at your heartstrings as the discussion moved to the Scientology policy of disconnection, and one former member recounts her daughter saying that she would have to disconnect from her. And of course there were all the tales of abuse at ""The Hole"" perpetrated against the Sea Org, the Scientology clergy. All together, it paints a very dark picture of a religion that uses fear and intimidation to keep its members in line while, at the same time, catering to its celebrity members' whims. I would have liked a little more general discussion about religion and how belief is used to control people, something that is touched upon a little bit towards the end, but for what it's worth this film does a great job exposing Scientology for the fraudulent scheme it is.",1446508800,6,1859,4.77639751552795

I wish the film had gone more into happenings at the sinister Gold Camp, but as it is, the filmmakers focus on completely believable first-person accounts from high-level defectors.

7361397,4,B0139TET14,"I did learn a few things i didn't already know about scientology from this documentary. The part about how they finally got tax exempt status from the IRS actually did surprise me. (You might want to keep in mind that scientology is by no means the first money making scheme to declare itself a church for the tax shelter - google is your friend :) ) However, there are still 2 things i have never understood about scientology i don't understand that this movie didn't address: First, adults may be able to decide for themselves to be part of a cult or questionable ""religion"", but how do they get away with the abuse of children? If the parents won't take their kids out of the situation, then the law has an obligation to act - or at least i thought that's how it's supposed to work. The other thing i don't understand is how they get away with the extreme harassment after people leave. I'm no lawyer, but i am curious :-)",1446508800,6,925,4.383720930232558

7361399,3,B0139TET14,"Mildly interesting, but nothing like the shocker it was purported to be. The basis of the documentary seems to be the experiences of disaffected Scientologists, who left the church after many years of devoted service.  They spoke affectingly of their lives in this organization, but what they were recounting was totally subjective and anecdotal. These are adults who finally realized that they had made some poor life choices and now were living with the regrets.
There were the usual allegations of control, deceit and financial irregularities, including the claim that the church blackmailed the IRS into granting them tax exempt status. Far-fetched to me; even the Mob couldn't intimidate federal agents and they offer more serious threats than lawsuits. There were no smoking guns that I could see.
Some stuff about Tom Cruise so people would watch the film, but nothing that hasn't been said before.  How he assumes the responsibility for everything Scientology is a mystery.

I saw the awards it has won:  ""Winner of three 2015 Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Special, Outstanding Directing for Nonfiction Programming and Outstanding Writing for Nonfiction Programming"" and wanted to watch it because I was curious after reading bits of info other places, and seeing people talking about it on TV.",1446336000,2,608,5.121212121212121

7361402,5,B0139TET14,"Prison of Belief is an accurate phrase for describing the world of belief Scientologists are drawn into and then get stuck within.

I was stuck in Scientology, somewhat knowing it was going to be a long term commitment, and most disappointing to me, in the end, is that the beliefs of Scientology fall so flat and in the end are so ludicrously obvious to most people, but not me who like so many stuck in Scientology, we wanted there to be truth in the biggest Scientology goal, which is ""OT'.

OT is Operating Thetan.  Thetan in the soul.  And Operating Thetan basically means becoming a sort of soul astronaut.

Each human being IS a soul, and does not have a soul, per L. Ron Hubbard, in Scientology.

The goal of Scientology is to regain one's pure soul abilities like being able to fly out of one's body, like an astronaut launching out of a space capsule.

Scientology is supposed to provide people with these abilites, if you follow the step by step progrm that Scientology lays out, you are supposed to become an Operating Thetan.

There are 8 secret ""Operating Thetan"" levels, for soul astronaut training in Scientology.

They sadly, do not result in anyone being able to fly out of their skulls like an astronaut flies out of a space capsule, though.

One gets some hallucinations, at best, which convince one that the out of the body experience is '""real"", but the number of people who get the full clean out of the body experience in Scientology is dismally just as coincidental as the number of people who have the out of the body hallucination in the world already, without any of the Scientology expensive ""levels"".

So, I was, after 27 years, basically a wised up person, I had to admit no Scientologists were becoming the Operating Thetan soul astronauts.

So to me, simply Scientology turns out to be a long drawn out con job, since it's like soul snipe hunting.  No one gets the soul flying abilities, it's a long drawn out con.

Scientologists are no more remarkable, and most of unremarkable less than normal or noteworthy human beings, today.

Scientology is not changing the world by any of Scientology past lives trauma crackpot therapy, nor with Scientology's exorcism crank therapy that Scientologists do their crank exorcism therapy on a whole bunch of dead space alien souls that Scientologists are trained to discover these space alien souls are infesting their human bodies today.

So Scientologists are being trained that they are infested with dead space alien souls, and then use L. Ron Hubbard's Scientology special exorcism procedures, called Operating Thetan Level 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 (5 exorcism Operating Thetan levels is a whole LOT of exorcism).

And Scientology cannot even simply define what they do, and they still refuse to define their practices, and the outside world has to rely on ex members willing to detail the practices, for the public to even know that Scientology engages is so much exorcism of dead space alien souls.

The details, even if you didn't understand the details, everyone knows that Scientologists are NOT some world changing new group of people, but a group of sadly overexcited and frankly kind of deluded happy but nonsense gobblygood speaking people.

But no soul astronauts able to fly out of their bodies and have their out of the body experiences at will and nor are any of the Scientologists doing ONE thing that is supernatural, but they tell themselves that they are.

It's a group of self convinced believers that they WILL become these superpowered souls, and regain their true powerful pure soul powers.

They don't, so that's really what is obvious to anyone who hasn't even heard of Scientology, because if there were any supersoulpowered Scientologists, the world would see the evidence, and there is no evidence.

The Scientologists are a small group of hopefuls, and then this movie shows members who wised up.

Some still believe.

But the saddest truth is, there are no ""OTs""

No soul astronauts, that's the sad bigger story, it's the whole backdrop to this unfortunate con job fake religion.

Average public who don't even know Scientology instinctively know this.

The movie is a downer, for an ex Scientologist, it's a sobering down.

Truthful, and when people ask me today about whether the movie and the book is true, I say it is worse.

It is worse ,and they couldn't show how worse it is.

Enough to say it's really a sad prison of belief.

It is.",1446076800,37,4438,4.792378449408673

Groundbreaking and spellbinding to watch.
That the always litigious legions of Scientology lawyers have been completely stymied by this film is the clearest endorsement of its veracity.
Loosely based on Lawrence Wright's much more detailed book, Gibney expertly builds his case; first against the Scientology celebrities, who know of the abuses of the organization and remain complicit through their silence and also the IRS, which rescued Scientology from bankruptcy by  granting it 501 C-3 status.
Ultimately Scientology will receive the justice it fully deserves.
