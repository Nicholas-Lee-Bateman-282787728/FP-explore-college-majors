8690923,5,B00Q93OXFA,"This is a wonderful CD in every way! The MonaLisa Twins' original songs are downright great, and the videos are extremely creative and well done!  A really enjoyable music DVD!",1439856000,,176,4.866666666666666
8690924,5,B00Q93OXFA,"The ""catchyness"" of the songs created by Lisa and Mona - aka the MonaLisa Twins - is enhanced by the videos they have created for each song.  Totally professional, unfailingly entertaining - at times funny, quirky, and thought-provoking - these little stories bring further enjoyment to my listening pleasure each time I watch them.

Find out how they were made, too, in the 'behind the scenes' videos...  Mona and Lisa are incredibly talented, but beyond the confidence they have in their abilities, you won't see any 'prima donnas' here!",1439769600,,539,5.033707865168539
