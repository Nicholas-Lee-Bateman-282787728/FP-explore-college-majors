What began as a Hong Kong film before being taken over by an American studio survived the threat of turning into convoluted mishmash and became what's easily one of Daniels' best martial arts films. Current fans, pick this one up; new fans, use this one to introduce yourself to the man; and casual fans of kick-butt cinema, give it a try and you won't be disappointed.

The story: when the partner of DEA agent Mike Ryan (Daniels,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fist-of-the-North-Star/dp/B0001US7MW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fist of the North Star</a>) is killed during a drug bust set up by the new Triad prince of narcotics (Cary Tagawa,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mortal-Kombat/dp/0790729997/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mortal Kombat</a>), he sets off on a deadly quest of vengeance, all the while trying to come to terms with his role as a law enforcer, not an assassin.

High production values: pretty cinematography and crisp camerawork, not to mention the occasional flair of the art department in constructing noir-ish Hong Kong backgrounds make for a film that's never boring to look at.
Decent acting: Gary Daniels will never be mistaken for Brando or Hoffman, but his performance ranks among his better ones, alongside the solid B-movie acts of baddie Cary Tagawa, chameleon woman Julia Nickson and stalwart police captain George Cheung (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rambo-First-Blood-Part-2/dp/B0004Z33EQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rambo: First Blood, Part 2</a>), and doomed buddy Matt Craven (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crimson-Tide/dp/6304765258/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crimson Tide</a>).
Good action: it's mainly martial arts with a couple gunfights thrown in, but Gary proves his adeptness as choreographer via six or seven diverse, well-paced, and well-shot encounters, including a particularly neat brawl between himself and Ron Yuan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deadly-Target/dp/B000EWBO7C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deadly Target</a>).
All of these things stand in favor of the film and cover the deficiencies of much of his other fare. I daresay that with the exception of the few of his theatrically-released starring pictures, these are the highest standards that a Gary Daniels action vehicle can hope to achieve.

With that said, the storyline - though populated with mildly amusing characters - does tend to drag a bit, even if you're not giving the film your full attention. The fight content is, as said, reasonably abundant, but the brawls aren't distributed equally enough to give reprieve from the uninvolving tale they're highlighting. There's also at least one example in which Daniels' character exhibits cloying stupidity (i.e. the bar snooping scene) that's almost enough to make you stop taking the movie seriously. On a positive note, while I'm disappointed that the Hong Kong version of this film was cancelled and no footage of the original project remains, there are a few honors paid to its roots via a couple of HKisms and telltale camera angles during some of the fights (mostly during the boat invasion) that are pretty neat if you know what to look for.

There's not much else to say. The positives thoroughly outweigh the movie's faults, and when it comes to low-budget kung fu fare, that's more than you can sometimes hope for. Daniels fans, buy the movie! Martial arts B-movie fans, buy the movie! Everybody else?...buy the movie!",1263945600,4,3856,6.018214936247723
7858651,4,6304018975,"White Tiger is a well made B action movie in terms of picture quality, sound quality, and character convincement.  The fights are more realistic than flashy & lengthy, but there are a lot of them and they are done very well.  Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa (Mortal Kombat, Showdown In Little Tokyo, Kickboxer 2) has an excellent performnce at being the films dirty bad guy, Victor Chow.  Ron Yuan (Ring of Fire, To Be The Best, Bloodfist V), though with not too much screen time, makes his presence known as Severin, Victor's right hand man.  Combined these guys are great villains. Gary Daniels does a great performace too as the cop, Mike Ryan.

The plot is just another story about revenge.  Mike's partner John is murdered by Victor Chow, leaving behind a wife and son.  Mike goes to great lengths to find Chow, and the exciting part about this story of revenge is that he trusts the wrong people at various times.

Perhaps the best thing about White Tiger is the action.  There are numerous amounts of fights scenes, and all look great.  You can tell these are real fights, and look convincingly so.  Gary Daniels gets a good fight against Ron Yuan, and a great final fight against Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa.  No fight lasts more than 2 minutes, but I never felt disspointed by that at all - its not the kind of movie that requires long fights to be good.  In fact, it would most likely feel out of place.

White Tiger was an unknown title to me at first, but now sits at the heart of my favorite martial art films, and probably the best Gary Daniels film.  Very solid B movie that should not dissapoint at all.",1183507200,7,1601,4.529616724738676
7858652,5,6304018975,This is one of Gary Daniels best martial arts pictures.  The action/fight scenes are well done and fun to watch.  I have always enjoyed the many films Gary has starred in.  Hope he continues to make these films.,1181606400,2,211,4.5
7858653,4,6304018975,"Gary Daniels is the most superb movie martial artist of all time. In this movie he finally choreographs his own fight scenes and gets to play a  character that is neither to prissy to fear or too enraged to be realistic.  He plays Mike Ryan, a special forces guy with the skills to bring down a  drug runner. The action in this movie was great considering that it's a  martial arts flick. Though Gary Daniels has never let his fans down I need  to complain about the director ant the poor lighting throughout the movie.  The director seems to really aim for bad angles that miss a lot of the  action and sometimes the fights are in front of the sun and all you can see  are blurry silhouettes.
I think that the bad parts can still be forgiven  due to superior action and fighting scenes, and the use of consistent  charicters.",966124800,,826,4.375
