3466468,5,B001AS5XNA,"If the late great Sam Peckinpah had ever found himself on the Nepalese border, jacked up on Pepsi Max and hair metal, he might have made a documentary like Everest: Beyond the Limit... Like the best Peckinpah westerns it was also strangely beguiling and somehow shot through with an elegiac tone that balanced every moment of macho posturing with ominous intimations of mortality... The Wild Bunch go climbing and all the better for it!'
Kevin Maher, The Times

""Beyond the Limit"" is a stunning tour de force, easily the best documentary on Everest, perhaps the finest footage on climbing ever produced... ...run out and get a big-screen HD television, but the real magic of ""Beyond the Limit"" is in the human stories.
David Whiting, US Mountaineer and Orange County Register columnist",1220832000,2,785,4.99236641221374
3466469,3,B001AS5XNA,"Like season one the quality of the video is great and it does a great job of showing what was going on and what it might be like on the expedition.

However, I gave the set a 3 star score because of the DVD's themselves.  I have read other Discovery Channel DVD reviews that said the DVD's had only primitive navigation, little real effort at polish and zero extras.  This DVD set is like that.  Instead of a nice splash screen with navigation it just has text that says to play the programs.  It's about on the level of what a consumer set top DVD-R recorder does.  One example of that is a review on the Survivorman season 2 set that is available now (August 2008).  Now note that another release of season 2 of Survivorman will be released in October that is half the price and has actual Survivorman cover art.  Not sure what is going on.  I looked at the Discovery Channel site and they sell DVD's with single episodes with generic covers.  Some of those DVD's are available on Amazon for $22/episode.

Just a guess but it looks like Discovery releases programs one episode at a time, then all of those in one set and eventually releases a nice boxed set version that is fully produced later.  Some people think the DVDs released earlier look like DVD-R's and I have to agree they have that look but I'm not certain.  If they stick to that pattern another Everest Beyond the Limit season 2 boxed set that has navigation and extras might be released in the future.  I think the simpler DVD sets may be rushed to market for people that want to buy episodes shortly after they are aired.

3466470,5,B001AS5XNA,"Both seasons of this show were really good.  I watched both of them straight through without stopping 6 episodes in the first season and 8 in the second, although I watched each season on different occasions. It is really well done with the trademark Discovery quality.  You feel like you are right there  on the mountain.  This is a very emotion inspiring series as well, It really captures the essence of the challenge and beauty of Everest.

3466477,4,B001AS5XNA,"PLEASE NOTE: The Amazon versions of Seasons 1 & 2 are AT LEAST 4 minutes SHORTER (per episode!) than the same series episodes purchased through the Apple iTunes store.  The Apple versions are more complete and enjoyable. Also, Season 2 is not as good as Season 1, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. How is 2 not as good as the first? Less detail. The people featured on this series are not as interesting as the group in the first season. The coverage of each of the climbers is a bit more shallow. You get a sense of them filling in the time--they keep repeating the same narration points over and over. Part of this has to do with the commercial breaks that you don't have in this format. But it's worse in Season 2 than in Season 1",1424908800,,728,4.27536231884058

3466480,5,B001AS5XNA,"I haven't bought this season from Amazon since I watch it on Netflix, but I love this series. The biker from LA and the asthmatic from Denmark are back again, along with Russel Bryce and Phurba Taashi, to challenge Everest again. This group of climbers is challenged by the mountain once again, along with a columnist from LA, a climbing instructor from England who is climbing Everest on a bet from his pub friends, a physician who nearly died twice before on Everest, and more. The ""Sherpa cams"" mounted on the Sherpa helmets give you a moment-by-moment, breathtaking view of the events as the climbers enter the ""Death Zone"", and the cameramen back in camp and on ""the hill"" record what happens to the injured and the lost on Everest. I have re-watched this series several times over because it is so fascinating to watch ordinary people facing an extraordinary challenge.",1408838400,,875,4.801324503311259
3466481,4,B001AS5XNA,"If you read books by real mountaineers, and have seen a few documentaries or movies (often which have scenery filmed elsewhere purporting to be the real thing, this reality tv show is worth it just for the scenery.  You get to see all the base camps and some of the landmarks of the north face of Everest. (you have to wait for season three to see the south face).  You also get to see a reality TV version of base camp, and a reality tv version of what a commercial expedition is like.

Be aware this isn't real mountaineering. Safety lines are strung most of the way to the summit, and ladders have been affixed to places where technical rock climbing might be needed. Given all the amateurs attempting the climb, who bottleneck the routes regardless, this saves a lot of lives.  But it's a bit disappointing to see the steps laced with aluminum ladders.  Amateurs are being warned to climb with their legs too, not just pull themselves by yanking on the jumar clipped to the safety rope hard enough to pull the ice screws, snow stakes and pinions out.

Given this is reality TV, you also have tons of manufactured drama, complete with a typical idiotic biker guy who talks big and ignores orders, then depends on Sherpas half his size to get him out of the trouble he got himself into, plus risking the lives of his guides.  The asthmatic Dane from season 1 is back to try and climb without gas. A cast of others want to be the first, the oldest, etc., which, given the hundreds of people climbing now, this is a little silly.  Another plans to do a double traverse from north to south face and back.  And there's a  fame hungry woman who did a little climbing ten years ago, and some trekking and decided being on a reality show about Everest was too good a chance to miss.  A lot is made of her incompetence.  Realistically, though, every year someone else makes the news who started ""climbing"" with Everest and makes it up and down. This year it was a 14 year old girl from India.  Given Everest is not a technical climb, some of these amateurs really can make it. What seems to sink Betsy is clear signs of trouble acclimatizing, and hypoxic behavior. I suspect she was added for the drama, to show someone struggling and have the big scene of will she or won't she be cut from the team.

This is not a bad show, but it is a reality show, which means a lot of manufactured drama. I suppose they all thought just the scenery and the matter of fact story of commercial Everest climbs would not be enough drama. But I would have appreciated the show more without the manufactured drama, especially more wide pans of the various camps and landmarks, rather than more idiotic Tim drama which is what the producers went for. At least give us it in extras on the DVD (sadly they didn't).

One thing I'll say for Russell Brice, his timing climbers has a lot of value, given they are climbing with Oxygen. I never heard this tactic mentioned before.  But it makes a lot of sense given that regardless how strong a climber is, or how technical they are, or how determined, if they don't have the speed, they'll die. Because climbers only have so many hours on their oxygen bottles. If they are slow, they are going to run out of gas. And most inexperienced poorly acclimated climbers then will just fall down in the snow, their brain a hypoxic fog, and perhaps not get up again.  So Russel's timing clients to the various camps is a great idea. Perhaps, if more expeditions required that, there would be fewer bottlenecks.

The extras were not scenery or more prosaic camp life or climbing bits, but post climb discussions. Still, I thought the extras added a lot to the value of purchasing the DVD.

In all, I would say if you are interested in Everest, this show is worth it, in spite of suffering (or fast forwarding perhaps, the second time you encounter it) though the silly reality show fake drama bits.",1402790400,,3906,4.46067415730337
3466482,5,B001AS5XNA,"I'd give anything to meet Russell Brice and just hang out with him for awhile, because he's an amazing guy in terms of his ability to organize these trips, take care of the mind-boggling logistical problems, keep on top of the craziest weather patterns in the world, and then deal with the clients (which is like herding cats half the time). His ability to make order out of chaos is astonishing, and his patience with the pains in the ass that some of the clients are is remarkable. The real climbers must be going nuts having to deal with the inexperienced people who haven't a clue, and while I'd kill for a chance to go there myself, I'm also realistic enough to know there's no way in hell I'm in any shape to do it.  Maybe in my next life?",1395532800,,745,4.321428571428571
3466483,5,B001AS5XNA,I was thoroughly engrossed in the middle of Everest season two. I had watched three of the episodes when Amazon pulled it off the Prime. I am ticked off!,1394841600,,153,4.310344827586207
3466484,4,B001AS5XNA,Liked the series. Very inspirational. Got thru season one and loved it. Got half way thru season 2 and Amazon pulled it from Prime. I hate that. It happened before when I started the Lost series. Got half way thru season 1 and Amazon pulled it from Prime. Starting to wonder if I am wasting my money on a Prime membership.,1394582400,,322,4.295081967213115
3466485,4,B001AS5XNA,"Great second series, equal to the first in my opinion, and thought the camera work and feeling of being up there was actually a little better. I didn't like the constant recapping that comes with tv series like this but that's my only negative.",1394323200,,244,4.568181818181818
3466486,4,B001AS5XNA,Good look into the challenge of climbing Everest. Although there are some egos on display here  I really enjoyed this series.,1393632000,,125,4.9523809523809526

3466489,5,B001AS5XNA,"Tremendously great series!!

I'm not a mountain climber...and due to age and disability, I'll never be one.

But this series gave me insights into mountain climbing, mountain climbers and especially the psychology of Everest climbers.  Such insights are interesting and valuable in understanding the best of human nature.

Take the time to watch the shows.  If you have teens, especially, persuade them to watch it, too.

Warning for parents:  there will be a few curse words included in the show; but, to be honest, nothing that the kids aren't hearing in middle school or high school.  The context is appropriate to the use of language, and it isn't overdone.",1392681600,,661,5.0
3466490,5,B001AS5XNA,I have to admit I do like series 3 a bit more buts that's only because the technology had gotten better and the quality of filming is so much more vivid. This series on the whole was just as nerve wracking and enjoyable to watch. I would highly recommend it.,1392163200,,258,4.18
3466491,5,B001AS5XNA,"Many of the cast of climbers returned for season 2 and again, they were an engaging group.  Once again I found myself rooting for them and sharing in their hopes to reach the summit.  Great cinematography added to the enjoyment of the show, and I feel like I know the mountain much more than I ever did before.  The Sherpas are amazing and very interesting.",1392076800,,357,4.461538461538462
3466492,4,B001AS5XNA,Good connection with the climbers and their back story. What I took away from this documentary is a learning experience about the type of people of do this and how it has helped me cope with little things in life after watching this.  It also proved to me how strong I am in dealing with my life's issues.,1391299200,,305,4.258620689655173

3466494,3,B001AS5XNA,this was interesting but really the show is only about 10 - 15 min.  The narrator repeats and sets up over and over again and I felt as though I was in groundhogs day,1390867200,,166,3.8823529411764706

3466496,5,B001AS5XNA,Awesome! We watched it as a family. We thought it was great. Loved it! Captivating. Educational. Suspenseful. I highly recommend it.,1389916800,,132,5.333333333333333
3466497,5,B001AS5XNA,"Great documentary, watched all seasons at once. At least they are showing that something can go wrong during expeditions. it definitely proves that it is worth to be prepared for everything.  I admire all the Sherpa's for their hard work.",1389830400,,238,4.95
3466498,4,B001AS5XNA,"The second season continues to follow the same Summit organizers but with a new set of climbers (although I wouldn't want to give away which climbers are returning from the 1st Season to try it again). This time, however, there are new twists and turns in the story -- missing climbers from an Italian team, a climber who plans to traverse up the North side, down the South side and then back up and over again to set a world-first record, a climber who is NOT approved to try to summit, and an elderly man who has climbed every other peak in the world. Lots of bone-chilling moments make it a riveting season.",1389657600,,610,4.407079646017699

3466503,5,B001AS5XNA,Loved season 1 and couldn't wait to start season 2.  Went through season 2 so fast to see how everyone did on this mountain.  Exciting show,1389052800,,139,4.3076923076923075

3466505,2,B001AS5XNA,"Season 1 was pushing it with the repetitive audio slogan and Russell's poor attitude. However, the 2nd season seems to be lacking a considerable amount of budget money as the camera filming is atrocious. I think Discovery already knew after season 1 they were in trouble and did not put any money into this season. In addition, there was poor character building and considering a few of the men were repeats from last season, they should have focused on other climbers, not the ones who failed to make the top last year.",1388793600,,520,4.663043478260869

3466508,5,B001AS5XNA,Those people are nuts!  To endure the things they go through just to be able to say they did it.....  The show draws you back because you want to see who will make it and who won't!  Very interesting!,1387670400,,200,4.076923076923077
3466509,5,B001AS5XNA,"This is definitely the most compelling television that you will ever watch. It is reality TV, but its what other shows like survivor wish they could be. This is true life and death, and the death is not hidden, its right out in the open. There are no teams of doctors behind the cameras waiting to treat members if they get a burn. There is no help once they get up into ""the death zone."" No helicopters, no rescue teams. Do yourself a favor and check this out, unless you are squeamish.

3466511,5,B001AS5XNA,"Season 2 was a really nice continuity of Season 1. It connected very well with the previous season, as promised, with both Tim and Mogens returning to try again. I know a lot of people probably didn't like Tim and I will admit that his brashness might be off-putting to some, but I grew to admire his determination, particularly after his accident on his way to the summitand he made it. Likewise Mogens, the asthmatic who gave up his dream of making it without oxygen in favor of making it to the top at all. This season also gave us a deeper look at leader Russell Brice and at the Sherpas, introduced some new climbers, and delved further into people's reasons for climbing, as well as showing what can happen on the mountain.

3466515,4,B001AS5XNA,"This series is a great introduction to what it would be like (to have $60,000 - $100,000) and go climb Everest with a top notch group. It is very interesting to study the various personalities as well as the technical and physical challenges that make up an Everest expedition.

Seasons 1 & 2 show expeditions up the North side (from Tibet).  Due to political unrest of the past few years,  season 3 focuses on climbing the South side.  This south side route is the original route climbed by Norgay and Hillary when Everest was first climbed in 1953.  As pure entertainment I enjoyed the series.  But for me, the careful repeated watching is what has taught me the most about extreme altitude mountaineering and been the most value.

Although climbing Everest is out of the budget (!) it does not cost $60,000 - $100,000 get get into the needed physical and mental shape to do such a thing - it just takes effort. Google online the Everest expedition sites and look at their fitness suggestions. Enjoy!!",1382572800,,1003,4.6647727272727275

By  Aquinas ""summa"" (celestial heights, UK) - See all my reviews

I watched these series with a gap of about 2 years between series 1 and 2. My impression was that series 1 was more interesting as there was a greater variety of charathers whereas series 2 was overshadowed by the amusing Tim, whose ego was as big as his frame. The scenery is really lovely but there are annoying features, namely the obsessive Machismo, the personifcation by the charachters of the mountain and the frequent recapitulations which must have preceded and followed commercial breaks. Even so, it is all very enjoyable and one really wants to know who will summit. Clearly these guys have extrordinary self-discipline in this context but I wondered to myself whether this self-discipline was reflected in other parts of their lives. As the Dane rightly put it, his bigger challenge was his forthcoming marriage and in that he was spot on. Climbimg everest is about a dialogue with oneslef - there is something more majestic about making a sucess out of a marriage where the dialogue is with another person rather than with myself battling a mountain!",1271808000,2,1160,4.883248730964467

3466544,5,B001AS5XNA,"Have you ever secretly harbored the thought of someday climbing Mt. Everest (and who hasn't?), and wondered what it would take to succeed (and whether you've got enough of it)? Then you could do yourself no greater favor than to view--in one sitting--the 7-hr series #2 ""Everest: Beyond the Limit.""

The story is an extremely well-filmed ""up-close & personal"" depiction of a group of amateur climbers who have paid their $40+K to Russell Brice, a professional Everest Expedition manager. Each climber has a distinct personality, but most are marked by overweening ambition to prove something to themselves, to their friends--that they've got what it takes. Yet is spite of much noble philosophizing to the cameras, musing about their own incredible will to succeed and indomitable spirit, most exude an air of selfishness that no amount of smiling one-upmanship can mask.

The cameramen are everywhere (a production crew of 17) plus numerous ""Sherpa Cams"" worn by the Sherpa guides that filmed ever step of their 11 clients. Running interviews become  typical commentary and campsite palaver. The climbers are mic-ed so one can hear their groans, wheezing and cries for help.

The ""star"" of the show is Ted Medvetz, a 250-lbs gorilla and motorcycle salesman who has gone through life getting what he wants by taking it, and acting shocked--shocked--when he has to play by rules he agreed to in writing but finds restrictive whenever it suits him. He is a chronically late starter and a slow-goer, thus putting everyone at risk. Nevertheless his obnoxious behavior is often masked by a backslapping bonhomie that is--one hates to admit it--attractive in a Hell's Angels sort of way. And he is tough as nails--which, along with strength and endurance--are the sine qua non of Everest climbing. Brains and good will count for little on this lock-step exercise in self-abuse.

One of the Everest wannabes is a slight PR-type woman from Hollywood who, in order to be accepted on the expedition, claimed to be an experienced hiker-climber (and a karate Black-Belt--ha!). To the astonishment of Russell Brice, she demonstrated her mountaineering experience by trying to put her crampons on upside-down and backwards!! And she was desperately slow, i.e., weak. In spite of many chances to prove herself, she was eventually tearfully taken off the summit attempt because she could not possible have reached the top in the window of opportunity beginning at the 11PM start-time of the summit assault.

Leaving personalities aside, what is so fascinating about this film is the great attention to the ordinary aspect of expedition climbing--putting on crampons, melting drinking water, eating, clipping into ropes, and slogging, slogging, slogging.

The net-net of the experience is this: The route to the summit is lined 100% with guide ropes. You clip in and get in line. You walk, gasping for breath every step of the way up to 25,000-ft., at which point the team sleeps and walks using oxygen. From then on the ""walk"" gets steeper, colder and much more dangerous. It is here that many climbers just run out of gas. It is instructive to see otherwise intelligent (and highly ambitious) men demanding to continue on, when they can not even stand up from where they have flopped down in total exhaustion. And the way down is not much easier. Each begs for just a few minutes more of rest. But on Everest at altitude, you never get better and the clock stops for no man; the pain may cease when you stop, but even resting, you are deteriorating every minute of the galloping day.

Aficionados of Saga of Mallory & Irvine will enjoy tremendously the close-up scenes of the terrain of this North side assault, especially the infamous Second Step--that crux obstacle that stood in Mallory's way to the top. It is severe territory, and it is obvious that none of these amateur climbers would have had a snowball's chance in hell of even reaching it, much less surmounting it, if not guided hand and foot by the every-present Sherpas.

But surmount it many did, thanks to the Chinese ladder, the Sherpa assistance and their own inner resources and indomitable will. Some 500 climbers reached the summit that year, from both sides of the mountain. Seven died on the way down. One chilling statistic: 25% of all summiters age 60 and older died on the descent. (Still want to go?)

On the descent, a few were in extremis, barely able to walk, often being held upright by the affable and ever present Sherpas--the real Everesters, some who have summited ten times.

The Everest Dream is not like many other idle desires turned serious. Anyone can pretend to be a bull fighter for a few moments. Anyone can jump out of an airplane. But watch this Discovery series to see if you have what it takes both mentally and physically to climb the highest mountain in the world. Perhaps, on seeing this fascinating production, you will wake up and the dream will finally go away.",1260576000,,4949,4.929171668667467
3466545,3,B001AS5XNA,"I enjoyed this series (both season 1 & 2). There's a bit too much screen time spent re-re-recapping what occurred in previous episodes but it was still thoroughly engaging drama.

Now on to one hugely annoying element of this series: Tim Medvetz, one of the expedition members.

Why did they have to spend SOOOO much screen time on this buffoon? I found the other climbers much more interesting & agreeable. By contrast, Tim is a cartoonish caricature of the loud, obnoxious, arrogant, reckless, self-absorbed, pompous American. He treats everything like a party and acts as if he's the center of the universe. Oh, and he also grunts ""U.S.A!!!"" like the walking cartoon that he is. As an American, I'm tired of seeing the same old onscreen formula that says ""American"" = ""rugged individual"" = ""loud obnoxious jerk"".

Through both season 1 & 2, this man NEVER does what he's asked to do. He always leaves late, does what he wants, goes where he wants, creates bottlenecks and naps in the snow. He basically tells others to go screw themselves and acts like the tough guy who goes it alone but then whimpers for help later on.

And that's not even the worst of it. He's full of cheap platitudes about conquering Everest, learning about himself, the importance of teamwork, about how he can't respect people who don't come prepared or respect the mountain, blah blah blah, but he never demonstrates any of those qualities himself. And he never acknowledges the tremendous help he gets - to him, it's simply a story of Tim versus Everest. In truth, he would not have gotten as far as he did without outside help, and he might very well have died without them. To the very end, he continues to talk narcissistically about what HE accomplished.

I find it annoying that this series seems to celebrate his self-absorbed bay boy antics. And if I ever climb Everest, I hope to God I don't have someone like him on my expedition.",1259625600,43,1919,4.699404761904762
3466546,2,B001AS5XNA,"Having done some climbing, (many years ago) the subject matter and cinematography are highly compelling, and season 1 was very good.  Season 2 however, is a study on how you can take an already very dramatic subject, and stretch it ""beyond the limit"" to the point of ridiculous.

I am not by any means berating the expedition members, (well, except for Betsy, who was a joke) but the film makers quest for high ratings seems to be the guiding force here.  I can almost hear them asking the following questions -
1.  Just how many times can we show spinning images of all the metal in Tim's body?
2.  Seems like there isn't enough drama this year, how about a fight between Tim and Russ?
3.  How many times can we talk about HAPE and HACE?  I mean, after all, people need to hear it at least 30 times, don't they?
4.  Why would we show all of the compelling, but silly aspects of climbing, when we can repeat the same footage, over and over and over and over and over.... (I do realize that TV shows need a certain amount of repetition, but 8 times within the same episode?)
5.  Can we get a ridiculously unqualified female climber?  And, can we make her look even more stupid?  Just for laughs?

In an attempt to make things more dramatic, as is usual with reality TV, some of the realism seems lacking.  I'm normally a huge Discovery fan, but if there is a season 3....I'll pass....I've basically already seen it.",1247616000,21,1414,4.413127413127413

Some people won't make it because they are not physically fit and some because they are not mentally fit. I found it easy to identify with the characters and eagerly watched every obstacle encountered up the mountain.

The series is absoluting addicting. I showed this to friends who insisted they would not watch it and they also became addicted.

3466548,5,B001AS5XNA,"This is the 2nd round for Tim and Mogens.  Just after watching season 1, I felt the frustration for those who coudn't reach the summit.  I'm a climber and I know those feelings.  Season two is as good as season 1, more faster and less introductions and details than season 1.  Cameras now have better shots from camps, also a good training on the ice wall.  Unfortunately for Betsy (the journalist) she paid the price for underestimate Everest (no training for 10 years), she collapses.
Also in this season you can see two familiar faces (Tim and Mogens), plus the old man (japanese) that broke the record reaching the summit at 71.

3466549,5,B001AS5XNA,"I thought this was a very good show and the DVD was superior to the first season because of all the extras. The reason that I say it was ""almost as good as the first season"" in the title is because once you have experience it the first time then you aren't as caught off guard by the danger and the astonishing facts about climbing Everest. Another reason I didn't find it as good was and is on the cover of the DVD box. The fact that this lady reporter was involved when she had no experience (or little or none) and that so much time was spent on her ineptitude was really irritating. And again, why she is on the cover of the box is really aggrivating since she was such a small part of the show, or should have been and because she was pretty much shown to be a fraud who got on the show just simply for the story and to be on the show. Still a great series and still full of tension and thrilling moments and great photography.",1229731200,2,932,4.070652173913044
3466550,5,B001AS5XNA,"Don't hesitate on this one! Grab it! The second season PLUS what in my opinion is an equally important bonus area of discussion [all visual material] including various of the series participants and extra input from those who need no introduction to their high altitude climbing credentials and mountaineering achievements. So too, in the bonus material, the hard questions [read: TV documentary criticisms] of the documentary on Everest are not avoided nor in any way sugar-coated. You're looking at approximately 7 hours of visual material here between the TV episodes and the added bonus discussion material consisting of 4 extended episodes entitled, ""Everest: After the Climb"" . You absolutely can't beat it for under $15.00! This was the price [$14.97] when I did the review.

I'll lay my cards on the table and as I always do especially if commenting on films [documentary or fiction!] or books that deal with the climbing and/or mountaineering community. I'm tired of seeing Russell Brice used as a sort of handy and proverbial punching bag and especially by, inter alia,  various and sundry types who wouldn't know a belay from a ballet or whose knowledge of high altitude climbing and its 'realities' wholly escapes them. Still others take the view that Brice is somehow the perceived ""culprit"" and allegedly 'responsible' [!?] for the David Sharp matter [2006] as if Russell had some hidden magic wand and could simply wave it around a few times and, voila, some 20 Sherpas could be made to suddenly materialize from his tent to initiate high altitude rescues of virtually anyone in trouble and regardless of altitude issues or weather considerations.

The bonus material addresses various of these considerations. But it also addresses the 'realities' of high altitude climbing in general. For example, the question is put on the table in virtually any mountain rescue attempt by the narrator: Does it come down to a matter of ""who should be or shouldn't be rescued"" and Brice responds, rightly so in my opinion, that it has nothing to do with who 'should' or 'shouldn't be' rescued issues but rather a more realistic appraisal of ""who CAN be rescued"" and whether it is 'possible' and logistically feasible to do it! You don't produce the resources for a mountain rescue out of nothing! Or 'thin air', as it were. And the weather at hand is a significant factor not to mention the perils of the higher one climbs or the intricacies/complexities of the route. Naturally, there are always the exceptions to the rule who almost miraculously are saved but then these exceptions become the benchmarks for those who know nothing about high altitude climbing making with, ""See! 'X' and 'Y' were saved! Why not 'Z' ?"" It's simply not that easy! Look at the cumulative mountaineering experience of both Rob Hall and Scott Fischer [1996] but factors were present on the mountain that day which precluded their rescue. Folks can't relate that 'feet/meters' can be like 'miles/kilometers' in places like Everest and K2 [et al] -- that's something they just can't comprehend not to mention navigation issues during a white-out or numbing cold 'despite' protective and modern insulation gear.

In any event, I think the visual discussion material following the second season episodes is well worth the listen! And the realities of high altitude mountaineering. We're also in the age of so-termed ""adventure tourism"" with a literal proliferation of various world-wide commercial entities offering to take clients to ""you name it"" but it's also true, IMO, that some of these clients have no business being at places like Everest or K2 where their prior climbing experience is virtually negligible not to mention altitude issues where some actually believe that the use of bottled oxygen brings them to 'sea level' breathing or that fixed ropes right to the summit itself 'assures a summit' --- NOTHING is 'assured' since it can't be! And it's not 'just' the weather to force one back, it's a whole gammut of factors than can go wrong and at 'any' level on the mountain much less over 26,000 feet. Client temperament(s) notwithstanding.

It seems to me that certain websites have almost dedicated themselves to Russell Brice bashing with a veritable laundry list litany of J'accuse mongering so that if Russell can't pull off ad hoc rescue miracles while pulling rescuers from his derriere, as it were, or indeed take 'anyone' to the summit and back no matter how they are faltering or showing their lack of experience and/or physical stamina limitations on the trial runs, ahh, then he's the proverbial and alleged ""don't give a ****"" bad guy! Sherpas and guides are NOT there to die for the aspirations of the client especially, I'll add at once, for the client who despite literal hours of cajoling and pleading to turn back, proceed forward and perhaps expect and damn the consequences to both themselves and others -- or to be hand-held or short-roped to their dream. In the series, various 'did' finally listen to reason and turned back but the reality is that some do not despite the best efforts of others [including climbing partners or expedition leaders in some scenarios] to reason with them. And some of them are still up there. Or indeed, miraculously rescued 'by' the climbing community ... at least when feasible and possible to do so.
