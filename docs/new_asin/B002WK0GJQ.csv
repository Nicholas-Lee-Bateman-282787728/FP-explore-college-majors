8383197,4,B002WK0GJQ,I really enjoy viewing the beautiful scenery. It really helps pass the time. The sound track is mostly pleasant instrumental. would be better in high definition.,1394150400,,161,5.230769230769231
8383198,4,B002WK0GJQ,I ordered a couple of these Bike-O-Vision dvds to use with my indoor spin bike.  I really enjoy the scenery and I am able to adjust my speed and tension based on ups and downs of the roads.  The music is ok; helps me keep my pedalling rhythm.  I will probably order more just to have more options for scenery.,1392249600,,309,4.116666666666666
8383199,5,B002WK0GJQ,"This is my favorite Bike O Vision dvd so far.  A nice blend of cycling through the woods, under the shade of the enormous sequoias and then onto the dramatic switch back road through the Canyon.  The music was different than the other BOV dvd's I have.  There is more flute music that ranges from 'Native American' sounding and 'Middle-ages/ Celtic' sounding .  It is often accompanied by what sounds like dulcimer music and wind chimes.  Very 'new-agey'.  I also like the way that  one goes slower while heading up hill and then we speed up a bit as we go downhill. I agree with others that sometimes we go a little too fast, so I appreciated the slower speed, at times.  If you like a lot of variety in your scenery, you won't be disappointed. However,  I did find myself a little let down  that there was a 30 minute segment in the middle that featured overcast skies, but one doesn't see the sky that often once we're down into the canyon..",1392076800,,944,4.404624277456647
8383200,5,B002WK0GJQ,"I own several Bike-O-Vision DVDs and this one has the best scenery, with winding mountain roads, cliffs and giant sequoia trees.",1367798400,,128,5.142857142857143
8383201,5,B002WK0GJQ,"These are great videos to train to. After trying a few others type of videos, these ones are by far the best. Driving speed is perfect, slows down and speeds up at the right level on climbs/descents. I'd recommend this for home training sessions.",1365638400,,246,4.613636363636363
8383202,5,B002WK0GJQ,"The photography and music makes this DVD a pleasant and relaxing way to ride my exercise bike.  I was not disappointed..and appreciated the music, and scenery changes.  I will be purchasing more of their DVD's.",1327968000,2,210,4.9714285714285715
