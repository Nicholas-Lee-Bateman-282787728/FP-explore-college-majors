8571735,3,B00BNVD5XY,"It was in 1992 that prolific filmmaker Jing Wong wrote and produced a cult action Naked Killer; ten years later he again wrote and produced Naked Weapon (meet Maggie Q). Another ten years have passed, and, not surprisingly, he writes and produces Naked Soldier, of which storyline is pretty similar to that of Weapon. (Sorry, but no naked women this time.)

Sammo Hung Kam-Bo plays Chi-Keung Lung, a retired Interpol officer whose daughter Phoenix (Jennifer Tse, actor Nicholas Tses sister) has been missing after being kidnapped by a group of assassins that attacked him and his family fifteen years ago. Phoenix, brainwashed, has been raised and trained by Madame Rose (Ellen Chan), leader of some mysterious organization, to be a deadly assassin.

Martial arts action is choreographed by Corey Yuen, who makes good use of closed space (one fight scene takes place in a large bathtub). The combat sequences are decent and entertaining enough, if not very original. Such actors as Andy On and Ian Powers appear and show what they can do in the action scenes, but it is female players that are more impressive, including Ankie Beilke and Lena Lin as Roses female assassins. Also, Anthony Wong appears in a cameo role.

The films tone is uneven at best, sometimes violent, sometimes comical, always refusing to take itself too seriously. The story is often silly and some of the players are very wooden in their stereotypical roles, but at least action is not bad.",1386460800,,1463,4.939024390243903
