8726628,5,B012TXCZ6M,"Every few years the stars align and an anime is released that is so ridiculously insane and hilarious that it reminds you of one of the reasons you started watching anime in the first place. Daily Lives of High School Boys is one of these anime.

The title describes the show halfway decently but it does not at all convey the amount of ridiculous stuff that happens in this show. Explaining much more would almost ruin it. Trust me when I say it's better to go in knowing little to nothing.

This blu-ray contains all the episodes and a few extras. I cannot comment on the dubbing but the original Japanese voice acting conveys the jokes perfectly. There's not much more to say about the blu-ray itself, but to get to the point, if you enjoy physical media, this is worth adding to your collection.

If you like random, pee-your-pants funny shows like ""Nichijou"", and ""Gintama"" with a little ""Azumanga Daioh"" and ""Havent You Heard? I'm Sakamoto"" mixed in, then this may be exactly what you are looking for. Go for it!",1462406400,6,1018,4.582417582417582
