The kids were grown when I found some epesodes on vhs and bought them.  Now it is fun to put them in and watch them now and again.  Wish I could find them on dvd.  So yes I liked this show.",1366934400,,304,3.703125
8040002,5,B000682AUO,"This is another of the wonderful Shining Time Station videos.  All of my 5 kids have loved all the Shining Time episodes, including this video. My son sings along with the songs and has requested a new tape because he wore out his old one from watching it so often.  You can't go wrong with Shining Time Station.  I wish they still showed the original entire shows on TV for this generation of kids.  The Thomas the Tank Engine was only a part of the episodes.  The wonderful episodes at the station with Stacy, Mr. Conductor, Billy, the kids, etc. were wonderful stories that taught great morals.",1283558400,,597,4.542056074766355
