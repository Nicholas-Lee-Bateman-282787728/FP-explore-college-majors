Overall it was okay, interesting if your into scotch and scotland but don't get it for clann an drumma. If that is why you are buying it, don't waste your money.",1306627200,2,314,4.233333333333333
8215588,5,B0007KX4GK,"The Malt Project videos in general are of excellent quality, and of interest to the new and experienced Malt Whisky lover. Mamy people will never be able to visit Scotland and take-in the sights and sounds of this vibrant country and people. This series could be the next best thing.
Volume 2 specifically looks at the Isla music and whisky festival. Distilleries are visited, whisky personalities are interviewed, and the festival visited. One does not go to Isla by accident, it's not hard to get to, but it's off the beaten track for most tourists. If this video does not convince people to travel to Isla, I'll be surprised indeed!
The scenery is magnificent, the interviews are insightful, the pace is friendly and restful.
The team, from California, that put this video together can be proud of the accomplishment. They have missed nothing of the atmosphere and terroir of this Single Malt Island.
The videos in this series are not cheap, but they are well worth the asking price. Even if the whisky is not your thing, the video is worth it for the scenery and the insight into life on the island...The Music's great too!

here you step into a deep descent into Islay world.
Many aspect was captured by great image and videos, accompained by a great music and editing. Excellent image quality and a good timing let you entertain Islay, and for who was been there almost one time, it miss more than before, and for anyone who never been there, desire of a travel increase incredibly. An excellent purchase of a professional product. You learn so much think, right for the passionist than for the expert. In One word:BUY!",1206316800,2,602,4.635514018691588
8215590,3,B0007KX4GK,"Very interesting, lovely scenery, learned a lot about malt whiskey. Not being a whiskey drinker, I was mainly wanting to see more of Clann an Drumma, the featured band. I saw them live at the Scottish Games at Grandfather Mountain, N.C. and they were awesome! I have since found their website and will order their CD's from there.",1202774400,,330,4.706896551724138
