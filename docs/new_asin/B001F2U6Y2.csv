 KIDS FIRST! Adult Juror Comments: (Kids First Organization)

This video is a wonderful way for anyone to introduce the Spanish language to children. It could be used in a school environment or home. Ms. Blanca is clearly a warm and gifted teacher and any child watching this will benefit from her presentation. The Spanish words explored in the video are perfect for young audiences and are presented in a repetitive yet joyous manner such that children are encouraged to genuinely say and learn the words. It's very colorful and very ""real"" - not a highly produced program. Instead, it's to the point and it works.

KIDS FIRST! KID Juror Comments: (Kids First Organization)

Kids enjoyed it, especially the music and the puppets. One said, ""I want to know more Spanish words."" All of the children really liked Ms. Blanca. One girl in particular kept wanting to only see her. She kept asking, ""Where's the girl"" whenever Ms. Blanca wasn't in the frame. They loved the words for the items often seen at a party. In fact, when the word ""popcorn"" came up, one of the children wanted popcorn so much that the teacher stopped and made popcorn before moving on. Another little girl, after watching it twice asked for a rojo popsicle because, as she said, ""rojo in Spanish means red."" They particularly enjoyed learning the Spanish word for ""jump."" Afterwards, they all got up and jumped around. They enjoyed repeating the words after Ms. Blanca, although some repeated in English not Spanish. The piata was another hit with them.

 Antonio's review:

30 minutes class with Ms Blanca interacting with children 3 to 5 years old. Children likes to watch it over an over and the best part is that they learn more than 100 words in Spanish or English with topics like colors, numbers, greetings, manners and party words in a fiesta environment, with music videos, marionettes and puppets . This is a very good material for a class room, home school or home. A tutor in DVD at a great price. You can download the music of the movie and her other songs in itunes, just look for Ms Blanca in the artist box.

REVIEW LINK FROM: THE OLD HOMESCHOOL MAGAZINE:

La Fiesta! is a bilingual educational DVD aimed at teaching Spanish to preschool children. It is intended for ages 3 and up. The DVD features Ms. Blanca Castro, a native Spanish speaker born in Monterrey, Mexico.

The DVD opens with a puppet scene in which two puppets are discussing an upcoming party. One puppet lets the other know that the only way to go to the party is to learn some new Spanish words. The DVD then moves into a musical preschool class setting with teacher Ms. Blanca. Here we learn the numbers 1-10, party words (cake, clown, present, and more), colors, and greetings. There is also a segment that teaches about Mexican culture. At the end of the movie, there is a party with piatas. An additional bonus feature teaches the numbers 1-20.

La Fiesta! makes use of music and repetition to teach Spanish words. I was impressed with the amount of Spanish that is packed into the 30-minute running time. My children learned many new words, which I have observed them using since they saw the DVD for the first time. The use of puppets, preschool children, and catchy music all worked together to capture the attention of my children. My 4-year-old and 7-year-old daughters both enjoyed this DVD. My baby was also drawn to the music.

The teaching is clear and easy to follow with one exception. There is a Spanish phrase in the number song that I had to listen to more than once before I understood what Ms. Blanca was saying.

This DVD is both educational and entertaining. It is a lovely introduction to Spanish for the preschool crowd. Early elementary aged children will enjoy and benefit from La Fiesta!
