3111554,4,B0013J55B6,"Sometimes you're worse off with the cure. Take Los Angeles, for instance, which boasts its own superhero. But this superhero is a misanthrope - a rude cuss, a woman-groper, and an everyday boozer. He dresses like homeless and saves lives like he's playing that Whack-the-Gopher game. In his crimefighting methods, he's not very careful or that sensitive to stuff around him. His disastrous heroics tend to cost the city millions of dollars in collateral damage, not to mention further endangering the Los Angelinos. No wonder then that Hancock isn't much appreciated. The kids don't even look up to this guy.

Hancock is an impenetrable jerk. He acts like he doesn't care much about anything (yet he keeps on saving lives, so we all know he actually does give a fig, somewhere deep inside). Things change for him when he saves a man, Ray Embrey, from death by train. Turns out Ray is a down-and-out publicity agent. To repay Hancock, he offers to revamp his public image. Surprisingly, Hancock takes him up on it.

I think we've all seen the trailers by now to know that, as part of his image rehabilitation, Hancock is convinced by Ray to turn himself in, when a warrant is issued for his arrest (based on Hancock's misconducts during his heroics). The thinking is that, with Hancock incarcerated, the crime rate will shoot up and then it's only a matter of time before the call goes out for Hancock to resume his thing. This happens, and Hancock emerges from prison a more polite, more couth superhero, clad in sleek leather threads, and cognizant of property values.

But that's only half the story. HANCOCK started out pretty much to form, raucous and punching holes in the superhero mythos. I had an amazingly good time during the first half of the film. But then things took a turn for the serious, as the film begins delving into existential stuff, as Hancock goes thru whatever one goes thru when there's only one of his kind. There's quite a bit more to John Hancock, so much more that the movie doesn't even really get into it. There's an explanation for his origin, and what an ambitious origin it is, too. His past history, we learn, is glorious and tragic and spans much longer than you'd think. There's a romance for Hancock, but it's one soaked in tragic underpinnings. The film's second half will make or break it for the moviegoers, as it goes very much against convention, strays off the safe path and onto a messier one.

I do like that HANCOCK doesn't go for the easy. As mentioned, I really enjoyed the first half, when it was all light and comic. When things took a darker turn, it startled me. Then I got curious as to where the picture would take me. Will Smith is truly one of the most bankable movie stars around, and I'll always watch whatever film he's in. HANCOCK offers up a Will Smith that we're not used to. This guy on screen is grumpy and mean and a hard drinker. Yet I liked John Hancock from the get-go, perhaps because this film was touted as a comedy (and I guess being grumpy and mean is allowed if in a comedic venue) and, more definitely, because it's Will Smith. But Smith can also act. I think that's been proven without a doubt. So he adds that extra layer of realism to his preposterous character. The other two leads are good, as well. Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron (who plays his wife) are very much key to driving the plot. And I defy you to not have your heart go out to Jason's character, who's truly a good guy at heart.

There are no mega-villains in HANCOCK (In fact, the main villain, if you can call him that, is a little weak). Surprisingly, the special effects aren't about to bowl anyone over (but they're not bad), and there's not as much superhero action as you'd like. There's much comedy gold in the first half (yes, including that initial prison scene as the inmates challenge Hancock), and lots of drama and angst and heartache in the second half. The film earns all of its PG-13 rating. I laughed myself silly in some places, and wondered about a lot of the stuff director Peter Berg and the writers were attempting. And, when all's said and done, I ended up liking the film. But it's up in the air whether you will.",1214956800,14,4185,4.552456839309429
3111555,4,B0013J55B6,"Hancock (Will Smith) is not your garden variety superhero.  Let's just say that his crime fighting tactics usually involve booze, obscenities, and millions of dollars in property damage.  That all changes one day when Hancock saves the life of a publicist named Ray (Jason Bateman).  Ray wants to help Hancock change his image in exchange for Hancock's saving his life.  The reluctant superhero adheres to Ray's advice to become reformed.  He spends time in jail, and upon his release he is a ""true"" superhero ready to fight crime, booze free.

""Hancock"" is really the only one of its kind.  A refreshing change from comic book based movies and it definitely provides plenty of competition.  The film has enough comedy, plot twists and action to keep you on the edge of your seat.  Will Smith once again proves why he is one of the best actors right now.  He does an incredible job showing character development, from boozing loser with a bad attitude to outstanding hero in the spotlight.  I cannot say it's Will Smith's best performance because every year he does not cease to amaze.  In a summer full of blockbusters, ""Hancock"" has the potential to be a big one.",1214870400,3,1165,4.77
3111556,1,B0013J55B6,"The worst part about this movie had to be when the credits started rolling at the end of the film, and I just realized that almost 2 hours of my life had just been snatched away from me like an old lady's purse, and there was no chance I'd ever get them back.  I'd also like to say that there was probably a 50/50 chance that Will Smith was hanging with Amy Winehouse when he decided to sign up for this project.",1214870400,7,412,4.024390243902439
3111557,4,B0013J55B6,"I have seen the commercials for ""Hancock"" so many times that I was definitely afraid that this was going to be one of those movies where all of the good stuff is already in the trailer.  Then when I went to see it tonight (having midnight shows at 7 and 8 is an odd way of doing it) and there were only three dozen people in the theater I was wondering if maybe Will Smith's reputation as Mr. Fourth of July (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Independence-Day/dp/B00005V9IK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Independence Day</a>,"" ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Men-in-Black/dp/B0000640SB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Men in Black</a>,"" etc.) when it comes to opening movies was going to take a big hit.  However, I think that is not going to happen because those trailers for ""Hancock"" that we have seen over and over again show scenes that all take place in the first half of the movie.  You have seen the trailers for this movie and you know the set up, but you are never going to guess what this movie is really about.  I liked the change in direction, but that might not be the case with everybody; but until reviewers, friends, or new trailers ruin things I have to think you will be surprised.

I was trying to think of the last time I saw a movie that surprised me this much when I found out when it was really about.  It would have to be ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Village/dp/B00064LJVE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Village</a>,"" where Joaquin Phoenix is on the cover of ""Entertainment Weekly"" and then I am watching the movie and thinking that it really should be about Bryce Dallas Howard's character and, viola, that is what happened.  But what happens with ""Hancock"" is not like that, so do not worry they are going the ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Executive-Decision/dp/0790731894/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Executive Decision</a>"" route where the star gets killed in Act I.  With ""Hancock"" surprise is what happens in Acts II and III.  Of course, I want you to be surprised too so there is not much more I can say, because even telling you that there is a surprise is not going to stop you from being surprised (I picked up on what, in retrospect, would have been a clue but I certainly did not read it that way when it went by).  Connecting the dots at the end becomes a bit problematic and director Peter Berg had me flashing back to ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cloverfield/dp/B0014Z4OQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cloverfield</a>"" for a moment when he circled the camera around the title character over and over again at one point, but on balance the movie definitely provided more than the previews promised (although I wish Hancock had put off turning over a new leaf until after he dealt with Nancy Grace).

I also liked the fact that this superhero movie ends up being one of the more adult ones of recent vintage; you have the media totalling up how much damage he does each day and a superhero who drinks, curses, and more(although the reaction shots of the cons reacting to what happens when Hancock does what he keeps threateing to do is way funnier than when we actually get to see it).  Parents dragging their kids expecting to see another funny and charming Will Smith are going to be taken aback a bit when he starts swearing, and I mean serious he-would-never-do-this-in-a-rap-record type swearing.  However, he does it because there is a point where he stops and a point to that point.  More importantly, Hancock is not a comic book superhero of the DC and Marvel variety because when he goes after bad guys who are killing people, he has no compunction about tossing them out a window with no intention of catching them.  Time and time again I have been disappointed by the big fights to the finish at the end of the movie (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spider-Man-2/dp/B00005JMQW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spider-Man 2</a>"" would be my standard of how it should be done), but ""Hancock"" ends up with an above average big fight at the end.  Final note:  You have to stay in your seat for a little bit at the start of the end credits because the bonus scene happens early on (to set up the Will Smith credit).  So do not worry about staying the whole way through and do not get caught in the aisles stopped to watch the bonus scene).  You have been warned.",1214870400,6,4532,5.243430152143845

3111560,5,B0013J55B6,"This is a very entertaining film. It's the first family friendly, African American super hero film to truly have a large budget. The film is very funny and Smith and Theron have great chemistry. Bateman is great as usual. Hancock was depressed and behaved badly. Bateman and Theron helped him to change his image. He cleaned up his act and became a hero that people could root for. This was a fun film but due to the fact that Hancock was antisocial at first and basically a God he didn't have the strong family support that Steel, Blankman and Meteor Man had. That family support made those characters seem more realistic and grounded in African American culture. Nevertheless, this is an enjoyable film. Smith fans will love it. Fans of this film may also enjoy Meteor Man!",1517875200,,775,4.664233576642336

When he does good like saving people.  He causes a lot of collateral damage and the public wonders if he is really worth the trouble.  So he saves one man's life.  Who happens to think he could use an image make over.  The man's wife is the always beautiful Charlize Theron who just happens to know more about the real Hancock.

So he does the work but cant find any kind of fulfillment because he doesnt know who he is and this leaves him empty and he is unable to find any joy in what he does so his heart is not in his work. Hes a man who saves everyone and is cared for by no one. Thats is where Ray comes in. He sees past the man and to the heart and sets out to do all he can to help.

It also has a very original story line, with a very nice twist to the movie; this actually ends up being a bit of a tear jerker. One of the most unique super-hero movies produced to date. Will Smith is at his best, as a misunderstood, drunk superhero who does as much damage as good, until he finally meets someone with some compassion for his obvious pain. As his story unfolds, it gets more and more interesting. There are mysteries at work here! If you have not seen it, do it, you won't be sorry!

On the surface, this movie seems like just another comedy action movie. But there's a much deeper message about human nature, love, and relationships lingering just beneath the surface, which drew me in and left me oscillating between laughing and crying. The deeper message may not have been executed as directly, clearly, and seamlessly as it could have been, but for those of us who ""get it""...well, we get it and appreciate the film maker's decision to release this less-than-conventional action comedy. :)",1471478400,,677,4.794871794871795

3111743,4,B0013J55B6,"Hancock is an abnormal superhero who is depicted as a homeless, alcoholic, depressed man. Who tries to help as much he can, but due to his problems he only seems to make things work. In the beginning of the movie it appears that a robbery has taken place and there is now a shootout on the freeway. Hancock feels obligated to help but ends up taking out a highway sign, destroying a section of the highway, and damaging a building with a total cost of 9 million dollars. This characteristic of Hancock was used to start off a radical change from within ones self, and to show that even though he is a super-human we tend to focus more on the super and forget about the human.
 As this movie was made in the mid 2000s (2008) and America was in the midst of a great recession, where many people and soldiers were becoming homeless due to the Housing Bubble popping. The movie forces us to watch how we treat our heroes, super or otherwise. Although Hancock starts out as a drunken, stumbling nuisance, but in reality he is actually a man who just wants to be loved. He feels alone, afraid, ostracized by the public. He urns for the public to love him, and pushes them away to protect his inner insecure self. However, once he starts teaming up with Ray Embrey, a man whose mission is to bring peace and prosperity to the world. Through Hancock he can make that dream happen, as well as nurture and help this broken man.
 Embrey, is supposed to represent the change America needs, whereas the rest of the world represents the current America consensus on the homeless and the poor. They only see the exterior of these people, the dirty clothes, the foul breathe, the rude demeanor. When in reality, under all of that is a scared person, who had dreams, fears, responsibilities, and possibly a family, just like them. Will Smith helped produced this to get that message out to the public who was too blind to see.
 Another thing I noticed that the society within this movie is how they are very invertebrate when it comes to a stance on certain topics. For example, When Hancock is trying to help the citizens from the dangers of everyday life. They ridicule him, and take him for granted because they feel they can. However, once he appeases the public and goes to jail to serve for his crimes, they quickly have a change of heart as they see what he truly was doing for them. He may have been ineffective in stopping crimes safely, he was still their shield. He was a deterrent to crime, and once you take that away you realize how unsafe you are. This can be seen as another parallel to the treatment of returning veterans. Although we take them for granted as we see them homeless sleeping on the bench. We forget what they did for us. Imagine if they didn't serve to protect us, where we might be. Maybe the war would be a lot closer to home, than it was. The underappreciated veterans put their lives on the line to protect and serve, and now they are treated like scum. How can this be acceptable in todays society? This is what the movie tries to address.
 Hancock is a social drama that depicts the lifestyle of a veteran, and other citizens in an entertaining setting so that it will reach a wide variety of audiences. Now although this movie is allowed for young kids. In actuality people around the age group of 18-30 who are middle class will understand the meaning behind the film. This movie on top of having an amazing message on the social structure of society, it also is an extremely entertaining movie, with a heartfelt story of a man who just wants to belong to something; And in the end everything works out. Embrey helps the world, while Hancock finds his place in the world and becomes loved by the public like he wanted.
4 out of 5 stars would see again.",1446595200,,3775,4.4508670520231215
3111744,4,B0013J55B6,"The movie Hancock has appropriately demonstrated the old phrase in our modern society: with great power comes great responsibility. Hancock has all the superpower that anyone can strive for. He is bulletproof, has super-strength, and can fly. Even with these great abilities, Hancock is not appreciated by the citizens of Los Angeles due to his severe alcoholism and carelessness. Beyond the plot of the story, the background music (below stated as BGM) aids not only to create the mood of his ineptness before he meets his mentor Ray but also to create the suspense whenever he is on a heroic scene. In addition to the sound effects, visual aids such as Hancocks outfit clearly shows the transition of his image from a homeless drunk to a praise-worthy superhero.
 The movie starts with Hancock waking up in an old ghetto neighborhood. He wakes up from a bench with his hobo-looking outfit and a box of liquor underneath him, which shows that he has a drinking problem. Then, the boy who woke up Hancock tells him that there are criminals getting chased by police on the highway. After, seeing the situation on the TV, Hancock blasts himself off and flies to the highway, while destroying the road, bench and a fire hydrant during the process. Not only that but also in the beginning of the movie, when he faces the Asian criminals, he flies off with them on the truck and damages the citys buildings. At the end of that scene, Hancock sticks the truck on top of the famous Capitol Records Building as if were dunk-shooting. The background music that was used in this scene is a song called Move B*tch, written by Lil Jon, which is a hip-hop genre music that aids to create the sense of Hancocks clumsiness. The song reminds the viewers of old ghetto hood, which Hancock usually stays. Although, Hancock has saved a lot of people and helped to lower the crime rates in Los Angeles, he is not appreciated by the citizens of LA since he causes a lot of damages in the city, leading to higher taxes. Due to this, Hancock always feels lonely and alcohol is the only company he has all the time, and the scene where a slow, sad music depicts his loneliness as he drinks alone in the bar.
 One day, Hancock saves Rays life from an oncoming freight train. Hancock still gets jeered because he derailed the train and damaged many cars while saving Ray. But then, Ray steps in thanks Hancock in front of everyone for saving his life and asks Hancock to have dinner with him. Hancock then visits Ray more often, which shows that he is feeling kindness in such a long time or for the first time and he wants more of it. Ray believes that Hancock deserves to have a good image for the public as a superhero so he comes with a plan and makes Hancock to go to the jail to pay up all the lawsuits and court subpoenas that he has been ignoring. This scene is the introduction of Hancocks mentor, Ray that changes Hancocks life entirely and the BGM aids to give a sense of starting something new. The BGM has the gospel theme melodies that tells the viewers that something good is to about to emerge.
 At the jail, Hancock sees a lot of criminals that were sent there because of him. When Hancock was on his way to his cell, two of the criminals blocks his way. Hancock clearly tells them to move because he wants to stay quiet and do his time in the jail but they didn't move. Then, Hancock sticks up one guys head inside the other guys anus. This scene was funny for me but knowing that this movie is rated PG-13, it seemed inappropriate for its rating. Not only this scene but also the use of words such as a**hole or the f-word seemed inappropriate. I get that this movie is a superhero movie and to make a good amount of profit the production company needs to set it as PG-13 as it is the sweet-money spot general viewers of heroic movies are usually kids at younger age but in my personal opinion, I would think that the movie would have been better if the movie depicted more of Hancock being just a co*k.
 When in jail, Hancock gets released early by the request of the chief of LAPD. A group of bank robbers were holding hostages wrapped around with bombs but the police could not go near them since the robbers threatened to blow them if they get closer and that is why Hancock was needed. So then, Hancock makes his intro to the crime scene by flying around the buildings in stealth-speed and in that scene, the BGM with loud trumpet sounds make his intro very dramatic and heroic unlike his past appearances in the movie. In addition, Hancock is wearing his new hero outfit for the first time that was given by Ray while Hancock was in jail. Hancocks new leather jacket outfit and fancy sunglasses show that he has become a professional hero unlike his past as a homeless looking clumsy superpower monster.
  Overall, the movie showed another dimension of the heroic-movie world that all heroes aren't perfect and they do not have to wear a cape or have a funny outfit to look special. Aside from that, the BGM and the appearance of characters did a splendid job to help the viewers understand the plot and to get into the movie. I rate 8 stars out of 10 for this movie.",1446508800,,5166,4.472958642629904

3111825,4,B0013J55B6,"As good as any ""superhero"" movie - honestly I enjoyed the hell out of it, but mostly because Smith truly made the anti-hero thing work so well as he graduated into actual hero throughout. Recommend nothing less than the unrated version though...if you watch anything else you unfortunately miss a couple of the BEST gags in the whole flick! Nevertheless, worth the money to add to any collection and SO worth the watch. Both dramatically riveting and hysterical all at once.

At this point, Bateman was still basically cutting his teeth in the larger market movies but still playing 2nd fiddle. However, he shows his acting shops all throughout ""Hancock"" and proves yet again he was ready to be the *HMFIC*!! He has some of the best expressions and delivery combinations that sometimes I can't even believe it's actually Jason Bateman. Overall, if you happen to like anything even remotely hero related, or Will Smith / Jason Bateman / Charlize Theron related, you are truly missing something good if you haven't yet seen ""Hancock"".",1424995200,,1032,4.931034482758621

3111834,4,B0013J55B6,"Alcoholic superhero John Hancock (Will Smith) is Los Angeless champion. The only problem is as much as the city needs him, he causes so much damage when fighting crime and rescuing others that the city also wishes they were without him. Enter Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), a PR guy whos just been turned down again after pitching his All Heart logo to different charitable organizations. When Hancock saves Embrey from an oncoming train, Embrey offers to restore Hancocks image to the public while also giving a nice boost to his own career. When Hancock meets Embreys wife, Mary (Charlize Theron), he soon discovers that him and her have a forgotten past, one thats already altered their future and will do so again unless history repeats itself.

Wow. This is a cool movie and a take on superheroes thats unique. Though an alcoholic superhero is nothing new (Tony Stark aka Iron Man is a drunk), making a guy whos like Superman an alcoholic is, and seeing the ramifications of that play out is something this superhero fan was excited to see. Not only that, but you got to see what an inebriated superhero looks like as he uses his abilities. The haphazard way Hancock flies shows one of the dangers of such raw power if its not under restraint.

The mythology brought forth in this tale is well done and turns the superhero notion on its head, bringing in the idea of a race of immortals that had once taken the place as gods or angels throughout history. The fact that these superhumans were created in pairs, and that if they chose to stay together they would live a normal life as normal humans and later die, added a level of tragedy to this film that was welcome though tugged at the heartstrings. Sort of that idea of what would you give up for the one you love? And in this case superpowers if you chose to be with them. It also seems that these super pairs have a genuine love for each other so to forego that is a great sacrifice indeed and was something exemplified in this flick.

Never thought Id want to see Will Smith as a superhero. Still have memories of him as the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air running through my head, but the reality is Will Smith is an incredibly talented actor and while he has used his default funny guy now and then, hes pulled off loads of roles where Fresh Prince is but a faint memory and him as John Hancock in this flick is one of those roles. While I personally prefer actors whove portrayed superheroes to only be that one superhero and not take on others, if you put Will in the upcoming Justice League movie as Cyborg, for example, I wouldnt complain and would certainly look forward to it.

Charlize TheronIm a fan. Given the complexity of the Hancock storynamely where Therons character is concernedI really felt bad for her for what shed given up. She also did a good job of holding her own against Will Smith, whos a pretty domineering actor in any scene.

Jason Bateman is, well, Jason Bateman, but I like him so having him along for this super ride was super fine by me.

Hancock is an awesome superhero movie that gives a fresh take on the genre as it doesnt follow the traditional formula. Maybe in the sequel, if they ever make one. I hope they do as Id like to see where the characters and the mythology go from here.

3111838,2,B0013J55B6,"Maybe 2.5 stars. A classic example of a clever and potentially interesting premise -- an alcoholic, sociopathic super-antihero -- scuttled by poor execution. The writing, the directing (by the wildly erratic Peter Berg), the editing and the art direction all manage to conspire to make a mess that starts out wanting to be satire but soon changes streams and wants to be taken very, very, very seriously. Since we never really get to know Hancock or his sort-of-nemesis played by Charlize Theron, all the stuff between them in the 2nd half is hard to take seriously or get very involved in. It's emotionally muddled at best, matched by oddly dark, murky, you-gotta-squint-a-lot art direction. It's one of those movies that feels like two half-movies glued together, neither of which is anywhere near complete.",1421971200,,809,5.090225563909774

3111906,3,B0013J55B6,"After viewing Hancock for the first time, I was initially very impressed and entertained.  After the first half of the film though, I swear that a high school composition student took over the plot.  So let's break it down with my short review of Hancock.

The first half:  Redemption and Entertainment!
I absolutely loved the first half of this movie.  The two main characters are setup so well and you actually care about them.  It felt like this could actually be a real situation.  You love watching Hancock be an alcoholic, inept, socially awkward, superhero and you want him to be better.  Will Smith does a great job with this character.  He is pathetic, yet likable.  You feel Hancock's plight. You pity him.  Ray is your every man that the viewer can relate to.  He's trying to make it in the world and wants to help Hancock fix his image in the city, who has saved his life.  Hancock changes quickly from alcoholic to decent superhero when he voluntarily goes to prison to serve his time for all the collateral damage he inflicts on the city.  I wish the entire movie would have been about Hancock's redemption and recovery.  At the end of the first half, he saves the people from some bank robbing evil guys in a heroic fashion.  Heck, just watch the movie until here and turn it off.  I'm actually content with this.

The Second Half: Stupid Plot Conveniences
The second half of the film is a train wreck of stupidity.  Everything written in it is just for either a) fighting, b) plot convenience.  So Hancock learns that Ray's wife Mary, who by this time just complains about Hancock and stares creepily at him, is also a super hero who knows about Hancock's forgotten past.  Who cares?!  The plot so far has been the redemption of Hancock and the success of Ray.  Why do we care she is a super hero?  We care about Hancock and Ray, not this woman.  We also don't care about Hancock's past, we want his future to be better.  So anyway, this is where the plot stumbles along in the most elementary way possible.  We learn the rules of how superheros are made, something about how Hancock and Mary have some rules about how they have to be close together or apart or something to be superheros.  It just feels like this crap is made up as they go along to move the plot forward.  Then the dumbest thing in the whole movie happens.  Mary and Hancock go way out of town to talk and Mary claims she can't reveal the truth to Hancock about his past.  This pisses off Hancock and he flies back to the city to tell Ray Mary's secret about being a superhero.  Mary chases him and they have a superhero fight in the city, destroying large parts of the city and endangering thousands of people.  During this fight, Mary starts revealing the past.  Uh, ok?  The decision of these two to behave this way is stupid.  The only reason it was done is because they wanted two super heroes to fight.  Apparently they are husband and wife........ok?  Who cares?  So Hancock gets shot, Mary gets shot (who cares?) and Hancock gets away and makes them both stronger based on the arbitrary rules the writers wrote while they were drunk.  The point is, no one cares.

Anyway, the final verdict is 3 stars.  Here is why.  The first half is great.  This should have been the whole movie.  We want to see Hancock continue to improve, then encounter another obstacle which will challenge him to not slip back into alcoholism, and save the day.  The entire story was setup well for the relationship between Hancock and the city of Los Angeles and Ray's efforts to improve that relationship.  The second half of the movie just threw it all out the window.  Incredibly poor writing.

How to fix it?  I would have liked to seen Ray be a single dad who has lost his wife because he couldn't save her because he wasn't strong enough and failed.  So maybe he could save Hancock.  That would be great.  So as the plot goes on, Hancock gets closer and closer to Ray's son.  So eventually Hancock fails or relapses in his alcoholism after being insulted again after being a successful superhero for a while.  For some reason Ray's son gets in a ton of trouble and is close to doom.  Hancock then selflessly sacrifices himself to save Ray's son, completing the redemption of Hancock and fulfilling the demons in Ray that he couldn't save his wife, but this time he DID save his son by saving Hancock.

But what do I know?  I'm not a Hollywood writer.  I can only point out stupid plot holes.",1404000000,,4465,4.481343283582089

3111927,1,B0013J55B6,"I really wanted to like this movie. I like all the actors. I like the concept. This movie had a lot of potential, but for me it turned out to be a huge disappointment.

The tone of this movie shifts back and forth so much, it's like the movie can't decide what it wants to be. Sometimes it's a comedy, sometimes it's a drama, sometimes it's an action movie... But it never does any of these things very well.

Take the comedy aspects. It can be funny at times. But a joke is only funny the first time. When it keeps getting repeated, it's not so funny anymore. This movie takes the same couple of jokes and just beats them into the ground.

- Superhero who destroys stuff in the process? Funny! So let's show him do it every single time he does anything. Not so funny...

- A kid calling him an A------ and he gets mad? Funny! So let's have someone call him an A------ every 5 seconds throughout the movie. Not so funny...

The ""comedy"" here is taken to it's extreme when Hancock literally shoves a man's head up another man's butt, while ""Sanford and Son"" music plays in the background. Wow. HILARIOUS. This is the point at which the movie totally went off the rails for me, and I couldn't watch anymore. I skimmed through the rest of it, just so I could see how it ended. Thankfully, it did end.

Okay, so it's not a good comedy. So how about a drama then? This movie does have some dramatic elements to it that are interesting. But it's hard to take them seriously when the next shot involves the aforementioned head being shoved up a butt. Not to mention that that is completely unbelievable. If it were even possible, those people would be seriously injured, maybe even killed by internal bleeding. But Hancock just plays it for laughs.

Another totally unbelievable part of the movie which really hurt its dramatic credibility is everyone constantly calling Hancock an A------. This is a man with superpowers. If he really is such a jerk (as we are repeatedly told), then would ANYONE want to mess with him? I don't think so. He may be lonely yes, but no one in their right mind would cross him. That's another part where the movie just refuses to be realistic in any way in favor of a cheap laugh. Which would be okay, if it were actually funny. Which it isn't.

So is it an action movie then? If so, it's the worst superhero action movie ever. It has no villains to speak of. Just a superhero working on his public image (and why does he care about that again?). And then there's a whole romantic subplot dominating the second half of the movie, which I skimmed over due to disgust (over the butt scene), boredom, and general non-interest.

One other thing. As soon as I put this movie in, my first thought was, ""Oh so it's one of THOSE movies."" The shaky-camera kind. Don't you just love it when directors substitute actual action with shaking the camera around? I mean, why have the people being filmed actually DO anything when you can just shake the camera around a lot and pretend like something is happening!

So in conclusion, I thought this movie stunk. It had a few funny scenes, but the rest of it was tedious and stupid. I like Will Smith, but this was a total waste of his talent.

I do wish they would make a Hancock 2 and try to make a coherent movie the next time around.. That would probably be the one time that a sequel does better than the original.

3111938,3,B0013J55B6,"Hancock is one of those movies that everyone sort of likes, but never wants to rewatch if it sits within easy reach on a shelf.  It's overlooked more often than not.  On one side, that's a bit of a shame since the script alone is something worth mentioning, but on the other side there's no great loss.

It personifies the anti-hero in the flesh.  He can fly, has super strength, and he's damage proof, basically a Superman without the cloak and fancy laser/x-ray vision and ice breath.  Will Smith plays John Hancock, a more-than-often drunk who has an affinity for helping save lives but can't seem to get the technique down.  As a result, he often causes extensive damage to public and private property.  One day, he saves a struggling Public Relations man who wants nothing more than to change the world.  As a thank you he dissuades a crowd of people from arguing with Hancock's techniques and invites him over for dinner.  There Hancock meets the man's family and is offered some free consultation to allow Hancock to become more of a public figure instead of a public nuisance.

The story, however, is a bit tilted.  At first you think this is going to be a movie about Hancock becoming more of a hero than a threat, but it unfolds that Hancock doesn't really know who he is or where he came from, hence his ambiguous name.  The information is, almost literally, dropped into his lap and there's almost no satisfaction in garnering it for the audience since it was never really a high point of the movie.  The saving grace of this somewhat mediocre storyline is the script and Will Smith's acting.  He plays the perfect sarcastic, socially inept anti-hero.  The script is well put together, if nothing else.

It's worth a watch on, perhaps, Netflix or for a cheap price, but don't expect it to be pulled off the shelves of your movie collection often.",1379548800,4,1858,4.6189024390243905

I couldn't believe that children watched this movie and saw that scene. Some things are better left to the imagination. And I the plot was random...",1372636800,3,439,4.569620253164557
3111945,3,B0013J55B6,"Hancock is a bit of a mixed-blessing.  It starts out as a great take on a superhero as well as a good character study.  However, once the second half of the film starts it kind of becomes a convoluted mess.  I do not hate the second half of the film, but it does not live up to what was setup in the first half.

It starts off with the main character, Hancock (Will Smith), stopping criminals like a traditional superhero would.  However, society condemns Hancock and his actions and reject despite trying to help.  However, Hancock is not a saint either at first.  He is a drunk and quite eccentric.  He also lashes back at the people saying he does not care about them, even though he really does.

I personally find this refreshing.  The idea of society rejecting superheroes is nothing new.  However, Hancock himself is a depiction of a superhero that I do not see that often.  He comes off as very unlikable on the outside but he really just wants the people's recognition, which makes it that much more rewarding when he finally gets it.  I also like the character Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman).  He is the mentor character for Hancock.  Throughout the first half of the movie he makes it his mission to make people like Hancock.  I find him to be a very likable and sympathetic character.  I like how dedicated to Hancock he is.

However, in the second part of the film we start to get into Hancock's origins.  This is where things start to go downhill.  We also find out that Rey's wife Mary (Chalize Theron) is heavily involved in Hancock's past.  Personally I find Hancock's origin to relatively uninteresting.  It is original, but original does not always mean good.  I also do not like the character Mary.  She comes off as too mean in both the first and second part.  I get where she is coming from but I still find her annoying.

I also do not like that Hancock has no big super villain to fight.  The villains he does end up fighting at the end are not interesting at all.  I also find Hancock's weakness to be a bit lame.  Again, I do not hate the second half of the film, but I find it a kind of lame.

The effects for the film are top notch.  The score is outstanding, especially two particular themes.  The themes ""Death and Transfiguration"" and ""Moon and the Superhero"" are some of my favorite themes in superhero movies.

Overall, Hancock is an interesting film.  It had some good ideas, some good characters, and some fun moments.  However, it kind of degenerates by the second half.  However, I do enjoy the film despite its flaws.  I still say it is worth watching at least once.",1371340800,,2600,4.45531914893617

3111948,4,B0013J55B6,"""Hancock"" is great! This is how the story goes: There are heroes, there are superheroes... and then there's Hancock. Conflicted, sarcastic, and misunderstood, Hancock's well-intentioned heroics get the job done, but always seem to leave damage in their wake, with the public wondering why they put up with him. But Hancock doesn't care what other people think, until the day he saves the life of PR executive Ray Embrey, and the superhero begins to realize that he may have a vulnerable side after all. Facing that will be his greatest challenge yet -- and a task that may prove impossible as Ray's wife, Mary, insists that Hancock is a lost cause. The cast led by Will Smith (as Hancock), Charlize Theron (as Mary), and Jason Bateman (as Ray) is great!

3111957,5,B0013J55B6,"As another reviewer pointed out this is really a movie of two halves. The first is a crude humor anti hero superhero movie. Basically if Superman was an alcoholic who saved people and caught bad guys but really did not give a damn. The second half is about the plot twist, and reveals his back story. I won't spoil it, although by now most reading this will already know it. It seems like most people who tend to dislike the movie do so because of the plot twist. I actually did not mind it, but I think the movie would have done fine without it. I liked the whole redemption of a superhero angle that they had going up until then, and there were certainly ways to have a similar ending without the twist.

That said, the movie is not going to appeal to everyone. It definitely has a darker crude humor to it. It is the kind of comedy that you either like or you do not. I think all the actors do a great job, but Jason Bateman was the most entertaining because he had to play the straight man the whole time. It is mostly a comedy action blend, but there is some drama in there too. Charlize Theron sold her character well was, as always, easy on the eyes.

3111971,3,B0013J55B6,"Hancock starts as a straight-up parody. Will Smith's eponymous super-anti-hero is a self-involved, alcoholic jerk who causes so much collateral property damage whenever he tries to fight crime it would be better for everyone if he just let the bad guys get away. He can't pull off the squeaky-clean public persona that his station demands, but gets a chance to turn it around when he saves the life of down on his luck publicist Jason Bateman and the movie sets to mocking the conventions of both comic books and buddy comedies. Will Smith steers his usual charisma to a slightly meaner place, Bateman does a great turn as an earnest nebbish, there are slapstick set pieces in which the hero inadvertently destroys everything in sight, and laughs ensue.

But the the movie works on another level as well, because Smith is black and Bateman is white, giving Hancock the outward form of a Magic Negro redemption story in which a preternaturally kind and sometimes even supernatural black character inexplicably devotes their entire existence to helping a white protagonist get his groove back. That more or less is the plot of the second act of the movie, except where the Magic Negro is beatific Hancock is surly, where the Magic Negro is sexless Hancock makes it with groupies, and where the Magic Negro is ultimately an uninteresting catalyst for white character development Hancock dominates the movie, and would do so on the basis of the script alone, even if he wasn't portrayed by a megawatt star like Smith. That his character plays second banana to a white schlemiel is funny both because one is a man and one is a superman, and because in other movies the same absurd dynamic is presented as natural. At no point does the movie telegraph this particular subtext, and you're free to ignore it, but it adds extra depth to everything.

Then just when you think two levels is enough for any lightweight summer action comedy, Hancock has a huge third act twist that is some ways makes it a profoundly strange movie and in other ways makes it much more like another Batman remake. For my money the ending doesn't quite work: a lot of plot has to get crammed in very quickly, and the climax takes a dark turn which is too tonally jarring given the slapstick that has come before. The last section of Hancock is about two rewrites away from being truly great, but you still admire the filmmakers' audacity. Hancock is worth checking out because it's fun, but worth watching all the way through because it's kind of weird.",1357603200,2,2521,4.740318906605922

The concept of ""redemption"" is a powerful one. I can even honestly say the first third of Hancock was somewhat entertaining, but it went downhill fast! For lack of a better word, the movie became just plain dull! And it's hard to imagine Will Smith in a boring film!

There are so many glaring holes in the story it also became distracting! A good story makes sense within the world the writer has created. When there is absolutely no explanation for major events taking place, an intelligent person will get annoyed! In a nutshell that is the definition of sloppy storytelling! See what happens when Hollywood forces it's writers to go on strike! I bet someone exacted revenge by writing such an erratic and dopey story!

Memo to Hollywood: It's not cool to chop-off both of a person's hands in a movie geared for children! Is that supposed to be funny? If you think so, then maybe you need the services of a psychiatrist! And when you do cut off a person's hand and wave it around, it relaxes, it does not remain inflexible. I guess whoever wrote the script must think everyone is as dumb as the filmmakers of Hancock!

3111983,4,B0013J55B6,"I was a fan of the famous comic book character Superman. I read the comic books as a kid and was a huge fan of the SUPERMAN movies with Christopher Reeve. When I got older I found myself asking a question. Why didn't Superman ever make love to Lois Lane? I knew he was undeniably in love with her, and that they eventually got married in the comic book series. But with the exception of one time off screen Superman and Lois didn't have sex. (And that was only after he gave up his super powers to be with her.)

Watching Will Smith's superhero movie HANCOCK I finally got an answer to my question. Why didn't Superman and Lois have sex? For one good reason: It would've been too dangerous (for Lois Lane.) Hancock has most of the familiar powers as Superman; he is impervious to bullets, has unbelievable strength, and the ability to fly, rather ungracefully. But he is drunk, dirty, and smelly, and is no longer liked by the people of Los Angeles. Every time he tries to do a good deed, there is catastrophic damage as a result. There is a scene where he takes a hooker home to his special trailer in the hills. And when the two of them start to make love, my question regarding Superman and Lois Lane was answered.

I laughed out loud, not only because of the scene but also because of the answer to my question. And all during HANCOCK there were a lot of big laughs. The movie has plenty of the type of superhero action you could want from this kind of movie, and Will Smith once again demonstrates what a good actor he is. Hancock doesn't care that he is hated by everyone. But there is one word he is often called that he really hates. In an early scene when he saves a man in his car from getting hit by a train, the other drivers blast him for what he has done. He responds by insulting them back until the man he saved comes to his defense, since he would've been dead if that train hit him.

The man Hancock saves is an idealistic Public Relations guy named Ray Embry (Jason Bateman). In an early scene he is trying to promote a symbol that will give a positive image to corporations all over the world. The executives in a meeting room look at him as some kind of crackpot. Ray is fully aware of Hancock and so are his wife Mary (Charlize Theron) and his son Aaron (Jae Head), who is the target of a neighborhood bully. He offers his PR services to Hancock as a payback for saving his life. Hancock reluctantly agrees to his offer, and when he returns to Ray's home he deals with the neighborhood bully in a scene that is both mean and very funny.

Ray shows Hancock several clips on YouTube demonstrating the very bad things he had done in the city. Among them is when he dealt with a whale that washed up on the beach. Another one is when he had to put out a fire. The PR man determines that Hancock is lonely and miserable. When the news reports of a warrant for Hancock's arrest, he comes up with a brainstorm. Hancock should turn himself in and do his time in prison. The crime will go up and the public will miss him. Because of his super powers he could easily escape. Hancock agrees and makes a statement to the press that he would serve out his prison sentence.

Hancock's transfer to the prison is good for a laugh, and so is his first day when he confronts a bunch of inmates he apparently put in jail himself. When one of them refuses to let him pass he demonstrates hilariously why that is a very bad idea.

Eventually Hancock has to step in to save hostages in a bank heist, and things start to turn around as far as how the public begins to see him. It is customary in superhero movies to give a background of the character, and Hancock's background starts out one way and ends up in another. Mary sees something wrong regarding Hancock and it soon leads to the other obligatory part in superhero movies. The character has a weakness. All I can say is that Hancock's weakness is different from what I've seen before and is tied in to Mary.

There are plenty of action sequences, including a fight Hancock gets into which causes a storm in downtown L.A. But it is the laughter that HANCOCK delivers, along with the idea of a superhero who is a dirty and messy guy with a bad attitude. Will Smith does this role the only way he can: completely serious. That is generally the way every other actor in the movie treats their characters.

John Hancock (Will Smith) is not your average super hero. For one thing, he's a drunk. For another, he's got a habit of breaking things, smashing things, and losing his temper. Then there's the time he saved people in a burning building, got his clothes all burned off, then raided an ice cream vendor (more or less naked) in front of a group of children for something to cool himself down.

But one day he saved the life of Ray (Jason Bateman), a PR man with high ideals. In gratitude, Ray decides to help Hancock improve his image. I mean, he's got hundreds of lawsuits against him for the damages he caused in the course of saving lives. Ray persuades him to give himself up on criminal charges surrounding his latest escapade, on the assumption that after the crime rate rises because he is out of circulation, the authorities will pardon him so he can smash bad guys again. Of course, in the prison he meets up with a great many bad guys he put there, and they're not happy with him.

The plot has dozens of twists, several totally unexpected, and a complicated piece of romance around Ray's wife Mary (Charlize Theron) and her previous connection to Hancock. Still, the resolution is a satisfying one, even if it may make some of us cringe a little. Remember, it's fiction. You will need to remember that.

I loved everything about it except the high-adrenalin smashing scenes, but I'm sure the younger people, especially males, will appreciate those as well. They tend to happen too fast for me to understand what's going on.

Good fun and heart-warming at the same time. Can't beat that combination.",1336867200,,1822,4.699059561128527
3111989,4,B0013J55B6,"John Hancock (Will Smith) is a super hero, sort of.  He has all the super powers you would like to have, super strength, the ability to fly, invulnerable and immortal.  Unfortunately he is drunk most of the time and while he does try to stop criminals and save lives he destroys millions of dollars of property by accident every time he tries to help someone.  Since everyone who lives in Los Angeles knows him and how he behaves, he is ridiculed by the press, spectators and government officials as more of a threat than as a hero.

Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) has his life saved by Hancock.  Of course, in typical Hancock fashion, he destroys a train, all of the property surrounding the tracks and almost kills someone else.  Ray is a public relations man and he takes it upon himself to help Hancock improve his public image.  Ray introduces Hancock to his wife and later Hancock finds out that Ray's wife, Mary (Charlize Theron) also has super powers.....

This is a good movie that is funny at times and contains a lot of action and special effects.  It is also confusing at times as Hancock's behavior is vile as he drinks a lot and has a foul mouth.  This might have been a better movie for the family had he played a more typical super hero role. Overall the movie is still good but its storyline wanders between Hancock's deeds, issues and past. It almost loses its way through telling the story.  In the end Hancock finds himself and realizes what an asset he can be to the world if only he would straighten out his life.

3111991,5,B0013J55B6,"After reading some of the other reviews, I had to add in my own two cents. I watch a lot of movies. Been watching them since I was a kid. I love superhero movies, collected every comic from Spiderman, to Superman, and Spawn. But the things this movie has over all of those, is originality, good humor, and a touching story. Marvel fans may be upset that there is no cliche Stan Lee-esque radioactivity accident, or nearly Omnipotent ""last son"" of a dying advanced alien civilization. Somebody didn't accidentally fall into a bunch of strange chemicals and develop super abilities. It's very possible that what made many comic book fans not like it is simply that there is no ""I can be a superhero too factor"" for all those nerds out there fantasizing that they can one day stumble upon a magic ring or secret experiment that will make them gods. So as not to ruin the plot for you, I'll say simply that it's a fairly original idea, and I loved it. It's even traumatic in a way and adds a certain amount of emotion to the film. All the characters were very well written and acted, and I don't understand why anyone - comic book fan or otherwise - would have a problem with it. We need more ideas for superheros, or they're all just the same. To keep this short, I'll say this. Rent it, buy it, stream it from Amazon or netflix, or buy the dvd or bluray. Don't ever take the word of a few individuals online. Some of the best movies I've ever seen were given bad ratings by bloated, under-educated people that just don't want to think during a movie. You know what opinions are like. And everyone has one. Just because a few people didn't like a movie doesn't mean it's bad. It just means that it wasn't for those few people. For that matter, don't take my word for it either. Think for yourself, but definitely give this movie a chance. You'll be glad you did. P.S. The unrated version is way better FYI.",1330560000,3,1903,4.393767705382436
3111992,4,B0013J55B6,"Well, at least at first. As near as we can tell, his superpower is to sustain a blood alcohol content that would induce coma in any three other men, plus a rhinocerous or two. But really, he's got it all, the flying thing (even if flying straight doesn't go so well), super strength, bullets bounce off, and all the usual. He just lacks finesse. You know, like knocking on doors in ways that leave the doors, as well as all the other parts of the buildings, in ruins.

Then along comes Ray, the little ray of sunshine. He's out on some mission of Good In The World, with no especially clear idea of what's in it for him or for anyone else. Hancock saves his sorry bum from an improbable doom, with only a few megabucks of collateral damage. As a result, Ray takes on the sacred duty of becoming Hancock's image consultant. It's an easy job, really. There's nowhere to go but up.

Then it gets weird. Good weird, really good. After years of freedom, Hancock goes to jail. He could punch down the walls any time, but Ray assures him that it's good for his street cred, so he manfully avoids removing most of the doors from their frames. He even brings the ball back inbounds when it went out - over the razor wire. And, though he doesn't know it, Ray carries the kryptonite for this superman close to him. That's when the movie rises, at least a little, above simple spoof.

Hancock is a drunken superman who suffers from amnesia and feels sorry for himself. He knows nothing about his past, except that he has super powers and is immortal. He is heavy-handed and uses brute force without thinking about the results of his actions. He does damage when he helps people, producing in millions of dollars in damages. He feels that he must help others, but is insensitive to them. He is not too bright. He uses profanity. When he descends from flight, for example, he crashes onto the ground and destroys the cement. When he saw a car that was about to be hit by a train, he lifted the car and tossed it away from the track, ignoring that the car would fall on top of another vehicle and almost kill its driver. He does not hurry from the train track. The train crashes into him and is badly damaged. People dislike him.

 The man he saved at the train track is a PR person. He tells Hancock that he will help him change his image. He teaches him how to speak nicely to people. He encourages him to allow himself to be jailed for the damages he produced. He takes him to his home where Hancock discovers that the man's wife is also a super being.

 Viewers will enjoy finding out who Hancock is. Why does he have this name? What is his relationship with the PR guy's wife? How many generations has this relationship lasted?

Hancock is easily one of the worst comic book/superhero movies I've ever seen. I would place it on par with duds like Batman and Robin and Daredevil. The only difference is, at least with the other two there was at least a semblance of a plot to follow. The biggest problem with Hancock is that there is no adversary. None, unless you consider himself his own worst enemy. He is fighting alcoholism and recklessness and ummm boredom. The other problem is lack of plot. There's alot of awkward flying and some random fighting, more drinking, a tornado........oh yea, and a poorly devised ending bordering on ridiculous.

Will Smith has basically one facial expression in the whole movie- a cross between constipated and bored. I can't tell if he was acting or he really didn't give a crap about anything that had to do with the film. Also, who didn't see Charlize Theron's character coming from a mile away?? Eye-rolling rubbish.

I can't believe this movie is rated as high as it is when there is literally nothing going for it. But please, if you love boring acting, zero plot and not so great special effects, by all means, buy this film!",1295481600,3,1160,4.704433497536946
3112011,2,B0013J55B6,"I believe it's a universal fact that Will Smith owns the July 4th weekend. And with Hancock, Smith continues his domination at the box office.

Smith plays Hancock, a drunk with superpowers: he can fly, he has super strength and is indestructible. Every time he ""saves"" someone, he ends up costing more in damages. He crushes highway signs, destroys trains, throws whales onto sailboats and tears up the roads.

When he saves PR man Ray Embrey, (Jason Bateman) he gains an ally and friend. Embrey wants to turn his image around from the horrible super freak to the superhero the city needs. However, Ray's wife, Mary (Charlize Theron) is not happy that her husband has teamed up with the no-good disaster.

There are some funny moments in this summer blockbuster. Everything you laughed at in the trailer is in this film. And there are a few funny, Will Smith, moments. There is no doubt that he is a terrific actor.

The problem with this movie comes in a sudden twist that many critics have said comes out of nowhere, and they're pretty much correct. Nobody saw this one coming. And it takes a while for everyone to get back into the mood of the film.

The biggest disappointment was the language. Do you remember Get Shorty? Remember all the swearing in the first five minutes of that movie alone? The writers of Hancock seemed to want to write the dialogue along those lines. And it really turned me off of the plot. They try to use a swear word as a running joke. Stick around for the credits and there is it again. They just can't let it go.

There are components of this movie that are not appropriate for young children and parents should use their discretion. With that aside, this is one of the funniest movies that I have seen in a long time. I highly recommend it because it takes a humorous approach to the Superman mythology. Here Hancock (a being with superpowers) is out of control and an alcoholic. In classic slapstick fashion Hancock creates carnage where ever he goes. Ultimately an advertising man takes him under his wing and tries to clean up his image. It is that this juncture that the hope for redemption is activated within the plot line. However there are complications because it would seem that Hancock is not the only one with super powers. It turns out that the wife of his new friend (the advertising man) also has super powers, but is attempting to remain anonymous in her upper middle class life. the complexity compounds when it turns out that the gal with superpowers was previously Hancock's significant other in a previous life (these beings are immortal). From there the conflict becomes increasingly hostile until the resolution is found that leads to the conclusion of the movie (I don't want to spoil it, so I'll defer on more details).

the bottom line here is that it is a refreshing take on the Superman mythology that is squeaky clean. Here the central character may have superpowers, but also becomes much more human as a result of his addiction to alcohol in conjunction angst stemming from repressed memories of his former life with his friend and mentor's wife.

Storywise, Hancock is yet another in the long series of now utterly boring tales of what it would be like if superpowered beings really did walk the earth; this concept started back in the 1980's with The Watchmen, Dark Knight, Concrete, Marshall Law and Miracle Man comics, the trend continued for a long time in comics and was followed up by such movies as the awful ""Unbreakable"", and the merely decent ""The Incredibles"".  Filmmakingwise, this is simply an excuse for terrific computerized special effects, and a high concept easy for marketing, no more. For a while, I thought that ""Hancock"" might be at least a modern day, jazzed up version of ""The Bishop's Wife"", with it's wonderful love triangle dynamics between a man of the cloth (David Niven), and an Angel on Earth (Cary Grant), vying subtly, and not-so-subtly for the affections of Loretta Young.  Not so.  Once the set up of a diseffected, alcoholic loner, with a good heart, bad manners...and superpowers is established, the writers simply ran out of steam.  Potentially somewhat intersting plotlines including Hancock spending time in jail (for unanswered lawsuits and damages), or the manipulation of public relations in the age of super mass media (which was handled quite well in the Jack Lemmon/Judy Holliday movie ""It Should Happen To You"" 1954) are given short shrift.  Very much like ""Unbreakable"", there's no real payoff, and the backstory never developed in a proper manner, almost as if the creators couldn't be bothered with details. Oh, there's also a moronic bloodbath as a climax, and a truly silly, sappy, green Hollywood capper.  The superhero effects make the once sterling effects from the 1978 ""Superman"" look truly prehistoric, but the charm, wit, excitement, and sense of wonder of that first major, big budget superhero blockbuster are utterly absent here. Even the unnecessary and useless ""Underdog"" live action movie might have been better than this.

A PR man, whose life he saves, takes Hancock under his wing to help him become a responsible hero, but there are more surprises on the way.

This is a thoughtful and very unique superhero film, and also in most respects very cool. It goes in directions you'll never expect, but not at the expense of leaving glaring plot holes. Will Smith gives his normal top notch performance, and the supporting cast is great.

This movie has a tremendous amount of humor-- how many other superheroes do you know of that gets sued and arrested for all the damage that gets caused by crime fighting? And Hancock does do a lot of damage; sometimes it seems, just for the hell of it.

But the biggest difference-- the one that a lot of people who are fond of mindless superhero origins-- is that Hancock's background is both unique and touching, so we not only have a superhero but also something of a tragic hero. In this movie, the hero doesn't get the girl, but in this case, that's a good thing. Hancock is the superhero, but his pal Ray is subtly heroic in his own way and that adds a bit of pathos not usually found in movies of this type, yet it all works out in the end.

This is a darn good movie, though badly underrated by people stuck in the Marvel mold who can't think outside the box. If you want a superhero movie that goes beyond the usual tripe, you really should see this one. Trust me, you'll love it. :-)

3112025,3,B0013J55B6,"I'm going to go ahead and get the `SPOILER ALERT' thing out of the way now.

Watching `Hancock', I had an epiphany.  Will Smith is really a superb actor, it's just sad that he never quite gets his projects 100% right.  I mean, he picks some nice work, some interesting and unusual and memorable work, but when the film breaks down it winds up missing the mark in some way, shape or form.

`Hancock' is no different.

`Hancock' gave Will Smith the perfect platform for the type of acting that he does best.  It had layers of comedy, drama, suspense and it allowed him to work his charming charisma, albeit in a way that is unlike most of what he does.  It is not Will Smith that failed this film; it is the film itself that ultimately failed Will Smith.

`Hancock' tells the story of a disillusioned superhero named John Hancock.  He is a drunk and a creep and is despised by everyone, yet they need him in a way since he is, well, a superhero.  When Hancock saves the life of a PR agent named Ray, Ray decides to repay Hancock by reinventing his image.  He instructs Hancock on how to behave, how to react and even how to `save the day'.  Conceptually, this all works beautifully.  The second half of the film kind of takes a nosedive for me.  Remember, I said SPOILERS.  Having the attraction between Mary, Ray's wife, and Hancock was a clich&eacute; for me.  They try to back out of it by making Mary, Hancock's soul mate (his wife) and making her a superhero (god, angel) too, and while this kind of works it also comes across rather cheesy.  The final scene, in the hospital, is an equal mix of brilliant and ridiculous.

But I'm getting ahead of myself here.  Let's rewrite things now.

I would have started by handing the film an R rating.  PG-13 somewhat inhibits the dialog, especially when you consider the type of character that Hancock is supposed to be.  When he's spouting profanities and being offensive is when he is the most entertaining.  Smith handles this side of his character flawlessly (that whole scene with the train and the disgruntled citizens was hilarious).  Next, I would have deepened my approach a tad.  Think `Unbreakable' meets `Roger Dodger'.  While not perfect, `Unbreakable' really nailed the tension of someone coming to terms with their destiny, and `Roger Dodger' understood brilliantly how to craft a character as self-absorbed yet misunderstood as Hancock was here.  `Roger Dodger' also understood that sometimes a mystery is far better than the answers.  That said, I would have completely gutted the ending.  Making Mary another `god' was kind of all sorts of wrong.  In fact, I would have gutted her character and made Ray a single father (the storyline involving his first wife was good enough).  The whole `battle of the gods' scene with the storm and all that was a mess anyway.  Sometimes `flying' in these superhero movies can be so cheesy looking.  When it comes to the final scene, I would have made just a few tweaks.  I idea of having the gods lose their powers when getting close to one another was a nice touch, although gutting Mary out of the film I would have had it that Hancock loses his powers when he starts to connect with humankind, thus forming an attachment to Ray and his son.  Not a romantic, but an emotional attachment.  He cares about them, thus he becomes mortal.  Instead of giving him ridiculous bouts of strength during the final scene (here he is, mortal and weak with love, and yet he gets strong, gets weak, gets strong, gets weak) I would have had him completely surrender to his mortality and die happy, knowing that he is human.  I think that that may have been a great selling point for the films moral center.  Throughout the film it is apparent that Hancock wants to fit in and that he considers his gift a curse.

That said; the whole eerie atmosphere of the wet hospital death scene was near brilliance, including Ray's heroic moment of brutality.

Quite a change, I know, but this was all I could think while watching this film.  This should have been so much better.  In the end, it was entertaining and had moments of greatness, but the fact that it winds up squandering its potential is rather disheartening to me.  This could have been a glorious awards magnet for Smith.  We all know he is in dire need of an Oscar, but not for the material they keep nominating him for.  Smith is, at heart, a comedic actor.  He needs a project that challenges him in that field.  By darkening some of the tones in `Hancock' and giving it a little more seriousness, this could have been the perfect balance of comedy and drama to get Smith that golden bad-boy, or at least another nomination.",1273104000,,4668,4.580917874396135

From this point, Bateman sets about helping Hancock change his ways and embrace the ""champion"" within and win back the people's trust. Charlize Theron plays Bateman's wife, who may have a connection to our hero's past.

3112034,1,B0013J55B6,"Let me get this straight. The basic premise of this movie is that what people think of you is the most important thing? Is that over-simplfying the matter?

 The bitter, troubled-yet-supremely-gifted outsider can be redeemed if he will only stoop to wear the mantle of socially acceptable behavoir, complete with all the fawning niceties ahssholes lube each other up with, and the worn uniform of conformity that comforts the tiny, fearful beast that resides within the cold, timid, frail, little confines of self-centered, placated hearts when forced by extreme circumstance to confront the realities of life and death. ""Johnny-Hero here to save your life folks, and look!, he does it all with a firm handshake and a winning smile, isn't that nice? What a fine, decent human being. Doesn't he make us feel good about ourselves, like we are worth saving, or whatever? Our weak, triflin', common-place, conform-at-all-cost selves.""

 Then you got Johnny-Lifesaver with his little cheerio's heart trying to ""save the world"" with pills. I mean, gimme a feckin' break already. Wake the F up. Pills is what's doin' it, people! Get off the f-n pills if you wanna do something about ""saving the world"". You think your population is sickly obese and diseased because it doesn't have enough pills? Maybe Johnny-Lifesaver should've been trying to save the world with corn syrup instead. Yeah, corn syrup and pills to save the world. And just remember that people who smoke pot are losers who don't take life seriously enough and don't knuckle down to get ahead. Yeah, and faahk you too. Don't let the door smash your head up the next guy's ahss on the way out, herc, herc! I mean, that Hancock was great wasn't it? Hoy, hoy, all them digital effects and dog and pony tricks that the masses have always, and always will fall for. I especially enjoyed the one where they made the Fresh Prince all badahss and street. Made him drink liquor wid his meatballs and top dog of cellblock C, an' all dat. What will that guy be told when he stands in judgement before the Almighty? ""Swell work my boy, you molded many a poor heart and even were a bit humorous along the way. Well done, good and faithful servant, you may have your reward.""?

 I gotta admit though, Happyness disturbed me more than Hancock in the end. They should title his next big screen appearance, Hurumph. Or maybe Hurumph, Hurumph, like it was so nice they named it twice, or some shet. Not bad, not bad, but I doubt if Mr. Smith goes out clubbin' without a full entourage, know what I'm sayin'? Or maybe the club comes to him. And then again, maybe he don't do no feckin' clubbin' at all and that's all a big act too, who's to say? Who cares? I wish him nothing but success and happyness the rest of his days, but if his brain does evolve, or is allowed to evolve in old age, as has been known to happen with his kind, the ""not-as-dumb-as-he-looks"" crowd, or even just someday when he gets enough money, he may always feel a little pang in the far corner of his heart when looking back over his lengthy and successful repertoire; when he looks back over the roles society and, especially, the masters of society chose for him and allowed him to play.

 Not I to judge, just trying to describe to myself how I see it. A lotta fun, lotta fun.

 One last, little thing I couldn't help but mention; Why is it that in all these masturbatory super-heor fantasy flicks, fighting crime always means the big, surly, tatted guy with the uzi, and never pimple-faced geeks and ""Johnny Three-pieces"" at corporate headquarters? (Robocop, specifically the original, was the one brilliant exception that comes to mind.) I mean, who are we trying to kid here? To clean out the squids and clams at the bottom you gotta first get rid of all the big, blood-thirsty sharks at the top, am I right? Let's not kid ourselves about that at least.

 Do you realize how much enjoyment and happyness the ""average"" viewer would derive from such scenes? Perhaps you've never had the pleasure of scanning the crowd at a professional wrestling extravaganza. It's not hard to thrill these beasts-- give 'em the thing with big, hairy, rubber tihts on. Grind their faces right into the heart of the filth, if that's what they want. Let 'em have it in spades. Give 'em a few scenes where Bubba has himself a bit of cake and sodomy at the expense of a banker or politician, or better yet, a banker-politician. I mean, would it kill you to humor us with a little self-debasement from time to time? The wretches on the bottom have been having to indulge in it for many a year thanks to all the ""Cops"" shows and ""prime time"" horror the tube continuously spews on them. A little change of pace, carnage against corrupt politicians, corporate executives, lawyers, judges, priests, preachers, doctors, professors, police officers, federal agents, armed forces and the like, for example, would be almost cleansing and therepuetic to the ""everyman"" citizen on the bottom rung whose everyday life is a shet existance under their iron heels and fat, grindy thumbs. Even I would cheer Will Smith in a film of such character and magnitude. Doubt if it would get financed however, just a sneaking suspicion. Maybe Uwe Boll will take the subject on someday. But then you killjoys would suppress distribution on it like you did with Postal, which is certainly the funniest if not the most truthful social commentary/comedy made in the past thirty years. It even surpasses Idiocracy, or at least ties it, if such a thing is possible.

My problem with HANCOCK was that although it was largely marketed as a semi-family summer blockbuster popcorn flick, the language and sexual content proved totally incompatible with such a film.  HANCOCK boasts two uses of the F-word, 18 uses of the word ""[...]"" (the majority of these spoken by young kids), and explicit sexual content such as when Hancock explains how dangerous his [...] can be.

Many may think I'm overreacting, but I can't help compare this to another super-hero film from last year: THE DARK KNIGHT.

3112054,4,B0013J55B6,"Now here's a real twist on the super-hero theme. Hancock (Will Smith) drinks and wrecks havoc when ever he does his ""super hero thing.""

He drinks, it turns out, largely because he cannot remember who he is, and needs an anchor to repair himself.

He gets that anchor only after he stops a speeding train barreling down the tracks into a traffic jam. Without him, the train would have killed failed PR man Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman). Naturally Ray appreciates Hancock, even if all the owners of other wrecked cars, and the engineer of the over-turned train do not.

Jason sets about repairing Hancock's reputation by suggesting he do some time, taking responsibility for the massive damage caused by his previous heroics. While he is an inmate, Hancock is suddenly missed. Crime begins to spike. He's needed.

Meanwhile, although Jason's son Aaron (Jae Head) takes a keen liking to Hancock, his wife, Mary (Charlize Theron) deeply suspects him. She seems to know something about Hancock is not right.

Don't see this movie if you want the usual Superman or Batman fare. Hancock is not that---although there is plenty of action.

This film has originality, characterizations and a plot that ropes viewers in, no matter how unbelievable. But it's also a nice family flick with a healthy subtext: Identity, family, love, personal attachments and self-respect are all-important.",1242518400,,1374,5.057522123893805

3112056,4,B0013J55B6,"Hancock is an interesting film with a cool premise: what if superheroes were people with problems?  Well that's a theme that's been explored before with movies like Mystery Men and even Spider Man.  The key difference is that Hancock does his job with a huge amount of collateral damage around him that becomes his signature style (providing great fun for the audience).  And unlike other hero flicks, director Peter Berg serves up Hancock with a great dose of realism and empathy.  He doesn't have the legacy or luggage of Spider Man or the Watchmen and he isn't hokey either.

Two thirds of the film is visually impressive and brilliant - and the cast has great chemistry.  Will Smith is always enjoyable, and Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron are great in the film.  Past the midway point though, the film takes off on a slightly different tangent as we explore Hancock's origins.  I'm of two minds here and feel that the film could've stayed on track in a better way somehow.  Some reviewers say that the end of the movie tends to feel rushed and I agree.  It's a film that could easily have added 15 minutes and a lot more development to the story.  I was enjoying it so what was the rush anyway?

Without adding too much of a spoiler, the show ends in Highlander territory (hint hint) and loses some of the verve which gets it there in the first place.  So slightly mixed results for Hancock at the end, but overall, there are some nice nuances here that make this a lot less stereotypical superhero flicks, and yes, better than the Watchmen.  This would actually be a great TV series.",1241308800,,1591,4.575971731448763

The famous Will Smith becomes a superhero sounds interesting but how many superheros have you heard of as being a fall down drunk? I couldn't see past all the uneccessary profanity this movie had to offer what ever happened to the Will Smith who claimed he didn't curse because he thought it would break his grandmother's heart? the idea itself was ok until there was a female that he was paired up with from a distant planet or something the movie really trailed off from any kind of point after the first half hour. I was wrong however when I told people that I thought this movie would be a stump in Smith's acting career but I guess he's too big of an actor for people to stop enjoying his movie's even when they are low rate quality needless to say this movie will make me second guess the next one Will Smith stars in.,1241222400,,1012,4.35978835978836

3112061,3,B0013J55B6,"Will Smith's jaded superhero vehicle Hancock starts out well enough - albeit with a premise not a million miles away from Pixar's The Incredibles, but the screenplay leaks coherence as it goes on, and by its conclusion has virtually none left.

There was just too much in the plot arc for it to have much hope of hanging together: the plot twists significantly and starts off in quite different directions on more than one occasion, and in its final act where you might expect some resolution, the (poorly drawn) villain characters and their motivations were too flimsily expounded, and the uncomfortable relationship between the three leading characters - a superhero love triangle, of sorts - was not satisfactorily resolved but instead just found an improbable equilibrium.

There are some great comedy moments - as you would expect, Will Smith has some great lines and he delivers them with his characteristic panache - and Jason Bateman is - well, Jason Bateman - a likeable everyman who injects warmth into the screenplay. But as it goes on Hancock veers uneasily between comedy and edgy thriller, finally (and to my mind unwisely) settling for the latter - there are some harrowing moments right at the end - when the film's loopy superhero premise denied just the kind of credibility needed to carry that off, and had more than enough acting and comedy talent to ensure the former would be a banker.

Like many films of this type there is some over-use of the (undeniably impressive) CGI, and the film, though starting off promisingly enough, winds up being no more than a watchable, if confusing film.

And Hancock is your straight-off-the-drawing-board, multiple 750ml drunk...nice! Then they work it out to be a sympathetic attribute later. Beautiful!

Bill Cosby would roll over in his easy chair!

On the plus side, ""Hancock"" does put forth some original material, from actually killing the bad guys [unless they bounce off matresses in the Uncut version] to Hancock's ""Kryptonite"" so to speak. The special effects get really nice once they're through with their goofy ""flying drunken superhero"" bit.

The story and performances are commendable when watched through to the end. If you're not sick of being reminded of the toilet that some actual cities have become, then you may enjoy this movie...I did, in a way. I just prefer fantasy villains over jailbirds when featuring a fantasy hero - I want to be entertained and excited somewhere new, not bored and depressed in familiar territory.

3112071,2,B0013J55B6,"Hancock is not the typical superhero film that's for sure but where it has it's greatest fault is that it ignores its own potential. Most films featuring superheros focus on the conflict between doing a solo job and trying to be an average person. Hancock does this which of course makes it an average film.  Where the movie falls apart is that it misses the chance to focus on the public's fickle approach with celebrity and how we tend to build up a celebrity only to tear them down when they first fall.

That concept seems to simmer just under the surface with Hancock but is never explored or engaged as anything other than a hit or miss idea. Jason Bateman was great as the PR hack trying to get Hancock to reform and change his behavior and turn him into something almost marketable. Sadly the film does not go down this interesting path and chooses to instead be a run of the mill superhero film with lots of car crashes, explosions and so on. I enjoyed Hancock but believe it to be a great deal of wasted potential.",1237593600,2,1024,4.412698412698413

Where he can normally make an ordinary movie into a good movie and so on, here he makes no difference, and I don't think the problem is down to Will Smith. The script woefully lets his talents down. He doesn't have much to say, and when he does his delivery his flat and uninteresting.

The CGI is impressive but good CGI alone cannot make a good movie. I'd recommend caution before buying this as it may not be what you are expecting.",1236038400,,616,4.356521739130435
3112078,3,B0013J55B6,"I honestly don't understand the glowing reviews of this movie - it wasn't all it could have been and I was left feeling very disappointed.  It started out great - Hancock was the perfect non-heroic superhero.  I loved the action and the storyline up until the part where Charlize Theron's character suddenly decides she's going to rip Will Smith's face off and they start dueling.  At that moment the movie got really stupid really fast, and just kept on going.  Why, for instance, would Charlize Theron's character suddenly decide to beat the ever-living hell out of Will Smith, in the open, in front of many, many witnesses, destroying everything in her path and presumably killing loads of innocent bystanders - to keep the secret of their powers?  Huh?  She could just as easily have shown Will Smith she, too, had powers and taken him off privately somewhere to either duel it out or talk it over.  It just got stupid.... stupid plot twist, stupid ending.  Really ruined it for me.

And the explanation (so-called explanation) of where they came from, how they got their powers, why they were fighting, the bad guys, etc. etc. - how does NOT explaining anything actually explain things?  I can understand a wink and a nod, when appropriate, but the old wink and nod here is just dumb.  It's a dumb, stupid, illogical waste of time.  Here's where the movie was completely broken when it could have been fixed, when it could have become something really great.  The beginning of the movie and both characters certainly deserved better than what they were given in the end.  The movie goer deserved a better explanation of things.  I'm all for psychological closure, but you actually need certain elements which this movie lacked in order to create that type of closure.

To me, it seemed that two writers were at work here:  a really good writer started the movie and got up to that one particular scene. Then that writer died or got fired or suddenly lost the ability to communicate, and a secondary and inferior writer stepped in and, without reading the first half of the script, wrote a completely different movie.  Then they got squooshed together and someone signed on Will Smith.  Tada...

I really wanted to like this movie.  The action sequences are fantastic, the effects are great, and I love both Will Smith and Charlize Theron.  But the movie with so much potential just never really seems to pay off.",1235433600,2,2417,4.759615384615385

I love Will Smith, but I think he could have pulled himself, out of his slump. So of course in steps Mr White Guy and makes everything ok.
Another thing I didn't understand was how Mr White Guy and his (already married) lady lived in White suburb on the money he wasn't making.
Oh, and how concerned Mrs (Hancock)white lady was about the world and the troubles of the world, but she didn't do anything to help anyone until Hancock showed up.

Hancock understands he is different and does not go out of his way to change, until he saves a PR rep who takes Hancock on as a client to revamp his image.

Half way through I was getting bummed out that Hancock never explores how he came to be.  Just as I was getting to the point of being bored there was a major plot twist and lets just say we get the a very detailed back story.

While he finishes off the bad guys and keeps the crime rate down, Hancock also creates a lot of unintended consequences, from destruction of property to lawsuits and subpoenas galore.

You have right there the makings of a nice, 3-star comedy-drama, especially when a PR guy is saved and decides to make cleaning up Hancock's act his raison d'etre.  He even convinces the errant flying good guy to do some hard time to make a point!

Alas that someone in the production chain, scriptwriter, director, who knows, decided to toss in an unfortunate back-story.  Hancock, the only superhero, finds out there is one other (Charlize Theron), that he's an amnesiac, and a whole lot of Highlander-type semi-mystic bologna about an immortal race doomed to pair and die.  This part is not only silly, it's muddled and without clear rules.

There is even depth to the title character, as he learns that for the non-superpowered, courage can be found in trying to change.  He transforms from a totally self-involved character to one who comes to respect others.

And then it all starts to go wrong.  The major plot twist, and the hidden history of Hancock becomes a jumbled mess.  The writer decide that the great premise they set up is insufficient, and they try to fuse an entirely different story into the plot.

Not since Highlander 2 reframed the characters from the first film as extraterrestrials have I seen such an unnecessary and total overhaul of a  fantastic premise.

When Hancock was in prison and jumped out to get a basketball. He thought for a while, but jumped back in because he was trying to be responsible. I liked that part. However, the villians were weak.

Sure this is a super-hero/comic book movie, so you have to allow for some extra degree of freedom - but it is really overdone.

The movie starts off with Hancock as a disgruntled, drunk, incompetent superhero.  L.A. is fed up with him destroying buildings and freeways while apprehending car thieves.

He rescues a PR guy (Jason Bateman - who is really good in this movie) and the PR guy decides to revamp Hancock's image.

From here the movie improves drastically and even has some interesting twists and storylines that could have made a great movie.  But it didn't.  It ended up being an ok movie that made lots of money because they were smart enough to cast Will Smith in the lead role.

Overall I'd give this a watchable rating, but it could have been so much better.",1232668800,,1037,4.532258064516129
3112102,4,B0013J55B6,"""Hancock"" is an oddity, both the title character and the film as a whole.  Instead of a typical superhero story that includes an origin story, a sinister villain and a love interest, we are given a tale of a lonely man looking for his place in this world (as well as an origin story, sinister villain and love interest).

Will Smith portrays the title hero (anti-hero) who drinks, swears and does more damage to the city than the criminals he's after.  He simply doesn't want to be a hero.  When called upon, he takes his time getting to the scene, usually botches his landing and aggravates more than he impresses.  He's also terribly lonely, and wonders if there is anyone else like him.

When he saves a kind-hearted publicist, Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), he accepts the man's offer of ""image"" help.  Soon enough, Hancock finds himself in favor with the masses, but does he truly find what he longs for:  an equal?

All of the key elements of a superhero tale are present, just not in the order (or method of delivery) that you'd expect.  We do eventually learn Hancock's past, but from an unlikely source.  There's also a love interest, albeit a very unique one.  And, of course, we do get a very sinister villain, but even this villain finds justice at the hands of an unlikely source.

Overall, this film is one part comedy, one part action and two parts drama.  The language in this unrated version is very strong, even an ""F"" bomb gets dropped.  The action is fast but suffers from poor CGI once in awhile.  All of the cast, from Smith to Bateman to Charlize Theron, give solid performances.  Peter Berg's direction can be erratic at times and does have a somewhat gimmicky feel to it, but it is sufficient.

The unrated single-disc DVD has a few special features, and all of them are worth a look.  I especially enjoyed the ""Building a Better Hero"" and ""Bumps and Bruises"" featurettes.  ""Mere Mortals"" is okay, but Peter Berg does grate the nerves a bit.

In summary, I give three and two-thirds stars (I round up) to ""Hancock.""  The story is very good but would have been even better with more solid direction and a stronger script overall.  Keep the young'uns away if strong language bothers you.  Also, there's a bit of a love triangle that some parents might feel is too hard to explain to younger children.

But when he gets back on his feet, he is prepared to fight crime and save everyone's lives.

Interesting and funny superhero comedy fantasy from director Peter Berg is one of the most original and interesting superhero movies in a long time. Sure some parts are slow and there's some holes in the plot, but this is a solid movie with good performances especially the lovely Charlize Theron as the superheroine that becomes Hancock's friend, there is some nice visual effects and action sequences. It's sort of a tribute to Richard Donner's Superman movies but only with a comical modern twist, recommended.

""Men in Black"" as a superhero movie, essentially.  The first few minutes of the film start in that vein.  However, the movie quickly loses focus, and shifts its tone repeatedly for the remainder of its running time.  ""Hancock"" doesn't know if it's an action movie, a comedy or a drama, and as a result ends up lapsing into melodrama.

Will Smith, Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron do a great job with material that is mediocre at best.  Indeed, Jason Bateman steals this movie from Will Smith.  Absent any direction from the script, he simply plays the same character he did on ""Arrested Development"", and does so with such verve that he walks away with this movie.

Even at a short 1:30, this film drags due to its underdeveloped script.  Like so many high concept movies, it needed a lot of work in the script department.  If nothing else is available to rent, this may be passable.  But, it's unlikely to be anything but a forgettable time-killer to most viewers.",1232323200,,1099,4.701570680628272

3112110,4,B0013J55B6,"Hancock is an entertaining, fun and very watchable movie with great lead actors.  It is an all around good movie although does suffer from some flaws.  John Hancock (Will Smith) is a superhero... of sorts. He's invulnerable, super strong and can fly really fast and as is revealed later on doesn't age either having memories back 80 years but nothing before that.  Unfortunately he has some personality defects.

He is frequently angry, has no friends, while he stops criminals he usually causes more damage than a tornado or an earthquake in the process and is almost constantly drinking. Although personally I'm unclear if the alcohol actually affects him or if it is just an excuse so he can act how he wants.  You see he's the only one of his kind and has trouble being accepted so goes for being a butt-hole instead so he doesn't have to deal with it.  Ironically, he hates being called a certain more potent synonym to butt-hole (with disastrous results for anyone who does) even though that's how he acts.

Then he meets Ray (Jason Bateman in a pitch perfect role for him) who is in PR and grateful for Hancock saving his life (although needlessly derailing a train in the process) and makes him an offer to help clean up his image.  Some time in jail, on very legitimate charges against him, while going to rehab and as the crime rate rises the city will soon be calling for a new and improved Hancock.  And a triumphant return he does have.

This is all the first half of the movie and all excellent.

BEWARE POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD

It turns out though that Ray's wife Mary (Charlize Theron), who's been giving Hancock odd looks and being oddly hostile toward him, has a secret of her own.  In a moment of mutual attraction Mary and Hancock kiss and then she knocks his butt through a wall and tells him that if Ray finds out that she'll kill Hancock.  And stop right there!

If she didn't want it known what she was then shouldn't she have chosen a less violent method of stopping the kiss?  Like maybe just saying, ""I'm sorry, we can't do this.""

Then they meet to talk under the understanding that she'll tell Hancock the truth if he leaves town.  Knowing they have some sort of bond he asks who they were to each other.  Why, brother and sister, she says.  And stop right there!

Brother and sister?  Granted it could happen but a nice black gentleman the biological brother of a very white blonde.  That's weak.  But that's not what Hancock bases his counter argument on.  He says that a brother and sister don't kiss each other like they did.  Huh?

Then a mystery storm kicks up and they fight.  It is kind of implied that the storm has something to do with their powers clashing and dissipating from being together but is never really explained so it's kind of confusing.  The fight takes the pair right through an office where Ray is giving a presentation so he knows Mary's secret now too.

Mary also has terrible mood swings as she act psycho during the fight and turns very loving later on.  Maybe that's what a 3000 year old relationship is like.  This quarter of the movie is its weakest link.  I was able to deal with the fact that they lose their powers through prolonged exposure to each other... I have seen folks who where confused by this but it was stated that it was a gradual process and not Kryptonite immediate.

All of this is saved by a very poignant ending that was sad and jubilant at the same time.  Almost dead, and Mary pretty much all the way dead, Hancock leaps from a window running and flying away from Mary so they will both gain their powers back and live but also leaving behind the only chance in the world for a normal connection he might have had.  Sorry if that's too much detail but it really is great and the first half and this last quarter of the movie more than make up for the mediocre third quarter.

The movie is fun, often funny, has heart, some great special effects and terrific acting... Just that darn third quarter.  I have to recommend the movie despite it.",1232064000,,4025,4.478021978021978

I will say Will Smith sounds very unnatural swearing a lot. Every now and then when he is being sarcastic its funny. But he's not a very good jerk. The climax towards the end is good when he is actually showing sorrowful emotion, but other than that his emotions just seem forced.

Cheap Tuesday, and it was busy with hundreds of baby boomers lining up to see 'Mama Mia!' and I ended up in the wrong line, feeling like a complete idiot when I realised that there was no one within cooee of my age in the queue. It was a relief, however, to find that we could walk right into the appropriate cinema and not have to jockey for decent seats.

'Hancock' is a good piece of cinema, but very light. It's one of those films with a great premise that kind of falls down when the story should be getting interesting. You could see that spot at the end of the exposition and the conflict where the writers--Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan--suddenly realised that they don't know where they're going with this story. It's good, but the best bits are in the trailer. Wait for the DVD.

I'd like to give them ten points for trying, but this is one of those unfortunate films that has fallen victim to the Hollywood movie machine. The idea was fresh and new, which is more than you can say for most American films this century, but the execution just didn't cut it.

I just wish we had opted for 'Ten Empty' instead. Oh well.",1231804800,2,1211,4.373333333333333

3112117,5,B0013J55B6,"Will Smith.  He is an amazing actor that can perform in a wide range of roles and pull them off well, from the action hero, such as Independence Day or I Am Legend, to the drama such as Ali.  I will say right off the bat that I am a fan of his and will often like a movie that may be less than perfect because of his presence,

I am not familiar with the graphic novel that thee movie was based on, so I really cannot place the movie in context of how well it compares (or portrays) the graphic novel and fans of the original work probably find issues or not.  But when I first heard of the movie and the general concept of an anti-Hero hero I thought it was a good one.

In Hancock Smith plays the anti-hero, a down of his luck, heavy drinking, misanthrope that is established immediately in his interaction with a child who is trying to let him know that his superhero abilities are needed.  Hancock reluctantly goes to help out and it is hilarious when he catches up with the criminals and describes what will happen as he is nursing a hangover.  (There was some CGI I did not like at the beginning, but it got better later on.  Very strange considering how good the rest is pretty much done.)  And during this hero intervention his attitude leads to destruction of property which seems to be his habit.

He is not very popular due to his destroying things more than the bad guys and has become a bit of a pariah but his luck changes when he saves a PR person (Jason Bateman) who is very grateful and offers to help Hancock reinvent himself, much like many celebs seem to due when they have a faux pas it seems.  There are indications that Hancock really does care and has potential as he meets Bateman's son and discusses bullying.

The movie goes on from there with many good scenes - Hancock trying to be polite in a forced an uncomfortable manner and he eventually does reclaim himself and the tone of the movie shifts a bit, much like Shaun of The Dead, from comedy to more serious (thoughtful?) in the context of an action movie as Hancock finds out more about himself and his limitations.  One of the key points in this is telegraphed earlier when he meets a character (Charlize Theron, the wife of Bateman in the movie.)

There are a couple of glitches/questionable writing bits in the script along the way.  And some of what was going to happen was a bit foreseeable, such as the scenes in prison.  and a couple of CGIs I did not like much, but not enough to harm the movie because when I think about the movie I recall laughing and enjoying it more than the one or two small points.  For people who are familiar with the novel and want the novel, I cannot tell you how you will like this or not.  For movie goers who like action movies, even with the glitches, a 4 to 5 star, and for someone who likes action movies, likes Will Smith and just wants to have a good time, 5 stars and have fun which is why I give it 5 even with the couple of plot points that were weak.",1231804800,,2980,4.234982332155477

A dash to Starbucks for some heated comfort, and then home to snuggle on the couch and the next playful disagreement over which movie to watch first and settling as always on the third choice we made together.

This time around the movie was Hancock.  I'll be honest in that my preliminary expectation was to enjoy some snuggle time while he enjoyed the movie, but I was wrong in that assumption.

Hancock was wonderful.  Will Smith was amazing, and the chemistry between Charlize Theron and himself was smoking!

The movie takes a super hero and turns him upside down by asking the hard question: What if you were the only one of a kind in a world filled with others like but miles apart from who you are? The movie is billed as a comedy but I found myself with tears in my eyes during many moments as Will Smith's character struggled with loss, loneliness, and a desire to be part of something. It's a love story, a crime story, a mystery, filled with angst and starring Will Smith, and Theron.  What's not to like?

I've read the reviews, and they only go to prove one of my personal adages if a critic thinks the movie stinks, I'm gonna love it and I did.  Nuff said.

The unrated version says it has footage that was not shown in the theater, and ran about 1 1/2 hours.  The other disk is the special features disk (explained below).

Will Smith (Hancock) was the normal mix of outstanding actor and funny man that he always is. Charlize Theron (Mary Embrey) and Jason Bateman-""Juno"" (Ray Embrey) do a great job completing the main characters.

The movie begins with bad guys on the run, a police car chase, and shooting.  Through it all, our superhero (Hancock) is passed out drunk on a city bench.  All of a sudden, he popps off the bench and is airborn, booze bottle in hand.  He goes after the bad guys, drops into their car from the sky, and in Will Smith humor, tells them to stop shooting (the noise hurts his head because he has a hangover.) But, bad guys being what they are (bad), they shoot holes in his sunglasses (while he's wearing them).  Then they did the unthinkable--they shot up the bottle of booze.  So Hancock looses his cool and tears their little behinds up!  Of course, the action and humor continues throughout the movie.

Hancock is not your norman superhero.  He is rude, mouthy, sarcastic drunk.  He has the manners of a pig.  He needs anger-management classes, especially when someone calls him ""xxxhole"".  As a result, the people don't like him and are unappreciative of him.  Everybody knows who he is.  He soon meets Ray Embrey.  Ray is a really nice guy who does public relations work and tries to help Hancock change his public image.

I don't want to tell you anymore because I want you to enjoy the twists and turns and the action.  I thought the movie was brilliant and I am really surprised it is not getting better reviews on Amazon.  I will certainly watch this dvd again.

This version is unrated but I'd give it a PG-13.

There are periods of profanity and violence so if you are squeamish about watching or are squeamish about your children watching then I would not recommend this movie for you.

Other reviewers may have stated that Hancock was no Superman or Batman and that is true in the same way that Alien is no Jaws or vice versa even though they are both monster-type movies.  I don't think Hancock was trying to be Superman ... it is what it is and it should be taken as such.

If you watch Hancock and DON'T compare it to another superhero flick or pick apart every little camera angle I think you will enjoy it as it is funny and the ending is touching!

Just try it!  Don't listen to everyone else says and miss out on a movie that you may REALLY like!  If you don't want to spend the money buying it just yet then rent it or borrow it from a friend but at least give it a spin!",1231200000,,1085,4.084905660377358

Hancock is about a drunk, sloven man named Hancock who, when sober, goes about Los Angeles attempting to do superhuman tasks, though often with tragicomic results that usually destroys money, and occasionally takes innocent lives.  His life changes unexpectedly when he meets a P.R. agent determined to help him improve his image, and the agent's wife, who has suprises of her own.

As a movie, it has some bad language that makes it PG-13, along with the final climax which shows some blood.

Hancock was a good movie. I watched it in HD and it has some truly cool special effects. Will Smith was pretty cool too. He portrays a Superman-ish character, but in a way that shows us how Superman would be if he were a drunk with a sorted history. Hancock genuinely tries to do good, but his alcoholism, and personal demons usually screw things up and his good deeds come with steep collateral damages.

The twist is pretty cool, I think they could have explored it much better though.
For me, they revealed the twist and I kept waiting for more back story which never came.

3112154,4,B0013J55B6,"Hancock is a different take on a superhero. He isn't beloved like Superman or Spider-Man in their films nor is he respected like Batman in his. Rather, he's an obnoxious jerk who just happens to have super abilities who only fights crime when he feels like it or when someone really annoys him!

To be honest, I like this take because not many of us would be a goody two shoes. Hancock is decidedly more human despite his super human powers. In the end, he learns a lesson in humility and finds that he has more in common with the normal man than originally thought.

On the film as a whole, it is rather funny. My favorite part is when he voluntarily goes to jail and many of the inmates that he helped put there confront him. Now, I don't know about you but if someone had super powers and was in jail, I think that's one inmate I'd leave alone! Better yet, if he gave a threat saying ""if you don't move, your head is going up his a**"", I think that would be a sign of ""move b**ch, get out the way"" (with apologizes to Ludacris).

While the plot isn't overly deep, there is a message there and there is a unforseen twist involving Will Smith's character and co-star Charlize Theron! I won't reveal what it is but its a good one!

My aunt got me the blu-ray version of this film and, needless to say, the film looks crisp and clean! I haven't looked at the bonus features yet but I will update this review when I do.

3112161,1,B0013J55B6,"I had the feeling that this movie was made up as it went along.  Will Smith is an incredible actor as are so many others in this so why the one rating?

One...

The special effects were great and I thought I'd love to show at least those to my kids as it was a super hero movie but...

Too much cursing to let any kids see it...

Two...

With Will Smith's obvious box office drawing ability based on his exceptional talent, why is he in a movie portraying a super hero who is black but...  An alcoholic?  And as is often repeated throughout the movie a A-- Hole?  And someone that you don't want to like any way?

Three...

Since it does seem like it was made up as they went along and a...

OK, Well let's do this next...  Why pre tell didn't someone ""Make up"" a few different lines?  So something with this many visual affects that would in fact be at least entertaining to children with less bad words, could be allowed to be viewed by children with parents that actually care about a little thing like that?

Because the story line sure isn't ""Deep"" or anything that I think real adults would find intriguing any way...

Which makes me a bit thrown by all the positive reviews and I go out my way to not bash but this has to be bashed.

Charlize Theron?

Gorgeous as always...

But again, how could so many great actors allow this to be released?

After I had told my daughter who had drifted in and out the room, ""You can't watch this"" as she pretended she or maybe did want something from the refrigerator...  I was thinking maybe she could if I deleted the sound....

Are they trying to bring all the A list actors in this down to being C list material?

I just don't get it...

All I could come up with is that maybe they wanted a Will Smith movie that was a total failure in order to have (Hopefully) him make another one to rebound from and regain his respect.

This movie sucks aside from the visual affects and if you do watch it I am wondering if you like myself think all those that gave it past a one are what they want us all to be like mentally.

I'm left not with questions as to whether it was a bad movie over all because to me it was over all, and all things considered horrible...

My question is why would any one put money into something to entertain and not realize that?

I would like to see a movie about a Black Super Hero and for it to be positive.

Play Ta Challa the next time Will:)

3112163,3,B0013J55B6,"I thought Hancock would be the BAD SANTA version of Superman. I was half right. Starring the action star/quality actor Will Smith as Hancock the drunken-bum super hero, this is a movie without an identity. Just when you think you know what kind of movie it is, they pull the rug out from under the viewer. The change is so huge that is feels like one movie grafted onto the back of another, neither of which is complete or satisfying.

The first act is about Hancock coming to grips with the fact that he is a drunken a-hole and his need to behave himself and cultivate a better image. This is a fantastic plot line, and one they should have stuck with throughout the film. With the aid of a failing publicity agent, he manages to clean up his act, change public perception, and save the day in probably the most entertaining scene in the movie, in which he uses what is at hand to foil a bank robber holding a bomb detonator. This plot line could easily have been expanded to make an exceptionally funny and sly super hero movie, one as good and stereotype breaking as THE INCREDIBLES.

  *****WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD*****

Sadly, the 2nd act introduces a new plot line: it turns out that the wife of the publicity agent is also gifted with super powers like Hancock, who until this revelation, believed he was the only one of his kind in the world. What spins out of that plot is Highlander esq (complete with storm clouds and lightning) and highly confusing. This plot line would have been more suitable for a traditional super-hero flick with a super villain, etc...

Collided as it is with the first half of the movie, it feels tacked on and strange; not because it is strange, but because it in no way builds off of the first act.

The third act brings things to their final conclusion, with more Highlander like dramatics, and a sort of add-hock villain whose limited introduction is a five second television clip describing his back story. This hook-handed baddie is completely unsatisfying, and it's only through a stupid plot twist that he is capable of challenging Hancock at all. Every super hero needs his weakness(es) but artificially limiting the super hero to make the conflict mean something is lame. (And yes I felt this way about the ending of Superman also). I wanted to see Hancock get picked on by someone his own size, so to speak.

Unsure what kind of movie it wants to be, and unsatisfying as incomplete portions of its two identities, HANCOCK ends off target. The film could have been excellent, but ends up no better-than-average because of its incongruity between the first half and second halves.

2.5/5 stars. A good one to rent.",1230249600,2,2658,4.626326963906582
3112164,4,B0013J55B6,"In my opinion this movie is just simply fun to watch!

The acting was great, and the story was very decent. The story-line did almost completely change more than halfway through, but I thought it gave the superhero, Hancock, more back story, as does every superhero!

It leaves open a potential second film, and I've already heard there probably will be one, so there's room to answer any left open questions anyone had for this film.

Hancock is a lot of fun! Check it out!

That's how Hancock feels to me... like the movie has a big hole in the middle.

I wonder if, in order to make the movie run a certain time, the director went to the editing room, and had them cut... no... CHOP... the movie down to the time he wanted...

It just feels like something's missing",1230076800,2,373,4.225352112676056
3112166,4,B0013J55B6,"This was a great idea for a movie with Will Smith as the lead and Jason Bateman as his future PR man.  The movie starts off with a chase scene and Hancock, named after John Hancock, comes to the wreckless rescue.  Here is a superman type super hero who is flying around like spiderman not because he has webs to fly with, but because he is soused.

You get the idea that Hancock is very well known by everyone since this is obviously not the first time he has intervened.  Next we meet Ray, (Bateman), who is a PR man who is obviously struggling with a new idea.  Funny, so, it seems rather obvious that he is going to turn Hancock's life around.  Hancock saves Ray's life and that is where they meet.  Ray tells Hancock like it is and hands him a business card, and this is where the story really takes off.

The first scene is laugh out loud funny,there are definately other scenes that are a laugh as well.  And there are a few surprises.  You have the opportunity with flash backs when Ray uses YouTube to show Hancock some of his less than stellar moments.

Playing Mary (Theron), Ray's wife, who takes Hancock to a new dimension.

The movie is fun, however, there are some things that I think would have made it perfect. Great effects and justice meted out make for a great story, but there are just a few times where the word 'Jerk' could have been used to insite him to action instead of the other word.  Not to sound silly, but young kids were using the word, and for the types of movies Smith has been doing of late, this seems somewhat of a step backwards.

3112172,4,B0013J55B6,"This is a tough crowd here in Amazonland. I wanted some dumb, mindless entertainment and purchased Hancock. Imagine my surprise when I liked the film for many of its railed about bad points.

First, the idea of a screw-up, alienated superhero that causes as much damage saving people as letting them get away appealed to me. It seemed like a novel, human approach rarely written in this type of genre. Imagine my next surprise getting caught up in the film's three main characters, admirably played by Jason Bateman, Charlize Theron and Will Smith.

I'm not sure what would have pleased the critics here as some wanted Smith to play Faust while the other half wanted The Fresh Prince. I just wanted to see an enjoyable film and instead got better than I bargained for.

While it is true that the film doesn't know what it wants to be, screwball comedy about screwball hero, faux drama that still comes off as fairly humane and funny and not all that faux to begin with, to a third act that tries to reconcile both prior acts and does a decent job of it - note, decent, nothing better, but that put Hancock ahead of several other summer films of 2008.

Director Peter Berg has a fine rapport with two African American (how I hate the need to mention this fact) lead actors in his last two films, in the somewhat more serious Jaimie Foxx (The Kingdom) and the seemingly off the cuff humorist found in ""Will Smith"" both doing excellent work in their seemingly different movies. But as I see it, both deal with similar subjects, lives the protagonist has to live with, and in each their way with people that care more than the protagonist may be comfortable with.

But I'm reading more into the film than necessary too, only I admire.

To confirm:
good acting
very good directing,
big, small and nervous laughs
earnest questions as to ""Who am I?""
""Sexual tension""
All of which make for a charming, funny and at times almost heartbreak-filled, in fact, the hospital was one such time. Who do you root for? Someone will get hurt and that someone is decent In fact there's no real winner.

Or am I making too much of a fairly light heartedsummer block buster? Not meaning to be a jerk, but not every film is meant to be Citizen Cane.",1229472000,,2226,4.5361596009975065

I had heard mixed reviews about it before I watched it, so I didn't go in expecting it to be amazing, and maybe that's the key.  It's not the movie you would expect from the trailers, but that enhanced my enjoyment of it in this case.

3112176,3,B0013J55B6,"Will Smith who is a outstanding actor really does a pretty good job in this flick.  It's a average movie with top notch effects and a decent story.  But what really makes it average is the lack of real super villian without that aspect the movie cannot soar like the better superhero flicks.  This movie isn't a comedy though like the likeable ""my super ex girlfriend"" either; it's about a being in turmoil and Will Smith pulls this off very well.  The fact that the other characters are well adjusted makes their performances seem less than they are, but they carry
their parts off very well.  This is a b movie on a A budget and that's a good thing because it looks great and is entertaining.  Hancock searches for redemption and he has to suffer to get there and that helps to make the flick have extra depth too.  Will Smith makes this movie though, the rest of the cast supports him very well  in this quest ,and a leading man couldn't ask for more than that.  As with any movie the blu ray version is a visual treat so this is best way to watch it.  And the print looks great here without any defects at all.  This is a good movie to watch with the kids as although there is cussing it's still got a good message.",1229299200,,1219,4.256521739130434

Like many people have said: I too, was a little unsatisfied as to why Hancock and the girl are these two unique immortals with a rather weak brushed-off kind of explanation as to why they are what they are. And why did Hancock have no memory of her but she remembers everything and understands their existence better than he does. The very most important thing to know about these two, wasn't explained very well at all. But this movie does remind me of another movie where people are living with a unique cursed alternative existence from the rest of the mortal world. Remember ""Cat People?""

Well, I won't be watching this film again anytime soon.",1229212800,,736,4.653846153846154
3112178,3,B0013J55B6,"I am a Will fan but I have to say that his performance in this movie left me yawning. I think he was supported well with quality co-stars but somehow, Will never defined the Character. Even after the the character got a grasp of his situation in the plot, he never ""went live"" in the way I expect Will Smith to play a part. Like with other actors of his caliber, I suppose maybe I expect more and I found him letting the movie carry his character. So in essence, Smith was sandbagging and wasn't fully invested in the part. One man's opinion. Wait for this movie to get into the $7 range before owning.",1229212800,,602,4.243478260869566

I found myself starting to enjoy Hancock after about the 1st thirty minutes or so but for some reason I could never get into this movie.  Basically Hancocks entire story could of been told in a two minute preview of the movie.  I never felt drawn into the characters nor did I even care for them.  I found that I began predicting what was going to happen even though the relationship and hero back story between the two (Hancock and the woman) kind of caught me off guard but I still wasn't that surprised.  I think the cover of the blu ray kind of gives away what the blonde woman might be in this movie.  Usually when I watch superhero movies I can say somewhere in the movie ""I wonder what they will do in the next one"" but I simply didn't care about another Hancock movie.  I felt like I was being pushed to hate Hancock in the beginning and then start liking him when he gets to be a good modeled hero but it all just felt so predictable and pushed.

3112181,2,B0013J55B6,"There needs to be laws put in place to actually write a decent script instead of CGI going overboard and asking to put a small plot around it.

Hancock is about a bum superhero he meets a guy who wants to help change him into a respected hero.... the only thing is, there is no bad guy to take on, there is very little comedy, and way too much drama for such a plot-less movie.

Either give it a super villian and make it an action movie, or make it funnier to see a drunken version of superman. Why leave it as nothing? It leaves too many things un-answered and finishes not deserving any interest in a sequel.

Had this movie not have had the back up of a few million dollars for CGI effects, it would be rated 1 star everywhere, but because it's Will Smith, his devoted fans can not give it less then 3 stars.... you know damn well the movie stinks, take away the effects, it has no plot and your left with nothing but a bad movie.

3112182,3,B0013J55B6,"Will Smith does a great job with this movie about a super hero, who does not know who he is, is a bit of a jerk, is poorly dressed and does not keep any proprieties towards strangers.

All he knows is that he is super-strong. Bullets and needles do not penetrate through his skin, and has lived for quite a long time. He goes about helping others but does so in such a style that people hate him, they boo him and he, therefore, is even meaner.

From the outset we see Hancock turn to alcohol to suppress his loneliness and inner hurt, but in helping a PR agent, played by Jason Bateman, he meets someone who wants to return the favor and clean up his act.

The plot will surprise you at some point because there is a twist that we were not expecting. The movie is not great, but is very entertaining. Charlize Theron delivers a great performance as the wife of the PR agent.",1228867200,,875,4.227544910179641

Will Smith is strange, or rather his career choices are strange. He'll star in a good film like I Am Legend, then do this mess. Just when I start liking him as an actor, this ode to odium comes out. And the jokes in the film are so stupid, Austin Powers quality jokes (hyuck,hyuck).

The DVD itself has plenty of special features, but no apology (I was hoping that one was on the DVD). I know most people will still want to see this - just rent it and don't pay too much for the rental.",1228780800,4,796,4.264900662251655
3112184,2,B0013J55B6,"Seriously, is this the BEST the writers/producers/directors could come up with for this premise of a movie? Ok, I get that it's your typical hollywood fluff comedy, not to be taken seriously, but this is painful to watch. Comedy is best when there is a certain 'shrewdness' or 'anti-shtickness' to the story, characters, dialogue, etc,etc...IF, as this movie does, they're going to pander it to a relatively adult audience. This fails across the board from cheezey plot to the adolescentlike scripting. Will Smith looks and acts totally and completely shoe-horned into this role. This movie folks, is the very definition of low brow humour. Contrived and insipid. There are a few funny scenes, mostly due to Jason Bateman's straight man acting. The ultimate problem with these hollywoodized flops like this one, is you KNOW that something really good and entertaining could have been done with the premise that wasn't such a excrutiatingly knuckle dragging watching experience. I guess this is movie making for the Wal-Mart generation. ;)",1228780800,4,1038,5.221556886227545
3112185,2,B0013J55B6,"Hancock wound up being a Huge disappointment, mainly due to the weird story line, if you can call it a story line. It was very far fetched and pretty dumb, to put it mildly.  Jason Bateman was excellent in his role of the loving, trusting husband and friend to Will Smith's character.  Waste your money if you want, but if you MUST see this movie, take my advice and just rent it.  You will be very glad you didn't waste your hard earned money as I did.

For instance the cover of the blu-ray and some movie posters have Will Smith and Charlize Theron on out, but not Jason Bateman.  Which means there is a love connection right off the bat.  Second, they supposedly lose there powers when they are near each other, but Charlize Theron flies over to Hancock's house and then flies back out?  Not to mention she throws Hancock and the refrigerator literally through her house while Hancock is trying to kiss her.  Again, they are standing right next to each but don't lose their powers.

I would have liked to have seen some ""Greatest American Hero"" moments as if he we're just beginning to learn how to use his powers OR both of them would have really died only to have their powers passed on to Charlize Theron's son.

Lonely and destroying more than he seems to save, not caring what anyone thinks or how they view his escapades, Hancock drinks, curses and half-heartedly saves those in danger.  Among those he saves is Ray, an advertising and marketing guy, who attempts to change Hancock's image so that the world will value him as a ""true"" hero.  With new purpose, a new attitude, and a new outfit, Hancock finds the answers to a lot of questions that he has been searching for (including who and what he is), from an unlikely and surprising source (another of his kind).

While some may not like the ending, if you really think about it, what other outcome could there be, where everyone would be happy? Those who are immortal and will live forever will eventually have the ending that we all want, it will just take patience.  The peace and calm that Hancock finds shows us his true spirit.

3112188,4,B0013J55B6,"Will Smith stars as Hancock, a down and out superhero who is forced to employ a PR expert, Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), to help repair the image when the public simply isn't feeling all of his damaged during his superhero moments.

What I knew was definitely true. Everyone hates him. His first heroic act in the movie began with a little boy shaking him out of his drunken stupor. He then flew off and created millions of dollars in damage.

In spite of the cursing, which there is quite a bit, and a few scenes of unpleasant violence and lots of drinking, this movie delivers a great couple of messages. Hancock lets an image consultant help him through the steps of becoming a better superhero and in the process a better man. Ray, Justin Bateman, is a terrific father/family man and friend to Hancock. There are scenes that are downright touching.

A plot twist completely caught me by surprise. (I could've read the box and not been completely surprised, though.)

3112190,4,B0013J55B6,"Superhero films generally do very well with me, nine times out of ten I will enjoy these types of movies, with some of them ranking amongst my favorite films of all time. With the recent superhero release of ""Hancock"" starring Will Smith, I wasn't sure, when sitting down to watch it, what I was going to think about the movie. Based on all the reviews I had heard or read regarding the theatrical release, I found myself having little to no expectations for this movie. The only way I could think of for even remotely psyching myself up to see it, were two standout features for the release; one, Will Smith always delivers terrific performances, no matter the source material, and two, the unrated extended cut was to include ten extra minutes of footage not shown in theaters. However, even the critics agreed that Will Smith was engaging, even though they found the movie to be lacking. Leaving me with only one question, ""Were the ten minutes of additional content enough to salvage what many felt was a disaster of a film, or was there no hope left for this superhero to cling to?""

""Hancock"" follows the adventures, or should I say misadventures, of an alcoholic superhero named Hancock (Will Smith) as he goes about the business of saving lives in and around Los Angeles. The problem with Hancock is that even when he's doing the right thing, he's going about it all wrong, and typically he causes more harm than good. Enter publicist Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), an idealist who, against his wife's (Charlize Theron) possibly better judgment, attempts to turn Hancock's life around, and transform him into the hero he should have been all along.

Unrated editions and extended cuts are words and/or labels that Hollywood likes to slap across the cover of DVD's and Blu-ray's in an effort to lure gullible customers (like myself, sadly) into believing the movie to be an even better version than the one they may or may not have seen in theaters. Generally, these new editions of a movie are little more than one or two extended or altered scenes that add little to no value to the overall movie. But, there are rare occasions where these unrated or extended editions actually prove to be a completely new movie experience, and many times allow for a much more improved final product than the theatrical cut. ""Hancock"" happens to be one of those rare occasions, because the newly added ten minutes of restored footage gives the story a much more cohesive structure, giving audiences the sense that they now have a complete movie to enjoy. As opposed to one that was chopped to bits in the editing room to appease the wishes of executives that didn't have the film's best interests at heart.

In a summer when superheroes reigned supreme at the box office, ""Hancock"" as a superhero film was sort of an oddity. On one hand he's a super-powered hero that saves the day, when all is said and done, even if he isn't nearly as efficient as other heroes may be. While on the other hand, he's the antithesis of everything beyond having some super powers that makes a hero so great. It's this dichotomy within Hancock's character that makes this superhero movie all the more appealing to me. Sure, having some Academy Award nominees in your cast will help almost any movie, especially when they are the likes of Will Smith and Charlize Theron; but the inner conflict raging within Hancock over trying to do what's right and saving humanity versus not caring anymore, and just drowning his sorrows, is what creates the dramatic element needed for a film such as this to succeed. I also appreciate that by taking this approach to a superhero film, writers Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan, have combined traditional comic book elements such as an allusion to a greater destiny, massive action sequences and great visual effects, together with some off-color, at times raunchy comedy, and even a little bit of mystery to shake up the genre.

I will admit that as fun as ""Hancock"" was, it's still not a perfect film. There could have been even a little more story added in, and a few more elements could have been explained about the hero and other factors within the film; however, had too much detail been added back in, then a majority of the mystery surrounding Hancock would dissipate, which could possibly make for less interest and places to go with the inevitable sequel. Now, don't get me wrong when I say that there could have been a little more added content, what was added back in did indeed bolster the story even further, and the movie does not appear (in my opinion) to have any gaping holes left that distract from the experience, as was the case with the theatrical cut. Although, there are still some elements within the story that did leave me curious, but these were most likely left in the movie intentionally to give some direction for where the sequel needs to go.

Will Smith (""I, Robot"") once again proves that he can overcome virtually any competition and rule the box office, not to mention he was once again the king of the 4th of July weekend. I believe ""Hancock"" marks his fifth movie to debut in first place at the box office over the holiday weekend, and his eighth in a row to debut at number one period. Will's charismatic, and at times commanding, performance made even this seemingly unredeemable hero enjoyable even when he essentially hits rock bottom and has to begin his ascension to become the hero the world needs. Jason Bateman (""Juno"") provides some quick one-liners that hit the mark every time, effectively countering the darker elements within the first half of the film. Surprisingly, Ray (Jason's character) was actually given a decent story arc throughout the movie. I suspected that because he was the PR guy that helped to get Hancock back into the public's favor that he would slowly drop out of the story once this was achieved, but he turned out to be a central figure throughout the duration of the movie.

Lastly, Charlize Theron (""Monster""), as Ray's wife and someone with an obvious link to or knowledge of Hancock's past, was underused in the early portion of the movie; however, the latter half provided her character with much more development and importance, rather than being just the eye candy for the film. Her performance was strong for the most part, although she perhaps played it too overtly that something about Hancock bothered her, and her attempts to play that off were lazily handled. It is possible that this was done in such a way because of how the script called for it or it was director Peter Berg's wishes. Whatever the case may be, I was surprised that this was how she was made to act in the early moments her character was around Hancock, and I found that it made her performance feel uneven, and her delivery even seemed a little unenthused as if she wasn't entirely into the story early on. Once these early moments passed, Charlize quickly found her stride, and her performance greatly improved (as is expected with such a talented actress) throughout the remainder of the film. Overall, had it not been for the generally strong performances of the cast of ""Hancock"", the film's subject matter may not have worked so well with audiences, especially when compared to the other exceptional superhero films released this summer and of those past.

With heroes such as Batman, Iron Man, and The Incredible Hulk knocking out competition left and right this summer, it's a shame that the powers that be wouldn't allow the better version of ""Hancock"", found in the unrated edition to air in theaters. Had this occurred, I believe critics would have given the movie a much warmer reception, most likely not as warm as they did for ""Iron Man"" or ""The Dark Knight"", but without a doubt better than they did for the film's theatrical release. Even with most critics bashing ""Hancock"" all over the place (to be fair there were some that did like the film), Will Smith's magnetism with audiences still allowed him to overcome the adversity posed by negative reviews and come out on top for a week or two in one of the most competitive blockbuster summer's in history.

But, yeah, the movie really was a letdown. It hasn't been the worst movie I've seen recently, not by a long shot, but the fact that I had actually expected more is where it's upsetting. There were so many holes in plot, ham acting, and an overall storyline that just had no point. I don't know. I'd write more, but I'm rather tired all of a sudden, so yeah.

Bottom line: huge letdown and just an overall frivolous, no-point movie.",1228435200,,605,4.298245614035087
3112193,4,B0013J55B6,"The trailer for this movie is certainly one of the best to come around in a long while, peaking my interest in the movie. However, once the reviews came pouring in, I was worried, and decided to wait for Blu-Ray. So is the worry for nothing, or is it justifiable? Well, while some of the reviews were a bit over the top, 'the plot comes to a halt in a scene involving a kitchen utensil.' Really, it's not that exiting, and no, none of the main characters die. The curve is out of left-field, but I moved with it and continued on. The plot doesn't come to a halt, it just changes in tone, since we already got past the drunken hero part. If it hadn't gone in the direction it did, it just would have become too cliched.

With Will Smith in a movie, you expect heavy on the action and comedy, and Smith doesn't disappoint yet again. It's a 4th of July blockbuster for gosh's sakes! You've scene parts of most of these scenes in the trailer, and it's even better in the movie. The magnitude of the drunken-idiot-efforts of Hancock is incredible. And as always, Will Smith is great per usual, as is Jason Bateman. Charlize could have been casted better, but no big deal, as she still looks good after all these years.

However, there are two problems with this movie. First, if you're not doing an origin movie, then implement flashbacks. Otherwise, there's too much dialogue explaining, which naturally leave plot holes, and you saying ""What the heck?"" With proper use of flashbacks, you can eliminate this, and keep the plot moving. Secondly, while Peter Berg does a decent job, they could have gotten somebody better, as the movie carries a largely out-of-place arthouse feel with the camera work. In this case, a normally straight drama director doesn't work here, especially a movie introducing a character. If they had done these two things, then the movie could have been five stars. Otherwise, it's a four.

Overall, in this case, it's just best to decide for yourself and see the movie. You're either going to love it, or kinda love it. It could have been a lot better, but it could have been a lot worse, and it brings a hefty dose of originality to the genre. Just keep in mind, the trailer is probably better than the movie. I am however already lining up for a much-needed sequel.",1228435200,,2289,4.5375302663438255
3112194,2,B0013J55B6,"The point of Hancocks origin has been missed by it seems all who have reviewed here.  His female ""co-angel"" says that they were called ""gods"" or ""angels"" in times past.  There is nothing ""superhero"" here at all, but an adapted story of the fallen angels in Genesis chapter six who have sexual relations with women, then they lose their ability (or so it appears) to return to a ""spirit form"", which allows God to kill them thru the flood (Genesis 7).

I watched both versions of this movie & both are equally enjoyable. Will Smith is Hancock who is a hero that is often called an a-hole, because he's a jerk of a hero. And a drunk. During the movie he undergoes a character chance,via going to prison and getting help from a PR guy (Jason Bateman) The cover gives away that he's not the only superhuman on Earth,sorry to say for those not having seen it in the theaters... This isn't as quite as good as any of the 3 X-men movies (just my opinion) , but its on par /somewhat better than other action movies such as Fantastic Four ( 1 and 2 ) I Robot, I am Legend.

It was cool to see Jason Bateman who was once a teen idol of sorts. I would certainly rent this first if you aren't at least 90% certain that you would like this movie. Id say half of you will call it a renter - and half of you will go running to the local video store and get the DVD of it :) I bought it without seeing it in the theaters first and I thoroughly enjoyed it all the way through. Having seen the 92 minute and 102 minute versions, you cant go wrong either way.
I have the steelbook DVD - which is basically the same as the 2 disc unrated version. If you totally love this movie, get the 2 disc, but if you like it and want to own it and don't care about bonus features,extras,etc, then just get the one disc. (note the one disc has the theatrical version)
++Somewhat of a spoiler - One flaw of the theatrical version - when Charlize Theron ( Mary) goes to meet Hancock ""at 4 O'clock""  she flies to his home. In the unrated version she drives over there. When she is trying to leave - in the theatrical version you can see a quick glimpse of her trying to get back into the car even though in this version she flew++",1228262400,,2039,4.0975
3112201,3,B0013J55B6,"The '08 release `Hancock' began with a great premise and a stellar cast which seemed to be all that was needed to make this a truly memorable film. It did turn out to be an overall enjoyable watch but certainly didn't life up to its potential. It also had some questionable language and content (like the confrontation sequence in prison with the two inmates) that makes one wonder who exactly is the target audience for this production.

Another unfortunate failing was the mistake of not expanding and further exploring the rather intriguing identity and history of Hancock and his feminine counterpart and immortal Mary (Charlize Theron). Apparently the producers were content with the one-dimensional story line, unless of course they're planning on covering that in a Part II sometime in the near future?",1228176000,7,809,5.082706766917293
3112202,4,B0013J55B6,"Not your typical superhero, John Hancock, is a conundrum. He is wreckless, drinks incessantly, doesn't care about anyone else, and causes far more costly destruction than the bad guys. However, Hancock saves a man looking to change the world. To repay him he vows to help Hancock change his image. At first he is resistant to this well meaning man, but eventually he sees he can't continue down the self destructive road he is headed. He even agrees to go to prison to repay society for his crimes. At first no one misses him, but the rampant crime spree that erupts pushes the city over the edge and they finally call upon Hancock to save them. This time he does so with far less damage and earns their admiration. Now only one other thing with him to deal with, he isn't the only one with super powers. The other one is a match to him and although he can't remember more than eighty years ago, they can and they can tell him their past link. This was a nice change to typical hero movies as it shows a more human side with our frailties and dark sides. Excellent DVD quality with plenty of replayability.

3112203,4,B0013J55B6,"This is not your typical superhero movie, or your typical superhero. Will Smith plays a devastated man who has become an alcoholic to cope with the pain. He he has super powers, but because of amnesia he has no idea who and what he is. He just knows that no one wanted him after he woke up in a hospital, so he figures he must have been a bad man. He offends and angers almost everyone with his behavior, almost as a fulfillment of what he thinks he must be.

He saves a man's life (Jason Batemen), who takes him on as a project, and gets much more than he bargained for.

This movie has surprising depth for a superhero movie. It's also interesting to see a less than perfect hero. I enjoyed the personal progression and emotional healing Hancock was brought through. It made the story more real and captivating. I also enjoyed the sci-fi type twists and turns the story took. The special effects were outstanding, and the story held my attention throughout.

Will Smith is a wonderful actor who can bring a character to life. There's just something about him that comes out in his acting that's so likable, despite the gritty character he played. Charlize Theron sizzled and brought real emotion to her character. Jason Bateman was very also very likable which was perfect for his role. Even the child who played his son was wonderful.

I would heartily recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys sci-fi, action, adventure or superhero movies. I didn't give it a five star because it left me just a little bit unsatisfied at the end. I don't want to say more because I don't want to give away the plot, but regardless - It's definitely worth watching.",1228003200,,1652,4.552188552188552
3112204,5,B0013J55B6,"I read some reviews when Hancock came out in theatres. Most of them gave it mixed ratings but there were some 3 star ratings like I saw here on Amazon.com. I can't tell you enough how much I disagree. There have been so many to take a comedic shot at superhero films but they are usually either Ok or just plain bad but not this one. Anywho, Hancock is definitely a great film, so great that I could not wait to stamp a 5 star rating on it and tell ya why but first I'll tell you what it's about.

Will Smith stars as John Hancock, a loaner, alcoholic,and depressed superhero. Of course those are definitely not characteristics you want to see in the man that has superman like powers like Hancock. The story goes that Hancock woke up one morning in a hospital, he didn't know his name, birth date, or if he had any family or friends. By now you can imagine how he got that name of his, a nurse asked him for it and he thought it was his name. He only knew what the doctors told him, that he was hit on the head trying to stop a mugging. Through the years he hasn't really tried to become a perfect hero or even a good one at that but he does the minimum.

Hancock wants to be loved but acts as if he doesn't care and this is when Ray (Jason Bateman)comes in. After being saved by Hancock Ray thinks of a way to recreate Hancock to give him what he wants, to be loved by the people. The both of them set out on a mission to do this but this movie is no doubt deeper than the surface. Things get more dangerous and the plot twists just enough to become one of the best dramatic comedies about a superhero I have ever seen.

First of all I think that Will Smith is one of the few actors that could take a film like this and make it so good. Good job by the writers as well for giving it a good comedic feel but keeping it a little realistic and never going over the edge. Smith did a great job, he made you think that Hancock could actually be real and he was hilarious doing it but still did great with the dramatic scenes. The rest of the cast was also good, I really liked Jason Bateman in ""The Kingdom"" and he did well here but Charlize Theron definitely shined the most out of the supporting cast. She and Will Smith had some great scenes together and made it believable.

The action scenes were very cool, great special effects and seeing Hancock flying like a new baby bird with arms and legs flinging all over was hilarious. One thing I thought that could have been improved were the fight scenes. There were definitely a few but it was just a lot of flying around and crashing into buildings. Had they added a bit of choreography it would have been on point for sure. Because the films acting was executed so well I can't really take a star for this cause it wasn't significant but was still noticeable.

The story was great and I have to admit that I had the film thought out all wrong. I loved the way they make it look like this sort of cool comedy but it starts to run a little bit deeper towards the end. It is not a huge jaw dropper but the twist is still cool, at least to me it was. Overall, I loved the movie, I think Will Smith is no doubt one of the greatest actors to do it. The films concept was definitely awesome and thought out and executed well. The story was written well also and the cast was picked nicely, not too much action, not too much comedy, and not too much drama. It was just right and it definitely showed. I wouldn't recommend this as a family film unless your all over 15 but it is definitely a must see. The empty Blockbuster stores definitely showed this.",1228003200,16,3596,4.138769670958512

3112206,3,B0013J55B6,"As Will Smith has become the ""King"" of the summer blockbuster, you would think the film company and director would produce a proper showing for such high expectations of a superstar.  Unfortunately, what you get here is a stellar first hour filled with lots of character development, complex plot lines, so-so acting (we're not lookin for Oscars here) and some tricked out special effects that are mind blowing to say the least.

Then comes the last 40 minutes or so...  Right about the time Will Smith gets thrown for a loop in the plot line and everything unravels from then on.  I can see why they did this since you can only keep teenage boys' attention for so long before it falls into oblivion.  Take a great story and round up all your plot points for one plot point and get to the ending as soon as possible.  Quite a shame because there was a lot going for this movie in the beginning.  If they had kept that momentum going and used the antagonists like they should have, this would've been a really great film.  Unfortunately, it's all fodder by the time the film ends.

I give this movie three stars because of the great first hour and it being truly visionary in it's concept.  Unfortunately, it just doesn't earn the other 2 stars to make it a first rate movie, falling short of a cohesive whole.  Rent this film and see for yourself but don't buy this one unless you really gotta have every Will Smith movie.",1228003200,,1422,4.4728682170542635

3112209,4,B0013J55B6,"Superman was raised by a kindly couple and taught the decent way to live and respect life. Thor is the God of thunder who was exiled from his home of eternal Asgard to live on Earth as a mortal so that he may learn humility. Spider-man required personal tragedy so he could realize the responsibility of having powers--Batman deals with his tragedy in a very different way, for him he does what he does for vengeance.

All comic book ""super-heroes"" have their stories of the ""why's"", the ""how's"" and the ""what's"". Director Peter Berg's ""HANCOCK"" is a spin on the super-hero genre, together with the screenplay by Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan they present a hero not adapted from any line of comic book myth. The film has all the elements of a comic and exudes ""popcorn entertainment"".

John Hancock (Will Smith) is a man with tremendous powers, he has chosen to use these powers to help people but he has been labeled as a menace in the eyes of the public. He befriends a public relations specialist named Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) who encourages him to be ""nice"" and stop acting like a jerk. Despite the protestations of his wife Mary (Charlize Theron) not to get too close, Ray and Hancock forges an uneasy relationship. Hancock is a guy who has no idea exactly how he came to be--he's an immortal with no memory of his past. He is, however, about to find out....

The first act of the film fleshes out the frustrations and anger that Hancock suffers. He is brash, careless, irresponsible, rude, hot-headed and well, a lot arrogant. He carelessly uses his powers to help but for some reason, the people he helps ends up disliking him. Power without responsibility and the ability to use wisely is indeed a menace. He wreaks destruction to property and his exploits prove too expensive for the city so a warrant for his arrest is issued. This aspect has been explored in Marvel's ""Civil War"" comic mini-series, which delves into a plotline about a required government registration act for super-beings. For in the real world, property damage is a major obstacle for super-heroes. (no wonder they wear masks) The film is sort of a ""coming of age"" movie, as the character of Ray Embrey becomes his sort of a mentor--ironic that a mere mortal could teach him the ropes of ""super-heroing"". The film is sort of a social affair and fleshes out the feeling of alienation to those who are different. There is one major plot hole or a perhaps more of a question in the film, a being as powerful as Hancock can be affected by alcohol or does he just act as if he is so impaired? Where does he get his money--does he do anything for a living?

The film is your usual ""run of the mill"" comic film,  but it does attempt to find a soul. The origins of Hancock is quite interesting and while it is a tad underdeveloped (no doubt a set up for a sequel) the script does offer quite a few surprises. The film does have a sort of a ""love triangle"", no doubt to please the female audience. The mystery of Hancock is actually the film's most effective selling point and opens up to a lot of potential, it manages to achieve this for a first installment. There is a touch of tragedy in the film's final act as Hancock has to choose and sacrifice. It is a bit predictable but nonetheless it manages to maintain its forward momentum since the groundwork had been carefully laid out. All heroes have a weakness--this one is sort of a fail-safe for god-like beings. That weakness may be a little undefined and underdeveloped but it was interesting enough to get some emotions going.

The special effects are quite impressive. The flights and exploits of Hancock is pure eye-candy as he crushes and destroys property. I especially loved the scene when he stopped a locomotive as it is a clear example of his single-minded purpose with no regard for anything else. The superhuman fight is quite fun to see but it was just too much special effects that it lacked definition of the combatants. I rather expected a more dragged-out fight than a minor display of special effects. The film has some nice touches of humor--that prison scene that involved two inmates is very amusing although a lot far-fetched and unbelievable. One thing I have to say, Hancock has to watch himself carefully when he has sex.

Will Smith has definitely matured as an actor since his ""Fresh Prince"" days. The man can indeed act and while it is the same acting style as in his previous movies, he did fit the character. His performance may not be on par as in ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" but he made best with whatever he had to work with. Charlize Theron and Jason Bateman proves a competent supporting cast; Theron is still as sexy as ever and Bateman is the usual ""nice guy"" with integrity.

Overall, ""HANCOCK"" is a lot of fun. The film is very enjoyable and entertaining; while it does have its flaws, the script managed to keep me interested for its entirety. The effective twist is sort of a tragedy and played a key element on its success. The direction by Peter Berg manages to keep an amount of restraint that I commend him for doing so, since some scenes had the dangerous potential to become heavy-handed. The effective chemistry between its performers and the nicely paced action sequences makes it a fun popcorn film. I am pretty sure there will be a sequel since Hancock's character had just started cooking and if there will be a ""Hancock 2"", consider me all in.

Video/Audio: 2.35 ratio anamorphic widescreen. The image is very good but it looked a little soft on some scenes. I think studios aren't mastering Dvds in High-def for full Picture potential anymore to push the Blu-Ray product. It's a good image but it could have looked a lot better. Maybe it was meant to look this way? The 5.1 Dolby Digital audio is very powerful and fits this kind of movie.
Extras: making of/production notes/seeing the future feature about its storyboard and concepts/Effects concept/backgrounds
The unrated version has an added scene to display Hancock's prowess in bed and contains some more profanity. The added scenes may not add anything significant but it does add a more humorous and gritty feel.

Highly Recommended! [4- Stars]",1227830400,,6187,4.652333028362306
3112210,3,B0013J55B6,"""Hancock"" is two films in one and one of them is much better than the other. Hancock (Will Smith)has super powers but no memory of who he is. He slips into a life of drinking to drown his sorrows--the people he saves don't like him because he seems to screw up every time he saves someone. Luckily Ray Embrey(Jason Bateman) a PR man that Hancock saves decides to save Hancock by making him into a super hero that the people will appreciate. Even Ray's son has taken a shine to Hancock while Ray's
wife Mary (Charlize Theron)appears not to like him.

Director Peter Berg does a nice job with the action sequences and Will Smith continues to prove that he has a lot more to offer dramatically as an actor even in a summer blockbuster like ""Hancock"". The major flaw in ""Hancock"" is the uneven tone of the film. It shifts from an almost satirical film about a misanthropic superhero into a darker, morally complex film by the last third. That wouldn't be a problem but the transition is so sudden its almost jarring.

 Interestingly, the unrated theatrical version hints at the complexity to come much earlier in the film with one key scene that was trimmed probably for ratings reasons. The unrated version plays better than the rated version but it is also less succinct with a handful of scenes that could easily have been cut because of the repetition in them. Director Peter Berg does a pretty good job of juggling all the themes and shifts in tone throughout the film and if he drops the ball on occasion I think it's understandable because ""Hancock"" tries to be two very different films often at the same time. The other issue is that there really isn't a bad guy introduced that provides much of a challenge for Hancock.

The Blu-ray looks exceptional with crisp images and colors that pop. Sony has done a exceptional job of transitioning this from the theater to home video. Audio sounds terrific as well with an active 7.1 mix.

The extras are very good. Although we don't get a commentary track, we do a lot of featurettes that take us behind-the-scenes. Aside from getting both the original theatrical version of the film (which has less bad language and a sexual situation removed that IS pretty amusing and also sad at the same time) and the ""Unrated"" version, we also get a nice mix of featurettes on the production of the film. One observation about the bad language issue--the same result could have been achieved with Hancock being called an ""idiot"" as an ""a-hole"" so the use of the latter seems like an excuse to put teens in the seat and get a PG-13 rating (which the film would have gotten anyway for other reasons). When will Hollywood learn that we don't need to hear people spewing foul language out of characters mouths every 5 minutes (particularly in a superhero film that stars kid friendly Will Smith?). I should note that there is also a single disc edition but, beyond the fact that it doesn't have the ""unrated"" version, I have no idea what special features might be on the disc or missing.

We also get a digital copy of the film (some people will like this extra but I find it useless for the most part) in the second disc. We also get ""Superhumans: The Making of Hancock"" a promo piece on the making of the film. We also get ""Seeing the Future"" a 16 minute featurette that can be viewed either as one featurette or in its individual segments.

Visual effects maestro John Dykstra (""Spider-Man"" and the original visual effects for ""Star Wars: A New Hope"" before Lucas messed with it) takes center stage with ""Building a Better Hero"". ""Bumps and Bruises"" focuses on the action sequences of the film. We also get ""Home Life"" and ""Suiting Up"" which are pretty self explanatory looks at the Embreys and Hancock. Finally actor/director Berg sits in the driver's seat for ""Mere Mortals: Behind the Scenes with ""Dirty Pete'"" focusing on the director's off-beat sense of humor and practical jokes.  Rounding out the extras are a series of previews for ""The House Bunny"" and ""Lakeview Terrace"" among others.

The video transfer is outstanding.  If you want to show off how good Blu-Ray can look, you may want to add this one to your arsenal.  The audio is quite good, too.

Will Smith is good in the role of our superhero with issues, but he seems one dimensional. If they had only went a little more serious this could have been fantastic. I don't want to pick this film apart because it is a fantasy, action, popcorn movie. I mean really, does it really have to make total sense?

The film is full of funny moments with good performances from Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron. The film is loud, fast paced and full of surprises, that even I didn't see coming. I watched the unrated version and it has about 10 minutes of footage not in the theatrical release. I will be watching the theatrical release soon and add notes if they're worth adding.

The DVD has a fair amount of interesting extras and the transfer in excellent. If your a fan of the film, I would buy the unrated 2 disc as it includes the theatrical version as well.

3112218,4,B0013J55B6,"I did not see this in the theater because I am starting to despise the face of Will Smith. The theatrical poster of this film shows a huge (and I mean huge) close-up of his face that I immediately get the sense that he will sing his one-hit-wonder ""I make this look good"".

But, as in all cases, rentals give movies a second life and a second chance. So I will give it the chance it deserves. The opening scenes, I was somewhat skeptical and put off by his character. He was a jerk, totally unlikable, and there was no comedy. Was this supposed to be funny? Was I supposed to like him? Evidently not.

But once we meet the more likable Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), which leads us to his family, things begin to change. Embrey is a PR man who wants to give Hancock's image a face lift because Hancock is a reckless superhero, not to mention a drunk and a jerk - so generally speaking, the public does not like him.

Soon we meet Embrey's wife, Mary (Charlize Theron), and there is an immediate ""something"", but you are never certain what it is. And that is really the hook of the whole movie. It's what keeps it alive. I am not going to give spoilers away here.

What starts out as a drunken superhero movie soon becomes something more mortal than getting the bad guys. The film gets more intimate about relationships than any Spider-Man or Batman movie has yet to touch. I am not saying this movie is better than those, but there is such a strong mythological ring to the story, that I suspect it might be ripped from the pages of of some ancient Greek story. But those Greek stories are about the lives of every human, so they have such relevance to all of us that is timeless.

It is this ""mythological"" quality that I found in the film that makes the film transcend the ordinary superhero film. I don't think everyone will love it or see it in the same way I did, and so I am not saying it is a must see. But, at least from my perspective, I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected.

Two final notes: Will Smith was a likable in the end as he was not in the ""Men In Black mode"" of acting (this does not convince me of how good of an actor he is, but more of just box office appeal - 2 different things). Second, I totally did not recognize Charlize Theron. She is a chameleon. I have more and more respect for her with each movie I see her in.",1227657600,,2343,4.184035476718403

""Hancock"" is a unique, interesting take on the superhero genre.  What would it be like to be a superhero?  You would be different from everyone around you; you would be alien, the unknown...basically, not exactly the stereotypical image of a superhero.  Perhaps it's a moot point, but it's certainly something worth exploring within the realm of Hollywood.  Thus, ""Hancock.""  Will Smith is the perfect choice to play this character: He's got the charisma to play the loveable hero (oh dear, I hope I didn't give anything away); the surly ""I don't give a damn ain't I so cool"" attitude to play a drunkard; and the dramatic chops to portray a character conflicted with himself.  Add to this the wonderfully talented Jason Bateman, a great comedic actor whose dramatical nuance is often overlooked (check out ""Juno"" to see how great he can really be).  Bateman's Ray is loveable, pitiable, and admirable, all at the same time.  As for the film's other lead, Charlize Theron...she's a great actress, but she isn't given a whole lot to work with here, especially in the film's first half.  After the twist (which you can see coming a mile away; still, they play it up well enough), she gets to let loose a little more, but we still don't get to see her in all her glory (stop snickering).

The reason I only gave this film three stars...its potential is wasted.  The actors are all talented enough to go there, but the script (or at least the final version of the script, as seen here) holds them back.  Being alone in the world, the only one of your kind, is a dark and haunting concept; the idea of alienated superheroes, forced to face their own hated immortality, is better explored in the graphic novel ""Watchmen,"" which (should) be coming to theaters in 2009.  That is a dark and twisted tale, one that leaves a bitter tase in your mouth.  ""Hancock,"" even with all the talent going into it, winds up being little more than a popcorn flick with a few philosophical ideas that are tossed in there for good measure.  Like I said, it's a shame, because the actors (especially Smith and Bateman) are perfectly capable of going the distance.  If only Hollywood would've taken more of a risk.  They really need to start gambling on Smith; he's a steady draw, and a great actor to boot.  Maybe one day, he'll get the chance to show that an action movie can be more than a mere action movie.  Until then...""Hancock"" is all good fun, and a few good laughs, but it's not what could have been, and that is a shame.",1227657600,10,2765,4.588594704684318
3112220,5,B0013J55B6,"First, the movie was not a bummer as some people said it to be and second it left too many openings in reality to be exact. A Nigh immortal superhumanoid that only gets weaker and becomes a human when he get next to his polar/gender opposite is like trying to put a human spin on GOD.
  Too much unknown unattainable metaphysical elements that baffles the human finite minds. Just buy the doggon DVD/Blu-Ray for crying out loud.  I just think that if such a person/being ever walked/flown the planet in our era they would certainly kick our butts until we were all too scared to even think to call him/her an a-hole.
  I think the scene where he launches the girlie French kid into the sky addreses that fact.  Also I hope I wasn't the only one who caught this but he was going to let the kid die if Ray hadn't delayed him from entering the house.  Goes to showmy point. Also I would like to remark on that little line from That chick who stated, ""You aren't nearly as strong as the US Constitution! Bank on it buddy!""  I can imagine a true drunk pissed off & indifferent superpowered being would fly in with the Constitution roled in hand then shove it down her pompous throat. Superwill stopped a train with his body and I scream at him disrepectfully?  ""NO FRIGGIN WAY BUDDY!""

Just get it and enjoy another box-office smash Will Smith movie.",1227657600,,1345,4.430894308943089
3112221,4,B0013J55B6,"When ""Hancock"" was in the theaters, the television promos gave the impression that it was a superhero comedy flick along the lines of ""The Incredibles"". Out-of-favor superhero who's always screwing up his rescues finds himself unwanted and despondent; a fish out of water story.

Though those comedic elements are certainly there - particularly in the first half of the movie - there's actually a whole lot more going on here.

At its core, this is a movie about love and redemption. It's hard to go into much plot detail without getting into spoilers, but many of the same issues are addressed here that were in ""Batman Begins"", though in a style not nearly as dark: alienation, the public's rejection of the central character, his maturation into a new persona.

Will Smith has evolved into quite an accomplished actor, and uses his chops to great effect in this movie. Charlize Theron and Jason Bateman round out the cast very ably.

Keep an open mind; this movie's a lot of fun. I enjoyed it thoroughly.",1227657600,3,1007,4.803468208092486

Upon watching it I kept trying to predict what will happen and found myself changing my predictions the entire time. Hancock has so many surprises and plot twists that I was completely immersed in the storyline for the duration of the movie (and a little bit after too).

If you are looking for a movie that will be like every other movie then look elsewhere. This movie is nothing like your average superhero movie. If you love those cheesy, predictable movies then put it down. Hancock is funny, charismatic and imperfect. I loved it and all the wonderful surprises. Try watching it with an open mind and appreciate the details of the story, you might be surprised.",1227571200,3,755,4.634328358208955

I'm not joking when I say the resentment I feel today will be on my mind the next time I'm looking to buy, say, a TV or DVD player. All other things being equal, this silly disappointment will be the determining factor, and tip me away from the Sony brand.

As for the movie, I'm rather fond of it. Deeper than other comic book hero films, it satisfied the whole of me, something that rarely happens in a ""Summer"" flick.",1227571200,,514,4.354166666666667
3112227,4,B0013J55B6,"This movie was a lot of fun, and much better than I had originally expected. Will Smith did a wonderful job of portraying a super hero who's lost his memory and his way. The switch from comedy to drama was well handled by the director, and felt natural. However, the writer either doesn't know enough about Greek tragedies, or the studio got scared at the idea of a movie that killed off the main character. This movie would have been worth that fifth star if it had only been willing to take that last daring step into a true dramatic tragedy.",1227571200,,544,4.396039603960396

The beginning of the movie had potential and some parts made us laugh.  Then it seems like the movie started and ended so fast.  There was no build up to the climax and the ending was lame.  We were very disappointed but Will Smith did make it fun.  I wouldn't buy this movie.,1227571200,,404,4.115384615384615
3112229,1,B0013J55B6,"Some bad movies are fun to watch, such as Ed Wood's quixotically demented works, while other bad movies are vile, odious things, being not only crimes against art, but are also crimes against the human spirit.  `Hancock' is a crime against art, the human spirit, intelligence, and decency, to name just a few.  There is no amusement whatsoever to be gained for anyone from watching this film.  The tragedy is compounded in that 2 A-list stars and a cult-comedy icon somehow were compelled to do this film.

This is a loud, boring and insipid film that does not know whether it intends to be a comedy, action movie, or action comedy.  This is not to say that it is actually funny in any places; it is not, but one can discern that comedy was intended in various places.  The script, if it can be called such, plays out as though an 8-year old recycled the worst works of dead scifi writer L. Ron Hubbard after being overdosed on Children's Tylenol.  There is no plausibility, and no internal consistency in this fictional world, and there are creepy, gross ideas, suggestive of incest.

Perhaps the most odious and disgusting thing about `Hancock' is its overt racism.  Here we have an impossibly strong, invulnerable, flying black man, the most powerful man in the world, who wastes his time drinking on the street and behaving like an idiot, until a white liberal takes an interest in him, shows him how to act polite and dress nice.  Guess what: the white liberal's 1st step in showing Our Hero the path or righteousness is to send Our Hero to do a stretch in jail. And better yet: this black superhero happens to loose his powers (temporarily) if he kisses a certain white woman.

Here is an example of the kind of gross, cheap, juvenile, racist trash being peddled: Our Hero, being miffed at a couple of the other inmates in the jail, literally shoves one man's head up another man's butt.  Yes, this actually happens in the movie, the audience is treated to the sight of one man's head clear up another man's butt.  All the while, the theme music from `Sanford and Son' plays, just to make it perfectly clear that we should be laughing at this funny stuff being done by this whacky black person.

Some people might be tempted to see this film because there are few other films about black superheroes, but every other film about black superheroes is much, much better.  The `Blade' films, for instance.  Better yet, see the new film with Morgan Freeman playing real-life black superhero Nelson Mandela, that one is very highly recommended.",1227571200,4,2544,4.670403587443946
3112230,4,B0013J55B6,"I honestly didn't know what to think of Hancock at first glance.  My original impression was that it looked kind of lame, but there was still something about it that drew me into this long in-development superhero tale.  A mix of superhero action and comedy, Hancock is far from being a traditional superhero tale, which helps the film's cause all the way.  Will Smith stars as the title character: an invulnerable and immortal drunken hero who causes more damage than the crooks and villains he puts behind bars.  Hancock's antics tend to get a little more out of hand than usual when he saves the life of PR man Ray (Jason Bateman), who then seeks out to help the haunted hero repair his image, much to the dismay of his wife Mary (Charlize Theron) who seems to believe that Hancock is a lost cause.  There is much more going on behind the scenes, including a dynamite twist that really picks the film up off the ground just when it begins to start to wear out it's welcome.  Smith is great, Bateman is his usually funny and charming self, and Theron is as good and gorgeous as she usually is.  Director Peter Berg (The Kingdom, Friday Night Lights) manages to nicely orchestrate action sequences, even when there is an over-abundance of CGI.  While the film's ending leaves a little bit to be desired, Hancock ends up being a surprisingly good, and different, superhero flick that has a lot going for it.  All in all, Hancock is definitely worth checking out whether you're a Will Smith fan or a fan of everything superheroes, and if it looks lame to you (as it did to me originally), give it a chance.

3112232,4,B0013J55B6,"I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised by Will Smith's superhero outing as ""Hancock"".  I like Will Smith, especially when he's fun and cocky and carrying around a bit of a nasty edge, but I didn't expect his outing as Hancock to be this much fun.  Despite a certain Disneyesque quality, ""Hancock"" retains a nutty humor that appeals both to my adult self, and to the kid within; it has a wholesome, cheeky naughtiness that is embraced by its star, even as its oddball slapstick and spiffy, eye-crossing special effects will dazzle younger viewers.

The plot revolves around a down-at-heels, sour-puss, drunken bum of a superhero named Hancock.  In order to save his own flagging career, a genial PR guy (winningly played by Jason Bateman) decides to kick-start the reluctant Hancock and change him from an embarrassment despised by millions, back into the indefatigable superhero that he once was.  However, all does not go as well as Bateman plans, as he must first save Hancock from himself before Hancock can save the city from the bad guys.  Also in the cast is Oscar-winner Charlize Theron, who does justice to her role as Bateman's wife, a pragmatic beauty with a few secrets of her own.

While not as dark or thought-provoking as ""The Dark Knight"", or as blow-'em-out-of-the-water spectacular as ""Iron Man"", ""Hancock"" is highly enjoyable superhero entertainment of a lighter kind, and suitable for kids of all ages.",1227571200,,1430,4.933333333333334
3112233,5,B0013J55B6,"The visual effects in this movie are amazing! Here is an article I wrote about them: [...]
Great performances by Will Smith & Jason Bateman...dark & funny! --Susan",1227484800,,163,4.857142857142857
3112234,4,B0013J55B6,"Hancock wasn't the superhero movie that changed the genre like the studio's claimed, but it was good, solid entertainment. The theatrical release of the movie was rated PG-13 in order to draw the largest crowd to the box office. What you are getting here is both the R version and the released PG-13 version. The only real difference is ten extra minutes of footage here and there and a good deal more foul language from the Hancock character. Now that we got the ""Unrated"" question out of the way lets get down to the movie.

Hancock is one of those antihero-turned-hero type movies where you see the title character be all antisocial and then eventually learns how to respect others and be respected. Will Smith is definitely a great actor for the role. He gives the character just enough smug attitude without hamming it up. Will had gone a long way from the cut up hero he was in movies like Independence Day and MIB. He also does a good job with the transition of the character going from jerk to hero with all the awkwardness that anybody deals with when trying to change their way of thinking.

The plot progression of Hancock going from zero to hero is impeccable (love the jail time Hancock has to go through). Jason Bateman as Hancock's new PR guy pulls it off with the finesse of being straight man to Smith's antics and the comic foil when Will is playing it straight. Good chemistry with the two. I was surprised at Charlize Theron's performance to the point I didn't really recognize her. I won't say she's Oscar winning material here, but she does play her character right.

Now the story chugs along great up until you get maybe 2/3rd's in when the plot twists come regarding Hancock's origins. Eventually it's ironed out and his whole origin makes some good story sense, but before getting there you have to deal with a big, spectacular and utterly useless fight scene that seems to just be put in to add more action and show off more special effects. When they do finally dispense with the nonsense of that scene things get back on track with what I consider a pretty satisfying conclusion.

The funny thing about this movie is at times you have to just suspend your disbelief farther than normal on a superhero movie in order to let this movie play out some of its jokes. In other words Hancock will do something outrageous and technically impossible just to get a laugh out of the audience. Just roll with it. It's not often and at least they are pretty funny if you let go of the laws of physics, biology and so forth.

The additional footage in this movie boils down to an opening scene with Hancock scaring some girl he tried picking up at a bar, the aforementioned cussing from Hancock (not way too gratuitous... at least not enough to detract from character) and a few little scenes that add some details here and there. No nudie scenes other than Will's butt shot that made the final cut or added violence. Nothing that would ban the movie from theaters at all.

The features on this special edition are... well... okay. Nothing to really write home about. You get over an hour's worth of content spread out over six mini-documentaries and one kinda big one, plus other blu-ray related features and a digital copy for portables. I noticed there are no commentaries on this special edition. That's kinda strange since I don't see why they couldn't just put a microphone in front of the director and some actors and other crew members to make one or two. This is supposed to be the full production version, after all. Here is a breakdown of the featurettes:

On Set Visual Diary - A picture-in-picture view of production you can see while watching the movie if your Blu-Ray player has the profile version 1.1 or better.

Superhumans: The Making of Hancock (approx 13 minutes) - Mainly interviews of the cast and crew, including details on the origin story and how it evolved.

Seeing the Future (approx. 15 minutes) - Pre-visualization sequences for some key scenes.

Building a Better Hero (approx. 15 minutes) - A special effects featurette.

Bumps and Bruises (approx 10 minutes) - Another special effects featurette focussed on some key scenes.

Mere Mortals (approx 3 minutes) - A snipped on director Peter Berg. Supposed to be funny.

Home Life (Approx 11 minutes) - Behind the scenes look at the house sets.

Suiting Up (approx 8 minutes) - Costumes featurette.

BDLive - For BR players with 2.0 profile or better. Connects you to a special Sony website for trailers and possibly additional content later on.

D-Box equipped - For those people with those crazy chairs that move around with the movie.

All of the featurettes save for the picture-in-picture stuff is all 1080p. It's getting old seeing these studios make several little making of documentaries when they can just put together a single big documentary covering all of the details. I guess they prefer many little ones because it looks better on the back of the packaging when it shows a lot of features. Be forewarned that those features are pretty short.

Being a Blu-Ray release you can expect full 1080p resolution. From what I have heard the high def really stands out in the scenes that have a slower pace while the crazy action scenes (like that useless one I mentioned before) don't really benefit from the treatment. Audio is Dolby TrueHD 5.1 lossless and I hear that while it's not going to top the best reference movies out there it's still an amazing experience.

Hancock is definitely a worthwhile superhero movie that takes a different slant on the genre, but doesn't turn it on its ear. Any superhero fan should be able to have a lot of love for this movie. Action fans will get a kick out of it too as well as comedy and sci-fi fans. As long as you can suspend your disbelief a little more than normal for the sake of humor and can forgive an awkward scene or two Hancock is the movie for you. This BR edition? Well it has the most features on any at this time. They may pull a double dip in a year or two and add some extras. Then again BDLive may future-proof that purchase for you.",1227484800,31,6094,4.6103416435826405
3112235,3,B0013J55B6,"As far as the genre of traditional superhero stereotypes goes, HANCOCK (I would rate 3 & 1/2 stars) is different to most.  With plenty of imperfections and an attitude to match, HANCOCK is a character that appears to have lost his way.  At times this coincides with the movie plot also losing its way, but that may have more to do with the screenplay being rewritten a couple of times and also being shelved for a while before production finally started.  I don't believe Will Smith's acting has anything to do with that shortcoming.

In terms of entertainment value, I enjoyed it, and so did my family - with some qualifiers; it's important to not take the movie too seriously, and I wouldn't recommend it for kids under 11-12yrs.  It is meant to be different, and is not easy to classify into comedy, romance, or just plain action!  Yes at times HANCOCK over promised and could have been better and explored some of the main character's past a bit more.  Maybe an opportunity gone begging - but still plenty of other material that does deliver some unique and unexpected scenarios.  HANCOCK reminds me in a way of the original Stargate SG1 movie, which could have been so much better but all was not lost when it was turned into an incredibly successful TV series.  HANCOCK is still good value - plenty of laughs.",1227398400,,1315,4.609442060085837
3112236,4,B0013J55B6,"Hancock (Will Smith) is not your garden variety superhero.  He's more like your garden variety bum.  He spends most of his day sleeping on benches and drinking booze.  When duty calls, he awakens from his drunken coma, bottle in hand to stop the wrong-doers.  If there's a lesson to be learned here, it's not to fight crime drunk because it costs millions in property damage and public outrage.  Luckily for Hancock, somebody wants to help the poor guy.  Cue Ray (Jason Batemen) a publicist who vows to change the superhero's image in exchange for Hancock's saving his life.

The first half of ""Hancock"" is chock full of crude humor and the superhero doing his worst at being the best.  It's thoroughly entertaining and will provide plenty of laughs.  The second half of ""Hancock"" is about the superhero in the spotlight, but this time he is depicted as a ""true"" superhero and the public begins to recognize him as a positive figure.  The second half is what makes or breaks the movie for viewers.  Why?  Because of the unexpected twist in the plot.

While I won't reveal the plot twist, I will say that it will leave people feeling divided.  Some will probably think it is incredibly clever and others will believe it's sheer silliness.  In my opinion, it's both clever and silly at the same time.  Either way you look at it, ""Hancock"" is an original movie...the only one of its kind.  The only superhero movie that does not have to be strict to a source, i.e. a comic book, to appease fans.  It is also extremely entertaining.  Everything from the CGI to the performances make this movie interesting and above all, unique.  ""Hancock"" is definitely a movie worth watching.",1226880000,45,1673,4.703448275862069
3112237,4,B0013J55B6,"For me i thought the movie was a really different super hero movie for me. Will Smith starts off as a bum, being a super hero he ""sorta"" saves the day in his own ways. He ends up saving a man who then befriends and tries to change his reputation from the society he helps. Overall i thought the movie was very good and i like the story line. I just felt there were a few things left out.

3112238,3,B0013J55B6,"""Hancock""  stars Will Smith as a sarcastic, hard-living, misunderstood superhero whose clumsy destructiveness has become a costly nuisance to municipalities and the public in general.  When Hancock saves publicist Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) from a train crash, wrecking the whole train in the process, Ray wants to return the favor by giving Hancock a personality makeover.  Hancock's life and reputation are given a solid public relations redo and all seems to be OK again until he meets Ray's wife (Charlize Theron).  ""Hancock"" is fun until a rather startling revelation about halfway through derails the film and takes it off in an entirely different -- and not entirely successful -- direction.  Smith is his usual charming self and the movie features some cool CGI effects, but it doesn't hold up as one of the actor's best efforts.

Since I cannot seriously say that any movie licensed from Marvel or DC Comics is better than this movie, then this movie is the best super hero movie of all time. This movie tells the story of a man who is down on his luck, nobody likes him and he does not even know who he is. A man in public relations takes notice of him after he is saved by the hero and changes his image into something the public can get behind. And that is just the surface of the deep and engaging story. I would happily recommend this movie over any of the Xmen, Spiderman, Batman, Iron Man, Superman and Hulk Film films if you want to really understand the mythology that goes into actual comic books and be entertained with a genuine story.

3112249,2,B0013J55B6,"There are heroes and there are superheroes, and then there's Hancock, played by Will Smith. He's a superhero who's edgy, sarcastic and misunderstood - with a healthy drinking problem. His heroics get the job done, but leave incredible amounts of damage in its wake - the people of Los Angeles aren't happy with him and razz and boo him, adding to his sense of isolation. Jason Bateman plays an idealistic ad exec who wants to champion Hancock's cause after being saved himself. Jason's wife is Charlize Theron who has superpowers herself she is trying to keep under wraps. Despite some fun visuals and a few laughs, this movie is only so-so, and really doesn't succeed. The movie wasn't very well framed: the beginning wants to be a comedy and the end has some very dark scenes - too dark I feel for what's gone before. The characters are very thinly drawn, especially when Theron's character is suddenly flinging Will about with an anger that is as yet unexplained, the explanation being rather flimsy when it does come. The plot is rather thin as well and we don't really care much about any of the characters: Hancock himself was the most sympathetic, and there wasn't really enough there to make us care all that much, though you wanted to. It was a neat concept, however, and there were some genuine laughs in the beginning, so I'll give it an extra star - though if you rent or buy it, I think you'll have a better experience if you stop watching about halfway through.",1223856000,7,1475,4.633587786259542

It's got some humor scattered here and there, with a couple of really funny moments. I found the acting and script were well done enough to pull me in, and to get me to care about Hancock and the other central characters. The story also had some interesting and unexpected twists. Will Smith was great as usual, and as always, likable, regardless of Hancock's roughness. Of course there were some great action sequences with effective special effects.

3112255,3,B0013J55B6,"Los Angeles has both a crime fighter and a sullen, alcoholic troublemaker on its hands and they are the same person.  Hancock (Will Smith), endowed with most of the powers usually attributed to Superman, will pitch in to save lives, rescue people, and snuff out freeway gun battles, but his services come with a price.  Whether it be shattered corners of high rise buildings, gutted asphalt, train car pile ups, overturned yachts, or upended automobiles, Hancock's help comes with a lack of regard for the incidental havoc his efforts always cause.  He's cost the city millions of dollars in property damage, he has countless civil suits against him pending, and the average man on the street is sick and tired of his arrogant lack of regard for proper civility.
 Hancock's grubby attire suggests homelessness, though he does have digs in a rundown shack in the Hollywood hills.  He drinks too much, is looked down on by children, and appears to be a very unhappy man.
 When he saves the life of goodhearted public relations man Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), Ray sees how Hancock is vilified by the very people who would otherwise be thanking him and invites him home for dinner.  Ray's young son takes a liking to the scruffy superhero, but his wife, Mary (Charlize Theron), eyes him suspiciously.  We don't know why, but that will be revealed in the film's second half.
 To repay Hancock for saving his life, Ray sets out to do a complete PR makeover for him, coaching him on how to respect property and graciously acknowledge the work of traditional law enforcement, and giving him a sleek, cool-looking outfit to replace his booze-soaked tatters.  He also convinces Hancock to take responsibility for his actions.  Hancock goes along with all of Ray's suggestions, reluctantly at first, and sees his image changing in the eyes of the public.  Collateral damage connected to his crime fighting is eliminated, he becomes a media darling instead of punching bag, and he turns into a mensch.
 Smith carries off his role well, shifting from mostly low-key comedy in the first half, with special effects having a field day, to a more introspective performance when we learn more about his origins and why he is what he is.  He plays the awkward, more likable, newly minted superhero like a teenager on a first date:  tentative, unsure of himself, diffident.  This contrasts with Hancock's casual disregard for property early on when he saves the day.  Smith usually exudes charm with that sunny smile of his, but he manages to suppress the charm considerably in the film's early scenes, since we have to see Hancock as the burden to society he's become.  Hancock is not a pleasant fellow, and Smith portrays this effectively.
 Theron adds considerable drama to a role that defies clich.  Far from the charming stay-at-home mom, her Mary is a strong-willed, intelligent woman and a very important ingredient in the plot, not mere window dressing.  The chemistry between Theron and Bateman is strong and you believe them as a happily married couple, and her scenes with Smith are especially touching.
 Bateman is a fine actor who has been showcased recently in some varied roles.  He's always in top form and consistently turns in top quality work, whether it`s as the adoptive father in ""Juno,"" the drugged-up lawyer in ""Smokin' Aces,"" or the cornerstone of the dysfunctional Bluth family on TV's ""Arrested Developent.""  In ""Hancock,"" he's playing a nice guy, but does so as far from the Ward Cleaver mold as possible.  His Ray is thoughtful, principled, and basically decent -- qualities Hancock would do well to emulate -- yet we sense there is a real, passionate man beneath the inherent goodness.
 Director Peter Berg has fashioned a neat twist on the superhero movie.  He addresses many of the questions that viewers always ponder in less eccentric superhero films, such as who cleans up the mess once the bad guys have been stopped?  What does the superhero do when he's not superhero-ing?  And why should the public automatically swoon for a man with vast powers if they don't like him?  For those reasons, the film bristles with originality and keeps the viewer involved throughout.  Berg is also successful at presenting a big surprise halfway through that alters the tone of ""Hancock"" from comedy to a more dramatic mode.
 Rated PG-13 for some special-effects violence and mildly impolite language, ""Hancock"" is a very entertaining film, combining drama, science fiction, and comedy.  Its messages of tolerance and contributing to one's community are refreshing and affirm that good writing can both entertain and leave the viewer with something to think about.",1221955200,5,4666,4.963963963963964
3112256,2,B0013J55B6,"...was the reaction I had by the time I finished watching the movie. As much as I have a distaste for using stupid internet acronyms seriously, that's quite literally how I felt.

The movie had an interesting premise, in a superhero who is a moody, drinking misanthrope with a particular twitch-spot for being called an asshole.

Very early on Hancock's path crosses with That Guy (Jason Bateman's character, the PR guy, whose name is completely forgettable) and they start trying to change him. Maybe 20 minutes into the movie or less, Hancock goes to prison to show people he won't flaunt the law, and to have people clamoring to have him back when crime skyrockets.

The majority of the movie's fun happens within the first half, with scenes covered in the trailer (such as tossing a beached whale onto a sailboat) and some new ones not seen in the trailer (Hancock half-naked, his clothes having been burnt off from putting out a fire, cutting in front of kids in front of an ice cream truck and snatching some ice cream for himself), but these are all covered mostly in YouTube spots while That Guy shows Hancock how people don't like him.

After he's changed to be more decent, it gets touchy and warm and Hancock is a good guy after all.

Then comes the part that had been built up without subtlety... and spoilers follow.

It was rather overt that Mary (Charlize Theron) was going to be involved with Hancock, especially when the director goes out of his way to show her face in a closeup whenever he appears near her for several seconds longer than normal. Then comes a post-party scene, in which he basically corners her in a kitchen and tries to kiss her. Then she throws him into the refrigerator and send both crashing out into the street.

Oh ya, that's right. She's a superhero thing, too.

Then starts the whole ""lolwut?"" moment of the film,, as they try to have her trying to explain to Hancock, her husband, and all of us the whole deal, and fails quite miserably. The story she tells is some mess of them being some sort of godly creatures that were created by GOD (though it is PC never mentioned) in pairs, and that they've lived for like as long as the Bible says earth has existed.. a few thousand years.

Quite frankly, that's only my best-guess summarization of the mess of words thrown at us to see what would stick---in the end, it doesn't even matter what they are, as the point they drive home with brutal redundancy is that if the two of them are close by each other, they both lose their powers and become mortal, which is why Hancock lost his memory, because every time they get too close to each other in history, something bad happens and they have to depart, until one time in the late 20s when Hancock got amnesia (and a story of how he tried to sign out from the hospital, not knowing who he was, and a nurse asked him for his ""John Hancock"", as in signature).

The story doesn't seem to change, but they repeat it so many times in so many different ways that it throws people off, as they start thinking ""wait, they're destined to be together"", then ""wait, they can't be together or they both become mortal and die"", then ""wait, they were built together by nameless-god"", then ""wait, they weren't meant to be together"", then ""wait, they're bound by fate to always be together"" and so on and so on until you really don't care anymore and you just want someone to die just to change the pace.

The entirety of the movie's second-half plot no longer deals with any typical ""good guy vs bad guy"" or ""hero must overcome"" archetype, as a band of baddies escaping from jail try to kill Hancock become so unimportant that even Hancock doesn't spare a second glance at the TV when their breakout is announced on the news.

The entire focus is around explaining, then re-explaining, then convoluting the entire concept behind these two ""godly"" beings to a point where their explanations run into gaping plot-holes, the biggest one being: If Hancock's been living in LA long enough to become a household name, and staying in their house around her for several weeks before finding her out, why didn't he or Mary lose any of their powers being in the same city? Considering how she not only tells him to not see her family ever again, but to leave the entire city, and how Hancock starts losing his powers when he is very far away from her, it's completely nonsensical that he only starts to lose his powers AFTER she mentions it.

The ending is also nonsensical, as Hancock had earlier in the movie ended up losing his powers when he is shot in a liquor-store hold-up, who knows how far away from Mary's house, and when he and Mary are in the hospital, he starts immediately regaining his powers when he exits the hospital and starts putting a few meters' distance between them.

Ultimately, the entire second half of the movie resembled a nonsensical mess of a plot-hole big enough to fit the moon through and a complete lack of actual plot to drive the story other than Hancock's whole ""should I leave the city so I can be a superhero or should I stay for... some reason never explained in the movie"" Because the movie never really does explain why he should/would stay in LA after learning all this... it's not like he fell in love with Mary after his amnesia, and despite all of this revelation, Mary stays married to That Guy and Hancock leaves anyway for their own good.

3112261,4,B0013J55B6,"Everybody hates John Hancock because he has superpowers. The concept of Will Smith as a superhero every citizen of the city dislikes is brilliant, but its execution is not always so. ""Hancock"" is definitely entertaining because it is Will Smith after all, but there is something missing in the slick direction of Peter Berg (""The Kingdom"").

""Hancock"" is an action comedy, or comedy action. It is not a mystery novel, but considerable part of its eventful story should remain untold. All I can say is in the film's first half the director effectively infuses enough humor into his storytelling to keep the film's serious tone in check. The opening sequence shows our hero Hancock flying unsteadily over the city of Los Angels, chasing three criminals in a car. The three guys soon find that the man is not only a superhero; he is drunk. You don't mess with a drunken superhero because the results are predictably catastrophic.

A failed PR man Ray (Jason Bateman) offers Hancock a chance to be a ""real"" superhero. I should not reveal Ray's plan here; his idea may not be brilliant, but certainly something that Ray, a family man, but not a shrewd businessman, would think of. Sadly Bateman's character is rather one-dimensional. His wife Mary played by Charlize Theron fares much better, being more layered. In what way she is ""layered,"" you have to see the film for yourself. But perhaps you already know it. Even so, there are some funny scenes in the kitchen waiting for you.

You may not like the change of tone the film goes through in wrapping up the story, ""Hancock"" stops self-mocking and genre-subverting and it starts to take itself seriously. The film so far has shown only sketchy rules about the superhero's ability, but the film's final chapter suddenly introduces another set of rules to the film's world. The transition from one tone to another looks a bit abrupt and the narrative is rushed at times.

For all these flaws, ""Hancock"" is fun thanks to the slick direction of Peter Berg and effective performance of Will Smith as Hancock. As I said before, it is an enjoyable ride. Hancock is not trying to be a Batman even though sometimes I think the recent Batman films are actually doing the same thing in a different way.",1220227200,,2240,4.765463917525773

Jason Bateman is very convincing and really adds to the movie with his performance. If only the same could've been said about Charlize Theron.

Because the film kept jumping and looping and swirling all over the shop, watching the movie on the big screen just made her feel motion sick and I have to admit by the end my stomach was feeling a little unsettled too.

3112264,4,B0013J55B6,"HANCOCK, starring Will Smith, Jason Bateman, and Charlize Theron, is not what you expect from your average superhero movie.  While the title character, John Hancock, can fly, does have super strength, and is immortal, he is also drunk, rude, and (to quote the movie many, many times) a genuine ""a-hole"".  Yet Hancock still feels drawn or, perhaps, compelled to save the world and to be a hero, whether he wants to or not.  It is a fresh take on an old genre, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

HANCOCK is full of humor, action, and special effects.  I have issues with the editing and camera work in a few places - a lot of the action shots are purposefully jerky and blurred, which can cause eye strain, headaches, and possible motion sickness in some people (including my husband!).  I really love how the script paid attention to most of the laws of physics.  For example, when Hancock takes off and lands, large portions of the street are destroyed.  The special effects are excellent for the most part and added into the film quite seamlessly.

Will Smith, Jason Bateman, and Charlize Theron are all terrific in their respective roles - believable and sympathetic.  Even though this movie does not take itself too seriously, you do care very much about these characters, and you do get drawn into their plights. And you do know that Will Smith will save the world again, as he does every summer.

HANCOCK is thoroughly entertaining, and highly recommended for fans of superheroes, Will Smith, action films, special effects, humor, and anyone who just wants to have fun.",1218844800,,1569,4.774074074074074

You know with a Will Smith movie, he's going to save the world at some point, as he always does (Men in Black, I Am Legend, Independence Day, etc).

The special effects were especially brilliant.  The movie wouldn't have been any good whatsoever without them.  There were so many times throughout the movie I was awestruck at the crispness and accuracy of the special effects.  Truly, truly brilliant, and it made the film stand out.

The storyline was good, but inconsistant.  I don't want to give the movie away, but several key aspects of the storyline just didn't make any sense whatsoever.  I don't know if this was intentional or not, but it didn't impress me, and as we talked out of the theatre, it's the first thing we mentioned.  ""Did you understand why......?  Nope!""

3112266,5,B0013J55B6,"I took some time to see Hancock when it opened at one of the Landmark theaters in my neighborhood. I had not read any reviews or done anything that might give away the story. I enjoy Will Smith and Charlize Theron, though I didn't even know she was in it. I knew the cast and that worked.

After the first few minutes I realized it has some Shakespearean farce to it. I don't mind that having studied English literature, majoring in it and taking the requisite courses on Shakespeare. The farce may bother contemporary audiences. Now that I have read some of the reviews, I realize that professional reviewers should have gone to college or at least read the cliff notes on successful literary formats.

Will Smith did an admirable job of acting as usual. Having followed his career unwittingly, his acting has evolved. He's starting to become more actor and less celebrity. He's a minimalist and brings it off well. When he worked in this role he created plot with his eye motion and posture. He didn't need much dialog. That impressed me significantly.

Charlize can act. She doesn't have to act much because her looks stun. She's matured physically and that doesn't overshadow her acting. Cast her in just about any role and it seems rare that you would notice her art. She's no Jody Foster when it comes to perfection of acting as an art form. You can actually see Jody. It's difficult to see Charlize.

Hancock is a comic book story. The production works in that context and works well. The reviewers I have read forgot the genera. They didn't get that in its context, the performance of Will Smith met the criteria of outstanding. Charlize either walked through her part, which is her prerogative or the director had to work hard.

I give this movie a 5 because it's funny, enjoyable and has the elements of drama. The bank robbery sequence is a remarkable piece of work. It got me.",1218240000,,1888,4.623880597014925

This is a reading of the film, not a review of its entertainment value.  Hancock can solve problems in the world.  Not only crime problems (although we only see that kind here) but bigger ones.  Does he want to?  At the beginning, it seems not.  The same happens with the all powerful companies that Jason Bateman's character is trying to convince to donate something to the world.  They can do things to make a better life for everybody.  They simply don't want to.  They only care about themselves.  That's how capitalism works, you will say.  Ok, right.  But we have Hancock now.  He is here to stay, and at the film's end he is on the brink of taking his godlike status to hearth.  The bad guys in this film are not the petty criminals, but the corporations that laugh at the idea of giving up a (probably small) part of their profits for the rest of us.  If Hancock can fly to the moon, he can also cause a big change on the way things are conducted on this planet.  And that conclusion can only be found in the world of this film, not in ""Iron Man""'s entrepreneurship, and not in the sad, sad world of equally ""bored rich guy"" Batman.  Hancock can secure ""order and progress"" (what seems is Batman's motto) but he also can change that order.  It received three stars from me because certain effects are overused, the back-story could have been expanded, and the consequences of Hancock's existence for the world are not explored.

The first half, in which we meet a drunken rogue Smith is a fun and original caricature of many of our summer blockbuster cliches. He's a first, this asocial disaffected superman in bermuda shorts. The special FX are convincing, if not amazing. Smith snugly fits the role, pulls off the usual black thang with the sinuous savoir faire we have come to expect of him.

Second half, however, tanks. Lame, sluggish, discombobulated -- and that's being nice because it's a Will Smith movie. Theron is frittered on a nonsensical presence. There's even the token shy kid hugging a dinosaur. Tears are meant to well up in our eyes, but I am not much for wet popcorn.

Somewhere along the way a deeper theme seemed to peep out and give us a ray of hope for a direction in which this endeavor could have gone: the universal incompatibility of altruism and power.

He drinks, it turns out, largely because he cannot remember who he is, and needs an anchor to repair himself.

He gets that anchor only after he stops a speeding train barreling down the tracks into a traffic jam. Without him, the train would have killed failed PR man Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman). Naturally Ray appreciates Hancock, even if all the owners of other wrecked cars, and the engineer of the over-turned train do not.

Jason sets about repairing Hancock's reputation by suggesting he do some time, taking responsibility for the massive damage caused by his previous heroics. While he is an inmate, Hancock is suddenly missed. Crime begins to spike. He's needed.

Meanwhile, although Jason's son Aaron (Jae Head) takes a keen liking to Hancock, his wife, Mary (Charlize Theron) deeply suspects him. She seems to know something about Hancock is not right.

Don't see this movie if you want the usual Superman or Batman fare. Hancock is not that---although there is plenty of action.

This film has originality, characterizations and a plot that ropes viewers in, no matter how unbelievable. But it's also a nice family flick with a healthy subtext: Identity, family, love, personal attachments and self-respect are all-important.",1216857600,4,1374,5.057522123893805
3112274,4,B0013J55B6,"John Hancock (Smith) is a superhero that just does not care about anything.  He is a drunk bum.  Sure, he saves the day sometimes, but at a staggering cost to the city.  The D.A. wants him in prison, but no prison will hold him.  He is the focus of lawsuits, but he doesn't have the money to pay for any damages.  One day, he saves Ray Embrey (Bateman) from getting hit by a train.  Ray, who is in the public relations business, decides to help Hancock improve his image.  His plan involves some time in prison, rehab, and a superhero costume.  Hancock is reluctant at first, but soon gives in.  Hancock is on the way to turning his life around, when he is blindsided by a revelation that will cause him to question his abilities and the kind of person he really is.

""Hancock"" is an interesting idea for a superhero movie.  After seeing all those heroes that are saviors of the world, Hancock is one that just doesn't give a damn.  Will Smith has the charisma to be that superhero, and make the jerk actually likeable.  This is another movie that is saved by Smith's charm.  Without him, this movie would probably not work.  The story itself is really two stories sandwiched together.  Director Peter Berg would have been better off focusing more on the first half of the film and doing away with the second half which explores Hancock's origins.  The second half has been completely ignored in all advertisements for the film, and at least provided a bit of a surprise.

When aroused from his alcoholic stew, he flies off to right wrongs, invariably creating far more damage than he prevents.  Fortunately both for him and the Universe, he finds that he has been intimately entwined with a female superheroine for the last several thousand years [he just forgot about it].  Tragically, when the two are together they both acquire mortal traits.  Both get shot full of holes and very, very nearly die, but supercharacter, in a supreme act of self-denial, bounces away from his dying paramour and both are saved to Save the World.  Yeeaach!

3112276,5,B0013J55B6,"I think I may have used that term lightly there, but it's something I think can really be applied to Hancock. This movie has been written since 1996 and has been passed from director to director until we finally got the finished product this year.

Hancock is an alcoholic superhero who's fallen on bad times and seems unable to do any right. He tries to help those in need but always seems to make things worse. Ray Embrey is a corporate PR consultant who's struggling to sell his All-Heart logo which represents companies banding together to try and change the world. While on his way home, Ray is caught on the train tracks and is faced with an oncoming freight train. At the last minute Hancock steps in and saves Rays life, but it's at a cost of a couple of million dollars. The public turn on Hancock for the mess he's made but Ray steps up and defends Hancock. After being taken home by him Ray offers to help Hancock become a better man and be the superhero he's destined to be. Hancock decides that in order to make his life better he must take Ray up on his offer. Before he can become the superhero he's destined to be, he must first go to prison to pay for the collateral damage caused by Hancock's negligence.

This has received a lot of criticism by people saying it seems to lose its way at about the half way point of the movie. I have to agree, but that doesn't mean it becomes a bad movie because of it. It started off as a comedy and seemed to end as a fantasy drama. The action scenes made up for the change as they put most recent comic book movies to shame. Along with stunning special effects and at times very witty and what would be called adult humour, they blend together well to make some spectacular scenes. I can't really say too much about the biggest action sequence as it gives away what becomes the focal point of the whole movie, just know that it's awesome.

This is Will Smiths 7th number one movie and is something that he should be immensely proud of. Hancock is also a film that has furthered the cause of naming Will Smith as one of the most diverse actors in the industry. I have loved all his movies to date, and Hancock is no exception. If you're a fan of comic book movies, action movies or just a general fan of Will Smith, then I promise you will love this.",1216512000,4,2304,4.291954022988506
3112277,5,B0013J55B6,"In the same way contemporary ""graphic novels"" are not the comic books of 1950, Hancock is not a superhero-movie like Chistopher Reeves' Superman of the 1970s & 80s.

Hancock is the graphic novel version of an immortal, physically invulnerable, superstrong, flying madman.  His physical attributes outfit him for hero status, but his mental & emotional instability don't.

As a non-category movie, Hancock almost became a non-starter.  If it weren't for Will Smith's univeral appeal -- it probably would have been.  But as a movie-going public, we know that we will pretty much always be entertained by this guy.  And it turns out to be true.  In what is ultimately a tragic-hero role, we are entertained.  We laugh at his super alcoholism.  We laugh at his super social failings.  We laugh at his super amnesia and his super bad judgement.

But we also recognize that he didn't put on the suit the way Clark Kent did -- for truth, justice, and the American Way.  He wasn't looking for his 15 minutes of fame, or a place in the DC Hall of Fame.  He was wallowing just like Joe-down-the-street wallows.  That he happens to be able to fly is almost irrelevent except for its comic value.

While Superman and Batman are part of our collective All-American mythos, Hancock (with his all-too-American name) really isn't.  Hancock is a representative of the more global ""we're all cut from the same cloth"" religion.  Hancock is the flipside of Smith's role in Independence Day -- the American hero who saves the world.  If you didn't read it at the time, you need to know that most of the world snorted a good laugh at our cinematic arrogance over that one.  By the time Independence Day came out, our military supremacy, and America-saves-the-world cocky-ness were both wearing thin.  The idea that only we, in the bowels of Area 51, could come up with a plan to rescue all those other poor, blundering slobs in Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa, and South American was the biggest ego-folly of the century, and the biggest joke of that otherwise fireworks show movie.

Hancock is completely devoid of the cocky American attitude.  The only sign of even pro-American heroism is in the REALLY heroic goodness of Jason Bateman's character who sets about to help Hancock out of the American gutter.  What Hancock does have, finally, is humility and self sacrifice -- far better commodities to be pushing as super-heroic.

For those indulging in super-hero bashing -- you wern't watching the movie you paid to see.  You were watching for the movie you expected to see.  Which is sad, really.  If you'd been paying attention, you'd have seen a graphic novel onscreen about what America needs to be to reclaim its super-hero status.  But since that doesn't involve bellowing super-music, or CGI'd miracles, it might be too subtle for some.",1216252800,8,2825,4.865828092243187
3112278,4,B0013J55B6,"Hancock is a movie that intrigued me when I first saw the previews.  The premise is that Hancock (Will Smith) is a 'person' with superhero powers.  Rather than being our normal clean cut hero, Hancock is a drunkard and a little wanton with the material around him (call him Chaotic Good for those who know D&D, working for the greater good, but doing it his way).  After the initial chase scene (with some good stuff done by Hancock), Hancock saves a man (Ray) who makes a change in his life (Ray is a public relations person who sees the benefit of improving Hancock's image).  To improve Hancock's image, Ray has Hancock be accountable for what he's done, confront himself, and try working with others (like complementing them when they've done the best they can).

My Likes:
An interesting look a characters (Hancock and the people around him).  Will Smith is interesting with this role.  He's not the clean cut Hero you see so many times.  Matter of fact, he's something of an anti-hero (at least in the beginning).  I've always had a weakness for the anti-hero because they show so much more about humans.  In this case, we learn (later in the story) that love is the cause of the anti-hero character.  I was also fascinated how they turn Hancock from an anti-hero to a hero.  The transition is where the story is the strongest where we see Hancock wanting to be the anti-hero but desiring the hero role.  This is best shown when the story asks the question on which type of love is most important; romantic or taking care of those you love.

My Dislikes:
The major dislike is the main villain; he's way to two dimensional.  I realize that they needed to have a villain that would challenge Hancock, however this villain was weak.  Lex Luther from the Superman movies was better than this guy.  I firmly believe that this could have been handled much more gracefully with a minor villain getting out of jail and attempting to do something.  Instead they gave us a villain that's 'intelligent' but not really.  He's predictable with his attempt on Hancock and a waste of airtime (in my opinion).

The Rating:
A good 4 star movie.  Will Smith does a great job, Jason Bateman is good as Ray, and Charlize Theron is also good (there's a nice surprise I won't ruin).  If you're going to this movie, entertainment should be your first focus.  A secondary focus is to look at the characters and see how important love is.  Don't go looking for the meaning of the world or an empty action flick where every minute is full of action.  There is some swearing, nominal blood, and lots of gun shots, however the timeless story it has is interesting (at least for me).  A good movie for the family (we had kids 8 and up with us).",1216080000,3,2721,4.5473251028806585

Will Smith continues to be the true king of all media, he is believable as a character no matter how unlikely the scenario.  And to be sure this is a ridiculous scenario, but no more so than that of any ""Super Hero"" tale. If you can suspend belief to agree that there is such a thing as a Super Hero, (some-one with such extraordinary abilities) then it isn't hard to accept that such a person might have character flaws  (Don't we see that in virtually every person with extraordinary abilities)?

So for me, I kind of liked this is a metaphorical study (I have been accused of reading too much into things). In 1979, in a class at the MTC by BYU, I heard a teacher say something that has always stuck with me ""They never care how much you know, until they know how much you care"" Sometimes, I have found, that people will act like they don't care what you do for them unless they like you.  That is until they really need what you do for them, (of course then they may still resent that you are the one that saved them).  This is the real story of Hancock for me.  Now the question is... Is a high budget comedy action movie the best vehicle for that lesson? Probably not; But what is the best? I have no idea.
Now the real problem with the film is the secondary plot, about the nature and origin of the superpower. Did that work? No it did not.  Other than to express the loneliness of Hancock, it detracted from every other aspect of the film.  So a movie that started pretty good (for me), ended up just being an okay way to spend an afternoon with my sweetheart.

Despite his generic-sounding name, John Hancock is not your average, run-of-the-mill reluctant superhero; he's  a reluctant superhero with a drinking problem and anger management issues.  Disheveled and unshaven in his appearance - and equally rude, crude and belligerent in his demeanor - Hancock lives by himself in a broken down trailer on the outskirts of L.A., a self-appointed outcast, for all intents and purposes, from the society around him.  Alternately either inebriated or nursing a hangover, Hancock seems to have as little use for other people as they have for him.  For even when he's out and about thwarting crime and rescuing the innocent, he's doing so more out of a sense of duty to his superhero DNA than any overwhelming love for humanity.  Plus, his antics usually result in so much collateral damage to any buildings and motor vehicles that happen to be in his vicinity that the ungrateful citizens of the city would just as soon he leave them to their own devices and find some other metropolis that might be more amenable to his services.  One day, however, he saves the life of Ray Embrey, an image consultant who believes he can turn the public's perception of Hancock around if only the superhero will allow him to work his magic on him.  And perhaps, along the way, Ray will also be able to somehow reach that untapped vein of goodness residing at Hancock's core.

Directed by Peter Berg, ""Hancock"" deserves kudos for at least attempting to inject some new life into a genre that seems well on its way to cannibalizing itself out of existence through tiresome repetition and massive overkill.  It tries for a slightly more intimate experience by concentrating on Hancock's all-too-mortal weaknesses and by not having him go up against one of those arch villains that come as part of the standard package with the genre (Hancock has enough internal demons to wage battle against to have much time left over for anything else, I suppose).  Unfortunately, after coming up with a fairly original and promising premise, the filmmakers let it get away from them through a combination of unfocused storytelling, gear-grinding tone changes, and CGI work that seems a trifle on the substandard side for an action film of this size and scope.  Part ""My Fair Lady,"" part ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith,"" part ""The Pursuit of Happyness,"" and part whatever-else-they`ve-managed-to-throw-into-the-mix, the Vincent Ngo/Vince Gilligan screenplay wanders all over the map before finally settling into the slushiest, most rheumy-eyed superhero finale this side of ""Spiderman III""  (though let me just state right up front that ""Hancock"" is still miles above that fiasco).  That's a shame, too, since Will Smith is as amiable and likable as ever, while Charlize Theron, Jason Bateman and adorable little Jae Head (from TV's ""Friday Night Lights"") are equally appealing in their supporting roles.

""Hancock"" is not a bad movie really, just one that feels halfhearted and half-baked, earning it a Gentleman's C+ in the final analysis.",1215993600,4,3038,5.072289156626506
3112281,4,B0013J55B6,"I find myself in complete disagreement with the critics and their take on HANCOCK, Will Smith's (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Am-Legend/dp/B0013FDM7E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Am Legend</a>) latest Summer release. I'd heard all kinds of drastic problems with Hancock, which kept me away from the theater. Most notably that the latter half of the film sank it to obscure and muddy waters, and thus made it a bomb. Again, I couldn't disagree more.

If you're looking for the standard Hollywood fodder and its take on superheroes, then I might see where you could run into some snags. But if you're looking for a bit of a twist on the superhero image, then you're in for a treat.

Anybody who watches TV or has gone to the movies in the past few months knows Hancock's premise: a drunken superguy (Smith) is lost amongst humanity. He knows not where he came from, nor how he's supposed to fit in with people who are so different from himself. He tries to do good, but more often than not does millions of dollars of damage in the process, incensing the Los Angeles population. Roads tore up. Highway signs obliterated. Monuments defaced. Train cars derailed. It's all a bit much for our wayward (and intoxicated) hero. Until one day he meets up with Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Smokin-Aces/dp/B000O77SF4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Smokin' Aces</a>). Hancock saves Ray's life in that infamous train scene that many of you have probably seen in the trailers. What results is a friendship of sorts thanks to Ray's chosen profession (pubic relations). Convinced that he can clean-up Hancock's messy image, Ray convinces the superman to ease up and fit in. In the meantime, he suggests that Hancock go to prison for his many warrants, and Hancock eventually agrees. The idea for this is twofold. First is that it'll keep Hancock out of trouble (with the exception of one episode of cranial-rectumitis); second is that the crime rate in L.A. will go up and people will demand his return.

Intermixed with this is Ray's family and how they interact with Hancock. Ray's little boy Aaron (Jae Head) is lovingly appreciative of Hancock, and this helps show cracks in Hancock's otherwise indifference toward ...everything. But more interestingly is how Ray's beautiful wife Mary (Charlize Theron,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-the-Valley-of-Elah/dp/B0011V7PSC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In the Valley of Elah</a>) deals with Hancock's sudden arrival. Not giving away too much, I will say that this surprise ...well ...surprised me in a good way.

The story arc is excellent in that the focus is never on Hancock's superpowers but on the man himself and how they affect him and those around him. It is this ""human"" element that shows director Peter Berg's ability to take a solid action film and put its focus squarely where it belongs: on the people, not the powers or the special effects (although both of these are done very well). And speaking of story arcs ...

It was refreshingly revolting to watch the ""a-hole"" comment that Hancock so loathes come full-circle, right up to the very ending credits in the film. I was laughing myself silly at the end (Hint: stay until the credits are nearly finished rolling).

Comments about the ""funny first half"" and the ""serious second half"" of the film just didn't jive with me as a criticism. The film had laughs throughout, with spikes in dramatic flair (appropriately) and some nice doses of science fiction/fantasy that held a cohesive whole.

Perhaps I'm prejudiced because of a few insider things that I know about Mr. Berg, but putting that aside, I've found that almost all the film's he's directed to be very human (I'm being repetitive, I know, but bear with me a moment). From&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friday-Night-Lights/dp/B00005JNEW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friday Night Lights</a>&nbsp;and it's focus on the members of the team and not the sport itself to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Kingdom/dp/B000Y7WGOW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Kingdom</a>, which showed us the internal struggles of the war in Iraq and not the war itself, Berg has a good eye for what makes cinema an effective medium.

Will Smith's traditional summer blockbuster hero busts a lot more than a few blocks, but the movie winds up a little short of super.

The special effects are outstanding, but Jason Bateman's performance is average, Charlize Theron doesn't try very hard, and the title role seems more suited to some other actor rather than a proven summer-hit mega star like Smith.  In the second half in particular, ""Hancock"" sometimes seems more like a Nicholas Cage role, which should tell you what I thought of it.

Still, Smith makes the movie worth watching, if only for the great first half, that tight black costume and the aforementioned special effects.

In summary: Super Smith, not so super story, superb stunts.

I urge anyone who reads this go see this in the theatre, right now! today!!! I assure you, YOU will not be disapointed.",1215907200,2,670,4.2421875
3112284,4,B0013J55B6,"To preface this, it is important to understand that I have long had a grudge against Will Smith.  His real life cockiness permeates his acting, which is mostly sludge, consisting of either a wise-crack or his deep, sad face (tenses his face, clamps down his jaw, frowns slightly and wells up a few tears).  I, Robot made me really hate him because the entire movie was a poorly written advertisement.  I am Legend continued the trend with a lame story and extensive use of ""sad face"" instead of acting.

Hancock does suffer from the same element of too much ""sad face"".  Still the movie is predominantly a comedy, which is what Will Smith does well (as does Jason Bateman).  I would, in fact, say this is a very good film based on its comedic aspects alone.

The movie's concept is that Hancock is a superhero who just cannot seem to do anything right, and is universally hated among the public he is called to protect.  As far as I know this is a pretty unique idea, which is quite rare in Hollywood today.  This is what the previews advertised, but the movie's hidden surprise is that it actually develops the story surrounding this superhero.

Why is he a superhero, where did he come from and why is he alone?  These are the questions the movie addresses.  The answers to Hancock's antediluvian origins are both surprising and enjoyable to find.",1215734400,,1349,4.598326359832636
3112285,2,B0013J55B6,"As if we do not have enough superhero movies already with the steady flow of umpteen sequels and still new ones in the works (Ant-Man is due out in 2010, I wonder what will be next Larva-Man?), someone had to create a completely new, original 2008 superhero with no comic book past--Hancock. Even with three strong performances, the film collapses from its' poor start and even worse end finale.

Will Smith has the title role of Hancock, a one-of-a-kind superhuman who works with the LAPD to catch criminals. Well, at least he is supposed to but he has become an alcoholic to deal with his constant mood of depression, and his inebriated antics have caused millions of dollars in damages to Los Angeles City. All of which has caused him to fallout out of the public's favor. Enter Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) a PR consultant who wants to help him repair his image. Before long, well actually almost immediately, Hancock agrees, and the two form an unlikely duo. The finale comes rather abruptly with one of the most surprising, confusing finale that is what ultimately ruins Hancock.

All three talented stars (Will Smith, Jason Bateman, and Charlize Theron) play their parts entertainingly well, but the story, script, direction, and camera work are what destroy it. The film clocks in at 92 minutes, leaving no time for character development and all the events happen so quickly and abruptly that it feels like an extended TV episodes with gazillion-dollar effects.

Another thing that I found particularly annoying was this constant ""shaky"", close-ups of who ever was in the scene. Almost as if the studio was trying to save money on set design so they kept the camera in really tight.

Once again the time and effort was put into wowing the audience with the special effects, which are quite remarkable, rather than entertaining with a strong story and developed characters. I would not even recommend it as brainless entertainment because it was rather boring. I still wonder why someone felt the need to go and create ANOTHER superhero movie.",1215734400,2,2048,4.893371757925072
3112286,4,B0013J55B6,"Hancock is one of the best movies I have seen this year, and I see a LOT of movies in all genres except gross horror. Maybe I like this movie so much because I am first and foremost a reader of books. I am used to, and can appreciate, a rich story with plot twists and complex characters; the kind of story that is hard to fit into media bits and bytes.

Most superheroes fall into a vat of something and come out with mysterious powers and a one-dimensional, and overwhelming desire to devote their life to being ""wonderful"" by killing bad guys.  Blah blah blah, same old same old.

I can relate to a character like Hancock who is emotionally hurting and alone yet still giving in to a sense of obligation to use his powers to help people.  Resentful, messy, and ungracious to be sure, but doing it anyway.

Hancock and this story are representative of every person who is going under for the first, third or hundredth time but just cannot completely quit...they keep going, and sometimes, are able to take hold and overcome themselves with the help of another person.

The movie is funny, heartfelt, raucous, and downright entertaining with explosions, fights, and remarkably little gore or vulgar language.  The scene in the prison where all the convicts are shrieking and crossing themselves is a visual play on words that still makes me laugh!  I don't know if I can wait for the Blu Ray DVD, I may have to go to the theater and watch it again.

Thank you and Right On, Will Smith, Charlize Theron, and Jason Bateman for stepping outside the box with this exquisite treat of a movie!  Different can be great!",1215734400,,1613,4.531034482758621

Charlize Theron, who is overrated as an actor but a striking looking woman nonetheless, was not very convincing at all.  It seemed like she was phoning in her lines and expressions- perhaps it was too difficult a role for her.

But really the main problem had to do with the writing.  The story lacked fluidity and when the element of surprise came in it seemed like the ""movie-makers"" were too impressed with their own plot twists to convince the audience that they should be too.

I don't know about anyone else, but I've notice that this summer seems to have had a slew of really poor blockbusters movies so far with a few exceptions- Kung Fu Panda, Iron Man and a few others.",1215734400,6,885,4.398773006134969
3112288,3,B0013J55B6,"""Hancock"", or This Summer's Stop Gap between ""Iron Man"" and ""The Dark Knight"", the new film starring Will Smith, is a funny, fast-paced completely imperfect piece of cinematic fluff designed to help you while away a small piece of your summer at the multiplex. Will it be remembered as one of Smith's best? No. Will you enjoy the film? It will help you pass the time until ""The Dark Knight"" hits theaters.

Hancock (Smith) has superhero powers, but every time he gets involved with something, a lot of destruction happens due to his careless attitude, causing his public image to sink lower than W's current approval ratings. It doesn't help matters that he is always drinking and is openly hostile to everyone who approaches him. Hancock is a superhero with some problems. Passed out on a park bench, a little boy wakes him up and points to news coverage of a gang of gun-toting thugs speeding down a Los Angeles freeway, shooting at will at the cops in pursuit. A lot of innocent people are being hurt, cars crashing and the police aren't doing much good. Hancock groans and shoots off into the atmosphere, leaving a crater of destruction and crashing into a couple of things along the way. Soon, he catches up with the SUV and literally drops in to talk to the criminals, trying to get them to stop. When that doesn't work, he grabs the SUV and flings it onto the needle on top of the Capital Records building. A lot of people get upset at the destruction Hancock has caused despite putting an end to the deadly chase. On his way home from work, Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), a public relations man with a grand scheme, finds himself in need of some help. Miraculously, Hancock arrives and provides assistance. Destructive assistance, but he saves Ray's life. Ray realizes Hancock needs some image rehabilitation and offers to help him out. He also invites him to dinner; he meets Ray's son, Aaron (Jae Head) and second wife, Mary (Charlize Theron). It is spaghetti and meatballs night, he doesn't want to miss that, Ray promises. Mary is a little put off by the alcoholic man who swears in front of their child. Ray convinces Hancock he needs his help as much as the city needs the reluctant superhero, so he agrees to Ray's plan for image rehabilitation. But as Hancock exiles himself to prison, the crime rate grows and the public outcry for his return grows just as a strange force begins to change his powers.

""Hancock"" directed by Peter Berg (""The Kingdom"", a popular TV actor) is not a perfect film. Far from it. There are a couple of plot holes Hancock couldn't jump across despite his superpowers and one scene seems particularly superfluous and a lame excuse to spend some special effects budget. But it is a fun, lighthearted piece of fluff.

From the moment we meet Hancock, we realize he will be a challenge. Happier with a bottle of alcohol handy (when he wakes up, he grabs one from a waiting carton which holds still more bottles) he rushes off to help. The real fun in Hancock comes from his interactions with the public. Smith lets loose and his character says whatever he is thinking, whenever he wants, frequently offending people and many bystanders gather around him. This leads to a real love/ hate relationship between Hancock and the public. Which in turn further fuels his mixed feelings about helping the public.

Smith is absolutely the right choice to play this role. He may be the only choice who could successfully pull off the character. Surly, drunk and ready to voice his opinions, he is initially reluctant to do anything. Whenever he does, he knows something will go wrong and he will be blamed for a lot of damage. So he is a bit reluctant to use his super powers. Yet, he finds people expect him to help even though they know something will go wrong. Causing him to feels he is in a bit of a conundrum. And the public can't understand why he doesn't make the RIGHT choice when he decides to help.

Smith, who has become known as Mr. Fourth of July due to the string of hits he has appeared in, all of which were released on the holiday weekend, ""Independence Day"", ""Men In Black"", ""MIB II"", ""Hancock"" and others, brings the right blend of humor, confusion and anger to the role. As he gets upset with the constant nagging of the public, he lets the insults fly and isn't afraid of stating exactly what is on his mind. When he meets Ray, the PR man tries to explain to him, to convince him, why Hancock needs his services. And some of what he says seems to sink in. Hancock starts to realize that he could use a bit of an image makeover, he isn't happy and a large part of that is due to the constant bickering with the public at large. Why don't they like him? He saves so many lives? He decides he wants to become more liked within the community as he tries to help keep the bad guys in check.

This leads Ray to propose a radical plan and he urges Hancock to go through with it. Sure enough, Ray's predictions come true and the city soon calls on Hancock to help them out.

Jason Bateman plays Ray, who we first meet proposing a radical new image campaign to a pharmaceutical company. The guy's plans are ambitious, but we can't fault him because he is trying to do some good in the world. After Hancock helps him escape a potentially dangerous situation, Ray realizes he may have met just the person he needs to get the idea off the ground. If he can change Hancock's image for the better, he will become much more attractive to other companies. And his plan will be that much easier to sell.

So he sets out on his toughest assignment yet. And he brings Hancock home to meet his son and wife.

Bateman is very good. Funny, low key and charming, it is easy to see why Charlize Theron's Mary fell for him and why he is trying to change the world with his new image campaign.

Charlize Theron plays Mary, Ray's second wife who clearly seems to love and adore her husband. When she first meets Hancock, she regards him with some hostility; he brings a bottle of whisky to their dinner table and openly drinks in front of them, not bothering to hide his drunken state. And Mary is very worried about how Hancock might affect her husband's business. So she doesn't warm up to him right away.

Charlize Theron is good in the film, but this is basically a supporting role, so it seems strange to see the Oscar winning actress playing the part. I suspect she took the role for the challenges involved and also because the opportunity to appear in a big budget summer release doesn't come every day.

While the three actors are good, there are some plot holes, which threaten to derail the entire film. First, the filmmakers tip their hand to a 'secret' far too early. As soon as they start to shoot hints at this, your mind starts to race and you try to figure it out. When your mind starts racing, it comes up with a bunch of scenarios, and unfortunately, most of these are more believable than what happens in the actual film. So this becomes a bit anticlimactic. That's what is really going on?

There is also a battle between Smith's Hancock and another character in the middle of Hollywood Boulevard. Okay. Sure. They have to fight somewhere. But what makes less sense is when clouds start to roll in and wind and tornadoes and lightning start to appear. Does this freakish weather have come connection to the battle? If so, it is never explained. Honestly, I felt like the filmmakers wanted to add mayhem to the scene to help cover up any bad CGI work. Let's make everything dark and throw a lot of dust into the picture. That way, if we don't have the best CGI, it will be harder to tell.

But what the film gets right is enough to make it enjoyable. It is fun to watch Hancock interact with Ray and his family, and enjoy this slice of domestic bliss. Because it is a stark contrast to his actual life, filled with animosity directed at him from the public at large. And this is fun to watch as well; because it is behavior is so unlike what we are used to in a super hero.

""Hancock"" is an enjoyable piece of cinematic fluff that will soon be forgotten as soon as ""The Dark Knight"" sweeps into theaters across the country.",1215648000,,8165,4.485195154777927
3112289,3,B0013J55B6,"I saw HANCOCK just a few days ago, and I've already forgotten a lot of it.  It's a big, loud, flashy, glistening piece of Will Smithia.  I remember having a pretty good time watching the film...but I also know that it could have been more.

HANCOCK, in case somehow  you've missed one the 15,000,000 trailers that have played on TV, is a ""superhero"" played by Will  Smith.  He can fly, he can stop moving trains and is impervious to bullets.  Pretty much Superman.  But instead of merrily leading a double life as a ""regular"" human, a la Clark Kent, he is openly his superhero self.  Yet he's also a drunken misanthrope, who mostly tries to stop crime so people on the street will leave him alone to get drunk and sleep on bus stop benches.

A mark of how un-super he is occurs every time he takes off or lands.  He always seem to leave a little crater in the sidewalk or street from the sheer force of his flight.  He might be able to help himself, but doesn't seem to care to.

This is a highly amusing start for the film.  It  plays like a superhero spoof, but not in a heavy-handed way...just as a slight twist on a conventional genre.  There are lots of laughs to be had, and honestly, the best special effects in the film happen in the earliest action sequences.  When Hancock tries to stop criminals leading LAPD on a mad chase on the LA freeways, Hancock isn't satisfied with simply stopping the bad guys.  He has to drop their SUV onto the spire at the top of the historic Capitol Records building.  He also flies INTO street signs rather than around them, and basically causes more property damage than the criminals would  ($9.5 million dollars in one chase, to be exact).  One day, he saves PR-man Justin Bateman from sure death in a train-on-car collision.  The grateful Bateman, surprised at how viciously the crowd turns on  Hancock (who HAS managed to destroy the entire train and quite a few cars as well), offers to remake Hancock's public image.

After some reflection, and after meeting Bateman's family, including wife Charlize Theron...Hancock reluctantly agrees to go along.  One of Bateman's suggestions is the Hancock allow himself to be imprisoned for all the outstanding felonies he's wanted for...certain that a few days in the pen will a)  show the public how much they need this superhero and b) remaking his image as a ""changed"" man.

All this stuff is very funny and even feels original...a feeling you often don't get from a summer film.  Smith has great fun at his own expense...willing to sully his image.  (Of course, we just know Smith would never allow one of his characters to stay so disagreeable!)  Bateman continues to be one of the finest straight-men in the business.  The two have good chemistry.

But lurking in the background is Charlize Theron, whose own character arc is on a collision course with Hancock's...to the great detriment of the film.

When that collision occurs, the entire tone of the film becomes unmoored.  It still has funny bits, but also wants to be bittersweet, ironic, edgy and ultimately it wants to be romantic and moving.  It ends up being annoying...because while I don't mind a movie taking me in an unexpected direction...the new direction needs to be an IMPROVEMENT over the old direction.  In HANCOCK, this is decidedly NOT the case.  So what started as a very good popcorn movie turned into a bit of a mush.

And all this leads to a finale that is shocking only because it is so small.  One thing I expect from my summer blockbusters is to see a slam-bam action fest...to see the special effects stepped up a notch.  Think of the hideous TRANSFORMERS movie...the final battle scene was noisy and impressively scaled.  (It was also confusing.)  I especially expect my superhero movies to end with a big fight scene.  Yet HANCOCK ends with a small scale, brief battle in a hospital.

I just barely recommend this film, because it does feature some fine effects work in the early going, a nice relationship between Smith and Bateman and some truly funny bits early on (including a scene in a prison yard that is one of the funniest and grossest of the year!).  But if you skip this film altogether, you will not find yourself having missed much.",1215648000,2,4220,4.635627530364372
3112290,2,B0013J55B6,"I expected more from Will Smith. He's a Super Star with a lot of clout! He can pick and choose his projects. He brings in the bucks, which is all Hollywood cares about! Then he has the ability pass up  junk, like Hancock!

The only reason I did not give this film one-star  is that the concept of  ""redemption"" is a powerful one. I can even honestly say the first third of Hancock was somewhat entertaining, but it went downhill fast! For lack of a better word, the movie became just plain dull! And it's hard to imagine Will Smith in a boring film!

There are so many glaring holes in the story it became distracting! A good story makes sense within the world the writer has created. When there is absolutely no explanation for major events taking place, an intelligent person will get annoyed! In a nutshell,  that is the definition of sloppy storytelling! See what happens when Hollywood forces it's writers to go on strike! I bet someone exacted revenge by writing such an erratic and dopey  story!

Memo to Hollywood: It's not cool to chop-off  both of a person's hands in a movie geared for children! Is that supposed to be funny? If you think so, then maybe you need the services of a psychiatrist! And when you do cut off a person's hand and wave it around, it relaxes, it does not remain inflexible. I guess whoever wrote the script must think everyone is as dumb as the filmmakers of Hancock!

3112293,4,B0013J55B6,"""Hancock"" takes an interesting twist on your classic ""Superhero"" story.  At the start of the film, instead of an all powerful strongly motivated do-gooder, Will Smith's character, Hancock, is an angry, bitter, disillusioned wreck who really resents being a superhero.  He shows this by saving people and stopping crime is the most destructive ways possible: catching three bad guys while trashing several buildings and freeways in the process; and saving Jason Bateman's Character, Ray Embrey at the cost of damaging several nearby cars and destroying an entire freight train.

Needless to say, our Superhero has an image problem.  Not just the image others have of him, but the image he has of himself.

Into this mess steps the man Hancock just saved: Ray Embrey.

As a marketing professional, Ray has a self-appointed mission to convince major corporations to give away their dearest, most important products in the service of the greater good (in the form of a foundation Ray has established for that purpose).  In modern capitalist America, this message does not go well, and Ray, in many ways, is just as discouraged as Hancock is: no one listens, no one cares.  The difference is, Ray hasn't given up.

As the film progresses, we see Hancock change, as he responds, resentfully at first, to Ray's encouragement and guidance.  Hancock eventually redeems himself in the eyes of the public, and becomes a respected and acclaimed superhero.

While all this goes on, Hancock makes a few arch-enemies: criminals he's caught and/or humiliated over the course of the film.  The last third or so of the film is devoted to their revenge against him.  We also learn at this point that Hancock is not the only one of his kind, as he'd long assumed.

Without giving away critical details, let's just say that Hancock learns not only to accept the love of others, but also learns that love sometimes means he will be faced with situations where he will need to give up all he holds dear, and all he has gained, to save those he loves.

Ultimately, this movie speaks about Sacrificial Love: Hancock and Ray each learn to sacrifice for the love of others, and we learn that Ray's wife (Charlize Theron) has also given sacrificially for her love of both of these men.

""Hancock"" provides good action, humor and an interesting story while addressing some interesting philosophical issues at several different levels.  The story line shares some common themes with Smith's earlier film ""The Pursuit of Happyness"".  More time could have been devoted in the film to expanding on these themes: the film's relatively short run time (92 minutes) is just not enough to give them the treatment they deserve, particularly in the area of the nature of relationship of Charlize Theron's character with both Ray and Hancock.

This is not an Academy Award winner of a film, but it hits the intended target of providing a good story that is more than mindless action.  I give it three and a half - let's call it four stars: well worth seeing in the theatre, and a good film to plug into the DVD for the family to watch some evening at home.",1215388800,,3115,4.819548872180451

3112295,2,B0013J55B6,"Summer releases from Hollywood are generally intended as light entertainment, and they should be viewed in that spirit.  Will Smith has virtually owned the summer release market for several years now, and during that time he's starred in some fun movies.  With just a couple of exceptions, ""Hancock"" breaks that winning streak.  Even keeping in mind that it's just a summer movie doesn't help much.

I don't want to write anything here that will serve as a spoiler for someone planning to see the film.  So let me just say that the movie begins with a wonderfully nonconventional and even campy thesis--a superhero with a bad boy attitude--and within the first 40 minutes utterly--and I mean UTTERLY--drops that concept and moves in a totally different and not as entertaining direction.  It's as if one of the two screenwriters shaved off the ending of his script, the other cut off the beginning of his, and then some mad Dr. Frankenstein (if you see the movie, you'll get the pun) shoved the two pieces together hoping to wind up with a unified whole.  But even Smith's considerable talents couldn't make it work.

That's the not-so-good news.  The better news is that Jason Bateman as Ray the public relations guy who tries to salvage Hancock's reputation really delivers a sterling performance--at least in the first half of the film, before everything begins to unravel.

Will Smith is great as a moody, drunk and vulgar super hero. Oh plus, he gets even more angry if someone calls him an A-Hole. It is obvious that he does mean well since he does show up to save the day. He just does it in a lazy and careless sort of a way where he causes a lot of damage. So he always winds up doing more good than bad. Jason Bateman is also fun and him and Smith play off each other well. He sees good in Hancock and thinks he can make him into a hero that people respect and love. His wife played by Charlize Theron has her doubts though.

  I would have gave Hancock a higher rating, but I think it's more fresh and fun in the beginning and middle than it is in the end. Don't get me wrong, it's still good in the end but it almost turns into something similar to My Super Ex-Girlfriend. Smith does make it worth watching through-out though. The movie isn't big fun like Iron Man but it still has it's laughs and fun moments. It's also fresh to get an anti-superman movie. I mean Hancock is pretty much the total opposite of Superman which is a fun concept. Smith is up for the task but the script really isn't 100% worthy of his performance. If you don't go to see the movie with high hopes you might enjoy it more. Also don't expect a super hero movie that you can bring the whole family to.

So much so that this is one of the few blockbusters I wish had been longer, giving writers Gilligan and Ngo and director Berg more time to explore the backstory and the resonant depths it potentially had. The problem isn't so much that the tone changes, but rather that more isn't made of it. I also wanted to spend more time with these thoroughly likeable characters. As it stands, ""Hancock"" is still a winner. The script is sharp, the direction kinetic, the music and lens work appropriately manic, and the performances fine.

3112300,3,B0013J55B6,"Will Smith returns to the summer movie box office with this offering that entertains but may not appeal to everyone.  Hancock is a man with superhuman abilities---super strength, flight, speed, etc.  The problem is that he is also alcoholic, anti-social and pretty much an all-around jerk.  When he saves a good-hearted soul named Ray (Jason Bateman) from a certain death, he is challenged to change his reputation and become the super hero that Los Angeles desperately needs.

  With Ray's guidance (Ray is a PR specialist), Hancock begins to rehabilitate himself and become the kind of hero that everyone respects.  Its not an easy journey for Hancock but slowly he begins to realize that he can and actually wants to be a man who protects the people.

  ""Hancock"" is a different kind of summer hero movie.  This film is not as well made as ""Iron Man"", which started the summer off with a bang and undoubtedly will not compare favorably to the coming Dark Knight juggernaut.  It is, though, a decent summer action flick that will tide fan boys over until the late Heath Ledger's Joker challenges the Batman to the fate of Gotham City.  The director does a fairly decent job of keeping the movie rolling along although the storyline is a bit patchy.  There are some twists and turns in the film, most of which are pretty predictable---I doubt there will be any plot point shocking enough that will keep people talking at the water cooler on Monday.

  The special effects are really quite good but the story is a bit of a mess.  Hancock at the beginning of the film is thoroughly disgusting and completely unlikable.  The concept of a hero who is not your typical stand-up guy is an interesting take but I think fans of Smith will be surprised at the character's lack of manners, cursing and unacceptable attitude.  I also think most parents will be turned off by the language and bad behavior of the lead character.  I wouldn't recommend the film to kids under the age of 13 due to the language and unnecessary mean-spiritedness that Smith's character displays in the first third of the film, though his transformation does bring out the true hero and good spirit eventually.

  The one stand out for me was Jason Bateman.  He is very often the most humorous part of the film, charming and deserving of the roles he has been landing lately.  I wouldn't have guessed a few years ago that Bateman would have ever returned to Hollywood in any capacity---but a critically successful run in the very funny tv comedy ""Arrested Development"" seems to have put him on track to land some good roles that could give him some decent hits of his own.  I hope we see more of him on the big screen and can imagine him doing well in romantic comedies.

  Overall, ""Hancock"" is worth seeing for a matinee price but if you are jonesing for a hero flick, ""Iron Man"" is a better bet.  Not a bad Will Smith movie but also not his best.",1215216000,3,2916,4.614785992217898

  Without getting into spoiler territory, the first half of the movie succeeds very well at getting the audience to buy into the troubles that Hancock is having and to even start to like him as a character and to care about what happens to him. When the plot twists start coming, though, they come in such rapid succession that even the sturdiest of viewers will find their willing suspension of disbelief not so willing. There are SO many ways that this story could have gone and one has to really wonder what the story was like before its long history of metamorphoses.
  But the end result is, at least for lovers of the superhero genre, very watchable and very entertaining. It is not your run-of-the-mill standard superhero movie by any stretch of the imagination, but it is very fun to watch... as long as you don't think TOO incredibly hard about some of its finer points.

It is so easy to distinguish a digital effect in a film nowadays that for me it just ruins it. Will Smith is not one of my favorite actors and marginal on his performance here. It is increasingly hard to find a decent written movie these days. Hollywood is constantly trying remake's of classic telivision or former movies rather than gamble on a well written screenplay.

I was only mildly disappointed by the story.  What worked well was the set-up and transition from antisocial anti-hero to good-guy superhero (although I would have liked at least one more scene of good-guy Hancock saving the day), plus I liked the idea of the unintended yet disastrous side damages of his early attempts to help people.  The primary problem areas were with the very hazy and shaky back-story about Smith & Theron's characters (much of which I had trouble buying), and with various big gaps in the narrative flow of the present-day events.  I found the final confrontation with the main bad guys to have been too hastily whipped up, and the fight scene itself was too much of a cliched action-movie blur, i.e., somewhat hard to follow exactly what was happening.  (It's a style that's all too common these days...)",1215129600,2,986,4.7368421052631575
3112306,4,B0013J55B6,"You've seen the trailers from ""Hancock"".  If you're like me, you always wonder if you've seen the best of the film.  In this case, no.  The trailers are from the first part of the movie where John Hancock (Will Smith) is having a bit of a PR problem.

Okay, that's the understatement of the year.  He's having a huge PR problem, namely he's so drunk and unpredictable, no one wants him to show up on a crime scene. But, one man, PR specialist Jason Batemen (Ray Embrey) believes in him.  So does his son, Aaron (Jae Head).  His wife, Mary (Charlize Theron) does not.

With Embrey's coaxing, Hancock decides to rehabilitate himself and he voluntarily goes to jail.  Meanwhile, Embrey is working on him.  The Plan:  Crime's so bad in LA the cops will ask for an early release and Hancock's got to be ready--with manners and a new sharper image.

He is.  And he wows them.  He still doesn't wow Mary.  And that's the real story, John Hancock's secret identity.  Go for the CGI at the first and be prepared to be surprised in the second.

WARNING:  If you have migraines, seizures, or like me, get dizzy, ""Hancock"" has some scenes you may want to avoid.

3112307,5,B0013J55B6,"This is the best of the summer action movies by far. Why? Will Smith, for one thing. But it's also an extremely clever not-too-obvious political satire.
What (not who, although people might try to go there) really is Hancock? Think about it:
- The Name
- Eagle symbol
- Abuses but then saves annoying French kid
- Tries to save the world but trashes things in the interim, so gets no thanks or credit
- Trashed by the media (especially Nancy Grace)",1215043200,10,448,4.475609756097561
3112308,4,B0013J55B6,"Peter Berg's ""Hancock"" puts a refreshing new spin on the superhero genre by keeping a majority of the conflict within. The title character fights his share of bad guys, but it's his own struggle for identity that takes center stage, a struggle that would be relatable were it not for his super-strength powers. As a man who can't remember his real name or even where he came from, Hancock may actually be worse off than Bruce Wayne; despite emotional scarring from a painful past, at least he's always known who he is. Hancock has been given powers without knowing why, and because of that, he has no idea how to use them. He's the superhero no one wants to be saved by, a lonely, miserable, self-destructive man who can't get along with anyone. As the film progresses, we wait for that climactic moment when this character is finally given the chance to redeem himself.

As interesting as this character is, ""Hancock"" is not everything it could have been. This is mostly due to a gigantic plot twist that I wouldn't dream of describing, not even in vague terms. All I can say is that it's outlandish, implausible, and underdeveloped, not what one would expect from a small scale, character driven superhero film. Strangely enough, it feels the most like a comic book when the secret is revealed, which would have been fine if the entire film had gone in the same direction. But it didn't; ""Hancock"" starts off subtly by satirizing the very concept of superheroes, from the way the act to how they look to why they're compelled to save the day in the first place. The film opens with a high-speed chase on a Los Angeles highway, one that involves heavy gunfire. Hancock (Will Smith) doesn't know what's going on because he's passed out on a sidewalk bench, drunk as a skunk; a boy no older than six has to wake him up and tell him that the bad guys are getting away.

We quickly learn that, while Hancock has stopped a fair number of violent criminals, he still does a lot more harm than good. Whenever he flies, his takeoffs and landings leave gaping holes in the concrete. He damages buildings and destroys cars. He's provoked far too easily, especially when he's being called a specific dirty name. He drinks far too much. He's antisocial, apathetic, and angry, not helped by the fact that no one praises him for the lowered crime rate. Then he saves the life of Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), a down-on-his-luck public relations professional; to show his gratitude, he decides to help Hancock reestablish his image. The first step is responding to an outstanding arrest warrant and actually spending time in jail. Ray believes this will give the impression that Hancock is willing to improve. He also believes that, since the crime rate will increase, Hancock will be released much earlier than usual.

I won't get into the specifics of how long Hancock stays in jail and what happens in that time, but rest assured that he's eventually released and given a second chance. As he desperately tries to make sense of himself, Hancock gets closer to Ray and his family. The young son, Aaron (Jae Head), almost treats Hancock like his best friend, always so excited around him, always wanting to share toys and talk about trivial things. The wife, Mary (Charlize Theron), is always suspicious around Hancock; she's distant, cold, and short-winded whenever he's near her. I won't say whether or not there's a reason for this, but I will say that by the time everything is explained, we're left with more questions than answers.

That's about as much of the plot I can describe without spoiling anything. The best I can say at this point is to go see the film and find out what I couldn't describe. ""Hancock"" is worth seeing, even if the plot strays from itself a few too many times. There's a moment when the city is attacked by freak weather (which includes snow and multiple tornadoes), and I couldn't help but believe it was only for the sake of showing cool visual effects. I suppose that could be interpreted as satire, since visual effects are the very heart and soul of the average superhero film. The thing is, ""Hancock"" is not average--it brings something original to the genre, something modern and lively and (to some extent) realistic. When you get your first look at Hancock, you see not a sterile do-gooder like Superman but a filthy vagrant, with all the sadness in the world swimming in his bloodshot eyes. He's just plain pathetic.

While Ray's goal is for Hancock to make peace with the public, the film's goal is for Hancock to make peace with himself. Even after tossing a young French bully hundreds of feet into the air and catching him just before he hits the ground, we sense that Hancock is more misunderstood than anything else. He's deeply flawed, but that doesn't mean he's unwilling to change. If the plot of ""Hancock"" were at the same developmental level as the main character, it would be one of the decade's most thought provoking superhero films, right up there with this year's ""Iron Man."" Unfortunately, it isn't; it loses itself to a crafty plot twist, and the explanations that go along with it are impossible to accept. Nevertheless, the inner struggle of the title character made this movie worthwhile, as did the special effects and the satirical manipulation of the superhero genre.",1214956800,26,5318,4.732470334412082

3112310,4,B0013J55B6,"I really enjoyed the first half of the Hancock, when he had a bad attitude and some great lines. The film progressed into a typical superhero movie that was still fun, but lacked anything original. I'm not the biggest Will Smith fan, though I think he was the only actor for this role and it is one of my favorite Will Smith characters yet. Charlize Theron was cast to look good and she does, while Jason Bateman provides good and often funny support to Smith's Hancock. The CGI is very good throughout and there is even a couple of twists thrown in that might catch you off guard.

Hancock is a good summer flick that isn't in the same league as Iron Man or the greatness that will likely be The Dark Knight, but it is exactly what you would expect from Will ""Summer Blockbuster"" Smith.

3112311,3,B0013J55B6,"Filthy, unshaven, drunk and vulgar, Hancock is the absolute opposite of the typical superhero. The idea is singularly spectacular, but it only carries the film during the first half - the remaining plot twists create more questions and resolve fewer answers, until the audience is fuming with aggravation. Worthy amounts of comedy save the film from total nonsense, but for all the unique ideas surrounding Hancock, it seems inevitable midway that not everything will piece together smoothly.

John Hancock (Will Smith) is a bum, waking up in his own filth on a bench in the street, unkempt, bedraggled, crude, mannerless and cynical. He is also a superhero. Suffering from amnesia, Hancock follows an undiscovered calling within himself that finds the crass demigod continually saving the lives of various people in his hometown of Los Angeles. But his services come with a hefty price tag, as he uncaringly and accidentally destroys millions of dollars worth of property in the process of stopping armed madmen - leading to great disdain from the very humans he rescues.

In walks Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), a PR guy with no luck trying to sell his revolutionary yet profitless ideas to major moneymaking corporations. When his life is saved by the destructive Hancock, he sees the strong resentment the public administers. Realizing the loneliness and confusion resonating in the unappreciated superhero, Ray offers his services to help redefine Hancock's less-than-perfect public image. Involving a new look, a new outfit, vocal coaching, and a short prison sentence, Hancock appears to be back on the right track to fulfilling his destiny as a savior of the world - until Ray's mysterious wife Mary (Charlize Theron) reveals some startling clues to Hancock's past.

It takes a regular human being to teach a superhero to be super. This is essentially the driving force in the film, and it could have been truly impressive. A perfect spin on the paradigmatic superhero maxim, the plot allows for plenty of comedy, action and even romance. But director Peter Berg decides to keep the audience in the dark for just long enough - until wits are at an end and viewers find themselves fidgeting in their seats. When the answers don't come frequently enough and the questions continue to stockpile, it's obvious that the movie isn't prepared to solve the many problems being heaped onto Hancock's story.

Humor is the driving force behind Hancock's design, and we are magnificently treated to plenteous amounts of sarcasm and coarse antics that yield continual laughs. The main character provides comedy along with nearly all of the supporting players, which presents an unprecedented approach to a superhero film. And while the hilariousness of each new situation rarely subsides, the story can't survive on wittiness alone. Rarely is a beat skipped when it comes to the laughs, but by the halfway point, they cease to push the story forward.

Obtaining the July 4th weekend, Hancock is sure to bring in tons of money - plus the star power of Will Smith has recently always ensured success. The only superhero movie in quite some time not based on a graphic novel, the originality of the film entertains to a point; but the lack of real solutions for an outlandish superhero tale prevents the film from being as extraordinary as Hancock himself.

3346051,4,B0013J55B6,"Sometimes you're worse off with the cure. Take Los Angeles, for instance, which boasts its own superhero. But this superhero is a misanthrope - a rude cuss, a woman-groper, and an everyday boozer. He dresses like homeless and saves lives like he's playing that Whack-the-Gopher game. In his crimefighting methods, he's not very careful or that sensitive to stuff around him. His disastrous heroics tend to cost the city millions of dollars in collateral damage, not to mention further endangering the Los Angelinos. No wonder then that Hancock isn't much appreciated. The kids don't even look up to this guy.

Hancock is an impenetrable jerk. He acts like he doesn't care much about anything (yet he keeps on saving lives, so we all know he actually does give a fig, somewhere deep inside). Things change for him when he saves a man, Ray Embrey, from death by train. Turns out Ray is a down-and-out publicity agent. To repay Hancock, he offers to revamp his public image. Surprisingly, Hancock takes him up on it.

I think we've all seen the trailers by now to know that, as part of his image rehabilitation, Hancock is convinced by Ray to turn himself in, when a warrant is issued for his arrest (based on Hancock's misconducts during his heroics). The thinking is that, with Hancock incarcerated, the crime rate will shoot up and then it's only a matter of time before the call goes out for Hancock to resume his thing. This happens, and Hancock emerges from prison a more polite, more couth superhero, clad in sleek leather threads, and cognizant of property values.

But that's only half the story. HANCOCK started out pretty much to form, raucous and punching holes in the superhero mythos. I had an amazingly good time during the first half of the film. But then things took a turn for the serious, as the film begins delving into existential stuff, as Hancock goes thru whatever one goes thru when there's only one of his kind. There's quite a bit more to John Hancock, so much more that the movie doesn't even really get into it. There's an explanation for his origin, and what an ambitious origin it is, too. His past history, we learn, is glorious and tragic and spans much longer than you'd think. There's a romance for Hancock, but it's one soaked in tragic underpinnings. The film's second half will make or break it for the moviegoers, as it goes very much against convention, strays off the safe path and onto a messier one.

I do like that HANCOCK doesn't go for the easy. As mentioned, I really enjoyed the first half, when it was all light and comic. When things took a darker turn, it startled me. Then I got curious as to where the picture would take me. Will Smith is truly one of the most bankable movie stars around, and I'll always watch whatever film he's in. HANCOCK offers up a Will Smith that we're not used to. This guy on screen is grumpy and mean and a hard drinker. Yet I liked John Hancock from the get-go, perhaps because this film was touted as a comedy (and I guess being grumpy and mean is allowed if in a comedic venue) and, more definitely, because it's Will Smith. But Smith can also act. I think that's been proven without a doubt. So he adds that extra layer of realism to his preposterous character. The other two leads are good, as well. Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron (who plays his wife) are very much key to driving the plot. And I defy you to not have your heart go out to Jason's character, who's truly a good guy at heart.

There are no mega-villains in HANCOCK (In fact, the main villain, if you can call him that, is a little weak). Surprisingly, the special effects aren't about to bowl anyone over (but they're not bad), and there's not as much superhero action as you'd like. There's much comedy gold in the first half (yes, including that initial prison scene as the inmates challenge Hancock), and lots of drama and angst and heartache in the second half. The film earns all of its PG-13 rating. I laughed myself silly in some places, and wondered about a lot of the stuff director Peter Berg and the writers were attempting. And, when all's said and done, I ended up liking the film. But it's up in the air whether you will.",1214956800,14,4185,4.552456839309429
3346052,4,B0013J55B6,"Hancock (Will Smith) is not your garden variety superhero.  Let's just say that his crime fighting tactics usually involve booze, obscenities, and millions of dollars in property damage.  That all changes one day when Hancock saves the life of a publicist named Ray (Jason Bateman).  Ray wants to help Hancock change his image in exchange for Hancock's saving his life.  The reluctant superhero adheres to Ray's advice to become reformed.  He spends time in jail, and upon his release he is a ""true"" superhero ready to fight crime, booze free.

""Hancock"" is really the only one of its kind.  A refreshing change from comic book based movies and it definitely provides plenty of competition.  The film has enough comedy, plot twists and action to keep you on the edge of your seat.  Will Smith once again proves why he is one of the best actors right now.  He does an incredible job showing character development, from boozing loser with a bad attitude to outstanding hero in the spotlight.

3346054,4,B0013J55B6,"I have seen the commercials for ""Hancock"" so many times that I was definitely afraid that this was going to be one of those movies where all of the good stuff is already in the trailer.  Then when I went to see it tonight (having midnight shows at 7 and 8 is an odd way of doing it) and there were only three dozen people in the theater I was wondering if maybe Will Smith's reputation as Mr. Fourth of July (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Independence-Day/dp/B00005V9IK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Independence Day</a>,"" ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Men-in-Black/dp/B0000640SB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Men in Black</a>,"" etc.) when it comes to opening movies was going to take a big hit.  However, I think that is not going to happen because those trailers for ""Hancock"" that we have seen over and over again show scenes that all take place in the first half of the movie.  You have seen the trailers for this movie and you know the set up, but you are never going to guess what this movie is really about.  I liked the change in direction, but that might not be the case with everybody; but until reviewers, friends, or new trailers ruin things I have to think you will be surprised.

I was trying to think of the last time I saw a movie that surprised me this much when I found out when it was really about.  It would have to be ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Village/dp/B00064LJVE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Village</a>,"" where Joaquin Phoenix is on the cover of ""Entertainment Weekly"" and then I am watching the movie and thinking that it really should be about Bryce Dallas Howard's character and, viola, that is what happened.  But what happens with ""Hancock"" is not like that, so do not worry they are going the ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Executive-Decision/dp/0790731894/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Executive Decision</a>"" route where the star gets killed in Act I.  With ""Hancock"" surprise is what happens in Acts II and III.  Of course, I want you to be surprised too so there is not much more I can say, because even telling you that there is a surprise is not going to stop you from being surprised (I picked up on what, in retrospect, would have been a clue but I certainly did not read it that way when it went by).  Connecting the dots at the end becomes a bit problematic and director Peter Berg had me flashing back to ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cloverfield/dp/B0014Z4OQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cloverfield</a>"" for a moment when he circled the camera around the title character over and over again at one point, but on balance the movie definitely provided more than the previews promised (although I wish Hancock had put off turning over a new leaf until after he dealt with Nancy Grace).

I also liked the fact that this superhero movie ends up being one of the more adult ones of recent vintage; you have the media totalling up how much damage he does each day and a superhero who drinks, curses, and more(although the reaction shots of the cons reacting to what happens when Hancock does what he keeps threateing to do is way funnier than when we actually get to see it).  Parents dragging their kids expecting to see another funny and charming Will Smith are going to be taken aback a bit when he starts swearing, and I mean serious he-would-never-do-this-in-a-rap-record type swearing.  However, he does it because there is a point where he stops and a point to that point.  More importantly, Hancock is not a comic book superhero of the DC and Marvel variety because when he goes after bad guys who are killing people, he has no compunction about tossing them out a window with no intention of catching them.  Time and time again I have been disappointed by the big fights to the finish at the end of the movie (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spider-Man-2/dp/B00005JMQW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spider-Man 2</a>"" would be my standard of how it should be done), but ""Hancock"" ends up with an above average big fight at the end.  Final note:  You have to stay in your seat for a little bit at the start of the end credits because the bonus scene happens early on (to set up the Will Smith credit).  So do not worry about staying the whole way through and do not get caught in the aisles stopped to watch the bonus scene).  You have been warned.",1214870400,6,4532,5.243430152143845

This was a fun film but due to the fact that Hancock was antisocial at first and basically a God he didn't have the strong family support that Steel, Blankman and Meteor Man had. That family support made those characters seem more realistic and grounded in African American culture. Nevertheless, this is an enjoyable film. Smith fans will love it. Fans of this film may also enjoy Meteor Man!",1517875200,,775,4.664233576642336

3346085,3,B0013J55B6,To really understand the reviews for this movie you need to see it.  Will Smith plays Hancock a super hero who has flaws.  Mostly like wanting to be left alone so he can drink.  When he does good like saving people.  He causes a lot of collateral damage and the public wonders if he is really worth the trouble.  So he saves one man's life.  Who happens to think he could use an image make over.  The man's wife is the always beautiful Charlize Theron who just happens to know more about the real Hancock.  This is a good ction super hero movie with good performances from everybody.,1492992000,,583,4.333333333333333

3346105,5,B0013J55B6,"I for one love Handcock. To me this is a great story that shows that no matter how powerful you are if you don't know who you are you cant be happy. Handcock is a Superhero who knows that he wants to do good but cant understand why, he doesnt understand that is why he was made. So he does the work but cant find any kind of fulfillment because he doesnt know who he is and this leaves him empty and he is unable to find any joy in what he does so his heart is not in his work. Hes a man who saves everyone and is cared for by no one. Thats is where Ray comes in. He sees past the man and to the heart and sets out to do all he can to help. And that is what makes this a great move to me, it shows how we all need an identity in this world not just something that is given to us but something that we make our own, and that we need other in our lives who will help us.",1485475200,4,868,3.622340425531915

3346240,4,B0013J55B6,"Hancock is an abnormal superhero who is depicted as a homeless, alcoholic, depressed man. Who tries to help as much he can, but due to his problems he only seems to make things work. In the beginning of the movie it appears that a robbery has taken place and there is now a shootout on the freeway. Hancock feels obligated to help but ends up taking out a highway sign, destroying a section of the highway, and damaging a building with a total cost of 9 million dollars. This characteristic of Hancock was used to start off a radical change from within ones self, and to show that even though he is a super-human we tend to focus more on the super and forget about the human.
 As this movie was made in the mid 2000s (2008) and America was in the midst of a great recession, where many people and soldiers were becoming homeless due to the Housing Bubble popping. The movie forces us to watch how we treat our heroes, super or otherwise. Although Hancock starts out as a drunken, stumbling nuisance, but in reality he is actually a man who just wants to be loved. He feels alone, afraid, ostracized by the public. He urns for the public to love him, and pushes them away to protect his inner insecure self. However, once he starts teaming up with Ray Embrey, a man whose mission is to bring peace and prosperity to the world. Through Hancock he can make that dream happen, as well as nurture and help this broken man.
 Embrey, is supposed to represent the change America needs, whereas the rest of the world represents the current America consensus on the homeless and the poor. They only see the exterior of these people, the dirty clothes, the foul breathe, the rude demeanor. When in reality, under all of that is a scared person, who had dreams, fears, responsibilities, and possibly a family, just like them. Will Smith helped produced this to get that message out to the public who was too blind to see.
 Another thing I noticed that the society within this movie is how they are very invertebrate when it comes to a stance on certain topics. For example, When Hancock is trying to help the citizens from the dangers of everyday life. They ridicule him, and take him for granted because they feel they can. However, once he appeases the public and goes to jail to serve for his crimes, they quickly have a change of heart as they see what he truly was doing for them. He may have been ineffective in stopping crimes safely, he was still their shield. He was a deterrent to crime, and once you take that away you realize how unsafe you are. This can be seen as another parallel to the treatment of returning veterans. Although we take them for granted as we see them homeless sleeping on the bench. We forget what they did for us. Imagine if they didn't serve to protect us, where we might be. Maybe the war would be a lot closer to home, than it was. The underappreciated veterans put their lives on the line to protect and serve, and now they are treated like scum. How can this be acceptable in todays society? This is what the movie tries to address.
 Hancock is a social drama that depicts the lifestyle of a veteran, and other citizens in an entertaining setting so that it will reach a wide variety of audiences. Now although this movie is allowed for young kids. In actuality people around the age group of 18-30 who are middle class will understand the meaning behind the film. This movie on top of having an amazing message on the social structure of society, it also is an extremely entertaining movie, with a heartfelt story of a man who just wants to belong to something; And in the end everything works out. Embrey helps the world, while Hancock finds his place in the world and becomes loved by the public like he wanted.
4 out of 5 stars would see again.",1446595200,,3775,4.4508670520231215
3346241,4,B0013J55B6,"The movie Hancock has appropriately demonstrated the old phrase in our modern society: with great power comes great responsibility. Hancock has all the superpower that anyone can strive for. He is bulletproof, has super-strength, and can fly. Even with these great abilities, Hancock is not appreciated by the citizens of Los Angeles due to his severe alcoholism and carelessness. Beyond the plot of the story, the background music (below stated as BGM) aids not only to create the mood of his ineptness before he meets his mentor Ray but also to create the suspense whenever he is on a heroic scene. In addition to the sound effects, visual aids such as Hancocks outfit clearly shows the transition of his image from a homeless drunk to a praise-worthy superhero.
 The movie starts with Hancock waking up in an old ghetto neighborhood. He wakes up from a bench with his hobo-looking outfit and a box of liquor underneath him, which shows that he has a drinking problem. Then, the boy who woke up Hancock tells him that there are criminals getting chased by police on the highway. After, seeing the situation on the TV, Hancock blasts himself off and flies to the highway, while destroying the road, bench and a fire hydrant during the process. Not only that but also in the beginning of the movie, when he faces the Asian criminals, he flies off with them on the truck and damages the citys buildings. At the end of that scene, Hancock sticks the truck on top of the famous Capitol Records Building as if were dunk-shooting. The background music that was used in this scene is a song called Move B*tch, written by Lil Jon, which is a hip-hop genre music that aids to create the sense of Hancocks clumsiness. The song reminds the viewers of old ghetto hood, which Hancock usually stays. Although, Hancock has saved a lot of people and helped to lower the crime rates in Los Angeles, he is not appreciated by the citizens of LA since he causes a lot of damages in the city, leading to higher taxes. Due to this, Hancock always feels lonely and alcohol is the only company he has all the time, and the scene where a slow, sad music depicts his loneliness as he drinks alone in the bar.
 One day, Hancock saves Rays life from an oncoming freight train. Hancock still gets jeered because he derailed the train and damaged many cars while saving Ray. But then, Ray steps in thanks Hancock in front of everyone for saving his life and asks Hancock to have dinner with him. Hancock then visits Ray more often, which shows that he is feeling kindness in such a long time or for the first time and he wants more of it. Ray believes that Hancock deserves to have a good image for the public as a superhero so he comes with a plan and makes Hancock to go to the jail to pay up all the lawsuits and court subpoenas that he has been ignoring. This scene is the introduction of Hancocks mentor, Ray that changes Hancocks life entirely and the BGM aids to give a sense of starting something new. The BGM has the gospel theme melodies that tells the viewers that something good is to about to emerge.
 At the jail, Hancock sees a lot of criminals that were sent there because of him. When Hancock was on his way to his cell, two of the criminals blocks his way. Hancock clearly tells them to move because he wants to stay quiet and do his time in the jail but they didn't move. Then, Hancock sticks up one guys head inside the other guys anus. This scene was funny for me but knowing that this movie is rated PG-13, it seemed inappropriate for its rating. Not only this scene but also the use of words such as a**hole or the f-word seemed inappropriate. I get that this movie is a superhero movie and to make a good amount of profit the production company needs to set it as PG-13 as it is the sweet-money spot general viewers of heroic movies are usually kids at younger age but in my personal opinion, I would think that the movie would have been better if the movie depicted more of Hancock being just a co*k.
 When in jail, Hancock gets released early by the request of the chief of LAPD. A group of bank robbers were holding hostages wrapped around with bombs but the police could not go near them since the robbers threatened to blow them if they get closer and that is why Hancock was needed. So then, Hancock makes his intro to the crime scene by flying around the buildings in stealth-speed and in that scene, the BGM with loud trumpet sounds make his intro very dramatic and heroic unlike his past appearances in the movie. In addition, Hancock is wearing his new hero outfit for the first time that was given by Ray while Hancock was in jail. Hancocks new leather jacket outfit and fancy sunglasses show that he has become a professional hero unlike his past as a homeless looking clumsy superpower monster.
  Overall, the movie showed another dimension of the heroic-movie world that all heroes aren't perfect and they do not have to wear a cape or have a funny outfit to look special. Aside from that, the BGM and the appearance of characters did a splendid job to help the viewers understand the plot and to get into the movie. I rate 8 stars out of 10 for this movie.",1446508800,,5166,4.472958642629904

3346322,4,B0013J55B6,"As good as any ""superhero"" movie - honestly I enjoyed the hell out of it, but mostly because Smith truly made the anti-hero thing work so well as he graduated into actual hero throughout. Recommend nothing less than the unrated version though...if you watch anything else you unfortunately miss a couple of the BEST gags in the whole flick! Nevertheless, worth the money to add to any collection and SO worth the watch. Both dramatically riveting and hysterical all at once.

At this point, Bateman was still basically cutting his teeth in the larger market movies but still playing 2nd fiddle. However, he shows his acting shops all throughout ""Hancock"" and proves yet again he was ready to be the *HMFIC*!! He has some of the best expressions and delivery combinations that sometimes I can't even believe it's actually Jason Bateman. Overall, if you happen to like anything even remotely hero related, or Will Smith / Jason Bateman / Charlize Theron related, you are truly missing something good if you haven't yet seen ""Hancock"".",1424995200,,1032,4.931034482758621

The acting is still excellent, the timing and wit perfect, and the lessons still apply. ( I particularly appreciate the much ignored lesson of how evil seems to always seek out goodness to destroy it for no other other reason than for the sake of not letting anyone rise above 'the norm'). In my mind, this is and will continue to stand the test of time.  Let's hope Will Smith chooses to produce more movies.",1423785600,,562,4.283018867924528

3346331,4,B0013J55B6,"Alcoholic superhero John Hancock (Will Smith) is Los Angeless champion. The only problem is as much as the city needs him, he causes so much damage when fighting crime and rescuing others that the city also wishes they were without him. Enter Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), a PR guy whos just been turned down again after pitching his All Heart logo to different charitable organizations. When Hancock saves Embrey from an oncoming train, Embrey offers to restore Hancocks image to the public while also giving a nice boost to his own career. When Hancock meets Embreys wife, Mary (Charlize Theron), he soon discovers that him and her have a forgotten past, one thats already altered their future and will do so again unless history repeats itself.

Wow. This is a cool movie and a take on superheroes thats unique. Though an alcoholic superhero is nothing new (Tony Stark aka Iron Man is a drunk), making a guy whos like Superman an alcoholic is, and seeing the ramifications of that play out is something this superhero fan was excited to see. Not only that, but you got to see what an inebriated superhero looks like as he uses his abilities. The haphazard way Hancock flies shows one of the dangers of such raw power if its not under restraint.

The mythology brought forth in this tale is well done and turns the superhero notion on its head, bringing in the idea of a race of immortals that had once taken the place as gods or angels throughout history. The fact that these superhumans were created in pairs, and that if they chose to stay together they would live a normal life as normal humans and later die, added a level of tragedy to this film that was welcome though tugged at the heartstrings. Sort of that idea of what would you give up for the one you love? And in this case superpowers if you chose to be with them. It also seems that these super pairs have a genuine love for each other so to forego that is a great sacrifice indeed and was something exemplified in this flick.

Never thought Id want to see Will Smith as a superhero. Still have memories of him as the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air running through my head, but the reality is Will Smith is an incredibly talented actor and while he has used his default funny guy now and then, hes pulled off loads of roles where Fresh Prince is but a faint memory and him as John Hancock in this flick is one of those roles. While I personally prefer actors whove portrayed superheroes to only be that one superhero and not take on others, if you put Will in the upcoming Justice League movie as Cyborg, for example, I wouldnt complain and would certainly look forward to it.

Charlize TheronIm a fan. Given the complexity of the Hancock storynamely where Therons character is concernedI really felt bad for her for what shed given up. She also did a good job of holding her own against Will Smith, whos a pretty domineering actor in any scene.

Jason Bateman is, well, Jason Bateman, but I like him so having him along for this super ride was super fine by me.

Hancock is an awesome superhero movie that gives a fresh take on the genre as it doesnt follow the traditional formula. Maybe in the sequel, if they ever make one. I hope they do as Id like to see where the characters and the mythology go from here.

3346335,2,B0013J55B6,"Maybe 2.5 stars. A classic example of a clever and potentially interesting premise -- an alcoholic, sociopathic super-antihero -- scuttled by poor execution. The writing, the directing (by the wildly erratic Peter Berg), the editing and the art direction all manage to conspire to make a mess that starts out wanting to be satire but soon changes streams and wants to be taken very, very, very seriously. Since we never really get to know Hancock or his sort-of-nemesis played by Charlize Theron, all the stuff between them in the 2nd half is hard to take seriously or get very involved in. It's emotionally muddled at best, matched by oddly dark, murky, you-gotta-squint-a-lot art direction. It's one of those movies that feels like two half-movies glued together, neither of which is anywhere near complete.",1421971200,,809,5.090225563909774

3346403,3,B0013J55B6,"After viewing Hancock for the first time, I was initially very impressed and entertained.  After the first half of the film though, I swear that a high school composition student took over the plot.  So let's break it down with my short review of Hancock.

The first half:  Redemption and Entertainment!
I absolutely loved the first half of this movie.  The two main characters are setup so well and you actually care about them.  It felt like this could actually be a real situation.  You love watching Hancock be an alcoholic, inept, socially awkward, superhero and you want him to be better.  Will Smith does a great job with this character.  He is pathetic, yet likable.  You feel Hancock's plight. You pity him.  Ray is your every man that the viewer can relate to.  He's trying to make it in the world and wants to help Hancock fix his image in the city, who has saved his life.  Hancock changes quickly from alcoholic to decent superhero when he voluntarily goes to prison to serve his time for all the collateral damage he inflicts on the city.  I wish the entire movie would have been about Hancock's redemption and recovery.  At the end of the first half, he saves the people from some bank robbing evil guys in a heroic fashion.  Heck, just watch the movie until here and turn it off.  I'm actually content with this.

The Second Half: Stupid Plot Conveniences
The second half of the film is a train wreck of stupidity.  Everything written in it is just for either a) fighting, b) plot convenience.  So Hancock learns that Ray's wife Mary, who by this time just complains about Hancock and stares creepily at him, is also a super hero who knows about Hancock's forgotten past.  Who cares?!  The plot so far has been the redemption of Hancock and the success of Ray.  Why do we care she is a super hero?  We care about Hancock and Ray, not this woman.  We also don't care about Hancock's past, we want his future to be better.  So anyway, this is where the plot stumbles along in the most elementary way possible.  We learn the rules of how superheros are made, something about how Hancock and Mary have some rules about how they have to be close together or apart or something to be superheros.  It just feels like this crap is made up as they go along to move the plot forward.  Then the dumbest thing in the whole movie happens.  Mary and Hancock go way out of town to talk and Mary claims she can't reveal the truth to Hancock about his past.  This pisses off Hancock and he flies back to the city to tell Ray Mary's secret about being a superhero.  Mary chases him and they have a superhero fight in the city, destroying large parts of the city and endangering thousands of people.  During this fight, Mary starts revealing the past.  Uh, ok?  The decision of these two to behave this way is stupid.  The only reason it was done is because they wanted two super heroes to fight.  Apparently they are husband and wife........ok?  Who cares?  So Hancock gets shot, Mary gets shot (who cares?) and Hancock gets away and makes them both stronger based on the arbitrary rules the writers wrote while they were drunk.  The point is, no one cares.

Anyway, the final verdict is 3 stars.  Here is why.  The first half is great.  This should have been the whole movie.  We want to see Hancock continue to improve, then encounter another obstacle which will challenge him to not slip back into alcoholism, and save the day.  The entire story was setup well for the relationship between Hancock and the city of Los Angeles and Ray's efforts to improve that relationship.  The second half of the movie just threw it all out the window.  Incredibly poor writing.

How to fix it?  I would have liked to seen Ray be a single dad who has lost his wife because he couldn't save her because he wasn't strong enough and failed.  So maybe he could save Hancock.  That would be great.  So as the plot goes on, Hancock gets closer and closer to Ray's son.  So eventually Hancock fails or relapses in his alcoholism after being insulted again after being a successful superhero for a while.  For some reason Ray's son gets in a ton of trouble and is close to doom.  Hancock then selflessly sacrifices himself to save Ray's son, completing the redemption of Hancock and fulfilling the demons in Ray that he couldn't save his wife, but this time he DID save his son by saving Hancock.

But what do I know?  I'm not a Hollywood writer.  I can only point out stupid plot holes.",1404000000,,4465,4.481343283582089

3346424,1,B0013J55B6,"I really wanted to like this movie. I like all the actors. I like the concept. This movie had a lot of potential, but for me it turned out to be a huge disappointment.

The tone of this movie shifts back and forth so much, it's like the movie can't decide what it wants to be. Sometimes it's a comedy, sometimes it's a drama, sometimes it's an action movie... But it never does any of these things very well.

Take the comedy aspects. It can be funny at times. But a joke is only funny the first time. When it keeps getting repeated, it's not so funny anymore. This movie takes the same couple of jokes and just beats them into the ground.

- Superhero who destroys stuff in the process? Funny! So let's show him do it every single time he does anything. Not so funny...

- A kid calling him an A------ and he gets mad? Funny! So let's have someone call him an A------ every 5 seconds throughout the movie. Not so funny...

The ""comedy"" here is taken to it's extreme when Hancock literally shoves a man's head up another man's butt, while ""Sanford and Son"" music plays in the background. Wow. HILARIOUS. This is the point at which the movie totally went off the rails for me, and I couldn't watch anymore. I skimmed through the rest of it, just so I could see how it ended. Thankfully, it did end.

Okay, so it's not a good comedy. So how about a drama then? This movie does have some dramatic elements to it that are interesting. But it's hard to take them seriously when the next shot involves the aforementioned head being shoved up a butt. Not to mention that that is completely unbelievable. If it were even possible, those people would be seriously injured, maybe even killed by internal bleeding. But Hancock just plays it for laughs.

Another totally unbelievable part of the movie which really hurt its dramatic credibility is everyone constantly calling Hancock an A------. This is a man with superpowers. If he really is such a jerk (as we are repeatedly told), then would ANYONE want to mess with him? I don't think so. He may be lonely yes, but no one in their right mind would cross him. That's another part where the movie just refuses to be realistic in any way in favor of a cheap laugh. Which would be okay, if it were actually funny. Which it isn't.

So is it an action movie then? If so, it's the worst superhero action movie ever. It has no villains to speak of. Just a superhero working on his public image (and why does he care about that again?). And then there's a whole romantic subplot dominating the second half of the movie, which I skimmed over due to disgust (over the butt scene), boredom, and general non-interest.

One other thing. As soon as I put this movie in, my first thought was, ""Oh so it's one of THOSE movies."" The shaky-camera kind. Don't you just love it when directors substitute actual action with shaking the camera around? I mean, why have the people being filmed actually DO anything when you can just shake the camera around a lot and pretend like something is happening!

So in conclusion, I thought this movie stunk. It had a few funny scenes, but the rest of it was tedious and stupid. I like Will Smith, but this was a total waste of his talent.

I do wish they would make a Hancock 2 and try to make a coherent movie the next time around.. That would probably be the one time that a sequel does better than the original.

3346435,3,B0013J55B6,"Hancock is one of those movies that everyone sort of likes, but never wants to rewatch if it sits within easy reach on a shelf.  It's overlooked more often than not.  On one side, that's a bit of a shame since the script alone is something worth mentioning, but on the other side there's no great loss.

It personifies the anti-hero in the flesh.  He can fly, has super strength, and he's damage proof, basically a Superman without the cloak and fancy laser/x-ray vision and ice breath.  Will Smith plays John Hancock, a more-than-often drunk who has an affinity for helping save lives but can't seem to get the technique down.  As a result, he often causes extensive damage to public and private property.  One day, he saves a struggling Public Relations man who wants nothing more than to change the world.  As a thank you he dissuades a crowd of people from arguing with Hancock's techniques and invites him over for dinner.  There Hancock meets the man's family and is offered some free consultation to allow Hancock to become more of a public figure instead of a public nuisance.

The story, however, is a bit tilted.  At first you think this is going to be a movie about Hancock becoming more of a hero than a threat, but it unfolds that Hancock doesn't really know who he is or where he came from, hence his ambiguous name.  The information is, almost literally, dropped into his lap and there's almost no satisfaction in garnering it for the audience since it was never really a high point of the movie.  The saving grace of this somewhat mediocre storyline is the script and Will Smith's acting.  He plays the perfect sarcastic, socially inept anti-hero.  The script is well put together, if nothing else.

It's worth a watch on, perhaps, Netflix or for a cheap price, but don't expect it to be pulled off the shelves of your movie collection often.",1379548800,4,1858,4.6189024390243905

3346442,3,B0013J55B6,"Hancock is a bit of a mixed-blessing.  It starts out as a great take on a superhero as well as a good character study.  However, once the second half of the film starts it kind of becomes a convoluted mess.  I do not hate the second half of the film, but it does not live up to what was setup in the first half.

It starts off with the main character, Hancock (Will Smith), stopping criminals like a traditional superhero would.  However, society condemns Hancock and his actions and reject despite trying to help.  However, Hancock is not a saint either at first.  He is a drunk and quite eccentric.  He also lashes back at the people saying he does not care about them, even though he really does.

I personally find this refreshing.  The idea of society rejecting superheroes is nothing new.  However, Hancock himself is a depiction of a superhero that I do not see that often.  He comes off as very unlikable on the outside but he really just wants the people's recognition, which makes it that much more rewarding when he finally gets it.  I also like the character Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman).  He is the mentor character for Hancock.  Throughout the first half of the movie he makes it his mission to make people like Hancock.  I find him to be a very likable and sympathetic character.  I like how dedicated to Hancock he is.

However, in the second part of the film we start to get into Hancock's origins.  This is where things start to go downhill.  We also find out that Rey's wife Mary (Chalize Theron) is heavily involved in Hancock's past.  Personally I find Hancock's origin to relatively uninteresting.  It is original, but original does not always mean good.  I also do not like the character Mary.  She comes off as too mean in both the first and second part.  I get where she is coming from but I still find her annoying.

I also do not like that Hancock has no big super villain to fight.  The villains he does end up fighting at the end are not interesting at all.  I also find Hancock's weakness to be a bit lame.  Again, I do not hate the second half of the film, but I find it a kind of lame.

The effects for the film are top notch.  The score is outstanding, especially two particular themes.  The themes ""Death and Transfiguration"" and ""Moon and the Superhero"" are some of my favorite themes in superhero movies.

Overall, Hancock is an interesting film.  It had some good ideas, some good characters, and some fun moments.  However, it kind of degenerates by the second half.  However, I do enjoy the film despite its flaws.  I still say it is worth watching at least once.",1371340800,,2600,4.45531914893617

3346445,4,B0013J55B6,"""Hancock"" is great! This is how the story goes: There are heroes, there are superheroes... and then there's Hancock. Conflicted, sarcastic, and misunderstood, Hancock's well-intentioned heroics get the job done, but always seem to leave damage in their wake, with the public wondering why they put up with him. But Hancock doesn't care what other people think, until the day he saves the life of PR executive Ray Embrey, and the superhero begins to realize that he may have a vulnerable side after all. Facing that will be his greatest challenge yet -- and a task that may prove impossible as Ray's wife, Mary, insists that Hancock is a lost cause.

3346454,5,B0013J55B6,"As another reviewer pointed out this is really a movie of two halves. The first is a crude humor anti hero superhero movie. Basically if Superman was an alcoholic who saved people and caught bad guys but really did not give a damn. The second half is about the plot twist, and reveals his back story. I won't spoil it, although by now most reading this will already know it. It seems like most people who tend to dislike the movie do so because of the plot twist. I actually did not mind it, but I think the movie would have done fine without it. I liked the whole redemption of a superhero angle that they had going up until then, and there were certainly ways to have a similar ending without the twist.

That said, the movie is not going to appeal to everyone. It definitely has a darker crude humor to it. It is the kind of comedy that you either like or you do not. I think all the actors do a great job, but Jason Bateman was the most entertaining because he had to play the straight man the whole time. It is mostly a comedy action blend, but there is some drama in there too. Charlize Theron sold her character well was, as always, easy on the eyes.

3346468,3,B0013J55B6,"Hancock starts as a straight-up parody. Will Smith's eponymous super-anti-hero is a self-involved, alcoholic jerk who causes so much collateral property damage whenever he tries to fight crime it would be better for everyone if he just let the bad guys get away. He can't pull off the squeaky-clean public persona that his station demands, but gets a chance to turn it around when he saves the life of down on his luck publicist Jason Bateman and the movie sets to mocking the conventions of both comic books and buddy comedies. Will Smith steers his usual charisma to a slightly meaner place, Bateman does a great turn as an earnest nebbish, there are slapstick set pieces in which the hero inadvertently destroys everything in sight, and laughs ensue.

But the the movie works on another level as well, because Smith is black and Bateman is white, giving Hancock the outward form of a Magic Negro redemption story in which a preternaturally kind and sometimes even supernatural black character inexplicably devotes their entire existence to helping a white protagonist get his groove back. That more or less is the plot of the second act of the movie, except where the Magic Negro is beatific Hancock is surly, where the Magic Negro is sexless Hancock makes it with groupies, and where the Magic Negro is ultimately an uninteresting catalyst for white character development Hancock dominates the movie, and would do so on the basis of the script alone, even if he wasn't portrayed by a megawatt star like Smith. That his character plays second banana to a white schlemiel is funny both because one is a man and one is a superman, and because in other movies the same absurd dynamic is presented as natural. At no point does the movie telegraph this particular subtext, and you're free to ignore it, but it adds extra depth to everything.

Then just when you think two levels is enough for any lightweight summer action comedy, Hancock has a huge third act twist that is some ways makes it a profoundly strange movie and in other ways makes it much more like another Batman remake. For my money the ending doesn't quite work: a lot of plot has to get crammed in very quickly, and the climax takes a dark turn which is too tonally jarring given the slapstick that has come before. The last section of Hancock is about two rewrites away from being truly great, but you still admire the filmmakers' audacity. Hancock is worth checking out because it's fun, but worth watching all the way through because it's kind of weird.",1357603200,2,2521,4.740318906605922

The concept of ""redemption"" is a powerful one. I can even honestly say the first third of Hancock was somewhat entertaining, but it went downhill fast! For lack of a better word, the movie became just plain dull! And it's hard to imagine Will Smith in a boring film!

There are so many glaring holes in the story it also became distracting! A good story makes sense within the world the writer has created. When there is absolutely no explanation for major events taking place, an intelligent person will get annoyed! In a nutshell that is the definition of sloppy storytelling! See what happens when Hollywood forces it's writers to go on strike! I bet someone exacted revenge by writing such an erratic and dopey story!

Memo to Hollywood: It's not cool to chop-off both of a person's hands in a movie geared for children! Is that supposed to be funny? If you think so, then maybe you need the services of a psychiatrist! And when you do cut off a person's hand and wave it around, it relaxes, it does not remain inflexible. I guess whoever wrote the script must think everyone is as dumb as the filmmakers of Hancock!

3346480,4,B0013J55B6,"I was a fan of the famous comic book character Superman. I read the comic books as a kid and was a huge fan of the SUPERMAN movies with Christopher Reeve. When I got older I found myself asking a question. Why didn't Superman ever make love to Lois Lane? I knew he was undeniably in love with her, and that they eventually got married in the comic book series. But with the exception of one time off screen Superman and Lois didn't have sex. (And that was only after he gave up his super powers to be with her.)

Watching Will Smith's superhero movie HANCOCK I finally got an answer to my question. Why didn't Superman and Lois have sex? For one good reason: It would've been too dangerous (for Lois Lane.) Hancock has most of the familiar powers as Superman; he is impervious to bullets, has unbelievable strength, and the ability to fly, rather ungracefully. But he is drunk, dirty, and smelly, and is no longer liked by the people of Los Angeles. Every time he tries to do a good deed, there is catastrophic damage as a result. There is a scene where he takes a hooker home to his special trailer in the hills. And when the two of them start to make love, my question regarding Superman and Lois Lane was answered.

I laughed out loud, not only because of the scene but also because of the answer to my question. And all during HANCOCK there were a lot of big laughs. The movie has plenty of the type of superhero action you could want from this kind of movie, and Will Smith once again demonstrates what a good actor he is. Hancock doesn't care that he is hated by everyone. But there is one word he is often called that he really hates. In an early scene when he saves a man in his car from getting hit by a train, the other drivers blast him for what he has done. He responds by insulting them back until the man he saved comes to his defense, since he would've been dead if that train hit him.

The man Hancock saves is an idealistic Public Relations guy named Ray Embry (Jason Bateman). In an early scene he is trying to promote a symbol that will give a positive image to corporations all over the world. The executives in a meeting room look at him as some kind of crackpot. Ray is fully aware of Hancock and so are his wife Mary (Charlize Theron) and his son Aaron (Jae Head), who is the target of a neighborhood bully. He offers his PR services to Hancock as a payback for saving his life. Hancock reluctantly agrees to his offer, and when he returns to Ray's home he deals with the neighborhood bully in a scene that is both mean and very funny.

Ray shows Hancock several clips on YouTube demonstrating the very bad things he had done in the city. Among them is when he dealt with a whale that washed up on the beach. Another one is when he had to put out a fire. The PR man determines that Hancock is lonely and miserable. When the news reports of a warrant for Hancock's arrest, he comes up with a brainstorm. Hancock should turn himself in and do his time in prison. The crime will go up and the public will miss him. Because of his super powers he could easily escape. Hancock agrees and makes a statement to the press that he would serve out his prison sentence.

Hancock's transfer to the prison is good for a laugh, and so is his first day when he confronts a bunch of inmates he apparently put in jail himself. When one of them refuses to let him pass he demonstrates hilariously why that is a very bad idea.

Eventually Hancock has to step in to save hostages in a bank heist, and things start to turn around as far as how the public begins to see him. It is customary in superhero movies to give a background of the character, and Hancock's background starts out one way and ends up in another. Mary sees something wrong regarding Hancock and it soon leads to the other obligatory part in superhero movies. The character has a weakness. All I can say is that Hancock's weakness is different from what I've seen before and is tied in to Mary.

There are plenty of action sequences, including a fight Hancock gets into which causes a storm in downtown L.A. But it is the laughter that HANCOCK delivers, along with the idea of a superhero who is a dirty and messy guy with a bad attitude. Will Smith does this role the only way he can: completely serious. That is generally the way every other actor in the movie treats their characters.

John Hancock (Will Smith) is not your average super hero. For one thing, he's a drunk. For another, he's got a habit of breaking things, smashing things, and losing his temper. Then there's the time he saved people in a burning building, got his clothes all burned off, then raided an ice cream vendor (more or less naked) in front of a group of children for something to cool himself down.

But one day he saved the life of Ray (Jason Bateman), a PR man with high ideals. In gratitude, Ray decides to help Hancock improve his image. I mean, he's got hundreds of lawsuits against him for the damages he caused in the course of saving lives. Ray persuades him to give himself up on criminal charges surrounding his latest escapade, on the assumption that after the crime rate rises because he is out of circulation, the authorities will pardon him so he can smash bad guys again. Of course, in the prison he meets up with a great many bad guys he put there, and they're not happy with him.

The plot has dozens of twists, several totally unexpected, and a complicated piece of romance around Ray's wife Mary (Charlize Theron) and her previous connection to Hancock. Still, the resolution is a satisfying one, even if it may make some of us cringe a little. Remember, it's fiction. You will need to remember that.

I loved everything about it except the high-adrenalin smashing scenes, but I'm sure the younger people, especially males, will appreciate those as well. They tend to happen too fast for me to understand what's going on.

Good fun and heart-warming at the same time. Can't beat that combination.",1336867200,,1822,4.699059561128527
3346486,4,B0013J55B6,"John Hancock (Will Smith) is a super hero, sort of.  He has all the super powers you would like to have, super strength, the ability to fly, invulnerable and immortal.  Unfortunately he is drunk most of the time and while he does try to stop criminals and save lives he destroys millions of dollars of property by accident every time he tries to help someone.  Since everyone who lives in Los Angeles knows him and how he behaves, he is ridiculed by the press, spectators and government officials as more of a threat than as a hero.

Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) has his life saved by Hancock.  Of course, in typical Hancock fashion, he destroys a train, all of the property surrounding the tracks and almost kills someone else.  Ray is a public relations man and he takes it upon himself to help Hancock improve his public image.  Ray introduces Hancock to his wife and later Hancock finds out that Ray's wife, Mary (Charlize Theron) also has super powers.....

This is a good movie that is funny at times and contains a lot of action and special effects.  It is also confusing at times as Hancock's behavior is vile as he drinks a lot and has a foul mouth.  This might have been a better movie for the family had he played a more typical super hero role. Overall the movie is still good but its storyline wanders between Hancock's deeds, issues and past. It almost loses its way through telling the story.  In the end Hancock finds himself and realizes what an asset he can be to the world if only he would straighten out his life.

3346488,5,B0013J55B6,"After reading some of the other reviews, I had to add in my own two cents. I watch a lot of movies. Been watching them since I was a kid. I love superhero movies, collected every comic from Spiderman, to Superman, and Spawn. But the things this movie has over all of those, is originality, good humor, and a touching story. Marvel fans may be upset that there is no cliche Stan Lee-esque radioactivity accident, or nearly Omnipotent ""last son"" of a dying advanced alien civilization. Somebody didn't accidentally fall into a bunch of strange chemicals and develop super abilities. It's very possible that what made many comic book fans not like it is simply that there is no ""I can be a superhero too factor"" for all those nerds out there fantasizing that they can one day stumble upon a magic ring or secret experiment that will make them gods. So as not to ruin the plot for you, I'll say simply that it's a fairly original idea, and I loved it. It's even traumatic in a way and adds a certain amount of emotion to the film. All the characters were very well written and acted, and I don't understand why anyone - comic book fan or otherwise - would have a problem with it. We need more ideas for superheros, or they're all just the same. To keep this short, I'll say this. Rent it, buy it, stream it from Amazon or netflix, or buy the dvd or bluray. Don't ever take the word of a few individuals online. Some of the best movies I've ever seen were given bad ratings by bloated, under-educated people that just don't want to think during a movie. You know what opinions are like. And everyone has one. Just because a few people didn't like a movie doesn't mean it's bad. It just means that it wasn't for those few people. For that matter, don't take my word for it either. Think for yourself, but definitely give this movie a chance. You'll be glad you did. P.S. The unrated version is way better FYI.",1330560000,3,1903,4.393767705382436
3346489,4,B0013J55B6,"Well, at least at first. As near as we can tell, his superpower is to sustain a blood alcohol content that would induce coma in any three other men, plus a rhinocerous or two. But really, he's got it all, the flying thing (even if flying straight doesn't go so well), super strength, bullets bounce off, and all the usual. He just lacks finesse. You know, like knocking on doors in ways that leave the doors, as well as all the other parts of the buildings, in ruins.

Then along comes Ray, the little ray of sunshine. He's out on some mission of Good In The World, with no especially clear idea of what's in it for him or for anyone else. Hancock saves his sorry bum from an improbable doom, with only a few megabucks of collateral damage. As a result, Ray takes on the sacred duty of becoming Hancock's image consultant. It's an easy job, really. There's nowhere to go but up.

Then it gets weird. Good weird, really good. After years of freedom, Hancock goes to jail. He could punch down the walls any time, but Ray assures him that it's good for his street cred, so he manfully avoids removing most of the doors from their frames. He even brings the ball back inbounds when it went out - over the razor wire. And, though he doesn't know it, Ray carries the kryptonite for this superman close to him.

Hancock is a drunken superman who suffers from amnesia and feels sorry for himself. He knows nothing about his past, except that he has super powers and is immortal. He is heavy-handed and uses brute force without thinking about the results of his actions. He does damage when he helps people, producing in millions of dollars in damages. He feels that he must help others, but is insensitive to them. He is not too bright. He uses profanity. When he descends from flight, for example, he crashes onto the ground and destroys the cement. When he saw a car that was about to be hit by a train, he lifted the car and tossed it away from the track, ignoring that the car would fall on top of another vehicle and almost kill its driver. He does not hurry from the train track. The train crashes into him and is badly damaged. People dislike him.

 The man he saved at the train track is a PR person. He tells Hancock that he will help him change his image. He teaches him how to speak nicely to people. He encourages him to allow himself to be jailed for the damages he produced. He takes him to his home where Hancock discovers that the man's wife is also a super being.

 Viewers will enjoy finding out who Hancock is. Why does he have this name? What is his relationship with the PR guy's wife? How many generations has this relationship lasted?

3346507,1,B0013J55B6,"Slight spoilers...

Hancock is easily one of the worst comic book/superhero movies I've ever seen. I would place it on par with duds like Batman and Robin and Daredevil. The only difference is, at least with the other two there was at least a semblance of a plot to follow. The biggest problem with Hancock is that there is no adversary. None, unless you consider himself his own worst enemy. He is fighting alcoholism and recklessness and ummm boredom. The other problem is lack of plot. There's alot of awkward flying and some random fighting, more drinking, a tornado........oh yea, and a poorly devised ending bordering on ridiculous.

Will Smith has basically one facial expression in the whole movie- a cross between constipated and bored. I can't tell if he was acting or he really didn't give a crap about anything that had to do with the film. Also, who didn't see Charlize Theron's character coming from a mile away?? Eye-rolling rubbish.

I can't believe this movie is rated as high as it is when there is literally nothing going for it. But please, if you love boring acting, zero plot and not so great special effects, by all means, buy this film!",1295481600,3,1160,4.704433497536946
3346508,2,B0013J55B6,"I believe it's a universal fact that Will Smith owns the July 4th weekend. And with Hancock, Smith continues his domination at the box office.

Smith plays Hancock, a drunk with superpowers: he can fly, he has super strength and is indestructible. Every time he ""saves"" someone, he ends up costing more in damages. He crushes highway signs, destroys trains, throws whales onto sailboats and tears up the roads.

When he saves PR man Ray Embrey, (Jason Bateman) he gains an ally and friend. Embrey wants to turn his image around from the horrible super freak to the superhero the city needs. However, Ray's wife, Mary (Charlize Theron) is not happy that her husband has teamed up with the no-good disaster.

There are some funny moments in this summer blockbuster. Everything you laughed at in the trailer is in this film. And there are a few funny, Will Smith, moments. There is no doubt that he is a terrific actor.

The problem with this movie comes in a sudden twist that many critics have said comes out of nowhere, and they're pretty much correct. Nobody saw this one coming. And it takes a while for everyone to get back into the mood of the film.

The biggest disappointment was the language. Do you remember Get Shorty? Remember all the swearing in the first five minutes of that movie alone? The writers of Hancock seemed to want to write the dialogue along those lines. And it really turned me off of the plot. They try to use a swear word as a running joke. Stick around for the credits and there is it again. They just can't let it go.

I don't think this was Smith's better movies, and it had too much cussing in it, but it's still a summer-blockbuster-eye-candy-trip. And the box office numbers proclaim Will Smith reigning king.",1294099200,,1743,4.606451612903226

There are components of this movie that are not appropriate for young children and parents should use their discretion. With that aside, this is one of the funniest movies that I have seen in a long time. I highly recommend it because it takes a humorous approach to the Superman mythology. Here Hancock (a being with superpowers) is out of control and an alcoholic. In classic slapstick fashion Hancock creates carnage where ever he goes. Ultimately an advertising man takes him under his wing and tries to clean up his image. It is that this juncture that the hope for redemption is activated within the plot line. However there are complications because it would seem that Hancock is not the only one with super powers. It turns out that the wife of his new friend (the advertising man) also has super powers, but is attempting to remain anonymous in her upper middle class life. the complexity compounds when it turns out that the gal with superpowers was previously Hancock's significant other in a previous life (these beings are immortal). From there the conflict becomes increasingly hostile until the resolution is found that leads to the conclusion of the movie (I don't want to spoil it, so I'll defer on more details).

the bottom line here is that it is a refreshing take on the Superman mythology that is squeaky clean. Here the central character may have superpowers, but also becomes much more human as a result of his addiction to alcohol in conjunction angst stemming from repressed memories of his former life with his friend and mentor's wife.

3346516,2,B0013J55B6,"OK, Will Smith is a fine actor, and even makes Hancock into somewaht of a real, sympathetic character...but this movie is simply dreadful.  A lame concept, with nowhere to go. Storywise, Hancock is yet another in the long series of now utterly boring tales of what it would be like if superpowered beings really did walk the earth; this concept started back in the 1980's with The Watchmen, Dark Knight, Concrete, Marshall Law and Miracle Man comics, the trend continued for a long time in comics and was followed up by such movies as the awful ""Unbreakable"", and the merely decent ""The Incredibles"".  Filmmakingwise, this is simply an excuse for terrific computerized special effects, and a high concept easy for marketing, no more. For a while, I thought that ""Hancock"" might be at least a modern day, jazzed up version of ""The Bishop's Wife"", with it's wonderful love triangle dynamics between a man of the cloth (David Niven), and an Angel on Earth (Cary Grant), vying subtly, and not-so-subtly for the affections of Loretta Young.  Not so.  Once the set up of a diseffected, alcoholic loner, with a good heart, bad manners...and superpowers is established, the writers simply ran out of steam.  Potentially somewhat intersting plotlines including Hancock spending time in jail (for unanswered lawsuits and damages), or the manipulation of public relations in the age of super mass media (which was handled quite well in the Jack Lemmon/Judy Holliday movie ""It Should Happen To You"" 1954) are given short shrift.  Very much like ""Unbreakable"", there's no real payoff, and the backstory never developed in a proper manner, almost as if the creators couldn't be bothered with details. Oh, there's also a moronic bloodbath as a climax, and a truly silly, sappy, green Hollywood capper.  The superhero effects make the once sterling effects from the 1978 ""Superman"" look truly prehistoric, but the charm, wit, excitement, and sense of wonder of that first major, big budget superhero blockbuster are utterly absent here.

This movie has a tremendous amount of humor-- how many other superheroes do you know of that gets sued and arrested for all the damage that gets caused by crime fighting? And Hancock does do a lot of damage; sometimes it seems, just for the hell of it.

But the biggest difference-- the one that a lot of people who are fond of mindless superhero origins-- is that Hancock's background is both unique and touching, so we not only have a superhero but also something of a tragic hero. In this movie, the hero doesn't get the girl, but in this case, that's a good thing. Hancock is the superhero, but his pal Ray is subtly heroic in his own way and that adds a bit of pathos not usually found in movies of this type, yet it all works out in the end.

This is a darn good movie, though badly underrated by people stuck in the Marvel mold who can't think outside the box. If you want a superhero movie that goes beyond the usual tripe, you really should see this one. Trust me, you'll love it. :-)

3346522,3,B0013J55B6,"I'm going to go ahead and get the `SPOILER ALERT' thing out of the way now.

Watching `Hancock', I had an epiphany.  Will Smith is really a superb actor, it's just sad that he never quite gets his projects 100% right.  I mean, he picks some nice work, some interesting and unusual and memorable work, but when the film breaks down it winds up missing the mark in some way, shape or form.

`Hancock' is no different.

`Hancock' gave Will Smith the perfect platform for the type of acting that he does best.  It had layers of comedy, drama, suspense and it allowed him to work his charming charisma, albeit in a way that is unlike most of what he does.  It is not Will Smith that failed this film; it is the film itself that ultimately failed Will Smith.

`Hancock' tells the story of a disillusioned superhero named John Hancock.  He is a drunk and a creep and is despised by everyone, yet they need him in a way since he is, well, a superhero.  When Hancock saves the life of a PR agent named Ray, Ray decides to repay Hancock by reinventing his image.  He instructs Hancock on how to behave, how to react and even how to `save the day'.  Conceptually, this all works beautifully.  The second half of the film kind of takes a nosedive for me.  Remember, I said SPOILERS.  Having the attraction between Mary, Ray's wife, and Hancock was a clich&eacute; for me.  They try to back out of it by making Mary, Hancock's soul mate (his wife) and making her a superhero (god, angel) too, and while this kind of works it also comes across rather cheesy.  The final scene, in the hospital, is an equal mix of brilliant and ridiculous.

But I'm getting ahead of myself here.  Let's rewrite things now.

I would have started by handing the film an R rating.  PG-13 somewhat inhibits the dialog, especially when you consider the type of character that Hancock is supposed to be.  When he's spouting profanities and being offensive is when he is the most entertaining.  Smith handles this side of his character flawlessly (that whole scene with the train and the disgruntled citizens was hilarious).  Next, I would have deepened my approach a tad.  Think `Unbreakable' meets `Roger Dodger'.  While not perfect, `Unbreakable' really nailed the tension of someone coming to terms with their destiny, and `Roger Dodger' understood brilliantly how to craft a character as self-absorbed yet misunderstood as Hancock was here.  `Roger Dodger' also understood that sometimes a mystery is far better than the answers.  That said, I would have completely gutted the ending.  Making Mary another `god' was kind of all sorts of wrong.  In fact, I would have gutted her character and made Ray a single father (the storyline involving his first wife was good enough).  The whole `battle of the gods' scene with the storm and all that was a mess anyway.  Sometimes `flying' in these superhero movies can be so cheesy looking.  When it comes to the final scene, I would have made just a few tweaks.  I idea of having the gods lose their powers when getting close to one another was a nice touch, although gutting Mary out of the film I would have had it that Hancock loses his powers when he starts to connect with humankind, thus forming an attachment to Ray and his son.  Not a romantic, but an emotional attachment.  He cares about them, thus he becomes mortal.  Instead of giving him ridiculous bouts of strength during the final scene (here he is, mortal and weak with love, and yet he gets strong, gets weak, gets strong, gets weak) I would have had him completely surrender to his mortality and die happy, knowing that he is human.  I think that that may have been a great selling point for the films moral center.  Throughout the film it is apparent that Hancock wants to fit in and that he considers his gift a curse.

That said; the whole eerie atmosphere of the wet hospital death scene was near brilliance, including Ray's heroic moment of brutality.

Quite a change, I know, but this was all I could think while watching this film.  This should have been so much better.  In the end, it was entertaining and had moments of greatness, but the fact that it winds up squandering its potential is rather disheartening to me.  This could have been a glorious awards magnet for Smith.  We all know he is in dire need of an Oscar, but not for the material they keep nominating him for.  Smith is, at heart, a comedic actor.  He needs a project that challenges him in that field.  By darkening some of the tones in `Hancock' and giving it a little more seriousness, this could have been the perfect balance of comedy and drama to get Smith that golden bad-boy, or at least another nomination.",1273104000,,4668,4.580917874396135

Will Smith plays the title role, a foul mouthed, pissed off, alcoholic superhero (if you wanna call 'im that) who creates more damage in Los Angeles than he prevents. The people of the city hate his guts because of his attitude issues, and he acts as though he doesnt care, until a fateful meeting with a PR man, played by Jason Bateman, changes his life. From this point, Bateman sets about helping Hancock change his ways and embrace the ""champion"" within and win back the people's trust. Charlize Theron plays Bateman's wife, who may have a connection to our hero's past. A great, witty script plus Smith's charm make for a cool, interesting take on the superhero genre.",1261785600,,750,4.6893939393939394

3346531,1,B0013J55B6,"Let me get this straight. The basic premise of this movie is that what people think of you is the most important thing? Is that over-simplfying the matter?

 The bitter, troubled-yet-supremely-gifted outsider can be redeemed if he will only stoop to wear the mantle of socially acceptable behavoir, complete with all the fawning niceties ahssholes lube each other up with, and the worn uniform of conformity that comforts the tiny, fearful beast that resides within the cold, timid, frail, little confines of self-centered, placated hearts when forced by extreme circumstance to confront the realities of life and death. ""Johnny-Hero here to save your life folks, and look!, he does it all with a firm handshake and a winning smile, isn't that nice? What a fine, decent human being. Doesn't he make us feel good about ourselves, like we are worth saving, or whatever? Our weak, triflin', common-place, conform-at-all-cost selves.""

 Then you got Johnny-Lifesaver with his little cheerio's heart trying to ""save the world"" with pills. I mean, gimme a feckin' break already. Wake the F up. Pills is what's doin' it, people! Get off the f-n pills if you wanna do something about ""saving the world"". You think your population is sickly obese and diseased because it doesn't have enough pills? Maybe Johnny-Lifesaver should've been trying to save the world with corn syrup instead. Yeah, corn syrup and pills to save the world. And just remember that people who smoke pot are losers who don't take life seriously enough and don't knuckle down to get ahead. Yeah, and faahk you too. Don't let the door smash your head up the next guy's ahss on the way out, herc, herc! I mean, that Hancock was great wasn't it? Hoy, hoy, all them digital effects and dog and pony tricks that the masses have always, and always will fall for. I especially enjoyed the one where they made the Fresh Prince all badahss and street. Made him drink liquor wid his meatballs and top dog of cellblock C, an' all dat. What will that guy be told when he stands in judgement before the Almighty? ""Swell work my boy, you molded many a poor heart and even were a bit humorous along the way. Well done, good and faithful servant, you may have your reward.""?

 I gotta admit though, Happyness disturbed me more than Hancock in the end. They should title his next big screen appearance, Hurumph. Or maybe Hurumph, Hurumph, like it was so nice they named it twice, or some shet. Not bad, not bad, but I doubt if Mr. Smith goes out clubbin' without a full entourage, know what I'm sayin'? Or maybe the club comes to him. And then again, maybe he don't do no feckin' clubbin' at all and that's all a big act too, who's to say? Who cares? I wish him nothing but success and happyness the rest of his days, but if his brain does evolve, or is allowed to evolve in old age, as has been known to happen with his kind, the ""not-as-dumb-as-he-looks"" crowd, or even just someday when he gets enough money, he may always feel a little pang in the far corner of his heart when looking back over his lengthy and successful repertoire; when he looks back over the roles society and, especially, the masters of society chose for him and allowed him to play.

 Not I to judge, just trying to describe to myself how I see it. A lotta fun, lotta fun.

 One last, little thing I couldn't help but mention; Why is it that in all these masturbatory super-heor fantasy flicks, fighting crime always means the big, surly, tatted guy with the uzi, and never pimple-faced geeks and ""Johnny Three-pieces"" at corporate headquarters? (Robocop, specifically the original, was the one brilliant exception that comes to mind.) I mean, who are we trying to kid here? To clean out the squids and clams at the bottom you gotta first get rid of all the big, blood-thirsty sharks at the top, am I right? Let's not kid ourselves about that at least.

 Do you realize how much enjoyment and happyness the ""average"" viewer would derive from such scenes? Perhaps you've never had the pleasure of scanning the crowd at a professional wrestling extravaganza. It's not hard to thrill these beasts-- give 'em the thing with big, hairy, rubber tihts on. Grind their faces right into the heart of the filth, if that's what they want. Let 'em have it in spades. Give 'em a few scenes where Bubba has himself a bit of cake and sodomy at the expense of a banker or politician, or better yet, a banker-politician. I mean, would it kill you to humor us with a little self-debasement from time to time? The wretches on the bottom have been having to indulge in it for many a year thanks to all the ""Cops"" shows and ""prime time"" horror the tube continuously spews on them. A little change of pace, carnage against corrupt politicians, corporate executives, lawyers, judges, priests, preachers, doctors, professors, police officers, federal agents, armed forces and the like, for example, would be almost cleansing and therepuetic to the ""everyman"" citizen on the bottom rung whose everyday life is a shet existance under their iron heels and fat, grindy thumbs. Even I would cheer Will Smith in a film of such character and magnitude. Doubt if it would get financed however, just a sneaking suspicion. Maybe Uwe Boll will take the subject on someday. But then you killjoys would suppress distribution on it like you did with Postal, which is certainly the funniest if not the most truthful social commentary/comedy made in the past thirty years. It even surpasses Idiocracy, or at least ties it, if such a thing is possible.

Hancock tries to be all three, and pretty much fails at all of them. The trailer makes it look like an action comedy, but that's only the first part of the movie. The rest of the movie feels tacked on, and just doesn't work.

I don't know exactly what they did to destroy her looks, but it happened. I just want to to know why Will Smith thought this movie should have been made. I mean, did Smith read the script?

Ok so Will Smith is a drunk, irritable, inconsiderate, hapless super hero. He's suppossed to be the last one of his kind. Hancock obviously never learned a thing from a Super Man comic book. Who crashes into streets? Who crushes a train engine and derails a train to save a car? Why not move the car off of the tracks. And I could go on.

So enter a public relations guy who tries to help Hancock. This guy just happens to be married to Hancock's mate, but Hancock can't remember his mate due to some blow to the head or something. Anyway, the two Hancocks fight it out and crash into many buildings. Also, as the two H's come together they lose their super powers.

The movie is DUMB. Smith and Therone are good actors in a bad movie. The story is endearing in no way at all. I bought this movie for $3 at a pawn shop and sold it about a week later at a garage sale for $1.

This movie made me irritable and sleepy because it was SO BAD.

DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MOVIE.

BUY THIS MOVIE AT THE FLEA MARKET FOR $3 and NO MORE.

Now it's become common in movies and tv, but it's doing a disservice to people like me with motion sickness.

And, it does a disservice to the acting. With the camera constantly moving, you can't read the expressions on the actor's faces and feel the emotion. They might as well be players off the streets with no talent whatsoever.

I'm very disappointed. Please, when filming movies, keep that camera still! Let the drama come from the story and the acting, not by contrived action garnered by waving the camera around.",1247961600,5,712,4.5984251968503935

Hancock begins with a unique look at the superhero film but then somehow devolves into the type of boring, ordinary superhero film (complete with tedious mythology and underdeveloped villain) that it was presumably trying to satirize; frankly the only thing which I found memorable after the first half an hour was John Powell's engaging score.

3346550,1,B0013J55B6,"I wanted to like this movie.  I really, really did.  The plot was as creative and unique as any to come out of Hollywood in a long time.  The awe-inspiring special effects (which looked much better than the typical CGI garbage) lended great support to the story rather than having it the other way around.

My problem with HANCOCK was that although it was largely marketed as a semi-family summer blockbuster popcorn flick, the language and sexual content proved totally incompatible with such a film.  HANCOCK boasts two uses of the F-word, 18 uses of the word ""[...]"" (the majority of these spoken by young kids), and explicit sexual content such as when Hancock explains how dangerous his [...] can be.

Many may think I'm overreacting, but I can't help compare this to another super-hero film from last year: THE DARK KNIGHT.  THE DARK KNIGHT had almost no language, no sexually explicit scenes, and yet still brought in more money than any super-hero film prior.  The box office will show what people want to see.",1243296000,10,1018,4.777142857142858
3346551,4,B0013J55B6,"Now here's a real twist on the super-hero theme. Hancock (Will Smith) drinks and wrecks havoc when ever he does his ""super hero thing.""

He drinks, it turns out, largely because he cannot remember who he is, and needs an anchor to repair himself.

He gets that anchor only after he stops a speeding train barreling down the tracks into a traffic jam. Without him, the train would have killed failed PR man Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman). Naturally Ray appreciates Hancock, even if all the owners of other wrecked cars, and the engineer of the over-turned train do not.

Jason sets about repairing Hancock's reputation by suggesting he do some time, taking responsibility for the massive damage caused by his previous heroics. While he is an inmate, Hancock is suddenly missed. Crime begins to spike. He's needed.

Meanwhile, although Jason's son Aaron (Jae Head) takes a keen liking to Hancock, his wife, Mary (Charlize Theron) deeply suspects him. She seems to know something about Hancock is not right.

Don't see this movie if you want the usual Superman or Batman fare. Hancock is not that---although there is plenty of action.

This film has originality, characterizations and a plot that ropes viewers in, no matter how unbelievable. But it's also a nice family flick with a healthy subtext: Identity, family, love, personal attachments and self-respect are all-important.",1242518400,,1374,5.057522123893805

3346553,4,B0013J55B6,"Hancock is an interesting film with a cool premise: what if superheroes were people with problems?  Well that's a theme that's been explored before with movies like Mystery Men and even Spider Man.  The key difference is that Hancock does his job with a huge amount of collateral damage around him that becomes his signature style (providing great fun for the audience).  And unlike other hero flicks, director Peter Berg serves up Hancock with a great dose of realism and empathy.  He doesn't have the legacy or luggage of Spider Man or the Watchmen and he isn't hokey either.

Two thirds of the film is visually impressive and brilliant - and the cast has great chemistry.  Will Smith is always enjoyable, and Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron are great in the film.  Past the midway point though, the film takes off on a slightly different tangent as we explore Hancock's origins.  I'm of two minds here and feel that the film could've stayed on track in a better way somehow.  Some reviewers say that the end of the movie tends to feel rushed and I agree.  It's a film that could easily have added 15 minutes and a lot more development to the story.  I was enjoying it so what was the rush anyway?

Without adding too much of a spoiler, the show ends in Highlander territory (hint hint) and loses some of the verve which gets it there in the first place.  So slightly mixed results for Hancock at the end, but overall, there are some nice nuances here that make this a lot less stereotypical superhero flicks, and yes, better than the Watchmen.

I was wrong however when I told people that I thought this movie would be a stump in Smith's acting career but I guess he's too big of an actor for people to stop enjoying his movie's even when they are low rate quality needless to say this movie will make me second guess the next one Will Smith stars in.,1241222400,,1012,4.35978835978836

There was just too much in the plot arc for it to have much hope of hanging together: the plot twists significantly and starts off in quite different directions on more than one occasion, and in its final act where you might expect some resolution, the (poorly drawn) villain characters and their motivations were too flimsily expounded, and the uncomfortable relationship between the three leading characters - a superhero love triangle, of sorts - was not satisfactorily resolved but instead just found an improbable equilibrium.

There are some great comedy moments - as you would expect, Will Smith has some great lines and he delivers them with his characteristic panache - and Jason Bateman is - well, Jason Bateman - a likeable everyman who injects warmth into the screenplay. But as it goes on Hancock veers uneasily between comedy and edgy thriller, finally (and to my mind unwisely) settling for the latter - there are some harrowing moments right at the end - when the film's loopy superhero premise denied just the kind of credibility needed to carry that off, and had more than enough acting and comedy talent to ensure the former would be a banker.

Like many films of this type there is some over-use of the (undeniably impressive) CGI, and the film, though starting off promisingly enough, winds up being no more than a watchable, if confusing film.

3346567,3,B0013J55B6,"I'm a bit offended by the urban slum theme. Gang members shooting out of a moving SUV and all that stuff makes you want to puke when you consider who may see it as a glorification of their lifestyle. But that's Hollywood's ""LA"" stereotype. And Hancock is your straight-off-the-drawing-board, multiple 750ml drunk...nice! Then they work it out to be a sympathetic attribute later. Beautiful!

Bill Cosby would roll over in his easy chair!

On the plus side, ""Hancock"" does put forth some original material, from actually killing the bad guys [unless they bounce off matresses in the Uncut version] to Hancock's ""Kryptonite"" so to speak. The special effects get really nice once they're through with their goofy ""flying drunken superhero"" bit.

The story and performances are commendable when watched through to the end. If you're not sick of being reminded of the toilet that some actual cities have become, then you may enjoy this movie...I did, in a way. I just prefer fantasy villains over jailbirds when featuring a fantasy hero - I want to be entertained and excited somewhere new, not bored and depressed in familiar territory.

3346568,2,B0013J55B6,"Hancock is not the typical superhero film that's for sure but where it has it's greatest fault is that it ignores its own potential. Most films featuring superheros focus on the conflict between doing a solo job and trying to be an average person. Hancock does this which of course makes it an average film.  Where the movie falls apart is that it misses the chance to focus on the public's fickle approach with celebrity and how we tend to build up a celebrity only to tear them down when they first fall.

That concept seems to simmer just under the surface with Hancock but is never explored or engaged as anything other than a hit or miss idea. Jason Bateman was great as the PR hack trying to get Hancock to reform and change his behavior and turn him into something almost marketable. Sadly the film does not go down this interesting path and chooses to instead be a run of the mill superhero film with lots of car crashes, explosions and so on. I enjoyed Hancock but believe it to be a great deal of wasted potential.",1237593600,2,1024,4.412698412698413

Compared to say, Jon Favreau's Iron Man, Hancock's CG effects and action sequences leave a lot to be desired. It's not just the poor visual quality but also execution. Far too many cuts in rapid succession screams bad editing instead of speed and energy. Even the long shots aren't good.

Sadly it does as Smith seems to sleepwalk through this movie. Where he can normally make an ordinary movie into a good movie and so on, here he makes no difference, and I don't think the problem is down to Will Smith. The script woefully lets his talents down. He doesn't have much to say, and when he does his delivery his flat and uninteresting.

The CGI is impressive but good CGI alone cannot make a good movie. I'd recommend caution before buying this as it may not be what you are expecting.",1236038400,,616,4.356521739130435
3346575,3,B0013J55B6,"I honestly don't understand the glowing reviews of this movie - it wasn't all it could have been and I was left feeling very disappointed.  It started out great - Hancock was the perfect non-heroic superhero.  I loved the action and the storyline up until the part where Charlize Theron's character suddenly decides she's going to rip Will Smith's face off and they start dueling.  At that moment the movie got really stupid really fast, and just kept on going.  Why, for instance, would Charlize Theron's character suddenly decide to beat the ever-living hell out of Will Smith, in the open, in front of many, many witnesses, destroying everything in her path and presumably killing loads of innocent bystanders - to keep the secret of their powers?  Huh?  She could just as easily have shown Will Smith she, too, had powers and taken him off privately somewhere to either duel it out or talk it over.  It just got stupid.... stupid plot twist, stupid ending.  Really ruined it for me.

And the explanation (so-called explanation) of where they came from, how they got their powers, why they were fighting, the bad guys, etc. etc. - how does NOT explaining anything actually explain things?  I can understand a wink and a nod, when appropriate, but the old wink and nod here is just dumb.  It's a dumb, stupid, illogical waste of time.  Here's where the movie was completely broken when it could have been fixed, when it could have become something really great.  The beginning of the movie and both characters certainly deserved better than what they were given in the end.  The movie goer deserved a better explanation of things.  I'm all for psychological closure, but you actually need certain elements which this movie lacked in order to create that type of closure.

To me, it seemed that two writers were at work here:  a really good writer started the movie and got up to that one particular scene. Then that writer died or got fired or suddenly lost the ability to communicate, and a secondary and inferior writer stepped in and, without reading the first half of the script, wrote a completely different movie.  Then they got squooshed together and someone signed on Will Smith.  Tada...

I really wanted to like this movie.  The action sequences are fantastic, the effects are great, and I love both Will Smith and Charlize Theron.  But the movie with so much potential just never really seems to pay off.",1235433600,2,2417,4.759615384615385

I had a problem with that. As I do with all the white men and women who have to go to the black inner city school to pull the poor black kids back from the brink. I have never seen that really happen.
I love Will Smith, but I think he could have pulled himself, out of his slump. So of course in steps Mr White Guy and makes everything ok.
Another thing I didn't understand was how Mr White Guy and his (already married) lady lived in White suburb on the money he wasn't making.
Oh, and how concerned Mrs (Hancock)white lady was about the world and the troubles of the world, but she didn't do anything to help anyone until Hancock showed up. She made a big thing of her being stronger than Hancock. Yet he was trying to help when he could, although it is understandable, with his inferior black mind he didn't know how to help without making a mess of things.

3346579,4,B0013J55B6,A great suprise story. Will Smith plays Hancock with a realism often seen in all his movies. He really believes he is Hancock and that makes the movie more believable and realistic. Charleze Theron is wonderful as his opposite and provides a touching complement to the story. Jason Bateman is the glue of this story and provides his usual upbeat personality to help Hancock become the hero he needs to be. Peter Berg has shown he can direct just as good as the big boys.

He does not avoid the confortain just the limelight.  I laughed when he saved the day but caused millions in damage, wow a superhero who does not care.  Hancock understands he is different and does not go out of his way to change, until he saves a PR rep who takes Hancock on as a client to revamp his image.

Half way through I was getting bummed out that Hancock never explores how he came to be.  Just as I was getting to the point of being bored there was a major plot twist and lets just say we get the a very detailed back story.

I liked Hancock because it was well written, well acted and pretty entertaining.  I would rather see Hancock 2 than the next installment of Spiderman.",1234224000,,852,4.152439024390244
3346582,2,B0013J55B6,"Will Smith is great at comedy-adventure (think 'Independence Day').  He was well-cast in Hancock, a rather original if pretty one-note movie about a superhero with 'issues' of anger management.  He drinks--heavily--feels unappreciated--and can't abide being called an a**hole.

While he finishes off the bad guys and keeps the crime rate down, Hancock also creates a lot of unintended consequences, from destruction of property to lawsuits and subpoenas galore.

You have right there the makings of a nice, 3-star comedy-drama, especially when a PR guy is saved and decides to make cleaning up Hancock's act his raison d'etre.  He even convinces the errant flying good guy to do some hard time to make a point!

Alas that someone in the production chain, scriptwriter, director, who knows, decided to toss in an unfortunate back-story.  Hancock, the only superhero, finds out there is one other (Charlize Theron), that he's an amnesiac, and a whole lot of Highlander-type semi-mystic bologna about an immortal race doomed to pair and die.  This part is not only silly, it's muddled and without clear rules.

However a lot of time particularly in the early part of the movie focusses on fewer stunts and tricks from our Hero who by that time is getting more intriguing as to whether he is actually going to be the good guy. The nice little romantic story subtly creeps in without giving away any clues of the suspense.

Not exactly a superhero movie for kids.

The music in the scenes, particularly when Will Smith looks at his only possessions, the movie tickets he had whenever he wakes up is beautiful.

3346591,3,B0013J55B6,"Hancock is a film as dysfunctional as the title character.  The movie starts out so promising, with humor and action in abundance.  There is even depth to the title character, as he learns that for the non-superpowered, courage can be found in trying to change.  He transforms from a totally self-involved character to one who comes to respect others.

And then it all starts to go wrong.  The major plot twist, and the hidden history of Hancock becomes a jumbled mess.  The writer decide that the great premise they set up is insufficient, and they try to fuse an entirely different story into the plot.

Not since Highlander 2 reframed the characters from the first film as extraterrestrials have I seen such an unnecessary and total overhaul of a  fantastic premise.

It was still adequate, but after the first 2/3 of the movie, the final act is a real collapse in terms of plot and development.",1233273600,,898,4.705128205128205

I don't want to spoil the plot, but it started strong and ended weak. The movie was fun. The emotional travails of a superhero were interesting. When Hancock was in prison and jumped out to get a basketball. He thought for a while, but jumped back in because he was trying to be responsible. I liked that part. However, the villians were weak. The subplot with Smith and Theron was weak. The ending was way too upbeat.

In other words, the ride is great. The end is a slight let down, but it is good, lightweight entertainment. I would suggest rent and don't buy.",1232928000,,796,4.445205479452055

A good balance between provoking us to reflect on the emotional trials of life and our counter-balancing inner hero with sufficient craziness to make it to go down easy. The characters and twists and turns in the story do not allow the special effects to dominate, making all the essential flying, crashing and smashing part of a well-played concert. It seems unnecessary to mention the acting is great since the movie stars Will Smith, and redundant to mention there's a love story involved - it's a movie.",1232668800,,723,4.746031746031746

Sure this is a super-hero/comic book movie, so you have to allow for some extra degree of freedom - but it is really overdone.

The movie starts off with Hancock as a disgruntled, drunk, incompetent superhero.  L.A. is fed up with him destroying buildings and freeways while apprehending car thieves.

He rescues a PR guy (Jason Bateman - who is really good in this movie) and the PR guy decides to revamp Hancock's image.

From here the movie improves drastically and even has some interesting twists and storylines that could have made a great movie.  But it didn't.  It ended up being an ok movie that made lots of money because they were smart enough to cast Will Smith in the lead role.

Overall I'd give this a watchable rating, but it could have been so much better.",1232668800,,1037,4.532258064516129
3346599,4,B0013J55B6,"""Hancock"" is an oddity, both the title character and the film as a whole.  Instead of a typical superhero story that includes an origin story, a sinister villain and a love interest, we are given a tale of a lonely man looking for his place in this world (as well as an origin story, sinister villain and love interest).

Will Smith portrays the title hero (anti-hero) who drinks, swears and does more damage to the city than the criminals he's after.  He simply doesn't want to be a hero.  When called upon, he takes his time getting to the scene, usually botches his landing and aggravates more than he impresses.  He's also terribly lonely, and wonders if there is anyone else like him.

When he saves a kind-hearted publicist, Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), he accepts the man's offer of ""image"" help.  Soon enough, Hancock finds himself in favor with the masses, but does he truly find what he longs for:  an equal?

All of the key elements of a superhero tale are present, just not in the order (or method of delivery) that you'd expect.  We do eventually learn Hancock's past, but from an unlikely source.  There's also a love interest, albeit a very unique one.  And, of course, we do get a very sinister villain, but even this villain finds justice at the hands of an unlikely source.

Overall, this film is one part comedy, one part action and two parts drama.  The language in this unrated version is very strong, even an ""F"" bomb gets dropped.  The action is fast but suffers from poor CGI once in awhile.  All of the cast, from Smith to Bateman to Charlize Theron, give solid performances.  Peter Berg's direction can be erratic at times and does have a somewhat gimmicky feel to it, but it is sufficient.

The unrated single-disc DVD has a few special features, and all of them are worth a look.  I especially enjoyed the ""Building a Better Hero"" and ""Bumps and Bruises"" featurettes.  ""Mere Mortals"" is okay, but Peter Berg does grate the nerves a bit.

In summary, I give three and two-thirds stars (I round up) to ""Hancock.""  The story is very good but would have been even better with more solid direction and a stronger script overall.  Keep the young'uns away if strong language bothers you.  Also, there's a bit of a love triangle that some parents might feel is too hard to explain to younger children.

But when he gets back on his feet, he is prepared to fight crime and save everyone's lives.

Interesting and funny superhero comedy fantasy from director Peter Berg is one of the most original and interesting superhero movies in a long time. Sure some parts are slow and there's some holes in the plot, but this is a solid movie with good performances especially the lovely Charlize Theron as the superheroine that becomes Hancock's friend, there is some nice visual effects and action sequences. It's sort of a tribute to Richard Donner's Superman movies but only with a comical modern twist, recommended.

This Blu-Ray has awesome picture and sound with the unrated version with scenes that were not seen in the original theatrical cut. There's some cool featurettes, digital copy of the film and of course a Blu-ray exclusive that is a on-set viusal diary bonus view  picture-in-picture track.

""Men in Black"" as a superhero movie, essentially.  The first few minutes of the film start in that vein.  However, the movie quickly loses focus, and shifts its tone repeatedly for the remainder of its running time.  ""Hancock"" doesn't know if it's an action movie, a comedy or a drama, and as a result ends up lapsing into melodrama.

Will Smith, Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron do a great job with material that is mediocre at best.  Indeed, Jason Bateman steals this movie from Will Smith.  Absent any direction from the script, he simply plays the same character he did on ""Arrested Development"", and does so with such verve that he walks away with this movie.

Even at a short 1:30, this film drags due to its underdeveloped script.  Like so many high concept movies, it needed a lot of work in the script department.  If nothing else is available to rent, this may be passable.  But, it's unlikely to be anything but a forgettable time-killer to most viewers.",1232323200,,1099,4.701570680628272

3346607,4,B0013J55B6,"Hancock is an entertaining, fun and very watchable movie with great lead actors.  It is an all around good movie although does suffer from some flaws.  John Hancock (Will Smith) is a superhero... of sorts. He's invulnerable, super strong and can fly really fast and as is revealed later on doesn't age either having memories back 80 years but nothing before that.  Unfortunately he has some personality defects.

He is frequently angry, has no friends, while he stops criminals he usually causes more damage than a tornado or an earthquake in the process and is almost constantly drinking. Although personally I'm unclear if the alcohol actually affects him or if it is just an excuse so he can act how he wants.  You see he's the only one of his kind and has trouble being accepted so goes for being a butt-hole instead so he doesn't have to deal with it.  Ironically, he hates being called a certain more potent synonym to butt-hole (with disastrous results for anyone who does) even though that's how he acts.

Then he meets Ray (Jason Bateman in a pitch perfect role for him) who is in PR and grateful for Hancock saving his life (although needlessly derailing a train in the process) and makes him an offer to help clean up his image.  Some time in jail, on very legitimate charges against him, while going to rehab and as the crime rate rises the city will soon be calling for a new and improved Hancock.  And a triumphant return he does have.

This is all the first half of the movie and all excellent.

It turns out though that Ray's wife Mary (Charlize Theron), who's been giving Hancock odd looks and being oddly hostile toward him, has a secret of her own.  In a moment of mutual attraction Mary and Hancock kiss and then she knocks his butt through a wall and tells him that if Ray finds out that she'll kill Hancock.  And stop right there!

If she didn't want it known what she was then shouldn't she have chosen a less violent method of stopping the kiss?  Like maybe just saying, ""I'm sorry, we can't do this.""

Then they meet to talk under the understanding that she'll tell Hancock the truth if he leaves town.  Knowing they have some sort of bond he asks who they were to each other.  Why, brother and sister, she says.  And stop right there!

Brother and sister?  Granted it could happen but a nice black gentleman the biological brother of a very white blonde.  That's weak.  But that's not what Hancock bases his counter argument on.  He says that a brother and sister don't kiss each other like they did.  Huh?

Then a mystery storm kicks up and they fight.  It is kind of implied that the storm has something to do with their powers clashing and dissipating from being together but is never really explained so it's kind of confusing.  The fight takes the pair right through an office where Ray is giving a presentation so he knows Mary's secret now too.

Mary also has terrible mood swings as she act psycho during the fight and turns very loving later on.  Maybe that's what a 3000 year old relationship is like.  This quarter of the movie is its weakest link.  I was able to deal with the fact that they lose their powers through prolonged exposure to each other... I have seen folks who where confused by this but it was stated that it was a gradual process and not Kryptonite immediate.

All of this is saved by a very poignant ending that was sad and jubilant at the same time.  Almost dead, and Mary pretty much all the way dead, Hancock leaps from a window running and flying away from Mary so they will both gain their powers back and live but also leaving behind the only chance in the world for a normal connection he might have had.  Sorry if that's too much detail but it really is great and the first half and this last quarter of the movie more than make up for the mediocre third quarter.

The movie is fun, often funny, has heart, some great special effects and terrific acting... Just that darn third quarter.  I have to recommend the movie despite it.",1232064000,,4025,4.478021978021978

I will say Will Smith sounds very unnatural swearing a lot. Every now and then when he is being sarcastic its funny. But he's not a very good jerk. The climax towards the end is good when he is actually showing sorrowful emotion, but other than that his emotions just seem forced.

I'm guessing this movie sounded a lot better on paper. I wouldn't say don't watch it - because to each his own. But this is probably his worst movie to date. Yes worse than Wild Wild West...and I liked that movie :)",1231977600,,720,4.248175182481752

Cheap Tuesday, and it was busy with hundreds of baby boomers lining up to see 'Mama Mia!' and I ended up in the wrong line, feeling like a complete idiot when I realised that there was no one within cooee of my age in the queue. It was a relief, however, to find that we could walk right into the appropriate cinema and not have to jockey for decent seats.

'Hancock' is a good piece of cinema, but very light. It's one of those films with a great premise that kind of falls down when the story should be getting interesting. You could see that spot at the end of the exposition and the conflict where the writers--Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan--suddenly realised that they don't know where they're going with this story. It's good, but the best bits are in the trailer. Wait for the DVD.

I'd like to give them ten points for trying, but this is one of those unfortunate films that has fallen victim to the Hollywood movie machine. The idea was fresh and new, which is more than you can say for most American films this century, but the execution just didn't cut it.

I just wish we had opted for 'Ten Empty' instead. Oh well.",1231804800,2,1211,4.373333333333333

3346614,5,B0013J55B6,"Will Smith.  He is an amazing actor that can perform in a wide range of roles and pull them off well, from the action hero, such as Independence Day or I Am Legend, to the drama such as Ali.  I will say right off the bat that I am a fan of his and will often like a movie that may be less than perfect because of his presence,

I am not familiar with the graphic novel that thee movie was based on, so I really cannot place the movie in context of how well it compares (or portrays) the graphic novel and fans of the original work probably find issues or not.  But when I first heard of the movie and the general concept of an anti-Hero hero I thought it was a good one.

In Hancock Smith plays the anti-hero, a down of his luck, heavy drinking, misanthrope that is established immediately in his interaction with a child who is trying to let him know that his superhero abilities are needed.  Hancock reluctantly goes to help out and it is hilarious when he catches up with the criminals and describes what will happen as he is nursing a hangover.  (There was some CGI I did not like at the beginning, but it got better later on.  Very strange considering how good the rest is pretty much done.)  And during this hero intervention his attitude leads to destruction of property which seems to be his habit.

He is not very popular due to his destroying things more than the bad guys and has become a bit of a pariah but his luck changes when he saves a PR person (Jason Bateman) who is very grateful and offers to help Hancock reinvent himself, much like many celebs seem to due when they have a faux pas it seems.  There are indications that Hancock really does care and has potential as he meets Bateman's son and discusses bullying.

The movie goes on from there with many good scenes - Hancock trying to be polite in a forced an uncomfortable manner and he eventually does reclaim himself and the tone of the movie shifts a bit, much like Shaun of The Dead, from comedy to more serious (thoughtful?) in the context of an action movie as Hancock finds out more about himself and his limitations.  One of the key points in this is telegraphed earlier when he meets a character (Charlize Theron, the wife of Bateman in the movie.)

There are a couple of glitches/questionable writing bits in the script along the way.  And some of what was going to happen was a bit foreseeable, such as the scenes in prison.  and a couple of CGIs I did not like much, but not enough to harm the movie because when I think about the movie I recall laughing and enjoying it more than the one or two small points.  For people who are familiar with the novel and want the novel, I cannot tell you how you will like this or not.  For movie goers who like action movies, even with the glitches, a 4 to 5 star, and for someone who likes action movies, likes Will Smith and just wants to have a good time, 5 stars and have fun which is why I give it 5 even with the couple of plot points that were weak.",1231804800,,2980,4.234982332155477

A dash to Starbucks for some heated comfort, and then home to snuggle on the couch and the next playful disagreement over which movie to watch first and settling as always on the third choice we made together.

This time around the movie was Hancock.  I'll be honest in that my preliminary expectation was to enjoy some snuggle time while he enjoyed the movie, but I was wrong in that assumption.

Hancock was wonderful.  Will Smith was amazing, and the chemistry between Charlize Theron and himself was smoking!

The movie takes a super hero and turns him upside down by asking the hard question: What if you were the only one of a kind in a world filled with others like but miles apart from who you are? The movie is billed as a comedy but I found myself with tears in my eyes during many moments as Will Smith's character struggled with loss, loneliness, and a desire to be part of something. It's a love story, a crime story, a mystery, filled with angst and starring Will Smith, and Theron.  What's not to like?

I've read the reviews, and they only go to prove one of my personal adages if a critic thinks the movie stinks, I'm gonna love it and I did.  Nuff said.

The unrated version says it has footage that was not shown in the theater, and ran about 1 1/2 hours.  The other disk is the special features disk (explained below).

Will Smith (Hancock) was the normal mix of outstanding actor and funny man that he always is. Charlize Theron (Mary Embrey) and Jason Bateman-""Juno"" (Ray Embrey) do a great job completing the main characters.

The movie begins with bad guys on the run, a police car chase, and shooting.  Through it all, our superhero (Hancock) is passed out drunk on a city bench.  All of a sudden, he popps off the bench and is airborn, booze bottle in hand.  He goes after the bad guys, drops into their car from the sky, and in Will Smith humor, tells them to stop shooting (the noise hurts his head because he has a hangover.) But, bad guys being what they are (bad), they shoot holes in his sunglasses (while he's wearing them).  Then they did the unthinkable--they shot up the bottle of booze.  So Hancock looses his cool and tears their little behinds up!  Of course, the action and humor continues throughout the movie.

Hancock is not your norman superhero.  He is rude, mouthy, sarcastic drunk.  He has the manners of a pig.  He needs anger-management classes, especially when someone calls him ""xxxhole"".  As a result, the people don't like him and are unappreciative of him.  Everybody knows who he is.  He soon meets Ray Embrey.  Ray is a really nice guy who does public relations work and tries to help Hancock change his public image.

I don't want to tell you anymore because I want you to enjoy the twists and turns and the action.  I thought the movie was brilliant and I am really surprised it is not getting better reviews on Amazon.  I will certainly watch this dvd again.

The special features disk contains the following, as listed on the box: (I have not watched the special features yet.)

If you watch Hancock and DON'T compare it to another superhero flick or pick apart every little camera angle I think you will enjoy it as it is funny and the ending is touching!

Hancock was a good movie. I watched it in HD and it has some truly cool special effects. Will Smith was pretty cool too. He portrays a Superman-ish character, but in a way that shows us how Superman would be if he were a drunk with a sorted history. Hancock genuinely tries to do good, but his alcoholism, and personal demons usually screw things up and his good deeds come with steep collateral damages.

The twist is pretty cool, I think they could have explored it much better though.

Rather, he's an obnoxious jerk who just happens to have super abilities who only fights crime when he feels like it or when someone really annoys him!

To be honest, I like this take because not many of us would be a goody two shoes. Hancock is decidedly more human despite his super human powers. In the end, he learns a lesson in humility and finds that he has more in common with the normal man than originally thought.

On the film as a whole, it is rather funny. My favorite part is when he voluntarily goes to jail and many of the inmates that he helped put there confront him. Now, I don't know about you but if someone had super powers and was in jail, I think that's one inmate I'd leave alone! Better yet, if he gave a threat saying ""if you don't move, your head is going up his a**"", I think that would be a sign of ""move b**ch, get out the way"" (with apologizes to Ludacris).

While the plot isn't overly deep, there is a message there and there is a unforseen twist involving Will Smith's character and co-star Charlize Theron! I won't reveal what it is but its a good one!

And lots of drinking. This is not a movie for your children. The story line was interesting, but not stellar. The special effects were awesome!

One reviewer has said that this was a ""white hate"" movie, portraying whites as weak and wimpy, and blacks as strong and cool. I am white and did not pick up on that. I don't think that element is there at all, but you can decide for yourself.

All in all, this was not Will Smith's best movie, but it was a fun ride anyway. I'm glad I saw it, and I'll probably be watching it again.",1230422400,3,685,4.104477611940299

Men in Black, okay; I Robot, okay; I am Legend, okay too; but super hero?  However, my wife's sister rented it for us to watch during the Christmas holiday.  I was amazed at the great job Smith and Theron did in this movie.  This is a great super hero acton movie with an intelligent plot.  Yes, you heard me, an intelligent plot.  Not just a bunch of gratuitous action thrown together, but a well thought out and creative story.  A crime fighting super hero with strange super powers and a twist.  In addition, let's just say he is challenged by a bottle with a cork.  It is not my intention to summarize the plot of this movie and I will not do it here.  Many reviewers have already done so.

He saves a man named Ray who wants to help him become a better superhero and make the city need him again.

3346658,1,B0013J55B6,"I had the feeling that this movie was made up as it went along.  Will Smith is an incredible actor as are so many others in this so why the one rating?

One...

The special effects were great and I thought I'd love to show at least those to my kids as it was a super hero movie but...

Too much cursing to let any kids see it...

Two...

With Will Smith's obvious box office drawing ability based on his exceptional talent, why is he in a movie portraying a super hero who is black but...  An alcoholic?  And as is often repeated throughout the movie a A-- Hole?  And someone that you don't want to like any way?

Three...

Since it does seem like it was made up as they went along and a...

OK, Well let's do this next...  Why pre tell didn't someone ""Make up"" a few different lines?  So something with this many visual affects that would in fact be at least entertaining to children with less bad words, could be allowed to be viewed by children with parents that actually care about a little thing like that?

Because the story line sure isn't ""Deep"" or anything that I think real adults would find intriguing any way...

Which makes me a bit thrown by all the positive reviews and I go out my way to not bash but this has to be bashed.

Charlize Theron?

Gorgeous as always...

But again, how could so many great actors allow this to be released?

After I had told my daughter who had drifted in and out the room, ""You can't watch this"" as she pretended she or maybe did want something from the refrigerator...  I was thinking maybe she could if I deleted the sound....

Are they trying to bring all the A list actors in this down to being C list material?

I just don't get it...

All I could come up with is that maybe they wanted a Will Smith movie that was a total failure in order to have (Hopefully) him make another one to rebound from and regain his respect.

This movie sucks aside from the visual affects and if you do watch it I am wondering if you like myself think all those that gave it past a one are what they want us all to be like mentally.

I'm left not with questions as to whether it was a bad movie over all because to me it was over all, and all things considered horrible...

My question is why would any one put money into something to entertain and not realize that?

I would like to see a movie about a Black Super Hero and for it to be positive.

Play Ta Challa the next time Will:)

3346660,3,B0013J55B6,"I thought Hancock would be the BAD SANTA version of Superman. I was half right. Starring the action star/quality actor Will Smith as Hancock the drunken-bum super hero, this is a movie without an identity. Just when you think you know what kind of movie it is, they pull the rug out from under the viewer. The change is so huge that is feels like one movie grafted onto the back of another, neither of which is complete or satisfying.

The first act is about Hancock coming to grips with the fact that he is a drunken a-hole and his need to behave himself and cultivate a better image. This is a fantastic plot line, and one they should have stuck with throughout the film. With the aid of a failing publicity agent, he manages to clean up his act, change public perception, and save the day in probably the most entertaining scene in the movie, in which he uses what is at hand to foil a bank robber holding a bomb detonator. This plot line could easily have been expanded to make an exceptionally funny and sly super hero movie, one as good and stereotype breaking as THE INCREDIBLES.

  *****WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD*****

Sadly, the 2nd act introduces a new plot line: it turns out that the wife of the publicity agent is also gifted with super powers like Hancock, who until this revelation, believed he was the only one of his kind in the world. What spins out of that plot is Highlander esq (complete with storm clouds and lightning) and highly confusing. This plot line would have been more suitable for a traditional super-hero flick with a super villain, etc...

Collided as it is with the first half of the movie, it feels tacked on and strange; not because it is strange, but because it in no way builds off of the first act.

The third act brings things to their final conclusion, with more Highlander like dramatics, and a sort of add-hock villain whose limited introduction is a five second television clip describing his back story. This hook-handed baddie is completely unsatisfying, and it's only through a stupid plot twist that he is capable of challenging Hancock at all. Every super hero needs his weakness(es) but artificially limiting the super hero to make the conflict mean something is lame. (And yes I felt this way about the ending of Superman also). I wanted to see Hancock get picked on by someone his own size, so to speak.

Unsure what kind of movie it wants to be, and unsatisfying as incomplete portions of its two identities, HANCOCK ends off target. The film could have been excellent, but ends up no better-than-average because of its incongruity between the first half and second halves.

2.5/5 stars. A good one to rent.",1230249600,2,2658,4.626326963906582
3346661,4,B0013J55B6,"In my opinion this movie is just simply fun to watch!

The acting was great, and the story was very decent. The story-line did almost completely change more than halfway through, but I thought it gave the superhero, Hancock, more back story, as does every superhero!

It leaves open a potential second film, and I've already heard there probably will be one, so there's room to answer any left open questions anyone had for this film.

Hancock is a lot of fun! Check it out!

That's how Hancock feels to me... like the movie has a big hole in the middle.

I wonder if, in order to make the movie run a certain time, the director went to the editing room, and had them cut... no... CHOP... the movie down to the time he wanted...

It just feels like something's missing",1230076800,2,373,4.225352112676056
3346663,4,B0013J55B6,"This was a great idea for a movie with Will Smith as the lead and Jason Bateman as his future PR man.  The movie starts off with a chase scene and Hancock, named after John Hancock, comes to the wreckless rescue.  Here is a superman type super hero who is flying around like spiderman not because he has webs to fly with, but because he is soused.

You get the idea that Hancock is very well known by everyone since this is obviously not the first time he has intervened.  Next we meet Ray, (Bateman), who is a PR man who is obviously struggling with a new idea.  Funny, so, it seems rather obvious that he is going to turn Hancock's life around.  Hancock saves Ray's life and that is where they meet.  Ray tells Hancock like it is and hands him a business card, and this is where the story really takes off.

The first scene is laugh out loud funny,there are definately other scenes that are a laugh as well.  And there are a few surprises.  You have the opportunity with flash backs when Ray uses YouTube to show Hancock some of his less than stellar moments.

Playing Mary (Theron), Ray's wife, who takes Hancock to a new dimension.

The movie is fun, however, there are some things that I think would have made it perfect. Great effects and justice meted out make for a great story, but there are just a few times where the word 'Jerk' could have been used to insite him to action instead of the other word.  Not to sound silly, but young kids were using the word, and for the types of movies Smith has been doing of late, this seems somewhat of a step backwards.

Overall, I hope there is a sequel.  This was definately a fun ride with a good story line.",1229990400,,1659,4.272435897435898

Instead, we are whisked away from scenes before they have a chance to develop any depth or have any impact on us. We are never given the chance to connect to the characters and get sucked into their world.

3346669,4,B0013J55B6,"This is a tough crowd here in Amazonland. I wanted some dumb, mindless entertainment and purchased Hancock. Imagine my surprise when I liked the film for many of its railed about bad points.

First, the idea of a screw-up, alienated superhero that causes as much damage saving people as letting them get away appealed to me. It seemed like a novel, human approach rarely written in this type of genre. Imagine my next surprise getting caught up in the film's three main characters, admirably played by Jason Bateman, Charlize Theron and Will Smith.

I'm not sure what would have pleased the critics here as some wanted Smith to play Faust while the other half wanted The Fresh Prince. I just wanted to see an enjoyable film and instead got better than I bargained for.

While it is true that the film doesn't know what it wants to be, screwball comedy about screwball hero, faux drama that still comes off as fairly humane and funny and not all that faux to begin with, to a third act that tries to reconcile both prior acts and does a decent job of it - note, decent, nothing better, but that put Hancock ahead of several other summer films of 2008.

Director Peter Berg has a fine rapport with two African American (how I hate the need to mention this fact) lead actors in his last two films, in the somewhat more serious Jaimie Foxx (The Kingdom) and the seemingly off the cuff humorist found in ""Will Smith"" both doing excellent work in their seemingly different movies. But as I see it, both deal with similar subjects, lives the protagonist has to live with, and in each their way with people that care more than the protagonist may be comfortable with.

But I'm reading more into the film than necessary too, only I admire.

To confirm:
good acting
very good directing,
big, small and nervous laughs
earnest questions as to ""Who am I?""
""Sexual tension""
All of which make for a charming, funny and at times almost heartbreak-filled, in fact, the hospital was one such time. Who do you root for? Someone will get hurt and that someone is decent In fact there's no real winner.

Or am I making too much of a fairly light heartedsummer block buster? Not meaning to be a jerk, but not every film is meant to be Citizen Cane.",1229472000,,2226,4.5361596009975065

There are some suprising expletives in the first couple of scenes, and a few plots holes if you pick it apart, but COME ON it's a super-hero movie!  I had heard mixed reviews about it before I watched it, so I didn't go in expecting it to be amazing, and maybe that's the key.  It's not the movie you would expect from the trailers, but that enhanced my enjoyment of it in this case.  Yeah, it's not Batman, but I'm still buying it and I probably buy one movie every two years.  Best advice, watch it without pre-conceptions and just enjoy the ride.",1229472000,,661,4.290322580645161

But what really makes it average is the lack of real super villian without that aspect the movie cannot soar like the better superhero flicks.  This movie isn't a comedy though like the likeable ""my super ex girlfriend"" either; it's about a being in turmoil and Will Smith pulls this off very well.  The fact that the other characters are well adjusted makes their performances seem less than they are, but they carry
their parts off very well.  This is a b movie on a A budget and that's a good thing because it looks great and is entertaining.  Hancock searches for redemption and he has to suffer to get there and that helps to make the flick have extra depth too.  Will Smith makes this movie though, the rest of the cast supports him very well  in this quest ,and a leading man couldn't ask for more than that.  As with any movie the blu ray version is a visual treat so this is best way to watch it.  And the print looks great here without any defects at all.

Like many people have said: I too, was a little unsatisfied as to why Hancock and the girl are these two unique immortals with a rather weak brushed-off kind of explanation as to why they are what they are. And why did Hancock have no memory of her but she remembers everything and understands their existence better than he does. The very most important thing to know about these two, wasn't explained very well at all. But this movie does remind me of another movie where people are living with a unique cursed alternative existence from the rest of the mortal world. Remember ""Cat People?""

Even after the the character got a grasp of his situation in the plot, he never ""went live"" in the way I expect Will Smith to play a part. Like with other actors of his caliber, I suppose maybe I expect more and I found him letting the movie carry his character. So in essence, Smith was sandbagging and wasn't fully invested in the part.

Basically Hancocks entire story could of been told in a two minute preview of the movie.  I never felt drawn into the characters nor did I even care for them.  I found that I began predicting what was going to happen even though the relationship and hero back story between the two (Hancock and the woman) kind of caught me off guard but I still wasn't that surprised.  I think the cover of the blu ray kind of gives away what the blonde woman might be in this movie.  Usually when I watch superhero movies I can say somewhere in the movie ""I wonder what they will do in the next one"" but I simply didn't care about another Hancock movie.  I felt like I was being pushed to hate Hancock in the beginning and then start liking him when he gets to be a good modeled hero but it all just felt so predictable and pushed.

Hancock is about a bum superhero he meets a guy who wants to help change him into a respected hero.... the only thing is, there is no bad guy to take on, there is very little comedy, and way too much drama for such a plot-less movie.

Either give it a super villian and make it an action movie, or make it funnier to see a drunken version of superman. Why leave it as nothing? It leaves too many things un-answered and finishes not deserving any interest in a sequel.

Had this movie not have had the back up of a few million dollars for CGI effects, it would be rated 1 star everywhere, but because it's Will Smith, his devoted fans can not give it less then 3 stars.... you know damn well the movie stinks, take away the effects, it has no plot and your left with nothing but a bad movie.

All he knows is that he is super-strong. Bullets and needles do not penetrate through his skin, and has lived for quite a long time. He goes about helping others but does so in such a style that people hate him, they boo him and he, therefore, is even meaner.

From the outset we see Hancock turn to alcohol to suppress his loneliness and inner hurt, but in helping a PR agent, played by Jason Bateman, he meets someone who wants to return the favor and clean up his act.

Comedy is best when there is a certain 'shrewdness' or 'anti-shtickness' to the story, characters, dialogue, etc,etc...IF, as this movie does, they're going to pander it to a relatively adult audience. This fails across the board from cheezey plot to the adolescentlike scripting. Will Smith looks and acts totally and completely shoe-horned into this role. This movie folks, is the very definition of low brow humour. Contrived and insipid. There are a few funny scenes, mostly due to Jason Bateman's straight man acting.

Waste your money if you want, but if you MUST see this movie, take my advice and just rent it.  You will be very glad you didn't waste your hard earned money as I did.

With new purpose, a new attitude, and a new outfit, Hancock finds the answers to a lot of questions that he has been searching for (including who and what he is), from an unlikely and surprising source (another of his kind).

While some may not like the ending, if you really think about it, what other outcome could there be, where everyone would be happy? Those who are immortal and will live forever will eventually have the ending that we all want, it will just take patience.  The peace and calm that Hancock finds shows us his true spirit.  After all, what is waiting another few years to find complete happiness, for someone who waited 80 years to discover the truth about who he is?",1228694400,4,1116,4.644670050761421
3346685,4,B0013J55B6,"Will Smith stars as Hancock, a down and out superhero who is forced to employ a PR expert, Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), to help repair the image when the public simply isn't feeling all of his damaged during his superhero moments. Ray decides that the best way to make people realize how much Hancock means to the city is to make him openly deal with his issues as well as the many legal issues however the question remains will Hancock live up to his new image or go back to being Hancock. However, when his past is reveal to him as well as someone who has answers (Charlize Theron) who plays Ray's wife as well as share his powers but a large sacrifice has to be made.

Will Smith and the team at Overbrook have done it again with Hancock while many weren't sure about the movie I have to say that Smith gave a vibrant message?

Like any movie is always a message d this time I took the message as there is always someone out there for us but sometimes finding our mate isn't always the answer.",1228521600,,995,4.2592592592592595
3346686,5,B0013J55B6,"I knew nothing about the storyline in Hancock other than he was a superhero with a seriously bad attitude. I rented it just because we are compelled to watch all the superhero movies.

What I knew was definitely true. Everyone hates him. His first heroic act in the movie began with a little boy shaking him out of his drunken stupor. He then flew off and created millions of dollars in damage.

In spite of the cursing, which there is quite a bit, and a few scenes of unpleasant violence and lots of drinking, this movie delivers a great couple of messages. Hancock lets an image consultant help him through the steps of becoming a better superhero and in the process a better man. Ray, Justin Bateman, is a terrific father/family man and friend to Hancock. There are scenes that are downright touching.

A plot twist completely caught me by surprise. (I could've read the box and not been completely surprised, though.)

3346687,4,B0013J55B6,"Superhero films generally do very well with me, nine times out of ten I will enjoy these types of movies, with some of them ranking amongst my favorite films of all time. With the recent superhero release of ""Hancock"" starring Will Smith, I wasn't sure, when sitting down to watch it, what I was going to think about the movie. Based on all the reviews I had heard or read regarding the theatrical release, I found myself having little to no expectations for this movie. The only way I could think of for even remotely psyching myself up to see it, were two standout features for the release; one, Will Smith always delivers terrific performances, no matter the source material, and two, the unrated extended cut was to include ten extra minutes of footage not shown in theaters. However, even the critics agreed that Will Smith was engaging, even though they found the movie to be lacking. Leaving me with only one question, ""Were the ten minutes of additional content enough to salvage what many felt was a disaster of a film, or was there no hope left for this superhero to cling to?""

""Hancock"" follows the adventures, or should I say misadventures, of an alcoholic superhero named Hancock (Will Smith) as he goes about the business of saving lives in and around Los Angeles. The problem with Hancock is that even when he's doing the right thing, he's going about it all wrong, and typically he causes more harm than good. Enter publicist Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), an idealist who, against his wife's (Charlize Theron) possibly better judgment, attempts to turn Hancock's life around, and transform him into the hero he should have been all along.

Unrated editions and extended cuts are words and/or labels that Hollywood likes to slap across the cover of DVD's and Blu-ray's in an effort to lure gullible customers (like myself, sadly) into believing the movie to be an even better version than the one they may or may not have seen in theaters. Generally, these new editions of a movie are little more than one or two extended or altered scenes that add little to no value to the overall movie. But, there are rare occasions where these unrated or extended editions actually prove to be a completely new movie experience, and many times allow for a much more improved final product than the theatrical cut. ""Hancock"" happens to be one of those rare occasions, because the newly added ten minutes of restored footage gives the story a much more cohesive structure, giving audiences the sense that they now have a complete movie to enjoy. As opposed to one that was chopped to bits in the editing room to appease the wishes of executives that didn't have the film's best interests at heart.

In a summer when superheroes reigned supreme at the box office, ""Hancock"" as a superhero film was sort of an oddity. On one hand he's a super-powered hero that saves the day, when all is said and done, even if he isn't nearly as efficient as other heroes may be. While on the other hand, he's the antithesis of everything beyond having some super powers that makes a hero so great. It's this dichotomy within Hancock's character that makes this superhero movie all the more appealing to me. Sure, having some Academy Award nominees in your cast will help almost any movie, especially when they are the likes of Will Smith and Charlize Theron; but the inner conflict raging within Hancock over trying to do what's right and saving humanity versus not caring anymore, and just drowning his sorrows, is what creates the dramatic element needed for a film such as this to succeed. I also appreciate that by taking this approach to a superhero film, writers Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan, have combined traditional comic book elements such as an allusion to a greater destiny, massive action sequences and great visual effects, together with some off-color, at times raunchy comedy, and even a little bit of mystery to shake up the genre.

I will admit that as fun as ""Hancock"" was, it's still not a perfect film. There could have been even a little more story added in, and a few more elements could have been explained about the hero and other factors within the film; however, had too much detail been added back in, then a majority of the mystery surrounding Hancock would dissipate, which could possibly make for less interest and places to go with the inevitable sequel. Now, don't get me wrong when I say that there could have been a little more added content, what was added back in did indeed bolster the story even further, and the movie does not appear (in my opinion) to have any gaping holes left that distract from the experience, as was the case with the theatrical cut. Although, there are still some elements within the story that did leave me curious, but these were most likely left in the movie intentionally to give some direction for where the sequel needs to go.

Will Smith (""I, Robot"") once again proves that he can overcome virtually any competition and rule the box office, not to mention he was once again the king of the 4th of July weekend. I believe ""Hancock"" marks his fifth movie to debut in first place at the box office over the holiday weekend, and his eighth in a row to debut at number one period. Will's charismatic, and at times commanding, performance made even this seemingly unredeemable hero enjoyable even when he essentially hits rock bottom and has to begin his ascension to become the hero the world needs. Jason Bateman (""Juno"") provides some quick one-liners that hit the mark every time, effectively countering the darker elements within the first half of the film. Surprisingly, Ray (Jason's character) was actually given a decent story arc throughout the movie. I suspected that because he was the PR guy that helped to get Hancock back into the public's favor that he would slowly drop out of the story once this was achieved, but he turned out to be a central figure throughout the duration of the movie.

Lastly, Charlize Theron (""Monster""), as Ray's wife and someone with an obvious link to or knowledge of Hancock's past, was underused in the early portion of the movie; however, the latter half provided her character with much more development and importance, rather than being just the eye candy for the film. Her performance was strong for the most part, although she perhaps played it too overtly that something about Hancock bothered her, and her attempts to play that off were lazily handled. It is possible that this was done in such a way because of how the script called for it or it was director Peter Berg's wishes. Whatever the case may be, I was surprised that this was how she was made to act in the early moments her character was around Hancock, and I found that it made her performance feel uneven, and her delivery even seemed a little unenthused as if she wasn't entirely into the story early on. Once these early moments passed, Charlize quickly found her stride, and her performance greatly improved (as is expected with such a talented actress) throughout the remainder of the film. Overall, had it not been for the generally strong performances of the cast of ""Hancock"", the film's subject matter may not have worked so well with audiences, especially when compared to the other exceptional superhero films released this summer and of those past.

With heroes such as Batman, Iron Man, and The Incredible Hulk knocking out competition left and right this summer, it's a shame that the powers that be wouldn't allow the better version of ""Hancock"", found in the unrated edition to air in theaters. Had this occurred, I believe critics would have given the movie a much warmer reception, most likely not as warm as they did for ""Iron Man"" or ""The Dark Knight"", but without a doubt better than they did for the film's theatrical release. Even with most critics bashing ""Hancock"" all over the place (to be fair there were some that did like the film), Will Smith's magnetism with audiences still allowed him to overcome the adversity posed by negative reviews and come out on top for a week or two in one of the most competitive blockbuster summer's in history.

But, yeah, the movie really was a letdown. It hasn't been the worst movie I've seen recently, not by a long shot, but the fact that I had actually expected more is where it's upsetting. There were so many holes in plot, ham acting, and an overall storyline that just had no point. I don't know. I'd write more, but I'm rather tired all of a sudden, so yeah.

Bottom line: huge letdown and just an overall frivolous, no-point movie.",1228435200,,605,4.298245614035087
3346690,4,B0013J55B6,"The trailer for this movie is certainly one of the best to come around in a long while, peaking my interest in the movie. However, once the reviews came pouring in, I was worried, and decided to wait for Blu-Ray. So is the worry for nothing, or is it justifiable? Well, while some of the reviews were a bit over the top, 'the plot comes to a halt in a scene involving a kitchen utensil.' Really, it's not that exiting, and no, none of the main characters die. The curve is out of left-field, but I moved with it and continued on. The plot doesn't come to a halt, it just changes in tone, since we already got past the drunken hero part. If it hadn't gone in the direction it did, it just would have become too cliched.

With Will Smith in a movie, you expect heavy on the action and comedy, and Smith doesn't disappoint yet again. It's a 4th of July blockbuster for gosh's sakes! You've scene parts of most of these scenes in the trailer, and it's even better in the movie. The magnitude of the drunken-idiot-efforts of Hancock is incredible. And as always, Will Smith is great per usual, as is Jason Bateman. Charlize could have been casted better, but no big deal, as she still looks good after all these years.

However, there are two problems with this movie. First, if you're not doing an origin movie, then implement flashbacks. Otherwise, there's too much dialogue explaining, which naturally leave plot holes, and you saying ""What the heck?"" With proper use of flashbacks, you can eliminate this, and keep the plot moving. Secondly, while Peter Berg does a decent job, they could have gotten somebody better, as the movie carries a largely out-of-place arthouse feel with the camera work. In this case, a normally straight drama director doesn't work here, especially a movie introducing a character. If they had done these two things, then the movie could have been five stars. Otherwise, it's a four.

Overall, in this case, it's just best to decide for yourself and see the movie. You're either going to love it, or kinda love it. It could have been a lot better, but it could have been a lot worse, and it brings a hefty dose of originality to the genre. Just keep in mind, the trailer is probably better than the movie. I am however already lining up for a much-needed sequel.",1228435200,,2289,4.5375302663438255
3346691,2,B0013J55B6,"The point of Hancocks origin has been missed by it seems all who have reviewed here.  His female ""co-angel"" says that they were called ""gods"" or ""angels"" in times past.

I watched both versions of this movie & both are equally enjoyable. Will Smith is Hancock who is a hero that is often called an a-hole, because he's a jerk of a hero. And a drunk. During the movie he undergoes a character chance,via going to prison and getting help from a PR guy (Jason Bateman) The cover gives away that he's not the only superhuman on Earth,sorry to say for those not having seen it in the theaters... This isn't as quite as good as any of the 3 X-men movies (just my opinion) , but its on par /somewhat better than other action movies such as Fantastic Four ( 1 and 2 ) I Robot, I am Legend. If you liked the Hulk movies,other Marvel Superhero movies you will like this as well,maybe more. I was into the characters in this. It was cool to see Jason Bateman who was once a teen idol of sorts. I would certainly rent this first if you aren't at least 90% certain that you would like this movie. Id say half of you will call it a renter - and half of you will go running to the local video store and get the DVD of it :) I bought it without seeing it in the theaters first and I thoroughly enjoyed it all the way through. Having seen the 92 minute and 102 minute versions, you cant go wrong either way.
I have the steelbook DVD - which is basically the same as the 2 disc unrated version. If you totally love this movie, get the 2 disc, but if you like it and want to own it and don't care about bonus features,extras,etc, then just get the one disc. (note the one disc has the theatrical version)
++Somewhat of a spoiler - One flaw of the theatrical version - when Charlize Theron ( Mary) goes to meet Hancock ""at 4 O'clock""  she flies to his home. In the unrated version she drives over there.

Another unfortunate failing was the mistake of not expanding and further exploring the rather intriguing identity and history of Hancock and his feminine counterpart and immortal Mary (Charlize Theron). Apparently the producers were content with the one-dimensional story line, unless of course they're planning on covering that in a Part II sometime in the near future?",1228176000,7,809,5.082706766917293

He he has super powers, but because of amnesia he has no idea who and what he is. He just knows that no one wanted him after he woke up in a hospital, so he figures he must have been a bad man. He offends and angers almost everyone with his behavior, almost as a fulfillment of what he thinks he must be.

He saves a man's life (Jason Batemen), who takes him on as a project, and gets much more than he bargained for.

This movie has surprising depth for a superhero movie. It's also interesting to see a less than perfect hero. I enjoyed the personal progression and emotional healing Hancock was brought through. It made the story more real and captivating. I also enjoyed the sci-fi type twists and turns the story took. The special effects were outstanding, and the story held my attention throughout.

Will Smith is a wonderful actor who can bring a character to life. There's just something about him that comes out in his acting that's so likable, despite the gritty character he played. Charlize Theron sizzled and brought real emotion to her character. Jason Bateman was very also very likable which was perfect for his role. Even the child who played his son was wonderful.

I would heartily recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys sci-fi, action, adventure or superhero movies. I didn't give it a five star because it left me just a little bit unsatisfied at the end.

3346701,5,B0013J55B6,"I read some reviews when Hancock came out in theatres. Most of them gave it mixed ratings but there were some 3 star ratings like I saw here on Amazon.com. I can't tell you enough how much I disagree. There have been so many to take a comedic shot at superhero films but they are usually either Ok or just plain bad but not this one. Anywho, Hancock is definitely a great film, so great that I could not wait to stamp a 5 star rating on it and tell ya why but first I'll tell you what it's about.

Will Smith stars as John Hancock, a loaner, alcoholic,and depressed superhero. Of course those are definitely not characteristics you want to see in the man that has superman like powers like Hancock. The story goes that Hancock woke up one morning in a hospital, he didn't know his name, birth date, or if he had any family or friends. By now you can imagine how he got that name of his, a nurse asked him for it and he thought it was his name. He only knew what the doctors told him, that he was hit on the head trying to stop a mugging. Through the years he hasn't really tried to become a perfect hero or even a good one at that but he does the minimum.

Hancock wants to be loved but acts as if he doesn't care and this is when Ray (Jason Bateman)comes in. After being saved by Hancock Ray thinks of a way to recreate Hancock to give him what he wants, to be loved by the people. The both of them set out on a mission to do this but this movie is no doubt deeper than the surface. Things get more dangerous and the plot twists just enough to become one of the best dramatic comedies about a superhero I have ever seen.

First of all I think that Will Smith is one of the few actors that could take a film like this and make it so good. Good job by the writers as well for giving it a good comedic feel but keeping it a little realistic and never going over the edge. Smith did a great job, he made you think that Hancock could actually be real and he was hilarious doing it but still did great with the dramatic scenes. The rest of the cast was also good, I really liked Jason Bateman in ""The Kingdom"" and he did well here but Charlize Theron definitely shined the most out of the supporting cast. She and Will Smith had some great scenes together and made it believable.

The action scenes were very cool, great special effects and seeing Hancock flying like a new baby bird with arms and legs flinging all over was hilarious. One thing I thought that could have been improved were the fight scenes. There were definitely a few but it was just a lot of flying around and crashing into buildings. Had they added a bit of choreography it would have been on point for sure. Because the films acting was executed so well I can't really take a star for this cause it wasn't significant but was still noticeable.

The story was great and I have to admit that I had the film thought out all wrong. I loved the way they make it look like this sort of cool comedy but it starts to run a little bit deeper towards the end. It is not a huge jaw dropper but the twist is still cool, at least to me it was. Overall, I loved the movie, I think Will Smith is no doubt one of the greatest actors to do it. The films concept was definitely awesome and thought out and executed well. The story was written well also and the cast was picked nicely, not too much action, not too much comedy, and not too much drama. It was just right and it definitely showed. I wouldn't recommend this as a family film unless your all over 15 but it is definitely a must see. The empty Blockbuster stores definitely showed this.",1228003200,16,3596,4.138769670958512

Then comes the last 40 minutes or so...  Right about the time Will Smith gets thrown for a loop in the plot line and everything unravels from then on.  I can see why they did this since you can only keep teenage boys' attention for so long before it falls into oblivion.  Take a great story and round up all your plot points for one plot point and get to the ending as soon as possible.  Quite a shame because there was a lot going for this movie in the beginning.  If they had kept that momentum going and used the antagonists like they should have, this would've been a really great film.  Unfortunately, it's all fodder by the time the film ends.

I give this movie three stars because of the great first hour and it being truly visionary in it's concept.

3346706,4,B0013J55B6,"Superman was raised by a kindly couple and taught the decent way to live and respect life. Thor is the God of thunder who was exiled from his home of eternal Asgard to live on Earth as a mortal so that he may learn humility. Spider-man required personal tragedy so he could realize the responsibility of having powers--Batman deals with his tragedy in a very different way, for him he does what he does for vengeance.

All comic book ""super-heroes"" have their stories of the ""why's"", the ""how's"" and the ""what's"". Director Peter Berg's ""HANCOCK"" is a spin on the super-hero genre, together with the screenplay by Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan they present a hero not adapted from any line of comic book myth. The film has all the elements of a comic and exudes ""popcorn entertainment"".

John Hancock (Will Smith) is a man with tremendous powers, he has chosen to use these powers to help people but he has been labeled as a menace in the eyes of the public. He befriends a public relations specialist named Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) who encourages him to be ""nice"" and stop acting like a jerk. Despite the protestations of his wife Mary (Charlize Theron) not to get too close, Ray and Hancock forges an uneasy relationship. Hancock is a guy who has no idea exactly how he came to be--he's an immortal with no memory of his past. He is, however, about to find out....

The first act of the film fleshes out the frustrations and anger that Hancock suffers. He is brash, careless, irresponsible, rude, hot-headed and well, a lot arrogant. He carelessly uses his powers to help but for some reason, the people he helps ends up disliking him. Power without responsibility and the ability to use wisely is indeed a menace. He wreaks destruction to property and his exploits prove too expensive for the city so a warrant for his arrest is issued. This aspect has been explored in Marvel's ""Civil War"" comic mini-series, which delves into a plotline about a required government registration act for super-beings. For in the real world, property damage is a major obstacle for super-heroes. (no wonder they wear masks) The film is sort of a ""coming of age"" movie, as the character of Ray Embrey becomes his sort of a mentor--ironic that a mere mortal could teach him the ropes of ""super-heroing"". The film is sort of a social affair and fleshes out the feeling of alienation to those who are different. There is one major plot hole or a perhaps more of a question in the film, a being as powerful as Hancock can be affected by alcohol or does he just act as if he is so impaired? Where does he get his money--does he do anything for a living?

The film is your usual ""run of the mill"" comic film,  but it does attempt to find a soul. The origins of Hancock is quite interesting and while it is a tad underdeveloped (no doubt a set up for a sequel) the script does offer quite a few surprises. The film does have a sort of a ""love triangle"", no doubt to please the female audience. The mystery of Hancock is actually the film's most effective selling point and opens up to a lot of potential, it manages to achieve this for a first installment. There is a touch of tragedy in the film's final act as Hancock has to choose and sacrifice. It is a bit predictable but nonetheless it manages to maintain its forward momentum since the groundwork had been carefully laid out. All heroes have a weakness--this one is sort of a fail-safe for god-like beings. That weakness may be a little undefined and underdeveloped but it was interesting enough to get some emotions going.

The special effects are quite impressive. The flights and exploits of Hancock is pure eye-candy as he crushes and destroys property. I especially loved the scene when he stopped a locomotive as it is a clear example of his single-minded purpose with no regard for anything else. The superhuman fight is quite fun to see but it was just too much special effects that it lacked definition of the combatants. I rather expected a more dragged-out fight than a minor display of special effects. The film has some nice touches of humor--that prison scene that involved two inmates is very amusing although a lot far-fetched and unbelievable. One thing I have to say, Hancock has to watch himself carefully when he has sex.

Will Smith has definitely matured as an actor since his ""Fresh Prince"" days. The man can indeed act and while it is the same acting style as in his previous movies, he did fit the character. His performance may not be on par as in ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" but he made best with whatever he had to work with. Charlize Theron and Jason Bateman proves a competent supporting cast; Theron is still as sexy as ever and Bateman is the usual ""nice guy"" with integrity.

Overall, ""HANCOCK"" is a lot of fun. The film is very enjoyable and entertaining; while it does have its flaws, the script managed to keep me interested for its entirety. The effective twist is sort of a tragedy and played a key element on its success. The direction by Peter Berg manages to keep an amount of restraint that I commend him for doing so, since some scenes had the dangerous potential to become heavy-handed. The effective chemistry between its performers and the nicely paced action sequences makes it a fun popcorn film. I am pretty sure there will be a sequel since Hancock's character had just started cooking and if there will be a ""Hancock 2"", consider me all in.

Video/Audio: 2.35 ratio anamorphic widescreen. The image is very good but it looked a little soft on some scenes. I think studios aren't mastering Dvds in High-def for full Picture potential anymore to push the Blu-Ray product. It's a good image but it could have looked a lot better. Maybe it was meant to look this way? The 5.1 Dolby Digital audio is very powerful and fits this kind of movie.
Extras: making of/production notes/seeing the future feature about its storyboard and concepts/Effects concept/backgrounds
The unrated version has an added scene to display Hancock's prowess in bed and contains some more profanity. The added scenes may not add anything significant but it does add a more humorous and gritty feel.

Highly Recommended! [4- Stars]",1227830400,,6187,4.652333028362306
3346707,3,B0013J55B6,"""Hancock"" is two films in one and one of them is much better than the other. Hancock (Will Smith)has super powers but no memory of who he is. He slips into a life of drinking to drown his sorrows--the people he saves don't like him because he seems to screw up every time he saves someone. Luckily Ray Embrey(Jason Bateman) a PR man that Hancock saves decides to save Hancock by making him into a super hero that the people will appreciate. Even Ray's son has taken a shine to Hancock while Ray's
wife Mary (Charlize Theron)appears not to like him.

Director Peter Berg does a nice job with the action sequences and Will Smith continues to prove that he has a lot more to offer dramatically as an actor even in a summer blockbuster like ""Hancock"". The major flaw in ""Hancock"" is the uneven tone of the film. It shifts from an almost satirical film about a misanthropic superhero into a darker, morally complex film by the last third. That wouldn't be a problem but the transition is so sudden its almost jarring.

 Interestingly, the unrated theatrical version hints at the complexity to come much earlier in the film with one key scene that was trimmed probably for ratings reasons. The unrated version plays better than the rated version but it is also less succinct with a handful of scenes that could easily have been cut because of the repetition in them. Director Peter Berg does a pretty good job of juggling all the themes and shifts in tone throughout the film and if he drops the ball on occasion I think it's understandable because ""Hancock"" tries to be two very different films often at the same time. The other issue is that there really isn't a bad guy introduced that provides much of a challenge for Hancock.

The Blu-ray looks exceptional with crisp images and colors that pop. Sony has done a exceptional job of transitioning this from the theater to home video. Audio sounds terrific as well with an active 7.1 mix.

The extras are very good. Although we don't get a commentary track, we do a lot of featurettes that take us behind-the-scenes. Aside from getting both the original theatrical version of the film (which has less bad language and a sexual situation removed that IS pretty amusing and also sad at the same time) and the ""Unrated"" version, we also get a nice mix of featurettes on the production of the film. One observation about the bad language issue--the same result could have been achieved with Hancock being called an ""idiot"" as an ""a-hole"" so the use of the latter seems like an excuse to put teens in the seat and get a PG-13 rating (which the film would have gotten anyway for other reasons). When will Hollywood learn that we don't need to hear people spewing foul language out of characters mouths every 5 minutes (particularly in a superhero film that stars kid friendly Will Smith?). I should note that there is also a single disc edition but, beyond the fact that it doesn't have the ""unrated"" version, I have no idea what special features might be on the disc or missing.

We also get a digital copy of the film (some people will like this extra but I find it useless for the most part) in the second disc. We also get ""Superhumans: The Making of Hancock"" a promo piece on the making of the film. We also get ""Seeing the Future"" a 16 minute featurette that can be viewed either as one featurette or in its individual segments.

Visual effects maestro John Dykstra (""Spider-Man"" and the original visual effects for ""Star Wars: A New Hope"" before Lucas messed with it) takes center stage with ""Building a Better Hero"". ""Bumps and Bruises"" focuses on the action sequences of the film. We also get ""Home Life"" and ""Suiting Up"" which are pretty self explanatory looks at the Embreys and Hancock. Finally actor/director Berg sits in the driver's seat for ""Mere Mortals: Behind the Scenes with ""Dirty Pete'"" focusing on the director's off-beat sense of humor and practical jokes.  Rounding out the extras are a series of previews for ""The House Bunny"" and ""Lakeview Terrace"" among others.

Frankly the extended dramatic scenes drug on too long and a particular humorous scene was horribly misplaced in the second half (the second hand chopping scene) buried in a high-drama ultra-serious segment. The origin of the ""heroes"" was just stupid, oh they're beings that have been referred to as angels or gods and there are only two left who by the way lose their powers and become mortal when together, super-lame.

Hancock is, obviously, a superhero story.  Despite hearing from many disappointed viewers this summer, I held off until the Blu-Ray release was pleasantly surprised.  It has a solid cast that works together to make this world believable enough to be enjoyable.

The video transfer is outstanding.  If you want to show off how good Blu-Ray can look, you may want to add this one to your arsenal.  The audio is quite good, too.

There are some pretty good extras here, too.  I enjoyed the ""Suiting Up"" extra, a short feature about coming up with Hancock's costume.  There are seven featurettes in all, plus the disc offers both the theatrical and unrated versions of the film.  Lastly, there is a digital copy, and it's about my only gripe.

Will Smith is good in the role of our superhero with issues, but he seems one dimensional. If they had only went a little more serious this could have been fantastic. I don't want to pick this film apart because it is a fantasy, action, popcorn movie. I mean really, does it really have to make total sense?

The film is full of funny moments with good performances from Jason Bateman and Charlize Theron. The film is loud, fast paced and full of surprises, that even I didn't see coming. I watched the unrated version and it has about 10 minutes of footage not in the theatrical release. I will be watching the theatrical release soon and add notes if they're worth adding.

The DVD has a fair amount of interesting extras and the transfer in excellent. If your a fan of the film, I would buy the unrated 2 disc as it includes the theatrical version as well. A practice I hope continues, because I hate it when companies don't include the theatrical version on 2 disc unrated releases.

Will Smith is a better actor than he gets credit for.  The balance of the cast is very good, fit their role and work well with him.  The stunts are first rate and fit into the story.  Yes, their is a story of sorts.  While it is more something to hang the stunts on, it fits into the action and holds the movie together.
The unrated DVD is longer and the language is stronger.  Their is nothing upsetting to an adult.  Their isn't anything that a Jr. High Scholler has not heard either.  Not for smaller kids but this is a family film for older kids.",1227744000,2,822,4.1069182389937104
3346715,4,B0013J55B6,"I did not see this in the theater because I am starting to despise the face of Will Smith. The theatrical poster of this film shows a huge (and I mean huge) close-up of his face that I immediately get the sense that he will sing his one-hit-wonder ""I make this look good"".

But, as in all cases, rentals give movies a second life and a second chance. So I will give it the chance it deserves. The opening scenes, I was somewhat skeptical and put off by his character. He was a jerk, totally unlikable, and there was no comedy. Was this supposed to be funny? Was I supposed to like him? Evidently not.

But once we meet the more likable Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), which leads us to his family, things begin to change. Embrey is a PR man who wants to give Hancock's image a face lift because Hancock is a reckless superhero, not to mention a drunk and a jerk - so generally speaking, the public does not like him.

Soon we meet Embrey's wife, Mary (Charlize Theron), and there is an immediate ""something"", but you are never certain what it is. And that is really the hook of the whole movie. It's what keeps it alive. I am not going to give spoilers away here.

What starts out as a drunken superhero movie soon becomes something more mortal than getting the bad guys. The film gets more intimate about relationships than any Spider-Man or Batman movie has yet to touch. I am not saying this movie is better than those, but there is such a strong mythological ring to the story, that I suspect it might be ripped from the pages of of some ancient Greek story. But those Greek stories are about the lives of every human, so they have such relevance to all of us that is timeless.

It is this ""mythological"" quality that I found in the film that makes the film transcend the ordinary superhero film. I don't think everyone will love it or see it in the same way I did, and so I am not saying it is a must see. But, at least from my perspective, I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected.

Two final notes: Will Smith was a likable in the end as he was not in the ""Men In Black mode"" of acting (this does not convince me of how good of an actor he is, but more of just box office appeal - 2 different things). Second, I totally did not recognize Charlize Theron. She is a chameleon. I have more and more respect for her with each movie I see her in.",1227657600,,2343,4.184035476718403
3346716,3,B0013J55B6,"Hancock is a superhero. He's also a raging alcoholic, a complete jerk, and an unkempt recluse.  When he saves the life of a failing public relations expert, he gets the change to reinvent his image.  If only he can surive the humiliation of the leather suit...

""Hancock"" is a unique, interesting take on the superhero genre.  What would it be like to be a superhero?  You would be different from everyone around you; you would be alien, the unknown...basically, not exactly the stereotypical image of a superhero.  Perhaps it's a moot point, but it's certainly something worth exploring within the realm of Hollywood.  Thus, ""Hancock.""  Will Smith is the perfect choice to play this character: He's got the charisma to play the loveable hero (oh dear, I hope I didn't give anything away); the surly ""I don't give a damn ain't I so cool"" attitude to play a drunkard; and the dramatic chops to portray a character conflicted with himself.  Add to this the wonderfully talented Jason Bateman, a great comedic actor whose dramatical nuance is often overlooked (check out ""Juno"" to see how great he can really be).  Bateman's Ray is loveable, pitiable, and admirable, all at the same time.  As for the film's other lead, Charlize Theron...she's a great actress, but she isn't given a whole lot to work with here, especially in the film's first half.  After the twist (which you can see coming a mile away; still, they play it up well enough), she gets to let loose a little more, but we still don't get to see her in all her glory (stop snickering).

The reason I only gave this film three stars...its potential is wasted.  The actors are all talented enough to go there, but the script (or at least the final version of the script, as seen here) holds them back.  Being alone in the world, the only one of your kind, is a dark and haunting concept; the idea of alienated superheroes, forced to face their own hated immortality, is better explored in the graphic novel ""Watchmen,"" which (should) be coming to theaters in 2009.  That is a dark and twisted tale, one that leaves a bitter tase in your mouth.  ""Hancock,"" even with all the talent going into it, winds up being little more than a popcorn flick with a few philosophical ideas that are tossed in there for good measure.  Like I said, it's a shame, because the actors (especially Smith and Bateman) are perfectly capable of going the distance.  If only Hollywood would've taken more of a risk.  They really need to start gambling on Smith; he's a steady draw, and a great actor to boot.  Maybe one day, he'll get the chance to show that an action movie can be more than a mere action movie.  Until then...""Hancock"" is all good fun, and a few good laughs, but it's not what could have been, and that is a shame.",1227657600,10,2765,4.588594704684318
3346717,5,B0013J55B6,"First, the movie was not a bummer as some people said it to be and second it left too many openings in reality to be exact. A Nigh immortal superhumanoid that only gets weaker and becomes a human when he get next to his polar/gender opposite is like trying to put a human spin on GOD.
  Too much unknown unattainable metaphysical elements that baffles the human finite minds. Just buy the doggon DVD/Blu-Ray for crying out loud.  I just think that if such a person/being ever walked/flown the planet in our era they would certainly kick our butts until we were all too scared to even think to call him/her an a-hole.
  I think the scene where he launches the girlie French kid into the sky addreses that fact.  Also I hope I wasn't the only one who caught this but he was going to let the kid die if Ray hadn't delayed him from entering the house.  Goes to showmy point. Also I would like to remark on that little line from That chick who stated, ""You aren't nearly as strong as the US Constitution! Bank on it buddy!""  I can imagine a true drunk pissed off & indifferent superpowered being would fly in with the Constitution roled in hand then shove it down her pompous throat.

3346718,4,B0013J55B6,"When ""Hancock"" was in the theaters, the television promos gave the impression that it was a superhero comedy flick along the lines of ""The Incredibles"". Out-of-favor superhero who's always screwing up his rescues finds himself unwanted and despondent; a fish out of water story.

Though those comedic elements are certainly there - particularly in the first half of the movie - there's actually a whole lot more going on here.

At its core, this is a movie about love and redemption. It's hard to go into much plot detail without getting into spoilers, but many of the same issues are addressed here that were in ""Batman Begins"", though in a style not nearly as dark: alienation, the public's rejection of the central character, his maturation into a new persona.

Will Smith has evolved into quite an accomplished actor, and uses his chops to great effect in this movie. Charlize Theron and Jason Bateman round out the cast very ably.

3346726,1,B0013J55B6,"Some bad movies are fun to watch, such as Ed Wood's quixotically demented works, while other bad movies are vile, odious things, being not only crimes against art, but are also crimes against the human spirit.  `Hancock' is a crime against art, the human spirit, intelligence, and decency, to name just a few.  There is no amusement whatsoever to be gained for anyone from watching this film.  The tragedy is compounded in that 2 A-list stars and a cult-comedy icon somehow were compelled to do this film.

This is a loud, boring and insipid film that does not know whether it intends to be a comedy, action movie, or action comedy.  This is not to say that it is actually funny in any places; it is not, but one can discern that comedy was intended in various places.  The script, if it can be called such, plays out as though an 8-year old recycled the worst works of dead scifi writer L. Ron Hubbard after being overdosed on Children's Tylenol.  There is no plausibility, and no internal consistency in this fictional world, and there are creepy, gross ideas, suggestive of incest.

Perhaps the most odious and disgusting thing about `Hancock' is its overt racism.  Here we have an impossibly strong, invulnerable, flying black man, the most powerful man in the world, who wastes his time drinking on the street and behaving like an idiot, until a white liberal takes an interest in him, shows him how to act polite and dress nice.  Guess what: the white liberal's 1st step in showing Our Hero the path or righteousness is to send Our Hero to do a stretch in jail. And better yet: this black superhero happens to loose his powers (temporarily) if he kisses a certain white woman.

Here is an example of the kind of gross, cheap, juvenile, racist trash being peddled: Our Hero, being miffed at a couple of the other inmates in the jail, literally shoves one man's head up another man's butt.  Yes, this actually happens in the movie, the audience is treated to the sight of one man's head clear up another man's butt.  All the while, the theme music from `Sanford and Son' plays, just to make it perfectly clear that we should be laughing at this funny stuff being done by this whacky black person.

Some people might be tempted to see this film because there are few other films about black superheroes, but every other film about black superheroes is much, much better.  The `Blade' films, for instance.  Better yet, see the new film with Morgan Freeman playing real-life black superhero Nelson Mandela, that one is very highly recommended.",1227571200,4,2544,4.670403587443946
3346727,4,B0013J55B6,"I honestly didn't know what to think of Hancock at first glance.  My original impression was that it looked kind of lame, but there was still something about it that drew me into this long in-development superhero tale.  A mix of superhero action and comedy, Hancock is far from being a traditional superhero tale, which helps the film's cause all the way.  Will Smith stars as the title character: an invulnerable and immortal drunken hero who causes more damage than the crooks and villains he puts behind bars.  Hancock's antics tend to get a little more out of hand than usual when he saves the life of PR man Ray (Jason Bateman), who then seeks out to help the haunted hero repair his image, much to the dismay of his wife Mary (Charlize Theron) who seems to believe that Hancock is a lost cause.  There is much more going on behind the scenes, including a dynamite twist that really picks the film up off the ground just when it begins to start to wear out it's welcome.  Smith is great, Bateman is his usually funny and charming self, and Theron is as good and gorgeous as she usually is.  Director Peter Berg (The Kingdom, Friday Night Lights) manages to nicely orchestrate action sequences, even when there is an over-abundance of CGI.  While the film's ending leaves a little bit to be desired, Hancock ends up being a surprisingly good, and different, superhero flick that has a lot going for it.

3346729,4,B0013J55B6,"I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised by Will Smith's superhero outing as ""Hancock"".  I like Will Smith, especially when he's fun and cocky and carrying around a bit of a nasty edge, but I didn't expect his outing as Hancock to be this much fun.  Despite a certain Disneyesque quality, ""Hancock"" retains a nutty humor that appeals both to my adult self, and to the kid within; it has a wholesome, cheeky naughtiness that is embraced by its star, even as its oddball slapstick and spiffy, eye-crossing special effects will dazzle younger viewers.

The plot revolves around a down-at-heels, sour-puss, drunken bum of a superhero named Hancock.  In order to save his own flagging career, a genial PR guy (winningly played by Jason Bateman) decides to kick-start the reluctant Hancock and change him from an embarrassment despised by millions, back into the indefatigable superhero that he once was.  However, all does not go as well as Bateman plans, as he must first save Hancock from himself before Hancock can save the city from the bad guys.  Also in the cast is Oscar-winner Charlize Theron, who does justice to her role as Bateman's wife, a pragmatic beauty with a few secrets of her own.

While not as dark or thought-provoking as ""The Dark Knight"", or as blow-'em-out-of-the-water spectacular as ""Iron Man"", ""Hancock"" is highly enjoyable superhero entertainment of a lighter kind, and suitable for kids of all ages.",1227571200,,1430,4.933333333333334
3346730,5,B0013J55B6,"The visual effects in this movie are amazing! Here is an article I wrote about them: [...]

3346731,4,B0013J55B6,"Hancock wasn't the superhero movie that changed the genre like the studio's claimed, but it was good, solid entertainment. The theatrical release of the movie was rated PG-13 in order to draw the largest crowd to the box office. What you are getting here is both the R version and the released PG-13 version. The only real difference is ten extra minutes of footage here and there and a good deal more foul language from the Hancock character. Now that we got the ""Unrated"" question out of the way lets get down to the movie.

Hancock is one of those antihero-turned-hero type movies where you see the title character be all antisocial and then eventually learns how to respect others and be respected. Will Smith is definitely a great actor for the role. He gives the character just enough smug attitude without hamming it up. Will had gone a long way from the cut up hero he was in movies like Independence Day and MIB. He also does a good job with the transition of the character going from jerk to hero with all the awkwardness that anybody deals with when trying to change their way of thinking.

The plot progression of Hancock going from zero to hero is impeccable (love the jail time Hancock has to go through). Jason Bateman as Hancock's new PR guy pulls it off with the finesse of being straight man to Smith's antics and the comic foil when Will is playing it straight. Good chemistry with the two. I was surprised at Charlize Theron's performance to the point I didn't really recognize her. I won't say she's Oscar winning material here, but she does play her character right.

Now the story chugs along great up until you get maybe 2/3rd's in when the plot twists come regarding Hancock's origins. Eventually it's ironed out and his whole origin makes some good story sense, but before getting there you have to deal with a big, spectacular and utterly useless fight scene that seems to just be put in to add more action and show off more special effects. When they do finally dispense with the nonsense of that scene things get back on track with what I consider a pretty satisfying conclusion.

The funny thing about this movie is at times you have to just suspend your disbelief farther than normal on a superhero movie in order to let this movie play out some of its jokes. In other words Hancock will do something outrageous and technically impossible just to get a laugh out of the audience. Just roll with it. It's not often and at least they are pretty funny if you let go of the laws of physics, biology and so forth.

The additional footage in this movie boils down to an opening scene with Hancock scaring some girl he tried picking up at a bar, the aforementioned cussing from Hancock (not way too gratuitous... at least not enough to detract from character) and a few little scenes that add some details here and there. No nudie scenes other than Will's butt shot that made the final cut or added violence. Nothing that would ban the movie from theaters at all.

The features on this special edition are... well... okay. Nothing to really write home about. You get over an hour's worth of content spread out over six mini-documentaries and one kinda big one, plus other blu-ray related features and a digital copy for portables. I noticed there are no commentaries on this special edition. That's kinda strange since I don't see why they couldn't just put a microphone in front of the director and some actors and other crew members to make one or two. This is supposed to be the full production version, after all. Here is a breakdown of the featurettes:

On Set Visual Diary - A picture-in-picture view of production you can see while watching the movie if your Blu-Ray player has the profile version 1.1 or better.

Superhumans: The Making of Hancock (approx 13 minutes) - Mainly interviews of the cast and crew, including details on the origin story and how it evolved.

Seeing the Future (approx. 15 minutes) - Pre-visualization sequences for some key scenes.

Building a Better Hero (approx. 15 minutes) - A special effects featurette.

Bumps and Bruises (approx 10 minutes) - Another special effects featurette focussed on some key scenes.

Mere Mortals (approx 3 minutes) - A snipped on director Peter Berg. Supposed to be funny.

Home Life (Approx 11 minutes) - Behind the scenes look at the house sets.

Suiting Up (approx 8 minutes) - Costumes featurette.

BDLive - For BR players with 2.0 profile or better. Connects you to a special Sony website for trailers and possibly additional content later on.

D-Box equipped - For those people with those crazy chairs that move around with the movie.

All of the featurettes save for the picture-in-picture stuff is all 1080p. It's getting old seeing these studios make several little making of documentaries when they can just put together a single big documentary covering all of the details. I guess they prefer many little ones because it looks better on the back of the packaging when it shows a lot of features. Be forewarned that those features are pretty short.

Being a Blu-Ray release you can expect full 1080p resolution. From what I have heard the high def really stands out in the scenes that have a slower pace while the crazy action scenes (like that useless one I mentioned before) don't really benefit from the treatment. Audio is Dolby TrueHD 5.1 lossless and I hear that while it's not going to top the best reference movies out there it's still an amazing experience.

Hancock is definitely a worthwhile superhero movie that takes a different slant on the genre, but doesn't turn it on its ear. Any superhero fan should be able to have a lot of love for this movie. Action fans will get a kick out of it too as well as comedy and sci-fi fans. As long as you can suspend your disbelief a little more than normal for the sake of humor and can forgive an awkward scene or two Hancock is the movie for you. This BR edition? Well it has the most features on any at this time. They may pull a double dip in a year or two and add some extras. Then again BDLive may future-proof that purchase for you.",1227484800,31,6094,4.6103416435826405
3346732,3,B0013J55B6,"As far as the genre of traditional superhero stereotypes goes, HANCOCK (I would rate 3 & 1/2 stars) is different to most.  With plenty of imperfections and an attitude to match, HANCOCK is a character that appears to have lost his way.  At times this coincides with the movie plot also losing its way, but that may have more to do with the screenplay being rewritten a couple of times and also being shelved for a while before production finally started.  I don't believe Will Smith's acting has anything to do with that shortcoming.

In terms of entertainment value, I enjoyed it, and so did my family - with some qualifiers; it's important to not take the movie too seriously, and I wouldn't recommend it for kids under 11-12yrs.  It is meant to be different, and is not easy to classify into comedy, romance, or just plain action!  Yes at times HANCOCK over promised and could have been better and explored some of the main character's past a bit more.  Maybe an opportunity gone begging - but still plenty of other material that does deliver some unique and unexpected scenarios.  HANCOCK reminds me in a way of the original Stargate SG1 movie, which could have been so much better but all was not lost when it was turned into an incredibly successful TV series.  HANCOCK is still good value - plenty of laughs.",1227398400,,1315,4.609442060085837
3346733,4,B0013J55B6,"Hancock (Will Smith) is not your garden variety superhero.  He's more like your garden variety bum.  He spends most of his day sleeping on benches and drinking booze.  When duty calls, he awakens from his drunken coma, bottle in hand to stop the wrong-doers.  If there's a lesson to be learned here, it's not to fight crime drunk because it costs millions in property damage and public outrage.  Luckily for Hancock, somebody wants to help the poor guy.  Cue Ray (Jason Batemen) a publicist who vows to change the superhero's image in exchange for Hancock's saving his life.

The first half of ""Hancock"" is chock full of crude humor and the superhero doing his worst at being the best.  It's thoroughly entertaining and will provide plenty of laughs.  The second half of ""Hancock"" is about the superhero in the spotlight, but this time he is depicted as a ""true"" superhero and the public begins to recognize him as a positive figure.  The second half is what makes or breaks the movie for viewers.  Why?  Because of the unexpected twist in the plot.

While I won't reveal the plot twist, I will say that it will leave people feeling divided.  Some will probably think it is incredibly clever and others will believe it's sheer silliness.  In my opinion, it's both clever and silly at the same time.  Either way you look at it, ""Hancock"" is an original movie...the only one of its kind.  The only superhero movie that does not have to be strict to a source, i.e. a comic book, to appease fans.  It is also extremely entertaining.  Everything from the CGI to the performances make this movie interesting and above all, unique.  ""Hancock"" is definitely a movie worth watching.",1226880000,45,1673,4.703448275862069

Hancock's life and reputation are given a solid public relations redo and all seems to be OK again until he meets Ray's wife (Charlize Theron).  ""Hancock"" is fun until a rather startling revelation about halfway through derails the film and takes it off in an entirely different -- and not entirely successful -- direction.  Smith is his usual charming self and the movie features some cool CGI effects, but it doesn't hold up as one of the actor's best efforts.

A man in public relations takes notice of him after he is saved by the hero and changes his image into something the public can get behind. And that is just the surface of the deep and engaging story. I would happily recommend this movie over any of the Xmen, Spiderman, Batman, Iron Man, Superman and Hulk Film films if you want to really understand the mythology that goes into actual comic books and be entertained with a genuine story.

Jason Bateman plays an idealistic ad exec who wants to champion Hancock's cause after being saved himself. Jason's wife is Charlize Theron who has superpowers herself she is trying to keep under wraps. Despite some fun visuals and a few laughs, this movie is only so-so, and really doesn't succeed. The movie wasn't very well framed: the beginning wants to be a comedy and the end has some very dark scenes - too dark I feel for what's gone before. The characters are very thinly drawn, especially when Theron's character is suddenly flinging Will about with an anger that is as yet unexplained, the explanation being rather flimsy when it does come. The plot is rather thin as well and we don't really care much about any of the characters: Hancock himself was the most sympathetic, and there wasn't really enough there to make us care all that much, though you wanted to. It was a neat concept, however, and there were some genuine laughs in the beginning, so I'll give it an extra star - though if you rent or buy it, I think you'll have a better experience if you stop watching about halfway through.",1223856000,7,1475,4.633587786259542

It's got some humor scattered here and there, with a couple of really funny moments. I found the acting and script were well done enough to pull me in, and to get me to care about Hancock and the other central characters. The story also had some interesting and unexpected twists. Will Smith was great as usual, and as always, likable, regardless of Hancock's roughness. Of course there were some great action sequences with effective special effects.

3346752,3,B0013J55B6,"Los Angeles has both a crime fighter and a sullen, alcoholic troublemaker on its hands and they are the same person.  Hancock (Will Smith), endowed with most of the powers usually attributed to Superman, will pitch in to save lives, rescue people, and snuff out freeway gun battles, but his services come with a price.  Whether it be shattered corners of high rise buildings, gutted asphalt, train car pile ups, overturned yachts, or upended automobiles, Hancock's help comes with a lack of regard for the incidental havoc his efforts always cause.  He's cost the city millions of dollars in property damage, he has countless civil suits against him pending, and the average man on the street is sick and tired of his arrogant lack of regard for proper civility.
 Hancock's grubby attire suggests homelessness, though he does have digs in a rundown shack in the Hollywood hills.  He drinks too much, is looked down on by children, and appears to be a very unhappy man.
 When he saves the life of goodhearted public relations man Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), Ray sees how Hancock is vilified by the very people who would otherwise be thanking him and invites him home for dinner.  Ray's young son takes a liking to the scruffy superhero, but his wife, Mary (Charlize Theron), eyes him suspiciously.  We don't know why, but that will be revealed in the film's second half.
 To repay Hancock for saving his life, Ray sets out to do a complete PR makeover for him, coaching him on how to respect property and graciously acknowledge the work of traditional law enforcement, and giving him a sleek, cool-looking outfit to replace his booze-soaked tatters.  He also convinces Hancock to take responsibility for his actions.  Hancock goes along with all of Ray's suggestions, reluctantly at first, and sees his image changing in the eyes of the public.  Collateral damage connected to his crime fighting is eliminated, he becomes a media darling instead of punching bag, and he turns into a mensch.
 Smith carries off his role well, shifting from mostly low-key comedy in the first half, with special effects having a field day, to a more introspective performance when we learn more about his origins and why he is what he is.  He plays the awkward, more likable, newly minted superhero like a teenager on a first date:  tentative, unsure of himself, diffident.  This contrasts with Hancock's casual disregard for property early on when he saves the day.  Smith usually exudes charm with that sunny smile of his, but he manages to suppress the charm considerably in the film's early scenes, since we have to see Hancock as the burden to society he's become.  Hancock is not a pleasant fellow, and Smith portrays this effectively.
 Theron adds considerable drama to a role that defies clich.  Far from the charming stay-at-home mom, her Mary is a strong-willed, intelligent woman and a very important ingredient in the plot, not mere window dressing.  The chemistry between Theron and Bateman is strong and you believe them as a happily married couple, and her scenes with Smith are especially touching.
 Bateman is a fine actor who has been showcased recently in some varied roles.  He's always in top form and consistently turns in top quality work, whether it`s as the adoptive father in ""Juno,"" the drugged-up lawyer in ""Smokin' Aces,"" or the cornerstone of the dysfunctional Bluth family on TV's ""Arrested Developent.""  In ""Hancock,"" he's playing a nice guy, but does so as far from the Ward Cleaver mold as possible.  His Ray is thoughtful, principled, and basically decent -- qualities Hancock would do well to emulate -- yet we sense there is a real, passionate man beneath the inherent goodness.
 Director Peter Berg has fashioned a neat twist on the superhero movie.  He addresses many of the questions that viewers always ponder in less eccentric superhero films, such as who cleans up the mess once the bad guys have been stopped?  What does the superhero do when he's not superhero-ing?  And why should the public automatically swoon for a man with vast powers if they don't like him?  For those reasons, the film bristles with originality and keeps the viewer involved throughout.  Berg is also successful at presenting a big surprise halfway through that alters the tone of ""Hancock"" from comedy to a more dramatic mode.
 Rated PG-13 for some special-effects violence and mildly impolite language, ""Hancock"" is a very entertaining film, combining drama, science fiction, and comedy.  Its messages of tolerance and contributing to one's community are refreshing and affirm that good writing can both entertain and leave the viewer with something to think about.",1221955200,5,4666,4.963963963963964
3346753,2,B0013J55B6,"...was the reaction I had by the time I finished watching the movie. As much as I have a distaste for using stupid internet acronyms seriously, that's quite literally how I felt.

The movie had an interesting premise, in a superhero who is a moody, drinking misanthrope with a particular twitch-spot for being called an asshole.

Very early on Hancock's path crosses with That Guy (Jason Bateman's character, the PR guy, whose name is completely forgettable) and they start trying to change him. Maybe 20 minutes into the movie or less, Hancock goes to prison to show people he won't flaunt the law, and to have people clamoring to have him back when crime skyrockets.

The majority of the movie's fun happens within the first half, with scenes covered in the trailer (such as tossing a beached whale onto a sailboat) and some new ones not seen in the trailer (Hancock half-naked, his clothes having been burnt off from putting out a fire, cutting in front of kids in front of an ice cream truck and snatching some ice cream for himself), but these are all covered mostly in YouTube spots while That Guy shows Hancock how people don't like him.

After he's changed to be more decent, it gets touchy and warm and Hancock is a good guy after all.

Then comes the part that had been built up without subtlety... and spoilers follow.

It was rather overt that Mary (Charlize Theron) was going to be involved with Hancock, especially when the director goes out of his way to show her face in a closeup whenever he appears near her for several seconds longer than normal. Then comes a post-party scene, in which he basically corners her in a kitchen and tries to kiss her. Then she throws him into the refrigerator and send both crashing out into the street.

Oh ya, that's right. She's a superhero thing, too.

Then starts the whole ""lolwut?"" moment of the film,, as they try to have her trying to explain to Hancock, her husband, and all of us the whole deal, and fails quite miserably. The story she tells is some mess of them being some sort of godly creatures that were created by GOD (though it is PC never mentioned) in pairs, and that they've lived for like as long as the Bible says earth has existed.. a few thousand years.

Quite frankly, that's only my best-guess summarization of the mess of words thrown at us to see what would stick---in the end, it doesn't even matter what they are, as the point they drive home with brutal redundancy is that if the two of them are close by each other, they both lose their powers and become mortal, which is why Hancock lost his memory, because every time they get too close to each other in history, something bad happens and they have to depart, until one time in the late 20s when Hancock got amnesia (and a story of how he tried to sign out from the hospital, not knowing who he was, and a nurse asked him for his ""John Hancock"", as in signature).

The story doesn't seem to change, but they repeat it so many times in so many different ways that it throws people off, as they start thinking ""wait, they're destined to be together"", then ""wait, they can't be together or they both become mortal and die"", then ""wait, they were built together by nameless-god"", then ""wait, they weren't meant to be together"", then ""wait, they're bound by fate to always be together"" and so on and so on until you really don't care anymore and you just want someone to die just to change the pace.

The entirety of the movie's second-half plot no longer deals with any typical ""good guy vs bad guy"" or ""hero must overcome"" archetype, as a band of baddies escaping from jail try to kill Hancock become so unimportant that even Hancock doesn't spare a second glance at the TV when their breakout is announced on the news.

The entire focus is around explaining, then re-explaining, then convoluting the entire concept behind these two ""godly"" beings to a point where their explanations run into gaping plot-holes, the biggest one being: If Hancock's been living in LA long enough to become a household name, and staying in their house around her for several weeks before finding her out, why didn't he or Mary lose any of their powers being in the same city? Considering how she not only tells him to not see her family ever again, but to leave the entire city, and how Hancock starts losing his powers when he is very far away from her, it's completely nonsensical that he only starts to lose his powers AFTER she mentions it.

The ending is also nonsensical, as Hancock had earlier in the movie ended up losing his powers when he is shot in a liquor-store hold-up, who knows how far away from Mary's house, and when he and Mary are in the hospital, he starts immediately regaining his powers when he exits the hospital and starts putting a few meters' distance between them.

Ultimately, the entire second half of the movie resembled a nonsensical mess of a plot-hole big enough to fit the moon through and a complete lack of actual plot to drive the story other than Hancock's whole ""should I leave the city so I can be a superhero or should I stay for... some reason never explained in the movie"" Because the movie never really does explain why he should/would stay in LA after learning all this... it's not like he fell in love with Mary after his amnesia, and despite all of this revelation, Mary stays married to That Guy and Hancock leaves anyway for their own good.

3346758,4,B0013J55B6,"Everybody hates John Hancock because he has superpowers. The concept of Will Smith as a superhero every citizen of the city dislikes is brilliant, but its execution is not always so. ""Hancock"" is definitely entertaining because it is Will Smith after all, but there is something missing in the slick direction of Peter Berg (""The Kingdom"").

""Hancock"" is an action comedy, or comedy action. It is not a mystery novel, but considerable part of its eventful story should remain untold. All I can say is in the film's first half the director effectively infuses enough humor into his storytelling to keep the film's serious tone in check. The opening sequence shows our hero Hancock flying unsteadily over the city of Los Angels, chasing three criminals in a car. The three guys soon find that the man is not only a superhero; he is drunk. You don't mess with a drunken superhero because the results are predictably catastrophic.

A failed PR man Ray (Jason Bateman) offers Hancock a chance to be a ""real"" superhero. I should not reveal Ray's plan here; his idea may not be brilliant, but certainly something that Ray, a family man, but not a shrewd businessman, would think of. Sadly Bateman's character is rather one-dimensional. His wife Mary played by Charlize Theron fares much better, being more layered. In what way she is ""layered,"" you have to see the film for yourself. But perhaps you already know it. Even so, there are some funny scenes in the kitchen waiting for you.

You may not like the change of tone the film goes through in wrapping up the story, ""Hancock"" stops self-mocking and genre-subverting and it starts to take itself seriously. The film so far has shown only sketchy rules about the superhero's ability, but the film's final chapter suddenly introduces another set of rules to the film's world. The transition from one tone to another looks a bit abrupt and the narrative is rushed at times.

For all these flaws, ""Hancock"" is fun thanks to the slick direction of Peter Berg and effective performance of Will Smith as Hancock. As I said before, it is an enjoyable ride. Hancock is not trying to be a Batman even though sometimes I think the recent Batman films are actually doing the same thing in a different way.",1220227200,,2240,4.765463917525773

This is not the case with Hancock. The flying sequences are well done but still look drawn and put together. There is one excellent scene where Hancock saves the day and the camera curtails around him showing the scene all in one shot. Jason Bateman is very convincing and really adds to the movie with his performance. If only the same could've been said about Charlize Theron.

Because the film kept jumping and looping and swirling all over the shop, watching the movie on the big screen just made her feel motion sick and I have to admit by the end my stomach was feeling a little unsettled too.

3346761,4,B0013J55B6,"HANCOCK, starring Will Smith, Jason Bateman, and Charlize Theron, is not what you expect from your average superhero movie.  While the title character, John Hancock, can fly, does have super strength, and is immortal, he is also drunk, rude, and (to quote the movie many, many times) a genuine ""a-hole"".  Yet Hancock still feels drawn or, perhaps, compelled to save the world and to be a hero, whether he wants to or not.  It is a fresh take on an old genre, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

HANCOCK is full of humor, action, and special effects.  I have issues with the editing and camera work in a few places - a lot of the action shots are purposefully jerky and blurred, which can cause eye strain, headaches, and possible motion sickness in some people (including my husband!).  I really love how the script paid attention to most of the laws of physics.  For example, when Hancock takes off and lands, large portions of the street are destroyed.  The special effects are excellent for the most part and added into the film quite seamlessly.

Will Smith, Jason Bateman, and Charlize Theron are all terrific in their respective roles - believable and sympathetic.  Even though this movie does not take itself too seriously, you do care very much about these characters, and you do get drawn into their plights. And you do know that Will Smith will save the world again, as he does every summer.

HANCOCK is thoroughly entertaining, and highly recommended for fans of superheroes, Will Smith, action films, special effects, humor, and anyone who just wants to have fun.",1218844800,,1569,4.774074074074074

The special effects were especially brilliant.  The movie wouldn't have been any good whatsoever without them.  There were so many times throughout the movie I was awestruck at the crispness and accuracy of the special effects.  Truly, truly brilliant, and it made the film stand out.

The storyline was good, but inconsistant.  I don't want to give the movie away, but several key aspects of the storyline just didn't make any sense whatsoever.  I don't know if this was intentional or not, but it didn't impress me, and as we talked out of the theatre, it's the first thing we mentioned.  ""Did you understand why......?  Nope!""

3346763,5,B0013J55B6,"I took some time to see Hancock when it opened at one of the Landmark theaters in my neighborhood. I had not read any reviews or done anything that might give away the story. I enjoy Will Smith and Charlize Theron, though I didn't even know she was in it. I knew the cast and that worked.

After the first few minutes I realized it has some Shakespearean farce to it. I don't mind that having studied English literature, majoring in it and taking the requisite courses on Shakespeare. The farce may bother contemporary audiences. Now that I have read some of the reviews, I realize that professional reviewers should have gone to college or at least read the cliff notes on successful literary formats.

Will Smith did an admirable job of acting as usual. Having followed his career unwittingly, his acting has evolved. He's starting to become more actor and less celebrity. He's a minimalist and brings it off well. When he worked in this role he created plot with his eye motion and posture. He didn't need much dialog. That impressed me significantly.

Charlize can act. She doesn't have to act much because her looks stun. She's matured physically and that doesn't overshadow her acting. Cast her in just about any role and it seems rare that you would notice her art. She's no Jody Foster when it comes to perfection of acting as an art form. You can actually see Jody. It's difficult to see Charlize.

Hancock is a comic book story. The production works in that context and works well. The reviewers I have read forgot the genera. They didn't get that in its context, the performance of Will Smith met the criteria of outstanding. Charlize either walked through her part, which is her prerogative or the director had to work hard.

I give this movie a 5 because it's funny, enjoyable and has the elements of drama. The bank robbery sequence is a remarkable piece of work. It got me.",1218240000,,1888,4.623880597014925

This is a reading of the film, not a review of its entertainment value.  Hancock can solve problems in the world.  Not only crime problems (although we only see that kind here) but bigger ones.  Does he want to?  At the beginning, it seems not.  The same happens with the all powerful companies that Jason Bateman's character is trying to convince to donate something to the world.  They can do things to make a better life for everybody.  They simply don't want to.  They only care about themselves.  That's how capitalism works, you will say.  Ok, right.  But we have Hancock now.  He is here to stay, and at the film's end he is on the brink of taking his godlike status to hearth.  The bad guys in this film are not the petty criminals, but the corporations that laugh at the idea of giving up a (probably small) part of their profits for the rest of us.  If Hancock can fly to the moon, he can also cause a big change on the way things are conducted on this planet.  And that conclusion can only be found in the world of this film, not in ""Iron Man""'s entrepreneurship, and not in the sad, sad world of equally ""bored rich guy"" Batman.  Hancock can secure ""order and progress"" (what seems is Batman's motto) but he also can change that order.  It received three stars from me because certain effects are overused, the back-story could have been expanded, and the consequences of Hancock's existence for the world are not explored.  The plot scratched the surface, but that is better than empty discourses about ethics, values, and chaos (you know about what movie I'm talking about, right?).  So sequel please?

The first half, in which we meet a drunken rogue Smith is a fun and original caricature of many of our summer blockbuster cliches. He's a first, this asocial disaffected superman in bermuda shorts. The special FX are convincing, if not amazing. Smith snugly fits the role, pulls off the usual black thang with the sinuous savoir faire we have come to expect of him.

Second half, however, tanks. Lame, sluggish, discombobulated -- and that's being nice because it's a Will Smith movie. Theron is frittered on a nonsensical presence. There's even the token shy kid hugging a dinosaur. Tears are meant to well up in our eyes, but I am not much for wet popcorn.

Somewhere along the way a deeper theme seemed to peep out and give us a ray of hope for a direction in which this endeavor could have gone: the universal incompatibility of altruism and power.

Hancock saves his sorry bum from an improbable doom, with only a few megabucks of collateral damage. As a result, Ray takes on the sacred duty of becoming Hancock's image consultant.

He gets that anchor only after he stops a speeding train barreling down the tracks into a traffic jam. Without him, the train would have killed failed PR man Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman). Naturally Ray appreciates Hancock, even if all the owners of other wrecked cars, and the engineer of the over-turned train do not.

Jason sets about repairing Hancock's reputation by suggesting he do some time, taking responsibility for the massive damage caused by his previous heroics. While he is an inmate, Hancock is suddenly missed. Crime begins to spike. He's needed.

Ray Embrey is a corporate PR consultant who's struggling to sell his All-Heart logo which represents companies banding together to try and change the world. While on his way home, Ray is caught on the train tracks and is faced with an oncoming freight train. At the last minute Hancock steps in and saves Rays life, but it's at a cost of a couple of million dollars. The public turn on Hancock for the mess he's made but Ray steps up and defends Hancock. After being taken home by him Ray offers to help Hancock become a better man and be the superhero he's destined to be. Hancock decides that in order to make his life better he must take Ray up on his offer. Before he can become the superhero he's destined to be, he must first go to prison to pay for the collateral damage caused by Hancock's negligence.

This has received a lot of criticism by people saying it seems to lose its way at about the half way point of the movie. I have to agree, but that doesn't mean it becomes a bad movie because of it. It started off as a comedy and seemed to end as a fantasy drama. The action scenes made up for the change as they put most recent comic book movies to shame. Along with stunning special effects and at times very witty and what would be called adult humour, they blend together well to make some spectacular scenes. I can't really say too much about the biggest action sequence as it gives away what becomes the focal point of the whole movie, just know that it's awesome.

This is Will Smiths 7th number one movie and is something that he should be immensely proud of. Hancock is also a film that has furthered the cause of naming Will Smith as one of the most diverse actors in the industry. I have loved all his movies to date, and Hancock is no exception. If you're a fan of comic book movies, action movies or just a general fan of Will Smith, then I promise you will love this.",1216512000,4,2304,4.291954022988506
3346774,5,B0013J55B6,"In the same way contemporary ""graphic novels"" are not the comic books of 1950, Hancock is not a superhero-movie like Chistopher Reeves' Superman of the 1970s & 80s.

Hancock is the graphic novel version of an immortal, physically invulnerable, superstrong, flying madman.  His physical attributes outfit him for hero status, but his mental & emotional instability don't.

As a non-category movie, Hancock almost became a non-starter.  If it weren't for Will Smith's univeral appeal -- it probably would have been.  But as a movie-going public, we know that we will pretty much always be entertained by this guy.  And it turns out to be true.  In what is ultimately a tragic-hero role, we are entertained.  We laugh at his super alcoholism.  We laugh at his super social failings.  We laugh at his super amnesia and his super bad judgement.

But we also recognize that he didn't put on the suit the way Clark Kent did -- for truth, justice, and the American Way.  He wasn't looking for his 15 minutes of fame, or a place in the DC Hall of Fame.  He was wallowing just like Joe-down-the-street wallows.  That he happens to be able to fly is almost irrelevent except for its comic value.

While Superman and Batman are part of our collective All-American mythos, Hancock (with his all-too-American name) really isn't.  Hancock is a representative of the more global ""we're all cut from the same cloth"" religion.  Hancock is the flipside of Smith's role in Independence Day -- the American hero who saves the world.  If you didn't read it at the time, you need to know that most of the world snorted a good laugh at our cinematic arrogance over that one.  By the time Independence Day came out, our military supremacy, and America-saves-the-world cocky-ness were both wearing thin.  The idea that only we, in the bowels of Area 51, could come up with a plan to rescue all those other poor, blundering slobs in Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa, and South American was the biggest ego-folly of the century, and the biggest joke of that otherwise fireworks show movie.

Hancock is completely devoid of the cocky American attitude.  The only sign of even pro-American heroism is in the REALLY heroic goodness of Jason Bateman's character who sets about to help Hancock out of the American gutter.  What Hancock does have, finally, is humility and self sacrifice -- far better commodities to be pushing as super-heroic.

For those indulging in super-hero bashing -- you wern't watching the movie you paid to see.  You were watching for the movie you expected to see.  Which is sad, really.  If you'd been paying attention, you'd have seen a graphic novel onscreen about what America needs to be to reclaim its super-hero status.  But since that doesn't involve bellowing super-music, or CGI'd miracles, it might be too subtle for some.",1216252800,8,2825,4.865828092243187
3346775,4,B0013J55B6,"Hancock is a movie that intrigued me when I first saw the previews.  The premise is that Hancock (Will Smith) is a 'person' with superhero powers.  Rather than being our normal clean cut hero, Hancock is a drunkard and a little wanton with the material around him (call him Chaotic Good for those who know D&D, working for the greater good, but doing it his way).  After the initial chase scene (with some good stuff done by Hancock), Hancock saves a man (Ray) who makes a change in his life (Ray is a public relations person who sees the benefit of improving Hancock's image).  To improve Hancock's image, Ray has Hancock be accountable for what he's done, confront himself, and try working with others (like complementing them when they've done the best they can).

My Likes:
An interesting look a characters (Hancock and the people around him).  Will Smith is interesting with this role.  He's not the clean cut Hero you see so many times.  Matter of fact, he's something of an anti-hero (at least in the beginning).  I've always had a weakness for the anti-hero because they show so much more about humans.  In this case, we learn (later in the story) that love is the cause of the anti-hero character.  I was also fascinated how they turn Hancock from an anti-hero to a hero.  The transition is where the story is the strongest where we see Hancock wanting to be the anti-hero but desiring the hero role.  This is best shown when the story asks the question on which type of love is most important; romantic or taking care of those you love.

My Dislikes:
The major dislike is the main villain; he's way to two dimensional.  I realize that they needed to have a villain that would challenge Hancock, however this villain was weak.  Lex Luther from the Superman movies was better than this guy.  I firmly believe that this could have been handled much more gracefully with a minor villain getting out of jail and attempting to do something.  Instead they gave us a villain that's 'intelligent' but not really.  He's predictable with his attempt on Hancock and a waste of airtime (in my opinion).

The Rating:
A good 4 star movie.  Will Smith does a great job, Jason Bateman is good as Ray, and Charlize Theron is also good (there's a nice surprise I won't ruin).  If you're going to this movie, entertainment should be your first focus.  A secondary focus is to look at the characters and see how important love is.  Don't go looking for the meaning of the world or an empty action flick where every minute is full of action.  There is some swearing, nominal blood, and lots of gun shots, however the timeless story it has is interesting (at least for me).  A good movie for the family (we had kids 8 and up with us).",1216080000,3,2721,4.5473251028806585
3346776,4,B0013J55B6,"Hancock, wasn't as good as I had hoped it would be, maybe it wasn't as funny as it could have been but on the other hand Hancock was a lot better than it could have been as well. Will Smith continues to be the true king of all media, he is believable as a character no matter how unlikely the scenario.  And to be sure this is a ridiculous scenario, but no more so than that of any ""Super Hero"" tale. If you can suspend belief to agree that there is such a thing as a Super Hero, (some-one with such extraordinary abilities) then it isn't hard to accept that such a person might have character flaws  (Don't we see that in virtually every person with extraordinary abilities)?

So for me, I kind of liked this is a metaphorical study (I have been accused of reading too much into things). In 1979, in a class at the MTC by BYU, I heard a teacher say something that has always stuck with me ""They never care how much you know, until they know how much you care"" Sometimes, I have found, that people will act like they don't care what you do for them unless they like you.  That is until they really need what you do for them, (of course then they may still resent that you are the one that saved them).  This is the real story of Hancock for me.  Now the question is... Is a high budget comedy action movie the best vehicle for that lesson? Probably not; But what is the best? I have no idea.
Now the real problem with the film is the secondary plot, about the nature and origin of the superpower. Did that work? No it did not.  Other than to express the loneliness of Hancock, it detracted from every other aspect of the film.  So a movie that started pretty good (for me), ended up just being an okay way to spend an afternoon with my sweetheart.

Despite his generic-sounding name, John Hancock is not your average, run-of-the-mill reluctant superhero; he's  a reluctant superhero with a drinking problem and anger management issues.  Disheveled and unshaven in his appearance - and equally rude, crude and belligerent in his demeanor - Hancock lives by himself in a broken down trailer on the outskirts of L.A., a self-appointed outcast, for all intents and purposes, from the society around him.  Alternately either inebriated or nursing a hangover, Hancock seems to have as little use for other people as they have for him.  For even when he's out and about thwarting crime and rescuing the innocent, he's doing so more out of a sense of duty to his superhero DNA than any overwhelming love for humanity.  Plus, his antics usually result in so much collateral damage to any buildings and motor vehicles that happen to be in his vicinity that the ungrateful citizens of the city would just as soon he leave them to their own devices and find some other metropolis that might be more amenable to his services.  One day, however, he saves the life of Ray Embrey, an image consultant who believes he can turn the public's perception of Hancock around if only the superhero will allow him to work his magic on him.  And perhaps, along the way, Ray will also be able to somehow reach that untapped vein of goodness residing at Hancock's core.

Directed by Peter Berg, ""Hancock"" deserves kudos for at least attempting to inject some new life into a genre that seems well on its way to cannibalizing itself out of existence through tiresome repetition and massive overkill.  It tries for a slightly more intimate experience by concentrating on Hancock's all-too-mortal weaknesses and by not having him go up against one of those arch villains that come as part of the standard package with the genre (Hancock has enough internal demons to wage battle against to have much time left over for anything else, I suppose).  Unfortunately, after coming up with a fairly original and promising premise, the filmmakers let it get away from them through a combination of unfocused storytelling, gear-grinding tone changes, and CGI work that seems a trifle on the substandard side for an action film of this size and scope.  Part ""My Fair Lady,"" part ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith,"" part ""The Pursuit of Happyness,"" and part whatever-else-they`ve-managed-to-throw-into-the-mix, the Vincent Ngo/Vince Gilligan screenplay wanders all over the map before finally settling into the slushiest, most rheumy-eyed superhero finale this side of ""Spiderman III""  (though let me just state right up front that ""Hancock"" is still miles above that fiasco).  That's a shame, too, since Will Smith is as amiable and likable as ever, while Charlize Theron, Jason Bateman and adorable little Jae Head (from TV's ""Friday Night Lights"") are equally appealing in their supporting roles.

""Hancock"" is not a bad movie really, just one that feels halfhearted and half-baked, earning it a Gentleman's C+ in the final analysis.",1215993600,4,3038,5.072289156626506
3346778,4,B0013J55B6,"I find myself in complete disagreement with the critics and their take on HANCOCK, Will Smith's (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Am-Legend/dp/B0013FDM7E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Am Legend</a>) latest Summer release. I'd heard all kinds of drastic problems with Hancock, which kept me away from the theater. Most notably that the latter half of the film sank it to obscure and muddy waters, and thus made it a bomb. Again, I couldn't disagree more.

If you're looking for the standard Hollywood fodder and its take on superheroes, then I might see where you could run into some snags. But if you're looking for a bit of a twist on the superhero image, then you're in for a treat.

Anybody who watches TV or has gone to the movies in the past few months knows Hancock's premise: a drunken superguy (Smith) is lost amongst humanity. He knows not where he came from, nor how he's supposed to fit in with people who are so different from himself. He tries to do good, but more often than not does millions of dollars of damage in the process, incensing the Los Angeles population. Roads tore up. Highway signs obliterated. Monuments defaced. Train cars derailed. It's all a bit much for our wayward (and intoxicated) hero. Until one day he meets up with Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Smokin-Aces/dp/B000O77SF4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Smokin' Aces</a>). Hancock saves Ray's life in that infamous train scene that many of you have probably seen in the trailers. What results is a friendship of sorts thanks to Ray's chosen profession (pubic relations). Convinced that he can clean-up Hancock's messy image, Ray convinces the superman to ease up and fit in. In the meantime, he suggests that Hancock go to prison for his many warrants, and Hancock eventually agrees. The idea for this is twofold. First is that it'll keep Hancock out of trouble (with the exception of one episode of cranial-rectumitis); second is that the crime rate in L.A. will go up and people will demand his return.

Intermixed with this is Ray's family and how they interact with Hancock. Ray's little boy Aaron (Jae Head) is lovingly appreciative of Hancock, and this helps show cracks in Hancock's otherwise indifference toward ...everything. But more interestingly is how Ray's beautiful wife Mary (Charlize Theron,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-the-Valley-of-Elah/dp/B0011V7PSC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In the Valley of Elah</a>) deals with Hancock's sudden arrival. Not giving away too much, I will say that this surprise ...well ...surprised me in a good way.

The story arc is excellent in that the focus is never on Hancock's superpowers but on the man himself and how they affect him and those around him. It is this ""human"" element that shows director Peter Berg's ability to take a solid action film and put its focus squarely where it belongs: on the people, not the powers or the special effects (although both of these are done very well). And speaking of story arcs ...

It was refreshingly revolting to watch the ""a-hole"" comment that Hancock so loathes come full-circle, right up to the very ending credits in the film. I was laughing myself silly at the end (Hint: stay until the credits are nearly finished rolling).

Comments about the ""funny first half"" and the ""serious second half"" of the film just didn't jive with me as a criticism. The film had laughs throughout, with spikes in dramatic flair (appropriately) and some nice doses of science fiction/fantasy that held a cohesive whole.

Perhaps I'm prejudiced because of a few insider things that I know about Mr. Berg, but putting that aside, I've found that almost all the film's he's directed to be very human (I'm being repetitive, I know, but bear with me a moment). From&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friday-Night-Lights/dp/B00005JNEW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friday Night Lights</a>&nbsp;and it's focus on the members of the team and not the sport itself to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Kingdom/dp/B000Y7WGOW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Kingdom</a>, which showed us the internal struggles of the war in Iraq and not the war itself, Berg has a good eye for what makes cinema an effective medium. And the people seem to agree with him, even if the critics -- on this one -- do not (coming in at a cool 37% approval rating).

Will Smith's traditional summer blockbuster hero busts a lot more than a few blocks, but the movie winds up a little short of super.

The special effects are outstanding, but Jason Bateman's performance is average, Charlize Theron doesn't try very hard, and the title role seems more suited to some other actor rather than a proven summer-hit mega star like Smith.  In the second half in particular, ""Hancock"" sometimes seems more like a Nicholas Cage role, which should tell you what I thought of it.

Still, Smith makes the movie worth watching, if only for the great first half, that tight black costume and the aforementioned special effects.

In summary: Super Smith, not so super story, superb stunts.

This movie was incredible, it's actually the first movie I've ever wanted to go see for a second time in a movie theatre. Will Smith is such a great actor, and at first I kind of thought the movie was going to be pretty stupid the whole way through, but there are a lot of surprises. Hancock had such a great character for Will, he could explore more emotions or in this case he was basically emotionless, he was just a mellow kind of guy who ""drank and stuff"".

3346781,4,B0013J55B6,"To preface this, it is important to understand that I have long had a grudge against Will Smith.  His real life cockiness permeates his acting, which is mostly sludge, consisting of either a wise-crack or his deep, sad face (tenses his face, clamps down his jaw, frowns slightly and wells up a few tears).  I, Robot made me really hate him because the entire movie was a poorly written advertisement.  I am Legend continued the trend with a lame story and extensive use of ""sad face"" instead of acting.

Hancock does suffer from the same element of too much ""sad face"".  Still the movie is predominantly a comedy, which is what Will Smith does well (as does Jason Bateman).  I would, in fact, say this is a very good film based on its comedic aspects alone.

The movie's concept is that Hancock is a superhero who just cannot seem to do anything right, and is universally hated among the public he is called to protect.  As far as I know this is a pretty unique idea, which is quite rare in Hollywood today.  This is what the previews advertised, but the movie's hidden surprise is that it actually develops the story surrounding this superhero.

Why is he a superhero, where did he come from and why is he alone?  These are the questions the movie addresses.  The answers to Hancock's antediluvian origins are both surprising and enjoyable to find.",1215734400,,1349,4.598326359832636
3346782,2,B0013J55B6,"As if we do not have enough superhero movies already with the steady flow of umpteen sequels and still new ones in the works (Ant-Man is due out in 2010, I wonder what will be next Larva-Man?), someone had to create a completely new, original 2008 superhero with no comic book past--Hancock. Even with three strong performances, the film collapses from its' poor start and even worse end finale.

Will Smith has the title role of Hancock, a one-of-a-kind superhuman who works with the LAPD to catch criminals. Well, at least he is supposed to but he has become an alcoholic to deal with his constant mood of depression, and his inebriated antics have caused millions of dollars in damages to Los Angeles City. All of which has caused him to fallout out of the public's favor. Enter Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman) a PR consultant who wants to help him repair his image. Before long, well actually almost immediately, Hancock agrees, and the two form an unlikely duo. The finale comes rather abruptly with one of the most surprising, confusing finale that is what ultimately ruins Hancock.

All three talented stars (Will Smith, Jason Bateman, and Charlize Theron) play their parts entertainingly well, but the story, script, direction, and camera work are what destroy it. The film clocks in at 92 minutes, leaving no time for character development and all the events happen so quickly and abruptly that it feels like an extended TV episodes with gazillion-dollar effects.

Another thing that I found particularly annoying was this constant ""shaky"", close-ups of who ever was in the scene. Almost as if the studio was trying to save money on set design so they kept the camera in really tight.

Once again the time and effort was put into wowing the audience with the special effects, which are quite remarkable, rather than entertaining with a strong story and developed characters. I would not even recommend it as brainless entertainment because it was rather boring. I still wonder why someone felt the need to go and create ANOTHER superhero movie.",1215734400,2,2048,4.893371757925072

Maybe I like this movie so much because I am first and foremost a reader of books. I am used to, and can appreciate, a rich story with plot twists and complex characters; the kind of story that is hard to fit into media bits and bytes.

Most superheroes fall into a vat of something and come out with mysterious powers and a one-dimensional, and overwhelming desire to devote their life to being ""wonderful"" by killing bad guys.  Blah blah blah, same old same old.

I can relate to a character like Hancock who is emotionally hurting and alone yet still giving in to a sense of obligation to use his powers to help people.  Resentful, messy, and ungracious to be sure, but doing it anyway.

Hancock and this story are representative of every person who is going under for the first, third or hundredth time but just cannot completely quit...they keep going, and sometimes, are able to take hold and overcome themselves with the help of another person.

The movie is funny, heartfelt, raucous, and downright entertaining with explosions, fights, and remarkably little gore or vulgar language.  The scene in the prison where all the convicts are shrieking and crossing themselves is a visual play on words that still makes me laugh!  I don't know if I can wait for the Blu Ray DVD, I may have to go to the theater and watch it again.

Charlize Theron, who is overrated as an actor but a striking looking woman nonetheless, was not very convincing at all.  It seemed like she was phoning in her lines and expressions- perhaps it was too difficult a role for her.

But really the main problem had to do with the writing.  The story lacked fluidity and when the element of surprise came in it seemed like the ""movie-makers"" were too impressed with their own plot twists to convince the audience that they should be too.

3346785,3,B0013J55B6,"""Hancock"", or This Summer's Stop Gap between ""Iron Man"" and ""The Dark Knight"", the new film starring Will Smith, is a funny, fast-paced completely imperfect piece of cinematic fluff designed to help you while away a small piece of your summer at the multiplex. Will it be remembered as one of Smith's best? No. Will you enjoy the film? It will help you pass the time until ""The Dark Knight"" hits theaters.

Hancock (Smith) has superhero powers, but every time he gets involved with something, a lot of destruction happens due to his careless attitude, causing his public image to sink lower than W's current approval ratings. It doesn't help matters that he is always drinking and is openly hostile to everyone who approaches him. Hancock is a superhero with some problems. Passed out on a park bench, a little boy wakes him up and points to news coverage of a gang of gun-toting thugs speeding down a Los Angeles freeway, shooting at will at the cops in pursuit. A lot of innocent people are being hurt, cars crashing and the police aren't doing much good. Hancock groans and shoots off into the atmosphere, leaving a crater of destruction and crashing into a couple of things along the way. Soon, he catches up with the SUV and literally drops in to talk to the criminals, trying to get them to stop. When that doesn't work, he grabs the SUV and flings it onto the needle on top of the Capital Records building. A lot of people get upset at the destruction Hancock has caused despite putting an end to the deadly chase. On his way home from work, Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), a public relations man with a grand scheme, finds himself in need of some help. Miraculously, Hancock arrives and provides assistance. Destructive assistance, but he saves Ray's life. Ray realizes Hancock needs some image rehabilitation and offers to help him out. He also invites him to dinner; he meets Ray's son, Aaron (Jae Head) and second wife, Mary (Charlize Theron). It is spaghetti and meatballs night, he doesn't want to miss that, Ray promises. Mary is a little put off by the alcoholic man who swears in front of their child. Ray convinces Hancock he needs his help as much as the city needs the reluctant superhero, so he agrees to Ray's plan for image rehabilitation. But as Hancock exiles himself to prison, the crime rate grows and the public outcry for his return grows just as a strange force begins to change his powers.

""Hancock"" directed by Peter Berg (""The Kingdom"", a popular TV actor) is not a perfect film. Far from it. There are a couple of plot holes Hancock couldn't jump across despite his superpowers and one scene seems particularly superfluous and a lame excuse to spend some special effects budget. But it is a fun, lighthearted piece of fluff.

From the moment we meet Hancock, we realize he will be a challenge. Happier with a bottle of alcohol handy (when he wakes up, he grabs one from a waiting carton which holds still more bottles) he rushes off to help. The real fun in Hancock comes from his interactions with the public. Smith lets loose and his character says whatever he is thinking, whenever he wants, frequently offending people and many bystanders gather around him. This leads to a real love/ hate relationship between Hancock and the public. Which in turn further fuels his mixed feelings about helping the public.

Smith is absolutely the right choice to play this role. He may be the only choice who could successfully pull off the character. Surly, drunk and ready to voice his opinions, he is initially reluctant to do anything. Whenever he does, he knows something will go wrong and he will be blamed for a lot of damage. So he is a bit reluctant to use his super powers. Yet, he finds people expect him to help even though they know something will go wrong. Causing him to feels he is in a bit of a conundrum. And the public can't understand why he doesn't make the RIGHT choice when he decides to help.

Smith, who has become known as Mr. Fourth of July due to the string of hits he has appeared in, all of which were released on the holiday weekend, ""Independence Day"", ""Men In Black"", ""MIB II"", ""Hancock"" and others, brings the right blend of humor, confusion and anger to the role. As he gets upset with the constant nagging of the public, he lets the insults fly and isn't afraid of stating exactly what is on his mind. When he meets Ray, the PR man tries to explain to him, to convince him, why Hancock needs his services. And some of what he says seems to sink in. Hancock starts to realize that he could use a bit of an image makeover, he isn't happy and a large part of that is due to the constant bickering with the public at large. Why don't they like him? He saves so many lives? He decides he wants to become more liked within the community as he tries to help keep the bad guys in check.

This leads Ray to propose a radical plan and he urges Hancock to go through with it. Sure enough, Ray's predictions come true and the city soon calls on Hancock to help them out.

Jason Bateman plays Ray, who we first meet proposing a radical new image campaign to a pharmaceutical company. The guy's plans are ambitious, but we can't fault him because he is trying to do some good in the world. After Hancock helps him escape a potentially dangerous situation, Ray realizes he may have met just the person he needs to get the idea off the ground. If he can change Hancock's image for the better, he will become much more attractive to other companies. And his plan will be that much easier to sell.

So he sets out on his toughest assignment yet. And he brings Hancock home to meet his son and wife.

Bateman is very good. Funny, low key and charming, it is easy to see why Charlize Theron's Mary fell for him and why he is trying to change the world with his new image campaign.

Charlize Theron plays Mary, Ray's second wife who clearly seems to love and adore her husband. When she first meets Hancock, she regards him with some hostility; he brings a bottle of whisky to their dinner table and openly drinks in front of them, not bothering to hide his drunken state. And Mary is very worried about how Hancock might affect her husband's business. So she doesn't warm up to him right away.

Charlize Theron is good in the film, but this is basically a supporting role, so it seems strange to see the Oscar winning actress playing the part. I suspect she took the role for the challenges involved and also because the opportunity to appear in a big budget summer release doesn't come every day.

While the three actors are good, there are some plot holes, which threaten to derail the entire film. First, the filmmakers tip their hand to a 'secret' far too early. As soon as they start to shoot hints at this, your mind starts to race and you try to figure it out. When your mind starts racing, it comes up with a bunch of scenarios, and unfortunately, most of these are more believable than what happens in the actual film. So this becomes a bit anticlimactic. That's what is really going on?

There is also a battle between Smith's Hancock and another character in the middle of Hollywood Boulevard. Okay. Sure. They have to fight somewhere. But what makes less sense is when clouds start to roll in and wind and tornadoes and lightning start to appear. Does this freakish weather have come connection to the battle? If so, it is never explained. Honestly, I felt like the filmmakers wanted to add mayhem to the scene to help cover up any bad CGI work. Let's make everything dark and throw a lot of dust into the picture. That way, if we don't have the best CGI, it will be harder to tell.

But what the film gets right is enough to make it enjoyable. It is fun to watch Hancock interact with Ray and his family, and enjoy this slice of domestic bliss. Because it is a stark contrast to his actual life, filled with animosity directed at him from the public at large. And this is fun to watch as well; because it is behavior is so unlike what we are used to in a super hero.

""Hancock"" is an enjoyable piece of cinematic fluff that will soon be forgotten as soon as ""The Dark Knight"" sweeps into theaters across the country.",1215648000,,8165,4.485195154777927
3346786,3,B0013J55B6,"I saw HANCOCK just a few days ago, and I've already forgotten a lot of it.  It's a big, loud, flashy, glistening piece of Will Smithia.  I remember having a pretty good time watching the film...but I also know that it could have been more.

HANCOCK, in case somehow  you've missed one the 15,000,000 trailers that have played on TV, is a ""superhero"" played by Will  Smith.  He can fly, he can stop moving trains and is impervious to bullets.  Pretty much Superman.  But instead of merrily leading a double life as a ""regular"" human, a la Clark Kent, he is openly his superhero self.  Yet he's also a drunken misanthrope, who mostly tries to stop crime so people on the street will leave him alone to get drunk and sleep on bus stop benches.

A mark of how un-super he is occurs every time he takes off or lands.  He always seem to leave a little crater in the sidewalk or street from the sheer force of his flight.  He might be able to help himself, but doesn't seem to care to.

This is a highly amusing start for the film.  It  plays like a superhero spoof, but not in a heavy-handed way...just as a slight twist on a conventional genre.  There are lots of laughs to be had, and honestly, the best special effects in the film happen in the earliest action sequences.  When Hancock tries to stop criminals leading LAPD on a mad chase on the LA freeways, Hancock isn't satisfied with simply stopping the bad guys.  He has to drop their SUV onto the spire at the top of the historic Capitol Records building.  He also flies INTO street signs rather than around them, and basically causes more property damage than the criminals would  ($9.5 million dollars in one chase, to be exact).  One day, he saves PR-man Justin Bateman from sure death in a train-on-car collision.  The grateful Bateman, surprised at how viciously the crowd turns on  Hancock (who HAS managed to destroy the entire train and quite a few cars as well), offers to remake Hancock's public image.

After some reflection, and after meeting Bateman's family, including wife Charlize Theron...Hancock reluctantly agrees to go along.  One of Bateman's suggestions is the Hancock allow himself to be imprisoned for all the outstanding felonies he's wanted for...certain that a few days in the pen will a)  show the public how much they need this superhero and b) remaking his image as a ""changed"" man.

All this stuff is very funny and even feels original...a feeling you often don't get from a summer film.  Smith has great fun at his own expense...willing to sully his image.  (Of course, we just know Smith would never allow one of his characters to stay so disagreeable!)  Bateman continues to be one of the finest straight-men in the business.  The two have good chemistry.

But lurking in the background is Charlize Theron, whose own character arc is on a collision course with Hancock's...to the great detriment of the film.

When that collision occurs, the entire tone of the film becomes unmoored.  It still has funny bits, but also wants to be bittersweet, ironic, edgy and ultimately it wants to be romantic and moving.  It ends up being annoying...because while I don't mind a movie taking me in an unexpected direction...the new direction needs to be an IMPROVEMENT over the old direction.  In HANCOCK, this is decidedly NOT the case.  So what started as a very good popcorn movie turned into a bit of a mush.

And all this leads to a finale that is shocking only because it is so small.  One thing I expect from my summer blockbusters is to see a slam-bam action fest...to see the special effects stepped up a notch.  Think of the hideous TRANSFORMERS movie...the final battle scene was noisy and impressively scaled.  (It was also confusing.)  I especially expect my superhero movies to end with a big fight scene.  Yet HANCOCK ends with a small scale, brief battle in a hospital.

I just barely recommend this film, because it does feature some fine effects work in the early going, a nice relationship between Smith and Bateman and some truly funny bits early on (including a scene in a prison yard that is one of the funniest and grossest of the year!).  But if you skip this film altogether, you will not find yourself having missed much.",1215648000,2,4220,4.635627530364372

The only reason I did not give this film one-star  is that the concept of  ""redemption"" is a powerful one. I can even honestly say the first third of Hancock was somewhat entertaining, but it went downhill fast! For lack of a better word, the movie became just plain dull! And it's hard to imagine Will Smith in a boring film!

There are so many glaring holes in the story it became distracting! A good story makes sense within the world the writer has created. When there is absolutely no explanation for major events taking place, an intelligent person will get annoyed! In a nutshell,  that is the definition of sloppy storytelling! See what happens when Hollywood forces it's writers to go on strike! I bet someone exacted revenge by writing such an erratic and dopey  story!

Memo to Hollywood: It's not cool to chop-off  both of a person's hands in a movie geared for children! Is that supposed to be funny? If you think so, then maybe you need the services of a psychiatrist! And when you do cut off a person's hand and wave it around, it relaxes, it does not remain inflexible. I guess whoever wrote the script must think everyone is as dumb as the filmmakers of Hancock!

3346790,4,B0013J55B6,"""Hancock"" takes an interesting twist on your classic ""Superhero"" story.  At the start of the film, instead of an all powerful strongly motivated do-gooder, Will Smith's character, Hancock, is an angry, bitter, disillusioned wreck who really resents being a superhero.  He shows this by saving people and stopping crime is the most destructive ways possible: catching three bad guys while trashing several buildings and freeways in the process; and saving Jason Bateman's Character, Ray Embrey at the cost of damaging several nearby cars and destroying an entire freight train.

Needless to say, our Superhero has an image problem.  Not just the image others have of him, but the image he has of himself.

Into this mess steps the man Hancock just saved: Ray Embrey.

As a marketing professional, Ray has a self-appointed mission to convince major corporations to give away their dearest, most important products in the service of the greater good (in the form of a foundation Ray has established for that purpose).  In modern capitalist America, this message does not go well, and Ray, in many ways, is just as discouraged as Hancock is: no one listens, no one cares.  The difference is, Ray hasn't given up.

As the film progresses, we see Hancock change, as he responds, resentfully at first, to Ray's encouragement and guidance.  Hancock eventually redeems himself in the eyes of the public, and becomes a respected and acclaimed superhero.

While all this goes on, Hancock makes a few arch-enemies: criminals he's caught and/or humiliated over the course of the film.  The last third or so of the film is devoted to their revenge against him.  We also learn at this point that Hancock is not the only one of his kind, as he'd long assumed.

Without giving away critical details, let's just say that Hancock learns not only to accept the love of others, but also learns that love sometimes means he will be faced with situations where he will need to give up all he holds dear, and all he has gained, to save those he loves.

Ultimately, this movie speaks about Sacrificial Love: Hancock and Ray each learn to sacrifice for the love of others, and we learn that Ray's wife (Charlize Theron) has also given sacrificially for her love of both of these men.

""Hancock"" provides good action, humor and an interesting story while addressing some interesting philosophical issues at several different levels.  The story line shares some common themes with Smith's earlier film ""The Pursuit of Happyness"".  More time could have been devoted in the film to expanding on these themes: the film's relatively short run time (92 minutes) is just not enough to give them the treatment they deserve, particularly in the area of the nature of relationship of Charlize Theron's character with both Ray and Hancock.

This is not an Academy Award winner of a film, but it hits the intended target of providing a good story that is more than mindless action.  I give it three and a half - let's call it four stars: well worth seeing in the theatre, and a good film to plug into the DVD for the family to watch some evening at home.",1215388800,,3115,4.819548872180451

3346792,2,B0013J55B6,"Summer releases from Hollywood are generally intended as light entertainment, and they should be viewed in that spirit.  Will Smith has virtually owned the summer release market for several years now, and during that time he's starred in some fun movies.  With just a couple of exceptions, ""Hancock"" breaks that winning streak.  Even keeping in mind that it's just a summer movie doesn't help much.

I don't want to write anything here that will serve as a spoiler for someone planning to see the film.  So let me just say that the movie begins with a wonderfully nonconventional and even campy thesis--a superhero with a bad boy attitude--and within the first 40 minutes utterly--and I mean UTTERLY--drops that concept and moves in a totally different and not as entertaining direction.  It's as if one of the two screenwriters shaved off the ending of his script, the other cut off the beginning of his, and then some mad Dr. Frankenstein (if you see the movie, you'll get the pun) shoved the two pieces together hoping to wind up with a unified whole.  But even Smith's considerable talents couldn't make it work.

That's the not-so-good news.  The better news is that Jason Bateman as Ray the public relations guy who tries to salvage Hancock's reputation really delivers a sterling performance--at least in the first half of the film, before everything begins to unravel.  He's a guy to watch.",1215302400,4,1398,4.885593220338983
3346793,3,B0013J55B6,"I never really expected Hancock to be the big summer movie that some people expected it to be. It is however still entertaining. Will Smith is great as a moody, drunk and vulgar super hero. Oh plus, he gets even more angry if someone calls him an A-Hole. It is obvious that he does mean well since he does show up to save the day. He just does it in a lazy and careless sort of a way where he causes a lot of damage. So he always winds up doing more good than bad. Jason Bateman is also fun and him and Smith play off each other well. He sees good in Hancock and thinks he can make him into a hero that people respect and love. His wife played by Charlize Theron has her doubts though.

  I would have gave Hancock a higher rating, but I think it's more fresh and fun in the beginning and middle than it is in the end. Don't get me wrong, it's still good in the end but it almost turns into something similar to My Super Ex-Girlfriend. Smith does make it worth watching through-out though. The movie isn't big fun like Iron Man but it still has it's laughs and fun moments. It's also fresh to get an anti-superman movie. I mean Hancock is pretty much the total opposite of Superman which is a fun concept. Smith is up for the task but the script really isn't 100% worthy of his performance. If you don't go to see the movie with high hopes you might enjoy it more. Also don't expect a super hero movie that you can bring the whole family to.

So much so that this is one of the few blockbusters I wish had been longer, giving writers Gilligan and Ngo and director Berg more time to explore the backstory and the resonant depths it potentially had. The problem isn't so much that the tone changes, but rather that more isn't made of it. I also wanted to spend more time with these thoroughly likeable characters. As it stands, ""Hancock"" is still a winner. The script is sharp, the direction kinetic, the music and lens work appropriately manic, and the performances fine. Most surprising is Smith who manages to keep his shirt on and wring a lot more than laughs out of this character.

Hancock is a man with superhuman abilities---super strength, flight, speed, etc.  The problem is that he is also alcoholic, anti-social and pretty much an all-around jerk.  When he saves a good-hearted soul named Ray (Jason Bateman) from a certain death, he is challenged to change his reputation and become the super hero that Los Angeles desperately needs.

  With Ray's guidance (Ray is a PR specialist), Hancock begins to rehabilitate himself and become the kind of hero that everyone respects.  Its not an easy journey for Hancock but slowly he begins to realize that he can and actually wants to be a man who protects the people.

  ""Hancock"" is a different kind of summer hero movie.  This film is not as well made as ""Iron Man"", which started the summer off with a bang and undoubtedly will not compare favorably to the coming Dark Knight juggernaut.  It is, though, a decent summer action flick that will tide fan boys over until the late Heath Ledger's Joker challenges the Batman to the fate of Gotham City.  The director does a fairly decent job of keeping the movie rolling along although the storyline is a bit patchy.  There are some twists and turns in the film, most of which are pretty predictable---I doubt there will be any plot point shocking enough that will keep people talking at the water cooler on Monday.

  The special effects are really quite good but the story is a bit of a mess.  Hancock at the beginning of the film is thoroughly disgusting and completely unlikable.  The concept of a hero who is not your typical stand-up guy is an interesting take but I think fans of Smith will be surprised at the character's lack of manners, cursing and unacceptable attitude.  I also think most parents will be turned off by the language and bad behavior of the lead character.  I wouldn't recommend the film to kids under the age of 13 due to the language and unnecessary mean-spiritedness that Smith's character displays in the first third of the film, though his transformation does bring out the true hero and good spirit eventually.

  The one stand out for me was Jason Bateman.  He is very often the most humorous part of the film, charming and deserving of the roles he has been landing lately.  I wouldn't have guessed a few years ago that Bateman would have ever returned to Hollywood in any capacity---but a critically successful run in the very funny tv comedy ""Arrested Development"" seems to have put him on track to land some good roles that could give him some decent hits of his own.  I hope we see more of him on the big screen and can imagine him doing well in romantic comedies.

When the plot twists start coming, though, they come in such rapid succession that even the sturdiest of viewers will find their willing suspension of disbelief not so willing.

Okay, that's the understatement of the year.  He's having a huge PR problem, namely he's so drunk and unpredictable, no one wants him to show up on a crime scene. But, one man, PR specialist Jason Batemen (Ray Embrey) believes in him.  So does his son, Aaron (Jae Head).  His wife, Mary (Charlize Theron) does not.

With Embrey's coaxing, Hancock decides to rehabilitate himself and he voluntarily goes to jail.  Meanwhile, Embrey is working on him.  The Plan:  Crime's so bad in LA the cops will ask for an early release and Hancock's got to be ready--with manners and a new sharper image.

He is.  And he wows them.  He still doesn't wow Mary.  And that's the real story, John Hancock's secret identity.  Go for the CGI at the first and be prepared to be surprised in the second.

As a man who can't remember his real name or even where he came from, Hancock may actually be worse off than Bruce Wayne; despite emotional scarring from a painful past, at least he's always known who he is. Hancock has been given powers without knowing why, and because of that, he has no idea how to use them. He's the superhero no one wants to be saved by, a lonely, miserable, self-destructive man who can't get along with anyone. As the film progresses, we wait for that climactic moment when this character is finally given the chance to redeem himself.

As interesting as this character is, ""Hancock"" is not everything it could have been. This is mostly due to a gigantic plot twist that I wouldn't dream of describing, not even in vague terms. All I can say is that it's outlandish, implausible, and underdeveloped, not what one would expect from a small scale, character driven superhero film. Strangely enough, it feels the most like a comic book when the secret is revealed, which would have been fine if the entire film had gone in the same direction. But it didn't; ""Hancock"" starts off subtly by satirizing the very concept of superheroes, from the way the act to how they look to why they're compelled to save the day in the first place. The film opens with a high-speed chase on a Los Angeles highway, one that involves heavy gunfire. Hancock (Will Smith) doesn't know what's going on because he's passed out on a sidewalk bench, drunk as a skunk; a boy no older than six has to wake him up and tell him that the bad guys are getting away.

We quickly learn that, while Hancock has stopped a fair number of violent criminals, he still does a lot more harm than good. Whenever he flies, his takeoffs and landings leave gaping holes in the concrete. He damages buildings and destroys cars. He's provoked far too easily, especially when he's being called a specific dirty name. He drinks far too much. He's antisocial, apathetic, and angry, not helped by the fact that no one praises him for the lowered crime rate. Then he saves the life of Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), a down-on-his-luck public relations professional; to show his gratitude, he decides to help Hancock reestablish his image. The first step is responding to an outstanding arrest warrant and actually spending time in jail. Ray believes this will give the impression that Hancock is willing to improve. He also believes that, since the crime rate will increase, Hancock will be released much earlier than usual.

I won't get into the specifics of how long Hancock stays in jail and what happens in that time, but rest assured that he's eventually released and given a second chance. As he desperately tries to make sense of himself, Hancock gets closer to Ray and his family. The young son, Aaron (Jae Head), almost treats Hancock like his best friend, always so excited around him, always wanting to share toys and talk about trivial things. The wife, Mary (Charlize Theron), is always suspicious around Hancock; she's distant, cold, and short-winded whenever he's near her. I won't say whether or not there's a reason for this, but I will say that by the time everything is explained, we're left with more questions than answers.

That's about as much of the plot I can describe without spoiling anything. The best I can say at this point is to go see the film and find out what I couldn't describe. ""Hancock"" is worth seeing, even if the plot strays from itself a few too many times. There's a moment when the city is attacked by freak weather (which includes snow and multiple tornadoes), and I couldn't help but believe it was only for the sake of showing cool visual effects. I suppose that could be interpreted as satire, since visual effects are the very heart and soul of the average superhero film. The thing is, ""Hancock"" is not average--it brings something original to the genre, something modern and lively and (to some extent) realistic. When you get your first look at Hancock, you see not a sterile do-gooder like Superman but a filthy vagrant, with all the sadness in the world swimming in his bloodshot eyes. He's just plain pathetic.

While Ray's goal is for Hancock to make peace with the public, the film's goal is for Hancock to make peace with himself. Even after tossing a young French bully hundreds of feet into the air and catching him just before he hits the ground, we sense that Hancock is more misunderstood than anything else. He's deeply flawed, but that doesn't mean he's unwilling to change. If the plot of ""Hancock"" were at the same developmental level as the main character, it would be one of the decade's most thought provoking superhero films, right up there with this year's ""Iron Man."" Unfortunately, it isn't; it loses itself to a crafty plot twist, and the explanations that go along with it are impossible to accept. Nevertheless, the inner struggle of the title character made this movie worthwhile, as did the special effects and the satirical manipulation of the superhero genre.",1214956800,26,5318,4.732470334412082
3346806,4,B0013J55B6,This movie is great. It is not surprising to see all the criticism-actually I expected more. I mean hey a black superhero is typically a major zero!!Will Smith was awesome as well as the supporting cast. The plot was good and deep enough to keep you interested. What's funny to me is how people are criticizing the action of this super film but the same people probably think that last year's Superman film was actually suppose to be the love story it was. For people who are looking for a good and funny action film you will enjoy.  I think it's a 9 out of 10.,1214956800,,561,4.2924528301886795
3346807,4,B0013J55B6,"I really enjoyed the first half of the Hancock, when he had a bad attitude and some great lines. The film progressed into a typical superhero movie that was still fun, but lacked anything original. I'm not the biggest Will Smith fan, though I think he was the only actor for this role and it is one of my favorite Will Smith characters yet. Charlize Theron was cast to look good and she does, while Jason Bateman provides good and often funny support to Smith's Hancock. The CGI is very good throughout and there is even a couple of twists thrown in that might catch you off guard.

Hancock is a good summer flick that isn't in the same league as Iron Man or the greatness that will likely be The Dark Knight, but it is exactly what you would expect from Will ""Summer Blockbuster"" Smith.

3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars",1214956800,14,813,4.30718954248366
3346808,3,B0013J55B6,"Filthy, unshaven, drunk and vulgar, Hancock is the absolute opposite of the typical superhero. The idea is singularly spectacular, but it only carries the film during the first half - the remaining plot twists create more questions and resolve fewer answers, until the audience is fuming with aggravation. Worthy amounts of comedy save the film from total nonsense, but for all the unique ideas surrounding Hancock, it seems inevitable midway that not everything will piece together smoothly.

John Hancock (Will Smith) is a bum, waking up in his own filth on a bench in the street, unkempt, bedraggled, crude, mannerless and cynical. He is also a superhero. Suffering from amnesia, Hancock follows an undiscovered calling within himself that finds the crass demigod continually saving the lives of various people in his hometown of Los Angeles. But his services come with a hefty price tag, as he uncaringly and accidentally destroys millions of dollars worth of property in the process of stopping armed madmen - leading to great disdain from the very humans he rescues.

In walks Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman), a PR guy with no luck trying to sell his revolutionary yet profitless ideas to major moneymaking corporations. When his life is saved by the destructive Hancock, he sees the strong resentment the public administers. Realizing the loneliness and confusion resonating in the unappreciated superhero, Ray offers his services to help redefine Hancock's less-than-perfect public image. Involving a new look, a new outfit, vocal coaching, and a short prison sentence, Hancock appears to be back on the right track to fulfilling his destiny as a savior of the world - until Ray's mysterious wife Mary (Charlize Theron) reveals some startling clues to Hancock's past.

It takes a regular human being to teach a superhero to be super. This is essentially the driving force in the film, and it could have been truly impressive. A perfect spin on the paradigmatic superhero maxim, the plot allows for plenty of comedy, action and even romance. But director Peter Berg decides to keep the audience in the dark for just long enough - until wits are at an end and viewers find themselves fidgeting in their seats. When the answers don't come frequently enough and the questions continue to stockpile, it's obvious that the movie isn't prepared to solve the many problems being heaped onto Hancock's story.

Humor is the driving force behind Hancock's design, and we are magnificently treated to plenteous amounts of sarcasm and coarse antics that yield continual laughs. The main character provides comedy along with nearly all of the supporting players, which presents an unprecedented approach to a superhero film. And while the hilariousness of each new situation rarely subsides, the story can't survive on wittiness alone. Rarely is a beat skipped when it comes to the laughs, but by the halfway point, they cease to push the story forward.

Obtaining the July 4th weekend, Hancock is sure to bring in tons of money - plus the star power of Will Smith has recently always ensured success. The only superhero movie in quite some time not based on a graphic novel, the originality of the film entertains to a point; but the lack of real solutions for an outlandish superhero tale prevents the film from being as extraordinary as Hancock himself.
