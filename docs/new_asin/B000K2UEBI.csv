2828053,4,B000K2UEBI,"Charles Solomon's review is a bit misleading. Yes, this series borrows a lot of its trappings from Evangelion but it has neither the psychological complexity nor grand mythos of Evangelion. It shares the same character designer as Gundam Seed, Hisashi Hirai, but it doesn't focus on mecha action and fanservice like the recent incarnations of the Gundam series. In fact, the best way to describe Fafner would be to say it's about war and human relationships. There's an alien race which is not truly evil but its method of trying to understand humans results in a death count in the billions and the surviving human factions are all tangled up in different alliances and military sides, with often conflicting goals. The relationship between parents and their children is realistically and sympathetically displayed here because the children are asked to pilot the Fafners and fight while the adults can't. This is a series that really gives a lot of background and thought to its characters, supplying them with parents, friends, lovers, and rivals. It doesn't shy away from the uglier aspects of humanity like meaningless death, hypocrisy, or selfishness.

The main problem with Fafner is the first half of the series up till episode. 12 is messy with bad dialogue and mediocre plot pacing. In the latter half of the series, they changed the script writer to Tow Ubukata and the series showed a marked improvement. The TV series' ending is bitter-sweet but the film ""Heaven and Earth"" is a direct sequel and resolves the issues in a more satisfactory fashion.

Recommended for fans who like anim&eacute; with a serious handling of sci-fi/military themes and human drama. There's also a heavy dose of Existentialism with the question ""Are you there?"" re-phrased throughout the series. Soukyuu no Fafner isn't casual viewing and has a grim feel to it. The music is composed by Tsuneyoshi Saito and performed by the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra with a strong female vocalist for OP/ED songs, backing the epic feel/Norse mythology used in the show.

Timeline:

1. Fafner: Right of Left OVA (takes place a few months before the main series and explains a lot about the plot and characters. It should be seen before the TV series if possible but isn't available yet as a US release)

2. Soukyuu no Fafner aka Fafner in the Azure (TV series)

3. Fafner: Heaven and Earth (film occurring 2 years after the main series and provides the real ending)",1350604800,6,2442,4.958435207823961
2828054,5,B000K2UEBI,"Fafner is a show with teenagers piloting giant robots...does this sound familiar? Perhaps you are ready to dismiss this as an another generic mecha show- but that would be the farthest thing from the truth.  In fact, Fafner stands out from the rest in so many positive ways that you'll wonder why there aren't more shows that emulate how Fafner does things.

* What is the show about?
  The protagonists have lived all their lives on a tranquil, remote island called Tatsumiya Island- it's so remote that they can't get all the TV channels, and publications from the mainland are delivered late, but there's a local broadcasting station on the island, and they have the beach, the mountains, and a tight-knit community that celebrates traditional festivals... and most of all, they have their loving parents, and each other.
  When the island is attacked by an unknown threat, they discover a hidden side to their peaceful island village, only to realize that the reality that they had known until yesterday had been a fabrication.
  As the series progresses, the characters struggle with the battle for survival, coming to terms with themselves and their new reality, and to protect their identity (sense of the Self), their precious people, and normalcy.

* What makes this show so special?
  It's not the strategic, intense, and gripping battle sequences- although Fafner has several epic, high-stakes battles  especially towards the end of the series.
  It's not the character designs by the character designer of Gundam Seed, Infinite Ryvius, and Heroic Age.
  It's not the unique mechanic designs for the titular Fafners that get their distinctive look from non-symmetric spines and array of weaponry.
  It's not the gorgeous artwork (especially the background art) that makes you often forget that this series was originally released in 2004.
  Nor is it the epic and haunting soundtrack full of poignant melodies and orchestral battle themes that escalate each scene into an intense and emotional experience.
  Fafner does all of those things well, but what sets Fafner apart from many, many other shows is its nuanced presentation of the theme which is tightly integrated into its plot and character development.  The portrayal of the festums (beautiful, sinister, alien, but most of all, an entity whose actions are not based on hostility but nevertheless threatens the survival of the human race) and humanity's response to them will probably invoke the more thoughtful viewer to ponder about life, communication, and what makes a person a human being.

* If you're looking for any of the following, Fafner is NOT the show for you:
- Multiple female characters in revealing costumes throwing themselves at the male character wishing for his romantic attentions
- A protagonist on a ego trip over-brimming with confidence to shape the world to follow his selfish desires
- Absent parents
- Dead people coming back to life for no reason except to placate viewers
- Star Wars-style aliens  (aka, aliens who look a little different from homo sapiens, but speak perfect English and have the same cultural values as the humans in the show)
- Men in Black-style aliens (aka, aliens who look very different from homo sapiens, and exist to be blown up by the protagonists)

* Pacing Issues + Story Arcs (minor spoilers)
- The first two episodes serve as the introduction to the series, and should be viewed contiguously
- Episodes 1~4 : Beginning
- Episode 5: First wham episode
- Change of pace after episode 9
- Episodes 10~ 14: Important plot-wise, difficult to watch
- Change of pace after episode 15.
- Episodes 16 through 21: Series settles into its prime
- Episodes 21 through 23: Wham episodes, one after another
- Episodes 25 and 26: Finale

* I love this show! Is there more?
Yes! There is a special (OVA) called Right of Left, which portrays events prior to the first episode of the show.  It also explains why there's seemingly an age gap between the oldest children and youngest adults on the main series.  However, this has never been released in English/States-side.
The movie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fafner-Heaven-and-Earth-Movie-Limited-Edition-Blu-Ray-DVD-Combo/dp/B008NNYA2A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fafner: Heaven and Earth Movie (Limited Edition Blu-Ray/DVD Combo)</a>&nbsp;is however getting a release! It is set two years after the events of the main series, and is a must-watch if you love the main series.

* Misc. info about the series:
The main series first aired in Japan in Fall 2004 ~ Spring 2005.
Right of Left was released in 2006.
Heaven and Earth was released in theaters at the end of 2010, and came out on DVD in Japan in 2011.
The next segment of the series (titled 'Exodus') is said to be in production.

* Intended audience:
At least teenagers and older.  Remember, just because it has robots doesn't mean that it's for kids! Audiences who are emotionally younger than the protagonists may find this show difficult to understand.

* Easter Eggs? / Don't miss these!
- You'll probably notice (as early as episode 1 or 2, and at the very latest by episode 23) the significance of the pilots' pupil colors.  Rewatch the part in episode 1 where the glasses girl takes off her glasses.
- In certain episodes (starting with episode 5), pay special attention to the lyrics of the ending (outro) theme song.
- At the end of Episode 23, do NOT skip the ending theme song to move onto the next episode!
- After finishing the entire series, re-watch the beginning of the opening (intro) theme song. Observe which characters fade towards the screen, and which characters fade away.

**Too Long, Didn't Read?**

Fafner is a mecha show with endearing characters, strong character development, thought-provoking themes, unconventional strategic action, and a stirring soundtrack.  It has a special place in my heart that makes me want to scream how much I love this show, but my words are inadequate to articulate why and how this show is so great.  It is certainly not for everyone, and it does have its faults.  But watch it with an open mind, and what some people see as shortcomings of the show will be a strength in your eyes if you appreciate it for what it is.  Watch it with a good friend - it is an excellent anime for having in-depth discussions.",1347753600,31,6336,5.01432664756447
2828055,3,B000K2UEBI,"I will admit that the entire series on Blu-ray DVD combo for $60 MSRP and a current $43 price is more than fair. You get all 26 episodes here. Good bang for the buck.  Also note that this is a re-release of an existing series in the US by Geneon, who went under a few years ago.  Funimation picked up the license for this series.

So why 3 stars?  The problem is that the series just isn't that great. It starts off promisingly enough, but the characters start becoming less interesting as the series progresses. You really do get a lot of the 'whiny' style characters, obviously many are based off Evangelion characters. The series goes in a more space age futuristic style though. I would compare the world to that in Eureka Seven (which is a better series by far).  The character designs were all by Hisashi Hirai, who is famous for Gundam Seed and a few other series.  The mecha designer is Naohiro Washio, famous for StarCraft and Gundam 00.  If you notice, the characters are remarkable similar to Gundam Seed characters and the mecha are similar to the Thrones and the Enacts in Gundam 00.  This only serves to render comparison to superior series with superior writing.

The writers seem to relish in killing off characters right after they seem to become more interesting. One example, a character says it's his last battle and he is stepping down to take care of his kid. Then he gets twisted into a bloody corkscrew in that last battle. Nice. But that kind of sums up what happens throughout. The problem is that the series starts well, so you are hooked into it. By the time you near the end you just keep pushing forward just so you can finish it.  I discovered that they switched chief script writers halfway through.  Tow Ubukata, took over halfway through, he is famous for Le Chevalier D'Eon and Mardock Scramble.  Both of those series were uneven in my opinion as well.

The voice acting is pretty good, though not to the level of matching characters up like in Gundam and Code Geass (another two series much better than this). The intro music is pretty awful. Some people may enjoy it, but it was like nails on a chalkboard to me. The character designer did work on Gundam SEED, and you can really see the similarity to those characters, so much that Kazuki looks like he could be Kira Yamato's brother. The designs of the Fafners are pretty neat, but not as slick as the mechs from Eureka Seven or as well designed as those from Gundam 00.

The animation is superb though, but it's pretty without substance. Kind of like the hottie at the bar who is amazing until she opens her mouth to speak. This is a series better seen and not heard! First half of the series is a solid A, second half is a C-.  It's just your standard mecha anime filled with cliches and characters who just aren't that endearing.  Gundam 00 is a much better purchase for a series in this style.  Or Eureka Seven.

2828056,5,B000K2UEBI,"OK people, what is Fafner?

Before I get into the story, I will try to answer a hypothetical question first: Who should not and who should watch Fafner.

To begin with, if you are a die-hard fan of Evangelion or Gundam etc. than most probably you will not want to watch this one because it has some similarities with the previous mention animes indeed; and you most probably will `blow away' a great anime like this. On the other hand, people who would like to watch a very good anime, with strong storyline, twists, romance, lots of action and of course Mechas (belongs to the so called sci-fi category) than you should watch this one.

Let us proceed to the storyline:

It starts with the life of people, teenagers going to school, adults to work etc. by introducing the viewer to their everyday life. The place where the story starts is called Tatsumiya Island. To make the long story short, aliens attack earth and obviously the Island gets under attack, devastating their lives and throwing the teenagers into battle; basically, because they are the ones who are able to fly the Mechas. Additionally, power games will start to evolve, exhausting battles all over the globe will occur, between sort of government and military parties etc. and all the teenagers are caught in the middle of all this. As the series proceed, many questions will be raised (which will be answered - directly or indirectly - in the end of the series), the bounds between the main protagonists will become stronger (and of course romance), the viewer will witness all the emotional rollercoaster that these youngsters will go through and some of them will even die.

This sums up the story. I could get into more details and tell you what will go on in every episode but I refrained myself from doing this because I believe that if someone decides to watch the series than I would give away the entire suspense and twists of it.

Overall critique about the series:

If you are into Mechas for a while, then most probably you have watched Mecha series and are familiar with the common pattern that this kind of animes are following: teenagers are the ones who can fly the Mechas, alien invasion, battles, romance, power games etc (as for the good guy vs. bad guy, in the Mecha series this usually presents a grey zone). Therefore, why should someone watch Fafner? If you are not into animes for a long time, should you watch Fafner?

The answer would be yes. First of all, because of its animation, which is very good. Second, because of its storyline, which although is based on the common pattern that is been explained above, yet, it manages to bring forth new ideas, a solid and strong storyline, many twists and mainly till the final episodes you will not be able to foresee its final conclusion. Even if you are a die-hard fan of Evangelion, RahXephon etc. this one is definitely worth a watch from you. As for the action, the series are packed with it. Third, because of its dub; in other words, if you belong to the category of people that instead of Japanese would prefer the English dub, it is very good done and professional orchestrated. Thumbs up!

Apart from it, if you buy the box set or the complete collection, then the box is exactly the one you see in the picture, which is very strong, like a shelf and doesn't brake easily. As for extras, the usual stuff like previews of other animes, not credit opening/ending and so forth.

To the most obvious question: Buying it or not? To be honest, if you can afford the money than I will definitely recommend these series to you, if, you can not afford the money than try to rent it and watch it.

To conclude these series are highly recommended!

I hope that I could help you...",1169769600,56,3721,4.587349397590361
2828057,1,B000K2UEBI,"Ok so I watch a lot of anime(I mean like A LOT) and most anime have one or two issues that for some people could be a deal breaker but this anime in particular bothered me enough so that I decided to write a review, which is something I normally wouldn't do. The premise of the story is promising. People in hiding, unknown force hunting, giant robot only hope, government agenda etc. but honestly after the about the 5th episode I found no desire to watch it anymore, it got boring quickly.
Why I didn't like it: t tries to invest you in characters that aren't in particularly that interesting ( many characters are so similar looking that it is sometimes impossible to know who is who (I would have been completely lost without subtitles) I would say plot holes but they're would have to be a plot to begin with. Animation is not great in first episodes.
Pros: animation does get better in later episodes(grudgingly acknowledged), robots are cool. robots fighting aliens is cool.
Cons: It attempts to be a character piece, then kills off characters it tried to invest you in.
FINAL VERDICT: AVOID UNLESS YOU LIKE ROBOTS A LOT, I MEAN LIKE OBSESSIVE, AND YOU'VE WATCHED EVERY OTHER MECHA ANIME OUT THERE.",1388707200,,1205,4.609302325581395

2828059,5,B000K2UEBI,"I love this show and think it is well animated and dubbed. However, i already own the DVD collection which doesn't translate well on a flat screen TV. DVDs weren't meant 4 such large screen viewing, not meant for HD TVs, so i thought i would cave in and get the blu-ray set since it was such a bargain and decided to just get it. To my surprise, the blu-ray is exactly like the DVD in terms of aspect ratio. Thats right, the episodes to do not take up the entire screen. I pop in my DVD and blu-ray after one another and it is the same size. It is the show in square view and not rectangular view. Yes, the blu-ray is a bit clearer, but thats it. I wanted it to take up the entire screen. There are movies from the 1980's that have been released on blu-ray and take up the whole screen. The footage gets remastered, cleaned up, converted to 16:9 or whatever all that tech lingo means. Yes, my Samsung TV gives me the option to have the show appear across the whole screen, but i lose footage at the corners since it is being stretched beyond its capacity of what it was built 4 in terms of viewing. Anyways, i am done with my rant.

Once again, this is a 5 star show. Special teens who can power special machines to save the earth. Just a rift off another anime show that is a rift off of another anime show, but you get the deal. Definitely pick this up since the price is such a bargain. I was just a bit shocked by the way the output appears on screen.",1375228800,,1455,4.0874125874125875

2828061,5,B000K2UEBI,"Fafnir is a deep and fascinating look at a post- apocalyptic world, and the lengths people will go for peace and to destroy their enemy. It also makes you ask... who is the real foe? The characters are interesting and well fleshed out, the voice acting compelling in either language and the animation spectacular. Highly recommended.",1371513600,2,333,4.964285714285714
2828062,4,B000K2UEBI,"Great action packed series.  Mecha versus alien biologicals.  The beginning is fast paced as you are introduced to all the key players.  As the story unfolds, the history and how each character relates to each other becomes more apparent as the battles increase.  There are losses and gains, betrayal and reconciliations, infatuation and love.  Set in the planetary war torn future based on military societies, mankind is on the verge of extinction based on a alien threat.  An island is a refuge of the last of the Japanese people as the rest of the world is trying to survive.  The island leaves the world be and just wants to be left alone.  During their existence, they have to come to reassemble what life should be like and have taken on dual role personas to fill in the void of not just the defenders of the island against an onslaught of both human and alien threats.  Their course is set to bring truce or bloody peace as they move to fight for their survival.

2828065,4,B000K2UEBI,"Tatsumiyajima is an island off the coast of Japan. It is a self sustained island that is a source of hope in a world overrun with alien invaders called The Festum. The teenagers that live on this island pilot mechas called Fafner. Fafner is the only means for destroying The Festum. Kazuki is the greatest warrior among the Fafner pilots. He has a strong sense of justice and loyalty to his loved ones. He risks everything, along with his friends, to protect humanity.

There are a lot of mecha series out there. This one is above average. It doesn't reach the level of Evangelion, but it's a heck of a lot better than Gasraki. I think that it is most like RahXephon. If you've seen RahXephon, then you can get a pretty good idea of what this is like. It has good animation, voice acting, and a suitable soundtrack. There is plenty of action and drama is Fafner as well.

After hearing all of that you're probably wondering, ""why not 5 stars then""? The reason I can't give it 5 stars is b/c some of the characters seemed very distant. Even though the characters feelings and love for each other was a major theme, the relationships between them weren't developed very well. I think that the psychology of the Fafner pilots was focused on too much. The thing that would have made this series great was stronger relationships between them. This is the reason It wasn't great. Don't get  me wrong, Fafner is definitely good, but it lacked the most important thing it needed...character development.",1358467200,2,1495,4.633962264150943

but pretty much half the charachters that are developed (and you will like them) die horribly and horrifically, right off the back we lose a fafner + pilot in ep 2 i believe and its one of the better ones apparently. my gripe with is series is that it revolved around the concept of people dieing to do a shock factor to the viewer and make you feel sad/angry ect, not my cup of tea thank you, i purchased it cheap and was thrilled to get to watch.

the story starts slow, you will be asking questions and wondering wtf is going on and why? till near middle of the series, then it begins to get good,and half way past this they start  killing off main characters that it took half the show to build up. so if your into the a plot similar to planet of the beast king, here you go. want something like gundam or linebarrel, code geass , or robotech look elsewhere

this show has numerous plots in the series and by the end your more lost than you were
