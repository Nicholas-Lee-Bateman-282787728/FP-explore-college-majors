7858841,4,6303965911,"The only reason I own this movie is for the 12 minutes of pure laughter that is portrayed in the second story of this film. Like Twilight Zone and Creepshow, This film is dissected into multiple stories (3). The first one is kind of stupid. The second story is about anger and I have to say this is possibly the funniest Andrew ""Dice"" Clay I have ever seen. It was worth the money just to watch him in action even if it was really short. The last story has Dennis Leary and involves ""lust"", it is descent but not as good as Dice.",1040774400,2,529,4.145631067961165
7858842,2,6303965911,"There is only one reason to buy this film--the second vignette, ""Anger.""  It is the funniest twenty minutes of film I have ever seen.  Andrew ""Dice"" Clay is at his ranting raunchy best, getting  off some of the best one-liners I've heard in ages.  I've shown this to  people who despise Dice, and they've howled.  The rest of the film droops  in comparison, despite excellent casting.  The powers that be should have  saved me some wear and tear on my VCR and put ""Anger"" first,  because it's the only segment worth watching, believe me.",956275200,4,537,4.617021276595745
