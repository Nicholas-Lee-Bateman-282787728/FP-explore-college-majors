7981276,5,B00008A8H8,"There are now several fine Mahler 5's to choose from on DVD and Blu-ray. This one was the first up and established the high standards you might expect from this combination of conductor and orchestra. One individual feature is the decision to have the important solo horn part in the scherzo played from the front near the conductor.

The interpretation is serious and detailed in the typical Rattle manner and was Rattle's calling card with this orchestra before becoming its full time main conductor. I don't think the Ades work is a major issue of choice. You either like it or you don't. I don't, so I don't play it!

Make no mistake, this performance has all the hallmarks for being considered truly a great one. As with all such performances there is an undeniable sense of 'rightness' and interpretive grip. There is also a strong sense of an interpretive journey being embarked upon and followed and there is never any doubt that the journey will reach its final destination.

The first movement is played rather more heavily than usual with, supported by Rattle's visual gestures, a clear emphasis on emotional exhaustion. The tonal resources of the BPO are a great asset in realising this approach which is accumulatively very powerful in its own way. The mood lightens for the second movement and progressively this change develops throughout the symphony with the final movement having an extraordinary feeling of pure joy. In between the Scherzo third movement prepares us for this with an incisively detailed performance of all the many fluctuations of mood vividly caught and aided by fine horn playing led from the front of the stage as Mahler himself wished. This has the effect of turning the movement into a mini horn concerto. The following slow movement is sensitively played with a slightly more flowing tempo which avoids the cloying romantisism of some other well-known interpretations.

There are two alternatives. Another DVD choice would be the rather controversial interpretation by Gergiev at the Royal Albert Hall during the Prom concerts. The recording, both sonically and visually is closer but excellent in its way - perhaps a little invasive though. This more dramatic approach to the recording, with angled shots of the superb solo trumpeter taken from a close, low viewpoint, suits the type of interpretation which some have found lacking in subtlety. I would also prefer Rattle's approach - but what trumpet playing for Gergiev! It also has Mahler 4 as another somewhat controversial fill-up!

A stronger alternative option for collectors though, is probably that of Abbado at the Lucerne Festival with his special festival orchestra. Abbado is justifiably thought to be the undoubted world authority on Mahler and this is typical of his total mastery of the score. It also comes with a superb Blu-ray presentation - terrific sound and sympathetic visuals. I would describe this as more of an inspirational approach with great emphasis on the chamber resources of the orchestra which is typical of Abbado in Mahler. Choice between rattle and Abbado will be a matter of personal preference as both offer equally valid views and both are wonderfully played and recorded.

In my view, this Rattle performance is very special and is by no means inferior to Abbado. Nor is the recording inferior. Many purchasers will be tempted to buy both and this would be the obvious musical solution. However, for those wanting just one copy I am certain that anyone buying this will be very satisfied indeed. This is fully deserving of a full 5 stars and needs to be thought of on the some exalted level as the Abbado version.",1343520000,2,3647,4.990131578947368
7981277,3,B00008A8H8,"I thought the orchestra ""Rattled"" along at a fair pace once Bunny got his tail up though its the first occasion I have heard that famous opening stanza played with SIX notes since  the Gerard Hoffnung version in the Festival Hall,. I think in 1852. This particular interpretation of the Ludwig Van Breakoven 5th Symphony owes much to the now famous Simon Britten version of The six Sea Interviews.",1229040000,,397,4.753623188405797
