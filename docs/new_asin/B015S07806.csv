I'm highly prejudiced because I was at Wilderness Road State Park when portions of this DVD were being filmed there and because I know lots of the actors and actresses.  In my opinion this is a very accurate, well-researched portrayal of a fascinating part of American history.",1528416000,,331,4.7894736842105265
