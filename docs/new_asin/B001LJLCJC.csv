3683770,4,B001LJLCJC,I really like this video. I have fibromyalgia and this type of yoga practice is very doable for someone with physical limitations.,1360108800,8,130,4.954545454545454
3683771,5,B001LJLCJC,I purchased Restorative Yoga Dvd.  It has been so extremely helpful.  I do it daily and my body and mind has benefited from the calm and soothing poses.  I highly recommend anyone who is looking for yoga with a difference.  Even if the poses are slow and deep it works on all the muscles and nervous system to let go and release.  There are lots of different sessions so you don't get bored. I highly recommend this dvd.,1330560000,8,420,4.333333333333333
3683772,5,B001LJLCJC,"I love this DVD! It is well structured and offers a variety of programs to fit into your schedule. There are programs for morning, afternoon or night with varying lengths of time.  This is exactly what I was looking for!",1324080000,2,220,4.5
3683773,5,B001LJLCJC,"As has been pointed out in other reviews, if you feel that yoga DVDs must be set against stunning visual backdrops then this is not the DVD for you. Most of it is filmed in a simple room with the focus on the teacher. However, if you're looking for a truly gentle, relaxing, and restorative set of routines then you will want to add this to your collection.

The speed is very slow and most of the time you will be relaxing into the posture. There is no flow and no asanas that work on strength; it's all about relaxing your body and using breath and stillness to stretch and release tight muscles. For most people, I don't think this will be a daily practice, but if you're recovering from an injury, have a stressful job, or have mobility issues that do not allow you to practice the strength building asanas, this is a wonderful option (but, as always, check with your primary care physician before starting a yoga program). I have used these routines whilst nursing a shoulder injury, chronic back pain, and to help me unwind after a stressful week or event. I've also found the mid-day routine to be wonderful for helping to relieve tension headaches and even migraines.

The teacher has a soothing voice and she demonstrates the different ways you can set up each asana. You DO need a lot of props but use what is on hand: towels, blankets, pillows, and a strap are essential for these routines. The instructor has a habit of letting out deep sighs as she relaxes into the pose, which some people might find a little odd. It's easy to get used to, however, and sometimes you are sighing along with her! It's important to remember that, occasionally, taking a deep breath and letting it out in a sigh can help you fully relax.

Overall, this is a wonderful addition to my yoga library. I know I will keep using it for years to come and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to someone looking for routines to relieve stress.",1306022400,20,1927,4.484330484330484
3683774,4,B001LJLCJC,"(4.5 stars) I've been exploring and enjoying restorative yoga in recent years.  Somehow, propping the body up on bolsters, blankets, blocks and the like helps the body to let go more freely.  Even power yogis can benefit from the occasional restorative practice because resting into stretches actually helps the body achieve greater flexibility than forcing into stretches.

What I especially like about this DVD is that most of the chapters give you time to arrange your props without need of backtracking.  You also get a lot of material for your money.  I disagree with the review that this DVD is poorly produced.  The instructions are given in a room with draping behind her, but during the time periods where you are resting into your props, footage of Deborah doing the poses at the seashore, in front of a mountain range and in a field also play - if you care to look at the TV, that is.  I prefer to use an eye pillow and get full benefit of each pose.  Deborah also instructs clearly and in an appropriately soft voice, and the gentle music is pretty (light sitar or tambura, occasional tablas, light piano, flute - changes from posture to posture).

My only quibbles are that I wish the poses were held for similar lengths of time.  For example, Mountain Brook is held for about 10 minutes while supported bound angle pose, my all-time favorite restorative, is only held for about 3 minutes.  That, and a matrix would have been a nice option.

All in all I find this more user friendly than Yoga Therapy Prescriptions, which I enjoy tremendously but get frustrated because the chapters start with the demonstrators already propped and ready to go, causing me to have to back track repeatedly.  If you enjoy restorative, some other nice options in addition to Deborah Donohue's offering here include Restorative Bliss Yoga with Skyler Myers and an older offering, Yoga Journal's Yoga for Relaxation and Meditation with Patricia Walden and Rodney Yee.

I'm so happy to see restorative yoga moving into the mainstream.  More yoga studios are offering workshops and even weekly classes, and it's nice to have DVDs for the home practitioner.  I have Judith Lasater's ""Relax and Renew"" which is a lovely book, but I like to take the lazy approach and let a DVD guide my practice.  After all - it is about relaxing.",1304035200,42,2319,4.771929824561403
3683775,4,B001LJLCJC,"This is a lovely restorative yoga practice with many options. You will need a bolster, strap, and blankets. All of the yoga positions are done on the floor with the exception of the morning 1/2 sun salute. Each position is held from 3-8 minutes.

Each practice is composed of recorded segments that are pieced together and many are repeated throughout the DVD, not always my favorite type of practice because it's somewhat choppy. This DVD however is better than many I've tried. The transitions are good, but it would have been better with a matrix-choice menu where you could build your own sequences.

In addition the music is a little too loud. I have to turn my TV up to hear Deborah and then the music is a bit too loud and not the best quality (although I do very much like the soothing flute music). Deborah gives an explanation about getting into the pose and provides a bit of encouragement to relax. Other than that you get to relax and enjoy. I sometimes go into other poses throughout the segments and practice other favorite yin-yoga postures. Her voice is very soothing and DVD is filmed both in the red studio and along the coast and mountains in Santa Barbara.

Here's a run down of the sequence with listing of each posture on the DVD:
Meditation, 12 minutes:
An absolutely wonderful chakra meditation.
Deborah leads you through in Savasana (lying resting pose)

3683776,2,B001LJLCJC,I wasn't thrilled about the production quality of this DVD.  I was expecting something more professional but most of it is shot in a room and it looks quite amateur.  I wouldn't recommend.,1255737600,16,188,4.666666666666667
3683777,5,B001LJLCJC,"In this DVD, instructor Deborah Donahue offers six different sequences, four of which are purely restorative, plus a meditation and a slightly more active morning routine.  She provides live instruction and utilizes various props, including several blankets, a bolster, a strap, and blocks.  The Main Menu of the DVD lists the following options and times for the practices:

*Introduction
*Meditation, 12 minutes
*Morning, 15 minutes
*Mid-Day, 45 minutes
*Evening A, 55 minutes
*Evening B, 55 minutes
*Restful Sleep, 85 minutes
*Credits

Donahue conducts each of the four restorative sessions in a similar manner.  For every posture, she begins by describing the setup, including the props that will be required for the pose.  Then, after providing guidance on how to come into the pose, she simply allows time to rest in the posture, only occasionally providing additional brief reminders on breath or alignment (and sometimes making small sounds, such as ""ahh!"", as well).  Finally, she cues coming out of the pose before moving on to the next one.  Postures are held anywhere from 2-10 minutes (averaging about 5-8 minutes), and each of these four practices ends with the same 15-minute relaxation segment (some of the other segments appear in multiple practices as well).

Restorative Yoga Therapy offers a unique opportunity to practice this worthwhile, relaxing, and very gentle form of yoga at home.  This DVD is appropriate for all levels of yoga practitioners, although some basic familiarity with yoga terms as well as the use of yoga props would definitely be beneficial.",1254528000,122,1582,5.266932270916334
3683778,5,B001LJLCJC,"When I was ill several years I ago, I was looking all over for a DVD such as this and could not find it.  I used Judith Lassiter's book for restorative poses but I do so much better with a DVD.  I am so glad to have found this now.  Although, I am now well, it is wonderful to do restorative poses when you don't feel up to par or just want to really relax into poses. It is a great adjunct to a regular yoga routine.",1254355200,27,417,3.7701149425287355
3683779,5,B001LJLCJC,I was so excited and hopeful to find this Restorative Yoga DVD. I have fibromyalgia and my yoga practice had been suffering because it became too difficult and painful for me to continue my usual routines. I needed guidance and the right instructor to show me the techniques that are gentle and quieting to my body and provide just the right balance for my particular challenges. Deborah Donohue is that instructor and I have been enjoying yoga again and finding a renewed sense of tranquility.,1229990400,79,494,4.823529411764706

3683805,2,B001LJLCJC,"If you don't mind chakra chatter and new age nonsense, you may enjoy this DVD. I would enjoy it more if the instructor just told viewers how to set up for each pose and then let the music work its magic. I would not buy this DVD again and may give it away.",1458000000,5,256,3.849056603773585
3683806,5,B001LJLCJC,"I love this video. Restorative yoga classes are hard to find in my area so I decided to do it at home. This video gives enough options to fit a morning or evening schedule and practice.  you need a bolster and a lot of blankets, but that's how restorative works.",1456185600,9,262,4.24
3683807,5,B001LJLCJC,"Right now this is my favorite yoga DVD.  There are several different sections based on the time of day - morning, meditation, afternoon, night, and restful sleep.  They range from 15 minutes to 85 minutes.  Restful sleep is my favorite - when I can't quiet my mind after a hectic day - it really helps me sleep.  Optimally, you will need a bolster, 6 blankets, and a strap.  You won't need all of that for each section though, so no worries if you don't have it all.  She also gives you several options if you don't have a strap, want to experience a pose a different way, or if you don't feel comfortable in a pose, which is a nice feature.",1453161600,17,641,4.256198347107438

3683810,5,B001LJLCJC,"Restorative Yoga Practice is very gentle.  It has been helpful for my chronic pain.  Ms. Donohue explains how to get into a pose, and sometimes offers alternative positions.  Each pose is held for several minutes.  Props are required for many of the poses.  Props include pillows and blankets, and a strap if you choose to use one.  There are different length options for morning, afternoon, evening, and for before sleep.  I would recommend this video for anyone who is living with chronic pain, because it is gentle and produces good results.",1436227200,6,544,4.912087912087912
3683811,5,B001LJLCJC,"I like this video. It has lots of different segments such as a meditation, morning, mid day and a few evening routine and sleep routine, each caring lengths from 15mins-85mind, which is nice for different lifestyles. The negative reviews I read about, such as her sighing was irrelevant to me. This is a restorative yoga video! And sighing is good for you anyway. Plus she doesn't even sigh that often. All and all this video is great and has many variations for each pose. It is nice to have a bolster for this yoga but if you have a bunch of blankets and pillows you can make it work. There are not a lot of restorative yoga videos out there and I think this one can work just fine for many different people.",1435968000,10,710,4.345864661654136
3683812,5,B001LJLCJC,"My daughter recommended this to me.  I am 68 and have a difficult time now with yoga poses, but this is a very gentle wonderful series of poses.  The hardest part is getting all of the tools together.  Lots of blankets, a bolster, etc.  It takes a while to prepare for each pose, but the results are very very nice.

I would add that the production values are VERY good.  She starts in her home and then the background changes to beaches, mountains and other locales.  The only problem is, that when this is going on you are actually in the poses with eyes closed!  I went through each of the different series ahead of time, and was eager to start after viewing them.

The props are optional, and I was able to use a combination of firm and soft pillows from my living room & rolled towels. After following the pose instructions it was easy to fall into a very relaxed state letting the music carry me along. When it's time to change position the instructor gently begins to speak allowing me time to mentally prepare to transition. It only takes 20-30 seconds to set up the next pose and let myself relax into that position. I'm glad to have found this dvd.",1421712000,19,607,4.527272727272727

I love Mark's awesome sequences, but I do not care for this practice.

As other reviewers have said, there is too many props involved where you find yourself coming out of one pose and needing to scramble around to find other props before the start of a new pose. It would be okay I suppose if there was more time allowed to set up all the props.

I keep trying to give this practice a chance, but I just don't find it relaxing.

I give up and go back to Mark Laham's DVD.",1401753600,4,589,4.051724137931035
3683824,5,B001LJLCJC,"This DVD did exactly what I wanted it to do.  Teach me restorative poses so I can do them on my own.  I will say right off the bat I was annoyed by two things:  1) Her constant sighing ""Ahhhhh"".  It was if she was trying to force me to relax. 2) The same music that played throughout..well I think it never changed.  Those two annoyances taught me to clear my mind and tune things out a bit.  Now I barely hear those things.  I have tried doing my own practice, but do not have the time down yet (I tend to rush things.) So I plan on doing this DVD at least two times a week and I actually look forward to the end of the day when I do it.  Enjoy!",1401667200,3,646,3.8045112781954886
3683825,3,B001LJLCJC,"I use to do yoga on a regular basis until i started suffering from back problems (not related to yoga).

I am now attempting to find a new practice as I simply cannot do many of the more ""standard"" yoga moves. I read many reviews and many Dr. suggested restorative yoga for my type of back problem, which is why I purchased this DVD.

This is not a horrible DVD by any means, however, its just not what I was hoping for.

The instructor is very soothing and obviously knows her stuff, which was nice - she details the pose extremely well and gives you plenty of time to get into the pose.

However, the ""set up"" for each pose is soooo long. You need a minimum of 3 to 4 blankets, a bolster and a brick - which is fine (and is clearly indicated) so no big surprise, but what I thought disrupted my flow was the set up of each pose. Wow, it takes between 2 to 3 minutes to set up the blankets ""just so"" and then the bolster and then your body on all this equipment. It just disrupts my flow too much and for me, flow is important.

I do love the meditation at the beginning of the DVD (which I do every day), but I am going to look for something a tad more challenging with much less set up time.",1391299200,3,1194,4.0210970464135025
3683826,5,B001LJLCJC,Everything was as I had hoped.  I am very pleased with packaging and the received results. I would buy from this resource again.  Very reasonable and clear communication with follow up. Good pace on the instruction,1381622400,,214,4.916666666666667
3683827,2,B001LJLCJC,"If you are looking for a beginner-gentle yoga DVD, this might not be the one for you!  First, there are so many accessories needed for each move that it is difficult to have a smooth and relaxing flow.  To do the yoga moves you need four blankets or beach towels, a bolster, and a strap. Everytime the instructor started a different position, you had to remove the accessories and restructure your mat with new ones. Very time consuming.  Once you were in the pose it was relaxing, but not relaxing getting there.  I liked that she stayed in a pose for a long time rather than jumping from one to the next, but did not like all that was needed to do the poses.",1374278400,13,660,4.298387096774194
3683828,1,B001LJLCJC,"I was very excited to give this dvd a try after reading all the positive reviews. But when I went to play it, it was skipping and freezing and I was unable to use on either dvd player in my house.

Unfortunately, I did not try it before the return window was up. It's certainly my fault for not getting to it before the month was up but even when an item is defective, Amazon will not return for a replacement or full refund after thirty days. I can see that I was not the only one to receive a faulty video so my advice to you is if you buy this dvd, make sure to try it immediately to make sure you did not receive a defective product as well.",1371427200,6,645,3.9236641221374047
3683829,2,B001LJLCJC,"If you don't own 4 - 5 yoga blankets then don't bother w/this video.  You can't substitute yoga blanket w/other blankets because of the different density in different blankets.  Yoga blankets are specific and therefore that's why this instructor uses yoga blankets vs other types.  I am new to yoga and own the bolster, strap, mat and (1) blanket and THIS video.  Yoga props are expensive.  This instructor should know the expense of these items and take that into consideration for the beginner student and offer some instruction using a single blanket.  The instructor should include in her descrption of her video the items necessary in order to benefit from her video.",1370390400,14,672,4.955357142857143
8318261,3,B001LJLCJC,"This DVD has some great poses and the ambiance it creates is superb. However, one critique would be in regard to video layout, Perhaps the makers would consider options for durations? E.g. One menu option would offer a tutorial of the various poses then other options would offer durations for each pose - for instance, 1 minute, 5 minutes, or 10 minutes.",1526083200,,355,4.741935483870968

8318267,2,B001LJLCJC,"This dvd is very basic and you need a lot of things to do this. I wanted something that didn't need so many blankets, bolster, towels and a bit more to get into a more regular yoga. It was comfortable and feels awesome for recovering surgery and getting back to things. But now I no longer find it challenging and wish it had the next step.",1507507200,,340,4.166666666666667
