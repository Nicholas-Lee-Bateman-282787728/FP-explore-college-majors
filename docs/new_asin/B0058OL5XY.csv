8462018,2,B0058OL5XY,"Title says it all.  A friend used this DVD to study for the pre-trip inspection and was failed for something that wasn't on the DVD.  Funny thing is, where he took the test is the company that produced this DVD...  Just a money grab.  Avoid.",1327449600,2,241,4.288888888888889
8462019,5,B0058OL5XY,I purchased this dvd about a month ago & watched it everyday twice a day. It was very informal on what you need to do on all 3 parts of the cdl test. It taught and showed me what i needed to look for & explain for the pre trip. It showed & gave me pointers for the basic skills test & the on road driving test. It removed all the guess work out of not knowing what to do. I just took my first class A cdl test on 09-12-11 & passed all 3 parts just from watching this dvd. I like to thank the people at cdlsr for making this video. I highly recomend this instructional dvd for anyone wanting to pass the test.,1315785600,11,608,3.8333333333333335
