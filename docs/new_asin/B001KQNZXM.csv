3668310,4,B001KQNZXM,"I've thought of Ricky Gervais as many things, but not ""romantic-comedy star."" But for those willing to take a visit to GHOST TOWN, you'll find him to be a pleasantly agreeable star after-all.

Not that Gervais' Dr. Pincus, a dentist, is pleasant. He's a quiet man, eager to do all he can to stay away from his fellow man, whether by sneaking past an office party for the exit, or not holding an elevator door open for a fellow apartment building dweller. He has disdain for ALL of mankind, and chose the life of a dentist because he can pretty much keep his patients from talking by opening their mouths and shoving things in them. Gervais, as we know from his work on THE OFFICE and EXTRAS, is perfect at this sort of misanthropic character. Unengaged with those around him, full of easy (and hilarious) contempt. The smart remarks he tosses off under his breath are quite funny. Frankly, he reminded me of something akin to Hugh Grant's older, more unpleasant brother.

Early in the film, Dr. Pincus goes in to the hospital for some minor surgery in a very indelicate spot on his body. To avoid the humiliation, he insists on a general anesthetic...and something goes wrong. He dies for seven minutes (""a little less than seven""), and when he comes to, he can suddenly see, be seen by, and interact with ghosts. And New York City is FULL of ghosts. They're all ""people"" with unfinished business, and in Dr. Pincus, they see a chance to finally get someone to finish their business for them so they can ""move on."" One particular ghost, played with his usual oily ease, is Greg Kinnear, who wants Gervais to bust up the impending marriage between his widow (Tea Leoni) and a no-good human rights attorney (Billy Campbell...looking 15 years older all of a sudden). Gervais only agrees to try this because a) Kinnear can get the other ghosts to leave him alone, and b) he actually finds Leoni interesting.

If all this sounds very familiar, I'll admit right here that although I've never seen this EXACT formula, it does sound like a mix of ghost movies from TOPPER to GHOST. But GHOST TOWN is its own unique creation, primarily because Gervais is unlike any other actor we've seen in such a role. He's an amazingly quick wit. Listen carefully, and you'll find yourself laughing out loud at half the things he says. He also is quite convincing when he begins to open up his heart just a little bit more. We see, of course, that there is a good but wounded man underneath all the nastiness.

The film holds no real surprises, but it does get many familiar pleasures right. That Leoni has never become a bigger star has always dismayed me...she's super intelligent but excellent at vulnerability...and she's capable of being funny as hell. In GHOST TOWN, she and Gervais develop a most tentative but very engaging relationship. It is...dare I say it...sweet.

Kinnear and the supporting cast are all okay, but nothing more. There are some moving moments near the end involving the other ghosts...but mostly, this is Gervais' film...ably assisted by Leoni. It feels old fashioned yet modern too. And if it weren't for two totally unneeded ""f-bombs""...it would be quite suitable for ages 13 and up. But then again, this is a love story about two folks in their `40s...how many people will THAT turn off? For me, a man IN his `40s...I liked it and hope that the film finds the audience it deserves.",1228694400,41,3391,4.673366834170854

3668312,5,B001KQNZXM,"A Brit in New York dies on the operating table. After being resuscitated, discharged and leaving the hospital, he finds he can see and communicate not only with the living, but also with the dead. As soon as the dead discover his secret they just won't leave him alone...
I have always found Ricky Gervais (The Office, Extras) incredibly Englishly funny. In Ghost Town he did not disappoint. He was hilarious from the first to the last minute, what facial expressions! But what got to me, was how sexy his character, Dr Pincus, became as he developed as a character throughout the film. By the end of the film I was positively infatuated with Dr Pincus! The contrasting setting (New York) added to the sense of Englishnes mentioned. Excellent.
The film is not just a thigh-slapper though, particularly the middle of the film is quite touching. It makes a pleasant 'Christmas story' (although not set during Christmas, it smacks of being somewhat Dickensian in its theme), has that feel-good factor, and could even pass for romantic comedy.
Lots of quotable one-liners.",1227830400,54,1068,4.906077348066298
3668313,5,B001KQNZXM,"One of the funniest movies I've seen in quite some time. I absolutely adore Ricky Gervais in this, and he and Tea Leoni seem to have great chemistry together, especially during a dinner scene. I almost wonder if Tea wasn't genuinely laughing at Ricky's witty comments. I laughed so much and cried towards the end. Romantic comedy with so much more kick than the generic Rom-coms.  It really is a special movie, one I'll enjoy re-watching again. British humor for the win.",1520035200,,471,4.7439024390243905
3668314,5,B001KQNZXM,This was brilliant. How did I ever miss this one?  I love Ricky Gervais' brand of humor.  And Kristen Wiig as his doctor had me laughing out loud!,1519516800,,146,4.178571428571429
3668315,5,B001KQNZXM,"So many comedies seem to either be formulaic rom-coms, sophomoric college boy humor, or silly slapstick, but this was none of those things, so quite refreshing. We all enjoyed it.",1515110400,,179,5.0
3668316,4,B001KQNZXM,"I was looking for a light stupid movie to while away an afternoon, and was this ever NOT that.  It was very sweet, well-acted, thoughtful, and full of unexpected twists and turns.  Tea Leoni, as always, was the best thing in the movie, but Ricky Gervais was also excellent.  Very moving.  I actually ended up in tears at several points.  Highly recommended.  I'd give it 4 1/2 stars - not a classic but definitely worth watching.",1514937600,,429,4.578947368421052

3668322,5,B001KQNZXM,"Ricky Gervais is almost, not quite, but VERY nearly there, almost a modern day Charlie Chaplin for sure. Gets you to really laugh and cry in the same film. So totally brilliant. I love that and though Charlie was way outside my generation I saw his films enough to really, truly appreciate that to know that this was at least somewhat in that style but in Ricky's own unique special style instead. It's a true genius of writing here for sure. Now some may not know that in real life he's admitted to being an atheist and doesn't believe in ghosts so this is even a more incredible work after knowing all that about him as a person. I mean, really, wow. To set aside your beliefs for even just a little while to make a beautiful film like this is spectacularly amazing. You just have to think about it. In real life he discards the belief in ghosts completely and the afterlife and to make something like this ANYWAY?? Just beautiful. Just absolutely beautiful. I highly recommend it. Now you look at his final ""Office"" scene and you'll know that for sure. So SAD. Tear jerking scene after all so much comedy. I feel in my heart he was trying as best he could to follow Charlie Chaplin. To get a laugh AND a cry out of you in the same flick.",1510617600,2,1240,4.32618025751073

The idea of ghosts and life after death fascinates me and this movie pulled in things I believe. The ending was pretty near perfect although slightly predictable. You will laugh and cry and probably get mad a few times. Totally a keeper.",1501200000,2,392,4.157894736842105

3668346,3,B001KQNZXM,"Pincus is a dentist and a loner that hates interacting with people to the point of being obnoxious. One day, he goes in for a colonoscopy and dies on the operating table and is resuscitated, but is brought back. The unexpected side effect is that now he can see dead people walking around Manhattan and they realize that he can see them. It turns out that they cannot find peace until they resolve a problem and hound him for his help. He, on the other hand, doesn't give a damn. One particular ghost, areal scumbag, is more persuasive than the others and convinces him to try to persuade his widowed wife (Tea Leoni) not to get remarried. Predictably, he falls in love with her (considering it's Tea Leoni, that's totally understandable).

Although there are many good, funny moments, my problem with the film is the unrealistic transition that Pincus makes from being a misanthrope to a smooth talker. Plus, of course, the predictable ending.",1478908800,,944,4.7560975609756095

He really does try to make it funny, but it just doesn't find its mark.
For the sake of trying to be funny, there is quite some inconsistencies: How does someone that hates people and is supposedly a recluse, all of a sudden become so charming and confident in his ability with the ladies? Why does the movie all of sudden try to show him in a good light, when he is clearly a horrible person? Why is the boyfriend trying to save the planet cast as the bad guy?
Trying to contrive a romantic moment when they both touch a hands why feeling up a mummy? Please! There is depth to Ricky's characters or any saving grace that gives the viewer an understanding of why the girl would go for him.

3668411,5,B001KQNZXM,"It's great to see a story without cynicism. Perhaps it's a romantic comedy, but it also speaks to the core value that all of us have, or need to find, in our lives, and that makes it more than a rom-com.
And then, also, this easily could have been maudlin, trite, over-wrought or pseudo-mystical, but instead the screenplay steered a nuanced course avoiding all those ""reefs"". So it ends up as a story with heart, and just as the movie's characters changed for the better, maybe you will, too, by watching it.",1454716800,,509,4.543478260869565
3668412,5,B001KQNZXM,"Either you think Gervais is hilarious or you do not. I am from the first camp and thought this movie was hilarious. All the actors are top notch and the scenes in the hospital with Kristen Wiig and the lawyer are fall down funny, as are the scenes with his poor doorman and his beleaguered coworker. But even the scenes where Gervais is alone talking to himself are hysterical.

Like the 'Invention Of Lying', Gervais manages again to hit the sweet spot between too mean and too sweet, a tough balancing act.",1454630400,,508,4.521739130434782

3668422,5,B001KQNZXM,Very funny movie!,1452556800,,17,5.0
3668423,5,B001KQNZXM,"The story is simple: Pincus, a lonely self-centered dentist, wakes up from a near death experience with the ability to speak with the dead. If you enjoy stories that have a supernatural side, you'll love the quaint and bittersweet encounters with Pincus and his new unwanted ghostly friends as they seek his assistance to resolve their unfinished business on Earth. I really enjoyed the performances of the supporting characters. Gwen, played by Tea Leoni is the recent widow of Frank, her pompous and uncaring husband, played by Greg Kinnear. Greg, realizing that he had been a jerk while he was alive, pursues Pincas relentlessly until he agrees to help him mend his wife's broken heart.

Beautiful cinematography with a refreshing and original sound track, director David Koepp hits all the right notes to deliver a wonderfully poignant and humorous movie.  I watched this movie when it first came out in 2008 and just watched it again today.  I laughed and cried in all the same places.",1452297600,,990,4.951807228915663

It's about a guy who is a successful jerk that realizes after being enlightened by experiences with spirits that being a jerk really isn't going to help him in life. He realizes there are reasons to help others and to be happy. There's lots to be happy about and the only way to be happy is to let go of his old ways.

3668560,5,B001KQNZXM,"I was the first generation born, that has not known a world without television.

My sister has said, ""My mom bought a TV in 1948, and it has not been turned off since""

The TV was always on when I was in bed, and I still cannot go to sleep without it.

A while back, admitting you were an avid TV watcher, would label you in many negative ways, among people who considered it ""mental masturbation"", unless you made a point to say you only watched PBS, and you could prove it if a discussion about ""Faulty Towers"" ensued.

Today, with TV and the Internet merged with social media, and people texting and tweeting constantly, it is almost a badge of honor in the same circles, to only have ""antenna TV"", and watch the same shows that were once ""sniffed"" at.

But what TV did for me, was give me an appreciation of the art of acting, writing, directing, art direction, editing...........

I grew up watching ""I Love Lucy"", "" The Dick Van Dyke Show"", ""The Andy Griffith Show"", ""The Twilight Zone"", and many more.

Of course ""I Love Lucy"" is revered for the unbelievable talent of Lucille Ball and her costars, as well, and (one of?) the first shows to be shot with 3 cameras, and be saved on film.

But watching it everyday, from a very young age, then seeing every episode many times as an adult, I began to see how unbelievable the writing was.  There were usually at least 2 or 3 sub-plots in a half hour comedy show.  Most movies now, do not have close to that, or the equivalent,  in a 2 hour script.

As a grade schooler, I watched ""The Alfred HItchcock Show"" every monday night from 10PM to 11.

I remember begging my mom, who was divorced, to watch it with me, but she always said she would listen to it from her bedroom, which was right next to the TV room.

I would sit at the table, and draw with my crayons, and watch Alfred Hitchcock, alone.

Because of this early exposure to such brilliance, I believe I developed an astute eye when it comes to film, writing etc.

I have both of Rick Gervais's movies, ""Ghost Town"" and ""The Invention of Lying""  in the top 15 of my favorite movie list.

I saw a special on HBO a few years ago, with several comedians talking about their craft.  It was Seinfeld, Rock, Gervais, Louis C.K., I believe.

One of the things Ricky admitted to, was cutting what he considered ""throw away"" jokes from CD's recorded live from his act.  He said he wanted all the jokes to be high quality.

You can see his perfectionism in these two movies.  They may appear to be nice ""little"" films, but they are impeccably written, directed, cast, and acted.

So many movies I see now, are lazy, with easily discerned ""holes"" in the script.  And if they have a watchability, you overlook it.

I also absolutely LOVE the way Ricky adds an element of fantasy that is intriguing, and so artfully done, that it contributes to the viewer being able to ""live"" in another world for 2 hours.

With Ricky's ascerbic stand-up style, it is surprising to see how much of his own life experience and pain comes through, how touching and poignant his writing is, while still being so witty, and funny, and not missing a second in a scene where the slightest nuance can add dimension to the character or story.

He takes comedy, fantasy, and some of the most touching writing, and blends it perfectly.  And this would never be accomplished without the incredibly delicate hand he uses to make the transitions of the characters from beginning to end, so believable.",1415750400,3,3470,4.454833597464343

Greg Kinnear and Gervais work well against each other  as do the actors playing cameo roles. Jeff Tweedy fans will recognize some Wilco in the film, and New York offers a beautiful backdrop for the story whose object lesson more people would do well to learn.

Tia Leoni is fabulous in this and her performance gives the movie it's heart and soul. Overall even though the story seems implausible the screenplay is intelligent and funny and all the main characters are  well conceived and well acted. Gregg Kinear as the deceased husband and the primary ghost character is also excellent. THis is a lighted hearted comedy with in the end an uplifting redemption angle that is well worth spending a couple of hours with.,1401926400,,659,4.883928571428571
3668615,5,B001KQNZXM,"Hilarious movie! I love Ricky Gervais and Greg Kinnear! And the supporting characters are a perfect fit!! Great story, constant laughs, and touching as well. I love this movie so much that I purchased it!  If you like to laugh, this movie is for you!",1401926400,2,250,4.555555555555555
3668616,4,B001KQNZXM,"There are a lot of ghosts in this movie, and I am not just talking about the characters. I'm thinking of the ghost of Shrek, or the Jack Nicholson character in As Good as it Gets, or perhaps even Ebenezer Scrooge -- especially Bill Murray's turbo-charged portrayal of the old humbug in the movie Scrooged. Like these characters in stories from the past, the main character of Ghost Town, played by Ricky Gervais, is an antisocial misanthrope. In the course of the movie, his heart opens up and he is saved -- by love. All pretty standard, in general terms.

But the specifics are somewhat novel. Gervais' character, Dr Pincus, dies temporarily during a colonoscopy that goes off the rails, and when he is released from the hospital, he discovers that he can see and hear ghosts -- a fact that horrifies him but excites the ghosts, because they have ""unresolved issues"" that they need somebody who's living to help them with.

The key thing is that this gentle story is told really well. The plot has some delightful symmetries. At first it seems as if the main character has been made a dentist simply so we can see him stuffing things into his patients' mouths to shut them up. But no, the plot turns on his occupation: He is able to make a dental diagnosis after looking at the teeth of an Egyptian mummy that makes it possible for him to get close to the lovely Tea Leoni. We learn the touching back stories of several of the ghosts.

But in the end, this is a comedy and a very good one. My wife and I laughed along with our nineteen-year old daughter from one scene to another. The scene in the hospital where Gervais learns from the doctor and the hospital's lawyer that he was technically dead for seven minutes (""less than seven minutes,"" the lawyer corrects) is a side-splitting classic, but there are plenty of great scenes. It's not quite a five-star comedy like, oh, several of Bill Murray's greatest hits: What About Bob? or Scrooged, or Groundhog Day, or Rushmore. But it's a totally solid four-star effort.

Two small notes -- one positive, one negative.

The positive has to do with the character of Tea Leoni's new boyfriend/fianc. We are introduced to him through the eyes of Greg Kinnear, Leoni's recently-dead husband, who is, of course, jealous of his replacement. So we think at first that the new boyfriend is a fraud or a gold-digger or something worse. But he's not. He is instead exactly what he appears to be: a humorless guy, maybe even a bit pompous, but in the end, a good and decent man.

The negative has to do with a single word. We watched Ghost Town again recently after seeing another wonderful indie film, Today's Special, which stars Aasif Mandvi (Ghost Town, Today's Special, The Proposal, The Dictator, Spiderman 2). Mandvi plays a small but important part in Ghost Town as the other dentist that Ricky Gervais shares an office with. Mandvi's gentle humanitarian Hindu dentist is a perfect foil to the people-hating Gervais. And so it's appropriate that it is Mandvi who finally gives Gervais the diagnosis that he desperately needs to hear: that he's a jerk. Unfortunately, the writers nodded here, because the line that Mandvi, if he were real, would have uttered (""You're a jerk"") is badly marred by the addition of an f-bomb (""You're an f-ing jerk""). Utterly inappropriate to Mandvi's character and jarring. It's a pathetic commentary on our society that Hollywood writers feel the need to avoid that dreaded PG rating.

But now you've been warned about that -- and it's just about the only false-step in an otherwise very sure-footed story. I recommend it.",1401667200,7,3601,4.715421303656598

3668647,5,B001KQNZXM,"I was visiting my daughter and son-in-law in Seattle, and we decided to watch a scifi movie. Of all things, our search netted Ghost Town. (Such is the difficulty with the ghost genre--there is no ghost genre; you find ghosts when you least expect them.) Anyhow, ghost aficionado that I am, I jumped at the chance to view this movie.

I was not disappointed.

Following a routine medical procedure, curmudgeonly dentist Bertram Pincus wakes up with a disconcerting ability to see dead people, the most annoying of whom demands Bertram's help in rescuing his widowed wife from a loveless love affair. Dr. Pincus is a most reluctant accomplice, not because he's afraid so much as because he dislikes people, living or dead. This ghost gives Dr. Pincus an offer he cannot refuse; namely, said ghost will do away with all the other tiresome ghosts.

After meeting Gwen, the wife in question, Dr. Pincus decides the best way to extricate Gwen from her fiance's clutches is to woo her himself. One small problem--the aforementioned curmudgeonliness hinders romance. Ah, but it fosters humor.

Can a misanthrope find true love? You'll have to watch to find out.

For me, Ghost Town is a delight. I laughed out loud through 80% of the movie. The other 20% of the time? I donned the dopey smile of an incurable romantic.",1378166400,,1310,4.804444444444444

Although we had originally rented the DVD I have since ordered a copy for our collection and I already look forward to watching it again.

Ricky Gervais does a fantastic job as a dentist who inadvertently develops the ability to see dead people. Fortunately the dead people he encounters are all touching and sympathetic and delighted beyond words to encounter a living person who can still see them. Each of them has their lives marked incomplete until one last thing is accomplished and that requires the cooperation of a living person who can see and hear them just like the Gervais character, Dr. Pincus.

- In many scenes, the characters just kept talking and talking without humor. For example, the scene in the bar where one of the living guy kept bothering the dead. The living guy told the dead what to drink and what not to drink, etc.

- The main character's personality is not friendly at all. For example, when one of his co-workers invited him to join the celebration in the office because his wife just gave birth to a baby girl, he just stared at the guy and said ""Start without me"". Then later, he just sneaked out of the office.

In another scene, he just got into the elevator. Another lady with some luggage asked him to hold the door for her, he said ""Yes"", but he continuously press the ""Close door"" button instead. How can that be hilarious?

Fast forward several years later, I found Ricky Gervais taking the lead role in Ghost Town. Personally, I think the movie could be a better movie if somebody else is casted in Gervais' role. Why? Gervais was a dentist in the movie, but you just can't overlook his set of crooked teeth. I have never met a dentist in my life that doesn't have good teeth. Secondly, there was absolutely no on-screen chemistry between Gervais and actress Leoni. Lastly, Gervais isn't the type of versatile comedian-actor like Andrea Martin or John Candy whom can create unique and memorable characters at a drop of a hat.

3668696,5,B001KQNZXM,"GHOST TOWN (2008) is an ideal Halloween season movie, a romantic comedy that in overview is the story of a misanthrope who, as an aftereffect of spectral importuning, reclaims his humanity and finds happiness.

Ricky Gervais is wryly marvelous as Dr. Bertram Pincus, a British dentist who emigrated to NYC to follow the woman he loved. She later left him for someone else. Now, he has no tolerance for people and lives in miserable isolation, when not stuffing things in the mouths of patients to stop their incessant chattering.

Pincus has an allergic reaction to anesthesia given during a colonoscopy and he dies... for seven minutes. After being revived, he's got the unique ability to see and speak with dozens of ghosts. They follow him everywhere at first, begging Pincus help them find peace by relaying messages to loved ones and acquaintances of theirs. If Pincus has no time for the living, he's even more short-tempered with these spooks.

Greg Kinnear is one of them. In life, Frank Herlihy was a man of wealth and a weasel who cheated on his wife, Gwen (T&eacute;a Leoni), an Egyptologist who gives lectures on Dynastic mummies. After being crushed by a falling wall air conditioner, all Frank's spirit wants to do now is keep Gwen from marrying an idealistic lawyer named Richard (Blly Campbell) that (Frank tells Pincus) is trying to steal Gwen's inheritance.

By promising to rid him of the other pestering ghosts, Frank gets Pincus to try and prevent Gwen's impending marriage to Richard. Pincus, who isn't very tall, isn't too attractive and certainly isn't charming, thinks he can make Gwen fall in love with him. A bemused Frank tags along and offers advice that Pincus ignores. As improbable as it seems at first, the curmudgeonly dentist does get Gwen to care for him. But will she break her engagement with handsome, suave Richard?

A genuinely funny story told through witty dialogue and sight gag, it's done in traditional style (no goshawful shakycam!). With several bellylaugh moments and just enough plot uncertainty, everything comes to a very satisfying conclusion. Most highly recommended!",1318291200,,2121,5.031339031339031

It is probably okay for family viewing, w/o the offensive raw sex and profanity that so many films are ruined by.

3668699,5,B001KQNZXM,"I had only seen Ricky Gervais in ""Night at the Museum"" and I didn't know who he was and I wasn't impressed by him at all - although I like Ben Stiller very much.

So since then I found out that Ricky Gervais is supposed to be a great comedian, so I purchased ""The Office"" and I watched about ten minutes of it and couldn't watch any more.  Although ""The Office"" DVDs make great coasters!

So that brings me to ""Ghost Town.""  This was definitely my wife's pick but I was surprised to have enjoyed it myself.

Overall I thought ""Ghost Town"" was a very good movie and I did not expect to like it, so it was able to overcome the inertia of my negative anticipation.  I really like Ta Leoni because she seems so ""down to earth"" and genuine in the movies that I've seen her star in.  I also liked the supporting cast of ""dead people"" and the development of Dr. Bertram Pincus from an incredibly rude and self-centered people hater to someone who cares outside of himself.

The story line has some startling twists that kept it from being predictable which is something that I really appreciate in a good story.

One thing I couldn't understand about this movie was I guess people find it funny when Ricky Gervais gags?  There must have been at least three different scenes where he gags - and I don't find that amusing.  And since _he_ was playing a dentist - I would imagine that those around _him_ would be gagging - not he himself!  Is that one of his standard jokes or something?

So now I've seen Ricky Gervais in ""Ghost Town"" and I'm still not really impressed by him - although I like Greg Kinnear very much.",1314835200,,1609,4.34113712374582

3668702,4,B001KQNZXM,"You are a functioning dentist -by some definitions - minding your own pathetic business as a very solitary, ill-mannered person, when one day you discover that during your recent colonoscopy, you... died.  You were actually dead for 7 minutes, but brought back to life.  Too bad you signed all those forms absolving the hospital of any misdeeds, in advance.

Oh, well.  No harm done, right?  Wrong.

The dentist played by Ricky Gervis finds that the world is full of ""people"" dead but in a purgatory, with unfinished business.  And since he was dead, at least for a short time, Bertram (Gervais) can see and hear them, but others living cannot.  When the dead learn about this, they pester Bertram relentlessly to help them.  Bertram didn't particularly like living people, and the dead are not on his list of favorites for certain.  One ""ghost,"" Frank (played by Greg Kinnear), takes charge and will keep the other ""spirits"" at bay if Bertram helps him break off the romance between his ex-wife and an activist human rights lawyer.  Frantic to regain peace and quiet, Bertram agrees.

3668703,1,B001KQNZXM,"Looking at the previous reviews, I'm clearly in the minority about this movie.  I had high hopes for ""Ghost Town,"" but it just didn't deliver.

It's a bad sign when the movie leads with poop jokes.  I'm not opposed to them, but they are trite and cliche.  It doesn't help that Ricky Gervais and Greg Kinnear both play characters that are unlikeable and reprehensible, at least at the start of the film.  Next thing you know, you're 30 minutes into the film, and there have been maybe a couple of laughs.  That's bad when the movie is supposed to be a comedy.

The sad thing is that the cast is talented and funny, and have all done much better work - from the amazing Ricky Gervais (the BBC Office, The Invention of Lying) to Tea Leoni (Flirting with Disaster, Flying Blind) to Kristin Wiig (SNL).  The writer is responsible for well over a billion dollars of box office, including the original Mission Impossible.  On paper, this movie is dynamite.  Unfortunately, for me it just didn't translate into anything funny on screen.  My guess is that the writer is relatively inexperienced as a director, and given that comedy is notoriously hard to direct, ""Ghost Town"" ends up falling flat.

However, given that I'm in the minority here, you may want to give this a rent.  What's the worst that could happen?  If you hate it after 30 minutes, kick it out of your player and return it.  If you hate it after 30 minutes, you're not going to change your mind later on, and if you love the first 30 minutes, you'll want to watch the whole thing.",1306108800,6,1539,4.505415162454874

3668710,5,B001KQNZXM,"This delightful romantic comedy stars Ricky Gervais, Greg Kinnear, and Tea Leoni. A dentist named Bertram Pincus (Gervais) has zero people skills and in fact despises people so much, it is surprising he didn't choose a different career such as hermit or public executioner. And as though life isn't tough enough for Pincus, he acquires the ability to see and speak with ghosts as a result of faulty anesthetic.

The ghosts are people who had unresolved issues at the time of their deaths and they all want Pincus to help them. For a man like Pincus, this is a disaster, as he has spent most of his life avoiding the living and now he's being haunted almost nonstop. However, things get even more complicated when one of the ghosts, Frank Herlihy (Kinnear), pesters Pincus into helping him break up his widow's engagement. This is a particularly difficult task since her fianc is handsome, fit, wealthy, and a great humanitarian, whereas Pincus is plain, plump, and spectacularly obnoxious. In addition, Pincus has offended and antagonized Gwen several times in the past.

There are a lot of laughs in this movie and it is a very definite ""feel good"" romance.",1285718400,,1158,4.843434343434343

3668713,4,B001KQNZXM,"Ghost Town isn't necessarily a BAD film.  It has its moments.  The storyline itself isn't too great, however.  A guy has a near death experience on the operating table, and upon leaving the hospital he realizes he can see and communicate with walking dead people.  It's a comedy with a little bit of drama thrown in sometimes.

The storytelling has its moments of blandness from time to time, which is why I'm not rating the film higher.  Some of the humor is a bit on the unsatisfactory side as well.

There will be times where you think the humor should click, but you're not actually laughing.  However, this could very well be an acquired taste thanks to the lead actor being portrayed by Ricky Gervais.  His style of humor is not for everyone.  I don't know if it's a British style, or just HIS personal style, but to me the humor feels like it misses the mark several times throughout Ghost Town.

The actor who plays the ghost following Ricky's character around everywhere is another person I don't particularly care for.

Anyway, my favorite moments basically come from all the little things, such as a scene where Ricky's character has a dog breathing right next to him and he feels uncomfortable about it, and many times when he communicates with the woman who plays the lead actress, many of these conversations become hilarious because apparently Ricky doesn't know how to properly talk to her.

That leads me to mention the storyline.  It's about this one persistent ghost (the one who follows Ricky Gervais around everywhere) who wants Ricky to talk to his ex-wife (who's alive) so she knows her dead husband (ex-husband actually- you'll find out what I mean about this when you watch it) still loves her very much.  Not a particularly interesting or original concept, but let's just move along.

Of course, you can fully expect many scenes showing Ricky talking to ghosts that nobody else can see, so it appears like Ricky is talking to himself.  This has been done several times in other movies and cartoons pertaining to the same concept, so you can expect more of the same here.

Just an average film to me.  The humor makes an occasional appearance, but it's nothing earth-shattering or anything.  It tries to be funnier than it really is.

Usually movies that star Ricky Gervais make me sick.  This is because I normally don't think he's a very funny comedian and he strikes me as somewhat egotistical.  However in this case, this rare case... he's actually pretty good.  Ironic as it is, he actually plays an egotistical person.  Perhaps because he's only acting the part in Ghost Town it makes me think differently of him.

Anyway the movie's about Ricky being so self-centered and selfish that he misses the bigger picture- that he won't allow himself to open up to others and goes around acting like a meanie.  When Greg Kinnear's character dies after a freak accident however, he comes back as a ghost -along with several other people including the persistent Dana Ivey- and because Ricky has an unusual ability to actually see and communicate with ghosts, Greg and the other ghosts insist on pestering Ricky nonstop and following him around the city street until Ricky is able to finally give in and get Greg to make peace with his wife (Tea Leoni).

However Ricky develops a fondness for Tea making things difficult for Greg's character, and causes friction between him and Ricky.  Hilarious when Greg tells Ricky when he's able to bring peace to Greg and Tea, then ALL the ghosts will leave Ricky alone.  Also slightly amusing are the scenes when Ricky talks to a real human being, the ghosts are surrounding him and making the conversation confusing for the other person because it appears Ricky is talking to himself and looks like a total nut!  Of course Ricky can't say he's actually talking to ghosts because nobody will believe him.

The storyline's a little strange because instead of focusing on ghosts wanting to contact their relatives and spouses to assure they're in a safe place and in a state of peace, the story is more about making Ricky less of a jerk and more approachable and nicer towards other people.  That seems like an odd way to write the story to me.  There is one tear-jerking moment near the end when the story shifts to the ghosts finally feeling content after Ricky makes contact with their relatives and friends, and afterwards the ghosts fade away because their problems have been resolved.  The music that plays here makes the scene even sadder.

The movie is clearly a comedy however, and sometimes the humor doesn't work when certain scenes drag (such as the one where Ricky's trying desperately to squeeze out any information he can with Tea's husband (Billy Campbell) who's about to discuss a personal matter but changes his mind, and Ricky -who's a dentist- insists that Billy share what's on his mind so Ricky can get one step closer to Tea which means one step closer to settling the relationship between Greg's ghost and Tea.  Also the um, studying/repeating jokes concerning the subject of a big weiner involving Ricky and Tea are sort of hilarious.  A lawsuit part of the storyline involving one of the nurses is also hilarious mostly for the nurses replies.

This movie is just barely a 4-star recommendable purchase.  I mean just barely!  Greg Kinnear reminds me of a generic 80's actor who's easily replaceable, and the humor is very light overall and mocks death quite a bit which might rub people the wrong way.

3668721,4,B001KQNZXM,"(contains minor spoilers about the plot)

The premise is a smart one: a people-hating loner dentist called Dr. Pincus (Ricky Gervais) dies for 7 minutes because of an anesthetic SNAFU at a routine colonoscopy - as a result he not only sees the ghosts of New York City, but is constantly bothered by them and their requests for him to finish their unfinished duties. One in particular, Frank, a two faced fast talker played by Greg Kinnear, tries to get Pincus to get a bit closer to his archeologist ex-wife (Tea Leoni) - albeit for some very dubious goals of his own.

Ricky Gervais (""The Office"" (UK), ""Extras"") plays the grumpy unsocial dentist in a simply superb way. He displays a range of emotions and comedic skills - often nothing more than a facial expression - unlike anything we've ever seen from him. Pincus' visits to the hospital are exceptionally hilarious and filled with deliciously funny Gervais one-liners.

There's a funny cameo from Kristin Wiig, playing her usual ""the awkwardly babbling woman"" character as Pincus' doctor.

The only problem with this movie: the story JUST doesn't hold up until the end. When it starts getting closer to the part where Tea Leoni's character begins to get an idea that Pincus ""sees"" Frank, the movie just doesn't know where to go and how to end it.

Frank Herlihy (Greg Kinnear) a recently dispatched philandering husband still hangs around in the ether. Soon Bertram Pincus D.D.S.

So as tradition has it Frank recruits Bertram to protect Frank's widow from marrying what seems like an unseemly person. Naturally thing go awry. We cannot help from kibitzing.

3668726,4,B001KQNZXM,"When it comes down to it Ghost Town is about a selfish man.  A funny selfish man, but a selfish man nonetheless.  Ricky Gervais plays Dr. Bertram Pincus (a name ripe for satire), a socially awkward misanthrope who loves being a dentist because people can't talk to him with a mouth full of cotton and tools.  A job in the morgue might work for this guy except for some squeamishness on his part.  Right from the opening scenes you understand that he's not the friendly sort as after being invited to an office party he sneaks out of the office rather than socialize with his coworkers.

After a medical ""incident"" involving a routine procedure he begins to see people no one else can and once these people realize this they won't leave him alone.  The man that hates people suddenly has a whole city of ghosts who want his ear, his worst nightmare.

The main Ghost, so to speak, is Frank (Greg Kinnear), who manages to get the other Ghosts to leave Pincus alone (not 100% sure how but he's a persuasive man, errr ghost) in exchange for keeping his widow from marrying a jerk - well he thinks the human rights attorney / medical recruiter for third world countries / good Samaritan is a jerk anyway - is he?  At any rate he thinks it's the reason he's still here as a ghost.  Dr. Pincus has a plan that just may involve himself.

Ricky Gervais carries this movie so if you have a predisposition toward him that will likely influence your enjoyment of this film.  If you've not experienced him this may be an introduction for you.  For me I couldn't get enough of his Dr. Pincus.  He plays this self centered man to a tee yet also gets across that he is a human, with feelings, and quite a wry sense of humor.  He also is a master of the incomplete thought and of socially awkward situations.  In one example he calls the woman he's trying to woo an idiot without skipping a beat in his sentence while she and the audience are astonished he's unaware he's done anything the matter.

But even while pursuing Gwen (Tea Leoni) he's in it only for himself.  And he never once tries to help any of the pleading ghosts, only Frank because there's something in it for him (getting the other Ghosts off his back).  It takes some tough love from Frank and a dentist colleague in conjunction with a hard loss to set him on a path to redemption.  Once he begins helping and not being selfish he begins to learn how to be a human again.  His realization later on as to why the ghosts are really still here is quite an emotional and unique take on the situation.

This is a comedy, yes, but it is also a drama and a well done one with feeling and emotion.  Is it a romance?  Yes, on a level it is, but it's much more a tale of redemption and this distinction makes the relationship between Pincus and Gwen all the more real.

It may be slow going for some folks, and it does take some time to ramp up, and it's not a laugh a minute riot either but this movie has balance in my eyes and has heart.  I'd recommend it.",1255392000,2,3000,4.295373665480427

I don't want to spoil the ending but suffice it to say keep some Kleenex in your pockets!

The story plot is basically Gervais is an antisocial NYC dentist who's ok in crowds, he just doesn't want to deal with the individuals in it. Due to a hospital procedure he undergoes, he can now see the dead who need someone who can see/hear them to help them finish things off with the living. Once the dead spirits realize Gervais can see them, they follow him around pestering him to help them out.

One of them is Greg Kinnear who died while married to Tea Leoni who is now on the verge of marrying a new guy who Kinnear thinks is wrong for her. He wants Gervais to help break the engagement off.

Most of the characters end up being deeper than what they seem at the start of the movie. It's what elevates this from being a somewhat banal film. Also Gervais delivers some really witty lines throughout.

3668729,4,B001KQNZXM,"Tea Leoni and Greg Kinnear are quallity actors.  David Koepp and John Kamps put together a fine script, but this was Ricky Gervais vehicle.  The man exhibited his excellent comedic rhythms in his show Extras, but one never knows how it's going to translate to the big screen.  I didn't know anyway, until I watched this movie.  He uses a hitch in his delivery that works very well.  He starts the line quickly, pauses, and then he delivers the final word as punctuation to the joke.  He begins the movie a miserable man, and he protrays misery in a subtle manner.  There are a few scenes in which he goes the extra yard to drive the point home, but for the most part it's very subtle.  This was done very well, because for the most part people don't know they're miserable until it's too late.  The character doesn't know and doesn't think he needs to be rescued.  He just wants to crawl into his little world and be left alone.  He doesn't want to venture out into the world, because he's been hurt before. Very rarely is he outwardly rude to people.  There are very few Scrooge's in life.  Most people just accidentally get trapped in routine and solitude, and Gervais portrayed this almost effortlessly.  As I said, I'm familiar with Gervais previous work, and I think he lived up to the expectations he put forth in other roles.",1253664000,2,1332,4.518828451882845

Something happened at the hospital during surgery and he returns to find his surgeon and ask her questions. But every time he speaks, she starts mumbling and it begins to annoy him. It's hard to explain the scene, so you'll have to just watch the film.

3668731,4,B001KQNZXM,"""Ghost Town"" is a warm, winning comedy due to its clever premise, generous laughs, and likable characters.  And, yes, I'm even including Ricky Gervais' grumpy dentist character on that last point, as it's quite charming to see him resist his generally cynical, non-humanitarian personality when he's around Tea Leoni's character, whom he is clearly falling for despite his irascibility.

In addition to the main storyline involving a man who can see ghosts as a result of a near-death experience, there are many funny sequences that would be at home in any strong comedy.  These include a particular standout: a scene where Ricky's character finds it impossible, despite his pointed and incisive grilling, to get his doctor and the hospital staff to clearly, unwaveringly admit that he technically died on the table for a few minutes during a routine procedure.  Maybe the scene came off as really funny because health care is on everyone's minds these days, but whatever the reason the scene worked like gangbusters.

Greg Kinnear also did his usual excellent job, crafting a character with much the same challenge as Ricky Gervais' character: having to be generally unlikable to serve the storyline but needing to be a little sympathetic, too, to help maintain the overall frothy tone of the piece.

""Ghost Town"" looks and sounds great on standard DVD, and has a variety of amusing special feaures, including a gag reel showing how often Ricky Gervais breaks up while trying to read his lines, often testing the patience of his co-stars.",1252886400,2,1539,5.063241106719367

3668733,4,B001KQNZXM,"GHOST TOWN (2008) is an odd film that showcases Ricky Gervais' stream-of-conciousness comic persona, and riffs a bit on the idea of the living being of service to the dead, as in THE SIXTH SENSE.

The trailers made it seem like much more of a fast-paced larf-fest than it actually is, and yet, and yet! The acting, by Gervais, Ta Leoni, and Greg Kinnear is all first-rate. The whole thing was shot in NY and, accordingly, there's a slew of terrific NY stage and screen thesps in it (Dana Ivey, Brian d'Arcy James, Brad Oscar, Julia Murney, Sebastian LaCause), as well as the peerless Kristen Wiig (who has an extended scene with Gervais which is a celebration of these two brilliant actors' comic timing) and the always terrific Alan Ruck. A shout out to Monte Bezell, with whom I used to work, who plays a cab driver.

Anyway, as much as the movie seems to meander after the first half-hour there's actually very little dead (ha, ha!) time in the telling of the story. There are also some heartfelt and well-earned emotional moments which made me glad I'd watched it. Odd thing is, I think it might be even better, compressed, as a musical with a younger version of Nathan Lane in the Gervais curmudgeon role.

3668743,5,B001KQNZXM,"Hollywood has put out rather a lot of ghost stories in the past few years, but this one is different. It was very appropriately advertised with a reference to the line spoken in ""The Sixth Sense"" by little Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment), ""I see dead people"" - instead they say of the central character played by Ricky Gervais ""He sees dead people - and they annoy him.""

Imagine ""The sixth sense"" remade as a comedy, with Haley Joel Osment's little boy replaced by a misanthropic dentist with the people skills of David Brent from ""The Office"" and you have ""Ghost Town"" which is at times very funny, at times quite touching, and always entertaining.

Doctor Bertram Pincus (Gervais) is an misanthropic English dentist working in New York. He likes his job because most of the people he meets cannot talk back to him when he's working on their teeth and because it's a job in which the fact that he is incredibly rude to everyone doesn't matter too much. Imagine a cross between the ""boss from hell"" characters Ricky Gervais plays as the museum director in ""Night at the Museum"" and David Brent in ""the office.""

In the first few minutes of the film most viewers will wonder whether Bertram Pincus is so rude because he hates people or because most of the people he meets are complete idiots. You rapidly realise that he really does dislike people but an awful lot - not all - of the people he meets give him reason to. A lot of the humour of the film is based on Pincus insulting people: around 50% of the time the joke is that the character actually dares to say the things which most of us would think but never dream of speaking aloud. The other half of the time Ricky gervase is seeing how outrageous he can be.

Then Dr Pincus goes into hospital for a routine operation on his colon, dies on the operating table and is brought back to life. When he recovers he can see and hear all the many ghosts who are haunting New York.

As in many ghost-story films, the premise is that dead people who stay around on earth do so because they have unfinished business. As soon as they realise that Pincus can see and hear them, he is besieged by ghosts who want him to help them take care of the various things they have left behind.

A ghost called Frank (Greg Kinnear) had been an unscrupulous but persuasive rat who cheated on his archaologist wife Gwen (Tea Leoni). He convinces himself that the business he had to complete is to stop his widow making another bad marriage, and as the human rights lawyer who is now courting her (Bill Campbell) seems too good to be true, he persuades Pincus to try to break up their romance.

To stop himself being pestered by the dead, Pincus has to abandon years of treating the living like dirt and try to act like a decent human being ...

A certain number of plot inconsistencies, but in general this is a very good, professionally made film which was great fun to watch. A lot of the jokes are very funny, Gervais is, as usual, brilliant, and the supporting cast as also excellent. Strongly recommended.",1248739200,,3040,4.464864864864865

 In this movie he plays a rather anti social dentist who has a small incident during a procedure where he is the patient which leads to him being able to communicate with ghosts, including Greg Kinnear whose still living wife is plyaed by Tea Leoni.  Gervais is splendid in his snarky misantrhope moments.

 Eventually Gervais starts becoming more human, helping ghosts and Leoni.

 The acting is very good and the script well done for this type of movie and makes a very good romantic comedy that also tugs a bit on the heart strings at the same time.

Elements of the formula that could have yielded great comedy were so compressed that they became sterile.

A scene with SNL's Kristen Wiig  was promising.  Even though I am not a fan of her style, she and Gervais playing off each other was the type of thing I expected (and wanted).  I expected Aasif Mandvi's character to flow from his ""Daily Show"" persona, but here his role was a generic one and used none of his talents (beyond basic acting).

The alternative would have been a movie that didn't attempt to have an actual story but used the genre as a vehicle for extended riffs by the comedian(s) (example, the Hope and Crosby ""Road movies"").

The film is a fun little diversion, and the first 20 minutes are a genuine riot. Gervais' disgruntled dentist is truly hilarious. His dry delivery had me cracking up. Unfortunately, once he acquires the power to speak to the dead, the film's comedy takes a backseat, and the budding romance between Gervais and Tea Leoni who plays Kinnear's widow takes center stage. Once Gervais gets shackled into the romantic plot, the comedy fountain turns into a drip here or drop there. The film's first act is truly hilarious, but soon finds itself treading the same ground covered by films like Robert Downey Jr.'s ""Heart and Souls"".

I'll stand by my opinion. This could have been shot anywhere: Vancouver, BC, London, Taos, or Lucerne. New York is not the star, New Yorkers just think it is.
It could be a TV series: Go to cities all over the world, visit ghosts, and help them find closure with people and issues they are haunted by, and at the end, the compere says ""Spook-wallah, you've found closure! You can move on!!""

3668768,5,B001KQNZXM,"""Ghost Town"" is an example of how Hollywood doesn't know how to market good movies.  I vaguely recall it's release during the September dog days of ""Bangkok Dangerous"" when people are more concerned about getting the kids off to school than visiting the multiplex.  If it lasted more than two weeks I'd be very surprised.  They don't know how to market an intelligent supernatural romance involving fortysomethings (my age bracket for better or for worse) so they treat these films halfheartedly.  The reviews I've read compare it to ""Ghost"" which I consider an unjust comparison, no offense to ""Ghost"" which is a good film.  I think a more apropo comparison would be to the vintage Hollywood comedies like ""Topper"" which had their broad elements that don't compromise wit and style.  Ricky Gervais is spot-on as the anti-social dentist who has the ability to see dead people after a seven minute visit to the afterlife during a botched surgery.  Those familiar with Gervais from the BBC's ""The Office"" and ""Extras"" may be surprised at his ability to handle the tender moments that he's called on to tackle here.  I hope somebody takes note and Hollywood doesn't relegate Gervais to the graveyard parts that his equally talented British compatriot Eddie Izzard found himself in.  Greg Kinnear is charming and smarmy as the ghost who attaches himself to Gervais.  Kinnear consistently finds roles (see the underrated ""Baby Mama"") that plays to his strengths.  Tea Leoni is almost as enigmatic as Gervais.  Leoni over the years has pursued parts that betray her obvious good looks that are challenging and sometimes not too sympathetic(see ""Spanglish"").  I can't say enough about ""Ghost Town"".  If somehow it finds it's audience it will stand the test of time.",1237680000,2,1758,5.017241379310345

3668770,2,B001KQNZXM,"Ghost Town is similar to 'Groundhog Day' in that a misanthrope must undergo a series of tests before he can be transformed into an empathetic human being. Ricky Gervais plays the misanthrope dentist, Dr. Bertram Pincus, who goes in for a routine colonoscopy and while under anesthesia for seven minutes stops breathing and ends up clinically dead (we never see any of this near-death scene while he's on the operating table and one wonders whether that scene was cut during editing). Somehow he's revived but when he walks out on the street he's suddenly able to see ghosts who are all hounding him to resolve their own unresolved conflicts with the living.

Greg Kinnear plays the recently departed Frank Herlihy who becomes Pincus's buddy of sorts and acts as an intermediary between Pincus and all the ghosts seeking his attention (it's never really explained very well how Frank convinces his fellow ghosts to stop hounding Pincus).

Frank's ex-wife, Gwen, has a new boyfriend, a human rights lawyer who Frank suspects is up to no good. He enlists Pincus to look after Gwen but he ends up falling in love with her. It turns out that Frank's suspicions about the lawyer are unfounded especially after the lawyer gives Pincus mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and saves him after he's hit by a bus.

Part of Ghost Town's problem is that Pincus remains clueless for far too long and only a heart-to-heart conversation with his Indian dentist colleague convinces him to change his ways (why the colleague is so suddenly able to work wonders with the thoroughly disagreeable Dr. Pincus where others have failed, is beyond me). Furthermore, I was expecting something a lot more clever to transform Dr. Pincus into a good guy.

After Dr. Pincus does 'see the light', in 'Groundhog Day' fashion, he does various good deeds for the all the ghosts, which releases them from the limbo world they've been living in and allows them to migrate (presumably to) heaven. Pincus's acts of kindness that help the ghosts back to heaven are all simple deeds (such as recovering a child's toy from underneath a car seat); but when he helps Frank it's something much more intangible. It seems Gwen has been 'holding on' to Frank and now must let him go. When Pincus convinces Gwen to 'move on', that's when Frank can 'move on' too.

Ghost Town can also be compared to the far superior movie, 'Ghost', starring Patrick Swayze. Whereas Ghost worked in good part because of a strong antagonist (remember how it's the hero's best friend who murders him and tries to steal his wife), here in Ghost Town, Frank is a much more muddled adversary. In fact, he's much more of a buddy to Pincus than someone who is trying to do him in.

With some more judicious editing along with making better use of the ghosts (who end up being nothing more than a group of useless buffoons), Ghost Town could have been a lot tighter and more engaging comedy than the finished product we have here.",1236988800,2,2949,4.772549019607843

Having said that, I must confess I didn't expect much from Ricky's Hollywood foray into romantic comedy and I didn't go see it at the theatre.  Well, it turns out that Ricky, again playing an initially unsympathetic character, just has comedy chops that work for me and I very much enjoyed Ghost Town.

He is ably accompanied by Greg Kinnear who is always solid, and by Tea Leoni who is not only lovely but has a nice comedic touch herself.  Well done and very amusing, I will always look for new material from Ricky Gervais, who seems to have developed the kind of perpetually funny persona as, say, John Cleese.

  ""Ghost Town"" is your typical predictable romantic comedy - but with one difference - it is actually funny. Ricky Gervais is a funnier version of Steve Carrel - Greg Kinnear always turns in believable performances in Romantic Comedies. Combined you have a movie that is somewhat similar to ""As Good As It Gets"" - maybe not quite to that level - but good none-the-less.

  Final Verdict - This is a great choice for a friday night date-movie-popcorn movie. While the first half of the movie is significantly funnier than the second I still think that most people will find ""Ghost Town"" Enjoyable.

His performance as DR. Pincus, an acerbic, anti-social dentist who wakes up from a surgery to discover that he can see (and be seen by) ghosts, is spot on. He is able to portray Dr. Pincus' particular brand of obnoxious people loathing with an affability that allows the viewer to sympathize with him. If the character was a shade less well acted, he would be insufferable.

The movie follows that now well-worn path of virtually every tale about those who can see ghosts, which might have been disastrous, except for the quick wit of the protagonist. He is able to level out some of the broader cliches that might have otherwise mired the film. The plot line might not be surprising, but it was entertaining.

On problem I had with the movie was that the romance that develops between Dr. Pincus and the wife of a ghost named Frank (Greg Kinnear) whom he has befriended, is a bit hard to relate to on several levels. First, it seems implausible that a woman (Ta Leoni) as beautiful, intelligent, and sensitive as she  would be taken with a plump, average looking man with deplorable people skills. Second, there is zero chemistry between the two actors, and it seems Director David Koepp was aware of that fact: the two essentially never touch one another throughout the entire film. For a romantic comedy, that is an anathema.

As an examination of the road to redemption for someone who has chosen to isolate themselves from rest of the human race, the movie works. As a fun if slightly superficial ghost tale, it also works. As a romance, not so much. The film is quite funny, entertaining, and if you enjoy THE OFFICE, HOUSE, ghost stories, or have a soft-spot for romantic comedies even if the romance is on the weak side, GHOST TOWN won't disappoint you.

People seem to be raving about Ricky Gervais.  Yes, in ""The Office"", he's excellent.  But, ""The Office"" is black comedy.  ""Ghost Town"" is simply not comedy.  It's little more than the usual Hollywood formula.  Everything's predictable and the supposedly funny bits are contrived and weak.

Pincus is a dentist, who detests people in general, has been hurt by love and mostly wants to go through life with as little interaction as possible. Through a medical mishap, Pincus finds that he is not only being annoyed by New York's living masses, but also by the dead who have unresolved issues. In a fairly original concept from the film, we learn why people have spontaneous sneezes (theme that is a running joke through the movie). A ghost finally convinces him to help out and a bizarre romantic comedy ensues.

Probably' ""Ghost Town"" is not a film very one will love, but it has some very funny moments, and is a well acted movie with a few bits of food for thought.

3668787,5,B001KQNZXM,"Ghost Town is one of the more charming/clever movies I've seen in awhile. Due to an unfortunate glitch during a routine colonoscopy a  crotchety, nasty dentist (Gervais) suffers from ghost harassment. One slick ghost (Kinnear) makes a deal with the dentist. If said dentist will mess up the Kinnear's widow's romance with a new man, Kinnear will keep the other ghosts at bay.

In the process lives are changed, non-lives are changed and the laughs come often. There are definitely moments that are not child appropriate. A few F-bombs, an affair, an oft mentioned male body part joke, and some double entendres/outright sexual comments make it mature viewing only.

Despite the few negatives as mentioned above, Ghost Town has a deep message and is charming and almost old-fashioned in the romance department. The colonoscopy prep and hospital check-in alone are almost worth the price of a rental. Then you have the quirk of Tea Leoni's laugh and two pretty hilarious prat falls. If you are into sarcasm, quirky romance where making a woman laugh is high on the list of romantic qualities, physical humor, ghosts or the idea of ghosts, or just fun character pieces, I recommend Ghost Town.

3668798,5,B001KQNZXM,"We really enjoyed this film and bought it as a ""keeper"". Ricky Gervais (from the British original series ""The Office"") is able to be a cynical, dark, and socially toxic character.... and yet the audience grows to love him. His character has a sharp wit and is very funny. He also reveals a great but wounded heart under the surface. It would have been easy to botch this movie and make him unlikeable..... but a clever and delicate balance has been achieved.

Tea Leoni has played some brittle and prickily characters in some past films but here her character is supremely likeable. She is a worthy foil for the Gervais character with an equally sharp and dangerous wit that for the first time manages to stop the Gervais character in his tracks. All the other supporting actors are excellent (especially the female surgeon. Check the classic scene where she and the Gervais character constantly interrupt each other.)

Greg Kinnear is always excellent and his contribution to this project could be easily underestimated. He's not the main character but he is like a catalyst..... without which the whole film would fail to fire.

Production values are excellent with terrific iconic shots of New York. There is a great atmosphere to the photography. The movie has good special effects (Ghosts) but this is kept to a minimum so the film can rely on good writing and dramatic heart rather than being effects driven.",1232755200,,1414,4.858921161825726

We watched ""Ghost Town"" unsure of what to expect. Was it a comedy? A life-affirming tale? A twist on the typical ghost story?

It's all three. And a bit more.

The premise is fairly simple. A taciturn dentist dies for a few moments while under sedation during a hospital visit, and when he wakes up discovers he can see those who have passed on. These restless souls seem to have unfinished business, and they want his help. He, however, has no wish to help. He's not a big fan of the living--which he demonstrates through some humorous early scenes--and has no inclination to be more magnanimous toward the unliving.

Greg Kinnear is the principle restless soul in the store, wanting to save his wife (Tea Leoni) from another bad marriage. As usual, Kinnear and Leoni play their parts to comedic perfection, while also introducing some touching moments. But the real revelation, at least for American viewers, is Ricky Gervais. His role as the loner dentist is played to the hilt, and as his character begins a slow transformation, he deftly handles the more touching scenes.

This movie had me laughing out loud--it was fun to see SNL's Kristin Wiig in here--and also moved me emotionally. There are some good lessons about life, and what seems like a rehashed plot is actually something all its own. To the very last line of dialogue, this is one ""Ghost Town"" I wouldn't mind revisiting.",1232755200,,1577,4.744525547445256

However, it is pleasant, well-done, periodically laugh-out-loud funny, and well-tempered. Too much cynicism, too much sweetness, too much slimeballness would have ruined it; a light touch and a skilled balance make it work perfectly. And the hospital stuff is a scream. The perfect blend of ""they-couldn't-care-less"" and ""let's avoid-a-lawsuit"" creates a number of funny scenes. Not a great film, but well worth the time and energy, even if we know ten seconds in where it's going to go. And its ""ghosts' unfinished business"" take is quite good.

3668801,5,B001KQNZXM,"The problem with the majority of modern romantic comedies is that the characters are painfully one-dimensional, the plots have as much thought and depth as a porn film, the ""comedy"" revolves around body parts and/or functions, and they always feature bland, blonde, young actors so alike as to be interchangable. Ho-hum.

Though the ""sees dead people"" premise isn't new, this movie offers some interesting twists to the usual 'ghost rules'. Ricky Gervais, an average-looking romantic lead, plays a dentist who relentlessly avoids meaningful contact with others. He may be rude and even thoughtless, but we discover he is honest and honorable, unlike the charming playboy ghost (Greg Kinnear) who pesters the recently briefly-dead Gervais to help him detach the wife he was cheating on (Tea Lenoi) from her new boyfriend. Both characters have sufficient flaws as to be initially unlikeable yet each eventually finds redemption through acts of unselfishness.

The humor ranges from laugh-out-loud to subtle and gentle (tag on the hideous new yellow shirt), which sadly some audiences seem to be unable to identify. Everything isn't thrown out at once: the pacing allows us to actually savor the interactions, failings, and growth of the characters as they learn to embrace their humanity. The only character painted in monotone is Leoni's boyfriend, an impossibly saintly do-gooder, but this is intentional and the contrast enhances the story.

There are no car chases, explosions, gruesome special effects, or sex scenes (not even the obligatory rom-com fadeout kiss). We don't even know for certain they become a couple, but we feel sure that regardless, they now have the chance to lead truly happy lives. The closest this movie comes to potty humor is the colonoscopy-gone-wrong and the mummy's naughty bits.  Refreshingly, these laughs stem from what is *not* explicitly said and shown. Other than, as noted by another reviewer, two gratutious F-words, you might be watching something from the Golden Age of Hollywood (but beautifully shot in color and with much better special effects).

If you've enjoyed any of these largely-underappreciated fine actors in their other work, you'll probably enjoy this film as well...and if you didn't know the actors, it won't matter. If you enjoy a light yet thought-provoking story that relies more on intelligent acting than flashy special effects or action sequences for entertainment, you'll probably enjoy this film.",1232236800,,2462,5.335051546391752

3668806,2,B001KQNZXM,"It seems we've seen every type of ghost film there possibly could be and that's why Ghost Town doesn't seem to be venturing into any uncharted waters. This film lacks the romantic premise of Ghost where the murdered lover returns to simultaneously tie things up with the love of his life and solve his own murder. This film is not some zombie film where the undead return to wreak havoc on the living. No, here we have those who have died with little [or big] things that are bothering them and they seek some resolve.

A sarcastic, misanthropic dentist named Bertram Pincus [British funnyman Ricky Gervais] technically died on the operating table for seven minutes and suddenly sees dead people everywhere! And they are talking to him endlessly. This is certainly not an original or funny premise. It feels like we've seen it all before somewhere though I cannot immediately put my finger on it.

A ruthless cheater Frank Herlihy [the affable, cute Greg Kinnear] was engaged to Gwen [the even more adorable and talented Tea Leoni]. Now he sees she is engaged to another and he wants that broken off and he thinks that Bertram can make it happen. Frank is determined that Gwen never marries this new guy. Why? I guess even in death he wants her to be miserable. So Frank feeds Bertram material that only Frank and Gwen would know and bing, bang, soon Gwen and Bertram are friends and hitting it off. Gwen seems motivated and open-minded while Pincus is just annoyed at everyone and everything the majority of the time.

Ghost Town moves at an excruciatingly slow pace and is as enjoyable as having a cavity filled. It is a shame because Gervais, Leoni and Kinnear should be working with much better material.",1231459200,2,1708,4.705685618729097

All he wants is for them to elave him alone so he can go about his normal miserable quiet life.

But the more and more he interacts with them, the more his heart opens, little by little. This film may bring you laughter and/or tears, as well as help awaken you to your own heart's desires.

3668809,4,B001KQNZXM,"I'm giving ""Ghost Town"" four stars, but they all belong to Ricky Gervais. The story/script isn't much above mediocre, but once Gervais appears he begins to redeem it. And since he is the main character, that amounts to a lot of redemption.

It's interesting to me that other reviewers on Amazon and elsewhere describe his character (Bertram Pincus, DDS) as an obnoxious jerk, when it was clear to me that it was the Greg Kinnear character of Frank who was ten times the jerk that Dr. Pincus was. What; we're supposed to tolerate incompetent medical professionals as well as non-stop gasbags? Also, I'm willing to go out on a limb here and suggest that it might be just a wee bit distracting to be followed around by ghosts-with-an-agenda everywhere...

But never mind - ""Ghost Town"" isn't the sort of movie where one should burden themselves with picking apart characters and plot points. I do wish, however, that Tea Leoni's paleontologist character had been a bit less neurotic and weepy. Her portrayal seemed one of a totally unstable person (emotionally), and it gave me the impression that the writer glibly views all women as being this way.

3668814,4,B001KQNZXM,"This is a good movie.  Ricky brings his style of comedy to an oversaturated genre (romantic comedy) and leaves me wanting more.  He is hilarious.

Here we have Dr. Pincus (Gervais), a dentist who is not really a people person.  He stays to himself and prefers it that way.  He undergoes a routine surgery but something goes wrong and he dies for about seven minutes, give or take.  The result of this is he now has the ability to see and interact with ghosts who have unfinished business.  One ghost is that of Frank (Kinnear) who wants Pinucs' help getting his widow's new fiance away from her.  Ultimately, and predictably, Pincus falls in love with Gwen.

Now, the first part of the movie has the kind of humor we've come to love from Ricky.  He's inappropriate, insensitive and and makes no apologies for it.  This is all good fun for a time, but where the movie really starts to take off is when he gets together with Gwen and we really see how hilarious he can be when working off the dialouge and reactions of another character.  He's almost charming with his witty banter.  Two great scenes are where he's examining the mummy and when he has dinner with Gwen and her fiance in their apartment.

There is commentary, which I haven't listened to all of it just yet, but from what I've heard it sounds pretty standard.  There is also an outtakes feature which is well worth watching.  It's pretty much all Ricky improvising, laughing hysterically and pretty much just making a mess of things.

It's a romantic comedy that, while adopting the genre's basic structure, also tinkers with the conventions and remains truly unpredictable until the end.

Ricky Gervais, who stars as Bertram Pincus, is subtly hilarious and heartbreaking at once, giving a truly memorable performance as an introverted and petty dentist.  While the rest of the cast--especially Kristen Wiig, who is better than any and all of her SNL costars--offer competent performance, the heart of the film is really Gervais.  He has such a hypnotic screen presence.  I'd rather watch him than any of Hollywood's golden boys.

3668821,5,B001KQNZXM,"Ricky Gervais is perfect for a role such as the one he has in Ghost Town, that of an anti-social individual so full of his own issues that he doesn't notice others around him, except at the times that he's irritated with them.  He plays a straight man (in the comedic sense) so well that it allows others to make jokes of him or around him that keep the audience laughing without ever realizing that the humor is all his.

Ghost Town also features, of course, a town full of ghosts, not the least is which is the character played by Greg Kinnear.  An adulterer that seems to have unfinished business with his widow that he needs the help of Gervais' Dr. Pincus to help resolve.

Thanks to what some would call a near death experience while having a routine medical procedure done Dr. Pincus sees dead people (ghosts) all around him.  Even though Dr. Pincus would like nothing more than to continue to live his lonely existence, getting the ghosts to leave him alone might not be possible if he doesn't cooperate a little.

T&eacute;a Leoni plays Kinnear's widow and soon inspires Dr. Pincus to reach out and open himself up, but not, of course, without comedic results.

Ghost Town includes wonderful writing and top shelf acting from everyone involved.  In the sparce extras on the Blu-ray version there's a gag reel that shows some of the fun that the cast had making the film.  There's also a featurette that shows a little of how the effects were done for the film.

The Picture quality is good on the Blu-ray, though much of the film takes place indoors so we don't get the benefits of panoramic or majestic background scenery to take in and awe inspire us.

Well worth viewing, even if many elements of the film date back to other films and TV shows.  If not for the relatively small package of extras, it would rate a solid ""buy it"" from me, but in it's current version I'll leave it as landing in the middle of ""buy it"" or ""rent it"" depending on how much you like the films stars.",1230336000,5,1988,4.461325966850829
3668822,5,B001KQNZXM,"I have never been a fan of Ricky Gevais, but I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed his performance in this movie.  I especially loved the "" dinner at the apartment"" scene with Tea Leoni.  I could watch that over and over--he is sooo funny!  Delightful little movie that doesn't make you think too much. I am buying this on Blu Ray the day it comes out, and will now seek out all other Ricky Gervais works...",1230336000,2,418,4.265822784810126
3668823,2,B001KQNZXM,"Now I have to admit something first, I hate Ricky Gervais. There's no other comedian in the world that I think could be more overrated than Gervais, so with that I tried to stay away from this film as long as I could. Unfortunately I got dragged into watching it yesterday and I must say it's simply annoying and typical of my opinion of Gervais' previous work. I guess in a way one of the prime reasons for me hating this film, is that Gervais seems to play himself throughout. I may be on my own here but I just don't see what other people see in Gervais and his work. He's just not funny to me and in my opinion he predictably fell flat in this film.

Ghost Town sees dental surgeon Dr. Bertram Pincus going into hospital for a colonoscopy only to find out that he was dead for 7 minutes in the theatre during the procedure. As a result of this he can now see and communicate with the Ghost inhabitants of New York. Enter Greg Kinnears character Frank Helihy who pesters him into breaking up the impending marriage of his widow Gwen (Tea Leoni). What leads is a rom com with quite an annoyingly predictable reasult.

I suppose a good reviewer would look for the good points of this movie and focus on them as a way of advertising the thing. I guess one good point would be the small role of Indian comedian Aasif Mandvi as Dr. Pincus dentist colleague. I'm a big fan of Mandvi's and I was quite pleasantly surprised to see him appear basically out of nowhere.

I would honestly not recommend this film to anyone, Gervais is as terrible and annoying as always and I just found the film insufferable.",1230249600,6,1601,4.3478260869565215
3668824,4,B001KQNZXM,"A bittersweet romantic comedy with a semi-new view of ghosts - what if it's us who are keeping them here, instead of them having unfinished business here? Tea Leoni is very effective in her role of a wife that's been cheated on by her husband (the ever-underappreciated Greg Kinnear) and she finds out about his dalliances a few minutes before he dies. Ricky Gervais is simply fantastic as an obnoxious dentist who doesn't hate crowds, ""just the individuals in them"" and discovers that he can help people whether they are living or dead.",1230163200,3,537,4.78494623655914

3668826,4,B001KQNZXM,"A fun romantic comedy that manged to pull off a good high definition transfer. The story is familiar with cantankerous ghosts, witty comedy, NY in the winter while falling in love, etc., but the cast/crew pull off a fun play on words and feelings with (as the director mentions several times in the commentary & BD docus) a believable open ending. This is a re-watchable film that I think most guys will dig; The majority of the screen time contains the dialogue/schtick of Kinnear & Gervais but the ladies will obviously love the whole romcom thing.

For not being a high-budgeted FX film, the CG looked very presentable and did not show any real artifact on the BD. The docus are the same as on the DVD. The main docu has plenty of info on the making of the film, the Ghostly Effects is a short, uneventful clip on how they interlaced the CG, but it does provide one surprise on a scene that did not appear to be CG. The highlight though, especially for Gervais fans is the Some People Can Do It feature, which is actually the outtakes and bloopers - hilarious.

The colors were outstanding on the BD for having so many interior shots, and some of the NY exteriors looked outstanding in HD. Obviously not a thorough sound or visual test for your display, but worth the purchase for multiple viewings.",1229644800,7,1302,4.536170212765957

8315853,5,B001KQNZXM,I really like this movie and try to watch it once a year.  It is fairly close to the truth about ghosts and helping them to pass on to the other side by helping the living left behind with closure.  It is a funny and inspirational movie.,1522108800,,237,4.0212765957446805

8315855,5,B001KQNZXM,"This movie takes a look at death from a different perspective and lends humor to a topic that is usually sad. It delivers both humor and a few profound moments about how grief is part of the human experience. If you believe in limited after death experiences, such as nothing happens and/or that souls go straight to heaven/hell, then this might not be the movie for you, as the story focuses on what happens to souls in the in-between and how the main character helps them get to the afterlife.",1520812800,,495,4.511111111111111
