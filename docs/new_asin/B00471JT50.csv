4273406,2,B00471JT50,"I just caught the Lifetime Original Movie 12 Men Of Christmas on Lifetime. I usually don't watch Lifetime, but I was feeling gay today and I wanted to watch a Christmas movie. However, watching 12 Men Of Christmas was a mistake on my part. For a movie with Christmas in the title, it's not very Christmassy. Only about twenty minutes of the movie takes place at Christmas time. The rest of the movie takes place at other times of the year, such as New Years.

Kristin Chenoweth stars as a perky blonde, so she must be playing herself. She wants 12 men to pose nekkid for some Christmas calender. And I must point out that most of the men are better looking than I and in better shape, which really bummed me out. But that's another story. Chenoweth and one of the calender boys fall in love, even though they previously couldn't stand each other. And there's your movie.

It also must be pointed out that 12 Men Of Christmas is supposed to be a romantic comedy, but I only laughed about five times. Actually, they were more like one second giggles than laughs. For a better Christmas movie, check out Silent Night, Deadly Night, Bikini Bloodbath Christmas, or Jack Frost 2: Revenge Of The Mutant Killer Snowman.",1290902400,8,1211,4.5504587155963305

4273409,5,B00471JT50,"I had this recorded on my DVR and it was my go-to movie, all year round! Predictable love story, but it doesn't matter when the hero is Josh Hopkins!

Kristin Chenoweth is adorable, the men are hot and although it's a predictable love story, I really think it's good and entertaining!",1285891200,5,395,4.171052631578948
4273411,5,B00471JT50,"Just found out that this awesome holiday movie is coming out on DVD.  From the novel, Decent Exposure by Phillipa Ashley, which is an excellent read, I am thrilled.  Entertaining is Kristen Chenoweth as EJ and the hot Josh Hopkins as Will.  A feel good love story with the beautiful back drop of the mountains of Montana and plenty of good looking men.  Also hoping that a calendar will be next.  For me, I can and did record this on my DVR, watch this over and over again.",1284336000,12,473,4.329545454545454

4273556,4,B00471JT50,"The threadbare plot has a desperate E.J. Baxter (Kristin Chenoweth) looking for work after she is fired from her job when she catches her boss with her fianc.  Her ex-boss quickly makes certain no one in New York will hire her.  So E.J. heads west for a job with the Chamber of Commerce in Kalispell, Montana.  (The writers manage to make Easterners and Westerners look like saps, neither understanding the other.)  E.J. gets the bright idea of resurrecting that overused ploy of a beefcake calendar to help the local Search & Rescue team earn money for a helicopter.  She immediately comes up against an obstructionist malcontent (Josh Hopkins as Will Abrecht) who manages to quash the plan.  When he isn't skinny-dipping in someone elses swimming pool, Will is plying his brand of sarcasm all over town.  Neither likes the other so of course they make the best candidates for a romance.  They trade insults, barbs, and harsh looks.  Nothing says I love you like calling someone bossy, rude, and arrogant!",1450310400,3,1006,4.870588235294117

Boy chasing girl , girl doesn't want to have anything to do with Boy & (the middle part is a lot like Pride & Prejudice) Until Boy kisses Girl & that's not all she wrote! Some nice looking Guys in there too. And it shows the beauty of Montana sceney & the great outdoor sports you can do. I actually give it 4 1/2 stars.

4273562,1,B00471JT50,"I hated to give this one star. I bought the movie simply because I love Christmas Movies and I've always thought Kristin Chenoweth. We watched it once and can't make ourselves watch it again. As some of the one ""one-star"" reviewers said, it's silly, stupid, there isn't a decent plot and we just didn't care what happened after a while. If women are looking to see men in a ""manly - half naked"" movie, maybe they think it's worth watching it. Believe me, they're not that great. The feisty ""had it all"" woman being sent to this backwoods place is unbelievable and totally boring. It doesn't take long to figure out what is going to happen. I'm not even sure it should be put in a Christmas collection. I was very disappointed in Kristin Chenoweth and the movie totally. It gets donated to charity.",1447804800,,797,4.541666666666667

Now black balled in New York she travels to Montana where she is to work with the travel bureau to bring in new business and promote the local town she is in.  In a idea to raise money for the local search-and-rescue team she wants to put out a hunky man calendar.  It took me awhile to get use to the childlike voice of the diminutive Chenoweth but once I did she did fine.  Again as with some Lifetime movies I tend to question their male lead castings.  While they always do a adequate job, I always think that I would cast one of the other males in the cast in the lead role.  But its their movie.

4273658,4,B00471JT50,"12 Men of Christmas is a romantic comedy television film made for the Lifetime Television network. It is based on the novel Decent Exposure by Phillipa Ashley about a publicist and life-long New Yorker that loses her both her fiance and her job on the night of her holiday work party and then decides to retreat to Montana.

The story is about E.J. Baxter,who is a headstrong and popular New York City publicist. She seemingly has the ""perfect life"": a beautiful condo, a loving fiance, a great job, and an excellent boss. But E.J.'s world takes a turn for the worst when she catches her fiance Noah having an affair with her boss Lillah at the office Christmas party. Resulting in E.J. breaking off her engagement with Noah.

Now, having no one to spend Christmas or New Years with E.J. starts to look for a new job, though with Lillah account black balling her all over the city, E.J. has no one else to turn to except her sister Roz. Feeling sympathy for her, Roz pushes E.J. to take up a job offer in Kalispell, Montana to lure corporate retreats for a year.

Upon arriving, E.J. is extremely disappointed to find that her ""job"" is working at a travel agency bureau with no secretaries or office, except her cheerful co-worker Jan Lucas. Will she go back to New York after this activity or will she find happiness in Montana and stay there forever?

The performance of Chenoweth uplifts this film from a predictable, unoriginal and clichd Christmas love story. She makes it interesting and highly entertaining. The other actors/actresses in the TV movie were decent though.

As for the story of the movie,the concept of having a Christmas calender was pretty funny for it had some good moments. Also,the character development of E.J. was a good presentation. But unfortunately,the other supporting characters served nothing but only decorations in the background. But nevertheless,12 Men of Christmas is still a guilty pleasure for a viewer if high expectations aren't being required for satisfactory viewing.",1416873600,,2013,4.874269005847953

I kept wishing they had cast someone else as the male lead, because there just wasn't any chemistry between them--plus, she's so tiny and he's so tall that it was odd seeing them together!

She's an entertainment juggernaut standing at 4'11"". She's awfully cute.

Baxter is one of them obnoxious New Yorkers who has no right to be as likable as she is, except she's being played by Chenoweth who's at her chirrupy best. E.J. Baxter is a high-end, take-no-prisoners public relations executive, and she's just landed a lucrative account for her firm. So why then would she simultaneously quit her job and her fianc?

You'll find out why soon enough if you tune in. But E.J. turns the page and hightails it out of New York and into Montana, to a little town there called Kalispell (pop: 19,000). The mayor of Kalispell has offered her a one year contract to establish a pilot program to lure corporate retreats there. So there's E.J. in her Prada and her Gucci, scouting the wide open stretches of land that abut Kalispell - and by ""scouting"" it's meant that she drives around a lot and gets lost every time. Also, E.J. is not cool with the nearest Starbuck's being ten miles away. She misses the hustle and bustle of the Big Apple.

All that stuff is just to provide splashes of color to the narrative, of course. The meat of the plot concerns E.J.'s finding out about and championing the local search and rescue squad. The S&R squad is struggling to support itself, having barely eked out before on the strength of modest fundraisers like bake sales, raffles, and triathlons. If only there were someone with big city media savvy who can put her skills to good use to raise money, right?

So it's another fish-out-of-water tale, except Chenoweth keeps it from going stale. We get the requisite big city prejudices from our central character warring with her innate decency. We get the rural folks who're so welcoming, E.J. remarks, ""You're all so friendly here. Do you all know each other or are you members of the same cult?"" Shame, E.J. (but I laughed and may've even snickered). There's that smug character, Will Albrecht (Josh Hopkins), and Will and E.J. seem to have taken an instant dislike to each other. So we know where that's going. And don't be surprised if you catch a whiff of Pride & Prejudice. See if you can make those connections. Gregarious Jan Lucas (Anna Chlumsky) - she's E.J.'s personal assistant in Kalispell - sort of fits the part of Jane Bennet, am I right? Yeah, I'm right.",1387065600,,3202,5.0

It was also enjoyable watching how the main character transitioned from city life to Montana. At the end of the movie, she certainly fit in.  The theme was well done, not overdone, nothing risque or awkward. A pleasure to watch as the holidays approach, but would be entertaining at any time of the year.",1384819200,,402,4.661971830985915

The movie doesn't really have a Christmas theme. It is not what I would call specifically a Christmas movie and is appropriate for any time of year - it just concludes in the search for Mr. December.  The plot is making a fundraiser calendar to expose the beauty of a small Montana area to advertise tourism .",1366156800,,440,4.432098765432099

4273775,3,B00471JT50,"I expected differences from the book, since the book was set in the UK, and this movie was in the western United States, but I sort of expected something of the same character development and situational similarity. Although there were a lot of similarities, and I was able to fill in with my imagination, there did not seem to be the same magnetism between the characters that I expected. There was also sort of a snobbishness from the main character that the heroine in the book definitely did not have. I did not like that at all. The movie overall was not unlikable, but I was just disappointed that it did not live up to the story the writer of the book told.",1362009600,6,664,4.40650406504065

It actually had a unique plot, which is hard to find in Christmas movies since there are so many of them. Kristen Chenoweth's voice can get old after a while, but I tried to ignore that. I watched this movie three times this Christmas and lent it out to a friend who also liked it.",1358208000,,361,3.958904109589041

The scenery is beautiful. The storyline is predictable. I don't think they were going for cinematic greatness though. It's just a story about a woman who figures out what's important in life. Also, who doesn't love seeing Vada (Anna Chlumsky) back in the movies!? The movie is based on the book Mr. December which is also a fun read.",1357257600,,494,4.823529411764706

I was pleasantly surprised to revisit Darcy and Elizabeth in this lighter Christmas movie. While it won't take any literary prizes, it is a cute retelling of my favorite classic of all time. The similarities are evident in the relationships of several of the characters--clearly the best friend has the same Bingley adoration and respect for his friend and won't pursue a love relationship with the heroine's friend as a result of well-meant but wrong advice from him. The delicious verbal sparring is also Darcy-esque. And of course there is the bad boy who seems sterling but lacks morals, preying upon women--especially rich ones.

I purchased it off of a recommendation from a friend. I was a little unsure about it to start with but I actually found myself enjoying it. I like out the main female character still has her spunk about her even after she has to start over someplace new. Kristin Chenoweth does a wonderful job as the lead female character. I found her character to be very funny in certain parts of the movie. She did well subtly putting humor in things her character did through out the movie.,1351728000,,620,4.262711864406779

The characters were average people in not so average situations and it was fun to watch a city girl interact with country folk without her being kept at a distance.

I don't know what it is about her voice, but Kristin Chenoweth has the highest, squeekiest voice, that I don't find bothersome.  She just sounds cute and sweet.  Loved her in ""Pushing Daisies"" and she brought that same zaniness to this movie.

The story is crazy, but I found it super-fun to watch.  I didn't like what happened in her personal life to make her next stop Montana, as I get tired of the man-fools-around-on-fiance-and-gets-caught movies that seem to abound.  Since the movie doesn't take off until she reaches Montana, that is over quickly and the fun starts.

Every woman (and I am targeting women here, as most men won't watch 12 undressed men) will probably go for this film and be very happy with it.  Since I collect Christmas movies, this HAD to be a part of my collection, or I would have been very unhappy.  Watch it... and enjoy.",1304294400,4,1024,4.481081081081081

I didn't get more than 10 minutes into it before realizing that the valley girl high school squad must have made it up for a school project...

8417648,5,B00471JT50,"Kristen Chenoworth is an extremely talented lady and in this delightful Christmas movie, she plays a warm and vulnerable lady who gets hurt by her fiance. She moves from New York City to Montana where the people are less sophisticated but very real. This contrasts against the phony sharks who surrounded her in New York City. The town in which she works needs to come up with funds to buy a new helicopter with which to save people. They hired her to drum up publicity to bring tourists and money into the town. When she saw the poor bake sales and fundraisers they held, she came up with the idea of a calendar that featured the hunky men who lived there. This movie is delightful and warm-hearted. I strongly recommend it.",1517616000,,725,4.541984732824427

8417652,3,B00471JT50,"I remember loving this movie when it first came out almost a decade ago, and I hadn't seen it since until I bought it in 2017. I have to say, while anything with Kristin Chenoweth has potential, the romance is juvenile and underdeveloped and most of the movie doesn't even take place at Christmas (for a supposed Christmas movie, that's odd).

Not to sound uptight, but it also shocked and disturbed me that the love interest showed KC's character his manly parts in an exhibitionist way when they didn't even know each other (she walks in on him skinny dipping -- when she's working, no less -- and he just confidently struts out of the pool and stands there facing here in all his naked glory like he's trying to turn her on). Like, what?! I don't care if they end up falling in love, I'm pretty sure she legally could have pressed charges against him for indecent exposure. I guess we're supposed to believe that's what gave her the inspiration for the calendar, but sheesh. They could have just had her see him shirtless or make it a genuine accident that she saw him full-frontal, instead of reinforcing the idea that chicks who don't even know you are all dying to see your package and will eventually fall in love with you if you oblige.

As for their ensuing romance, it follows the typical ""Act like they hate each other and then all of the sudden out of nowhere they're in love"" trope. Way too underdeveloped. Not to mention, KC's character is a bit of a brat.",1514505600,,1470,4.481343283582089
