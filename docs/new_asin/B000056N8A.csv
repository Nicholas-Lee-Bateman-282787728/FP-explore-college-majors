1398589,5,B000056N8A,"This is a heart felt movie I would watch over and over. Alffre Woodard never fails to deliver.
if your a fan of Alfre Woodard this is a movie you won't want to miss.
she's an A class actress. what ever the part what ever the storyline you can always count on her
to take the movie beyond expectation.",1409097600,,300,4.101694915254237
1398590,5,B000056N8A,I recently decided to replace my some of my remaining VHS Tapes with DVDs.  I did not replace all of them only the ones I truly enjoyed watching and this was one of them.,1218672000,8,170,4.0
1398591,4,B000056N8A,Alfre Woodard and Helen Shaver are terrific actresses and it's great to see them together.,1123632000,3,90,5.066666666666666
1398592,4,B000056N8A,"Any movie with Alfre Woodard is worth watching.  This Showtime
movie starts out rather slow perhaps because it wants to show
the laidback South.  Woodard stars as a lawyer who returns home
to attend her mother's funeral.  This event changes her life
forever.  Blair Underwood is very good as ""The Magic Man"".
Good family entertainment and it is nice to see that people in
the South can be decent to one another.",1023840000,12,411,4.666666666666667

7932374,5,B000056N8A,"A very good story. This is a great family movie. It makes you examine your feelings about people who are different, and weither or not you are quick to jump to conclusions before hearing all of the facts. I have recommended to a friend.",1438128000,,236,4.386363636363637

7932378,4,B000056N8A,I love Alfre Woodard and she played her usual intense and transforming role.  This was a good story passed down from her mother the story teller.  I think this would be a good movie for the kids because it teaches you how to accept people for whom they are.  Good movie.,1428278400,,270,4.254901960784314
