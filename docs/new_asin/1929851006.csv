7801321,4,1929851006,"This was an interesting video showcasing ideas on how to strategise and approach certain situations in which obtaining the truth is the desired.
There is an audience comprising 6 individuals from both sexes. they act as the teaching device while you join in as part of the group.
various scenarios adapted from everyday life are presented to the group and precepts for obtaining the true blue picture out of these situations are put forward by professor Lieberman.
questions and concerns are then raised by the individuals in the group as each method or concept for detecting (a/the) lie is introduced.
Personally, I thought about reading the paperback version of (""Never be lied to Again"") first, but the idea of watching a video that showed in real time how to pick up on the various clues being given off by
a liar : -(whether it be their body language, choice of words , or their off the cuff knee-jerk reactions to your lie-detection stratagem),was much more appealing.
It was more real to me than just a bunch of phrases or statements describing what signals to look out for.
I benefitted a lot more from watching a typical conversation -(where one individual was telling a lie) unfold ; then, trying to listen out for what my instincts were telling me about the percentage of truth in the persons response ,then obtaining a review from the Prof. as to the various signals or signs the liar actually gave off which i may or may not have picked up on sub-consciously, but should know better to look out for and notice the next time round.
In short, this video speaks to those who could use some good suggestions as to ways of getting past the beguiling lies people might present to you over any subject-of-interest, to the candid truth of the matter .
Divining the truth in any matter is a useful social skill to acquire and I found the hour spent watching this video profitable.

I found out how to tell when he was lying and after 11 months, decided to leave him.  I couldn't have done it without this video.  It really helped me and I highly recommend it to anyone who suspects that someone is pulling the wool over their eyes.",1023062400,,408,4.1265822784810124
