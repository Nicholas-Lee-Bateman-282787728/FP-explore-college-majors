8705883,2,B00UGPRWUA,"This film focuses on the life of a soldier over a 40-year periodhis exploits, friendships, and romances. Filmed during WWII, this film is viewed by some as a classic. Its a comedy/drama/romance/war movie with an why-we-fight theme, but I could not get into this movie. The comedy in this British film falls flat in most cases with only a few chuckles. There is no straight narrative since the plot flashbacks to different time periods in the life of the main character. A positive is that it is beautifully filmed in Technicolor, and Deborah Kerr is engaging in the three roles she plays. In the opinion of a casual viewer, though, I feel I wasted  nearly three hours of my life. [It's a long film.]",1500768000,,699,4.637096774193548
8705884,5,B00UGPRWUA,"A young military officer, ""Spud"" Wilson (James McKechnie), in the ecstasy of a mock war confronts an old officer Clive Candy (Roger Liveseys) who appears to be set in his way and unaware of today's (1943) attitude toward war. The young officer ridicules the older officer's ways and looks without giving a thought as to why or how the older officer became that way.

The explanation is through a flashback that Candy explains the apparent differences and that one day you may also find yourself ridiculed. In the process we see how some decisions stay with us for life.

Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger are well known for movies that have a mythical deep meaning like ""I Know Where I'm Going!"" (1945.) In one film ""One of Our Aircraft is Missing"" (1942) the deleted scene of a confrontation between a younger and older officered was deleted. This scene was the seed for this movie ""The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp"" (1943.)

At first the film does not seem to have quite the stature of the earlier Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger films but as the personalities evolve and the story unfolds you see that they still maintain the magic.

Two performances I find of special interest are those of Anton Walbrook as Theo Kretschmar-Schuldorff (the Uhlan officer) as he goes through attitude changes in life, and that of Deborah Kerr who plays the three women (Edith Hunter/Barbara Wynne/Johnny Cannon) in the life of Clive Candy.

Last note be sure to get the restored Criterion presentation of this Janis film.",1497484800,,1520,4.8307692307692305
