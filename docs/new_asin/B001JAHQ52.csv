I am still upset that it got cancelled in the middle of the eight season, but I will still continue to purchase the seasons to complete my collection.  I own seasons 1-6 and I can't wait to purchase this season as well!!!!",1252368000,,252,4.122448979591836
3657035,5,B001JAHQ52,"[[ASIN:B001JAHQ52 Girlfriends: The Complete Seventh Season
THIS WAS ONE OF THE BEST TELEVISION SHOWS ON TV ABOUT FOUR WOMEN HELPING EACH OTHER FIND THEIR WAY AND BECOMING EMPOWERED INDIVIDUALLY WHILE ON THAT MISSION.  i AM DETERMINED TO GET ALL THE SEASONS!!!!
I HAVE ONLY ONE PROBLEM WITH ONE SEASON I ORDERED FROMM AMAZON- THE SENT ME SEVERAL SCRATCHED COPIES,  ENDED UP EATING THE COST AND PURCHASING THE SET ELSEWHERE SO BE SURE TO CHECK DVDS AS SOON AS YOU GET THEM.",1251244800,,471,4.802469135802469
3657036,5,B001JAHQ52,"Girlfriends - The Complete Seventh Season is a great season even though one girlfriend is missing. Toni was muchly missed, she left the show at the end of season 6 (still not sure why). Tracee Ellis Ross is my favorite actress, her character Joan is so neurotic, obsessive, and delightful. I wish this show would have gotten a proper good-bye, Season 8 was never treated with respect. Season 7 does not disappoint, reserve your copy today!",1249603200,,439,4.7894736842105265
3657037,5,B001JAHQ52,"I lived in Houston for eight years and hated it. I always dreamed of moving to Los Angeles, and did not miss a show because it helped me envision myself there. That show has got me through some things, inspired me about my move, comforted me, and I am finally here. That sitcom, with all its warm characters, mellow music, lots of laughter, sometimes tears, and serious, in-depth topics is the best I have ever watched. A male version would be nice =)  Guyfriends...
When driving on the Pasadena 110 at night, I look up to the lights and the building(s) where Joan's employer lawfirm 'Swedelson' is in and I think to myself, hey gals, I am here =)
The characters are the kind many can wish to have as friends, and I hope the sitcom continues someday. Many, many thanks to such wonderful cast and the production crew: Thank you, Kelsey Grammer, Tracy Ellis Ross, Golden Brooks, Persia White, Reggie Hayes, Jill Marie Jones, and Keesha Sharp. You have truly touched me!!! Hope to meet you someday.",1248652800,8,995,4.589887640449438
3657038,4,B001JAHQ52,"Not since the 90s sitcom ""Living Single"" have I been so drawn into the interesting, yet dramatic lives of African-American women. Mara Brock Akil did a great job in showcasing the diverse, funny & challenging lives of Joan, Lynn, Maya & Toni. Yet anyone who is a huge fan of the show knows the seventh season suffered a little with the absence of Jill Marie Jones' character, Toni. William Dent's love, Monica Brooks (Keesha Sharp, who was debuted in the role in Season 3) tries very hard to fill the void Toni's character left, as in this season, the three remaining girlfriends, Joan, Lynn & Maya learn more about her. I'm very disappointed Viacom/CBS hasn't invested a little more time producing behind the scenes extras for the DVDs of Seasons 4, 5 & 6. Even though the show is off the air, (and now Akil's newer show has suffered the ax from the CW, ""The Game"") I believe fans of ""Girlfriends"" would still like to see small clips of the cast either rehearsing lines, location shoots or the cast gearing up for one of the many fabulous guest stars on the show. (The last well-produced full DVD of this show with wonderful extras was Season three, breaking down Toni's wedding.) If there is an eighth season DVD release for this show, please Viacom/CBS - finish up the season, even if you only have the actors talking about the experience on working such a great show. Take the time with the actors and produce something! PLEASE!!!",1248048000,6,1434,4.627450980392157
3657039,5,B001JAHQ52,"I start with Season one and watch every season through Season Seven, and start all over again.  I never get tired of Girlfriends.  It's a crying shame such a good show went off the air.",1245715200,2,185,4.257142857142857
3657040,5,B001JAHQ52,"Man oh Man.. I've been waiting and still waiting for this season... I have seasons One thru Six and waiting to complete it! I hope they give us a complete season on disc for Season Eight and not leave us hanging the way they did and canceled the show~~~~~~~~~~~~ SOOOO Disappointed with that~~~

But this show is the best and I also watch my dvds over and over again~~~",1244937600,3,369,4.3478260869565215
3657041,5,B001JAHQ52,"I love this show, and I am so excited that the seventh season is on its way to Amazon.com for me to purchase. I already own seasons 1-6 and I have watched them over and over.

3657094,5,B001JAHQ52,"Season 7 of ""Girlfriends"" was the first season that featured only three members of the crew after the departure of Toni Childs-Garrett (Jill Marie Jones). Joan ( Tracee Ellis-Ross,) Lynn (Persia White,) and Maya (Golden Brooks) were still trying to navigate thru jobs, relationships and life in general with some often funny results. Their best guy friend William (Reggie Hayes) was still on board with his lovable goofiness. Toni was indeed missed, but the season was still fun to watch.",1405728000,2,488,5.1125
3657095,5,B001JAHQ52,"This show was of the best during it's time and would be excellent today. Why is it that we always lose the good stuff? The show was real, it was clean, down to earth and easy to relate to. The women had so much class. I can just watch them over and over; as though I am watching them for the first time and expecting a differ outcome; so many meaningful lessons about true friendship; they never get old.",1401926400,,404,4.1265822784810124
3657096,5,B001JAHQ52,"I tried to scoop up all of the seasons of Girlfriends because it was one of my favorite sitcoms that embodied sisterly love,support,breakups and forgiveness. These DVDs a just a token of a gone but not forgotten remembrance of a show that many have enjoyed, and can continue to with a new generation of women.",1400976000,,309,4.636363636363637

3657100,2,B001JAHQ52,"when i received the season disks were not secure and when i watched the season some of the episodes would not even be viewable, I will have to buy the season again just to be able to watch it in its entirety",1381017600,,207,3.9523809523809526

3657113,4,B001JAHQ52,This was a great season.  I watched the episodes over and over.  The quality was fine.  Thanks for mailing what I paid for.,1363219200,,123,4.260869565217392
3657114,4,B001JAHQ52,"I really felt the loss of the Toni Childs character this season.  And although the cast is still incredible, the chemistry was a bit off as they forced the Monica (Keesha Sharpe) character into that missing ""girlfriend"" spot.

Joan meets a new guy while volunteering in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina; Lynn tries to get her music career off the ground by singing @ a karaoke bar; William & Monica marry and separate almost immediately afterwards.  (Off screen Toni refuses to talk to or see Joan.)

The only story line I really enjoyed was Maya, Darnell & Jabari moving to the 'burbs and their experiences.  I also loved seeing more of Darnell as he pursued his dream of working on a NASCAR pit crew only to quit and try to buy back his garage.

As far as features we get Mara Brock Akil (show runner) speaking briefly about a few episodes. I'm glad I finally got to add this season to my collection - GIRLFRIENDS is one of those shows that doesn't lose its replay value. I can watch it over & over and still enjoy it.",1347062400,,1023,4.44385026737968
3657115,5,B001JAHQ52,"Ok im a guy who fell in love with this show. i was mad when Tony left and how people said she made the show, ""O HELL NO!"" but you have to give my favorite character Maya her props i absolutely loved her. "" O HELL YES!"" LMAO!",1342742400,,224,3.6875
3657116,5,B001JAHQ52,"If you are a fan of the show, you must purchase all seasons. I was never a fan of Tony but her prescence was missed when she left the show. However I really did like this season, absolutely loved the episode when Joan got engaged. That episode was done so well I loved it!",1338940800,,272,4.055555555555555

3657120,5,B001JAHQ52,"I must say that for christmas I got the entire season of GF!! I have already watched 1-3 and I'm just loving watching it again. I watched the show when it was on air and I loved these characters. I too hated that Jill Marie (Toni) left the show and all throughout I hoped that they would manage to somehow bring her back end. I didn't re4ally like that Monica chick and she didn't even come close to making another girlfriend (in my opinion), I think it was how she was brought into the show. I'm so excited that BET has decided to bring back THE GAME I can't wait for Jan 11. So ecxited!!!",1293753600,,590,4.139130434782609

Yes, the 7th season was a bit lackluster because Toni left and the story line weakened a bit. I really hope that there can be a movie that comes out of it like Sex in the City. i kinda see my self as a Joan Clayton lol :-) Power to the black people!!!",1255996800,,413,4.111111111111111
3657150,5,B001JAHQ52,I am 25 years old and such a girlfriends fan. I love this show and everyone in my family and even my 5 year old son Jayden knows it. He can actually name the characters lol. Amazon always notifies me when every season is being released on dvd and I would pre-ordered them. I found out that itunes was selling season 7 and 8 for my itouch ipod so I defintely bought it but now I'm putting in a order for season 7 because I want to have the whole collection. Thats another thing about me...I like collecting dvds. On the weekends I chill and turn on a dvd on my 52 inch tv in the living room. I have a lot of dvds.

One of the best & funniest sitcoms ever.  Not just best BLACK sitcom, but best, period.  No need for that ever-present label.  Btw, I've gotten the last 4 seasons or so at deepdiscountdvd.  It's cheaper, free shipping like Amazon, AND most of the time it arrives on the day of the release or before, if u can believe that.  Personal experience.  I don't work for them or anything lol.  Super free shipping thru Amazon is great, but last time I ordered a season, they didn't ship it til 3 days after it was out!!  Not knocking Amazon, but I'd definitely wanna know that info if I was a buyer!!  Can't wait for the release of Season7!!!!
