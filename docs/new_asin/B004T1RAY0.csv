This is an analytic 2 DVD set that explores the celebrated OK Computer album plus a career history up to the year in question. The set travels from the early days through the calendar as Radiohead make the journey from British band to global gods. These sonic scientists are still one of the most noted bands in the world and this is an interesting trip capturing the intensity and invention of an act that never take the easy route to song creation.
This is a must for new fans while also retaining the attention of the die hard disciples. This is an OK DVD!",1457049600,,596,4.351351351351352

This is just a repackaged version with a new cover. If you don't have either of those you aren't really missing much anyway as the people interviewed aren't as knowledgeable about Radiohead as any ardent fan is. Which is to say if you are a fan of the band then you already know everything that these supposed experts talk about in the DVDs. Not to mention that some of them have some questionable opinions about ""what Radiohead meant when they wrote this song"". And there are some downright inaccuracies as well. For example, there is one guy that goes on and on about the line in Paranoid Android ""Ambition makes you look very ugly"" When the actual line is ""Ambition makes you look pretty ugly"". That might seem like a minor misquote to some but the guy uses that line to expound that Thom Yorke was putting forth the idea that Ambition is ugly. However, ""pretty ugly"" can be viewed as a paradoxical juxtoposition therefore steering clear of making any such grand pronouncements. And I think even the most casual fan would surmise that Thom Yorke isn't the type of person to make grand pronoucements in his lyrics. If anything his lyrics are quite the opposite.

Also in case you don't have the 2 previous DVDs mentioned or if you have them and you forgot..""The Story So Far"" is a highly deceptive subtitle since this only covers up to 2003 at best and very shabbily at that. In short, I would only recommend this to people who know next to nothing about Radiohead because that sure seems to be what the people interviewed in these DVDs know.",1310169600,8,2036,5.7194719471947195
