8479823,4,B005MUAQ84,This DVD is perfect if you need something playing in the background for your Halloween party. We are also planning on using it while trick-or-treaters come to the door. It's a great way to get into the Halloween spirit. Fun sound effects to create an eerie mood.,1319760000,,262,4.595744680851064
8479824,1,B005MUAQ84,"Very disappointing!  It's just a glorified animated screensaver.  The 120 minutes of animated scenes with eerie music & sound effects actually consists of only a few minutes that is repeated over & over & over until you get to 120 minutes/2 hours.  This is okay as a glancing backdrop for a party...if you have a giant-screen TV/monitor or if you want to project it on a large viewing screen.  I don't have such luxury items, tho.  Other than that, it will do as just another Halloween decoration, which is how I will use it.  I'm going to put my old TV on the front porch & throw some creepy cloth over it, add a few other decorations & play the DVD for Trick-or-Treaters that may come to the door.  Could this DVD had been better?  Yes!  Some of the animation goes by too fast to enjoy.  More things could have been done with the existing animation to make the video a lot more fun & exciting to watch.  I would go into detail on how it could have been better, but I think I'll save my ideas for my graphic artist nephew & have him make a better Halloween video for me to use next year.",1319587200,,1088,4.233009708737864
8479825,5,B005MUAQ84,This is going to be so much fun on Halloween. I love the spooky music and the cool graphics. I plan on using it this weekend when I carve pumpkins with my daughter.,1319500800,,164,4.0
8479826,5,B005MUAQ84,"This video will be perfect to play in the Halloween section of my retail store. It is subtle enough that it isn't too overwhelming, but spooky enough to get everyone into Halloween spirits.",1319155200,2,189,4.757575757575758
8479827,5,B005MUAQ84,"Haven't ever seen anything quite like this before - we watched this tonight and even my 5 and 2 year old sat still long enough to watch!  The 5-year-old got a bit scared about 4 minutes in.... but it's supposed to be a bit scary, right?  Think this would be perfect to have on during a Halloween party and we are planning to have it on during trick or treating because the soundtrack is great too... kids will wonder what's going on inside our house -- BOO!",1318896000,3,457,4.241379310344827
8479828,5,B005MUAQ84,I just got mine this morning and I love it! I will be using this at my Halloween party. It has great high-quality background graphics and music.,1318809600,3,144,4.37037037037037
