8226453,4,B000X1GZPU,"The Treatment(2006), loosely based on part of Daniel Menaker's 1998 novel of the same name, is a light-hearted film about a psychoanalytic treatment of sorts. Viewers who are familiar with the novel will recall that it is somewhat disjointed. The director, Oren Rudavsky, has crafted a better story from the part of the novel that focused on the treatment itself. Jake Singer (played by Chris Eigeman ) teaches English lit at a prestigious private boys' school in Manhattan. We learn quickly that his love life is a shambles and that his career is in only a little better condition. Fortunately, he is in analysis with Dr. Ernesto Morales (played by Ian Holm (Bilbo Baggins of the LoTR trilogy). Dr. Morales is an eccentric (to put it mildly) Agentinian Roman Catholic (as evidenced by the crucifix on the wall beside his chair). More than a little annoyingly, Dr. Morales proclaims himself ""the last of the great freudians.""
Mr. Singer, it soon becomes evident, is a bright, earnest, anxious young man whose obsessionality imposes profound limits on the scope of his life. The film offers no positive model for psychoanalytic technique, but it cleverly portrays the common experience of having one's analyst ever-present in one's own internal life. For those who have not read the novel, I will omit any account of the plot that concerns Mr. Singer's life outside the analytic situation except to say that Famke Janssen (whom some may recall from Taken and Taken 2) plays the role of Allegra Marshall, his primary love interest, with extraordinary grace.
Rudavsky directed and wrote (along with Daniel Saul Housman) the screenplay adapted from Menaker's novel. The film suffers from writing that is too facile and stays out of the deep end of the pool where psychoanalysis and love are concerned. Even so, I feel The Treatment is a delightful film and I recommend it.",1370822400,,1868,4.9712460063897765
