It originally appeared in 2002 on cable television. I have respect for anybody who can and can bother to take a little bitty story that far. Even more obscure is the novelist and film maker Sevi Regis. I was at her movie at a small movie house along the LIRR, say 9 y/ago. Some have said the obscurantists of the outer boroughs will have their revenge on the Williamsburg/Greenpoint set.  We all knew each other more or less...so that's a moot point. Personally, I'd like to see an ""installation"" of PUBLIC ENEMY out there however it's done these days. 2-bad their latest GOD PLANS MAN LAUGHS will be largely played for it's entertainment value without pause for thought.

7965037,5,B000068TP4,"O.K., so the only other movie I have reviewed was 4.5 years ago, and it was an ""Oswald the Octopus"" movie for toddlers, so bear with me. I purchased this movie several years ago after being totally entranced by it several years before that on the ""Sundance Channel"". With all due respect to the negative reviewer, I am glad that Eleanor Hutchins does not have a bubbly Barbie voice. She comes across as real, both as an individual and and as a mom. I will also state here that movies without explosions and UFC moves will seem to drag to the average male. I do not even agree with the description on the back cover of the DVD- I didn't feel that Zelda was trying to hang on to her Iggy Pop days; I felt that she didn't want to get lost in motherhood in general and was trying to embrace her identity by doing artwork, salvaging a relationship with her lover, and hanging out with other moms who are in the same situation as her (ie.needing an alcoholic beverage to regroup). I do not think that Zelda's going to an underground art show while dad watches the rugrat makes her an immature, irresponsible mom. I do not want to give away too much about the movie...I feel that other characters (the ones with addictions that present dangerous situations with small children around) want to keep Zelda constant while motherhood has clearly made her a different person in some respects. Being responsible for a child is breathtaking. I would like to note that the ""bohemian"" tag should be amended to ""bohemian-punk"", just to give the setting and characters a more accurate feel.",1293926400,4,1572,4.578014184397163
7965038,1,B000068TP4,"This movie dragged and was cliche although they tried real hard to make it ""edgy"" and gritty. The lead actress' voice was whiny and grating, she seems like an uptown suburban chick working hard to play a poor working class mother. Sorry I couldn't suspend disbelief to believe any of this crap.",1278547200,,294,4.673076923076923
