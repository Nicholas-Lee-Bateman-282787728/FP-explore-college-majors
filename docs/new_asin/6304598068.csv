7876327,5,6304598068,"If i could, i'd give this movie a billion stars in rating... it is really that good. This is by far the best TRUE TO LIFE GANG MOVIE I've ever seen... I've seen alot of them too, (Dead Homiez, Slob 187/Crab 187, Bullets Don't have No Names, to name a few, plus more).... but this one is by far the best of the best. It's a documentary about Gang life, and how gangsta's live, etc... everything you can imagine, is in this movie... I highly reccommend it for any law major, or parents who may want to scare their kids straight and sway them away from joining a gang... There are members of the Bloods and the Crips in here, White Fences, Aryan Brother Nation (ABN), BGF (Black Guerilla Family), Surenos, Nortenos, Latino gangs, VL's. There are street gangs in this movie as well as prison gangs... you see members both in and outside the prison bars. you see a few that are on house arrest. They go to a few prisons in here, and even show some of the cells, and solitary confinement cells, and their living conditions... This tape is EXTREMELY RARE AND HARD TO FIND!!! This is why whereever you look, it's always more [...] this is a vhs that is OUT OF PRINT, and is EXTREMELY HARD TO GET!! I highly reccommend it though. Even if you are a collector, this is the one to have.",1107388800,3,1274,4.3125
