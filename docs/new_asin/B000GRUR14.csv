2616141,4,B000GRUR14,"You are a traveling singer driving on a two-lane road alone somewhere in lonely countryside. Your car breaks down. You're lost in the woods and the night is closing in. This Belgian film asks you: ""What is the worst that could happen?"" You can find the answer in `Calvaire,' but its answer is not what you see in Hollywood horror films.

The worst happens to a young and handsome chansons singer Marc Stevens (Laurent Lucas). After his car's breakdown, he walks to the nearest village, guided by a young man he encountered on the way. The boy says he is searching his dog, but he behaves a little strange. Is he afraid of something?

After arriving at the village, an old man named Bartel (Jackie Berroyer) kindly lets Marc stay at his house. Believing that he can continue his travel, Marc thanks him for his kind offer, and accepts it. But Bartel seems to have his own plan. In fact, the old man thinks that he knows about Marc, or someone named Gloria, and it turns out that Marc has to stay there much longer than he expected.

[BIZARRE] It is certain, as the story unfolds, that there is something wrong with the people there, I mean, all the people in this film except Marc. The film is filled with this creepy mood from the beginning, even before his getting lost in woods. In the first scene Marc's karaoke gig ends with two elderly females eagerly staring at him, and one of them gives him a collection of disturbing Polaroid photos. Marc may be called an objct of desire, but he is the last person to know that.

`Calvaire' has another title `The Ordeal' which many be a more appropriate one for Marc, who must endure so much. I should not reveal the film's story here. That's because I know doing so would be pointless, but still I can tell you that you don't see a blood-stained chainsaw or a masked killer. What you see instead is the world of insanity, an isolated community where insanity slowly creeps in a stealthy way toward Marc.

Why do these Belgian country boys act like that? (There is one quite original dancing scene in which the villagers dance to the unnerving sound of pounding piano like zombies.) What is the reason behind the enmity between them and the old Bartel? Answers are suggested, but not completely given.

Belgian director Fabrice Du Welz's `Calvaire' is a film that defies our easy categorization. It is a horror, but shocks come very slowly; violence is also there (though graphic descriptions are avoided), but the film has some dark humor. It most definitely reminds us of countless films in the past, horror or otherwise, but the film is hardly an imitation of them. It also has underlying religious tone, but it is hard to pinpoint the exact meaning of it.

Whatever the film is, the film's photography capturing the bleak rural landscape is something you should not miss (by a cinematographer Benot Debie, known for Gaspar No's more depressing `Irrversible'). It is breathtakingly beautiful and sinister-looking at the same time, something that you seldom see.

If you want to see something original, strange, or bizarre; if you think you have seen everything, try this one. `Calvaire' is a film you either love or hate. Some images still remain in my mind as well as the crying of a pig that is still haunting.",1158969600,6,3259,4.645833333333333

Watching this movie the second time I even appreciated more. It is dark in humor and the first time you watch this movie you may be shocked. Whether if it is a horror or not, hmm, I don't know if you can categorize true art. What is really scary is that we don't have more movies like this in theaters because we are somewhat brainwashed into 'good vs evil' movies where good always wins and the lead character hardly breaks a sweat or a cry.

Seriously. Gotta love the French and their little twists on things. One thing I've noticed: in a few French films (in the horror genre, of course) they sure do love throwing a person in the midst of insanity and then having someone tie them to a chair and cut their hair off. It's kinda awesome. Go French! haha. But truly... the movie was... well, see for yourself!!",1288915200,,379,4.573529411764706

The two wind up at an inn, where we meet Bartel. Odd things begin happening, slowly building to a bizarre and insane final act. CALVAIRE is a 70s throwback film w/ some fun nods to the director's main influences. Yes, there are some sick moments in this one (blessedly brief and shown from afar). Yes, there are many surreal moments, especially the ""penguin dance"" at the tavern! Still, CALVAIRE is mostly a quiet story w/ a few shocking interruptions, reminding me a bit of THE LAST GREAT WILDERNESS, at least in quirkiness and atmosphere. I enjoyed it...",1283644800,,712,4.5271317829457365
2616196,1,B000GRUR14,"Unfortunately, my first review is for a Belgian horror flick called Calvaire (or The Ordeal).  I say 'unfortunately' because it was quite a letdown.  I might feel this way because of all the hype I read about it, seeing that it was compared to modern horror classics like Inside and Martyrs, as well as horror staples like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Deliverance.  After viewing the film, it definitely draws comparisons to the latter, but of much less quality.

Released in 2005, this movie is about an entertainer in Belgium who is traveling south for a Christmas Gala.  He gets himself lost in the backwoods of Belgium and his old van shockingly breaks down in the pouring rain.  Luckily there is an old Inn (say 'an old Inn' five times fast) nearby which some crazy kid takes him to by foot.  Long story short, the owner of the Inn is not who he seems and the singer is in trouble.  Needless to say, he doesn't make the Gala.  Whereas many movies have had similar plots and succeeded (See Frontier(s), or TCM), this movie fails in so many ways.  Those of you looking for a high body count, look elsewhere.  Those of you looking for scares or a clever script, look elsewhere.  Those of you looking for lots of blood and thrills.... you guessed it, not here.  Lets put it this way, there is more gore in Not Another Teen Movie.

The only positive things I can say about this movie are that it has a cool poster and it doesn't waste too much of your time with an 88 minute runtime.  Other than that, there really isn't much going on.  It's just a slow building movie that never pans out the way I had hoped.  If given the option of seeing this, I would say skip it.  There are much better horror movies out there that need to be seen.  Even though we are in a time where there are so many horrible Hollywood horror movies being made, this proves that not every foreign horror movie hits its mark either.

Nothing - NOTHING - happens for the first 50 minutes (and it's a bad sign when you're checking your DVD timer in a horror movie) and what finally does take place is about as arresting as an episode of MASH.  This is as non-scary as the worst '80s slasher movies.

***WARNING: Spoilers follow***

The initial set up is pretty good.  But it all goes down hill (from a horror movie standpoint) when the entire town is revealed to be raving lunatics during the bar scene.  The movie became about being weird for the sake of being weird and lost any footing in reality.  Yes, I know, men can do crazy and horrific things as a group. The Nazis come to mind.  But this film did not succeed in selling the reality of a group gone mad.  That several men would all psychotically believe a  bloodied man, in a dress, to be their same lost female lover is ridiculous.  The dance sequence IS hilarious though. I'm going to learn that step!",1248220800,,910,4.625
2616200,4,B000GRUR14,"Incredibly well-filmed, well-acted, near-perfectly-pitched film. Aside from a regrettable ""homage"" to THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE (in which a wonderfully-controlled performance takes a disppointing, cliche'ed turn)and a poorly-executed death scene near the end, this had me mesmerised and often on the edge of my seat. Great atmosphere of tension and unanswered questions. The implausible ""landscape"" is effective and fits the story. The vague morality is SO well done and serves the film perfectly. If only the director could've restrained his ""these films influenced me"" excesses, I'd have given this 5 stars. Not for everyone, by all means, but, if you like an intelligently disturbing film that leaves JUST ENOUGH answered questions, this is one to take a chance on.",1248048000,2,770,5.533898305084746
2616201,3,B000GRUR14,"And an ordeal it certainly is . Calvaire is not just about the horror of all that can go wrong on a person's worst day - and when nowhere near civilization, it is about the staggering desolation and spiritual destitution of being broken by a psychopath with no hope of getting help from the outside world and at the same time being physically disabled by your tormentor . The scene with Marc, Boris and Bartel at the Kitchen table - shot with a 360 degree panorama that induces vertigo - is a psychoscopic peak into the madness that surrounds Marc and is close to ensconcing him completely, if only he can escape . Calvaire, not for the weak or easily intimidated but like all good horror movies from France & Belgium is definetly worth seeing .",1235606400,,745,4.485294117647059
2616222,4,B000GRUR14,"Im talking pig squeal creepy weird. It's always nice to see that foreigners have their own type of hillbillies, eh?

Marc Stevens sings at old peoples homes. Hes driving to an audition which might be his big break when, o snap, his car breaks down. The hotel owner, Bartel, has not had many visitors since something or the other happened. (We are honestly just as confused as Marc is during this movie about the WHYs and WHATs). Next thing you know Bartel is putting Marc into a dress and starts referring to him as Gloria.  And then things get weird.

My favorite scenes: Marc has been confused and crying for awhile. In one last show of frustration and courage, he proclaims, I AM NOT GLORIA; I AM MARC STEVENS. To no avail, of course. Seeing the desperation and frustration of Marc's psychology at that time really touched me.
Also, forget about the bestiality - one of the creepier parts of the movie is when we see Bartel spooning Marc. Im cringing just typing it.
Another great moment from this movie was Marc interacting with one of the bad townspeople while he was in the forest (towards the end; I just don't want to spoil it for anyone!).

This movie is not everyone's cup of tea.  You might think its too slow, too graphic, not graphic enough, no plot, not good, not cohesive and the list goes on.  Anyways, Youtube the bar dance scene. Im sure this movie receives everything from 1 to 5 stars. It took me a good nights rest to realize I really liked Calvaire.",1232668800,,1471,4.49063670411985
2616223,1,B000GRUR14,"Wow, where do I start.  I stumbled upon Calvaire with Netflix, after it recommended the film to me (usually a good sign).  Then, I read reviews and the synopsis, all of which seemed to suggest it was like the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  Finally, knowing it was a foreign horror film, I decided to give it a go since I am usually not burned with foreign horror films.

Calvaire is about a musical performer named Marc Stevens who is apparently quite the stud and is hit upon by an old woman and a young woman.  He must have some animal magnetism that attracts anyone and everyone to him, which becomes problematic when he runs afoul of a town of sex-starved men, it seems.  But I'm getting way ahead of myself.  Marc leaves (much to the chagrin of his two forlorn wannabe lovers) to do another performance in another town.  While en route, his car breaks down but he learns of an inn nearby.  Luckily, the inn keeper can get his car fixed, but his interest in Marc seems to turn towards the infatuation side of things.

Long story short, Marc is seen as the inn keeper's former wife, he gets tied to a chair and the rest of the movie documents his passive cries as he endures all sorts of torture.  But that makes it sound more thrilling than it actually is.  Some people have called the film ""disturbing,"" a term that I believe gets bandied about way too much.  And while I did sit through the film with my eyebrow arched more often than not, it was more because I couldn't believe I was actually sitting through the film and seeing what I was seeing.

Marc turns from a normal, mentally strong person to a whimpering (and poorly acted) man in a dress in a matter of minutes.  From there on, my suspension of disbelief fled the scene, probably to elope with any semblance of a plot.  Further arching my brow (could it get any higher on my forehead, I wondered?) was a sequence in which the village people (no, not the band, but the crazy town folk), who are all male, it seems, all simultaneously stand up and dance with each other.  Well, if you can call it dancing; they instead step from one foot to the other while staring intently and deeply into each other's eyes.  What the heck am I watching?

Misinterpreted love is a common theme in horror movies and when it works, it's superb.  But Calvaire wholey stretched my believability to the point that I had to see the whole thing, just hoping it'd get better.  Hint: It doesn't.  I love horror movies.  I love the so-called disturbing and psychological films, as well.  Calvaire is a psychological study, for sure.  A study on how long it takes to turn off your DVD player.

I apparently failed.",1228176000,11,2656,4.45850622406639
2616224,2,B000GRUR14,"I gotta admit, I'm completely flummoxed by some of the great reviews for this film.  Derivative and unintentionally funny--just watch the bar scene in which the local men dance like drunken, sex-starved penguins and you'll know what I mean--this movie was a chore to sit through.  Similar to another reviewer, I couldn't believe how pathetic the ""hero"" becomes when he is captured.  And what's with all the men thinking this guy's a woman?  He might not be macho, but he sure doesn't look like a ""Gloria"" to me.  Nice atmospheric touches, a squealing pig, and a cute calf couldn't save this ""homage"" to '70s horror films for me.  The Goodwill store can expect my donated copy soon.",1226707200,4,681,4.777777777777778
2616225,2,B000GRUR14,"This film pulls its punches at every opportunity.

The violence is off screen. The terror is implied; the gore minimal, the horror non-existent. Tension is sought only through the use of a long and boring introduction: It's almost 50 minutes before anything happens. I assume this is supposed to offset the mundane against ""The Ordeal"" to come. It doesn't.

The characters are one dimensional. The hero is a whining wimp who has plenty of opportunity to escape. The psycho hotelier is never anything but warm and friendly. And he remains amiable and quite likeable for the duration. There is nothing frightening about him at all. There is no subtle change from good guy to bad. There is no glimmer of the psychopath, no sign of suppressed rage: nothing freaky whatsoever. Apparently this is what the director wanted, some kind of sympathetic psychopath, but it just makes the rest of what happens in the film more confusing, ridiculous and stupid. The villagers are almost an afterthought, remembered only for their dancing.

And the much vaunted surrealism is just misplaced and evokes only derision in the viewer not intrigue.

The plot is thin, with enough holes to confuse even a casual observer. The acting, although adequate is let down by some poor prop & continuity work. Our hero is knocked unconscious by the innkeeper swinging a car battery at him; difficult to believe at best. Ropes are too loosely tied, muddy fields become snow covered become muddy fields again. That the deluded innkeeper believes the male cabaret artist to be his long lost wife is acceptable; that the village leader also shares the delusion is laughable.
In fact, only the bleakly shot countryside comes out of this with any dignity. And even then, you'll be thinking 'nice holiday destination' rather than 'Oo scary.'

I'm harsh on this film because it had the potential to be something very special. It could have done for rural France/Belgium what Deliverance and Southern Comfort did for the backwoods of the Deep South. It could have been a Misery or Psycho. Unfortunately it's a sloppily handled lame joke of a film. Indeed, Tartan could find themselves on the wrong side of a lawsuit for this release: Terror? Any character from The League of Gentleman has more scare potential than what's on show here.",1225152000,3,2296,4.937823834196891

Marc takes one wrong turn due to weather conditions, experiences vehicle problems and seeks refuge at a rather abandoned inn.  Bartel, the inn keeper, offers his assistance and eventually tries to befriend our young performer.  Bartel rolls out the red carpet:  aiding in repairing Marc's vehicle, preparing his meals and providing entertainment.  However, as the ""friendship"" grows so do the twisted desires of Bartel.

We felt the movie was very well done.  The actors all did a nice job; especially the actor who played Bartel.  His character was both likable and creepy at the same time.  The movie is more of a psychological horror and it is not packed with action, multiple murders or gore; however, there are some rather torturous things that take place. A nice job is done with keeping with the mood of the movie.  Dread and doom are prevalent throughout the movie and the rarely lets up.",1221350400,2,958,4.8580246913580245
2616227,3,B000GRUR14,"I did enjoy this film, found two scenes absolutely brilliant (the dance scene, and the overhead shot of the mayhem going on the cottage near the end), and was left haunted by the ending (which is ambiguous but - SPOILER ALERT!!!!! - I think it's implied that Marc is wandering the woods insane).

However, I found two important plot points to be completely unbelievable and in fact extremely irritating.  They are:

(A) A car battery is heavy.  If a weak, old man is standing in front of you trying to lift a car battery high enough to hit you in the head with it, you can EASILY avoid it.  This is precisely why the actual battery-to-head contact is not shown on-camera.  Because it would look ridiculous.

(B) Marc is shown to be a normal human being.  Why does he IMMEDIATELY revert to a simpering, powerless child the second he is hit with a car battery and tied up?  All he does the rest of the movie is lie around passively and cry!  I'm not saying it doesn't HURT to get hit in the head by a car battery, and perhaps what I'm missing is that maybe the injury scrambled his brain so much that he can't think clearly enough to fight back against his oppresser.  But man - to see him go from normal man to impotent crybaby that quickly was a bit unexpected.

Still, if you are interested in cinematic depictions of deranged minds, you must see Calvaire.  Every single person in the film is deranged!",1215043200,3,1403,4.412451361867705
2616228,5,B000GRUR14,"This is not a movie for gore-hounds; in fact, the camera shies away from most of the violence.  Instead, this film resonates in more creepy and psychological ways.  There are scenes that will stay with you and they are not graphically violent but deeply violent all the same.  The extremely disturbing dancing scene of the villagers and the pig squeals still haunt me.

As already noted, it is a tale about all the things that can go wrong once you leave your own protected environment.  There is a reason why the backwoods are so scary (shades of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deliverance/dp/6305558159/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deliverance</a>, French style).  This movie is scary and the characters are among the creepiest.  Bartel, the inn keeper, and the villagers are a freak show!  Certain scenes were hard to watch.  The cinematography was breathtaking and eerie all at once.  Other scenes are left to the viewers imagination which can make things all the more chilling.

As a viewer, I was dying to know about the back drop of this story and the extras on this dvd did not help me.  Obviously, there are no females in this remote village.  How did this come to pass?  Were the men a little off to begin with? or were they driven to this primal state by the lack of women?  This factor is what drives The Ordeal of Marc Stevens.  Why would Bartel have stayed with his wife in this village in the first place? It becomes clearer when Bartel confides that the villagers were not like him and Mr. Stevens.  While this warns Mr. Stevens away from the villagers it also, we later discover, makes a very fine distinction between degrees of crazy.  Very interesting movie.

Some believe this movie is about zombies but I would disagree. I think it's really a movie arguing the natural state of man.  To paraphrase the great French philosopher Rousseau, the progression of the sciences and arts caused the corruption of virtue and morality in society.  The consequences of this Village following  Rousseau's ""Social Contract"" which recommended the return to nature and the whole ""Naturalism"" movement are horrific.  The religious overtones (the whole nailing to the cross bit and following baser instincts leads to bad things) and shades of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lord-of-the-Flies/dp/0307281701/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lord of the Flies</a>&nbsp;(what is the basic nature of man?) and plenty of other references all add up to a fascinating film not to be missed. Definitely a film to own rather then rent.",1203552000,,2607,5.320293398533007
2616229,2,B000GRUR14,"It's a hard life being a singer I'm told. In the film ""Calvaire"" we find out how difficult it truly can be. Marc Stevens (Laurent Lucas) is a singer who is working weddings and retirement homes. Things don't seem to be going too well for Marc as eighty year old women as well as their attendants decide to throw themselves at him. Unfortunately things get much worse for young Marc. On the way to his next gig, Marc's car breaks down in an out of the way hamlet, and he is forced to stay at an inn run by the lonely Bartel (Jackie Berroyer). Bartel takes a liking to the boy and decides that Marc will stick around whether he likes it or not.  The worst part for Marc is that Bartel isn't even the worst citizen in town. What follows is a crash course in depravity for the singer.

""Calvaire"" is not a movie that breaks boundaries. The comparison to movies such as ""Deliverance"", ""Misery"", and ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" are fairly easy to make. Like the aforementioned films, ""Calvaire"" is a disturbing movie about kidnapping, violence, rape, and bestiality.  What makes this movie different from others of its genre is the strong performance of Jackie Berroyer as Bartel. As the film progresses, the audience sees Bartel transform from a friendly but lonely inn keeper to a psychotic who misses his wife just a little too much.  Unfortunately, Berroyer's fine performance is not enough.  The appearance of the town's even less savory customers takes the film into a predictable and unfulfilling end.

Despite some problems with the story, and the fact that the movie was obviously shot on a limited budget, ""Calvaire"" does not suffer technically.  Belgian director Fabri Du Welz did a good job utilizing the materials at hand and shot a thoroughly disturbing movie.

""Calvaire"" is another example of the current trend of horror movies that go out of their way to shock people.  Jackie Berroyer's performance does help to differentiate ""Calvaire"" from its peers, but ultimately it is not enough to make it a compelling film.",1199145600,,2024,4.776504297994269
2616230,2,B000GRUR14,"This movie is disturbing and unpleasant. Give it that. Okay maybe the word 'disturbing' evokes an undeniable visceral response. This might not have gotten to you, but there's no denying that it is unpleasant. Nasty.

I did not like the movie. At all. Except for the guys dancing in the bar, that scene (starting with the piano) was good enough for a Miike movie.

And this doesn't compare to Haute Tension.

1. They have nothing in common except violence.
2. Haute Tension actually had some action/movement.
3. A girl masturbating is not an equivalent cinematic experience as pig raping.
4. Haute Tension was superb (aside from some stringent issues I have with the way that the last scene was shot).

2616231,4,B000GRUR14,"Calvaire (Fabrice du Welz, 2004)

France hasn't made a good horror film in decades, if ever; thus, I'm not sure why I was interested in Calvaire when I first heard about it, but something in me resolved that I'd give it a shot. I'm glad I did, for Calvaire, while not exactly your basic horror film, is very, very good at what it does.

It's the story of Marc Stevens (Dans ma Peau's Laurent Lucas), a washed-up singer who's reduced to taking his lounge-lizard act (which I swear is modeled on the final episode of Are You Being Served?) to old-age homes. (The opening sequence has a great cameo with seventies softcore superstar Brigitte Lahaie, if that sort of thing interests you.) On his way between two gigs, his van breaks down, and he is led by a mentally challenged young man named Boris (Jean-Luc Couchard) to an inn owned by one M. Bartel (Jackie Berroyer). Bartel promises to fix Stevens' van right up and get him on his way, but Stevens can't shake the idea that there's something just plain weird about the whole setup...

As a horror movie, it's pretty bland. I'll say that right up front. There's very little gore, there are no jump moments, there's not even all that much atmosphere. Things happen, we see them, that's it. As a surreal comedy, on the other hand, it's absolutely brilliant. (If you have any doubt that this movie is intended as a comedy, it will be quashed when you see the dance in the bar.) It is not, however, a laugh-out-loud kind of comedy; it's the kind of thing that you snicker behind you hand at, then immediately feel guilty for doing so. Du Welz (and it's very hard for me to believe this is his first feature film) keeps things just slightly off-kilter at all times, veering wildly every now and then to keep the viewer nauseated at all times (in a metaphysical sense; we're not talking about Noe's camerawork in Irreversible here). It gets to the point where you just can't believe that someone thought this stuff up. And while I saw the big twist/punchline coming a mile off, it's one of those ""I can't believe he'll really go there"" moments whose predictability doesn't diminish the pleasurable shock of it one jot (like the immortal final scene of Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer).

I know I'm in the minority on this, but I loved Calvaire, and recommend it without hesitation. Just don't go in expecting something like Wolf Creek, and you'll be fine. ****",1189987200,,2407,4.590697674418605
2616271,3,B000GRUR14,"This movie was interesting in a number of ways. The plot is borrowed from a number of sources, as mentioned in other reviews. What I found to be good in this film was the acting, sets and music.
The acting is top notch from all sources here. What I found interesting was that the only two female characters were in the very beginning. The rest of the movie was strictly male characters, with references made to a 'Gloria'.
The sets/location were superb to the story. Dark woods, winter, rainy... all lend itself well to a stark, barren landscape which is perfect for the sense of being trapped that the main character endures.
Very littel trick photography, which works well. And very little music to speak of. Scenes that were tense were left without background music which added to the cold, starkness of the plot.
What I didn't like is that the plot borrows, strongly, from other sources. It does lack originality in that sense. All in all, I would say it is definitely worth a watch if you like creepy, edgy films. Not so sure I would say it's a keeper.",1189728000,2,1057,4.539267015706806

2616273,2,B000GRUR14,"It seems as though many of today's French film makers aim to shock and disturb in hopes that it ultimately translates into a horrifying experience for the viewer. Calvaire (The Ordeal) is proof however that you can't always create something strange and label it as ""horror.""

Too many of the film's variables--most of which are not original--do not make much sense within the whole. What the viewer is left with isn't necessarily shock, but an uneasy feeling about how it all fits together.

Take for instance the scene at the tavern where the villagers shun and dismiss Bartel, the inn keeper, as a lunatic. After he leaves however, they all dance to some melancholic tune as though they themselves are the lunatics...the viewer sees that later in the film, they're even crazier than Bartel was.

Calvaire suffers from poor lighting during the most integral scenes. One could argue that it adds to the overall atmosphere of the film, but only if you enjoy not knowing what is happening.

All in all, Calvaire/The Ordeal is an odd film and is disappointing.",1184803200,2,1057,4.855555555555555
2616274,3,B000GRUR14,"Marc Stevens is a small-time entertainer with big-time delusions.  He is singing at an old-age home as the film opens. Attractive, but no great beauty, he has virtually no personality.  Even so, everyone in the film seems to fancy him.  One old lady comes on to Marc in a surprisingly direct manner after his show.  Then the director shamelessly throws herself at him, thoughtfully including erotic pictures of herself in his pay packet.  Alas, he is impervious to their respective charms.

Marc's van breaks down ""in the middle of nowhere"" which is  a stretch of the imagination as he is in Belgium, not Appalachia.  He has issues, to be sure -- like a ""low-key"" disposition verging on depression --  but everyone else in the film is downright loony.  The inn-keeper, where Marc is the only guest, is ""crazy""  about him.  Get in line, buddy!  The older man seems amiable enough at first, but soon reveals a darker side.  Among his more conventional designs on the hapless boy are a very bad haircut and a dress.

Aside from the two ladies at the home, there isn't another female in sight.  Just a bar full of inbred cretins whose fitful dancing suggests Night of the Living Dead and the Monster Mash. And guess what?!  They all want a shot at Marc, who they call Gloria (the town slut who infuriated everyone by running off at the first opportunity).  The only guy not drooling over Marc/Gloria has a significant other of sorts: a pig on a leash which figured prominently in an earlier love scene.

The dialogue dwindles down, after the first twenty minutes, to a lot of squealing from the pig, whimpering and crying from the adults. The non-linguistic din may be intended as a subtle hint that these simpletons are like animals, but to make that comparison is a categorical insult to critters everywhere.

After his ordeal, one might reasonably wonder if Marc could possibly return to singing his insipid songs at the old-age home again.  But, on the other hand, after his backwoods ordeal he might well want to give the two predatory old gals another look.",1183939200,2,2059,4.711484593837535
2616275,4,B000GRUR14,"Don't get me wrong, this movie is fantastic, but it needed some eerie music to set the tone and drive the suspense in a lot of the scenes.

If you like movies like Hostel and Turistas, you'll dig this movie, but even though the main character Marc Stevens (a travelling musician) has a lot of terrible things done to him throughout the movie, it doesn't really seem all that scary except for two or three really well-shot scenes.

It needed more of a sense of urgency, you didn't feel like Marc was really in THAT much danger, and the crucifixion scene needed to be done longer and more elaborately. The subtitles are no big deal because there are long parts throughout the flim with no dialougue.

All in all, i am happy to have this movie in my collection.  I know i pointed out a lot of bad things about the Ordeal, but it's still a must see if you're into this genre.",1183507200,,871,4.325153374233129
2616276,5,B000GRUR14,"This is a really interesting film.  Fabrice du Welz has taken a rather familiar horror movie scenario and twisted it around with dazzlingly different results.  He pursues the logic of the plot developments to a really memorable and, for me, devastatingly numbing and beautiful ending. I don't recommend this for sensitive souls who can't stomach cinematic depictions of brutality or distress (you know who you are) and I don't recommend this for people who like to watch brutality but who don't want to think about it (you know who you are).  Don't watch and fixate on the probability or likelihood of certain of the events happening; this movie is not meant to be a realistic rendering of the behavior of sensible people.  The strength of the narrative is following through in a dreamlike or poetic way on the philosophical underpinnings of a strange but undeniable dynamic of desire: how value winds up getting displaced from object to object irrationally through a network of wanting lustful subjects, and how damaging that transfer can be for those involved, both the desirer and the desired.  I believe this is du Welz's first film: pretty darn impressive.",1169337600,2,1161,4.994818652849741

2616278,4,B000GRUR14,"Seems like we've seen it all already - Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Deliverance, Wrong Turn and Wolf Creek... So any new movie based on these peripetias has to offer something new not to look boring and secondary. Surely modern directors saw the same movies we all saw and they know as well of a horror tradition and of what they should do or shouldn't considering their projects. And here hides all the charm of Fabrice Du Welz's ""The Ordeal"" originally named ""Calvaire"". It seems that Du Welz consciously decided not to take into consideration previous horror-movies' experience, he took it as a tabula rasa to create something new as if there were nothing created before, pretending he's a kind of a pioneer. And surprisingly he succeeded.

""The Ordeal"" turned out to be rather quiet and modest film and maybe that's where its fascination comes from. It appears you can make one truly disturbing picture without crushed skulls and sawed off limbs. On celluloid Du Welz created his little, personal hell, which sometimes may seem more infernal than those of Romero, Hooper and Argento combined.

There's no need to retell the story - it's the same old one: a man, whose car brakes, finds himself in a place no one would want to make into, and meets people no one would want to encounter either. The trick is there are no mutants here, no rivers of blood and no nervous chasings through the woods. Everyting is very calm and routine. And that makes your skin creep. We got used to mindblowing adventures of those who got into trouble including the above-mentioned chasings with all kinds of cold arms. Not this time. The place Du Welz created is totally real, I'm sure you all saw these places, these desolate villages where few people live. And these people are not mutants, not some kind of maniacs degenerated after years of inbreeding. They are normal rural inhabitants who've been changed slightly because of the lack of communication and love maybe. The horror of the situation is that you never know when you're going to meet these people travelling by car next time. They are not in a desert and not in some solitude with no one around for hundreds of miles. They may be couple of miles from your home. Remember this is not US or Australia, it's Belgium you can spend half a day crossing in a car. If previous similar horror movies' message was - don't go too far from your home, you may find trouble, ""The Ordeal"" tells you - don't leave your house at all!
In general all that's happening in the village doesn't look like some crazy and gory nightmare, it's so real and humdrum you will be shocked. It's an ""everyday nightmare"", a personal Calvary that maybe every man has to experience once with an outcome unknown. The matter is you don't know when and where. The title ""The Ordeal"" pretty well conveys this idea albeit ""Calvair"" is much more philosophical and closer to the meaning of the film.

I'd like to mention also the great Belgian exteriors which add some terrifying coloration to the picture and make it truly dark and ominous. At this point ""The Ordeal"" is one of the most beautiful and dire movies I've seen. Besides you'd be glad (I guess) to meet some of the people you know - Philippe Nahon from ""Haute tension"" and ""I Stand Alone"", horror and erotic icon Brigitte Lahaie and I must mention the director of photography Benot Debie who shot ""Irreversible"". Anyway ""The Ordeal"" is a nice addition to the genre, I'm not sorry I bought it.",1163376000,7,3458,4.674876847290641
2616279,3,B000GRUR14,"First off let me say that Calvaire is a great flick for what it is. The cinematography is lush and the feeling of desolation that the prevades the film is ever-present. However, the film just makes no sense. Some films are supposed to puzzle people for a reason so they can come to thier own conclusions, but Calvaire just made me scratch my head.

SPOILERS

First off, I can understand the character of Bartel alone being crazy and delusional about thinking that Marc is his ex wife, but how is it that the crazy villagers share the same fantasy? How can a whole group of people have the same delusions? Is there something in the water? There is a lot of talk in the film, which is great for character development, but unfortunatley there really is none in Calvaire. You don't get any background info on the perverted villagers who assault Marc. The only thing you learn in the end is that the villagers are more sick and twisted than Bartel. Other than a minor shoot-out scene which is over with pretty quick, there really isn't much going on in the film other than Marc being tormented. The Deliverance element(you guys know what I am talking about) only last a second and isn't dwelled upon. There is, however, a quick scene of implied beastiality that really helps the viewer understand how insane the villagers really are. The ending is sudden and gives no clue to the viewer whether Marc makes it out alive or not.  Bottom line is that Calvaire is a very well-crafted film, but what good is lush cinematography and atmosphere without a well-developed story and some action. Fans of grim and disturbing cinema should pick this up.",1161388800,3,1636,4.63448275862069
2616280,4,B000GRUR14,"Disturbing; unsettling, weird; uncomfortable - these are just a few of the adjectives that most come to mind when I reflect upon this uniquely creepy film.  The English title is The Ordeal, but ordeal really isn't an adequate description of what this film's protagonist endures over the course of this 90-minute film.  I looked ""Calvaire"" up online and found that it translates from French to English as martyrdom or living death - yep, that's pretty much spot on, as I think all viewers of this film will agree.  I like my horror as deep and disturbing as I can find it, yet I've never developed a real affinity for exploitation films or for the types of films that admittedly influenced Belgian director Fabrice Du Welz (including the original The Texas Chainsaw Massacre), and I don't believe anyone, (including this film's biggest fans) can say they actually enjoyed this cinematic experience - yet there's something special and certainly compelling about Calvaire.  Even though I didn't interpret it exactly the way the director explains it, it's a darn impressive film that succeeds amazingly well at shocking and disturbing the viewer.

For a director's first feature-length movie - and one that that makes no secret of that director's cinematic influences - Calvaire achieves a sustained identity all its own, evincing a shrouded, unsettling cinematic atmosphere from the opening shot.  It's most interesting to hear Du Welz talk about his cinematic vision and the film's intended transitions from naturalism to surrealism and back.  I do have a problem with the way snow appears and disappears from the landscape (as well as the treatment of a couple of animal actors), but apart from that the cinematography is ruthlessly effective.

Calvaire asks ""What's the worst that could happen?"" and then sets about to answer that question rather definitively.  Lounge singer Marc Stevens (Laurent Lucas) already lives in a depressing, colorless world, with a couple of rather disturbing events hastening him away from his latest gig performing at a retirement home.  On the way to his next appearance, he takes to unfamiliar backcountry roads, leaving him high but not at all dry when his van breaks down in the middle of nowhere - at night - in a rainstorm.  An obviously mentally challenged stranger out looking for his dog directs him to a rural inn just up the road.  Upon Marc's arrival, the proprietor of that establishment, Bartel (Jackie Berroyer), seems nice enough, taking him in and volunteering to work on his van.  He does a number on the van, all right, but not before revealing his obvious state of mental anguish over his wife Gloria's desertion of him.  Bartel really, really wants his wife back.  Do you see where I'm going with this?  Gloria's gone, Marc's there.  Gloria was a singer, Marc is a singer.  I think you can imagine just what kind of dire situation Marc soon finds himself in.

As if things weren't bad enough for Marc already, the local villagers are also interested in ""Gloria"" - and they are even stranger than Bartel, as they prove during the oddest dancing scene I've ever seen in my life.  From this point on, all bets are off in terms of what will happen - the only guarantee is that it will be memorable and increasingly disturbing.  The ending is somewhat ambiguous, but by that point you're so knocked off-kilter that you don't really know how to react, anyway.

The making-of featurette, which consists of a lengthy interview with the director and some behind-the-scenes shots of key scenes, is extremely interesting.  Du Welz's enthusiasm is contagious, and it's refreshing to hear him acknowledge his influences while detailing his peculiar vision for this film.  It was here that I discovered that he carefully chose his actors in order to put a unique spin on the story, but my unfamiliarity with Jackie Berroyer in particular led me to interpret the story quite differently.  (Among the cast members, I should note, is Brigitte Lahaie in a small cameo role.)  Thus, I now have two different ways of looking at this film.  You just don't find that kind of depth in the vast majority of studio films, and the same thing can be said of the daring of Du Welz, Berroyer, and - in particular - Laurent.  If you're looking for something different, this is it.  You may not enjoy Calvaire, but you can't help but be impressed by it.",1159056000,26,4373,4.871621621621622

This is not a horror in a classical sense, this is more of a psychological-thriller...something on the border line between the Tenant (1976) and the Blair Witch Project (1999).  Actually, it is an intelligent and interesting study of human deprivation and loneliness...also the tittle of the movie and the ordeal the main character goes through in this film suggests something similar to what Jesus Christ went through...there is a message behind this story and I am more then 100% sure that the main character personifies Jesus Christ's last hours of pain and forgiveness before his crucifixion on the Calvaire or Golgotha mountain...to say more would only spoil further this haunting piece of European cinema...",1410998400,,1029,5.119047619047619
8134052,4,B000GRUR14,"The film tip-toes the line between being gory and suspenseful. The plot is simple: a traveling C-list singer is making his rounds from nursing home to nursing home performing for the holidays. He takes a back road during a heavy storm (clich, yes, we know) and wrecks his vehicle. He runs into a random character looking for his dog Bella in the woods---as Bella has run away---and the protagonist asks the man for help. He agrees and both men make their way to a private, secluded bed-n-breakfast. The owner of the establishment appears nice and hospitable initially but as the film continues, the viewers learn he's actually quite unstable. That's as much as I can give without giving away the entire storyline.

The scenes occurred in the nursing home, the woods, the bed and breakfast and one bar in a little town nearby. I liked this setup (versus a thousand different locations) because it created a sense of intimacy and pulled me in: I felt like I was there. I think the director selected this format so that the characters could build close relationships before the s*** hit the fan. The ongoing tension between the singer and the hostel owner erupted in several rooms throughout the house: solidifying the protagonist's sense of being trapped both physically and emotionally as he tries to rationalize what's going on around him.

I thought the film was beautifully written: it pulls at the human psyche and forces you to question what is exactly ""sane"" and what isn't. There were no monsters, no ghosts, no ""demons"", no lost footage: just the darkest parts of the human mind. During the entire film, I asked myself, "" how does one eventually figure out they're mentally unstable? And how does this instability manifest in their interactions with others."" It was very apparent about 40 minutes in that the bed&breakfast owner was sadistic and disturbed but he clearly thought his behavior was perfectly normal. There were several moments throughout the movie that could be considered ""black comedy"" or ""Dark comedy""; you want to laugh but only because you're uncomfortable. Each character exhibited raw emotion and I experienced EVERY emotion while watching this film: happy, angry, confused, sad, surprised, disturbed etc.

I'd definitely recommend this film to those who enjoy psychological thrillers. Oh and by the way, the film isn't in English and has subtitles.",1397520000,,2377,5.012658227848101
