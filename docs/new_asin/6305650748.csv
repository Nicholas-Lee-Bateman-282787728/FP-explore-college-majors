1056492,4,6305650748,This video really kept me motivated.  I would recommend it to anyone that hates going to the gym.  You can get a really good workout right at home and you can do it whenever you want!,948844800,4,183,4.055555555555555
1056493,5,6305650748,"I received this video at the beginning of January and I work out six days a week using the video. I have to say that it is the best video I have ever used and for me to stick with it this long, even on the days when I don't  feel like exercising, is a miracle. I have lost a few pounds and I know  that I have lost inches, because of the way my clothes fit.  My favorite  section is ""Kick and Jab"". Thanks Amazon.com for carrying this  video!",948326400,12,442,3.8666666666666667

I never tried kick boxing before this tape, it is really fun and quite a workout.

1056648,5,6305650748,"I used to work out for years to the VHS before my friend's VCR ate it.

1056651,5,6305650748,I had this workout some years ago but lost it. Donna has such great energy and I love all the workouts especially the dance aerobics. Also the routines are easy to follow.,1396656000,,171,4.375
1056652,2,6305650748,"After reviewing the entire video, I find that it is freezing throughout some of the workouts.  Very disppointed in this video. [ASIN:5555774923 Richardson D-3 Day Rotation 2000 [VHS]]]",1373760000,,184,5.571428571428571
1056653,5,6305650748,Great workout video.  I purchased years ago on VHS and now I have it on DVD.  Donna keeps it interesting.,1358294400,,105,4.2
1056654,5,6305650748,"I hadn't worked out for about 10 years. I worked out to the tape every weekday morning for a month. At the end of the month I looked great. I went from a size 16 to a 14 in pants, and could wear some dresses in a size 12. I had definition in my abs, legs, and arms. I was 50 years old, the workouts were challending in the beginning but got easier each day. Each one is a full body workout.

Could it be better? Sure, but I haven't encountered a perfect one. If you are looking for a good workout, that you can stick with, try this one. Give yourself a month (five days a week) and you will get results. Just eat balanced meals. I didn't diet, just ate right.

It's been two years, I've had surgery and regained the weight. Gonna start using this workout again, and I know I'll get the same results.",1336521600,,799,4.050632911392405
1056655,2,6305650748,"I was extremely excited to get this DVD.  I have been working out with Tamilee Webb and Donna Richardson for years and was thrilled to find that Donna had some DVD's of her own.  I really like her energy in the Platinum 2000 series and was looking forward to being motivated by her some more.  I have to say I was super bummed after doing the 3 day rotation workout.  Although Donna is great and her energy is, as always, super powered, the women in her class shouting and whooping it up and commenting constantly is both distracting and totally annoying.  They are often so loud that I can't hear Donna's instructions and the whole thing is just way too over the top.  If you want to get the benefit of Donna Richardson without all the annoying background chatter, I recommend you check her out, along with Tamilee Webb and Tracy York, in the Buns of Steel Platinum 2000 series.",1335052800,,879,4.4625
1056656,4,6305650748,"I have had the VHS version of this video for years and I promise you if you do the arm segment three times per week you will have the beautifully toned arms! Ladies, the workout is 10-12 minutes and awesome. Your arms will look awesome in those cute in those cute summer tops!!! It is good any level because you control the weights that you use during the workout!",1299110400,2,364,4.2898550724637685

1056739,5,6305650748,"This DVD saved me from inactivity. This is an excellent option for those who say they ""don't have enough time"" to exercise. Bologna! Anyone can fit in 20 minutes of really fun exercise a day...and combine workouts for more of a challenge when you are up to it. I really love the kickboxing (2nd workout) portion. It's fun to do and I actually look forward to doing this workout.",1168646400,2,378,4.492753623188406
1056740,4,6305650748,"Great cardio workout, but not for beginners who have no coordination.  This DVD is good, but it does not offer a lot of introduction to knew moves.  Also, the moves are executed too quickly and are not done for a long period of time.  But I love the intensity.  It really worked me through which is my goal.  If I didn't get a move, I just kept moving.  Overall, with more introduction and training of techniques prior to workout, this would be an excellent workout DVD.",1135728000,3,470,4.406976744186046
1056741,2,6305650748,"This one was a huge disappointment.  The cardio was funky but not fun, and won't do anything for your heartrate.  The cuing is poor, especially with the kickboxing, where she just goes right into a move.  The weight portion wasn't bad, but there are better tapes out there.  I really regret buying this one.",1119571200,2,307,4.62962962962963
1056742,3,6305650748,"I really enjoy Donna Richardson's workout routines. She's fun, energetic and informative in her workouts. While I love this video, I'm not a huge advocate of the 3 section workouts being so brief and would prefer longer cardio sections. To get maximum benefits, I need to do two sections and fast-forward past the next warmup to get enough cardio in. The pros of this video is that these are no nonsense, 'get results' types of moves, which are executed in proper form. For a beginner this is an excellent video that is well rounded. By incorporating her 'dance aerobics', a nice cardio section that seems less like exercise and thereby makes it seems effortless, she makes this segment a fun fat burner.",1117238400,3,704,4.778688524590164
1056743,4,6305650748,"In this video, instructor Donna Richardson offers three different exercise styles to provide a fun, varied workout experience.  She teaches an all-female class of quite enthusiastic participants, and everyone seems to be having a great time.  The first workout, called Circuit Toning on the box but Muscle Conditioning in the video itself (and I think the latter name is more appropriate) is a toning routine using weights.  Donna begins with a brief warm-up incorporating simple moves like side steps.  I think that the workout itself places a greater emphasis on the lower body, as you'll do plenty of lunges and squats both with and without dumbbells (although I actually used my weights throughout).  There are also many compound moves (eg, a plie with a shoulder press) as well as a nice amount of balance work plus a good abs section at the end; the workout concludes with a nice stretch.  Although this is a decent total body toning routine, it was my least favorite segment of the video just because it was missing the ""fun"" factor.

The second workout, Kick and Jab, gets off to kind of a slow start:  after warming you up with moves like arm circles, Donna introduces the punches, which you perform at a slow-to-average pace.  She then begins to add in some knee lifts and front kicks, but still, the pace is on the slow side, and I didn't really feel like my heart rate was going up significantly.  About halfway through the routine, however, Donna picks up the pace, starting to work in simple combinations which included some faster-speed punches.  These combos were basic but fun, utilizing all four punches, knee lifts, and mostly front kicks (there were a few side kicks thrown in).  Unfortunately, Donna's kickboxing form was poor, and she gave very little instruction about proper execution of the moves--in fact, one of the background exercises (who unfortunately was non-miked) seemed to be shouting out more tips than Donna was here.  Still, someone with prior knowledge of kickboxing should do fine with this workout, and I enjoyed it.

The final workout is Dance Party, and to my surprise, this turned out to be my favorite section of the video.  Those who can't dance have nothing to fear here, as the moves are very basic and similar to what you've seen on other exercise videos, such as toe tap, box step, march, mambo, and cha-cha.  What makes this a ""dance"" routine is that Donna adds a lot of funk to the moves, which reminded me a lot of Yoga Booty Ballet.  She links some moves together to form little routines, but there's never a long sequence of exercises to remember, and she doesn't have you continually ""take it from the top.""  Furthermore, her cueing is excellent in this segment, and above all, she and the girls are having FUN!  This workout finishes with a 2-minute cool-down and stretch, and then Donna ends the video with information about her ""Walking Club"" and general walking for fitness tips.  Overall, I highly recommend this video and would have given it 5 stars if I was rating it on the final segment alone.",1114214400,11,3058,4.777566539923955
1056744,4,6305650748,"This video has something for everyone!  I like Donna Richardson as an instructor.  She's not overly peppy, but is able to keep you moving.  I had previously used her four-day rotation workout, but this one is much better.  I've been using it regularly (5 days a week) for about two months and haven't gotten bored with it yet.
I love the kick and jab segment!  It really makes you feel strong and focused.  At first you can feel somewhat stupid trying to keep up with the third segment, which is the dance routine, but after a couple of times you catch on and it is a good workout.  Use the instructor cam segment to get the moves down.
I started out doing the regular sessions for a week and then switched to the advanced workout.  I prefer the advanced for two reasons.  First (and obviously), it's a tougher workout, but secondly, she doesn't have anyone exercising around her.  If you like a lot of noise from others, then stick to the regular workout. If you are looking for a focused workout, choose the advanced.
Without question you will have very toned arms and thighs/rear-end after sticking with this routine.",1083283200,13,1120,4.582914572864322
1056745,5,6305650748,"This three day rotation workout is great! You burn calories and have fun. It is a party that ends too soon. I love Donna's attitude. She is a motivator. I would use perky but she's laid back. The kickboxing routine has one girl that tends to interject a lot. That is a little distracting to meb but the workout is still very good. If you need a quixk workout that is effect for total body shaping, this is the way to go!",1081987200,8,420,4.134146341463414
1056746,1,6305650748,"i find donna richardson to be an african-american version of denise austin. now, i don't mean that as a compliment either. they are both very chatty and goofy. donna richardson is so hip hop and over bubbbly, she annoys me. i thought reviews of this video would be enough for me to like the workout, but i can't get past the annoying instructor, so i traded this after three veiwings, sorry donna, i just don't like your style.",1076889600,2,427,4.487179487179487
1056843,5,6305650748,"Donna is my new best friend.  She is so encouraging and perky, unlike some of the fake fitness gurus out there.  She makes things fun, does some moves that are silly but fun.  It does take a few times of doing the workout to really be able to keep up, but its just a small challenge, and worth it.",1064966400,2,297,4.0
1056844,4,6305650748,"OK, folks. Who has time for a 45-60 minute workout every day? Not me. So, if you like to feel like you're putting in *some* exercise time but don't want to add ANOTHER hour to your day, check out this fun DVD.
Three-day Rotation offers six, 20-minute workouts (three beginning, three advanced). Donna's clear directions will help you when you're learning, and the funky chatter will keep you awake, if you're doing them in the wee hours of the morning like me.
Of course, you might have your husband start chanting with Donna ""you've got to get down before you get up,"" like mine has! Seriously, I've used this DVD more than my others in the last two years. (Which is why Dave probably knows the words and commentary.)",1062201600,5,718,4.573643410852713
1056845,5,6305650748,"If you are looking for a quick work-out to energize you, this is the one to get.  I've tried all kinds and I must say that Donna's are great.  They are 20 min routines.  The ""Kick and Jab"" is my favorite, a great work-out involving kick and regular boxing moves.  It's also good to note that there are 3 beginner and 3 advanced work-outs, so this will keep you moving.",1045440000,3,368,4.214285714285714
1056846,3,6305650748,"This is my first (and maybe last) Donna Richardson workout that I'll purchase. Donna does an excellent job at providing viewers with a complete body training program. With the 3 day rotation, viewers will receive a high energy cardio and strength training workout.
I personally found the pace to be too fast and it took too long for me to learn the routine. I spent more time trying to learn the steps than focusing on the workout.",1043798400,3,431,4.6103896103896105
1056847,3,6305650748,"This is a fun, hig-energy, bouncy work out with a very smiley bunch of gals! I love that you can rotate workouts for Mon, Tues + Wednesday. I really love the mambo workout. However on the down side you have to learn very fast to keep up with the dance moves and when it comes to the stretches just keep the remote control handy to keep pausing it to actually have time to stretch.",1041984000,3,380,4.148648648648648
1056848,3,6305650748,"Donna Richardson's 3-Day Rotation workout features cardio dancing, strength training, and kickboxing segments. Each segment is also available in an advanced version, so you can keep using it over time.
For the strength training segment, you will need hand weights and an exercise mat. This segment features a lot of lunges and squatting, so if you have knee problems, this may not be a good segment for you.
The cardio dance segment features a lot of unique dance moves. The music is motivating and fun. Even if you are experienced with Donna's other workouts, such as her Donnamite workout, you will need a few run-throughs before you catch the hang of these dance moves.
The kickboxing workout is a great cardio workout. Donna teaches the fundamentals of punching: jab, upper cut, and what she calls ""stirring a big pot of soup."" The kicking section features side kicks as well as front kicks. Combined, this is an intense segment.
This is a great DVD for people who get bored doing the same workouts all the time. If you need something new and fresh to keep you going, this is the workout for you. Be aware, though, that you'll want to include some stretching in addition to this DVD to have a well-rounded fitness program.",1041206400,12,1226,4.76056338028169
1056849,5,6305650748,"It is sometimes difficult to concentrate on a workout when the instructor is taking it so seriously.  While I realize working out is a serious thing...  adding light-heartedness, ease, cheer, and plain enjoyment can really change your whole outlook on what you are actually doing.  I completed this workout and felt so great...  Actually, I felt as if perhaps I really didn't workout enough because I really enjoyed Donna's style.  The next day, my body truly felt it.  WOW!  I love to workout and thought that I wouldn't feel it...  But I did.  You go GIRL!!",1029542400,6,559,4.739583333333333
1056850,4,6305650748,I've been workouting out off and on for about two years.  I'm in pretty good shape and I get bored easily by classes that don't challenge me.  Ms. Richardson's DVD is EXCELLENT. Her workout actually has me breaking out in a sweat!!  I wish she could've included an Ab workout as a bonus.  Donna looks great so she'll give you that extra motivation to push yourself a little harder.,1029369600,2,381,4.478260869565218
1056851,5,6305650748,I am fairly new to working out and I find many videos are too complicated.  I spend more time trying to figure out where to put my feet and hands and don't hardly get a work-out.  Donna Richardson's video is a great workout...but easy to follow!!  I really enjoy it!!  I am going to buy the 4 day rotation now because I loved it so much!,1026345600,,337,4.0606060606060606
1056852,5,6305650748,"This is a great workout DVD. With three different forms of exercise to choose from- Circuit Toning, Dance Aerobics, and Kickboxing, you can't be bored! As a bonus, they have these same three forms in an advanced method. 6 total workouts, 20 minutes each. Fun and varied. Donna keeps you moving, without being obnoxious about it. I recommend!",1025481600,,341,4.896551724137931
1056927,4,6305650748,"This video has a kickboxing section, a toning section and a low impact dance aerobics section.  I liked the toning section because the leg exercises kick butt.  If you are really trying to emphasize your arms and shoulders you won't be happy but do not fear your overall body is covered.  I find that when I do some of my videos with friends or family people who tended to cheat (not doing full repetitions) were the main people who claimed they didn't get a good workout.  If you do the moves correctly there is no way this won't be effective.  The kickboxing routine is nothing fancy.  I have about 15 kickboxing tapes including this one and compared to the others this one is ok.  Donna's tape is good in that you will definitely feel it the next day and she doesn't not have you get into positions where you can do damage to a knee or some other body part.  She should give more instruction on punch throwing and foot position while kicking.  I have to admit it took me a few months after purchasing this video to even try the last aerobics section.  I reviewed the entire tape before including it in my exercise routine and I just wasn't impressed with the third section.  It just looked like a bunch of side steps done to a funky beat.  But one day I wasn't feeling up to a switching tapes and I wanted to workout a little longer than just doing the kickboxing section so I kept going.  I was so surprised ....  I do believe my mouth dropped open.  I wear a heart rate monitor so I know for sure where I stand.  I workout on carpet so some of the moves where she slides her feet on the wood floor required me to pick my feet up but overall it was to the point and effective.  I thought there is no way these simple moves can be doing any good.  Again, if you do or try to do what Donna is demonstrating you will get a workout and that's a workout in your target heart rate zone.  I don't know that I would have the same results had I not started immediately after the kickboxing section.  As any experienced exerciser knows once you get your heart rate up, you have less trouble maintaining it.  I am not convinced this section alone would get my heart rate up to the required level fast enough to be effective in just 20 minutes but doing this straight after kickboxing kept my heart rate going and it was fun.
I now do at least one of the 15 minute sections in my two week rotation.  I generally workout an hour a day 5 to 6 days a week and I like to mix up my videos and this one fits perfectly into my routine.",1023926400,8,2520,4.1846473029045645
1056928,2,6305650748,"While I enjoyed Donna Richardson's ""enthusiatic"" contributions on the Buns of Steel Platinum series, this video was an overdose of such.  On this DVD, I enjoyed the Dance Aerobics and the Kickboxing sections to a certain extent but there is way too much distracting banter going on in the background.  The Kickboxing section definitly needs more instruction on the proper excution of the moves and less kidding around.  If Donna decides to do a series where she concentrates more on serious instruction, I would definitly buy it.  Her moves are great but lets get serious!",1023148800,,572,4.989473684210527
1056929,2,6305650748,"I've had this video for quite some time.  This morning, I blew the dust off it and popped it in my VCR.  I fast-forwarded to the dance portion and remembered why it's been sitting on my shelf for so long: it's annoying and not interesting.  The dance is hard to follow because none of the girls in the video are in sync and it seems to be mostly walking from side to side while twisting your hips in akward ways.  I found that I sweat more blasting music and dancing on my own without Donna's video.  I don't really have an opinion on the kick and jab routine.  It's definately better choreographed than the dance.  (Although, I still prefer Billy Blanks.)  However, I do really like the circuit toning.  Despite her yelling, ""I got your back"" every five seconds, I like it.  I felt the burn in my entire body and have noticed results.  I would only recommend this video to someone who is looking to tone muscles; not lose weight.  And thank goodness I have a mute button!",1021593600,5,972,4.368715083798882

I can tell a difference in my arms definately.  The kickboxing to me is good but I am so tired of that.  The dance segment I do a couple of times a week because my 5 year old loves to do it too.  The DVD has alot of options because in each workout Donna has a advanced segment you could opt for.

I enjoy Donna's enthusiam but the blonde behind her on the tape is distracting.  She is not very coordinated and her moves are so exagerrated that I tend to find myself focusing on her and wondering what exactly is she doing there.  Once I get beyond that...it happens each time...I find by combining all 3 segements I get an adequate workout.",1015545600,3,466,4.383720930232558
1056933,5,6305650748,"I love Donna Richardson, and find her videos to be very motivating as well as entertaining.  Her sincere personality just draws you in.
This video starts with the toning, which is usually put at the end.  All of the moves are standing, and her key position in this one is the lunge.  There is a lot of focus on the legs, but not really too much on the arms.  The best part of the toning segment is the ab work.  As usual she comes up with some more innovative moves rather than just typical sit-ups.  Overall though, I wish there would've been more reps, because she seems to kind of fly through this portion of the video.
However, she makes up for it in the ""Kick and Jab"" section.  This is an intense work-out that will leave you feeling like you did something really good for your body.  It's not easy though, especially if you have no experience (like myself).  She just jumps right in and does it, so you might get lost and even a little frustrated at first, but you'll get the hang of it in no time.  She does let you know what combination you're gonna do and gives you a few seconds to organize it in your head; such as: jab, jab, bob, upper-cut, hook, jab, bob.  I don't think that's an actual combo, but just an example of what one might sound like.
Last is ""Dance Party.""  It's the little treat at the end, where it's all about having a good time and not concentrating so much (especially after the ""Kick and Jab"" routine).  The dances are funk and Latin inspired.  Donna looks terrific and seems to be completely in her element in this segment of the video.  She even does a little rap.  This part is a great way to end everything.
You'll enjoy this video for sure.",1012867200,3,1676,4.289808917197452
1056934,5,6305650748,"A better workout than Tae-Bo, and more rhythm than Denise Austin. I have to hand it to Donna, her routines actually WORK. I was diagnosed with early osteoporosis in Sept. 2000 (I was 43 at the time), and immediately bought this tape, inspired by the idea of three 20-minute rotations. By using Donna's workouts 3x per week for 20 minutes at a time, my bones started regenerating. After one year my tests showed significant improvement. In addition, I had muscles for the first time in my life -- very impressive to everyone who knows me.
Now I work out with more intensity and more focus on executing the postures correctly. And I'm feeling the benefits in muscles I didn't know I had. I feel like Donna and her crew are my FRIENDS. I heartily endorse this tape!!",1012176000,4,763,4.576642335766423

The dance aerobic segment can be hard to follow for the uncoordinated (that's me!) and you need weights for the circuit toning, but it's all good, baby.
Great for beginners and 50 lbs. + individuals (that's me, too!) and overall an excellent bargain both in cost and time.",1011916800,,448,5.04054054054054
1056936,5,6305650748,"Even when I don't feel like doing anything, I find it easy to get through at least 2 of the 15 minute routines although I only intended to do one.  My favorite routine is Kick and Jab.",1006905600,,184,3.972972972972973

1057034,5,6305650748,"I love this workout!  This is a great DVD to get if you want to get fit!  While Donna is perky and motivating,  she doesn't grate on your nerves. The weight workout is well balanced and can easily be adapted to different levels by changing the weights.  Its hard to believe you get such a thorough workout in only 20 minutes!  The kickboxing section really makes you sweat and the dance section is funky and had some pretty good dance moves.  As someone who gets bored VERY easily, I am always amazed how often I can do this!  Donna is great at cueing and the camera doesn't do what alot of workout videos do.  (WHY WHY do they focus on people's upper bodies when you are learning a new move???!!!) Anyway, even on days I am loathe to exercise,  I can totally do this one, its fun!",997315200,38,781,4.258503401360544
1057035,3,6305650748,I purchased the video because I liked the idea of three different twenty minute workouts on one tape.  The cardio segment I didn't like.  It was too hip hoppy with hard to follow dance steps.  The kickboxing segment was ok; I have done a lot better.  The weight trainig workout was the best.  It worked the total body with an extra emphasis on the lower body with  lunges and squats.  This one unfortunately sits on my shelf with a lot of other unused workout videos I bought.,996883200,,476,4.402298850574713
1057036,3,6305650748,"I purchased this title because I was looking for something that would take advantage of the DVD features. Other than the options to play whichever segment that I wanted, when I wanted, without having to rewind or fast forward, this is no different than a tape.
I had been encouraged to use the Instructor Cam when starting out .. in order to zoom in on the instructor for a better view of each new exercise. Unfortunately, the person who created the Instructor Cam view apparently was not paying attention to the exercises .. because occassionally the instructor was talking about a leg exercise, while the Instructor Cam was zooming in on her face. It wasn't until I switched views that I discovered that I had been doing some of the exercises incorrectly, based on what she was saying.
I do like the kickboxing segment .. this being my first experience with that type of an activity. I did feel rather lost at first, not knowing how to do some of the exercises that moved very fast. But now that I have caught on .. I'm grateful for the fast pace. I do work up a sweat .. and my heart is beating faster at the end.
I have not exercised regularly for a year or so, and was somewhat out of shape. This DVD was not a bad choice to help me get back into the swing of it all. I do imagine that once I'm back in shape, I will move on to something a little more challenging.",995500800,5,1369,4.289575289575289
1057037,5,6305650748,"Donna Richardson has saved my workout life!  I hate aerobics.  I took a class last summer and tried to get my money back before it was over.  I went to several of the classes and could tell that they were benefitting me.  However, I just don't like the choreography.  The Kick and Jab portion of this video provides me with a quick, entertaining workout.  Donna has a great personality.  I feel stronger and more energetic after just 5 days of working out.  I do this before I go to work AND when I come home!!!  This video has made me want to try more of Donna's workouts.",993081600,2,573,4.280373831775701
1057038,3,6305650748,"I bought this when I started exercising at home and hoped that the ""pick your routine"" option would really be cool.  It's not.  You have to have good exercise routines for that to work.  The circuit training portion is a good workout, but I, as a real beginner, found none of the workouts to be vigorous AT ALL.  They barely raised my heart rate at all and I much prefer my Denise Austin and Kathy SMith tapes.  I think DVD is a great medium for workout videos, but this is not its best incarnation.",990576000,,499,4.26595744680851
1057039,5,6305650748,I did this video two days ago and I'm still feeling the effects. The exercises are easy and fun to do and there's a lot of variety. The toning section really works and isn't hard to do. The kickboxing section is very challenging and the dance section is just a lot of fun!!  This video is great to do in separate sections are all at once for 60 minutes. This is definitely a great video to add your daily workouts.,990576000,2,414,4.175
1057040,5,6305650748,"I bought this video for my wife. She has taken many aerobics classes over the years, but having two small children finding the time to leave the house for a class isn't possible.  This tape gives her a workout that she finds as challenging as working out at the  gym with enough variety to keep her interested.  Also, with the workouts only being twenty minutes she is able to find the time each day to workout.",988156800,2,411,4.381578947368421
1057041,4,6305650748,"My New Year's Resolution was to lose weight and get into shape. So I asked my brother from Maryland to send me a workout tape for Christmas. When I received all my goodies I had a real treat inside. Donna Richardsons' 3 day Rotation tape not only helped me feel more energized, it gave me the help that I needed to get through my diet. The most enjoyable of the tape was the kickboxing segment. The kicking, jabbing and punching were fun and it made me feel energetic. It had my heart pumping and my body sweating, but was all good though. Donna is an excellent instructor, she gave me the confidence to go along with the exercises when she states "" I've got your back"". The aerobic segment was nice to, working with weights helped tone my arms up. Donna really focused on lunges they were great for toning up my legs. The dance segment was very creative. Overall this video is great for anyone who has a busy schedule. I exercised with the tape at least 4 times a week or more. Along with a balanced diet and plenty of water I lost over 13 pounds in 7 weeks. I will continue to use this tape along with my diet into my everyday routine.",983836800,16,1137,4.268518518518518
1057042,5,6305650748,"at first, the kickboxing and dance segments were a little too ""coordination oriented"" for me (i'm surprised i haven't hit myself in the face doing the kickboxing), but i've been using the instructor cam, and it makes it so much easier.  with the instructor cam, you can watch one person, the whole way through.  i can do these workouts now!  i definately recommend this dvd.  and after you learn the beginner workouts (which are challenging enough), you can move on to an advanced workout with only donna.  she has done it again!",983404800,4,529,4.706521739130435
1057117,5,6305650748,"I really like the workouts and the fact that they are 20 mins long.  I can rotate the different workouts and not get bored too quickly and then once I am ready for the advance workout, I do not need to buy the next tape, she already has the advance workout on the DVD.  I definitely recommend this DVD for those who like to dance and get ""funky"" in their workouts!",981417600,,364,4.112676056338028
1057118,5,6305650748,"All 3 of the segments (rather done together or independently) give you a great workout and best of all they allow for a workout between 20 and 60 minutes! In 20 minutes you can get your heart pumping and start feeling good without having to sacrifice too much time. I alternate between 20 and 40 minutes workouts on this DVD and some of the other videos in my collection (Denise Austin, Jane Fonda, Tae Bo...). None of them work it like Donna Richardson though!",979776000,3,461,4.5
1057119,5,6305650748,"I love this tape.  Donna is motivating, energetic, and a great trainer.  The routines are fun, effective, and varied to prevent boredom.  I usually combine the workouts to get a full workout, but I like the option of a  short workout when I am pressed for time.  I am an experienced exerciser,  and primarily work out to videos.  I like a lot of variety and  ""spunk"" without the Barbie factor.  If you are looking for a fun,  compact workout led by a spunky gal you'd like to hang out with after  class, this is it.  I also highly recommend her 4 Day Rotation toning  series.  But hey, I like (and own) all of her videotapes.  Happy  exercising!",960508800,13,645,4.384615384615385
1057120,4,6305650748,Getting back in the swing of being fit is always hard. Donna Richardson's 3-Day Rotation is a great way to do it. I enjoy this one. I can't stand some of the regular blonde instructors who seem to babble during the work  out and don't get you anywhere. This works your whole body in three  different ways. The kick and jab is intense while the dance and toning are  not as intense. This is great for any level. I will buy more of her tapes.,955670400,10,440,4.152941176470589

The first night I fast forwarded to the  cardio-kickboxing segment.  I liked it a lot and found that it really got  my heart beating and me sweating!  The next day I did the dance-aerobic  part.  It was not for me.  The moves were more about looking  ""smooth"" than actually getting a workout.  Donna also continued  to say ""I've got your back"", which is kind of weird considering  she isn't in my family room excercising with me.  Last night I did the  toning segment.  It was OK, but I didn't feel like she concentrated on my  arms very much.
