7970148,5,B00006JEA0,"Scott Snot vs D- This is a standard opening match. Scott doesn't get totally destroyed, and D shows off some nice offense. Grade C

GQ money vs Angel- Very good match. They where having an action packed high impact match. The finish could have been much better. Grade B

Mexico's Most Wanted vs Kronus & Kraq-  MMW always put on a great matcha dn this was no different. Kronus didn't get into this match very much which is disappointing since he usually puts on a great match. Kraq isn't very good, I am surprised he never made it to wwe. Grade B

Pogo vs Steve Rizzano- A solid match again. Rizzano is angry that he has to face Pogo and the enterprise doesn't send out any help for him. Pogo shows his impressive power. Grade B

Psychosis vs Juvi- One of the best matches on the DVD. They really went at it, and put on a great lucha libra style match. Grade A

Damien Steele vs Konnan- Really good match, with a su;prising heel turn. Steele showed an impressive martial arts backround. Konnan put on a good match but I have sen better from him. Grade B+

New Jack vs Kaos- It was a very good match, but none of the amazing high spots from New Jack. After the match New Jack destroys GQ Money. Oh wait we see the high spot! GradeA

Johnny Webb vs Mystery Opp- Taking on Jobber, for the title. Webb destroys the jobber but then Vampiro shows up! Just when you think Vampiro and Webb will battle for the title, the Sandman shows up! I am like a kid in a candy store. It was a brutal hard hitting affair. I was just disappointed my favorites didn't win! Grade A

Supreme vs Vic Grimes- Holy sh@!, wow was this match hardcore. It was an exploding ring match. Sometimes this can be very boring since the bombs don't do much. This match if very different Vic gets his arm torched when one of the bombs goes off. This was awesome. Grade A+

I was going to rate this DVD 4 stars but the last few matches where fantastic. Especially the last match which was fantastic. Grade A",1185148800,,1967,4.277628032345014
7970149,4,B00006JEA0,"Once again, like with Damage Inc., Best of XPW Television, and Exit Sandman. Nobody wrote a review, so then I will. I wrote a review for Retribution for fun and typing practice. And so before the situation gets blown to hell, I will write a review for Blown to Hell.  This event takes place in Pico Rivera Sports Arena rodeo rink in Pico Rivera, California.  It seems to be the event following Damage Inc.  The event is called Halloween in Hell 2.  The first match is between D and Scott Snot. O.K. match. D is looking to wrestle against members of Rob Black's Black Army.  The second match is Angel vs. G.Q. Money. Good match.  The third match is a tag team match; Halloween and Damien 666 ie. Mexico's Most Wanted vs. Kraq and Kronus. Good Match.  The fourth match is Pogo vs. Steve Rizzono w/ the help of T.J. Rush. Great match. Pogo is real good.  The fifth match is Juventude vs. Pscicosis. O.K. match.  The sixth match is Konnan vs. Damien Steele. Good match, but Lady Victoria betrays Konnan by spraying pepper spray in his eyes. And Damien Steele wins the match.  The seventh match is Kaos vs. Nu Jack. To watch this match you must use the individual select match option, because of some fault of the DVD the regular play option skips over it. This match is for the XPW T.V. title. And Nu Jack is cheated out of a win by other members of Enterprize with Kaos. Great Match.  The eighth match is Johnny Webb vs. Vampiro vs. Sandman for the World Title. Good match. Johnny Webb steals a pin for the victory.  The ninth and final match is a death match for the Death Match Title. Supreme vs. Vic Grimes. Great bloody match.  This is a good DVD.",1127433600,2,1648,4.381578947368421
7970150,5,B00006JEA0,This DVD is great! I have just started watching XPW and for a first time watcher it was well woth the money. I give it 5/5. It has some amazing matches.

7970151,1,B00006JEA0,"I've only seen one video and it was horrible. This is not even
wrestling. They say there better than ECW (Extreme Championship Wrestling)yeah right,I'll belive that when I see it. Don't waste
your money on Rob Black's company. If you want to buy something
extreme get EC f'n W.",1025740800,2,277,4.673469387755102
7970152,2,B00006JEA0,"The undercard for this event in quite terrible, no good fights untill Kaos vs. New Jack, and thats only good after the match ends and GQ Money comes out.
The only really good match on the disc in the exploding ring deathmatch between Grimes and Supreme, but even this match has its flaws.  Unlike the infamous Terry Funk, Cactus Jack exploding ring deathmatches, the explosives are next to the beds of barbed wire and not under them, so really it just looks like a fireworks display next to the wrestler when they land on them.  So you have to ask yourself is one really good match worth the [money] you have to pay for this disc?  The DVD comes with these extras, match histories and a XPW ""best of"" video clip which is pretty cool.",1021766400,,733,4.4148148148148145
