8429035,5,B003555GKQ,I previewed this because I work with children. I was hooked immediately. The narrators voice is great and the animals are wonderful. I was only sorry when it ended.  I have watched it several times. It is a great connection to nature and puts you in an appreciative and relaxed mood. I've found all the Jimmy WIlson films to be good.,1286841600,,333,4.459016393442623
8429036,5,B003555GKQ,"I loved watching the animals in their native habitat - almost like being with the animals in the Minnesota north woods. In a world of questionable entertainment, it is really refreshing to see a film the whole family can enjoy! This film is definitely worth the purchase.",1286755200,,271,4.787234042553192
8429037,5,B003555GKQ,"Our family thoroughly enjoys Jimmy Wilson's films -- the whole series. Each film entertains and educates from the unique perspective of an avid outdoorsman, pilot and adventurer. Jimmy unfolds these adventures in far-flung locations with captivating footage, expert information, and sights you would never otherwise observe.

We highly recommend Jimmy Wilson's series of award winning quality films for children and families looking for substance in family entertainment.",1265068800,,471,6.029850746268656
