8695972,4,B00RVAB7LS,"London window washer Ginger (Victor Henry) subscribes to the share and share alike policy with his best mate Dwyer (Jack Shepherd) particularly when it comes to their conquests of the opposite sex.  This relaxed attitude toward sexual mores suits Ginger fine until he meets virginal teacher Jill (Susan George) and he begins to reassess his priorities.  If this plot description sounds familiar any resemblance to ""Alfie"" is purely intentional.  Released in 1969 this film interestingly enough attempts to exploit the new permissiveness prevalent at the time while injecting an old school morality.  The young cast do a fine job making their flawed characters empathetic.  The film has a terrific closing shot of Ginger in a coffee house juggling his old ways while evaluating the man he wishes to become. Despite the subject matter and the titillating poster art the film is not that explicit in language or what is shown on screen which may disappoint some.  Not a classic film but a fascinating time capsule from the era in which it was made.",1432425600,11,1045,5.011560693641618
