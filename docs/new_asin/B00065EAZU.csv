2168925,3,B00065EAZU,"My baby does enjoy this show, but seems more interested in a DVD that we just got ""Singing Babies Nursery Rhyme Time.""  This DVD has the babies singing the nursery rhymes, which so captivates little Michael (age 7 months) that he watches these singing babies over and over again.  We actually rotate between ""Baby Genius"" and ""Singing Babies.""",1127347200,8,343,4.896551724137931
2168926,5,B00065EAZU,"My one year old loves this DVD. I also bought the combo Einstein DVDs but his response to them was so-so. Maybe he will find Baby Einstein DVD's interesting once he grows up - at least that is my hope since I spent $$$ on it. But this DVD is very colorful, has nice rhymes, music and has the right combination of cartoon characters, kids and folks dressed as animals ! I must have played it so many times already - I am always a bit scared that he might get bored but he has not showed a sign. Definitely, a best buy and worth every penny [and much more if you are buying at current amazon price of $5.99 - I bought at $10.99 at B&N store]. I am buying the combo BabyGenius 8-Pack DVDs at current sale price of $39.99 here at Amazon. Don't forget that these DVD's come with the audio soundtracks in accompanying CDs which are free.",1124668800,6,831,4.167701863354037
2168927,5,B00065EAZU,"I have the Baby Einstein's, Curious Buddies, and Barney, but this BG's Favorite nursery rhymes is my four month old girl's favorite.  She will watch it over and over without fussing.",1115942400,24,182,4.870967741935484
2168928,5,B00065EAZU,"I was originally shopping for a music cd only to re-learn some nursery rhymes to sing to my 1st baby.  I loved this video and my 6 month old is just entranced by it too.  He makes goo goos at some of the songs that I think he must enjoy.  I love that it is an interactive learning video - including kids as well as animated characters.  It sings the ABC's, numbers, and a good selection of nursery rhymes I remember as a child. It's a good video to have your child associate the nursery rhymes to actual images.  My sister in law has a 2 year old and also loved it, so I ended up buying her one too.",1113782400,9,599,3.9583333333333335
2168929,5,B00065EAZU,"My 2 year old loves this...as I said over and over again.  He gets up saying ""nursery rhymes"" wanting to watch it.  It also had a good variety of scenes, different from the Baby Einstein scenes which tend to be the same thing over and over again.  We'll probably buy a few more of these to check them out.",1105056000,,305,4.135593220338983

2169088,5,B00065EAZU,"This is my first Amazon review but I just wanted to say how great this DVD is; my daughter does a little dance in anticipation when she sees me put it in the DVD player.  She just stands and holds onto the coffee table and stares at the screen when it starts.  It gives me time to clean up after breakfast because she is so preoccupied--She loves it!  Several other DVDs including baby Einstein (Mozart, Beethoven) and baby genius underwater adventures are too slow to keep her interest.

2169109,5,B00065EAZU,THE BEST VIDEO EVER! I have two children and 9 nieces and nephews. There is no other video I can say that has the power to captivate and cure crabbiness than this DVD. I'm not sure what it is... My sister and I call it baby crack. Lol but all jokes aside its a wonderful nursery rhyme video that incorporates song with cartoon visual and real life visuals including the nursery rhymes characters. It's cute and fun and somehow not annoying to listen to( probably bc I know it makes me kids happy) it also includes the cd for the car! If you have a young child or know someone who is having a baby but this they will thank you! I recommend for ages 0months-5yrs,1368662400,,660,4.246031746031746

No matter where she is or what she is doing, this dvd brings a smile on her lips. I feed her while she watches it , so feeding fussiness is gone. Now daddy or mommy can feed baby alone without the need of the other doing the entertaining part. Feeding time is dvd time , so one of us finishes up other work, instead of both being engaged in feeding her.
 I play the CD in the car and she stays happy all through the drive.

I definitely recommend it. It is fun and educative.
I have no complains about the product , neither does baby.",1365292800,,652,4.046511627906977

2169117,5,B00065EAZU,"Visiting my 22mo old grand-daughter in Rio, Brazil. Let me just say that THIS is the BEST toddler nursery rhymes collection. The DVD, in particular, is so well done! Has cute little children, ages 3 and up (would like to  seen a few toddlers). Maybe Farmer in the Dell, I would have scripted characters to the song. And I couldn't make the connection with the trains on London Bridge. Maybe it's just me not knowing the true story. All in all, the DVD is so nearly perfect. Our little girl sings and dances to all the songs. She's tryng to say the words to ""Ring""Around the Rosey"" and has ""picked up"" many of the letter sounds on ""A, B, C"" song. And it is really good for GamGam's conditioning, as on several songs, my grand daughter commands me to hold her and dance around with her. ""Ring Around Rosey""is a workout!!!  Must have for all toddlers! Unless you don't wish for them to sing and dance.",1363996800,2,898,4.403614457831325

But he sits still and watches the entire DVD at one go without blinking or complaining. Can you imagine how much work I get done in that much time! Whew! Its surprizingly not animated, its with real children and animals. There are animated parts to it of course but its still mostly real children and animals. I absoltely love the bonus video of No more monkeys jumping on the bed, it has a very fun rock twist to it. I didn't get the bonus CD though when I purchased it.",1359331200,,599,4.217391304347826

The singers are not so bad but nothing amazing as well. It is a cute and simple production,not annoying at all... (my husband and I always end up singing along) If you are looking for fancy animation Disney and Nick Jr status don't buy this DVD, but if you are willing to introduce your child to the old nursery rhymes and old fashion ways to have fun, go ahead, trust me your child will enjoy!!!!",1357603200,,681,4.456

They have been watching this since they were months old and I always played this when they were being difficult to manage or on long trips. It distracts them and calms them instantly. Now that they are older and can talk a bit, they ask for Baby Genius by name. They know some of the words to the rhymes just by watching it many times and they enjoy dancing to the music. It is upbeat but not too loud or insane. The quality of music and sound is excellent. This DVD has not failed us, so I am giving it the five stars that it deserves and highly recommend it to anyone. I have given it to friends who had babies and they have told me that their babies love it too.",1345680000,,750,4.074324324324325

There's lots to learn with ABC's, 123's, nursery rhymes, animals, etc. that are on this DVD.  I have to say that my son sits down and pays close attention to this DVD and when its on he immediately lights up.  He especially loves the 12,I love You song.  With that said, I think that the DVD is very good because it uses music to help the child remember what's being taught.  Also, it shows the live animals that are being referred to during the nursery rhymes...again reinforcing what is being taught.  Very satisfied and will buy more Baby Genius DVDs. Also, I love that it has the continuous play option because my son loves to watch this back to back!",1345075200,,746,4.369565217391305

Unfortunately, at least six of the songs on it are also on the previous DVD.  However, this one mixes more live action with cartoon characters and does add some extras like ""London Bridge"", ""She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain"" & several others.  My grandson is totally mesmerized by it, and when he gets upset I turn it on to soothe him.

It's probably her favorite DVD and we have bought 3 other DVDs in this series later on. There is so much she can relate to.  When our daughter watches this DVD it is as though she becomes part of the action. This is how kids DVDs should be; fun, realistic and educative too. And we love the songs too, so it's not a punishment for us as parents to become part of our daughter's joy. We are not even native English speakers as we live in main land Europe. This DVD plays without any problems on our region 2 (Europe) DVD player. Highly recommended. You can watch pre-views on VidzForKids or YouTube.",1337990400,,773,4.258503401360544

2169147,5,B00065EAZU,"We got this DVD for our oldest, when she was a baby. I can`t even begin to count the number of hours she sat there, absolutely transfixed on the TV, while this was playing. (And no, we don't use the TV as a baby-sitter; she just loved it so much, it was on at least daily!)

Fast-forward a year, and her little brother did the same thing. Whenever it came on, he'd stop whatever he was doing and come running to watch. (Our daughter, of course, still loved it just as much.)

It's now been six years, and our newest baby girl, now almost eight months old, is every bit as in awe as her siblings. Even the mere sight of the FBI Warning gets her jumping for joy, in her Exersaucer!

I really don't know what it is about this particular DVD that incites such nimo in our children. We have several other Baby Genius and Baby Einstein DVDs, plus an entire channel (BabyFirst) of this kind of stuff. The kids certainly enjoy all of them, to one degree or another; yet somehow, this one disc is what that all three have consistently clamored for, jumping and squealing in utter delight, despite our giving (or at least, attempting to give) equal time to other media and activities.

The babies and kids love them so much. You can't get them anymore at stores
but if you are lucky you can come across the set on e bay.
It is worth all the money as it helps a child to learn so fast so early so much.

My 4 month old granddaughter loved it immediately and still wants to see it daily.  She is now over 7 months old and still LOVES this set.  I think it is popular with babies because the songs on the DVD are sung by children and the images are mostly young children and animals.  When Woot recently had a Kidswoot of a Baby Genius Bundle, I ordered the bundle.  I was dismayed that not all the DVDs feature young children's voices.  My granddaughter is not as facinated by the other DVDs as she is with the Favorite Nursey Rhymes.  I just hope that as she gets older, the other ones will please her.

I can highly recommend the Baby Genius Favorite Nursey Rhymes for young babies, but at this point, cannot recommend any of the others as highly.  If you want to try one instead of buying a bundled set, this one is right for younger babies.",1307232000,,996,4.306451612903226

2169185,4,B00065EAZU,"I bought this after I felt that my daughter needed some musical DVD's to keep herself amused and busy. However at the same time I also wanted it to be educational. I had read reviews about the DVD before buying and a parent had mentioned the disconnect between the graphics and the wording of the rhymes. Even though that parent was right, I don't think that it's such a big deal for a 17 month old. They are gripped by the music, kids, animals and animations in the DVD rather than the exact tying of pictures with the wording. We as adults might be more disturbed by it however since I don't intend to or recommend using it as a teaching tool for your child where you would sit, pause and tell the child what they are looking it, it really doesn't matter. There are other DVD's structured for that.  My daughter loves it, she is engaged by it and is trying to say the words that she has been repetitively hearing. However I must caution all parents that these DVD's have an addictive potential. My daughter wants to watch it all the time. She even tries to put it in the DVD player by herself!!! My advice, stay in control and don't give more than a designated time per day. Also don't use these DVD's to replace your time and attention that your child is entitled to. I often watch it WITH her and dance and sing along. I recently went to my daughter's music class with her and felt like a proud mom when I  knew most of the rhymes due to this DVD!!

We discovered them on Comcast On Demand and she enjoyed them enough that we bought the DVD.  She's now singing along with some of them, like ""Twinkle, Twinkle.""  She especially likes to do the actions along with ""If You're Happy and You Know It"" and our own crazy stuff for ""No More Monkeys.""

For the price, we've gotten more than our money's worth out of it, but the content of the video is starting to show its age.  The animation is pretty archaic, amera work isn't especially professional, with the heads of kids and characters cut off regularly and zooming in and out of a shot.  For production values, I'd give it a lower rating, but I can't argue with how much our kiddo loves it.

We've watched it enough times now that I've noticed some... interesting things.  In ""BINGO"" watch one of the cows just before the ""B"" clapping part.",1261958400,,934,4.485207100591716

I have a number of the Baby Genius DVD and they are all great. From around 3 months old, my daughter will just stare at the TV at all the bright colors and beautiful images. It has such soothing music, and she never fusses the whole time this is on. I recommend these DVD's for any parent who sometimes just needs to do something baby-free for a little bit. Whether you want to read a book or magazine, do some laundry, clean the house, make dinner, etc.  I do also own a couple of the Baby Einstein (which is a Disney product).  The Baby Einstein DVD's are just as good as the Baby Genius, however Baby Genius is a little cheaper and comes with the CD of all the music played on the DVD.  The bonus CD is really nice to take with you on trips in the car, or during bath time, etc.  Disney does sell the bonus CD's of all their Baby Einstein DVD's, but they do not come included in the price of the DVD.",1249171200,2,1068,4.086124401913875

I expected the DVD to show actions along with the rhymes so my 2 year old would watch and learn to act along. Instead most of the songs have cheesy animation that failed to hold my toddler's attention. The scenes change too fast, they're not coordinated with the rhyme, for instance, when the rhyme goes ""the cat takes the rat"", the scene shows kids on a pony or kids running around. The bonus CD has many additional songs but it seems like a cheap production where the singers don't sing the words clearly. How is a toddler going to learn the lyrics if you can't hear the words clearly in the din of the background music?

He never payed much attention to the Baby Einstein from the beginning.  My take is that the graphics are cheap and cheezy.  I know it's for kids and they don't know the difference, but there is something to be said for making a DVD that took a day and less than $100 and charging $10.00 each for them.

Feature: There is a ""repeat play"" option that I use, so that if I'm not in the room at the end, it just loops around to the intro again.

2169213,5,B00065EAZU,My twins are 3 mnths old and they LOVE this DVD. One of them even tries to sing along ( gurgle baby language of course). I even sing along too. I will be looking for more of these because it keeps them happy and entertained!,1201564800,,224,4.0
2169214,5,B00065EAZU,"I'm the mommy of twin 19 month old boys and they love the Baby Genius ""song"" DVDs. They don't really like tv which isn't the result of anything I've done or not done, they're just always moving and won't stay still long enough to notice most things on tv. However, they love to dance along with the songs on the Baby Genius DVDs.

I spent a small fortune on 8 Baby Einstein DVDs and have been trying repeatedly for the past 14 months to get the boys interested in them. They could care less about those but they fell instantly in love with the Baby Genius Nursery Rhymes DVD the first time I put it in (they were 13 months old at the time)  They love the shots of kids playing and dancing and try to imitate them.

As soon as this DVD starts they begin clapping so now we save it ""special occassions"" when we're in desperate need of a smile (sick days, long car rides, etc.)

**I highly reccommend the Baby Genius DVDs with songs for any little ones that love to dance around. Not only are they cheaper than the Baby Einstein DVDs but they come with a bonus CD!**",1201564800,,1063,4.221674876847291

The songs are old favorites with updated beats.  They are so catchy a lot of my family members (including myself) are singing it at work!  If you have a 1 to 2 year old, buy this and get ready to relearn the old nursery rhymes.

2169216,5,B00065EAZU,"For your child to fully enjoy this product, you have to sing-along with them to the various tunes and also do the various actions.  I recently purchased this product and could hardly wait for my god-daughter to visit just to see how well she'll enjoy it.  She loved every moment of it!! It's a joy to watch her, at 1 years trying to sing along and do the actions. The videos are colourful and the characters are in line with the music. Just a pity that the DVD does not have the same amount of nursery rhymes as the musical CD.  I do not regret purchasing this item.

communicate through babling. He was rocking with the music and enjoying
the video very much. When I preview the one I bought, I realized that

And I appreciate that for most of the songs they did not change the original words. I have had a hard time finding DVDs and CDs with the original words and not a ""re-writing"" to suit the theme of the video.

One problem though, these are not what I would consider Nursery Ryhmes, but children's songs. I was hoping for something with ""little jack horner,"" ""Sing a song of Sixpence"" ""Old King Cole"" etc. These are truly children's' songs.",1175385600,,614,4.482142857142857

She and her little brother who is just 17 months absolutely LOVE music and animals both, but at that age don't really have the attention span to watch for long periods of time.  They love Dora and Winnie the Pooh and Barney and all the typical favorites, but lose interest after about 5-10 mins.  Something about the Baby Genius series though keeps them glued to it for the whole thing, then begging to watch it again.

I think it's the mix of both animation along with life action kids and animals that they like and it's amazing how quickly they've picked up the songs and the animal sound in ""Old Mcdonald.""  Twinkle Twinkle is another favorite, plus my niece loves to listen to the bonus cd in the walkman and headphones she also got for her b-day.

2169249,4,B00065EAZU,"I consider this and other Baby Genius videos to be a good value. They do have much poorer production qualities than the Einstein videos, but the educational value is essentially the same. Like Einstein, these use classical (or in this case, classic) music and ""real-life"" images to teach your child. My daughter and I have been watching these videos, in shortened form, for free on Comcast cable's On Demand service for months. I used to point out various objects to her, such as the dogs that are shown during B-I-N-G-O. Well, when I put the CD with the same song on in the car, she out of the blue one day said ""doggy"" and started clapping as I would do during the video! So the videos are definitely useful, even if they're not as pretty as the Einstein products. As a bonus, they are far cheaper. I also found it funny when one reviewer pointed out the advertising (presumably for other Baby Genius products) in the video. Though I did find it annoying that the ""bonus"" material was just that -- advertising -- you have to admit that Einstein does a lot of advertising on their videos too.

Finally, I am not aware of an Einstein video that features these classic nursery rhymes/songs, and they really are a lot of fun.",1138233600,,1223,4.53393665158371
