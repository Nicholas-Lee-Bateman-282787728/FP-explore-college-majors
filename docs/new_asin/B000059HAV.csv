1404858,2,B000059HAV,"Waylon (Corin Nemec) and Buzz (David Faustino) are two layabout losers who work with the elderly at a hospital, but find themselves jobless after the humiliation of having a full bedpan thrown at their heads. However being the highly ambitious guys they are, Waylon and Buzz decide the best thing to do is to go out to a club and try to score with some hot babes. As only happens in the movies, they met two gorgeous women (Caroline Keenan & Danielle Harris) with personality defects who will sleep with them only if Buzz and Waylon can score some weed for them. Normal people would tell them to get lost, but not these guys, and soon the entire plot of this movie surrounds the not-so-hilarious misadventures of Waylon and Buzz as they spend the night trying to get drugs. This movie is solid proof that there is no life after MARRIED WITH CHILDREN and PARKER LEWIS CAN'T LOSE. Features a cameo from Robert Stack as a drug kingpin. You're better off renting an old Cheech and Chong movie instead, at least UP IN SMOKE and NICE DREAMS are funny.",1042848000,5,1045,4.534391534391534
1404859,5,B000059HAV,"This is a really funny movie!  David Faustino and Corin Nemac are great together and really seem like life-long friends, and Caroline Keenan and Danielle Harris (from Urban Legend) are great.  It's not a typical stoner movie for me, but a simple comedy about the stupid things guys might do just to get the girls, and how girls know it and use them.  The best part was when David Faustino thought we was going to jail and we cries, ""I'll be tortured and humiliated and some huge hairy man will make me toss his salad!""",999561600,3,518,4.431578947368421
1404870,5,B000059HAV,Got it today and I loved it haha good movie so funny haha don't know what els to say about it got to do20 words so I can leave this haha,1359417600,,136,3.4193548387096775
1404871,3,B000059HAV,"This movie was not as funny as I expected and it didn't even have that much smoking going on!!! I thought they were going to smoke more and hang out more with the girls.  There could have been less running around too.  But it was funny enough to make me want to know what would happen next.
I never even heard of that movie either unil I was watching another older move and saw the preview for Killer Bud.",1239408000,3,405,4.113924050632911
1404872,3,B000059HAV,"Every few years a new pot smoking movie comes out. This one is no different. Dumb jokes, homophobia, and an equally strong addiction to weed and Pachinko, this comedy is just that. Comical. This movie appeals to teenagers and young adults. Corin Nemic and David Faustino do play convincing buddies. If you liked Cheech & Chong's ""Up in Smoke"" or ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" You'll enjoy this movie.",1173398400,,394,4.8088235294117645
1404873,4,B000059HAV,this is way better than dazed and confused or the stoned age so grab your feedbag and enjoy this crazy mixed up no sense of a movie,1091491200,,131,3.888888888888889
1404874,2,B000059HAV,This movie sounded like it would be good. Though it does have a few good moments there are too many moments where David Faustino's character questions his sexuality that just feel out of place in this silly movie. It is worth watching but one watch is all you will need.,1084752000,4,270,4.42
1404875,1,B000059HAV,as someone who enjoys stoner movies not all the pot in the world could make this film any funnier than watching paint dry. I bought this on dvd watched it and sold it to my local used dvd store for six bucks (where it still sits till this day and many more to come). so at least it wasn't a total loss. Don't buy this film!!!!!!!! don't make the same stupid mistake that I did. and if you don't believe me then go ahead don't say I didn't warn you.,1075507200,3,448,3.988888888888889
1404876,5,B000059HAV,"I loved this movie. It was very fresh and full of life. One people need to know when they sit down to watch this movie is it is a comedy, and it shouldn't be taken seriously or compared to Kevin Smith movies or Cheech and Chong. It was very funny and has some excellent performances from the late Robert Stack. Rent it or buy it. If you have a sense of humor you will enjoy it.",1066348800,6,377,3.973684210526316
1404877,2,B000059HAV,mildly amusing but mostly adismal attempt to make a good stoner movie.,1060041600,,70,4.916666666666667
1404878,2,B000059HAV,"Good to see the actor in this doing something besides bud bundy. It was ok, I sat through it, laughed only a couple times, it was kinda dry though. Id rather watch ""jay and silent bob"", or ""the stoned age"" if your looking for something close to this. Maybe even cheech and chong",1058313600,,278,4.264150943396227
1404879,1,B000059HAV,"[...]It came on after ""Jay & Silent Bob,"" which is Shakespeare compared to this brainlessness. The only funny part is when it suggests that Faustino is a huge [...] who gets off on his best friend and children, and the part where the girls discover that the tw have a huge collection of showtunes. Otherwise, the movie is full of huge cliches, and the plot, of course, makes no sense, but it's not really funny even in a stupid way. It's just goddamn stupid, and I don't know why it was made. Why the hell someone would consider actually purchasing this tripe on DVD is beyond me; wouldn't it be funny to see the person who actually buys this? They probably own movies with Rob Schneider, too. Don't let that clown be you.",1053302400,2,722,4.43609022556391

7933305,1,B000059HAV,Junk movie. Those who produced this movie should be ashamed.,1470700800,,60,5.1
7933306,5,B000059HAV,"Killer Bud was David Faustino's finest 90 minutes on film. I love the ""feed bags"" and ""Hot Chicks"". My uncle and I would get together the night before Christmas and watch it four times in a row until we both got sick off  berger cookies...once I fell asleep pre-maturely and I woke up and he was eating a bowl of cereal off my chest....best XMAS EVER!",1447459200,,351,4.318181818181818
7933307,1,B000059HAV,"Really bad movie.  Not even good enough for cable.  Straight to DVD for friends and family of the actors and crew.  Should be posted on YouTube, because no one should ever have to pay for crap like this.",1428364800,,203,4.2894736842105265
7933308,3,B000059HAV,Do you like silly and ridiculous plots with goofball jokes and improbable scenarios? Or maybe you just like David Faustino and Corin Nemec. Then this movie is for you! Not much reefer smoking though. It's mostly a loser buddy flick.,1427673600,,232,4.825
7933309,4,B000059HAV,"I love this movie. From the beginning to the end, it kept me laughing. A stoner movie to be sure.",1369008000,,97,3.9
