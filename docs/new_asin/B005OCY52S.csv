8481197,5,B005OCY52S,"Almost 2 hours of excellent detail on how to fine tune the Glock pistol. I thoroughly enjoyed this learning video and would strongly recommend it to anyone who has an interest in this great pistol. Included in the video is complete stripping, disassembly, reassembly, and fine points about each step. The ways a Glock can be made to shoot even better are well explained and shown in this tutorial DVD. Better get one before they are no longer available.",1490400000,,453,4.746835443037975
8481198,5,B005OCY52S,With the aid of this video (and a lot of practice) I can now completely disassemble my gen 3 and 4 Glocks (slide and frame) and reassemble them in 4 1/2 minutes using only 1 tool. Trigger jobs are a snap. No more trips to the gunsmith. There's nothing I can't now fix. Worth every penny!,1429142400,3,287,4.142857142857143
8481199,5,B005OCY52S,"Until I bought my Glock 19 G4, I had absolutely NO experience with pistols. For those of you in my position, this is an EXCELLENT DVD to help you get to know your Glock. Put out by the American Gunsmithing Institute, it is basically a straightforward class on Glock pistols and typical accessories.

The ""one-on-one"" training covers everything from field-stripping to taking the pistol apart to its smallest components, and everything in between. The instructor shows how to polish parts for better operation, how to properly clean and lubricate, and how to install some of the more popular options, both inside and out. He also shows the pros and cons of some of the more popular aftermarket accessories, as well as how to install each of them.

For me, being able to watch him take apart, and reassemble the Glock was invaluable. The camera angles and close-ups show what you need to see. I sat and watched this on my computer with my Glock in front of me, and took it apart, and looked at it while watching the DVD. It was like sitting across from my own personal instructor.

The version I have was released before the Generation 4 Glocks, so it doesn't specifically cover those, but the differences between Gen 3 and Gen 4 are minor enough that it doesn't really matter. Using what you learn on the video, figuring out how to change the backstraps or magazine release button will come naturally.

It's a little on the expensive side, but if you're new to Glocks and don't know much about pistols except shooting them, this is almost as valuable a tool as your cleaning kit!",1377129600,6,1578,4.66546762589928
8481200,3,B005OCY52S,"The content deserves the 5 stars it has received in other reviews.  However, the quality of the DVD conversion is poor.  It appears to have been transferred from the original VHS tapes without remastering.  The DVD menu even refers to Tape 1 and Tape 2.  The audio varies greatly throughout the disk.  At points, I have to run the volume all the way up to the max, and can still barely hear the presenter.  Then I have to mute the TV and run the volume back down before the next scene starts.  Overall, dated but still good.",1375228800,10,524,4.34020618556701
8481201,5,B005OCY52S,"Well do you?  If you do, this would be a great accessory.  Yes, there are many free videos on youtube that show the same things, but this guy is a certified Glock armorer so you can trust what he says....",1365033600,6,204,4.075
8481202,5,B005OCY52S,"Although not a fan of Glocks, I did purchase this video to see if I can make something of the Glock (G35) I own. Truly impressive insight and tips for any Glock shooter who wants to upgrade their stock Glock to better shooting guns. You will see how to tear down the whole gun for polishing and cleaning all parts. I have to admit my gun now shoots better. It has the famous reliability of a glock but now with the performance of a match gun. The trigger is smoother with better feeling ( no more spongy feeling). The overall performance of the gun has been improved.",1344384000,14,567,4.308411214953271
