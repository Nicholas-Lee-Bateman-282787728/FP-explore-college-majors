The greatest hits portion is pretty similar to the concert she did at the Wynn Las Vegas. 4 underwhelmed sales wise when it came out, but the songs are pretty great as far as I am concerned. There is a deluxe version also available with 7 music videos. Grade: B+",1525046400,,406,4.355263157894737

8491153,5,B0062JD3E8,"I would say that she's definitely the best performer of this generation and this dvd just proves that. It has the same intimate setting as I Am...Yours where she looks back on her career from when she started with Destiny's Child to the present, but somehow I felt more entertained with this dvd than the other one. She looks great on this one as always. I Was Here segment is a great ending to the show. It shows all her greatest accomplishments and memorable events from her amazing career...the 16 grammies, performing/being on stage with legends, being in love, being with Destiny's Child, and the announcement of her first child. An incredible career to look back on. She surely has accomplish a lot of things in her life at the age of 30. I have no doubt in my mind that Beyonce will become a legend 10 years further down in her career. 4 has been a quiet era, but this dvd will remind you why you fell in love with her in the first place.",1341964800,,945,4.375
