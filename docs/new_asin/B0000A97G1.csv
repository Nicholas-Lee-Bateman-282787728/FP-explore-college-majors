7996108,5,B0000A97G1,"This video is wonderful. It's a great description of the events surrounding the Bataan Death March, the years of captivity and the rescue of American, British and Filipino prisoners of war. One of my late father's 31st Bomb Squadron (H) members is featured - numerous survivors speak in this video.",1494892800,,298,4.98

7996111,5,B0000A97G1,"I purchased it new for about 5 bucks including shipping.  The narration is informative and well done.  It spans the full length of the Bataan incident (fighting, surrender, death march, captivity experiences, rescue, homecoming).  They did a good job of compiling footage about the Bataan Rescue, including veteran interviews.  They also interviewed Filipino guerrilla fighters.

Being only an hour long, there are no ""slow parts""...and there is no ""filler"" footage here, which is good. I had seen the movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Great-Raid/dp/B004U7MQWY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Great Raid</a>&nbsp;in the past.  The movie appears fairly accurate in comparison to the PBS documentary.",1429833600,,748,6.65979381443299
7996112,2,B0000A97G1,"The story is told as a celebration of the courage and skill of the American soldiers who freed hundreds of brutalized American POWs. The footage is dramatic, the heroes and their reminiscences profoundly moving.

But it was the courageous Filipino guerillas -- whose stealthy reconnaissance, knowledge of the land and of the brutality of the Japanese -- who made the American rescue not only possible, but massively successful. These young men, thousands of whom died in defense of Americans here and elsewhere during the war, should be honored with so much more than the minuscule mention they receive in this film.",1333756800,9,616,5.099009900990099
7996113,5,B0000A97G1,"I really like this one.

It's about an hour long, and was part of the ""American Experience"" series on PBS.

I grade the quality of the documentary as an ""A"", and I give the story and content the same grade.

Luckily, someone went to work on this one while many of the participants were still alive.  There are a lot of on-camera comments by actual participants.

In addition, a lot of re-enactors participated, which really makes the story come alive visually.

To me it's a very moving story.  For me the high point is the moment when one of the participants is recounting the moment when US troops burst into the camp.

""You're a Yank?""

And he said, ""You're damn right I am, and we come to get ya.""

For some reason, when you look this title up on Amazon they also list one (with the same DVD cover) that lists David Ogden Stiers as a narrator.

I've checked out Stiers' resume on IMDB.  I found no mention of his involvement with a project of this title.

The one I have is narrated by Scott Glenn.  (I suspect there actually is no other version.)

The only warning I would give is that it might be upsetting to children.  There is a very non-graphic re-enactment of the Palawan massacre, during which the Japanese poured gasoline on American POWs and set them on fire.  And there are descriptions of incidents which occurred during the Bataan Death March which could be nightmarish for children (and for others who can't handle this type of material).",1287446400,2,1471,4.425373134328358
7996114,4,B0000A97G1,"This documentary from PBS in the ""American Experience"" series is very well done. The story is set in World War II in the Philippines and follows the stories of American soldiers trapped in the Philippines. The soldiers are subjected to brutal treatment after surrender to the Japanese. The Bataan death march follows, and they spend years at a prison camp in Cabanatuan. Army rangers come in for the rescue.

It's a good patriotic story that is very interesting. It's not too long (about 50 minutes) and you will probably enjoy seeing the footage, interviews with survivors and learning a little bit of history. My only beef with the movie is that they kept butchering the pronunciation of places in the Philippines. To the untrained ear it won't make a difference, but if you have heard the names pronounced correctly previously, it is a little jarring. Kind of like hearing Houston pronounced ""Hows-town"". Highly recommended.",1216944000,2,927,5.01948051948052
7996115,4,B0000A97G1,"This is a good documentary on an amazing rescue at the end of WWII.  Not much is known of this event other than the initial ""death march"".  It is quite astounding to learn that the Japanese had over 17,000 U.S. prisoners in the PI.  Also, the atrocities are terrible.  The commentary from the survivors, as well as the rescuers makes this a very good program with a personal feel.  I would have liked to have seen more on scene footage and original reel footage, instead of re-enactment.  All in all, 4 stars and a keeper for any WWII/military history buff.  It's always great to learn the little-known facts of any event.",1120521600,5,622,4.54954954954955
7996116,5,B0000A97G1,"This American Experience episode puts faces to all the heroes involved in the liberation of the Cabanatuan POW Camp. It is based on Hampton Sides' excellent account, ""Ghost Soldiers"", and includes an extensive interview with Sides, along with a number of Rangers and POWS who were featured in the book. There are many newsreels, captured Japanese POW camp footage, and a compelling re-enactment of the rescue provided. Some of the actual footage shot by Signal Corps staff who accompanied the Ranger and Scout units on their mission is also included. Two making-of featurettes that last about 10 minutes each, a timeline, and information/links on the extensive web pages for this PBS program are the extent of the special features, but enjoyable nonetheless.

This program is only 60 minutes long and provides just a basic outline of the entire POW rescue story. For example, very little in the program is devoted to the heroic actions of numerous Filipino guerrillas and civilians involved in this rescue, although their contributions were incredibly significant. For those intrigued and inspired by what they see in this program, you are encouraged to read the book ""Ghost Soldiers"", which provides far more detail and a much better depiction of this dramatic event. Until Ghost Soldiers-the motion picture is released, this is an excellent companion DVD to the actual book. ""Saving Private Ryan"" cannot hold a candle to this true story.",1119830400,8,1439,5.175965665236052
7996117,5,B0000A97G1,"My father was one of the men rescued by the rangers from the prison camp. He passed away 14 years ago without revealing to us all that he endured during his imprisonment and the Death March. Reading Ghost Soldiers enlightened me and caused me to search for all I could find on Bataan and his experiences. It was by chance (or divine intervention) that I came across Bataan Rescue when it showed on PBS. I grabbed a tape, popped it in and sat down to watch. It was an amazing and emotional experience for me to see actual footage from the rescue. The next evening I replayed it for my husband to watch. As we were watching he remarked that he kept looking for my father in the footage. I replied that I too was hoping for a glimpse. In the next few moments I thought I saw him! Was it just wishful thinking? We played it over and over and then in slow motion and sure enough it was just a few moments of footage of my father walking with other men after being rescued. It truly was like seeing a ghost. I am so thankful that this documentary was made. This has been a forgotten chapter of WWII. The rangers who rescued all the prisoners are true heroes in my eyes. My father who endured all the suffering for years and then came home and endured the many years of memories is my biggest hero. I wish I had asked him more about his experiences when he was alive but am grateful to have this DVD and other materials to help memorialize his sacrfice forever.",1110844800,11,1454,4.252707581227437
