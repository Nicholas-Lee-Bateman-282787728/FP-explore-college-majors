382827,5,6301964144,"The classic novel by Tolstoy is something more than a tale of sin and retribution, old style.  Each character, while being completely individual, is just as completely a product of class and time and envirnment. The word ""doomed"" is used in the dialogue, and though as a word, under the circumstances, it echoes with suggestions of melodrama and mock-heroics, it has this accuracy in it, that it suggests the fatal and inescapable power with which tradition, position and point of view worked upon the Russian aristocracy of the period.  With a firm foundation to stand on, Garbo portrays Anna with rare depth and beauty, as a gentlewoman of charm and poise, radiating a calm and enchanting loveliness, in who a great passion awakes, stirring up profound emotions and sufferings. She does it so quietly and subtly that you never catch her in the act of working to create an effect. It is as natural and true as if you were being permitted to eavesdrop on a woman in moments of most complete unselfconsciousness, so intimately herself that the make-up box seems a million miles away. This creation is the soul of the picture, and gives it its whole unity and meaning. Whether or not you are fascinated by Fredric March, Garbo makes you believe that he fascinated Anna, and on that belief the entire structure of the drama depends. Other actors fill the scene with varying effect, among whom Basil Rathbone, Phoebe Foster, and Constance Collier - help substantially in building the setting in which Anna's love was so foreordained to tragedy.",1005523200,7,1540,4.874045801526718
382828,5,6301964144,"Greta Garbo stars as Leo Tolstoy's tragic heroine in this 1935 film directed by Clarence Brown and produced by David O. Selznick.  In 19th-Century Russia Anna is married to a wealthy government man, Karenin (Basil Rathbone), and bears him a son, Sergei (Freddie Bartholomew).  When Anna goes to visit her brother, Stiva (Reginald Owen), to try and save his marriage after his numerous affairs, she meets and falls in love with Count Vronsky (Fredric March).  Anna returns home and asks Karenin for a divorce, but he refuses and warns that if she continues her affair with Vronsky she will lose her son.  But Anna still decides to run away with Vronsky to Venice, and for a while they are happy together.  Then Vronsky wants to return to the army.
This film provides one of Garbo's finest performances in the type of role that made her famous, namely a tragic beautiful woman whose life is ruined by ruthless men.  In fact, she won the New York Film Critics Cirlce Award for Best Actress.  But in the end Anna has given up her son and Vronsky refuses to give up going to war, which is why we get the tragic ending.  ""Anna Karenina"" was a remake of Garbo's silent film ""Love,"" which she made in 1927 with John Gilbert, but that film is not available on video otherwise you would have a perfect Garbo double-bill with the two films.  Certainly March is a much better actor than Gilbert, but Garbo is the star of this one.  Despite the meticulous costumes and settings representing St. Petersburg, she steals the show in this film.  I think there is something to be said for using great literature, which provides greater depth than you get with most of her romantic vehicles.  ""Anna Karenina"" was remade again in 1948 with Vivien Leigh.",996883200,4,1733,4.645901639344262

Having been to Russia and recently read Anna Karenina, I also liked the respect given to the story and the time period.  Granted, the movie is only 1.5 hrs in length, but they did cut out the 'boring' parts and  stuck mostly with the main plot.  Loved that a Russian choir was utilized to sing the traditionally a capella songs and church service.  Interesting touches showing the customs of the military and well-to-do of the time.

Well played.",1425945600,4,245,4.72093023255814
382856,4,6301964144,"Beautiful production of Tolstoy's tale.  Garbo is wonderful as the tortured, oftentimes confused, Anna.  Basil Rathbone is equally great as the cold and distant husband, embarrassed by his wife's very public indiscretions.  Vronsky, Anna's paramour, played by Frederick March, simply misses the mark.  We learn from the sarcastic mouth of Anna's husband that Vronsky looks like Anna's son.  Frederick March, however, is a decidedly middle-aged man perhaps 15 years older than Anna.  My suspension of disbelief never survived this clear-cut error.

Basil Rathbone, on the other hand, is terrific as the supposedly heartless, cynical husband.  He complains to Anna that he is shamed by her behavior and that, though he cares nothing little about it, she is damaging his career.  Careful reading of Rathbone's body language gives the lie to his supposed lack of feeling.  He is cut as deeply as a man can be but because expression of emotion is de classe', he behaves as if he were created from cold marble.  Anna doesn't--and probably can't--recognize this and clings to her desperate love for the immature rake, Vronsky.  Systematically she throws everything she has away.",1420934400,,1171,5.236559139784946
382857,5,6301964144,Greta Garbo is outstanding far better than Keira Knightly in a new version. This black and white film is a great classic and the portrayal by Garbo of Anna Karenina is mature and tragic as the story was written. The new version by Knightly portrays Anna as reckless and a shallow socialite. Garbo plays Anna as a mature woman in love who happen to make a poor choice at a turning point in her life. The Garbo film is far superior in reflecting the novel.,1417824000,3,454,4.352941176470588
382858,5,6301964144,"This is the tragic story of a married woman, Anna Karenina who falls in love with Count Vronsky, and follows her heart despite her husband's refusal to grant a divorce. Both Anna and Vronksy face a great deal of social repercussions. This is further complicated by her longing to see her son still living with husband.  In this star-studded film, Greta Garbo offers an outstanding performance in the lead category as Anna Karenina in displaying her emotions. Once, director Clarence Brown stated that Garbo does not need gestures to convey happiness, despair, hope, joy or tragedy; she registers her feelings by radiating her thoughts to you. I became a believer of his observation after watching this movie. This film is strongly supported by the work of Fredric March, Maureen O'Sullivan, May Robson and Basil Rathbone.

According to author of the story, Tolstoy, the genesis of Anna Karenina was derived from two specific events; a story about a woman who deserts her husband for another man, based, in part, on the life of his sister Marya, and a newspaper story about the mistress of one of Tolstoy's neighbors, after being abandoned by her lover, hurls herself under a train. His epic story covered in 976 pages is masterfully condensed by the screen writer Salka Viertel, a close confidante of Greta Garbo. The movie is brilliantly directed by Clarence Brown, one of the proud possessions of MGM studios who worked with many of the industry's most illustrious performers. Anna Karenina is a human story and emerges as the masterpiece of man's endless struggle to make sense of life while coming to terms with reality of material world where everyone wants nothing less than happiness.",1405728000,,1691,4.99290780141844

Tolstoy used his writing talent to warn this world that is heading for the abyss. Sexual sin is not only against God but against the body and soul of those who chose to participate in it. I fault her lover for going after a married woman! What a rotten creek F. March played! The child especially suffered! Look at her son. His love for his mother forever distorted, warped and lost and his own life no doubt ruined. How so like our world today thanks in a large part to movies made in LA/NYC. Divorce and adultery are running wild. I am reading the book but now may not finish it after seeing this short film with. Garbo did a great job. Her facial features did more to tell her story so words were hardly needed. I could not watch her throw herself into the wheels of the train as suicide is NEVER the answer.

382890,4,6301964144,This movie reflects the weaknesses and failures of human nature is such a sad way.  No one wins in this one.

382891,3,6301964144,"Greta Gabo has infectious energy on screen which allows the audience to feel her warmth. You can feel Anna's love for her little boy and it makes you feel sorry that she's stuck with such a snob of a husband. Garbo is like a wind, we can see her changes subtly, but they come in strong and flighty bits.

The problem I had with the film is that it seemed to spend time on things I felt were not as important in the film, or to the drama of the love story. Certain scenes with the men talking in the bath house, or drinking, I guess served to show the comradery or the kind of toughness Anna fell in love with, but it just made the film feel spaced out without a great reason. And, I appreciated the love Garbo painted Anna's son, but in the end, her victimhood was not quite delivered. It was difficult to sympathize with either of the lovers, and particularly with her lover. He turned merely into a man who wanted something when he wanted it, but there was not much passion or warmth in his eyes.

The film felt long, then the love affair too abrupt; it was difficult to see what they really loved about each other.

I just saw the film version with Vivien Leigh, and found this story much more carefully delivered. Her lover was full of life, and more genuine. Leigh's acting was much more intricate, and the settings were beautiful.",1355961600,3,1336,4.314741035856573

Greta Garbo is fabulous and fabulously tragic (in her Adrian wardrobe) as Anya; Fredric March is great as Vronsky. And the supporting cast, beginning with the masterful Basil Rathbone as Anya's cold and coldly rational husband, ""Karenin"", Reginald Owen, Reginald Denny, Maureen O'Sullivan, Freddie Barthlomew, May Robson, Constance Collier, as well as sets, costumes and music all combine to thrust you into a 19th century world that is vibrant with convention, conventional morality, clear gendered roles (and a little hypocrisy about marital fidelity), talk of war (Serbo-Turkish War which anticipates World War I if we read the ""talk"" closely), and, of course, forbidden love and its consequences.  An absolute treat.",1344643200,,857,5.584615384615384
382895,5,6301964144,"Note: I just saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.

Screen legend Greta Garbo stars in a sound version of the classic love story by Count Leo Tolstoy. Frederic March, Basil Rathbone, Freddie Batholemew and Maureen O'Sullivan co-star in one of the finest adaptations of what is hailed as one of the greatest novels ever written. Basil Rathbone, in my opinion, is so far the best Karenin I have seen so far. Greta Garbo is, of course, luminous as the doomed Anna. Freddie Bartholemew is really cute as Sergei (though I think the name of Anna's son is different in the novel; I could be wrong. Unfortunately, Maureen O'Sullivan's role of Kitty is sorely underwritten here (and would suffer the same fate in the 1948 screen version). In addition to this grand adaptation, I also highly recommend the 1997 version starring Sophie Marceau, Sean Bean, James Fox, Mia Kirshner and Alfred Molina as Levin. The television miniseries made in the 1970's is okay. The 1935 and 1997 versions of Leo Tolstoy's epic love story are well worth viewing. (I have not yet viewed the 1985 television version starring Christopher Reeve and Jacqueline Bisset).

What sets MGM's 1935 version apart and places it above the others is Basil Rathbone's portrayal of Karenin.  It is, after all, Karenin, and not Vronsky, who establishes the parameters which define Anna.  It is Karenin who forces the romance to become a tragedy.  And it is Basil Rathbone, a career supporting actor who would mature like cheese when he began starring in Sherlock Holmes movies, who actually makes Karenin someone, something more than a stock character.  Yes, Greta Garbo and the others are good, but it's Basil Rathbone who makes this a movie you really must see.",1333929600,2,680,4.728813559322034
382897,4,6301964144,"We recently ran a  ""Greta Garbo Weekend"" festival at the library where I work.  While I don't pretend to be an expert, I was familiar with most of the films  screened over the course of those three days. One that I had somehow managed to miss all these years was the 1935 version of ANNA KARENINA.  Yes, I'dread that it's considered by many to be the best of the various screen adaptations,and at least in theory, it seemed to be an ideal vehicle for  the enigmatic, world weary but glamorous Garbo.

But you can be genuinely curious about a film and still have some qualms about it. Hollywood--in whatever era--does not always do well by literary classics.  Shoehorning an 800 page novel into less than two hours seems risky at best. So much has to be streamlined, if not completely excised.

Admirers of any adapted film's source novel can usually rattle off dozens of ways in which their beloved work was compromised  (or downright mangled) in its translation to the big screen.

Initially,  I was actually a bit startled to see that this particular version of the Tolstoy classic didn't even last two hours:  it clocks in at just over 90 minutes.  That wasn't all that unusual for films of that era,  but in this case,  a longer version might have been deemed warranted.

Oddly enough, this relatively abbreviated  film not only works,  but it's actually seems to be just right.  One is aware that certain short cuts are being taken along the way, as well as  certain liberties with characterization and with the plot itself.  But this version of ANNA KARENINA does work in strictly cinematic terms: well enough, in fact, that it could inspire viewers familiar with the novel to  re-read it--and could just as well inspire someone unfamiliar with the work to finally pick it up.

It shouldn't be surprising that the focus of film version is Anna's story. The novel's  Kitty/Levin subplot is only given the shortest of shrifts.  This particular artistic decision makes good sense in cinematic terms. There is enough of their story  in the film to serve as sharp contrast to Anna's own fate.  After initial hesitancy on Kitty's part,  she and Levin marry, start a family  and  readily embrace social convention--in stark contrast to Anna and Vronsky's  sacrificing social standing and prestige on the altar of their passion.

Similarly,  we get just enough of a glimpse of the amorous misadventures of  Anna's brother Stiva to understand how ""double "" the standards of the day truly were.

Yes, the novel fleshes it all out more,  but director Clarence Brown (a celebrated filmmaker of his era, who is largely--and shamefully--forgotten today)  and his fleet of writers succeeded in making a film that evoked its source work,  while fully understanding the strengths and limitations of cinematic narrative.

And kudos to cinematographer William H. Daniels as well. Daniels works magic throughout, but particularly in the early scenes of the ball at which Stiva and Vronsky are first introduced.  Ingenious tracking shots of the banquet table,  successfully convey the opulence and decadence of the Russian aristocracy.

Daniels worked on a number of  Garbo films (including ANNA CHRISTIE,  GRAND HOTEL,  SUSAN LENOX and NINOTCHKA), and while he modestly denied actually creating the ""Garbo face,""  it is also true that you could frame and exhibit any number of stills from this film or any of the other aforementioned classics and you'd have a truly remarkable exhibit.

Garbo is supported by an excellent cast.  Fredric March makes for a dashing Vronsky--but is also capable of suggesting his character's many inner conflicts.  Basil Rathbone is equally good at suggesting Alexei Karenin's complexities.  The character of Anna's bureaucrat husband could have been little more than caricature.  Rathbone gives us substantially more than that.

I mentioned director Clarence Brown above,  as a director whose work is undeservedly neglected today.  In fact,  he shares with Alfred Hitchcock the somewhat dubious distinction of receiving the most (six) Academy Award nominations for directing without a single win.

Hitchcock of course, is now widely acknowledged now as one of the greats of Hollywood's classic era.  His lack of an Oscar has actually become a kind of perverse badge of honor.  It's possible--if not likely--that Brown may be subject to a similar re-evaluation at some point.  His work on this film (as well as ANNA CHRISTIE,  NATIONAL VELVET , THE YEARLING and others) suggest s that that time may be past due.",1329696000,5,4527,5.005376344086022
382898,5,6301964144,"... but Greta Garbo is my Goddess of Glamour in saeculum saeculorum, and gets my five stars just for the expressiveness of her face in Anna's various moods of ennui, ecstasy, adoration of her son, detestation of her husband, desperation at her shallow vainglorious lover Vronsky. Those expressive close-up need to be exquisite because most of the rest of this film is perfunctory Hollywood hack work. Oh, let's give Basil Rathbone a bone for his craftsmanly performance as the cold husband Karenin. On the debit side, here's a kick in the shins for Frederick March, whose performance as Count Vronsky lacks any subtlety or thespian skill.

The first ten minutes of this film do belong, at least partially, to Leo Tolstoy... to the novel Anna Karenina. Of course, if the rest of the script had been as attentive to Tolstoy, the film would have been six hours long instead of ninety minutes. Half or more of the novel is about Levin -- his soul-searching for a creditable way of life in his Russia -- but in the film Levin is a walk-on, and his eventual marriage to Kitty just an excuse to film a picturesque Orthodox wedding. This script excludes everything from the novel except the 'romance' of Anna and Vronsky. Even that gets more and more clipped and cursory as the ninety minutes tick by. The final scenes, including Anna's suicide, are no better than a Cliff Notes precis of the death of a romance.

If anything saves this film as an entertainment, it's the sophistication of black-and-white. The sets and costumes have the elegance of 1935 about them, when Hollywood was the Holy Land of dreams for Depression-stricken America. How, I have to wonder, did Hollywood in later decades lose all traces of that sophistication?",1316390400,,1728,4.814814814814815

I was shocked to find this movie completely lacking in passion, nearly devoid of motivation, without adequate storyline, and completely miscast: a totally detached, arch Garbo with acting more appropriate to the Marschallin in der Rosenkavalier than passionate Anna, a completely sexless March botching Count Vronsky, who should be the most dashing man in Russia with March looking more like Hitler on a good day. Zilch charisma between Garbo and March whatsoever. Ever since viewing this, I've been walking around parodying Garbo by pretending to speak her faux Russian accent through that clenched-teeth smile.

You can see that she thinks it's ironic that it's okay for her brother to cheat on his wife, and the world accepts it, but it's not okay for her, a woman. The film is superficial, there is no ""great love"" portrayed, it seems that Anna merely ran away with Vronsky because he bugged her to, and she's a very weak-minded woman. She loves her son so much, why did she leave him? For boring Vronsky? He's a count in the regiment, and what they do there is, have horse races....very important. Also get drunk, and crawl over each other underneath a table. And what does he love about Anna so much that he can't live without her? That's she's married and hard to get?

382929,3,6301964144,"""Anna Karenina"" is a 1935 film based on a Leon Tolstoy novel. Tolstoy published the novel in serialized form from 1873 to 1877, and it's said to be a rendering of the true life story of Maria Hartung, the eldest daughter of Russian poet Alexander Pushkin. Many critics consider the 800+ page novel one of the top 10 ever written.

The novel first appeared in operas and plays beginning in the early 1900s. The first film adaptation was ""Love"", a 1927 silent film starring Greta Garbo and John Gilbert. Garbo had been in nearly 20 silent films, starting as early as 1920. Her best known silent film prior to ""Love"" was ""Flesh and the Devil"" (1926) which was directed by Clarence Brown.  She was nominated 3 times for an Oscar (""Anna Christie"", ""Camille"", and ""Ninotchka"") but never won. She is listed #5 on the AFI's list of Greatest Actresses.

The great Frederic March co-stars as Garbo's lover. March won an Oscar for ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" (1931) and ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" (1946), and earned three more nominations. He won the Golden Globe for ""Death of a Salesman"" (1951) and earned two more nominations. He won two Tonys (""Years Ago"" and ""Long Days Journey Into Night""). He appeared in more than 50 films between 1921 and 1973. Personally I think his best performance was as Matthew Brady in ""Inherit the Wind"" (1960). He claimed he wasn't ""overwhelmed"" by Garbo's beauty and thought that ""women were more attracted to her than men."" March does an excellent job min this film. He looks like a younger brother to John Barrymore.

Suave Basil Rathbone plays Garbo's husband. No one has ever been better at playing the villain or the rouge than Rathbone. His performances in ""David Copperfield"" (1935), ""Captain Blood"" (1935), ""A Tale of Two Cities"" (1935), ""Robin Hood"" (1938), ""Tower of London"" (1939), and ""The Mark of Zorro"" (1940) are classic. He was twice nominated for an Oscar (""Romeo and Juliet"" and ""If I Were King""). He's probably best remembered as the heroic Sherlock Holmes in the 14 films he made between 1939 and 1946. Rathbone gives a sympathetic performance as Garbo's cuckolded husband.

The beautiful Maureen O'Sullivan is best remembered as Tarzan's Jane. She played Jane 6 times between 1932 and 1942, but she played many other roles during that time, including ""Tugboat Annie"" (1933), ""The Thin Man"" (1934), ""Cardinal Richelieu"" (1935), ""A Day at the Races"" (1937), ""A Yank at Oxford"" (1938), and ""Pride and Prejudice"" (1940). She slowed down in the 40s to devote time to her husband and 7 children, one of whom is the actress Mia Farrow. O'Sullivan plays Garbo's sister and does a sweet job in the little time she has on screen.

Freddie Bartholomew plays Garbo's son. Freddie was one of the most famous child actors of the 1930s, appearing in ""David Copperfield"" (1935), ""Little Lord Fauntleroy"" (1`936), ""Captains Courageous"" (1937) and ""Kidnapped"" (1938). Freddie gives his usual endearing performance.

Reginald Owen plays Prince Stiva, Garbo's brother.  Owen was a distinguished actor who appeared in over 100 films including playing Scrooge in ""A Christmas Carol"" (1938), Admiral Boom in  ""Mary Poppins"" (1964) and General Teagler in ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" (1972). He had the distinction of playing both Sherlock Holmes (""A study in Scarlet"") and Dr. Watson (""Sherlock Holmes"") and played King Louis XV in 3 different films. Own does his usual credible job.

Clarence Brown directs. Brown was a well known silent film director (""Last of the Mohicans"", ""Flesh and the Devil""). He was nominated for an Oscar 5 times (""Anna Christie"", ""A Free Soul"", ""The Human Comedy"", ""National Velvet"", and ""The Yearling"") but never won. His films earned 38 Oscar nominations and 9 wins, but never for Director. This was his third film with Garbo and they would work together on three more films. He loved working with actresses, and also worked with Joan Crawford 6 times.  The film tends to drag at times, and at other times the pacing is uneven. Scenes appear that are hours and then months apart, with no apparent rationale.

Williams Daniels is the cinematographer. Garbo insisted he shoot all her films, which he did, except for 2 (""Conquest"", ""Two-faced Woman"") which turned out to be flops at the box office. When not working with Garbo, Daniels was a favorite of Erich von Stroheim, who was Garbo's favorite director (even though she made 6 films with Brown). Daniels lensed more than 150 films. He was nominated 3 times (""Anna Christie"", ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"", ""How the West was Won"") and won once (""Naked City"" in 1948). Daniels' photography is exceptional. It's one of the best parts of the film.

David Selznick produced for MGM. Selznick is best remembered for ""Gone with the Wind"" (1939), but he was nominated for 8 other Oscars for films as diverse as ""Viva Villa"" (1934), ""David Copperfield"" (1935), ""A Tale of Two Cities"" (1936), ""A Star is Born"" (1937), ""Rebecca"" (1940) and ""Spellbound"" (1945). Beyond these, he was also involved in one capacity or another in such classics as ""A Farewell to Arms"" (1957) and ""The Third Man"" (1949) among the nearly 90 films he produced. The production values in this film are excellent. One can feel the opulence.

Garbo won Best Actress from the New York Film Critics and Brown won Best Foreign Film at the Venice Film festival. There were no Oscar nominations. The NY Times called the film ""ably produced and comparatively mature"" and said that ""Basil Rathbone is excellent as the husband and there are good performances by Reginald Owen, O'Sullivan and Phoebe Foster.""

The film is certainly worth viewing for the photography, the lavish settings, and the generally good acting. I think Garbo's performance is the weakest, and that's a problem when she is in almost every scene, but everyone else does an exceptional job.",1276387200,2,5810,4.908256880733945
382930,4,6301964144,"No one expects a film to accurately represent a Tolstoy novel, so it's best just to take it on its own merits, and enjoy it.  However it really should have been longer than it was.  That would have made the romance between Anna and Vronsky more believable as well as the eventual demise of their passion.  Here it all happens so quickly that we almost don't get enough time to fully engage with the characters.

Garbo makes it all worthwhile, though.  She is stunningly magnificent here -- I think more beautiful than in many of her other films.  Besides her very lovely physical beauty, her charm and naturalness, especially in the early scenes with her family, are winning.  No wonder Vronksy fell in love with her at first sight.

Casting Frederich March as Vronsky seems like a mistake to me, but perhaps he was considered a heart-throb at the time.  To my eyes, he is stiff, a bit pudgy and just not very attractive.  Perhaps if more time had been given to the  buildup of the romance we might have seen what Anna saw in him, but here we just have to take it on faith.  Basil Rathbone, as the passionless husband, actually stirred up more excitement, although in a negative way.  His scene with their son, Sergei, (Freddie Bartholomew) was quite moving.

I loved the opening scene of the fantastic banquet and the drinking contest, also the ball, (the Mazurka was wonderful), and the opera was a hoot!  The scenes at the train station, in the snow, are appropriately chilling.  So much drama has happened on European trains in those wonderful old stations.  The settings and costumes are all splendid.

I think that, for me, the enjoyment of the film rests in the wonderful sets and the sight of the magnificent Garbo.  We all know the story, so it was just a matter of seeing it unfold....here, rather abruptly.",1249257600,2,1817,4.621875
382931,5,6301964144,Another Greta Garbo great! Fredrick March and Freddie Bartholomew are equally as great. Greta Garbo plays doomed Anna Karenina. Bored with her cold husband she turns her attention to Count Vronsky she eventually runs away with him. Her powerful husband makes her choose between her lover and her child. Her choice dooms her in the end.,1195948800,,335,5.0
382932,2,6301964144,"In the Garbo canon, this film surely must rate as the biggest missed opportunity of her career. All the ingredients should have contributed to a memorable film but after a good start, it just doesn't happen.

Maybe it is the short running time. A sweeping novel has been understandably truncated but Anna's relationship with Vronsky is not sufficiently developed so their passion is unconvincing. A number of scenes don't lead anywhere e.g. Kitty's marriage scene.

Maybe it's the cast. Basil Rathbone as her husband rises to Garbo's level, superbly generating some sympathy within a stern and cold character and Reginald Owen is excellent as her brother. Freddie Bartholomew is awful with his acting school diction and delivery. Fredric March starts well, dashing and magnetic, but becomes mechanical and unconvincing as the film develops. Maureen O'Sullivan, no one's idea of a Russian or Garbo's sister, overacts in a simpering and cloying manner.

Maybe it's the script and direction. The first 20 minutes are by far the best with a terrific scene when March and his colleagues drink and eat and as the film moves to the memorable introduction of Garbo through the steam of a train and shows her empathy and warmth as she deals with her errant brother. From there, it is a gradual downhill slide plodding along lugubriously and generating little passion. It is as if everyone ran out of interest, even Garbo.

Maybe it was the censorship which caused so many of these problems. Anna Karenina is an adulteress so it is likely that any scenes of real passion would have been curtailed.

The print of the film has not been restored and is dirty with white lines appearing often. At least one scene is missing as noted by another reviewer and there are no extras except the original trailer. Unless the film is purchased as part of one of the Garbo collections, it is not good value.",1182988800,10,1883,4.871875

382934,3,6301964144,"As I plow my way through this Great Garbo Signature Collection a few things are becoming somewhat apparent. One, as Garbo got older she grew into her beauty and out of that ghostly look she had in his early films. And two, she is a movie star not a serious actress. As a result this adaptation of ""Anna Karenina"" is much more a Garbo vehicle than a serious take on a serious piece of Russian literature. Like most of her film entrances this one is marked by an extreme close up, lighting that is way too bright, and actual fanfare that today would just seem silly. The main problem I had was that it was just not very literary. The vocab is at a second grade reading level and the ideas are bold and unambiguous. The book and even the movie are old old old so I will forgive the story for feeling familiar, and you have to appreciate the message they are trying to spread. Here we have Anna, who fought for love, but was crushed under an avalanche of honor and careers, and who died for the sins of the men in her life.

The first 30 minutes of the film are a waste (sorry, sacrifice) as we visit an upscale party where Anna meets Count Vronsky (Fredric March). We get so much dancing and costuming that I started having flashbacks to ""Marie Antoinette"". From there the film turns its attention to the role of adultery and the repressive nature of marriage. Anna and Vronsky are besotted, but Anna is married to Karenin, a tough military type who marches around all day scolding her for spoiling their (obnoxious) son.  He doesn't really care if she loves him or not, just so long as she stays with him so that they can keep up appearances.  She eventually caves to passion and he resorts to the old ""Your mother is dead,"" trick to explain her absence to their son. The film takes a stand against all things that are rotten about our dealings with relationships. Marriage is presented as an evil force that is thrust upon us to quash free love, free sex, and freedom. The rules are blasted for being arbitrary and the fact that sometimes there is a better option out there than marriage is stated. Those who sit around all day imploring others to focus on their careers are dismissed as stuffy bougie folk with nothing better to do. Of course there is a lot of Hollywood hokum mixed in here, what with the rousing tale of how you should crawl out from under your oppressors boot and find true happiness, but still this movie rocks philosophically.

Soon after running off together Anna and Vronsky realize that there is a difference between love making and love maintaining. Her son beckons her and the Serbian/Turkish War beckons him. These desires dominate their lives until the film moves towards a decent climax and the anti-climatic resolution. I would also like to say that in light of the Barbaro tragedy the horse racing scene is especially tough to watch. Not so much for the image of a horse being euthanized, but for those that involved real horses taking truly scary tumbles. This film may depict old school Russia but the message is still relevant. We are all too eager to slap on the shackles of jobs and relationships just so that we can bemoan the ball and chain. And the sooner we realize that our government is squarely on the side of Karenin, the better off we will be. **3/4",1172880000,3,3294,4.485
382935,3,6301964144,"First off, let us concede that neither the 1935 Greta Garbo ""Anna Karenina"" nor the 1948 Vivian Leigh version comes close to capturing the complexities of Tolstoy's masterpiece. Most significantly, Konstantin Levin and Kitty's relationship, and more particularly, Levin's protracted personal and metaphysical development, are dropped entirely, both screenplays preferring to treat the story as an adulterous romantic triangle with snowflakes instead of palm trees.

That said, what we are left with in both films are masterpieces of film craftsmanship, where the triple triumphs of cinematography, art direction, and costume design are the real stars.

Which is not in any way to lessen the contributions of the cast, who in both instances, make the best of what they have to work with.

Garbo enchants in many of her individual scenes, particularly with Freddy Bartholomew and Maureen O'Sullivan, (as Kitty). Who can forget her advising Kitty to seize her fleeting youth, with its promise of a dream prince to emerge from the blue haze of the mountain top. Equally impressive, is her muted aversion to Alexei Karenin, (Basil Rathbone).

But she fails in her depiction of a fatal love for Count Vronsky (Frederic March). Garbo, with her solemn, majestic and singular self possession--her ""Queen Christina"" like cerebral detachment, is simply too thoughtful, too deliberate, to in any way convey Tolstoy's impulsive, febrile and thoughtless anti-heroine.

True, she had forsaken all for John Gilbert in ""Christina,"" but that decision was the result of deep and thorough soul searching, and explained with the eloquence of Solomon to her courtiers. In ""Camille"" she is by profession a lover, and so her ultimate renunciation of Armand, reveals the true depth of her character. But one cannot conceive of her destroying the lives of others to satisfy a whimsical infatuation.

And this is where Miss Leigh's Anna trumps Garbo, for Miss Leigh does successfully transmit Anna's neurasthenic and utterly reckless collapse at the feet of the dashing Count. She seems blown by forces much stronger than she--a daffodil in a windstorm, and light years from Garbo's deep Scandanavian imperturbability.

Given the alleged similarities between Miss Leigh and Anna's disposition, perhaps this is life imitating art. In any case, it is why she makes a truer Anna, and why the role serves as a warm up for Blanche Dubois...

She is also abetted in her interpretation, by the genuinely eerie, recurring, nightmare sequence--with the Charon like, white bearded old man, forever dogging her as he chinks away at the ice. An ill omen indeed ! And Miss Leigh conveys the desperation of her impending doom in every gesture and nuance.

Then too Keiron Moore, (despite being an inferior actor to Frederic March) is much more dashing and handsome as Vronsky--a fact which, at least in terms of audience sympathy, helps explain the attraction.

Strangely, Mr. March who had been so visually appealing as Dr. Jeckyll, just a few years earlier, photographs very poorly in the Garbo version, and is not helped by a buzz haircut.

And as superb as Cedric Gibbons sets and Adrian's costumes are as a backdrop for Garbo, we feel Mr. Andrejew's art direction and Cecil Beaton's designs get the nod here as well, if only perhaps in their European origin, and the deep, appropriately moody nineteenth century shadows with which they are lit and photographed.

However, as visually sumptuous cinematic recreations of a vanished aristocratic world--each version has much to savor, and should be taken in tandem.",1171670400,5,3576,5.210801393728223
382936,3,6301964144,"+++++

This movie is based on the very long 1877 Russian novel ""Anna Karenina"" by Count Leo Tolstoy (1828 to 1910).

The thick novel is really two novels: a powerful drama of a woman trapped in a loveless marriage seeking love and happiness and Tolstoy's spiritual confessions of his lifelong meditations on birth, death, and God.

This movie focuses out of necessity for time constraints on the first aspect mentioned above.

Thus this movie is about Anna Karenina (Greta Garbo), a woman who has beauty, social position, wealth, a husband (Basil Rathbone), and a son (Freddie Bartholomew) who adores her but her existence seems empty.  When she meets the dashing officer Count Vronsky (Fredric March), she rejects her marriage and turns to him to fulfill her passionate nature.

Greta Garbo along with Fredric March carry the movie and they both give fine performances.  Even Freddie Bartholomew (who was then a child star) does a good job.  In my opinion though, Basil Rathbone gives a very convincing performance as the husband who is concerned with his career and social position above everything else.

The Russian music that occasionally plays is fantastic.  The costumes are a sight to behold.  All scenery and cinematography are breathtaking.

Unfortunately, the movie seems rushed and doesn't do justice to the rich supporting cast of Tolstoy's novel.  There is a sub-plot with two other characters that seems to go nowhere.  The forming of the relationship (that's central to the movie) between Garbo and March seems somewhat unbelievable since not enough time is given for it to develop.  Worse still, as the movie proceeds it doesn't seem to gain momentum and becomes more-or-less predictable (even though I did not see the last scene coming).

Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in Sept. 2005) has good sound quality.  The picture quality is also surprisingly good (especially when you consider that this movie was made so long ago) but there are faint streaks or lines that occasionally occur in the last scene.  There is one extra: a theatrical trailer.

In conclusion, I think Greta Garbo fans will appreciate this movie despite its problems much more than non-Garbo fans.

382957,3,6301964144,"Anna Karenina (Greta Garbo) is a married woman who finds herself falling in love with the man (Fredric March) her sister (Maureen O' Sullivan) is in love with. It is absolutely taboo for her to even consider taking her new love on as a lover, especially since she has a young son (Freddie Bartholomew) who she adores. However, it is difficult for her to live under the frightening gaze of her rigid husband (Basil Rathbone) so she submits to her feelings.

The novel Anna Karenina is incredibly long so it is obvious that a lot was cut to bring it to a 95 minute film. However, the formation of the relationship between Garbo and March is difficult to believe since there is so little time for it to develop. Their early scenes seem stiff and without feeling. The overall story is also muddled with various events probably important in the novel but seemingly insignificant in the film.

This is the second version of this classic story that Garbo brought to the screen, the first being the silent film Love. As a result, she is natural in the role. However, her performance does not change the dull script.",1136678400,16,1107,4.614213197969543

Personally I always thought in Isabel Adjani playing this role she was perfect; because she has character sidereal beauty and that expressive gaze, able to express so many emotions.

382959,4,6301964144,"I am a huge fan of Greta Garbo, and I have seen all her movies more than once. I recently bought her Signature DVD collection and I was very happy to own it finally. I was watching ""Anna Karenina"" on the other day on DVD and I found out that a scene is missing from the movie. In that scene Greta Garbo's character Anna is with Frederic March's character Vronsky in Venice riding a gondola. Then, all of a sudden, a little boy comes to them and shows some tricks and Anna becomes very pleased to see him because he reminded her of her own son. She throws some coins to him. The missing scene is actually a part of this scene. That same boy brings all his friends from his neighborhood and they are all starting to do the same tricks as he was doing to get more coins. The whole scene takes approximately 5 minutes.
First, I thought that my DVD might have been defected, but I was so determined to find out that I actually bought another DVD just to prove myself that it is not defected. The production did skip that scene from the DVD. In May I went to see this movie on a big screen at UCLA and the scene was there. So if you are a picky person like me I would not recommend you to buy this DVD till the Warner Brothers will correct that mistake.",1128643200,53,1247,4.114754098360656
382960,5,6301964144,"Garbo plays the title character who forsakes her home and family for the love of the army officer Vronsky (played by Frederic March). It can't hold up to the book, of course, but Garbo is magnificent to watch, and Basil Rathbone as her demanding husband is simply terrific and faultless. In fact, Rathbone sticks more in the mind than March does. Definitely worth a watch.",1116115200,2,372,4.7384615384615385
382961,2,6301964144,"I'm extremely partial to Basil Rathbone, who played Anna's husband Karenin in this 1935 movie. Now, we're all familiar with Basil's villains, like Sir Guy in ""Robin Hood"" or his indestructible hero Sherlock Holmes. This time he was trying something different for a while: he actually was conveying nervousness when his character had to take his wife to task for her improprieties. Very unlike Basil, and I was surprised and delighted to see it. However, his character quickly had to become A Mean Vengeful Husband in order to make Garbo's Anna look good, and that was a bore.
Which brings me round to my general opinion of ""Anna Karenina"", notwithstanding BR. I found this an unsatisfactory representation of Tolstoy's novel because the characterization of Anna is all wrong. Garbo is much too confident, too together to make this story work. Anna is a formerly above reproach wife of a bureaucrat. Finally, she attracts some attention from a dashing army officer and then she falls from grace. I guess no one had tried to seduce her before; she is not in love with her husband. But though she chooses to pursue her illicit affair with Count Vronsky the officer, she cannot withstand society's rejection of her. It's not just ""oh, she saw him talking gaily to a blonde""--it's the whole of Russian society that turns its back on her for her sin. So, she starts to lose her grip mentally which is why she takes A Drastic Step at the story's end. Greta Garbo didn't seem all that interested in Fredric March's Vronsky, at least not so much to follow him to Venice. I also didn't think she interacted effectively with her husband in their early domestic scenes, either. Here, she was the one giving him the cold shoulder and he looked alienated. I would more certainly have believed he would be the one to look for consolation from Vronsky! Or at least somebody.
Of course, with such a short running time, the Levin/Kitty subplot went nowhere. That's also too bad, because Maureen O'Sullivan's Kitty was cutting a good figure as the jilted somewhat jealous Kitty at the ball. Although a lot of reviewers really slam Fred March, he's okay, especially when he becomes increasingly exasperated with all the doggone togetherness his affair with Anna has brought him.
Bottom line: Garbo not cast correctly. Lengthier treatment would have allowed for more deserved depth of character for both Basil and Maureen.",1060560000,7,2401,4.872860635696822

Anna Karenina (Greta Garbo) lives a life of dull monotony, broken only by the presence of her engaging son Sergei (Freddie Bartholomew).  Her cold husband Karenin (Basil Rathbone) treats her more like a trophy than a wife, and she relishes her carefree visits to her relatives.
When Anna falls in love with the dashing - and younger - Captain Vronsky (Fredric March) she gives way to a great passion...and even greater tragedy.
This was in fact a remake of the hugely-successful silent film LOVE, again starring Greta Garbo with her frequent leading-man (and lover) John Gilbert.  Both versions are splendid, but this version stays more faithful to Tolstoy's novel.

Garbo, always fascinating to watch, is very strong in the role of a woman torn between her love for an officer and sacrificing her child.  Fredric March, as the officer she loves, does not register as strongly.  It's difficult to see the attraction he holds for Garbo.  Basil Rathbone, playing Garbo's rigid husband, is appropriately cold, while the rest of the cast walks through their roles without much notice.  All in all, the film failed to engage me to any great degree.  The screenplay is stiffly written, with little time given to showing how the lovers' relationship developed, and several wooden moments of dialogue that fall flat.  Were it not for the presence of Garbo, I don't think there would be much to recommend in it.

382964,5,6301964144,"It is appropriate that one of literature's greatest and most tragic figures, Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, is given compelling life on screen by one of fildom's most gifted and spellbinding artists, Greta Garbo, in MGM's luxurious production of Tolstoy's masterpiece, ""Anna Karenina"".
Anna is the neglected wife of Russian aristocrat/bureaucrat, Karenin, haughtily portrayed by Basil Rathbone. Karenin is consumed by his career and social standing.  It seems that the only reason he married Anna and had a son with her is to enhance his ""respectibility"" in society.
When a handsome officer, Count Vronsky, played with conviction by Frederic March, understandably is infatuated by the astonishingly beautiful and charming Anna, he makes this known to her.  He is persistent in his pursuit of her.
At first Anna is reticent to his charms, but eventually succumbs. This story takes place during the 1800's under the reign of Czar Nicholas I of Russia.  In this era, there was a strict and judgmental social code.  Adultery was treated like a crime or a contagious disease, and Anna finds herself the object of scorn and ridicule among society.
Anna's husband Karenin refuses to grant Anna a divorce and tells their son that Anna is dead when she flees to Venice with Vronsky. Eventually Anna becomes a social outcast because of her affair, and Vronsky begins to suffocate from their relationship. He decides to go off to war rather than be with Anna constantly.
Devasted by Vronsky's abandonment and shunned by society, Anna's fate is tragic.
I can imagine few other actresses than Greta Garbo who could so realistically embody the character of Anna. Anna is essentially a good person, a loving mother, and dutiful wife.  But she is starved for tenderness and affection so she turns to Vronsky.  Garbo subtly conveys Anna's despair and loneliness in her loveless marriage to Karenin.  Garbo makes you empathize with her predicament, and you truly feel the joy, passion, and guilt that Anna experiences as she falls in love with Vronsky.
As an actress, Garbo is a minimalist in the best sense.  She understands that less is more.  She can gladden or break your heart with a glance, a smile, or the slightest tilt of her posture.  Her eyes are wondrously expressive. This is a masterful, mature, and dignified performance by a consummate actress.
As for the rest of the movie, the direction, sets, and photography are all impressive.  And Garbo's unearthly beauty is complemented by the ravishing costumes designed by Adrian. This version of ""Anna Karenina"" is a triumph.",1036886400,29,2561,5.0738095238095235
382965,3,6301964144,"....because he plays a cad and I just can't take seeing Fred playing a cad!  I was glad to read in his bio that he himself didn't want to do this part, feeling it wasn't really the best for him. But he had to do it...Really, he is much better as the romantic GOOD guy, not the sort of romantic, selfish BAD guy.
I will start first with what I liked about this film. First of all, Fredric March. This man rarely fails to impress me as an actor. He was just such a wonderful guy too...so handsome and romantic. In this, he looks terrific in the military uniforms, has a GREAT haircut and a cute little mustache. Once again he has a drunk scene, which is very unique. All these Russian soldiers drinking shots in unison and with the precision as if they are doing drills on the parade field. And then they must crawl under the table, come back to their place, and then the commander shouts orders to prepare for the next drink...truly weird!! Also, the opening shot of the LONG LONG table of food was very impressive. I liked Basil Rathbone because he did a great job of being the strange husband of Anna's. I liked the relationship Anna had with her young son. I liked seeing Fred doing the Russian dance at the party.
What I didn't like. As mentioned before, seeing Fred as a cad. I didn't like his selfishness. I don't like Greta Garbo much, and while she did okay in this film, she just seemed so tragic in spirit all the time, like she never really was happy, but was in a trap of an unhappy marriage, yet her affair with Vronsky was not any happier. It didn't seem like they really liked each other; I didn't feel any passion between them; it was very strange how the whole love affair was handled in the film, but then I read that the Code had a lot to do with that. I don't approve of affairs; and I couldn't respect Anna as a person because her values were wrong. She gave up her son for a fling with another man. A mother who truly loves her children will never go and seek something for herself at the expense of her children.
The whole film was generally dark and meloncholy, sad and tragic. You could be happy for neither Anna or Vronsky. You sit at the end of the movie only feeling sad for their tragedy. It is not a ""happy"" watch.
But I did like to gaze upon a handsome Fredric March! If you want to see Fredric as a Russian soldier again...see him in We Live Again. He is young and handsome and beautiful in this one too. Based on Leo Tolstoy's ""Ressurection"", he plays a cad in that one as well, but happily we get to see him realize the errors of his ways and he make his wrongs right.
I must also share with you that this Anna Karenina is MUCH better than the later remake with Vivien Leigh. Skip that one, watch this one.",1035849600,,2739,4.217142857142857
382966,4,6301964144,"Watching this movie Garbo came across as a tender nurturing mother, a very strong, self assure woman capable of hadling any situation that came before her,contrary to the Anna in the book.
The other side of all this was that Garbo failed greatly to convince me that she was distraught by the the problems the arose with the relationship with Wronsky,and consequently kill herself.
The part where Anna has a child with Wronsky was omited in this movie.
Overall still very much worth getting this video.",1008460800,2,501,4.837209302325581

She falls in love with the dashing Vronski and must choose between passionate love and giving up everythingincluding her young son.  This film is an abbreviated version of the ponderous classic novel, but it hits the highpoints of the plot and tells the story well. This is a well-crafted film, but there are some lapses in acting and there is no heat, no natural passion between Garbo and Marchbasic weakness in the film. However, the movie stars Garbo, and her classic beauty, her expression, and her incomparable screen presence make this film must see viewing.",1503705600,,632,5.076923076923077
7817501,5,6301964144,"After watching the latest film version of Anna Karenina and disliking it, and never having seen a film with Greta Garbo, I decided to watch this 1935 version with some trepidation, fearing it would contain the over-heavy acting that is typical of the early films. It was not so. I liked the film and I liked Garbo and I recommend it.",1491436800,,333,4.475409836065574
7817502,5,6301964144,"This 1935 version of Anna Karenina is by far the BEST film adaptation of Tolstoy's classic book.  Was thrilled this video staring Greta Garbo in the lead role was available on AMAZON VIDEO!

Of course, the book is superior to the film.. However, if you have not read the book, please see this 1935 classic version!  It surpasses any and all other film adaptations!

Thank you AMAZON for offering this classic movie on Amazon Video!  Hoping to see move classic films in the future..

Respectfully,
