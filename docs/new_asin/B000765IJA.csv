2200578,2,B000765IJA,"Blood Angels (aka Thralls) is a clone of a number of other bikini-clad vampire films - with a story-line very much like Embrace the Darkness II/Morgana/Blonde Heaven about a girl who goes to the big city to look for her sister who happens to be a vampire - or to be exact a ""Thrall"", in this film thralls are blood-suckers too, but with not quite the same powers as vampires.

They escape from their vampire master, set up a bar to host parties, and feed from muscled studs. There's only two 'sex' scenes with the most minimal amount of skin shown... except one case where there's very likely a body-double used.

Can the 'thralls' evade their vampire master for long? Will the hick country sister save her 'evil' sister? Why is it that she can blurt out to a complete stranger that her sister's a vampire, and he believes her instead of seeking medical help for her?

There are a very few interesting special effects, such as a vampire girl sticking her tongue about 15cms into the air (whether it's to 'taste' the air like a snake, or not, who knows, as she's not poking it out at anyone).",1112572800,10,1091,4.472361809045226

2200585,4,B000765IJA,"Campy, funny B movie. BUT much better than I thought it would be. I think most of the girls did a good job with what they had to work with script wise. Just don't look here for a suspenseful vampire thriller. I liked it being just as it is, not really scary. LOL Call me a wimp! LOL",1431302400,,282,3.8793103448275863

2200594,3,B000765IJA,"My expectations were pretty low for this movie.  I like vampire movies but many of them can be really campy.  This one had relatively decent actors in it and there was some humor.  I frankly thought it would be gratuitously sprinkled with nudity - but it wasn't.  There was only one scene where breasts were shown.  There was a lot of bad language and the obvious blood and guts.  Probably wouldn't watch it again, but it is by no means the worst vampire movie I've ever seen.",1415059200,,476,4.413793103448276

2200599,2,B000765IJA,"There is a Goldielocks zone for camp, somewhere just between cringe and comedy.  This movie spends most of its time riding the edge of cringe, and is punctuated by moments of sheer spine tingling bent over in your seat I can't take it anymore ultracringe.

There is some entertainment to be had here, but not much.",1410134400,,314,4.589285714285714
2200600,3,B000765IJA,"I don't get where all the hate is coming from. As someone who has seen A LOT of vampire ,ovies- this was way better than expected. As others have mentioned, the ubervamp is a pretty weak character- luckily he's in the movie all of... 10 minutes or so?
The main actors are all really good for a B-movie and it's definitely more fun than horror.
Think of it like an R-rated, really long episode of Charmed. Don't take it seriously, expect really bad CGI, and enjoy the view and campy one-liners. There is a lot of cheesy gore and one scene with naked boobs. It's nice that the female characters are actually pretty badass and while there is one character trying to get laid- it's NOT horror-vampire-porn like a lot of vampire flicks.",1410048000,,731,4.503759398496241

2200602,1,B000765IJA,"The reviewer here who says this DVD of Blood Angels is misrecorded is correct.  Its as if a non-anamorphic movie has been stretched to play anamorphically, i.e. the image is stretched horizontally.  In other words, the authoring is defective.",1407283200,,242,5.17948717948718

Worst script, topic and actors and actresses that I have ever seen!!!  They could not even be good make believe Vampires!!!  This movie actually made me barf!!!!",1403136000,,203,4.911764705882353
2200605,2,B000765IJA,Did not watch the entire movie (it was too hokey for me). The part of the movie I saw I am rating 2 stars.,1401235200,,106,3.4583333333333335
2200606,2,B000765IJA,Little did I know when I loaded this flick up that the socalled master vamp is none other than Lorenzo friggin Lamas. Does that not doom a movie to the also ran bin or what? It was entertaining about 30% of the movie but Lamas is no horror-scifi player worth watching. My ultimate judgement of a movie is whether i'll watch it again and this one is a no.,1401148800,,354,4.144927536231884
2200607,5,B000765IJA,Blood Angels is a great movie! This was one of the best movies I have ordered from Amazon. I will order more.,1390003200,,109,4.0

2200610,4,B000765IJA,"This movie is pretty good with humorous twists and turns.  I do not understand why the emphasis on Lorenzo Lamas on the box when the main characters are the pretty girls who acted like the girls in the remake of Sorority Rows, with fangs.  Lorenzo did not have a role big enough to show his martial art prowess.",1375660800,,311,4.344827586206897
2200611,3,B000765IJA,This could have been a much better film if there was a bit more intimate scenes.  Hollywood should remake this one.,1369008000,,115,4.476190476190476

2200613,3,B000765IJA,"It a B-movie for sure, but those are often enjoyable.  This has all the hallmarks of good vampire cheese: hot vampires, a do-gooder country boy, an innocent young girl, a side-kick pretending to be ""street yo,"" an almost comical Reinfield, an over-the-top bad guy, and a fight scene with a bat that looks like if flew straight off the Army of Darkness set.  The good thing about a little cheese though is that it goes good with wine.  So if you are in the mood check your brain, pour a glass, and you'll enjoy this flick.",1355529600,,521,4.40625
2200614,3,B000765IJA,"Received DVD in a timely manner, however, it had a messege that kept popping up throughout the movie: THIS COPY FOR SCREENING PURPOSES ONLY.

I was not informed that this was a screening version. Thats kinda disappointing.",1274486400,,222,5.0
2200615,2,B000765IJA,"Hot babes in black leather and fangs, a throbbing nightclub scene...great setup for a vampire flick. Too bad this one falls flat. Don't blame the actresses, who revel in kicking the butts of unruly male patrons, having sex with them and then biting them in the, uh...place where folks sometimes sarcastically ask others to bite them.  The problems lie in the dialog and plot, which seem to have been made up on the fly, as it were. When the big twist comes near the end, you'll find yourself saying ""huh?""  Don't bother rewinding and reviewing...it still won't make sense.  This could have been fun, but it's ruined, in no small part, by stupid male characters...a hayseed boyfriend, his asian buddy who tries to impress chicks by talking like a thug, and finally Lamas, an ubervampire whose attitude and behavior make no sense whatsoever.  No suspense, no fun, no scares, no redeeming qualities.  Skip this one.",1203811200,,912,4.858064516129033

2200617,3,B000765IJA,"Blood Angels is the story of a small town girl who has come to stay in the city with her big sister. Little realizing that the sister and the rest of the club staff are actually demi-vampires.

Judging by the cover of this film, I expected it to be cheesecake. Parts were. But I was pleased to see there were actually a few hot guys in this too.

Parts of this film were actually kind of funny like the Japanese kid who wanted to be a hipster, and the comments made by the master vampire. I particularly thought the ending was pretty funny.

This is a B-rated campy, silly vampire film with a few good scenes. Rated R for nudity and violence.",1116979200,19,642,4.245901639344262
2200618,2,B000765IJA,"I am a collector of vampire movies, but I try to stay away from the cheapie home-made Grade ZZZ vampire movies. But every now and then I get suckered. Like on Dracula 3000 and now on this one. The one reviewer does a good job on explaining the ""plot"", threadbare as it is. The production values are very VERY low. The whole story pretty much takes place in the nightclub run by vampires. Dull. I gave it two stars because the actors (except for Fernando Lamas) really give it a good try working with what they've got. Skip it, unless you absolutely MUST have every vampire or Fernando Lamas movie available.",1113177600,7,607,4.4774774774774775

8044773,3,B000765IJA,"This is a fun vampire movie. You know going in that it's not that serious but it's done with energy. Lorenzo Lamas is his regular cheesy self, but fun to watch. The structure of the story is unexpectedly sophisticated, with very good use of flashbacks that integrate nicely with the ongoing action. It's never too complicated to get bogged down but there's enough detail so that the story has some meat to it.

If you like horror films generally (including horror-comedy), then you'll probably find this entertaining.",1485993600,,517,4.942528735632184
