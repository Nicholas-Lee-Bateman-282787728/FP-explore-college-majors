8695357,5,B00RI4UVVO,"This is a very emotional movie, which should prove very relevant to Americans. At the same time, it's a view into Swedish culture, and fascinating for that as well. There's an early ""tell"" in the movie, and a twist to jar you at just the right moment. I recommend not reading the description here or on the case, but I abhor spoilers.

The Swedish subtitles are very nearly word-for-word as far as I recall. That's helpful if you're buying this to improve your Swedish.",1489363200,,469,4.583333333333333
