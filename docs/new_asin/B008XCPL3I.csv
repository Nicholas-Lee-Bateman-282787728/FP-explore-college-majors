8532073,5,B008XCPL3I,"Looking at some of the other reviews here, I'm starting to think they shouldn't let 14 year old fanboys write reviews.  This was a low budget B-movie but not some zero budget indie production, either.  A Brian Yuzna film, it features professional acting and cinematography with a half-way decently rendered CGI monster.  A group of people trapped on a stilt-house in the ocean are besieged by a giant prehistoric sea scorpion that seems to have a mystical connection to a young girl kidnapped by slavers.  Michael Pare`, at 58 years old, shows he still has the chops to be leading man.  Competently made, main flaw of this movie is that it's not bad enough to be funny, and not different enough to be memorable, kinda like ""Deep Rising"" but not as good or as expensive.  Still, worth a watch for monster movie fans only.  A couple of decent kills, one female topless shot at beginning.",1526256000,,885,4.670967741935484
8532074,2,B008XCPL3I,"Michael Pare is in this and that is about the only decent thing about it.  Set in Sumatra and a Dutch production, the dialogue seems a bit disjointed.  The creature is better that one of those from a SyFy tv movie but overall the movie is lacking.  The story just doesn't have a lot of substance.  There's a good bit of blood and gore but it's not overboard.  I couldn't even care enough when it was on and ended up on the computer while it played.  I promptly forgot about it after I watched so nothing memorable.  If you see it ok but you're not missing anything if you don't.",1425513600,2,578,4.2
8532075,1,B008XCPL3I,"THIS MOVIE IS SO BAD. I CAN DO BETTER. IT'S BAD, BAD, BAD,BAD. LIKE NO MOVIE YOU HAVE EVER SEEN.

8532076,4,B008XCPL3I,"This was filmed in 3d back in 2010.  It was not a conversion, instead it was filmed in native 3d.  It was a low budget film to be sure but they made the best of what they had and it's a decent traditional monster on the loose film.  When you do languages on this one it says  'german , Italy , german, but in fact it has NO Italian language tracks , the second one is a English track. Michael Pare leads the cast here and he's the only one you will know. The effects are very good on this one, they are mix of the old traditional robotic ones and cgi , (computer generated effects).  They are quite effective too.  If you enjoyed the MANY low budget films of the past featuring  giant menacing creature then this one is for you.  In this case it's a  eupertrid , or giant sea scorpion. they dominated the oceans , long before the dinosaurs were around.  Some of them came onto land and became the scorpions we know. In fact scorpions were t he first land animals.  The action mainly takes place at a sea platform. Which is fine. I had recently watched 'the carra' or the crabs on dvd and it was made in 1981. It had no cgi but it was a fine low budget monster film.  This is like that , only the effects are much better of course. I am a sucker for those big monsters on the loose films . so this was a fun ride for me.  If you are a snob and don't like those old movies like 'taratula' of the crab monsters. then you might not like this one. In fact I don't think anyone has made a film like this for the big screen, except on tv, mainly the sci fi channel that is. But this is a true b movie , in every way , with a platform of villains and a big monster ready to eat them all.  Theblu ray looks great and the 3d is really excellent.  with NO ghosting on my , active 3d tv and glasses.  I recently got another german film , 'the cargo' and the ghosting on the blu ray was bad. This one had perfect 3d! It is in 2d as well. however 3d always looks better and more natural and that's a good thing.  There are no extras on this disc though.",1401667200,5,2039,3.9583333333333335
8532077,3,B008XCPL3I,"The English soundtrack shows up as ""Ital "" in the Blu ray menu. No wonder I could not find it. On my samsung it shows as Und.  No subs. I will have to rate this film as good. Good 3D Good animation. Very good monster. So the disk does not list an english soundtrack.  But I found it.",1400025600,3,283,3.8620689655172415
8532078,4,B008XCPL3I,Another great horror film from Brian Yuzna. The full size creature at the end is a great work of art. The sea rig in the film is isolated from any close land and adds to the horror of the film. Don't miss this one if you can help it.,1371081600,6,233,3.7755102040816326
8532079,4,B008XCPL3I,My mosy favorite type of movie. I look for ones I have never seen before and this one was a good one.,1366070400,4,101,3.6363636363636362
