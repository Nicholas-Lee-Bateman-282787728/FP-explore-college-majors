8279334,4,B000UMP31O,"I have not had cable television for over five years. Some of these programs are relatively recent and I was glad to be able to view them. Episodes include:
Disc 1: Thanksgiving in 60
# Thanksgiving in 60
# 30 Minute Meals: Holiday Maneuvers
Disc 2: Holiday Entertaining in 60
# Holiday Entertaining in 60
# 30 Minute Meals: Holiday Party Bites
Disc 3: 30 Minute Meals: Holiday in a Hurry
# 30 Minute Meals: Pre-bird Packing
# 30 Minute Meals: Thanks Again
# 30 Minute Meals: Holidays in a Hurry

One episode that was missing was the 30-minute ""Thanksgiving in a Flash"" episode that I had expected and wanted to see again. That is the reason for my less than 5-star rating.

I never actually make these in 30 minutes but do like the strategies of finding shortcuts and putting in a lot of flavor. There is not an excessive amount of fat in the recipes. As for desserts, these are less work than traditional holiday desserts and still have great presentation and flavor.

I did not understand how to retrieve the recipes by inserting the disks in my computer, so I got them off the [...] site when available.",1236211200,,1106,4.492537313432836
