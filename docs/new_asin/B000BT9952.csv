2440491,5,B000BT9952,We should support Underground film especially the best of it. This film has won so many awards and has gotten so much critical praise that at the very least we should not seek to destroy the little guys as they are upcoming. The land scape of American film is filled with substandard un-watchable crap and this film rises high above most of it. I am a film maker and I can relate to the creators of this movie. The journey to bring a film from an idea to a published work is daunting.  I bought this DVD because I too follow underground film. It is an important film because so rarely do underground films come into the main stream like this one has and it is folly to shoot this film down plain and simple. it is important in the Underground film world and anyone who can't see how nuanced and complicated this movie is just simple lacks the open mindedness and intelligence to understand the cult genre.,1134691200,2,905,4.386904761904762
2440492,5,B000BT9952,"You have to love cult films. This movie mixes every genre except kids movies and it all manages to work. I mean you can tell it's an Independent film but you don't buy a film Called The Land of College Prophets and expect King Kong. It's really more of a comedy and a lot like army of darkness, it's very smart too so stay sharp or you'll miss it. It's not a chick flick either. You can tell a few chicks below already reviewed it.",1134691200,3,431,4.08235294117647
2440493,1,B000BT9952,"I saw this movie, and I use that term VERY loosely, in film class. As an example of what NOT TO DO. LAND OF THE COLLEGE PROPHETS is bad. Really, REALLY BAD. And not a ""fun bad"", either.

Where do I begin? It claims to be directed by about eight different people and it shows. It also shows that not a one of them ever went to school, either. Very simple, first day, Film School 101 rules are completely ignored and it shows off that the people doing the thing are nothing short of amateur and really comes across as a public-access show.

It claims to have a script, but can't see how. The story, another term that I use very loosely, is all over the place and extremely ponderous. It tries like the dickens to tell the story of the world coming to an end on some Lucas-Spielberg-Jackson-type scale. Except no one told the rest of the town- traffic runs as normal, college students wander freely during the numerous badly choreographed fights between the (cough) heroes and assorted grade-z hell-spawn. Attention to any kind of believable detail is simply non-existent.

Whatever you do, AVOID THIS MOVIE. Do not believe a single positive review about it (as they obviously are coming from the less-than-no-talent hacks that were involved with this turkey), because anyone with DNA will be not only bored to tears by this thing, but downright insulted.",1134691200,11,1352,4.6722689075630255
2440494,4,B000BT9952,"I liked it. It's rare that you can rent a film with absolutely no stars, watch the film and find it enjoyable. Don't get me wrong it's really wierd but it's original material and that's rare.",1134345600,4,191,4.333333333333333
2440495,4,B000BT9952,I'm a comic book fan and an Underground film lover. If you like these types of films I think you'll like this. It's a cool cult film that is actually quite good and strangly enough touching at times and the price is pretty damn cheap too!!!!,1134345600,2,241,4.260869565217392
2440496,1,B000BT9952,"One of the most painful ""movies"" I have ever endured, only by sawing at my own leg. Story, nice try. Acting, none. Technically, to late to go back to school and learn what not to do for this one.

An absolute waste of time and I want mine back.",1134345600,9,244,3.979591836734694
2440497,5,B000BT9952,"Hey, don't pay attention to those nasty whiners who put this flick down.  The movie is weird, original, fast, funny and imaginative.",1138320000,4,132,5.0
2440498,1,B000BT9952,"A friend of mine saw this movie at a film festival in Connecticut (which was actually two guys and a video projector at a local library community room). He said that this was the worst movie he had ever seen. I happened across ""Land of the College Prophets"" while looking for a christmas gift and asked my friend if this was the movie he saw. It was and I ordered it. Man, was my friend right! This movie is bad. This movie is beyond bad. The people involved with making it, with showing it, and with putting it on dvd should be banished to Syberia and should never have contact with other people ever again. You want a good movie with a great plot and great visuals? Go see (or rent) ""Hostel"". You want to waste both your time and your money and feel angry that you did? Then pick up ""Land of the College Prophets""",1136851200,4,815,4.230769230769231
2440499,5,B000BT9952,You guys have really come a long way! COngrat on it all. Don't let the success go to your head. Congrats on your Best Fantasy film of the year award!!!!!!!,1136419200,,155,4.2
2440500,5,B000BT9952,"The over-exaggereated sound effects, the roaring music, the funny outfits, the oneliners. It's B-movie glory at it's coolest. I met these guys at a convention and they we hilarious. The DVD could use some extras but you can't blame that on the filmmakers or on the film. Dare I say it I would pay to see a sequel if it ever came out!",1136419200,,333,4.301587301587301
2440501,5,B000BT9952,"It's awesome when you watch a film and you can spot some of the locations from where you live. This is really good work a couple of guys from CT. Keep it up guy, we will supprt you!!!!",1135382400,,184,3.8684210526315788
2440502,4,B000BT9952,I love Monty Python and this has that dry humor that is awesome. It has some pretty cool writing/poetry in it too. It's an interesting mix of violence and poetry. It's one of the better York Entertainment releases as well.,1135382400,,222,4.575
2440503,2,B000BT9952,"I got this movie for my birthday. Let me tell you, having a birthday so close to x-mas really bites. But not as much as this movie does. When it started, it was so bad that I thought it was a comedy. It's not. Points for trying, but it makes grateful that Amazon has a great return policy. And, Mike, if you're reading this, for your birthday I'm going to get you ten pounds of rotting fish. That should let you know just bad this movie stunk.",1135382400,7,443,4.103448275862069
2440504,4,B000BT9952,"Hit the right spot for me. I grew up watching Troma films and loving them. This film seems to mix the best of Troma with some real filmmaking and craft. For low budget film the image is crisp, the editing is great and the story is very good. It's good to see Indie film isn't dead and people still take risks.",1135209600,,309,4.081967213114754
2440505,3,B000BT9952,"My friend make me watch it. It's not really my think but I can see the effort that went into it. The Costumes, the Well, som pretty big brawl scenes. It's a decent rental. I can see these guys going some where in the next decade.",1135209600,2,229,4.0
2440506,5,B000BT9952,I don't quite know where they're going with that. It's more like sin City. it doesn't have the budget but I like the story and the narration. I'm so tired of Vampire or ghost movies so this is a breathe of fresh air. Long live the independent film.,1135123200,2,248,4.1875
2440507,5,B000BT9952,"Among the beatings, the blood and the brawls it was surprisingly touching. This is a rare film, rare indeed. I hope to see their other work.",1135123200,2,140,4.423076923076923
2440508,5,B000BT9952,Worth the wait! Heard about this title years ago but didn't think it would come out.,1135123200,,84,4.3125
2440509,1,B000BT9952,"Check it out, that Boyd guy is right. He posted something bad, then 5 guys jumped on him and buried it. If you check out what else they've reviewed, you'll see that every single one of them have only reviewed this movie! WHAT A BUNCH OF LOSERS! I bet they they'll bury this one with a bunch of BS reviews too! Losers, serious losers!",1135036800,9,333,4.21875
2440510,3,B000BT9952,"This film is undeniable original. There is nothing like it, not even a little. It's not perfect and there are some things i could do without. The Vomiting for one though there's so much blood, vomiting and swearing that there wouldn't be a film without it. It is however very humorous and well thought out, It quotes from great poets and scientists and the narration acts to show the audience the humanity of these thugs. If you like strange films it's a rare find it's cool this small film found it's way from the basement.",1135036800,,524,4.526315789473684
2440511,3,B000BT9952,"DVD extras Suck!! oh wait I don't mean suck I mean there are none. The movie is decent, decent action scenes. The DVD needs help, perhaps a menu or some extras would help things. I can't imagine the filmmakers wanted it to be like this so I'm not gong to take it out on them and I'm not that angry because the DVD was cheap but I feel like somone should say something.",1134950400,,368,4.054794520547945
2440512,5,B000BT9952,A bunch of guys dressed like pirates beating up people in bars is great by my standards. Troma should have released this film though they would have at least put a menu on the DVD. It's suprisingly literate with Hemmingway-esc narration you know but with fart jokes. There is no film like this on the market and no doubt it's not for everyone. This is like Peter Jackson's Bad Taste and I can't help but think if someone ever gave these guys a budget then maybe we'd get another Dead Alive.,1134950400,,490,4.395604395604396
2440513,5,B000BT9952,"One of the wierdest and coolest films to hit DVD this year. It's a miracle that a wierd film gets out like this one. As Fangoria puts it ""It's a Genre-Blender"" (That's how I found it) and boy is it ever. Hats off to the creators for getting the project seen.",1134864000,,258,4.078431372549019
2440514,3,B000BT9952,"Boys behaving badly is my favorite, this film becomes a tad too cartoony towards the end and some of the thoughts don't seem to connect but the narration is cool and the military guy is a good looking chap.",1134864000,,206,4.3076923076923075
2440515,4,B000BT9952,"Good action, good characters. The first 15 minutes are a little confusing but once the fight scenes start and the music roars it's good times. Decent gore reminds me of Romper Stomper a little. Funny too.",1134864000,,204,4.694444444444445
2440516,1,B000BT9952,"I actually worked on this movie. Well, briefly. I worked as a grip for the classroom scenes.  But only for a few days because I simply could not stomach the out-of-control egos of the Hale Manor Collective. I also have to point out something very shady going on here. A few days ago, someone posted an honest review of this movie that the Collective did not agree with. A quick side note, the reviewer hit the nail on the head in saying that the reviews came from the people involved with the movie. When the DVD's listing first appeared here on Amazon, an e-mail was sent out for everyone to post reviews. When the negative review was posted, another e-mail was sent out telling us to ""bury it"". The good reviews that are on this page are not honest, they are all phony and posted by the various members of the Hale Manor Collective. And frankly, that really stinks and is really unprofessional. So guys, face the facts. You made a lousy movie and somebody called you on it. Grow up.",1134777600,14,984,4.43646408839779
8092232,4,B000BT9952,I caught that segment on CT Public access featuring this film and Bikini Blood Bath. It was a show case for underground films. I didn't get to rent it until now. I really liked it. Just a comment to that Goldy guy. I'm almost positive the coverage was the same day as those good reviews so maybe you should do your research before you write that kind of stuff.,1154822400,2,360,4.231884057971015
8092233,1,B000BT9952,"Amazon really needs somebody watching for stunts like this. Let's see, 6 glowing reviews in 2 days from people who haven't reviewed anything else. If that's not stacking the deck, I don't know what is.

And ""Tony"", how exactly am I to do research on what's airing on the public access stations in Connecticut if I currently live in New Jersey? Yes, I used to have contact with the Hale Manor Collective, but I try to avoid it whenever possible because the members of the Hale Manor Collective have a very bad habit of hyping themselves as the greatest directors in the history of film, but have absolutely no production skills to speak of. Simple, very basic, film school rules are claimed as ""beneath them"" such as the 180 degree rule (look this up on the Wikipeda if you are unfamiliar with it), or lighting techniques of any kind, or even white-balancing the camera. They do not understand basic storytelling, nor do they feel that they need to and they are very proud of this fact. Their unlikable characters utter long winded pseudo-psychological nonsense that means absolutely nothing to anyone but them. They make up the story as they go along, because they feel that they are ""too good for a script"", and then spend weekends signing up with account after account filling their listings up with glowing reviews so people believe that they not only have talent, but that they are in demand. And when someone comes along that disagrees with their self-inflated hype, they complain and have the review removed.

I have done the research on these people, ""Tony"". I have worked with them in the past and I have, on several occasions, been in the room when they have been stoned and/or drunk out of their minds while online and clogging their listings with good reviews. They are not professionals. They are not good or talented by any stretch. If they want to be real filmmakers, they should just admit that they are rank amateurs and  go learn how it should be done. Until then, ""Land of College Prophets"" will be their one and only success. And a minimal one at that.",1153699200,5,2071,4.668493150684932
8092234,3,B000BT9952,Both Undead and College Prophets were made on shoestrings. Both are pretty cool smaller films that came out this year. It's worth flixing.,1151971200,3,138,5.043478260869565
8092235,4,B000BT9952,"Took a chance, watch it, liked it. The Art work looked awesome so I picked up a used copy cheap. The first minute you watch it you wonder what the heck is going on but when you let the film take you ot's very funny and rewarding.",1151971200,3,229,3.893617021276596
8092236,3,B000BT9952,I'm cutting this one a break because I just watched like three really horrible flicks in a row but this one was at least made with craft. I'm only writing to basically replace the other review I had up. It wasn't really fair and when I rewatched the film I found that it was a decent work. Keep at it guys.,1151971200,4,306,4.032786885245901
8092237,5,B000BT9952,"Time to saddle up you friends get high and watch this bad boy. This one's a burner!!!!! I don't know what it's like unstoned so let that be a warning but I dug what I saw baby! Pink Ninjas, brawling priests and Mad Max Looking Villians. cool baby, cool.",1151884800,4,253,4.183673469387755
8092238,4,B000BT9952,"I'm holding out hope for a part two. There's some myspace rumblings about a College Prophets 2. Focusing more on the Well. This is the kind of stuff Troma used to be famous for. Watch the film or ""That's not Sexy""!!!!",1151884800,4,217,4.317073170731708
8092239,4,B000BT9952,"Dynamic characters. An insane, sometimes hard to follow but overall satisfying story that to me was a treat to discover. I don't recall ever seeing a film that was so down right silly but played so straight. It's a good experimental film.",1151884800,3,238,4.690476190476191
8092240,1,B000BT9952,"There are only three ways to enjoy this movie-

1) Be forced to watch it at gunpoint.

2) Be dropped on your head when you were a child.

3) Have parents who are brother and sister.

Otherwise, don't bother. This movie isn't worth the plastic it is made of.",1140912000,5,257,4.183673469387755
8092241,5,B000BT9952,"This is most likely the best movie ive seen in 2006! indie b move goodness without apology. good filmwork combined with a brain twisting script(love the over done b movie goodies) Great and occasionaly overdone acting(I think this was intentional)Blows the hollywood dreck away because I start to CARE about the people in this movie, even if they are ruffians!",1140307200,4,360,5.016666666666667
