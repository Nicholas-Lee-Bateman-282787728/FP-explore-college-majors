5996298,5,B00FKTCYWS,Takes me back to my youth. I can identify with the venue. I have been to dozens of places just like that one and seen Jerry Jeff preform in many of them. Best ever!,1412121600,,164,3.8529411764705883
5996299,4,B00FKTCYWS,nice compilation of jerrys hits live  on video hes one of my favorite songwriter /performers of all time. he wrote Mr. Bojangles a very awesome song i think its  known  worldwide.,1392768000,,179,4.709677419354839
5996300,3,B00FKTCYWS,"I loved Jerry Jeff at his drunken rowdy best, long before he became a cowboy singer in the vein of Ian Tyson. Trouble with this dvd is that this does not capture that rowdiness as it was filmed in a studio for a TV show. It is from the right period but JJ is just too well behaved for my liking. There is too little of this stuff around on dvd so it's sure better to have than not, but great it isn't.",1392336000,,401,3.8433734939759034
5996301,3,B00FKTCYWS,The CD cover and the DVD cover are the same but the DVD does not have all 28 songs on it - in fact it ony has 12 so many of the songs on the DVD cover are not on the DVD.,1388016000,6,170,3.0714285714285716
5996302,5,B00FKTCYWS,"Great selection of Jerry Jeff songs performed in a typical, small venue location. Keeps you singing along and tapping your toes.",1370390400,,128,5.142857142857143
5996303,5,B00FKTCYWS,"I really enjoyed this video.

Jerry Jeff performs in a small bar in Austin and you can tell he's having a great time doing it.

Yes, you can tell this was converted over from a slightly damaged tape but I think this adds to the fun of the video.  This wasn't a grand production, just a bar in Texas in the 80's.

The sounds is great and that's important part.

A must have for and Jerry Jeff Walker fan.",1358294400,3,403,4.050632911392405
5996304,5,B00FKTCYWS,"There is nothing slick or fancy about this DVD production of vintage Jerry Jeff Walker, but then again there is nothing fancy or slick about Jerry Jeff which has been the key to his popularity. This is JJW in his element; a small honkytonk with people drinking, dancing and singing along. Great last 3rd of the concert has Jerry Jeff giving a preview of what was to come, just a man and his guitar and music. If your a Jerry Jeff fan, especially going all the way back to the 70's, this is a great find. If you've come to Jerry Jeff late in his career, you can see what it was that started the whole thing.",1350172800,7,606,4.188034188034188
5996305,5,B00FKTCYWS,"This is a must for any Jerry Jeff fan, or fan of Outlaw Country. The lead guitar is amazing. Mr. Bojangles at his best. We ordered two more for family members.",1350086400,3,159,4.161290322580645
5996306,5,B00FKTCYWS,"I bought this DVD when it first came out. There is not a whole lot of Jerry Jeff Walker video out there that is commercially available, so, I am always quick to pick up anything that Jerry Jeff releases in the way of vintage video. It is true that this seems to be taken from an old video tape and transferred to DVD without too much in the way of ""clean-up"". But as I watched the DVD, the video blurbs seem to be few. For me it does not detract from the great pleasure of seeing this older concert.
The song selection is GREAT! He does several songs that I do not hear him do often in concert. The audio is great, also. The band is in great form. I would love to see Jerry Jeff backed up with the original Lost Gonzo Band, but Bob Livingston and John Inmon are here, so it's all good!!
I was really hoping that NEW WEST would release the old Jerry Jeff tapes from Austin City Limits, as they have with so many other artists. But, as of this writing, they have not. Until they do, Jerry Jeff Live At Dixie's Bar will have to do, and that's not such a bad thing to have to settle for!!! I understand that Butch Hancock (who is responsible for Dixie's Bar and Bus Stop) has many more tapes from artists at around this same time frame. I will eagerly await any more that he will release.
To sum it up, don't let anyone complaining about the poor video quality deter you from buying this! Buy it anyway, you won't be disappointed!!!",1348185600,8,1428,4.177536231884058
5996307,3,B00FKTCYWS,"I've always been a fan of jerry jeff walker and this show is the reason why. great music. that said, the video is not very good. it's been copied from video tape and not very well done. there's bleeding, soft picture and line distortions. i would give the music 4 stars because of the gonzo backup band but only 2 stars for the video. i'm sure there are much better quality shows out there.to me, this seems like a quickly done production to make some quick cash.",1347494400,2,463,4.333333333333333
8616432,2,B00FKTCYWS,Really poor quality video - like a persons hand held video or something.  It was only fun to watch because i am a big fan and know all his music so i wanted to see him in another setting live.  Don't really suggest the purchasing this item.,1527120000,,240,4.085106382978723

8616434,5,B00FKTCYWS,"Glad I finally added Guy's DVD to my collection. To correct earlier reviews, all 28 songs on the CD are on the DVD. 23 songs in the concert and 5 more in the ""outtakes"". Overall this is 90 minutes of one of America's greatest storytellers armed only with his guitar and his songs. Good sound. At times the camera work is a little strange. But sometimes it is interesting watching the expressions on people's faces as Guy spins his tales in a very intimate setting. Guy may have left us too soon, but this DVD helps keep his memory and his stories alive.",1496188800,,553,4.378640776699029
8616435,5,B00FKTCYWS,The reviews were correct about some of the video quality but this is a great collection of Jerry Jeff.,1484006400,,102,4.421052631578948
8616436,5,B00FKTCYWS,Bought thru. AMOZON. This dvd was taken from VHS. This is a little bit grainy and has drop outs. However it was back in the day before DVD and HD. Any JJW fan will love it as much as I do. Almost @ 60 I give it 5 stars +. Anybody is a JJW fan a must fit your collection.,1480896000,,270,3.5166666666666666

8616440,5,B00FKTCYWS,"I have recently purchased this DVD and CD. The  DVD does include 23 tracks, all live and complete from 1984. Now the confusion may exist with the track listing on the cover, which are divided into 3 separate lists which are explained as ""for technical reasons"". I have no knowledge of this set being released with different content.
Guy Clark is true Texas greatness, and if you agree with that, then you will love both the CD and ""this"" DVD which has great sound and for the time excellent picture quality--- No HD back in '84, enjoy.",1418169600,2,535,4.515463917525773
