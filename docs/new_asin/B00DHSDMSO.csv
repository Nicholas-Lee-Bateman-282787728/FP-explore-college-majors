8593394,1,B00DHSDMSO,"Not worth the buy. I got it for my son to watch and it came out horrible.

1. It was very poorly packaged.

2. It was extremely boring to watch. I didn't even finish it.

3. No excitement. Hardly anything was exiting.

4. My son hated it- said he would now be watching more movies his style- I don't disagree.

I would recommend not taking your time to read this piece of garbage. But hey, if you want to waste your time watching this, fine. I ain't stopping you. Do it at your out risk. Just beware- your kids might not like it, or worse- hate it.

I am Stephanie Cotton and I am 29 years old and I live in Willistion, Vermont. Have a good time with your life! Treat it well.",1438819200,,676,4.045112781954887
8593395,2,B00DHSDMSO,"Yes, the little blue Smurfs will be appearing on the big screen this summer in the sequel to the silly 2011 film. Warner Bros. is taking advantage of the new movie by releasing the classic the 1980's The Smurf cartoon series on  two new DVDs, Smurfs to the Rescue (out July 16th) and Smurftastic Journey. The latter is supposed to be released on October 15th, but I ran across it while I was browsing through the five dollar DVD bin at Walmart. I'm a big of the Smurfs, so I had to buy it.

The episodes on the release are:

  The Astrosmurf
  Painter and Poet
  Paradise Smurfed / Supersmurf
  Dreamy's Nightmare / All That Glitters Isn't Smurf

All Smurfs fans know Warner Bros. has been lazy with the DVD releases of the series. In 2008 they released season one on two two-disc volumes, but they now only release single discs with six to four random episodes on it, though A Magical Smurf Adventure did have ten episodes. I understand that a single-disc may sell better due to having a cheaper price, but the episodes on Smurftastic Journey have already been released on the season one sets. They could at least release new-to-DVD episodes!

 I only paid five dollars for the DVD, so I'm not too upset about the price. I can see parents buying this for their kids who are fans of the new movies, but I would not recommend it for older fans, as they probably already own the episodes.",1372723200,13,1386,4.47011952191235
