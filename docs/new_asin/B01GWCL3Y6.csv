8763906,4,B01GWCL3Y6,"This is a very good movie. In some respects I think it's better than ""Zero Dark Thirty"".  You get to know more about
the members of the Seal Team.  You find that they are men with families like everyone else.  Robert Knepper was the
perfect commanding officer.  I think ""Stunner"" was the best team leader. ""Cherry"" gave me the impression he has too
much to prove.  Kathleen Robertson was excellent as an analyst.  Everyone expressing their feelings about situations
added more realism to the movie.  Get it on DVD.  It's very worthwhile.",1534032000,,537,4.760869565217392
