3092863,4,B0012OX7DA,"The three main actors in this film are potentially wonderful!  I was somewhat disappointed by Paul Henried's role (he is usually a stronger character); Bette Davis could also have been better compared to other parts; on the other hand (and as stated in another review), Claude Rains is just excellent (he seems to be able to 'rise' above the mediocrity of a role) - this is a film about classical music, personalities, and deception (hence the tile) - well worth a watch; probably would have gone 3+*, if possible, but because of the actors decided on 4* - any film w/ Bette needs to be watched at least once - :-)",1208476800,3,614,4.531531531531532
3092864,5,B0012OX7DA,"Box set, Warner Home Video, crisp and beautiful in every way!  Hats off to Warner!  All six movies are wonderful.  And four (""All This and Heaven Too"", ""Watch on the Rhine"", ""Deception"", ""In This Our Life"") include commentary tracks!  Of the commentaries only ""Watch on the Rhine"" falls flat - dry as dust.  The others are lively and entertaining packed full of interesting tidbits.  I've never seen a Bette Davis movie I haven't enjoyed.  This set is a good example of Davis' range - the quality of her acting - the believablity of her characters - and the supporting casts are top notch!  As always, Warner has included lots of special features including vintage cartoons and newsreels, shorts and trailers.",1208476800,,709,4.85
3092865,3,B0012OX7DA,"This film was made by Iving Rapper with Bette Davis, Claude rains and Paul Henreid. It was merely a big flop for Bette, the second one in a row (and would be followed by one more, than finally her big comeback All About Eve).This film was made by the director of Now Voyager, and reunited some of the Now, Voyager cast. It wasn't a terribly good picture though. This print is very good ( as is all Warner Films) and you should have no trouble hearing or seeing it.",1208304000,2,464,4.224719101123595
3092866,5,B0012OX7DA,"To buy each of these films separately would cost on the average about $20.00 apiece.  This boxed set is a bargain at this price.  I ordered mine from Amazon and got it the next day (without having to pay fast shipping charges)!

As for the movies themselves they are all superb!  Bette Davis at her finest.  Great entertainment.  I can't add much to the description of what the films themselves contain as some other fine reviews here have already elaborated on quite nicely.

The only nit-picky thing I have to add is this:  On the cover art for the DVDs of ""Watch on the Rhine"" and ""Deception"" the Davis images are wrong.  On ""Watch on the Rhine"" cover it is clearly a still of Bette Davis from ""Now Voyager""; and on the cover for ""Deception"" the image of Bette is from ""A Stolen Life"" with the short dutch bob hairstyle.  Anyone who has seen ""Deception"" knows Bette had luxurious long hair in this film.  But these are such picayune details that hardly matter.

What matters are the films themselves.  My favorite Davis film of all time is here, ""All This and Heaven Too"".  This is often an overlooked Davis film, mostly because the histrionics that Bette had patented by this time are kept to a minimum due to the sympathetic nature of her character.  It is film-making at its very finest based on the true story of a governess and her implication in the murder of her mistress by her husband the Duc De Pralin played outstandingly by Charles Boyer.  Anyone who cannot love Davis in this film has no heart.

THe next gem is ""The Old Maid"".  Davis really tears your heart out in this one and the music score is superb!!  To have her real-life nemesis, Miriam Hopkins with her is a plus and to watch them emote together each trying to outdo the other is fun to watch.

""In This Our Life"" is Davis at her over-acting hammiest.  The film is fun to watch and probably contains the most evil performance Bette ever turned out on celluloid.  One of my favorites.

""Deception"" reunites her with her ""Now Voyager"" co-stars Paul Henried and Claude Rains who manages to steal the picture.  The music here is an added bonus and film is another of Davis' underrated gems.

""The Great Lie"" is pure soap but is entertaining nonetheless.  Again the picture is stolen by Mary Astor who won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar of 1941 for her role in this.

""Watch on the Rhine"" has Bette taking a secondary role to Paul Lukas (The 1943 Best Actor Oscar winner)but the film is a tremendous testament to ""fascism"" and the evils of it explored thoroughly.  It is tense and biting.

This is a collection that shows Bette's acting at its finest with high production values in an era when the ""Woman's Picture"" dominated the movies and shows why she was queen of the Warner Bros. lot!

This collection is worth getting....pure Gold.  Now, how about a 4th Collection that would include:

Dangerous
The Sisters
Beyond the Forest
Juarez
A Stolen Life
A Catered Affair",1207267200,3,2943,4.567877629063098
3092867,5,B0012OX7DA,"Those incredible Bette Davis eyes are on display in this 6 disc example of her films ranging from 1939 to 1946. A young woman who becomes an ""old maid"", a noble governess, a good girl, a bad girl, a noble wife and a musician---she carries each film with her own brand of style. From dignified performances to all out histrionics, these films show Davis in all her glory when she was the Queen of Warner Brothers. Each disc is seperately packaged in a snap case with art work. The prints are fine with some mild scratching and speckling on some but only minor. A true collector's item. And a fine chance to see Mary Astor's Oscar winning performance in ""The Great Lie"". Enjoy.",1207094400,15,675,4.495934959349594
3092868,5,B0012OX7DA,"Of course I am giving this set five stars, even as I count this as the third Davis box set while numerous classic stars still have none (Shearer, Garson, Marion Davies, Jean Harlow, Constance Bennett, Miriam Hopkins).  And although the selection of titles in this set leaves a lot to be desired, all of these movies will make welcome and enjoyable additions to your DVD library! Let's face it-- Davis never made an unwatchable film.

Let's start out with DECEPTION, because this is the most exciting title here. It's just a lot of fun. It's later Davis slightly after her peak, but before anyone had guessed it. The production values are absolutely lavish. She was competing with Crawford in glamour here, and in that respect it is a 'movie star' performance. Bette is photographed by Ernie Haller with panache and she never looked more beautiful. Her performance is good, but the story lets her down. It's actually fluff, and plays out like a soap opera, but it's one of the most prestigious productions of the decade. You can tell a lot of money was poured into this, and although it fails, you will love every minute of it. This makes an excellent double feature with Crawford's HUMORESQUE: both were melodramas with stunning classical music sequences. A highlight of this one is the great Claude Rains, who is always excellent opposite Davis. 7/10

THE GREAT LIE is a potboiler. Davis walks through the picture rather harmlessly, while Mary Astor chews the scenery to shreds. The plot is completely ridiculous and unbelievable. It's an over-the-top, over-produced yarn with a lifeless and dull story at its heart. 4/10

THE OLD MAID is a quiet gem starring Davis and Miriam Hopkins. Their performances hold the picture together. It's a bittersweet story with engaging leads and a lovely production. Recommended. 7/10

IN THIS OUR LIFE is sort of hit-and-miss. While Huston's direction is solid, the film loses its credibility because of Davis' overbearing performance as a femme fatale. Although made during the period of Davis' best work (NOW VOYAGER, THE LETTER), this is one of her lesser performances. It is an example of blatant overacting on her part, made all the more apparent in contrast to the subtle underplaying of Olivia De Havilland., who gives a superb performance. The film has a very interesting civil rights angle and was one of the first to show the effects of prejudice on African Americans in the legal system. This segment of the film is effective. 6/10

Overall, not a spectacular set, but a good collection of Davis' lesser-known films. There are some gems to be found here, and also some duds. Explore at your own risk, but you certainly will not regret this purchase if you love classic films.",1202860800,4,2723,4.883116883116883
3092869,3,B0012OX7DA,"It's wonderful news for all fans of bette davis to hear of the release of her third box set with all-new DVD releases of her movies. I am especially happy to finally have one of her most beloved films The Old Maid on DVD. The wonderful chemistry of the two lead actresses Davis and Miriam Hopkins is genial and the dialogue exquisite. My favorite part of the movie is towards the end when Charlotte tells Delia that she will tell Clementina that she is her real mother(right before her wedding day) and Hopkins tells her "" Charlotte, you Ahh Wicked!"" My biggest complaint for this DVD is that they failed to do a Commentary for this great film. I guess they felt that since they did one on Old Acquaintance, it wasn't necessary, but I think there is so much to talk about in this film about Davis and Miriam and about the fantastic year this movie was made And released: 1939, and also how it stood in terms of the three other Davis releases of that year.
Anyways, i am also happy about In this our life, the Great lie, and ATAHT. I have seen ""watch on the rhine"" and although its a a good movie, its not really a Davis vehicle. I think that there are so many other movies that could have easily been greater showcase choices, such as DANGEROUS, where she won her first Oscar. Although it isn't a great movie, its a fascinating Davis performance. Other choices are BEyond the FOrest, one of her most underrated and nowadays most requested movies to be released on DVD, and  A Stolen Life, where we get 2 Davis sharing screen time. The inclusion of DECEPTION is still debatable to me. I think that the movie isn't great and its more of a Claude Rains film, but still i am glad they included this one and not the super boring the Corn is Green.

Now, I am also glad that there is another davis box coming right after this one which brings us a much-deserved two disc dvd for All about eve and a special edition of Hush Hush Sweet charlotte. It brings us new releases of the Virgin Queen, not a great movie, but with a great Davis performance opposed Joan Collins. Also, the highly campy the Nanny, if anything is good to have a few laughs and its way better than the dull the Anniversary. The only odd choice is Phone Call from a Stranger, but i guess FOx didn't own many Davis titles, so there isn't much they could do.
Finally along with these great releases, we will get the US POST OFFICE STAMP For BETTE DAVIS, and all i can say is that very happy to see that BETTE DAVIS is well celebrated for her centenary celebration with these marvellous well deserved tributes.",1202342400,9,2569,4.372384937238493
3092870,4,B0012OX7DA,"Well ok, this is the third volume of the Bette Davis collection and granted, I was so happy when I saw a link on amazon and found out there was going to be one, but the movies in this box are all from the late 30s and early 40s, so average wonderful actress Bette Davis. However I thought a great occasion for these collections was to include rare and/or early movies that fewer people would bother buying as stand-alones. There is no early Bette Davis movie here. It's a wasted opportunity. I would have gladly sacrificed Watch On The Rhine for something else, although that disc surprisingly includes yet another Bette Davis documentary that was not available on home video and now is :-) (it includes some interviews of hers I haven't seen anywhere else).",1201910400,9,758,4.622222222222222
3092871,5,B0012OX7DA,"This set contains six films, all new to DVD in celebration of the 100th anniversary of Bette Davis' birth. Here we are on the third DVD boxed set of Bette Davis films by Warner Home Video, and we are still getting A List properties. The details are as follows:

In This Our Life (1942) - In my opinion this is one of Davis' best films, yet TCM will show ""Jezebel"" ten times a year and never show this one. Davis and Olivia De Haviland play sisters. Davis runs off with her sister's husband right before she herself is to be married. As time passes, her ex-fiance falls for De Haviland's character, and they decide to be married. When the husband Davis absconded with kills himself, Davis returns home and decides she wants her ex-fiance back. This film spotlights the kind of scenery-chewing role that Davis excelled at. Extra features include:
Commentary by film historian Jeannine Basinger
Vintage newsreel
Technicolor patriotic short: March On, America!
Technicolor musical short: Spanish Fiesta
Classic cartoon: Who's Who in the Zoo
Trailers of In This Our Life and 1942's Desperate Journey
Subtitles: English & Franais (main feature only)

The Old Maid (1939) - Davis and Miriam Hopkin play cousins. Hopkins is the belle-of-the-ball type who is marrying a well-off man to spite her colorful yet poor suitor that she in fact still harbors deep feelings for. Davis plays Charlotte, the pretty but quiet type who comforts the ex-suitor after Hopkins rejects him. The rejected suitor then goes off to fight in the Civil War and is killed. Years later, as Charlotte is planning her own wedding, her cousin finds out that Charlotte had an illegitimate child by her ex-beau. Her retribution ruins Charlotte's life and yet binds her to Charlotte forever. Extra features include:
Vintage newsreel
Technicolor historical short: Lincoln in the White House
Howard Hill sports short: Sword Fishing
Classic cartoons: The Film Fan and Kristopher Kolumbus
Trailers of The Old Maid and 1939's Confessions of a Spy
Subtitles: English & Franais (main feature only)

All This and Heaven Too (1940)
Davis plays Henriette, a governess to children whose wealthy parents are unhappily married. When the Duke (Charles Boyer) falls in love with Henriette, the angry wife dies a death that appears to be murder. The Duke and Henriette are instantly under suspicion, which is made no better when the Duke dies by his own hand. This leaves Henriette to face the questioning authorities alone. This film features a kinder, gentler, softer Bette Davis than roles she often played. Extra features include:

Subtitles: English & Franais (main feature only)

The Great Lie (1941)
Another pairing of Davis with George Brent, a leading man with whom she had such great chemistry. George Brent plays Peter, a man who marries  concert pianist Sandra (Mary Astor) on an alcohol-induced lark. He really loves Maggie (Bette Davis), and repents at leisure. The marriage turns out not to be legal, Peter goes back to Maggie and marries her, and then disappears in the South American jungle while on an aviation expedition for the government. After Peter's disappearance Sandra discovers she is pregnant with Peter's child - something she doesn't want at all but Maggie desperately does. Extra features include:

Subtitles: English & Franais (main feature only)

Deception (1946)
A rather odd but good film. Davis plays pianist Christine Radcliffe who is separated from her great love, cellist Karel Novak (Paul Henreid), by World War II. She presumes he is dead and has had an affair with wealthy and unstable composer Alexander Hollenius (Claude Rains). Karel reappears after the war and he and Christine marry, but she can't shake the spectre of Hollenius who continues to torment her. Hollenius' character could have resulted in over-the-top camp in the hands of a lesser actor, but Rains makes the role work. Extra features include:

Watch on the Rhine (1943)
Sara (Bette Davis) and Kurt Muller (Paul Lukas) and their three children are returning to her mother's home in Washington DC after 18 years in Europe where Kurt was working for the underground resistance. However, even in his mother-in-law's American home, Kurt can't escape those who would like to do him harm for the work he did in Europe. Extra features include:

3092894,5,B0012OX7DA,"The movie starts out slow, and I'm afraid it's going to be a real bore - especially since the plot is rather straightforward and seemingly predictable. Bette Davis stars. The plot begins with her finding her lost true love on stage, performing on the cello. They meet, she invites him to her supposedly 'starving artist' wage apartment, where he quickly realizes there's another big source of funding to account for her furs, expensive art collection, and spacious rooms with a view to die for. Suspicious, he asks some questions and becomes suspicious that another man is keeping her.

Bette manages to change to topic, and they're quickly married. At the party, he meets the true source of her secret funding, a maniacal genius composer (Claude Rains) who makes himself obnoxious making insinuating remarks aimed at Bette. Rains then hatches a plot to embarrass Bette's new husband in the guise of helping him. Then he takes his sinister planning to an even higher level - intending to publicly expose Bette's past with him during the after-concert party. But Bette has other plans, and the ending is a bit of a surprise.",1431734400,5,1123,4.910526315789474

While I've seen a moderate amount (certainly not as much as some of you most serious and dedicated cinephiles) of Claude's work , nothing could have prepared me for his flamboyant and amazing turn as the enormously gifted , wholly unpredictable and exceptionally brilliant music composer at the core of this project .
While Bette Davis and to an equal extent Paul Henreid are excellent in service of a fine but somewhat tricky script that requires odd pauses and swift and peculiar emotional contortions on both their parts , Rains stumbles over no such obstacles . Mr. Rains ought to have been nominated for best actor in this year for this performance . I'll look and see . In my book he deserved that award hands down . What a master .

3092923,5,B0012OX7DA,"This would be a perfect film if it weren't for the ending which is very oddly constructed and quite unbelievable.  But never mind that.

Davis is gritty and edgy and always has me feeling she is going to come totally unglued at any moment, never matter how many times I see it.  Of course she eventually succumbs to her torments and commits a murder which clip is often played in her many biopics.  Henreid is equally temperamental and acts like he might self-combust as well.

But Claude Rains.  Rains is menacing, eccentric and gives a genius of a performance.  If you love Claude Rains and have not seen this movie, it is a must.  To me it is his picture.

Set in New York which is always a fab backdrop.

I would love to have Davis' apartment in this movie.  She has paid a high price for it.

Get it, rent it, see it.",1406332800,3,822,4.266233766233766
3092924,5,B0012OX7DA,"Deception has very little plot- a cellist named Karel Novak (Paul Henreid) suddenly appears in New York after being assumed dead by Christine Radcliffe (Bette Davis_) a concert pianist-piano teacher. He had been the love of her life, but in the long interim, Christine had become the mistress of Alexander Hollenius, a composer- acerbic, witty, a character much more interesting than the somewhat leaden Karel. In typical fashion Davis wrings her hands and agonizes all over the place trying to convince Karel that Alex was simply a fellow musician, not her lover. Well, Karel does smell a rat as Christine swans about in a gorgeous New York penthouse replete with priceless antiques, all donated by Hollenius and hardly obtainable on a music teacher's modest salary. But Christine does her darndest to prove to Karel that's she's pure as the driven snow and certainly not, God forbid, a man's mistress. She and Karel marry and Alex becomes the puppeteer, pulling strings of his own invention by manipulating Karel, upsetting Christine and having a jolly time doing so. He steals the show with that sardonic smirk, those expressive black eyebrows, pure ham and pure delightful.

This 1948 black and white film is beautifully and imaginatively  photographed. While the film is not really a noir one, it is atmospheric, and you may feel your own hair is getting wet during a sullen, foggy rainy New York night. How the trick of making Henreid magnificently play the cello, with the usual facial grimaces players on stringed instruments are well known for,  the left hand fingers plucking those vibrating strings, the right hand making the bow sing I can't imagine. (I am reminded of Cary Grant convincingly playing the harp in The Bishop's Wife).

The funniest scene in the film occurs when Hollenius takes Christine and Karel to a fancy restaurant for a pre-concert dinner. Alex proceeds to be the ultimate gourmet, endlessly discussing entrees, sauces, truffles and the like, enthralling the waiters. At one point a waiter brings by a large platter of something. Alex picks up a tiny dead bird- a lark, maybe- and even smells it. He chatters away endlessly in French, opining that no woodcocks are available. His two guests grow more and more sullen as Alex carries out his little performance.

To modern audiences, Christine's little charade of not being Alex's lover seems extremely over-wrought. Perhaps people were more innocent in 1946. However, Deception is well worth watching, especially seeing Bette Davis at the top of her form. They don't make them like Bette Davis any more.",1405382400,6,2586,5.046838407494145

Betty is divine, as always.  Her opposite, the man of her dreams, is a bit like a Zombie character, can't seem to hold it together and you find that you really don't care if he falls over the bannister or gets stuck in the elevator for the rest of the movie.

3092939,3,B0012OX7DA,"Deception starts out like a noir melodrama, with Bette Davis running through darkened streets to a theater where she arrives late to view the performance of cellist Paul Henreid. Her eyes fill with tears, and we wait to find out why. When she goes backstage after the performance, we discover the pair were lovers in Germany before the war, and got separated.

Bette, a pianist, believing Henreid dead, came to America in the interim and embarked on an affair with her musical mentor Hollenius (a delightfully wicked Claude Raines). Bette now lives in New York City where Hollenius has installed her in a deluxe penthouse apartment, adorned her in furs and filled her living space with expensive art and furnishings.

This gives Bette some serious explaining to do when she and Henreid go to her apartment after the performance. But instead of being honest and telling Henreid about the affair, Bette decides to deceive him (hence the title) and tells him that the opulence of her apartment was made possible by tutoring rich music students.

Although it's an implausible plot contrivance (since apparently the entire city and music community knows of their affair, to say nothing of expecting Hollenius to pretend no such affair happened), we must excuse it because without this contrivance, there would be no story. For Hollenius , upon discovering her plan to ditch him and marry Henreid, realizes the power of the bargaining chip he holds. As long as she is not willing to tell Henreid of the affair, Hollenius can control her, blackmail and extort anything he wants from her by threatening to reveal it.

And so he does. He informs Davis that she belongs to him, although he will permit her this folly of a marriage and relationship. However, she will continue to secretly be his concubine (for all practical purposes) while he does everything possible to emasculate and destroy her new husband.

To explain why Davis doesn't just tell Henried she had the affair (which he already suspects anyway) and get it over with, the writers have given Henreid a convenient (for plot purposes) streak of insane jealousy (he actually STRANGLES her when he first sees her apartment, rightly believing it to have been paid for in sexual favors). So we can rather forgive Davis for not wanting to be strangled again.  (Imagine this device being used today for a male character who is supposed to be ""Mister Right""!)

What keeps ""Deception"" from being an unpleasant and uncomfortable film to watch is the underlying black humor which pervades the proceedings. Despite it's grandly operatic look and feel, the film is not entirely a serious one. It's a bit of a satire about the ridiculous situations people put themselves in when they refuse to tell the truth. Raines especially has fun with his role as the wicked puppet-master, and even tells Davis at one point, ""why don't you just tell him the truth? Your lie has given me everything I need to control you!"" But Bette sticks by her guns--literally, as it turns out--and if you are a Davis fan you will likely have fun watching her navigate this polished but slightly absurd film to its suitably melodramatic conclusion.",1388707200,2,3163,4.9009345794392525

3092962,3,B0012OX7DA,"Hey, I like a soft touch egg head thriller as well as the next guy but this one, this ""highbrow"" thing, Deception, left me cold, cold as old Claude Rains at the end. It was not that Bette Davis played, well, Bette Davis with those Bette Davis eyes (and other iconic moves) just a little too dramatically over the top as a head over heels in love budding pianist mooning over a lost love cellist in post-war Mayfair swells New York (World War II for those keeping score on the which war issue). It was not that Paul Henreid, last seen by this writer as the heroic resistance leader Victor Laszlo trying to get some damned letters of transit out of hole-in-the- wall Casablanca in the film of the same name in order to beat the Nazis in Europe, as that smitten cellist who had lost a step or two with his nerves all frayed after being cooped up in that aforementioned Nazi-occupied Europe. And it certainly was not Claude Rains, also last seen by this reviewer in that same film walking in some fogged-in hole- in- the- wall Casablanca airfield arm and arm with Humphrey Bogart after helping old Victor Laszlo break out to lead Europe back to civilization, as a world famous composer with a penchant for New Yorker magazine-induced high camp elite chatter, or what passed for it in those days. No, it was not the performances of these fines actors per se  but the flow of the plot line that as it slowly and melodramatically unfolded made me hope, hope to high heaven, that someone, and that someone being Claude Rains, would end up as cold as I felt about half way through this one.

Let me explain and see if you agree. Christine (played by Bette Davis), an aspiring pianist, who was being, well, let me put this gently, being ""kept"" by the eminent composer Hollenius (played by Rains) who lavished her with gifts and other expensive odds and ends for her favors. Nothing usual there and as we are all adults we know, or should know, this stuff happens all the time to Mayfair swells and mean street thugs. What upsets this nice arrangement is that an old beau, Karel (played by Henreid), a struggling but up and coming cellist in pre-war Europe  whom was presumed by Christine to be dead shows up in New York right after the war trying to make a new start. Christine finds out, and wants to start up that old flame thing they had when they were young and struggling in that lost pre-war European night. All this though without telling him anything but lies about her sugar daddy Hollenius. Not a good idea.

The rest of the film centers on the tension between this trio as Karel runs to fits of confusion and jealousy over Christine's relationship with Hollenius. Hollenius is furious, and profusely and verbally at wits end, over Christine's tossing him, a great world renown composer, over for some two bit caf musician. A subplot has Hollenius toying with the lovebirds by offering Karel a cello work compose by him that can either make or break him in the highbrow music world. And Christine, well, Christine is trying to keep her past a secret from Karel at any price. That is the deception and it is played out until the merciful end when she off-handedly shot old Hollenius when he, very ungentlemanly-like, threatened, or maybe threatened, to expose the whole show. Of course this whole star-crossed lovers scene could have been averted if Christine had just come clean but no she had to play with fire, and play with it until the end. See what I mean though about not getting very weepy over this melodrama.",1348358400,,3517,4.568938193343898
3092963,4,B0012OX7DA,"I love this movie but on the face of it I feel a little ridiculous saying I love it because the plot as it is executed is borderline ridiculous. Here's a quick summary. A piano teacher named Christine Radcliffe is being mentored by conductor Alexander Hollenius. Christine's clothes are fabulous. Her apartment is luxe. Her furs and jewelry are great. Hmm, do I smell a rat here? Isn't she a poor teacher and presumably without a well padded family? Doesn't the great Hollenius seem a tad too possessive? Well, without much time to process everything Christine's lost love Karel Novak (Henried) who was presumed dead suddenly surfaces. A fellow musician and composer who has just barely survived life in Europe during WWII, Karel is sick and emotionally frail. Christine is going to be his muse and help him regain his confidence by getting Hollenius to help him present his music. Presumably Christine and Karel will then head off in the sunset and a life of artistic success. Wait, not so fast. Hollenius doesn't see it that way since Christine is his mistress and that is where all the goodies that Christine enjoys are coming from. Of course, if Karel finds out he'll be devastated. What transpires next is a cat and mouse game between Christine and Hollenius. Forget Henried's Karel who is merely window dressing. It is a terrified and desperate Christine pitted against the manipulative, deliberately cruel, angry, and very imperious Hollenius. Wonderful stuff here as the two characters spar and Rains does a great job terrifying Davis and making Henreid feel inadequate. Rains is the big fat cat primed to pummel the mouse Davis. The ending is predictable, but that is not the point. Davis and Rains are so good that even a mediocre plot can't keep them down. This is potent stuff and stands as evidence as to how good these actors were. On top of it all, this movie has a wonderful score by Erich Wolfgang Korngold and is photographed in glorious black and white with moody shadows that makes it real cinema noir stuff.
While the repairing of Davis, Rains, and Henreid isn't as successful as their previous outing in Now Voyager which was a vastly superior story, this film is a 5* film for Davis and Rains' performances and 3* for a just o.k. script.",1342137600,3,2260,4.782608695652174
3092964,5,B0012OX7DA,"""Deception"" is a lot better than my wife and I expected.  Sure, Bette Davis plays her usual self--on the verge of a temper tantrum at any time.  And the ending is rather far-fetched.  But the story line is captivating, especially for anyone with an interest in classical music, musicians, composers, or other artistic geniuses.  We feel it's not right to lump this movie into the category of ""film noir,"" since it is really more of a psychological thriller.  Moreover, the film lacks the rough-edged dialogue we usually associate with film noir classics, like ""Casablanca"" or ""Double Indemnity.""  In short, the movie seems far ahead of its time in how characters are developed and the intelligent interactions between them.

Paul Henreid is very good as the romantic lead, opposite the volcanic Ms. Davis.  Nevertheless, the performance of Claude Rains as the temperamental composer and millionaire impressario, is what steals the show.  Mr. Rains develops a truly hateful, egotistical character to the point where you want something really bad to happen to him.  Of course, it does, but without spoiling the climax, it would be best for other viewers to see for themselves.

It's been reported that this was the first movie Bette Davis did for Warner Bros. that actually lost money.  Too bad, but one can see why.  The movie, directed by Irving Rapper, seems so out of place when compared to other films of the time.  But that may be its main attraction.  Now, we want to see the earlier film where the same leading actors and Mr. Rapper combined for a more successful outcome.  That film is entitled, ""Now, Voyager,"" and should be a good one.

Summing up, ""Deception"" is far better than the reviews and summaries suggest.  It affords a glimpse into the private lives of musical prima donnas and other artistic geniuses.  We didn't expect to give it five stars, but it really deserves that.",1341187200,,1891,4.889937106918239
3092965,4,B0012OX7DA,"I buy these collections because they give you your favorite star on demand. In this instance, this six film collection might be called the Suffering Bette Collection if it weren't for the inclusion of In This Our Life. These movies are all good, though some tanked at the box office.
Here is a breakdown of what you get in this package.
The Old Maid is a Civil War melodrama. Bette manages to have a one time fling with George Brent before he toddles off to the battlefield. However, he left her a gift to remember him with. He impregnated her. Of course, Brent is killed and Bette allows her cousin to raise her child with her cousin's children. Drama ensues and who better for Bette to tangle with than her cousin (Miriam Hopkins). This is a fairly typical WB melodrama, but Bette and Miriam are great when the feathers fly. George Brent is great eye candy. It's easy to understand why Bette gave up her virtue.
All This And Heaven, Too is set in 19th century France. Bette is a nanny to the Duke and Duchess du Presline. The Dutchess is a shrew and the Duke (Charles Boyer) is attracted to Bette who is gentle and kind and great with the children. A scandal ensues and there are no winners in this one. It's not all downhill for Bette. She gets solace from the Rev. Henry Fielding(Jeffrey Lynn).
The Great Lie proves that life can be complicated. Bette's daredevil husband (George Brent) is presumed dead. His ex-wife (Mary Astor) who probably has the shortest lived marriage on record turns up pregnant and doesn't want the baby which will hamper her career as a concert pianist. Bette takes on the baby as her own and then her husband turns up very much alive and as handsome as ever. Bette and Mary hog the screen in this one and both play off each other with gusto.
Watch On The Rhine is WWII propaganda at its best. Bette is an American returning home after 2 decades to DC to her wealthy family with her freedom fighter husband (Paul Lukas) and three kids with odd accents. Lots of intrigue and nazis abound. Based on a stage play and very well done.
In This Our Life has Bette stealing her sister's (Olivia De Havilland) husband (Dennis Morgan). This story has Bette as an evil slut who is selfish and mean and shows absolutely no remorse. There are subtle hints of incest. Will evil Bette get hers in the end? this is rather heavy handed in the drama department, but Bette is a hoot as a southern charmer named Stanley.
Deception has Bette as a concert pianist who has been having an illicit relationship with her mentor Hoelenius (Claude Rains). Her husband (Paul Henried) who is a musician, escapes the nazis and reunites with Bette. Bette thinks she can escape an enraged Hoelenius, but can she? This one bombed in the theaters, but the cat and mouse game Rains and Davis play is interesting and tense.
If you like Bette Davis, this set will be a good fit. The fims offer a lot of drama and good supporting players and are great when you need a Bette Davis fix.",1334707200,,2975,4.480662983425415

He acts circles around Bette much like Mary Astor blew Bette out of the water in The Great Lie...BUT in my fantasy world William Wyler would have directed Bette in this and it would have been so much better!! When Rains confesses how badly he misses her Bette just looks annoyed...If Wyler had directed her he would have pulled the shame and guilt and dirtiness out of her! For this viewer Bette just phoned it in in this performance..But Rains, what a delight...I've seen so many Bette Davis movies and I can't think of one where the GUY out acts her!

3092969,5,B0012OX7DA,"I have loved Claude Rains since my childhood in the 80s, having seen films like ""Casablanca"" and ""Now, Voyager"".  ""Deception"" is, hands down, his finest moment in film.  Alexander Hollenius is commanding; witty; sexy; bitchy; masterful; hilarious; cunning; passionate and even a bit terrified when backed into a corner.  Any review of this film will mention the restaurant scene and indeed, he plays it to perfection.  His entrance in the film is pure magic and I triple dog dare you to take your eyes off of him once he has graced the screen.  Marvel as Claude drains Bette of her soul (after rehearsing his concerto) and proceeds to figuratively bash her over the skull with it.

Claude's character is often referred to as evil in this picture; like JR Ewing, you love to hate him.  Yet I don't hate him.  His actions after being tossed aside by Bette Davis for... Paul Henreid?... are completely believable (what does that say about me?).  Henreid's character is so wimpy, so violent and so BORING I constantly wonder what his appeal is.

I watched this picture everyday for a month after receiving my copy.

Claude's crowing moment:  As Bette Davis enters his dining room, working a gown as ONLY she CAN, Claude says, ""You look positively magnificent, I'd better remain seated.""

3092971,4,B0012OX7DA,"This is where we see an amazing performance by the one and only BETTE DAVIS!

SPOILER: Here's the story:
Bette is a pianist-Christine Radcliffe. It is post-war in the world of musicians. Bette sees the orchestral performance of her long lost love Karel Novak. Karel comes to Christine's HUGE and luxurious apartment and sees expensive curios. How did she get those? Then he hears that she knows Alexander Hollenius (the great composer) and here the suspicion begins. The truth is that during the war-Christine let Hollenius support her. Karel has a fiery temper--we find that out when he shakes her violently by the shoulder--and Christine is afraid of telling the truth. Hollenius uses his wit too drive Karel up a wall. Christine is getting mad and nervous that Alex will let the cat out of the bag and shoots him. Finally, Christine tells the truth to Karel in a tearful confession. Karel tells her not to tell the police but BETTE replies with ""we could never be happy knowing"" and ""I just can't live a lie"". And so it ends.

The rundown:
Bette is superb by acting with a tainted innocence. She leaves you liking her but she still uses her famous Bette-venom, especially when she talks to Hollenius. This movie flaunts Miss Davis's ability to act with discretion and subtlety but yet with flamboyancy and creative drama. Then, there comes Claude Rains. He is all wit and sarcasm and is a delight to see. He and Bette are what make the movie-they are foils--literary opposites. She: shy but protective but strong, and he: the all-knowing one (in the case of her deception) and sly but sarcastic and laughing. Our third actor is Paul Henreid. In this movie, is is very annoying as he is supposed to be. You find it hard to believe that Bette would want to be with this ruthless, suspicious cello player- but then that's what you call a movie.
Erich Korngold Wolf's score is superb, brilliant classical music with a stimulating and suspenceful edge.
The movie plot itself would be a 3 out of 5 had it not been for Miss Daivs and Mr. Rains. The movie is a little slow-paced and dreary but still a little suspenceful. The best parts are when the frantic Christine is battling it out with the mocking Hollenius.
Although it can be boring to a I-only-watch-fast-paced-thriller-movies or I-don't-like-old-movies crowds, it is a wonderful performance to see if you are a Bette fan or like watching good quality acting.",1298073600,,2413,4.756563245823389

3092980,5,B0012OX7DA,"This collection gives us The Old Maid, seldom seen before VHS and this DVD. This film conyains one of Miss Davis' greatest performances, as she enters into the very heart of what a loveless life can do, to a young woman, and finnaly an older woman, living in a house with a cousin who caused so much of her loneliness.

Deception has Miss Davis squaring off with Claude Rains in a series of scenes very suspenseful and very dark in mood and setting. It is not to be missed.

The others are great: Watch on the Rhine is spectacular, with an ending that truly shocks and moves one.

All This and Heaven Too, is Boyer's best., as Miss Davis draws him out of his ""Take me to the Cassbah"" routine. Her performance is subtle, compressed, as the character she portrays undergoes a harrowing series of rejections.

The Great Lie has Bette Davis face off with Mary Astor, both in top form, battleing for the same lover, a very strange George Brent. Catch Hattie MacDaniel as the ever perceptive maid, and the explosive western retreat scene, between Mary Astor and Bette Davis, as they encounter each other in the midst of dust storms, no lights, and no creature comforts of any kind!

In this Our Life directs us to the racism so prevalent in Hollywood and everywhere else. Bette Davis hits the marks with a portrayal of blistering madness, off set by Olicvia DeHavilland's cool, moody reactions. The racisl issue is very daring, and the ending will surprise you!

3092985,3,B0012OX7DA,"At the start of her career downturn at Warner Bros. until she was saved by Joseph Mankiewicz casting her at the last minute for her definitive role of Margo Channing in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-About-Eve/dp/B0012KSUTU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All About Eve</a>, Bette Davis played one of her most morally puerile characters as Christine Radcliffe, a classical pianist who is unexpectedly reunited with the love of her life, cellist Karel Novak, whom she took for dead, while carrying on as the ""protg"" of renowned composer Alexander Hollenius. Note the fancy, spacious apartment she can supposedly afford on a piano teacher's paltry wages. Had Christine shown any common sense, she would have told Karel within the first five minutes of their passionate embrace, gotten slapped for her supposed infidelity and then she would have been forgiven with violins swooning in the background. However, that would have made this 1946 Baroque-level soaper about seven minutes long. Instead, as directed by Irving Rapper in overly emphatic style, we get to watch Davis wrench her hands and get all tight-lipped as she tries to convince the tirelessly jealous Karel that she and Alex are merely good friends. Ha!

When Alex is not spending his time seething in a jealous rage, he is busy manipulating the nerves of poor Karel, whom Alex has suspiciously chosen to play the spotlight cello solo in his new concerto. The movie's most amusing scene is when the three go out for a pre-performance dinner as Alex plays the world's most pretentious diner in front of the increasingly exasperated lovers. The tension of Charlotte's deception leads to a melodramatic finish that recalls earlier Davis' vehicles, but this time for the weakest of reasons.

While Henried grapples with Karel's anger management issues, Rains easily steals the picture as the erudite composer.

3092987,4,B0012OX7DA,"Here is Bette Davis playing Christine Radcliff doing what she does best: Weaving a complicated web, trying to love a man while keeping a business realtionship with another, being a martyr and looking flawless every moment. No wonder she had temper fits, anyone with half the load would faint too, and often.

Bette is in love with a musician. She actually is one herself and has an energetic moment at the piano of such riveting misplaced energy that it alone suffices for a reason to see and appreciate the film. This musician, Paul Henreid, who plays Karel Novak , has been trying to get to America to escape the war for a long time and in that long interlude while living in NY City, Bette was compelled to find a 'protector' who could pay for her five mink coats, her stunning penthouse apartment and the delightful trinkets in it, which include a Picasso that would be more than 30 million today, a Tang horse, a very expensive piano and every shape and size of silver candelabra that can illuminate the huge space. Obviously we suspect something is wrong when she tells him she has been able to get all of this with music lessons and the 'gifts' that her rich, untalented students lavish on her patient tutoring. Anyone even with no knowledge of NY real estate would have been floored by the kind of money it takes to get an appartment like hers, but somehow he is in denial and does not see it right away, though he later on gets insanely jealous enough to make up for it.  Claude Rains, who played the martyr husband with her in ""Mr. Skeffington"" here is an eccentric composer aptly named Alexander Hollenius and her benefactor. We are supposed to think that she had a 'past' with him until the very moment the musician,arrives finally into her life, but this is a misunderstanding. The reality, as I see it, is that Christine has been playing the role of mistress to cover up in high society,  the fact that Hollenius is gay. This movie is therefore much better understood as a battle between two temperamental, musically talented, and emotionally challenged Queens. As a matter of fact it is only from this perspective that a lot of its nuance and brilliance can be appreciated.

This would explain, for example, her exquisite clothes and decor. No regular Joe could have come up with that unique mix of Chinese and Modern that is still a standard of excellence in decorating interiors of traditional wealthy apartments in this city. Hollenius looks and acts always as if on the verge of snapping. He speaks with the impetuosity and mannerisms of a retired decorator who still has anguished nightmares about getting the right color for the living room or a great couturier who suffered endlessly over the placement of glitter in the collection's evening gowns. He tries to upstage Christine by showing up unannounced and late at her wedding, and wearing a gorgeous evening cape. He also cracks a glass and leaves in a huff, all very consistent with drag queen-competitive posturing. If we had any serious doubts about this reality and its interpretation, the scene in the restaurant is devastating proof: Hollenius is totally heinous in delaying the dinner, knowing fully well it is making the musician nervous about being late for the concert, and by torturing the French chefs into reciting the specials, offering gratituous commentary on alterations on the sauces and the choice of wines that would match each dish, each more impossible and extravagant than the last. His erudition and refinement of choice is fastidious to the point of hysteria. He enjoys the process because he is infatuated with the musician and wants to outshine and humilate Christine. The fact that he has written the concerto for the cello, the instrument that he plays, also points in that direction. It will all drive Christine to despair eventually, and presently to seething rage.
This is a Must-See for Bette Davis fans and for those interested in classical music performance, and early gay identity in Hollywood films.",1249862400,2,4011,4.817126269956459

3092989,5,B0012OX7DA,"It would be a unforgiveable deception to tell you that this Bette Davis, Paul Henreid, Claude Rains vehicle is anything but top rate glossy soap bubble popping high drama. A rainy day is the perfect time to watch this film, late afternoon when the light seems like it will last forever giving you that trapped in time feeling. This film evokes that effect through out. Wonderful light, and so much of it takes place in twilight, or in rain, and in the deepest inky night.

It may not be considered a film noir in the classic sense but it certainly, as shot by the incredible Ernest Haller; it looks like one and one of the most gorgeous of the style. It is more like a Woman's Noir with its story of a basically good woman driven by her deceptions to do bad things, very bad things.

  Without a shadow of a doubt this is one of Claude Rains most entertaining, sharp, insightfully and wicked performances. He is pure joy to watch as he manipulates each person he comes in contact with in the story. He is the rotten, jealous petrified hard center of this poison souffl&eacute;.  Bette Davis is wonderful of course and is dressed to the nines but what is remarkable to see is the fun she is having as she hands the film over to Mr.. Rains. They made so many wonderful films together and he is obviously someone she admired and loved to work with. She is strong and exciting in the role but she gets out of the way and lets him have his day.

  And yet beyond all of this there are two reasons I love this film.  It has a remarkable classic Hollywood score by Erich Wolfgang Korngold and features his now famous  ""Hollenius' Cello Concerto"" as well as music by Beethoven, Wagner and Schubert. The music is as much a star of the film as anyone else. And in the commentary you will learn how the magic of Hollywood was employed to make the non-musical Henreid play that violin and not look like he is trying to saw it in half, and that Bette Davis could indeed play the piano just as she does in the film.

Then there is the incredible and even inspiring set design. The loft that Davis lives in is forty years ahead of it time. It is an incredible set and must have inspired interior designers in some subliminal way over the years, for now in cities across America that look is so in vogue.  The industrial concrete walls and the slanted floor to ceiling glass wall overlooking the city juxtaposed with a mix of modern furniture and antiques. It is timeless decorating, visually magnificent, barren, cold and full of dark corners where secrets can be hidden. In short a perfect design for this film.

  If you are a Steve Martin fan see if you can spot the scene he borrowed from ""Deception"" so that he could act with Bette Davis in his very wonderful ""Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid.""  Whether working with Claude Rains or Steve Martin, Bette Davis lets both men shine as she casts her mega-watt star power over them.",1241740800,42,2911,4.413084112149533
3092990,4,B0012OX7DA,"DECEPTION is probably as good as a melodrama can be and still remain one. Bette Davis, Paul Heinreid, and Claude Raines reunite from NOW VOYAGER with Davis and Heinreid as unlikely lovers in a failed relation and Raines playing against type as an over the top megalomaniac whose hamminess stole each scene from Miss Davis, who usually did the stealing but in this case had to surrender to Raines' tsunamis of biting witticisms.  Miss Davis has a good life in post World War II New York as a music teacher who need not struggle with financial woes as she is the mistress of a very obnoxious but wealthy egotist.  Out of the clear blue sky her former lover (Heinreid) appears in a concert as a cellist. She had thought that he was killed during the war but there he is. As they hug each other in happiness, Heinreid quickly figures out that Davis' opulent living style could not come from her meager earnings as a piano tutor. Enter Raines as the jealous sugar daddy who is determined to crush their renewed vows as faithful lovers.  But it is the means of this crushing that elevate DECEPTION as a very high order of melodrama. Raines is loud, sarcastic, pushy, yet apologetic each time quite insincerely for all that.  A funny scene occurs in a fancy restaurant where Raines treats Davis and Heinreid to an expensive dinner. He first orders one meal, then changes his mind, orders another, changes his mind yet again, before deciding on HIS choice, knowing all the while that his delaying tactics are irritating them to no end. We can hardly understand why Davis was attracted to Heinreid in the first place. He is moody, volatile, even given to outbursts of abuse as he nearly chokes Davis in a fit of rage. The warm low key mutual attraction that they shared in NOW VOYAGER is nowhere here apparent.  By contrast, we can easily understand her attraction to Raines. His very qualities of aggressive mind tinkering have their peculiar lure to women who have known only lumpen clods like Heinreid. She even visits Raines one day after her marriage to Heinreid supposedly to demand that he cease to exhibit the very qualities of pushiness that she finds so alluring.  If Raines is the magnet and Davis the iron filings, then Heinreid is sticks of splinters that no one else seems to want. The plot is insane, of course. Only Hollywood writers could come up with such a melodrama, but we watch DECEPTION not for that but for the torrent of words and hand wringing that accompanies them. The ending which I shall not here reveal is total illogic, but by then, who cares about such mundane things like obvious evidence to a crime that the script writers leave hanging in the air. DECEPTION is a fine roller coaster of a film that proves yet again that a dearth of logic can easily be supplanted by a plethora of acting talent.  In this case, it was Claude Raines that is that plethora.",1239753600,3,2880,4.61328125

There are so many great and interesting movies by stars like Norma Shearer, Greer Garson, Susan Hayward, Jennifer Jones,to name a few,that could easily fill box sets. Yet, these stars continue to go mostly unrepresented, yet (taking nothing from her), Carmen Miranda has a set??? The latest Natalie Wood Collection is a prime example of the studios poor marketing strategies and blatant greed. Two re-issued classics, two new titles worth having and two who gives a s#@*% titles for nearly fifty bucks! Personally, I'm sticking with the copies of Gypsy & Splendor in the Grass I paid nearly $20 ea. for six years ago. I'm not buying this set to get Sex and the Single Girl & Inside Daisy Clover unless it's on sale for $24.99 Do they think we're morons?",1237680000,3,1477,4.662835249042145

3092997,4,B0012OX7DA,"DECEPTION has long been a favorite of Davis fans -- it's at the top of the list of her second-tier movies -- and this handsome DVD release, with Warners' usual impeccible mastering -- will undoubtedly win it new admirers.  Based on a melodramatic piece of boulevard claptrap, there's hardly a believable moment in the entire picture, and certainly nothing about the plot bears scrutiny -- from every character treating a worn and puffy Davis as though she's the cutest little trick in shoe leather within ten blocks of Carnegie Hall, to the deception of the title -- should her husband be able, as the plot would have it, to ignore evidence and common sense and believe all's innocent fun and games, surely someone in the classical music community where these folks run would be happy to clarify for him just how Bette got that mink?  But viewers should happily throw these questions aside and revel in one of the screen's great displays of ham run amok.  Davis, no slouch in the scenery-chewing department, is constantly upstaged here by Claude Rains, who relishes each innuendo and bon mot in John Collier's witty screenplay.  Erich Wolfgang Korngold's ripe score (with a marvelous cello concerto at its center) and Ernest Haller's brilliant cinematography (he was to capture another unforgettable Davis performance in BABY JANE) add to the film's pleasures.  Even the decor overacts -- Rains seems to living in the lobby of the Roxy.  This one's the GOTTERDAMMERUNG of women's pictures.  Irresistable fun.",1218412800,2,1508,5.008

Why did they have to put Watch On The Rhine in this set? A very tedious talky sactimonius piece of WWII propaganda, which is not even a Davis vehicle.  All This and Heaven Too although a box office success in it's day, is rather long and overdrawn. Why not have included Dangerous and Beyond The Forest in this set? Some out there may turn their noses up at the thought of these two films being included in a Bette Davis boxed set--indeed, even Davis admitted to hating these films--but her performances still hold up today, and would have made a good juxtiposition between the young Davis spitfire persona and her latter day turn at a no-holds barred middle-aged vixen.

In This Our Life: Bette Davis and Olivia De Havilland are a pair of priviledged sisters who can't get along, especially when Bette tries to cover up a murder.

Watch On the Rhine: This war-time film won Paul Lukas an Oscar for Best Actor, and features one of Bette's most personal monologues that she said set the tone for the rest of her life.

The Old Maid: The original pairing of Miriam Hopkins and Bette that had audiences crying in the theatre. It was one of the most profitable films of 1939.

The Great Lie: When Mary Astor won her Oscar for Best Supporting Actress she thanked Tchaikovsky and Bette Davis- and rightfully so. For once, Bette plays the good girl, while Astor plays the femme fatale with grand results.

Deception: The reunion of the ""Now Voyager"" cast (Claude Rains, Paul Henreid, Bette Davis) finds them embroiled in a deadly love triangle.

All This and Heaven Too: Warner Bros. answer to ""Gone With the Wind"" stars Bette Davis, Charles Boyer and Barbara O'Neil. When Bette becomes a governess to a well-to-do French family, she finds herself an accessory to murder.

These films are excellently restored and have wonderful special features. My only wish is that they hurry up with the 4th volume and are sure to include some of the most requested Davis films such as ""Beyond the Forest"", ""A Stolen Life"", or ""Cabin in the Cotton.""",1214611200,2,1459,4.765873015873016

3093003,4,B0012OX7DA,"""Deception"" was the last half decent Bette Davis vehicle from her glorious Warner Brother's years. Released in 1946, the film was based on a 2 character play called ""Jealousy"". Unfortunately, censorship robbed the film of credibility and the phoney ending just doesn't work as Davis herself recognised. Until then though, the film has some great features:

- an outstanding over the top performance by the great Claude Rains playing a composer/conductor named Hollenius. Rains, as Davis always acknowledged, steals the film.
- great sets, costumes and lighting creating a plush world among the operatic arty set in New York.

The DVD print is excellent and there are some good extras. The commentary is intriguing, carefully noting how the problems behind the scenes, including Davis's troubled private life (she was pregnant at the time) and insecurity about her looks contributed to the tension visible on the celluloid. There is a coloured short film about adventurers riding the Colorado river rapids and one set in Hollywood which puts together technicolour numbers from previous shorts dating back almost 10 years. Jane Wyman sings one of the songs and shows she was a competent singer. The cartoon is an hilarious gem as a mouse outwits Porky Pig. Don't miss when the mouse takes on a mechanical cat. This is animated perfection.  Lastly, there is the original trailer of the film plus another Davis opus, ""A Stolen Life"".

The DVD is excellent value and even better if purchased as part of the Davis Set Volume 3.",1210464000,8,1521,5.047808764940239
3093004,4,B0012OX7DA,"Since this is Volume 3 of the Bette Davis DVD sets, one would expect it to reach into the more controversial of her Warner Brother's legacy. Six films are included as follows:

- in 1939, possibly Davis's best year, ""The Old Maid"" paired her with the bitchy Miriam Hopkins in an emotional work out as a spinster who lives with her cousin who raises Davis's illegitimate daughter as her own. The film is very well made by Edmund Goulding and based on an Edith Wharton play but it was a dated yarn even in 1939.
- in 1940, ""All This and Heaven Too"" was filmed as Warner's rival production to ""Gone with the Wind"", a long and detailed film, the opposite of the normal gutsy Warner's product. Davis plays a governess in the unhappy home of Duke Charles Boyer and the film was based on fact.  It is a dull film but Davis underplays poignantly.
- in 1941, ""The Great Lie"" was an entertaining but absurd soap opera with fireworks from Oscar winning Mary Astor as Davis's rival for the affections of George Brent. This was one of the films which contributed to Davis's reputation for interference. She found the screenplay poor and worked with Astor to re-write it and give it some guts.
- in 1942, the controversial ""In This our Life"" was released with a thin Davis playing a southern gal wreaking havoc on all around her. The film has underlying themes of racism and incest and is well constructed.  Olivia De Havilland plays her sister and they make an interesting contrast. Davis is mannered and frenetic but it is not simple enough to dismiss her performance as such because she absolutely nails a bitch on heat.
- in 1943, ""Watch on the Rhine"", based on a very successful Broadway play, starred Paul Lukas in an Oscar winning performance as an anti fascist. Davis subdues her fireworks and matches Lukas with a warm and sympathetic portrayal of the wife who understands the reality of her husband's work. The film is stage bound and the children are awful but it is a worthwhile piece of history.
- 1946, Davis was pregnant and insecure and the overwrought ""Deception"" betrays her personal tensions. The film is high camp entertainment with an over the top Claude Rains as a conductor/composer. A plush melodrama, probably the last real Davis vehicle, what it lacks in credibility, mainly due to the censors, it makes up for in over the top dramatics.

The prints of all of the films are superb. All the disks contain Warner Brother's Night at the Movies, that entertaining program of cartoon, shorts and trailers - something for everyone. There are commentaries on 4 of the films - two good, one not so good and one dreadul. Janine Basinger gets better and better and her comments about ""In This Our Life"" are first rate. She also has a wry sense of humour which adds so much. The commentary for ""Deception"" is interesting because the commentator carefully points out how what went on behind the scenes, particularly Davis's personal life at this time, affected what can be seen on the celluloid. This is a good character study of Davis and her art. For ""All This in Heaven Too"", Daniel Bubbeo lost me in the first 10 minutes when he managed to completely repeat himself, almost word for word. He is wet in the worst sense. The commentator for ""Watch on the Rhine"" is a Lillian Hellman biographer and manages to talk almost entirely for the duration without mentioning the film. He also is a Claudette Colbert fan, including irrelevant stuff about Colbert, even going so far as to undermine Davis's famous performance in ""All About Eve"" when she replaced Colbert. This is a rotten commentary.

The set is excellent value.",1210291200,8,3620,4.676609105180534

I was somewhat disappointed by Paul Henried's role (he is usually a stronger character); Bette Davis could also have been better compared to other parts; on the other hand (and as stated in another review), Claude Rains is just excellent (he seems to be able to 'rise' above the mediocrity of a role) - this is a film about classical music, personalities, and deception (hence the tile) - well worth a watch; probably would have gone 3+*, if possible, but because of the actors decided on 4* - any film w/ Bette needs to be watched at least once - :-)",1208476800,3,614,4.531531531531532

And four (""All This and Heaven Too"", ""Watch on the Rhine"", ""Deception"", ""In This Our Life"") include commentary tracks!  Of the commentaries only ""Watch on the Rhine"" falls flat - dry as dust.  The others are lively and entertaining packed full of interesting tidbits.  I've never seen a Bette Davis movie I haven't enjoyed.  This set is a good example of Davis' range - the quality of her acting - the believablity of her characters - and the supporting casts are top notch!

3327362,3,B0012OX7DA,"This film was made by Iving Rapper with Bette Davis, Claude rains and Paul Henreid. It was merely a big flop for Bette, the second one in a row (and would be followed by one more, than finally her big comeback All About Eve).This film was made by the director of Now Voyager, and reunited some of the Now, Voyager cast. It wasn't a terribly good picture though. This print is very good ( as is all Warner Films) and you should have no trouble hearing or seeing it.",1208304000,2,464,4.224719101123595
3327363,5,B0012OX7DA,"To buy each of these films separately would cost on the average about $20.00 apiece.  This boxed set is a bargain at this price.  I ordered mine from Amazon and got it the next day (without having to pay fast shipping charges)!

As for the movies themselves they are all superb!  Bette Davis at her finest.  Great entertainment.  I can't add much to the description of what the films themselves contain as some other fine reviews here have already elaborated on quite nicely.

The only nit-picky thing I have to add is this:  On the cover art for the DVDs of ""Watch on the Rhine"" and ""Deception"" the Davis images are wrong.  On ""Watch on the Rhine"" cover it is clearly a still of Bette Davis from ""Now Voyager""; and on the cover for ""Deception"" the image of Bette is from ""A Stolen Life"" with the short dutch bob hairstyle.  Anyone who has seen ""Deception"" knows Bette had luxurious long hair in this film.  But these are such picayune details that hardly matter.

What matters are the films themselves.  My favorite Davis film of all time is here, ""All This and Heaven Too"".  This is often an overlooked Davis film, mostly because the histrionics that Bette had patented by this time are kept to a minimum due to the sympathetic nature of her character.  It is film-making at its very finest based on the true story of a governess and her implication in the murder of her mistress by her husband the Duc De Pralin played outstandingly by Charles Boyer.  Anyone who cannot love Davis in this film has no heart.

THe next gem is ""The Old Maid"".  Davis really tears your heart out in this one and the music score is superb!!  To have her real-life nemesis, Miriam Hopkins with her is a plus and to watch them emote together each trying to outdo the other is fun to watch.

""In This Our Life"" is Davis at her over-acting hammiest.  The film is fun to watch and probably contains the most evil performance Bette ever turned out on celluloid.  One of my favorites.

""Deception"" reunites her with her ""Now Voyager"" co-stars Paul Henried and Claude Rains who manages to steal the picture.  The music here is an added bonus and film is another of Davis' underrated gems.

""The Great Lie"" is pure soap but is entertaining nonetheless.  Again the picture is stolen by Mary Astor who won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar of 1941 for her role in this.

""Watch on the Rhine"" has Bette taking a secondary role to Paul Lukas (The 1943 Best Actor Oscar winner)but the film is a tremendous testament to ""fascism"" and the evils of it explored thoroughly.  It is tense and biting.

This is a collection that shows Bette's acting at its finest with high production values in an era when the ""Woman's Picture"" dominated the movies and shows why she was queen of the Warner Bros. lot!

This collection is worth getting....pure Gold.  Now, how about a 4th Collection that would include:

Dangerous
The Sisters
Beyond the Forest
Juarez
A Stolen Life
A Catered Affair",1207267200,3,2943,4.567877629063098

From dignified performances to all out histrionics, these films show Davis in all her glory when she was the Queen of Warner Brothers. Each disc is seperately packaged in a snap case with art work.

3327365,5,B0012OX7DA,"Of course I am giving this set five stars, even as I count this as the third Davis box set while numerous classic stars still have none (Shearer, Garson, Marion Davies, Jean Harlow, Constance Bennett, Miriam Hopkins).  And although the selection of titles in this set leaves a lot to be desired, all of these movies will make welcome and enjoyable additions to your DVD library! Let's face it-- Davis never made an unwatchable film.

Let's start out with DECEPTION, because this is the most exciting title here. It's just a lot of fun. It's later Davis slightly after her peak, but before anyone had guessed it. The production values are absolutely lavish. She was competing with Crawford in glamour here, and in that respect it is a 'movie star' performance. Bette is photographed by Ernie Haller with panache and she never looked more beautiful. Her performance is good, but the story lets her down. It's actually fluff, and plays out like a soap opera, but it's one of the most prestigious productions of the decade. You can tell a lot of money was poured into this, and although it fails, you will love every minute of it. This makes an excellent double feature with Crawford's HUMORESQUE: both were melodramas with stunning classical music sequences. A highlight of this one is the great Claude Rains, who is always excellent opposite Davis. 7/10

THE GREAT LIE is a potboiler. Davis walks through the picture rather harmlessly, while Mary Astor chews the scenery to shreds. The plot is completely ridiculous and unbelievable. It's an over-the-top, over-produced yarn with a lifeless and dull story at its heart. 4/10

THE OLD MAID is a quiet gem starring Davis and Miriam Hopkins. Their performances hold the picture together. It's a bittersweet story with engaging leads and a lovely production. Recommended. 7/10

IN THIS OUR LIFE is sort of hit-and-miss. While Huston's direction is solid, the film loses its credibility because of Davis' overbearing performance as a femme fatale. Although made during the period of Davis' best work (NOW VOYAGER, THE LETTER), this is one of her lesser performances. It is an example of blatant overacting on her part, made all the more apparent in contrast to the subtle underplaying of Olivia De Havilland., who gives a superb performance. The film has a very interesting civil rights angle and was one of the first to show the effects of prejudice on African Americans in the legal system. This segment of the film is effective. 6/10

Overall, not a spectacular set, but a good collection of Davis' lesser-known films. There are some gems to be found here, and also some duds. Explore at your own risk, but you certainly will not regret this purchase if you love classic films.",1202860800,4,2723,4.883116883116883
3327366,3,B0012OX7DA,"It's wonderful news for all fans of bette davis to hear of the release of her third box set with all-new DVD releases of her movies. I am especially happy to finally have one of her most beloved films The Old Maid on DVD. The wonderful chemistry of the two lead actresses Davis and Miriam Hopkins is genial and the dialogue exquisite. My favorite part of the movie is towards the end when Charlotte tells Delia that she will tell Clementina that she is her real mother(right before her wedding day) and Hopkins tells her "" Charlotte, you Ahh Wicked!"" My biggest complaint for this DVD is that they failed to do a Commentary for this great film. I guess they felt that since they did one on Old Acquaintance, it wasn't necessary, but I think there is so much to talk about in this film about Davis and Miriam and about the fantastic year this movie was made And released: 1939, and also how it stood in terms of the three other Davis releases of that year.
Anyways, i am also happy about In this our life, the Great lie, and ATAHT. I have seen ""watch on the rhine"" and although its a a good movie, its not really a Davis vehicle. I think that there are so many other movies that could have easily been greater showcase choices, such as DANGEROUS, where she won her first Oscar. Although it isn't a great movie, its a fascinating Davis performance. Other choices are BEyond the FOrest, one of her most underrated and nowadays most requested movies to be released on DVD, and  A Stolen Life, where we get 2 Davis sharing screen time. The inclusion of DECEPTION is still debatable to me. I think that the movie isn't great and its more of a Claude Rains film, but still i am glad they included this one and not the super boring the Corn is Green.

Now, I am also glad that there is another davis box coming right after this one which brings us a much-deserved two disc dvd for All about eve and a special edition of Hush Hush Sweet charlotte. It brings us new releases of the Virgin Queen, not a great movie, but with a great Davis performance opposed Joan Collins. Also, the highly campy the Nanny, if anything is good to have a few laughs and its way better than the dull the Anniversary. The only odd choice is Phone Call from a Stranger, but i guess FOx didn't own many Davis titles, so there isn't much they could do.
Finally along with these great releases, we will get the US POST OFFICE STAMP For BETTE DAVIS, and all i can say is that very happy to see that BETTE DAVIS is well celebrated for her centenary celebration with these marvellous well deserved tributes.",1202342400,9,2569,4.372384937238493

However I thought a great occasion for these collections was to include rare and/or early movies that fewer people would bother buying as stand-alones. There is no early Bette Davis movie here. It's a wasted opportunity. I would have gladly sacrificed Watch On The Rhine for something else, although that disc surprisingly includes yet another Bette Davis documentary that was not available on home video and now is :-) (it includes some interviews of hers I haven't seen anywhere else).",1201910400,9,758,4.622222222222222

In This Our Life (1942) - In my opinion this is one of Davis' best films, yet TCM will show ""Jezebel"" ten times a year and never show this one. Davis and Olivia De Haviland play sisters. Davis runs off with her sister's husband right before she herself is to be married. As time passes, her ex-fiance falls for De Haviland's character, and they decide to be married. When the husband Davis absconded with kills himself, Davis returns home and decides she wants her ex-fiance back. This film spotlights the kind of scenery-chewing role that Davis excelled at.

The Old Maid (1939) - Davis and Miriam Hopkin play cousins. Hopkins is the belle-of-the-ball type who is marrying a well-off man to spite her colorful yet poor suitor that she in fact still harbors deep feelings for. Davis plays Charlotte, the pretty but quiet type who comforts the ex-suitor after Hopkins rejects him. The rejected suitor then goes off to fight in the Civil War and is killed. Years later, as Charlotte is planning her own wedding, her cousin finds out that Charlotte had an illegitimate child by her ex-beau. Her retribution ruins Charlotte's life and yet binds her to Charlotte forever. Extra features include:

All This and Heaven Too (1940)
Davis plays Henriette, a governess to children whose wealthy parents are unhappily married. When the Duke (Charles Boyer) falls in love with Henriette, the angry wife dies a death that appears to be murder. The Duke and Henriette are instantly under suspicion, which is made no better when the Duke dies by his own hand. This leaves Henriette to face the questioning authorities alone. This film features a kinder, gentler, softer Bette Davis than roles she often played. Extra features include:

The Great Lie (1941)
Another pairing of Davis with George Brent, a leading man with whom she had such great chemistry. George Brent plays Peter, a man who marries  concert pianist Sandra (Mary Astor) on an alcohol-induced lark. He really loves Maggie (Bette Davis), and repents at leisure. The marriage turns out not to be legal, Peter goes back to Maggie and marries her, and then disappears in the South American jungle while on an aviation expedition for the government. After Peter's disappearance Sandra discovers she is pregnant with Peter's child - something she doesn't want at all but Maggie desperately does. Extra features include:

Deception (1946)
A rather odd but good film. Davis plays pianist Christine Radcliffe who is separated from her great love, cellist Karel Novak (Paul Henreid), by World War II. She presumes he is dead and has had an affair with wealthy and unstable composer Alexander Hollenius (Claude Rains). Karel reappears after the war and he and Christine marry, but she can't shake the spectre of Hollenius who continues to torment her. Hollenius' character could have resulted in over-the-top camp in the hands of a lesser actor, but Rains makes the role work. Extra features include:

I was very happy to find this movie on AMAZON VIDEO.

Hoping many other classic videos will be available on AMAZON.

Very enjoyable!

3327391,5,B0012OX7DA,"The movie starts out slow, and I'm afraid it's going to be a real bore - especially since the plot is rather straightforward and seemingly predictable. Bette Davis stars. The plot begins with her finding her lost true love on stage, performing on the cello. They meet, she invites him to her supposedly 'starving artist' wage apartment, where he quickly realizes there's another big source of funding to account for her furs, expensive art collection, and spacious rooms with a view to die for. Suspicious, he asks some questions and becomes suspicious that another man is keeping her.

Bette manages to change to topic, and they're quickly married. At the party, he meets the true source of her secret funding, a maniacal genius composer (Claude Rains) who makes himself obnoxious making insinuating remarks aimed at Bette. Rains then hatches a plot to embarrass Bette's new husband in the guise of helping him. Then he takes his sinister planning to an even higher level - intending to publicly expose Bette's past with him during the after-concert party. But Bette has other plans, and the ending is a bit of a surprise.",1431734400,5,1123,4.910526315789474

While I've seen a moderate amount (certainly not as much as some of you most serious and dedicated cinephiles) of Claude's work , nothing could have prepared me for his flamboyant and amazing turn as the enormously gifted , wholly unpredictable and exceptionally brilliant music composer at the core of this project .
While Bette Davis and to an equal extent Paul Henreid are excellent in service of a fine but somewhat tricky script that requires odd pauses and swift and peculiar emotional contortions on both their parts , Rains stumbles over no such obstacles . Mr. Rains ought to have been nominated for best actor in this year for this performance . I'll look and see . In my book he deserved that award hands down . What a master .

3327420,5,B0012OX7DA,"This would be a perfect film if it weren't for the ending which is very oddly constructed and quite unbelievable.  But never mind that.

Davis is gritty and edgy and always has me feeling she is going to come totally unglued at any moment, never matter how many times I see it.  Of course she eventually succumbs to her torments and commits a murder which clip is often played in her many biopics.  Henreid is equally temperamental and acts like he might self-combust as well.

But Claude Rains.  Rains is menacing, eccentric and gives a genius of a performance.  If you love Claude Rains and have not seen this movie, it is a must.  To me it is his picture.

Set in New York which is always a fab backdrop.

I would love to have Davis' apartment in this movie.  She has paid a high price for it.

3327421,5,B0012OX7DA,"Deception has very little plot- a cellist named Karel Novak (Paul Henreid) suddenly appears in New York after being assumed dead by Christine Radcliffe (Bette Davis_) a concert pianist-piano teacher. He had been the love of her life, but in the long interim, Christine had become the mistress of Alexander Hollenius, a composer- acerbic, witty, a character much more interesting than the somewhat leaden Karel. In typical fashion Davis wrings her hands and agonizes all over the place trying to convince Karel that Alex was simply a fellow musician, not her lover. Well, Karel does smell a rat as Christine swans about in a gorgeous New York penthouse replete with priceless antiques, all donated by Hollenius and hardly obtainable on a music teacher's modest salary. But Christine does her darndest to prove to Karel that's she's pure as the driven snow and certainly not, God forbid, a man's mistress. She and Karel marry and Alex becomes the puppeteer, pulling strings of his own invention by manipulating Karel, upsetting Christine and having a jolly time doing so. He steals the show with that sardonic smirk, those expressive black eyebrows, pure ham and pure delightful.

This 1948 black and white film is beautifully and imaginatively  photographed. While the film is not really a noir one, it is atmospheric, and you may feel your own hair is getting wet during a sullen, foggy rainy New York night. How the trick of making Henreid magnificently play the cello, with the usual facial grimaces players on stringed instruments are well known for,  the left hand fingers plucking those vibrating strings, the right hand making the bow sing I can't imagine. (I am reminded of Cary Grant convincingly playing the harp in The Bishop's Wife).

The funniest scene in the film occurs when Hollenius takes Christine and Karel to a fancy restaurant for a pre-concert dinner. Alex proceeds to be the ultimate gourmet, endlessly discussing entrees, sauces, truffles and the like, enthralling the waiters. At one point a waiter brings by a large platter of something. Alex picks up a tiny dead bird- a lark, maybe- and even smells it. He chatters away endlessly in French, opining that no woodcocks are available. His two guests grow more and more sullen as Alex carries out his little performance.

To modern audiences, Christine's little charade of not being Alex's lover seems extremely over-wrought. Perhaps people were more innocent in 1946. However, Deception is well worth watching, especially seeing Bette Davis at the top of her form. They don't make them like Bette Davis any more.",1405382400,6,2586,5.046838407494145

Her opposite, the man of her dreams, is a bit like a Zombie character, can't seem to hold it together and you find that you really don't care if he falls over the bannister or gets stuck in the elevator for the rest of the movie.

3327436,3,B0012OX7DA,"Deception starts out like a noir melodrama, with Bette Davis running through darkened streets to a theater where she arrives late to view the performance of cellist Paul Henreid. Her eyes fill with tears, and we wait to find out why. When she goes backstage after the performance, we discover the pair were lovers in Germany before the war, and got separated.

Bette, a pianist, believing Henreid dead, came to America in the interim and embarked on an affair with her musical mentor Hollenius (a delightfully wicked Claude Raines). Bette now lives in New York City where Hollenius has installed her in a deluxe penthouse apartment, adorned her in furs and filled her living space with expensive art and furnishings.

This gives Bette some serious explaining to do when she and Henreid go to her apartment after the performance. But instead of being honest and telling Henreid about the affair, Bette decides to deceive him (hence the title) and tells him that the opulence of her apartment was made possible by tutoring rich music students.

Although it's an implausible plot contrivance (since apparently the entire city and music community knows of their affair, to say nothing of expecting Hollenius to pretend no such affair happened), we must excuse it because without this contrivance, there would be no story. For Hollenius , upon discovering her plan to ditch him and marry Henreid, realizes the power of the bargaining chip he holds. As long as she is not willing to tell Henreid of the affair, Hollenius can control her, blackmail and extort anything he wants from her by threatening to reveal it.

And so he does. He informs Davis that she belongs to him, although he will permit her this folly of a marriage and relationship. However, she will continue to secretly be his concubine (for all practical purposes) while he does everything possible to emasculate and destroy her new husband.

To explain why Davis doesn't just tell Henried she had the affair (which he already suspects anyway) and get it over with, the writers have given Henreid a convenient (for plot purposes) streak of insane jealousy (he actually STRANGLES her when he first sees her apartment, rightly believing it to have been paid for in sexual favors). So we can rather forgive Davis for not wanting to be strangled again.  (Imagine this device being used today for a male character who is supposed to be ""Mister Right""!)

What keeps ""Deception"" from being an unpleasant and uncomfortable film to watch is the underlying black humor which pervades the proceedings. Despite it's grandly operatic look and feel, the film is not entirely a serious one. It's a bit of a satire about the ridiculous situations people put themselves in when they refuse to tell the truth. Raines especially has fun with his role as the wicked puppet-master, and even tells Davis at one point, ""why don't you just tell him the truth? Your lie has given me everything I need to control you!"" But Bette sticks by her guns--literally, as it turns out--and if you are a Davis fan you will likely have fun watching her navigate this polished but slightly absurd film to its suitably melodramatic conclusion.",1388707200,2,3163,4.9009345794392525

3327459,3,B0012OX7DA,"Hey, I like a soft touch egg head thriller as well as the next guy but this one, this ""highbrow"" thing, Deception, left me cold, cold as old Claude Rains at the end. It was not that Bette Davis played, well, Bette Davis with those Bette Davis eyes (and other iconic moves) just a little too dramatically over the top as a head over heels in love budding pianist mooning over a lost love cellist in post-war Mayfair swells New York (World War II for those keeping score on the which war issue). It was not that Paul Henreid, last seen by this writer as the heroic resistance leader Victor Laszlo trying to get some damned letters of transit out of hole-in-the- wall Casablanca in the film of the same name in order to beat the Nazis in Europe, as that smitten cellist who had lost a step or two with his nerves all frayed after being cooped up in that aforementioned Nazi-occupied Europe. And it certainly was not Claude Rains, also last seen by this reviewer in that same film walking in some fogged-in hole- in- the- wall Casablanca airfield arm and arm with Humphrey Bogart after helping old Victor Laszlo break out to lead Europe back to civilization, as a world famous composer with a penchant for New Yorker magazine-induced high camp elite chatter, or what passed for it in those days. No, it was not the performances of these fines actors per se  but the flow of the plot line that as it slowly and melodramatically unfolded made me hope, hope to high heaven, that someone, and that someone being Claude Rains, would end up as cold as I felt about half way through this one.

Let me explain and see if you agree. Christine (played by Bette Davis), an aspiring pianist, who was being, well, let me put this gently, being ""kept"" by the eminent composer Hollenius (played by Rains) who lavished her with gifts and other expensive odds and ends for her favors. Nothing usual there and as we are all adults we know, or should know, this stuff happens all the time to Mayfair swells and mean street thugs. What upsets this nice arrangement is that an old beau, Karel (played by Henreid), a struggling but up and coming cellist in pre-war Europe  whom was presumed by Christine to be dead shows up in New York right after the war trying to make a new start. Christine finds out, and wants to start up that old flame thing they had when they were young and struggling in that lost pre-war European night. All this though without telling him anything but lies about her sugar daddy Hollenius. Not a good idea.

The rest of the film centers on the tension between this trio as Karel runs to fits of confusion and jealousy over Christine's relationship with Hollenius. Hollenius is furious, and profusely and verbally at wits end, over Christine's tossing him, a great world renown composer, over for some two bit caf musician. A subplot has Hollenius toying with the lovebirds by offering Karel a cello work compose by him that can either make or break him in the highbrow music world. And Christine, well, Christine is trying to keep her past a secret from Karel at any price. That is the deception and it is played out until the merciful end when she off-handedly shot old Hollenius when he, very ungentlemanly-like, threatened, or maybe threatened, to expose the whole show. Of course this whole star-crossed lovers scene could have been averted if Christine had just come clean but no she had to play with fire, and play with it until the end. See what I mean though about not getting very weepy over this melodrama.",1348358400,,3517,4.568938193343898
3327460,4,B0012OX7DA,"I love this movie but on the face of it I feel a little ridiculous saying I love it because the plot as it is executed is borderline ridiculous. Here's a quick summary. A piano teacher named Christine Radcliffe is being mentored by conductor Alexander Hollenius. Christine's clothes are fabulous. Her apartment is luxe. Her furs and jewelry are great. Hmm, do I smell a rat here? Isn't she a poor teacher and presumably without a well padded family? Doesn't the great Hollenius seem a tad too possessive? Well, without much time to process everything Christine's lost love Karel Novak (Henried) who was presumed dead suddenly surfaces. A fellow musician and composer who has just barely survived life in Europe during WWII, Karel is sick and emotionally frail. Christine is going to be his muse and help him regain his confidence by getting Hollenius to help him present his music. Presumably Christine and Karel will then head off in the sunset and a life of artistic success. Wait, not so fast. Hollenius doesn't see it that way since Christine is his mistress and that is where all the goodies that Christine enjoys are coming from. Of course, if Karel finds out he'll be devastated. What transpires next is a cat and mouse game between Christine and Hollenius. Forget Henried's Karel who is merely window dressing. It is a terrified and desperate Christine pitted against the manipulative, deliberately cruel, angry, and very imperious Hollenius. Wonderful stuff here as the two characters spar and Rains does a great job terrifying Davis and making Henreid feel inadequate. Rains is the big fat cat primed to pummel the mouse Davis. The ending is predictable, but that is not the point. Davis and Rains are so good that even a mediocre plot can't keep them down. This is potent stuff and stands as evidence as to how good these actors were. On top of it all, this movie has a wonderful score by Erich Wolfgang Korngold and is photographed in glorious black and white with moody shadows that makes it real cinema noir stuff.
While the repairing of Davis, Rains, and Henreid isn't as successful as their previous outing in Now Voyager which was a vastly superior story, this film is a 5* film for Davis and Rains' performances and 3* for a just o.k. script.",1342137600,3,2260,4.782608695652174
3327461,5,B0012OX7DA,"""Deception"" is a lot better than my wife and I expected.  Sure, Bette Davis plays her usual self--on the verge of a temper tantrum at any time.  And the ending is rather far-fetched.  But the story line is captivating, especially for anyone with an interest in classical music, musicians, composers, or other artistic geniuses.  We feel it's not right to lump this movie into the category of ""film noir,"" since it is really more of a psychological thriller.  Moreover, the film lacks the rough-edged dialogue we usually associate with film noir classics, like ""Casablanca"" or ""Double Indemnity.""  In short, the movie seems far ahead of its time in how characters are developed and the intelligent interactions between them.

Paul Henreid is very good as the romantic lead, opposite the volcanic Ms. Davis.  Nevertheless, the performance of Claude Rains as the temperamental composer and millionaire impressario, is what steals the show.  Mr. Rains develops a truly hateful, egotistical character to the point where you want something really bad to happen to him.  Of course, it does, but without spoiling the climax, it would be best for other viewers to see for themselves.

It's been reported that this was the first movie Bette Davis did for Warner Bros. that actually lost money.  Too bad, but one can see why.  The movie, directed by Irving Rapper, seems so out of place when compared to other films of the time.  But that may be its main attraction.  Now, we want to see the earlier film where the same leading actors and Mr. Rapper combined for a more successful outcome.  That film is entitled, ""Now, Voyager,"" and should be a good one.

Summing up, ""Deception"" is far better than the reviews and summaries suggest.  It affords a glimpse into the private lives of musical prima donnas and other artistic geniuses.  We didn't expect to give it five stars, but it really deserves that.",1341187200,,1891,4.889937106918239
3327462,4,B0012OX7DA,"I buy these collections because they give you your favorite star on demand. In this instance, this six film collection might be called the Suffering Bette Collection if it weren't for the inclusion of In This Our Life. These movies are all good, though some tanked at the box office.
Here is a breakdown of what you get in this package.
The Old Maid is a Civil War melodrama. Bette manages to have a one time fling with George Brent before he toddles off to the battlefield. However, he left her a gift to remember him with. He impregnated her. Of course, Brent is killed and Bette allows her cousin to raise her child with her cousin's children. Drama ensues and who better for Bette to tangle with than her cousin (Miriam Hopkins). This is a fairly typical WB melodrama, but Bette and Miriam are great when the feathers fly. George Brent is great eye candy. It's easy to understand why Bette gave up her virtue.
All This And Heaven, Too is set in 19th century France. Bette is a nanny to the Duke and Duchess du Presline. The Dutchess is a shrew and the Duke (Charles Boyer) is attracted to Bette who is gentle and kind and great with the children. A scandal ensues and there are no winners in this one. It's not all downhill for Bette. She gets solace from the Rev. Henry Fielding(Jeffrey Lynn).
The Great Lie proves that life can be complicated. Bette's daredevil husband (George Brent) is presumed dead. His ex-wife (Mary Astor) who probably has the shortest lived marriage on record turns up pregnant and doesn't want the baby which will hamper her career as a concert pianist. Bette takes on the baby as her own and then her husband turns up very much alive and as handsome as ever. Bette and Mary hog the screen in this one and both play off each other with gusto.
Watch On The Rhine is WWII propaganda at its best. Bette is an American returning home after 2 decades to DC to her wealthy family with her freedom fighter husband (Paul Lukas) and three kids with odd accents. Lots of intrigue and nazis abound. Based on a stage play and very well done.
In This Our Life has Bette stealing her sister's (Olivia De Havilland) husband (Dennis Morgan). This story has Bette as an evil slut who is selfish and mean and shows absolutely no remorse. There are subtle hints of incest. Will evil Bette get hers in the end? this is rather heavy handed in the drama department, but Bette is a hoot as a southern charmer named Stanley.
Deception has Bette as a concert pianist who has been having an illicit relationship with her mentor Hoelenius (Claude Rains). Her husband (Paul Henried) who is a musician, escapes the nazis and reunites with Bette. Bette thinks she can escape an enraged Hoelenius, but can she? This one bombed in the theaters, but the cat and mouse game Rains and Davis play is interesting and tense.
If you like Bette Davis, this set will be a good fit. The fims offer a lot of drama and good supporting players and are great when you need a Bette Davis fix.",1334707200,,2975,4.480662983425415

He acts circles around Bette much like Mary Astor blew Bette out of the water in The Great Lie...BUT in my fantasy world William Wyler would have directed Bette in this and it would have been so much better!! When Rains confesses how badly he misses her Bette just looks annoyed...If Wyler had directed her he would have pulled the shame and guilt and dirtiness out of her! For this viewer Bette just phoned it in in this performance..But Rains, what a delight...I've seen so many Bette Davis movies and I can't think of one where the GUY out acts her!

3327466,5,B0012OX7DA,"I have loved Claude Rains since my childhood in the 80s, having seen films like ""Casablanca"" and ""Now, Voyager"".  ""Deception"" is, hands down, his finest moment in film.  Alexander Hollenius is commanding; witty; sexy; bitchy; masterful; hilarious; cunning; passionate and even a bit terrified when backed into a corner.  Any review of this film will mention the restaurant scene and indeed, he plays it to perfection.  His entrance in the film is pure magic and I triple dog dare you to take your eyes off of him once he has graced the screen.  Marvel as Claude drains Bette of her soul (after rehearsing his concerto) and proceeds to figuratively bash her over the skull with it.

Claude's character is often referred to as evil in this picture; like JR Ewing, you love to hate him.  Yet I don't hate him.  His actions after being tossed aside by Bette Davis for... Paul Henreid?... are completely believable (what does that say about me?).  Henreid's character is so wimpy, so violent and so BORING I constantly wonder what his appeal is.

I watched this picture everyday for a month after receiving my copy.

Claude's crowing moment:  As Bette Davis enters his dining room, working a gown as ONLY she CAN, Claude says, ""You look positively magnificent, I'd better remain seated.""

3327468,4,B0012OX7DA,"This is where we see an amazing performance by the one and only BETTE DAVIS!

SPOILER: Here's the story:
Bette is a pianist-Christine Radcliffe. It is post-war in the world of musicians. Bette sees the orchestral performance of her long lost love Karel Novak. Karel comes to Christine's HUGE and luxurious apartment and sees expensive curios. How did she get those? Then he hears that she knows Alexander Hollenius (the great composer) and here the suspicion begins. The truth is that during the war-Christine let Hollenius support her. Karel has a fiery temper--we find that out when he shakes her violently by the shoulder--and Christine is afraid of telling the truth. Hollenius uses his wit too drive Karel up a wall. Christine is getting mad and nervous that Alex will let the cat out of the bag and shoots him. Finally, Christine tells the truth to Karel in a tearful confession. Karel tells her not to tell the police but BETTE replies with ""we could never be happy knowing"" and ""I just can't live a lie"". And so it ends.

The rundown:
Bette is superb by acting with a tainted innocence. She leaves you liking her but she still uses her famous Bette-venom, especially when she talks to Hollenius. This movie flaunts Miss Davis's ability to act with discretion and subtlety but yet with flamboyancy and creative drama. Then, there comes Claude Rains. He is all wit and sarcasm and is a delight to see. He and Bette are what make the movie-they are foils--literary opposites. She: shy but protective but strong, and he: the all-knowing one (in the case of her deception) and sly but sarcastic and laughing. Our third actor is Paul Henreid. In this movie, is is very annoying as he is supposed to be. You find it hard to believe that Bette would want to be with this ruthless, suspicious cello player- but then that's what you call a movie.
Erich Korngold Wolf's score is superb, brilliant classical music with a stimulating and suspenceful edge.
The movie plot itself would be a 3 out of 5 had it not been for Miss Daivs and Mr. Rains. The movie is a little slow-paced and dreary but still a little suspenceful. The best parts are when the frantic Christine is battling it out with the mocking Hollenius.
Although it can be boring to a I-only-watch-fast-paced-thriller-movies or I-don't-like-old-movies crowds, it is a wonderful performance to see if you are a Bette fan or like watching good quality acting.",1298073600,,2413,4.756563245823389

3327477,5,B0012OX7DA,"This collection gives us The Old Maid, seldom seen before VHS and this DVD. This film conyains one of Miss Davis' greatest performances, as she enters into the very heart of what a loveless life can do, to a young woman, and finnaly an older woman, living in a house with a cousin who caused so much of her loneliness.

Deception has Miss Davis squaring off with Claude Rains in a series of scenes very suspenseful and very dark in mood and setting. It is not to be missed.

The others are great: Watch on the Rhine is spectacular, with an ending that truly shocks and moves one.

All This and Heaven Too, is Boyer's best., as Miss Davis draws him out of his ""Take me to the Cassbah"" routine. Her performance is subtle, compressed, as the character she portrays undergoes a harrowing series of rejections.

The Great Lie has Bette Davis face off with Mary Astor, both in top form, battleing for the same lover, a very strange George Brent. Catch Hattie MacDaniel as the ever perceptive maid, and the explosive western retreat scene, between Mary Astor and Bette Davis, as they encounter each other in the midst of dust storms, no lights, and no creature comforts of any kind!

In this Our Life directs us to the racism so prevalent in Hollywood and everywhere else. Bette Davis hits the marks with a portrayal of blistering madness, off set by Olicvia DeHavilland's cool, moody reactions. The racisl issue is very daring, and the ending will surprise you!

3327482,3,B0012OX7DA,"At the start of her career downturn at Warner Bros. until she was saved by Joseph Mankiewicz casting her at the last minute for her definitive role of Margo Channing in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-About-Eve/dp/B0012KSUTU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All About Eve</a>, Bette Davis played one of her most morally puerile characters as Christine Radcliffe, a classical pianist who is unexpectedly reunited with the love of her life, cellist Karel Novak, whom she took for dead, while carrying on as the ""protg"" of renowned composer Alexander Hollenius. Note the fancy, spacious apartment she can supposedly afford on a piano teacher's paltry wages. Had Christine shown any common sense, she would have told Karel within the first five minutes of their passionate embrace, gotten slapped for her supposed infidelity and then she would have been forgiven with violins swooning in the background. However, that would have made this 1946 Baroque-level soaper about seven minutes long. Instead, as directed by Irving Rapper in overly emphatic style, we get to watch Davis wrench her hands and get all tight-lipped as she tries to convince the tirelessly jealous Karel that she and Alex are merely good friends. Ha!

When Alex is not spending his time seething in a jealous rage, he is busy manipulating the nerves of poor Karel, whom Alex has suspiciously chosen to play the spotlight cello solo in his new concerto. The movie's most amusing scene is when the three go out for a pre-performance dinner as Alex plays the world's most pretentious diner in front of the increasingly exasperated lovers. The tension of Charlotte's deception leads to a melodramatic finish that recalls earlier Davis' vehicles, but this time for the weakest of reasons.

3327484,4,B0012OX7DA,"Here is Bette Davis playing Christine Radcliff doing what she does best: Weaving a complicated web, trying to love a man while keeping a business realtionship with another, being a martyr and looking flawless every moment. No wonder she had temper fits, anyone with half the load would faint too, and often.

Bette is in love with a musician. She actually is one herself and has an energetic moment at the piano of such riveting misplaced energy that it alone suffices for a reason to see and appreciate the film. This musician, Paul Henreid, who plays Karel Novak , has been trying to get to America to escape the war for a long time and in that long interlude while living in NY City, Bette was compelled to find a 'protector' who could pay for her five mink coats, her stunning penthouse apartment and the delightful trinkets in it, which include a Picasso that would be more than 30 million today, a Tang horse, a very expensive piano and every shape and size of silver candelabra that can illuminate the huge space. Obviously we suspect something is wrong when she tells him she has been able to get all of this with music lessons and the 'gifts' that her rich, untalented students lavish on her patient tutoring. Anyone even with no knowledge of NY real estate would have been floored by the kind of money it takes to get an appartment like hers, but somehow he is in denial and does not see it right away, though he later on gets insanely jealous enough to make up for it.  Claude Rains, who played the martyr husband with her in ""Mr. Skeffington"" here is an eccentric composer aptly named Alexander Hollenius and her benefactor. We are supposed to think that she had a 'past' with him until the very moment the musician,arrives finally into her life, but this is a misunderstanding. The reality, as I see it, is that Christine has been playing the role of mistress to cover up in high society,  the fact that Hollenius is gay. This movie is therefore much better understood as a battle between two temperamental, musically talented, and emotionally challenged Queens. As a matter of fact it is only from this perspective that a lot of its nuance and brilliance can be appreciated.

This would explain, for example, her exquisite clothes and decor. No regular Joe could have come up with that unique mix of Chinese and Modern that is still a standard of excellence in decorating interiors of traditional wealthy apartments in this city. Hollenius looks and acts always as if on the verge of snapping. He speaks with the impetuosity and mannerisms of a retired decorator who still has anguished nightmares about getting the right color for the living room or a great couturier who suffered endlessly over the placement of glitter in the collection's evening gowns. He tries to upstage Christine by showing up unannounced and late at her wedding, and wearing a gorgeous evening cape. He also cracks a glass and leaves in a huff, all very consistent with drag queen-competitive posturing. If we had any serious doubts about this reality and its interpretation, the scene in the restaurant is devastating proof: Hollenius is totally heinous in delaying the dinner, knowing fully well it is making the musician nervous about being late for the concert, and by torturing the French chefs into reciting the specials, offering gratituous commentary on alterations on the sauces and the choice of wines that would match each dish, each more impossible and extravagant than the last. His erudition and refinement of choice is fastidious to the point of hysteria. He enjoys the process because he is infatuated with the musician and wants to outshine and humilate Christine. The fact that he has written the concerto for the cello, the instrument that he plays, also points in that direction. It will all drive Christine to despair eventually, and presently to seething rage.
This is a Must-See for Bette Davis fans and for those interested in classical music performance, and early gay identity in Hollywood films.",1249862400,2,4011,4.817126269956459

'In This Our Life' and 'The Old Maid' are the definate highlights and the others are in no way among Bette's flops (of which there are not many anyway). All of the films are filmed in the high point of her career and while they are not her most famous (Vol 1 and 2 contain those), any Bette fan would be CRAZY to not buy this set! Bette Davis' talent is simply breathtaking!

This being said, I had this product shipped internationally and it arrived in perfect condition, earlier than the estimated time of arrival and in the correct place! The packaging is a gorgeous metalic silver with the only colour being the blue surrounding the title and the blue of Bette's eyes. Stunning! Buy it! It's so worth it!

3327486,5,B0012OX7DA,"It would be a unforgiveable deception to tell you that this Bette Davis, Paul Henreid, Claude Rains vehicle is anything but top rate glossy soap bubble popping high drama. A rainy day is the perfect time to watch this film, late afternoon when the light seems like it will last forever giving you that trapped in time feeling. This film evokes that effect through out. Wonderful light, and so much of it takes place in twilight, or in rain, and in the deepest inky night.

It may not be considered a film noir in the classic sense but it certainly, as shot by the incredible Ernest Haller; it looks like one and one of the most gorgeous of the style. It is more like a Woman's Noir with its story of a basically good woman driven by her deceptions to do bad things, very bad things.

  Without a shadow of a doubt this is one of Claude Rains most entertaining, sharp, insightfully and wicked performances. He is pure joy to watch as he manipulates each person he comes in contact with in the story. He is the rotten, jealous petrified hard center of this poison souffl&eacute;.  Bette Davis is wonderful of course and is dressed to the nines but what is remarkable to see is the fun she is having as she hands the film over to Mr.. Rains. They made so many wonderful films together and he is obviously someone she admired and loved to work with. She is strong and exciting in the role but she gets out of the way and lets him have his day.

  And yet beyond all of this there are two reasons I love this film.  It has a remarkable classic Hollywood score by Erich Wolfgang Korngold and features his now famous  ""Hollenius' Cello Concerto"" as well as music by Beethoven, Wagner and Schubert. The music is as much a star of the film as anyone else. And in the commentary you will learn how the magic of Hollywood was employed to make the non-musical Henreid play that violin and not look like he is trying to saw it in half, and that Bette Davis could indeed play the piano just as she does in the film.

Then there is the incredible and even inspiring set design. The loft that Davis lives in is forty years ahead of it time. It is an incredible set and must have inspired interior designers in some subliminal way over the years, for now in cities across America that look is so in vogue.  The industrial concrete walls and the slanted floor to ceiling glass wall overlooking the city juxtaposed with a mix of modern furniture and antiques. It is timeless decorating, visually magnificent, barren, cold and full of dark corners where secrets can be hidden. In short a perfect design for this film.

  If you are a Steve Martin fan see if you can spot the scene he borrowed from ""Deception"" so that he could act with Bette Davis in his very wonderful ""Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid.""  Whether working with Claude Rains or Steve Martin, Bette Davis lets both men shine as she casts her mega-watt star power over them.",1241740800,42,2911,4.413084112149533
3327487,4,B0012OX7DA,"DECEPTION is probably as good as a melodrama can be and still remain one. Bette Davis, Paul Heinreid, and Claude Raines reunite from NOW VOYAGER with Davis and Heinreid as unlikely lovers in a failed relation and Raines playing against type as an over the top megalomaniac whose hamminess stole each scene from Miss Davis, who usually did the stealing but in this case had to surrender to Raines' tsunamis of biting witticisms.  Miss Davis has a good life in post World War II New York as a music teacher who need not struggle with financial woes as she is the mistress of a very obnoxious but wealthy egotist.  Out of the clear blue sky her former lover (Heinreid) appears in a concert as a cellist. She had thought that he was killed during the war but there he is. As they hug each other in happiness, Heinreid quickly figures out that Davis' opulent living style could not come from her meager earnings as a piano tutor. Enter Raines as the jealous sugar daddy who is determined to crush their renewed vows as faithful lovers.  But it is the means of this crushing that elevate DECEPTION as a very high order of melodrama. Raines is loud, sarcastic, pushy, yet apologetic each time quite insincerely for all that.  A funny scene occurs in a fancy restaurant where Raines treats Davis and Heinreid to an expensive dinner. He first orders one meal, then changes his mind, orders another, changes his mind yet again, before deciding on HIS choice, knowing all the while that his delaying tactics are irritating them to no end. We can hardly understand why Davis was attracted to Heinreid in the first place. He is moody, volatile, even given to outbursts of abuse as he nearly chokes Davis in a fit of rage. The warm low key mutual attraction that they shared in NOW VOYAGER is nowhere here apparent.  By contrast, we can easily understand her attraction to Raines. His very qualities of aggressive mind tinkering have their peculiar lure to women who have known only lumpen clods like Heinreid. She even visits Raines one day after her marriage to Heinreid supposedly to demand that he cease to exhibit the very qualities of pushiness that she finds so alluring.  If Raines is the magnet and Davis the iron filings, then Heinreid is sticks of splinters that no one else seems to want. The plot is insane, of course. Only Hollywood writers could come up with such a melodrama, but we watch DECEPTION not for that but for the torrent of words and hand wringing that accompanies them. The ending which I shall not here reveal is total illogic, but by then, who cares about such mundane things like obvious evidence to a crime that the script writers leave hanging in the air. DECEPTION is a fine roller coaster of a film that proves yet again that a dearth of logic can easily be supplanted by a plethora of acting talent.  In this case, it was Claude Raines that is that plethora.",1239753600,3,2880,4.61328125

Based on a melodramatic piece of boulevard claptrap, there's hardly a believable moment in the entire picture, and certainly nothing about the plot bears scrutiny -- from every character treating a worn and puffy Davis as though she's the cutest little trick in shoe leather within ten blocks of Carnegie Hall, to the deception of the title -- should her husband be able, as the plot would have it, to ignore evidence and common sense and believe all's innocent fun and games, surely someone in the classical music community where these folks run would be happy to clarify for him just how Bette got that mink?  But viewers should happily throw these questions aside and revel in one of the screen's great displays of ham run amok.  Davis, no slouch in the scenery-chewing department, is constantly upstaged here by Claude Rains, who relishes each innuendo and bon mot in John Collier's witty screenplay.  Erich Wolfgang Korngold's ripe score (with a marvelous cello concerto at its center) and Ernest Haller's brilliant cinematography (he was to capture another unforgettable Davis performance in BABY JANE) add to the film's pleasures.

In This Our Life: Bette Davis and Olivia De Havilland are a pair of priviledged sisters who can't get along, especially when Bette tries to cover up a murder.

Watch On the Rhine: This war-time film won Paul Lukas an Oscar for Best Actor, and features one of Bette's most personal monologues that she said set the tone for the rest of her life.

The Old Maid: The original pairing of Miriam Hopkins and Bette that had audiences crying in the theatre. It was one of the most profitable films of 1939.

The Great Lie: When Mary Astor won her Oscar for Best Supporting Actress she thanked Tchaikovsky and Bette Davis- and rightfully so. For once, Bette plays the good girl, while Astor plays the femme fatale with grand results.

Deception: The reunion of the ""Now Voyager"" cast (Claude Rains, Paul Henreid, Bette Davis) finds them embroiled in a deadly love triangle.

All This and Heaven Too: Warner Bros. answer to ""Gone With the Wind"" stars Bette Davis, Charles Boyer and Barbara O'Neil. When Bette becomes a governess to a well-to-do French family, she finds herself an accessory to murder.

3327500,4,B0012OX7DA,"""Deception"" was the last half decent Bette Davis vehicle from her glorious Warner Brother's years. Released in 1946, the film was based on a 2 character play called ""Jealousy"". Unfortunately, censorship robbed the film of credibility and the phoney ending just doesn't work as Davis herself recognised. Until then though, the film has some great features:

- an outstanding over the top performance by the great Claude Rains playing a composer/conductor named Hollenius. Rains, as Davis always acknowledged, steals the film.
- great sets, costumes and lighting creating a plush world among the operatic arty set in New York.

The DVD print is excellent and there are some good extras. The commentary is intriguing, carefully noting how the problems behind the scenes, including Davis's troubled private life (she was pregnant at the time) and insecurity about her looks contributed to the tension visible on the celluloid. There is a coloured short film about adventurers riding the Colorado river rapids and one set in Hollywood which puts together technicolour numbers from previous shorts dating back almost 10 years. Jane Wyman sings one of the songs and shows she was a competent singer. The cartoon is an hilarious gem as a mouse outwits Porky Pig. Don't miss when the mouse takes on a mechanical cat. This is animated perfection.  Lastly, there is the original trailer of the film plus another Davis opus, ""A Stolen Life"".

3327501,4,B0012OX7DA,"Since this is Volume 3 of the Bette Davis DVD sets, one would expect it to reach into the more controversial of her Warner Brother's legacy. Six films are included as follows:

- in 1939, possibly Davis's best year, ""The Old Maid"" paired her with the bitchy Miriam Hopkins in an emotional work out as a spinster who lives with her cousin who raises Davis's illegitimate daughter as her own. The film is very well made by Edmund Goulding and based on an Edith Wharton play but it was a dated yarn even in 1939.
- in 1940, ""All This and Heaven Too"" was filmed as Warner's rival production to ""Gone with the Wind"", a long and detailed film, the opposite of the normal gutsy Warner's product. Davis plays a governess in the unhappy home of Duke Charles Boyer and the film was based on fact.  It is a dull film but Davis underplays poignantly.
- in 1941, ""The Great Lie"" was an entertaining but absurd soap opera with fireworks from Oscar winning Mary Astor as Davis's rival for the affections of George Brent. This was one of the films which contributed to Davis's reputation for interference. She found the screenplay poor and worked with Astor to re-write it and give it some guts.
- in 1942, the controversial ""In This our Life"" was released with a thin Davis playing a southern gal wreaking havoc on all around her. The film has underlying themes of racism and incest and is well constructed.  Olivia De Havilland plays her sister and they make an interesting contrast. Davis is mannered and frenetic but it is not simple enough to dismiss her performance as such because she absolutely nails a bitch on heat.
- in 1943, ""Watch on the Rhine"", based on a very successful Broadway play, starred Paul Lukas in an Oscar winning performance as an anti fascist. Davis subdues her fireworks and matches Lukas with a warm and sympathetic portrayal of the wife who understands the reality of her husband's work. The film is stage bound and the children are awful but it is a worthwhile piece of history.
- 1946, Davis was pregnant and insecure and the overwrought ""Deception"" betrays her personal tensions. The film is high camp entertainment with an over the top Claude Rains as a conductor/composer. A plush melodrama, probably the last real Davis vehicle, what it lacks in credibility, mainly due to the censors, it makes up for in over the top dramatics.

The prints of all of the films are superb. All the disks contain Warner Brother's Night at the Movies, that entertaining program of cartoon, shorts and trailers - something for everyone. There are commentaries on 4 of the films - two good, one not so good and one dreadul. Janine Basinger gets better and better and her comments about ""In This Our Life"" are first rate. She also has a wry sense of humour which adds so much. The commentary for ""Deception"" is interesting because the commentator carefully points out how what went on behind the scenes, particularly Davis's personal life at this time, affected what can be seen on the celluloid. This is a good character study of Davis and her art. For ""All This in Heaven Too"", Daniel Bubbeo lost me in the first 10 minutes when he managed to completely repeat himself, almost word for word. He is wet in the worst sense. The commentator for ""Watch on the Rhine"" is a Lillian Hellman biographer and manages to talk almost entirely for the duration without mentioning the film. He also is a Claudette Colbert fan, including irrelevant stuff about Colbert, even going so far as to undermine Davis's famous performance in ""All About Eve"" when she replaced Colbert. This is a rotten commentary.
