3831841,4,B0021BSOFY,"I have heard several fans of Japanese giant monster movies panning this movie.  I've heard that it is stupid or silly.  The fact is that the movie is all that.  It is a fine parody of all the goofier parts of paticularly 60's and 70's kaiju films.  Serious fans who take these movies a little too seriously don't want to admit that some of the jokes are dead on.  There are plenty of silly moments from all of kaiju history to pull from.  Then there is the very un-pc political and ethnic humor to add into the mix.  Yes, most of the jokes are easy and not very deep, but if you are willing to pur your pretense on hold you just might get a few laughs out of this movie.",1252800000,4,670,4.068702290076335
3831842,4,B0021BSOFY,"This a a political parody about international relations specifically ""The Group of Eight (G8, and formerly the G6 or Group of Six) is a forum, created by France in 1975, for governments of eight nations of the northern hemisphere: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States; in addition, the European Union is represented within the G8, but cannot host or chair.[1] ""G8"" can refer to the member states or to the annual summit meeting of the G8 heads of government."" (see  G8 on Wikipedia for more detail. The Kaiju Guilala was used as a plot device as was his foe, Take-Majin, who parodies both Dai Majin and Ultraman-type characters. Apologies to the fans of 1967's THE X FROM OUTER SPACE  but Guilala made Gappa look scary. He was the perfect choice for this film.

I think the one outstanding problem with this version is with so many characters speaking their native languages some of the parody gets lost in the translation. That said , if all else fails ,the nuclear suppository should convince you not to take it seriously. If you do , you have no sense of humor or clue as to the point the film was attempting to make  regarding international politics and globalization.",1251417600,6,1224,4.759433962264151
3831843,2,B0021BSOFY,"This was meant as a satire and supposed to be intentionally funny. I thought it was stupid and as insult to the great Kaiju movies back in the heyday. The story has a monster known as Guilala attacking cities in Asia. The world is saved by some a monster called Take-Majin, a spoof on the Giant Majin maybe..
If this was a serious movie it could have been outstanding, but it was meant as a comedy and to me it was just goofy. Id rather watch the X from Outer Space or Giant Majin than to sit through this movie again with its failing attempts at humor. The characters were dumb, the monsters fighting was lousy. After watching this I think its time to put giant monster movies from Asia to pasture. Guilala could be a cool creature given a serious attempt and a good budget. It is a cool design and would love to have him battle other Kaiju (not necessarily Godzilla)in a serious film.
Unfunny, not very entertaining. I love monster movies and Kaiju films & between this movie and Gamera the Brave I have lost interest. I will take the 60s films over all this modern garbage anyday",1249603200,,1082,4.388059701492537
3831844,3,B0021BSOFY,"I like this one better than most online reviewers do. Mind you: on fire it's not going to set the world, and the humor is sophomoric, at best. But MONSTER X STRIKES BACK is amusing in its goofy fashion, and what else would you expect from the director of THE CALAMARI WRESTLER?

I, too, would like to have seen more monster action with Guilala, who was last seen in 1967's THE X FROM OUTER SPACE. (LONG overdue for a USA DVD release, though I have the Japanese DVD, which is fine) The costume and FX are so similar to the '67 film that you have to believe it was by design. Guilala's foe, Take-Majin, parodies both Dai Majin and Ultraman-type characters, and is voiced by ""Beat"" Takashi Kitano (ZATOICHI). Though the jokes are sometimes amusing, better actors and writing would have been helpful...again, the lousy acting may have been on purpose.

Old-time kaiju fans will note the presence of Yosuke Natsuki (DOGORA) and Susumu Kurobe (ULTRAMAN) as military officials. And, yes, that is Toshiya Wazaki as Dr. Sano. Wazaki portrayed CAPTAIN Sano, Commander of AAB-Gamma, in THE X FROM OUTER SPACE.

Not a total fiasco, but a coulda-woulda-shoulda sort of movie. Fans of classic kaiju eiga should find it reasonably diverting. As always for Tokyo Shock, video quality is fine...TS has released many worthwhile discs of these Japanese titles, and I hope they release more.",1247356800,14,1371,4.825531914893617
3831845,2,B0021BSOFY,"If you love giant monster movies this is probably not for you.
The acting is so bad it's painful to watch, I'm suprised the actors
could keep a straight face during the goings on.
When I saw this I was hoping for a remake along the lines of what
was done with the Gamera franchise but no such luck.",1247184000,7,298,4.067796610169491
3831846,1,B0021BSOFY,"I love japanese monster flicks, and when I heard about another Guilala movie i couldn't wait to see this. Boy, I could have waited for this one!!
A very failed attempt at satire and parody, ""Monster X Strikes Back"" could have been a real gem if it had been done right. Not the case here!
During a summit meeting in Japan, a Chinese rocket crashes and the resulting explosion creates the monster Guilala, who promptly goes on the typical rampage. The beginning of his "" rampage"" is mostly stock footage from the original Guilala movie, (X From Outer Space, here in the States), and the new footage is mostly in the second half and basically consists of the monster standing in an open valley and a ""rampage' through some power lines. The ""new"" Guilala does look just like the old except for its red claws, and still makes basically the same sound as the original with some screechy sounds added in.
Film follows the failed attempts of different world emissaries in combatting the monster. The actors portraying these leaders are all terrible, even though they do speak in their proper languages.
This could have been better if they had focused more on thre monster action, but instead it is a talky, drawn out and very UN funny fiasco.
There is a surprise revelation  of one of the characters, and a Majin type character at the end which may or may not be a nod to Daiei's highly impressive Daimajin character, which this one does not rival at all, plus it TALKS> The final ""battle"" between Guilala and this ""Take-majin"" is unimpressive.
It may have been intentional that the movie seems so bad, but it doesn't work as a ""good"" bad movie, it is just a BAD bad movie!!
Stick with ""The X From Outer Space""!!!!",1246579200,2,1706,4.593442622950819
3831847,3,B0021BSOFY,"ok, probably be better if I understood Japanese, funny lines don't translate well with subtitles. Don't remember original being comedy",1424736000,,134,5.75
3831848,4,B0021BSOFY,"Despite the other reviews stating that this movie is basically a comedy, I went into it not really knowing what to expect. I therefore purchased my copy of Monster X Strikes Back - Attack the G8 Summit, with some trepidation.  As a long time kaiju fan, there's nothing that puts a smile on my face like some good old-fashioned man-in-suit-stomping-cheesy-miniature-buildings, giant monster action.  And when you end up having two or more of those monsters in the same film, duking it out and putting the smackdown on one another - well, that's just the icing on the cake.

That being said, I will also admit that I usually like my giant monster action to have at least some serious overtones, ala Godzilla Raids Again, or Godzilla vs Mothra.  I suppose that the aforementioned ""comedy"" aspect was my greatest fear when I first put this disc into my DVD player.  Even my beloved King Kong vs Godzilla, possibly my favorite kaiju film of all time, was not what I would consider an outright comedy, though it does contain many amusing bits.  I was almost expecting Monster X to be as groan-worthy and cringe-inducing as such films as Godzilla's Revenge, or Godzilla on Monster Island.  Even though I am happy to have them in my DVD collection, I can honestly say that I very seldom watch those titles, for just those very reasons.

Much to my joy and relief, Monster X Strikes Back proved to be a deliriously delightful, modern-day kaiju film.  While a great deal of the film is indeed played for laughs (some of which fall pretty flat), the overall look and feel of it brings back wonderful memories of Saturday afternoon matinees, watching giant monsters cavort on the screen, when all the while, we puny humans are trying to concoct any number of outlandish schemes to try and subdue them.  Monster X (aka Guilala) himself is about as goofy-looking a kaiju as has ever appeared in any film of this type, having been introduced 40 years earlier in 1968's The X From outer Space.  This 2008 homage is not really a sequel to that earlier film, though it does contain a few not-so-obscure references to its predecessor.

With all the good things Monster X Strikes Back has going for it, there are definitely a few aspects of it I would have liked to have seen handled in a bit different way.  Such as Guilala's giant adversary near the end of the film, the ""legendary"" Take-Majin.  While impressive in his glittering gold cheesiness, his propensity for rattling off one-liners and snide comments directed at his opponent is something I could have easily done without.  The same can be said for a couple of the ridiculously hair-brained schemes devised by the G8 attendees to rid the Earth of Guilala.  And why in the world does the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom not have even the slightest trace of a British accent?  Watching the trailer, I thought perhaps he was supposed to be the U.S. President.  And last but not least, there's is Guilala's little ""dance"" midway through the movie, which, while amusing, was fortunately kept mercifully short.  One thing I did appreciate a lot, is that involvement of cutesy little Japanese kids, while alluded to with a knowing wink, was kept to a minimum.  Goodness knows the adult actors involved acted childish enough (in particular, the world ""leaders""), without having to resort to adding little kids to the mix!

But these few things aside, I really cannot help but give Monster X Strikes Back a solid four stars.  Had I written this review immediately after my first viewing, I may have leaned more toward a three star rating.  But a subsequent viewing proved to be even more enjoyable, as I think I may have finally ""got it"" the second time around.  Even if you are a die-hard kaiju fan from years gone by, as long as you are willing to accept the idea of someone have a good bit of fun with the genre, while at the same time, delivering a lovingly warped homage to it,  you might just find yourself enjoying Monster X Strikes Back - Attack the G8 Summit, as much as I did.",1424044800,4,4023,4.664305949008498

3831850,5,B0021BSOFY,"OK... The movie itself is barely two-stars but this is a MUST WATCH for any kaiju fan! This gem pokes fun at every grand cliche from Godzilla, Gamera, Ultraman and pretty much everything else from Toho's tokusatsu and kaiju eiga library. How did that kid get here? An implied romance that actually blossoms? Hair-brained super-science? Bad ""stock"" footage? Disguise surprise? All this... And MORE!!",1413676800,,398,5.234375

3831852,5,B0021BSOFY,This movie was a great giant monster feature . I just loved the dancers and dance in the village . I loved every thing about this movie from its beginning to its end . No real down time at all .,1375660800,,194,3.7560975609756095
3831853,1,B0021BSOFY,"I think spoofing Japanese monster movies is a great idea...but this sure ain't a great movie.

In fact, this is a two-joke movie, and that's not nearly enough to sustain a feature-length narrative. Joke #1: the monster costumes in Japanese movies look stupid, so of course the villain in this movie looks stupid. Joke #2: most world leaders are vain and ineffectual, and their incompetence would be ruthlessly exposed if a giant, Godzilla-type monster were to attack us in reality. (Agreed on that point.)

Each of these jokes is funny, for about 30 seconds. But what about the rest of the movie? Mostly, it consists of boring non-characters standing around in conference rooms, trying to figure out how to deal with the rampaging monster. There's very little action, very little character development, and (here's the real problem) very little in the way of actual jokes. I suppose the world leaders are supposed to be funny -- they include parodies of such ridiculous politicians as Silvio Berlusconi and Nicolas Sarkozy -- but they're played by such atrocious actors that their scenes are more cringe-inducing than amusing.

Speaking of atrocious things, Minoru Kawasaki's directing is no picnic either. The film contains precisely zero interesting shots, and looks even cheaper than a TV production. Indeed, I've seen 30-year-old episodes of Blakes' 7 with more thrilling spectacle than this amateurish effort. What's the point of spoofing Godzilla movies for being lame and cheap, if your movie is 100 times cheaper and lamer?

In short, you can skip this one. I've occasionally read some positive reviews, usually from Japanese movie fans who consider this a legitimately witty spoof of the ""kaiju"" genre. But it's not a witty spoof, it's just dreadful -- really, one of the worst movies I've seen in years. If you like Godzilla, you'll probably be annoyed to see it satirized so ineptly; and if you don't like Godzilla, you won't get the two jokes anyway.",1374624000,,1962,5.046296296296297

3831855,4,B0021BSOFY,"Most people probably don't know of the monster Guilalla. Let's face it he's not as reconizable as Godzilla or even Gamera. But for this japanese giant monster fan,i know him all to well. Guilalla first appeared in the 1967 film the x from outer space. It was Shochiku studios who put the film out to capitalize on the japanese monster boom of the 1960's. 40 years later he's back in a political satire and a funny homage to the films that inspired it. You would enjoy this movie more if your a fan of the genre,however even if you saw one Godzilla flick you can still get the joke. MEDIA BLASTERS put out a good presentation of the dvd,but you have to be tolerable of subtitles there is no english dub. I enjoyed it,but then again rubber suit monsters can't do no wrong in my eyes.",1318550400,,781,4.3561643835616435
3831856,4,B0021BSOFY,"While meant to be a spoof of kaiju films, using a monster (Guilala aka Monster-X) once described as ""endearingly goofy"", this film sometimes decides to take itself seriously and it messes up the experience and gives the impression that the Japanese are willing to poke fun at everything but themselves.  Learn to ignore those scenes and the rest of the film is pretty funny.

Kaiju folks will want this, but considering the amount of inside jokes i wouldn't want this film to be one of the first kaiju films I'd show someone just getting into them.",1306886400,,548,4.697916666666667
