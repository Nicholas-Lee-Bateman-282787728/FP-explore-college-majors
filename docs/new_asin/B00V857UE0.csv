8709580,3,B00V857UE0,"This DVD is a re-issue of a 1991 recording and consists of two items. The first is an 82 minute documentary, When the Fire Burns and that is followed by a performance of Nights in the Gardens of Spain played by Larrocha and the Montreal S.O. conducted by Dutoit.

The documentary is a fascinating and detailed exploration of the composer drawing upon interviews with a range of people with considerable personal knowledge of de Falla, plus copious archive footage illustrating life as de Falla would have experienced it is both Spain and France and later, in Argentina where he died just short of 70 years old.

There is a great deal of illustrative music played by a range of associated players including Alicia de Larrocha, Teresa Berganza, and the harpist Zabaleta. Ensembles feature the Montreal orchestra under Dutoit as well as the Spanish ballet. These provide a certain authenticity, especially the dancers from the Spanish Ballet, but the Flamenco influence in the earlier works as demonstrated by dancers and the singers, both individual and in ensemble, and the remarkable flamenco style of singing delivered by Carmen Cassarubius in excerpts from La Vida Breve resonate strongest in the memory.

This earlier part of de Fallas output is undoubtedly what has remained in the public domain since his death, despite his wish that it would never be played again. It becomes clear that the composer had substantial psychological conflicts in his make-up and that these were intensified by continuing ill health. The conflict between the explicit sensuous nature of the opera La Vida Breve, and the ballet El Amor Brujo and his own Catholic beliefs and his driven need to attend confession was never resolved. Not surprisingly he never married nor did he have any known relationship with the opposite sex.

Following the Spanish Civil War and the barbarities that accompanied it and the way it affected his associates and friends dominated the rest of this life and resulted in his moving to Argentina.  The music that he wrote during this second half of his life was radically different to the first half. There is little or none of the Flamenco influence and the music becomes inward looking, lyrical and far more discordant.

The performance of the Nights by Larrocha, Dutoit and the Montreal orchestra is as idiomatic as one might expect. The same team had made an earlier recording in 1983 for Decca. This 1991 recording was also made by Decca and is accompanied by much film footage illustrating the images that Falla was illustrating in his music. This is of lesser technical quality (16bit/48kHz) than that of the CD version which has long been a best seller of the repertoire. However it is the film illustrations that are the greatest value of this part of the disc and it should be for those that it should be judged.

The documentary is a more contentious problem technically. The visual element of the recording is of the standard that one would expect from a Standard Definition recording of 1991 and has survived well. However the whole of the musical soundtrack is severely deteriorated and, to be perfectly candid, requires more than a little tolerance. The soundtrack of the interviews throughout the documentary is not affected.

The issue here is how to balance the content of the documentary with its adequate visual quality and the failure of the musical element of the soundtrack. The answer may be to consider whether the documentary could be re-made today and the answer is a resounding No. The interviewees are now far too old or deceased, the remarkable authenticity of the Flamenco artists would be hard if not impossible to recreate. The earthy and compelling singing of Carmen Cassarubiur is probably a matchless example of the idiom.

So much of this documentary is therefore unrepeatable and is therefore a priceless record. Collectors will have to make a choice weighing up these issues. This is both a unique document and documentary about de Falla, the times he lived through and the influences that drove him.",1432684800,3,4051,4.971935007385524
