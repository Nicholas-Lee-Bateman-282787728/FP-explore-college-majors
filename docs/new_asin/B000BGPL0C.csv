8086408,3,B000BGPL0C,"I purchased this 3D video thinking that it would have a 2D option like the other nWave 3D videos. But it doesn't. So unless you have the required HQFS (High Quality Field Sequential) hardware (analog TV, transmitter, and shutter glasses - all of which is now obsolete) all you can see with a modern digital tv is the blurry picture of both videos feeds being shown on top of each other.

So unless you have access to that sort of hardware - skip buying this video.",1395187200,2,464,4.395348837209302
8086409,5,B000BGPL0C,"Being a sequel to ""Encounter in the Third Dimension"", I was curious to see what nWave was going to do story wise to continue the adventures of the Professor and Max, since they were stuck in the 2nd dimension at the end of the original film.  Gladly, they chose to start this movie up directly after the events of the first and give a wonderful history on how the eye works and how it ""sees"" 3D, all in 40 plus minutes of excellent stereo depth examples to demonstrate the process.  I love this movie as much or better than the first one.  Kids will highly enjoy it as well.  A perfect way to teach and entertain at the same time without them getting bored.  As for us adults, you'll re-learn trivia that has either slipped into the cracks of your mind or understand something you didn't know before until now.  Like the first film, the 3D effects in this one are amazing.  Granted, you don't get another full roller coaster experience, but all the other dimensional situations and places are just as cool.  Even better, there's going to be a third 3D film to make this series a trilogy and it will be about the 4th dimension.  Sure wish it was available now.  If you're an IMAX 3D DVD collector, get ""Misadventures"".  You won't be disappointed.",1134691200,3,1245,4.464601769911504
8086410,2,B000BGPL0C,"This is a sequel to ""Encounter in the Third Dimension"", thankfully without Elvira.  It goes into more detail about 3D movies than its predecessor, but more is less here.  The first movie had far more interesting 3D tidbits.  This just seems a bit tired.  3D isn't bad though, and the field-sequential 3D enthusiasts out there should pick it up.",1134518400,,344,4.779661016949152
