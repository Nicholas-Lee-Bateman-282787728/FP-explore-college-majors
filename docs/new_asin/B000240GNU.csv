8021842,3,B000240GNU,"This DVD has several things going for it, and several things against it. On the good side, it's a real wood fire, not gas logs, and you can actually see the fire being poked with a poker a few times and it gives off sparks. Nice. Also, the fireplace isn't shown excessively, so your TV becomes the fireplace. Now, the bad stuff. There is no option to turn off the Christmas music and have only the crackling sounds of the fire, which means if you're going to watch it outside of the immediate christmas season, you'll probably want to turn the sound completely off and just enjoy the view of the fire. Should you choose to listen to the Christmas music, be prepared for it to be generic versions of Christmas songs by artists who are competant, but unrecognizable. You may even want to mute the TV and play your own favorite Christmas album, although my family enjoys the music on the disc just fine. My wife and I use it during the holiday season but we have since purchased a better DVD for outside the season. This disc is a steal for the price it's offered at, and will warm the heart of even the coldest Scrooge! Merry Christmas to all this year and thanks for reading my review.",1253232000,,1184,4.386363636363637
