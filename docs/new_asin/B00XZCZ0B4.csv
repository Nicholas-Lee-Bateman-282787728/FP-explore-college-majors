7204388,5,B00XZCZ0B4,A great movie for my trip to England. I only saw the previews as yet but they made me want this movie to watch on my ipad,1437177600,,121,3.5185185185185186
7204389,5,B00XZCZ0B4,"Very good film.  I saw this in Los Angeles at the movie theater. The romantic relationship between Alex Holdridge and Linnea Saasen is great, they later married in real life.  Rupert Friend plays the best friend and Jason Ritter makes an appearance in the film. It's a great romantic movie with a lot of European locations.",1470096000,,323,4.75
7204390,1,B00XZCZ0B4,"Obvoiusly the main actor was the writer. He wasn't very good at acting. heck, he wasn't very good at writing either, as the story seems like he was telling fact, but it didn't come acros as beleivable. The back and forth between his GF and her employer made it seem like the decisions were made by high schoolers. And then, the main guy also had the same weird back and forth with his employer.

The guy's GF didn't seem to know acting well either. The characters reacted to situations like they were from another planet. My wife and I both felt the same way about the film..",1468713600,,575,4.373831775700935
7204391,3,B00XZCZ0B4,It's a love story where signal get crossed.,1468540800,,43,4.5
7204392,5,B00XZCZ0B4,"Excellent film. Slice of life. Combines aspects of illustration with film well. Comes close yet doesn't really break the fourth wall, even with voice over parts/narration. You keep wondering about characters as film progresses. Everything isn't tied up with a bow, which is nice. Things often take a turn you might not expect.

Definitely pays some have to Linklater's Before/After series, yet original so that it doesn't seem a copycat at all.",1468108800,,444,5.166666666666667

7204414,4,B00XZCZ0B4,Partly I loved it. The characters were really well developed and the acting was fantastic. It would have been perfect if only Rupert had an end to his story. But it did have a happy ending in part that was beautiful.,1455062400,,216,4.2926829268292686

7204457,5,B00XZCZ0B4,"This was a simply magical indie journey through what Inunderstand to be a real life true story of two people from completely opposite worlds coming together and the roller coaster ride they share during the incredible journey. You can feel the chemistry coming through the screen.  Holdridge does an incredible job as a very believable Woody Allen type of neurotic character and Linnea Sassen was beautifully innocent yet an educated presence with great responses to her counterpart... The side story features Rupert Friend and is unusually interesting . Great ending , unpredictable and a fun watch!",1451779200,,600,5.25
7204458,2,B00XZCZ0B4,"As far as a low budget or independent film goes, I suppose it hits the mark. But the film left a lot to be desired. If I could un-watch it, and spend the time watching something different, I would.",1451606400,,197,4.076923076923077

Very authentic.",1451520000,,346,5.86

7204462,5,B00XZCZ0B4,We loved In Search of a Midnight Kiss (also by Holdridge) and so decided to check out Meet Me In Montenegro.  It's a great unconventional love story with quirky characters and many laughs.  It's a more realistic love story mixed with lifes curve balls than a lot of what hollywood puts out.  We highly recommend for a cozy date night.,1446940800,3,334,4.533333333333333

7204465,5,B00XZCZ0B4,"Linnea Sassen should become better known.  And her dancing.  Incredible gamble, initiative, faith, hope, etc., to even begin this project.  Then carrying it through led to extraordinary experiences.  Viewers need to do the research to find the story behind the making of the movie.  This process is ""different in kind"" from anything you've seen.  The story the movie tells about the main characters, or one substantially the same, actually happened to the actors playing the roles, who also wrote, produced and directed.  Ms. Sassen, beginning with no experience, learned how to cut scenes during the process and became the main film editor, a crucial function in the success of a film.

8717142,1,B00XZCZ0B4,"ok, here goes...  DON'T.  the male/female leads were not interesting enough to keep my interest.  Rupert Friend, however, is a fine actor but I can't for the life of me understand how he got trapped into this loser of a disjointed film.  wish I could have the time BACK that I invested in this wanting production.",1492128000,,313,4.535714285714286
8717143,4,B00XZCZ0B4,"Odd film, not typical. Not a feel good film, but not a film of sadness, violence, and macho stuff. It was good. I liked it. I won't watch it again but I could. A movie of tease, and the feeling of not knowing relationship with any sure trust.",1488326400,,242,4.0625
8717144,5,B00XZCZ0B4,"'Meet Me in Montenegro' is a refreshing take on a classic - stories of love. The film is smartly written with wit (not sarcasm), beautifully shot and well acted - in beautiful surroundings (Berlin, Montenegro...) It quite accurately depicts artists and the inherent dilemmas of pursuing art when people (Love) get in the way - or not, as the case may be. Smart film, well done. I look forward to seeing more by these talented young writer-filmmakers - (fellow Atlantan) Alex Holdridge & Sinnea Saasen. Rupert Friend is brilliant as always & again - it's refreshing to see him in this role.",1485388800,3,589,4.784313725490196

8717148,5,B00XZCZ0B4,"I came across this movie by accident when I was checking out Rupert Friend's IMBD page.  He is so amazing on Homeland, I was curious what else he has been in.  I was happy to come across this delightful romantic comedy which is original and non-formulaic, while still pulling at all the right heart strings for a rom-com.
