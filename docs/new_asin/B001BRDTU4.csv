8640740,5,B001BRDTU4,"1st off let me state this dvd came directly from amazon.com I seen some ""buyers"" say it came from japan and was bootlegged and what not. They must not have ordered from amazon because when i got my dvd it was sealed, the quality was great, the dvd was an actual pressed up dvd not a dvd-r like these buyers claimed. it almost seems these guys are those no life kids who hound the internet hate'n on other peoples stuff.

Now on to the dvd. What can i say? The dvd is what the title says ""INSIDE DEATH ROW"" we get to see the offices of the legendary deathrow records, eavesdrop in conversations with some of the top people at the label at that time. Rare footage of 2pac that in itself is worth the small price for the dvd! I give this dvd a 5 outta 5. Cheap price, great quality, great product. Looking forward to volume 2!",1219708800,,823,4.176100628930818
8640741,1,B001BRDTU4,The dvd is clearly a bootleg of exceedingly poor quality. Shipping took upwards of three weeks and communication from the seller was non existent. Avoid this scam artist at all costs. You will only throw your money down the drain for his shoddy product. Flee from him like he is a starving fatty and you're a piece of chocolate cake.,1217548800,,333,4.566666666666666
8640742,1,B001BRDTU4,"i thought this was an official release but the truth is that this is just a dvd-r with a cheap custom cover. unfortunately the picture & sound quality is really poor too.
i can't express how disappointed i was when i received this BOOTLEG.",1217548800,,239,4.454545454545454
8640743,1,B001BRDTU4,"After placing an order for this item it took WEEKS for the item arrive.  Why the seller is located all the way in Japan is beyond me but they used the CHEAPEST surface mail possible after sitting on my order for several weeks.  On top of that, what I received was mind boggling.  The DVD is BURNED and not a real factory pressed item.  After doing a little bit of google searching I have discovered that the seller indeed PIRATED another DVD title being sold outside Amazon.  Crazy.  Why Amazon allows people like this is surprising, because they are nothing more than two bit bootleggers who steal the work of others for their own gain, all while delivering (SLOWLY) a very sub-par product that could be produced with an inkjet and a DVD-R.  Seriously.  You'd have a better experience getting mugged and then  walking over a football field of tabasco covered broken glass than paying for what you get (MAYBE?) here.",1217548800,,916,4.6397515527950315
