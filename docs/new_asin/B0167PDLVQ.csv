Winner of the Golden Bear in 2015. A must see!",1498867200,,295,4.784313725490196
8735788,5,B0167PDLVQ,"Like his other movies this is a brave work, this time, he shows people in the streets in Tehran, their daily life, their thoughts and their reactions to the events. The only deficiency was the mature dialogues between Panahi and the little girl. I rate it 5 of 5",1482883200,,262,4.36734693877551
8735789,5,B0167PDLVQ,"This is an interesting film. Merely cruising the streets of Tehran was enlightening. For a moment you forget where you are. The signs on the stores are in Arabic but otherwise you seem to be in a fairly modern city. Then little things hit your eye, like the completer absence of any, and I mean any American cars. when he stops in front of a dealership you see Mercedes, Porsche, Peugot, and Audi, but no American brands. The niece is adorable and when she lays out the rules from her teacher as to how to make a ""distributable"" film, the true value of the film is revealed. The discussion about the execution of some robbers, to set an example, and the two old ladies who discuss the mystical practices of the fish they are carrying all make this film a gem. It is a short film but well worth the watch for a reality check on what is going on in Iran.",1470355200,,852,4.265432098765432

  Iranian movie director Jafar Panahi has a half dozen feature length films to his credit.  They have received such accolades that every one of them has won awards at various international film festivals.  He has the respect of the international film community.  He also has the ire of the Iranian government.  In 2010 the government arrested him on the kind of absurd clap trap that third world piss pot dictators often turn to.  In short order he suffered conviction for the usual surrealistic and vague charges.  He received a six year sentence which he managed to have commuted to house arrest and eventually to confinement to the country.  But the brutal and ill humored government also banned him from movie making.
 Since the ban went into effect he has managed to make three illegal films.  'Jafar Pahahi's Taxi' is one of them.  The one hour and 22 minute film has the internationally famous director posing as a taxi driver.  He engages in a series of obviously staged vignettists with Iranian passengers.  Two passengers in particular stand out.  His young niece, maybe 11 years old, has supposedly enrolled in a film class at school.  Given her age this seems very unlikely.  She is a cute little gal though and we enjoy seeing her and hearing (or reading, Farsi is the language spoken, we have sub-titles) her aggressive banter with her famous uncle.  Panahi uses her to express his views on the deadening hand of the government on the Iranian film industry.  I found that segment to bring both mirth at the bright little girl and disgust at the government for being the savagely oppressive thing that it surely is.  The second well done segment has what amounts to a human rights lawyer speaking about her current case, a young woman in prison for over a hundred days for trying to watch a volley ball match.  Such things are forbidden in Iran.  Panahi has made sports events and women fans a recurring theme in his work.
 He did not spend much money to make this film (another of his three illegal films he named 'This is not a Film' and made it for a few thousand dollars).  The entire thing takes place in his taxi as he drives around picking up and letting out people.  He has a dash cam record the conversations.
 I like to watch around the edges of Iranian films, to see the streets, cars and the people.  It seems very strange to see very modern people using up to date cell phones all over a film which cannot be made legally.  Bizarre and horrid.
 This film is not rated but there is no violence or naked people.  May Jafar Panahi have the courage to out last the brutes that mis rule his suffering nation.",1467763200,2,2654,4.585106382978723

8735793,5,B0167PDLVQ,"Mr. Panahi apparently thrives on limits. Taxi, a road dream of his past films come back to instruct him, tease him, lead him further along the path of cinematic creativity and social and political commentary, is not a slice-of-life documentary like I had expected. All the passengers, from innocent to rough to precocious to angelic, seem all too real and are a joy to watch in their various depictions of personalities in Tehran. But, this is not coincidence. Panahi himself, the driver of this ""taxi"", maintains a neutral attitude throughout, in keeping with a dreamer, yet he has become his own star in this and in his previous ""This Is Not a Film"". We, as viewers, witness his creations almost as if by magic. When he ""leaves"" his own film (several times), the films within this film watch each other until the end when the car thief turns out to be entirely someone else. The levels and discourses of watcher and watched, of prison and freedom, of grace and punishment, and of reality and fiction are ultimately undone by the simple beauty of a flower. Five stars! See it!",1456963200,,1077,4.703703703703703
8735794,3,B0167PDLVQ,"Would have been a bit more interesting in having actual customers bravely convey their real concerns about freedom in Iran, but then their lives would have been at risk. So, this was the next best. Good to see that women have a bit more freedom than whatever you want to call is happening in Saudi Arabia and the growing strict Qur'an forced mors in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Would have liked a greater range of characters including cleric and ""morality police"" types included in the montage.
Would also have liked to see more of Tehran and surrounding areas.

Couldn't figure out how the camera in the taxi moved so easily and with a variety of angles to film events, but effective any way.",1456876800,2,692,4.663934426229508
8735795,4,B0167PDLVQ,"Jafar Panahi's Taxi is not your usual film by any stretch of the imagination.  To put it into any context at all, you have to start with the knowledge that the director, Jafar Panahi (This is Not a Film, Offside, The Circle) has been barred since 2010 by Iran's Revolutionary Court from making films in Iran and from leaving the country.  So Panahi must resort to unusual tactics and legal stratagems to make any kind of film at all, and one of the results of this approach is his latest film, Taxi.

The basic setup for Taxi is simple.  A film director who's not allowed to make films (Panahi, playing himself) is driving a taxi around Tehran picking up fares. But he has a camera set up on the dashboard of the taxi - not hidden but in plain sight - recording everything.  At first the camera is pointed outward and you see the streets of Tehran that the taxi is driving on, but when Panahi picks up his first fare, he turns the camera around to record his passengers who engage in conversation, first with him, then with each other (apparently it is common practice in Tehran for taxis to stop and pick up additional fares who may - or may not - be going the same way that their initial fare is going).  The conversations range from mundane to lively to heated to just plain strange.  But all offer some insight into life in current-day Iran, and most particularly as the film goes on, into how difficult it is to express any view that the Revolutionary Court does not want expressed.

One of the things that's interesting in this approach is that in Taxi, Panahi has reduced film-making to a microcosm. The taxi is his studio, where he is not only the director and writer but also character and cameraman. And you see the film as it is being made.  Or at least that is the feeling you get, which is quite intentional. Another interesting thing is the way the film comes across. At first, you're not sure if what you're watching is a documentary or something along the lines of reality-TV, because there is a natural, unstaged feel to the people getting in and out of Panahi's taxi and to the conversations they have. After a while, you realize that in fact it is all staged, but it has been done so smoothly and so seamlessly that it sucks you into its projection of reality, and even when the realization comes, you still feel that you're seeing something real because even though the characters and situations have been staged, the things they say have the ring of underlying truth to them.

It is remarkable that the actors Panahi used in making Taxi were non-professionals because they do such a great job of performing in a completely natural way.  The only 'actor' whose name is known is Hana Saeidi, Panahi's real-life niece who appears - quite engagingly - as herself in the film, completely stealing the scenes she's in. The reason that none of the other actors' names are known is because Taxi has no opening or closing credits. It simply begins, and then later ends, with only a note at the end explaining that the lack of credits was a necessary legal maneuver so that his film would not be judged as a ""releasable"" film and therefore subject to the Iranian film rules.

Highly recommended.",1446768000,10,3206,4.527681660899654
