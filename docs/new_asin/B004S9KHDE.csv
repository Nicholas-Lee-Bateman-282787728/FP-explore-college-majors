8439583,3,B004S9KHDE,"the tracks playing in the background [music: Gaurav Dayal] are in sync with the mood of the film. Special mention must be made of the background score ' Gaurav Dayal [effective], cinematography ' Fasahat Khan [appealing] and editing ' M. Rafique [crisp].

The performances spring a pleasant surprise. Sanjay Suri, a dependable actor, is in top form yet again. The film has a bunch of new characters, but the ones who stand out are Aditya Seal [playing Siddharth, the rich, spoilt brat], Mandhar Subhash [Viru] and Anuj Pandit [Guri]. All three are excellent. Prateek Jain [Mahipal] and Madhur Mittal [Shakeel] are alright. Manoj Pahwa is fantastic yet again and provides ample laughs. Sachin Khedekar is alright. Vinay Pathak gets limited scope. Shraddha Nigam is effective.
