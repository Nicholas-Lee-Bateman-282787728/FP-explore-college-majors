662203,5,6303471587,"One of the Best films of the last 20 years, Blow out is De Palma's Masterpiece.  Perhaps the best of all Paranoid conspiracy thrillers, it  contains a stunning performance from john Travolta and very emotive one  from Nancy Allen.  Both actors sparkle with onscreen presence and  chemistry.  It's credentials are stunning , With De Palma, Zsigmond, and  Paul Hirsch all behind the camera.  Along with Apocalypse Now and Raging  Bull, one of the best American films of it's era",965865600,,476,4.924050632911392
662204,5,6303471587,"Brian DePalma is one helluva showman, and when he nails the material with as much nerve, bite and sensual flourish as he does with this paranoid thriller, the results are breathtaking.  Nancy Allen is heartbreaking and  unusually character-driven as the prostitute; John Lithgow is all menace  and glowering evil as the madman.  But John Travolta is a jolt to your  senses as the emotional sound engineer: his character goes through a wild  series of transformations, brought on by a paranoia that is more than  justified, and the Kennedy-like murder that begins the movie in such a  stylish way.  Along with Carrie, this is one of DePalma's bleakest films,  and somehow that seems completely right; although it does not share that  film's horrific, nightmare-inducing final shock, it has its own nasty trick  up its sleeve.  Prepare to remember Blow Out.",961545600,7,855,5.0647482014388485
662205,2,6303471587,"What a disappointment. The actors went through the motions. I didn't care what happened by the end except that the movie be over. The ending was the best part of the film, though. It was unexpected. I did not find this film  suspenseful. I was bored by it.",954979200,2,256,4.333333333333333
662206,5,6303471587,"At first, you don't really know what to make of Brian DePalma's critically acclaimed 1981 political thriller.  Sure, at times DePalma's ""showy"" camera angles make it seem as if he is trying too hard to  be avante-garde.  Yet, the staggeringly amazing performances by John  Travolta as a sound technichian that inadvertantly tapes a presidential  candidate's murder and Nancy Allen as the woman who is with him at the time  of his death, alone is worth the investment of time and interest.  Allen  shows remarkable depth in her role as Sally and pulls off her New York  accent convincingly. John Travolta, too, gives an amazing performance --  one in which you almost feel the terror and frustration that Jack must be  feeling.  All in all, Travolta and Allen transend their stardom to the  point that you forget you are actually watching actors play a part.  Furthermore, there are strong showings from the supporting cast: John  Lithgow, eerily evil as the main protagonist and Dennis Franz, convincingly  sleazy as Sally's accomplice, (both playing against type characters) are  also enjoyable and solid.
DePalma directed Travolta and Allen in Carrie,  where they played the telekinetic teen's primary tormentors -- clearly,  this is a threesome that delivers wonderful results.  Interestingly enough,  Quentin Tarantino cites Blow Out as one his main cinematic  inspirations.
The acting coupled with the exquisite plot makes Blow Out a  must see.",945388800,5,1449,5.2043478260869565
662207,3,6303471587,"Like most thrillers by Brian DePalma, and unlike his latest thriller `Snake Eyes', 'Blowout'(from 1981) features a very strong ending that stays with you for a long time. Even though I'm a huge DePalma fan I didn't find  the movie that entertaining. It's far from bad but nor is it a great pic.  The critics liked it, but it didn't do that well at the box office.  However, like DePalmas 'Scarface', 'Carrie', 'Mission:Impossible',  'Obsession', 'Dressed to Kill' and 'Casualties of War' the finale is  dynamite. So all in all, maybe three and a half stars.",934588800,2,557,4.821052631578947
662208,5,6303471587,"I must have seen this movie about 10 times in my life.  I keep comming back to it because the action and drama in this particular film is so captivating and intriguing.  While watching John Travolta's character in  particular on screen, you cannot help but want him to solve the murder.  The processes he uses and insite he gains from his own profession as a  sound technition are very interesting to say the least.  You are left with  a heavy heart at the end of the film, but will always remember it.  4 stars  in my book.",923616000,,524,4.319587628865979

662343,5,6303471587,Blow Out is an extremely underrated thriller. It's one of De Palma's best films and one of John Travolta's best performances. It's thoroughly entertaining and intriguing with a terrific pace. De Palma's direction is flawless as with most of his films and I'm particularly fond of the excellent cinematography also as well as most of his films. John Lithgow also plays another incredible villain which is a huge plus. Blow Out was in the middle of an excellent streak De Palma was on in an incredible era of filmmaking.

662347,5,6303471587,"One of the best political thrillers and one of Brian de Palma's best films, Blow Out features John Travolta in top notch performance as a sound engineer for an independent film making company in Philadelphia which specializes in cheesy soft-porn/slasher films: while out recording night sounds on a creekside for his audio library he sees a car plunge into the water and dives in to save the female passenger but too late to save the male driver, who turns out to be a leading candidate for the US presidency.  Later, he realizes from the sounds he recorded that the blow out which caused the accident was caused by a gunshot, something which understandably the powers that be don't want known. Nancy Allen's deliberately flighty performance as the rescued woman provides a perfect foil to Travolta's solidness, and the convoluted plot unfolds through both obvious and subtle allusions to historical events (Chappaquiddick, Dallas) and classic cinema (the title's resemblance to Blow Up is not accidental, and the scenes of mayhem in public venues like a large train station or a patriotic fireworks display where the crowds have no idea what's happening are very Hitchcockian.) Rated R for elements which don't seem all that shocking today. An extremely interesting film. The Criterion special edition DVD is as good as you would expect.",1464912000,,1338,5.081818181818182

662350,5,6303471587,"There are a vocal minority of cinephiles (like Pauline Kael and Quentin Tarantino) who see Brian De Palma as one of the all-time great directors, and while I don't quite share that view, I do love a fair number of his films, and Blow Out is at the very top of the heap. On some level, this film plays like Alfred Hitchcock remaking Antonioni's Blow-Up, and the results are spectacular.

John Travolta gives one of his best performances as Jack Terry, a sound technician who works on low-budget horror movies. Quentin Tarantinos decision to cast him in Pulp Fiction was largely based on his performance in this film, and its not hard to see why; hes absolutely brilliant here. Similarly, Vilmos Zsigmonds cinematography is exceptional; this is one of the best-looking films Ive ever seen, and his use of a split-focus diopter lens (which allows objects in the foreground and background to simultaneously be in sharp focus) is stylistically dazzling.

Like Francis Ford Coppolas The Conversation, Blow Out seems to tap into a kind of post-Vietnam, post-Watergate, post-Kennedy assassination level of paranoia; what does it mean to discover that people in positions of power have done horrific things and have covered it up successfully? How does it feel to try to be a whistleblower and expose truth while powerful people are actively monitoring and surveilling your activities? The film has a lot of interesting ideas and it raises many interesting questions, but above all else, this is just a blast; it's the rare film that is both technically astonishing and hugely entertaining. Brian De Palma's Blow Out is a masterpiece, the best film of 1981, and one of the essential films of the 1980s.",1449446400,3,1693,4.957746478873239

662448,5,6303471587,"It has been many years since I have watched this film.  But I remember it very well and thought it was John Travolta's best film.  It is very much a sleeper movie that few people originally saw but few will forget.  The movie seemed so original and different from the types of movies coming out at the time.

I thought the concept was great and everything seemed so real.  This is probably the best espionage thriller I have ever seen alongside Gene Hackman in the Conversation.  The non happy ending seemed much more realistic to what would actually happen in real life.  The scream used for the movie at the end of the movie will haunt John's character forever.

Blow out is one of those movies you just happen to watch a little bit and end up watching the rest of the film to see what happens.  Nancy Allen most people remember either for Robocop or for Carrie but she did a very nice job in this film as well. I wish half the movies coming out in Hollywood would have the depth this film has.

To me Blow Out is easily a 5 star movie.  It is a little slow at first but the tension and character development build nicely.  Travolta and De Palma should be very proud of this film.",1440374400,2,1182,4.274774774774775

662451,5,6303471587,"If you love John Travolta and Nancy Allen together in a movie (Carrie, 1976), this one is another gem!  Soundman Travolta works for an independent movie company looking for good sound effects, mainly a good ""scream"" for their current horror project. So, in the process of getting some new sound effects one evening, he is witness to an accident. A car goes off the bridge and plunges into a lake, submerging the car. He delves into the water and pulls character Nancy Allen from the water. The man apparently is deceased already upon seeing the body inside the car.
What transpires in the following days is a matter of political coverup for the Governor that died in the car, a murderer involved in the accident known as the ""Liberty Day"" killer, and Travolta's character falling for that of Nancy Allen, a professional call girl.
It's a well done movie and one of John and Nancy's best in their respective careers. (Nancy would also do ""Dressed To Kill"".)

662563,5,6303471587,"Blow Out is considered by many critics as the best film from director Brian Depalma. I am a great admirer of his best films. His best films are his murder mystery thrillers. In his prime he developed his own style that included using split screen scenes. He was heavily influenced by Alfred Hitchcock. Blow Out is his best mystery suspense thriller. It stars John Travolta in the best performance he's ever given in any film. He plays someone who records sounds for cheap low budget horror movies. One night he's out recording sounds with his tape recorder by a bridge. Then he records a speeding car that flys off the bridge because of a blow out. He rescues a woman out of the car but cannot save the man she was with. Back at the hospital he finds out the man who was killed in the crash was a presidential candidate. His advisors tell travolta to forget about the woman he saved. They do not want the public to know he was having an affair with another woman because it would cause a scandal. But travolta is troubled by this cover up. He makes friends with the woman he saved but he becomes obsessed with the recording he recorded of the blow out. He believes it wasn't an actual blow out of a tire but actually it was shot out by gun fire. As the film goes on it becomes an intricate mystery as travolta tries to find out the truth. Nancy Allen plays Sally, the woman travolta saves and falls in love with. Dennis Franz plays a sleazy photographer who took pictures of the car accident because he was told to. John Lithgow plays Burke, the man who shot the tire out with his rifle and has to cover up all evidence. The movie has surprises and tragedy. It also contains a great musical score by Depalma regular Pino Donaggio particularly the tragic love theme. If you are a fan of Depalma, Travolta, and classic murder mystery suspense thrillers, i highly reccomend this movie.",1413244800,3,1882,4.457971014492753

662632,3,6303471587,"Blow Out  (1981). Rated R. Running time: One, 47 mins.
Directed and written by Brian De Palma.
This Criterion Collection DVD contains 2 discs and a 32-page booklet.
 Disc One is the movie which has a restored digital transfer supervised and approved by director Brian De Palma.

At a college dorm of young woman, a security guard watches from outside into the window of two females dancing in their sexy bedroom-wear in their room. Suddenly someone comes up from behind the guard and stabs him. Then the murderer is inside the dorm. We see other naughty things going on. The murderer comes up to a woman in a shower. He lifts the knife up and the woman screams.
  It's only a movie we are watching. Jack Terry (John Travolta) doesn't care for the scream and neither does the producer.  It is the woman's real scream that sounds so terrible. It is Jack's job as a sound effects technician to find the just the right sounds for a movie. Since the producer did not like the sound of the wind either, Jack's goes to a park and stands on a bridge with his recording device and rod microphone to capture the sounds of wind, but also other sounds of the night. He hears a frog, an owl, and can even hear the conversation of two people from far away. Then unexpectedly, he hears something like a blow-out and sees a car smash into a phone booth, hit the railing on another bridge and crashes into the water. Jack runs down into the water and swims to the car. We see someone running away up to the bridge. A woman is trapped in the car. Jack manages to break the window and helps her escape. Her name is Sally (Nancy Allen). At the hospital, Jack finds out the driver of the car was Governor McRyan (John Hoffmeister). He died in the accident. Mr. Henry (John McMartin) comes up to Jack and warns him to forget the girl and forget he ever saw her. Mr. Henry says the Governor could have been the next President of the United States.
  This puts Jack into a tight spot to keep his mouth shut. Jack's involvement with this girl and the mystery is only the beginning in this thriller.

Also in the cast: Dennis Franz, John Lithgow, Peter Boyden, Curt May, John Aquino.

Filmed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

662636,2,6303471587,"Spoiler free (and succinct) review:  This movie is bad.  If you are seeking a griping and intellectual thriller, watch ""The Conversation.""  As for the Blu-Ray itself, the audio and video are about what you'd expect from a film of this age and budget and the extras are robust.

**SPOILER ALERT**

Why was the Governor barreling down the road at high speeds?

Why didn't Burke simply shoot Jack and Sally?  He knew where they lived, worked and had no qualms about murder.  And clearly, he was an excellent shot having already sniped the tire of the Governor's speeding car at night.

Why on Earth would Jack, as paranoid as he had become and after realizing his phone may have been tampered with, illogically risk Sally's life by allowing her to meet someone who, via telephone, told her that he was Jack's journalist contact.  The same contact, mind you, who Sally told Jack had been trying to reach him all afternoon.

So, why didn't Jack call the journalist back and confirm the details to make sure Sally wasn't walking into a trap?  It was previously established that Jack had the journalist's number, having just called him hours before.  And surely, this journalist, having already expressed a strong desire to meet with Jack and set up an interview, would not mind if Jack tagged along, right?  Right.

Why didn't Jack at least visually observe the meeting from a safe distance in case the person claiming to be his journalist contact turned out to be oh, I don't know . . . one of the bad guys they had been hiding from most of the movie?  Jack surely could have prevented Sally from being casually escorted to her death, right?  Right.

Instead, Jack puts a wire on Sally, drops her off at the meeting place, and sits at a useless distance.  Sally is strangled to death.  Jack kills the killer.  The conspiracy is forgotten about.  And Jack uses the dying scream of Sally--recorded by the wire--to top off a B-movie he had been working on.

662708,5,6303471587,"Brian De Palma has made a career out of copying his favorite directors and movies and modernizing their themes and styles to create a diverse filmography that either works tremendously or fails miserably.  He rarely has a film that is just `ok'.  When De Palma is at the top of his game is when he rifts off of films or directors that infused more style than substance, which allows De Palma to manipulate that style and create something that feels more substantial.

`Blow Out' is one of those films.

Clearly influenced in concept by Antonioni's 1966 film `Blowup', `Blow Out' uses a very similar storyline (with minor tweaks) to create and even more involved and engrossing `original' idea.  That is what I love so much about this film.  While I can see the influence front and center, it never feels like a cheap imitation.  The fact that I feel that Antonioni's film is a failed attempt to create something special doesn't hurt, for De Palma's reinterpretation feels much richer and fuller and far better executed.

The film follows a sound man who accidentally witnesses a murder (car crash) and becomes tangled in a web of deceit and conspiracy as he begins to dig deeper into the murder only to meet a wall, as no one wants to look into it.  He's alone, and considered a whack-job and everything eventually spirals out of control as threats mount and danger looms, especially once a ruthless psychopath (and effectively creepy John Lithgow) begins to hunt down the lone survivor of the car crash.

Atmosphere looms all over every sequence, as De Palma pours himself into every scene.  This may be his most decadent film, dripping with style galore and yet never sacrificing substance.  This film speaks loudly, and those hushed aural tones are to die for.  The theatrical merits of the film definitely elevate each moment, giving us something that is truly special!",1381276800,,1873,4.815625

662713,2,6303471587,"Released in 1981, Blow Out actually belongs in the pantheon of the conspiracy flicks of the 1970's...I speak of 3 Days of the Condor,the Parallax View, The Conversation and Winter Kills.

The fact that unlike Condor and Parallax which were well written and superbly directed, Blow Out doesn't hold up due to a uneven script, unintentionally funny dialogue and a performance by its leading lady that is so incomprehensively terrible. it drags the whole project down to the level of a high school play.

De Palma should have avoided nepotism....Casting Nancy Allen (Mrs. De Palma at the time) is akin to John Mc Cain's choice of Sarah Palin as his running mate....
not only can't she act her way out of a paper bag, she compounds the problem by affecting a phony nasality which makes her come off like Fran Drescher on steroids...

To be sure Blow Out has its moments....Travolta's matching the magazine photos of the assassination with the sound he recorded on the scene, borders on masterful......as a matter of fact Dennis Frantz' character of photographer Manny Karp is like a Bowery Boys version of Abraham Zapruder.....

The rave reviews of this film on the site are pretty comical too....Blow Out is not quite as terrible as Dressed to Kill, but it comes pretty close.....Pauline Kael's rave review reprinted for this DVD release leads one to believe the rumor that she may have been a shill for De Palma...

John Travolta does give a skillful movie star type performance that showed America he wasn't limited to Vinnie Barbarino.....To be fair, the horrific events of 9/11 make pretty much all political assassination conspiracy films appear irrelevant ......

Two years later De Palma would redeem himself by directing ""Scarface"" indicating he was a lot better when working with other people's material

All that being said, Criterion has done its usual, masterful 'film buffs delight' in its repackaging.....The new video transfer is excellent and includes an hour long interview with De Palma and a 30 minute interview with Miss Allen,as well as a featurette about the novel use of the Steadycam for the film...",1355184000,,2120,4.9886685552407934

662783,4,6303471587,"One of Brian DePalma's best films, BLOW OUT, has arrived on Blu-Ray and DVD in a superb Criterion package. Mostly praised by critics though a box-office failure, ""Blow Out"" was one of the director's more fully-formed early features in terms of character development.

While DePalma's visual flourishes are still on full display throughout (use of split-screens, Steadicam, etc.), the movie isn't just a Hitchcock homage (nor a basic riff on Antonioni's similarly-titled ""Blow Up""), with the filmmaker's original script following a B-movie sound effects editor (John Travolta) who catches on tape an accident that claims the life of an aspiring presidential candidate. Travolta manages to save the life of a girl (Nancy Allen) who was in the car with him, but soon finds out the accident was an assassination attempt when he plays back his audio recording, audibly picking up a gun shot prior to the incident.

DePalma's scenario is equal parts JFK and Chappaquiddick, and Travolta's attempts to uncover the truth leads to endless pain and no way out; even his relationship with Allen, playing a simple-minded, easily influenced young woman, never becomes overtly romantic as he crusades to get to the bottom of the conspiracy, but is stopped by forces beyond his control, including a devious killer (John Lithgow) committing crimes just to lead the police away from his main goal.

There are contrivances in DePalma's screenplay to be certain - why Travolta's character would ever give the original film over to Allen without making a copy first, or why he lets Allen go down into the Philadelphia subway system alone, are gaping plot holes that enable DePalma to craft a number of exciting set-pieces (including a dynamite car chase through a Philly ""Liberty Day"" parade), yet ultimately detract from the film's dramatic power. There are also times when DePalma the writer gets sidetracked - the picture primarily serves as a commentary on politics, corruption and conspiracy in the post-Bicentennial era, yet goes off track to incorporate a spoof on modern slasher films, while the entire Lithgow subplot also doesn't feel entirely at home with the film's other aspects either.

Still, there's much to admire in the film, from Travolta's excellent performance (it's still one of his best), to the crackerjack editing and cinematography, with Vilmos Zsigmond providing DePalma with a neverending supply of beautifully composed widescreen images. Pino Donaggio's score is also one of his best efforts for a DePalma picture, while the entire movie has an authentic, atmospheric backdrop having been shot entirely on location in a city where the director spent a good deal of his youth. It's energetic and always entertaining, even if the screenplay is uneven and at times unbelievable.

Criterion's Blu-Ray package preserves Zsigmond's cinematography in a newly remastered AVC encoded 1080p transfer with 2.0 DTS MA stereo audio, reproducing the film's original 2-channel Dolby Stereo mix. Both are effective, while extras include an hour-long, informative interview of DePalma by filmmaker Noah Baumbach that was conducted last October; a half-hour conversation with Nancy Allen, who recalls working on the film, with DePalma (then her husband) and Travolta; a particularly interesting segment with Steadicam inventor Garrett Brown talking about his process and how it has evolved over the years; the original trailer; and DePalma's avant garde 1967 indie feature ""Murder a la Mod,"" presented in HD.

662784,5,6303471587,"If you are a big movie buff and know about other movies and directors Brian De Palma is influenced by, you may think this movie is a joke (based on reviews I've seen here and elsewhere).  I think some film buffs who aren't that critical will love it though and general audiences who just watch movies as something fun to do will love it too. A snippet of a B movie with unrealistic naked girls (perfectly B movie unrealistic girls) opens the movie, (my mother got this movie through a movie club and immediately turned it off and gave it to me), but then we see that the opening is just a set up to introduce us to the characters. Quickly we are led into a completely different type of movie which has a bit of everything, a tense underwater rescue, a political assasination, corrupt cops (in a flashback scene), a bit of romance (nicely done without any makeout or sex scenes), a bit of insight to the seedy underbelly of society, a psychotic killer, and a beginners how-to in filmaking as the real heart of the movie. Many reviews harp on mistakes, ""that character should have"" moments and the ending they don't like. But I believe most first time viewers will see past all that. You'll want to watch it again (and there are things many will not pick up on the first time), just don't get hung up on the what if's and how comes.",1330473600,,1330,4.384615384615385
662785,1,6303471587,"I had never seen this film until recently and had it recommended to me by a few people. I enjoyed ""The Conversation"" among other thrillers. The reviews of the Criterion rated high and felt I needed to see this. After viewing this film, it was a total disappointment to me. The story was extremely unbelievable. SPOILER ALERT!! First off the assassination attempt made no sense. Why would a Presidential hopeful and also Governor drive himself? Why would he pickup a hooker (in that manner) and why would he need to speed like that? Burke (Lithgow) the shooter just knew that a tire shot would ""make"" them wreck over a bridge and kill them. It doesn't make sense. Nancy Allen's character is the dumbest I've ever seen on film and made it really hard to watch. Maybe as a small role fine, but she is a major part of the plot and its terrible to watch. Also, what appeared to be a political thriller, the film changes pace and switches into a psychopathic story about Burke (lithgow) only. How much time would it take him to erase all those tapes in Jack's office, like a week? Next all of Burke's killings are shot like the campy horror film in the beginning. Was this intentional? I don't know or care, it just was bad. The final quarter got worse. Why wasn't Sally instructed to tell Jack over the wire what was happening at all? If Jack was such a sound man, wouldn't he also instantly know it wasn't the news man talking to Sally. Then Travolta goes on a tear in his Jeep almost killing police, fire, etc. Wouldn't he have been guarded and escorted by cops to the hospital after he crashed? Nope, just the convenient left alone in the back of the ambulance with the door open routine. The soundtrack was bad, the suspense was bad, the ending was ok, but just not a good film. I expected better from this one. Even the picture transfer from 81' didn't look clean. This movie is dated and isn't worthy of the Criterion treatment it received. Would not recommend.",1329523200,9,1962,4.49859943977591
662786,5,6303471587,"Just when you thought Brian De Palma was strictly a film director he dives head-first into TV comedy sitcoms, namely Blow Out. The pilot episode is funny enough to survive in Nebraska (tough crowd). With an all-star cast and some of the best written comedy episodes of the decade, Blow Out became an instant classic in TV land.

John Travolta stars as a B-Movie sound man that's obsessed with watching foreign cars get blow outs on the Avenue C bridge in Philadelphia. He immediately runs into John Lithgow (part-time mechanic) during the night and they both decide to make a new B-Movie. The movie is to be about a murder conspiracy involving a senator's foreign car's blow out on a Philadephia bridge. It then becomes a race against the clock to see who can solve the mystery first. Lithgow is slick, conning his way into ethnic parties and martini bars to get more clues about the murder. Travolta is smart, breaking into goverment offices and Gray's Papaya stands to get inside the mind of the killer. You'd better believe it, each episode is funnier than the last!

We still can't believe that Blow Out was cancelled in 1981 and that it didn't get a Golden Globe. Brian De Palma was really in his prime, and the fact that he got John Travolta to quit dancing for five minutes is simply remarkable.

662789,5,6303471587,"Blow Out was a pleasant surprise. After watching Carrie and Scarface, I really enjoyed De Palma's
style and blind buy this film. The reviews were positive and worth of mouth was enthusiastic. After
watching it, I have to say that Blow Out has become my favorite De Palma film (so far) and one of
the best thrillers ever made.

When a B-movie sound recorder is requested to record new sounds, he goes out and start
recording. While he is there, a car is going through a bridge and suddenly its tire explodes and the
car goes down to the river. The sound recorder goes to the river and rescues a girl. When they go
to the hospital, he discovers that she was with an important candidate to the presidency. He died
in the accident and the police advises him to forget the girl and forget about this whole thing.
When he is hearing the recordings he hears a gun and is convinced that this was no accident. He
contacts the girl and together they tried to uncover the mystery while avoiding a killer who is
behind all this complot.

Blow Out is a very well constructed film that elevates the tension in every scene. John Travolta and
Nancy Allen are great in the lead roles and John Lithgow is superb as the murderous conspirator.
The movie is also fascinating as it uses the mechanics of filmmaking to uncover the complot. Many
scenes are memorable especially the 4th of July scene which is amazingly well staged. The final
scene is unexpected and shocking at the same time, you'll never guess what happens. Blow Out is
a great movie that will maintain you at the edge of your seat all the time.

Video & Audio
Blow Out comes to BD courtesy of Criterion and the results are amazing. Detail is strong, contrast
is sharp and color reproduction is well done. I didn't notice any signs of print damage, aliasing,
edge enhacement or any other anomaly. Even better, a fine layer of grain has been maintained
and there are no signs of DNR. A spectacular transfer.

The 2.0 DTS-HD MA is also great with astounding clarity and no signs of hiss. Dialogue is always
clear as are the effects and the music.

Bonus Features
There is plenty of bonus material in this set that is sure to delight all fans:
The best one is an hour long interview with Brian De Palma by Noah Baumbach. It deals with the
production of Blow Out and De Palma shares some light about some decisions in certain scenes,
casting choices and more. It's a must see feature.
Then you have newly recorded interviews with cameraman and steady cam creator Garret Brown
and actress Nancy Allen. Both are very enlightening.
Then you have a still photographs gallery by Louis Goldman.
One of the best features is De Palma's experimental second film Murder a la Mod, it is presented in
full HD and deserves at least one viewing.
Last you have the original theatrical trailer.

A booklet is also included that features a new essay by critic Michael Sragow and the great original
interview by Pauline Kael.

Closing Thoughts
Blow Out was a very pleasant susprise and one of the best thrillers I've seen. It keeps you
interested and has a likeable cast that you care about. This Criterion BD set is amazing as well with
terrific picture and sound and lots of great bonus material. Highly Recommended for lovers of
suspense and good movies in general.",1318723200,6,3290,4.5755517826825125

1967 De Palma thriller that also takes place within the film-making world. Although it started off slow, the movie picked up and was really interesting to watch. It's in black & white and has shades of a snuff film. But what's riveting about this movie is the cinematography, presenting angles and reverse angles -- showing the point-of-view from one character as the scene plays out, and then showing the other point-of-view from a different character of the same scene. The storyline is really good, too, as it parallels a ""fake"" radio show that gets played out in the movie's reality.

662868,4,6303471587,"I had never seen BLOW OUT until just the other day.  I'm on a path (although a slow-going one) to try to watch the Criterion Blu-Rays.  I was attracted to this one on this particular night because I wasn't in the mood for a sub-titled brain teaser.  It sounded like it would be more conventional (it's directed by Brian DePalma, after all).  And it was in many ways a very conventional thriller.  But it had enough fun moments to elevate it, and I understood why Criterion felt it was worthwhile to dust off this 1981 nugget.

The core of the plot involves a movie sound effects recordist and editor (John Travolta) who inadvertently picks up the sounds of what he thinks is a car accident that may actually be a political assassination.  A car plunges into a lake, and Travolta is able to save a passenger (Karen Allen), who may be just a ""dumb blonde"" (pardon the clich&eacute;, but it seems apt) or a far more involved member of a rather insidious conspiracy.  The two develop a fairly complicated and interesting relationship that is the emotional heart of the story...while at the same time, some pretty nifty plot twists develop.  Travolta also grows more and more paranoid about the investigation he feels compelled to conduct (when the forces around him tell him to drop it).  He's not some obsessive weirdo...he's a fairly normal guy who thinks he's made a great and useful discovery and his shocked to find that there are powerful forces that really would rather he just drop the whole thing.  He can't believe his life is turning into a movie.

This is all well-done but still fairly conventional.  But De Palma has spiced it up.  Perhaps the most fun of all is to be had right at the beginning.  We have an extended scene from the latest cheapie slasher flick that Travolta is working on.  It's well shot with a very long single-take tracking shot from the point of view of the villain, as he peeks in through various windows in a girls' dormitory.  We see all the sex, drugs and rock `n' roll going on.  It's hilarious but when it abruptly ends, we're left feeling a bit complicit in being in a society for which topless girls being slashed to death works as casual entertainment.  The movie could certainly have been made without this scene...but the entertainment value would have been very much diminished AND the ironic twist of the very last scene of the movie would not have worked.  Also, throughout the film, De Palma and cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond have a simple fantastic time.  They play around with framing, with deep focus, with lighting and so on.  De Palma plays more technical games than he ought to be able to get away with, but rather than just seeming needlessly showy, they  enhance Travolta's growing feelings of paranoia.  (In fact, there are a couple of times when the film feels like a knock-off of THE CONVERSATION...but Travolta's character doesn't go quite so completely off the deep end.)

Travolta gives an excellent performance, one of the best from his early career.  He's smart, funny, a little charming and yet a little goofy.  He keeps the performance mostly well-rooted in reality.  A very young John Lithgow is in a critical villain's role...and here he' s setting the stage effectively for later turns in movies such as CLIFFHANGER.  Nancy Allen is the weak link.  A mediocre actor at the best of times, she doesn't quite make this character believable.  When she's playing ""ditzy"" there is no subtlety at all.  Her voice strays dangerously close to Betty Boop territory.

The climatic scenes are less exciting today than they doubtless were in 1981.  We've seen so many thrillers that a scene involving a simple chase on foot through a crowd hardly measures up to Jason Bourne's exploits.  But they are nonetheless directed and edited with skill and care.

The Blu-Ray itself is the usual excellent quality from Criterion.  Many of the scenes are dark and murky...Blu Ray doesn't exist to ""clean up"" or ""brighten"" stuff like that, so even in Hi-Def you may struggle with a few scenes.  It's perfectly fine and in accordance with De Palma's plans.  The extras on the disc are very nice as well, including a recently done, lengthy interview with De Palma.  That is very much worth watching, particularly right after the film is concluded so that the scenes referenced are fresh in your mind.  Other extras include a very early De Palma film called MURDER A LA MODE from 1968.  It's a dreadful film, but may provide brief amusement.  I couldn't get through it, but I appreciated it being here...because there are parallels in themes with BLOW OUT, and you can see how De Palma grew as a storyteller...learning to balance ""artsiness"" with the need to tell a coherent story.

All-in-all, this was time well spent with a solid, inventive thriller.",1314921600,,4796,4.754237288135593

662870,4,6303471587,"I haven't seen this flick in a while, and, being the conspiracy whore that I am, I figured I should re-visit it. I'm glad I did. It held up better than I expected.

John Travolta is a movie sound man out one night building his library with night time sounds. A car comes down the road and, while crossing the bridge, has a blow out. It crashes off the bridge and into the river. Travolta dives in and is able to save the young lady (Nancy Allen) but the male passenger dies from crash related injuries. As it turns out he was a candidate for President. Now Travolta is wondering if what he heard and recorded was the tire blowing out or a gunshot shooting out the tire and things take off.

This was released in 1981 where the similar ""Parallax View"" was released in 1974, but it's easy to see both movies are haunted by the nagging questions surrounding the assassination of JFK. The suspicions continued to climb in the minds of the American public and both of these films do much to fuel those suspicions.

This was one of DePalma's earlier efforts so it has a certain raw power going for it. Not unlike ""Sisters"" and ""Body Double."" The performances are decent. Travolta does a good job but Nancy Allen and Dennis Franz are a bit ""too."" They are almost more caricature than flesh and blood. I also found Lithgow's character to be a bit off. Why would a hired gun supersede the orders of those paying him? The production values are pretty good. The sound mixing is a bit off in parts but that's a small quibble. Be that as it may, this is still a decent movie. It might not have everything it had upon its initial release but it's held up pretty well over the years.",1308009600,,1668,4.356913183279743

Good cast and a really interesting premise hooked me in. Comparisons to 'The Conversation' and 'All The President's Men' added to my interest.

So, I purchased the Blu Ray. Well, I'm sorry to say I hated it!

The script and acting are generally awful. John Lithgow is the best thing on screen. I often like old seventies and early eighties movies for their 'look' but I was even left disappointed from that point of view. I found the score to be lacklustre, but at least for an early 80's pic it didn't enter into poxy synth territory.

Finally I was underwhelmed with the Blu Ray transfer. The scenes in the mob car look terrible and bear no match to other dark/black/night scenes in the movie - what's the story with that?

If it's true or not, i like to believe it. This film is one of those rare moments of brilliance in cinema. Forgive the somewhat pretentious nature of my review , but i love this film. I agree that it is similar to a Hitchcock film, as De Palma is often known for, but without some of the same examples like the the annoying cameo. This film is a great thriller. Even though Nancy Allen does sort of do the ditsy blonde role that we've all seen before, there's more of an approachable and welcome innocence about her. You're truly heartbroken when Lithgow's character attacks her.
Technically, this film is beautifully shot and who cares if you're overtly aware of it. It's a visual medium and camera movement is a very large aspect of it. Obviously, this film is about sound and even though i'm quite surprised and maybe even a little disappointed that there is no 5.1 mix, it sounds amazing. I bought this years ago on laserdisc and that transfer was atrocious. I rented the dvd and it was just as dismal, so this Criterion Collection version is what I unknowingly have wanted for years. More ""lost classics"" like this should get the treatment they deserve.

While out gathering sound effects he witnesses a car crashing through a bridge fence and into a river or stream. He rescues a young woman who he later learns is a hooker trying to set up a potential governor. He figures out through his recordings that the tire was actually shot out and that this was no accident. The candidate dies in the crash and everyone wants to hush up the angle with the prostitute. DePalma does an excellent job with plenty of thrills and chills and some interesting camera work. There are more than a few inconsistencies in the story and shot sequences but the film is still a favorite.

John Lithgow shows early on his ability to play any character to a frighteningly convincing tee.

Many of the shots of this movie evoke De Palma's distinct style.  One in particular is the rotating shot of Travolta in the sound room building a Terry Reilly style loop of ambient tape noise. The only thing I wish Criterion had done was to re-master the original audio to a 5.1 mix.  The sound work of this movie is one of its most striking features, and with such a quality blu-ray image there should be the audio to match.",1306281600,,742,4.6692307692307695

There were several plot 'gaffs' that were never explained and some of the performances were wooden.

662928,5,6303471587,"Just like in 1980, when Brian De Palma, Master Of The Macabre, invited you to see the latest showing in fashion...in murder with ""Dressed To Kill"", in 1981 he invited you to listen to the sound of murder, conspiracy, paranoia, mistaken identity, a psychotic serial killer, and political corruption...in ""Blow Out"", written & directed by De Palma, and produced by George Litto.

Starting the film out with a B-grade slasher flick, brilliantly satirizing the heavily trafficked god-awful sleazy marketing of a school bus full of gonzo slasher films, De Palma establishes from the outset that all is not as it appears to be (plus, he shows just how easy he could just as well do a cheap-a** slasher flick if he so chose, but would rather expose them for the low-brow form of film that they are).

De Palma makes great use of MANY of his brilliant techniques in this, ranging from split screen, split dioptor, to spinning and whirling, crane tracking shots, to slow motion, making everything work to his advantage.

The story is quite a mix of ""Blow Up"" (but, where in ""Blow Up"", Antonioni's themes were how things lost meaning and/or relevance once out of context, De Palma shows just how important each and every little piece of a puzzle is important, whether in/out of context or not), ""The Conversation"" (where as Coppolla had a character 'think' he heard the sound of a murder, De Palma lets you know his character DID hear the sound of a murder), ""Vertigo"" (the hero has an incident from the past that is 'crippling' to him now, plus the whole 'saving the lady' theme), and the real life Chappaquiddick Incident (but, here we are shown that it WAS a cover up!). Showing (and exposing) just how corrupt and manipulating the film industry, the media, and politics are, this film will leave you utterly breathless, and cold, and in utter bewilderment to see how a Human life can be condensed to nothing more than a mere scream in a low budget horror film.

De Palma discovered/rediscovered a LOT of talent during his tenure as director, and is continuing to do so. The list reads like a novel of who's who. He's been a diving board for a LOT of careers!

Ironically, De Palma started Travolta's film career with ""Carrie"", and 'killed' his career with this film, which features his best performance ever.

As for Nancy Allen's character, Sally, I'll admit that I didn't 'get' her, and/or really enjoy her in this until just a few years ago; and when I did, I have loved her performance ever since, maybe over anything else she's ever done. She's supposed to come across a bit ditzy and 'disconnected' on the surface, but underneath, she is highly intelligent, has a heart of gold, and is tough as nails when push comes to shove; and is a very 'inconvenient woman', as in she is in the way and needs to be 'erased'.

As a fan of Nancy Allen's, I recommend people check out all 4 De Palma films she's in (""Carrie"", ""Home Movies"", ""Dressed To Kill"", ""Blow Out""), as well as ""Strange Invaders"", ""Poltergeist III"", and all 3 ""Robocop"" films. I LOVE Nancy, in my opinion, the TRUE 'scream queen' of horror!

Don't compare De Palma with other De Palma, but with the film(s) that get released at the same period as his, and/or competing with his. I say that because I love every film the man has made, each one in a different unique way, for, in my opinion, I have yet to see one that just didn't floor me, and/or impress the h*ll out of me. This is considered by many to be De Palma's finest hour. Fortunately, a lot of important people have discovered this masterpiece over the years, but it is a shame that it didn't get the right amount of acclaim upon its initial release.

And as for the Criterion release: The transfer is magnificent! And the bonus interviews are definitely worthwhile viewing, and the inclusion of De Palma's early film ""Murder A La Mod"" (even though I already have that on a separate DVD) makes this a MUST HAVE for that film alone!
HIGHLY recommended!! Thank you! ;-)",1304812800,,3984,4.623762376237623

Jack Terry (Travolta) is a sound-effects man who works on B-movies for a Philadelphia-based studio. One night, he decides to go out to record some new effects. He captures the sound of leaves rustling in the wind, a frog croaking, an owl hooting and a couple's conversation. They mention that someone is watching them from a nearby bridge.

Jack inadvertently records a car accident and a gunshot heard before it veers off the road into a creek. He runs over and leaps into the water, pulling a woman from the car, but too late to save the man she is with. The woman, Sally (Allen), survives the accident with no apparent injuries. The dead man turns out to be Governor McRyan, a potential presidential candidate.

The police write the crash off as an accident, but Jack knows what he heard and reconstructs the scene in his mind by listening to his recording. We find out that someone caught the crash on film and sold it to various publications. Jack matches the images to the sounds and is certain the crash was caused by a bullet hitting a tire. None of the authorities seem interested so he seeks Sally's help to prove his theory.

De Palma builds suspense throughout and a plot to discredit the Governor is gradually revealed. Sally was working for Manny (Franz), a private eye, and they have a history of using her to ruin people's public images with the help of a henchman known as Burke (Lithgow). Burke has an agenda of his own and exceeds his authority.

Nobody wants to admit that McRyan had a woman in the car and a full cover-up is set in motion. Burke is out to tie up any loose ends and silence the potential threat from Jack and Sally.

De Palma brings to mind Michelangelo Antonioni's Blow Up as well as a number of Alfred Hitchcock's movies. He confirms in the special features that the film was inspired by the JFK shooting and subsequent events.

The resulting mix is an intriguing mystery, filled with suspense and a little action. Will Jack be able to prove his theory and make it public, or will it be buried? The final shot is a memorable one and the film doesn't have a traditional Hollywood ending. It works for me.

Video Quality 4/5
It's difficult to grade Criterion's newly-restored presentation because the quality varies. In brightly-lit scenes, detail is exceptional considering the age of the film. Some of the scenes are dark and filled with heavy grain. I didn't notice any dirt or debris, but did see vertical lines on the screen a couple of times. Overall, I was pleased. Criterion does everything possible with its transfers and didn't let me down here.

Sound Quality 5/5
Sound understandably plays an important part in the film and the DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 track delivers. Some scenes are made up of a multitude of different sounds, presumably to draw our attention to what we are hearing. It's particularly evident when Jack is recording his sound-effects tape and captures the car's crash. Dialogue is clear throughout and it's hard to imagine a better quality track than this one.

Criterion's recent release does justice to an important film and is thoroughly worth the upgrade to Blu-ray. You're actually getting two De Palma films in this package and Blow Out is one of Travolta's best films. I wonder how influential his performance here was in convincing Quentin Tarantino (a huge De Palma fan) to cast him in Pulp Fiction?

662931,5,6303471587,"I love, love, LOVE this movie.  It's an example of perfect filmmaking on every level from creative to technical.  This is the first Brian DePalma film where the director put more of his personality inside his technique, and it's the best he's ever done it as well.

This blu ray is insane with greatness.  Firstly, the transfer is pristine.  This probably looks and sounds better than it ever did when this film came out back in the 80's.  More importanly, the special features are just what the doctor ordered.  First, and best of all, we get an hour long interview with director Brian DePalma by current filmmaker Noah Baumbach(The Squid and the Whal-if you haven't seen this or his other films, see them IMMEDIATELY).  DePalma not only goes into the making of this film but his views on filmmaking in general.  ""I don't know what the hell a two shot or coverage is"", DePalma says as he is referring to his shots and angles.  Further establishing what so many modern director's don't do, they just cover a scene from every angle and cobble it all together.  Like all of DePalma's films, especially this one, he chooses shots to tell the story, and they have to work because there's no other way to tell the story.  There's also a great anecdote regarding how reels of film were stolen and never found.  They were the scenes from the big parade chase scene, that had to be reshot.  It's great and very informative and if any of you out there are aspiring filmmakers this interview is a must.  We also get a cool interview with Nancy Allen and the cinematographer.  There's also a booklet reflecting on the film that also includes an old Pauline Kael review of the film.

Anyone who loves or likes films should at least have seen this film, but should definitely own it, and only this restored blu ray edition.  Travolta made is evolution to adulthood with this film.  This was the first 'grown up' character he played in his early career.  Unfortunately this was the last good film he made until the brilliant Pulp Fiction(on a side note Tarantino is a huge DePalma fan).  He is really good complex, and very believable as a man obsessed with solving a mystery.  Nancy Allen(Carrie, Dressed to Kill, Robocop trilogy), one of the screen's truly talented and underappreciated screen beauties shines as well.  I think this is her best performance as well. She manages the impossible by playing a ditzy hooker who never comes off obnoxious or too stupid to sympathize with.  Hers and Travolta's virgining romance is truly sweet and very effective.  John Lithgow shows up too playing one of his early psychopath roles, long before Raising Caine, Cliffhanger and now the immortal season 4 villain of Dexter.  The characters drive the plot foward, and the plot is dense.  It's a mix of Blow Up and The Conversation with some new twists thrown in for good measure.  It's political, mysterious, scary, horrific and blackly funny all in one master storke.  The culmination of all of DePalma's earlier efforts shoved into one film and totally effective.

This is my favorite DePalma film.  I am so happy Criterion picked this one up, and if you own the crappy MGM bare bones edition, then you know what I mean.  I would've settled for a great transfer of the film, but getting these new and truly great special features is just icing.  Everyone should see this, and help make up for its ignored and slightly forgotten status that it received on its initial release.",1304121600,,3455,4.705
662932,5,6303471587,"Political thrillers have had uneven success at the box office, but one of the best is Brian De Palma's 1981 drama, ""Blow Out."" De Palma spent a number of years making Hitchcock homage films -- ""Sisters,"" ""Obsession,"" ""Dressed to Kill.""  ""Blow Out"" is inspired by Antonioni's ""Blow Up"" and Coppola's ""The Conversation,"" but has an identity all its own and reflects more of De Palma than his Hitchcock imitations.

""Blow Out"" stars John Travolta, three years after his mega-box office success in ""Grease."" No two films could be further apart in mood, character development, and overall style.  Jack Terri (Travolta) is a sound technician who works on soft-core porn movies.  He becomes intrigued and later obsessed by what seems to be a conspiracy to cover up the murder of a politician in a car crash he accidentally witnesses and records.  He falls in love with the young woman, Sally Bedina (Nancy Allen), who was in the car with the politician when he was killed.

""Blow Out"" builds interestingly as Jack becomes increasingly convinced that he's onto a crime that the authorities have overlooked.  De Palma loves showing off the mechanics of filmmaking and sound recording, and there are many lengthy, dialogue-less scenes that portray the machinery and technology employed by Jack in attempting to demystify what he thinks he's witnessed.

The success of ""Blow Out"" is De Palma's ability to present it as an escalating real-life nightmare, as Jack refuses to abandon his suspicions and uses his technical talent to devolve a mystery.  Also resonating in the movie is the Chappaquidick incident and the three major political assassinations of the 1960's.

Travolta is very good as Jack, who is the only decent character in the movie.  In fact, it is one of his best on-screen performances.  He's asked to be solidly dramatic and portray many of his feelings with expression and reaction shots.  He was seldom asked to play this kind of heavy-duty role again until ""Pulp Fiction.""

The restored digital transfer looks pristine in Blu-ray.  Bonus extras include a new hour-long interview with De Palma, a new interview with Nancy Allen, Garrett Brown discussing the then-new Steadicam shots featured in the film-within-the-film, on-set photos, and a booklet featuring a critical essay.",1303948800,2,2285,5.104838709677419

In a real treat for De Palma fans, his 1967 experimental film Murder a la Mod is included in its entirety. Like Blow Out, the film is a thriller that takes place in the filmmaker world. It is fascinating to see the director's emerging style still in its infancy and how the film is very much of its time.

662934,5,6303471587,"Brian DePalma--you either love him or hate him it seems with one group always attacking him for ""borrowing"" from other directors and still others praising him for vividly echoing others work while creating something memorable of his own. I come here not to ""blow out"" DePalma but to praise him. ""Blow Out"" was one of the first films to use the Steadicam extensively for long tracking shots and DePalma used the device wisely throughout the film.

With ""Blow Out"" DePalma managed to elicit one of John Travolta's finest performances of his career reaching beneath the surface performance that Travolta often presents to get a sense of genuine emotion. A skewed paranoid thriller that uses the classic film ""Blow Up"" as its touch point, ""Blow Out"" focuses on a sound engineer named Jack (Travolta) who believes he recorded evidence of murder. Jack is determined to find out the truth but puts himself and Sally (Nancy Allen)a woman passenger in the car who survived and directly in the path of an assassin (John Lithgow).

The Criterion Blu-ray personally supervised by director DePalma is a huge improvement over the previous regular DVD edition. Fine detail is a huge improvement while clarity and contrast look much improved throughout. The film also went an extensive restoration and clean up which is most notable in the lack of scratches that were evident in the previous DVD presentation. This is a film that will never look perfect (some of the shots are extremely grainy but that's due to the film stock and the lighting choices for the film--it's a typical early 80's film but it looks the best it has ever looked here).

Audio sounds quite strong but keep in mind that this is presented in its original 2.0 NOT in a remixed or repurposed 5.1 mix. We get optional English subtitles. Dialogue and the marvelous music score by Pino Donaggio sound exceptionally crisp and clear.

Criterion rolls out some nice extras for this edition as well. We get DePalma's 1967 feature film ""Murder a la Mode"" which provided part of the inspiration for ""Blow Out"". Viewers should keep in mind that DePalma's film is experimental in technique at times and some of the visual choices, motifs, etc. that show up in ""Blow Out"" were first put on display in DePalma's earlier film.

We get an interview with Garrett Brown who created the Steadicam (and a demonstration for those who don't know how or what it is used for).

We also get an interview with DePalma conducted by director Noah Baumbach which is enlightening allowing DePalma to discuss the thought process behind shooting the film the way he did.

Nancy Allen appears in a new interview as well discussing her first impressions of Travolta (with whom she had worked on ""Carrie""), her preparation for the role, etc.

Finally we get the original theatrical trailer (my how times have changed when it comes to theatrical trailers, (theatrical trailers should play like a mysterious seduction NOT quickie in the backseat of a car which is how most are presented today), production stills and, of course, a booklet with an essay by critic Michael Sragow as well as Pauline Kael's original interview with DePalma from the New Yorker.

DePalma often borrowed from other directors--so did Hitchcock, Welles, Ford, Spielberg and Scorsese. Like all of these directors DePalma sometimes managed to make what he borrowed into something uniquely his own while other times you could see the inspiration peaking out from under the covers almost like a child playing peek-a-boo. Regardless of whether DePalma was always successful at disguising his influences or hiding them, at his best, DePalma made intelligent, interesting and sometimes thought provoking thrillers.

Highly recommended.",1303171200,29,3722,5.017828200972447
662935,5,6303471587,"Brian De Palma may have hit a career slump in recent years but his 1981 film Blow Out, released on the heels of his equally impressive Dressed to Kill, shows a writer/director at the top of his form and it is here that he crafted one of his finest films and one of the finest suspense thrillers of the 1980s. Basically a collage of several movies, the mechanics of moviemaking itself, and various political conspiracies; Blow Out is an entertaining, artistic, and masterfully made film that shows why the name De Palma once meant something and why a young John Travolta was once a true movie star.

Jack Terry (Travolta) is a sound technician for low-budget horror films in Philadelphia. One night while out recording sounds, he witnesses and records a car accident before saving a young woman (Nancy Allen) from the drowning car. At the hospital, Jack is told that the driver of the car was a presidential hopeful and the woman, Sally, a prostitute...Jack is told to not talk to the press about the girl or anything else out of respect for the man's family. Jack agrees, but going over what he's recorded he hears what he believes shows that the wreck was no accident at all. Reconstructing the accident from pictures taken by another person at the scene and the sound he recorded, Jack begins to uncover something far more mysterious than what he first thought.

Co-starring Dennis Franz and the appropriately creepy John Lithgow, Blow Out begins as a mystery but slowly morphs into a suspense film. De Palma's script is imperfect, but very well-written and certainly derives inspiration from Antonioni's Blow-Up but it's the style with which he directs his script that has made Blow Out a film that is still talked about 30 years after its release. During this timeframe, De Palma was a master at framing his shots and his unique framing is responsible for some of the movie's most memorable moments. His style with this and Dressed to Kill are reminiscent of Hitchcock, whom he drew a significant amount of inspiration from but he displays a style in the two films that is all his own. Look at the final moments of the film with the fireworks, which is absolutely terrific. It's a beautiful scene; well-shot, well-scored, well-acted, and well-executed showing a director with complete control over his craft.

Aside from De Palma's contribution, John Travolta really shines in this movie as the charming sound technician dedicated to finding the truth about the accident. He brings his boyish good looks and natural charisma, as well as subtlety and a certain restlessness to his role that shows why he was a true movie star at the time. Lithgow made a name for himself playing creepy roles, but he's particularly effective here. His exterior normality is perfect for portraying characters with dark inner secrets.

Blow Out is a masterpiece of style and form, with a wickedly good story. It may be the product of a collage of influences, but it functions remarkably well on its own artistic merit. It's deserving of the Criterion treatment and I'm sure they'll do a terrific job on the final product. It's a terrific suspense thriller that made me stop and marvel; they don't really make films like this anymore.

663004,5,6303471587,BLOW OUT is the last of the great nutty paranoid consiparacy thrillers. People have said De Palma rips off films like BLOW UP and THE CONVERSATION. These films are similar but De Palma's visual treatment of the material make it a completely different experience to those two masterpieces. De Palma has taken the Ted Kennedy Chappaquidick incident and turned it into a sinister right-wing conspiracy. In most De Palma films the protaganist thinks he's going to solve the crime only to get innocent people killed. Travolta's obsession in busting the conspiracy only gets an naive innocent prostitute murdered. De Palma's 360 degree use of the circling camera creates a paranoid conspiracy feel that proves disturbing. With these high-level government plots the civilian is out of their element. De Palma is an economical filmmaker and the final few shots create such a moving disturbing quality as Travolta's character finds the perfect scream for his horror/slasher film that it will be forever etched in my memory. This and THE FURY are the two great De Palma films. HARRY GEORGATOS,1278892800,2,1082,5.11864406779661
663005,4,6303471587,"This is another DePalma film that teeters between homage or rip-off.  In this case DePalma seems to be riffing on Antonioni's ""Blow-Up"".  For a good three-quarters of the film it is a fairly mesmerizing political thriller.  In the end, though, it kind of breaks down with an overlong chase sequence through the streets of my beloved Philly.  There's alot to recommend here, though, notably John Travolta's performance as a Z-Movie sound man turned dogged detective and a creepy one by John Lithgow.  I was about to enter college in the Summer of '81 and I have to say that DePalma perfectly captures the ambience of my hometown with the good, the bad, and the seedy.  The irony may be lost on out-of-towners in that Travolta's office is located in an adult book store a stone's throw away from City Hall.  Trivia note.  Michael Tearson, whose name inexplicably appears in the end credits because of the blink you missed it nature of his role, was a rock DJ with extremely good taste when the jocks could spin their own platters without some focus group telling them what to play.",1272758400,,1079,4.702127659574468

Blow Out is a fine thriller-ized take on Antonioni's Blow Up, with an appealing John Travolta in the lead and sufficiently creepy villains trying to prevent him from exposing the truth about a supposed car crash; Nancy Allen does hurt the movie with her awful performance (that showcases none of the winning qualities she displays in Dressed to Kill) but it's still one of DePalma's better films.

663012,5,6303471587,"Just like in 1980, when Brian DePalma, Master Of The Macabre, invited you to see the latest showing in fashion...in murder, in 1981 he invited you to listen to the sound of murder, conspiracy, paranoia, mistaken identity, a psychotic serial killer, and political corruption...in ""Blow Out"", written & directed by DePalma, and produced by George Litto.
Starting the film out with a B-grade slasher flick, brilliantly satirizing the heavily trafficked godawful sleazy marketing of a schoolbus full of gonzo slasher films, DePalma establishes from the outset that all is not as it appears to be (plus, he shows just how easy he could just as well do a cheap-a** slasher flick if he so chose, but would rather expose them for the low-brow form of film that they are). We soon learn that the slasher flick is a film that main character Jack Terri (John Travolta) is working as a sound man on; and, this is just one in a thousand B-rate horror films he has done for this company. A problem arises: The girl in the film has a terrible scream! It is like nails on a chalk board.
So, Jack has a new mission, and that is to find a good 'screamer' for the audio track of the film, plus some more background sounds as well, something fresh, something not used a thousand times already. So, late at night, Jack goes to a nearby park to record some fresh nature sounds for the film. Out of the blue, he hears a loud BANG with hints of an echo, then a car appears onscreen, careening off a bridge, and Jack is quick to dive into the murky water(s) to try and be of help. He see's that the driver (who we later find out was Governor McReiley, who was possibly gonna be the next President of the USA) is dead, but there is a woman inside, screaming for help. He rescues her, then at the hospital, is asked by high goverment officials to 'forget' that she was even there. And, to 'forget' that the whole 'incident' even took place. He is puzzled, but goes to Sally's (the girl that was in the car) room, and gets to know her, and invites her to have dinner with him.
As the film progresses, Jack and Sally (Nancy Allen) get to know each other better, Jack works on the tape he recorded of the accident, converting it to visual film that he pieced together from pictures of the accident from a tabloid newspaper, taken by a guy named Manny Carp (Dennis Franz). Well, it just so happens that Manny and Sally know each other, and Jack wants Sally to get the original film from Manny.
Meanwhile, there is a terrorfying madman, Burke (John Lithgow) on the loose, trying to cover up any and/or all loose ends to the 'conspiracy', and the last one involves doing away with Sally. He, by accident, then on purpose, becomes ""The Liberty Bell Killer"", killing women and carving a sign of the Liberty Bell into their stomach/groin area with an ice pick, so that way Sally's 'death' will look like a random of killings by the same serial killer.
Jack turns his tapes into the police (which he has a very painful memory with, for he used to be a soundman for them, and a guy he wired was exposed and killed, and Jack blamed himself), but later finds out the tapes are erased, making Jack sound like a conspiracy nut. All of his tapes in his office are erased as well. A 'Phil Donahue' type reporter named Donahue (Curt May) wants to meet with Jack and see his film mixed with the sound he recorded. Jack is hestitant. He decides to 'wire' Sally, and she goes to meet with Donahue, and Jack trails behind.
And, this is where I'll stop as far as plot goes, for I would never want to give away the ending to this for anything!
DePalma makes great use of MANY of his brilliant techniques in this, ranging from split screen, split dioptor, to spinning and whirling, crane tracking shots, to slow motion, making everything work to his advantage.
The story is quite a mix of ""Blow Up"" (but, where in ""Blow Up"", Antonioni's themes were how things lost meaning and/or relevance once out of context, DePalma shows just how important each and every little piece of a puzzle is important, whether in/out of context or not), ""The Conversation"" (where as Coppolla had a character 'think' he heard the sound of a murder, DePalma lets you know his character DID hear the sound of a murder), ""Vertigo"" (the hero has an incident from the past that is 'crippling' to him now, plus the whole 'saving the lady' theme), and the real life Chappaquiddick Incident (but, here we are shown that it WAS a cover up!). Showing (and exposing) just how corrupt and manipulating the film industry, the media, and politics are, this film will leave you utterly breathless, and cold, and in utter bewilderment to see how a Human life can be condensed to nothing more than a mere scream in a low budget horror film.

Yes, of course, De Palma pays homage to both, ""Blow Up"" and ""Conversation"" but ""Blow Out"" is a vintage DePalma at his best, in his glory and brilliance. The story is great, packed with twists and turns and also lets us peek once again as in Body Double"" at the B-movies making process. John Travolta is Jack Terri, a sound technician who rescues a girl (Nancy Allen) from a car that crashes into a river after a blow out. The man who drove the car did not survive and he happened to be the next presidential candidate. Jack soon realizes that it was not just a blow out but a murder, and he's got an evidence to prove it, the tape that he made on the bridge while recording the background noises for the movie. As good as the story is, it does not forget its characters, and they are memorable and multi-dimensional. The actors are terrific. It was the time when John Travolta was both cute without being smug and compelling. Nancy Allen as Sally, was sweet and heartbreaking, Dennis Franz's character, Manny Karp, the petty blackmailer who got more than he bargained for was fun to watch, and John Lithgow made such a chilling villain that Anthony Hopkins could've learned something from him. I did not even start on Vilmos Zsigmond's camera work. Only one word comes to mind - mesmerizing. The final chase sequence on the streets of Philadelphia during the celebration of the ringing of the Liberty Bell is as well staged and shut and as exiting as the similar climatic chase on Mount Rushmore in Hitchcock's ""North By Northwest"". The movie is perfectly balanced by the last scene and the hilarious opening scene mirroring each other but this time the scream is different. It IS a good scream that came from the streets of Philadelphia.

663048,5,6303471587,"Blow Out, 1981 film

The film shows sound technician Jack Terry while his TV is showing political news about Governor McRyan at the Bellevue-Stratford hotel in Philadelphia (site of the 1976 American Legion convention). McRyan is the likely candidate for President. This sound man goes out at night to collect sounds for special effects. A shotgun mike, which is highly directional, can pick up distant sounds. When he hears tires squeal he picks up that sound. There is a sharp noise, and the car crashes. He dives into the water to rescue the woman in the back seat. At the hospital his objective testimony is questioned. The driver in the car was the late Governor McRyan! Lawrence Henry tells Terry to forget about it. The truth about the girl must be suppressed in the national interest. [Does this remind you of a Massachusetts Senator or a New York Governor?]

We see someone break into a garage and remove the tire with a bullet hole to replace it with another tire. Sally is a make-up girl at Korvettes. A local photographer happened to be filming at night and recorded the car crash. Frames are printed in a magazine (like the Zapruder film). Terry re-photographs the frames to create a movie film from the stills. Meeting with Sally, Terry tells about his past work with a commission investigating corruption. Something went wrong. Sally was paid to go away for a few months. There is a shocking event where a woman is attacked and killed on the street. Sally visits Manny Karp at a cheap hotel, we learn more about Manny. Back at the sound laboratory Terry is working on the audio tape to synchronize the sound to the film. There was a flash behind a fence that connects to the sharp noise. [Does this remind you of the 1977 Select Commission to Investigate Assassinations?]

When Jack Terry visits his police friend his story is considered a conspiracy theory. But they will investigate. A telephone conversation reveals the hidden hands used to remove McRyan from politics. Back at his sound laboratory Terry finds his tapes have all been erased! (But this is no conspiracy.) Reporter Frank Donohue visits Terry to get information about his tape of the car crash. Later Terry learns that Sally worked to set up men for blackmail in divorce cases. Sally visits Manny and learns more about the deal. Terrys phone is wiretapped, and the secret operative Burke asks Sally to meet Frank Donohue and hand over the film and tape. [Why didn't they go to Donohues office?] Terry wires Sally to record her conversation. [We see the spacious railroad stations in Philadelphia, so much better than the Penn Central station in NY.]

Terry realizes something is wrong, and tries to follow Sally. But they take a train to someplace. He drives through City Hall in pursuit of Sally, but crashes his car. Sally seems incredibly naive and trusting given her experiences. The fireworks distract people and the noise covers up screams. Terry sees the two and runs to stop Burke [a scene that reminded me of Hitchcocks Psycho]. Burke is stopped, but Sally expired. There are no witnesses. Sallys dying scream is used for dubbing a cheap porno/slasher movie. [There are problems with this story. What need is there for Burke to silence witnesses whose story cant be corroborated?] Nancy Allen and Dennis Franz did an excellent job portraying their characters. John Lithgow plays the creepy political operative. John Travolta plays a sound man whose most important work is in his past.

663049,3,6303471587,"The dense, complicated plot of Blow Out is hard to simplify.  Basically, Jack Terry (Travolta) is a sound man for a seedy film company in Philadelphia.  One night, while out in nature taping for effects, Jack witnesses the car crash of a vehicle carrying the man who was probably going to be the next President of the USA.  The vehicle was also carrying Sally (Nancy Allen in a well-acted but annoying role) whom Jack saves by diving into the river and pulling out of the car.  When listening back to his recording of the events, Jack realizes that this was no accident, and he sets out to unravel the conspiracy surrounding the blow out.

The movie never really takes off until Burke (John Lithgow) enters the picture.  Burke is an evil, brutal hit man, who is willing to stop at nothing to eliminate all witnesses.  Lithgow is great, but he just isn't in the film enough to pull it all off the ground.  While the movie does have some great De Palma moments (the final chase scene, the train station sequence, the examination of the video/audio tapes) it unfortuately just never captured my attention the way most De Palmas do.  I was never on edge, and I never found myself truly caring about the outcome.  I think that the plot of Blow Out is one of De Palma's best written screenplays, but it just didn't have enough ""De Palma moments"" to  make me say I loved the film.

It becomes obvious that the governor was being set up for blackmail, and now those involved want it covered up by getting rid of the witnesses.

The acting is superb and De Palma really builds up the tension to a riveting climax (which, after the fact, feels like a letdown because Travolta is able to get the man behind the conspiracy (John Lithgow - who is actually a CIA agent and the perfect foil for De Palma's obsession with conspiracy theories [echoes of Chappaquiddick and Dallas]), but the truth may never be revealed because evidence has been destroyed - and Allen is killed at the end. Filmed in Philadelphia, De Palma has a great feel for the city. Everything (mostly) works here; the movie is of a whole.

With the exception of John Travoltas character nobody else stuck out as being interesting at all. A few things that might have helped. A decent soundtrack. The music was terrible and did not make you feel the least bit of tension. It sounded almost out of place within the movie.

663054,4,6303471587,"Brian DePalma's Blow Out is a taut thriller that would make Hitchcock proud. The Master of Suspense loved to put his characters in situations where they had to sit by helplessly while events occur beyond their control - the best example of this is Rear Window - and DePalma uses that technique to great effect in the finale of Blow Out.

John Travolta plays Jack, a Philadelphia movie sound man who witnesses a car accident one night while he is out recording audio on a bridge. He manages to rescue Sally (Nancy Allen) from the wreckage, but another man - who we later find out is the front-running Presidential candidate McRyan - is left for dead.

After reviewing his recording of the accident, Jack determines that this was no accident. He believes that somebody deliberately shot out the tire, but who, and why? When video of the accident surfaces, shot by a man named Karp (Dennis Franz), Jack begins to suspect that both Sally and Karp know more than they're letting on.

We also see glimpses of a vigilante psychopath, played by John Lithgow, but who is he, and what are his motives? Jack is determined to find out the truth and unravel the conspiracy, but despite many clues that this wasn't an accident, nobody else seems to want to investigate any further. Jack is also scared that now that the assassins have achieved their goal, anyone who might discover that this was no accident must be eliminated, including himself and Sally, to whom he has developed an attachment.

Blow Out is an excellent film that entertains on many levels - plus it takes place in my fair city of Philadelphia. It doesn't dumb anything down for the audience, and the characters manage to act like any of us could see ourselves acting if placed in the same situations.

663055,5,6303471587,"BLOW OUT is probably my favorite Brian DePalma AND John Travolta movie.  Often criticized for his derivativeness from masters such as Hitchcock or others, DePalma found a niche in this film that he never really recaptured (with the exception of THE UNTOUCHABLES, but it's a different kind of film).  DePalma's trademark kinetic cinematography and plot twists are evident, but they don't seem as forced or contrived as in some of his other films.  I've never seen BLOWUP, and sometimes I hate it when people tend to compare similar films.  Let them stand on their own for whatever their merits might be.  This is a stunningly performed and hypnotic thriller, buoyed by the performances of both Travolta and Nancy Allen, who first appeared together in De Palma's brilliant CARRIE.  John Lithgow is very effective in his role as the killer after our stars.  Dennis Franz gives another solid performance as the sleazeball who sets Allen up with the presidential hopeful.  Some of the scenes where they're trying to get a good screamer for a horror movie Travolta is working on are priceless.

BLOW OUT culminates in a suspenseful finale at a Liberty Bell celebration in Philadelphia and his decision to slow mo the Travolta rush to save Allen is mesmerizing and agonizing at the same time.  Flashy thought it may be, I love the scene where Travolta and Allen are in the foreground of the fireworks.

DePalma was at his peak here and I have enjoyed this movie four times since its release.",1102723200,4,1484,4.849206349206349
663096,5,6303471587,"I love this film on so many levels, but there is a common criticism I tend to see about it which is that the John Lithgow character is useless to the plot.  I strongly disagree because without knowing his part in the story, all we're left with is a lame attempt to rip-off Antonioni's Blow-Up.

Instead, De Palma created an incredibly fun play on irony.  Part of the joy of watching this film is knowing what the protagonists don't know in the last two thirds of the story.  De Palma uses this as a vehicle to explain how exactly a conspiracy could be implemented.  If anyone know's De Palma's feelings on the Kennedy assisanation, they will see just how personal and revealing Blow Out is.  Not just with conspiracy theories, but also in the John Travolta character and his attraction to the nympho-qualities of Nancy Allen.  Personal, powerful, fun, and downright cynical--by far my favorite work from both Travolta and De Palma.

Also worth checking out is Casualties of War, Sisters, Greetings, and Dressed to Kill among many others.",1097798400,2,1037,4.754189944134078
663097,4,6303471587,"Arguably one of DePalma's best films, but definitely, and more importantly, one of Travolta's best.  In my always humble opinion, this is on par with Travolta's performances in Pulp Fiction and Saturday Night Fever (both of which earned him Oscar nominations).

Some will say I exaggerate, if only because this flick doesn't have the cult following that SNF and PF have established, but Travolta nails the gradually building paranoia and desperation of the character without taking it over the top (something he's sadly mastered in his many not-so-great performances).  He also delivers the character's affection for the Nancy Allen character perfectly.  His anguish in the final frames of the movie is almost heartbreaking.

However, even if you're not a Travolta fan (and I'm not entirely sure that's possible, even when he stinks), Blow Out is a great suspense/thriller.  Definitely one of DePalma's best of the genre and generally much better than most of the insultingly bad big-budget junk that comes out of Hollywood these days.",1095984000,,1035,5.242424242424242

I'm not sure how Blow Out (directed by Brian De Palma) will fare among the casual movie audience, I believe you would have to have at least a mild interest in the art of film making to draw any true greatness from it as the plot seems to break down a few times, but for those who do have that interest, you may see a diamond in the rough. There's a few times when something would fall short (be it dialogue, etc.) in the movie but usually right after that, great film making would come in to place.

663099,3,6303471587,"Having heard before hand, that Brian DePalma's ""Blow Out"" was like a tribute to Antonioni's ""Blow Up"", i was definately intreagued.  ""Blow Up"" is one of the greatest art films I've ever seen, and knowing that tributes are never as good as the original, i knew not to expect too much.
Basically, ""Blow Out"" involves a sound man (Travolta) recording sounds in a park at night, when a speeding car has what seems to be a blow out, crashes through a fence and into a lake.  Travolta is able to rescue the woman, but the man behind the wheel was dead before he could be helped.  Upon listening to the tape he'd made that night, Travolta recovers what he believes to be two sounds.  Naturally, he can't help but get involved, and try to solve the case.
I Enjoyed Blow Out for the obvious reasons; good acting, complex script, lots of well-drawn suspense.  And, if you've never seen or liked Antonioni's ""Blow Up"", the review can end here for you.  You'll probably enjoy this version.  Despite my complaints in the next paragraph, i really liked this movie.
However having seen and enjoyed ""Blow Up"", it looked to me like Brian De Palma did what everyone was tempted to do, but that no one should have done.  Made ""Blow Up"" a Hollywood movie.  ""Blow Up"" actually has a lot a great suspense and intreague, but the end is sure do disappoint those who need a clean-cut ending, which is to say, most theatre goers.  Basically, they smushed the plot of ""Blow Up"" down about 30 minutes, added some more murders and people skulking around shadowy rooms, and then gave it a conclusive ending.
Needless to say, it's frusterating to see a great piece of art turned into a decent Hollywood movie.  But hey, if you like a good suspense thriller, this works.",1086652800,3,1738,4.556270096463023

Travolta gives an understated performance (perhaps one of his best); Nancy Allen is also touching as the hooker with a heart of gold (love that Jersey accent) ; and John Lithgow is suitably creepy as the villian.  I also love the opening that lampoons the slasher horror films that were on the rise in popularity when this came out -- very witty satire from DePalma (though I wonder if he meant it as such -- he might have been poking fun at CARRIE, which he also directed).

Travolta is good here. Philadelphia works brilliantly as a character in this story about political corruption in the City of Brotherly Love. And, sure, DePalma takes his camera for a joyride or two--that's to be expected.
But the feeling of paranoia DePalma creates is so pervasive, you just might wonder where the bug is in your den. And the most amazing aspect of the film, one never noticed by critics, is that every shot in the film is composed of red, white, and blue elements, furthering the motif of real trouble in the land of the free and the home of the brave.

The movie itself is great, John Travolta is a sound-effect man who was out in the middle of the night to record some sound when he witnessed a car accident and the recording of the accident revealed something that could cause his life.

663157,4,6303471587,"Brian DePalma has been (sometimes correctly) accused of manufacturing little more than brilliant pastiche (which is another way of damning him with faint praise). I confess to be as guilty as anyone of this practice, finding films like Dressed to Kill slick, fun, but ultimately less works of art than of skillful post-modern artifice.
Blow Out is a haunting exception.  Yes, it has clear antecedents in Antonioni's Blowup and Coppola's paranoid classic, The Conversation.  But it is unfair to judge Blow Out by its similarities to these films.  One need only pay minimal attention to realize DePalma has his own goals in mind.  No mere retread of the standard paranoid political thriller, Blow Out is a bravura exercise in nuanced, multi-layered story telling.
Low budget movie soundman Jack Terry (John Travolta) is in the right place at the wrong time - while out recording some nature sounds for a B slasher flick (in which DePalma seems to poke fun at some of his own earlier work), he catches the sounds of an auto accident. In an incident reminiscent of Chappaquiddick, a car driven by a presidential candidate suffers a tire blowout and careens off a nearby bridge.  The candidate dies, but Terry manages to rescue his ""lady friend"", a party girl named Sally (Nancy Allen). Key to the story is his recording, which seems to contain a double-bang - perhaps the blowout preceded by a gunshot?  Naturally the story leads Terry into a web of intrigue featuring slimy political operatives, corrupt cops, and nefarious CIA henchmen.
Blow Out's visual style has drawn criticism from some quarters as being too flashy.  Ridiculous! The camera movements are precise and deliberate; designed to communicate story points with great efficiency.  The visual technique draws no more attention to itself than anything directed by Scorsese.  Raging Bull (released about the same time) is far more ""flashy"" and nobody complains about it.
The DVD itself lacks any special features, but the film transfer is vivid and detailed, with good color fidelity (essential, since the art-direction is a major ""star"").  It is also double-sided, with a pan-scan presentation on one side, and enhanced widescreen on the other.  Don't even bother with the pan-scan; DePalma and cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond's compositions are edge-to-edge, making full use of the Panavision frame.
Blow Out is not perfect.  Some of the dialogue is contrived and sophomoric.  Assassin Burke's (John Lithgow) golf pants in one scene make him look silly when he should seem sinister. But, on balance, John Travolta's solid performance and Brian DePalma's skilled direction more than make up for such lapses.  With Blow Out DePalma reaches deeper than usual - with a disquieting sub-plot about guilt, unrequited love, and the futility of seeking redemption. Its conclusion is the punch line to a bitter, existential joke.  Read closely, it's a scathing commentary on the Hollywood film industry itself, and the vampiric way it often feeds on very real, sometimes very sad, lives.",1002758400,53,3037,5.156822810590631
663158,5,6303471587,"After the unfairly bashed & hilariously satirical ""Mission to Mars"" (a satire almost everyone who saw the film seemed to miss) and the incredible virtuosity of ""Snake Eyes"" I will never underrate De Palma again as long as I live. The guy's a cinematic genius who hasn't lost his powers, just an understanding audience. And yet his peak years remain between ""Phantom of the Paradise"" & ""Scarface."" And the peak of that peak period is ""Blow Out,""  De Palma's most fully realized & poetically resonating elaboration of his favorite theme: the glossed-over & willfully ignored post-Orwellian horrors of modern America & the hypocrisies & power struggles & conspiracies that constantly churn its engine; the immense tragedy of this for its innocent victims & romantic heroes.  In ""Snake Eyes"" you had Cage & Gugino; the updated versions of Travolta & Allen in ""Blow Out.""
""Blow-Out"" keeps you fascinated & riveted through its thriller elements while implying numerous things on the way until the last 6 or 7 minutes and then bursts out on multiple levels of metaphor with one of the greatest, most poetic endings in cinematic history which brings everything full-circle from the beginning and ties all the loose ends up in one magnificent fell swoop. The many levels and essences of corruption in American society, the constant rape of the innocent and naive by the cynical and powerful, the exploitation constantly going on represented by the cheap film company Travolta works for using a real scream of a girl about to die to finally get it right, etc., not to mention the ever-relevant post-Chappaquidick-at-the-time, post-Clinton-Lewinsky-Condit-now comments on political corruption, political conspiracies and cover-ups, the Antonioni-Blow-Up-like foray into the nature of reality and experience and cinematic illusion itself, all of this comes together in the final two scenes with a cathartic, understated bang! And, of course, the key to all this is John Travolta's amazing, subtle performance, maybe his best ever, and Nancy Allen's equally effective one as the ultimate poster-girl for youth, vigor and innocence, confused, unwittingly corrupted by the dark side of America, always two steps away from being saved and two steps away from being too far gone. John Lithgow also must be mentioned, since he plays such amazingly realistic villians, so much like a regular guy, almost everyone's suburban neighbor, and yet because of this very fact so evil it's positively creepy! Also, Dennis Franz of NYPD Blue makes a memorable appearance as a low-rent sleaze-bag manipulator whose very weaknesses as an aspiring sleazebag make him harder to hate, making you understand why Allen would trust him! Excellent turn by Frantz. De Palma's films of this period also use an intentional, slightly artifical style of acting, not quite 'over-the-top' but just twisted enough to suggest a level of self-parody. In ""Blow Out,"" Travolta's character is the only one played mostly straight, with everyone else seeming almost surreal, hallucinations of themselves.
The DVD has an perfectly matted, not-pristine-but-relatively-decent-looking-to-my-eyes (although some DVD review places have complained about the color separation, I only noticed a slight swarming of black backgrounds during the night-scenes, and they still gave the transfer a C grade, not an F like the Scarface DVD) wide-screen transfer and the super-cool original trailer but not much more if 'extras' like a commentary are what you're looking for. It also has one of the cheesiest looking Main-Menu screens ever designed, but fortunately this is not reflective of the fair quality of the transfer itself offered in the DVD, just the result of some page-designer's nightmare. Oh yeah, the DVD also has a 'standard' full-screen version, on the other side, in case you're one of those geniuses who like watching your movies with only half the original motion picture on the screen, thinking you're getting more bang for your buck because your entire TV screen is filled!

663159,3,6303471587,"Brian DePalma's 1981 homage to ""The Conservation"" and ""Blow-Up"" is somewhat of a mixed bag. The opening and first half of the film are very well-handled, suspenseful and controlled, with very good use (as was DePalma's forte') of split screen, tracking shots and other filmic effects. However, the latter stages of the film sink into a few too many cliche's and towards the end what was meant to be suspenseful, almost seems laughable and too drawn out for it's own good. However, the film does hit the right note at the end.
John Travolta puts in a very good performance as the heroic soundman and John Lithgow plays an overzealous assassin incredibly well. I realise that Nancy Allen was DePalma's wife, but jeeeezz she's wooden, playing the idiot with the heart of gold routine that became a stereotype in the 1930s.
The DVD of ""Blow Out"" comes with the original trailer and the film itself has been nicely restored, with the visuals benefitting immensely from the widescreen ratio.

663164,3,6303471587,"This Brian de Palma film is essential in our western cinema. It picks the theme so marvelously exploited by Hitchcock of the voyeur who sees a crime (Room with a view), a murder being committed. But of course he has to develop the theme. Here the voyeur is a sound technician of the cinema industry who one nights sees, hears and records a presidential candidate being assassinated in the shape of a car accident, at the same time as a photographer was filming the same scene for some political and of course immoral and even criminal but politically and professionally correct project. It is when a serial killer of some kind gets into the picture and starts satisfying his desire to kill women, women of a certain type, at the same time as he cleans up the plate of the conspirators and plotters for the political assassination never to come out in the open. He destroys evidence. He tampers with state evidence. He eliminates witnesses and along with them a few more just for his personal fun. The film does not show any real deep meaning that has not been dealt with and developed over and over in the cinema. Politics are rotten. Nothing new under the sun. Politicians are sexual perverts. Nothing new under the sun. Police, media, simple people, everyone are only interested in non-disturbing, non-disquieting facts, even if they are absolutely false. The only positive point of this film, maybe even a new element, is the fact that an essential popular parade is totally disturbed by the main character running after the criminal in order to prevent his killing the direct witness of the murder. And yet the parade goes on as if nothing was happening. When society is celebrating its belly-button nothing can divert it from contemplating that belly button. And that is the power of criminals who use this narcissistic fascination to commit and cover their crimes. Don't worry they are not the only ones. In fact politicians are good too at doing that and what's more they can decide when and where the celebrations can take place to cover up their shortcomings, mistakes or even crimes.

663165,4,6303471587,"It's a flashy bit of work glittering with directorial skill, BLOWOUT, and proved to be too downbeat for audiences in '81 after the pop-fun-flash of the dizzy, funny, scary DRESSED TO KILL.  The ending screamed ""Be MINDFUL of what you ask for - You might get it"", and folks rarely want to hear that.  I mean, '81 was very different from '66 when its inspiration, BLOW-UP, hit these shores - folks, then, were open to speculation and reflection. In '81, everyone was dialing for dollars and watching soap-operas about the rich on Prime Time TV.  DePalma's cautionary tale about 'projection making perception' was too 'deep', too dangerous for a culture obsessed with getting a ""lifestyle, lifestyle!""
I suppose the underlying message of this perceptual thriller, modeled as it is on BLOW-UP (1966) is that one eventually sees what one is looking for. One may even inadvertently CREATE it in the process of seeking IT out.
In BLOW OUT, Travolta loses his object of affection because his TRUE affection is for putting together film and creating a coherent storyline out of fragments and clues.
The subtext, of course, would presage DePalma - the filmmaker - getting a divorce from his wife of that time - Nancy Allen (who plays the victim in BLOW OUT).
The surface story is, pointedly, a cursory political thriller modeled after Ed Kennedy's Chappaquidick episode, cursory because the surface story is NOT the point. Travolta plays a sound man who thinks he hears something foul in his ambient tapes, the starts toying with still photographs - and the emotions of a woman - as he seeks a thread in a mystery that may or may not even exist.
Nevermind he has forgotten that he has been sent out on assignment to find a ""real good scream"" for the low-budget slasher film for which he is doing the Sound Editing. He forgets and suppresses his original motivation and cloaks it in a higher purpose, and begins projecting his own ""personal effects"" (the film's original title) onto the situation around him, thus inviting trouble. Tragedy and Mockery await.
On another level, one could say DePalma was also having fun with the idea of someone from the low budget world of film having aspirations to create ""highbrow cinema"", and being sabotaged by his origins along the way.
While I agree with the film's psychology and view of things quantuum, the surface story of political intrigue is a tad thin for the director's giant canvass and directorial flash. Pino Donaggio's lovely score is thrilling, even if at moments it seems to overpower the film, and, in the end theme, tilts too close to being maudlin. It's a pity this score was never released in toto on CD - just excerpts (see the DePalma/Donaggio collection on Milan records - a nice CD that includes tracks from DRESSED TO KILL and CARRIE, too)
I liked BLOW OUT immensely when it appeared in '81 on the heels (ha) of DRESSED TO KILL. Time and maturity, and a deeper appreciation of the quietude of films from which it borrows (the aforementioned BLOW UP and THE CONVERSATION), have lessened its importance to me, but I still recommend it as an stunning display of directorial skill - one the dePalma's best moments - and a provocative comment on how consciousness might work... and even kill what it thinks it loves.",968889600,,3264,4.7939609236234455

Make no mistake: This movie is a master-piece. The only thing that got me wondering was that how come I'd never heard of it before. I guess because at the time, the movie didn't come to theaters in my country (I am sure it didn't play on TV). If you have not seen but thinking about it, do not hesitate. You will not be disappointed. Blow Out works in every aspect. It is suspenseful. It has a very well-paced, economically written screenplay. The sound editing and sound mixing is awesome. Excellent score.

It is loosely inspired by ""Blow-Up"" a British movie from 1966 but I think it is superior to Blow-Up in every aspect. I watched first this one, and then Blow-up and it is not difficult to see the similarities in the fundamental premise, an artist capturing a piece of reality only to realize its underlying sinister nature later when examines the object of his art under close scrutiny. However, aside from that similarity, Blow Out really improves upon many things Blow Up (in my humble opinion) failed.

A knife doesn't even seem to be penetrate a cop as he's supposedly being stabbed to death, the killer's breathing is so loud, it's hard to imagine that even those with music blaring can't hear it, and then there's the worst scream you've ever heard from a girl in the shower.  But then we realise it's a film within a film and we weren't alone in noticing how bad the scream was.  Travolta's character did too, he's a sound engineer on this pretty bad film.  The director or whoever the other guy is, doesn't like the wind sound effect and other noises in the film either.  Travolta's going to head out with mircrophone, massive head set (this is a 1981 film) and recording tape  and capture better sounds.  While he's standing on a bridge in a park doing this, he hears a gun shot, a tyre then blows and a limo smashes through the side of a bridge into the water below.  He races down to the scene, where he rescues an attractive young (well his age) bimbo female passenger (Nancy Allen - Robocop) and takes her to hospital leaving the deceased behind.  But at the hospital he's told to forget about the girl, she wasn't there.  He doesn't listen.

Also stars John Lithgow as a killer with a lot more hair than he does now, as well as Dennis Franz who would later become the main character in NYPD Blue.

The movie itself is my favorite DePalma movie not called The Untouchables.  At least off the top of my head.  It was because of BLOW OUT that Iwent out of my way to see Raising Cain (John Lithgow and Lolita Davidovich) back in the day.
BLOW OUT still tops ""Dressed to Kill (good but easy to figure out, no?!)"", ""Scarface"", ""Body Double"", even ""Carlito's Way"".  BLOW OUT offers a little political intrigue with a conspiracy, a serial killer, and a possible romance between a movie 'sound man' and a manipulated, small time hooker.
John Travolta stars in the movie that marked the downside of his career (after Grease; and Saturday Night Fever).  He is good in it but the box office was not.
John Lithgow (pretty much always a plus) is in BLOW OUT as is Nancy Allen whose performance (checkout xtras) was pretty much picked-on by critics for ""the choices she made (hear voice, for one)"" in her portrayal of the hooker.
Nancy Allen's interview (one of the xtras) might persuade (you) her performance was effectively 'planned'; and more necessary than originally perceived.

As for DePalma's first feature Murder A La Mod?  It was a bit maddening, began to make sense, and then got way too needlessly ""slapstick"", trying to be violent-funny.  At least it was less than 90 minutes long.
