7953747,5,B00005TNFE,"This was a very good production with a great cast.
This depression era play is dated, but still enjoyable.
I remember seeing it when it was on television.
Patti Lupone is great.",1456963200,,177,4.5625
7953748,5,B00005TNFE,"Unlike the 1948 version with James Cagney, this video of the play has the original ending, the one that Saroyan wrote.

The original ending is very powerful and for that reason alone you need to see this version.

The James Cagney version has a wonderful charm about it that's missing from this version, so I think it's good to see both.

This is one of my favorite plays of all time.",1452384000,2,384,4.380281690140845
7953749,4,B00005TNFE,"Very entertaining.  Great performances, especially by Patti LaPone and Nicholas Surovy.  WARNING: Chapter 14 has two quick instances of digital skip. These are on the master and are not a manufacturing defect. They are hardly noticeable and should not affect your enjoyment of this great play.",1256083200,,293,5.3478260869565215
7953750,2,B00005TNFE,"This review is of this production, not this play--the play is great; this production, if it were music, would be frequently flat and off key.  Some actors seem fine in their roles, and others are jarringly in-apt, if not inept.  I want to like this performance, but I keep being distracted by the clunky manners of some these players.  Also, the timing and verbal phrasing is often odd, even among the better actors, as if they were speaking lines from Ionesco, or another translated ""absurdist"" work.  Saroyan is closer to lyric poetry than to absurdism.  There are casting problems with the James Cagney version that he stars in, too, but he and his sister nail the poetic qualities of their lines--check out that film version from 1948, available for a pittance.",1227139200,,765,4.809160305343512
7953751,5,B00005TNFE,"You will LOVE this DVD! It talks of a simpler time, possibly even a happier time when technology hadn't taken over the world. When we put our trust in people, not machines. A time when people actually cared for one another. Of course there was still a social food chain, but it was different. Kids played in the street with each other, not with their iPods. You could talk to a stranger with little risk. There was still crime of course but the word ""terrorism"" did not exist. It takes place in 1939, Pre-WWII, and things were different. If nothing else you will appreciate the little things like being able to buy a beer with the change in your pocket, a bottle of champangne was six dollars (which was a fortune). A young Kevin Kline and Patti LuPone are among the most famous faces (they were courting at the time I believe). You must see this DVD! SUPERB!",1162512000,4,859,4.443037974683544
