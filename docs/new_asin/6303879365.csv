Though the video is only thirty minutes long, the stories are still very good. I recommend this  video for any Felix fan!",963792000,5,249,4.659090909090909
728157,5,6303879365,"If you are looking for the classic cartoon (or something like it), look elsewhere.

However, if you want a modern interpretation of the classic cartoon along with an incredible soundtrack done by an eclectic multipiece band, then this DVD is for you.

Excellent writing, strong humor, and definitely twisted (without being offensive).  While generally safe for the younger set, adult cartoon fans will enjoy this, too.  Great party backdrop.",1161129600,6,441,5.3478260869565215
728158,5,6303879365,"I didn't know what to expect from this newer take on Felix, but I was very pleasantly surprised by how much fun it is. It's different and very Twisted (in a good way) yet still Felix. Twisted Tales is a fantastic show. I wish the rest of the episodes were available.",1152057600,5,266,4.235294117647059
728159,5,6303879365,"This is a wonderful DVD for fans of animation and of Felix. I've been a Felix fan for decades and I'm extremely impressed by these 90's Felix cartoons! I hope there's more Felix on the way. The folks who are responsible for this DVD should be congratulated on a fine job. I hope they keep up the great work.

I love this DVD!",1101772800,6,325,4.158730158730159
728160,4,6303879365,"This Felix is different than the one portrayed in ""Felix the Cat - Collectors Edition"" which contains episodes from 1958 and 59.  This DVD contains newer episodes with a more modern Felix and a new supporting cast.  That being said, the episodes are still very entertaining and continue the tradition of Felix.  I would recommend this dvd to people who like Felix and do not mind seeing a new more modern take on the character.  I would also recommend this dvd to people who enjoy more contemporary cartoons such as: Goof Troop, and Tiny Toons, which these episodes remind me of.",1097193600,3,579,4.702970297029703
728161,5,6303879365,"In some ways he's more like your grandfather's Felix. Don Oriolo, the keeper of the Felix flame, successfully combined characteristics of Otto Messmer's Felix of the 1920s with Joe Oriolo's Felix of the 1960s to create a character who recalls earlier times but is in many ways truly original.
  THE TWISTED TALES OF FELIX THE CAT is an enjoyable blending of the classic and the contemporary. The cartoons are entirely modern even though some drawing styles and visual images from past eras are used in making them. The Magic Bag and Skidoo the Mouse are the only carryovers from the earlier Felix cartoons. Otherwise Felix appears with an entirely new cast of supporting characters.
  The music by San Francisco's Club Foot Orchersta is outstanding and deserves to be issued on its own CD. It has the flavor of 1920s and 1930s jazz and is not merely background music. It is written and performed to enhance the action on the screen and does so perfectly.
  The voice of Felix in this series is listed as Thom Adcox Hernandez in one set of credits and as Thom Adcox in two others.
 Rather than being an imitation of the type of voice Felix had in the earlier TV cartoons, the new voice gives Felix a not-so-squeaky sound and contributes to the originality of the character.  Overall, THE TWISTED TALES OF FELIX THE CAT succeeds on every level. It should appeal to those who remember earlier versions of Felix and those who are meeting him for the first time. It is great to have some of these cartoons available on DVD and hopefully we'll be seeing more of them before too long.",1090022400,10,1577,4.64748201438849
728162,5,6303879365,"no one likes to take chances on new things and unfortunately for this cartoon, it only ran for i think 2 years.  this dvd is a nice look back at it, with some of the best episodes.  its very nicely animated, a 30's 40's look animation with a nice soundtrack put in by the Club Foot Orchestra.  The music is very retro and cool, very much like the cartoons of the 30's and 40's had in thier days.  Yes, these are new cartoons made in the 1990's but they look so cool in the old style animation type drawings.  Very surreal, i mean extremely surreal cartoons.  they are extremely enjoyable.  I wish they would have released the whole first season on dvd, and released a soundtrack cd.  Youll like these felix cartoons if you're a fan, or just admire the early type of animation which i still think is the best.",1045008000,16,808,4.304635761589404
728163,4,6303879365,"This show along with Project Geeker were the greatest cartoon shows on saturday morning at the time.  This show was particularly appealling as it showcased high quality animated transitions and surreal universes not typical of television animation and reminiscent of the early years of b&w cartoons. This dvd contains a decent amount of material from the show.  It's more Twisted Felix than you can handle.  If you attempt to watch the entire dvd straight through you'll go insane.  The complete randomness, bouncy animation, high speed pacing and crazy animated transitions hit you hard and you'll have to take a break after watching every couple of episodes to regain your sanity.  This show is definitely worth it though, it's well animated, extremely clever, and very stylized.  You'll also notice some famous voice actors.  Now if they'll just release Project Geeker on dvd. . .",1018137600,6,883,5.1328671328671325
728164,3,6303879365,"I have to agree with my fellow reviewers here that ""The Twisted Tales of Felix the Cat"" tried very, very hard. Best of all, Felix's personality seems to be more or less intact, and there are some pretty weird, surreal things going on.
However, it just doesn't seem to gel quite right. The cartoons are an uncomfortable blend of 1920's and 1990's cartoon styles. In black and white it may have worked, or at least looked better, but this is full-color 1990's ""limited"" animation. This more modern type of animation gives a sort of cheap, ""plastic"" look to some of the drawings which make the 1920's stylings look out of place.
Overall, I'm not the least bit sorry I bought this, but the hard-core Felix fan may be a wee bit disappointed with this retro effort.
I think I would have been happier if at least the old Felix theme song had been included, or more classic Felix foes were on hand. Peking Duck and his henchmen are pretty cool, though, and the whole thing was a pretty good effort to bring Felix back to Saturday Morning cartoons.",1016582400,19,1039,4.531914893617022
728165,4,6303879365,"These cartoons try very hard to be cutting edge, bizarre, wierd, ....twisted in a word.
They are enjoyable, better than most recent cartoons, but not quite up to the initial potential of the series.  Not quite up to the surrealism of some early Felix cartoons, for that matter.",1014854400,6,277,4.770833333333333
728166,5,6303879365,"""The Twisted Tales of Felix the Cat"" was easily one of the high points of late 90s animation on network TV for me.  Incredibly surreal, I'd wake up *very* early on a Saturday or Sunday morning, specifically to watch this show.  For the next half hour, I'd just stare at the TV, bleary-eyed, amazed at the trippiness of the cartoon.  I was quite upset when it was taken off the air.  Talking sausages with moustaches, freaky flying eyeballs, lots of Magic Bag tricks and much more on this disc - I could watch this show every day and not get tired of it.  Buy this disc if you love surreal, humorous animation.  You won't regret it - it's a great price, too!",1001980800,10,657,4.344262295081967
7855253,2,6303879365,"This was a brilliant cartoon show -- surreal, even kaleidoscopic at times, and unusually witty. This BMG DVD, however, has the video quality of a worn-out low-quality homemade VHS recording off of television. The title of the set seems to imply that it contains the complete series; it only contains eleven shorts, in random order, from the first of the two seasons of the series.",1522022400,,380,4.861538461538461

7855259,4,6303879365,"This new series of Felix the Cat would probably not entertain the toddlers who have been brought up on a diet of powerpuff girls and pokemon as he did in the 1930s, but for those young or old who love the classic cartoons this is a modern attempt to reproduce the surrealism of the classics with the abstract craziness of modern cartoons. The result is a very entertaining (if confusing) tribute to classic animation. I used to watch this cartoon when it was briefly put on TV when I was young and I remember loving it. It was the only time I can remember seeing a modern cartoon use the surreal comedy style of the classic early cartoons which made them great. The only shame is that the DVD only offers a few episodes from the whole series. I'd recommend this for anyone who's a fan of classic 20s, 30s, or 40s cartoons, although todays kids would probably prefer Yu-Gi-Oh",1233273600,,874,4.46875
7855260,5,6303879365,"I was vaguely aware of Felix the Cat. At some point in my distant past I remember liking this cartoon. But my memory is for an earlier form of Felix,at least the theme song was still stuck in my head after so many years. This set of cartoons I had never seen. I was skeptical about the eighties translation of this classic and I watched the entire dvd,several times. I think I would best describe this style as Dr Seuss meats Ren&Stimpy with some R.Crumb toss in for added weirdness. If you're wanting plots and stories that make any real sense or have a profound message then don't look here. Non stop strangeness goes on in these cartoons and I loved it. The animation is clean and crisp and is at once familiar but new again. It sounds great too.",1190851200,,749,4.357142857142857
