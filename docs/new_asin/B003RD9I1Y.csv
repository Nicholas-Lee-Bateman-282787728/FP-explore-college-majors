4184547,3,B003RD9I1Y,"I was hoping for something like ""Room on a Broom"".  The full length live action/animation movie is Spanish with English dubbing. It's awkward in my opinion and I don't usually have a problem with dubbing (""Totoro"", ""Ponyo"", etc.). My 3 year old was mildly interested however, and I suppose that's what counts!",1469318400,,309,4.9423076923076925

4184552,1,B003RD9I1Y,"This movie looks like it was shot back in the 60's, just by its technology used and the poor film quality.  Garbadge story and bad dubbing on top of it.",1463616000,,152,4.066666666666666

4184554,2,B003RD9I1Y,"This is a strange movie. Mice turning teeth into pearls, talking mice, and horrible voice overs. The movie is in Spanish with English voice overs.  For me, it was like watching a bad train wreck. You want to look away, yet you can't help but look. My 1year old was enthralled with it. That seems to be the only up side.",1463184000,,319,4.229508196721311

4184556,3,B003RD9I1Y,"This cute idea for a kids movie seemed interesting enough. The acting is really bad but the animation portions were good. My granddaughters , five and eight did get involved with what I thought was the story line but I discovered they realized the dubbing was awkward and they were intrigued only briefly. wW had to shut down the film and play Twister!",1462233600,4,352,4.603174603174603
4184557,5,B003RD9I1Y,"Good movie for kids if your kids are not advanced. Meaning, I think graphics were poor in this age of technology.",1461628800,,113,4.428571428571429

4184562,1,B003RD9I1Y,The worst movie in the world! I lost brain cells watching this movie. Who in the world would ever want to be in actor in this movie! My kids will never be the same after watching this!,1456617600,,184,4.0

4184565,1,B003RD9I1Y,"It might be a great movie in Spanish, but it was a pretty terrible attempt to dub the movie in English. My kids couldn't get through the first 5 minutes.",1454198400,,153,4.133333333333334
4184566,3,B003RD9I1Y,"You could tell the English was inserted, but other than that a good movie",1454198400,,73,4.285714285714286
4184567,4,B003RD9I1Y,Very cute story- it is dubbed though if your kids ask why the mouths don't match,1453593600,,80,4.0625

4184569,3,B003RD9I1Y,"Horrible dubbing but the animation mixed with the miniatures was entertaining. There was a strange dream sequence that really disturbed my 4 year old daughter. But all 4 of my daughters enjoyed it. 8yrs, 6yrs, 4yrs, 1yrs old. I would recommend it but not highly.",1453593600,,262,4.844444444444444

4184572,1,B003RD9I1Y,"I would give this a half star or zero if I could. 1st off, the description should say that it is originally in Spanish and dubbed over. I think somehow a lot is lost in translation and in cultural differences. Between these two things and the length, my nearly 7y.o. niece was both confused and bored though she watched nearly to the bitter end despite the adults in the room trying to get her to switch to something better (like Room on the Broom or The Gruffalo or The Gruffalo's Child...but having just lost yet another tooth...finally even she gave up. With only 15 minutes to go!
The other issue was it was in the recommendation section alongside Room on the Broom, The Gruffalo, etc, which are all 30 minute programs whilst this was nearly 2 hours long. And the human acting seemed poor (translation/dubbing problem or truly bad acting, who's to know?) but the animation seemed ok, however much of it was mixed (humans interacting with animated creatures).",1453507200,7,962,4.6982248520710055

4184586,1,B003RD9I1Y,This film is horrible.  The American dubbers overact.  The main (human) character's American voice is annoyingly high-pitched.  I can't believe we watched through to the end.  Sigh.,1435968000,,181,5.592592592592593
