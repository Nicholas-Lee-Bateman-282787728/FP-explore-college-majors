307083,4,6300270297,A comic reflection of a time period sure not to return. Moreno is hysterical as are Ballard and Weston. Definitely worth watching and good for many laughs. There is also a certain melancholy to it now given what came of these bathhouses and their denizens. For those who lived through this it certainly triggers some memories.,1024617600,27,326,4.839285714285714
307084,5,6300270297,"Chunky, quivering, middle-class ordinary Gaetano Proclo (Jack Weston) is 'married to the mob' in the form of wife Vivian (Kaye Ballard)--and his crazy brother-in-law Carmine (Jerry Stiller) hates him.  Certain that Carmine is about to kill him, Gaetana hops a cab, tells the driver to take him to the last place any one would ever look for him... and suddenly finds himself hiding out from the mob in the middle of a gay bath house.

But this only the first ten or fifteen minutes of the film: there is much, much more to come, and all of it is over the top hilarious.  Jack Weston, Jerry Stiller, and Kaye Ballard are perfectly cast in their roles, but would you believe F. Murray Abraham (Oscar winner for AMADEUS) as the screaming queen to end all screaming queens?  How about Rita Moreno as a no-talent lounge singer who is busting a gut to become a bath-house star just like Bette Midler?  Or Treat Williams as a P.I. with blonde hair and a squeaky voice?  My own favorite of the bunch is Paul B. Price as Claude, a ""chubby chaser"" who takes one look at Jack Weston and falls in love at first sight--and then proceeds to make his life absolute hell by chasing him all over the bath house.  Before it's all over you'll find people hiding under beds, thrown into swimming pools, impersonating the Andrews Sisters, and being pursued by unwanted lovers of the wrong persuasion, all to absolutely hilarious, incredibly giddy effect.

Like most farces, THE RITZ deals in stereotypes--but it is never mean spirited in its portraits, and the cast carries off the eccentric characters (both straight and gay) with considerable aplomb.  Filmed long before the AIDS crisis, THE RITZ offers a comic look at a New York gay bath house and a way of life that would soon come to a grinding halt--a fact that gives the film a certain unintended poignancy for gay viewers.  Even so, you don't need any specialized background to enjoy this laugh-out-loud movie, which is as much (and really more) for a straight audience as it is for a gay one.  Highly, highly recommended... call over some friends, turn up the steam heat, break out some bath towels, and get ready for a true laugh riot.",1015113600,92,2174,4.650130548302872
307085,4,6300270297,"A well crafted, door-slamming comedy ala 'Noises Off' with a wonderful cast. Rita Moreno playing a no-talent bathhouse singer gives the performance of her lifetime (we all know how talented she really is, so seeing her 'off' is a lot of fun). Treat Williams is delicious as the soprano detective. Jack Weston, Paul B. Price, F. Murray Abraham, Kay Ballard and Jerry Stiller add their spices to this wonderful ensemble. It makes you wish that the days of the Continental Baths would come back'at least the wonderfully tacky shows at poolside!",998697600,28,541,4.956043956043956
307086,4,6300270297,"After doing so well on the stage, this little-known comedy was put to film. With the same 4 actors cast in their stage roles(Weston, Stiller, Abraham, and Moreno), insanity seems to run in this hotel! Plot put aside, this movie could seriously float on pure acting ability alone. Jack Weston gets a helluva lot of the laughs as the ""innocent"" thrown into a gay bathhouse. Rita Morena is reprising her Tony Award-winning role as the talentless Googie Gomez, a flawless performance.....and sideslitting one as well. Jerry Stiller manages to grab a few great lines as the insane brother-in-law after Weston. And, my personal favorite, F. Murray Abraham as the flamboyantly gay Chris. He's hysterical and has the lines that have you on the floor in stiches. This is his first real movie role and it's a great start!",988761600,7,811,4.884057971014493
307087,5,6300270297,"This is A HARD CORE COMEDY from 20 years ago! Proclo (Jack Weston) is a plump'n'chubby man with a problem. He is married to the Mafia via his wife. They are both attending a family gathering where the lady's father is  expected to expire. Jerry Stiller (Ben Stiller's father for those too young  to know this. Y'know...THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, yeah! That one!) plays  the soon-to-be defunct Mafia-man's son. The gathering is all the more  somber (and comical) because everyone is wearing black. Proclo is made to  wait with the rest of the distant family members while his wife and her  brother attend to their father's agonizing call. Behind closed doors  Proclo's father-in-law decrees before dying (and his decree is law since  he's the head of the Mafia) that Proclo must die.  This sends Jerry Stiller  into a frenzy...he will uphold his father's edict...he will kill Proclo.
What  ensues is one of the most outrageously absurd and hysterically funny  comedies ever captured on film.  Proclo figures that the last place where  his brother-in-law will search for him is in a gay bathhouse in New York -  The Ritz. There, he hopes to get a room where he can pass the night in  utter anonymity. Unbeknownst to him, there is a patron at the Ritz that  night...a rather short gentleman...who loves fat men. He keeps trying to entice  Proclo into coming to his room using candy and chocolates, and a  four-course meal, while calling him ""my jelly-roll baby"". The  problem, of course, is that Proclo is not gay. Rita Moreno plays a Puerto  Rican semi-diva, Googie Gomez. And she is sure Proclo is a producer named  Mr. Carmine Vespucci. She will pester him until she lands a contract. Her  Puerto Rican accent had me laughing so hard my stomach hurt.
Treat  Williams will have everyone smacking their lips in his microscopic towel,  all the while, posing as a gay patron. He plays a detective whose voice  never developed into that of an adult man...he sounds like a choirboy. F.  Murray Abraham plays this nelly habitu&eacute; of the Ritz who is desperate to  find someone... anyone. At one point Googie is trying to seduce Proclo in his  room. Williams and Abraham are hiding under the bed; when Googie finds out  Proclo has two guys under his bed she says, ""you think I don't know  you're making hee-hee-hee, poo-poo-poo, ha-ha-ha with that maricon you've  got under the bed?"" Abraham pops up and says ""TWO MARICONS!""  Then Williams tries to explain that he's not gay. He says ""I was born  with this voice!"" Googie says ""SO WAS IMA ZUMAC!""
I'd love  to have a copy of this movie on DVD. If you saw THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT  MARY and liked it, you'd probably enjoy THE RITZ too. And you'll be able to  see that comedy runs in the Stiller family.",959299200,7,2749,4.711578947368421

Treat Williams is young and gorgeous and shows his talent for off-beat  comedy.  Rita Moreno plays no-talent bathhouse entertainer Googie Gomez in  one of her best performances.  She's well over the top depicting a Puerto  Rican singer who has intentions of making the big time... except that she  can't sing!  The movie is very fast paced with tons of great repeatable  lines, and this is one of those movies that grows on you, becoming funnier  over time.

307218,5,6300270297,"I've watched this movie over and over and NEVER get tired of it! It is hysterically funny. F. Murray Abraham steals every scene he's in as Chris, an outrageous patron of The Ritz bathhouse. Rita Moreno is hilarious as the no-talent Googie Gomez who is desperate to land her ""big break"" in showbiz. Jack Weston plays the bewildered, befuddled Gaetano Proclo, who thinks The Ritz will be a safe place to hide out from his maniac brother-in-law, Carmine Vespucci (Jerry Stiller), who has a hit out on him. Gaetano finds The Ritz anything but peaceful, when Claude Perkins (Paul B. Price), a chubby chaser, falls in love with him at first sight, then ardently pursues him all over the bathhouse. There's also a young, very handsome Treat Williams as the squeaky-voiced detective. Throw in Kaye Ballard as Gaetano's long-suffering wife Vivian, and you've got a wild, memorable romp. Dave King, who played Abe Leftkowitz, is the calm in this madcap storm of characters. You'll see a pre-Cheers John Ratzenberger in a small role as one of the Ritz patrons.

It is amazing how talented Rita Moreno managed to sound so bad as the talentless Googie Gomez, with clumsy dance moves and a heavily accented, pitchy singing voice. All of the actors were well-cast in their roles; it is not a surprise several, including Rita Moreno and F. Murray Abraham, were in the 1975 Broadway production who reprised their roles in the movie. Although the setting is based on the Continental Baths, it was actually filmed in England; if you listen carefully to their dialogue, Gaetano's two daughters are played by English actresses.

This was a first-class, first rate production with Richard Lester as Director. The pace is fast, wild and entertaining. It was based on a 1975 play by Terrence McNally (the same year that ""Saturday Night At The Baths"" was made), who adapted it to the silver screen.  It's a fun and loving reminder to gay audiences of days gone by of the freewheeling 70s and the bathhouses; it is a hysterical madcap comedy that has great universal appeal. This will be a wonderful addition to your DVD library.",1466726400,2,2103,4.836111111111111

307283,5,6300270297,"As many others here have said, this is a very funny movie, especially if you ""get"" all the gay references to vintage films and music popular with gay men. I am a big fan of the English low- budget ""Carry On"" series of films, when I showed this film to a friend the other day, I spotted a couple things I hadn't noted when watching this film previously. The guy who wears chaps at the bath house is Peter Butterworth, who was in many of the ""Carry On"" films. And I swear, lest my eyes deceive me, there's a 5 second or less glimpse of Kenneth Williams as the innocent bystander Kay Ballard bungles into upon entering the bath house. Could be he had a larger role at one point and it was edited out for unknown reason.

When I show this film to people now, they often only recognize Jerry Stiller as Ben's father or from his role in ""Seinfield"". He and his recently-deceased (early June 2015) wife (Ben's mother) were Stiller and Mera (not sure of the latter's spelling), a great comedy duo on film and TV for many years. I recall Kaye Ballard from the old ""Sid Caesar"" pioneer TV show! So there's some[one} old, some[one] new (Treat Williams, a treat in a towel with a ridiculously high voice), some[one] borrowed (the ""Carry On"" folk), and some[one] blue (most of the lead cast members, particularly Stiller) here. Not to mention this film kick-started not only Treat Williams' career but Rita Moreno's (""Googie Gomez"") career as well.

I was surprised to hear it was filmed entirely in England( I beleive maybe one 3 second scene with Jack Weston exiting a cab was filmed in The Big Apple).It may have been Treat Williams 1st acting gig, & not only was he hilarious, but cute as hell as well. Jack Weston was perfect as the confused family member seeking innocent refuge in what he thought was a male ""spa"". Slowly he learns 2 things 1) it's a gay bathhouse(fashioned after the ""Continental Baths"" @ New York's Ansonia Hotel-it was their pool and gym area, but times got tough so they leased it to ""questionable figures"" who spread the word that ANYTHING can happen here-I 1st saw Bette Midler there,as an entertainer in the early seventies)).& 2) He's being hunted down by an unknown P.I.(Treat Williams) hired by his brother-in-law(Jerry Stiller-another superb performance)to track him down, then have him killed. It's Rita Moreno who just has to open her mouth & you die laughing. She plays the entertainment ""for the boys"" poolside, and gets caught up in the mayhem that ensues. She's such a joy in this film! It has made me a fan of hers to this day. There's also a man constantly seeking Mr. Weston's character for ""companionship"", attempting to seduce this poor frightened man into his ""room"" for fun & games, using cupcakes, cake(Zabar's bag in film too),and anything else he thinks will lure him in & he adds to the never-ending comedic tone of the film.

Treat Williams is hysterical in his role as a private detective following his straight suspect into a gay bath house in New York.  Cleverly similar to the real ""Continental Baths"" on the upper West Side in Manhattan, anyone who ever went to the ""Tubs"" will have an extra understanding of the funny situations happening there, but it is not neccessary to enjoy  the story or activities showcased in this farce.

Treat Williams is a treat for the eyes in his skimpy towel worn throughout the film.  The towels are less flattering on many of the other cast members, but that too, is part of the fun.

Rita Moreno is great as a ""steamy"" entertainer (please excuse the pun) with Jerry Stiller,  Jack Weston and Kaye Ballard, all turning in perfect performances.

Once hidden, Gaetano gets mixed up in the crazy world of Googie Gomez (Rita Moreno) - the bath's resident grande diva with delusions of actually having talent in the first place - as well as a squeaky-voiced P.I. (Treat Williams).

One of the most outrageous comedies you'll ever have the pleasure of seeing, based on the Tony Award-winning stage play by Terrence McNally (and featuring many of it's original leading players).  Ms Moreno stops the show cold with Googie's manic musical number ""Everything's Coming Up Roses"", Jack Weston recreates his acclaimed stage performance as Proclo; and baby-faced Treat Williams hits all the right high notes.  F. Murray Abraham co-stars as Chris, the bath's main screaming queen; with Kaye Ballard as Weston's frantic wife Vivian, and Paul B. Price (also from the stage cast) as relentless ""chubby chaser"" Claude.

307539,5,6300270297,"This is the famous pre-aids gay movie from the great, now forgotten, Richard Lester who developed it from a Terence Mcnally off-Broadway play.
Without Lester there would have been no Bonnie and Clyde, no Godfather, nor The Graduate. An American in London (not Paris) Lester who presented the world with those incredibly 'up close' Beatles movies in 1964 and 66 teased Hollywood with the new 'Hollywood-Look-that-Could-Be' especially in lighting and editing when Hollywood was still muddling along with 50s style westerns and musicals, whose staple products often had dated, garish colors and frigid, distant editing.
By 1976 he had made his mark but not greatly his money. The wunderkinds of the seventies, Spielberg et al, would take all of the credit for the seismic shift of the early seventies but much was also due to Lester.
This movie was not popular on release but was and is fabulous all the same. Treat Williams and Rita Moreno develop the movie's tone. He a mild mannered eager to please detective with a disturbing high pitched voice,on the lookout for on-the-lam Jack Weston escaping from his Mafiosa brother in law; she, a he who is a she, drama monarch of the house, Googy Gomez the great Klutz-Queen of the New York bath house circuit. A young F Murray Abraham doing a very nice laid back Groucho Marx in undershorts, supports the insurgency.
There are no movies like this any more. The Beatles movies were full of that lovely Lennonesque self deprecation. People now want to laugh at others rather than themselves. Take a look at this movie and see how things used to be in some movies you could go to.",1221436800,4,1619,4.827338129496403

And while Treat Williams is always a treat to look at, playing (satirically) queer makes him a dull light in the movie.

While The Ritz is a very funny comedy in every sense, it is elevated to camp classic status by the fact that it is set in the nuttiest gay bathhouse ever envisioned, and peopled by wonderful, crazy characters, beautifully brought to life by a first-rate cast. At its heart though, The Ritz belongs to Rita Moreno as two-bit lounge singer Googie Gomez. The delivery of her fabulous lines in 'that accent', turns Googie into the kind of larger than life Diva who can elicit gales of laughter from Ritz-philes by a simple quote... "" I had a drean, a drean abou ju bebe..."" Googie was the seventies equivalent to modern-day camp creations such as Eddie from Ab Fab.

I owned the VHS before and now I own this DVD. I love the full trailer, but I wish they had more extras to give.

This movie can be viewed by kids, there are no nudity seasons, but if the kids are real young, they may need to have a few of the situations explained to them. A great dialogue starter.

It's a Richard Lester-directed film and for anyone familiar with his work, that tells you you're in for a frantically funny ride.  One of the great underrated comedians - Jack Weston - is the star, but in name only with co-stars such as Rita Moreno, Jerry Stiller, F. Murray Abraham and Treat Williams pulling their comedic weight.  All of the action takes place one night in a (this is what ""dates"" the film) gay bathouse in Manhattan.  An unsuspecting Weston takes refuge from his mob-boss brother-in-law Jerry Stiller who is trying to carry-out his father's dying wish to ""Get Proclo!""  Weston looks as ""at home"" with this ""family"" as a pair of brown shoes with a tuxedo.  Trying to hide while fending off an ardent ""chubby chaser"", a fame-hungry Rita Moreno and Treat Williams as the high-voiced detective hired to find Proclo, the entire evening comes to a head during the club's amateur night show.  Several nice twists throughout the film and just the joy of seeing Jack Weston in center ring is well worth the price of admission.

There Gaetano stumbles across an assortment of oddball characters, including a rabid chubby chaser, go-go boys, a squeaky-voiced detective, and Googie Gomez, a third-rate Puerto Rican entertainer with visions of Broadway glory who mistakes him for a famous producer . . . and whom he mistakes for a man in drag.

Jack Weston, Rita Moreno, Jerry Stiller (yes Bens dad), and F Murray Abraham all reprise their broadway stage roles in this 1976 film version directed by Richard Lester. Also in the cast are Kaye Ballard and Treat Williams. The film, Weston, and Moreno all received Golden Globe nominations.

Ultimately it's a flawed film flagging in a couple of places especially the final 15-20 minutes. However stand-out performances from the cast lift the film to deliver some very funny and memorable moments and I will never ever tire of Rita Morenos poolside carbaret performance.

The scene is set when a timid scion of a New York Mafia dynasty takes refuge from his murderous brother-in-law inside a gay bathhouse. Of course, this gives rise to lots of very funny jokes. Rita Moreno received an Academy Award nomination for her role as Googie Gomez. Her performance was based on the early career of Bette Midler, who started off as a chanteuse in a gay bath house called The Everard.

Rita Moreno is one of the very few people who have won an Oscar (film), a Tony (stage), an Emmy (TV) and a Grammy (music) award. There are only nine such stellar performers. John Gielgud and Mel Brooks are two of those greats. Another Academy Award winner in the cast is F Murray Abraham who won a supporting actor statue for Amadeus.

What makes the film work is that when the jokes are funny they are belly-rollers.  The film is augmented by the high energy of an impeccible cast who leave you smiling as the credits roll.  Three performances stand out to me.  Rita Moreno's Latino house chanteusse who does some interesting variations of Broadway standards.  F. Murray Abraham as the snarky denizen of the film's alternate lifestyle hotel.  Last, but not least, Treat Williams as the private-eye with the high-pitched voice.  Despite a lot of off-color humor there's a certain sweetness to this enterprise.  The makers and the performers just want to entertain us and that's exactly what they do.

His performance is key to much of the laugh out loud guffaws throughout this romp, all the while doing a falsetto voice that belies his all american macho detective appearance.  And it works!!!  Only in this movie could all these sterotypes have paraded about in such wanton camp and still steal your heart.  Kudos to all involved.  Someone suggested a movie night with towells et al.

This is not a boxed set, instead each film is released individually. The plot involves a Cleveland sanitation company owner who decides that a New York all-male bathhouse will be the perfect hideout. You see, as people in the sanitation business sometimes are, Gaetano Proclo (Jack Weston) is married to the mob, and his brother-in-law (Jerry Stiller) has been instructed to put the hit on him.

307653,5,6300270297,"I love this movie. It was the first movie concerning gay people that never apologized for being gay. It was the first movie in which gay people didn't have to suffer nobly.  It was the first movie where we actually had fun.  No suicides here.  No one agonizing over their homosexuality.  Yes, it's true that it's stupid and has gay characters personifying every cliche and stereotype you can think of and the plot has some major holes in it, but it is a farce after all. However, the difference between this and your average Adam Sandler comedy is that for once it is our joke, we are laughing at ourselves rather than being laughed at and you can not imagine how powerful that was in 1976.  And it's not as though the straight characters aren't equally ridiculous.

If you really want to appreciate what we were still up against when this movie was released just get a load of this quote from the NYTimes review of ""The Ritz"" written by Richard Eder and published on 8/13/76:
""To have a tolerance, or even an acceptance of homosexuality doesn't rule out having an underlying physical distaste for it. Inevitably perhaps, the camera emphasizes the physical element far more than it was emphasized on the stage. To put it bluntly, it shoves up too close--for most of us, I think--too much pale flesh organized around unshared intentions. There are simply too many male homosexual stomachs, arms and faces at too short a range.  It spoils the picture.""  Remember, these comments are from a NYTimes review so you can imagine what was being said elsewhere.

The cast: The wonderful Rita Moreno.  I've read that she did not like the director, Richard Lester and was not particularly happy with the film.  I've never seen the play so I have nothing to compare it to.  All I know is that whenever I think of Googie Gomez a great big smile spreads across my face and that's pretty special.
Jack Weston was certainly one of the busiest character actors for a couple of decades.  When I was a kid it seemed he was in a different movie or tv show every week.  I can immediately think of three juicy movie roles he had.  This one, ""Wait Until Dark"" and ""The Four Seasons"".
F. Murray Abraham pre""Amadeus"" is a riot and reminds me of a dozen queens I've known.  What can I say about the young, beautiful Treat Williams except that even with that hilarious voice he has me breaking out in a sweat. Kaye Ballard and Jerry Stiller are exactly as funny as you would expect them to be.

O.K., it's not politically correct but if it were it wouldn't be as much fun.  As Michael so controversially said at the end of ""Boys"":  ""If we just didn't hate ourselves so much.""

In the first scene, where the ""family"" is awaiting the imminent death of the patriarch, the son-in-law (Jack Weston) is sitting with his daughters, who are complaining that they're bored.  The very first line in the film is delivered by one of the daughters: ""I want to go back to Cleveland.""  As it turns out, this film was shot in England, and they hired local girls to play the roles of the daughters.  One might think they would have hired girls who could at least fake an American ""accent,"" but, as it was, this girl's delivery came out, ""I want to go beck to Clayvlind.""  Too funny.  And the camp begins.
