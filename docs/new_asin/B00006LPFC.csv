7971625,2,B00006LPFC,"Playboy is now eliciting an extreme distaste for camera pans in my adult entertainment.  This is mostly short behind-the-scenes kind of stuff and relatively little in the way of actual features of each model (if at all).  And those features are short and have far too much use of a camera moving all the time... and I do mean ALL. THE. TIME... it is CONSTANTLY panning this way, panning that way, panning up, panning down, zooming in, zooming out, fading from one shot to another... it gets extremely tiresome.  It means every single shot of whatever you want to see is always going to be a brief pass and then it's gone.

You do still manage to get some explicit shots here and there, and some of the models are well endowed in the labia so I'll give a star for that, and one for the ""production value"" even though it spends way too much time navel gazing at that instead of the babes.  But as other reviewers have said, it's all pointless when it's chopped up this bad - everything is just too fleeting to be interesting.  Either the girls can't convey their passion because the camera misses it, or maybe in some cases the camera is trying too hard to compensate for a lack of passion in the model?  Why should the models bother moving at all if the camera is perpetually flitting around?  Such a pity.

I found this a little bit arousing the first time I watched it (the discovery phase of the naughty bits), but the second time was so irritating that I had to stop before the mouse became embedded in my screen.",1420502400,,1516,4.405017921146953
