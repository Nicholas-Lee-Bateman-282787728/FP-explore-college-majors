455162,4,6302363098,"I love romances and good acting, and my husband is a classical pianist.  Consequently, this is one of our favorite ""date"" movies (after""Immortal Beloved""). It shows musical competition as what  is is--at least as serious an endeavor as, say, the NBA championship or the  Super Bowl.  Regarding an earlier reviewer's remark about how it portrays  ""modern"" compositions---well, not all of us think  ""atonal"" was such a good idea in the first place.  The acting is  great, the love story is simultaneously hyper-romantic yet believable.  It's easy to understand how Amy could fall for someone who plays Beethoven  like that. I know I did!",955238400,12,635,5.077669902912621
455163,2,6302363098,"The Competition is a cozy love story with nothing in it.  The piano competitors, the teacher, the conductor, and the candlestick maker are little more than a collection of circumscribed, mechanical strawmen.  The  personalities assigned to the supporting actors amount to predictable  stereotypes.  Rich in great music but empty of substance or purpose, the  viewer is starved of any hopes of a proper introduction to classical music  or artists.
The movie succeeds in its portrayal of oddness in certain  characters, and indeed many classical musicians, myself included, possess  such oddness.  But a personality, however odd, at least possesses life.  The movie fails to deliver this critical piece of substance in its extras.  Further, The Competition demonstrates an enormous ignorance of contemporary  classical music to the point of nausea.  It seems the conductor in this  flick introduces such ""weird"" music to ladies back at his crib  while getting them high and coming on to them.  The producer is apparently  saying that contemporary music is good for nothing else and that its  composers must belong to the same ilk as the average beatnik dreamer.  The  truth of the few contemporary masters among us is almost a perfect about  face of this rendering.
This piece is fine for a casual, curled up  viewing of a love story with one's lover and a bottle of wine.  But for  richness and culture, try Mr. Holland's Opus or Shine.",947894400,6,1435,5.055793991416309

455253,5,6302363098,"This movie haunts me.  I had to watch it several times to get the complete picture of what was happening with each character, how each piece contributed to the whole movie, and all the emotional subtleties.  And I'm glad I did.

I purchased it because it combines two of my greatest passions:  making music and Richard Dreyfuss.  Each time I watch it, I feel my own emotions intensify as I watch the emotional struggles of the characters as they deal with themselves and each other.  I could feel it all in this movie as in very few others.  The relationship between Paul and Heidi is complex, and though I find Heidi's verbal expression unusual, it is also a part of her charm.  And though Paul comes off as a jerk much of the time, his inner conflicts are behind it.  We also see the motivation behind Lee Remick's character, though it is never specifically verbalized.  And we get some insight into the other contestants, as well as the conductor who has his own issues.

The ending was both a surprise, and yet not surprising, given our understanding of the characters.  I liked that it was ""flexible.""

And there is a scene about halfway through that I found powerful in the way it was done.  If you've seen the movie, you probably know the scene I'm referring to.

If you are a musician and if you love intense emotion, this movie may well have the same appeal for you that it did, and still does, for me.  It only helps that Dreyfuss and Irving are eye candy.",1438646400,3,1466,4.454887218045113
455265,3,6302363098,"Sometimes it's better to let old movies remain a memory.  I saw this when it came out in theaters and enjoyed it.  Watching the DVD after 35 years left me less satisfied.  The cast chews the scenery (Dreyfuss and Remick in particular).  It's filled with wooden stock characters.  I have no idea what the defection of the Soviet piano coach has to the overall plot and the brief appearance by James Sikking (Hill Street Blues) as a federal agent serves no real purpose.
You do get snippets of great piano concerti throughout the movie, but not enough to carry the day.
It's probably worth a watch if you are into the world of classical music, but I doubt that it's a realistic view of the brutal world of classical solo competitions.  If you like this sort of thing, I'd recommend Amazon's own Mozart in the Jungle as a more up-to-date, edgier and funnier look at the world of classical music.",1435708800,,892,4.54375

455267,4,6302363098,I have waited since the original film for a copy of this movie because of the piano playing which I believe to be the reason so many people have wanted a copy. Unfortunately according to my memory (defective?) this is a cut down version where the piano playing in the preliminary run through of piano pieces before the concertos has been essentially removed. Presumably someone producing this version could only see it as a love story and thought the piano playing was a distraction on the basis that who would want to hear classical music. I was disappointed but it is still worth a look.,1433376000,,589,4.619047619047619

455273,5,6302363098,Very good romance movie if you are very much into professional piano playing especially-it takes place during a piano competition. Dreyfuss & Irving are a great paring in this movie & I consider this one  1 of Richard Dreyfuss's best movies filmed in 1980. Lee Remick  & Sam Wanamaker also star.  Great picture & sound quality/ it's another loop recording DVD which means it will start & play over & over again when the movie is over until you press stop on your DVD Player.,1424563200,,474,4.552941176470588

455326,4,6302363098,"The Competition is certainly not a classic, but if you play piano or even love watching great pianists perform, this is probably the best film ever made about actual piano performance.  Richard Dreyfuss (in one of his earlier post-Jaws roles) is in a Van Cliburn type competition pursuing his final chance to make it as a concert performer.  This is a very tough field to crack and they generally don't let you compete any more after age 30.  He is now 30 so if he doesn't win this time, he can kiss his concert career goodbye and have to settle for teaching in the K-12 circuit the rest of his life.  The drama comes not only from his desperation that he must succeed or his career ambitions are over, but his chief competition is a 21 year old kid who is just beginning her career but has loads of promise.  He is hugely talented too, but with ten years more time to make him jaded, he is quite the cynic.  Of course, they end up falling in love.  And that's a problem because they have to be brutal if they're going to beat each other.  Which means he's also not a very nice guy.  So yes, you might say this sounds a bit melodramatic and it is.  I said it's hardly a classic.  However, Dreyfuss and Irving, both of whom have piano backgrounds, do some outstanding faking in this film.  As a pianist, I love this film and find it well worth watching not only for the gorgeous pieces that are played during the performance segments but for the absolutely wonderful and totally authentic ""fake"" piano playing that the actors are able to do.  From that point of view, completely impressive and one of the best films about piano ever made, even if the script did come out of a gumball machine.",1415232000,5,1691,4.381410256410256

455331,5,6302363098,"First, Amazon is doing a great service by putting old VHS onto DVD in its ""Choice Collection.""  It's not as high quality as digitally remastering, but it's not bad and there are thousands of really good movies out there which have not been converted.  The Competition is one of them.  A very young Richard Dreyfuss and Amy Irving star as rivals in a prestigious piano competition who fall in love, which is obviously going to cause a major conflict of interest.  This film was made just after Dreyfus shot to stardom in Close Encounters of the Third Kind and won a Best Actor Oscar for The Goodbye Girl.  I think the film may be ""too intellectual"" for the masses, as it has quite a lot of classical piano performance.  But it's worth a look just to marvel at how the heck they did the special effects which make it look like Drefuss and Irving are really playing these incredibly difficult concertos.

That said, the main reason I love this movie is the chemistry between the lovers, and the surprise ending, which was even more of a surprise in 1980 than today.  Also, Lee Remick is a hoot as Irving's hard boiled, sarcastic piano teacher.  The plot has some interesting twists, and the supporting cast---especially Remick---does a good job of carrying various subplots forward.

I obviously highly recommend this overlooked classic.",1411430400,3,1334,4.760869565217392

The movie came out during a window of time in which he was one of the hotter actors in movies---""Jaws,"" ""Close Encounters"" and his Oscar winning turn in ""The Good-bye Girl.""  Amy Irving is his fellow piano nerd and love interest.  Dreyfuss tends to over power her in acting skill and ability and it shows.  The rest of the cast does a decent job, particularly Lee Remick as Amy's mentor.

In sports competitions it's easy to figure out the winner---they scored more points, they knocked the other guy out, they got to the finish line first.  But how to you determine a winner in a performing arts competition?  Should performing artists even be subjected to such competition?

I searched and found it on Amazon, and I bought it. The music is still wonderful, of course, but the movie as a whole doesn't seem to live up to my fond memories of it. The next time I'm in the mood to check out Mr. Dreyfuss, I think I will watch Jaws for the millionth time or so, it still being my favorite movie of all time. :)",1398124800,,633,4.19672131147541

The movie's DVD release occurred in mid 2012, which is undoubtedly what Amazon just sent me.

455412,5,6302363098,"As a concert pianist who has competed and placed in piano concerti competitions myself, I had always loved this film, though I could never find a copy of it on dvd.

Alas the the transfer to dvd is only mediocre and I wished they would have included extras. Such as interviews with the actual pianists who performed the works for this movie including piano professors I have studied with including: Daniel Pollock (who plays the Prokofiev Concerto no. 3 for Amy Irving's character), and Eduardo Delgado who performs the last movement of Alberto Ginastera's Piano Sonata. no. 1 for Richard Dreyfuss character.

What I love about this movie:

1.  All the pianists specifically Richard and Amy do an extraordinary job of playing convincing concert pianists. I read where they rehearsed for hours to make sure finger placements look realistic.  As a pianist who has played both the Prokofiev and the Mozart, I was nearly shocked at how authentic the acting looked.

2. The dynamic between Lee Remick and Sam (Amy's piano coach and the conductor) is so high camp which makes for a funny bit of comedic relief.

3. Add in the cheesy period of disco and the other characters makes for a funny yet endearing movie.

4. Not to mention you get to hear vignettes of some of the best piano concerti ever composed.

Some fun notes about the movie.

The actual location for the competition is the San Francisco Aquarium.
The format of the competition was indeed accurate to many competitions I have played in.

I highly recommend this excellent movie to all classical music and piano lovers.

An excellent screenplay and superb acting by the two main characters and by Lee Remick ( ""The Days of Wine & Roses"")  and Joseph Cali (""Saturday Night Fever"").

I'm sure some one must have already mentioned about the weeks of training that the actors went through
to achieve a real look about their playing.

The picture of the world of classical music competitions is amped up a bit for a general audience, but not all that far off from the dynamics of the real thing.  Richard Dreyfess and Amy Irving are young and appealing as the central romantic couple in a story peopled with a variety of interesting characters.  It's not perfect, but the writer/director Joel Oliansky gets a lot right.

This does indeed lend more than a touch of authenticity, even though actual concert pianists did the recordings. The featured piano concertos were all played completely, not just in fragments. The unfolding romance has some interesting twists, but all works out well in the end. Dreyfuss and Irving are spot-on as competitors and young romantics; Sam Wanamaker looks and acts the part of a snooty conductor, and Lee Remick nails the part of the cynical, tough-as-nails piano teacher.",1365292800,2,641,4.944444444444445

While I myself am not a pianist, I do know a thing or two about classical music, and the ""faked"" performances of Richard Dreyfuss and Amy Irving are astonishingly well staged. They have hit their marks superbly, with split-second accuracy, not to mention convincing effort and timing. The blossoming love affair is intriguing, but I found the Paul Dietrich character (Dreyfuss) to be a bit stuffy and dramatically frustrating. The back story explained much of his uptight behavior at the competition, but that childish display of sour grapes following Heidi Joan Schoonover's performance of the Prokofieff Third Concerto turned me against him for good. Well, at least he was not stereotypical, and Dreyfuss certainly did not ""phone in"" his riveting performance. As for Amy Irving as Heidi, I could not keep my eyes off her pretty screen presence, and she filled her character with genuine human emotion. I did not find Lee Remick's role to be very convincing. Not for a minute did I buy into the idea that she was a former concert pianist who has become a hard-nosed, crack-the-whip teacher. The secondary stories about the other competitors were pointless and distracting.

I'd been reduced to utilizing a VHS tape whenever I wanted to see this film. And it's a film that plays well with multiple repeats due to all of the music.

I jumped at the chance to order this, even though the description indicated a 4x3 1.33:1 transfer.  I was hoping for a good-enough transfer, something better than VHS.  What I got was FAR BETTER THAN EXPECTED. Amazon's specs are wrong - this film was remastered, and is in full widescreen 1.85:1, enhanced for 16x9 screens. To be sure, this is an MOD title, meaning you get a DVD-R of it once you place an order. But fear not, it plays fine, looks great, and finally presents this movie in a decent format for home video.

There are no menus - the film just starts up when you place it in your player. There are chapter stops scattered throughout the length of the film. Most seemed reasonably logical as far as placement goes.

I too wish the DVD would come out.
The music, especially Amy Irving's Prokofiev concerto at the end, is truly stunning and makes the movie so unique and enjoyable. (I only wish I could find a DVD of the actual pianist who played it.) It's wonderful to enter the world of the serious would-be concert pianist and the divas who had already made it (Lee Remick and Sam Wannamaker's characters) and this movie gives people a really great idea what the world was like back in the late 70's/early 80's (Polyester, disco, cold war, defections,etc.) The love story is at times, just a little sappy, but you have to remember that the characters are naturally very passionate (or they wouldn't be very good musicians, let's face it.) I thought it was actually a pretty realistic and fascinating story-line and there's the age old question of the sexual power struggle at the end- that one still hasn't been resolved. A few people have commented that Richard Dreyfuss overacts but I really disagree. His character is a diva-in-the-making and Dreyfuss won an Oscar for acting right around this time- he was excellent. In person, he was a jokester and constantly having too good of a time - the exact opposite of the character he plays. Viewers who are a lot younger may think the characters are unrealistic but even in the 80's, the world was a lot different- people thought differently- so I'd really give it a chance.",1210550400,6,1724,4.618892508143323

It was a sappy love story in 1980, almost embarrassing, but looking at it now I'm surprised by how well it was put together, without any computer effects, without 5-second cuts for short attention spans, etc. The acting is competent, but it's the music that carries the film. The sexual energy comes from Prokofieff, not Amy Irving.

I used to get residuals twice a year from this, my only major Hollywood gig, but the checks stopped last year. Possibly my contract ran out, or perhaps they stopped showing it on Romanian TV.

455698,5,6302363098,"If you're a fan of the real-life quadrennial Van Cliburn international piano competitions, chances are very good that you'll enjoy this movie! The fictitious ""biggie"" classical piano competition known as the ""Hillman"" in the movie de facto becomes the Fort Worth Van Cliburn if only by automatic inference.

Richard Dreyfuss and Amy Irving render very believable performances as classical piano competitors as does the quite excellent supporting cast. Fans of Beethoven's magestic ""Emperor"" concerto [5th piano concerto] will like it too as 'Paul Dietrich' gravitates to this great piece more than once. Key fingerings on various classical pieces are also believable unlike some movies where minimal attention is paid to note fingerings and it woefully shows!

It's the little things too. The tapping of the fingers on whatever is available when the music is 'envisioned' or the requisite smiling nod but inward disappointment as in real-life when the names are read and being a finalist or indeed first place itself was secretly hoped for but, alas, not in the cards. On the other hand, there are always the surprises! You know, move to the real-life 2005 Van Cliburn and the media dubbed ""the undertaker"" [sic] for Alexander Kobrin yet, how can I put it, Kobrin got in the last 'dig', as it were, for taking home the gold medal!

It's the essence of classical piano competitions and the focus mercifully remains the competition versus an overboard emphasis on the romance connection between Dreyfuss and Irving. Excellent characterizations and you'll quickly recognize the all too often 'walk on water' presumptions and demeanor of the conductor which is brilliantly played by Sam Wanamaker.

An aspect of some interest is how the actors ""fake"" (""finger-sync"") their piano pieces. (The audio was done by ""real"" pianists.) All of them except Richard Dreyfuss did it very well, and Amy Irving was EXTRAORDINARY. Dreyfuss's effort, I must say, was just awful. I understand that he spent 3 months being coached to fake the one piece he had to play, but believe me, it doesn't show. (Sorry!) Amy Irving, on the other hand, was so great at it that unless you know the piece she's playing, you'll be hard-pressed to know that she isn't really playing.

People who enjoy classical music with a good star cast will really enjoy this flic. The story is simple enough. Richard Dreyfus & Amy Irving are young pianists who fall in love while vying for the prize of a major competition. For the finale, Dreyfuss chooses Beethoven's piano concerto no. 5, while Amy chooses the more complex Prokofiev's piano concerto no. 3. Though Amy Irving is more smitten by Dreyfuss's charm, he's a bit reluctant to get involved due to the competition which both parties want to win desperately. Lee Remick is apt as the watchful teacher over Amy Irving. Sam Wanamaker who's also a popular director himself is excellent as the conductor of the competition. Popular 70's music director Lalo Schifrin is the movie's music composer & Joel Oliansky takes the honors for story, screenplay & direction.",1078617600,4,928,4.917197452229299

When you make a movie...or write a book...or draw a picture without thinking of your audience.  When you do it because it's inside you and you want to give it expression.
And the people are lovely.  Is it just because it was made in 1980 that the absense of media seems so strong?  They're just lovely people with personality.

This is possibly the worst acting from an entire cast in a single movie.  Lee Remick walks around in robotic motion and needs a beat down for the insults.  Dreyfuss' parents should have thrown him out from the basement years ago for over-acting more than usual.  Sam Wanamaker and his sweater on the shoulders, joint smoking, getting his mack on to weird music was just what we needed to push us over the edge into uncontrollable laughter.

It seems like most of the pianists I've talked to over the years have seen this and love to talk about it, especially the piano ""faking"", which is done so well, it actually fooled my piano teacher.  Unlike most other movies that show a well-known actor playing the piano from only the chest up, this one keeps the hands and body in full view during the crucial scenes, instead of cutting back and a forth to a close-up of a stand-in's hands.  Richard and Amy reportedly spent several months learning how to fake the moves required to make the piano playing look believable, and the results are astounding. The actual piano on the soundtrack was recorded by others, but you'd never know it just from watching the movie.  The story line is very touching and has many moments that ring true, especially the portrayal of what we have to give up for the sake of our art.
This is the movie that I have watched over the years when I don't feel like practicing, or when I need to be inspired to keep pushing ahead at the keyboard.

Some political intrique involving a young Russian pianist gives the competitors some down time and the young couple makes the most of it.  Okay, so the romance is sappy, I watch this movie for the music.  Paul plays Beethoven's ""Emperor"" Piano Concerto (No. 5 for those who need the number), while Heidi tackles Prokofiev's Piano Concerto No. 3.  This is one of those films where you go out and track down the complete piano concertos the first chance you get (For the record, Chester B. Swiatkowski is the actual pianist for the ""Emperor"" while Daniel Pollack plays the Prokofiev).  The supporting performances by Lee Remick as Heidi's teacher Greta Vandemann, and Sam Wanamaker as temperamental conductor Andrew Erskine are both quite excellent.  I can never forget Remick's great line to Erskine: ""It costs extra to carve schmuck on a tombstone, but you would be worth the expense.""  Besides, nobody can arch an eyebrow like Lee Remick.  The other competitors in the finals are Jerry DiSalvo (Joseph Cali), who is playing the rags to riches angle, Michael Humphries (Ty Henderson), who already has the money, poor little Russian girl Tatjana Baronov (Vicki Kriegler), and the silent Adam Stern (Mark Landau).

The Competition has always been one of my favorite movies - combining classical piano concertos, somewhat-sappy-yet-realistic romance, and a young sexy Richard Dreyfuss (seriously, I love him, esp. his early work, swoon) as an abrasive yet charasmatic concert pianist.
This is one of the few movies I can quote the dialogue from in everyday conversation, love it.",995673600,16,483,4.902439024390244

7824699,5,6302363098,"Exceptional film, in regard to script, acting, music (piano playing), romance and real issues in male/female relationships - especially when both genders excel in the same art form or skill. In this case, the two young pianists meet at a national competition - the male is the most competitive and the female the most talented. How can their relationship develop and survive under such circumstances?

I loved this film when I first saw it at least 30 years ago and still love it today.......I doubt if it will ever be dated. And there are a few classic scenes (such a the throwing-the-purse in the air later in the film) that are unforgettable. Dreyfuss and Irving are a delight.",1512259200,,680,4.762711864406779
