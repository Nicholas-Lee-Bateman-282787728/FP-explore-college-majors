8039997,1,B00067Z2JQ,"For people that don't have a taste for B movies, the idea of collecting bad movies doesn't make any sense. I enjoy seeing the final product, a labor of love, which is ultimately a failure in every aspect. Poor acting, writing, cinematography, and directing through some sort of bizarre math actually add up to something worth watching. It's endearing to see the complete lack of talent put forth so much effort.

And so it becomes a quest to find the WORST movie.

This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I am not expecting to find a movie worse than this. My quest is over.

Unfortunately, there was no weird math to save this movie. It just completely failed to entertain in every aspect, but it didn't feel like anyone put the love into it to make it work. I watched it once and doubt I'll watch it again.",1167782400,2,810,4.386666666666667
8039998,1,B00067Z2JQ,"I am a fan of horror movies.  I really enjoy low budget B movies for the laughs, and the ingenuity of the low cost special effects.  Also, I think that B movies have some really good story lines.  Thats what I thought about ""Not Dead Enough"", it had the potential to bea decent B movie based on the story line.  It has all the makings of a decent haunted house horror.  Sadly, this movie fails at every turn.  I watched the first 15 minutes waiting for something to happen, then fast forwarded for the next 25 minutes of the movie before turning it off.  The setting of this movie appears to be an impoverished mexican neighborhood in Los Angeles, which is not the typical location when you think of a haunted house.

The premise of the movie is that an escaped convict breaks into a house and kills everyone inside.  A baby in a cradle is pushed out the window while everyone else is being killed inside.  While this may seem somewhat significant, it appears to have no bearing on the outcome of the movie.

The primary character is a middle aged woman with no acting ability at all.  The only other character other than the mysterious killer is a young woman who offers to help the other woman move into her new house, which just so happens to be haunted from the murders that took place there 20 years prior.

Soon after the woman (she is not given a name in the film) finishes moving in, she starts having hallucinations about a killer, the same one who killed people in her house so long ago.  While she is somewhat startled, she doesn't seem to be very bothered by the visions, and only gets slightly irritated when her oranges get crushed while her back is turned (oh my, how suspenseful, smashed oranges) and shows almost no reaction when kitchen knives start flying around on their own.  The sound quality is abyssmal.  The cars on the street drown out the vocals, the musical score, if you can even call it that, sounds out of placeand is badly mixed.  The movie looks like it was probably filmed with a Sony hadycam, the editing is horrible, and the only visual effects are the ones built into the camera, i.e. light filters, negatives, echo effect and fade to black.

The acting is horrible.  I think the main character might have been the film makers mom, and the supporting cast was probably other people from the neighborhood.

I would give zero stars for the rating if I could.  Save your money, I wish I did, and I bought it used for $3.",1166054400,2,2454,4.445190156599552
