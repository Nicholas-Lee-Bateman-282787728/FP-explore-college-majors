8355059,3,B0027R2XRC,"Of the trilogy (so far), I only saw parts 2 and 3:
- You Changed my Life in a Moment (2009)
- It Takes a Man and a Woman (2013)

While both movies are soap operas drawn out over almost two hours with the same leading couple, they show obvious differences: You Changed my Life in a Moment shows the actors in responsible job positions, but they look and behave like teenagers and are barely credible - the cutesy, constantly shrieking Mrs Geronimo dispensing ""power hug"" after ""power hug"", and the immobile, stiff, shell-shocked Mr Cruz (reminding me of Shahid Kapoor in Bollywood's Jab We Met, 2007, playing another tranquilized teenage company boss). In the second half, the story sags, the ongoings in the industrial laundry plant feel at first interesting, but then unbelievable.

It Takes a Man and a Woman is the more credible, mature movie, but it still has lots of comedy - quite funny at times and with one tiny exception good clean family fun. The main actors Cruz and Geronimo now look like and act like young adults in appropriate job positions. Both play much more nuanced than before - Mrs Geronimo less shrill and doll-like, partly very feminine, bordering sensual; Mr Cruz more lively, grounded, less frozen. The story feels a little less contrived and a tad less soapy. The camera has a few good moments here too. There are also strong tear-jerking moments. Apart from the barely appealing New York images, this movie has less outdoor or real-life settings and mostly takes place in offices and homes.

You don't have to have seen You Changed my Life in order to enjoy It Takes a Man and a Woman, except for the latter movie's first five minutes - a nice play with expectations carried over from the previous story. You should only be aware that Cruz's and Geronimo's characters had been romantically involved at last sight. Seeing both movies in the intended order gives you a deeper knowledge of the families though.

Both movies don't feel very realistic, but rather like telenovelas, and mostly show off glitzy housing, offices, cars or motorcycles in the Philippines; the very occasional sight of a typical battered jeepney (street bus) almost disturbs the ultra-clean impression free of the usual Filipino moments (Mrs Geronimo's movie clan has a middle class appearance). In both movies, Sarah Geronimo sings the title song - it is more memorable and more often repeated in You Changed my Life, but in both songs Geronimao sounds more like an actress on a side job, not like the full-fledged singer she actually is.

I got my DVDs straight from a reputable mall shop in the Philippines, published by Star Home Video. I believe that I have original prints. You Changed my Life in a Moment appeared in 4:3 with very low image quality - muted colors, not exactly focussed, it felt like a bad pirate copy, very disappointing (especially as the cinematography intended to deliver some eye candy). It Takes a Man and a Woman then played in wide-screen with slightly better, but certainly not exciting image quality.

Both movies had good English subtitles and while the actors usually talk Tagalog, they talk English for maybe 10 percent of all dialogue. As extra content you do get the trailers, a video of the respective title song and a spot of behind the scenes and interviews; it is not very engaging and mostly in Tagalog without subtitles, but you do see the leading couple in interview and promotional  situations.",1390521600,2,3439,4.808798646362098
