I order a preowned one and when it came it looked almost brand new. The seller even put it in a brand new clam shell case.  When we played it for the kids it played with no problems what so ever, my coworker was so surprised that it was a used copy. The teacher was even excited to know that the sale of this VHS went to help sheltered animals.",1419897600,,489,4.030927835051546

7946589,5,B00005NBBN,"I thought that the vidio was great.  It teaches kids a little about the way that different religions spend the holiday season, and that they may know some kids that do celebrate those holidays.  It also teaches kids to bundle up to play out side, share with their friends, and have fun.",1004227200,6,286,4.480769230769231

They do this in a manner that is educational and fun.  My niece absolutely loves Blue and Steve!!  They've made an exceptional video about winter holidays.  Adults every where can enjoy this video too!,1002672000,5,326,4.962962962962963
