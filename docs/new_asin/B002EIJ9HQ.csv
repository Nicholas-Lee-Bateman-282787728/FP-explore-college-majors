3917660,4,B002EIJ9HQ,"The condition of the movie was great!! The package was sealed very good and no damage to the movie.
The movie itself had very good quality and no problems.",1315526400,,155,4.379310344827586
3917661,4,B002EIJ9HQ,"This is a concert from 1994,with bonus footage of Who's That Lady/ Shout from the 2000's. If you have the now out of print CD Isley's Live! from the 90's you have this concert on CD. While only Ron & Ernie are on the DVD cover, Marvin was still touring with the brothers, along with Ron's then Wife Angela Winbush, who sing a bit, and her then single Marvin Gaye remake. Lighting was not the best, so close the blinds. Ron's voice & Ernie's playing was in good shape. If you are an isley fan you will still enjoy.",1296604800,17,513,4.191919191919192

8367774,5,B002EIJ9HQ,I love the Isley Brothers. I think I have everything that they've ever produced. And this is just such a great album CD. If you love The Isley Brothers you can't go wrong with this,1463184000,,180,4.171428571428572
8367775,4,B002EIJ9HQ,"As good as this concert is, this is NOT the same as the excellent CD The Isley Brothers Live! released on Warner Brothers in 1993, although the main concert on this set was recorded only a year later. Missing are: ""Choosey Lover"", ""Groove With You"", ""Don't Say Goodnight"", ""Spend The Night (Ce Soir)"", ""Fight The Power"" and Ronnie's religious reworking of ""Make Me Say It Again."" Included instead are ""Summer Breeze"", insertions of Sly's ""Thank You Fa Lettin' Me Be Mice Elf"" and the JB's ""Doin' It To Death"" as well as an Angela Winbush solo on Marvin's ""Inner City Blues."" For some reason, the main concert is done twice, plus a bonus of the last two tracks done again from a 2003 concert. That said, Ronnie puts on a good show, along with Ernie and Marvin (it's about time he let Angela sing) - you will enjoy both the male and female dancers and this is the best you are going to get on DVD. The ""Summer Breeze"" concert video is also enjoyable (especially for ""Down Low"", the male dancer on ""Twist and Shout"" and Ron's comments before he does ""For The Love Of You"") but not as good as this! Well worth the investment!

The sound quality was very good, I was truly entertained.",1365638400,,118,4.173913043478261
8367781,5,B002EIJ9HQ,I'm a  very serious Isley Brothers fan and this DVD is what every fan should have in their collection. Ronald Isley sings all of his greatest hits in this DVD and makes you feel like actually being there. Everything about this DVD was to my satisfaction.,1365552000,,254,4.521739130434782
8367782,3,B002EIJ9HQ,I expected more however it's just ok I have only watched it once after buying it in my opinion it's over rated,1365552000,,110,4.045454545454546
8367783,4,B002EIJ9HQ,"I guess I should begin with saying that this is the best Isley Brothers DVD out there. So if you love The Isley Brothers then definitely grab this one.  I give it just under 4 stars. I don't know WHY there wouldn't be multiple DVD releases from some of their shows in the 1970's.  I hope this is somewhere in the works as I type this!  Anyway...one nice surprise that I got when I popped this in my TV was Marvin Isley on Bass (No love for Marvin on the cover!).  We get half of the Isley Brothers on this DVD...Ron (Vocals), Ernie (Guitar), and Marvin(Bass).  The footage was taken in 1994 at the North Sea Jazz Festival.  I know the Isleys were a ballad band to some extent but the show does get a little tiring in certain spots. The highlights are ""Here We Go Again"", ""Take Me To The Next Phase"", ""Footsteps In The Dark""/""Groove With You"", and ""That Lady"". I'm really missing the songs that jam like ""Fight The Power"", ""The Pride"", ""Live It Up"", ""Winner Takes All""?  Just Sayin!! Ernie and Marvin sound tight as hell, and Ron sounds pretty good considering it was already 1994 when this was recorded.",1330128000,6,1103,4.377450980392157
