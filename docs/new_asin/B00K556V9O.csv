UPDATE:  I lost my ""to see list"".

Salvo  (2013).

UPDATE:

Salvo  (2013) is a slow-moving and tedious film that doesn't amount to much.  It's long and pointless and won't give you much in return.",1430438400,,247,4.217391304347826
8655885,5,B00K556V9O,"I was scrolling through a foreign film list when I saw this movie. I watched the trailer on Youtube and purchased it right away.

Salvo is a hit man and while he is on a job he comes across Rita. Rita is blind, but almost from the moment Salvo enters her home she senses his presence. What follows is almost a game of hide and seek. We can see Rita moving through the house, becoming increasingly nervous, with Salvo occasionally moving into the frame as he watches her. Normally, I think many viewers would find this a little creepy, but the way it was filmed removed that feeling for me. It was almost like playing a game of chess, with every move carefully planned out to lead to a win.

A connection is formed between Salvo and Rita. It is something that can't quite be put into words, every viewer will have to make up their own minds about it. But this connection is what forms the foundation of this film. A lot of things happen that I won't ruin for anyone who hasn't watched it yet.

Very few words are spoken, the least of which is by Salvo. This is a movie that has long silences, but it feels natural and the actions and acting of the characters makes few words necessary.

Salvo stands apart for me from other films I have seen and it has become one of my favorites. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys getting out of the shallow end of the pool and into deeper waters.",1427328000,,1388,4.266159695817491
8655886,4,B00K556V9O,"SALVO as written and directed by Fabio Grassadonia and Antonio Piazza has won many awards. It is a lengthy (2 long hours) story (or view) of the life of a hit man and the reason it succeeds is the magnetic performance of Saleh Bakri (`The Band's Visit') who magnetizes the story with his penetrating gaze.

Salvo (Saleh Bakri) is a bodyguard and hit man for a Mafioso. After foiling an attack on his employer, Salvo hunts down the man who organized it - Renato - and encounters the man's blind sister, Rita (Sara Serraiocco). She causes Salvo to question himself and his existence. The camera focuses on close ups of Rita's face as she tries to disguise her fear by singing. Salvo performs the murder of Renato off screen while we see Rita's reaction. Salvo places his fingers over Rita's eyes and due to some sort of unexplained phenomena, cures her sight. She starts to see forms and shapes, but as the film goes on, her sight improves. Salvo buries Renato and keeps Rita in an empty factory for her security and the remainder of the film shows the transition of a solitary professional hitman to a man who becomes vulnerable to human connection, offering an allegory with the inexplicable restoration of Rita's sight.

The film is in Italian, is long, dark and very atmospheric. Dialogue is scarce but well chosen. This is a mood piece with a message and well worth waiting it out to understand that message. Grady Harp, December 14",1419033600,,1435,4.66798418972332
8655887,5,B00K556V9O,"I just pre-ordered this film after seeing it at the New Directors/New Films festival in March. It is so amazing that I wanted to own a physical copy as well. I don't have much to add a part from the fact that this is not only one of the best Italian films of the past 20 years, but it is also one of the best film of the year: it is so unique, original, engaging, well made that I have been recommending it to all of my friends. The film can be roughly divided in three parts: the first develops like a tense thriller, the second more like a drama and the third is a fine balance between a romance and a mafia film. All three fit together perfectly, reminding at times of the films of Jean-Pierre Melville and Sergio Leone.
Just a suggestion: try to watch it on the biggest screen and with the best audio system you can find, you will be amazed at the beauty of the cinematography in widescreen and at the sound design! Highly, highly recommended!",1419033600,,947,4.237569060773481
8655888,4,B00K556V9O,"Mancuso Salvo (Saleh Bakri) is a hired body guard and hit man for the Sicilian Mafia. There is a mob hit on his boss and he takes care of it, but being the professional type, who seems to `enjoy his work', he goes for the man who called the hit. Once at his home he encounters the man's blind sister - Rita (Sara Serraiocco). Part of the job is to leave no witnesses, so after doing a lengthy but effectively successful mob hit on the guy he goes to do `the cleaning up' - that's mob lingo for killing everything else that moves. The thing is in the short time he has spent with this girl she has had an effect on him.

What unfolds is a questioning of himself and also an awakening for Rita. The thing is there are rules about mob behaviour and the boss calls all the shots - quite literally; you can not therefore have some underling changing them to suit his own ends, and transgressions of the code never go unpunished.

This is a strange film to categorise; it starts as an action movie, then moves to a film about a one sided relationship and ultimately takes us on a journey you would never expect. The way the filming is done is to exemplify how the blind Rita `sees' the World and by doing so brings heightened fear and tension. What ramps up the atmosphere even more is the minimal dialogue; Salvo hardly says a word and there is virtually no music that I can recall.

It is a film that will probably have divided opinions and it is a slow reveal, but it pays dividends if you stay with it, a bit art house yes, a bit original yes and worth seeing? Well that is a definite yes.",1412985600,4,1587,4.19672131147541
8655889,4,B00K556V9O,"""Salvo"" (2013 release from Italy; 110 min.) brings the story of Salvo and Rita. As the movie opens, we find ourselves in the midst of a reckoning between rivalry Mafioso gangs in Palermo, Sicily. A silent, muscular type (whom we later learn is named Salvo) is sent to take out the mastermind behind the competing gang, Salvo enters the guy's house and instead runs into the guy's sister, Rita. As it turns out, Rita is blind, and a cat-and-mouse game begins as Salvo searches the house for the mastermind. To tell you more of the story would taint your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is the long feature debut of writers-directors Fabio Grassadonia and Antonio Piazza. And what an extraordinary debut it is! Not knowing much about this film going into it, I was expecting a crime caper. Sure, there are scenes that bring the mafia crime aspects to the front, but the movie later on becomes a study of the human condition, and hence a psychological portrait more than a crime thriller. The initial confrontation between Salvo and Rita is as nail-biting as it is unsettling at the same time. That scene takes a good 10-15 min. to play out and it is what sets this movie apart, period. Second, the acting performances are stellar throughout, none more so than Sara Serraiocco as Rita, in her first movie role ever (Serraiocco in real life is not blind, by the way). Check out the bonus materials for interviews with her and with the directors on how they shaped this role. Third, as always, the DVD comes with a bonus ""shortie"", and cleverly, Film Movement was able to get ""Rita"", the 2009 debut shortie (20 min.) from Grassadonia and Piazza, where they first introduced the blind girl Rita character (then played by another actress). Great bonus shortie!

This movie was the July, 2014 release in the on-going series of Film Movement's DVD-of-the-Month Club of foreign and indie movies, and the DVD will be released to the public at large in January, 2015 (but I wouldn't be surprised if ""Salvo"" shows up on Amazon Instant Video before then). If you are in the mood for something entirely different than the comic book action hero movie of the week that Hollywood keeps serving up endlessly this summer, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Salvo"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1406851200,,2344,4.742647058823529
