It was quite a pleasant surpise, an interesting ""family drama"" but with a number of very humorous moments (just like a reall family I guess). Very good acting by each of the 4 member cast (I admit I'm a fan of the actor who played Elliott) and great cinematography. Definitely worth a watch!",1386979200,26,351,4.333333333333333

6026705,2,B00FR83S18,"No reason why we should care much about these characters. The dying mother trying to fix things up before she departs is something of a cliche as is the relentlessly angry daughter. The transient encounter of the two men is hampered by mediocre acting and we are given so little information about their backgrounds that we are kept at a distance. The ending is fashionably unresolved.
I felt I had wasted my time.",1455580800,,413,4.671232876712328
6026706,5,B00FR83S18,"I am not a movie critic, nor do I have the training.
Many times at the Oscars I am totally wrong acordon&oacute; to judgement. However, I have seen not only Hollywood internacional my known for to the mainstream American demand. Unfortunately de have not been exposed to internatinal film industry.
We change channels if by luck there is one in Netflix or even HBO.

Cinema was not always an American top export, much before that was Argentina, Spain, Mexico, Germany, France, England. these moguls , these titants directors are mostly retired, have passed away. I have no clue if Germany's Fassbinder is alive, and the list goes on. 20 years ago Spain regain it's glory with movies directed by Almodovar.

The reason I spent the time in this preamble is to state what little I know of these appealing movies that would entice your thinking, make you laugh and most of all places your mind in a stage of chagelling all aspects. Brazil is another giant that I can't fail to mention.

There has been a truce between our mighty cinema industry, since other countries started using a small amount of spice of succesful USA.
Result: the US is starting to incorporate the European scripts slowly to the American market, and European movies are more commonly seen in the big screen.

i challenge you to watch this movie, it is not an Oscar material one, yet it will touch the humanity in all of us now, this very day.

Indeed a great teaching , a great message, a great movie and excellent acting.",1454630400,2,1490,4.650190114068441

6026718,5,B00FR83S18,"Richard LeMay's latest production and directorial feature and most brilliantly nuanced effort to date.  His second directed film 'Whirlwind' was a wonderfully insightful  and sexy gay-centric film of a systematic dismantling of a close-knit group of gay friends.  With 'Naked As We Came' its main plot is focused on the dynamics of a wealthy New York dying matriarch and her estranged family, and whose interaction between an attractive, mysterious hired caregiver and her handsome but aimless younger son (pictured) is the subplot.  Although its a methodical yet well-paced character study of a dysfunctional family, don't get your gay expectations up as with his previous feature.  Still, a Richard LeMay film does not disappoint with its visual guy-candy cast (Sorry...no frontals) as with its intriguing if not satisfying plot-line to its final ending twist.

Great characters, nice plot that drives the movie about relationships and a family that comes back together after a long separation. The two men in this movie looked so good together and played so well off of each other that you really believed the chemistry, and the scenes they shared were so convincing from the love making to the fighting.
The mother and daughter... what can't you say about them just magical every time they spoke it literally gave me chills.  While there are so many trashy and campy gay themed movies out there and so few good ones upon seeing this one I knew it was a rare gem.

When you watch this you will think about your family and parents and maybe what you should have said or maybe should say. It is thought provoking and heart wrenching, funny and sad.",1423180800,4,937,4.258426966292135

6026767,1,B00FR83S18,"A very stupid, plodding, heavy-handed, badly written, badly directed, VERY badly acted (especially the ""dying"" mother who looks like she could wrestle lions in a circus), extremely tiresome movie about extremely unpleasant spoiled people with way too much money and way WAY too much unnecessary drama. The mother is dying. So what? People die. People as obnoxious as this bunch should die a lot sooner.

For some perverted, homophobic reason, many gay reviewers of gay movies LOVE to declare that a gay movie is not ""really"" gay. This is one of those movies. It isn't really a gay movie.

Oh, yeah? When two of the four characters in a movie are gay men, and the ONLY sex in the movie is between those two men (who are - of COURSE! - hot and buff and West-Hollywood hairless and gorgeous), and the two women in the movie are ugly, strident, manipulative, shrieking, raging and/or whining, moaning b! itches... THAT'S not a gay movie? Why? Because the phrase ""eating out"" is not in the title?

6026771,3,B00FR83S18,"The movie revolves around a dying mother and her last opportunity to make atonement to her kids.

The acting was alright. The lead males are extremely beautiful.

The pace of the movie was mellow and slow but beautiful video work. The theme music is amazing.

The last twenty minutes or so is what really hurt the movie. I felt like Elliot was underdeveloped. It is like waiting for a train that never came. I think it would be nice if the director had given some dept to his story and background. His mother left him a note and said ""try"", but try what? How does that fit into the story at all when we literally don't know anything about him. Then there is Ted who seem sincere in the beginning until we realize his alternative motive of being there. I thought the whole deal with ""Infiltrating"" the family to write his book was uncalled for. It really killed it for me. On top of that, it makes you wonder if he ever had any feeling for Elliot or poor Elliot was just one of his experiment for writing. On top of that, he already have a Boyfriend who he has a photo of by his bed side while having sex with another man. Like seriously? Open relationship? I felt my stomach sank and got a bit sick at that. Now we don't know Ted either and his story. On top of that, the scene when Elliot discovered Ted's true motive, it was cut short so you never have an answer or how Elliot reacted to it which, once again take away his depth. When this mother left a note telling Ted to break off with Eric, he said ""no"" a d ask Elliot "" are we cool?"" like what? Are they 10 years old? Even though early on he seems like he want to make a commitment. It is frustrating. So the sister has a closure even if it seems rushed, the ending completely left the audience hanging with Elliot and Ted and whether what happen to them since it is completely vague. The last narration at the very end didn't answer any of the question either. I finished the movie feeling like someone promised me something for my birthday and never got it, then pretend they don't know anything - disappointment.

I go ahead and leave 3 stars because I enjoyed the acting and the casts effort along with beautiful video work. However, the story deserve maybe 2 stars.",1414368000,8,2227,4.295238095238095

Poor writing, underdeveloped characters and a cliche' story are the fundamental failings.  The dialog between characters isn't realistic and had no flow.  Even if you buy the premise this family is estranged, the conversations still sputter.  I'd rate the screenplay zero stars.

Each actor seemed to have a single emotion they could convey.  Allowing for the poor script doesn't redeem the performances.  I'd rate the acting two stars.

I cried, I laughed, I was immersed into the story.  That there was a gay component to the story is truly only secondary! (Exclamation used on purpose.)

My philosophy on life has been that in the last few moments of your life, you face the most challenging judge in the Universe about your life which you cannot deceive: you.  Here, we see one woman facing that demon, answering that she could have done better, and proffering the opportunity to her son & daughter to be their own personal best.  Each reaches their own personal resolution of varying degrees of satisfaction to the viewer, but that makes it all seem that much more real.

She is shrill and annoying and loud. You know she will be redeemed at the end but at various times you think she is coming around and then the harpy strikes again, I'm bored with this type. The other 3 actors are superb. The story really is about ""can't we all just get along"". It was a good film don't get me wrong.

They are one dimensional, reductionist characters, defined by sex.  And one of them already has a boyfriend, but ""it's open.""  Know what would have been great?  If the guy with a boyfriend was faithful.  That's depth.  But the stereotypes march on, without anyone questioning these portrayals of gay men as one-dimensional - defined by sex.

A lot of the script deals with releasing regret and shame, and once again, I've had my share of both. It was a little too short, because it concluded without complete resolution, especially with Elliot. Like so many comments, I too would like to see more of Rue McWilliamson, she was very good for what I'm assuming as a newcomer. Personally, I think if done right, independant and/or low budget films can work better, check this out, you may be in for a major treat!",1402358400,5,593,4.5

Ryan Vigilant seems to win you over merely by his expression and minimal dialogue, kind of like Ryan Gosling does.  I'm not trying to compare the two other than to say that Vigilant plays his role well in that way, just by how his expression compliments his part.  He is also quite a beautiful man.

What the mother wrought with her children was most outwardly obvious with the daughter.  Karmine Alers successfully brings this kind of tension to the story.  I'm glad I streamed this one.  Good Indie movie.",1402012800,7,550,4.65625

The emotional roller coaster we go through when a parent is about to pass is one of the worst challenges in life and you hit the realism so close to home with this production.

You can almost spin off a NAWC 2 with the on again off again relationship of Ted and Elliot and interweave the marital struggles of Laura. Kudos and hats off to you and what you brought to us in this movie.",1400803200,3,578,4.392523364485982

From the opening shots you are taken into the mind and heart of what it means to be gay and yet unable to commit to a relationship because of impatience. It's about growth and allowing yourself to understand what love is underneath the outer shell of not really caring which way the waters of life carry you.  Supporting the story is the dying mother and controlling sister, each trying to leave a message for the younger brother, yet the outsider, who's in his own relationship vortex, underestimates his effect in awaking each member of the family to see life and death in a new light.  Ryan Vigilant, the brother, is much better than I expected, coming from the fishbowl of modeling. He has enormous potential as an actor.",1400198400,4,886,4.703225806451613

I think it is head and shoulders above a lot of other content in the genre, but it's actually a little boring and unclear and in the end a wee bit trite. Perhaps other reviews are relative to the medium/content/genre which could elevate the experience of this film only in comparison to other related content out there.  Perhaps they're based on cliff notes cause there's a lot of extrapolation that didn't play the same for me as has been cited. (e.g. ""Mom wants to make amends."" uhm, the mom I saw was more about seeing that things were what they were, and then there's the here and now. What I saw was a lot of contradiction and contrivance and more community theater quality acting. Benjamin Weaver is as cute as he can be, but he wasn't the actor for the role of Ted. His lack of depth and ability to play subtext made his character's interplay with the others, and clumsy alternative motives, ring contrived and out of place.",1393200000,8,1006,4.497267759562842

6026905,4,B00FR83S18,"After first seeing this online and trying to figure out the comments at the very end, I thought that the lead male character was horrible. Except for 1 kitchen scene where he argues with his sister I thought his expressionless, staring off into space, face was him just trying to get through his part by reading the lines. After some self reflection (during a good deal of walking in the Arizona sun), I realized he played his part to a tee. He is a man who reacts to, instead of living, life. A man who has no idea who he is (except gay) or what he wants. His is the one character that does NOT grow from the experience of his mothers impending death.

This is the part of the movie that some other reviewers are labeling as a European or French ending.  Although the mother and daughter have grown from their mistakes, it is unclear if the son remains stuck or is ready to accept life and move on. The DVD cover perfectly relays his almost catatonic, depression state. He has experienced loss and grief before through a no-good father and several failed relationships but no specific event is presented. His experiences here are just more parts of life that he seems unable to deal with. In that respect the movie fails to show us why he is actually this way. The mothers, the daughters and even the mothers housekeepers nakedness is all revealed but we do not fully see where the son is actually coming to a place or a point where he feels totally stripped of all he may have hoped life would be. The mother and daughter both had concrete regrets but I am left wondering how the son became so ambivalent toward life itself. At some point in his life was he led to believe that life is a bed of roses? Or, is he just too pie-in-the-sky romantic?

Because I find it so easy to identify much of my past with him, I think his acting was just as spot-on as all other characters but I must deduct 1 star because I feel that his character could have been further developed UNLESS it was the writer/directors purpose to leave us wondering what on earth made this man want to remain a boy.",1390694400,29,2083,4.36340206185567

I thought that the actors were superb and believable.  It was very worth watching it.

I was put-off by Ted's real reason for being there. I began to wonder if his interest in Eliott weren't suspect and I questioned his earlier interactions with Eliott. I believed that Ted really cared about the mother and vice-versa but his motives were cast into doubt. His character, a bit soured. Ted told Eliott his mom had discussed his failed relationships and then kept pointing out that she ""wanted this"".... but Ted doesn't even know that he wants it. So why talk about how much the mom wants it? It was as if there was an initial script and then stuff added in to make it more interesting -- none of it coming together quite right. I could've done without the whole senator storyline.

This movie is about Life and Dearh..living and dying. .extremely well written and acted. .A real must to see and an experience to share with a best friend. .remember it's an adult move. .,1389398400,2,295,4.103448275862069
6026929,5,B00FR83S18,"The acting is superb and the message powerful.  Loneliness sometimes can be transcended and clarity about your life is possible, especially at the end.  Narcissists do a lot of permanent damage to their children, who are trapped in the parent's mirroring.  Lily sees only herself until Ted, the handsome young author, shows up to listen to her story.  Then he, like the Greek god Hermes, becomes the guide of the souls facilitating a final few days with her children.  That's when Elliot and his sister get the apologies they always needed.  This movie demonstrates the psychological truth that there is no such thing as time in the unconscious.  Wounds can always be healed, if we are open to healing ourselves by facing the truth.",1389312000,6,732,4.854838709677419
6026930,4,B00FR83S18,"This film hits all its marks successfully. I would place it in the genre of ""American family in crisis,"" i.e., dysfunctional--and the chickens of that dysfunction finally come home to roost--deal with 'em.  Just when you think there may be a glimmer of light for our protagonist, Elliott, a rather shocking denouement occurs. Though somewhat hackneyed in regards to the basis of the core story, the fine acting minimizes this fact and of course, it doesn't hurt that the two male leads are 11's on the hunk-o-meter scale of 1-10. The ending doesn't fail in hitting the right mark.  We are left with a very satisfying feeling that though things do not turn-out as our fantasy mind would want, the characters do learn and grow a little through their respective experiences and that's a Hollywood ending I can live with.",1389139200,23,817,4.828571428571428

6026932,5,B00FR83S18,"Wow, this movie blew me away. The acting was superb. Heavy subject mater. And I got caught right in the middle of it. The chemistry between Eliot and Ted was, without trying to sound immature, hot.
I found myself smiling.
If this movie doesn't jerk a tear out of you, then I don't know what will. It was very moving. I felt myself longing to reach into the screen and just hug these characters. They were so beliveable. Without giving away any of the story line or spoilers I secretly hope that Ted eventually follows the advice written on the card just for him.

While all of the actors were good, it was the actress who played the mother who elevated the film from being just good to being excellent.  And it didn't hurt to have a wonderful script.

6026961,4,B00FR83S18,"Nice production values and lovely New England setting. Terrific, realistic performance from Lue McWilliams. I'd like to see her in something else. Breath-taking acapella singing by the very pretty Karmie Alers. Ryan Vigilant is beautiful to look at. Benjamin Weaver, in his first film role, smoldered and delivered the second strongest performance in the film. Some aspects of the screenplay were beautifully written, while others just left me hanging with questions. For example, the deceased father was Puerto Rican and the soon-to-be-deceased mother was Anglo. This fact was mentioned briefly, in passing even, late in the film; yet, from the first scene I wondered, ""Where did this woman get these Latin-looking, gorgeous adult children?""  Further, the film's ending left lingering questions and felt very French.",1388102400,34,817,5.536

One way I evaluate a movie is how many times I check the clock or how much time is left in the movie.  I don't remember ever checking.  The actors were very convincing characters and well played and they were helped by well written dialog.  No scene seemed faked.  I was pretty much glued to the screen because I didn't want to miss any subtleties.  I am both frustrated and realistic with the ending.  I won't say more so I don't ruin it for others but the ending is good.  I recommend this movie.",1500163200,,577,4.229357798165138
