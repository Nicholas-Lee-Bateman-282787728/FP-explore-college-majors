7875571,5,6304618050,"This video was the first belly dance video I ever bought, and it inspired me to persist in my dance classes and practice at home. It is very inspiring to see how a professional dancer builds an artistic whole out of bits we learn in class. I know that this video is old and Suhaila's dance style has changed completely since then, but for me this tape has a sentimental value! I loved the costumes, the way shimmies were incorporated in Suhaila's dance, even though longer shimmy sections look too static to me. I liked the first set with sheer curtains, even though the space is clearly small, it looked like real theater.",1111622400,2,623,4.522123893805309
7875572,5,6304618050,"A Fantastic Bellydance Performance Video. Sultry, Exotic, Smoking with Energy and Artistry. Definitely Today's Choice ... if you only can pick ONE Contemporary Bellydance Video to own...it is this one!
Contains 2 sets of dances, each in 3 parts & both opening with a short veil segment. In the 1st, Suhaila appears in the black & gold costume shown on the cover whilst the second sees a costume switch to pale pink & pearls. Another Salimpour trademark ... beautiful, & stylish costumes with an edge.
Dance-wise, the technique is sharp & flawless. But it stands out above other dance videos in the Passion & Inspiration ...almost Spiritual at times ...Now  THIS is what music interpretation & layering is all about. Watch it again & again & you'll see what I mean. Suhaila is totally immersed in the Music & is not just performing a choreographed routine.
The  Guitar  Taksim (slow improvisation) is awesome & Suhaila's movements illustrate every beat, strum & vibration to perfection. And it is such a beautiful sight.
Hey don't take my word for it ... Go check it out! You won't be disappointed.",1066867200,18,1097,4.855614973262032
7875573,3,6304618050,"I would have given this one 3 & 1/2 stars if I could. This is one of at least 4 performance videos Suahila has produced.  ""Suhaila Dances for the Sultan"" is the other one I have seen & these 2 are ok performance video to watch.  The reason I liked the former video a bit better was because of the more traditional music she chose to use. The music on ""Unveiled"" has some  synth so it sounds more modern and the use of a guitar in the solo was interesting.  In this video, she dances to 2 complete choreographies, each comprised of 3 parts.  The cover box is a bit misleading as she does not use zills while dancing in this one.  This video was much better lighted than ""Sultan"", but in the first part, I still found it a bit too dark, and the camera angles above her head made it a bit hard to see her whole body, I was frustrated that her lower legs & especially feet were not shown much, as I think its important to see the legs/feet in some dances.  It was easier to see her in the second segment, which showcases nice columns & her light-colored costume.  Her stomach undulations/isolations are excellent& I liked her choreography.  I have purchased several tapes on oriental dancing, instructional & performance, & am glad I bought this one, I just wish the prices on belly-dance tapes in general weren't so high.  I am glad I bought this tape at a discount price because its only 40 min. long.  Another thing I noticed, the label on the tape itself says ""Unvield"", but that will not affect anyone's viewing pleasure. I really would like this to be on DVD!",997920000,25,1561,4.348275862068966

7875575,5,6304618050,"Suhaila is a very beautiful, talented and sexy lady. She does some amazing things with her tummy on this video. I find her dancing to be quite hypnotic, and am particularly fond of watching her dance after I've had a spliff or two. Yes, I am smitten by the woman and would dearly love to suck her toes!",989798400,5,302,4.224137931034483
