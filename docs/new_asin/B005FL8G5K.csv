But, don't get me wrong it is not horrible either. If you are a fan of his work try 28 days later or Sunshine, 2 of his best.",1320105600,,261,3.8518518518518516
4681555,5,B005FL8G5K,This was a very good movie.  I have seen the trailer and people claim that it tells to much of the movie.  I would say no.  There is so much more to the movie than the trailer shows. Didn't end like I was expecting. Cillian Murphy and Jamie Bell are excellent actors - I am a big fan of their work.  Their performances were excellent.  Thandie Newton did a great job as well. I would high recommend this movie.  I am buying the DVD when it comes out.,1319500800,,450,4.056818181818182
4681556,3,B005FL8G5K,"Sadly this was kind of a disappointment. The actors were good, I wanted to like it but the characters just lacked common sense/any self preservation instincts.

********** spoilers**********

1) Your alone on the island with your husband, suddenly a man you do not know staggers toward your home and your first instinct is to run towards him, really? Were they expecting him to be a girl scout selling thin mint cookies?

2) Lets say they were kind and didn't want to see someone die when they could have done something, fine. But cheese on a cracker shouldn't you at least check to see if the guy is carrying before you bring him into your home/ leave your wife alone with the guy? Sure he's passed out but funny thing about that is people wake up. He is a complete stranger and help is at least a couple of hours away and I'm not sure how much help a elderly man will be of, perhaps to up the body count, brilliant!

3) Ok, lets give them some points they found and took his gun before he woke up.
Oh wait,scratch that Martin gave it back after hearing some story of how there's people on the island, people he didn't actually see. Why on earth would you give someone that power specially after that incident were Jake practically chocked him.

4) There's a possible mad man in your home (the house your vacationing in), who wants to board up the house trapping you inside and although he gives you the chance to leave you chose to stay. If that's your choice you have to play along not switch between playing nice and antagonizing the guy. The last thing you want to do is anger someone who might be dangerous.

5) Jake wasn't lying. Well kind of, there really was a virus just not in the air but in him. After seeing this for yourself and getting a confession (which of course could have been all lies) you choose to shoot Jake and call in for the 'antidote'. If there actually were an antidote wouldn't they have used it on Jake their human lab rat after seeing the viruses effect? Then again a shot to the head seems much nicer than spewing up blood while convulsing for who knows how long.

6) This isn't an end of the world kind of scenario where if one gets the disease they must be put down in order to keep the few others safe. Wouldn't it have been best to quarantine the infected and wait to see if anyone makes it out alive? Though they could just be carriers, like Jake who have no symptoms yet are still highly contagious. Also, just because you are exposed doesn't mean you are infected perhaps there is something in that persons blood that makes them immune to it. Point being isn't it best to find a cure when who knows how many people have been exposed and are not coming forward?",1319241600,8,2700,4.366533864541832
4681557,2,B005FL8G5K,"Martin (Cillian Murphy) and Kate (Thandie Newton) are a married couple who go off and live on an island. She had a stillborn and the day after she came out of the hospital her husband was at work. In her blog she has has a secret of her own she can't tell Martin (one that isn't worth waiting for). The house is huge and they have plenty of food and even electricity from a finicky basement generator and Internet access. Kate is distant and aloof from the start as Martin is the more likeable of the characters.

Kate retreats to the bath and doesn't allow her husband to see her naked, as she appears extremely disturbed, blaming Martin for everything. Then suddenly a man in military fatigues, sinisterly armed with a pistol shows up on the island and passes out from his head trauma. Jack (Jamie Bell) the injured man recovers and informs Martin there is a deadly airborne virus killing off the world's population and is headed ""our way."" He wants to seal up the house which is on a cold remote island.

The couple doubts Jack's story but have no way to verify it or leave the island. They are prisoners in their own house in a slow developing home invasion film. Twist at the end makes the whole film a waste of time.

4681562,4,B005FL8G5K,"Trying to resist the appeal of this movie is like trying to row against the current in a canoe with an oar consisting of a dead lynx. You're struggling and exerting and not gaining any ground and you peer at the lynx waterlogged ears with maggots crawling out of it and finally decide to drop your carrion-oar and let the miraculous innovation of the film dash the brains of your apprehension out on the rocks so that you might delight in the most joyous of movies.

 When Jamie Bell comes slithering onto ""We're trying to piece back together our shipwreck of a relationship after losing a child"" Island, the couple living upon it are dealt quite the surprise,as they were planning on bickering and being bored on an island that barely has power and is about as thrilling as a vinyl listening of Bobby Brown b-sides from 1988. It seems that Jack(Jamie Bell)is in the military and has insider info about a contagious disease that is spreading like the popularity of texting while ignoring everything else that does exist.

 From here on out the characters are thrown into chaos and panic as Jack makes the situation worse with generally creepy behavior and a disposition which could only be described as like that of the old creepy elderly guy in the Friday The 13th movies that would constantly warn various teenagers about to be killed that ""YOU'RE ALL DOOMED"" !!

The plot of the movie is a fresh one in my opinion and it held my interest throughout. The ending was satisfying,though not as satisfying as if i were to be given the power to take cellphone technology away from the human race never to be returned(Yes,i am THAT diabolical).

So the next time you feel like livening up your day,don't eat a foot long sub out of the arm-hole in your winter coat,watch ""Retreat"" upon the most DVD of formats !!",1449273600,,1807,4.613707165109035

4681566,4,B005FL8G5K,"Nice slow moving thriller.  I like the actor Cillian Murphy a lot and I know that when he is a in a movie it's going to be a bit dark. his characters are going to have major issues and it is going to be a really good creepy movie.  He has these kind of mysterious good looks half menacing half handsome and he never fails to deliver on a performance.  Here he plays a husband who along with his wife goes to an older cottage on a remote island to try and get their marriage back on track.  He wife has lost a child and they refuse to talk much and the cottage and island seem to be a good remote re starting point until a stranger comes to them from out of nowhere.
Jamie Bell plays a stranger who has washed ashore on the island bloody and battered and quite paranoid... and to say much more would spoil what it to come.

This was a very good movie somewhat slow at times, it kind of reminded me of say Dead Calm on land maybe with a dash of 28 days later added in for good measure. All 3 leads hold their own in a game of cat and mouse and it has ending to wrap things up.  I remember seeing previews for this movie and it then disappeared and when I stumbled on it here I knew I had to watch it and am glad I did.",1441929600,2,1216,3.8830645161290325

Decent acting, slow build... but ultimately just a boring ride. The isolation and beauty of this setting were great backdrops for what could have been an interested slow-build, psychological thriller.

I think, had they cut perhaps 20 minutes from this one, it could have still kept the slow build and the suspense. I'm a huge Cilian Murphy fan, but this one was ultimately just a tedious grind with no real payoff at the end.",1424563200,3,441,4.7894736842105265
4681578,3,B005FL8G5K,"Retreat is one of those rare instances, of a film that is slow moving, with a simple story, but strangely fascinating. Films like this are completely reliant on the cast and most times simply don't work, but for some reason, I was really into Retreat and had to know if it was going to end the way I thought it would. As I said, the story isn't that unique, as it features a young couple, who try to reconnect on a secluded island off the cost of England. The island is a rich persons retreat and features one large cottage, that is occupied by one couple at a time. Martin and Kate think that it will be the perfect spot to reconnect, after the recent loss of a child, but the ideal retreat, soon becomes a hell on earth. A member of the army, a man named Jack (Jamie Bell) shows up in bad shape. When he wakes up, Jack informs the couple that a virus has taken hold over the mainland and if they leave the cottage, they could catch it. At first the couple goes along with Jack, but as his behavior becomes more irrational, the couple starts to question weather or not he's actually telling the truth. When you break the film down, it's three people in a cottage on an island, which doesn't sound very interesting, and the only reason this film works is Jamie Bell. The young star who got his start in Billy Elliott almost 15 years ago, has become a modern day Da Vinci in Hollywood, as he is seemingly everywhere and takes on all kinds of roles. Bell is as much an enigma as this film, as the last film I saw him in was some comedy, that was so bad I turned it off. A few months later, he's in this film and outshines everyone. If it wasn't for Bell's character and the fascination in finding out, what's in his head, this a film that would have gone nowhere. Jamie Bell is the key and really does give one of his best performances. Looking back and thinking about this film, it really wasn't anything special, except for one actor who makes all the difference. If you're into great performances, then Retreat is for you, but if you're more into the story then you might want to skip this one.",1415577600,,2095,4.266331658291457
4681579,5,B005FL8G5K,"I really enjoyed this film. Cillian Murphy is one of my favorite actors, and he did a good job in this role. Cillian plays Martin Kennedy, who his married to Kate Kennedy, played by Thandie Newton. They seclude themselves on an island retreat, where they are the only occupants, to try to get the spark back in their marriage after suffering from a miscarriage. Things take a turn for the worse when it is discovered that they are not alone on the island after all with a stranger they feel they cannot trust.  It has suspense, action, heartbreak, and touching scenes between Cillian and Thandie. The ending is shocking and very heartbreaking at the same time. It will make you wonder about the ways of the world. If you like a good suspense movie, I say give this one a try. I liked it.",1410739200,,787,4.465277777777778

4681581,5,B005FL8G5K,"One of the best movies I never heard about. Sure it's low budget, small cast, single setting ... but quite a mind-boggler.  Wonderfully acted, the cast gives nothing away as the puzzle unfolds.  Jamie Bell delivers a frighteningly intense portrayal of an injured military man whose true status is completely unknown.  Is he a deserter, a saviour, a lunatic, a protector, a captor, a liar, a killer, or the bearer of an apocalyptic truth?  And how will these troubled and isolated people survive their encounter with him, and the end of their world as they know it.",1393027200,,564,4.783505154639175

This is where the action and twists get a hold of you and don't let go until you are gasping at the end of this film. ""Retreat"" is a must-see. It is thought-provoking, interesting, upsetting, and you will not forget the ending of this movie!",1385164800,,596,4.427272727272728
4681584,5,B005FL8G5K,Great movie if you like watching thrillers.  It keeps you at the edge of your seat.  Overall rating is good.,1379808000,,108,4.35
4681585,3,B005FL8G5K,"The two protagonists in this movie, the couple we're supposed to care about, are so gay and make such stupid decisions that it's hard to have any positive feelings toward them. That's especially true with the guy, named Martin. Most of the dumb decisions him and his girlfriend make have to do with guns, but what he does at about the halfway point is so idiotic that I started to hope for his death. Is that to say that brainless cowards deserve to die? Not necessarily. It's just that I didn't want to look at his face anymore.

The girl, played by Thandie Newton, is actually kind of cute. A few deliberate body shots even give her a sexual allure. I was hoping for a rape scene. But her looks aren't attractive enough to make-up for such a silly story. The underlying premise, which has to do with a deadly disease and a bad guy, her potential rapist and Martin's potential killer, could've worked. But screen-shouting suspense can only go so far in a movie in which the characters are so stupid when it comes to what to do and what not to do with a gun.

4681586,5,B005FL8G5K,"I've always enjoyed U.K. movies (except the comedies).  Jamie Bell is my favorite male actor.  I have at least five movies that he has participated in and have viewed them all multiple times.  But ""Retreat"" I've watched many times above the rest.  This psychological thriller is handled in the way that the Brit's seem to truly be able to.  When I saw it I felt as if I was in the island cottage looking at three common people and their subtle, everyday expressions toward one another.  Even the cottage, like the acting, was nice and yet not over stated.  We are introduced to Kate and Martin, a married couple who retreat (yes, retreat) from the mainland to resolve their marriage issues.  Nothing all to dramatic and even boringly necessary.  But everything soon starts to come to life with the arrival of Jack, a boat wrecked, injured, army private carrying a loaded pistol.  Shock!  Horror!  This was my reaction to Kate and Martin's overboard (no pun intended) fear of a military man with a weapon.  And as one who has assisted people with injuries, I was even more horrified these two vacationers didn't clean the blood from Jack's face due to his head wound.  I guess they were afraid of a lawsuit. (Like I stated at the beginning, I don't enjoy British comedy)  However, set these acts aside, this film starts to grip your attention with it's pressure cooking tension between the close quartered, cottage dwellers, who board themselves inside.  This is done to ""protect"" them from the dying world outside.  What really kept me with movie was in the challenge in figuring out who the villain and the hero was.  It isn't black and white as you may at first believe. And though seemingly drab, at first, the motives of the imprisoned, cottage lot fire up with clashing colors.  There's definite pas-
sion and sorrow expressed by two colliding characters, but Jamie Bell wins all in these categories.

While I don't make it a habit in watching R-rated flix, I've made an exception, as an adult, with this one.  Other than the two ""horrifying"" reactions that I listed prior in this review, none of the language or violence seemed to be gratuitous. (Far less than
many PG-13's)  Overall, this is a fantastic psychological thriller.  I do recommend it to all adult movie lovers who think and feel.",1373328000,2,2299,4.73551637279597

4681590,3,B005FL8G5K,"OK almost thriller. I think this was a great premise for a thriller. However, it is unbelievable that someone that contagious could not have spread his infection prior to getting to the island. I mean, the husband became infected so quickly! But, wasn't the wife exposed to the virus also? Maybe it was a slower process. Would have been nice to see how everything developed prior to getting to the island only to then find out on the news about a virus. Hmm...go figure! Watch when you have nothing else on. And keep an open mind that it's just entertainment!",1340150400,,559,4.6
4681591,2,B005FL8G5K,"A young couple with marital issues tries to reconnect, ""retreating"" to a secluded island. They're alone together...until a bloody stranger arrives. He brings news of a pandemic, but can he be trusted? Can the young couple work together and decide what to do? Psychological thrillers can be taut and exciting. This one is sloppy, and rapidly devolves into a lot of shouting, and not much else. Your hand might tighten briefly on a chair arm, and then everyone will start shouting again. Maybe you'll shout, too, and throw some popcorn at the screen. ""Just kill 'em already!"" You might shout that, with no particular enthusiasm, because you just won't care. You'll probably have worked out every possible resolution already, with all the time you've had to twiddle your thumbs, and not one of them is particularly interesting. So ultimately, when the plot is thoroughly spooled out and you're not in any way surprised or exhilarated, you'll get up from the chair feeling cheated. This is just another of those dull nihilistic stories. It breaks no new ground, and it doesn't break old ground in any new or surprising ways. Even the couple's tedious issues aren't addressed at any great length, or resolved with any degree of depth. Not to be too cynical here, but this film seems engineered to offer psychology for the ladies, and action for the menfolk. A perfect date movie, the movie producers probably thought, although it doesn't succeed on either score.

The cruelest part is that you, like me, might be lured into this tedious misadventure by the name Cillian Murphy. He plays the male lead. He was also the male lead in a far better film, Danny Boyle's extraordinary ""28 Days Later."" Here he is, facing pandemic again. Could this film be just what you've been waiting for? A rematch between this scrawny innocent and infection, and man's inhumanity to man? The cover art of the ""Retreat"" dvd seems to suggest it, even lifting the biohazard symbol that graced the ""28 Days"" artwork. But just as Dan Quayle was no Jack Kennedy, not by a long shot, this film should not be confused with superior ones. There's a reason why you don't remember that this film was even in theaters.

4681593,4,B005FL8G5K,"The reason for the poor reviews on this movie probably stems from the fact that it exists as a bit of an anachronism in today's movie market.  This is a genuine suspense film in an action film world.  Suspense films just aren't really made anymore and today's 20-somethings just don't understand them.

Suspense is action for the more intellectual viewer who doesn't need giant explosions, gunfights and car chases to realize that something is, in fact, happening.  The entire film here uses one location... yep, count 'em up - one; unless you count the boat as a separate location.  Also there are only 5 characters, 2 of whom barely appear on screen.  So I can understand if the casual movie goer feels this is a slow film, but it is anything but slow.  The relationship between the married couple is continuously developed throughout the movie as a constant source of tension, and the nature of the antagonist is constantly turning down some new path.  You never know until the final moment what has really been going on the whole time; that's what suspense is all about.

This movie is worthy of quite a few of Alfred Hitchcock's second-rate movies, which is to say, it falls just short of brilliance.

If you enjoy Hitchcock, you'll enjoy this film.

The couple doubts Jack's story but have no way to verify it or leave the island. They are prisoners in their own house in a slow developing home invasion film. Twist at the end makes the whole film a waste of time.

4681599,5,B005FL8G5K,This movie had a very interesting plot line.  The behavior of all the characters was believable and did not lead you too far in any direction.  It's definitely worth watching!,1330819200,,175,4.8
4681600,3,B005FL8G5K,"You already know the plot. A couple with marriage problems goes to an island retreat, finds a bloodied stranger outside their cabin, and take him in. They find he has a gun. He wakes up, claiming the whole outside world's in the grip of a pandemic, and proceeds to board up the house.

Is he lying? Is he a killer? What to do, what to do? If you're not too claustrophobic, sit tight ... most of the movie occurs in the house. It's tense, and you'll be trying to guess what's happening. Did he really see someone? Or is it a ploy? What's going on with the CB radio?

In the end, there are some surprises, especially in our estimation of the intruder.

I wouldn't call this a ""feel-good"" movie, but if this sounds OK to you, and you don't mind squirming for an hour or so, it's worth a watch.",1330646400,2,790,4.218543046357616
4681601,3,B005FL8G5K,"A mostly typical hostage scenario where a couple going on a reconciliation retreat to a remote island home in Wales find a soldier unconscious on a nearby beach. They take him in and he takes the house over (has a gun of course) by insisting that the couple board themselves inside in order to be protected, from what he says, an airborne virus spreading around the world. The couple has no way to verify what he is saying and thus the couple (therefore the viewers) question the soldier's credibility. The husband, as is often the case in these scenarios, is weaker and more submissive than the female. This leads to the major weakness in the story (seems to be a standard characterization for these types of movies) which is the series of dumb decisions the hostage couple make throughout the movie. I sometimes think it's part of the script to engage the viewing audience into the ""How dumb can you be?"" hook.

Bell portrayed his soldier character well while Newton and Murphy seemed too over the top, not-believable, in their portrayals of the couple. The ending had a nice twist, although, it too suffered from believability. Yes, it's just a movie but you want storyline consistency.

Caution, tint of spoiler: You have a real couple with real marital issues at a real country estate. Yet, part of an over-the-top fantastical military conspiracy??",1330560000,5,1353,4.827586206896552
4681602,3,B005FL8G5K,"There's a lot of potential in RETREAT, a moody thriller set on a Welsh island.  Essentially a three character drama, the movie moves very slow before reaching an unexpected climax.
Thandie Newton and Cillian Murphy star as a couple who go off on an island retreat to deal with a tragic loss of their stillborn child.  Enter Jamie Bell as an injured soldier who tells them of a pandemic that is slowly spreading around the world, eventually coming their way.  He ultimately imprisons them and ulterior motives surface.
The three actors are very effective, with Bell particularly outstanding in his chilling mutation.  There is an eerie sense of doom that ultimately culminates in a disturbing finale.
RETREAT requires a lot of patience but does leave a sharp impression once it's over.",1330041600,,784,4.961832061068702

This will keep you wondering right up to the end, and even then there is another unpleasant twist.

Nice work from the actors and a great location in Wales.",1329955200,6,439,4.27710843373494

4681605,4,B005FL8G5K,"I had low expectations for ""Retreat,"" and so was pleasantly surprised at just how engaging it turned out to be.  As one of the actors notes in the Special Features, the movie is almost like a play, with nearly all of the action taking place on the single ""stage"" of the cabin.  This could get dull, but with well-drawn characters and a central riddle (is the stranger nuts, telling the truth...what's going on with him?), the story pulls the viewer along nicely.  Spoiler alert:

When the twist arrives, it might remind you of the one in ""The Masque of the Red Death"" or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vertical-Run/dp/0553573926/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vertical Run</a>, but I didn't see it coming, and it was a satisfying plot hinge.",1329868800,,781,5.483333333333333

Kate (Newton) and Martin (Murphy) are in marital trouble. After their first child is stillborn they find a house on a secluded island to stay in and try to work things out. Things are going OK until a stranger shows up on the island. This is a movie that is made by the ending. The entire movie is pretty slow moving and boring in some parts with only three characters in a house for most of the movie. If you stick with it though you won't be disappointed. The ending makes you re-think everything that was said in the movie and makes it better then it could have been. Overall, a bad movie with a good ending.

4681607,4,B005FL8G5K,"This is an indie thriller from director and co-writer Carl Tibbetts and it is billed as a sort of `Twenty Eight Days Later' meets `Straw Dogs', well it really is neither but is still quite good. It is about Kate (Thandie Newton) and Martin (Cillian Murphy) who go to an isolated island in order to repair their fragile relationship after she has lost a baby mid term.

They are the only occupants of this island and the only connection to the mainland is by CB radio to the owners, an elderly couple, who have to come by boat. They try to settle in but the past is all around them and so is the memory of recent events. Then after repeated calls for aid as the generator has, spookily, broken down, they spot a man. He has apparently been washed up on shore and has suffered a head wound. They take him in, he claims to be Private Jack Coleman (Jamie Bell), and he has a story to tell them.

Apparently there has been an outbreak of a new disease which has spread rapidly around the globe. It is an air borne virus to which there is no defence and more importantly no cure. To make it sound more terrifying it has letters and numbers in its name like N31 J42! Their only hope is to lock themselves in and batten down the hatches until the disease burns itself out.

This is a psychological thriller and not a gore fest; it is also not an `end of the world' disaster movie, so claims to have been so are misleading. It is a well acted semi claustrophobic mind battle. All of the performances are well above par and Jamie Bell is particularly interesting as the clearly affected young man. It also boasts a really good score and eight, yes eight executive producers, really guys that is a bit over kill. Still it does have the obligatory twists, but manages to avoid clich&eacute; heaven despite a couple of plot holes, that only anoraks (like myself) would spot, or indeed be churlish enough to mention. At an eighty six minute run time, it is perfectly paced and suspenseful enough to keep most entertained, not one to watch twice though as its strengths are the surprises, so makes for an ideal rental.",1321401600,21,2103,4.414948453608248
