5006637,5,B006MWA8PM,"If you've seen any other Dragon Ball Z Kai Blu-ray release then you know that the quality if astonishing, the sound is awesome, and the animation is perfect.  This version is no different.  I would give it six stars if I could.

My two year old daughter loves Dragon Ball Z Kai.  I started watching it with her and it has really bought us closer together.  Before DBZ Kai, it was like mommy mommy mommy.  Now it's like, where's daddy, I want to watch Dragon Ball Z?  She knows all the characters ... there's Goku, and the kid (Gohan), and the mommy, and Krelin, and Picolo, and Vegeta, and the purple haired guy (trunks).  Thanks funimation ... another great release.",1333670400,7,667,4.5
5006638,5,B006MWA8PM,"Part seven takes the viewer from the battle between Vegeta and Cell through the transformation to Perfect Cell, the battle with Trunks, some down time, and up to the beginning of the battle between Goku and Cell in the Cell games.

I actually noticed less material cut or rearranged from the actual action oriented episodes. There is a bit of material cut from the down time between the end of Cell and Trunk's fight and the start of the Cell games.  Some of the material was moved around, so the timing seems a little off as far as when people are entering or leaving the Hyperbolic Time Chamber.  But any changes are minor, the heart of the story is still intact and the action is included in it's entirety.

If you are familiar with DBZ Kai, you kind of know what to expect:

Original 4:3 presentation the way it was originally drawn to appear (no cropping or stretching)
Some enhancing of lighting effects (mostly on character special moves)
Re-recorded Japanese and English voice work
Original Japanese score
Terrible English dubbed intro and closing songs or slightly less awful Japanese versions
Uncompressed audio

Also note that these later versions needed less 'enhancing' than the episodes of the previous seasons.  The original animation quality was pretty clean (compared to the original US DVD releases from the late 90s/early 2000s which I own).  My only beef is that I wish they would have included the American music track as an option.  I understand that with all of the edits, Funimation would have had their hands full, but six months was plenty of time to work on that!

And of note: Perhaps the extra time between releases was because the American voice actors were being spread around to multiple projects (like the postponed DBZ level 1.1, 1.2, 2.1 series).  But it's here and we only have to wait until June for the rest of Kai.  After the Cell Games saga, the Kai series ends since trying to edit out content of the later sagas would be an insane and futile gesture.  Go with the Dragon Box for the later episodes from Great Saiyaman to Kid Buu.",1333584000,4,2071,4.6878453038674035
5006639,5,B006MWA8PM,"I got my copy early from Rightstuf, and this was well worth the wait! I can only assume it was so they could dub both parts 7 and 8 and then release them closer together. But no matter, this set is great containing episodes from Vegeta Vs Sem-Perfect Cell all the way to the first part of the Goku Vs Cell fight. Although, there were some minor things I disliked about this set. Some of the censorship bothered me, like how they removed the middle finger the announcer gives Cell whilst him and Mr. Satan(yes, Mr. Satan, not ""Hercule"") were teasing Cell, and replaced it with him just holding up his fist. It makes the scene seem odd and out of place, but it's not like it ruins anything or makes it ""for babies"" like most seem to claim. There are still plenty ""b*stards"" thrown about throughout the set. The opening for this set has a handful of singers(I don't believe it's all of them, because I didn't hear Vic in it) singing Dragon Soul, which makes me wonder what the opening will be like for Part 8. Speaking of, the trailer for Part 8 is in this as well. A nice little sneak peak at the final part of Kai. Here's hoping for a Buu saga in the future! (And during an interview with the Japanese voice actor of Trunks, they stated that they would love to do a Buu saga. And Kai was cancelled. It can be picked back up at anytime. So support Kai by buying these season sets ^_^)",1331942400,,1382,4.258555133079848

This part goes from Imperfect Cell's arc to Perfect Cell's arc, the uncut dub (English dub) is as always magnificent and also comes with the original Japanese audio (English subtitles included).

There is no use of the h-word name in the uncut dub, it is the one and only, Mr. Satan!

The last episode on this part is the decisive battle between Cell and Son Goku, the rest follows on the final set (Part Eight - Episodes 89 to 98).

Other interesting content is, the inside cover that features Goku Super Saiyan (seems like Goku Vs. Freeza final moments away from the Freeza arc to me), it would look fantastic as a poster. Dragon Ball Z Kai Part Eight will be released on the 05th June 2012.

Some of you might wonder what Cell said when he got hit by Vegeta's Final Flash, well, it was ""Oh, no!"".

8501187,5,B006MWA8PM,Vegeta getting his ass kicked (as per the course of this show) was a shame. Super Saiyan 1.5 Trunks vs. Perfect Cell was cool to watch (the Kai version). I am so glad a lot of Goku and Gohan's nonsense sub-plot (while waiting for the Cell Games) was taken out. Looking forward to Gohan vs. Cell,1365897600,,294,4.267857142857143
