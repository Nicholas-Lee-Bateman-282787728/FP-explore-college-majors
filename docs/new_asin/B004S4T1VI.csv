4461798,5,B004S4T1VI,"For some people, Like myself I have read the Bible over 100 times. However, as I have come to understand that I am one of those who TAKE INFORMATION - VISUALLY this has been the best source for retaining the information and using it in any situation.",1372291200,,250,4.340425531914893
4461799,5,B004S4T1VI,These dvds were just as they were explained to buy. They are entertaining yet give you a visual of what Bible times may have looked like. They gave me an opportunity do have further conversation about the Bible with the people I viewed them with or lent them to.,1371427200,3,262,4.36734693877551
4461800,1,B004S4T1VI,"The content of these films is hardly worthy of the title ""The Bible Collection."" After watching them I am left with the impression that whoever wrote and directed them has probably never read the bible for themselves. Beyond that they even go so far as to include nudity in ""Paul the Apostle."" To top it all off they include numerous side-plots which, in many cases, undermine the point that the true Bible making in recording the story. Only the vague outline of resembles anything in the Bible. I strongly caution anyone from watching these films, they will only mislead you.",1367539200,11,577,4.78
4461801,5,B004S4T1VI,I would recommend this purchase to anyone who enjoys bible movies they are well done and the acting is really good,1361059200,4,114,4.476190476190476
4461802,4,B004S4T1VI,"I watched these movies with Bible in hand and was hoping to receive a boost to my soul from watching and I did.  Content was biblically accurate for the most part.  The narration did follow Bible readings very well as I kept my Bible open and followed to see how they did.  The films were well done with good acting, not cheesy at all.

I especially enjoyed Abraham (not in this set) and Paul (in this set).

I would advise that those who understand that baptism in Greek means immerse and that earlly Christians were immersing people in water might be shocked to see baptism portrayed by pouring in the movie on Paul.

But overall, for someone looking for something edifying to watch and to grasp some more insight into what it might have been like to be ther, I thought they were well done.",1357948800,3,792,4.427586206896552
4461803,3,B004S4T1VI,"I can't say it's good or bad.  I was dissapointed, because only one dvd of the 5 dvd's is subtitled (Jeremiah), even though the product specifications states ""subtitled"".  I am bilingual, but I like to have closed caption, or subtitled, because the language used in this type of movies is at times hard to understand, or some lingual expressions are rarely used.  At the other hand I also purchased the Bible Collection, and I am very satisfied, since the 6 dvd's are subtitled, and movies were totally understood.

I couldn't return it to the seller.",1354147200,8,551,4.768421052631579
4461804,2,B004S4T1VI,"The DVD Paul has 3 occasions where it shows soft porn (partial nudity), WHY? In the first 37 minutes of watching the Jesus DVD I had to turn it off. Due to the false wording of the script being used by these actors (not biblical). Since the Jesus DVD was so disturbing with its use of words I will not watch the rest of it and I now will throw away this whole DVD set. If you are trying to learn the faith I would recommend other ways. YOU should start by reading the BIBLE to understand the truth of our Heavenly Father and our Lord Jesus Christ. God Bless.",1335484800,9,558,4.081818181818182
4461805,5,B004S4T1VI,Most excellent! I studied the movies after reading the related matter in the King James Version of the Bible along with commentary and found the movies to be very close if not on point with the text. In sharing the DVD's with my children we have reached a deeper understanding of the Bible with the help of G-d's Holy Spirit. Truly a blessing to have as part of my collection of DVD's.,1333584000,9,385,4.361111111111111
4461806,5,B004S4T1VI,"Hours of great learning tools. We have watched some dvd's twice already. One of the best investments made yet. Thanks for the fast service.

8439462,5,B004S4T1VI,"Of course I love it.  I wanted all of the movies, but was unable to watch several of them because they were not Closed Caption, which is what I need.  Some were and others were not.  I didn't hold that against the movies, they are still well made and told.",1492560000,,256,4.08
8439463,1,B004S4T1VI,"Horrilbe PR! Wanted money back with shipping included. The DVD's had HORRIBLE quality; they blanked out in mid-sentance and started back up randomly LATER in a different spot of the scene...ha! (seller claimed that they ""fade to black"" and start up a few seconds in front of where they ""faded"") ! HELLO! I know what a ""fade to black"" is and this was more like a glitch in the recording...I told the seller about it hoping that they would just refund my money because if that is considered ""fade to black"" I wouldn't want them anyway! ALL of the DVD'S did this so APPARENTLY it must be my player the seller suggested....REALLY?!?  The player is 3 months old and all my other DVD's that  I own play perfectly.  OH!  and the one DVD ""Jesus"" had such poor sound quality I was wondering if it wasn't Pirated (boot-legged/copied)! and the one entited Paul had  nudity 3 times; so don't let your children watch them unless you want them subjected to naked back sides and a side view of a woman's breast!

 I was hoping the seller had some integrity being that they sell Christian products and honor my request for a refund and shipping....but NO....they offered to send me another set....wow I hope the $20 they seem pretty hard up to keep was worth it...I will NEVER use this seller again.",1483142400,,1283,4.552173913043478

8439468,5,B004S4T1VI,"I love these movies have about all of them now.  Every Friday we meet with friends and share a bible movie together.  Then we READ that week in the bible finding out what is exact and things we wanted to check and it's fun!!!  We have learned so much in the bible from these movies.  Well worth your money and time.  Puts the excitement in bible reading.  I recommend doing this to anyone who reads the bible as a tool for bible study.  Don't forget the others like the WONDERFUL Gospel of John, and the bible movies.  Check out also the super bible movies at the shows.  All give inspiration  to bible study.  You can't go WRONG :).",1399075200,,633,4.279661016949152
