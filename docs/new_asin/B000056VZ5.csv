7932860,4,B000056VZ5,"There are seven matches on this DVD (with one bonus match - excerpts of it at least), some more impressive than others; however, the Kudo VS Tsuchiya in a barbed-wire Death Match alone is worth checking out this DVD for. The likes of the WWE's women's ""division"" will seem laughable after seeing these FMW matches (assuming you're not laughing at it already). The name ""Torn To Shreds"" is a little misleading, as only one match really gets especially violent (though that one match does deliver exceedingly).

1: Nagashima & Nakano VS Kanbayashi & Kato (***1/2)

2: Bomber Hikaru VS Sub Miss Soto (***)

3: Motaya & Hotaru VS Nakayama & Ishikura (***1/2)

4: Nagayo VS Bad Nurse Nakamura (* - not much of a match really)

5: Combat Toyoda VS Kaoru (**** - impressive match from both girls)

6: Megumi Kudo VS Shark Tsuchiya (***** - Definitely the highlight of this DVD)

7: Tsuchiya & Miss Mongol VS Megumi Kudo & Nakayama (***1/2)

Some extras as well, including an odd ""music video"" of Megumi Kudo and some lame spots of the commentators with the Snake Sisters. All and all, a good DVD to own - you can find it cheap too.",1163980800,2,1124,4.557213930348259
