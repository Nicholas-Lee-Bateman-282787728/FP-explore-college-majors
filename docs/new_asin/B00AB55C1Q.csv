I'm working on getting the remaining seasons.  All the actors are great.  I enjoyed watching Steven Hill.  I first saw him when he starred in  the ""Mission Impossible"" TV show.  Love that show too.",1384387200,,373,4.545454545454546
5408767,5,B00AB55C1Q,I missed several episodes of this season. I want to catch up on what happened. I am looking forward to watching it.,1379548800,,115,4.2727272727272725
5408768,5,B00AB55C1Q,"very high production quality, over the top politically correct sometimes but who cares, they just look silly when they do",1378771200,,121,5.1

5408770,4,B00AB55C1Q,"The emotions of the characters seem so real and genuine. The frustration,, and Irony, and determination, portrayed by the actors shines through all these episodes. This is the one of very few ""Cop"" shows that seems to have any realism to me, even if the writer/producers do use it as a liberal soapbox from time to time. That by the way is why I only gave it a ""4 ""  star rating instead of a ""5"".",1377561600,,396,4.2105263157894735
5408771,5,B00AB55C1Q,Love Law and Order can't wait for the 13th season to come out it's fast pace and i can watch it over and over again,1374537600,,115,3.64
5408772,5,B00AB55C1Q,Received Great condition & all DVDs I watched so far have worked fine. Size of the DVD Box set is smaller than earlier sets.,1374278400,,124,4.208333333333333
5408773,5,B00AB55C1Q,"Waiting for Season 13 to come out.  I have all 12 seasons, and season 14.  I do miss Jerry Orback, may be rest in peace.",1373500800,,120,3.76
5408774,5,B00AB55C1Q,"Although every season of Law & Order has stories ""ripped from the headlines"", this one seems to have more than most. As always, the scripts are tightly written and designed to evoke strong responses from viewers. The previous seasons had much less about the DA, but Dianne Wiest, who appears as an interim DA, is given an expanded role to showcase her acting chops. In one episode, she's even called as a witness. In the same one, the usual criminal trial is dispensed with in favor of putting the ADA on trial for possible sanction or disbarment, an extremely interesting view of something I'd never encountered. Elisabeth Rohm joins the series as this ADA; of all the ADAs in a 20-season series, she's my least favorite, but she gets to shine in a few episodes. The 2001-2002 season skillfully incorporates the events of 9/11 without going overboard; possibly some of that is due to many scripts having been written before then. From here until the final season, terrorism will play an increasingly noticeable part in the stories, but the range of plots is extensive. A particularly scary episode features a pit bull attack in Central Park; another has a form of road rage. Since the series is set in NYC, naturally most of the stories are specific to this urban environment, but plenty go beyond the city limits, all the way up to Albany. This season is highly emotionally satisfying, but the DVD set itself is frustrating as, once again, no episode lists or synopses are provided, either in the packaging or on the DVDs themselves. Very annoying, especially as the earlier seasons had such information, which was quite helpful. However, Wikipedia has this data if you need it.",1371772800,,1680,4.8166089965397925
5408775,4,B00AB55C1Q,"I rated this item as I did because like years 9, 10, and 11, no synposes are available for any of the episodes. Guess I got spoiled by the earlier copies I bought which contain detailed synposes of each show.. I have the fourteenth year already, so I probably won't buy any more after the thirteenth year version is issued.",1369526400,,323,4.4
5408776,5,B00AB55C1Q,I'm collecting the series and all releases of L&O -- I have yet to see an episode I don't like.,1369353600,,95,3.8
5408777,5,B00AB55C1Q,"One more great year of Law and Order. I wish it was still on...I get every year when they come out on DVD.
Looking to see year 13 soon. Year 14 is out. But I hear it is not that good. I will sit tight until they put the new year 14 out.",1369094400,,236,3.4716981132075473
5408778,3,B00AB55C1Q,"I am a true L&O junkie-and since they are no longer on TV, I get my fix with these DVD's. However, I too was upset that not only are some shows missing altogether (bought 10,11,12) (don't get the full season) but the episodes aren't always in sequence. Part of the fun is watching the characters change and evolve and that aspect is not always present. Comcast has the first eight episodes 'On Demand"" if anyone is interested, but those are a bit worse in that the shows in each series are also not in sequence, some episodes are missing and in addition, in two seasons they show just a Part I or a Part III of a series! making those episodes useless-still, less expensive than the disks and these disks here are still good with the flaws and better than withdrawl!",1367539200,3,765,4.432624113475177
5408779,5,B00AB55C1Q,"This season of the show had a special recording played to introduce the fact that Law & Order, Special Victims Unit and Criminal Intent of that season were dedicated to the first-responders. You will notice that after a certain number of episodes you will start to see the police wearing a black stripe over their badge as tribute to the officers who sacrificed their lives. It is also the highest rated season of Law & Order out of all 20 seasons. The episodes will not disappoint. They go from racism as a possible mental defect to tainted forensics. From a wild pit-bull attacking a dog-walker to a civilian killing a suspected terrorist. There is yet, another addition to the cast. Elizabeth Rohm who plays ADA Serena Southerlyn(Another character with a name inspired by Dick Wolf's own children). She could have used a better introduction in her premiere episode, but she certainly shines the episode DR 1-102 where she's not completely honest about being a lawyer and that almost costs her. Season 12 is definitely a must have for all fans of Law & Order. This was also the first year to introduce Law & Order: Criminal Intent, but that is a review for another DVD. If you do not have the entire series boxset because you're like me and you already started to buying individual seasons, then be sure to add this season to your top five list of all things Law & Order.",1367452800,,1373,4.631147540983607
5408780,5,B00AB55C1Q,I enjoy all my seasons of L&O. I wish they would put the seasons out sooner. Just waiting for season Thirteen.,1366675200,,110,4.285714285714286
5408781,5,B00AB55C1Q,"Law & Order is one of my all time favorite shows.  I own seasons one thru twelve and also season fourteen.  In spite of owning all of those, I will still watch reruns on television.  Yes, I am ""guilty"" of being a dedicated fan.",1365292800,,227,4.113636363636363
5408782,4,B00AB55C1Q,"I have never watched an episode in this series where afterwards I wanted that hour of my life back. In other words, L&O is a GREAT series. My only caveat is that this season seemed a little ""top-heavy"" with crimes of the ""ground-breaking"" precedent-setting sort, undermining the notion that McCoy, Briscoe & Co. are just ""ordinary"" New York law enforcement professionals dealing with the day to day crimes of the largest metropolis in the United States.

I mean, in one ""short"" season we see McCoy handle multiple cases ""ripped from the nation's headlines"": the menace of pit bulls, war crimes committed in VietNam, famous people hiring hitmen to kill their spouses (at least 3x), blood diamonds, a CSI who repeatedly falsifies evidence to fabricate convictions---even Little Leaguers who fake their age to obtain an unfair advantage on the ballfield.

Frankly, while these kinds of cases can be very interesting, I'd like them in smaller does, mixed in with a lot more ""ordinary"" crimes, which can still be very intriguing and more plausible since surely no one New York prosecutor has personally handled just about every major precedent-setting case in America! ;)",1365206400,,1166,5.099476439790576
5408783,5,B00AB55C1Q,"I have watched this show from the beginning 'til the end It is as good as tv can ever get. I like all of the L and O shows

5408788,3,B00AB55C1Q,"I am a Law and Order Fan and will always be. This particular season has several shows that are duplicates on each disk. You don't get every show, or I sure didn't get that on my DVD. That happened in the 11th Season and 10th Season DVDs. I hope that doesn't happen in any other seasons especially if one gets the boxed set.

5408792,5,B00AB55C1Q,Without a doubt I think that this is the best season of Law & Order. This was the season that was running during 9/11 and I think it had a gigantic impact on the tone of the show. This is also my very favorite cast. Dianne Wiest was her amazing self and this is also the year that Elisabeth Rohm joined the cast. If you plan on buying any season this is the one that I recommend.
