This DVD may not appeal to the masses, as it's not a fast moving workout (think Moira Stott, here!)  But, it's filmed in a beautiful outdoor setting, on a beach looking out over the water.  The music is calming and of very good quality, more classical in nature.

This DVD would be well suited for the beginning or intermediate pilates person who appreciates a thorough warm up to prepare the body for the exercises.  It would also be excellent for an older exerciser, or deconditioned person who wants to move slower.

This won't be everyone's cup of tea, but I liked it well enough to want to seek out other workouts by this trainer.  She's a very good instructor and I wouldn't hesitate to buy other workouts with her!  If you have ADD or are a type ""A"" personality this may not be your thing, but I loved it and plan to use it more often!

Oh, and the mini-ball is used only in the second part of the workout, so it's not something you have to have to do every exercise.  Traditional exercises are done, as well as a few new things thrown in like ""helicopter.""

Juliana is low key and soft spoken (with an accent) and beautful in form and grace!",1179187200,8,1370,4.325490196078431
8046371,5,B00079W8V8,"Juliana Afram's Pilates Miniball workout is a smooth satisfying routine with challenging exercises infused with an aesthetic creativity. You don't have to have a ball to do this workout, but it helps with three or four exercises. You could use a folded pillow, which worked fairly well for me. The side lateral twist exercise definitely needs a pillow or ball in order to complete the more advanced sections. The only problem with this one exercise was that you have to rewind to switch sides. Somehow in the editing, this was overlooked. It only took a second to rewind but I hope this will be fixed, or has been for future DVDs.

The exercise routine includes:

Warm Up

The artistic flowing quality of many of the exercises makes them physically challenging, while they also heal you spiritually. The most difficult exercise on this DVD is the roll over where you literally lay on your back and then take your feet up over your head so you are folded in half. You can work your way into this...I still rock my way over because I'm working on the control needed to ease my way over. On other exercises, you may have already mastered the basics, so they become places where you are satisfied with your sense of control.

The roll up should be familiar to everyone who has tried Pilates and the half roll up is a nice way to ease into the exercise. One some exercises she shows a variety of modifications. There is a fun helicopter move that increases hip mobility.

What I loved most about this routine was the focus on loosening your shoulders. A variety of exercises and a cervical nod help to loosen the entire upper body, leaving you refreshed. If you work on a computer all day, then this is perfect for an early evening exercise session. The smooth and jazzy soundtrack leads you into relaxation all while encouraging full participation as you increase shoulder mobility.

This workout is time for you. Turn off the lights, light a candle and relax on your Pilates mat. Most of this workout will have you either laying on your back or stomach with only a few standing postures (Pilates push up goes from plank to standing).

Of all the Pilates routines I've tried over the years, this one left me feeling relaxed, very satisfied spiritually and completely nourished from head to toe. Juliana Afram's positive energy is healing and her exercises are creative and invigorating. The beach atmosphere and jazzy soundtrack promotes a positive energy flow that leads you into a new dimension of fitness.
