2637580,5,B000HEWGVU,"This DVD shows actual footage of the Nazis and the concentration camps, from the early days of both to the liberation of Buchenwald and Ravensbruck. Especially interesting was footage of local villagers brought to one of the camps immediately after liberation to see what their countrymen had done, and to see their reactions to the horror and starvation and crematoriums and brutality. If you are interested in the Holocaust this is an excellent addition to your collection, as there is no substitue for actual photographs with a subject like this. I recommend it.",1245628800,63,565,5.086021505376344

2637617,4,B000HEWGVU,This is a very short version of the horror of hitler's hate and the death of millions. None the less what you see is enough to make the hardest of people sick. We live in evil times today. Almost at this date nearing the horror of hitler and his hate of certian peoples. By The grace of God may we never live to see murder in a man or groups of men to be allowed to do the evil done to those in so many of these hellish camps of death. If you have children make sure they know what is about to be seen before showing this DVD. As for me I would not show it to anyone under the age of 16 and even then I would make sure they unstood what they were about to see. Like other movies of this horror it leaves one to wonder how could any human or groups of humans do to their fellow man and women what was done to these people. Not even an animal should have to go through what happen at the hands of hitler and the German people.,1417737600,2,924,3.842931937172775

2637635,5,B000HEWGVU,The horrific reminders of the treatment of the Jewish race during WWII is well documented in this DVD.  The like treatment of the other races of interned along with the Jewish people needs to be told and retold so that people do not forget the terror and murder by a select few against other races.,1386374400,20,298,4.418181818181818

2637638,5,B000HEWGVU,"This series is quite good.  If you want a raw series that explains two of the more prominent Nazi prison camp systems, this series will not dissappoint.",1364515200,17,152,4.62962962962963
2637639,4,B000HEWGVU,"The documentary does an adequate job of examining the origins and operation of these two infamous camps, but it is presented in a rather dry, almost clinical, manner that the full magnitude of the Nazi crimes are somewhat denuded.",1359676800,,230,4.923076923076923
2637640,5,B000HEWGVU,"Anxiously awaited this DVD.
It was very hard to watch, but we MUST NEVER FORGET!!!!

2637641,1,B000HEWGVU,"The viewer of this ""documentary"" will learn many curious ""facts."" For instance, he will be informed of the existence of a homicidal gas chamber at Buchenwald, and that the Nazis made human skin lampshades and shrunken human heads.

The historian Martin Broszat of the vehemently anti-Nazi Institute for Contemporary History (Institut fr Zeitgeschichte) admitted in a letter to Die Zeit published on 19 August 1960 that ""neither in Dachau nor in Bergen-Belsen nor in Buchenwald were Jews or other prisoners gassed.""  The fact that more than 50 years after this admission, films like this are still being sold not as examples of historical war propaganda but as a factual documentary is an insult to reason.

The Buchenwald shrunken heads and human skin lampshades were part of an American psychological warfare operation.  No serious historian defends the idea that the Germans made such items.  (The film ""Buchenwald: a dumb dumb portrayal of evil"" explores this matter further.)

This film exploits squeamishness about cremation to suggest that the crematorium of Buchenwald had some kind of criminal purpose, when in fact cremation is simply a sensible sanitary measure.  The cremation ovens are assigned a laughably inflated incineration capacity, and the filmmakers can't resist trotting out the old lie that the company Topf and sons, which made the crematoria of Buchenwald and Auschwitz was formerly a manufacturer of bakers' ovens.  The intended implication is that in National Socialist Germany ordinary and healthy things (baking bread) were turned to evil.  In fact, Topf and sons had worked in the cremation industry since before the first world war.  Nor is there any connection between building cremation ovens and mass murder.

Similar nonsense prevails concerning Ravensbrck.  The viewer is informed that in Autumn 1944 a gas chamber was built for ""systematic extermination.""  Yet already in 1968 Jewish 'holocaust' historian Olga Wormser-Migot observed that there were no gas chambers at Ravensbrck: ""...the declarations on the gas chamber at Ravensbrck place the beginning of its existence in Febr. 1945, date of the arrival of those evacuated from Auschwitz, the date when the Ravensbrck detainees discovered the existence of gas chambers at Auschwitz."" [""Le Systme concentrationnaire nazi"", Le problme des chambres  gaz, p. 544]  In other words, the story of gas chambers was just a story, which the inmates from Auschwitz carried with them when they were evacuated from Auschwitz to Ravensbrck.

Visual content is cleverly used to make the narrator's assertions seem plausible. Images have a tremendous ability to compel belief - the saying ""seeing is believing"" exists for good reason.  A claim that would be laughed at if presented unaccompanied will often be believed if it is joined to an image, even if that image offers no real proof of the claim in question.  We are far too ready to trust images, and propaganda like this exploits that cognitive error.  One would think that familiarity with the movies would have taught people how the medium of film can be used to create illusions, but since ""documentaries"" like this are still successful that seems not to be the case.

In summary, this film is nothing more than a warmed over version of the propaganda films made in 1945 and 1946.  If it has any educational purpose at all, it is to illustrate how pseudo-documentary film can be used to deceive, through dishonest narration, emotional manipulation, careful selection of shots, and the omission of critical information.",1357084800,4,3551,5.238515901060071
2637642,5,B000HEWGVU,This is more of a documentary that shows more of what Hitler did during WW11.  Most of it is very graphic but it does show what had happened during the worst time in history.,1335571200,,174,4.117647058823529
2637643,4,B000HEWGVU,"This documentary was heartbreaking, but I knew that it would be. There is no excuse for the horrible deeds carried out by the Nazis in world war II.  What kind of demonic mind can think up these attrocities and follow through with them?",1298851200,6,236,4.488372093023256
2637644,5,B000HEWGVU,"Unlike another DVD in this series (Dachau and Sachsenhausen which contains factual errors), this documentary which focuses on Ravensbruck and Buchenwald camps is well put-together and accurate. There's a lot of graphic footage and unpublished photos here about the atrocities committed by the Nazis at the two concentration camps. In Buchenwald, inmates were literally worked to death, making a mockery on the Nazi dictate ""Arbeit Macht Frei"", i.e. ""Work will set you free"".  In Ravensbruck, a female concentration camp (most of the inmates were Polish Jews), cruel and sadistic medical experiments (with no scientific basis) were carried out on the helpless women, many of whom were also subjected to torture. What troubles me till today is the fact that many of the townspeople and villagers who knew what these camps were about feigned absolute surprise that such atrocities were being committed near their homes and villages! I find it incredulous that they were completely unaware. Even more sickening is the fact that some German companies were actually profiting from slave labor and got away with it to a large extent. Many of the SS responsible for committing atrocities escaped justice. It truly makes one wonder at the injustice of it all.",1267920000,55,1250,5.218905472636816
2637645,5,B000HEWGVU,I ordered this video for a college project on World War II. This video gave me an inside look at the horror those innocent people faced during this period.,1258675200,3,155,4.379310344827586
8139615,5,B000HEWGVU,"Very well done documentary.  It always has baffled my mind that so many evil people existed at one time, including those who stood by & did nothing.  They are just as evil as the perps.  It shows lots of photos & movies of the camps & the atrocities committed at these 2 places.  One thing was said, that their stories will never be forgotten. Unfortunately, that is not true anymore.  Too many people say this never happened.  We must never forget.  Watch this with your children.  Yes, it's graphic, but they must learn the truth so it won't happen again.",1519516800,,557,4.5

8139620,4,B000HEWGVU,"""Yom HaZikaron laShoah ve-laG'vurah (   ;  or Yom HaShoah"" ""Holocaust and Heroism Remembrance Day"" has just passed. Once again I began to consider if, ""Never Again"" might be slipping from collective conscience? Is ""Never Again"" happening again? ISIS and Islamic Extremism attempting to eradicate Christian's and other minorities that sick minds feel are lesser than themselves?  This makes sense?? And the world sits back (as it did in the late 1930's and early 1940's) and thinks negotiation will resolve the disease of hatred? How well did that work out? How many paid with their lives before action was taken through military strength.
I am a proud Jewish man with deeply held convictions. Two decades ago, a dear great-aunt had a genealogy report made for my family. In it was a name of another distant relative who had been slaughtered in the Dachau Concentration Camp. It had long been rumored that he might have been associated with one of the Nazi run camps, but no one knew for sure. Until this report. Of course, this DVD is not the one dealing with Dachau, (unavailable at the time of this purchase), but it's a close frame of reference to the horrors that occurred within all Concentration Camps.

Ravensbrck, namely, was of interest. Being one of the only camps set up for women, was especially brutal. Although not exclusively for Jewish women, this DVD did sample torturous methods employed by female Nazi officers (in title only.) Possibly with the blessings of their male counterparts, they went to extremes to treat women prisoners, less than animals. And the so-called medical procedures were unspeakable! As for Buchenwald, this DVD depicts a camp no different than the dozens of others. Movie reels of townspeople being toured through the camp, seeing the victims along with those disgusting human ""keepsakes."" All been done before.
I must say, compared to other documentary films I've seen over the years, ""Holocaust: Ravensbrck & Buchenwald"" added little to what has already been packaged and sold. The footage, while horrific and real, was patched together from other films I actually own in my library of discs. Yes, there was new information and footage that shocked, and brought to light the pure evil concerning the women's camp, but in it's entirety, this has been viewed for years if one followed Hitler's, ""final solution."" I have not purchased the rest of the DVD's in this set, and do not think I will. My library of Blu-Ray's and DVD's documenting the insanity behind the thinking that if a drug-addicted, lunatic could lead a nation into blindly believing that the extermination of the ""Jewish race"" would in some way, return the glory of the ""Germanic superiority"" is well represented. Again, this DVD is interesting and informative for those who seek to gain an understanding, this one is a great start. For those of us who have a knowledge base with a historic perspective from many other ""footage"" films, this offers little more.
The meaning of ""Never Again"" implies we teach this generation, and our younger ones, especially with social media, that if we allow personal squabbles to become racial/religious confrontations, ""Never Again"" WILL happen again! Are we then going to ask how and why did this happen?",1464566400,6,3249,5.0092592592592595
