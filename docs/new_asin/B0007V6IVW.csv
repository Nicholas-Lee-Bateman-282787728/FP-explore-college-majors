2245651,5,B0007V6IVW,"To CDI Grizzly ?? Sounds like sour grapes to me... American Chopper is an amazing series and it shows the talent and drive of a couple hard working Americans who did well for them selfs... Whats a matter, are you jealous of these guys. ??  I am not a Biker but I did re-build a 66 Corvette Big Block Roadster

(frame off) and I do know a thing or 2 about how much work it is...I would even pretend to assume I have the talent of these guys.. As for the ""old man"" I am Paul Srs age and he looks great, I wouldn't mess with that big gorilla !! The show is great, the comedy is refreshing, and I highly recommend this DVD collection to anyone who like bikes and want to get a real feel of how much work goes into one !!  If your so jealous of these guys don't watch the show and don't write a review just to vent your jealousy !! Bravo Discovery and Paul Sr. & Jr. (and Mike & Vinnie as well !!)  - Pete C.",1120003200,7,903,3.891304347826087
2245652,5,B0007V6IVW,"I just ordered the first and second season. I am impressed at the creativity that is put into OCC's bikes. If I rode a panhead for 25-years and rebuilt it twice, I would be jeolous of the teutle's success too. Panhead's, welcome to the 21st Century.",1118188800,3,249,4.434782608695652
2245653,4,B0007V6IVW,"If compared to the specs listed at discoverychannel.com, there are 3 episodes missing from this box set.  These are ""Christmas Bike"" & ""Dixie Chopper Pt 1 & 2"".  If you want to add these to complete the season. prepare to shell out another $57 + s/h from discoverchannel.com to get them.  Why, oh why were these not added?  I would have gladly paid another $20-$30 for this set to have the COMPLETE 2nd season!  $50-$60 is still WAY better than the stupifying $144 Discovery Channel want for this season!  Here's hoping that season 3 will be complete w/ all the episodes that aired.",1117411200,9,582,4.601941747572815
2245654,4,B0007V6IVW,"First of all im a big fan of the series.  Finally the guys at OCC and the Sony Picture company did something great for their fans.  They made box sets open for the public to buy.  The first season is a great grab at the price.  You pay little under 25 bucks for the entire season I bought from discovery channel for 75 bucks.  Then comes the second season.  The only problem I have with season 2, is that you are missing bikes out of the season.  There is no dixie chopper, I robot, police bike and more.  These bikes are are equally impressive with the rest of the bikes.  Why not have these in the set?  Should have made season 1 as is, then if you had to raise the price on season 2, to 50 bucks that would been worth while than the 150 bucks at discovery channel's store.",1115683200,6,775,4.072847682119205
2245655,2,B0007V6IVW,"Speaking on the authority of a REAL Biker who has LIVED the Lifestyle for over 35 of my almost 53 years, during which I have ridden the same '63 Harley Panhead, (which I built and rebuilt from the ground up with my own two hands), longer than the Turtle Kids have been alive, My Brothers and I all find Orange County Chumps to be some of the Funniest Comedy on DVD! Their Ol'Man is one of the greatest comedians to try and call himself a ""biker""; seemingly, the only thing that HE works at is running his MOUTH! What little I have been able to watch of this show without developing acute nausea, I have NEVER seen Turtle, Sr. EVER pick up a tool or lend a hand to help anyone at ANYTHING.
The bikes built by OCC may have some eye appeal, but are otherwise a waste of parts & labor, as they are totally unridable; you would need an entire parking lot to turn one of them around, and the spider bike in particular, with its ridiculous rear fender, would give you a radical shower if one attempted to ride it on wet pavement, much less in the rain!(And I would LOVE to know what company sells them INSURANCE!)
My Brothers and I have long debated which is more hilarious, the Turtles, with their hour long screaming matches, or the sidewalk commandos who give the mighty OCC free advertising, running around with T-shirts & other gear, none of whom OWN, or probably even KNOW HOW to ride a MOTORCYCLE! Only Hang-arounds and Wannabees worship these comedians; REAL Bikers only LAUGH at them! The only reason this gets two stars is for the comedy element!
As far as other reviewers who are so critical of my well earned opinion are concerned, just read their other reviews (if they have any)!
At least Jesse James RIDES his creations to shows! The Turtles TRAILER Theirs (and then have to FLY IN their mechanics when one of their monstrosities breaks down!) JESSE may be terminally commercial, but at least he's HONEST!",1115596800,5,1913,4.484240687679083

2245658,5,B0007V6IVW,"What happened to Junior's Dream Bike 2, and the Caterpiler Bike, Also the Carol Shelby Bike episodes are gone? Please put them back up.",1392422400,,135,4.666666666666667

2245660,4,B0007V6IVW,"This is when the episodes list starts to get messy. The 3-Disc set only includes 13 episodes of AC show, meaning by this that it's not the complete second season. Although it includes the original aired sequence of the episodes, which is good, the ""OCC Holiday Special (Santa Bike)"" is not included. Also contains as the last episode the Mikey Special which belongs to season one. As a DVD description, it has nice intros, episodes selection and special features. Unfortunately for people interesting in other languages, it does NOT include any subtitles (spanish,french,...), but it includes closed captions.",1208649600,,609,5.224489795918367
2245661,4,B0007V6IVW,"I have to say season two is just as excellent as one.  The Teutuls haven't changed they still love to argue about as much as they love to build bikes.  The POW/MIA Chopper Sr. creates along with the help of Rick, Cody, Mikey and Campo is incredable.  The custom paint job designed by Justin Barnes is far beyond awesome.  The same goes for the Snap-On bike and the Miller Welding bike, Paul Jr and Vinnie out done themselves with the creation of these bikes and of course Justin's paint work was bitchin as usual.  I understand an agree with Sr's desire to keep the shop presentable however, I was pissed Sr. placed the responsibilty of shop cleanliness on Vinnie, this is really where Jr's work ethics come into question as a shop foreman he should have shouldered the responsibilty in ensuring everyone who works in there cleans up after themselves.  It did say alot about Vinnie's character and commitment to the company that he not only took the brunt of Sr's anger over shop cleanilness he aggressivly worked to clean it up and got back to working on the bike without missing a beat.  Overall again I believe most people who watch American Chopper or Motorcycle Mania will be forever hooked.",1139616000,2,1196,4.639810426540285
2245662,4,B0007V6IVW,"This set is the second season of American Chopper.  I am pleased to say I don't think there was as many screaming matches in this series as there was in the first.  Although they still do have a couple of doosies and in one episode you have to wonder why Vinnie doesn't quit in disgust!  There did feel like there was a couple of ""filler"" episodes with this series, in particular the Football Bike and Mikey Special.  The Mikey Special was just a wrap-up of what we have already seen in the last two seasons so I felt it was a waste of space.  Regardless of that, still enjoyed the second series immensely and am hanging to buy the third!

2245663,5,B0007V6IVW,"The best ever! Such creativity, originality and lots of fun! Watching this dvd makes you want to ride OCC bikes! Can't wait to get season 3!",1128902400,,140,4.423076923076923
2245664,5,B0007V6IVW,"Nice bikes, talented builders, and some comedic moments. By the way, the Dixie Chopper episodes are on season 3...it's right there on the cover of the box.",1126656000,,155,4.777777777777778
2245665,4,B0007V6IVW,"Oh Mr. Grizzly.  Six times?  What overkill!  First of all, Sr. owns the business.  He doesn't have to build the bikes; he has employees for that.  His job is MANAGING, which involves paperwork and bossing people around.  Regardless, he has built bikes on the show.  In the first season he built the old school bike with Cody and a bike for Miss Lucy; in the second season he built the Christmas bike and the POW bike.  As far as people who don't own motorcycles buying OCC merchandise: what a ridiculous statement.  Do I have to be a doctor to enjoy ER?  Do I have to be a SPY to enjoy Alias?  Do I have to be dead to enjoy Six Feet Under?  Of course not.

American Chopper is not just a show about motorcycles.  It's about family dynamics, work, friendship and craft.  Most of the bikes built are ART; and the Teutuls themselves admit that the ones with the huge turning radii aren't meant to be ridden, for the same reason you wouldn't hang a Degas over your couch.

As much as I love the show, I do have a problem with the box set not including all the episodes of the season.  There seems to be no good reason for the omission, but I'm not going to throw a hissy SIX TIMES over it.",1121299200,11,1185,4.195555555555556

8052222,4,B0007V6IVW,"It isn't the full season, certain episodes are missing from the list that aired on television.

I really enjoy the series and I can overlook one or two episodes being cut but I kind of wish I had bought a physical copy of the season because after watching the incomplete second season I think I would just trade it in to buy another show or movie. There isn't a lot here that makes me say that the $35 price tag is worth paying. Maybe include the special features from the DVD copy of the season, outtakes or something that makes it worth watching over and over again.

Again, I am a fan of the series, I like most of the bikes they build but as far the actual purchase of the incomplete second season, I am not overly joyed with my purchase.",1458950400,,742,4.21830985915493
