8219662,5,B000VS6R76,"There's no screaming rip roaring Blues guitar solos on this, so if you are a fan of Blues-Rock you might not dig this, but if you love REAL Chicago Blues like I do, this is a verifiable clinic on how to play Real Blues guitar put on by Illinois Slim and Rick Kreher.  Real deal authentic Chicago Blues.  Arthur is a little frail, not at full strength, but get over it, and appreciate this for what it really is.  As always with Delmark DVD's, great sound/great video quality, Steve Wagner (audio engineer/producer) deserves a spot in the Blues Hall of Fame",1362441600,,556,4.485148514851486
