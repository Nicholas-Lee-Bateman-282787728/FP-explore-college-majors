1791038,5,B00006RCLN,"This is an amazing DVD that shows excerpts from many of Elvis' concerts over a 20 year span of time. There are also many people who worked with Elvis, or knew Elvis in some way that were interviewed. They would talk about the many aspects of Elvis' life, career, and the person that Elvis was. I have played this DVD over and over again! I highly recommend this to any Elvis fan.",1284422400,6,379,4.277777777777778
1791039,5,B00006RCLN,"This was a very interesting DVD.  A lot of footage that I had never seen before.  Also it was very comprehensive and covered Elvis' entire life.  I would reccomend, although be warned it is not of the quality that you see from other Elvis documentary's that are actually sanctioned by the Elvis estate.",1282694400,5,302,4.660377358490566
1791040,4,B00006RCLN,"If your looking for a reasonably priced, and entertaining overview of Elvis Presley's life and career, this is the DVD that you should buy.

I was surprised at some of the rare footage that I had not seen before, such as Elvis on the Milton Berle show aboard the USS Hancock, and Uncle Milty playing his twin brother, Melvin.

Suprisingly for a low priced DVD, the picture quality of the documentary and sound is top notch as well. I was suprised at the many performances and interviews that you will see throughout this documentary.

Pick this one up ladies and gentlemen, it is well worth the price! TCB",1186012800,34,605,4.583333333333333
1791041,3,B00006RCLN,"(3 1/2 *'s)  'Elvis: King of Entertainment' is more of a documentary than it is a compilation of performances.  It is an overview of the highlights of his life, his career, his performances, and his movies.  As a sampler it works well.  Interspersed with television performances and interviews, it is a testament to the phenomena that Elvis is and was.  The only drawback is that the brief touches of each highlight will only be teasing and never really satisfying.  Seeing footage of his army induction, his wedding, and early as well as Las Vegas performances are an interesting draw.

(Avoid by all means the companion video 'Elvis:  Rare moments with the King,' which is published by the same company, is shorter, and repeats the highlights here.  With almost no musical samples, the latter is almost more an archive of only sociological importance.)",1176681600,55,854,4.957746478873239
1791042,5,B00006RCLN,"This DVD is one of the most comprehensive documentaries of the King's history. It starts during the war years and documents the influence the local charismatic churches had on his life. A great deal of the video coverage is a first for Elvis fans. The account then continues on through his meteoric climb to fame, shows TV footage not seen before and continues on through his movie career to his return as a live entertainer enchanting the world. A tuely worthwhile account for all you Elvis fans out there.",1175126400,18,507,4.707865168539326
1791043,2,B00006RCLN,"Not bad for a 'history of elvis' type program. Not much at all in the way of any performing. It moves slow and tends to lose you in the first 15 minutes or so. If you want to learn about how elvis got to be ""Elvis"" then this would be a good disc. If you are looking for simply his shows & songs, this is the wrong DVD.",1168041600,29,318,3.6911764705882355

1791106,5,B00006RCLN,"I loved this DVD then again I love all of elvis's concert DVDs,this one did not disappoint,I've ordered six Elvis concert DVDs so far,and expect to be getting more,if you have it,I would love to see Elvis Live At Madison Square Garden's I have the cd and want to know if its available on DVD,also his last concert on June 26-1977 I know it was filmed and would like to see it in its entirety,I've saw bits and pieces and would love to add it to my collection since it happened on my birthday!!! Thanks for sending me updates on what you have of Elvis in concert DVDs!! Rock and roll began and ended with Elvis as far as I'm concerned!!!!",1402531200,,637,4.2727272727272725
1791107,4,B00006RCLN,"While I'm facinated by Elvis, I'm no where near the level of most Elvis fans & am a novice at his discography and his history.

If you're after a dvd containing one of his concerts, this is not the one, keep looking.

For me, however, while I'm still looking for a good Elvis concert DVD, this one is a great history lesson into how Elvis got where he did.  There is some music video, but consider this more of an entertaining documentary.
As an Elvis novice, I found this DVD to be almost as entertaining as a concert DVD.  No complaints here!",1402272000,,544,4.303921568627451
1791108,3,B00006RCLN,"Not the best I've ever seen, but still glad I have it. If you are a fan you will want it in your collection.",1401235200,,108,3.5416666666666665
1791109,5,B00006RCLN,"I finally was able to play this video-it went beyond any hopes I had about it. So real and to be able to see so many things with Elvis
as he really was in his younger years which were mine also. As a new bride and mother of three children I really had no time to see what I was missing.
After Elvis died on my wedding anniversary, I began to read and learn as much as I could about his life and this was a real bonus that I couldn't even hope to find.",1397692800,3,451,3.7578947368421054

1791111,3,B00006RCLN,"My favorite singer ... Presley was truly great when singing the right and a great song, but none the less overrated as a whole through  promotional notoriety and hype ...made a lot of stupid stuff, but had times of greatness both personally and musical that shone through all the rest that made him a real ""king"".",1395187200,,313,4.589285714285714
1791112,3,B00006RCLN,"The company and product that I purchased, was excellent. It arrived swiftly and new condition. I was disappointed with the DVD, itself. I have seen much better and more thorough documentaries; than this one. I would not recommend this one, if you want to obtain more information about Elvis, not a lot of original clips, from the early years. It just doesn't keep your interest for 101 minutes. His climb to fame and fortune is a long story. It could have been more informative without showing the same old clips. Sorry, not my favorite.

1791113,3,B00006RCLN,"It is quite a nice biography, but if you are interested in historical truth, you'll be disappointed. I can't quite undertand, why in a DVD, that's made 2002, it's not possible to avoid these errors! For example: Elvis wasn't born first, it was his stillborn twin; he didn't win second price at the age of ten, it was fifth (as Elvis himself told his friend), he didn't get his first real guitar at 13, he was 11; he didn't sing Heartbreak Hotel in his first Stage Show, it was the third one; his Vegas engagement in 1956 was only for 2 weeks, not for 4weeks (and cancelled after 2 weeks!). And I can't understand, why they play a song  (The wonder of you) to acconpany the video of Madison Square Garden, that he didn't sing at all (not in one of his 4 concerts!)
And there are some more mistakes, but if you don't mind them and if you haven't seen quite a lot of biographis of Elvis, it's quite a nice one!",1389139200,4,907,4.242774566473988
1791114,5,B00006RCLN,"This was a very exciting,informative and entertaining documentary of the King of rockn'roll the one and only Elvis Presley. He was very unique and different and there will never be anyone like him again. I wish I could have seen him in concert, but the concerts were all sold out.",1385510400,,280,4.62

1791128,5,B00006RCLN,Five star entertainment. Top of the game Elvis. The only negative is that it left me so sad that he is nolonger physically with us. But I do believe his spirit is captured within these dvds. Long live the King.,1371168000,,210,4.275

1791131,5,B00006RCLN,"There should be a biography channel documentary, this would be it.  It is white washed enough that the Republicans GOP would allow it in.  I am sorry to see they did not mention his grammys for Gospels and how important GOD is to him!!!",1365811200,,236,4.340909090909091
1791132,5,B00006RCLN,"To love his musical talent is one thing, but to truly know about Elvis, well, that is something else. This DVD gives a look at his life, his career, as well as the movies and TV Performances. His army days, concerts, wedding, and so many behind-the-scenes are included in this DVD. My favorite parts are his music and his stunning suits. There is so much to see; so much to hear; so much to love.

I recommend this to anyone who wants a more complete story of Elvis, much of it told by Elvis himself.",1364860800,,500,4.2631578947368425
