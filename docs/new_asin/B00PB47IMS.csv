8687257,4,B00PB47IMS,Was surprised to not find as much signing as I expected since it involves Rachel Coleman...but my hh daughter loves it...the characters are fun and the songs are easy to follow....,1451779200,,180,4.838709677419355
8687258,5,B00PB47IMS,If you are wondering about this set there are samples of the treeschoolers on youtube.  My child is 15 months and has done signing time since 3 months.  He is not non hearing or non verbal.  We just like having the second hands on language.  I hope this tid bit helps you in your choice.  We love signing time and tree schoolers.,1449273600,,329,4.241935483870968
8687259,3,B00PB47IMS,"If you are looking for signing instruction, this set is not it.  I was a bit disappointed in the Tree Schooler set.  I bought it for my special needs son who is 100% nonverbal and uses basic sign language to communicate.  While the content is educational, there is very little signing in it.  Rachel does introduce signs, but the video does not do a good job of repeating the signs like is done in Baby Signing Time or the regular Signing Time videos.  If you missed the sign, you missed it, there was no waiting to see it repeated again.  Repetition is necessary to master the sign so it seemed the videos were more geared just toward the educational content than actually focusing on learning the signs that go with it.  Since signing is our main form of communication, seeing the signs performed repeatedly is important.  The signs are already in the Signing Time set so we weren't learning anything new and the Tree Schooler content did not keep my son's attention.  I think more typical kids might like the Tree Schooler set, but it was a bust for us and our special needs son.",1438214400,3,1082,4.507692307692308
8687260,5,B00PB47IMS,"My kids LOVE this series!!  My family has grown up on the Signing Time dvds, and now we are enjoying this new series.  So very smart, fun, captivating.  The songs make it so easy to learn the material.  My six year old sings the songs even when the tv is not on!  This is tv that I do not feel guilty letting my kids watch.  I have also loaned my kids' teachers the dvds so they can show the class during indoor recess days (and it makes a wonderful end of year teacher gift, by the way!).
Thank you, Rachel Coleman, for continuing to make quality programs!",1431043200,,557,4.158878504672897
8687261,5,B00PB47IMS,"We have them all!  They are fantastic. My daughter is hearing, but we've used the signing time series from birth.  This series is educational and fun, with some signing thrown in to boot!  I buy them for all of my friends with young kids.",1431043200,,238,4.363636363636363
8687262,5,B00PB47IMS,"We are so impressed with TreeSchoolers! It is educational and fun. Our kids love to watch it and we don't feel guilty about screen time. My 4.5 year old and 2 year old both love TreeSchoolers and know all the songs. Our favorite is Insects are incredible... ""an insect has two antennae, an insect has 6 legs, an insect has a head..."" They are singing these fun songs and learning at the same time.",1430265600,,397,4.378378378378378
8687263,5,B00PB47IMS,"My daughter loves all the TreeSchooler videos  and CDs. Her dad and I love all that she is leaning and that these products are encouraging her to develop a love of learning. We have enjoyed all of the Baby Signing Time and Signing Time videos, CDs and books over the years as well. Our daughter is almost 6 and has Down syndrome and these videos have helped her learn to communicate with both sign and speech. Thanks Rachel and Two Little Hand Productions!!!",1430265600,,458,4.518072289156627
8687264,5,B00PB47IMS,"My oldest grew up with Signing Time, so when I saw a new series by Rachel Coleman I didn't hesitate to support it on Kickstarter.  I wasn't disappointed.  My son is now 7 and he still goes back to Treeschoolers to review when a similar subject comes up at school.  He loves to learn the songs and remember them to teach other kids in his class.
What I like best is that these shows aren't ""watch once and forget"" at all.  My youngest is now 2 years old, and he loves to watch Treeschoolers with his big brother.  They each get something different out of it, but both are enthusiastic repeat watchers.",1430265600,,600,4.321428571428571
