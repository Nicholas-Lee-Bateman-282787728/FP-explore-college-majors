5657236,5,B00BNADXJ6,I gave this to my husband and he loved this!  It was a great gift!  Any Baltimore Ravens fan will love this!,1373414400,,108,3.8636363636363638
5657237,5,B00BNADXJ6,This is a must have for all Ravens fans. Glad this set was released in blu-ray. The qualties are amazing!,1373068800,,105,4.3
5657238,5,B00BNADXJ6,"I'm a huge Ravens' fan. This Ravens' team was not the best one that they've ever put on the field. Injuries and age at key positions had made them seem vulnerable. Their defense, customarily ranked in the NFL's Top 10, finished 17th, and at one point had been as low as 28th. The unit was one of the oldest, and slowest in the league. On offense, QB Joe Flacco was considered almost a liability and the biggest obstacle to victory.

The Ravens were huge underdogs to the Denver Broncos, who had beaten them handily in Baltimore only a few weeks before, and the New England Patriots, who had lost to them by one point in Week 3 of the regular season. They were underdogs to the 49ers in the Super Bowl. If they'd had to play the Colts in Indianapolis, they'd likely have been underdogs in that game as well.

The Ravens rose up as one, and overcame all of their shortcomings. Ray Lewis' last dance in Baltimore. The Mile High Miracle. the exorcism of the ghosts of New England playoff defeats past, Flacco's historic playoff performance (11 touchdown passes with zero interceptions to match Joe Montana), and the odd spectacle of the blackout in New Orleans. It's all here.",1372809600,,1172,4.576190476190476
5657239,5,B00BNADXJ6,Sound and picture quality were great would recommend to any ravens fan. Rewatch the unexpected trip back to the championship,1372464000,,124,5.25
5657240,5,B00BNADXJ6,"How can you say you're a Ravens fan and not have this DVD set? Not just highlights, but all 4 games play-by-play. A historic postseason with one of the best Divisional games in years now remembered as the Mile High Miracle. Now all we have to do is get another one in 2013!!",1372032000,4,274,4.188679245283019
5657241,5,B00BNADXJ6,What a thrilling end  for our Superbowl Champions season!  Last minute heroics on defense to clinch the title.  The only thing missing from these discs are the extended celebrations for winning each game.  They could have put them in as special features.,1371945600,2,254,4.976190476190476
5657242,5,B00BNADXJ6,"this collection contains each of the ravens four playoff games in their entirety. vs the colts, broncos, patriots, and 49ers, they're all here from kickoff to the end.

each disc contains one game, but no special features or anything like that. Each disc ends right after each game, so don't expect to see any post game or pregame interviews or anything like that. They also cut out the 30 minute power delay in the superbowl game, beacause who wants to see that anyway.

I bought this for my dad, since he loves the ravens and he couldn't be happier.
This is just like the Greatest game series; 2000 Ravens, and they are both great buys for any Baltimore Ravens fan.",1371600000,4,667,4.55
5657243,5,B00BNADXJ6,"All 4 broadcasts are in hi definition quality. The crisp picture and sound are incredible. You can actually hear some of the hits better than the original broadcast. Maybe because it was so loud at my house during the game. :) A must own for any Ravens fan. It is set up like NFL Replay where one down is right after another....no senseless amounts of talking and watching the players walking around or standing around waiting for the next play. The intensity is there on every game even though you know the outcome. After watching these without being so uptight when they were originally broadcast, you wonder how the Ravens got past Denver. Unreal game. Its all there. Replays are shown on spectacular plays as well.",1370908800,2,718,4.7063492063492065
5657244,4,B00BNADXJ6,"This set includes the 4 games that made up the Playoff Run to Super Bowl 47. Each DVD has one game. These are the complete TV broadcasts without the commercials.

This DVD set is a Ravens fans dream! Watch the UNDERDOG Ravens mow down the Colts, then send the top seeded Broncos to ""one and done"". Then up to Foxboro to exorcise the demons. And finally, cap it all off with one of the most exciting Super Bowl games ever.

I cannot go 5 stars because we get no additional coverage or special features at all. It's the games only. No coins tosses, no player intros, no halftime analysis, no post game, no locker room, and no press conference out takes. Nothing. It's the games, the whole games and nothing but the games. The video quality (non blue ray) is good but not great.

The Colts, Patriots and San Francisco games are announced by Phil Sims and Jim Nance and the Dever game has Dan Dierdorf and Greg Gumbel at the mike.

As a lifelong Baltimore football fan (yes an old Colts fan too) I must say without hesitation that the win in Denver is now, The Greatest Game Ever Played! The Denver game will be watched by me at least 10 times a year until I die.

This set has it all!

1) Rays last game at M&T
2) Rays, last ""Squirrel Dance"" on the last snap of the Colts game.
3) The Denver game, what I now call the ""Greatest Game Ever Played""
4) Tom Brady leaving the field in disgust after being spanked by the 9.5 point underdog Ravens. (Did anyone ever believe that Vegas line?) The look on Tom Brady's face throughout the 2nd half is worth twice the price of this set!
5) Jacoby Jones catch versus Denver, and 2 Superbowl TDs
6) The goal line stand for the ages to clinch the World Championship that Baltimore fans will NEVER forget.
7) Flacco...Flacco...and more Flacco liberally sprinkled throughout!

In the Colts game we get Ray's last dance in Crabtown as the Ravens get a business-like win over the upstart Colts. Andrew Luck was running for his life all day and the Ravens say ""Nevermore"" to any Colts touchdown bid.

The Denver game is an incredible game to watch. The lead changes and momentum swings make this the best game ever for Ravens fans,

The Patriots game is a real treasure. While the Ravens are behind at halftime, you can tell the Patriots are being outplayed. It's really fun to watch the Foxboro faithful arrogantly assuming an easy victory, watch in stunned disbelief as Ray, and the boys give up ZERO points in the second half.

The Superbowl features a great 60 minute football game that as we know comes down to the last second. A riveting game full of great plays made by great players.

Each game is a treasure. THIS SET IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST HAVE for EVERY BALTIMORE FAN! Just in time for Father's Day!

Ray Lewis: Thanks for the memories! The greatest on field leader and motivator to ever play, gets the grandest of send-offs.

The number 52 has it's rightful place in Baltimore sports history next to Colts 19, 24, 70, 82, 88, and 89 and Orioles 4, 5, 8, 20, 22, and 33.",1366156800,43,3006,4.414104882459313
5657245,5,B00BNADXJ6,it was so amazing my dad was upset because he thought they were going to lose when the power went out at the stadium and I loved when Joe Flacco was the mvp in the super bowl it was so amazing super bowl against the San Francisco 49ers good thing that the ravens won I also have this dvd but its sad when Ray Lewis the greatest player for the ravens is retiring.,1453939200,,362,3.9726027397260273

5657271,4,B00BNADXJ6,"All the games from the playoff and Super Bowl run. Would have given it the 5th star if it had all of the between plays action, pre and post game action and home town commentary from Sandusky.

5657275,4,B00BNADXJ6,"Wonderful replay of the playoff games.  However, that is all it is.  Nothing before or after the games and outside of what was on television, no analysis of the games.  I especially missed Ray Lewis' reactions after the Denver and SF victories.  However, it was still a joy to see and the video was very good with the games.",1396224000,,324,4.440677966101695

5657278,2,B00BNADXJ6,"The Super Bowl game was cut too short, leaving out the post game celebration! As a Ravens fan. Those were the moments I was to relive over and over.",1394064000,,148,4.137931034482759
5657279,5,B00BNADXJ6,This is a must have for any Baltimore Ravens Fan. Its got all the Playoff games and the Super Bowl. These are straight from TV so nothing really special to note.,1393286400,,161,4.225806451612903
5657280,5,B00BNADXJ6,"I picked this up for Christmas 2013.  I watched all the games save the Wild Card game vs. Indianapolis, which turned out to be Ray Lewis' final home game and the beginning of his final ride, which culminated with his second Super Bowl Championship.  Having these original game broadcasts, in full 1080p high definition video, as they happened during the 2012 postseason, is a fine time capsule en route to any team's title chase and subsequent championship. Re-watching Super Bowl XXXXVII the morning of Super Bowl XXXXVIII helped me to prepare for the action as a lead up that much more!!!  This franchise is one which I respect so much that I decided to pick up, as a companion piece of sorts, besides the Super Bowl XXXXVII Championship Blu-ray Disc, the Greatest Games Series of the 2000 Ravens who went 12-4, and then on a defensive-oriented postseason tangent which culminated in their first Super Bowl championship, winning Super Bowl XXXV 12 years earlier.  Each of these games are full of great memories of that particular time period and I am enough of an NFL game to own as many of these culminations as possible.  Very well done indeed, NFL.  Thanks.",1392681600,,1162,4.785
5657281,5,B00BNADXJ6,"I loved having all of the play off games and super bowl game on DVD, I own it along with the Ravens' 2000 run at the Superbowl series. You get what you pay for... the games, not the games loaded with commercials in between breaks.",1392336000,,230,4.133333333333334
5657282,5,B00BNADXJ6,"Wonderful way of seeing the playoffs again and the Superbowl.  Every play was shown minus commercials, time outs, etc.  It was fun to watch and I will enjoy seeing again a few years down the road!",1391385600,,196,4.416666666666667
5657283,5,B00BNADXJ6,"I bought two copies of this; one for me, and one for my father.  It chronicles the Ravens' run to the Super Bowl in 1080p!",1390435200,,122,3.88
5657284,5,B00BNADXJ6,"If you're a Ravens fan, this is a must have.  Now that the Ravens are out of the playoffs for the 2013 season, I really enjoy being able to re-live last year's glory - in all its glory.  And the best part?  The game moves along more quickly because it doesn't stop for injury timeouts, TV timeouts, etc.  Just pure football!!  This was my best Christmas present!!",1390176000,,363,4.358208955223881
5657288,5,B00BNADXJ6,The Road to the Super Bowl series has always been a great collection of games no matter what team you root for. They should try adding some more behind the scenes features or some interviews/post game press conferences. As a whole though it's a great experience to watch playoff games from a season without a commercial break every 5-10 minutes. I will be buying these for any year I think the games were unforgettable. They make a great and timeless collection. Good to watch now or years down the road with family and friends.,1379376000,,528,4.627659574468085
5657289,5,B00BNADXJ6,Great DVD. Every playoff game minus the commercials. The Denver game was worth the price by itself. If you're a Ravens fan this is a must have.,1378771200,,143,4.333333333333333
5657290,5,B00BNADXJ6,The quality is really good and so is the sound. It;s the Ravens winning a Super Bowl. What more do you need? Best team ever.,1378598400,,124,4.0
5657291,5,B00BNADXJ6,"The blu-ray set is great. I am a huge Ravens fan and wanted the collection of the postseason games to watch for years to come. The picture is great, just as great as watching it live in HD. Only negative is that it is ONLY the game. No pregame coverage at all, first scene is the opening kickoff. But still, you get the game, the whole game, and all of the in-game broadcast without the commercials.",1377993600,,399,4.2631578947368425
5657292,5,B00BNADXJ6,My son enjoyed it for a gift! Good summary of the Ravens Road to the Super Bowl!  Good keepsake for sports fans!,1377820800,,112,4.090909090909091
5657293,5,B00BNADXJ6,I only wish this DVD had post game interviews! But it's great quality and perfect for any Ravens fan that wants to relive the Ray Lewis' final 4 games and more!,1377043200,,160,4.193548387096774

5657295,5,B00BNADXJ6,Re-live every moment of every play-off game without the commercials! Only wish hey had the audio of the WBAL radio team with Jerry Sanduski's play-by-play and Q's & Stan's comments instead of CBS TV audio...priceless! (how does Phil Sims keep his job?) Too bad WBAL 1090AM doesn't put their coverage on CD or their web-site.,1374969600,,324,4.909090909090909
5657296,5,B00BNADXJ6,Very nice in because y'all have the play off games as well as the Super Bowl that made it remarkable,1374796800,,100,4.05
5657297,4,B00BNADXJ6,"The dvds are excellent with one complaint.  The games start & end abruptly.  No pregame conversations, and no post game comments.  Ex, especially after the Denver game.  Double OT, yet game ends almost immediately after field goal is made.  Very long game, and the comments ""One of the gritiest games I'be seen in a long time."". Etc.... It just ends....",1374364800,9,353,4.816666666666666
8571429,2,B00BNADXJ6,I love the Ravens but this video collection is literally just the commercial free games they played. There is no replays of highlighted plays and the commentary is cut short if it continued after the play ended. Thought it would be a documentary/story line of the amazing year the Ravens had and be more personalized. Right now my recordings of those games are more special unfortunately. Still love my Ravens though,1522627200,,416,4.873239436619718

I guess very few people would actually say if they didn't like their gift..

Also, the I don't like the Ravens and regret his decision to be a Ravens fan. Then again, I'm a Jets fan so what can I really say..",1483833600,,256,4.0
