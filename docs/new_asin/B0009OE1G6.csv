2306878,5,B0009OE1G6,This is just what I was looking for. The transaction went very smoothly. Product was in perfect shape. Thanks for making it so easy.,1393027200,,132,4.541666666666667
2306879,5,B0009OE1G6,It is a step to the past and is very well put together for its tme period.  You will enjoy.,1390348800,,91,3.55
2306880,4,B0009OE1G6,"If you like the old classics, this is a good one to buy.  There were commercials in places during the shows, but they were even entertaining.  I was a fan of Topper when I was a child, and enjoyed watching these episodes.",1209168000,,221,4.238095238095238
2306881,1,B0009OE1G6,"While the video portion is great, the audio portion is barely understandable.  On both volumes, you have to make a real effort to be able to discern what's being said.",1204243200,,167,4.566666666666666
2306882,4,B0009OE1G6,"This contains four episodes:
The Proposal 2.19.54
Henrietta Sells the House 4.9.54
Topper Goes to Las Vegas 4.23.54
George's Old Flame 7.2.54
Some have the original comericals left in. (That's the reference to smoking in the other review. And yes people really smoked that much then.) Camel's by the way.
If you are looking for 21st century film, look somewhere else. Picture quality is very good. Sound not too bad. (No it's not surrond sound) The Proposal has the commericals chopped out and it jumps as the picture changes from one scene to another.
Overall they look better than they did when I watched them in the 50's when broadcast.
I think Critics Choice did a good job with what they had to work with.
Would like to have the complete 78 or so episodes....sure beats what's on TV now. Good clean fun with no body count. So if you are under 30 you won't like it.
I would have given 5 stars, but for the price it should have been more episodes (DVD5 disk).",1182816000,11,962,4.502857142857143
2306883,4,B0009OE1G6,"Watching these episodes was like stepping into a time machine and I greatly enjoyed the nostalgia. The quality of the film is much better than I would have expected.

If you remember the originals, watching these again can be a lot of fun. Although I think, to be perfectly honest, the main value is in the memories. I don't see how they would interest viewers for whom the show isn't part of their own past.",1169164800,5,408,4.44
2306884,1,B0009OE1G6,"I love the old Topper movies and kinda remember seeing reruns of the series many years ago on tv.

The first thing I noticed was the strong odor, smelled like the DVD I purchased via Amazon's Gold Box was salvage from a warehouse fire. The quality of the video overall was extremely poor, looked like those old extended play VHS videos, with many sound dropouts. The first episode didn't even play all the way through - the DVD may be damaged, although it looks OK. I tried it in 3 different DVD players. The menu options didn't work correctly either, took a lot of playing around to get it to another episode.

Overall I was disappointed, the show was not too bad, the Camel commercials were amusing but the quality of the DVD made this purchase a very poor decision. Yes , I could probably return it, but the costs of returning it and the hassle of getting a correction far outweighs the cost of the original DVD - next time I will be more careful.",1141084800,68,950,4.392045454545454

8064135,4,B0009OE1G6,"This is a must have for those that lived thought the era. However I was surprised to see so much smoking. Has society change that much that most of the scenes look like one big cigarette commercial? It is hard to see the ghosts through all the smoke.

Although there is a series of Topper movies, this TV series is the Topper I came to know and love. Once in a while I see the actors in other movies and it reminds me of the character he/she played on this movie. Anne Jeffreys as Marion Kerby, can be seen again in the movie ""Boys' Night Out"" (1962) Leo G. Carroll as Cosmo Topper, can be seen again as Rev. Dr. Mosby in ""The Parent Trap"" (1961).

Basic story is that a young fairly modern couple, George and Marion Kerby got caught in an avalanche along with their rescuer St Bernard, Neil. They refused to give up the ghost and went home to live. Turns out that Cosmo toper and his wife Henrietta (Lee Patrick) Bought the Kerby house. Yep now Cosmo can see the Kerby's when they wish and Neil turns out to be a lush. The situation now has its plusses and minuses as everyone becomes one happy family.",1507248000,15,1103,4.247619047619048
