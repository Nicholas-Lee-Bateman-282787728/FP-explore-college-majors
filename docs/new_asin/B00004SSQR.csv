I originally saw it on a PBS fundraiser several years ago, and although I had made a copy then, I wanted to get one for a friend of mine with whom I was in a female ""beauty shopper"" quartette many, many years ago (remember the Chordettes?, well that wasn't us, but we had then for inspiration).  My friend lives a distance from me so I had never shared it with her. I was absolutely thrilled to find a copy.  You don't have to be a barbershopper or even a singer to enjoy this show.  It is superb in many ways and extremely entertaining.  Everyone, including my small grandchildren, found it most enjoyable.  It is an extraordinarily well done recording.  We all loved it and you will, too, if you get it.  It will sometimes make you laugh, always impress you with the talent displayed, and if you ARE or have been a barbershopper, it may even bring a nostalgic tear or two as it did for me and my friend.",1305158400,,953,4.350282485875706

They are so amazingly talented, and entertaining--I could watch this video every day.  It's also very interesting to see the process that they all go through preparing for competition, and then competing.  If you are a fan of barbershop, and you have always wanted to see these amazing groups in action, you must have this!!",1060473600,2,425,4.716216216216216
