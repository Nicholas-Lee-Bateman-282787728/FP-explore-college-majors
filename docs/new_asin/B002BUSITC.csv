Besides being a fantastic set of DVD's, the company has top notch customer service.  I get responses within 24 hours to any questions and have had something replaced which shipped the same day I requested it.",1248134400,2,302,4.574074074074074
8361962,1,B002BUSITC,Not what I expected.  It's a big disappointment.  Save your money.,1427932800,,66,4.909090909090909
8361963,3,B002BUSITC,"did not like the part one video at all,  this second one better.  But they are kind of boring.  I do like his technique of dehydrating the veggies, and grinding to make seasonings.  But,  to be honest,  if I had not ordered at same time,  would probably not have ordered the second one.  I also ordered his third DVD at same time,  and feel somewhat more encouraged,  as it is much improved, enjoyable,  and had some things to learn in it.",1416009600,,439,4.296296296296297
8361964,4,B002BUSITC,"The real value of this DVD is that it gives you ideas of what delicious raw foods you can prepare when you invite people for dinner, or go to parties, potlucks etc.  Maybe you just want to have something special for your birthday :) You don't need to feel deprived with so many food ideas.  At first I thought I would seldom use these recipes because they seem so rich, but in a few short weeks I have used several ideas already.  So I'm really glad I got both DVDs, even though I think that once I have mastered the techniques I will probably watch this DVD less than #1. It's a good one to share with friends after they compliment you on your scrumptious fruit pies!",1250121600,7,668,4.244094488188976
8361965,5,B002BUSITC,"Part 2 is a great compliment of part 1.  These two dvd's are of great help.  If you are looking to achieve health by incorporating more fruits and vegetables in your diet, these dvd's are the key.  They are simple and easy to follow with little amount of time and full of valuable information.",1248393600,,293,4.388888888888889
8361966,3,B002BUSITC,"This DVD is a great compliment to the first raw food DVD. While the first DVD was raw foods with no fat, this DVD tells you the kinds of fats to add to your raw food to change the taste and consistency. I have been able to take the information from this DVD and experiment with other recipes to create some very tasty dishes. While I'm very happy that I bought both DVDs, I think all the information could've been contained on one DVD. I would recommend this DVD to someone who's interested in raw foods as there are some great recipes.",1248220800,5,536,4.264705882352941
8361967,5,B002BUSITC,"This dvd goes great with the first one as it adds a little fat to the dishes, showing more possibilities for a healthy raw food diet.  With both, you have the best collection of healthy recipes to help you on your path to great health.",1248220800,,235,4.222222222222222
8361968,5,B002BUSITC,"This DVD is a great complement to Frederic's PART 1 DVD - Low Fat Raw Vegan Cuisine without overt fats.  This DVD is filled with great recipes that use overt fat sources like avocado, nuts, and seeds - including yummy nori rolls and desserts!  I absolutely love the PART 1 DVD, and reserve most of the recipes in this DVD as special treats.

Just like in his first DVD, Frederic is very accessible, and offers variations on every recipe so you can create something you really love.  One of the things I found most helpful was his presentation on how to open a coconut.

If you're interested in the raw vegan lifestyle, or simply adding more fruits and veggies to your diet, do not pass up this DVD and its complement (PART 1).  Absolutely fantastic resource!",1248134400,2,758,4.536764705882353
8361969,5,B002BUSITC,"Fred, I cannot thank you enough for part 2 DVD. I have used both and am particularly fund of the Low-fat DVD, though of course the 2nd I tend to use the most.

Thank you for your honest and direct approach to being healthy on the raw diet. My health has improved tremendously due to your support.

8361970,5,B002BUSITC,"Of all the plethora of books, magazines, articles, web information, etc. that I have collected over the last couple of years, Frederic Patenaude's recently released DVD/Part 2 is by FAR the best information I've received so far.  Simple, to the point and easy to follow, this DVD is a pleasure to watch and helps you easily incorporate the raw food diet as your normal lifestyle.  Many thanks--I can't wait for the next ones to come out!!",1248134400,4,438,4.75
