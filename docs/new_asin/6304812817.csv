930225,2,6304812817,"The staff of the clothing section of a department store all go on holiday to the Costa Plonka. A spin off movie of the famous 1970s British sitcom series of the same name is little more than an extension of a standard episode of the seires only it looks slightly more realsitic being made in film. Humphries causes some amusement as his overly camp and flamboyant character, whilst Mollie sugeden gets a few of the laughs too. The film really lacks any sort of direction and never once are you treated to outdoor, exotic locations. so basically all of the action takes place in the hotel. Rather like a substandard Carry On film. Fans will undoubtedly be delighted whilst people unfamiliar with the series will remain unamused. On the whole, mediocre at the most with a few laughs along the way but in all honest the whole thing seems terribly dated now. Recommended to fans of the series regardless.",978998400,5,900,4.666666666666667
930226,4,6304812817,"Having been a fan of AYBS for a number of years, I eagarly awaited arrival of this video, and the wait did not disappoint me. Old fans and new acquaintances will enjoy this movie once a few guidelines are realized.  First, this is a movie and not a television show. The laughtrack is gone but the set is more realistic and more modern (the store setting, for example, looks like a real store and not a stage prop).  Previous reviews regarding poor sound and lighting quality are perhaps a bit too demanding, as is the complaint that the jokes are straight from the show. I went through the entire movie before I ""remembered the jokes"" -- they flow through the movie well.  Second, please remember that this is AYBS, its not supposed to be realistic as no good comedy is. The original cast is here, in their youthful, energetic selves. Its only fault, in my opinion, is that there's a lengthy delay before they get into the trip itself, but this is only a minor problem.  I would recommend this video to anyone, providing that they judge the movie by its own standards and not compare it to the show.",972777600,77,1099,4.48

930228,2,6304812817,"This movie was so disappointing... The lighting, and the loss of the laugh track... Are You Being Served? is a loud show, the laugh track keeps the feeling of tension and fun going.. they try to replace it with some awful  carnival music, but it just doesn't work. If I had money and a time  machine, I would go back in time and fix the lighting, the sets, and either  put in a laugh track, or film this live. I still love the show and I don't  know why they didn't pay attention to the lighting or sound... It is a  tragedy! The lines are good but you will need a creative imagnination to  make this film work!",950054400,11,611,4.135593220338983
930229,4,6304812817,"Originally I found the AYBS movie a bit weak. Many of the jokes are repeated from the episodes, and the store looks different. Also, the plot is a little far-fetched. However, after viewing it several times (thanks to occasional boring Ohio winter days), I came to appreciate it much more. In fact I was laughing hysterically after watching it the third time.
The original cast is there, plus a few extras. The holiday to Spain idea is pretty creative, since we always hear the cast talk about holidays on the show. Certain jokes are new, and they are rather funny. Even if the movie doesn't strike you as original, or even funny, owning the movie is essential for any AYBS fan. Its like owning a piece of history, since the series only ran for 69 episodes.",946857600,24,757,4.573529411764706

Don't buy it.  The jokes are identical from the series, including the whole ""Sexy Knickers"" episode.  There is nothing new that you haven't already seen in the series.  Yes, they may have been removed from the store and sent on a vacation.  But, the story doesn't add anything to the pre-existing dynamic between the characters.

Definitely missing is the Laugh Track or Live Studio Audience feel.  Somehow, the jokes don't seem to be as funny.

930518,4,6304812817,I've been watching the reruns of this show for many years and I still find myself smiling or chuckling in every episode.  The movie didn't disappoint even though some of the gags were rehashed from the TV version.  Somethings are funny more that just the first time you see or hear them.  Good quality dvd.,1217116800,,306,4.527272727272727
930519,2,6304812817,"Really the script isn't bad.  It's very much on par with most of the TV episodes, although it is a shame that so many of the jokes are recycled.  Pacing is a huge problem for the movie, whereas it never was for the TV show.  Maybe the director had never worked in a ""sitcom"" format?  A fast-and-furious AYBS script, when slowed down to the pace and timing of the typical freature film, loses a lot of its charm.  We're given far to much time to think about the holes in the plot.
  The single biggest problem, however, is the lack of a live audience for the antics.  When watching the show, hearing the audience's reactions, and watching the actors respond to them live, is a big part of what keeps the show fresh and funny.  The lack of a live audience keeps the movie stale and decidedly un-funny.  It's too bad, because I think most of the new jokes written for the film would have worked brilliantly on the small screen.  Here, they are wasted.

  P.S.  In response to another review:  I really don't think Mr. Humphries is any more openly gay in this script than in the TV episodes.  While some of the jokes may have been more risque than would have been allowable on British television of the era, none of them clearly imply that he's anything more than a sissy and a mother's boy.  He's not interested in women, but not necessarily gay.",1213056000,2,1343,4.390243902439025

930579,2,6304812817,"The TV show Are You Being Served? has to be one of my all time favorites, and I believe it truly is the funniest British comedy ever on TV.  However, the movie was lacking.

As I first started watching this movie, while they were still in the shop, I noticed that something was lacking, that something about it felt empty.  It was the lack of a laugh track.  Now, in all honesty, most of the time I prefer there not be a laugh track, but in Are You Being Served, a laugh track is essential.  Without the laugh track, the comedic timing of the show was thrown off from the start.

Then, as they get into the movie, the jokes aren't new, and the conflict is predictable and leaves you yearning for it to be over.

If you are a huge fan of AYBS and want to have the complete collection, that is the only reason I would suggest buying this.  It is the only reason I bought it, and the only value I see in it.  There is definitely little (if any) entertainment value.",1173657600,2,962,4.1567567567567565

As a die-hard fan of ""Are You Being Served?"", the moment I began watching the film I knew it was a BOMB. Many familiar storylines from the 'AYBS' series are interwoven into the film but to no avail. Without the presence of a live audience, sharper dialogue...the movie is a disappointment.",1157414400,,338,4.540983606557377
930663,4,6304812817,"I have read the various reviews on here that give this film version a bit of a panning. I note that the reviewers are also mostly from America. I felt it deserved a bit of an explanation from a Brit who saw this film at the movies when it was released and who has had an affectionate view of it ever since.

Back in the 70's it was traditional for many famous TV comedies of the time to get a filmed version released and AYBS was no exception. They were made mainly for domestic consumption - few people back then could ever have envisaged them being made so widely available, especially not in Video or disc format. Almost all of these TV spin-offs were essentially regurgitated episode scripts, with a bit of extra business occasionally thrown in for good measure. They deliberatley cashed in on the tremendous success of the TV series - just imagine it, with sometimes as many as 15 million peple regularly tuning in there was a ready made cinema market for such stuff!

The filmed version of AYBS is therefore different in feel - mainly due to the absence of a studio audience (the BBC did not use laughter tracks at that time - if they ever have!). There are some very, very funny performances in the film though - especially Mrs Slocombe getting her ""jacksie full of vaccine"" and getting her passport photo taken. From a UK perspective it is also funny as it shows up our tiny island's wonderfully parochial attitude to foreigners and 'going abroad' for a holiday; something that was still in its relative infancy at that time. It's more of a time capsule than the TV series is.

I would ask that you all give this film a second chance - it isn't as bad as some people have said on here, it's just different. The performances are still wonderful. Watch and enjoy if only to laugh at how gloriously pompous us Brits can be when we talk about our fellow European neighbours!

I have watched it more times than I care to remember - and it makes me laugh every time!",1118275200,193,1968,4.443213296398892

It is almost amazing that the entire, original cast could be in this and it is so bad. The live studio laughter from the TV show gave the actors something to feed off of. This is not here in this movie and makes it(And them) very dull. And yes, the television show (1973-1985) was recorded live, and did not use a laugh track. Even a phoney, pre recorded laugh track could have done this film some good. If anything this film proves a goog joke is so much better in front of a live crowd. They feed off you and you feed off them. It is a natural human response to laugh when you hear others laughing first. Also, many of the bits are old jokes they did in the series and none of them are as funny here. Actually none of them are.

It has it's funny moments, Captain Peacock and Mrs. Slcombe in the photo booth, Mr. Humpheries as a nun, etc.  One thing that bugs me though is it seems b/c of the popularity of the show at the time, they put no care into making this movie, they thought it would do fine either way.  The store set in the beginning isn't the same as the one on the show, the screenwriters missed some places where gags or jokes about the characters could have been added, their tent city at the hotel looks like their studio's back-lot, and they don't take enough time to develop the story, though, you want it to get over soon, b/c it's pretty boring.

930667,3,6304812817,"""Are You Being Served? The Movie"" had enormous potential; sadly the film didn't manage to reach that potential. Instead of putting our favorite staff members from Grace Bros. into new situations Lloyd and Croft simply re-worked several former episodes, such as ""A Change is as Good as a Rest"" and ""Dear Sexy Knickers."" Add to this the oft-used-in-the-series plot device of the closing of the store and the staff going on holiday (in this case to Costa Plonka), paid for by the Head of the Firm Young Mr. Grace; though they used this idea of the store closing for renovations and Young Mr. Grace copping for the staff to go on holiday in the interim a couple of times in the series, they never actually did an episode where we actually saw the staff on holiday, thus it could have worked in the Movie if done differently.

Nevertheless the first half of the film is fairly good in spite of the re-used gags and plot-devices; we get to see a bit more of the store, such as a view of the Ladies' and Gents' Dept. from the lift looking down the stairs (a view which if memory serves we never got to see in the series); the photo booth; and the Continental Beauty Salon-though where was the famed Madame Beryl? I'm not sure how the film, containing these re-worked plot elements, would fit into a timeline of the series. Perhaps the producers Lloyd and Croft were trying to appeal to audiences unfamiliar with the series.

The abscence of a laugh track was interesting, though admittedly a laugh track might have helped the film which drags during much of the hotel scenes. Great potential, but the film just didn't deliver; Lloyd and Croft are capable of much better. Unfortunately ""Are You Being Served? the Movie"" is just dead common. Of course it was great seeing our favorite dept. store staff in a feature film, so if you're a serious fan of the show you'll want this, otherwise you should probably skip it.

In other words, it was very boring with hardly a laugh anywhere.

Possibly the biggest mistake is taking the characters out of their natural element:  Grace Brothers Department Store.  Granted, at the time, the writers must have thought they needed to do so in order to expand the scope for a film.  I'm sure that they were correct, in part.  But the way in which they took the characters out of the store is pitifully lacking.
Grumpy, tipsey Mrs. Slocumb; fey Mr. Humphreys; superior Captain Peacock; dottering Mr. Grainger; sexy but common Miss Brahms; randy Mr. Lucas; and jug-eared Mr. Rumbold are very lovable and very loved characters.  Add in cockney and sly Mr. Harmon and you've got a recipe for hilarity.
Sadly ""The Movie"" doesn't really deliver on that.  The beginning of the movie is the funniest - it is set in the department store.  It is also slightly surreal as we are introduced to the characters as if we were seeing them for the first time and as if they didn't already have a history with each other.  (Since the movie is a spin-off of the highly popular television series, this introduction seems unwarranted).
The premise is that the store must close and Mr. Grace has sprung for a vacation for the department to go to Costa Plonka in Spain.  Sound familiar?  Of course it does.  It was a premise of one of the episodes.  Once there the staff is relegated to staying in tents in the garden of the hotel.  Sound familiar?  It's another episode.  (the whole Mrs. Slocumb and the flatulant air mattress is even included). Mr. Humphrey's dons women's clothing; and Mr. Harmon outsmarts everyone.
Basically what I'm saying is that there is no real new material here......except for the finale....and that ain't good news.
Why, oh why, anyone would find it funny having a revolutionary general beginning his insurrection in the hotel?  Not only does it not make a lick of sense pragmatically, but comically it is the death knell for the movie.
There is one thing that the movie did that the series never did:  Mr. Humphreys is definitely gay in the movie, but it was always a source of fun speculation in the series.  It's a mistake.
Though written by the same writers as the series, it seems to have taken all the things that were wrong in the series and used them to make the film.  Gone is the banter at the ubiquitous ""staff meetings"" or the ""canteen lunches"".  Instead, the writers miss the chance at an al fresco dinner to do the same.  Mr. Grainger was always a source of hilarity with his dottering ways - and yet here he's almost written as an afterthought.
I don't understand the mistake with this movie.  In 1977 the series was still in production and was quite funny.  What happened here?  I speculate that the writers didn't have the time to really give the time necessary to the film.
I bought this DVD without having ever seen the film.  I don't regret it as it is part of what I consider my AYBS collection, but if you want to get your first taste of this phenonomenal series by seeing the movie first - DON'T!  Watch the episodes on your local PBS station here in the U.S. or rent the episodes or buy them at your local store or here on Amazon.  Each one is a gem, though as with any show - some are better than others.  However, not a single one of them is bad - something I cannot say about this film.
It's really a shame.  ""And I'm unanimous in that!""",1031788800,110,3583,4.5186335403726705
930670,5,6304812817,"Having been an Are You Being Served fan for 10 years, I am thrilled to see the AYBS? movie finally arrive on DVD. The picture quality looks great; the widescreen presentation along with the crisp colors are beautiful. The sound seems a bit quiet at times, but that seems to be due more to the actors' understated delivery of dialog than any technical deficiency.
The disc is lacking of any special features save for a theatrical trailer and chapter selection menu. I think though, for any true AYBS? fan, the sheer fact that this (in the past) hard to find film is on a fabulous looking DVD is more than enough.",1026259200,9,611,4.513513513513513
930671,3,6304812817,"This is the 1977 movie version of that venerable old Britcom, ""Are You Being Served?"", the staple of so many public television pledge drives. Deservedly so, for the series is hilarious even after multiple viewings.
After 1977, several cast changes occurred on the show, including the loss of Young Mr. Grace, old Churchill-esque Mr. Granger, and worst of all, the randy Mr. Lucas. Each was replaced on the show by a series of less-than-adequate stand-ins. So in a way, the movie serves as a snapshot of the series up to that point. It was at this time that the cast was both the best and at it's peak.
In the story, Grace Brothers is closing for remodeling. The only way to get the entire staff to agree to take their vacations at the same time is for Mr. Grace to provide holiday packages for each department.
While the film is a fun romp, it just isn't up to the standards of a typical episode. The cast certainly tries their best, and a lot of mileage is gotten out of John Inman's character, Mr. Humphries. Trevor Bannister is also in top form as the swinging Mr. Lucas, as is the rest of our much-loved cast.
But, something is just not quite right.
The first problem the fan may notice is that, without the live audience (and even to a degree, taping the action on video), the ambiance of the show is somewhat missing from the film. Think of watching your favorite sitcom without a laugh track... it's just strange.
Second, we've seen some of these routines before (the ""Dear Sexy Knickers"" letter, for instance). Happily, this sort of rehashing of material is kept to a minimum, and is understandable since the routines were so popular.
Third, and probably most damaging, is that the cast is removed from their natural environment, Grace Brothers' Department Store. Only the first ten minutes or so are placed in the store with what looks like similar (but not original), sets from the show (in fact, the sets look strangely even more cheap than the ones used for TV!). The balance of the film is set in Costa Plonka, a banana republic holiday resort perpetually in a state of revolution.
All in all, it just doesn't work. The movie, on the whole, turns out to be both fun and somewhat flat. Removing the cast from Grace Brothers may have seemed like the only solution for a film version, but it might have been better to have a series of vignettes that take us through a typical day at Grace Brothers.
This is a must see film for the ""AYBS?"" fan, but it may also be a bit disappointing. Full marks for the cast, but only a C- for the material they had to work with.",1023667200,10,2572,4.497863247863248
