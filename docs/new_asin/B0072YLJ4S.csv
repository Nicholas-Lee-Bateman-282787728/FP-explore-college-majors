5053177,5,B0072YLJ4S,I bought this dvd for praise music for the preschool class I teach at church and the children love it.  They like watching the videos as well as singing along to the songs.  Many of the songs are upbeat so the kids can dance and do motions with the music.  It is one of the best praise videos I have seen for preschool age kids.,1377561600,3,328,4.015384615384615
5053178,3,B0072YLJ4S,We love the songs but the video portion isn't very engaging to my girls.....we would have been better off buying just the cd version.,1357862400,,133,4.583333333333333

Except they have an Easter song, which is not Christian.  It's pagan.  The vey name EASTER derived from goddess of fertility, ISHTAR.

That's where the painted eggs come from.  IT DOESN'T MATTER if you do it ""in the name of Jesus"".  God is a jealous God and you cannot slap His name on false gods and festivals and think He doesn't care.  Several verse back this up.

Besides, Jesus resurrection is the feast of first fruits, was in grave on feast of unlevened bread, and His death is Passover.  Celebrate BIBLICALLY and be truly blessed.

OTHER THAN THAT, these songs are fantastic!",1527292800,,604,4.730769230769231

8509091,4,B0072YLJ4S,My preschoolers love the songs. My only complaint is that I was hoping for action motions to the song but the dvd is completely animated. I put it on the tv while the children play. Occasionally the animation will catch their attention. The songs are all fun and lively.,1426896000,2,270,4.530612244897959
