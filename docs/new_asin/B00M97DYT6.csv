He has a Samsung blue ray player. As soon as he put the dvd in, it gets spit back out and we get a message saying the Blu-ray player cant play that format of dvd. Um what? We put the second disc in, hoping it was just the first one that was an issue. But nope, same thing. We tried the DVD player in our living room, and same issue. Then we tried my PS4 in my bedroom and FINALLY IT WORKED. But now my son has to sit in my bedroom every time he wants to watch this show. Its so annoying. What format could it possibly be that none of my DVD players could play?",1522195200,,711,3.778523489932886
8670829,5,B00M97DYT6,"This series is a lot deeper than most people suspect. Hatty is a Time-Lord in hiding as a museum curator, trapped in a time loop and reliving the same day over and over. To alleviate the boredom she creates new displays to show off some aspect from the time of the dinosaurs. Shortly before the loop began Andy stumbled upon Hatty's TARDIS disguised as am old grandfather clock that no one ever seems to notice appearing and disappearing behind its perception filter.

Realizing this potential, Hatty uses his bumbling and accident-prone tendencies to set him up to go and fetch the perfect finishing touches from each respective time period. Not without heart, she makes sure Andy has exactly what he needs to survive among the equipment he 'pilfers' from her. Be it a wrist-mounted gizmo linked to the Clock's data banks or the backpack that always seems to have the perfect item to escape any situation in a style even the Doctor would approve of, no matter how big it is....

Later on in the series Hatty disappears, leaving Andy her TARDIS as time once again flows through the museum. Lets just hope everything worked out and that the Silurians aren't involved, after all, we don't want to turn into dinosaurs ourselves, do we?",1499644800,,1232,4.752336448598131
8670830,1,B00M97DYT6,"Apparently this DVD only works in European DVD players. That might be obvious some, but for me that was definitely not. They will not issue a return or refund, and I get it as they were compliant in their own opinion. However it was a major disappointment with lots and lots of tears for my boys at my house. Wish  it was easier to get Andy's dinosaur Adventures DVDs for my boys. Oh well. Major disappointment.",1498176000,,411,4.407894736842105
