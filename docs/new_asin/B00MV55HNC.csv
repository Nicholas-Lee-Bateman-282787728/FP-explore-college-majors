6602333,5,B00MV55HNC,Bought this cause Walmart ran out by the time I realized they had exclusive for $20 it's def worth the money one of the great shows from my childhood I would def recommend!!!,1416268800,,174,4.303030303030303
6602334,5,B00MV55HNC,Came right on time! Love it!,1415750400,,28,3.8333333333333335
6602335,5,B00MV55HNC,"Let me just say it, Hey Arnold! is one of my favorite shows from my childhood. The show was funny, the characters were great, it taught lessons and it just made you feel emotions that a cartoon wouldn't always make you feel. I can go on and on about how this is such a good show but the main point here is if this complete series pack is worth it or not.

I always wanted to buy this show on the season DVDs, but the prices were a bit too much for me to pay for. I also was a bit hesitate about buying them because I didn't hear a whole lot of good things about Amazon's create space program. But it was Shout Factory who released this and the other season packs. I'll go on the record to say that I LOVE Shout Factory as they have done many well done or at least pretty good releases with movies and t.v shows. So you wouldn't believe how happy I was when I found this, I was just god smacked that they will release this show in a complete pack for a really affordable price.

The contains all of the 100 episodes of the show even though it says it has all 99, some of the episodes are out of order but not really a deal breaker as this is the kind of show that you can watch out of order and still enjoy it. All the DVDs featured are from the season DVDs also from Shout Factory and they are just rock solid. The quality is great through out all of the discs, Arnold still looks as good as he did 9 years ago. There are no special features at all but that's not really a big deal since the show it self is so good.

Really this Collection here is a must own for those who haven't bought the previous season releases. If you want relive those childhood with our old friend foot head, or if you haven't seen it and want to give it try, What are you waiting for? Buy it now!! You won't regret it:)",1414454400,6,1796,3.9833333333333334
6602336,5,B00MV55HNC,This is such a blast from the past.  We loved it.,1413158400,2,49,3.4545454545454546
6602337,5,B00MV55HNC,"It arrived on time and I was so excited to get this. I loved this show as a kid and now it's all together in one set, and the picture/audio is great considering it's an older show. The price wasn't bad either. This was a terrific find and recommend it to anyone else looking for this where it's not overpriced.",1411430400,2,310,4.183333333333334
6602338,5,B00MV55HNC,Hey Arnold is one of my favorite shows and this DVD set is awesome. You can buy this exact DVD set for under $20 at Walmart which is where I bought this. It's honestly a really good DVD set and I'm so happy I now am able to own the entire series! I love it and definitely worth the $20 for sure.,1411171200,3,295,3.774193548387097
6602339,5,B00MV55HNC,This a fantastic release and the best Hey Arnold! has ever looked. You get every episode of the series spread over 16 discs. Audio and picture is excellent. It's a WalMart exclusive and I got mine for $18.96 so don't get tricked into overpaying for this.,1409875200,16,254,4.543478260869565
6602340,5,B00MV55HNC,"So glad it's together in one set now. Hopefully they will do the same with other Nick shows. Remember people... You are reviewing the set, not the price people are selling it for. I almost didn't buy it because I seen the low rating.",1409270400,12,233,4.318181818181818
6602341,4,B00MV55HNC,"Ok, first of all, this is a Walmart exclusive release, and you can get it for under $20 in store (unless it's gone up after release week) or under $30 on their website once it's back in stock... so ignore the people being greedy trying to trick you into paying $49+ for this!

That being said, this was one of my favorite cartoons when I was a kid so when I found out about this I was extremely happy and then found out about the (Walmart) price and had to pick it up ASAP considering each individual title is $15+ by itself. The episode menu can be a tad confusing because, with the exception of the holiday episodes and other various special double length episodes, each episode is split into two segments but on the Season 1 discs, the menu shows each segment as it's own episode (episode numbers are not used) and can be viewed as such. I.e., selecting the first segment will play and will continue into the second segment without having to select it on the menu as it should be since it's one complete episode, or picking the second segment by itself will jump directly to it within the episode. This continues into the Season 2 Part 1 and 2 discs, however they are now correctly listed as one episode but each segment can be viewed separately if desired. Once you get seasons 3-5, the the episodes are only viewable as a whole and no longer split into separate segment viewing options. The packaging is fine for what it is, it's 16 discs so you get a slipbox with two large DVD cases that hold 8 discs each but the DVDs themselves are the same as the individual sets just all packaged together. The only downside to this set is that the movie isn't included, but it's understandable that it's not. Also, the sticker on the plastic wrap states it has all 99 episodes, but if you look it up  you'll see 100 episodes listed. This is due to Shout! counting ""The Journal"" a one episode instead of two in their listings, even though it's referred to as "" The Journal (Parts 1 & 2)"", but they are included as two separate episodes on the disc so you will still be getting every episode in the series.

Overall, this is a great set to get for yourself for nostalgia purposes or to possibly share with any younger family members or kids of your own now. So, If you are a fan of mid-late 90s era Nickelodeon cartoons or a fan of this particular show, you should seriously consider going to Walmart (sorry amazon, I'm not promoting people gouging the prices to try and trick people) and picking up a copy for yourself!",1409184000,89,2513,4.388412017167382

6602357,5,B00MV55HNC,Hey Arnold was one of my favorite shows growing up and I still love it to this day.  Having the complete series on DVD in a box set is great.  I bought this when I got impatient waiting for my Walmart to get the complete series.  It was more expensive but I just couldn't wait.  Oddly enough not long after I ordered this my Walmart finally had it and it was cheaper.  Thats alright though Im just glad to have it.  You can pretty much get it anywhere now for close to the same price and its usually under 20 bucks not bad for a series containing 100 episodes.  The box set also comes with a neat little poster.  I recommend this box set to anyone who loves Hey Arnold.  If you have the season sets though youd be okay as I don't think the box set contains anything extra other than the poster.  I ultimately bought the box set because the last season was more expensive by itself to get than the box set was so thats ultimately why I got it.  I just recently re watched the whole series before the Jungle Movie came out and it was amazing.  The series finally feels complete now that the Jungle Movie came out.  By the way its been confirmed By Craig Bartlett the creator of Hey Arnold that the Jungle Movie is also coming to DVD.  I cant wait!  The movie was AMAZING and my collection will be complete once its out in physical form.,1512086400,,1334,4.176470588235294
6602358,5,B00MV55HNC,"Hey Arnold one of my favorite childhood shows so I wanted it on DVD so I could always have a physical copy.

The first disc collection sound was great, but the second disc collection sound was low and required you to turn up the volume.  Interestingly, the intros between each episode had good sound which means you needed to adjust the volume frequently.  Further, the episode order was off which is not such a big deal, but each disc was labeled as disc 1&2 which means there is no way of knowing the order of dvds  in relation to the box set description.

If you're lucky enough (and a lot of people are) you can get this set at $20, which is how much I got this for! The set includes all of the individual Shout Factory Hey Arnold! Season DVD sets in 2 cases inside a box. If you order from Amazon.com, you get a free additional Hey Arnold! poster, which is a much bigger version of the back art, but a bit revised and awesome! Sometimes you'll get black cases instead of the normal clear cases, but don't worry, there's a replacement program.

6602431,5,B00MV55HNC,"Hey Arnold is a laid-back, lighthearted look at urban life seen through the eyes of several 4th-grade students. There's Arnold, the eponymous football head, who always puts his friends first and is ready to help. Gerald, Arnold's best friend, lives in a close-knit family with an older brother, younger sister and caring though sometimes exasperating parents. Harold is the class jock and takes out his frustrations on his weaker classmates, but there's a sting in his tail that causes him to act out. Phoebe is the class brain, and frequently helps bail her best friend Helga out of trouble when her impulsive escapades threaten to run out of control. Eugene seems to have been born on Friday the 13th, as the dark cloud of his horoscope tends to drag him and his companions into unfortunate situations.

The characters are unique, motley and memorable. This collection includes all 104 episodes that comprise the five seasons. Most episodes are split into two adventures, which is perfect for young children, since their attention spans have not naturally expanded to understand and appreciate longer stories. This is a benefit in many ways, since there is no ""filler"" that pads out stories that can be told in minutes. The tales are crisp and concise, which keeps them from getting boring.

Also, despite being a re-release several years after the DVDs were originally made, this edition is still bereft of subtitles.",1464393600,,1420,5.038297872340426
6602432,5,B00MV55HNC,"I bought this set at walmart after watching random episodes on youtube and wanting the whole seasons. Man am I glad I did! Hey Arnold was a fantastic cartoon during the 90's and it still is today almost 20 years later. I really love how it manages to teach moral stories with lots of humor and emotion as well as adult humor mixed in. It is a great show to watch just to unwind after a long day and enjoy good memories. My favorite episodes are: Helga on the Couch, Arnold's Valentine, Biosquare, Arnold's Christmas(arguably one of the BEST Christmas episodes of any tv show ever), Egg Story, Parents Day, Arnold Visits Arnie, April Fools Day and of course Married. See a pattern? This show has a great depth and beautiful animation as well as great jazz music thanks to Jim Lang. I would certainly tell everyone to not hesitate and just BUY it! You won't regret that you did and you can use this for all ages as great, clean entertainment. Hopefully Nick and Craig Bartlett will finish The Jungle Movie in the next year and maybe just maybe we will get more of our favorite football head and his lovable crazy love Helga Pataki! Maybe just maybe all the petitions and wishes and prayers will pay off in the end. ;)",1464134400,,1215,4.452914798206278

6602459,5,B00MV55HNC,"Of all the 90's Nickelodeon cartoons, Hey Arnold continues to be my favorite. Though I advise you to look for it at Wal-Mart before purchasing it from Amazon. The complete series is only $20 there (as well as Angry Beavers and Wild Thornberries).

Hey Arnold's episodic series is full of stories and themes for every age. It's amazing how many emotional, developmental and social issues were tackled on this show. Though it does tailspin during the final season. I feel the series is better if you stop before the show covers what happened to Arnold's parents. Between those plots and Arnold's last voice-actor, season five is hard to finish.

The animation is fairly simplistic in the beginning of season one; that's to be expected. That quickly and drastically changes. Settings are gorgeous and characters are uniquely modeled. This show is beautiful.

It's a must-have. If you're just starting to collect classic cartoons, I suggest you start with Hey Arnold! I'd also suggest looking for it in stores while it's still $20 there. I'm sure it'll have a price-hike once the reboot is made.",1453334400,,1091,4.950819672131147

I know some might find that pathetic but it really gets me emotional sometimes. I feel many kids shows today are just retarded with no real meaning to them. Although the 90's had inappropriate and retarded cartoons, it isn't as bad as the cartoons on today. Some 90's cartoons to SKIP are Rocko's Modern Life, Ren and Stimpy, Cow and Chicken, Ed Edd N Eddy. It is ok for a cartoon to be fun without meaning but it seems that is the MAJORITY of what play on TV. Kids seem to grow up retarded and disrespectful. I think there should be some sort of balance of cartoons. I would like to see more cartoons like Hey Arnold and less cartoons like Teen Titans Go! and Sonic Boom (I loved Sonic before the first Wii U game came out. Sonic sucks now). Along with Hey Arnold, another favorite is Doug. I use to like As Told By Ginger a lot too but don't remember much about it.

6602488,3,B00MV55HNC,"In every generation, there's a show, song or movie that you can remember like the back of your hand, and sticks with you into your adult life. One of those shows is Nickelodeon's Hey Arnold!, one of Nickelodeon's famed NickToons, was released during the late 1990s-early 2000s at the latter part of the network's ""Golden Age"" of children's programs.
It follows the adventures of 9-year-old Arnold as he lives his adventurous (and always hilarious) days.  His supporting cast is something to laugh at: Arnold's eccentric grandparents (""Steely"" Phil and his wife, Pookie), the boarders of Arnold's grandpa's boardinghouse (the diminutive construction worker Ernie Potts, the mysterious Mr. Smith, the country-singing Vietnamese restaurant worker Mr. Hyunh, the hard-working housewife Suzy, and her ever-so-lazy, unemployed, gambling husband, Oscar, and don't forget about Arnold's pet pig Abner (giving to his lost parents as a wedding gift).
Arnold's friends also helps to round out the hilarity and balance of the show: his best friend & urban legend storyteller Gerald, sometimes-bully, tomboy & secret crush Helga G. Pataki, Helga's only best friend Phoebe, class jinx Eugene, troublemaker Harold Berman & his friends Sid and Stinky, the snobbish Rhonda Wellington Lloyd, bug-loving Nadine, Rhonda's ever-so-irritating & persistent crush Curly, their 4th grade school teacher Mr. Simmons and Principal Wartz, P.S. 118's principal. Don't forget about the neighborhood butcher and new mayor, Mr. Green, Harvey the singing mailman (voiced by R&B singer, the late Lou Rawls), the florist Mrs. Pitello and all of the kids' families too.
Shout! Factory did a great job of releasing the complete series on DVD and on-demand video. Walmart had it for $20.00. Not a bad price.  No other shorts or commercials from the Nickelodeon vault is on this set. If you want to see all of those classic commercials, you'll have to research it on YouTube.
I gave this set 3 stars for 2 specific reasons: no special features to include any interviews with the show's creator (Craig Bartlett) or his staff at the time. Just a straight bare-bones release. The other reason is that looking back in hindsight, this show (like many other kids cartoons back then) contains a lot of adult and spiritual references, to include hypnotism (""Chocolate Boy""), the high use of idolatry (pertaining to Helga's makeshift Arnold locket and statue in her bedroom closet) and the very use of yoga, New Age and meditation (i.e. ""Big Bob's Crisis"", ""Mugged"", ""Harold vs. Patty"", ""Parents Day"", etc.) doesn't get any airplay in my home because we (my family) believe solely & only on the Lord, not some other Eastern mysticism and/or beliefs.
Finally, Hey Arnold! will always have a place in my youth as another one of my favorite shows, but the other things (just mentioned in the last paragraph) can go back to the world at large and stay there permanently.",1440806400,,2918,5.167019027484144

A neat little feature that I like about the set is that the cover art on the inside tells you exactly what episodes you'll get on each disc.

Hey Arnold! is one of the classics of Nicktoons. There's no denying its slice of life appeal and colourful artstyle. It's also of of those shows with a lot of thought put into each episode as well, as well as a lot of character development and charm. Please do yourself a favour and get this set.",1425600000,,610,4.205128205128205
6602529,5,B00MV55HNC,Great,1424563200,,5,5.0
6602530,5,B00MV55HNC,"My big sister always wanted to have Hey Arnold on DVD for her collection, since it's one of her fave Nicktoons besides Rugrats, and boy, did she get it, when I discovered Walmart.com still has it for under $20 plus tax, if you use SiteToStore at a real Walmart store near you, just like in its Walmart-exclusive days last fall, as of July 2015. All 100 episodes (99 since 2 episodes are together as an hour-long show) are contained in 16 discs, in 2 thick and clear DVD cases in 1 box; the cases are the same size as my sister's North and South Mini-series Collection and any of all 6 seasons of Digimon so far in my own ""liberry"". Unfortuantely, Paramount is still in control of Hey Arnold The Movie, so it's sold separately, for well under $10! The pilot episode's not in here either (nor the stop-motion shorts from Sesame Street), which was shown theatrically with Harriet the Spy in 1996, the very first Nickelodeon Movie. The pilot episode was later remade into a real episode of the series; that being 24 Hours To Live. You can't help but feel right at home with Arnold's hero-type attitude, being the voice of reason to his gang of friends, and he always gets advice from his wacky-but-wise grandparents and neighbors in their boarding house to help him! From a brutal heat wave, to Halloween & Christmas and Valentine's Day shenanigans, and those for Veterans Day, Thanksgiving, and April Fools Day (all 5 seasons of this series have at least 1 holiday episode each in them!), to Arnold trying to make Ruth (and later Lila) his gal or he and Gerald mingling with other 6th graders like Ruth, to Helga thinking she's turning into a monkey or trying to look older than she really is or blackmailing her big sister Olga into deep depression fits, to getting Stoop Kid to leave his stoop, to accident-prone Eugene surviving his endless accidents, to Harold finding a kitten and never wanting to part with it, to Brainy creeping Helga out by only breathing through his mouth (causing him to get socked in the face, as a running gag for the whole show AND the movie), and Arnold trying to find his parents; everything but the movie (where Helga finally admits her feelings to Arnold in person) is all contained here, but with no bonus features whatsoever! Despite its original TV-Y rating, I've noticed a lot of instances of some of the characters, normally from Helga, saying a certain C-word that goes around a lot these days (""crud"" being its hint/euphemism, so's not to upset any grownups reading this), that's not normally in other good family toons past and present; maybe that's why Hey Arnold stood apart from other Nicktoons and their competition on CN, aside from a colorful cast of characters and still being funny for both kids and grownups, like nearly all the other Nicktoons of the time! Whether you pay just $20 or over $40 for this whole series set, Hey Arnold deserves a place in any classic Nicktoon lover's DVD collection! ""Move it, Footballhead!"" Before I go, here's an instance of where Nicktoon creators' names get mixed up on another Nicktoon show's DVDs. In the 1st/2nd season DVDs of The Angry Beavers, they mention the creator is Craig Bartlett, who really made Hey Arnold, but the Beavers' real creator is Mitch Schauer, as the rest of that series' DVDs corrected. Make Hey Arnold a part of your Nicktoon DVD library today, in season sets or this all-in-one reissue, like other Nicktoons from Shout Factory that followed suit! I got a set for my own ""liberry"" lately, despite not being from Walmart since its exclusivity is gone in WNC, but from Amazon, and mine contains a bonus big-and-wide poster of the box's back cover picture. It alone is worth the extra $12.25 I paid for my set, compared to my sister's set at Walmart in February, which somehow had no poster.",1424217600,14,3798,4.678624813153961

6602533,4,B00MV55HNC,while i do love the content and overall packaging I docked a star because it got kind of confusing trying to binge watch the show. This is just a repackage of the individual shout factory releases and as such the numbering of the disks start over at one at the beginning of each season. So if you didn't know where you left off you could get lost,1424044800,,346,4.17910447761194

The box set arrived with plastic wrapping enclosing it, but when I pulled out the 2 dvd boxes, both were cracked by the handles and missing chunks of plastic. Probably due to it not having any extra packaging in the box to protect the box set.

My girlfriend and I are 90's kids/teens who, over the years of our relationship, discovered our shared love of ""Hey Arnold!"". The show's episodes and themes hold up to this day. This show was able to be edgy in its story telling. Stories of family, death, reunions, financial issues, marriage, divorce, street smarts, school... The list goes on.

Some episodes leave you laughing, with nostalgia, thinking, or sometimes with chills (whether it was moving episode or scary one).

The DVD doesn't feature any extras, but this is the complete uncut set of episodes. We were thankful!

This complete series also comes with a poster (which is pretty nice). If I am going to put it on my wall, I'd frame it first. Anyways, I am happy that Shout Factory is releasing these Nicktoons on DVD and in complete series box sets. Now I just hope that Shout Factory releases more of these classics in complete series box sets. Here's what I'm hoping will be released next:

- KaBlam The Complete Series (probably won't happen)
- My Life as a Teenage Robot The Complete Series
- Invader Zim The Complete Series
- Rocket Power The Complete Series

Okay the list goes on, but I think you guys see where I'm going with this. Anyways, watching Hey Arnold again brings back so many memories. My favorite episode has to be ""False Alarm."" I'm not sure why, but I find it pretty amusing (oh, that Curly). Well, this series is definitely worth getting and I'm sure younger viewers will enjoy this.
