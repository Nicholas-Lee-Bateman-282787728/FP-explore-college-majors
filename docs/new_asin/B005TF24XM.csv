8486105,3,B005TF24XM,"As a child, Vance (Phil Haus) was taught, or perhaps badgered by his father on how to play basketball. His mom moves them from Wisconsin to NYC where he attends an intercity school as ""the new white boy."" Jules (Jason Hurt) recruits Vance to be his basketball partner in a street 2 on 2 basketball game with very limited penalty rules. Vance develops a love interest in Lena (new comer Noelle Mihalinec) when he is not practicing basketball during an electronic hip-hop music montage. Maurice (Antoine Harris) is Lena's ex bf (he doesn't take it too well) and is also Vance's arch rival on the basketball court. The big duel basketball tournament is coming up with a $50,000 prize. Have the plot figured out yet?

No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Movie is designed for young teens or tweens. Older adults might be bored with it.",1325894400,3,823,4.675862068965517
