First, most of these movies can be purchased separately for $10 or $15 bucks. Check your local Sam's Club. Second, only Fanboys or SciFi fans would start with this selection. Shame on you Amazon! Where are your standards!",1281225600,,380,4.442857142857143
8271385,1,B0018Y2M76,"You can't be this stupid.  Blu-Ray ""starter"" set??  Oh, I just got a blu-ray player and I have to get a lot of movies all at once so I can watch blu-ray movies!!  Gee, a starter set!  Gee whillikers, that's perfect!!

In reality, this is a distributor trying to clear the warehouse of dog-movies under the guise of a not-too brilliant marketing ploy.  Do yourself a favor and spend 10 minutes and pick out decent movies for your new BD player and leave these garage-sale wannabe's in the distributor's warehouse.",1276128000,4,512,4.633333333333334

8271387,1,B0018Y2M76,I bought this for my son and he laughed at me and sent them all right back. This was a bad selection of DVD's.,1229040000,,110,3.625
8271388,3,B0018Y2M76,"Some titles of the pack are great, but some others aren't. I'm really happy with Baron Munchausen, Life of Brian (beacause I'm a Python/Gilliam freak). I really love the update in HD for Gattaca and Fifth Element. A Few Good Men is a good movie and Dogma is only for Kevin Smith fans (that i am) but are titles that don't need the update to HD if you already own the SD versions. Black Hawnk Down is good as demo title but very weak as a film and Resident Evil 2... well better not speak much about it. I had the fortune to buy this pack in one of this amazing one day offer that amazon does and because of the great price i'm very happy with the purchase.
