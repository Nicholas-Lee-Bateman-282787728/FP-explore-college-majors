5943192,5,B00ET9D5PK,"Master illusionist Harris the III uses the principles of magic and the art of illusion to demonstrate how easily we are deceived by our perception or the things we think we see.
Harris narrates his story highlighting significant turning points that determined the purpose of his career path and his spiritual journey. Using the dramatic elements of good story telling, actual filmed stage performances, and a powerful stage presence Harris relates how, at the pinnacle of his career, his mentor challenged him to consider whether he himself had been deluded by his own success and was allowing pride to get in the way of accomplished his purpose.
After years of pursing success, working at building a career, gaining recognition, becoming rich, and acquiring an expensive home and luxury cars; Harris tells how he took an audacious step of faith, sold his posh house and expensive cars to answer Gods call to live a simplified life, reach out to the poor, and to fulfill his divine purpose, to deliver the message:  The chain of deception has many locks  For everything there is a key.

The DVD Entangled  For Everything There is a Key combines illusion, magic and a dramatic story, with a strong evangelical appeal, providing quality family entertainment with a clear message.

A complimentary copy of this DVD was provided for review purposes. The opinions expressed are my own.",1384992000,2,1380,5.008733624454148

5943195,5,B00ET9D5PK,"In ""Entangled"", Harris III brings to life the message of deception in an artistic, engaging, and relatable way.  He shares his personal journey, his rise to success at a young age, and his subsequent realization that riches in a traditional sense don't equate to happiness.  The story weaves back and forth taking you through a live performance of his illusions and a produced story of his life.  It is done seamlessly and leaves you with a message that is not only relevant, but life changing.  It is clear that he is talented, but what makes it so good is that it delievers a message that we in the Western world need to hear.  In a life that is fast paced and driven by success, it is so easy to be deceived and inundated by the cultural around us.  You will be entertained and walk away better for it!  Pick up a copy now...believe me, you will want to watch and share.",1384128000,5,873,4.385093167701863

5943198,5,B00ET9D5PK,"Saw a great film called ""Entangled: For Everything there is a Key""...

Harris the III is the star of this unique drama which mixes both Dramatic film elements of an Illusionist and his apprentice, with real footage of a stage presentation by Harris the III.

The overarching elemental theme of this film is deception and lies.  Are we being duped?  The truth that is portrayed in this film, from the dramatic to the stage, was that even when we do not know it we may be being duped.  ""Adam had the whole garden, but yet he kept reaching for the Illusion of MORE"".... This is an amazing quote.

Harris the III as an illusionist is able to take the simple vase and ball trick or the rope trick that every 10 year old learns and turn it into a masterfully choreographed show.

This film also shows truth and deception in a way that my children understood.  They were all fascinated by the tricks and the story.  And when you kids range from 4 to 11 that takes a lot!  (Scary thing is that 3 of them want to now be `tricksters' as my 6 year old put it!!  That could be costly....

As I child I grew up around illusionists who came to churches.  I met multiple ones who were very famous.  I even learned multiple seemingly expensive tricks.  But as this show portrays you may know the secret of the illusion but without practice of your performance it will not amount to anything.

This is one film that I would HIGHLY recommend!  Oh and by the way if you are an aspiring magician you can sign up for `Illusionism' and learn from Harris the III some of the arts of Illusion.  So HARRIS THE III if you are reading this, this poor papa of 6 kids would LOVE to enroll their kids!!!  HAHA!!

Final point to this rambling: Many of you know my family, if not read back through this blog.  We believe in God's call to us as Christians: Of reaching the poor, of missions, caring for the orphan and the widow, and of evangelism... These themes are LIVED by Harris the III who speaks to his career and success; yet God called him to sell his house and live a simpler life in order to help others!  Also in the Bonus Content he has an element/video entitled Truth where he gives a beautiful story of what God has done for all of us!

THIS FILM will be a great tool to witness, and to help to start a conversation with your friends, neighbors and family!

Thanks for living and preaching the message!

5943199,5,B00ET9D5PK,"Honestly, this is an AMAZING production and storyline from a talented magician. Following Harris III's story was incredibly entertaining and ultimately a truly life-changing watch. How easily are you deceived in your every day life? How much do you rely on your senses and perception to tell you what's truth? Grab this DVD and open up your heart to a touching and inspiring story!

8609285,4,B00ET9D5PK,"I saw Harris III in person at church. I loved his show and commentary. The DVD is not as good. It makes it's point, but is very broken up in it's storyline. I do believe what he is trying to put across but believe it couldn't have been better.
Perhaps if you have not seen him in person, you will like the DVD. Because of this I gave it a 4 though a 3 1/2 would have been my choice if it could have been a selection. The magic tricks were well done and I have no idea how magicians do this. That is why they are illusions. This is the point he is trying to make by comparing magic to life.",1413331200,,589,3.8360655737704916
