6704145,4,B00O2F5GA8,I thought this was a good DVD for someone interested in learning about the AR 15. It covered the subjects I needed help with. I like how he focused a lot on zero sighting with open sights. I also thought the cleaning of the rife was informative as well as loading the weapon properly.  It was a straight forward instruction without getting off subject. The video and sound quality was top notch. I feel that I will be better informed when I make my rife purchase.,1420502400,5,463,4.383720930232558
