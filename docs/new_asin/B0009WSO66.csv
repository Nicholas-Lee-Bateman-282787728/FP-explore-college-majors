2329896,5,B0009WSO66,"this is the best tv historical drama series i have ever seen.  it's so addictive that you can't stop watching it.  on top of all, if you love eating, the cooking scenes are so much fun to watch!  i would recommend this series to everyone who loves a good story.",1127433600,11,261,4.18
2329897,5,B0009WSO66,"If you're a fan of historical drama, costume drama or just drama in general, Dae Jan Geum is for you.  This is some of the best televison I have ever seen, in any language.  It ranks with some of the best feature films in its production values.  The sets are so incredible and detailed that after the end of the series, it was converted into a theme park so that one could tour the realistic recreations of the Chosun royal palace kitchens.

While words like ""mouth-watering"" have been used to promote the show, it's really not about cooking though a lot of cooking scenes do take place - many episodes of the series revolve around food and the preparation of it.  Food is just a touchstone used to explore differing philosophies of life and how even the most mundane things can be used as tools in the hands of the good - and weapons in the hands of the evil.  There's plenty of intrigue, from the lowest servant rebelling against authority by making onions too salty to the hastening of a royal death by the serving of too-rich meals, but also an exploration of love and hate and what it means to live in such an artificial and repressed atmosphere as that of a royal palace.

It's not all backstabbing and stir-frying though - there are minor characters who give welcome comic relief.  A sweet romantic thread also runs through the story.  There are even martial arts scenes and a short display of ssrieum, the Korean counterpart of sumo.

One thing not to be overlooked is the beautiful and sometimes haunting soundtrack.  Western instruments playing music with a Korean flavor (a kind of reverse 12 Girls Band!) give the series the right ambience without alienating those who might not enjoy traditional Korean melodies.  The soundtrack is worth buying on its own merits.

Because it's a television series, each episode begins with a synopsis of earlier plot points and those tend to become tedious when watching the DVDs.  There are many flashbacks also used to remind viewers of past incidents and that can also slow down the flow.  Of course that's what the fast-forward button is for.

Shop around.  Amazon does not have the best price by a long shot.  The entire series can be had in one huge boxed set (complete with additional trinkets referenced in the show).

This series is certainly addicting - expect to spend all of your free time for quite a while wallowing in the trials and triumphs of the great Jang Geum.",1127001600,53,2427,4.6416861826697895
2329898,5,B0009WSO66,"I have been watching this series on AZN cable channel. It is absolutely engrossing! It is a fascinating story which has been wonderfully adapted for television and is beautifully acted and filmed. It has the drama and suspense of ""West Wing"" and the intellectual interest of ""Law and Order"". This young woman's life story weaves through the palace intrigues of the Chosun dynasty in Korea, which for most Americans is totally unfamiliar territory. However, on a personal level, any modern person will identify with the problems Jang Geum encounters fighting a corrupt administration. In addition, the Korean philosophy of life which underlies individual's choices and the events in the story makes the story unpredictable and even more fascinating to Westerners.",1125100800,17,762,5.358333333333333
2329899,5,B0009WSO66,"In 16th Century Korea, Jang Geum is a poor girl who loses her parents, former palace servants who were driven out by conspirators against the royal family.  She herself later enters the palace as a kitchen lady, determined to expose the conspirators and clear her parents' names.  Time and again they try to drive her and her supporters out of the palace, but her wit and good character keep her head above water.  And even when she wants to give up, her friends pick her back up and push her forward.  Her successes even earn her the favor of the royal family along the way.

This is the greatest Korean TV series ever!  The script is well done, and the stories are very intriguing.  The characters are well developed and easily liked.  You even feel betrayed when good characters turn to ""the dark side.""

I think Americans can enjoy it, too!  It wonderfully provides a window into the rich cultural background of Korea that most of us Americans are completely unaware of.  And, spanning 54 episodes (across 3 box sets), you can't help but learn a few useful Korean phrases along the way.

The fantastic soundtrack is also available on CD.",1124150400,19,1141,4.621890547263682
2329959,5,B0009WSO66,Es el mejor drama que he visto en mi vida. Ninguna serie gringa o latinoamericana puede competir.,1277683200,,97,4.764705882352941
2329960,4,B0009WSO66,"""Dae Jang Geum"" is the drama that started it all. The ""Korean Wave"" (or ""Hallyu"" as it's known in Korean) is a phenomenon that began around 2000, where consumer demand for Korean culture, food, movies, etc. experienced a huge surge throughout Asia. ""Dae Jang Geum"" was the import that sparked this wave and for good reason. It's a fascinating drama and look at Korean society and court life during the reign of three kings in the Joseon dynasty (roughly 1450s - 1540s).

Filmed for viewers with longer attention spans than the dramas that saturate American television, ""Dae Jang Geum"" is paced slowly at first, picking up speed towards the middle of the story. By episode 30 you'll be enthralled and unable to tear yourself away.

In spite of a few outlandish claims, such as the protagonist ""inventing"" surgical techniques (surgery was actually introduced to Korea in the 1880s by an American missionary). The storyline is credible and exciting. Court intrigue forms the core of the drama and will have you on the edge of your seat cheering for the main character, a lovely and talented female doctor named Jang-geum.

My only gripe is that DJG features a number of factual errors, such as the lead character ""inventing"" surgery and ""discovering"" anesthesia. I'm sure other historical inaccuracies might be noted by viewers with a background in Korean history.

I was torn between watching this drama and catching up on old episodes of ""Lost"". Needless to say this drama won, which gives you an idea of how good it is.",1271203200,,1519,4.875968992248062
2329961,5,B0009WSO66,"I am deep into Dai Jang Geum, and enjoying every minute. The historical background is a joy to look at, and the characters are nicely drawn - especially the evil women! I have only one problem with it - the subtitles are done very badly.

The version I am looking at is produced for the North American market, with subtitles by YA Entertainment Holdings. Whoever did them seems to have no understanding of English punctuation, or regards it as optional. Obvious mistakes pop up. A crucial examination for the court ladies is persistently translated as ""competition,"" when it is clearly an examination. Mistakes in grammar occur. Characters who refer to each other in the normal Korean manner as their position (e.g., Jang Geum refers to her foster father with a word for an older respected male that essentially translates as ""Uncle"") are subtitled as saying their names. Do the subtitlers think people watching Korean dramas are unable to accept this? Finally, why are the subtitles in white, when yellow is obviously clearer?

In brief, a first class drama marred by third class subtitles. The owners should send their subtitling work to SBS in Australia - they do a good job!",1258502400,2,1178,4.885
2329962,5,B0009WSO66,"An unbelievable series, impeccable in every way. Entrancing, compelling, perfectly cast and produced.

2329963,5,B0009WSO66,"Dae Jang Geum is simply the best television drama I've ever seen.  Jang Geum is a heroine of the same stature as Antigone, in Sophocles' famous play.  Here is my one sentence summary of the story:

In the patriarchal and rigid class society of 16th century Korea, a fugitive orphaned girl sets out alone, armed with nothing but her own intelligence, determination, and integrity, to vindicate her wronged mother's honor against the implacable opposition of a powerful and merciless faction in the royal palace.",1246320000,4,510,5.0476190476190474
2329964,5,B0009WSO66,"It started out with 50 boring seconds -- and in the first 18 hours of this Korean TV drama, those were the only boring moments for me. After that, I sat transfixed like someone by a fire in primitive times in the thrall of a remarkable storyteller.

Oh, there were frustrating moments (""why did he reveal that?""). Threats of formula (""not the old trapped outside the palace courtyards where she shouldn't be""). Baffoonish characters (eg, a lower-class married couple) for the groundlings. Stereotypical villains who were relentless to retain their hold on the position of the Highest Kitchen Lady in the King's kitchen for political and financial gain. But whoever (single or plural) was responsible for laying out the story knew how to blend those ingredients into a unique and savory dish.

That cooking metaphor was deliberate. I swear someone behind the scenes has a cooking fetish based on the way the camera caresses food as it's being prepared and served. I don't know how many scenes are devoted to the good King taking a morsel from the plate and pensively tasting it -- then looking up and offering a judgement.

My favorite character so far is the aging, resourceful Lady Jung -- too clever to be a mere puppet. You have to wait for her cuz she appears several episodes into this first set. Actress Yeo Woon Gye, with her long, melancholy face, makes her instantaneously sympathetic and forever memorable.

In the early episodes, the show's actual star is young Jeong Un Cho as the young Jang Geum. She makes Jang Geum distinctive, eager and energetic. That strength of personality makes it easy to accept her as prepubescent of the eager, energetic young woman played by the lovely Lee Young Ae.

Along with the clean, crisp photography (unlike American tv shows), these first 18 episodes were so engrossing that they distracted me from my current favorite American tv shows and kept me viewing one episode after another until I was either too tired or just couldn't afford to stay up any longer. Simply put: this could become my most favorite TV series in a lifetime of viewing.

-----
Postscript:

The series comprises 54 1-hour episodes. For the math challenged: that's 54 hours total! I watched the entire series in about 2 weeks (easy when the DVDs are at hand), sacrificing some sleep-time and American TV. There were flaws -- but nothing that makes me regret the time obssessing over it. Unquestionably, my favorite TV experience of 40-plus years television viewing.",1239926400,4,2485,4.888361045130641
2329965,5,B0009WSO66,I am so thrilled with this item.  The quality is good. I can't wait to purchase the next vol.,1235606400,3,93,3.8947368421052633
2329966,5,B0009WSO66,"I started watching this amazing Korean historical drama somewhere in the middle. Unlike American soaps, Korean dramas have a limited number of episodes (""Dae Jang Geum"" has 54) and don't drag on for years. It's beautifully filmed with local scenery and period costumes; and did I mention the food ""money shots?"" Early episodes are filled with close-ups of disembodied hands preparing the most luxurious Korean dishes--if only there were recipes included! ""Dae Jang Geum"" is based on a real-life (17th-century?) figure, a young woman who grows up in Korea's imperial court as a 'kitchen lady,' an apprentice in the royal kitchen. Through a series of dramatic events--love, murder and intrigue AND cooking--she becomes the first female physician to the royal court. The subtitles, although sometimes strange in their translations, are helpful to provide ""footnotes"" to non-Koreans about other historical events in their history. I loved the episodes I'd watched so much that I bought all three volumes.",1231286400,3,1000,5.375796178343949
2329967,5,B0009WSO66,"This Korean mini-series first came to my attention as I watched Korean soap dramas on the MBC America channel.  During commercial breaks I'd see the previews for this particular drama, Dae Jang Geum, and I started wondering, ""What's so great about this particular historical drama?""

So I rented the first volume of Dae Jang Geum from the local Korean video store.  I became glued to the TV as I watched the life story of Jang Geum unfold.  If you are familiar with the way Korean series are, you'll know that the central female character is *always* going through a tough spot in her life (which seems like every episode! LOL).  Drama and cliffhangers occur quite frequently, with the main character getting it bad left and right, almost like the world is against them.  It makes for a very compelling and anxious viewing, so it's always good to have the next episode ready to watch.

This historical drama is a fictionalized account of the real historical person, Jang Geum, the first female royal physician in Korea.  I won't get into the details on how Jang Geum goes from kitchen court lady to a physician lady, but it is a shocker that's for sure (and doesn't occur in this volume either).  There are quite a lot of twists and turns in this drama.  While there is a lot of heartache for Jang Geum, and things can get quite melodramatic, there are many light-hearted moments.  For instance, Jang Geum's foster parents are 2 characters that bring comic relief and there were a lot of laugh-out-loud moments when those 2 were on the screen.

I loved the historical backdrop of this series, the costume, scenery, and especially the food!  Many times as I saw the Korean dishes being made I had the sudden urge to go to the local Korean restaurant and pig out on Korean food!

While watching the series, I couldn't help but root for Jang Geum.  I loved the character's strong will, determination to succeed, and her refusal to let the obstacles (of which there were *many*) cause her to admit defeat and quit.  Jang Geum is a gentle, kind-hearted person, yet she is very focused and almost relentless on reaching the goal she set out for herself since she was a young girl when her mother was murdered by her enemies in the palace.  To become the Highest Kitchen Lady and to record what happened to her mother in the Kitchen Lady notebook.  Jang Geum succeeds in entering the training as a ""new bride"" (note:  the Korean court ladies of the time were the King's property), to become a kitchen court lady.

Like I noted before, one of my favorite aspects of volume 1 are the displays of food and the preparation of the meals.  The dishes were mouth-watering!  The first few episodes focus on Jang Geum's parents, how they left the King's palace, how they meet, and then the early life of Jang Geum before she becomes a new bride.  The next few episodes are of Jang Geum's training, the struggles she goes through as she attends training. The rest of volume 1 show the adult Jang Geum and her struggles to get through the training program to be a court lady in the palace kitchens.  I really enjoyed the episodes of Jang Geum as a young girl.  I thought the actress chosen to play young Jang Geum was adorable in the traditional Korean hanbok dress.

A favorite episode (as Jang Geum as an adult) of mine in this volume was the one where Jang Geum was sent to the palace herb garden as punishment (instead of being exiled from the palace forever!), and ends up cultivating a rare Chinese herb, which enabled her to get back to the court kitchens.  It was just one example of many where Jang Geum beat the odds against her and was successful.  I also enjoyed the scenes with her foster parents as well.

If you haven't yet got your feet wet in watching any Korean TV series, especially Korean historical dramas, this is a wonderful series to start off with.  I'd just recommend one thing:  make sure you have *all* the volumes ready to watch.",1222646400,11,3940,4.561877667140825
2329968,5,B0009WSO66,"I've watched this once before and really love it. I ordered this for my bf to inpire him on his career, since he is as talented as the main character in the show. It turn out that he likes the story as much as I do.",1212969600,4,215,3.6956521739130435
2329989,4,B0009WSO66,"My Korean partner devoured this in just three or four days a couple years ago, and I always felt cheated that I couldn't watch it. I my family to chip in on this whole set, though, for my birthday, and it was worth it!

Other reviews have talked about the historical sweep of this, and it really is a fascinating look at an exciting time and place.

Some of the funny things, though: the dentistry and make-up are distractingly perfect. Each character - male and female - is simply encased in circa-1995 foundation make-up, and each has their own palette, according to their personality. Boy, Koreans in 1500 had some serious lip gloss goin' on!

The music gets old, too, when you watch episode after episode. Having said that, I know that you're only meant to watch one a week, on TV.

Another is the plot - Jang Geum is like a yo-yo! Every other episode she gets kicked out of the palace (or almost kicked out) for something or other, and someone intervenes and she's back. Also, episode 39 is really the climax - very, very satisfying... but then there are five more episodes - almost an epilogue.

Still, these are minor points in the grand scope of this addictive drama - and 10 years from now, when I've forgotten it all, I'll be prepared to dust them off and watch them again!",1203638400,3,1283,4.465811965811966
2329990,5,B0009WSO66,MAGNIFICENT! EXCELLENT! BEAUTIFUL!..... I WAS  RELUCTANT TO PURCHASE THIS SERIES BECAUSE IT COMES IN 3 VOLUMNS. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE JUST TO LONG A SERIES FOR ME. BUT I GAVE IN AND PURCHASED THE FIRST VOLUMN AND NOW I CANNOT WAIT FOR MY VOLUMN 2 TO ARRIVE. SINCE THE OTHERS HAVE TOLD THE STORIES  SO BEAUTIFULY IN DETAIL I FEEL NO NEED TO REPEAT THEM BUT I CAN SAY THIS IS THE BEST OF THE BEST SO FAR FOR ME.,1194220800,5,409,4.037037037037037
2329991,5,B0009WSO66,"I was intrigued by this series from a description in Saveur Magazine's Top 100 list of 2007, but wondered if I'd be trying to snatch time to watch it alone.  After all, how could my husband and kids be interested in a historical Korean drama about food?  The truth is, we were all hooked by episode three and before long an extra episode of Jang Geum was more effective than video game time in cajoling the kids into listening to me.  Not to mention they now address me very politely in 16th-century court Korean when I make a request, which is an unexpected bonus.  Earlier reviewers have done an excellent job of outlining the plot, I'll just add that the series resulted in spirited family discussions about the use and abuse of political power, the limitations of gender roles, the differences between traditional Western and Asian values with regard to education and family, and analyses of the ways to construct a fascinating tale.  Which the writers of Jang Geum have done to perfection.  Somehow they manage to make cooking a life and death situation in numerous convincing ways.  We refer to this first set of discs as the ""food volume.""  By the end of episode 18, you'll find yourself wishing you were a diabetic Chinese envoy and start researching Korean restaurants in your town.  Oh, and make sure you have volume 2 on hand, so you don't have to wait to find out what happens!  Truly one of the most engaging TV series I've ever seen.",1192579200,10,1447,4.6171875
2329992,5,B0009WSO66,"My wife and I are hooked to this show!  We can't wait to be home together  after work so we can watch each precious episodes.  At first, we agreed beforehand that we should limit ourselves to one disk per evening, which has 3 episodes, knowing that we might loose control.  We knew that this show was going to be good because when we were in Malaysia everyone talked about how good it was.  It's supposed to be quite well known in many countries around the globe.  Then we watched parts of episode-one from YouTube - this is what got us hooked and addicted!  So we decided to order from Amazon.

End of each episode leaves you hanging with interesting development, making you want more!  We are down to the last two disks, but decided to go ahead and order volume 2.  And it's a no brainer that we are going to HAVE to order the last and final volume 3 in the future.  To make it last, and to get a hold of ourselves (come on, there are important things going on around the world, right?) we've decided to watch only ONE episode per evening.  But I'm not so sure how this is going to go since it's very addictive.

WARNING: at the end of each episode they give you clips of the upcoming one, but this partially spoiled things.  To remedy this situation, either SKIP to the next episode, or STOP until your next showing.",1192492800,7,1319,4.308943089430894

Later, I decided to purchase the DVD (from YA Entertainment). I probably watched it about 10 times in all and during that period I didn't have much sleep.

I would not try to dissect on why this is so popular etc, a lot of 'experts' wrote about that ever since it created the ""Dae-Jang-Keum"" craze all over asia. If you like good versus evil plots, like ""Matrix"" or ""Gradiator"", but minus the violence usually associated with it, this is for you. While ""Matrix"" had the schtick of special effects, this one has the Iron Chef in 16th C Korea and beautiful music that captivates you.

2329998,5,B0009WSO66,"Dae Jang Geum (The Great Jang Geum) is a drama set in the 15th century Korea when it was called Chosun. Set against the historical backdrop -- still very much superstitious but the country was at the height of Korean renaissance (and struggling to become more than a puppet of China) -- it tells a fictionalized story of Jang Geum, a briefly documented but real-life and only female royal physician in Korean history. She held a 3rd class officer position within the royal ranking system (equivalent to a General), the highest title given to any woman. This is a significant fact, since due to severe class and sex discriminations, it was not possible for a woman to attain positions higher than 5th. In fact, low-class citizens were effectively cast as slaves. Although not much is known about this historical figure, this remarkable precedence must have fascinated Yeong-Hyeon Kim, a female writer of Dae Jang Geum.

Dae Jang Geum interweaves the coming-of-age elements of Charles Dickens, social commentary tone of Jane Austin, and Cinderella elements common in Korean dramas. It originally aired on 2003-2004, over the span of 54 full-hour episodes without commercial interruptions. A caution to some viewers: watching this series can be highly addictive. 5 or more episodes in one sitting was not uncommon for me.

Leading the cast is beautiful Young-ae Lee (Lady Vengeance, One Fine Spring Day, and Joint Security Area). Although she is a bit old to play post-adolescent Jang Geum (she was 31-32 when the series was filmed), she does a marvelous job at very difficult role often in freezing winter. Performances of some of the supporting cast members are also notable, such as Jin Hee Ji as the romantic interest (Jung Ho Min), Mi Kyeong Yang as Lady Han, and Hyeon Sik Lim as Duk Gu. Some of the remaining cast members tend to overact at times, but solid by Asian TV drama standard. The production value is mostly high, but the use of video cameras lends to soap opera-style look.

Each DVD box set contains 6 dual-layer DVDs, each DVD with 3 episodes for 18 episodes per volume. The packaging is simple but tasteful. Encoded in high bit rate, presented in original 4x3 aspect ratio, Dolby Digital 2.0 Korean soundtrack, and English and Chinese subtitles, Dae Jang Geum looks and sounds as good as it can be. There's a bit of interlacing artifacts and overblown exposure, but these are all present in the original source elements. Overall, this is a very faithful presentation. The English subtitle contains some typos and occasionally mistranslated, but still laudable given the complex dialogs that trouble even native Koreans.

I wish it was given more exhaustive chapter stops, as each 1-hour episode has about 4 chapters each. An episode synopsis would have been useful as well. Unfortunately, the box-set does not contain any extra materials, except for pitifully small photo gallery on volume 3. No making of documentary, cast reunion special, no historical information, no interviews, no food recipes, nada.

This volume 1 features the first 18 episodes. The first episode introduces Jang Geum's parents, their background, their struggles, and how they met. It starts on over-the-top and saccharine notes, but eventually settles down to its zone. This episode is significant for setting up the story's arc, enabling viewers to be just one step ahead so they can anticipate how everything unfolds. Episodes 2 through 4 chronicle 7-10 year old Jang Geum and how she enters the palace. In episodes 5 through 9, Jang Geum struggles to become the official royal palace kitchen cook. Episodes 10 through 11 concern Jang Geum's search for her mother's past. The meat of the series starts from episode 12, where Lady Han (with Jang Geum) and Lady Choi (with Geum Young) compete for the title of highest royal kitchen position. The volume 1 ends with a cliffhanger, so be sure to purchase volume 2 ahead.

Although overuse of flashback sequences tests viewer's patience at times, the series does not lose any steam through most of the 54 episodes. If you enjoyed volume 1, you will love the next 2 volumes. Please look for my reviews of volumes 2 and 3.",1167177600,30,4159,4.951289398280802
2330019,5,B0009WSO66,"I must confess that I am hooked. I bought the first two boxed sets and I am purchasing the third. I never thought I could get hooked on a  TV series again after producing and directing American soaps for many years. But I was wrong. The series is produced elegantly with many exterior locations. The leading cast members offer touching and full performances that cross the language barrier with ease. One element of the directorial and acting style that I really love is the way actors are given long moments to play emotional reactions. I also enjoy the occasional sequences where dialogue is played over wide traveling shots that feature spectacular Korean countryside.  The actress who plays Jang Geum is refreshingly unconventional as a heroine; beautiful, but not in a typical way. She exhibits a fascinatingly complex mixture of sweetness and iron-willed determination. I would love to see her in an American production. Lady Choi and Lady Han are embodied by two deliciously accomplished actresses, and the poignant relationship between Jang Geum and Lady Han left me emotionally bereft. Jang Geum's protective military officer is equally captivating. I have rarely been as caught up in a film or television program as I am with this one.

Moralistic actions are pan-culturistic for this economically poor girl trying to rise in a world of ridged rules of conduct. This is a powerful work that many can relate to; both men and women in the modern work-place. English speaking viewer should not dub film as it looses a great deal. Sub-titles are well done.

My 12 year old son watched with me as I sat in front of the TV for 5 hours(!) each Saturday and Sunday during the recent ""Korean Drama Summer Marathon"" on AZN.  If I had to get up to go to the kitchen,etc., he read the subtitles for me.  Once, when I had to go out, HE called ME on my cell to read to me until I reached home.  The strong, patient, moral character of Jang Geum really made an impression on him.  It was worth spending more time in front of the TV in two days than I normally do in a whole week.  I cannot recommend this drama highly enough!",1159142400,14,815,4.05
2330022,5,B0009WSO66,"I am not one to watch foreign productions generally.  I have to say, though, this one captured my attention from the beginning.  I found myself sitting for hours watching episode after episode, not being able to tear myself away from the next exciting plot twist or cliffhanger!  If you like intrigue, suspense, action, drama, romance, and a well-written script brought to life by competent (and might I say quite attractive) actors, this is definitely the series to order!",1159056000,11,473,5.038461538461538
2330023,5,B0009WSO66,"There are some shows you watch where you feel like you've been cheated and you just wasted your time (and money). Definitely not this one. This series took many Asian countries by storm, but I believe that given the opportunity, it will also fascinate Western audiences. Costumes painstakingly recreated from the Han period, recipes and folk remedies of that time equally well researched, political intrigue. The culture of that period just unfolds before your eyes: how it is to be part of the king's inner court, what the inside of the Palace is like, how it is to be a palace girl, the hierarchies and politics of it all. Why, even the kitchen staff has hierarchies from the Lofty Madame to the lowly kitchen assistants. And at the heart of it all: the story of one girl who came into the palace hoping to one day bring honor to her mother, and how she makes the leap from being a palace girl, to being a kitchen madam, to being the king's physician. Above the pageantry, the gorgeous costumes, the interesting insights into Korean court life, this series' greatest strength is its complex, intriguing, and unpredictable story. I have been watching tv series from everywhere--- this is the best I have seen yet.",1155254400,12,1214,4.731132075471698

The costuming and highly detailed and authentic sets sweeps one right into 16th century Korea. The music is also an excellent and clever meld of East and West. The plot line, acting and writing are top shelf. The shows also contain a number of interesting cooking scenes. The story has been an inspiration to many women. I watch a great deal of Asian television and movies and this is a most extraordinary piece of art. I recommend the entire series unreservedly.",1145577600,9,597,4.695238095238095
2330026,5,B0009WSO66,"Dae Jang Geum is the best TV series I have ever seen. It is extremely addictive and I can never stop watching it. This is the perfect TV series for anyone and is much better than many of the boring and repetitive shows that are on TV today in the United States. I am so addicted I even bought the calendar and soundtrack! For anyone who enjoyed this series I also recommend ""Shinsengumi"", A Japanese historical drama by NHK (However, I believe it is only available in Japanese off of amazon.co.jp).",1137369600,6,498,4.483516483516484
2330027,5,B0009WSO66,"If you are interested in foreign films, ethnic food, or foreign cultures, this is the DVD set (1-3) for you...based on the true story of a woman, an orphan. who struggles from poverty to become a doctor to the king and other members of the Korean monarchy. Indeed no other woman in the history of Korea had this distinction since normally no otherwoman but a wife or concubine could ""touch"" the king.  How a woman could accomplish such a feat is due due her determination, her kindness, and scientific intelligence. As her rival describes her, even if you succeed in banishing her from the court, she will come back like coarse grass.  Mesmerizing in every way: plot, scenery, characterization, historical detail, romance, cliff-hanging endings, herb science, costumes, sets.  Too few films ""in any language"" provide meaningful role models for young women unconnected to violence.  I LOVED this series and the principal female character.  DAE JANG GEUM is not so much an episodic film as it is an experience. This mini-series became the most popular show in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Korea. As one reviewer put it, once you see a few episodes, you are ""addicted"" to see this series to conclusion.  Purchase the First Set for Christmas or Birthday Gifts and your friends and loved ones will not be disappointed.  Five stars?  Absolutely.",1136332800,63,1333,4.946188340807175
2330028,5,B0009WSO66,"I finished the korean movie ""Dae Jang Geum"" Vol 1-3. Its a great story (base on a real life story). I myself a medical student who specialise in Chinese medicine, we do learn of her study while we were in college. Even though some part in the series was not mentioned at all in our text book but I believe that the producer of this TV series had sufficient to prove what they showed is correct.

You are not only get to learn (a bit) some of the korean cusuine, but also the chinese medicine (a mixture of china & korea,... they are all the same anyway...especially in the 16 century), but most important at all, the lesson that perform by Jang Geum such as, ""the eater should be the one to be focus, but not just the good taste of the food, the reason of cookery is to provide the eater with good health and happy thoughts"".

You won't be regret to get the entire 3 volume of the DVD. Love the soundtrack, some are originally performed by Shanghai Philharmonic Orchestra.",1134172800,10,972,4.335164835164835

8068691,5,B0009WSO66,"Just a quick note.  If you are into Korean Drama's, This one was my first.  It is among the sacred favored few at the top of my list.  This one set the standard for all to follow.  There have been others as good.. but none that were overall much better.  That said, There is one more point I would like to make.  Subtitles.  If you notice you can get this Drama Series from anywhere from $30.00 dollars to over $1000.00 dollars for 54 hours.  There IS a difference.  The key to a high quality flawless product is who manufactured and distributed the DVD.  Look for YA entertainment.  That company no longer exists but when they did they made A QUALITY product with the highest standards.  The subtitles were perfect.. the box set was awesome.  They were manufactured for sale in the usa and there are no higher standards.. unless they start printing DVD's on solid gold disks.  The lesser priced dvd's are probably knockoff's from china.  In my experience i have found some that they ""cut off"" the bottom 30% of the 4:3 screen  (to get rid of hard coded subtitles) and ""make it wide screen"".  They make it wide screen by chopping off the bottom 30% of the 4:3 ratio.. to make it a wides screen.. (close shots everything below the chin is cut off, and wide shots you only see the tops of people's heads.. their hair.. but no faces)  THEN on top of that.. the subtitles are changed to chinese chinglish.. instead of korean translations to english.. characters names change.. the spelling changes.. from jang to zhang .. and worse.  I'm not saying EVERY chinese product is bad.. but i have not found one that is not noticibly ""different"" than anything you would buy manufactured in korea.  You really get what you pay for..  Keep in mind tho. if your lucky.. and you find a drama with YA entertainment on the box.. you have found a gem.. it SHOULD be expensive.. if it's not.. I would buy it first.. then read the rest of the box to see if i even wanted it.  Notice the price on this ""Dae Jang Geum vol. 1"" .. if you bought all 3 volumes you would be around $1000.oo  the reason is this is the best you can get .. YA entertainment on a product no longer in print, out of production, from a company no longer in business.  Absolutly the BEST!.. and getting rarer all the time.",1408752000,,2272,4.393285371702638

8068696,5,B0009WSO66,"During the era of the Joseon Dynasty, a girl attempts to bring her parents' killers to justice by ascending the ranks of the palace kitchen and destroying their black market.  Despite its 54-hour running time, the storyline engages the viewer within the first few hours and tempo is sustained with huge quantities of effective suspense sequences and intriguing political developments within the palace.  The political maneuvering is glorious because the antagonists are exceptional at scheming to eliminate the protagonists at all costs.  This is the ultimate cat-and-mouse game where attacks and counterattacks are executed on a perpetual basis, but the true novelty here is that the action revolves almost completely around food preparation and medical examination.  The supporting characters are memorable and well-developed, and the cultural value of this series is impressive with its detailed showcasing of 16th century cooking, medicine, period clothing, tradition, and the internal organizational structure of the royal palace.

Though I did not grasp the story because it was dubbed (albeit very badly) in Talagog, it was just like watching the other previous Korean tele-novellas that I have seen.  Now reading a review and finding the synopsis of this show is I'm sure that it is just as good as Jumong, The King & I, & The Great Queen Soendeok.  If you like foreign movies or tv series, this is one that you should add to your collection.  If you ever seen the previous shows that I mentioned in this review, you will love this one.
