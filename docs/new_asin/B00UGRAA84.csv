8706754,4,B00UGRAA84,"Jack Caine (played by Dolph Lundgren) is a Houston vice cop who struggles with police rules. Whilst involved in an undercover operation to entrap a US drug lord, his partner is executed, and a large humanoid alien arrives on earth. The alien steals large quantities of heroin and injects it into drug addicts then extracts a natural hormone (endorphins?) from the bodies of his victims. This hormone is what he smuggles back to his home planet for his race to get high on. Now, many branches of law enforcement are after the alien after a long period of disbelief in the reports of a very large alien with long blonde hair killing heroin addicts and leaving their bodies with a hole in the skull.
The alien is played by Mathias Hughes, his only line in the movie is ""I Come In Peace,"" which was also the name of the movie when released in the USA in 1990. Excellent sci-fi, lots of action, explosions, shooting, fights, bad guys dying, and lots of shots of Lundgren who always looks good on screen.
Lundgren, born in Sweeden holds a masters degree in chemical engineering and a 3rd deg black belt in Kyokushin karate. Looks and brains.",1520208000,,1135,4.596059113300493
