I'm not in too his, or anyones Loud muisc. If Ronnie records more swings CD's, I'll be the first in line.
Thanks Robbie.

8226624,5,B000X23K2A,"What an amazing DVD and in Blu-ray,,He is a superb singer and his interpretation of The Rat Pack is spot on.  The 57 piece backing orchestra are fantastic musicians and they ALL seemed to be enjoying themselves.

The Dancers for once complimented the music and added to the visual effect.

Song choice had the WOW factor and the backdrop effects were again superb, the My Way with Frank Sinatra was a very good choice and worked well.

The Albert Hall looked amazing and the tables made for a large club setting and with various adoring fans dotted around Robbie - including his mother set the scene.

He was visibly moved at the end and after  such a huge musically and emotionally charged night and  great to see a  British artist singing so well

Highly recommend the DVD if you are a fan of the Rat Pack's music and this era.

Negative point - Robbie was in the Albert Hall singing classic songs - he looked good sang superbly well  BUT couldn't train his brain and mouth not swear in a foul manner albeit with humour.  The F word came out a couple of times ???  Why OH WHY",1382400000,,1077,4.378787878787879
8226625,5,B000X23K2A,This is an awesome concert. I never expected Robbie Williams to be such a great swinger. This is a purchase worth every penny.,1363737600,2,126,4.521739130434782
8226626,5,B000X23K2A,"Robbie Williams is just fantastic in this concert.  Loved Rupert's introduction along with Robbies ""grand"" entrance.  Song selections are just great.  I thoroughly enjoy his tunes and his tributes to the great masters like Sinatra, Martin, Sammy and other brat packers.

I would echo another reviewers sentiments that Robbie will probably never tour in the USA....so this Blu Ray is a great substitute.",1357516800,4,402,5.333333333333333
8226627,5,B000X23K2A,"I purchased this when it came out on DVD, but I of course wanted it on Blu-Ray.  The picture is crisp and the sound is very good.  Since RW probably will never tour the US, this is as close as I will probably get to see one of shows live.",1353974400,,238,3.74
8226628,5,B000X23K2A,Robbie Williams is outstanding. That's why he has sold over 55 million albums. Any music lover will enjoy this record.,1297641600,4,118,4.95
