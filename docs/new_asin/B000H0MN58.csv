8135745,2,B000H0MN58,There are many functions of this unit and it is almost impossible to operate this without some training. This video does not show how to use the settings but only highlights how to mark way-points and such. I am looking for reasons my unit will be off sometimes showing me up on the bank sometimes. No mention of calibrations or such.,1366588800,,334,4.491803278688525
8135746,1,B000H0MN58,"I bought a complete Raymarine E120 system for my boat. I bought this DVD (and the two others) to help me shortening the learning curve. This DVD doesn't hold up to its promise. It only touches the surface of general operation. Not much more than the DVD you get from Raymarine for free when you buy the plotter. Very disappointing. I will take it to the shooting range next time I go. It probably makes a good target on the 100yard line. Sorry, I had to say that but this product isn't really worth the money.",1207958400,2,509,4.3125
