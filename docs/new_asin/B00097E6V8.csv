2269225,1,B00097E6V8,"I accidentally ordered VHS, not DVD. My mistake but maybe it needs to be made clearer in the description. Who really orders videos anymore? Dissappointed with the product only because is will never get watched. My bad.",1406505600,,218,4.918918918918919

2269227,1,B00097E6V8,"Awful, boring made-for-tv mini-series type movie. Would be zero stars if that was an option. Terrible, don't waste your time or money.",1395532800,,134,5.136363636363637
2269228,4,B00097E6V8,"Henry Ford was quite an innovator and unusual person. The movie was interesting, but seemed to avoid a lot of his more controversial aspects. The topic is so broad, it is difficult to condense into one movie. I guess I was disappointed it covered little of the technology and breadth of the Ford empire. It was entertaining and well acted. If it sparks the viewer to explore the world of Henry Ford further, then it was a success.",1394841600,,430,4.5256410256410255
2269229,5,B00097E6V8,I had seen this movie on TV and enjoyed it.  I also share it with my Business class.  Ford may not have been a good person but he was a business man like no other.,1394064000,,163,3.6285714285714286
2269230,5,B00097E6V8,"There is a wonderful book also, and this movie was based on the book. I have to say it pretty much followed the book. Cliff played an excellent Henry Ford. I love period movies and this one is a GREAT one! This is a must have for all the grandpa's whom love the Model T. Anyone for that time frame and well the history of FORD. DVD great quality NO problems from Amazon. I buy from Amazon sellers ONLY as for the ease of ordering for my vast dvd collection. I am replacing VHS...",1375142400,,479,4.1063829787234045
2269231,4,B00097E6V8,This DVD is a good addition to our library. We enjoyed learning the history of the automobile industry and Ford family.,1370131200,,119,4.714285714285714
2269232,5,B00097E6V8,"Excellent insight to the beginnings of the Ford Motor Company. Cliff Robertson did his usual good acting in portraying Henry Ford. I remember seeing this movie long ago, and I wanted to add this to my collection",1369526400,,211,4.72972972972973
2269233,4,B00097E6V8,"This DVD followed Ford history pretty close. However, there were some errors. Overall I have to say it was good.",1368662400,,112,4.65
2269250,4,B00097E6V8,"I can't add much to the excellent reviews written by eric sorenson, left bank, or Douglas W. Peschka.

Some reviewers here wanted a documentary on the business of the Ford Motor Co.--- this is not that.

Others wanted to see the minor but important relationships Ford had with other giants in industry.  If that's what you are seeking, read the Robert Lacey biography of Ford, on which this 1987 made-for-TV miniseries is based.  Or read the newer Stephen Watts biography, on which the excellent 2013 American Experience:  Henry Ford is based.

This sprawling 3 hour TV movie seems about right as an introduction to the quirky man that was Henry Ford, if you don't mind seeing scenes of a car assembly operation in which the primary work seems to be that of polishing the front fenders.

Best acting award here has to go to Michael Ironside, who, as Chief of Security Harry Bennett,  was convincingly evil throughout.",1368230400,,917,4.796178343949045
2269251,5,B00097E6V8,"Had to purchase another copy of this movie to replace the one my brother had lent to someone and never received it back. Glad that this DVD is still available to buy at a reasonable and fair price. Every car and American history buff should watch and own this movie. As fan of great American industrial icons, this movie demonstrates the human side of the Ford family. Cliff Robertson did a great job as Henry Ford. This DVD is well worth the price and should be a part of the visit to the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village in Dearborn Michigan to get the full effect of U.S. history.",1368057600,,591,4.381818181818182
2269252,2,B00097E6V8,"Once you've watched the PBS series' Henry Ford, it's difficult to take the Cliff Robertson Henry Ford seriously. It comes off
as a made-for-TV-movie. I can only expect that many liberties were taken to make Robertson's Ford somewhat of a drake
when, in fact, he was so consumed with the manufacture of his car it left little time for extra-marital activities. His abuse of his
only son, Edsel, however, was reasonably well handled and was his dependence upon Harry Bennett to oversee managing
plant operations. A better casting for Ford might have been James Cromwell; Cliff Robertson was, in fact, an actor with movie
star looks--- not at all convincing.",1365379200,,655,4.963636363636364
2269253,4,B00097E6V8,Great historical movie with no holes barred truth about Henry Ford.  Picture quality was not real good  compared to more modern DVDs.  I would recommend to any Ford fan though.,1361923200,,176,4.8
2269254,4,B00097E6V8,"It was a fine movie that we enjoyed, it kept us in our seats.not noticing that the movie was over three hours long.",1360108800,,115,4.043478260869565
2269255,5,B00097E6V8,"I gave this to my brother for a gift.  He is all about FORDS.  He only buys FORDS and he had not seen this movie.  I did see it once before and thought it was good.  I hope he enjoys it too.  He even named his cat, Henry Ford.",1356566400,,226,3.5306122448979593
2269256,2,B00097E6V8,"If your a car guy and looking for some detail on the history of the Model T's development look elsewhere. I was expecting some time devoted to Ford's other cars before the T, like the model's K, N, R, and S but I saw none of that. To my mind all the joy of this man's career centered around his Model T. In this movie the Model T, which was developed after many months in the experimental room at Ford's factory, basically appears out of thin air. Henry's son Edsel Ford was a real gentleman who did an awful lot for the company but none of that comes through either. He is portrayed childlike when in reality he was a brilliant executive. This is Ford for a TV audience at the usual 8th grade level. All the good stuff is left out and all the sensationalism is left in. Edited severely and in better hands, with the inclusion of the brilliant job that Edsel's son Henry Ford II did, then maybe the Ford's would of had their due. Has any one American family accomplished more?",1336003200,,976,4.281081081081081
2269257,2,B00097E6V8,"Others seem to have enjoyed this movie, but I found it unwatchable.  And I am intensely interested in the subject matter.

Hard to believe this thing was made as recently as 1987.  To me, it has the feel of a B-movie from the 1940s or even the 30s.  Bad writing and bad acting.  I admit that I lack that nostalgia thing when it comes to film -- I want my movies all to approach the modern standard of being convincing and realistic.  I just have no taste for the hoaky and the contrived.  And I expect actors to be nuanced in their performances, not like amateurs in a skit. It just looks very, very old and second rate even for something old.  In my opinion, it is nowhere near as convincing or as appealing as, for example, ""The Waltons,"" which was a period drama depicting the same era.  And they turned out Waltons episodes weekly without -- I am sure -- anything like the budget of this junk.",1318982400,,897,4.291666666666667
2269258,3,B00097E6V8,"Excellent movie.  The only disappointment was the quality of the movie.  It was very grainey, as if it were copied too many times.",1318204800,,130,4.608695652173913
2269259,5,B00097E6V8,"I write this based only upon my recollection of the original airing of this movie in the 1980s, which I recorded back then on my VCR.

I grew up on Fords, and remember my dad buying them almost religiously.  I was familiar with the product long before I knew anything about the man or his contribution to America's great love affair with the automobile.

Over the years, I learned about Henry Ford's implemantation of the Moving Assembly Line in the manufacture of his Model T's, and his desire to manufacture every part of every car he made.

It was this TV-Movie, originally titled ""Ford:  The Man and The Machine"", based upon Robert Lacey's book ""Ford: The MEN and machine"", that revealed a Henry Ford whom I never knew.

Blended right along with his genius as a pioneering car maker, we are given Henry Ford's long-lasting open affair with a secretary 20 years his junior, his ruthless battles with his son Edsel over company policies, his antisemitism, and his early violent battles with unions.  The same car maker who made the work week much more humane by limiting workers to eight hours a day, and running his plant round the clock in eight hour shifts, allowing workers to have a life outside of their jobs, also battled the unionization of his plant to the point of blood being spilled in labor disputes.

This film blends Ford's successes and failures, and juxtaposes them side by side, giving us a portrait of a man so conflicted and dysfunctional, we are left to wonder how it was that a man so troubled ever became so successful.

My only disappointment with this movie is that it gave little or no mention of Ford's friendships and business relationships with Thomas Alva Edison and Henry Firestone.  These, too, were a vital part of Ford's life and work.

Perhaps it is the very conflicted nature of Henry Ford in this movie that makes this film so riveting.  It should also be noted that this is one of the late Cliff Robertson's forgotten performances, which seldom gets any mention in most articles about Robertson or his filmography.  But Cliff delivered a convincing performance here of a gifted and talented and also conflicted man.  This performance is the stuff of Emmy Awards.

If you are at all interested in Henry Ford, buy this movie.  And buckle up - the leaps from Ford's successes and virtues to his weaknesses and vices and back again will make for a wild ride through this incredible man's life.",1315699200,,2429,4.693396226415095
2269274,5,B00097E6V8,"Good movie for those who like stories based on true events in history. Although the movie skims over the legal battle the Dodge Bros had with Ford the movie stays pretty much on track with the facts. Some things were left out of the movie; like Henry's relationship with Thomas Edison and some of the contributions Ford made to society like the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, MI and more; but this wasn't a documentary anyway.

2269283,4,B00097E6V8,This movie shows some of the inspiration and hard work that went into the starting and successfull operation of a large buisness that is well known today. How ever it does not give the details of the actual friend ships and deallings Mr. Ford had with Thomas Edison and Mr. Harvey Firestone. But all in all I feel it is a good movie to watch and have for your personal collection for later reference to remind us that for every thought and work we do to be successful some one will be there to try and take you out. It allso shows how no family is without problems and the out come of wrong and stubbern decisions have on the ones we love.,1196985600,,639,4.203252032520325
