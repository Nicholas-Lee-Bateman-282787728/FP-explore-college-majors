3545753,4,B001E549KC,"The Waltons is my favorite TV show. It has the best kind of story-arc which is simply that of a genuine family growing up in the depression and the WWII years. Certainly by season 8, I still miss Richard Thomas as John-Boy, Grandpa, Grandma (pre-stroke) and to some extent Olivia. But that's just how life goes. Isn't it? Names and faces change, but the stories of the Walton clan go on. We even get to see Jim-Bob and especially Elizabeth grow up a little more in season 8. Overall, the quality of the drama is still pretty good. I especially recommend the episodes: The Silver Wings, The Spirit, The Idol and The Rememberance.

Season 8 introduces a few new character's but somehow it all fits pretty nicely. Cousin Rose and her grandchildren. Ben's wife Cindy. Even the new John-Boy is acceptable. He's brought in gradually, which is good because it eases the shock of such a principal character change. While he lacks some of Richard Thomas' energy and innocence, you can see how he at least tries to capture some of the ""old"" John-Boy in the role.

Lastly, although not credited (nor is it listed on imdb.com) I'm pretty sure that Harrison Ford makes a guest appearance at the very end of the episode called The Medal. In the Dew-Drop Inn, you see an actor at a table with another guy singing ""When Johnny Comes Marching Home"". It's him right? Did anyone else notice this? Can anyone confirm it?

While not five star material like seasons 1-6, season 8 still makes for some quality TV viewing. Enjoy!",1233100800,4,1505,4.629213483146067
3545754,2,B001E549KC,"In 1971 CBS did some major house cleaning which included canceling its ""rural"" oriented programming.  In December of that same year, CBS would air Earl Hamner Jr.'s ""The Homecoming"", which would lead them back to rural programming in the form of ""The Waltons"" in September of the following year.

On January 6th 2009 Warner Home Video will release all twenty-four episodes of season eight of The Waltons on a three-disc set.  Unfortunately, by season eight, the series has jumped several sharks, and is far from the depression era family drama that we came to know and love.

By the time we get to Season eight, Richard Thomas who originated the role of John Boy is gone, and would be replaced by a one dimensional Robert Wightman, Michael Learned, who portrayed mother Olivia Walton, contract had expired and would not appear in all the seasons episodes, new family members are introduced which is never a good sign, and the thespians who had adequately portrayed the Walton children, had grown into mediocre actors tasked with carrying the series.

The writing too had grown tired by 1979, and though this season still contains some poignant moments, the attempts at lightheartedness are forced, and well beyond the talents of the current cast.  For all intensive purposes the writing was on the walls of the iconic Walton home and the show would last only one more season.

The shining moments at this point in the series come from the relationship between John (Ralph Waite) and Olivia Walton.  Though limited in this season due to the absence of Michael Learned, the chemistry between these two talented actors remained strong throughout the series, and added a level of quality to this season, that only left the rest of the cast to appear to be severely lacking.

World War II served as the theme for many of this seasons episodes, but the writing generally manages to keep the family, and subsequently the audience, from being pulled into the drama associated with such an important time in our history.  One exception is the storyline in the two-part season opener in which John, who is assigned to the local draft board, deals with the death of a neighbor's son.  It is the superior performance by Waite that makes this segment work.

Earl Hamner Jr. remained involved in the series from inception to conclusion, and his narrations remain throughout bringing a level of nostalgia to the series that is sure to illicit a smile from anyone who enjoyed the series in it's heyday.  Unfortunately Hamner also hosts the only piece of bonus material in this new release, the two hour special: ""A Decade of the Waltons"". Hamners slow delivery made for a wonderful folksy introduction to this classic show, but as a host, he was far too awkward, and lacked the personality necessary to lead us down memory lane.  Hamner's wardrobe, tinted glasses, and absence of a smile (There may have been dental issues as in the one scene in which he is laughing, he remains off camera) did not help the situation. The poor quality of this retrospective does not fall solely on Hamner as the standard clips lack continuity, and the interviews with the actors and their real life counterparts seem overly staged and stiff. Since this special aired at the end of season eight; it is a bit generous to list it as a bonus feature.

Not a lot of notable guest appearances during the season, but it's fun to see a young Jonathan Frakes in episode eight ""The Lost Sheep"", and if you look quick you can spot Eric Stoltz sitting in the class room in episode twenty-four ""The Valediction"".

The shows look and sound great.  The packaging leaves a lot to be desired, and if both sides of the disc were going to be utilized, it would be helpful if the discs were better marked.

Recommendation:  This is a classic series, but the quality began to wane after the first five seasons. Season eight is only for the true fan that wants to keep their collection up to date",1232409600,20,3942,4.745241581259151
3545755,5,B001E549KC,"I love the Waltons.  I have all 7 seasons so far and will get season 8 just as soon as it is released!  My favorite character was Grandpa - so I am sad that he passed away so soon in the series.  However, these are just as great as well.  Season 9 is the last season - HOWEVER - they made several movies after that.  I hope these movies are included as a Season 10 (so to speak).  Just like Little House on the Prairie made their last season with their movies.",1230854400,11,460,3.9456521739130435

3545760,4,B001E549KC,"Season Eight was a particular interesting year for The Waltons.  Michael Learned (Olivia) returned for twelve episodes, Ellen Corby is seen in fewer episodes as Grandma, and Robert Wightman makes his first appearance as John-Boy; replacing Richard Thomas for the rest of the series.

Despite these things, the show still retained its family values, and appeal.  The season begins with World War II raging, John-Boy is missing in action, Jason is in charge of recruits, and Olivia struggles to keep up with her changing family.  Erin, Elizabeth, and Mary Ellen do their best to help in the war effort, and Ben and Cindy have their first baby.

When Olivia leaves to go back to the Sanitorium, Rose--a close family member--comes to help with the needs of the family.  Jason befriends a woman named Toni (his future wife), and Jim-Bob finishes flight school and heads to war as a pilot.

The following is a list of the 24 episodes of this season:

1. The Home Front (1)
2. The Home Front (2)
3. The Kinfolk
4. The Diploma
5. The Innocents
6. The Starlet
7. The Journal
8. The Lost Sheep
9. The Violated (1)
10. The Waiting (2)
11. The Silver Wings
12. The Wager
13. The Spirit
14. The Fastidious Wife
15. The Unthinkable
16. The Idol
17. The Prodigals
18. The Remembrance
19. The Inspiration
20. The Last Straw
21. The Traveling Man
22. The Furlough
23. The Medal
24. The Valediction

While it is true that by this point in the show, some of the quality was degrading.  But, for a true fan, this season is a Godsend.",1222905600,56,1513,4.549815498154982
3545761,5,B001E549KC,I watch the Walton's almost every morning and have seen all the shows numerous times...but still I need to have these DVD series just in case they should ever go off tv.

3545763,5,B001E549KC,"I've now watched 8 of the 9 seasons of the show which I missed during its original run.  Some random observations.  Ralph Waite was the constant rock of the show.  In the earlier years, of course, the character of John Boy was front and center.  The other kids, especially in the very earliest seasons, were part of the background and almost irrelevant.  Of course, Richard Thomas departed and that was that.  When he departed, it allowed the actors playing the other kids to emerge.  Michael Learned all but disappeared in these later seasons to pursue other opportunities.  Her absence wasn't believable.  Even when John Boy returns she was absent.  A different actor playing John Boy was ridiculous and almost painful.  Will Geer tragically passed away after his best season on the show.  His character became more lovable in the absence of his stern wife.  Corabeth was an annoying busy-body. Ike was another rock of the show and always lovable. The Baldwin sisters gave the show real atmosphere, but the character of Emily jumped the shark when she couldn't distinguish the younger Ashley Longworth from the original.  Peggy Rea as cousin Rose was terrific and more than compensated for the absence of mom and grandma. Both mom and grandma were religious nuts and often annoying. The actor who played Rose's little monster of a grandson was very good.  Judy Norton was a better actor in the earlier seasons as the tom-boy Mary Ellen than she was in later seasons.  Her breakup with David to marry Kurt wasn't believable and Kurt looked old enough to be her father.  Mary Beth McDonough (Erin) was drop-dead gorgeous by season 8, although she could be prissy.  Season 8 was the best season for Kami Cotler, Elizabeth.  Jason and Jim Bob were very likable characters.  Ben, possibly with a Napoleon Complex, was always ready to fight.  It was always painful to see Ellen Corby unable to speak beyond a syllable or 2.

I've loved watching this show and think it's one of the greatest dramas ever on television.  One more season to go!",1501027200,,2036,4.804034582132565

I took my girls there and we sat on the front porch and talked with her before she moved away. The Walton's are wholesome, real Virginia life. It takes you back to a time when things were simpler and about home, family and friends. Family stuck together and home was a family affair. I've been to Ike Godsey's store, saw the mill and the school/church. I just really related to spending my summers growing up in Virginia.",1391817600,3,559,4.333333333333333
3545841,2,B001E549KC,"By Season 8, it's obvious that The Waltons has seen it's best days. Some episodes are good, but this season takes the show and almost turns it into something else.

The main focus in season 8 is World War 2. With all the Walton boys off to fight, even the girls are pitching into the war effort. This season marks the return of John-Boy, who was pronounced missing in action in the beginning of the season. He turns up in a nearby hospital, where we find out he's no longer played by Richard Thomas. Now, Robert Wrightman assumes the role and he's nowhere as good as Thomas was. This hospitalization causes Olivia to join the Red Cross, and thus midway through this season she disappears from the show for good.

New in this season we have Rose Burton, a cousin of Olivia's who comes to the house to pretty much replace the role of Grandma, and later on Olivia herself as well. So by he end of the season, we have the girls at the house, Rose, and John.

Think what you want about my review, but aside from a few interesting episodes, this season is better left alone. It marks the departure of some of the show's best long-term characters. Once an innocent family just barely making ends meet is a scattered mess.",1391731200,,1214,4.410714285714286

The new additions assist this difficulty and the plot line is helped thereby. The addition of a look at the real life family and places of the writer and narrator of this series is a benefit though it could have been done better than the split screen filming of interviews betweeen cast members and real life characters.

3545889,4,B001E549KC,"Season 8 finds the Walton clan deeply enmeshed within World War II, in almost every facet of their lives. Second oldest son Jason has enlisted, while third son Ben is helping the war effort at home by helping their father John run the family lumber mill, which is overwhelmed with military orders. Eldest daughter Mary Ellen is traveling the mountain as a nurse, while her sister Erin is working in the steel mill office.

Their biggest concern, however, is eldest son John-Boy -- missing in action while overseas on assignment for the Stars & Stripes. Months and months of tireless questioning and prayers by the family bring about nothing, and everyone's reluctantly beginning to fear they may have to admit the worst.

While Season 8 is full of rich storylines and much of the same elements that made earlier seasons so popular with fans, viewers may want to take note that this season is notably different. For starters, there are a number of new regulars -- Olivia's cousin Rose, come to stay with the family, along with her young grandchildren Selena and Jeffrey, as well as Ben's new bride Cindy. Conversely, several of the beloved regulars are missing -- John-Boy, of course, as well as Grandma (who is said to be ""off visiting"") and Olivia away ""volunteering at the veterans' hospital in Richmond."" Many of the B-characters, such as the eccentric moonshining Baldwin sisters and Verdie are almost never seen as well.

Still, this classic series is still worth watching. Whether you're a long-time fan or simply looking for something more wholesome to engage you in the current sea of reality shows, The Waltons are guarantee to hook you in.",1246406400,3,1649,4.882142857142857

3545917,5,B001E549KC,"This is not an impartial review. Season Eight, as is the entire TV series, The Waltons, is what TV shows of this type should be, in my opinion -- strong, believable characters, and strong, believable stories that most people, regardless of race, gender, religion, etc., could relate to and identify with at a deep level. The only agenda I have ever noticed with these shows (and I have watched every episode of the Waltons several times over and over again) is the attempt to portray solid family relationships, solid moral foundations, and a realistic portrayl of an ordinay family with ordinay struggles (and I believe that true for both country and city people). Earl Hamner, the creator of the Waltons, fashioned the original Walton characters from characteristics of his own family, but the many other show writers injected enough differences and introduced enough new characters to keep the show fresh and interesting the entire time it was on the air.

In Season Eight, even though Grandpa is gone - anytime he is mentioned either by something he said or someone looks at his picture, it is like he's right there. When Grandma has short cameos in these latter years because of Ellen Corby's illness, it's like she was never gone. That's high quality TV writing. As I see it, there is not a lot of difference between 1936-1945 and 2009 in the world when it comes to what really matters and what's at stake. War is war. Tyranny does not change much. Economic woes come and go. What endures through all of that is the human spirit and the strong family connectedness.

Season Eight continues to maintain the same high quality as all previous Walton seasons have. I highly recommend Season Eight and all other seasons of the Waltons to anyone interested in really fine TV viewing.",1234915200,11,1783,4.804560260586319

3545921,5,B001E549KC,If you are a Walton fan like I am you will surely enjoy season eight. I recommend it for all ages. My little niece Loves to watch the Walton DVDs with me when she is at my home. It is a very good series for children to watch instead of all the crap on TV that they have to watch now a days.,1234396800,2,290,3.619047619047619
3545922,5,B001E549KC,"This is the next to last season of the show.  One thing to remember is that there are episodes on both sides of the DVDs.  Unlike the earlier seasons, the dvds don't list the specific episodes.  We watched all the sides that had writing on them and noticed that the episodes didn't follow the time line.  It was not until we had watched all the ones on one side that we turned the 3 rd disc over and watched the decade of the Waltons narrated by Earl Hamner.  It is excellent!  If you like the show, you will look forward to the last series which is season 9 which comes out in April 2009",1234137600,,588,4.114035087719298

3545925,5,B001E549KC,"Much has been said about the Waltons losing its soul with the absence of John Boy and Grandpa.  In the later seasons, we also see grandma and Olivia much less, and new characters appear to fill an otherwise very empty home.  In season 8, a new actor appears to play the role of John Boy.  He really does a very nice job, but I certainly understand how it is difficult not to think ""that's not John Boy!""  Even Olivia comments upon first seeing him in the hospital after returning from being MIA that she hardly recognizes him.  I imagine that was intentional fun on the part of the writers.  Nonetheless, the writing is still excellent, and if you can get past the absence of some wonderful characters, there is still much to love as the series continues.
On a more practical side to this review, when I ordered this DVD set, disc 3 was missing!  Very strange, since the product was shrink wrapped when I received it.  However, Amazon was very helpful, and they immediately shipped another copy to me, and it arrived well before I had found time to navigate my way through the first two discs.  It came, complete, and in excellent condition.  Thanks for the great customer service.",1233878400,3,1181,4.5545023696682465
3545926,4,B001E549KC,"The Waltons Season 8 is still good even though there are some major changes, especially the absence of Richard Thomas as John Boy Walton.  Nevertheless, we still enjoyed this season as any true Waltons fan  would.  Season 8 revolves around WWII and some significant changes in the lives of the main characters.  Ben Walton, married to Cindy, is the father of baby Virginia, John Boy is MIA.  A season well worth watching.",1233878400,,421,4.791666666666667

3545932,5,B001E549KC,"We love all the Walton Videos.  Some of the content wasn't as good as other years, in this video - more romance and less story in some of the shows.  It was a little disappointing to have Olivia off the show for the last half of the season and they had a different John-Boy, which it probably would have been better to just leave him off those shows than replace him.  Good actor, but hard to replace Richard Thomas in that role after all those years. It was nice to have Grandma in a couple of the shows.  Rose and the children are cute additions.  One of our favorite shows had Rose teaching Ike to dance - very funny.  It was nice to have Amy back in a couple of shows as well.",1233532800,,680,4.075187969924812

I await with bittersweet anticipation the ninth and final season but, in the meantime, I have been fully enjoying season eight.  Now that our country is going through our own ""Depression"", this series seems more relevent than when it first aired.",1233446400,,314,4.6909090909090905
3545934,5,B001E549KC,"Waltons fans can buy with confidence - season 8 is one of the best seasons yet. The stories are as compelling as they are well acted.

Overall, season 8 is more satisfying than season 7 as by now the remaining cast-members seem to have reconciled themselves to the loss of Olivia and managed to fine without her.

Olivia's absence in not inconsistent with her character's past restlessness. The writers have always managed to convey a conflictedness within Olivia - the joy she derives from caring for her family is often contrasted with a nagging sense of personal unfulfilment. John does a fine job of ""trying to be mother and father"" as he puts it one of the episodes.

Five stars!",1233273600,2,684,4.683333333333334

8296458,4,B001E549KC,"This season was the victim of the ""Oliver"" syndrome.  When a series starts showing its age and the kids start to grow up, the writers always bring in annoying young kids into the fold...(Remember cousin Oliver from the ""Brady Bunch?).  This season starts off marvelously with the return of Olivia,if only for a quarter of the season.  It quickly goes south with the addition of Cousin Rose and her two unruly grandchildren, Jeffrey and Serena.  Rose is ok, as she has been brought in to ""replace"" Olivia as the mother figure and she is a warm and loving character.  But her two grandchildren are so annoying that it takes away from the quality of the show.  Then comes the final nail in the coffin:  A new John Boy!  Mary McDonough (Erin) in her book,  said that the producers argued that replacements are accepted in soap operas all the time.  To a certain point, that is true, but not with an actor who has defined the role and is irreplaceable.  Would anyone in daytime accept a replacement for Susan Lucci as Erica on ""All My Children""?  Richard Thomas defined the role and this is no way is criticizing Robert Wightman's portrayal of John-Boy.  He was an actor, paid to play the role but it was a big mistake to bring him back with another actor.  It just didn't work and would never work.  To me, this is the weakest season of the show for the reasons I stated above.  Season 9 would see the elimination of Jeffrey and Serena which was a plus but we also lost Ralph Waite in that season.",1524528000,,1493,4.453874538745388
