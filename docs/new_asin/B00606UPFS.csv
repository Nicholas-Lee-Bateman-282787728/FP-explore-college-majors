8490137,5,B00606UPFS,"Yes, two Sartana movies on one single-sided dvd. And boy do they look great! Both features are uncut widescreen anamorphic presentations with bold crisp colors that just pop off the screen.

SARTANA'S HERE... is by far the better of the two and is a kind of send-up on Spaghetti Westerns in general, Sartana in particular. This is a light hearted movie with plenty of violence and killing. It's played straight, but with tongues planted firmly in cheeks. Not a comedy, but it'll have you laughing as Sartana and Sabbath perform impossible feats of gunplay while making it all seem so everyday commonplace. George Hilton and Charles Southwood are perfect in the leads for director Anthony Ascot and all three made another film, GUNS AND DOLLARS, which is pretty much a continuation of the same.

DJANGO AGAINST SARTANA is the more serious film and as such it's laughs are unintentional, but they're there. The plot involves Django going after his brother's killers and he wrongly believes Sartana responsible. Django and Sartana then team up to set things straight. Not really a bad movie, but not very good either. When Django and Sartana go into their macho posturing they're more funny than threatening, the complete opposite of SARTANA'S HERE...when Sartana and Sabbath do it, LOOK OUT, they're gonna kick butt and you believe it, they're just too cool.

So, all in all, this is really another great release by WILD EAST. A double barrel blast of Spaghetti Westerns. Great looking releases that are a must have for all collectors of this stuff. Get it now before this one goes out of print because WILD EAST doesn't seem to reissue their past releases once they're sold out.

Lots of killings, great music, five stars.",1333324800,10,1721,4.903780068728523
