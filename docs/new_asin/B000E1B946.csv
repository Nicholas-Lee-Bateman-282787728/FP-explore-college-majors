8103752,1,B000E1B946,"This movie is so technically incompetent that you could use it as a ""how to"" on how ""not"" to make a movie. You can listen to the director's commentary and hear him apologize for nearly every scene in the movie. ""Too much light, too little light, not enough Chihuahuas, not a big enough budget"" are some of the excuses he uses to explain away the movie. Still, I have to give him credit for trying. How many of us would try to sell our first movie? Could I do better?  Probably not.  Not for a first attempt anyway.

Still, you expect some level of technical competence even from a small budget movie.  You won't get that here. It's only worth a chuckle for how bad it is.",1148860800,2,671,4.25984251968504
