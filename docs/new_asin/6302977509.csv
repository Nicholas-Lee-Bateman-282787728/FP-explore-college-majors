2691525,4,6302977509,"I saw this YEARS ago at a University showing--and then we obtained a copy on VHS. I'm not sure how to classify it--Indie? Cult Film? Dark Comedy? In a nutshell, the plot is sort of as follows: Eli (Max Parrish), a burglar caught in the act by Twinkle, the crazy heiress daughter of the house, is coerced into marriage at gunpoint so that they can run away together with Twinkle's Daddy's money. When Eli changes his mind at the altar Twinkle attacks, they wrestle, the gun goes off--and Eli takes off with the cash, leaving Twinkle for dead. Eli is forced into hiding while awaiting fake credentials for a new identity. He takes up residence in a WEIRD California trailer park full of an array of dysfunctional residents, including the nubile & innocent young Dannie (Adrienne Shelly), her exotic dancer/porn star older sister Sabra (April Rayne), and Dannie's great Dane Gus. Sabra wants Eli (now known as Bud) but Bud is drawn to innocent young Dannie. There is jealousy, there is love, there are very crazy neighbors. And the surprises keep on coming. Wonderful performances by Diane Ladd, Bela Lehoczky, Ania Suli, and Timothy Leary. Language and subject matter earn this one a well-deserved R rating. But within the ugliness, the coarseness, the harshness that is life there is innocence and wholesomeness too. We really like this underappreciated film. Give it a try. I keep hoping to find this one on DVD--but so far no luck.",1355097600,,1432,4.82520325203252
8157014,4,6302977509,"It's actually a warm hearted movie. Sure, it's got pitch black comedy, that centers around murder and inappropriate sex, but it's pretty charming. Actual porn stars and outlaws are in the cast, and yet, really it's pretty close to PG-13. That said, it's got Sean Young at her most nutty. Still worth seeing.",1522108800,,307,4.811320754716981
8157015,4,6302977509,"One of those funny crazy cult movies from out of the early 90s, I believe.  Very campy movie that is irreverent and darkly humorous.  The older guy and the supposedly 17 year old girl going on 18 is a bit risque but then there is all the murder that goes on to counter that morality.",1512345600,,283,4.127272727272727
8157016,3,6302977509,"A funny movie, but not as good as I remember it being the first time I ever saw it. I recommend the movie, but it's definitely a B-movie, with all that entails. It's also 4:3, and looks to be a transcode straight from VHS. Not a high-quality video stream, not a remaster. I'd regret paying as much as I did if I could've found it literally ANYWHERE for less money.",1475971200,,364,4.214285714285714

8157018,1,6302977509,"the only reason I bought this is because I liked Adrienne Shelly.
And the rating on Amazon was 4 stars.
I should have looked closer.

I didn't like it at all.
Cheap, bad acting, bad direction.

Don't waste your money or time on this",1462233600,,232,4.25

8157023,5,6302977509,"A true cult classic! Absolutely fell in love with this movie after the first watch. Anything with Adrienne Shelley is bound to be great. The trailer park characters were reminiscent of John Waters, and especially true with the trashy stripper sister's hilarious delivery of her lines! So many great one liners and hilarious shenanigans...was so excited when I heard not one, but TWO Pixies songs among the already great soundtrack. Will be watching this multiple times for sure.",1432684800,3,478,5.141025641025641
