8548847,5,B00AA0TDQW,"I watched this film several years ago when I was very into Czech new wave.  It is a fantastic film and one of my favorites in the genre.  No spoilers but it is basically a character story on a small town instead of a single person as the nazi ideals slowly take over their ideology... The film is absolutely beautiful and really has no drawbacks unless you hate reading subtitles.  If you like this check out ""the cremator"" (another Czech new wave film)",1417392000,,453,4.433734939759036
8548848,5,B00AA0TDQW,"Imagine a small rural village after WW2, recovering from occupation by the Nazis, when, all of the sudden, the butcher, the baker and the candlestick maker are made bosses of everyone, telling everyone how to live, how to think. That's essentially the story of this movie, a heartwrenching tale of Communism's rise through the lens of a small village in Czechoslovakia.

The director Vojtech Jasny made this film during the Prague Spring. (You kids, go look it up.) There was much hope in that time. The story is that Jasny raced to finish the film as the Soviets were preparing to crack down, and that as the tanks were rolling in, he fled the country on the last plane out of Prague, with the reels of film under his arm. The movie won at Cannes.

This movie is a lost classic. And it's a shame that it's available only on VHS!",1365465600,,829,4.483443708609271
8548849,5,B00AA0TDQW,"""All My Good Countrymen"" is yet another beautiful movie from the Czech New Wave that suffered under the censoriousness that overtook the country post-1968. Now it can be seen by Western audiences, and is certainly worth watching. Spanning the years 1945-1958 (with an epilogue that appears to be circa 1968), it centers on the life of a Moravian village as it undergoes the misguided efforts to collectivize its farm life by the Communist regime. But to say this is simply a political tale would be off, for it is more than that. It is in one sense a cross-section of post-war European rural life, told in a beautifully poetic manner, with a rich use of music and the cycle of seasons as its backdrop. It is not strident in its political opinion (though it was strident enough to get it banned after '68), though clearly our sympathies are supposed to be with Frantisek, the farmer who fights against collectivization and suffers as a result. The film also has its share of death--it centers on a group of male villagers--but even this is more melancholy than tragic, and sometimes it is off-screen. Clearly the director saw that nature and a belief in God carried the villagers through their troubles.
  Two notes about this Facets edition: the subtitles are far from perfect, both in terms of when they appear (i.e. one person's words appear after he's been shown onscreen) which can be confusing, and the spelling is atrocious at times, as if a non-English speaker did the translating. Also, the color in the film is not stable, and can be clearly seen to vary while you watch. But to be fair, the latter issue may have as much to do with the stock used at the time than anything else. Still, it would've been nice if Criterion had released it instead. There is also a booklet with the video with several helpful essays about the director and the film itself.",1244592000,,1862,4.673780487804878
