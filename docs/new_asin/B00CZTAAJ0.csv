5764917,5,B00CZTAAJ0,"This is a very well written movie, with one of the best endings I have ever seen. It's not all blood and guts like so many horror movies now days but more suspenseful and scary like horror movie were suppose to be made. I highly recommend adding this movie to your collection.",1378598400,5,276,4.326923076923077
5764918,3,B00CZTAAJ0,"The acting at times was not the best. But overall, it beats watching TV instead. Good movie to sit back and watch with a glass of wine as you laugh at some of the silly things they do during this movie.",1378166400,4,202,3.951219512195122
5764919,2,B00CZTAAJ0,"The first 15 minutes of this movie consists almost exclusively of shots of the forest and the sky and of 5 males near-silently road-tripping in an alternately clean/alternately dirty Toyota Tundra. Seriously. That's about it.

Oh. There is some expository introductory text that, quite frankly, could have been omitted since it served only to relay the very same information that the on-screen images would later show. That bit of ""tell, then show, then tell, then show"" lasted for much longer than a director should reasonably expect his audience to patiently stomach.

Interestingly enough, the 5 main characters actually turned in a pretty good performance (particularly considering the fairly weak script). Also, according to IMDB, the movie was made with only $20K and over the course of just under 2 weeks. A big tip of my hat to the movie crew for their efforts in making this, hence, the 2 stars rather than 1.

I'll sum up with this: I'm a fan of B movies and can enjoy a marathon run of B-movie fare on any given weekend afternoon. The ""Beast"", however, falls well (and I mean *well*) below B level. If you're multitasking and just want something running in the background, and don't mind the absent lighting in this film that makes seeing much of anything difficult, and the rental price on this has been reduced to near pennies, then there are certainly worse ways to spend 1.5 hours.

Caveat emptor: We only made it through forty minutes of this film before we had to call it quits.",1377907200,2,1495,4.782945736434108

5764933,2,B00CZTAAJ0,"Well, I read all the reviews, and they're obviously all over the place. I know in these microbudget c-movies that the flmmakers, cast, crew, family, friends, etc. usually ""pad"" Amazon reviews with 5-star ratings, and I do understand that. Whenever you see an obviously atrocious video, there are always those obviously padded reviews, as was the case here. But, I thought I'd take some time and review this one in some detail...

PROS:
1. Acting: Some fairly decent acting, for a c-movie (oddly, the guys- except for the dude in the v-neck, who was really bad, were much better actors than the girls).
2. Cool opening photography for the first 20 minutes, when there was actually some light.

CONS:
1. Directing: TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE LIGHTING - wayyyyy TOO DARK in the outdoor night scenes (which make up most of the video). This video comes off as if it almost appears like it was been shot on a stage with the house lights turned off and a black curtain behind it.
2. Directing: Mike, the inexplicably, constantly furious ragemachine, was annoying as hell - esp at the beginning when we're introduced to the main characters. Starting out a film with an unexplained WTF? isn't good.
3. Writing: So... the film is about a group of friends walking into some mystery slaughter, to which they add - accidentally killing some random camper chick, all of which they each react in their own completely moronic, bizarrely lame ways?
4. Writing/Directing: Often what probably looks good on paper doesnt translate to the screen. Im guessing the script probably reads much differently than what ended up on video.

OK, that's all I can take...

In sum, definitely take a pass on this one. Save your money.",1430352000,2,1693,4.827586206896552

5764936,1,B00CZTAAJ0,"Very dull, listless movie; at the 25 minute mark it seems as if it might start getting interesting, but it doesn't. To quote Homer Simpson: ""The suckiest bunch of sucks that ever sucked.""",1418083200,,187,4.696969696969697

5764939,5,B00CZTAAJ0,this movie was very creatively done. I was held in suspense the entire movie. I really enjoyed hows it flowed and kept me on the edge of my seat. The producer and writer of this Movie Mike Lenzini is going to go far as I can see that he is true my engaged in his passion. It is clearly reflected through out the movie.,1379116800,2,318,3.984375
5764940,1,B00CZTAAJ0,"The acting in this movie will definitely help reduce any stress you may have, as you will laugh out loud the entire movie---seriously bad acting.  The movie itself is boring and very predictable.",1378684800,2,195,4.909090909090909

8588007,3,B00CZTAAJ0,"So much potential but really a bit of a letdown. I don't mind bad acting (the ""Bully""), but all those unnecessary, lingering camera shots just bogged the film down. The plot was there, the set up was there, a good locale... but no payoff. A dude in a furry suit that is barely in the film? A single, blurry, far in the distance, on screen kill? It wasn't even suspenseful. There wasn't even a jump scare!  Still, it was oddly engaging.

There is more film after the credits but it wasn't worth it though, so.",1515196800,2,508,4.336842105263158

8588009,1,B00CZTAAJ0,"Aside from the bad acting, the characters themselves are unbelievable and upstaged by the bully of the film. No real terror, hardly enough gore.

It is the hour and change you'll wish you spent watching something else because the film is frustrating in every aspect.",1502668800,,315,4.962264150943396

8588011,1,B00CZTAAJ0,"""Five friends head on vacation to a remote cabin."" Need I say more?",1497916800,,67,4.230769230769231
8588012,2,B00CZTAAJ0,"Initially, this movie had a lot going for it. Great photography & pro looking graphics start it off right. We meet the main stars heading out for a camping trip to a cabin. 2 characters are pissed with each other (after finding out why, you wonder why the brooding Eli even went.) 2 characters go off in the night and one (the director) is killed off screen. Then they hear a woman scream and run into other victims that are all killed off screen.

The main character takes a car and appears to be escaping. He stops for no reason and stumbles across a body pile made up of his friends and the other campers (he discovers this well off the road which only adds to the confusion of why he stopped and happened to wander back into the woods.) He finally sees the guy he was feuding with and then all of a sudden you see a bigfoot beating (presumably) the once brooding Eli. And then the movie ends.

Pros - Decent acting (it ranges from some good to some bad), good opening photography, and a decent setup. The bigfoot is surprising good looking from what you see. Confused as to why it wasn't shown more.

Cons - Big-time letdown after a decent setup, off screen violence, not seeing the creature more.

The movie is only 65 minutes long and there are far worse bigfoot movies to spend your time watching  (like ""Bigfoot vs. Zombies"" & the worst, ""D.B. Cooper vs. Bigfoot.""",1477440000,,1372,4.407114624505929
