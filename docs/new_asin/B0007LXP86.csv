2219701,5,B0007LXP86,"True, the production values could be a little better in terms of the special features, BUT, I'm so happy that these disks are even being made that it's almost silly to quibble over little details.

There's no reason this series shouldn't have been released on DVD years ago, especially considering the other MUCH less-deserving titles that've been offered--and collecting dust--on the shelves in recent memory.

If you or anyone you know is a Magnum fan, I highly encourage you to buy these and spread the word to others. Let's keep those sales numbers up to give Universal the positive reinforcement they need to release ALL the seasons!

And hey, Universal, how about a Magnum movie, STAT? With Tom Selleck in the title role, of course!",1112918400,8,738,4.888
2219702,5,B0007LXP86,"I was thrilled when season one was released! I have every single episode ever on VHS - and am so pleased that Universal is releasing season 2.

Some great episodes are in season 2 ( mind you all the episodes are great) so this is a must have for any super fan or even anyone who liked the show.

Can't wait for seasons 3 - 8!!!!!",1112054400,6,329,3.9696969696969697
2219703,5,B0007LXP86,"I have enjoyed it for years and admit to having about 40 VHS tapes commercials and all. So, needless to say, I was thrilled when I heard that the show was going to be produced on DVD.  I bought Season One and there were a number of eps that I had never seen - cool.  But I have had to ration my watching while waiting to see if Universal would indeed release Season Two.

My basic review is that for the fan and semi-fan, having the EP's on DVD is indispensible. This show is one of the best series of the 80's - it is hysterical to see people hustling to find a pay phone to use and to see the 80's Hawaiin clothing.  Season Two contains some of the better episodes of the show and this set will be a great addition.

However, as a caveat, UNIVERSAL has done a TERRIBLE job producing both the Magnum and Miami Vice series.  Here are a few of the problems primarily for Magnum but which relate to Vice too.

1) There are simply NO SPECIAL FEATURES.  Except for five very short documentaries on the Vice set, there is nothing about the particular show beyond the eps themselves. How difficult would it be to track down the actors and interview them?! There are minimal notes attached to each ep which gives information that any fan, or anyone with an internet connection already has.
2) There are multiple times on both series where the audio is out of sync with the video...and not just barely. Magnum's or Crockett's lips will move and the words will come about a half a second later.
3) Universal must have some serious manufacturing problems. I bought Magnum Season One and have had to return it three times - I am on my FOURTH brand new copy of Magnum and am close to taking my Vice set back too. The first two times I returned the DVD's because the first disc had issues (scratches, etc.) the second time bc the audio and video was so out of sync on the second disc it was unbearable. (Maybe Universal will get the picture when all these defective returns start showing up on their doorstep!)
4) Universal gets the theme song in Magnum wrong. In the broadcast version the theme song changed to the well-known version used for 7.5 seasons in the ep entitled ""The Ugliest Dog in Hawaii."" However, on the DVD, the new theme song pops up strangely in ep 13! What?! And no explanation is offered - this may have been an interesting note to put in special features or in the intro materials.  On Vice, the theme song kind of evolved rather than changed drastically.  But no mention of this is made and the intro to the first ep will seem rather strange to the casual fan or newcomer.
5) Magnum Season Two - significant improvements with the packaging.  Each disc gets its own plastic sleeve which is significantly better than the hard-to-balance packaging of Season One.  However, there is nothing to hold the plastic sleeves in the case, they just slide in and out of the cardboard box.  Concerning extras, again, there is nothing except for an ep from season two of the A-team and Knightrider.  These are not so much bonus features as they are advertisment for other Universal dvds.  The A-team ep is pretty cool but Knightrider is too cheesy to finish.",1110412800,58,3154,4.441941074523397
2219704,5,B0007LXP86,"Some of my favorite episodes such as ""Memories are Forever"" with Marta DuBois, The Jorro Kill"" with Tyne Daly, and of course, the beginning of John Hillerman playing Higgins' relatives.  Some much depth was added to Thomas Magnum's character during this season.",1110240000,4,261,5.214285714285714
2219705,5,B0007LXP86,"You know it simply continues to amaze me just how much this show seems to appeal to people across the age spectrum.  Although I was too young to catch the series its first time around; watching it through A&E, and then through the First Season DVD I have to say that this show has only gotten better as time goes by.

  I can't really think of anything that can compare to it that is currently airing on TV today.  If you haven't seen it, this is certainly a no risk venture since I you will come to LOVE this show!",1109376000,9,515,4.11
2219706,5,B0007LXP86,"Magnum P.I. is my favorite TV show of all time, and season 2 is my favorite season. Here are the episodes:

Billy Joe Bob - A cowboy from Texas, who is searching for his younger sister, runs around the island and punches everyone in the jaw.

Dead Man's Channel - In a tribute to ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark,"" the archaeologist's daughter in this episode is named Marion. Tom Selleck had been the original choice to play Indiana Jones in the movie. Selleck would eventually play a satire of the character in the season 8 episode ""Legend Of The Lost Art.""

The Woman On The Beach - This is my favorite season 2 episode. It's full of action, adventure, mystery, and romance. Guest actress Judith Chapman gives an absolutely brilliant performance. The final scene of this episode would be redone as the final scene in the season 5 episode ""Mac's Back.""

From Moscow To Maui - A Soviet military pilot defects and lands his airplane in the U.S.

Memories Are Forever - This two part episode is extremely important to the history of the series. We learn a lot about Magnum's activities in Vietnam. This episode introduced the Michelle character. This episode will be referenced through flashbacks in quite a few future episodes.

Tropical Madness - Magnum and Higgins get involved in a love triangle with a young British lady who is visiting the estate. Higgins punches Magnum in the jaw. No one believes Magnum when he says he was attacked by a Sumo wrestler and a dwarf.

Wave Goodbye - A Vietnam veteran, who's suffering terrible psychological pain from the war, is the lead suspect in the murder of a young female surf champion.

Mad Buck Gibson - Mad Buck Gibson is an eccentric writer who is visiting the estate. His character is very interesting, and makes this a great episode. There is no villain in this episode.

The Taking Of Dick McWilliams - Relatively boring episode about a man who gets kidnapped.

The Sixth Position - Magnum and a ballet dancer get into some arguments, which leads to romantic attraction.

Ghost Writer - This episode is a satire that makes fun of big corporations. The villain here is a big corporation. I love capitalism, and I found this episode to be very entertaining and funny. Guest actor Elisha Cook Jr. plays a character that is different than the ""Icepick"" character that he would play in future episodes.

The Jororo Kill - This episode is elevated to greatness because it has one of the most interesting villains of any episode. The villain is a professional assassin who dresses up as a woman, and he is very skilled at both of these things.

Computer Date - Magnum tries to find out which employee is stealing secrets from a corporation.

Try To Remember - Magnum gets in a terrible car accident, but he can't remember what happened.

Italian Ice - Magnum rescues a young lady who is being held prisoner in an Italian castle. The young lady turns out to be a crazy psycho who becomes obsessed with Magnum.

One More Summer - Magnum joins a football team so he can protect one of the players.

Texas Lightning - Magnum gets hired by a rich woman from Texas. Her character is quite interesting. I love this episode.

Double Jeopardy - A movie is being filmed at the estate.

The Last Page - Magnum is hired by a Vietnam Veteran who can't get over what happened during the war.

The Elmo Ziller Story - This episode introduces a running joke that will continue throughout the rest of the series: during World War I, Higgins's father was in the British military and traveled all over the world. As a result, Higgins has many illegitimate half brothers and illegitimate half sisters who are scattered all over the world.

Three Minus Two - Magnum gets involved in the fashion industry.",1107302400,165,3720,4.648854961832061
2219707,5,B0007LXP86,"I bought the Season One DVD of Magnum P.I. and with much begging, got my wife to watch it with me.  She has never been a fan of televsion, even as a youngster (something about a vast wasteland, liberal talk I think) and there are only a couple of programs we watch each week on T.V.  Heck, we don't even have cable and that's why I love it when the good shows of my youth come out on DVD.  Anyway, to make a long story short.....  my wife LOVED Magnum P.I.  It's exciting, funny, witty and you really grow to love and care for the characters.  She'll be as excited as me, that Season Two is on the way.  As far as the Season One DVD issue, I have no complaints.  Sure, any DVD put out could be a little better mastered or contain more extras or interviews, etc.  But for the money, you can't do much better than Magnum P.I. Season One.  I expect nothing less from Season Two on, where the characterization and background texture becomes richer and more compelling.",1106784000,7,964,4.247252747252747

Mosley), and his adversary and occasional ally Higgins (John Hillerman) return in these three double-sided discs, backed by a driving score and the beautiful Hawaiian landscape.  Some of Magnum's adventures arise from attempts to help old friends (The Taking of Dick McWilliams, One More Summer, Wave Goodbye), some from guests or friends of Robin Masters's (Mad Buck Gibson, The Sixth Position, Italian Ice), and some occur when an ordinary investigative job takes a sharp left turn (Computer Date, Texas Lightning).  One (Try to Remember) provides an unusual twist on the popular amnesia storyand introduces semi-regulars Kwan Hi-Lim as Lt. Tanaka of Homicide and Glenn Cannon as Doc Ibold (as well as Magnum's rubber chicken); another (The Last Page) has its origin in the horrors of Vietnam.  Then there's The Elmo Ziller Story, in which we meet (or do we?) Higgins's Texan half-brother (played by Hillerman, who was actually born in Texas).  Like Simon & Simon, to which it was for many years a lead-in, MPI wasn't afraid to tackle the unexplained, and his cases occasionally have a whiff of supernaturality about them: in Woman on the Beach Rick and Thomas encounter what may well be a ghost (watch for the twist at the end); in Memories Are Forever Magnum has a nightmare which portrays almost exactly what happens several days later.  In addition, having established something of Magnum's basic character, the series now begins revealing information about his pastmost notably that, while in Vietnam, he married a French Colonial nurse, Michelle, who thought she was the widow of an officer in the NVA (why she had been living in the North and how and why she went to Saigon are unfortunately never explained), but her first husband turned out not to be dead after all, so she was forced to make Thomas think that she was instead.  The sometimes supercilious (or even downright annoying) Higgins begins this season to write his memoirs (a task that would continue throughout the run), and also on occasion displays some humanity: once when he fails to hold up his end of a bargain he's made with Magnum, he admits that honor forbids him from expecting the detective to fulfill his; at another time, seeing how deeply Magnum is affected by Michelle's reappearance in his life, he consents without a bit of sarcasm (or even ""negotiation"") to help save her from possible mortal peril.

At least two of the episodes are flawed by not providing a definite conclusion--that is, we don't find out what became of Buck or Dorsey after the final scene--but I don't doubt there's fan fiction that fills the gap.  This set also includes one episode each of The A-Team and Knight Riderwhy, I have no idea, since neither was a Bellisario series.",1423612800,,2901,4.967010309278351

Funny thing is, the person for whom I bought it, who had been desiring to see the show again after not having seen it in many years, also wondered how she ever had liked it!

This is silly, totally unrealistic, unbelievable nonsense, with no redeeming features. (I guess women just liked it for Tom Selleck...and perhaps boys liked it for the car?

I tried it, being an avid fan of old shows (I watch NO modern TV) but this show is just gawd-awful. I'm embarrassed for the producers who made this; and for the fact that enough of my fellow countrymen watched it, to keep it on the air!

So, when I saw that Season Two was being offered on single sided DVDs I eagerly placed my order assuming they would not be plagued with the errors of the double sided versions. Well, I was wrong. While the DVDs are by no means unwatchable they still stop and skip on occasion. I suppose the problem wasn't the double sided DVDs, but just a low quality product.

I also gained GREAT respect for him for his handling of the Rosie O. attack he endured! I also find his cowboy movies are especially terrific examples of his acting ability, great story telling there. Never payed much attention to Magnum PI in the 80's when on TV, but now with TODAY's TV which is...well... total garbage, this show is a breath of fresh air. So I thought I'd buy the first season of Magnum, as I recalled it was a pretty good show, plus it has Selleck. What a great decision. The whole cast and the way they interact is like a tight family, funny, strong and loyal ties that bind, and is great fun to watch. You may find that a few episodes (here & there in season 4, 5, 6) are pretty simple (poorly written), BUT the actors tried to work with it and it's still the Magnum PI family.

2219824,5,B0007LXP86,"MAGNUM,PI was an American private detective drama starring Tom Selleck as Thomas Magnum, an ex-Navy officer/Vietnam Veteran now turned beach-bum private investigator living on Oahu, Hawaii that ran on CBS from December of 1980 thru May of 1988 and consistently ranked in the top 20 U.S. television programs during its first 5 years that this series was originally telecast in America.

Magnum also resided in the guest house of a posh 200-acre beachfront estate known as Robin's Nest in Hawaii at the invitation of its owner(Robin Masters) which was the celebrated-but-never-seen author of several dozen lurid novels. Obstensibly this is quid pro quo for Magnum's services based upon Magnum's claimed expertise in security, the pilot suggests Magnum also did Masters a favor of some kind.

In addition, Robin's Nest was guarded by 2 highly trained Doberman Pinschers named Zeus & Apollo, & all other aspects of the estate were managed by the often exasperated Englishman Jonathan Quayle Higgins III(played by Texas-born veteran actor John Hillerman), a snooty ex-British Army Sergeant Major with whom often as a humorous aside during various episodes of this series, Magnum must barter for use of the estates amenities other than the guest-house & the Ferrari 308 GTS, the tennis courts, wine cellar, expensive cameras, etc.

During the early seasons of MAGNUM, P.I., the voice of Robin Masters heard only a few times per season was voiced by Orson Welles. A recurrent theme throughout the last 2 seasons involves Magnum's suspicion that Higgins was actually Robin Masters.

That possibility was contradictory to numerous references throughout the series run that make it clear that Higgins & Robin Masters were 2 different people.

In spite of this controversy, Higgins dual identity remained an open question until the series finale episode where Higgins first admits he's Robin Masters, but later suggests what he had said about being Robin Masters was a lie.

Magnum seemingly lived a dream lifestyle: He'd come & go as he pleased, worked only when he wanted to, had the almost unlimited use of the Ferrari as well as many other of Robin Masters luxuries.

Magnum would also keep a mini-fridge with a seemingly endless supply of fictional Coops beer, wore his fathers treasured Rolex GMT Master wristwatch, was seemingly surrounded by countless beautiful women who were often his clients or victims in the cases he solved & enjoyed adventures with his old Navy buddies from the Vietnam War T.C.(Roger Mosley)and Rick ""Orville"" Wright(Larry Manetti)that had a love/hate relationship with Magnum.

Interestingly, Magnum & Higgins often broke the fourth wall by ""locking eyes"" with the audience; other characters do this, but a lot less frequently.

At the end of MAGNUM's 7th Season, Magnum was killed off and its 1986-87 Season was intended to be the end of this 8-year detective drama, but there was an outcry from fans in the Spring of 1987 and an 8th Season was produced as its final season in the Fall of 1987 to bring Magnum ""back to life"" and to round the series off in the Spring of 1988.

I love this 1981-82 Season of this detective drama the best throughout Magnum's whole 8-year run on CBS, since it had most of my favorite episodes like ""Try To Remember"", ""Italian Ice"", ""The Last Page"", ""Wave Goodbye"", ""The Taking Of Dick McWilliams"", ""Texas Lightning"", ""Three Minus Two"", ""The Elmo Ziller Story"", etc. along with the fact that Magnum was still in its honeymoon phase of the show during this season too.

In addition to why I like MAGNUM's Second Season the best, this season was funnier and more amusing, especially during all the fall-outs that Magnum often had with Higgins, TC, and Rick along with the fact that Magnum obviously used Robin's Ferrari more in the 2nd Season than he did in most other seasons, especially more than he did in the last 4 seasons of this private detective drama, which was another reason why I was so excited and dying to have MAGNUM's complete 2nd Season released on DVD.

In addition to that; this MAGNUM DVD was complete and uncut like they were originally shown on CBS with the proper introduction, unlike the case when MAGNUM, P.I. was shown in reruns on WGN, USA, A&E, and COZI-TV which had too many deleted scenes with too many added commercials in between, plus COZY-TV, A&E, USA, and WGN didn't use the proper introduction to this season or most other seasons of MAGNUM on top of that, since COZY-TV, USA, A&E, and WGN had revised all the episodes of MAGNUM, PI to use the Sixth Season introduction to every single episode instead, which really sucked, because that made the seasons of this private detective drama less interesting to watch, since there wasn't much to compare to between each season all the way from the First Season to the Eighth Season.

But it was very interesting when you'd watch an episode from an earlier season and compare it to a later season, especially when the introduction between older and newer episodes are different, so you can compare to see how Magnum, Higgins, T.C., and Rick and them looked in the earlier seasons and how they ended up looking in the later seasons, which the introductions show you as well when they don't use the same intro to every single episode along with the fact that the same introduction to any show gets old and boring after while, unless of course the introduction changes eventually.

In addition to why this 1981-82 Season of MAGNUM was one of the best seasons of MAGNUM, P.I.; this was also one of the seasons when Magnum would do his swims on the beach as a pasttime instead of playing more sports during his spare time since Magnum had stopped doing his swims on the beach by the time MAGNUM hit its 6th Season when Magnum started playing baseball and basketball with Rick and TC on his leisure time rather than swimming.

I also liked the way Universal provided the original air-dates to each of these episodes with a brief summary too.

For instance, the original air-dates to each of these 1981-1982 Season episodes on CBS were

Something else that baffles me is like I had mentioned on my review about the MAGNUM, PI-Season 4 DVD is that in ""The Jororo Kill"" episode of this season, the Ed Russler character was played by Burr De Benning, but in ""The Jororo Farewell"" episode of Magnums 4th Season, Ed Russler gets played by John Saxon instead of Burr DeBenning for some reason even though Russler was supposedly the person and same character meeting up with Magnum again for a second time in MAGNUM's Fourth Season 2 years later in the Winter of 1984 since ""The Jororo Kill"" episode was shown for the very first time on CBS in the Winter of 1982.

So now I am anxiously and eagerly awaiting for Magnum's 8th Season to be released on DVD on Tuesday March 4th, 2008.

I also noticed that this was the season when T.C. started calling Higgins ""Higgy Baby"" more often along with the fact that Magnum's fallouts with Higgins, TC, and Rick were a lot more hilarious in this season than they were in the last 5 seasons of this private detective show, but the only problem I have with this 1981-1982 Season DVD is that it freezes & skips too much, especially in the episodes ""Wave Goodbye"" & ""One More Summer"" which is probably due to this season box set being put on double-sided discs instead of single-sided discs like the last 3 seasons of MAGNUM, P.I. which have no flaws, freezes, or skips on them which is why I'm hoping Universal will re-release this season on 1-sided discs soon to avoid all the frustration of getting all those freezing & skipping interruptions.

I also used to get a kick out of Higgins exclaiming his frequent used line of ""Oh My God"" and Magnum's often used line in his narrations of ""I Know What You're Thinking"" throughout all the episodes during MAGNUM's whole 1980-88 run on CBS. This season also takes me all the way back to memory lane when CBS's motto was ""Reach For The Stars"" and when Selleck was voted as TV's sexiest detective back in the early 1980's as well as his second year of being a superstar.

It was also interesting seeing guest stars like
*Joanna Kerns in ""The Last Page"" episode before her co-starring days as Maggie Seaver on GROWING PAINS

*Julie Sommars in the ""Texas Lightning"" episode before her co-starring days on MATLOCK

*Beverly Garland in the ""Two Minus Three"" episode before her co-starring days on the detective drama SCARECROW & MRS. KING

*James Whitmore, Jr. in the ""Billy Joe Bob"" episode before his co-starring days as Hunter & McCall's incompetent fellow officer(Det. Bernie Terwilliger) on the police drama HUNTER

*Tyne Daly in ""The Jororo Kill"" episode before her co-starring days on the police drama CAGNEY & LACY

*Football celebrity(Dick Butkus)in the ""One More Summer"" episode before his co-starring days on the sitcom MY TWO DADS

*Judith Chapman in ""The Woman On The Beach"" episode before her co-starring days on YOUNG & THE RESTLESS, DAYS OF OUR LIVES, and ALL MY CHILDREN

*Nancy Grahn in the ""Try To Remember"" episode after her co-starring days on GENERAL HOSPITAL & ONE LIFE TO LIVE & before her co-starring days on SANTA BARBARA

*Pat Morita in the ""One More Summer"" episode before his co-starring days on THE KARATE KID and HAPPY DAYS

Additionally, this season takes me all the way back to memory lane to when we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had back in 1981-1982 when Ronald Reagan was the president. So now that Universal has all 8 seasons of MAGNUM out on DVD, hopefully this has inspired Warner Bros. to finally put the private detective drama MATT HOUSTON with Lee Horseley & Pamela Hensley out on DVD soon, since I've been waiting for MAGNUM's biggest rival MATT HOUSTON to be released on DVD for years now, especially throughout all the years I'd been awaiting for all 8 seasons of MAGNUM, PI to be put on DVD, since MATT HOUSTON was also a cool TV show that was in competition with MAGNUM throughout MATT HOUSTON's 3-year run on ABC, not to mention the amazing slight resemeblence between Thomas Magnum(Tom Selleck) and Matlock Houston(Lee Horseley), except Houston was a lot huskier, a lot tougher, a lot spunkier, and a lot more fortunate than Magnum was since Magnum was just a beach-bum private detective who lived on a shoe-string budget rent-free at the so-called Robin Masters estate in Hawaii barely able to stay afloat, but Houston was a filthy-rich Texas style private detective & former Vietnam veteran who lived in the L.A. Area to take over a family business overseas who did detective work on the side as a hobby and lived high on the hog in a ritzy penthouse in Hollywood.

Therefore Magnum was always broke and Houston never was since Houston was 3 times luckier than Magnum ever was since Houston was a playboy who was always rolling in dough living in luxury & owned all his cars & vehicles and often had pretty women around him and even more chicks than Magnum ever had around him too & had a PI agency office of his own in Downtown L.A., unlike Magnum who didn't even have an office or even own a car, plus Houston frequently paid people money in $100 bills to get information to find leads to help solve his investigations. Therefore you could say that MATT HOUSTON was like a rich-mans MAGNUM especially since Magnum(Tom Selleck)was outclassed by Houston(Lee Horseley)along with the fact that Magnum could never even touch Houston since Houston lived the kind of lifestyle that Magnum envied & would have preffered to have, especially on a private investigators salary along with the fact that Magnum often used to get snookered by his clients a lot more often than Houston did just like Rockford(James Garner)did, which somewhat almost makes it seem so amazing how MAGNUM was able to outlast MATT HOUSTON, despite the fact that MATT HOUSTON was a private-eyes fantasy kind of show which made it a lot less realistic than most other private detective shows like MANNIX, THE ROCKFORD FILES, and SIMON & SIMON for instance.

In fact during MATT HOUSTONs whole 1982-85 run on ABC, various people used to tease Lee Horsley by asking him if he was trying to copy Tom Selleck, but Horsley would always reply back to them by saying ""No, but I'm flattered you see a resemblence"" & would never take it personally even though he knew people who asked him would just do that to irritate him on purpose, because of knowing that MATT HOUSTON was a very popular TV show in the 80's just like MAGNUM was, despite the fact that MATT HOUSTON didn't last nearly as long as MAGNUM, PI did since MATT HOUSTON tanked after it's 3-year run on ABC when MATT HOUSTON lost a lot of viewers thru MIAMI VICE when it debuted on NBC in the Fall of 1984.

Unfortunately MATT HOUSTON took a nose-dive in the ratings when it hit its Third Season on ABC when MIAMI VICE made its debut on NBC in the Fall of 1984 which led to MATT HOUSTONs cancellation in the Spring of 1985 when MAGNUM's Sixth Season was underway on CBS, but part of what makes this 1981-82 Season of MAGNUM, PI so interesting is knowing that MATT HOUSTON wasn't even made yet when MAGNUM was in this season or in the 1st Season for that matter either since MATT HOUSTON didn't make its debut on CBS's rival network ABC till the Fall of 1982 when MAGNUM kicked off its Third Season on ABC's rival network CBS along with the fact that MATT HOUSTON had more action in it than MAGNUM, PI did on top of that.

As a matter of fact, MATT HOUSTON premiered on ABC on Sunday September 26th, 1982 which coincidentally happened to be on the same night KNIGHT RIDER made its debut on NBC, but MAGNUM, P.I. made its debut on CBS on Thursday December 11th, 1980 since MAGNUM premiered in the late Fall of 1980 2 years before MATT HOUSTON even came along.

Fortunately, MATT HOUSTON was never shown on the same night as MAGNUM, PI was, which definitely would have contributed to MAGNUM losing some viewers thru MATT HOUSTON, but throughout most of MATT HOUSTONS 3-Season run on ABC, we'd all get to watch MATT HOUSTON the day after watching MAGNUM, P.I. since MAGNUM was shown every Thursday night at 8PM on CBS and MATT HOUSTON was shown on ABC every Friday night at 10PM which made us all able to watch them both on the same week which eliminated any scheduling conflicts since MAGNUM & MATT HOUSTON were both on 2 different nights at 2 different time slots on 2 different networks, but it seemed almost as if MATT HOUSTON had came close to killing MAGNUM, PI during MATT HOUSTONs first 2 seasons on ABC since Magnum's lifestyle couldn't even touch Houston's lifestyle either. In fact, something else I've noticed is every other person who has guest starred on MAGNUM, PI has also guest starred on MATT HOUSTON too such as Robin Dearden, Ed Grover, Alan Fudge, Steven Keats, Marta Dubois, Jill St. John, Cameron Mitchell, Burr DeBenning, Beverly Garland, Robert F. Lyons, James Fujioka, John Calvin, John-Dennis Johnston, Barbara Rush, Cesar Romero, Alan Hale, William Windom, Russ McCubbin, Lenore Kasdorf, Bill Lucking, Jack Hogan, Nancy Grahn, Dick Butkus, George Kee-Cheung, Katherine Cannon, Rebecca Holden, Jack Kruschen, James Luisi, Jenny Sherman, etc.

This detective drama also takes me back to the days before we had cell-phones, Internet, emails, and before sex, violence, swearing, & bad manners took over & corrupted television & when TV was much cleaner & trustworthy enough to watch. In the meantime, I just got word that Paramount will finally be releasing MATT HOUSTON-Season 1 on DVD on Tuesday March 9th, 2010 and that Shout will be releasing SIMON & SIMON-Season 4 out on DVD on Tuesday April 6th, 2010, which gives us 2 private detective dramas in the works to look forward to in the Spring of 2010.",1200614400,2,16250,4.818083961248655

2219829,4,B0007LXP86,"Most everyone knows this is an excellent detective series filmed in beautiful Hawaii. What I would like to mention that makes the DVD sets better than most is that the menu for each episode shows the airdate and a short synopsis of what the episiode is about. In addition each set includes a couple episodes of another TV series from the period. This set includes an ""A-Team"" and ""Knight Rider"" episode from their second seasons. So in addition to watching this great season of Magnum, P.I. I got to view a couple other TV series. I recommend all the Magnum series. My only complaint is the picture quality is not consistently sharp. Some parts do not look cleaned up. Otherwise I would give it five stars.",1184976000,3,706,4.611111111111111

We had them for a few days when a storm caused us to lose power off and on for 3 days...thankfully I had 3 of my four hour batteries charged for our compact DVD player. We spent 4 hours the first night of the storms watching Magnum. We had forgotten that the theme music had been changed, kind of strange at first.

We have been very happy with the quality of the DVD's so far and are anxiously awaiting for season 7 and 8 to be released.",1182902400,,565,4.174311926605505

2219832,3,B0007LXP86,"The first season of Magnum was plagued by poor production values, poor acting by the extras (and often the guest stars too), and a ""sameness"" that made watching episodes close together (as happens when you have a DVD) a little dull.  With the second season, all these issues are alleviated to a great degree (although not entirely eliminated), and the show becomes more fun to watch.

It's not that the average episode is written much better - that will have to wait for later seasons, although the last disc in Season two is solid from top to bottom.  No, it's that the characters are now in full form and the stories are richer for the interplay between the 4 main characters (Magnum, Higgins, TC and Rick).  In fact, the extended universe starts to finally take the form it would keep for the rest of the series, with first appearances by Michelle (Magnum's wife), Agatha (if not the character, at least the actress), and the first of Higgin's legendary half-brothers (Elmo Ziller, from Texas, which allowed us to finally hear John Hillerman's real accent!).  Similarly, the shows ""feel"" more like Magnum, leaving some episodes with bittersweet conclusions, and others without real conclusions at all - like the episode ""Mad Buck Gibson"" where we never learn if Mad Buck survives his last death-defying stunt.  Why not?  Well, it wasn't the point of the show, and the show ends just as it should, with Mad Buck appealing to Magnum mano-a-mano and talking him into allowing him to try hang-gliding to Maui.

Unfortunately, I had to deduct a star for the quality of the DVD set.  Like all 2-sided DVD's, it's difficult to keep both faces clean, so there were issues with episodes seizing up, or the menu not initialising, etc.  Similarly, the presence of the intrusive and extremely annoying Universal fanfare at the beginning of every single episode - luckily the first chapter break occurs right after the theme, but it's still annoying to have to skip ahead every time (Columbo Season 2 has the same thing - what were the Universal execs thinking?!).  Finally, there are no extras, except a couple episodes from other shows (A-Team and Knight Rider), although these episodes do set off how well Magnum has aged relative to other pop-dramas made at the time.",1141430400,15,2261,4.831606217616581
2219833,1,B0007LXP86,"Another reviewer, Mick Black from Cleveland had it right. The video skipped and stopped cold on a few episodes. I carefully cleaned the disks, and the same thing happened.

2219838,5,B0007LXP86,"Magnum, P.I. is a classic TV show that never ages.  Although the clothing can be humorous, the acting is timeless and the scenary is breathtaking as it ever was...both the actual coastline AND the Ferrari! :-)

Season One was great, and Season Two doesn't disapoint either.  Tom, T.C., Rick, and Higgins are at their best after a season of getting into the groove of working with each other, and I think it shows in the comradery and chemistry that they have in the second season of the show.  It is not a stretch to believe that the Tom, T.C., and Rick served in Vietnam together, or that Higgins and Magnum really DO have a love/hate relationship.  Which can only mean that they did their acting job really, really well.

After watching the first two seasons, the only thing that I was left to ask was, ""WHEN ARE THEY COMING OUT WITH SEASON THREE?!""  It can't be soon enough for me.

Recommendation for purchase (as opposed to renting it) of this series: ***** (5 Stars)!",1121385600,23,973,4.551724137931035
2219839,5,B0007LXP86,"Hi all, I am a huge fan of Magnum PI which I regard as simply the best television series I have ever seen. I have read the comments on season Two and clearly I am not alone in the way I felt about the show. I am not writing this to review season two, I am writing this because I cannot get it!! I live in the UK and we have a different region format from the US, what this means is the series available in the US is not playable on a dvd machine here. You guys are region 1 and the UK is region 2.

Amazon over here have not released the second season on region 2

and seem unable to tell me when they will. It's driving me nuts and Im considering buying a multi region dvd player that will enable me to order and watch the US version but huge fan that I am that seems a bit drastic, getting another player when I already have a perfectly good one simply to watch Magnum PI. I have a laptop, it's a Dell model. I know it can play my season 1 Magnum dvd's but I got season 1 here on region 2(ours) format.

Im no computer boffin but was wondering if a laptop could play the US( region 1) dvd. If so I can order season 2 from the US and play it on my laptop thus saving the cost of buying a multi region player. Can anyone reading this help me here?? Someone who knows more about laptops than I do. Thanks Chomp.",1117497600,4,1310,3.8805970149253732
2219840,5,B0007LXP86,"Again, I have to say this is my favorite show of all time (Firefly is a close second) . . . I was just hoping to see some extras.  You can't beat bloopers.  If you don't have bloopers, have some interviews or something.  Knight Rider?  Blah!  I smile every single time I hear the theme at the beginning . . . and I watch the intro on every episode.  There will never be another Higgins.",1116720000,7,386,4.08
2219841,5,B0007LXP86,"The best duo on TV in the 1980's (and since) was Selleck and Hillerman. How could a show go wrong with those two? The funniest part of this show was when Selleck would look into the camera whenever something crazy or ironic would occur. About the lack of extras: get over it. At least they fixed the annoying problem of getting the discs out of their holders. It costs money to compilate interviews, bloopers, and photos, and Universal isn't willing to spend the money. Cest la Vie.",1116633600,4,482,4.551724137931035
2219842,5,B0007LXP86,"I know what you're thinking ... but Magnum P.I. has held up really well over the years, and it's SO much better without all the commercials. I almost feel a guilty rush watching as one scene segues right into the next! Basically, Magnum has never looked better.

The core charaters - Magnum, Higgins, Rick and T.C. - had a real chemistry, and you could watch the show just for their banter and friendships. The guest star performances haven't aged as gracefully, maybe because the characters only have 45-48 minutes to develop, and the plots are only as sophisticated as that time allows.

But, every time I watch an episode, it's like a trip back to Hawaii in 1981. It all works together. The depth of the main characters, and the writing, is several notches better than anything else I remember on television, and the setting has its own charm. The Ferrari still looks great, and the Robin Masters estate is timeless. I don't think I would willingly watch any of the other shows of that era now, but now I realize what solid actors Selleck and John Hillerman were/are.

Highly recommended - and the packaging for Season Two is a lot better than Season One (Those discs are hard to remove and the plastic retaining pieces broke right away - the separate plastic cases for Season Two are really the way it should be done).

And if you want to see how bad everything else was, check out the Simon and Simon episode in Season One and the A-Team episode here.",1116288000,7,1456,4.567049808429119

2219844,2,B0007LXP86,"Okay, I'm going to give you the real dirt on this one.  I have never ever reviewed a DVD set on Amazon, but felt that someone needed to print a honest review about this set and not the series itself.  I think I speak for most diehard magnum fans, when I say that I had the entire series on VHS tapes for many years before this series even came out on DVD.  After season one came out, I threw away all my tapes so that I could watch the series in all it's DVD glory! I was hoping for tons of extras, behind the scenes, and photo's, interviews...whatever!!!!  After watching season one and anxiously waiting for season two, I reluctantly went out and bought it after reading it's dustjacket.  I went home and opened it,read it, and watched it and found it very lacking.  I just wish someone would write about whats in the DVD package other than the TV series itself for a change. Okay, first of all, this series was on top of the Nielson ratings for years.  It has a huge following here in the U.S. as well as the rest of the world.  It is still being played on cable, and many parts of the world.  It played for 8 years and there must be tons of things that they could have put into this dvd package.  Let me say that the extras that you get in this dvd set are, an episode of the A-Team and an episode from KnightRider....two shows that I hate!  If I had wanted to watch either one of these two lame shows, I would have gone out and bought them on dvd.  I did not want them but I'm stuck with em..never even watched em. There are ABSOLUTELY NO OTHER EXTRAS in this set.  At least season one had a couple of extra episodes that I could enjoy.  No pictures, no interviews, no ""making of""....NO NOTHING!  Second, the DVD's are on back to back dvd's, meaning you have to go and flip the darn dvd over to watch the other episodes in the season (yeah, minor point cuz you would have to get up anyway, but it looks cheap)...what's up with that?  With the cost of dvds so low now, they couldn't even make each section have it's own dvd? There isn't even any design on the dvds themselves, it's only a plain silver dvd.  Third, the dvd's are boxed in a separate dvd case for each section.(at least the first season has a foldout pictured case)..for a total of 3 dvd's, back to back.  The plastic cases look like the ones you see at walmart, housing the $1.00 dvd movies...THIS SET LOOKS AND FEELS SOOO CHEAP!!!  I don't know, maybe it's me, but I really expected more from this set. If I'm going to drop $40.00 on this set, then why couldn't they have put in some extras and stuff.  Okay there you have it, this set sucks.  I wish I hadn't had thrown away my VHS tapes.  I have been loyal and bought this set cuz I love the series so much, but am REALLY THINKING ABOUT NOT BUYING THE THIRD INSTALLMENT.  If anyone that matters is reading this, please take it to heart and make some changes...you have GOT TO HAVE ACCESS TO EXTRAS FOR THIS SERIES, it was on the top for so many years.  I feel that it is doing this series a great disservice, and I feel that it's tainting the reputation of MAGNUM P.I. after all, I can't believe that Tom Selleck or anyone at Universal would have given approval for this DVD set.  My low rating is not for the show, after all I've seen every episode at least 20 times, but for what this is, a DVD set. Most people buy DVD sets for the extras, but buyer beware on this one, you may consider sticking to your VHS tapes.",1115424000,9,3440,4.183611532625189
2219845,5,B0007LXP86,"One of the top rated shows on the 1980s decade, Magnum, P.I. thrilled audiences with its exotic setting and fast-paced action. Winner of multiple Emmys and Golden Globes, the show was a mainstay in the Top 20 Nielsen Ratings. Its Vietnam flashbacks (exploring the combat experiences of the main characters) were widely lauded, and Magnum, P.I. is considered the first television series to give recognition to the obstacles faced by Vietnam Veterans reentering American society. The range of topics, combined with a clever wit and heightened suspense, make Magnum, P.I. one of the more widely appealing TV series of its era...

Magnum, P.I. covers the life of Thomas Magnum (Tom Selleck), a former Naval Intelligence officer who resigns his position in order to set up his own private investigation business in Oahu, Hawaii. Through either luck or acquaintance, he lands a job as head of security for bestselling author Robin Masters' luxurious beachfront estate. This enables Magnum to drive around in Masters' sporty flame-red Ferrari, make use of various high-tech toys, and live a life of relative ease in the estate's guest house. But Magnum constantly butts heads with estate manager Jonathan Higgins (John Hillerman), a former British military man in his own right, and one with a strict penchant for order and discipline. Despite their conflicts, Magnum and Higgins maintain a healthy friendship, while Magnum's friends Rick Wright (Larry Manetti) and T.C. Calvin (Roger E. Mosley) are forever being drawn into Magnum's dangerous investigations...

The Magnum, P.I. (Season 2) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere ""Billy Joe Bob"" in which Magnum is hired by the rambunctious Texan Billy Joe Bob Little to help uncover the whereabouts of his missing sister Carol Anne. But Magnum's hands are full with both an investigation and Billy Joe Bob to take care of... Other notable episodes from Season 2 include ""From Moscow to Maui"" in which a Soviet defector hires Magnum to help facilitate the defection of his Olympic athlete girlfriend, and ""Mad Buck Gibson"" a hilarious episode in which Magnum is hired by Mad Buck Gibson's ex-wife to make sure that the adventurous author lives long enough to pay her the alimony she's due. But Mad Buck's shenanigans make the job a tall order for Magnum...
