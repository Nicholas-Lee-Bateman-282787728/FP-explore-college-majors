8587363,5,B00CXV905K,"Just received my DVD and seller shipped it very fast.  The quality of the dvd is excellent with nice shorts between the songs where the Jug Band is discussing things and practicing, a sort of behind the scene quality.  I wasn't able to attend the reunion show but this was excellent.  Camera angles and closeups made me feel like I was there at an SAJB show.

Buy this DVD today!  You'll like it.",1369958400,,396,4.36986301369863
