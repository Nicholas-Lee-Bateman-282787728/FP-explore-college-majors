8631386,2,B00278U1XE,Wow! Update please! A new mom being 28 I was bored and started to be uninterested. The moms were very dull and you could hardly hear them over screaming kids. Nice to see kids interact and the songs were very cute as well which my daughter LOVED. So if it was updated (clothing/background etc) and songs with parents and kids were in a seperate chapter where mommy and baby could learn and see/play together if be more satisfied. It did cover a lot of basis so I can't complain too much.,1431043200,,487,4.362637362637362
