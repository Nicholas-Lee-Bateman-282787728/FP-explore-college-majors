440139,1,6302240980,"In 1973, many people were excited by he chaos of modern leftist life and no doubt welcomed this sort of scatter-brained and nonsensical comedy.  It helped too if you smoked funny cigarettes.

The title, Slither, is unexplained.  (There are no snakes).  The script is embarrassingly weak.  (How about Peter Boyle imitating Billy Eckstine.)  The acting is only fair.  And the entire film has nothing to say and isn't funny.

Oh, the joys of those wacky people, especially when they are contrasted with ordinary Americans, who, say, play bingo in a trailer court. A classic turkey.",1348358400,,578,5.010526315789473
440140,5,6302240980,"This movie is so absurd and that's precisely what makes it so great. I love the characters, too. This film is completely priceless. If you like awkward, screwball comedies, 'Slither"" is  perfect for you!",1330732800,4,203,4.970588235294118
440141,4,6302240980,"Most people recognize James Caan from his role as Sonny in Godfather, and his films made in the 90's such as Misery and Honeymoon in Vegas. He has always been a charismatic actor, but his film roles have seemed to be few and far between. Here we have a young Caan as leading man in a film called Slither from 1973, not to be confused with the Slither of 2006 which was a cheesy horror film. As leading man Caan did an excellent job in Michael Mann's debut feature Thief, but other than that we haven't seen much from his younger days. This film really is hard to categorize, it starts out as kind of an action film which later turns into a mystery. Other notable actors include a young Peter Boyle, who was quite an excellent character actor, Sally Kellerman who was quite beautiful in this film (sans blonde hair as in MASH), and Allen Garfield who made quite a few appearances in 70's films. The story goes from the point where Caan who plays Dick Knipsia travels with fellow inmate Harry Moss to Moss's home after both were let out of prison. Upon arriving some strangers watching afar in a big black van attack both characters and shoot up Harry pretty bad. As his dying breath Harry tells Dick about a cache of money and who to contact in order to obtain this money. Knipsia must find Harry's old partner then find the money, which results into quite a road movie where Caan's character meets an assortment of very interesting characters. I absolutely love Sally Kellerman, her character is so eccentric. The viewer has two big questions lingering until the very end of the film, who are the killers and where is the money. This film is very strange, at times dark and at times funny, it is pretty much a hodge podge of the times. The 1970s was the greatest decade of film making in my opinion, there are just so many major and minor pictures that are so interesting. This film has great performances by all, but the story probably will not appeal to everyone. That being said i would recommend this film to any James Caan fan or Sally Kellerman fan. This film also has a nice appearance from Alex Rocco, a favorite character actor of mine memorable as Moe Greene from the Godfather. This dvd is a dvr from Warner Brothers, but it played fine on my blu ray player. The picture quality is excellent but the disc has absolutely no special features. This film isn't a classic but I would watch it anyday over all the mediocre films being put out now.",1318118400,,2452,4.463251670378619
440142,3,6302240980,"No, this movie has nothing to do with snakes. It does have James Caan as a just released from prison car thief getting involved with a hunt for money and running across an assorted variety of crazy characters in California. Richard B. Shull singing ""Happy Days Are Here Again"" really stuck in my mind. And dig that house explosion early in the film. Not a bad movie. Not a great movie. Something to watch on a lazy Sunday afternoon.",1315180800,2,432,4.481012658227848

440144,4,6302240980,"Product was in good condition. Warner has done a great job in its restoration. Color was vivid and the quality was first rate. The film itself was not as funny, or as engaging as I remembered it.  The story is rather airy to say the least and the ending is a real cop-out.  A few amusing bits here and there, with Caan giving a good performance, but there actually needed to a plot here and when it comes right down to it, there was none. Overall though the Warner Brothers Archives is still a terrific product line that allows you to see films that otherwise are not available on DVD, so in that regards it was still a great purchase and I would suggest people shop for products in the Warner archives because it is a good service for film collectors.",1286064000,3,752,4.326241134751773
440145,3,6302240980,"""Slither"" is the cinematic equivalent of fast food.  It holds your interest but after it's over a sense of apathy falls over you.  The problem here is W.D. Richter's oh so cutesy script.  Richter is attempting something offbeat but it all seems so self conscious.  Some of it works most of it doesn't.  A game cast is on hand (James Caan, Peter Boyle, Sally Kellerman and numerous first rate character actors) but even they can't elevate this flick beyond the mundane.  Check it out if you must but be forwarned about disappointment considering the talent on hand here.",1267920000,2,569,4.755102040816326
440146,4,6302240980,"When critics do their lists of the great screen couples, bet you ten-to-one they'll overlook this duo. James Caan and Sally Kellerman are a wild pair of would-bes: he's an ex-con, she's a sexy, daffy schizophrenic. Throw in Peter Boyle and Louise Lasser as a nutty pair of suburbanites who go along for the ride and you've got a comedy classic. Deadpan jokes, unforced direction, a wild chase scene. True genius!",978220800,8,412,4.816901408450704
440147,5,6302240980,"Although not a big fan of any of the main actors here, with the possible exception of Boyle, this is nevertheless a great screwball comedy.  Fine comic plot involving the search for illicit money that works itself out perfectly, memorable comic characters, including eccentric subsidiary ones like Shull and Garfield, and just the exact right pace.  An untrumpeted masterpiece.  Truly memorable",969753600,9,394,5.426229508196721

7822742,5,6302240980,"Having 'Slither' in your personal film library is essential.
Let me add it again: having 'Slither' in your personal film library is essential.
This film puts the 'I' back in hipster.
While so many others are standing in line, forced to split the atom before they can order a cup of coffee,
you (and others who have 'Slither' in their personal film library)
can be elsewhere sharing the highest and speediest of mellow.
(It's criminal this film has to be 'an on demand' product.)
'Slither' should still be a regularly produced dvd like still in print 'Catcher In The Rye'
and ""On The Road'.",1417737600,,589,4.673076923076923
7822743,2,6302240980,"""Slither"" refers to the fact that the plot and its criminal characters both slither around.  It also dawned on me that in searching for a cool hippy-type title, the big American car pulling a shiny silver trailer down the highways could be something like a snake.

I watched this mainly to see the California I remember of my early teens.  Around San Francisco were plenty of types as shown in this film, especially the goof around drinker hippy girl played by Kellerman, later known as Hot Lips Hooligan on Mash.  We kids on our tenspeed bikes were afraid of these shouting and swearing hippies in a primal instinctive way.

But any fascination with outlaws or hippy runaway cool chicks with long flowing hAir vanished quickly as the film crept along.  It is such a slow-moving plot that one is tempted to take long breaks in the middle of it with a fairly sure bet you will miss very little.

I was watching also for the cars and clothes and hair and just plain that old feeling of being young again in hippy San Francisco as a child looking from the outside.  Yet the scenes show so much of the two main male crooks simply yakking indoors somewhere in a lethargic and edgy way that the viewer feels bored and cheated.

James Caan as a newly released car thief seems a goody two shoes by today's comparison.  He seems clean, remorseful, self-controlled and respectful of others.  He and his old buddy harry fenaka are the type of crooks who appear normal and middle class to outsiders in clothes and behavior.  Their long road trip with Harry's wife Mary, ever chirpy and happy Louise Lasser, could fool any cop into thinking it is some family vacation trip in their silver camper.

Unfortunately for this viewer, it is so long and boring with stupid flat joked intermittent chat, mostly focused in these two guys in a car or house or cafe, that I couldn't stand it any more.  The famous ""bingo hall fistfight"" where truly boring bingo players fight each other is a horrible yawn.  Was it me?  Do I just not get what interesting fellows these guys truly were underneath?  That Mary Fenaka is a fascinating and wonderful person to listen to?

It is true that I had just seen the Blues Brothers film and loved the humor and singing and stripmall police smash up  scene.  If you have seen It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World with people chasing all over California highways in the 1970's looking for hidden money, and you liked its action and goody humor, you will hate this Dosteveskyian version.

Turgid would be the word.",1416614400,,2516,4.571428571428571
