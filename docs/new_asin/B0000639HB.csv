7958913,2,B0000639HB,"I loved the G force episodes and would love to see the Gatchaman series (without subtitles) but I know why now I did not watch BOTP as a child, cause of goofy 7 Zark 7, 1 rover 1...that by no means disrespect to Casey Kasem as Eagle 1 and Alan Young from Mr. ED (Wilbur) but sound quality and animation quality could definately get an upgrade. I collected the first few volumes but I would rather get Dubbed titles of G force or Gatchaman.",1030060800,4,439,4.238095238095238
7958914,5,B0000639HB,"The picture quality on the BOTP episodes are fair -- but I remember as a child it was only fair when it originally aired, so no surprises there!  The corresponding Japanese Gatchaman episodes are much better, with uncut story lines that make much more sense than the sanitized, BOTP version (and no 7-Zark-7, thank goodness!).  The bonus G-Force episode is let down only by a mind-numbing, disco-thumping sountrack that fills every ""hole"" left by the original Gatchaman soundtrack.
Otherwise, this is a great trip down memory lane with good packaging.  It's a good testament to how unique this cartoon really was, and how it's still good enough to hold the interest of children and adults alike (especially the Gatchaman episodes, once you get used to the subtitles).  As much as I was a superhero-holic -- and to a small extent, I still am -- G-Force was and is my absolute favorite good guy team.  ""Transmute"" and enjoy!",1021507200,7,922,4.8471337579617835
