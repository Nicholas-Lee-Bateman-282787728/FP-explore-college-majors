8505020,1,B006VJ19OA,"This is the 2nd worst movie I have ever sat through. I love robots and thought that alone would make this movie of some interest. The first and largest flaw is the writing. None of the dialog is believable and so every word seems forced. Then there is the horrible acting that doesn't even begin to feel natural especially coupled with said writing.

There is not much plot to summarize here. Robots begin killing and it is still the most boring string of events imaginable. Mostly just our ""heros"" hiding in warehouses and behind planks of wood. The only slightly good scene was to see hand to hand combat with a robot where they could easily hold its arms back and beat it with sticks and pipes. It was never explained why all the robots were builtin with firearms and flamethrowers. You would be hard pressed to find any further entertainment from this garbage. Hopefully someone is pretty ashamed of themselves right now.",1388707200,,925,4.674846625766871

8505022,3,B006VJ19OA,"With Robopocalypse on the horizon, Robotropolis is likely to get a lot more publicity.  Its a not-quite futuristic take on an automated world gone mad  with robots of course.

Robotropolis begins with a found-footage scene of a BURD-3 robot gone mad. This is not, as some reviews have suggested, the end of the plot indicating that humanity is doomed in some kind of Terminator-esque apocalypse.  It is in fact test footage of a prototype that was covered up, indicating that the robot servants were a very bad idea to begin with.

With that grim scene setting the stage, we move to an island off of China and a demo-colony known as New Town.  Mega Corp (theres not a creative names in this movie) is planning to release these robots to the public in a civil capacity, despite the fact that up to that point theyve been used primarily as war machines.

We follow Christiane Noveau (Zoe Naylor) as she reports on the action in real time, breathlessly taking in a playful soccer match between robot and human  and then something goes horribly awry.  Mind you, theres never any explanation as to why civilian robots are armed with everything from guns to chainsaws to flamethrowers, but its not long before a robo-revolution erupts and the BURDs begin exterminating tearing through the human population like butter.

Running throughout the narrative is a commentary on the state of media.  Christine has a curious relationship with her producer, who guides every scene like an omniscient deity.  He is opposed by millionaire inventor Gordon Standsh (Lani John Tupu, you may recall him from Farscape), who waffles between losing his temper and demanding everything be shut down to trying to salvage whats left of his reputation.

The CGI robots are adequate for the most part.  They become particularly terrifying when they resort to running on four limbs, more dog-like than humanoid, but in several scenes they seem very fake. And the slaughte3r is egregious  the robots seem to have an endless supply of weapons and ammunition, as likely to wear intestines like a necklace as they are to smash a mans head.

Careful viewers will see that there is an explanation as to why the robots run amuck. Its not necessarily a coherent reason, but its a reason, and once we find that out Robotropolis has nowhere to go, so it just ends.  Thats right, this is one of those movies that knows better than to stick around after delivering on reams of robo-riots.

Robotropolis isn't a bad film.  Its just not particularly ambitious.  Fans looking for robot slaughter will not be disappointed.",1386460800,,2576,4.851258581235698
8505023,1,B006VJ19OA,"This is the worst movie ever. It should be wiped off the face of the Earth. Don't buy it, don't rent it, don't watch it.",1378684800,,120,3.84
8505024,3,B006VJ19OA,"If you like sci-fi with robots then this may intetest you. The special effects were something different. Nice seeing Zoe aka reporter in a tight white vest. Slow paced, not enough action. Man vs machine, set in the future.",1373932800,,222,4.717948717948718
8505025,1,B006VJ19OA,"I love low budget cheesy B Sci-Fi movies. I really do. The campier the better. So i got this assuming that the negative reviews were people expecting a blockbuster, but this was just awful. I can't even think of anything constructive to say about this one.....",1356739200,,260,4.673913043478261
8505026,3,B006VJ19OA,"The movie has an interesting premise, but I didn't find it captivating. The special effects were decent -- reminded me of SyFy's Battlestar Galactica. Fan's of this movie will like Robocop.",1334880000,,189,5.129032258064516
8505027,1,B006VJ19OA,"This is billed as some sort of war zone robot versus human in a desperate fight to the death; a sort of `Terminator' meets `I Robot', the reality is so far removed. So where does it go wrong? Well the synopsis is that a group of investigative reporters are despatched to do a piece from `New Town', this is an oil mining facility somewhere in the South China Seas. It is owned and run by forward thinking Mega National Industries.

Once there the CEO tells them that this is basically `the future' in that robots are now fully integrated. They do all the jobs we can't be arsed with, like routine maintenance, security and taking the kids to school. They are all alike except for some security markings and look like a poor version of the Storm troopers from Star Wars - only poorly done in CGI. Whilst the `reporters' are doing a piece to camera, of an innocent game of `soccer. One robot ""catastrophically malfunctions""! Well it shoots one of the other players and this is live on the news feed. This then becomes a `Killbot!!' and as the news is fed all around the less than interested world, the fortunes of Mega Naffall Industries start to wane.

What happens next is an exercise in how to save production costs. I once saw a film producer say that the best invention for film ever, was the telephone. He demonstrated by picking up his phone and screaming `what you mean Godzilla has eaten New York!?!' This would apparently save three million dollars. Well director Christopher Hatton has come up with a newish way, he has the anchor man in the news room have the reporter tell him what is going on in New Town as the camera has been eaten by a killbot ; so we are told that thousands have died and even more are on the streets fighting the robots. The only news reel we can see shows six lack lustre fifth rate `actors' doing a ropey pretence of running away from some killbots who are armed with everything from electric carving knives, to flame throwers. The anchor man says at one point `for those of you that pray, this would be a good time'; well I started praying to the gods of decent acting, good continuity, plot development and production values - alas my prayers were left unanswered.

This third rate, badly acted guff continued for a bowel shatteringly, boring 81 minutes, it would have made a better comedy but in the end it is a big idea versus a small budget and I guess the budget just won. The ending is seen lumbering before it is even over the horizon and by the time it happens you will be looking forward to watching a local news bulletin rather than endure any more of this unctuous tripe. I tried to like it and even laughed at one point, but it was for all the wrong reasons - this will appeal to no -one do yourself a favour even if you are tempted, just watch a community cable channel it will be time better spent.",1326585600,9,2849,4.402277039848197
