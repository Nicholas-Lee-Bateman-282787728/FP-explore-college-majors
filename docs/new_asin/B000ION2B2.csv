8447185,5,B000ION2B2,"Is this show really any good? It started off rather slow in the first volume, does it pick up at all? I bought the box and volume one, should I get the regular edition or limited edition? All three excellent questions to ask, all with the same answer, yes!

Simply, this show does have some slow spots, but this is where the series in attempting to show you the characters playing up the strengths and weaknesses of everyone involved. The first volume of the show on dvd is a little more than a basic introduction to the series as a whole. This is where the series begins to lay the foundation of events and storylines yet to come. When the second episode rolls around on this disc, we begin to discover more members of AX and that each member has their own story and problems to contend with. There is no clear line of good and evil as this episode plays out. By the end of the disc, momentum is carrying through these episodes, building on the emotion and story of the last one. As Silent Noise hits, we begin to get the scope of the overall storyline and the first major plot point leaves you begging for more and truly feeling for the characters. All basic introduction end, all basic setups are over, this disc bridges the gap from introduction to chapter one and it is one heck of a ride.

Now this edition, I must say is beautiful. The regular edition does not feature the extra booklet which is very informative and gives you more details about varying aspects of the show. The slip cover is beautiful and provide extra protection for your collection. The tarot cards are outstanding, and if you are a collector then this is definitely something to continue. Crisp, clean, and wonderful to look at the beautiful art featured on them. If you take pride in catching everything and all the goodies Volume 2 Ltd. Edition is the best way to go. If you just want the show and save a couple bucks, then definitely hit the regular edition. Both are well worth the money which ever way you may go.",1163808000,2,1996,4.435967302452316
