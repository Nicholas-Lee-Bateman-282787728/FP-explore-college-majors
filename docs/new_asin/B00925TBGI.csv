5243170,5,B00925TBGI,"You may have the historical 1963 black and white broadcast from Tanglewood that is available on DVD. Good as that was for its day this new recording is in a class of its own. Quite magical, surely one of the best classical blu-ray recordings to date. Everything about it is right: wonderful playing and singing, brilliant camera work and instrument selection and all played in Coventry Cathedral, the site of the first performance. Do not hesitate, this is just superb. Only grumble is that it is a very suitable subject for some background extras and there is nothing but the performance is still quite brilliant.",1349740800,6,614,4.857142857142857
5243171,5,B00925TBGI,"Britten is one of my favorite composers, and the War Requiem my favorite piece of religious choral music (others being Verdi's Requiem, Golijov's Passion and Gounod's St. Cecilia's Mass). Each of the soloists excels, but the performance really belongs to Mr. Nelsons, whose passion for the work transfigures his face to such a degree one feels he is about to levitate. I studied Wilfred Owens in college.  Britten has done a superb job of infusing the timeless liturgical text with Owens' apocalyptic and sadly prophetic condemnation of war.  This is the one version to have on DVD!",1380326400,,582,4.989690721649485
5243172,4,B00925TBGI,"Well, I must amend my initial review. My primary complaint (although I have plenty of others, including incorrect tempi, and the lack of boy trebles..) was the audio being limited to 2 channel stereo. Despite many helpful reviewers who assured me repeatedly that it IS actually in surround sound, all I could get was 2 channel stereo and there was NO audio menu anywhere which would allow me to change the format. Thinking it was an issue with my Sony player, I took the Blu-ray disc to a hi-end audio shop. Same results there too, even though we tried a variety of different players. Even the shop techs could not find any way to change the audio format.
Then one day I was driving along, minding my own business, thinking of anything but my utter disappointment with this disk, when I had a true epiphany! I couldn't wait to get home and try something. So once again I fired up my gear and started the DVD. No audio menu whatsoever. And then I STARTED the program. Once playback had begun, THEN I PRESSED the Popup Menu button on the Sony remote! And there it was! The Audio Format menu!! I was ecstatic! Still am. Now, instead of some very serious performance flaws dragging it down to a 1 star, I have gorgeous 5.1  surround sound bringing the one star up to a FOUR star review. Now if only someone could get Simon Rattle to put his performance on Blu-ray...THAT would be spectacular!!
Wow. I was really looking forward to sitting back and losing myself in this towering masterpiece. The video is as good as you should expect for a Blu-ray disc, but the audio is ONLY 2 channel stereo, and the resulting sound stage is too narrow to be of any use at all. If the specs had not listed Dolby 5.1 I would not have bothered buying it. I feel like I was lied to and now I am out $40. What a HUGE disappointment and a loss of $40. I guess I won't buy any more discs from this production company. Wish I had my $40 back.",1379289600,5,1916,4.337047353760446

5243175,5,B00925TBGI,"I hadn't heard Britten's War Requiem in a while but had talked about it recently with a friend and then I read a very positive review of this production. It did sound different from the original production(subjective reaction), but it was just as powerful as I remember. The singing is uniformly excellent. The musical direction of Andris Nelsons is way beyond expectation-it's very moving and gives new insight into this master work.

5243177,5,B00925TBGI,"Britten's War Requiem is one of the musical pinnacles of the 20th century.  The stories of its composition, first performance, and original performers are well known.  The Decca recording by the composer and many of the original forces remains, by general accord, unsurpassed.

Yet this new video is equally indispensable.  The performance commemorates the 50th anniversary of the 1962 premiere, which marked the opening of the rebuilt cathedral at Coventry.  It is the equal of Britten's in all respects.  The sound is even better, of course, and the setting--Basil Spence's remarkable edifice--underscores the intense emotional content.

I have loved the War Requiem ever since hearing it performed by Erich Leinsdorf and the Boston Symphony at (then) Philharmonic Hall soon after the American premiere at Tanglewood.  Andris Nelsons, the CBSO, and soloists keep the flame burning brightly.  Whether you are a longtime fan of the War Requiem or have yet to make its acquaintance, you must see and hear this recording.

Addenda  (May 2013):  Andris Nelsons has been appointed music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra.

(November 2013): Peter Rabinowitz in Fanfare includes this on his 2013 Want List, writing, ""The wrenching anniversary performance by Andris Nelsons, equally notable for the rhetorical force of its large paragraphs and for the precision of its details, will leave you shattered.""",1354665600,5,1405,5.419354838709677
5243178,5,B00925TBGI,"This production, performance and recording of Benjamin Britten's War Requiem marks the 50th anniversary of the commissioning of the new Coventry Cathedral, built to replace the medieval cathedral destroyed during the bombing of Coventry during WW2. The first performance was also played by the Birmingham orchestra as on this recording and featured an English tenor, a German baritone and an English soprano as commemorated here too. The original Russian soprano was not allowed to perform by the Russian government of the time because of the perceived political nature of the work.

Britten made a particularly famous recording of the work within a few months with the LSO and with the intended original trio of soloists. This went on to achieve a quarter of a million sales, my copy being one of them. The work had been set as one of the works to be studied in detail as part of the music `A' level exam that I was engaged upon. I was so struck by the setting of Owen's poems that I then bought a volume of his complete poems that I still own.

Britten's own recording was such a landmark both as a performance and as a recording that, even now, it represents a major challenge to any new recording of the work. That this anniversary recording is so successful is a remarkable achievement. That it is also by no means inferior to that of Britten's is even more remarkable even though there are some major differences which must be mentioned and which affect the balance of the overall effect.

The two main changes relate to the much slower tempo of the Dies Irae in particular and to the Sanctus to a somewhat lesser degree. This may be the result of the venue with the large reverberation factor to consider or maybe just a difference in emphasis. As a result, whatever the reason, the two sections do not drive ahead dramatically as they do with Britten, but instead achieve an effect of weighty power instead. To my mind this is just as appropriate as the performance still manages to sustain tension, just a different sort.

The soloists are all excellent with Mark Padmore communicating the Owen poetry with complete commitment and with tenor singing of the highest quality. He has a rounder tonal characteristic to that of Peter Pears. Hanno Muller-Brachmann makes for a fine baritone soloist who also sings with fine tone and without the accent problem detectable in Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau's delivery in Britten's recording. Erin Wall equally has a much more rounded tone than Galina Vishnevskaya on Britten's recording where her strident tones were always somewhat controversial. The choir is excellent in all respects as is the CBSO Youth Chorus.

Apart from the two tempi variants as mentioned above, Andris Nelsons adopts an approach that differs from that of Britten by being rather less driven but just as dramatically effective. Coupled with the benefits of the warmer tonal characteristics of his soloists and the qualities of the far newer recording, the whole effect is rather easier on the ear and allows the listener/viewer to appreciate the message of the Requiem even more. This was certainly true of my wife who has now changed from being a `refuser' to a supporter entirely on the basis of this performance and recording. It seems to me that Nelsons has managed to catch the mood of today's audience and to provide a performance of the War Requiem that relates strongly to that. Perhaps this is less strident but more humane - a difference of historical period?

The recording is visually strikingly crisp with wonderful detail of objects such as tubular bells, through more general shots such as larger groups of singers to distant views such as the youth choir positioned at the rear of the cathedral in front of the famous tapestry. This is one of the best visual recordings I have ever seen and, for me, marks a new level of visual technology. The sound is of equal merit, effortlessly encompassing the dynamic tonal range of Britten's endlessly imaginative scoring. In my opinion this is a triumph of the recording art as at present. It is presented in DD 5.1 and stereo. The surround sound makes telling use of the rear positioning of the youth choir as well as greatly aiding general clarity and sonic spread.

This is a remarkable achievement by all concerned and is a wonderful 50th anniversary tribute to the new cathedral, to the composition itself and to `the pity of war' as Britten himself said. I am sure that it will communicate strongly on those terms.

In summary therefore I would suggest that this is a performance and recording exactly appropriate for the current times that we live in and, as such, fully deserves to be seriously considered as a strong contender for purchase.

* Thanks to James Kreh for underlining the DTS nature of the soundtrack wrongly printed on the disc cover.

............................................

Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:

This review (and Amazon's back cover view as well) indicates that the audio is DD [Dolby Digital] 5.1. Fortunately this is incorrect. The graphics department at Arthaus erroneously copied the information on sound format from the cover art for the DVD. The great news here is that the 5.1 soundtrack is actually DTS-HD Master Audio encoded at 24-bit/48kHz, as one would hope to have with a contemporary concert recording on Blu-ray (although a few productions improve on these specs with 24-bit/96kHz encoding). By the way, the Arthaus Musik website has the correct audio information listed for this Blu-ray.
I agree fully with the reviewer's opinion that ""this is a triumph of the recording art"", but that certainly would not have been the case with lossy Dolby Digital 5.1 sound! (U.S. review)

5243179,5,B00925TBGI,"Benjamin Britten's War Requiem, one of the twentieth century's greatest choral works, was first performed in May 1962 upon the consecration of Coventry's St. Michael's Cathedral, erected next to the ruins of the medieval Cathedral destroyed in a German air raid in November 1940. Following the composer's own recording with the LSO (1963), a number of fine modern readings have been available on CD for quite some time, including Simon Rattle's performance with the CBSO (1983) and Richard Hickox' LSO production (1991). A DVD release was long overdue. Arthaus documents - in excellent audio and brilliant blu-ray HD video - the 50th anniversary performance of the work, recorded in Coventry Cathedral on 30 May 2012. Soloists Erin Wall, Mark Padmore and Hanno Mller-Brachmann join the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, Chorus and Youth Chorus under the direction of the eminently talented young Latvian conductor Andris Nelsons. The backdrop of gaunt ruins and the severe setting eloquently underline the Requiem's passionate plea against warfare and for peace on earth - and perhaps the fact that humanity is still anything but at peace today.

The War Requiem is constructed in two huge concentric circles. Embedded in the Latin text of the liturgy for the dead are nine poems by Wilfred Owen (1893-1918), British soldier and poet, who was killed shortly before the end of World War I. The poems vividly portray the horrors of war and are sung by the tenor and baritone soloists (accompanied by a smaller chamber group), while the soprano soloist, either alone or with the choir, intones parts of the liturgy. The youth chorus, strategically placed at the Cathedral's opposite end, is heard only three times: in relatively tranquil and peaceful parts. Britten's score is moderately ""modern"", never atonal, characterized by sharp rhythmic accents, fluctuating harmonies, brief melodic passages and ever-present immense energy. Brass and percussion are often prominent in their portrayal of conflict, brutality and grief. From the initial disquieting chords of the ""Requiem aeternam"" through the cataclysmic ""Dies irae"", the militant ""Offertorium"", the enigmatic ""Sanctus"" and ""Benedictus"" to the final ""Libera me"" with the quietly consoling ""In paradisum deducant"", this is an incredibly disturbing and equally moving work. Highly recommended to those not quite familiar with it: the journey of repeated listening will be rewarding.

The soloists, choristers and, to a lesser extent, the orchestra musicians are quite challenged by this score and its great demands. In the present recording, all participants excel to the highest standards. The soloists, visibly involved in their parts, shine out consistently, as do the members of the choirs, and the CBSO plays like a world-class ensemble. Andris Nelsons - who frequently consults the score - does a superb job in conveying every detail and nuance as well as the Requiem's spirit as a monumental whole. The profound silence following the performance speaks for itself. This is a keeper.",1350259200,4,3046,5.370292887029288
5243180,5,B00925TBGI,"On 14 November 1940, just as the Battle of Britain was beginning, the Luftwaffe destroyed the 15th century St Michael's Cathedral in Coventry. At the consecration of the new cathedral on 30 May 1962, Benjamin Britten conducted an ensemble of four hundred players and singers creating his WAR REQUIEM, combining the Latin texts of the Requiem Mass interspersed with English texts by poet Wilfred Owen, who fell at the end of the First World War. Two soloists (Heather Harper and Peter Pears) were from Britain and one (Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau) from Germany. Harper was standing in for Galina Vishnevskaya, who had been denied an exit visa by Soviet authorities.
There have been many fine recordings of WAR REQUIEM, including first of all Britten's own recording made in January of 1963 with Vishnevskaya taking her rightful place with the rest of the original cast. On 27 July 1963 Erich Leinsdorf conducted his Boston forces at Tanglewood in the American premiere, telecast on WGBH and released on an archival DVD by VAI. A magnificent video resulted from John Eliot Gardiner's 23 August 1992 performance at the Marienkirche in Lbeck, fifty years after its destruction by the RAF. The SACD catalog now lists fully six releases--by Masur (2005), Rilling (2007), Ozawa (2009), van Zweden (2011), Noseda (2011) and notably the late Richard Hickox's 1991 recording with Heather Harper reprising her role from the premiere.
Blu-ray technology has appeared just in time to capture the fiftieth-anniversary performance of the WAR REQUIEM, recorded in the new Coventry Cathedral itself on 30 May 2012. The ever-animated Andris Nelsons is a tad more subdued than usual as he conducts the CBSO, CBSO Chorus, CBSO Youth Chorus, Erin Wall, Mark Padmore and Hanno Mller-Brachmann (one German soloist--no Russian invited this time). The tastefully appointed interior of the new cathedral contrasts starkly with the walls of the old one, visible through the magnificent windows behind the adult choir. They provide the same constant commentary that they did on the occasion of the work's premiere, as as they have for the half century since.
The irony of the Sacrifice of Abraham movement is more gripping than ever in this performance. When the angel appears to rescue Isaac from his father's knife, Britten's text suddenly diverges and the knife unbiblically plunges into the boy, ""and half the seed of Europe, one-by-one,"" which echoes as a refrain for the next few minutes--""half the seed of Europe"" and ""one-by-one."" How many poets, teachers, scientists, musicians, biblical scholars, craftsmen, good solid men and women of every nationality--and of some nationalities disproportionately more than others--are embraced by the phrase ""half the seed of Europe,"" yet to be considered not just in the aggregate, but ""one-by-one,"" each one of them an irreparable loss to the whole human race. Is it any surprise that mediocrity has largely reigned since in both East and West, when so much talent and backbone was extinguished in this inhuman, apocalyptic bloodletting. America lost one Kennedy brother in battle, and nearly President Kennedy himself. Joseph Ratzinger was apprehended AWOL at the end of the war but not shot by the German officer whose right it was to do so. How many other leaders who might have led during the second half of the Twentieth Century simply disappeared, so that we know only the void left as other, less capable persons have risen to take their places.
As Pope John Paul II, who lost many friends, both Polish and Jewish, infallibly said, ""War is a lie."" WAR REQUIEM is a great work of art, which stares the lie directly in the face and speaks truth into the heart of it. There is a hopeful irony in the title, which proposes this work not just as a REQUIEM FOR VICTIMS OF WAR but as a REQUIEM FOR WAR ITSELF. The transcendent meaning of WAR REQUIEM becomes transparent in this blu-ray, which no collector should go without.",1349740800,9,3942,5.056835637480798

If we truly recognize the brilliance of the composer then we should follow the composer's instructions for the performance of the piece. Several other reviewers on these pages have also noted that Britten's composition of the ""War Requiem"" called for a Boys Chorus. This specificity was two fold;  for the symbolism of boys in war, this is a War Requiem after all, and for the distinct sound that the composer wanted to achieve. We are not arguing the quality of sound here, we are arguing the accuracy of the sound to the scoring. Interested listeners may refer to the definitive recording of the War Requiem conducted by Britten himself, he picked the performers and the soloists and it was produced by the respected Decca visionary John R.

8534606,5,B00925TBGI,"This recording with the same orchestra as Simon Rattle's recording in 1983 can be compared to the latter and it is easy to say the same thing and just add a few remarks on the originality or originalities of this recording. But let's start with these originalities.

The first one is the place and the medium. The place is the Coventry Cathedral and with the video medium we have a full sight of the old ruins beyond the new cathedral since the choir is ending on a glass wall through which we can see these ruins. This is impressive especially since dusk is coming down little by little. It is also very important since this cathedral was also the locale of the first performance of the requiem under the conducting of Benjamin Britten himself.

The second originality is that the boy chorus has been replaced by a ""youth"" chorus which is essentially, as far as we can see girls. In the name of politically correct actions this performing and recording takes away from the original work an essential element: the symbolical value of the boys for this requiem since the soldiers of WW1 are called boys by the poet, and for the composer who had a special attachment to boys in many of his musical works. Does it bring anything? From my point of view no. It does not change the pitch of the singing, but it gets away from the music two elements: the child-like immaturity of a boy chorus and the male harmonics of these boys. A boy chorus does not have the same sound as a girl chorus, maybe the same pitch but not the same color.

In this rendering the soprano seems to be slightly too ""powerful"" and I mean her voice sounds slightly forced to dominate the chorus and the orchestra. In the previous recording the soprano was a lot lighter and yet quite able to sing over the chorus and the orchestra, which gave her more flexibility.

Do these elements change the value of the musical and poetical discourse? Certainly not at least not basically. When the grapes are too green we can always find some compensation in a couple of plums even if you could make cats bark.

In spite of what some may say, this requiem is a profoundly religious work of music and the fact that the traditional Latin text is vastly interspersed with poems by Wilfred Owen does not take the religious nature of the requiem away. In fact it even widens it by making the requiem less liturgical and more reflective, spiritual and universal.

The first element is that these poems bring into the requiem a deep reflection on the nature of the First World War, its deeply inhuman nature that made it treat men as ""cattle"" worthy of a human sacrifice multiplied into millions for the sake of nothing at all except maybe some private ambitions. And yet these poems are looking at the horror of this war from the inner point of view of the soldier who fought and died there, from his post mortem point of view as if the poem was bringing back to life the men it evokes. This gives to the requiem a dimension it generally does not have. It is not the audience who is begging god for peace and quiet for the dead but it is the dead themselves who are demanding this peace and quiet in death that means respect and recollection from the people who are entering this evocation of the dead soldiers, far more than begging for it.

The music is sort of divided into two registers. The Latin sections are sung by the chorus and the boys accompanied by the big symphonic orchestra and the organ. It is within this big rendering that the soprano intervenes contrasting with the full orchestra and the two choruses. She has to sing out because the main chorus is more or less merged into the music. The boy chorus is different because for Benjamin Britten there is an obvious symbolism in the boys themselves because their male voices are the voices of the children that were sent to fight in this WW1. These boys are also symbolical in the whole work of Benjamin Britten who often had boys in his stories and operas. The second register is the poems themselves sung by the tenor and the baritone with a smaller orchestra that could be considered as a chamber orchestra. The tenor and the baritone can easily sing over the music and evenat one time a capella.

From the very start you have a tremendous beauty created by the sounds of ""bells"" in the music, bells that are tolling of course but their sound is light, high-pitched and in a way not tolling for death but tolling for life. They are like the call from ahigh, from heaven, from god to the dead men to hurry and come where they deserve to be. On the other hand the main instrumental music is somber and dark, deep and at times lugubrious.

But the music emphasizes the beauty of the poems based on strange metaphors and very resonant alliterations or rhymes. To make ""bells"" and ""shells"" rhyme is very powerful since the bells as I have said are the call of god and the shells are the call of death. And that is such a merging of the positive and negative sides of things that is the dominant trait of this poetry. When he speaks of the falling night in the trenches and says ""each slow dusk [is] a drawing-down of blinds"" we have that soft image that evokes going to sleep, resting in the comfort and warmth of a bed and a bedroom on one hand and the death that eventually and inescapably will come in these trenches sooner or later. In the same way the dead ""boys . . . by the river-side"" are ""mothered by sleep"" and this sleep is the sleep of death. Death becomes the mother that takes care of the dead after death, as opposed to the male Death that is reaping the battle fields, harvesting his crop of bodies and souls.

And that relation with ""Death"" is also ambiguous and the music amplifies that ambiguity by using the repetition of some words and the wavy advance of the notes that wax and wane in and out. We could think these soldiers, the preys of the war, could and even should hate ""Death"" and yet they don't. They play with him, they entertain with him. He is their master and clown. ""Death was never enemy of ours."" And yet at the same time, in the same poem the text says ""when each proud fighter brags He wars on Death - for Life; not men - for flags."" This text assumes a contradiction since Death is here the opponent at least, the challenger for sure, if not the enemy, and Life can only be won by defeating Death in a way or another. But this strange contradiction supports and sustains the idea that the ""proud fighter"" did not war against ""men"" and ""for flags."" The stake for these ""proud fighters"" is not the war itself but some kind of living principle that will provide them with survival if they do not die, or with eternal sleep and rest if they do die.

That's the meaning of the reference to Abraham, the last character in the Old Testament who considered human sacrifice, worse the sacrifice of his own and only Jewish son, as natural if God asked for it. The son himself might be astonished by the absence of a sacrificial animal but he does not protest when he is tied down and strapped to the sacrificial pyre. For him too dying as a ""burnt-offering"" is natural, acceptable, an honor. But we are not afraid since we know a ram is going to be provided by God, and the intervention of an angel is leading to some extremely soft and aerial, heaven-like even music that is crowned by a perfect line of iambic verse and ""iambic music"": ""Offer the Ram of Pride instead of him."" And yet this angelic beauty is blown up into pieces by the reality of the old men who govern these countries into a war that is eternal in the fact it never comes to an end. And this human sacrifice that negates the promise of Abraham that the world was to be more humane is performed ""one by one"" and the mass excuse, the excuse of mass murder is not even possible since it is performed one at a time, one after the other, one on one and one by one: the death of one, for one and by one. Death is totally individualized in the very fact that it is made anonymous by the shells and the Big Berthas of both sides.

This war is thus a sacrilege that goes against any hope and human promise or target. That leads to a totally beast-haunted vision, that of the tigress that inhabits the soldiers who run and do not ""break ranks, though nations trek from progress. . . [in] this retreating world into vain citadels that are not walled."" There is no future in this totally open world that leads to no improvement. And that's when the text becomes divine by going a capella:

""I am the enemy you killed, my friend. I know you in this dark: [short music intervention] for so you frowned yesterday through me as you jabbed and killed. [short music intervention] I parried; but my hands were loath and cold. [short music intervention]""

But this ""friendly"" meeting of the men from both sides, the killed and his killer is only possible after this very killing when the killer joins the killed in death. The final musical burden can come till the end of the requiem, ""Let us sleep now."" This conclusion is extremely ambiguous. It may be a call to the audience to let them sleep now and thus not to disturb them with more rites, rituals, symbolical sacrifices and musical executions. Let bygones be bygones. But it might be the call of these dead men to god to let them rest in peace in their death, by even forgetting them and not disturbing their sleep with vainglorious references.

This extremely ambiguous feeling I get out of the music is of course personal but also sustained by the music itself. The music does not require me to take part in this human sacrifice, nor in this human ritual recollection, nor in the haunting memory of the brutality, bestiality and backward imbecility of the human species. The music takes me beyond this in a heaven-like resting field after the battle field where all the victims can be brothers, friends and comrades in no arms at last and forever. The music that is so powerful when depicting the fighting becomes so inspiring and enlightening when depicting what comes after the war, unluckily only for the dead.

You will be probably surprised with the end since the conductor manages to keep the whole cathedral silent in complete contemplation of the beauty that has been performed and of the dense suffering that had been evoked. This is a rather rare moment of epiphany in the musical world where too often the audience tries to clap in the middle of a piece.

I have heard him on several broadcasts from Bayreuth and has been nothing short of very good on up. He is very fine here, managing the tricky placing of forces well, and having a solid grasp of the score as well as conveying feeling.  Which makes his choice of girl voices for the far-off medidative small choir all the more puzzling. Boy trebles is what one has always heard, it is what Britten used, and perhaps what the score calls for.  The innocence and etherealness of male treble voices dramatically alter the balance between mass texts and pacifist poetry.  This is a serious, in my book, fatal,flaw in this performance.  The Blu-ray looks beautiful BUT another wasted opportunity: having access to 5.1 sound, why not use it?  If there is a work that calls for it is this.... inexcusable. The soloists are fine, and it is good to hear a red-blooded tenor sing the part, not one afflicted by the constipated Pears sound. Something better should come along.  I am sorry I wasted my money on this, though in all fairness to conductor and musicians involved, their performance is quite fine, though some significant choices and inexplicable omissions reduce its worth. Due to musical and production choices made it really falls far short of the care the music warranted on such anniversary occasion. The Blu-ray and dvd also call for a short documentary or feature showing before/after of the cathedral, indeed to offer historical context to what is, after all, an anniversary performance. We get nothing. It is truly a Blu-ray of wasted opportunities.",1402876800,8,1680,4.9361702127659575

For some reason, most concert videos default to 2.0 and you must change to surround for each playing, while most movies default to surround. To concert video producers: This is extremely irritating. PLEASE change it!",1388016000,2,294,5.276595744680851
8534609,3,B00925TBGI,"I heard this performed at the National Cathedral in Washington, DC -- and it was the most mesmerizing concert I'd ever heard.  They had a boy's choir in the balcony (performing the Angels part).  What I missed the most in this recording was the lyrics.  I know it's sung in English, Latin and German.  Knowing the libretto would've made this a 5 star rating.",1387065600,,358,4.546875
