7854040,5,6303867952,"I found out this movie has an alternate ending. Without giving away who does what -- my dvd has an ending with the killer falling out a window. The alternate ending has ""someone"" shooting the killer. I'd like to find the video with the ""shooting"" ending. Does anyone know what company released that ending and how to get a copy?",1297382400,2,328,4.483333333333333
7854041,4,6303867952,"I have this movie on VHS and it it one of my favorite Linda Hamilton movies. James Belushi compliments her well in this steamy detective type noir film. Without a doubt her sexiest role ever. Linda Hamilton shows us she is a very versatile actress. Not to spoil the movie though, someone is going around killing people and it is up to Belushi's character, who is a retired police officer turned PI, to find out who it is. This one is worth watching if you can find it. Go Linda, Go.",1275696000,6,482,4.3076923076923075
7854042,3,6303867952,"This was a very interesting film. It combined a split-personality theme with a smooth detective thriller. It wasn't really hard to figure out the mystery surrounding the plot, but it was very entertaining to watch.",1205798400,7,214,5.142857142857143
