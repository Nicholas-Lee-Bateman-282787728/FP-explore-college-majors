8730209,5,B014CJ3YV6,Got excited. My movie is in this compilation :) indie film shot in 2005 and released in 2007. For today's standard it's on but it was a great film back then :),1480118400,,159,4.0
8730210,1,B014CJ3YV6,"Misleading title!! Looking at the cover, my first thought was it was a near complete collection of Stephen Seagal movies, right? No! Only one movie in this collection, RUSLAN, even has him in it. The rest are all B, or made for tv movies that you probably never heard of. Thankfully, I picked this movie up out of the $5.00 bin at a truckstop, and used free points for that so I didn't waste any money on it.",1468108800,3,408,4.243589743589744
