607999,4,6303209963,"A retired bank clerk retells his life story of how he reached his goal of riches for a stranger in a bar in Rio de Janeiro.  When he was bank clerk he meticulously oversaw the banks gold bar production and transportation.  Eventually, he intended to steal this gold whenever an opportunity arose.  One day a man moved into the same building in which he lived and the man's profession seemed to fit into the bank clerks dubious plan.  In addition, he traps two accomplices for the plan and they put the plan into action.  However, something seems fishy as the story unfolds.  The Lavender Hill Mob is a well performed dark comedy about the theft of a hefty sum in gold that brings the audience to ponder the film in retrospect.",1036627200,,726,4.5038167938931295
608000,4,6303209963,"Like most people, I am most familiar with Alec Guinness in his role as Obi-Wan Kenobi in Star Wars.  Of course, by the time he made that movie, he had been an acclaimed actor for a while.  The Lavender Hill Mob is one of the reasons for that acclaim.
Guinness stars as Henry Holland, a bank clerk who has reached middle-age with little to show for it: he's been stuck in the same job forever and lives a quiet, lonely life in a boarding house.  Holland is also a dreamer, with a goal of stealing all the gold he counts every day and retire quietly abroad.  When opportunity knocks, he answers and forms a small criminal gang to execute his scheme.
It's a brilliant scheme, and of course, things go wrong.  Chance events and Holland's cautious nature creates trouble.  It makes for a nice caper flick, if not quite the same caliber as director Chricton's much later movie, A Fish Called Wanda.  Yet this is a pleasant diversion (look for a young Audrey Hepburn in a cameo) and there are certainly worse ways to spend an hour-and-a-half.",1032912000,2,1035,4.502673796791444
608001,4,6303209963,"I'm usually not a fan of movies featuring bumbling innocents trying to do right, brought down by an endless series of accidents and mistakes.  The futility of the whole exercise frustrates me, and I can't find any room for humour in the whole endeavor.  ""The Lavender Hill Mob"" nearly falls into this trap, but thankfully doesn't.  The reason it doesn't -- and it's a reason I can't go into without ruining the wonderful surprise ending -- preserves the comedy of this delightful little heist movie.
It's a very subdued comedy.  The word on the street led me to believe that wacky hijinks and silly shenanigans would be the order of the day.  Not true.  Actually, there's a lot of quiet dignity here.  Which makes the moments of action that much funnier.  Alec Guinness as the mob's ""boss"" Henry Holland, a 20-year vet of the straight and narrow, is a desperate man, but he always does his best to maintain control in stressful situations.  He screws up his face, peers (with glorious wide eyes) knowingly from behind his glasses, and does his best to understand and analyze the predicaments he finds himself in.  When he's successful in that endeavor, the proceedings are funny.  But when he isn't... well... they're that much funnier.  Stanley Holloway plays his cohort, Pendlebury, a disgruntled manufacturer of cheap souvenirs.  He's a less menacing, almost innocent Sydney Greenstreet-type, who gets roped into a situation that appears foolproof.  Too bad these men aren't fools; they'd have gotten away scott free.  It's their intellect that does them in.  They're joined by a couple of charismatic career criminals, who may dress the part but seem more at home sipping tea than casing joints.  The scene where the four men meet, while simultaneously trying to rob a payroll safe, is a wonderful moment of manners in the face of criminal activity.  A joy to watch.
The giggly English schoolgirl scene (a classic) is creepy and disturbing.  It's hilarious how a group made up of innocents can be turned menacing in a certain context.  Combine the danger of the heights (they're at the top of the Eiffel Tower) with their high pitched giggling, and their tragic effect on the plot, and the girls turn into a dangerous phenomenon.  It's quite ludicrous, and very funny.  This is followed by a wonderfully surreal chase scene, in which Holland and Pendlebury chase them down via a spiraling staircase.  Even though the special effects are cheap and obviously fake, it felt like a ridiculous version of Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"".  It's combination of the stuffy Englishman, the Tower spinning around them, and a wind-whipped trenchcoat tossed overboard makes for some great fun.  And the finale, a romp through a police exhibition, has a cool Keystone Cops quality to it that had me giggling with glee.
Unfortunately, at times, deteriorated audio tracks and murky, fuzzy video marred some of the action.  Wading through the thick accents would have been tough enough, but when you can't hear their voices (or at worst see their lips move), understanding these men was a trial.  Too bad, because what I did manage to hear was charming, witty, and terribly funny.",997315200,11,3158,4.943074003795067

608244,4,6303209963,"I came across this movie by accident and it turned out to be pretty good and entertaining. It stars Alec Guinness, who later became the elderly Obi-Wan Kenobi in Stars War IV - A New Hope. The Lavender Hill Mob is kind of a crime-caper-comedy and I think the two 1950s Alec Guinness movies, The Lavender Hill Mob (1951), and The Ladykillers (1955) were the precursors to the Peter Sellers Pink Panther movies of the 60s and 70s.

This film has some pretty advanced 1951 visual effects involving the Eiffel Tower, in Paris, and a spiral staircase inside the Eiffel Tower. It was pretty impressive filmmaking and screenwriting for a movie that was only shot in black and white.

The Lavender Hill Mob is fast moving and it really requires you to engage your brain to watch.  It's definitely worth seeing.",1378252800,,802,4.673758865248227

608327,5,6303209963,"THE LAVENDER HILL MOB is an extremely short film - only 71 minutes long - but within that time it is a masterpiece of economy. A classic crime caper involving a bank robbery, model Eiffel Towers, a trip to France and the (expected) unraveling of the plot (due to censorship restrictions), it is most fondly remembered for its performances.  Alec Guinness is masterful as the apparently mouse-like bamk clerk Holland, with his silver-rimmed spectacles and hunched shoulders; complemented by Stanley Holloway as Pendlebury, a timid in character as he is imposing in screen presence. Charles Crichton's direction in a gray, bomb-damaged post-war London is masterful; the film is a wonderful piece of social history.",1355443200,,712,5.245614035087719

608329,4,6303209963,"Thanks to some richly comedic performances, `The Lavender Hill Mob' remains entertaining, charming and witty 50+ years after its initial release.  The film isn't perfect, but it contains enough highlights to make it more than watchable.

The film tells the story of a quiet and reserved bank employee who surveillances the transport of gold bars for a living.  One day, out of the clear blue, he decides to try his hand at stealing the bars.  The only hitch is that he doesn't have a way of transporting it out of the country, which is the only way he could indulge in the fruits of his labor.  Then he meets a man who melts down lead and makes Eiffel Tower figurines for a living.  So, with the help from two `professional crooks', these men steal the gold and melt it down to make figurines to smuggle into Paris.  None of these men truly know what they are doing and soon all their plans begin to derail as one problem after another rears its head.

Some of the film's hijinks can feel a tad overdone, especially since the film's true colors are not as outrageous as one would expect (it is far subtler than I thought it would be) but in the end the film maintains a sharp flow and contains some signature scenes that remain memorable and effective today.  In particular is the actual heist, which is funny and exciting; and that image of Guinness with tape on his eyes and mouth is priceless.

Alec Guinness (who looks in this film to be the love child of Spencer Tracy and Peter Sellers; in other words, he looks like Geoffrey Rush) was a comedic goldmine and has delivered some of my favorite comedic performances of all time (his work in `The Horse's Mouth' is honestly one of the best EVER) and he doesn't disappoint here either.  He underscores his character's naivety marvelously, showing his ineptitude while never leaving him completely clueless, so as to discredit his miraculous undertaking.  Alec is aided by a top notch cast, especially Stanley Holloway.

The films climax is the best scene in the film, mainly because it gives that extra twist no one saw coming that just ends the film on such a high note; it's pitch perfect.  The film as a whole fumbles in a few areas, but altogether comes off pretty smooth.

Watch and enjoy.",1301875200,,2246,4.58

This one is not in their class, however,and, to me, hasn't held up as well, though it still has its moments.  Although it too stars the fantastically talented Alec Guinness, and a whole mob of famous comic Cockney actors of the time, it is a short, small movie that was made on a limited budget.  Nevertheless, in 1951 it won an Oscar for Best Writing, Story and Screenplay, by T.E. B. Clarke; and Alec Guinness received a nomination for Best Leading Actor.  In 1952, it received a BAFTA (the British equivalent of an Oscar) for Best British film of the Year.

The movie might almost be best-known today for introducing the beautiful young Audrey Hepburn, ultimately to be widely loved,in her tiny, first major film role, as Chiquita. (""My Fair Lady""; ""Breakfast At Tiffany's""). It also gave Robert Shaw (""Jaws"") and Frank Forsyth (""Carry On Cleo/Carry On Jack"") their first, unaccredited, screen parts.

Well, the film seems a little slow today, and is more likely to deliver a chuckle than a belly laugh.  But it has a neat, tight little plot, and it does shine in spots.  It was, to some degree, filmed on the dreary streets of immediate post-war London; a viewer can make out that city's famous landmarks; also see the extensive damage from the German bombing Blitz.  The movie, furthermore, boasts some fantastical, surrealistic scenes: as Holland and Pendlebury dizzily clamber down the stairs of Paris's Eiffel Tower (don't ask), Holland's hat and Pendlebury's coat float stunningly free.  In the middle of London, a Welsh bobby, grabbing a lift on the police car's running board, sings lustily along, in a fine baritone, to ""Old MacDonald Had a Farm,"" which is inexplicably blasting out of the radio of the police car Holland and Pendlebury have just stolen. (Don't even think of asking).  However, unfortunately, the filmmakers were influenced by the American censorship laws of the time (to flout them would have meant sacrificing that huge, profitable market); that does somewhat moderate the fun.  Still, the film's worth seeing, before what's bound to be the big, overblown, high-budget American remake is released.",1254528000,,5249,7.239370078740158

608446,5,6303209963,"This film is one of the masterpieces of British Comedy. Alec Guinness and Stanley Holloway are an unlikely pair of ""crooks"". The inverted commas are there because neither the viewer nor the characters quite believe it themselves. The pair just want a bit of adventure and a taste of the high life. Guinness is brilliant as the timid bank clerk who despises the trust he is given because he knows he is seen by his superiors as too weak an individual to be a threat. That gives him the power to succeed in his daring plan. The catalyst is Stanley Holloway, a businessman with an eye for the main chance. However, he does not believe he can succeed until he meets Guinness, and Guinness does not believe that his little fantasy about robbing the bank can become a reality until he meets Holloway.

One day he meets another lodger who manufactures trinkets.  The wheels turn and a plot is devised to steal a truckload of gold, disguise it a cheap nick-knacks, and get it out of the country.  But not all goes quite as planned when some of the gold winds up in the wrong hands.

Retrieving the disguised gold leads to wonderful hijinks including a police chase through a police convention/exhibition.  In the end holding on to the gold is harder then getting it ever was.  A comic masterpiece that borders on slapstick.  Guinness and partner make a wonderful team as they are on the run from the police but always seem to be surrounded.  Many plot devices are so classic that they have been mimicked in countless movies and television shows.  This DVD gives you the chance to see how they got their start.

Guinness once again proves his ability as an actor as he plays the unlikely thief.  But as unlikely as he is his motivations and descent into crime are one-hundred percent believable.  Classic comedy combines with classic acting and Guinness at the top of his form to create a truly memorable film with one of the most memorable thefts in all of movie history.

Probably the most notable comparison is the frantic chase scenes at the conclusions of both. Probably the only difference between the two is that the latter is loaded with sexual situations and obscenities...but that was what the times permitted.

Alec Guinness, Stanley Holloway, Sid James, and Alfie Bass turn in bravura performances. (I especially liked the scene in which masterminds Guinness and Holloway ""meet"" their two gangmembers, James and Bass.) To me, though, the minor characters are equally enjoyable: the landlady, the old woman who loves pulp fiction, the cop who loves ""Old MacDonald Had a Farm"", and several others.

A small budget film with no today Hollywood superstars, no leading lady (Audrey Hepburn made her film debut which appeared not more than 2 minutes on screen), no explosion. And yet, the movie succeeded to tell an engaging story of 2 enthusiastic amateur thieves who kept their heads down and focused on their mission.

The film began with Alec Guinness recalling his life last year, as a 20-year bank clerk and how he plotted to steal a vast amount of gold. Stanley Holloway (who also starred as Eliza's father in My Fair Lady) and Alec Guinness made a wonderful couple. And watch out for the elegant Audrey Hepburn in the first 10 minutes of the movie.

The story unfolded nicely as Alec narrated how he formulated his plan, how he recruited partners (Stanley Holloway and 2 more) to execute his well-thought plan and how, when the plan did go wrong, the whole team improvised. The scene of their chasing after English school girls at the Eiffel Tower in Paris is particularly impressive. It is as if they were flying in the air and laughing their hearts out on a merry-go-round. I kept wondering how modern movies did not make such shots any more.

The movie has its comical moments. The two were helplessly delayed by the French customs and prevented from boarding the ship the English girls were on.  It was funny to see how they persisted in order to succeed. They were like serious school kids who was intent on completing their project by any means. Never did they think of betraying their team members.

608533,4,6303209963,"...it might have been.""  In the early to mid 50's, many studios were churning out comedies, perhaps more so in an effort to get people past those old post war blues, but few did it as well or consistently as the British Ealing Studios (in my humble opinion), helped immensely by the talents of Alec Guinness...what?!  Alec Guinness a comedic actor?  The same Alec Guinness who starred in such serious films as The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957), Lawrence of Arabia (1962), Doctor Zhivago (1965), and A Passage to India (1984)?  Yes, it seemed by the end of the 1950's, Guinness had pretty much dedicated himself to more serious parts, but not altogether as he later appeared in the fantastic comedy Murder by Death (1976), which I recommend to anybody in search of a truly good laugh.  While many consider The Lavender Hill Mob (1951) to be one of the best of the Guinness/Ealing comedies, I'm partial to one of their later films, The Ladykillers (1955), which was recently remade by the Coen brothers and featured Tom Hanks (I've haven't seen it yet, but I heard not so good things about it).  Directed by Charles Crichton (The Titfield Thunderbolt, A Fish Called Wanda), the film stars, along with Guinness, Stanley Holloway (Nicholas Nickleby, Passport to Pimlico).  Also appearing is Sid James (The 39 Steps, Upstairs and Downstairs) and Alfie Bass (The Fearless Vampire Killers, Revenge of the Pink Panther).

This comedic caper begins in a tropical setting, where we meet a man named Henry Holland (Guinness), who seems quite popular probably because of the fact he's pretty free with his money.  He thus begins to relate a tale to another man, taking us into a flashback that makes up the rest of the film and we learn Holland, prior to being a somewhat well to do philanthropist sort in South America, actually came from humble beginnings as in a previous life he was a mild mannered bank worker, responsible for regularly escorting gold shipments from the smelting facility (that's where they take the raw gold and turn it into bars), to the bank.  His coworkers and superiors look upon him as a quiet, by the book sort with no ambition, imagination, or initiative, as `his one and only virtue is honesty'.  And that's exactly the way Holland likes it...especially since he aspires to one day steal one of shipments of gold and live out his days well beyond his current means.  The only problem is, once stolen, gold bars are extremely difficult to transfer into cash...but a solution soon presents itself in the form of a new tenant to the boarding house Holland resides, one named Alfred Pendlebury (Holloway)...the name of the tenant, not the boarding house...Mr. Pendlebury just happens to operate a modest die casting business, one whose specialty is producing paperweights, one perfectly suited for Holland's needs.  Soon the die is cast (so to speak), and the pieces are in place, but, as everyone knows, even the best-laid plans are subject to disaster once in the implementation stage as the human element is always the most unpredictable.

As I said before, of all the Guinness/Ealing comedies, I prefer The Ladykillers most of all, probably due to the darker tone of the material and more outlandish nature of the characters, but that's not to say this film isn't of superior quality, as it won an Academy Award for best writing, story and screenplay, and earned Guinness his first nomination (Gary Cooper won for his role in High Noon).  One of things I like most about these older comedies is they don't pander to the lowest common denominator in terms of comedic content, but rather speak to the audience with respect, maintaining a consistent level of intelligence not so often seen nowadays...but that's not to say this couldn't be enjoyed by anyone.  I had originally seen this film quite a number of years ago, and appreciated it for the more visual elements as opposed to last night when I enjoyed the more subtle aspects due to a general understanding one usually gains with maturity.  Regardless, this is one of those films where everything works well together to bring about a wonderful story.  The direction is exceptionally strong and wastes none of the films lean 81 minutes running time.  Guinness is about as good as you'll ever see him, fostering a belief that he is, now and forever, the meticulous, level-headed, slightly devious character of Henry Holland (at least until his next film), but is certainly assisted (nearly upstaged) by his costar Holloway, the romantic character, yearning to express his artistic nature, stifled by the drudgery of actually having to earn a living through the mass production of tourist souvenirs.  There are any number of wonderful scenes and sequences presented throughout the film, but two come to my mind as being my favorites.  One features Mr. Pendlebury moving into the boarding house where Holland lives, and Holland learning of Pendlebury's profession which sets in motion him gingerly broaching the possibility of utilizing Pendlebury's die casting business as a means to process the stolen booty.  Holland and Pendlebury, both eventually on the same page, begin almost convincing each other and themselves of the very real possibility that it can be done...the other is the scene where Holland and Pendlebury go about enlisting a couple of extra, but necessary, members for the gang, as the gold shipment is too much for the two of them to handle themselves.  It's not like you can put an ad out in the paper for such a thing, so they utilize a very unique method to contact prospective applicants.  And there's a bonus!  If you love classic movies, you'll be in for a treat...watch for the appearance of a minor character, played by a soon to be legendary actress, about three or four minutes into the film...yes, that's who you think it is...but don't blink, or you'll miss it...

Anchor Bay Entertainment provides a very clean and clear full screen (original aspect ratio) picture on this DVD, with a decent Dolby Digital mono audio.  Special features include an original theatrical trailer, and an extensive Alec Guinness biography and liner notes.  By the way, I heard there is a remake of this film in the works, scheduled to be released in 2006...I guess time will tell if it's any good or not, but the way I see it, what's the point?  I hardly see how they could improve upon the original...

By the way, there is, as I write this, an Alec Guinness DVD set offered by Anchor Bay Entertainment featuring five of his early comedies, including this one, offered at a price that is cheaper than purchasing these DVDs separately, so if you're interested, it might be worth looking into...",1115769600,9,6690,4.86784140969163
608534,3,6303209963,"I know this film has rave reviews from a lot of connossieurs of this era and this genre (that is, a British-made comedy from the early '50s), and it's pleasant enough but just isn't for everybody.  Which is fine, no movie is.

As a Yank cretin who grew up in the '70s, however, who mainly knows Guinness from his Obi Wan Kenobe turn in ""Star Wars,"" it's mainly a pleasure to see just how talented an actor the old fella really was.  Subtle and nuanced, although he can't quite seem to be consistent with just how nasal the character's voice should be from line to line, here Guinness plays ""Dutch"" Holland, a man whose job involves checking the melting of British gold into bricks and seeing that they are transported properly to their Very Safe Place.

Problem is, for 19 years Dutch has been living a very quiet and unsuspicious life but wishing he could find a way to smuggle some of that gold out of the country...so quiet and unsuspicious that he won't even let on that he wants to be known as ""Dutch.""  Then Mr. Holland meets an exporter of Eiffel Tower replicas who agrees to make them from stolen gold from now on...and the fun ensues.  (This is in stark contrast to the official Amazon review, wherein Dutch suddenly decides to do this with an old friend, as opposed to the actual plot where he fulfills an old fantasy with a new friend.  Do these people actually WATCH these movies before reviewing them?)

Anyway, Sir Alec is a joy to watch, and there is a very compelling scene wherein he and his exporter friend race down the Eiffel Tower on foot.  It really becomes a bit of a madcap farce, and certainly won't lose your attention.

In the end, however, in spite of nice plot twists and a few laughs along the way, it really amounts to no more than a mildly pleasant diversion...unless you really REALLY like those British sitcoms seen so often on PBS.  If that describes you, this would definitely be your cup of tea, so to speak.  If, however, the only British comedy you've ever really REALLY liked on PBS involved the word Python in the title, you may wish to pass.",1108252800,3,2083,4.467018469656992

A possible detriment is the Cockney accents of alot of the characters is rather thick and you have to strain to figure out what they're saying.

608537,5,6303209963,"This marvlous film unites the talents of two of the greatest English comedians of the forties and fifties (Guinness more or less ceased doing comedy in the sixties on):  Alec Guinness and Stanley Holloway.  Guinness is, of course, one of the most famous and distinguished actors of the past half century, but Holloway is primarily known in the United States for a single role, though by no means his most representative, that of Alfred P. Doolittle in the film version of MY FAIR LADY.  In this film we see him at his more typical, more akin to his performances in movies like PASSPORT TO PIMPLICO and BRIEF ENCOUNTER.  Guinness, who was so versatile that he had no particular role that was typical of him, shines as a long suffering, faithful bank clerk of whom the old expression ""still waters run deep"" is especially true.  Behind his nonexpressive, stoic face is the soul of a thief who intends to rob the bank of a small fortune.  Holloway plays the owner of a very small company that makes tourist trinkets for souvenir shops.  They team up to form the Lavender Hill Mob (named for the address of the boarding house in which they both live).
As in so many movies, it isn't the getting there but the going there that's good.  The plot takes a definite second place to the performances of the leads.  One of my major complaints with Guinness is that the further he went in his career, the more he foresook comedy for drama.  He was a subtle and brilliant commedian who excelled in subdued performances.  Guinness could get more mileage out of a sly grin and his eyes than most actors can in their entire body.  Holloway, on the other hand, is the master of broad comedy:  exaggerated facial expressions, horrified poses, distraught reactions.  Together they balance one another out perfectly.  In scenes like their frantic and futile dash down the steps of the Eiffel Tower they are used to perfection.
Ealing Studios made a string of utterly superb comedies in the 1940s and 1950s, and this is one of my favorites.  I actually prefer this to the deeply cynical and dark KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS, and consider it on any grounds to be superior to THE LADYKILLERS (oddly marred by Guinness's inexplicable impersonation of Alastair Sim, down to false teeth, body padding, and a hair-do that mimicked Sims's--when you go that far, why not just hire Sim instead?), and an honorable companion to films such as PASSPORT TO PIMPLICO, THE MAN IN THE WHITE SUIT, and THE TITFIELD THUNDERBOLT).
Audrey Hepburn had a number of walk on roles in British films in the very early 1950s, but didn't achieve real success until her stage work brought her to the attention of Hollywood.  She is easily spotted in a bit role in this one, as the radiantly beautiful woman who stops to say hello to Guinness in the opening scene of the film.",1085616000,3,2822,4.668686868686868
608538,4,6303209963,"I do not rate this as among the great  Ealing studios  comedies and it trails behind such movies as Kind Hearts and Coronets ,The Ladykillers and The Man in the White Suit as examples of that genre. It is however ,an enjoyable and diverting piece of work ,solidly in the traditions of comedy established by the studio.
Th framing scenes depict Alec Guinness as Holland ,clearly a luminary of the expatriate English set of  Rio De Janeiro ,relating the tale of how he came to acquire his wealth and postition  .His audience is a soberly dresssed man clearly also English.
We then are taken back to the execution of a gold bullion robbbery ,masterminded by Holland ,a long serving ,meek and decorous Bank of England employee who has dreamed of robbing the vehicle containing the gold .He enlists the aid of Pemberton (Stanley Hoilloway)who owns a small souvenir making business ,and that of two small time professional criminals  -played by two British comedy stalwarts in Sid James and Aldie Bass. The robbery is executed without violence and the ingots melted down into replicas of the Eiffel Tower which Pemberton and Holland go to Paris to rescue .Alas, some find their way onto the market and the duo are forced to try buying back the models from the schoolgirls who have purchased them .
There is a lively car chase -again comedic in tone rather than an exercise in screeching rubber -before the twist ending in Rio.
This is a gently amoral comedy -the larceny perpetrated is  without violence or malice and is shown as the revenge of the timid and passed over in an age of drabness and austerity. It is a tale of the ""little man ""who rebels .In contrast to more recent caper movies these are not vicious professional criminals but opporunists who shrink from violence .It is thus a period piece and miles removed from the unappealing specimens deopicted in the modern British crime movies like those of the morally null Guy Ritchie.

608539,5,6303209963,"I recently purchased The Horse's Mouth (1958) from Amazon as well as ""The Alec Guinness Collection"" which includes The Lavender Hill Mob (1951) plus four others: Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949), The Man in the White Suit (1951), The Captain's Paradise (1953), and The Ladykillers (1955). Frankly, I was amazed how well each of the six films has held up since I first saw it.
This film was directed by Charles Crighton. Noteworthy in the first scene is a brief appearance by Audrey Hepburn, identified in the credits as ""Chiquita."" After she departs, Henry Holland (played brilliantly, as always, by Guinness) begins to recount the Lavender Hill saga to his companion. As he explains, he was a mild-mannered fellow who supervised the transportation by van of gold bullion. His boss, the armed guards who accompany him, and those who receive the shipments all respect his fastidious (albeit anal retentive) attitude toward his duties. Holland seems to have no private life except for his friendship with Alfred Pendlebury (played by Stanley Holloway) who owns a company which manufactures paperweights. For reasons which will not be revealed here, Holland and Pendlebury decide to steal a shipment worth (in 1951) several million pounds. They realize they will need help so they recruit two smalltime Cockney crooks, Lackery Wood (Sidney James) and Shorty Fisher (Alfie Bass), and thereby create the Lavender Hill Mob. In my opinion, how they plan and then complete the heist is far less entertaining than what happens afterward. T.E.B. Clarke received an Academy Award for his script which, paradoxically, is quite simple and yet wholly unpredictable. The acting is consistently first-rate. Also, while recently seeing this film again, I enjoyed the exterior shots London and Paris more than 50 years ago. This comedy is indeed a ""classic.""",1056758400,3,1839,5.1952861952861955

608541,4,6303209963,"""The Lavender Hill Mob"" is the brainchild of Henry Holland (Alec Guinness), a long suffering bank employee who is responsible for sitting in the back of the armored car and keep a watchful eye over the transportation of England's gold bullion.  Over twenty years of faithful surface he suddenly comes up with a plan to steal a million pounds worth of gold (actually, the plan used in the movie was put together by employees of the Bank of England, who responded with amazing enthusiasm to a request for suggestions by Ealing Studio).  Holland enlists Pendlebury (Stanley Holloway), a manufacturer of cheap souvenirs, for his plan and the gang is fleshed out with a couple of ""professional"" criminals, Lackery (Sidney James) and Shorty (Alfie Bass).  All four of the mob members are distinctive characters and despite their shortcomings and their intention fo commit robbery, they are clearly not bad blokes.
The caper is ingeniously simple and is pulled off with a couple of significant hitches.  Then there are several major complications in trying to get away with the crime that has all of England talking, but that is the fun.  Holland has our good will, mainly because of Guinness' winning performance; he received his first Oscar nomination for the role, winning five years later for ""The Bridge on the Rive Kwai.""  Holland's impish smile as he finally seizes his opportunity for the life of which he has long dreamt is captivating.  But the chief charm here is the script by T.E.B. Clarke, which did win the Oscar for Best Writing, Story and Screenplay.  Originally, Clarke was working on the script as a straight drama but became intrigued by the comic possibilities of the story.  There is one major extended chase scene in the film but what is more memorable is the sight of Holland and Pendlebury racing down the circular steps of the Eiffel Tower.
This is not so much a great comedy as it is a solid one in the English tradition that flourished after the Second World War.  The story is so well constructed that the film only runs 78-minutes and the humor comes out of the characters and the situations.  Final Note: I am glad to know that when I thought the young woman in the opening scene of this film looked like Audrey Heburn that it was indeed the future film superstar.  I just never thought of her as being a bit player.",1044057600,4,2340,4.736453201970443

As always, Sir Alec shines in the lead role, with fine support from Stanley Holloway and Sidney James, years before his ""Carry On"" fame. The humour here is dark and subtle, and of course there is a delightful ""twist"" at the end, an Ealing trade mark.
