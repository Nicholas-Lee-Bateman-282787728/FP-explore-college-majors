  Its basically an average suspense/thriller  film with twist & turns that lead away from what becomes a somewhat surprise ending. On that level I gave it a 4 Star.

Yes, it will play on American Blu Ray players. I have a Sony and waiting for the title to begin, hoping that the product info was correct! Again it is!

So, I'll leave it there for you to decide for yourself, but if you like me dig French movies with the actors that began careers in the 1950's, you'll be Ok!",1522022400,,777,4.153333333333333
