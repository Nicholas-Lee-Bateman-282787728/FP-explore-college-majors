8328488,5,B001NZF1GE,I was in the pilot group that evaluated the Fitheads system. I never needed to exercise but after I turned 30 I realized that it was time. This product helped me identify the reason I wanted to be more fit. It also taught me several tools to use when I need to get motivated. It was easy to watch on my TV and really got me to walk regularly. It is different than anything else I have seen in that it focuses on changing your mindset about exercise.,1231977600,,449,4.113636363636363
