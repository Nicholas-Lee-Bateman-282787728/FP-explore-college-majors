8023153,2,B00027C0OA,"White Zombie, 1932 film

The drumbeat and song tell of a foreign location. The people bury a dead body in the road to prevent it from being dug up and turned into a zombie. Who are those strange people in the night? Are they the living dead, zombies who work at night? Mr. Beaumont offered them a job. Is there something strange going on? There are ominous noises in the sugar works. ""I looked into her eyes."" ""No, not that!"" ""There is no other way."" What about that lone flower? What will that marriage bring? What about that voodoo doll? What a horrible fate! As the story unfolds we learn more about the characters. Will they rob a grave?

""Have you got a match?"" Can a drug cause a lethargic coma, like death? Article 49 of French Law says that it is attempted murder. Is that Madeline playing a piano? Can she be brought back to life? Was something put into his drink? Will Silver feed a vulture? [The film shows the technical effects of that time.] The story runs on. What will Madeline do with that knife? Will the villain's power be overcome by a holy man? Will the creatures self-destruct? Was it all a dream? ""Have you got a match?""

The horror of this film now seems dated and is now comically funny. Were those zombies working at night a symbol for Hollywood or exploited workers?",1494374400,,1292,4.420168067226891

8023155,5,B00027C0OA,"Passport Video presents ""The Bela Lugosi Box - 15 Frightful Films"" (1942) --- (Dolby digitally remastered) --- Bla Lugosi was the stage name of actor Bla Ferenc Dezs' Blask (October 20, 1882 - August 16, 1956) --- Lugosi was born in Lugos, Hungary, at the time part of Austria-Hungary (now Lugoj, Romania), the youngest of four children of a baker --- best known for his portrayal of ""Dracula"" in the American Broadway stage production, and subsequent film, of Bram Stoker's classic vampire story.

Late in his life, he again received star billing in movies when filmmaker Edward D. Wood, Jr., a fan of Lugosi, found him living in obscurity and near-poverty and offered him roles in his films, such as ""GLEN OR GLENDA?"" (1953) (in which his role made no more sense than the rest of the movie) and as a Dr. Frankenstein-like mad scientist in ""BRIDE OF THE MONSTER"" (1955), during post-production of the latter, Lugosi entered treatment for his addiction, and the premier of the film was ostensibly intended to help pay for his treatment expenses. The extras on an early DVD release of ""PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE"" (1959) include an impromptu interview with Lugosi upon his exit from the treatment center, which provide some rare personal insights into the man --- this was one of Lugosi's most infamous roles was released after he was dead. Ed Wood (Director) features footage of Lugosi interspersed with a double --- Wood had taken a few minutes of silent footage of Lugosi, in his Dracula cape, for a planned vampire picture but was unable to find financing for the project --- Wood later conceived of Plan 9, Wood wrote the script to incorporate the Lugosi footage and hired his wife's chiropractor to double for Lugosi in additional shots --- notice however the ""double"" is thinner than Lugosi, and covers the lower half of his face with his cape in every shot --- Leonard Maltin (Famous Film Critic) was quoted - ""Lugosi died during production, and it shows.""

Lugosi died of a heart attack on August 16, 1956 while lying in bed in his Los Angeles home. He was 73 --- Bela Lugosi was buried wearing one of the many capes from the Dracula stageplay, as per the request of his son and fifth wife, in the Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California --- Contrary to popular belief, Lugosi never requested to be buried in his famous cloak; Bela Lugosi, Jr. has confirmed on numerous occasions that he and his mother, Lillian, arrived at their decision independently.

8023156,4,B00027C0OA,"In many ways this first zombie movie is the last film in the baroque horror tradition of the silent films. This 1932 film directed by Victor Halperin was made for practically nothing even though it starred Bela Lugosi as ""Murder"" Legendre, in his first role after making a smash in ""Dracula.""  Lugosi, who apparently directed some of the retakes as well, plays the master of a different type of undead down in Haiti.
In ""White Zombie,"" Monsieur Beaumont (Robert Frazer) convinces a young couple, Madeleine Short (Madge Bellamy) and Neil Parker (John Harron) to get married on his Haitian plantation. Amazingly enough, he does this so that he can convince Madeline to run away with him. Needing help, Beaumont turns to Legendre, who runs his mill with zombie workers. Beaumont uses Legendre's zombie potion to bend Madeleine to his will, but then is dissatisfied with her soulless husk and wants her turned back. Instead, Legendre turns Beaumont into a zombie as well. Meanwhile, Neil is convinced by a local priest that maybe he is not a widow after all.
""White Zombie"" never really frightens its audience, but instead sustains a high level of downright eeriness throughout, achieving its effect by taking such simple objects as the scarf used to wrap a voodoo doll or a rose containing poison and making them important elements in Lugosi's evil machinations. This film might be a talkie, but its sensibilities are those of the silent era and since it begins the tradition of zombies in the movies that continues down to ""Night of the Living Dead"" and other light hearted fare makes it at least an interesting footnote in the history of horror films.",1087948800,,1650,4.892857142857143
