I just wanted to add that right at the end I thought this was going to suck; and then it turned out just to be depressing.  I've seen worse ghost movies, but I've never seen a horror movie that made me sad by the end of it like this one did.",1375142400,6,311,3.859375
5691761,5,B00C6F622M,"What an engaging spookological, paranormal drama. The cast is superior delivering riveting performances. The quality of the actual film is superb, so much so I must own a copy once legally released in the US. To follow the interactions of Vanessa Redgrave is certainly worth quite a bit of entertainment value. We recommend that you consider buying this terrific scary movie too.",1374105600,3,379,5.129032258064516
5691762,4,B00C6F622M,"I can't speak for the DVD, but I heartily recommend this product to all horror fans.  The producer/writer's intention was to create a Catholic horror movie that was not about the Devil.  The religion in this isn't Catholicism per se, but whatever.  It's a great film with an amazing set that was really a house in Toronto and a sense of claustrophobia that works marvelously to increase tension.  Great film, you should see it.",1370131200,8,427,4.72972972972973
5691763,1,B00C6F622M,"I haven't watched the movie yet, this is just complaints about the audio quality. The audio is quite bass heavy which makes the voiceover sound very muddy and indistinct, I had to turn the bass way down and turn on the subtitles so I could make out anything. We have a Bose entertainment system hooked up to our PC downstairs and that's where I started the film, but I'll be finishing it upstairs with Fire TV. The bass won't be so rumbly, but I imagine I'll still need the subtitles because again, very bassy, muddy audio.",1494892800,,523,4.458333333333333
5691764,5,B00C6F622M,"This movie is about a stupid Idiot Boy who believed he was suffering and created a world of suffering around him, His up bringing, education etc nothing could break the spell of suffering which he cast upon himself. This is also about a mom who till her last breath and even beyond yearned for his stupid idiot son to return to her, which ofcourse he did in a way .. but the idiot kept smoking and putting out the cigarettes on Holy statues, which is really too much.

I am sure, this movie addresses and burning social problem : Caring for the Aged People as well as it address a the question : What is Faith and Belief. This movie is a reflection of ""modern"" people, who are extremely disillusioned, Idiot to their very core, and in the name of "" Science"" although they don't understand (let alone believe) what is the meaning of science actually, refuse to accept anything which is written in the ""Books"" and cannot be proved.

5691770,1,B00C6F622M,"This was seriously one of the worst movies I've ever sat through.  I searched through Amazon for 30 minutes trying to find a decent horror/thriller movie to watch on a cold and rainy Sunday morning.  I ran across this one, it was only $4, and the trailer made it look semi-interesting.

Do.  Not.  Purchase.  This.  Movie.

Seriously, folks.  Awful.  I spent the whole time waiting for something to happen.  Just waiting.  There were countless screen pans where you'd think something suspenseful was about to unfold and the movie was going to actually start.  But, nope.

The most unexpected thing of the movie was when the credits rolled.  I couldn't believe it!  What was this movie supposed to be?!?

Take heed and keep searching.  If you're that interested in the movie, just wait.  It'll be in the annals of the free Netflix horror options in no time.",1482105600,2,856,4.739726027397261

5691798,1,B00C6F622M,"SPOILERS! Kind of?

It's like a film student watched Ti West's ""The House of the Devil"", wanted to copy it (mostly the tension) and essentially mirrored it by playing mad libs with the variables. (Girl in devil worshippers house is here traded for dude in his mom's cult-y house.) And they just ran it into the ground.

No suspense, boring, and pretending to have theme. I'm sure Vanessa Redgrave was stoked to collect a voice over paycheck for doing next to nothing other than providing the credits with a ""name"".

If you like a guy turning pages for 45 minutes and incredibly forced imagery to remind you that you're watching a movie about a cult house, then this is up your alley. I particularly love the cutaways to delightfully hand stitched, framed art reminding you that people in cults believe weird things.

If you like characters in conversation then this is not for you. If you like actors pretending to react to the voice over that's been written on the page, then this is absolutely for you!

If you like film's with plot and interesting stories then this is not for you. If you like your films to sort of just begin, wander aimlessly, and end then this is so for you!

But seriously, all sarcasm aside it's not very good. But what do I know? I'm just a guy who likes movies that feel like movies, and not like eighty minutes of film pretending to be a movie.",1454112000,4,1372,4.48995983935743

Vanessa Redgrave's script was beautiful and her alto, silken voice was a perfect fit.  Never underestimate the power of true love.  I've never seen such a touching horror movie, and this was so well done.  I wouldn't mind watching it again to catch the nuances; the little things the director does in the backgrounds of the sets, of the scenes, the dialogue, the editing...these things make the difference between a horror flick and cinematic literature.  I think this one has what it takes.",1452384000,2,619,4.747663551401869

My guess here is that the message is primarily:  what are any of us without faith in something?  No happy ending here.  Just a note:  Vanessa Redgrave's distinctive, sad, beautiful English voice provides the narration but she does not appear in the movie.  I thought at first that the beautiful house the movie takes place in was so unbelievably overrun with knickknacks it rendered it ugly, but there is a good reason why it is the way it is and this little puzzle piece is fitted in rather quickly.",1451606400,5,676,4.677966101694915

5691817,5,B00C6F622M,"This one's a must-see, an honor I don't grant lightly. The old canard about the setting being a character in and of itselfit really works here. Considering that 80% of the movie is poor Aaron Poole as Leon Leigh, Surveillance Expert, stumbling and bumbling around in the dark of the house he just inherited from his mother Rosalind (Vanessa Redgrave, present mainly through voice over). There's a lot creepy here. It's a creepy movie, pure creepy. When you think about it, creepy is one of the subtlest forms of fear, much more difficult to achieve than scary, frightening, dreadful or horrific. There are weird old saying hanging on the wall in Rosalind's needlework: If a knife falls, a man will arrive, if a spoon falls a woman will arrive, if a fork falls it will be neither a man nor a woman. And klutzy Aaron of course drops a fork and who shows up at the door? Well, we never see his/her face, but the voice (Julian Richings) is weirdly abstracted, and the visitor talks of a strange beast loose in the neighborhood, a beast which later comes and licks Leon's face as he sleeps. There's the weird voice that leads Leon toward a transcendental experience where the whole house fills with soothing white light, and then there's Aaron's friend (girlfriend?) Anna (Charlotte Sullivan) who leads Aaron through this relaxing visualization exercise that requires him to close his eyes and be still as we can tell that there is something huge and hulking stomping down the hallway toward him, at last casting a massive shadow across his face. And when she tells him to open his eyes? Well, you'll just have to watch to find out!",1405468800,2,1627,4.6923076923076925

5691820,2,B00C6F622M,"Unfortunately, although the setting was creepy and the acting decent, the film itself fell flat in every other respect. In a horror pic, I do prefer mood over action, slow boiled tension over cheap scares, but here there was absolutely no tension whatsoever. There was nothing really at stake. I also enjoy carefully planned ambiguity, and seeing that word along with 'conceptual' in so many reviews below, I was hopeful. But the concept is poorly thrown together, very loose and without lasting impact, and there is no real ambiguity present. Questions, yes, but not ambiguity (there's a big difference between the two). In general, it felt like dime store philosophy trying to pass itself off as 'deep'. Trust me, there's no actual depth here.

The skeleton of the plot sounds intriguing: a nonbeliever, who was brought up in a torturously religious household, returns to his dead mother's icon-cluttered home. It's supposed to be about loneliness, about regret, about the distance between family members, and about whether faith is a waste of time or is grounded in the real. Instead, we get some vague clamor about a cult, some CGI creature that looks like a cross between a werewolf and Golem, and a sullen man pacing a big house making stupid decisions at every turn.

If you like your paranormal drama (it's not a horror film) to pretend to be about something without actually succeeding, then you might enjoy this film more than I did. At least it's not a gore or jump-scare based movie. But without the gore and scares (and tension and plot and honest character development), I'm not sure what would be left to find satisfying.",1402876800,,1636,4.881294964028777

5691825,2,B00C6F622M,"I had high hopes for this film which I ended up seeing through Amazon Instant Video.  The director's first short film, THE EYES OF EDWARD JAMES, is hands down, one of the best and original short films I have ever seen.

One hesitation I had with the movie was that he went on to make another short entitled THE DEMONOLOGY OF DESIRE that threw out plot in favor of style.  I was worried that LWATORL would be more like that film than EYES, and sadly I was right.

The film is about a man who inherits a house after his mother passes away.  It's a great concept especially as he finds out a lot about his mother through various scribblings and junk in the house that belongs to her.  There is a ton of voice over as the diaries are ready out.  And that's really all there is to the story - and it sadly exposes the terrible writing behind the narration. A rather cool CGI monsters crops up near the end - which also mirrors DEMONOLOGY which also features a random CGI monster thrown in for what seems to be no reason relevant to the plot.  However I accept that maybe I am just missing something.  It could just be that this is not my kind of film.  But I will say this - I like slow burning horror films (This was TOO slow, mainly to lack of plot), I love creepy horror (This had no atmosphere) and I love a good ending - and to the filmmaker's credit the ending had a nice twist.  But it did not justify the 80 or so minutes that went before it.

On a positive note the CGI creature and the cinematography are both nicely done.  If the director is reading this, I hope he goes back to his roots and makes something like EYES.  The point of a script is to make the audience care about what happens next (As EYES did so brilliantly) not make them check their watches.

I apologize if this is a little harsh.  For me TLWATORL was painful to sit through and I have to be honest.",1390608000,,1874,4.149584487534626

5691829,4,B00C6F622M,"This movie is as my review title says. It's strange. It's creepy. You can't really tell if everything that happens in the film is ""real"" or just in the main character's head. A young man goes to his mother's house after her death. He hasn't been there for a long time because of their estrangement. He starts to experience odd things in the house. There are flashes of an odd backstory where his mother was part of this weird angel-worshipping cult. The strange stuff keeps escalating. You get the idea that the guy isn't stable as his mother's treatment of him when he was young bordered on psychological abuse. He calls his therapist/girlfriend(?) several times during the movie when the house really werids him out. The tension mounts with lots of eerie effects. We hardly ever see anyone else in the house except this troubled young man. He seems lonely and isolated. He never really comes to any conclusions about what he sees in the house while he's there. You get the idea that he's there for curiosity's sake because his mother is dead rather than actually wanting to be in the house on a more permanent basis.

5691832,4,B00C6F622M,"The Last Will and Testament of Rosalind Leigh (Rodrigo Gudio, 2012)

One of the Facebook groups to which I subscribe is a fan club for Welsh author Wayne Simmons. Every once in a while one of the moderators will pop out one of those 'what are you listening to right now? questions. A month or so ago, it was what horror film are you most looking forward to seeing? From those across the pond, the answer was close to unanimous (and close to instantaneous)The Last Will and Testament of Rosalind Leigh. I'd heard of the film before, but the only thing that had stuck in my mind was that Vanessa Redgrave starred. Last week, it showed up on Netflix Instant, and I remembered that thread, so I fired it up and sat down to give it a go. They were right, every one of them; this movie lived up to the hype and then some. That said, while it treads the line between supernatural drama and horrorGudio is certainly exploring the former in this film, though he throws in enough jumps to keep fans of the latter interestedit is that rare beast that, I think, will satisfy fans of both genres.

Plot: Rosalind Leigh (Vanessa Redgrave, whose last foray into big-screen horror was the infamous 1971 film The Devils) has died recently; we never actually see her, except in video footage, but she narrates the film. Its actual main character is Leon (The Conspiracy's Aaron Poole), her son, who has returned to the family pile in order to put Rosalind's affairs in order, get her things sold, etc. He knew, we discover early on, that she was involved in a weird new age cult; on his first night staying in the house, however, he discovers she was much more involved than he knew, and that the cult may be more dangerous than he suspected.

There are obvious echoes of a number of other movies here, ranging from any selection of Hammer classics you can name to the more recent Lovely Molly and Kill List, but Gudio, who also wrote, has his own vision and his own voice, and there is no question of The Last Will and Testament of Rosalind Leigh is its own film. As with many of the more recent horror films I have found myself loving, this is slow, introspective, much more on the atmosphere side of things than the jump side of things. If you were that guy (the only person in the room, or on the planet maybe, who actually liked, say, An American Haunting), then The Last Will and Testament of Rosalind Leigh is not the movie for you. If you like character-driven films that aim to disturb rather than scare, where the queasiness in your belly comes from what you see out of the corner of your eye rather than the buckets of fake blood the special effects guy used, this movie is going to be right up your alley. One of the best horror films so far this decade, as far as I'm concerned. ****",1383350400,,2778,4.41130604288499

5691839,4,B00C6F622M,"Short version: So, it's true. This one's definitely *not* destined to be one of the great horror films of all time or the next X weeks of ""limited release"". But consider watching it anyway, because it's really terrifying in five or six spots. Takes a while to build, but that made it more believable to me when The Bad Things Happened.

A couple more reasons why I actually recommend this one. If,like me, you can't get enough horror and thriller films, but you've developed zombie and vampire fatigue, you may find this one about the house of Rosalind somebody is worth renting to get that handful of very well done terror moments.

It's no spoiler to mention there's also a classic horror ending, the kind that seems understated on one level, then disturbing a few minutes later. After you've turned out the lights.

Beyond the scary bits, two things: great acting from the hipster guy we see the most of, and though I'm no expert, some of the best sound effects and overall sound I've heard from any film. Cheesy sound usually betrays low budget films, whatever genre. Not this one, it had major Hollywood budget quality sound on what I'm guessing's possibly a modestly budgeted Canadian board of culture film. And another good point: no shaky cam!  Now that I think of it, better than average camera stuff all around --no camera man shadows where there shouldn't be. Many mega budget horror movies don't bother fixing wrong shadows these days.

What else it seems to me this weird little movie does a worthy job on...First, a familiar dilemma of the full-on macabre that in this film, turns personal: Ever been locked up at night in the house of someone you know who recently died? Most horror films in the Scary House sub-genre open with a night of terror in a house whose previous occupant had absolutely no connection with the unlucky over-nighters. So that contrast to the usual formula is a plus. Second, the question every horror film asks: Just how much assault can your belief system take in one night, that one night of your life when all bets are off?

Most of us, at some point, are going to be stuck, like this guy, spending the night in the house that belonged to some one we know or loved who's recently passed on.

Yeah, even those of us who're veterans of Burning Man and believe, short of war, we've pretty much tried it, so, yawn,  what's left that could terrify sophistos like us? That's who this film's protagonist is, the worldly kind of lo-fi attractive, not handsome, not rich, not poor, unattached, self-absorbed hipster...and of course, those are all the reasons why this guy who looks just like the guy you believe you are as cool as, the one you see at the really good coffee bar you only go to on Sunday afternoons is believable. He's the guy who keeps making all the wrong decisions.

Anyway, this film presents an intriguing proposition for those who've made that real-life weird journey, forced to keep watch --alone-- in the house of the dearly departed, and for those who haven't...yet. You could say this film's a kind of negative road map, an example of how *not* to attempt to get through a night that starts out quirky and turns into something too terrible to ever tell anyone else about.",1380585600,16,3229,4.650877192982456

5691845,4,B00C6F622M,"As a preface, I have to say that I prefer a horror film that doesn't have a lot of gore or that relies on a lot of pop-ups. In fact, I tend to like things like The Innkeepers where you're not even sure anything supernatural is going on. So, if you want violence or a bunch of jumps, this is not the movie for you.

If you like a movie with a creepy atmosphere and an interesting story, then you will like this one. The premise is basically this antique-dealing son who lost his father to suicide at a young age, returns to his hyper-religious probably cult-following mother's house after her death. He has never been to the house in question (all his memories show a different house)and does not share her religious fervor. In fact, it becomes apparent that they had a really terrible relationship. Anyway, as he starts to pack things up, he starts bringing up his old feelings and begins to see or hear or feel things that may not be there. It's implied that he's been seeing a psychiatrist at some point, and you see he's brought medication with him.

Ultimately, this movie didn't end the way I expected. If anything, I feel it had a very real element of horror, not relying on an exorcism or a zombie or whatever to scare you. The overall theme deals with the effects of loneliness and isolation. At the end, you kind of think about your life and your relationships, instead of hiding under the covers.

It's definitely not for everyone. I think if you like foreign films, which I find tend to move slower, you'll like this one. Or if you just want something different.",1377734400,5,1573,4.454861111111111

This is a a one man movie. A very unique, Gothic house, and an huge array of emotions owned by himself and by his deceased mother.

The film begins with Leon returning to his mother's estate after her demise. Her home is a foreboding house filled with winding staircases and creepy antique angel statues, figures, painting, and various other strange objects. The floors and doors creek and the dim light cast shadows across it's dark walls.

But there is something dark within it's walls. Soon. Leon begins to feel there is someone there with him. Messages are written for him. Items of meaning are placed by him.

All the while, the film is narrated by Vanessa Redgrave as Leon's mother. And as the film unfolds, so does her loneliness and heartbreak as she tries to communicate with Leon from beyond the grave.

This film is not for everyone. It is very moody and arty. The camera swoops about Leon just as if it were a ghost itself.

And then you realize just how lonely a grounded spirit just might be.",1377302400,3,1137,4.517073170731707
5691849,2,B00C6F622M,"Some of the previous reviews do a great job summarizing what they story was about (or at least they put out some good theories) so if you're trying to figure out what was going on, check a few of the other reviews voted most helpful.

The production is great. A lot of care and thought was put into evoking a moody, disquieting, and ultimately spooky atmosphere.

Where the film fell short for me was trying to accomplish too much without involving me on an emotional level. I know I found it tedious and boring and as intrigued as I was, I just didn't care enough to want to sit through to the end.

There are tons of interesting ideas explored: the relationship between mothers and their children, the nature of belief, limits of religious cults, whether a cult however well-intended it's practitioners is ultimately damaging, the effects of loneliness and mental illness. Each idea by itself can be a rich foundation on which to create a film.

The problem is The Last Testament tries to tackle them all in one film and a limited film at that.

I guess just that fact that these themes came through is a positive comment on the director's abilities.

Still it seems crazy ambitious to take on all these themes in a one-actor film. And the actor in this film is good but at the same time doesn't reveal much of the character's interior world. Even if you take the argument that ultimately we're being shown the mother's memories and limited knowledge of her son as a person, I'd argue back that without a multi-dimensional character, it's difficult to develop empathy for the character and without the ability for audience members to project themselves into the story, it remains a cerebral exercise and ultimately unsatisfying.

The only ""real"" character is Vanessa Redgrave as the narrator, Rosalind Leigh with whom I did feel empathy.

As I write this, it occurs to me that ultimately, The Last Will and Testament of Rosalind Leigh is a tragedy with supernatural trappings.

And for a tragedy to do something more than leave the audience feeling depressed and despairing, the ending requires a lesson to help the audience put the events into a larger perspective. For example, an individual tragedy teaches the community a lesson about tolerance.

Alas there is no perspective or lesson learned in this film making it interesting and atmospheric but ultimately an exercise in existential despair.

Some people have a taste for this type of film. But if you're like me and you like a little meaning at the end of lots of trials and tribulations, look elsewhere for a good, spooky film to watch.",1376784000,2,2598,4.76391982182628

The creepy ornaments, which you imagined would come to life any second were incredibly scary.  The fact that he had brought all his luggage and intended to stay, made me want to scream at him, ""don't stay the night, get out of the house"".
His mother was a lonely old woman who had chased her only son away with her threats that if he didn't believe, the angels would turn their backs on him. She was disappointed and annoyed that he hadn't returned to see her before she died, so this was another reason why the son should have high tailed it out of there.  But he didn't, he went out and got something to make for his supper and started to read some of the literature that was lying about and played a cassette about believing in life after death.

For a ghost story, that works to its advantage. You're not quite sure what is going on within the first 15 minutes but it soon becomes clear that the director had far more on his mind than what he's leading on. The Gothic details throughout the house are simply incredible and very eerie with lots of creepy imagery. There is a narration by the wonderful Vanessa Redgrave who plays the deceased Rosalind Leigh throughout the length of the film. Normally this would seem an annoying detraction but it suits this film quite well and adds to the unease you will feel while wandering through the house with the protagonist. There are definitely things that go bump-in-the-nite here and will have the hairs on the back of your neck standing straight up. The tension mounting in this film is really remarkable! Does the ending hold up as well as the rest of the film? For me, not quite. It's not as cohesive as the rest of the movie but it didn't really bother me.

The film was mildly interesting. The constant narration, a major part of the story, grew weary. Leon, our only actor, has no character build up.

Indeed, its rare that such a slow paced movie manages to hit all the right notes...not to mention the creepy religious  imagery that keeps you on the edge of your seat...

I do want to stress that those who love gore, high action and expensive effects ( and there's nothing wrong with that) may not like this one. The creature was pretty freaky though.

Some spoilers

The movie is open to interpretation so what exactly happened to the main character and his mother is something you decide... Was she right and her religious beliefs true? Was her son/ his girlfriend right to think she was manipulative? What part did the cult play in his dad's suicide? Was the son actually experiencing this or was he crazy? Did the mother actually commit suicide or are we watching her hallucinations?

The movie seems to examine the nature of loneliness, despair and faith. For those of you who are religious, or at the very least, raised with religion-it will probably be reminiscent of those who may have taught that to despair is to turn your back on God.

To me, the mother's loneliness and despair which drove her to turn her back on God and commit suicide -- manifested as this demon whom he later battles with as he is drawn into her world of despair by revisiting the house. The mother was hoping her death would finally bring him back to her. This is perhaps the most sad element of the story because her faith drove him away in the first place and then her despair drove him away upon her death.

Amid the constantly recycled concepts and axioms that both plague and serve as hallmarks for the horror genre, this film manages to stand out as original. The story is nothing wowing and the horror elements are technically not unique.  But the approach was!  Because of this, I struggle to compare this to any other horror.

After her passing and leaving everything to her only son, antiquities dealer and atheist Leon (Aaron Poole) visits his estranged mother's (Vanessa Redgrave) home which is neatly, but densely decorated with all manner and medium of Christian--and not so Christian--artifacts, making it somewhat unsettling.  The house is also littered with stitched and framed religious adages formed into strange warnings.

The recently deceased Rosalind Leigh (Vanessa Redgrave; Nip/Tuck) narrates, explaining her distance from her son, her deep religious beliefs and Leon's resentful distance from the faith.  In this modern approach to a classic-style ghost story Rosalind, haunted by her past, learns what it will be like to remain forever alone.

There is plenty of creepy in this house of angel statues and forces which would prey on the non-believers dwelling within.  As we question where Leon's soul will fall on the counterbalance weighing Leon's lack of faith against those powers that would claim his ungrateful soul, he his hunted by some manner of beast outside the house.

This film features only one character that we ""see.""  There are many represented by video or voice (as by phone call), but we watch only Leon interact with his surroundings.  His therapist girlfriend remotely leads Leon and us viewers to question if Leon is going mad, or if he really is being hunted by an other-worldly evil.

Writer/director Rodrigo Gudio shows us some proficient camera work.  Nothing spectacular, but he serves his film well.  The CGI effects are better when they're not the focus of the shot.  Briefly animated statues elicit expected uneasy jumps and the beast, when framed in a shadowy corner, is scary and of off-putting form.  But when it comes to fully revealing the creature via close-ups or action, it's just some anorexic werewolf-looking thing from a ScyFy movie-of-the-week.

The poor quality CGI and use of a single on screen actor help inform us of the small budget Gudio had at his disposal for his first feature length film.  Being the lone actor, Aaron Poole faced an unusual challenge having no one with whom he could directly interact.  So don't be too quick to criticize his performance or Gudio's story staging.  I'd love to see what Gudio could do with even a small studio budget for a theatrical release.  He has good ideas and a proficiency that exceeds most horror filmmakers of such limited experience.

See this, be mindful of Gudio's financial limitations and get stoked for the day this guy gets a budget and some more actors to direct.",1375488000,25,3019,5.004008016032064

Not sure if this is a spoiler or not, but at one point, even the main actor leaves and I just thought it was unfair that they let him go and I had to stay.",1528588800,,328,3.739130434782609

8577721,5,B00C6F622M,Its a slow moving beautiful story. Not recommended for those who want a great deal of action and jump scares. Psychological and dreamy. I loved it,1521244800,,146,4.653846153846154
8577722,4,B00C6F622M,"This is a well-made, creepy, slow-burn horror film on which we never see a human face. It's done entirely in two voice-overs as a man explores his late mother's house, and it's quite impressive how writer-director Rodrigo Guidino gets around the technical restrictions and uses them to his advantage.

It is -not- as amazing as Guidino's six-minute horror short on YouTube, ""The Facts in the Case of Mister Hollow,"" which is an evolving look at one 3-d black and white photo. Seriously. Watch ""The Facts in the Case of Mister Hollow"" immediately. But ""Last Will and Testament"" is still worth watching; one hopes Guidino's second feature will hit the heights of ""Hollow.""",1505692800,,670,4.982142857142857

8577724,2,B00C6F622M,"They didn't do much with this story, couldn't understand if it was going to be a creature feature type movie or psychic type with the action happening all in the protagonist's head, both didn't work very well. Was waiting for some good ol crazies coming after you type movie... that didn't happen either.  Just weak all around.",1500768000,,327,4.7368421052631575
