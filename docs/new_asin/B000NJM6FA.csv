8178714,4,B000NJM6FA,"David Leadbetter's teaching, while not in current vogue, still sets the standard for clarity, insight and easy to understand instruction.  Videos are of high quality and are applicable to all skill levels - which is both good and bad.  This series is best for 10 handicap and above, including new golfers.  A little ""light"" for low handicaps, it is still a worthwhile re-fresher of basics with excellent reminders of success generating tips.",1395619200,,441,5.097222222222222
8178715,5,B000NJM6FA,Good stuff. Get the information from the DVD and go practice. You'll be amazed by the improvements you'll recieve. Get Started,1381276800,,126,5.0476190476190474
8178716,4,B000NJM6FA,"Some great tips and great drills.  Also, very good graphics and camera angles to illustrate his points.  It is no wonder, he is one of the best golf instructors around.  I can't stand the he wears his clothes, especially that he pulls his pants up to his chest, but that should not detract from his excellent instruction.",1256428800,,321,4.5964912280701755
8178717,5,B000NJM6FA,"Los videos son muy buenos como todo lo que hace Leadbetter, son muy claros, lastima que no estan en espaol. los recomiento al igual que la cinta de entrenamiento.",1247616000,,162,4.620689655172414
8178718,3,B000NJM6FA,"This is a helpfull set ,dealing with best tips , course management and
some drills to improve the game . I get a feeling that these three DVDs
are not selling as well as Leadbetter other DVDs so they have been clubbed together .
Leadbetter is an excellent trainer and provides valuable insights to improve your game, but I found a number of lessons are repeated in the set , this could have been avoided .",1246665600,4,405,4.342105263157895
8178719,2,B000NJM6FA,"Too much basic stuff, not enough significant instruction. I would not pay for instruction from this teacher. This DVD lacks too much.",1242432000,3,133,5.090909090909091
8178720,2,B000NJM6FA,"Try something else, this is an old collection of tips that will not help your game much. Leadbetter is a great teacher--but these lessons are just not worth the money, try some other dvds.",1239840000,5,188,4.5588235294117645
