8592020,4,B00DCUTR68,"Four short stories, each with a surprise twist.  Don`t read the back of the package because it gives all the surprises away!!!!  Some of the film is a bit worn with dark edgers here and there.  The sound is good and the charismatic Charles Boyer is as charming as ever.  Most of the actors aren`t well known but in one story there is an actress who later won an Oscar. A challenge for you film buffs to recognise her  I think the DVD is well worth watching.",1435017600,,457,4.206896551724138
8592021,5,B00DCUTR68,"Having CB in each of the 4 stories was great...watched the whole thing within 24 hours of receiving DVD.  If you like Charles Boyer, I recommend getting this collection.",1381449600,,169,4.827586206896552
