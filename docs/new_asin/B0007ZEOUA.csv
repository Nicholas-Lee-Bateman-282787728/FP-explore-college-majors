8323969,4,B0007ZEOUA,"Pacifica is traveling with her brother, Shannon, and her sister, Raquel. Pacifica has a terrible destiny. She is referred to as the Scrapped Princess. The Scrapped Princess is said to be born under a cursed star and bring destruction to the entire world. Nearly the entire world is out to kill her. There is nowhere they can hide, so they stay on the move. Shannon is a talented swordsman, and Raquel is a strong sorceress. Pacifica has very good protectors. At first glance, Pacifica tends to seem like a spoiled brat. Sometimes she makes a complete turnaround and shows a sweet and caring attitude. It's kind of wierd how she changes like that. The 3 siblings will meet many people on their journey. Some will become friends and others will betray them. One thing is for sure; there will be lots of action and plot twists.

This series is pretty good. It has a good mix of action, comedy and drama. There are some really good characters that are developed well. This series stays focused on the main plot and doesn't diverge like a lot of the fantasy animes out there. It has good animation, voice acting, and a decent soundtrack. I really enjoyed it, but there are tons of better shows out there. I'll give it 4 stars, because even though I enjoyed it, it didn't blow me away.",1356480000,,1279,4.560869565217391

8323971,5,B0007ZEOUA,"My daughter loved these dvds so much, we have ordered every set, not to mention it comes with a figure.",1273881600,,103,4.2
8323972,5,B0007ZEOUA,"One would think that our party might catch a break after leaving town. But, instead they are attacked by an unusual assasin, which causes a crisis for Pacifica's friend Leopold, and reunites her with the man who first tried to kill her as a baby. Later, an abandoned girl attaches herself to Shannon, ultimately resulting in tension and heartbreak amoung the siblings. More clues are provided as to the truth of what's happening, and Shannon gains a powerful ally(?) as this unusual story moves forward.

There's alot more going on here than is evident at first glance, and the writers are careful to build things slowly. As before, the animation is superb, and the whole thing works very well from a technical standpoint, though I find myself relying on the captions instead of the recorded dialogue. It's a small price to pay for a great story.",1161648000,,846,4.794520547945205
8323973,5,B0007ZEOUA,"After watching the first volume, there was no doubt in my mind to watch the rest of the series and buy all of the DVDs.  Scrapped Princess is definitely the best anime I have ever seen!!

In volume II, the main characters encounter a musician who uses deadly bugs that try to kill Pacifica, the Scrapped Princess.  Afterwards Shannon, Pacifica's older brother, proclaims his desire to protect Pacifica from any harm:

""You're right, I swore I would protect her.  I promised that I would protect her from anything that tried to take her away from us.

I want power.  The power to save her.  Enough power to change destiny.  Power to fight, even if it makes the whole world and God himself my enemy.""

The delimma between protecting an innocent girl or saving the world continues in this volume.

The English voice cast is wonderful.  Sometimes they performed better than the Japanese voice cast.  The animation and action is a lot better than the first volume.  This anime series just keeps getting better and better!!

Bandai did a wonderful job recreating the world of Scrapped Princess for the US audience.",1158796800,,1108,4.757894736842105
8323974,5,B0007ZEOUA,"One thing that you know in the world of Scrapped Princess is that you never truly know the real intentions of anyone you encounter. For example in the first episode on this dvd, what seems a chance encounter with a mediocre minstrel, leads to a battle when he reveals himself as a bounty hunter able to control swarms of poisonous insects! And with his big mouth he just might reveal Pacifica's secret to Leo! And there are other more powerful forces moving against the Scrapped Princess. Peacemakers, powerful beings that claim they are servants of God, who can control humans, attack once again. Behind the scenes, Christopher, the assassin from Volume 1 has been sent to investigate the true meaning of the prophecies concerning Pacifica.

Once again this series great strength is in the love between Pacifica, Shannon, and Raquel which allows them to stand against an entire world! While Pacifica wonders whether she would be better off dead, her brother and sister are always there to help her. It seems like most of the people that try to kill them are won over by their kindness and dedication to each other. Hopefully, the prophecies are wrong.

The extras are pitiful with the only one being a textless ending. To me, the picture quality is not as good as it could be, especially when there are dark backgrounds. The Japanese voice acting is superb.",1125792000,,1358,4.799145299145299
8323975,4,B0007ZEOUA,"Well, if you are looking for a synopsis of the series, look at disk 1.

This is probably one of my faovrite animes, and it's about time they brought it to the USA.

Well now the important notes.  This series DVDs as with most anime series DVDs are being released every other month.  The doll that comes with the set has her feminine features far to over accentuated.  I think mile long legs are great, but 2-3 mile long legs.  Just get the regular DVD and save yourself a 10 spot.",1121299200,5,480,4.21978021978022
