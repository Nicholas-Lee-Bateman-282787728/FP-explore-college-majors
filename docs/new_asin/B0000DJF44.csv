8001215,4,B0000DJF44,"This was a pretty cute romance-comedy.  Paul Ko (Louis Koo) is a popular and handsome police officer who has a problem.  Carrie (Sammi Cheng) is a reporter for a gossip magazine in which they want to let all their readers know whether or not the popular Louis Koo does or does not have this problem.  Carrie receives the assignment to find out whether or not Paul really has a problem.  The two hit it off pretty quickly.

Raymond (Lau Ching-Wan) is a judge and has a past relationship with Carrie but because Raymond is caught cheating on Carrie, the relationship is broken.  Raymond meets Tabby (Charlene Choi) during a trial case where Tabby was suing someone for sexual harassment.  After Tabby meets Raymond, she tries to hit on him.

All the actors/actresses did a good job and they appear quite believeable.  The story also flows pretty well.  This movie is worth watching at least once.",1196640000,2,894,4.709677419354839
