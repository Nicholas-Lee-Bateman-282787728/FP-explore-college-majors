My favorite thing about it is the bond between the two main characters, Marin and Kanon. The girls seem nothing alike at first, but they become friends anyway, and must work together to seal away Sedna, an ancient evil. But as their quest goes on, they discover that what they've been told may not be the exact truth...

Another great thing about this show is the music. A lot of it is gentle piano music that can easily lull you to sleep. The opening song, Violet, is also if this nature and is a joy to listen to. The visuals are fantastic as well, especially the magic effects!

My all-time favorite thing about this show, and what makes it stand out for me most, though, is the lesson at the end. In a lot of magical girl shows, darkness is synonymous with evil. Some evil characters may be sympathetic, but they're still on the 'wrong' side. That isn't the case here. In Umi Monogatari, everyone has darkness within them, and THATS OKAY. Accept your inner darkness, your fears and flaws, because throwing it out or fighting the emotions won't solve anything. That simple idea has helped me so much in life, and I want to rewatch this show as a reminder, so i can be a better me.",1408665600,,1323,4.326612903225806
