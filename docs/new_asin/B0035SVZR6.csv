This video is incredible. If you enjoy the wilds and the beautiful animals out there this video may show you mule deer that you would not believe if you had not seen them personally. Deer get old and die at close to 13 years and these monsters on film may have been near the end of their days and they are preserved for lots of us to see with awe. Muley Crazy videos are spectacular to watch too. I love the wilds and respect those who spend months on end to film such rare monster ""Mossbacks"" by Daryl Moss and troops.

Climbing and climbing takes lots of zip and snap and then the camera. Wow what great pictures and great effort",1388793600,,825,4.248407643312102
