But, the DVD for Season One is a total bust- somebody messed up the technology.  The",1425254400,,207,4.857142857142857
8359818,5,B002AMVE9W,"Tracey Ullman is a one of a kind comedian with many faces, a clever, quick witted mind, and a great sense of humor who unleashed her critical view of typical Americans, whether they are rich or poor, she doesn't hold back!  I found many of her skits hilarious!",1423440000,,260,4.416666666666667
8359819,5,B002AMVE9W,"...these DVDs have no subtitles or captions on them, so those like me who listened to Led Zeppelin too loudly in the 1970s are SOL. (I thought there were laws requiring closed-captions on DVDs -- I guess there's so many laws now nobody even knows what they are any longer.)  Anyway, Ms. U. and the cast are in top form here, and Bruce Wagner is one of the writers.",1394150400,,364,4.27536231884058
8359820,4,B002AMVE9W,My favorite sketches of Tracey Ullman's! I only wish there was more material. Only seven half hour episodes and virtually no DVD extras. That may pass for a season in UK but not here. Overall the best Ullman sketch show with a much larger budget than her previous Takes On series. Showtime should green light a fourth season!,1366329600,,325,4.620689655172414
8359821,5,B002AMVE9W,"Hilarious, she should be an A list star. She is so talented love, love, love this series! If you don't know her yet, that's too bad. She's the bomb :)",1357257600,2,150,4.033333333333333
8359822,5,B002AMVE9W,"If you were a fan of Tracy Ullman's HBO show ""Tracy Takes On""  You will love this too!  It's as good (if not better)",1355443200,,116,3.7916666666666665
8359823,5,B002AMVE9W,"Tracy Ullman is a rare talent.  This comes through on the STATE OF THE UNION DVD.  She's fun, sarcastic, and hits American culture right on the head---one forgets she's British most of the time. Very enjoyable...although some of the sketches are a bit racey.",1326758400,,258,4.840909090909091
8359824,3,B002AMVE9W,"Tracy as comical and entertaining as always did her best work with State Of The Union. I guess being American it's easier to relate but I find her third season of The Union the best. I also purshed the seasons of Tracy Takes On that Ive missed and even though they made me laugh I still have to give State of the union thumbs up. I hope she comes back with more State Of The Union, Its just so easy to laugh at US. [[ASIN:B001D2WUB6 Tracey Ullman's State of the Union: Complete Season One]",1278720000,,489,4.212765957446808
