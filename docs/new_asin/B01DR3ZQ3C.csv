7722727,3,B01DR3ZQ3C,Interesting history behind Phillip and his family background (German). Mountbatten's maneuverings to fix Phillip up with Elizabeth.,1468627200,3,131,6.764705882352941
7722728,4,B01DR3ZQ3C,"I never knew! I think a better title is the one I used though. The fact that Phillip had to give up giving his children his name, walk 2 steps behind her in public and was an outcast for so long after marrying the love of his life makes it a great story. They are the cutest old couple too!! :)) For an excellent companion to this I would also suggest viewing: The Majestic Life of Queen Elizabeth II (2013)",1468540800,14,407,4.1
7722729,4,B01DR3ZQ3C,"Some very interesting facts here that I did not know. Much of it is kind of gossipy and second-hand ""knowledge,"" but it was very interesting.",1468454400,3,141,4.68
7722730,4,B01DR3ZQ3C,"The story of Prince Philip's. early life and influences introduced me to historical facts surrounding his lineage that makes current history even more interesting. I found it very interesting in light of the Queen's popularity and amazing long reign!  It highlights an unusual, faithful witness to the relationship of the Queen to her husband.  My admiration of both of them gives me food for thought as we witness world-wide leaders and their family relationships.  It turned out to be challenging and brought new insights to current history.",1485993600,,543,5.218390804597701
7722731,4,B01DR3ZQ3C,I enjoyed this documentary. Prince Phillip is quite fascinating as is the era he and Elizabeth were married.,1485907200,,108,5.055555555555555

7722734,4,B01DR3ZQ3C,Good stuff! I enjoyed it. Its always fascinating to learn what occurred behind the closed doors. Its interesting to understand how royalty & politics co-exist in such a disciplined and rigid atmosphere.,1485734400,,202,5.34375
7722735,5,B01DR3ZQ3C,"As a child (six and onward) I had the pleasure of catching glimpses of both Prince Phillip and Queen Elizabeth, on their rare visits. Indeed I can recall a picture of ""The Queen"" at home. I was also given her name.  Admittedly,I had a life crush on Prince Phillip (over fifty five years), but only in the sense of him being this  strong, silent protector of the gentle Queen Elizabeth. A man I do not recall ever hearing, he always publicly responded the way one grew up expecting a husband to behave. Watching him respond crisply to the reporter, gave life and rekindled curiosity. This was an excellent background film with original footage, and a great introduction to the life and upbringing of Prince Phillip.",1485561600,3,714,4.704
7722736,4,B01DR3ZQ3C,Interesting and unique ... could be more substantive !,1485561600,,54,5.111111111111111
7722737,5,B01DR3ZQ3C,"Thought it was filled with information, most of which I did not know. He is an interesting character and watching this goes hand in hand with watching The Crown.",1485475200,,161,4.586206896551724
7722738,2,B01DR3ZQ3C,"Yes, this had some good vintage film and nice to have his 1st cousins, who were at court during his and QEII's early marriage, to give their versions of what life was like then, but I think the tabloidy Nazi dirt digging was rather silly (but every show tows the tabloid line nowadays).  I have found no evidence that there were any untoward Nazi ties going on re Prince Philip and it is loosely implied here by association and relatives (what our families do is not always indicative of what we do or believe).  The House of Windsor was always known to me as a German house, esp in the last century.  Philip wasn't known to be near as 'German', at least in America. His father was Greek and of Greek and Danish (plus Russian) royalty by way of a Danish-German house that ruled in Denmark, Greece, and Norway.  His mother was Princess Alice of Battenberg, who stayed in Athens during the Second World War, sheltering Jewish refugees, for which she is recognized as ""Righteous Among the Nations"" at Yad Vashem.  This was listed as a 'series', but it has only one episode.  And from the seemingly little and of surface quality that is presented, I assumed further episodes would delve deeper.  But no.  You can get more biographical information by looking up Prince Philip's Wiki entry.",1485475200,6,1284,4.6255506607929515
7722739,3,B01DR3ZQ3C,Pretty good and did provide some historical facts unknown to us,1485388800,,63,4.818181818181818

7722741,4,B01DR3ZQ3C,"Interesting, if factual.  Would have liked more information about what his role has been since marriage.  He appears to be quite devoted to his wife in spite of the apparently ""arranged"" aspect.",1485302400,,194,5.03125
7722742,5,B01DR3ZQ3C,"the movie was quite revealing of the man behind the throne, Philip and Uncle Dickie were a plot to control the throne do not and have never cared for Prince Philip he always seems to me a little off center to me. but the movie shows all that.
This a must see film for those interested in the Royal Family.",1485302400,,305,4.1
7722743,3,B01DR3ZQ3C,"Full of surprises, I was unaware of his early life and the controversy surrounding their romance and marriage, and information regarding his mentor Mountbatten was the big surprise of all.",1485216000,,188,5.3

7722746,5,B01DR3ZQ3C,Great! I had just watched the Netflix Crown series. This was a great documentary that really mirrors and gives depth to the Crown.,1485129600,,130,4.695652173913044

7722751,3,B01DR3ZQ3C,"Since there was so much about how difficult it was for Prince Philip to work his way into this rather nutty family one wonders why he was so nasty and unhelpful to Lady Diana, Princess of Wales when she was trying to become a part of the same nutty family.",1484956800,,256,4.14
7722752,5,B01DR3ZQ3C,Very interesting. Learned a lot about him that I didn't know.,1484784000,,61,4.636363636363637
7722753,3,B01DR3ZQ3C,Another perspective on the Duke of Edinburgh - I've always thought of Prince Philip as a different sort of person.  This background about his family or lack of family helps explain many things.  The production values remind me of a 1960s TV special - it's fun to revisit that period.  Good for a rainy Saturday afternoon.,1484697600,,321,4.696428571428571

7722789,4,B01DR3ZQ3C,I found this short very interesting.  It was nice to learn about Prince Philip and his family.  There seems to be so much on the Queen and her family not near as much on him.  Enjoyed it.,1482537600,,187,4.0
7722790,5,B01DR3ZQ3C,"Prince Philip has been kind of an unknown to the general public. I made a lot of assumptions about him due to the fact that nothing much was written about him. He was called Prince Philip of Greece, but this film gave us the facts. His mother was British. Princess Alice was a dark horse and it seems she was ""whited out"" of history.  Thank you, Mr. Sanders, for enlightening us about this man. He has received a bad rap.",1482451200,,421,4.2625

Not too much about anything personal in terms of what he, himself thinks...of course he would have to guard himself, wouldn't he. That bit about adjusting to always walking two steps behind his wife may have been the most revealing bit of all.",1481241600,2,389,4.909090909090909
7722828,3,B01DR3ZQ3C,"Typical, shallow documentary about an English royal.  Oddly enough, I was expecting it to contain more about him: how he adapted to the seeming effeminate role of King Consort would have made it interesting.  Otherwise, it is much like the pedigree of a fine stallion on film.  I sense he is a far more interesting person than this documentary presented.  From my recall of various events and instances where we have been given access to his thoughts and deeds he is rather hilarious in a quintessentially British way.  Observant, irreverent, quick, sporting, and lets face it, absolutely DASHING; that's what I was hoping would be highlighted.",1481155200,2,644,5.037735849056604
7722829,3,B01DR3ZQ3C,"Fun documentary about the life of Prince Phillip from his difficult and poverty-stricken childhood to his teen years under the care of Mountbatten, whose name he took. He loved Elizabeth, but not necessarily the crown. And he was a ""dish"".",1481155200,,239,5.0
7722830,3,B01DR3ZQ3C,Interesting- but they spent a lot of time setting up how they got married and not what happens after they married. It's like reading a book that is missing several chapters.,1481155200,,173,4.612903225806452

7722836,5,B01DR3ZQ3C,"Outstanding and interesting.  Watch ""The Crown"" and then this.  Very revealing. Too bad Amazon doesn't put the other episodes out there.",1480809600,,136,5.428571428571429
7722837,5,B01DR3ZQ3C,"I already admired him, but now even more. His persistence of lack of way out gives him more depth yet. I always admired his gentleman attitude towards tne queen endorsing my imagination that English men are more interesting. Egos, when show up  are very boring in a person, especially in a man. Of course, the documentary is biased since his opponents where the historins, but is valid, since he is the last remanescent of his own. He got a wonderful exile. Exiled in public and with honors. He is, after all, a  successful person that I admire even more now.",1480636800,,559,4.58
7722838,3,B01DR3ZQ3C,"This is a very strange movie. We learned that prince Phillip had a very ambitious and manipulative uncle, who wanted him to marry the future queen. So, this uncle introduced Phillip to princess Elizabeth when she was 13, she felt in love and, indeed, eventually married Phillip. Then, the prince found that the queen plays only ceremonious role, and there is even less role for her husband. But what did he expect? What did he want himself? Was he even in love? We are not told. It seems, nobody even cares. It is like this guy - and the queen - are just patsies in somebody else games. On another hand, it is not even clear why we shall  care about all these games. There is nothing about prince Phillip as a person, and nothing about his actual role in the life of the queen, if he has any role at all.",1480464000,5,804,4.2894736842105265

Still, this is just a superficial overview of Prince Philip's life. It would be more interesting if they had delved deeper into his life as consort, specific activities, specific ways he may have affected the queen's opinions and actions, or ways he may not have been able to do so. Just to say at the end, ""he made it work,"" is useless. How did he make it work? How did he change? How did the queen change?",1480291200,15,536,4.479591836734694

7722954,5,B01DR3ZQ3C,"This documentary was rated 5 stars because of the fascinating private home movies, rare film footage out takes and candid commentary by the two daughters of Lord Mountbatten and Prince Rainer of Hesse.

The negatives were that the documentary lacked perspective, exaggerated Prince Philip's ""troublesome...dubious"" Germanic connections and bogusly implied because of his ancestry (ditto because his sisters had married Germans who later joined the Nazi Party) that he was not only defacto a German prince but somehow legitimately suspect. Not true. The reality was far more complicated.
Prince Philip's mother Princess Alive was a great granddaughter of Queen Victoria and was born at Windsor Castle, she spent much of her life in Greece & died at Buckingham Palace. During World War Two Princess Alice was living in Athens, she risked her life hiding Jewish refugees from the Nazis and would be recognized by Israel as a ""Righteous Among the Nations"" honored with a street in her name.
Princess Alice's mother was the progressive leaning Victoria of Hesse the elder daughter of Princess Alice of Britain. The senior Princess Alive (a feminist who deeply missed her native England) married into the Hesse-Darmstadt royal house which was hostile to Germany.
Prince Philip's maternal grandfather was Prince Louis Battenberg who served in the British navy from 1869 and would eventually become England's First Sea Lord of the Admiralty. Prince Louis' brother Henry married Queen Victoria's youngest daughter Beatrice and they lived with the Queen at Windsor.
Prince Philip's paternal grandfather King George 1 of Greece, described in the documentary as originating from a royal house with a ""long German name""--was actually born a Danish prince (favorite brother of  Queen Alexandra of Britain), was fiercely loyal to his adopted country Greece and as was true of most of the Danish Court during the19th Century virulently hated Germany.
Prince Philip's paternal grandmother (wife of King George 1 of Greece) was the Grand Duchess Olga Konstantinovna of Russia, a grand daughter of Tsar Nicholas 1 and her loyalties were staunchly aligned with Britain's ally Tsarist Russia during World War One.
Prince Philip's eldest sisters were almost 20 years older than their brother and Philip not yet 10 years old when his siblings all married and relocated to Germany with the husbands (3 out of 4) who would later join the Nazi Party.
Prince Philip spent most of his youth in England & France and was mentored by his English uncle George of Milford Haven and to a lesser degree by his younger brother Lord Mountbatten and their wives Edwina Mountbatten the granddaughter of Jewish financier Sir Joseph Cassel--and Princess Nada Torby (wife of George Milford Haven) born in France, the daughter of the exiled Grand Duke Michael of Russia and the great granddaughter of Pushkin.
Prince Philip was one of the original pupils of Gordonstoun (Scotland) which he attended from 1934-1939 and was greatly influence by it's founder the Jewish-German educator Karl Hahn. While headmaster at Schloss Salem in Germany Hahn was a fierce critic of the Nazi regime, spoke out publicly against Hitler and was imprisoned. Prince Philip who was attending Hahn's German school at the time (1933) followed the educator to Scotland the following year slamming the Nazis a pack of fools.
Prince Philip's first cousin the beautiful Princess Marina of Greece (daughter of Prince Andrew's brother Nicholas & the Grand Duchess Helen of Russia) had married England's King George V1's younger brother the Duke of Kent in 1934. One of Princess Marina's sisters (Elizabeth) also married a German prince who later allegedly had ties to the Nazi Party.
Prince Philip served with distinction in the British Navy throughout World War Two.
Interestingly--Prince Philip was so closely related to Russia's (anti-German) last royal family executed in 1918 that his DNA was used to identify their excavated remains in 2009.

Upshot: There is no evidence that Prince Philip, his parents or mentors had any connection with the Nazi Party. Prince Philip was no more ""German"" in his ancestry, background and loyalties than the House of Windsor--in pre World War One Britain known as the Royal House of Hanover and Saxe-Coburg Gotha.

---Amusing that Churchill excoriated Prince Philip ""untrustworthy"" ""brash"" ""arrogant"" ""pushy"" ""rude""--i.e., ""not quite one of us"" when those were the exact sentiments used by the British Establishment to marginalize Churchill (with an American mother) and his clique of outsiders--self made power players.",1472947200,11,4586,5.286694101508917

The topic of discussion from the very get-go was in regards to how Prince Philip's eventual marriage to Queen Elizabeth was not circumstance, but indeed planned by Prince P. and his supporters over the span of almost a decade.

7723054,4,B01DR3ZQ3C,"I am not sure that the title really describes this documentary.  Indeed that label is somewhat unfair to the work done to provide a biography of the early years of Prince Phillip's life. Today, Prince Phillip appears to be an abrasive, angry old man. But, really he is living a life chosen for him.
His uncle Mountbatten played matchmaker between this handsome, gifted, but poor young man and the future queen of England. Everybody knew what was happening.  The young Elizabeth was besotted by this tall, beautiful man of German descent. (He was born in Greece but didn't even live there long enough to speak the language.)  He knew his life would be life that of Prince Albert a century before. Most men would not give up their identity in such a fashion.  Prince Phillip can not even give his name to his children. Nor can he even pretend to control anything about his life.
Partly as a result of his own upbringing, Prince Phillip was an awful failure as a father. He was too distant, cold, and un-caring just as his own father was. Prince Phillip even walked out of the marriage for a time.  But to his credit.  He went back. He lived a whole life in the shadow of the woman he loved. He suffered the daily humiliation and cold opposition from the elite of Britain.  That is something that no tawdry ""plot"" can convey.",1469318400,2,1322,4.529411764705882

I already knew a lot about the royal family, but I learned a great deal more from this documentary. My only complaint is that the title is sensationalized and overstated.",1499126400,2,319,4.818181818181818
8756681,5,B01DR3ZQ3C,"Interesting and well made. You can hear the dialogue clearly, no tapping / drumming / clicking or loud music playing over top of what they're saying, no sudden unwanted and unneeded ultra blinding flashes of white light or other disturbing 'special effects' directors seem to love, no camera work looking like a monkey is doing it, ragged splicing and moving from camera angle to camera angle at rapid fire all in the name of (ahem) 'art'.  This documentary was completely and refreshingly unlike 98% if our shows / documentaries / You Tube videos here in the U.S.A. where your senses are assaulted as much as possible while you sit there and tell yourself 'this is entertainment. I'm relaxing and enjoying myself'. Right.  I enjoyed learning about Phillip's family and learning a bit about him. Well done all around.",1496016000,,817,4.913043478260869

8756683,3,B01DR3ZQ3C,"I found it interesting and informative.  I would have appreciated it more if they'd delved deeper into how Elizabeth & Philip negotiated their marriage - did he influence her decisions & in what ways did she influence him?  She had the alpha role and he the minor - did it come naturally to each or both of them & how they navigate those hurdles?  Emphasizing how  emasculating it was for Philip to be subject to the Queen's authority, without any acknowledgment (even one sentence), that women have been subjected to exactly the same inconsequntial rols around the globe for centuries was a flaw in the analysis.  It felt almosf like they were saying the humiliation for Philip was so great that a) any behavior by him would be forgiven his humiliation at having the Queen at a higher rank than he b) there was no realization by the writers this is 2017...do the writers still think today (2017) that it's almost a fate worse than death?",1488758400,2,938,4.626506024096385
