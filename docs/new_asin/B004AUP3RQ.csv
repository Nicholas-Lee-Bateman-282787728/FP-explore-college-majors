4311329,5,B004AUP3RQ,Absolutely love this show! It is funny yet sensitive in it's portrayal of Muslims and Christians and the grand scope of their reactions to each other.,1315612800,6,150,4.8076923076923075
4311330,5,B004AUP3RQ,"As an American Christian unfamiliar with Islam, I have been amused and entertained royally as I learned how my Muslim fellow people of the book live their lives and their faith in a North American small town.  My collection of all four seasons of Little Mosque is the star of my DVD library, even though some of my close friends in New Brunswick can't appreciate the series.

I rank the show five stars even though I squirm a bit whenever the tall Anglican priest declaims his pique. For this season, the writers replaced a mild and comforting warm-hearted bumbler with a shrewed and conniving antithesis of everything a trusted cleric should be. The stars are awarded not because I dislike the character but because he is shaped so clearly as a knave.

The last few minutes of the last episode will gladden your heart.",1300752000,10,819,4.673611111111111

8420927,4,B004AUP3RQ,the dvd is good. I would rate excellent if the last episode  on disc 2 wasn't switched with the 1st episode on disc 3,1405209600,,117,3.875
8420928,4,B004AUP3RQ,"I've followed the series on CBC TV, living near the Canadian border and watching it when aired.  If you haven't seen the series, you need to watch it from the beginning, but you can pick it here and enjoy the humor.",1396396800,,215,4.2439024390243905
8420929,5,B004AUP3RQ,The series is fun and tasteful. It allows Muslims to have fun with their own religion and teach others that we aren't that different after all.,1381622400,,143,4.538461538461538
8420930,3,B004AUP3RQ,"After 3 good years of a unique show which presented a community of muslims having fun despite their differences, disastrous changes were made. I've read that the ratings had slipped during season 3 and then slipped even more with season 4. Replacing the criminally under-utilized but always funny Rev. Magee with the ridiculously unfunny and overused and unbelievably bigoted and conniving Rev. Thorne completely changed the mood of the show. It basically became the Rev. Thorne show with Muslims. Fred Tupper's bigoted but funny character was marginalized to allow more scenes for Thorne. The Imam was consistantly made to look foolish by the new Reverand. Thorne's displeasure with being sent to this small town is always evident and further ruins the previously happy tone of the show. The craziness brought by the young newspaper editor character which was added at the end of season 3 was another big mistake. So in season 4 the show got younger, less Muslim, less real and less funny.",1364256000,,990,5.0426829268292686
