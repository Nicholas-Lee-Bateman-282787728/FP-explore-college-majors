333229,1,6301432827,"Don't be fooled by this movie's ""cute"" title and premise! Reviews on other web sites led me to believe this was a children's movie. Wrong!
Within the first half of the movie you see topless women, a stabbing, cursing and one of the dinosaur parents shot by numerous automatic rifles. I have no idea what happens in the last half of the movie. I turned it off and read books and worked puzzles with my son, who I had bought the movie for.
My advice is don't buy this movie and instead spend true quality time with your child.",1000598400,12,524,4.303030303030303

333408,2,6301432827,"Those who want it are welcome. I am appalled to see this horrid gaff of Disney's Dark Age get to multiple dvd and blu-ray releases.
In 1985 I took three young children to see it. Sean Young had her shirt peeled off and had a jungle clinch with her guy. The violence was not child appropriate. While the plot concerning the filthy plotters is ok, the tone is very mixed.  The extensive nudity of native women was par for the time, but gratuitous. Much of it was in parade scenes in a city which simply filled time.
The baby dino contrasted with the brutal treatment of its parents. I am generally not a carping critic, but I will not forget taking my children to this botch. I have seen only the dvd of several years ago. I noticed that the topless scene with Sean Young and her beau had been mercifully cut. Too much violence remained.
Disney has a habit of cling to the good stuff and dribbling it out in controlled teasing to milk the market. Obviously they have released this repeatedly in single, double feature, and triple feature format. I assume some parents who get the multiple film formats will also be outraged now. Many Disney films such as Johnny Shiloh have been held so tightly illegal dubs abounded for years. To be sensitive to racism in Song of the South and disseminate this exploitative film is beyond understanding.
Two stars are only for the baby bronto.",1402358400,,1376,4.526104417670683

333441,5,6301432827,My kids loved this movie and came across this when looking for stocking stuffers for my grandsons.  That was a mistake.  I have watched it about a hundred times since christmas. They love it just as much as my kids did.,1388880000,,219,4.317073170731708
333442,3,6301432827,"man this movie!, when i saw it here on amazon i had to buy it hands down. I remember watching this as a kid whenever i had the chance to rent it from an old video store that i used to go and since it was about dinosaurs specially from the brontosaurus(which is one of my favorites species) it was natural for me to see it and i was never disappoint by the movie .

Pretty much the story revolves around a scientist discovers the existence of dinosaurs and is killed by another one who wants to take the discovery for himself and become famous. A marry couple try there best to protect this species from been taken by the evil scientist which in this aspect is about the baby brontosaurus. A simple story yet effective, interesting enough this movie was aim for kids which in today standards it wouldn't considered as such. For what it was of its time, the effects where really impressive, one could say Jurassic Park got inspire by this movie.

Now for the blue ray version of this i have to say its kinda disappointing in some aspect ( do not have the dvd version but bare with me):
- the menu selection is very simple with 2 options, play and chapter select.
- No extra There is no Extra which this could have been pretty nice to see like some documentary of the making of the movie, the making of the dinosaurs, some deleted scene or how they did the special effects. heck they could just added a picture collection or some video promotions of the movie when it was gonna be shown in theaters.
- No subtitles:  there is no subtitles options which this could have been of great help since there are scenes that the audio of the characters gets kinda nullified by the music or the sound effects and is kinda noticeable when the main characters are talking and you wanna understand what there saying ( this is only on certain scenes but not in all the movie).
- The unbalancing audio: the balance in the sound effects and the music is kinda off, sometimes the music or the sound effect will just go to loud than usual and i have to lower the volume on my TV because of it and then i might not be able to hear the main characters talking.
- Lower quality video for a Blue-ray: kinda disappointing on this movie, I understand this is a 28 year old movie which is old and its not easy to clean it up but i seen blue-ray of old movies to be more clear than this, and it doesn't help by the fact when you are in the menu and you see the background animation been so clean and clear, i was really really impress by it that i though the movie would look like that, but when i hit play and i see the movie starting the quality, although better than a VHS (video tape), it looks more like a dvd instead of a blue-ray which is kinda disappointing. then again this is a $5 blue-ray movie so hard to see them do that. also i feel this movie should have been wide-screen.

Sure i mention some of the negative of the blue-ray version, but even with that i still don't regret getting it. This is a movie that i grew up with and I always wanted to have. Im really happy to have bought it when i got the chance, sure i would love to see some more improvements like the quality video, audio, subtitles and some extra features, but this is what one gets for $5, a simple menu so this should be expected.

is it worth to get? YES HANDS DOWNS!!! you will not be disappointed by the movie, its well entertaining.",1385251200,,3390,4.2253086419753085

This is a touching story that doesn't go too far with the environmental message. It makes its point without belaboring that point. A very different role for The Greatest American Hero and a fun love interest. An interesting, and seemingly realistic, view of native/modern man meeting and interacting.

Before there was Jurassic Park there was Baby....the most lovable dino ever. I miss seeing dinosaurs portrayed as something natural and not some sort of man made threat, or abberation from another universe. Open your eyes and mind to the possibility that there just might be more large animals that currently exist without our knowledge.

333495,3,6301432827,"PARENTAL NOTICE: The movie contains quite a bit of nonsexual frontal nudity of native Africans.  Parents buying this for their kids should be aware of this fact.
Having gotten that out of the way, let's move on to the actual review.
Baby: Secret of the Lost Legend is an adventure movie from 1985.  It concerns the legendary cryptid Mokele-mbembe of the Congo Basin area of Africa.  The creature is presented here as being a brontosaurus (apatasaurus wasn't widely accepted as the proper name by most laymen in the 1980s).  William Katt and Sean Young portray a young married American couple in Africa who find a family of these dinosaurs while investigating an illness in a remote villiage.
The special effects are very, very dated by today's standards but still remarkable for their ability to add to the story.  Baby, the titular character, is given a range of emotions despite being little more than a large amount of foam rubber.  William Katt and Sean Young both give decent performances and Patrick McGoohan is wonderful as the professor obsessed with the creatures.  The story isn't especially deep and there are a number of standard 80's movie cliches such as the near mandatory helicopter chase scene.
I enjoyed this movie as a kid and am happy to have it in my collection.  It won't be to everyone's taste, especially people who've gotten used to ""Jurassic Park"" style dinosaurs.  With a little suspention of disbelief, however, it can be appreciated by anybody who's ever wanted to find something amazing.",1359331200,,1517,4.91764705882353

333497,4,6301432827,"I saw this years ago as a kid, mind you a g-rated version of it. I've always had a love of dinosaurs as a child and this movie reinforced that back when I saw it in school. The old fashioned visual effects and practical effects work is pretty decent upon my most recent viewing and my young viewers did not seem to mind.

But be warned:
I put this movie on for my sisters kids while I prepped some snacks for them in the kitchen. I hear giggling coming from the living room and low and behold I walk into the living room to see topless large breasted African indigenous tribal women. I was not expecting that and I fast forwarded the scene completely red faced while the kids howled with laughter. Still, I think there was hardly anything wrong with it. These kids watch discovery channel and they occasionally see nudity on Bear Gryllis and so on featuring tribal peoples around the world.

Yes, Mill Creek also corrected the mistake on the cover slip to the correct sound format, instead of Dolby Digital 2.0. OK, it's just marginally sharp then my anamorphic DVD copy from UK, but contrast is definitely better! The DTS-HD MA 4.0 actually sounded pretty solid with good directional effects and bass.

No extra though. But at this cheap price, it definitely worth the upgrade compare to that 10 years old full screen DVD by Disney! Who is the crazy one who will pay $48 for that (unless you want it original DISNEY!)? Anyone want my UK Region 2/PAL anamorphic copy?",1336435200,,693,4.680327868852459

I saw this movie on TV years ago and it was silly and cute but sensored apparently, so I thought I'd buy the DVD.  Little did I know.

At the movie's climax he was yelling encouragement to the mother dinosaur, so it can't of been that bad.  Me, I enjoyed it just as much as the first viewing, although after the Jurasic Park movies the dinosaur special effects were a little dated",1193788800,,527,4.489583333333333
333567,4,6301432827,"The first thing to remember is that this movie is OLD. The special effects are state of the art; for its time. There have hundreds of new revelations about dinosaurs since this movie was made. So some of the dino-data is a bit outdated. As far as movies made before CGI it is very well done.
  I don't think modern day scientists would behave much differently than the ""evil scientist"" in the movie, especially where money is to be made.
 I barely agree with giving the movie a PG-13 for the violence and nudity, but c'mon people! The world isn't an entirely friendly place. Many countries in Africa have children who grow up in war and are forced to join the national army at a very young age. That's just very true to life, and people should understand that. I just think parents should watch this movie with their children just in case.
  The brief nudity is of a national geographic variety and is barely noticable, since it has nothing to do with the plot. The even more brief sexual situation is between a man and woman,...who are married no less! yes folks, that still happens,even today. Again its very true to life. What, are you gonna sue every woman you catch breast-feeding in public?
  It's a very good, if outdated, movie and worth a look.",1193529600,,1253,4.517699115044247
333568,4,6301432827,"I remember first watching BABY: SECRET OF THE LOST LEGEND with my family on the screen of a drive-in movie theatre. Like many children my age, I was fascinated with dinosaurs (and still am) and found the movie completely captivating. I remember crying at a particular scene in the movie and trying to understand why the soldiers with guns were so cruel. Many years later I have been able to watch the film again. I noticed many things I would have never noticed as a kid, such as pacing, acting, etc. However, despite having been made over twenty years ago, BABY remains rather well-preserved and is a special treat for those with a nostalgic attachment.

BABY begins in the streets of an African city during a parade and festival that reminded me of some from a James Bond movie. One man is being pursued through the streets by another. The chase ends in an alley and we discover why the one man was being hunted: photos of the mysterious Mokele-Mbembe, a supposed dinosaur that natives of the Congo believe to still exist and roam the jungles to this day. From the festive streets, the film quickly moves to a more remote area where American sportswriter George Loomis (William Katt of THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO fame) is trying to teach some of the natives at a paleontological research camp how to play baseball. He is interrupted by a phone call from New York offering him a job at the Times. George is eager to get back to the States, but receives the offer just as his wife, Susan Matthews-Loomis (Sean Young), has discovered the biggest find of her life. Susan's mentor, Dr. Eric Kiviat (Patrick McGoohan), tries to downplay her discovery and claims it's just a giraffe. However, after talking with a Red Cross relief worker, Susan begins to realize that her discovery was substantial. A little marital conflict ensues, but Susan sets off down river and is immediately followed by George. Their voyage brings them in contact with a small family of brontosaurs (now known as apatosaurs). But Susan and George aren't the only one's looking for the dinosaurs, so is Dr. Kiviat and he has hired an army of guerrilla soldiers to help him capture the creatures and bring them to captivity. The dinos are in some serious trouble and Susan and George are their only chance for escape.

BABY has elements from several different film genres as evidenced by the cover of the DVD which quotes the Los Angeles Daily News as saying BABY is ""a cross between RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK and E.T."" There clearly is some evidence of Indiana Jones, especially towards the beginning of the movie and at the end. The film does have a similar spirit as E.T. in that Baby becomes separated from her parents and Susan and George try to reunite the broken family. As I mentioned earlier, there also seems to be a bit of spy-action involved, ala James Bond that influences the opening sequence and the way the villain, Dr. Kiviat reacts through much of the film. Despite this hodge-podge of genre mashing, BABY works. The different influences don't stand out in any jarring way and the overall structure of the film flows together rather nicely.

The movie has also aged rather well. Except for a few items of clothing and a heavy bent towards the changing roles of men and women, it's difficult to place the film from a specific period. The movie was made in the mid 1980s, but if someone didn't know that they might guess the movie was made anywhere from the late 1960s until the mid 1990s. About the only thing that has drastically changed since BABY was released are special effects. The special effects in BABY are a far cry from the CGI-heavy films audiences have now become acquainted with. Nevertheless, at the time BABY offered some impressive special effects. Animatronics and classic film trickery make up the bulk of the movie's special effects and they really aren't that bad.

BABY is rated PG, but there are some parents who feel the film isn't appropriate for children. The film was released just as the PG-13 rating was being used. Sensitive parents should know that the movie includes some violence (soldiers with guns, natives with bows and arrows, explosions), some nudity (once again natives dancing and walking in the wilderness), and some foul language. I don't think any of this takes away from the film or is anything that should cause parents and guardians to become too concerned about. The violence in the film is of the type that was typical of early 1980s family television and seems almost cartoony compared to what passes on network television today. The nudity is akin to pictures from National Geographic and the foul language is used rarely (I think there are some sh**s and a couple of d**ns). There's also a hint of sexual innuendo, but it occurs between the married husband and his wife and doesn't seem out of place. In fact, the relationship between George and Susan is a healthy one and could be viewed as a cinematic example of what a healthy, functional marriage is supposed to look like.

I loved BABY when I first saw it as a child and it was one of those movies that has stuck with me my whole life. Seeing the film decades later, I know that it isn't the greatest dinosaur movie ever made, but it's not really that bad either.",1175558400,,5251,4.678571428571429
333569,1,6301432827,"Violence, foul language, semi nudity/foreplay.  This is not appropriate for children. I am surprised it received a PG rating.  It should have been at least a PG-13.  The idea of rescuing a baby dinosaur and its mother is very appealing to children, but the movie would need heavy editing to be a children's movie.

I saw this film in my youth, and went on a quest to own it.  Although some of my appraisal is based purely on nostalgia, I love this movie as an adult.  It is sweet, entertaining and teaches moral lessons about the wrongful quest for fame, fortune, and prestiege at the expense of the innocent.",1138665600,4,567,4.519607843137255
333591,2,6301432827,"This is a dinosaur movie but there is not even a remote possibility that it could be mistaken for Jurassic Park .It centres on a young American couple ,played by William Katt and Sean Young ,who rescue a new born dinosaur baby from the African rain forest .He is a sportswriter and she a paleontologist .

The dinasuar's father has been killed by the evil scientist -Patrick McGoohan -who has also captured its mother .Katt and Young look after the baby ,and set themselves the twin tasks of saving it and rescuing its mother .

There follows a prolonged chase through the jungle aided by friendly natives and menaced by McGoohan and corrupt cops in his pay .

The main problem with the movie is its lurches in tone .There are several violent scenes and the suggestive dialogue between Katt and Young ,together with frequent semi-nudity between them ,renders it unsuitable for the younger audience while the often unconvincing special effects will not play well with older viewers .The dinosaurs are Ok in long shot but look very fake and plasticky in close-up having a Shirley Temple cutsiness that is slightly icky .

It falls between two stools -not really a kids movie and too childish for adults.

7812433,3,6301432827,"Baby: Secret of the Lost Legend is about an amazing discovery in equatorial West Africa. Susan Loomis (Sean Young) is an archeologist looking for fossils. Her boss is Dr. Eric Kiviat (Patrick McGoohan). Susans husband, George (William Katt), is a sportswriter whos taken a leave to be with his wife. George is eager to return to the States, take a job with The Washington Post, and start a family, but Susan wants a find to establish her career.

The baby of the title is a hippo-sized brontosaurus hatchling, which causes considerable conflict between Dr. Kiviat, a man of science who, for plot convenience, is the resident bad guy. He might as well be twirling his mustache and raising his eyebrows. Kiviat has little compassion for the baby, and is determined to enact his nefarious plans, which threaten the very life of the young reptile.

There are lots of cutesy moments in Baby intended to elicit Awwwwws from viewers. Made by the Disney Company, the film knows how to manipulate and lays the cute on thick. A subplot about the conflict between the goals of Susan and George is routine stuff. Both are career-oriented and have put off beginning a family, but this has become a constant concern, causing marital discord. The little dinosaur gives them a lesson in parenting.

The renderings of the dinosaurs vary. The adult dinosaurs look pretty good, but the young brontosaurus of the title is more cartoon-like than realistic, and the filmmakers have given it behaviors resembling household pets rather than wild, prehistoric beasts. The plot is simplistic, motivations are ill-defined, and logic takes a back seat to pure entertainment. Kids will enjoy seeing the baby dinosaur awkwardly and humorously interact with its new human pals. Adults, however, will get a more realistic helping of dinosaurs and stronger drama watching one of the Jurassic Park movies.
