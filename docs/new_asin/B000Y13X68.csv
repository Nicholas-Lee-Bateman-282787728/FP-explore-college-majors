8230765,4,B000Y13X68,"This film is a lot different than you'd think. From the description, you'd think the Dragon Missile owner is the traditional kung-fu hero. He's not, and the movie is all the better for it.

A lord is dying of a deadly disease. On the advice of a doctor, he sends his right hand man, owner of the deadly Dragon Missiles, out to get the one ginseng that can cure him. From there on it becomes a near-constant bloodbath as the ruthless antihero uses any means necessary to get it to his dying lord, while having to deal with intrigue, betrayal, and two heroes who seek revenge for the carnage he has caused. There's similarities to the concept of the flying guillotine with the missiles, but the film feels a lot more like a noir-styled heist that goes wrong that a traditional kung fu movie. Definitely a good surprise, with creative fights, tons of backstabbing, and good characters. One of the better kung fu movies you can watch on prime.",1490227200,,939,4.556213017751479

8230772,4,B000Y13X68,"Not the best effort from the Shaw brothers. The dragon missile has similarities to the flying guillotine from another movie, and the ending seems anticlimactic given the intense fighting throughout the film. But the action is well choreographed, you don't see that in many kungfu movies.",1466640000,,287,5.260869565217392
