8283323,5,B001BJMI9K,"With the last volume, the war has pretty much ended with the defeat of Bian Zoldark but remnants of the Divine Crusaders continue to cause trouble as Adler Koch has taken control.

In episode 17, the Divine Crusaders tried their best to kidnap Princess Shine Hauzen from the Principality of Riksent but the Ryusei and Rai arrived right in time to defeat the DC.

In episode 18 titled ""Stage 18: Ryune and the Valsione"", a gravitational anomaly is detected at the L5 Point, something similar to Meteorite-3 (which was technology used to create the super robots and new weaponry).

As the Earth Federation goes on alert, the two assault cruisers, the Hagwane and Hiryu Kwai are dispatched to the L5 Point.  But waiting for them is Ryune Zoldark and the Valsione.

In episode 19 titled ""Stage 19:  Enter the Hellstar"", the threat that Prof. Bian Zoldark has talked about comes true as the alien Aerogaters massive fortress known as the ""White Star"" has appeared at the L5 Point and the aliens have declared war against the Planet Earth.

As the Earth Federation Army holds their own against the aliens, it appears the aliens are abducting pilots and members of the Earth Federation Army.

Also, one of the higher ups of the Earth Federation Army is revealed to be a traitor that has been working with the Divine Crusaders and has kidnapped the Princess Hauzen.

In episode 20 titled ""Stage 20: Twilight of the DC"", the remaining elements of the Divine Crusaders led by Adler Koch try to take advantage of the Aerogaters attack on the planet and launch an offensive to conquer Geneva, the Earth Federation Army's nerve center.

This episode features the final battle between the Earth Federation Army and the Divine Crusaders and also a battle pitting Ryusei and his ""Burning PT"" rival Tenza

VIDEO:

As for the video, since it's a newer anime series that aired back in the end of 2006 and early 2007, as expected, the anime is clear and colorful. Also, because it is a Bandai Visual release known for their audio and video quality, the anime is presented in 16:9 LB anamorphic with an aspect ratio of 1.78:1.

AUDIO:

Bandai Visual is known for their quality A/V and audio is encoded at 488kbps. There is no Digital 5.1 audio selection, just Dolby Digital Stereo. And primary audio is in Japanese. There is no English dub tracks, for those interested in that.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

Surprisingly, there are no special features. I would expected maybe a textless opening or ending, especially for the JAM PROJECT fans out there who enjoy the opening theme. But unfortunately, there are no special features at all.

As for the DVD-insert booklet, there is an 8-page character guide and glossary. Also, included is a ""Special Message"" (continuing from the last three volume booklets) segment which features more voice talent giving their thoughts about their character and a message for the fans.

After episode 17, with the introduction of Princess Hauzen and the episode becoming lighthearted again, I was curious how vol. 7 would be?  Would the war against the aliens begin?  Will the Earth Federation Army finally confront the Divine Crusader remnants?

And the answer is a resounding yes on both counts!

The battle between Ryusei and Tenzan and pilots versus Tempest Hawker in a battle to the death was great to see.

At least there was build up in previous episodes for a final battle with the DC and it was great to see that happen sooner than later, especially now that the war between the Earth Federation Army/United Colony Corps taking on the alien Aerogaters has begun.

The introduction of Ryune Zoldark (daughter of DC commander-in-chief Bian Zoldark) wanting revenge for her father's death was a bit short for my taste and how quickly the Earth Federation let her join the team aboard the Hagwane, again pacing went very quickly with her introduction and how she becomes part of the team.

But this volume did provide continuing mecha battles and definitely sets things up between the war between humans and aliens.

As far as mecha's are concerned, I have to admit that the Valsione mecha design was a bit unusual, especially since the mecha's head is of an anime style girl but with so many variations of mechas introduced in this series, the Valsione ranks up there for unique mecha design.

All in all, volume 7 of ""Super Robot Wars OG: Divine Wars"" was entertaining and a few more revelations are made and I can't wait to see how things play out in volume 8.",1218153600,,4470,4.7940026075619295
