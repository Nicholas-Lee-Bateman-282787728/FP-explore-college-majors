8613901,5,B001V20DEE,"I first discovered the Building Blocks Instructional Series from my reading of the Epicski Website, where Rick Schnellmann has been graciously offering people the benefit of his vast coaching experience free of charge for many years.  Over the years I've always respected Rick's knowledge and ability to convey the complicated in simple terms, so I was thrilled when I read he had decided to produce an Instuctional DVD series, and was one of the first to get it.

I can tell you that my high expectations for Rick's program have been exceeded.  The Building Blocks training program is amazing.  The lesson plans are so detailed and complete, and the quality of the video and the demos just blew me away.  It's so easy to see the precise movements each drill is trying to teach, how to do them, and also the potential pitfalls and how to avoid them.  Each drill builds upon the prior, and gradually leads you through an easy to learn progression.

My skiing has almost magically improved.  I wasn't sure if I'd be able to do a self-training program with just video as my coach.  I've tried other such programs and was not very successful, but Building Blocks was different.  I've been working on the Building Blocks training program all season, and I'm learning so many things I didn't even realize I needed to.  I'm feeling so much more comfortable on terrain I found very intimidating before, and my skiing now feels so smooth and flowing, I'm having more fun on skis than I ever have before.

Basic Edging teachs you how to steer a turn.  Before this DVD I didn't even know what steering was, much less how to do it.  I've eliminated what Rick describes as the ""pivot"" from my turns.  Didn't even know I was doing it, but now that it's gone my skiing feels so much smoother and I when I see other skiers pivoting it's so obvious.  Wow, so many people ski with a pivot. You need this DVD!",1236816000,,1890,4.563798219584569

Basic Balance is the DVD of the Building Blocks series, but 'basic' may be a bit understated.  While it starts off with easy drills, it gradually builds up to more difficult ones.  I believe this will improve the skiing of most people, and the more difficult drills will be difficult for even the athletic or very experienced skier.  Do not skip this edition and jump right into Building Blocks Advanced .  You need these skills first!",1236816000,3,1931,4.7023809523809526
