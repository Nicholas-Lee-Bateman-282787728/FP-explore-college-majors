4552280,4,B0053TWVGY,"I must say that I find it rather inappropriate to list these 4 reviews since they are not about THIS DVD at all! They are reviewing an older ""The American Civil War, Collectors Edition...NOT the 150th Anniversary Collector's Edition which has only now been released. If you look closely you will see that the dates of the reviews are several years old. It will,I'm afraid, put some people off from purchasing this because of the very poor reviews.",1315353600,56,447,4.743589743589744

After looking at the previous reviews, especially the one saying they are for an older edition (which the product links show it was made in 2008), it could be possible that that DVD is Vol 1 in this set. Visually I found volume 1 quite boring but the audio was interesting with quotes from soldiers. This DVD makes the war seem like it revolved around slavery unfortunately.

I found Vol 2 much more interesting but some material from volume 1 reappears almost verbatim. It is more visually appealing than Vol 1, and quite a few scenes have a person dressed as an African American soldier retelling events from the perspective of the man he's impersonating, this was probably done because these last several minutes and staring at letters or photos would be boring to look at for 5+ minutes straight. This Vol does cover slavery; however, it presents a more balanced version. For example, they talk about Northern opposition to emancipation and reasons for such opposition. It paints a bit of a darker version of the North than Vol 1 (probably more accurate). My favorite DVD was the one covering the individual lives of solders (DVD 3) since it presented an aspect of the war not usually seen such as food, holidays and pets soldiers had. The Iron Clad DVD also presented some interesting material such as the capture of CSA ports, but there isn't too much detail on this.

Summary I would only recommend the 2nd DVD.",1325030400,5,2267,4.535626535626536
