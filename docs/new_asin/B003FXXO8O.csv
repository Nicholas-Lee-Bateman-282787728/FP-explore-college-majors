4120672,5,B003FXXO8O,"What truly makes this DVD special is the very unique blend of the contemporary/pop music quartet members Clifton Murray and Fraser Walters with the more dramatic and formal classical sounds of Victor Micallef and Remigio Pereira.  Within the DVD are songs that will appeal to both styles with individual solos and full quartet arrangements that are exceptionally well written, presented and sure to enlighten your ears.

David Foster makes a guest appearance (well known producer linked to current artists Andrea Bocelli, Josh Groban, Celine Dion, Michael Bubl and Cherise Pempengco).  This brilliant work is one DVD you will truly enjoy.",1276387200,66,638,5.36

The only complaint about the CD was the female also singing ""Amazing Grace""  The men have such terrific voices, having the female join in was more of a negative not a positive.

I had heard that ""The Canadian Tenors: Live At The Royal Conservatory of Music Toronto"" was really great so I ordered that.  There was very little, if any, songs done in English.  I realize they are from Canada, but if they want their work to sell well in America, they need to sing in English.  It was very much a disappointment as I only speak English.  I have herd them on Public Broadcasting and their included songs in English.  The female voice was a negative not a positive addition to their collection of songs.",1365897600,2,891,4.261904761904762

I saw the ""Lead With Your Heart"" show they did on PBS in December and that is(when I became aware of them)the one I wanted. I guess that one was not available yet to purchase. It was very nice of Valerie to want to please grandma though, and I appreciated it. PBS was offering it to viewers for $150-$200 but I could not afford that.",1357430400,,443,4.223529411764706

4120808,3,B003FXXO8O,"I love this group and purchased this DVD with great anticipation.  Sadly, the recording is (almost) ruined by the poor quality of the audio mixing.  Some songs are mixed correctly, but on too many the instruments significantly overpower their voices.  I keep wanting to reach forward to a mixing board and turn up the sliders for the voice channels.  There also could be more surround sound content.

The concert itself is well-done and features many of their signature songs.  It may have sounded much better in person.  I am still glad I bought this disc and listen to it with some regularity, but I would never use it to demo my music system due to the poorly done music/instrument mixing/recording on several of the songs.  I hope they record another concert and hire a different sound technician next time.",1339286400,12,811,4.784172661870503

4120811,5,B003FXXO8O,"This is absolutely fabulous.  These fellows are so very talented, each with a different type of voice.  Thus far, in my opinion, Celine Dion, Josh Groban, and now the Canadian Tenors have the voices of angels!",1322438400,,209,4.777777777777778

4120815,5,B003FXXO8O,"I purchased this as a gift for my wife and she absolutely loves it. The music is wonderful and the performance brings her back frequently. I am not sure I could have done better selecting a gift for her. The Canadian tenors are quite talented and seem to work very well together. I partially bought this based on the prior reviews (at that time there were 20, 5-star ratings) and they were all right on target. She keeps it near the TV/DVD player just so it is easy to access so she can watch again and again.",1294790400,2,509,4.257731958762887

4120817,5,B003FXXO8O,"These artists have amazing talent.  I lost my daughter, age 43, to cancer about 18 months ago.  I have to admit I had pretty much lost my ""faith"" and was extremely angry that God would take her.  With much support from minister and friends I tried to heal.

When I heard these amazing tenors (thanks to my niece who sent me the DVD) I noticed a line in the song ""Home I'll Be"" which states ""Never let the hard times take away your soul"", and I thought about that A LOT.  Of course the song ""Always There"" provided further thought and, thus, further healing, because it explains situations where we are ""down"" and You are always there.

I now have renewed hope for return to normalcy a lot in part to these fantastic singers.  (I am so glad they enunciate so we can understand their words.)  Four entirely different types of voices, but they blend so well.  Hope there will be more DVDs to come.",1291334400,47,894,4.36969696969697
4120818,5,B003FXXO8O,"I went to see the Canadian Tenors in concert in Oct. 2010 in Los Angeles, CA at Club Nokia. I loved every second of their concert!! I loved it so much that when a women who was sitting next to me in the concert told me about a concert they have on video, I knew I couldn't wait to get my hands on it! I watched it for the first time last week and it was just as good as being at a live concert! If you like the Canadian Tenors, you won't be disappointed!!!Next on my list is their new Christmas Album that just came out in Nov. 2010.",1290816000,,533,3.8545454545454545
4120819,5,B003FXXO8O,"This concert is AMAZING on so many levels:

1) The voices! Just gorgeous voices. Each has a solo song, and the group sings the rest. MANY cold chills during their performances. This group is really great at being loud and voluminous when needed, and soft and emotive when needed. In my opinion, this differentiates them from Il Divo, who in my opinion have similar vocal talent but they don't emote as well and songs often come across as simply bombastic. This is not the case with the Canadian Tenors!
2) The Musicianship! Great band and orchestra! I really loved the songs with the accoustic guitar.
3) Variety of song selection! Such a great selection of songs. The Canadian folk song was one of my favorites. Songs in Italian, French (I love BELLE), Spanish, English, etc.
4) We get to see the fun personalities of the singers. They are comfortable on stage and present themselves with a humility that is refreshing. They are both professional and personable.

The DVD, however, is not perfect. During some songs, the sound seems a bit muffled, as if the microphones needed to be turned up or the orchestra needed to play softer. This is not a big enough problem to subtract a star from my rating. This is a 5-star group and performance!",1290470400,15,1241,4.6880733944954125
