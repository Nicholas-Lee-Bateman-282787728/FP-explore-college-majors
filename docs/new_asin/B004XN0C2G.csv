8447226,1,B004XN0C2G,"I was super disappointed with this DVD.  I have several others from Petra Kobler, and like those ones.  But she blew it here.  The moves are super complicated and she does not teach or break them down at all.  She simply does a rapid demonstration, and then says with a smile, that now you can do it, too.  Not!  I will either donate this to Goodwill, which means someone will get stuck with it, or probably I should just throw it out.  Anyway, there are lots of good step workouts available, this isn't one of them.",1466467200,,516,4.3125
8447227,4,B004XN0C2G,"Petra is one of my most favorite instructors and I am a big fan of her step workouts, but I CANNOT follow this one!  I'm an advanced level stepper, and her cuing here is just not enough to instruct me through some of these combinations.  I've tried this video a few times, last time I tripped off of my step several times, and almost fell off the step, which NEVER happens to me.  I'll keep trying because it looks like so much fun, but a warning to the beginners, start slowly with this one, it's tricky!",1426291200,,505,4.239583333333333

8447229,1,B004XN0C2G,"I usually love Petra and work out daily; but there was poor actual instruction this workout.  Perhaps owners of previous of her step dvds will find this easy and fun, neither applied to me.  Give away pile!",1407283200,,206,4.54054054054054
8447230,1,B004XN0C2G,"This DVD definitely fell short of what I was hoping for.  I found it very difficult to understand her, which made following her cues complicated.  I watched it one time through and then decided to try it.  After about 15 minutes I gave up.  This will be one for the ""give-away"" pile.",1350432000,2,283,4.384615384615385
8447231,5,B004XN0C2G,"Petra is my favorite Step Aerobics instructor, so it was a bittersweet moment when her ""Last Step"" video was announced. I was thrilled to have another step workout with her, but sad that this will be the last one.  I guess the era has to end sometime.  Petra is lovely as usual, and it was nice to see Giusy Mele-Brown in the cast as well. The workout itself is about 59 minutes long, with a 5-minute cool down. Almost all of Petra's standard moves are here (what, no Grapevine?!?), including a few from VHS workouts of the past.  Some may feel that this routine can be complicated, but Petra always gives a basic move to start with before you're ready to move on to a harder combination.  I did not master the routine the first time out, and I'm glad I have something to work toward.  None of the moves are ridiculously hard-- it just will take some practice to get the footwork.  And that's fine with me. I've always been able to master Petra's routines, and I enjoy the learning process. This DVD was fun, I definitely got in a good, sweaty workout, and I recommend it to intermediate step exercisers. This was a worthy way to cap off Petra's step legacy!",1325462400,6,1158,4.413145539906103
8447232,4,B004XN0C2G,"This step routine has interesting choreography and fun music. Petra's cueing is good and after a couple of tries it can be mastered. The problem I have is that athletically, it's not challenging. In-between each combo there are too many hamstrings, side kicks and knee repeaters as fillers where I have to do jumping jacks, high knees, or plyo jumps to keep going. I also used 3 risers on each side to increase intensity. I like the routine and it's a lot of fun, but I don't get the workout I want. If you like steady state cardio and more complex choreography, this one is for you.",1311465600,8,583,4.457943925233645
