I always go to the What's New section to get updated on what Cakewalk has done with Sonar. I also like the way these people provide new examples with their tutorials.  Even though by now I am an experienced Sonar user I still learn a lot from the course because of these examples.  I also like the way they continue to show what's important to a musician, and don't get bogged down with a lot of trivia that is mainly for tweakheads.",1167696000,3,533,4.363636363636363
8325284,2,B000K2O9E6,"I usually love dvd tutorials, but this one is very short and not very helpful.  It teaches you how to do basics, which is good if you are a beginner, but if you're a Sonar user and want to know what's NEW in sonar 6 his is not going to help much.  You're better off buying the book, or just searching around on the 900+ page PDF manual that's in the documentation folder.  I know reading isn't as fun as watching a video, but this doesn't teach you much, even for the basics.  It's more like a Sonar 6 demo (just showing you around but no details!!!).  When I got Sonar 6 I couldn't wait for a dvd tutorial; I jumped on this as soon as it came out and was very disappointed.  This is definately not worth the money, trust me!",1165881600,10,725,4.070422535211268
