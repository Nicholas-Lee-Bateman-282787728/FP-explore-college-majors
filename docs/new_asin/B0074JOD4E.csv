5054834,5,B0074JOD4E,I can't believe I'm only discovering Donald Glover. I watched this special 3 times in 2 days and laughed my butt off every time. My only complaint about this video is that it's over waaay too soon. His jokes are more like personal stories you're hearing from your funniest friend. This guy is just so damn likeable. Watch this!,1331164800,8,327,4.559322033898305

the extras were better.",1415923200,,55,5.222222222222222
5054841,5,B0074JOD4E,"This product came in very protective packaging and is a pleasure to watch. It is a very visually clear DVD with crystal clear sound as well. The casing was in no way bruised from the shipping and handling process, despite being shipped to me in a protective envelope, which I was skeptical about because everything encasing the DVD is relatively fragile. The opening and closing snaps on the case function perfectly, as any DVD encasing should. It was also an enjoyable DVD to watch. In my opinion, even those who aren't very aware of Donald Glover's talents would find this to be a funny spectacle. It was a pleasure to review this product.",1414627200,,641,4.68141592920354
5054842,5,B0074JOD4E,Donald Glover is most Definitely worth watching! I can't even begin to describe his comedic genius. It's a MUST WATCH to really laugh your butt off!!!,1411603200,,150,4.8076923076923075

5054845,1,B0074JOD4E,"Very inappropriate! Disappointed, Funny, but not the same as his other stuff. Make sure you are age 30 or older.",1403049600,2,112,4.65
5054846,5,B0074JOD4E,"As he announces in the opening, it's nothing like his character Troy in Community (in which he is also awesome).  He's got a lot more to him than just that, and this showcases another facet of his talent.",1400976000,,204,4.368421052631579
5054847,5,B0074JOD4E,"I love standup and Donald.  He is very successful because he is talented and works very hard.  If you even remotely like the guy, watch this.",1396915200,,141,4.384615384615385

5054849,5,B0074JOD4E,"I am a longtime hardcore fan of Donald Glover, both his acting, writing, comedy, and especially his music as Childish Gambino. This DVD is hilarious, his act is plain awesome and if you like some clever humor from a very clever and successful guy, you will love his stand up.

As much as a ""WEIRDO"" as he may be, he's a good kind of weird. Highly recommend.",1392508800,2,357,4.3283582089552235
5054850,5,B0074JOD4E,Really funny comedy special. His humor isn't like is character on Community. Glad to see his range as a performer. Hope there is a second one soon.,1390521600,,147,4.481481481481482

5054852,5,B0074JOD4E,"I have been both performing and watching stand-up for a few years now. This guy is borderline the best in my opinion.
Only negative thing I have EVER heard about it was """"he says ""like"" too much""""
I didn't notice and I laughed my ass off.
BUY IT",1388102400,,245,4.125
5054853,5,B0074JOD4E,"I wasn't familiar with Donald Glover but his stand up is charming and hilarious, even the parts about poop and hand jobs.",1388016000,,121,4.545454545454546
5054855,5,B0074JOD4E,"Donald Glover is an amazing rapper and comedian. He started of his career doing stand up, and then went on to rapping. Weirdo is a really funny comedy, and will have you laughing the whole time.",1386547200,,194,4.416666666666667
5054856,5,B0074JOD4E,"Love Donald Glover on the show community, love his rap music, and so I decided to give his stand up a shot. Guess what? Loved it.",1376784000,,129,4.0
5054857,5,B0074JOD4E,"I watched this when I had cable a while ago and bought it so that I could share it with a new friend.  He loved it, I loved it... Everyone was happy.  I'll be sharing with anyone else I meet that enjoys a very talented and funny young man- and will share it with those without a sense of humor as well.",1371168000,,302,3.8548387096774195

5054860,5,B0074JOD4E,"I totally recommend this comedy special, but it is definitely intended for adults. Donald Glover seems to be creating a constant stream of high-quality comedy right now.",1362700800,,169,5.296296296296297

5054862,5,B0074JOD4E,Donald Glover is funny. I'm not sure that you can ask for much for out of a stand up special..,1359590400,,94,3.75
5054863,4,B0074JOD4E,"If you enjoy community, but always wanted it to get darker and weirder than this is for you. But, if you're not in to sometimes creepy sometimes profane, than it might be worth skipping.
Personally, I enjoyed it thoroughly.",1358899200,,223,4.743589743589744
5054864,5,B0074JOD4E,I got this for my sister for christmas because she loves Donald Glover and the show he is on called Community. I've never seen any of his standups so we watched it together and it was funny. I enjoyed it,1358812800,,203,4.1
5054865,5,B0074JOD4E,"I bought this because I am a huge fan of Donald Glover. I discovered him a few years back when I stumbled upon his ""derrickcomedy"" sketch youtube channel. Then later found out he raps as well. After watching his other comedy special I knew I had to get me a hardcopy so that I may watch it over and over again. Great special features too, that include an interview.",1358380800,,365,4.304347826086956

5054868,5,B0074JOD4E,"I really like Donald's character on Community which is why I ordered the DVD. His stand up is quite a bit different than that character which was awesome! I knew he was going to be good, but I didn't think he was going to be great! I've watched it maybe ten times now.",1356480000,,268,4.0754716981132075
5054869,5,B0074JOD4E,"I didn't think this would be that funny, cause I saw his Comedy Central Presents, and thought he was only ok. This was WAY better than that. By a long shot! The first few minutes were funny, but the rest was hilarious! I guess I'm a WEIRDO for saying this, but his facial expressions during some of the jokes were extra hilarious! I can't really explain it, but I did a lot of ""talking"" with my facial expressions a while ago, so I definitely noticed that. I loved this!

4.5/5",1351296000,,477,4.3
5054870,5,B0074JOD4E,"this guy is seriously funny. Very different humor/stand-up from most black comics. This guy might just be the funniest, smartest stand-up comedian out there",1347148800,,156,5.541666666666667
5054871,5,B0074JOD4E,"Donald Glover is hands down my favorite comedian! It's very easy to relate to his jokes or just laugh regardless because he presents them so well! Yes this is ""Troy"" but no this is not the same ""safe"" comedy so be ready lol",1343779200,,223,4.209302325581396
5054872,5,B0074JOD4E,"What I knew before I watched this video; Glover is virtually impossible not to like; his inherent charisma is something which I don't think that you can learn, you either have it or you don't. He is a talented writer, as his writing on ""30 Rock"" shows. He is extremely talented across a wide range of media; he seems adept at comedic acting, which is very difficult to pull off, from what I'd seen from Community, he has great comedic timing. He is also a rapper and while rap typically isn't my choice in music, I find that those who are very good at it cross over. Glover is a modern day renaissance man.
Stand-up is a world apart, there are no retakes, you have to be on....he certainly met and even exceeded my expectations. Certainly splitting from his ""Troy Barnes"" persona, he offers a completely different, but no less (and sometimes more) enjoyable and side-splitting performance.
I can recommend this without reservation, although one caveat should be included and that is don't expect the character you see on ""Community"".  Furthermore, I can't wait to see what this young man does in the future.  I see no indication that the ceiling to his talent is even in view and can't wait to see what some time and growth will yield.  However, even if his talents have gone as far as they will, he is still one of the most talented entertainers of his and many other generation.",1336176000,,1380,4.578947368421052
