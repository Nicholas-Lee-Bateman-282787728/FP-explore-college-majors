8069212,5,B0009X57Y2,"LASER MOON - The police detectives in Laser Moon have racked their brains and expended nearly all of their resources to snare a woman- hating killer. So far, they have discovered only four attributes of their quarry: he is male, preys on sexy women, strikes only during full moons, and uses a laser beam to murder his victims. As the cops brainstorm over how to capture him, the killer makes his presence known to them... broadcasting his murderous plans during a late-night radio program. The investigators finally decide they have no choice except to dangle before the culprit a beautiful rookie cop (former porn star Traci Lords).

2. NIGHT CALLER - One of Fred Williamson's more unusual efforts as both actor and director, this one features the action star as a cigar-smoking detective named Mac Derringer. He is enlisted by his ex-wife (Vanity), a phone-sex operator, to catch the masked psychopath who murdered her co-worker. With the aid of partner Gary Busey and friend Peter Fonda, Derringer closes in on the maniac, but is soon framed for murder. Williamson has an interracial love scene, there's a stoolie who raps, and a subplot involves blackmail and pornography. The Jeffersons' Isabel Sanford appears as Derringer's mother, and the familiar genre cast features Stella Stevens, Robert Forster, and Henry Silva.",1189036800,,1324,5.1013824884792625
