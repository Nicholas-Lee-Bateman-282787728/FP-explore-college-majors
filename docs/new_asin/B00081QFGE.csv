The technology along with the romance that comes with trains, is all captured in this DVD. Excellent footage, captured by vintage cameras, captured on one DVD.

If you love vintage trains, this one is for you.

I enjoyed it thoroughly!",1297123200,,396,4.984848484848484
8159725,1,B00081QFGE,"I ordered this for my 83 year old father (who is a train fanatic) basing my decision to order on Amazon's description of the video.  Absolutely a WRONG decision.  It doesn't even come close to being anything remotely close to what I was hoping for.  TOTAL WASTE of $25.  Stay far, far away from this video.",1272499200,,306,4.410714285714286
8159726,5,B00081QFGE,"Vintage train footage is one of the geekier things I am into, but I know that I am not alone, so I want to reccomend this disk to other people like me who are fascinated by older trains. These films all center around the Southern Pacific Railroad (which mirrored Lewis and Clark's journey accross the land) and include a lot of scenic vistas that are well shot. The best film is the one that gives the history of the railroad with more detail than I've seen on similar films about the same topic.",1148342400,,496,4.344086021505376
