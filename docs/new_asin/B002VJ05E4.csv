3996085,1,B002VJ05E4,"Attention: This is a revieiw for the package, no the show.

I've been a fan of beverly hills since the beginning and since the show started to make its way to the dvd sets, I was delighted.

I had trouble accepting the horrible songs they've replaced the original soundtrack with, but I got used to. But now, I look at my dvd collection and I see huge sets for the first 8 seaons along with the individual cases per 2 discs, and I compare them to the 9th season, and I think, c'mon!

They have replaced the package for one that's half the size with horrible inserts for the discs. The summary for the episodes is written in a font size almost impossible to read. No to mention that you have to remove the first and last disc in order to read it!

It's a relieve that we have only one set to go to complete the collection ('m counting on CBS to put the reunion as a feature on the last set,ey miracles can happen).

Thanks for reading.",1268438400,17,934,4.195530726256983
3996086,5,B002VJ05E4,"No matter how silly this show gets I just still love it.  I can't get enough of these shows.  Great season, Brandon leaves which made me sad, Valerie, and Dylan comes back.  Along with Venessa Martel as Gina...New drama new characters great show.  Disappointed that the last episode only the 44 minutes long, I really enjoy a long finale.",1268179200,2,338,4.677966101694915
3996087,4,B002VJ05E4,"I got this product some days ago since I am collecting these box sets. This is a good season but not the best since the show starts to decay on season 8, seems that some episodes may turn boring. But still a good seasion to watch",1267660800,,229,4.0

3996096,4,B002VJ05E4,"I love having this season to go along with my others.  One of my favorite things about this one is that Valerie leaves (FINALLY!) and Gina comes in.  It's silly drama, I know, but I loved this show when I was younger, and I still love it.  The reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is, of course, CBS's fault.  They really butchered the whole series for the DVD releases.  I'm hoping that one day the complete version, the originally aired version, will somehow find it's way onto the market...",1491436800,,494,4.326086956521739

3996100,5,B002VJ05E4,"Sick of hearing that the music is dubbed over with different music. No they are NOT! I purchased every season so far and everything has been the same on my end! Bands are all also the same, special guests are the same! Know how to give reviews before leaving them or better yet. Get a life!",1471824000,,290,4.196428571428571

8382049,5,B002VJ05E4,"I love this show. Very cheasy and over the top with drama at times, but it reminds me of when I was younger because I used to watch it growing up. Highly recommend to anyone who likes shows like The OC or Melrose Place",1504828800,,218,3.977272727272727

You must keep watching....",1501545600,,74,4.769230769230769
8382051,3,B002VJ05E4,"I really enjoyed season 8, but this season is reminding me more of season 7, which I did not much care for.  They honestly devote more buildup and attention to saying goodbye to Kelly's grandpa than they do to saying goodbye to Brandon or Valerie.  There is simply far too much attention being given to characters that are not essential to the show.  It is great to have Luke Perry back and his heroin addiction is a highlight of the season.  That being said, Jason Priestley's absence is strongly felt.  I also just can't get into Gina's character they way I did with Brenda or Valerie.  The magic just isn't there, but of course I watch every episode because even mediocre times with old friends is better than anything else on TV.",1493596800,,733,4.515151515151516
