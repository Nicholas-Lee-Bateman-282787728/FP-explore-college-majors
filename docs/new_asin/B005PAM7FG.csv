4856587,5,B005PAM7FG,"This video offers a complete, accessible workout program that tones and stretches without causing discomfort at any point. It's not broken down by trimester, but Annette offers gradations of difficulty for many of the exercises. I've already done it twice in one week, and can see myself returning to it throughout pregnancy and afterward.

After all the introductions (easily skippable), the main program consists of:

Warm Up
Full Body Movements
Standing Exercises
Deep Stretches

No times are given for these segments either on the box or on the menu, which I would have liked so I could time my workout. However, the entire workout is about an hour long.

The moves are basically pilates with a bit of yoga thrown in. The only props are two yoga blankets that Annette folds in various positions to support the poses. Nothing is particularly taxing -- only in a few of the lying leg exercises are you likely to feel any kind of burn, and warrior poses are held long enough to strengthen but not to the point of exhaustion. The program is great for stretching your entire body while also working on some strength, but moderately enough that you don't really notice. (I could tell that my endurance had improved by the second use of the video however!)

What I really liked:

- Annette is clear and not annoyingly peppy.
- A number of the positions combine stretching with gentle movement, which really helped me to relax.
- Time is spent on the neck and shoulders -- you wouldn't think these get particularly tense during pregnancy, but they do.
- Some unusual positions or combinations of positions.
- Generally good cueing. For example, there is one adjustment she has you do during a forward lunge that is simply perfect for getting the right stretch.
- An exercise for working on Kegel muscles that is about as clear as such exercises get, considering that it can't really be viewed on a DVD!

What I didn't like:

- I know it's more pilates than yoga, but I missed having a relaxation segment at the end. Then again, it was easy to just turn the computer off and do my own.
- There are a few moments where Annette gives safety cues for knees (""if your knees are uncomfortable, do this"") while the exercise is underway. These guidelines should be introduced right at the start.

Disclosure: I received a review copy of this video from World Dance New York. Given the quality of the DVD, I would have been happy if I had bought it too.",1322352000,,2440,4.642691415313225
8482423,3,B005PAM7FG,"I wasn't really impressed with it. The instructors personality and way of talking probably wouldn't bother most people, but I found her to be rather droning and annoying. I also had purchased 10 Minute Solution: Prenatal Pilates dvd at the same time and I REALLY liked that one and used it during my last pregnancy.",1511654400,,315,4.745454545454545
8482424,5,B005PAM7FG,"This was exactly what I was looking for!  During my 2nd trimester, I started having round ligament pain, ouch!  I really wanted something that would give me a little exercise, but mostly help me stretch and prepare me for labor.  I went to the library and brought home a pregnancy yoga DVD and it hurt, way too much twisting!  Then I bought this DVD and was sooooo happy, it felt so good and she explains things well and even using it every day for many days with all my hormones, she never got on my nerves :)  Thanks to this DVD and a belly belt, my round ligament pain went away and I was able to use this DVD all the way through the 3rd trimester.  Another plus I was looking for was all the pelvic floor exercises.  Not to give TMI, but I only had one stitch with my delivery and had a very quick recovery which I attribute it to this DVD.

The only downside for me is it's not broken up very well.  There's a warm up and cool down and then standing and floor exercises, but who has the time or energy for 80 minutes?!  Every day I did the warm up and would either do the standing or split the floor routine into two and always did the cool-down.

This gave me about 35/45 minutes per day always including the pelvic floor routine, stretching and a little exercise.  My only other problem with this DVD is I gave it to my pregnant friend and now I am pregnant again and have to order another one, a good problem to have :)",1460073600,2,1427,4.130434782608695
8482425,5,B005PAM7FG,This DVD drastically helps with my back pain during pregnancy. And now it's easier to bend down to pick things up!!,1459296000,2,115,4.523809523809524
8482426,5,B005PAM7FG,"This video is very helpful and has been for the last 4 months.  I'm 7 months now. At 3 months along I thought it was easy, but not anymore!  Each time I do the stretches led in this video,  I feel better. Highly recommend.",1432512000,,222,4.0
8482427,2,B005PAM7FG,"It could just be the online version, but it needs to have options where you can 1) listen to her the first time go in to incredible length of why this particular move is helpful and then 2) repeat sessions where it just gets down to the exercise. I really don't have hours to listen to her talk. I have a little one who is on a short nap and this just doesn't fit in.",1427155200,,367,3.9066666666666667
8482428,3,B005PAM7FG,"i'm pretty out of shape, and haven't been doing any workouts since i got pregnant (tho i used to be a runner) and i found this video pretty hard.  i hate yoga, b/c i'm extremely inflexible and therefore find it frustrating, and there was more yoga in here than i expected.  of course i just had to modify and do what i can - which is better than nothing at this point, but i did find it frustrating that i couldn't keep up.  i was hoping for more of a gentle stretching/getting ready for delivery only type video, not a work out. (third trimester).",1416182400,2,548,4.25
8482429,2,B005PAM7FG,I really enjoy the stretches on this video.  I would give this video five stars easy if Annette addressed the medical concerns of laying flat on your back while pregnant. The general medical advice I have received tells you not to lay flat on your back.  I am not sure if the exercises in this video are some type of modification that is appropriate for women in any stage of their pregnancy... and I truly wish that I could find some type of clarification that these exercises are safe!,1394668800,2,487,4.46067415730337
8482430,5,B005PAM7FG,"I can't tell you how much I have enjoyed this video!  I have been exercising throughout my pregnancy, but mostly more intense, higher impact pregnancy workout videos.  Here in my mid to late 3rd trimester I have become so much more tired and achy and have not felt up to doing those higher impact workouts.  This workout is the answer!!!  It is enough of a challenge to help me get a workout and ease my aches while still being relaxing and energizing!  I don't have to have a ton of energy to be motivated to do the video, but I always end up doing more than 1 segment because it really does make me feel so much better!  It also helps me sleep better at night!  I love the 3 different segments! I am thankful I found this video, or I might have quit exercising all together at this late point in my pregnancy!  I love how I feel after I do this workout!",1381795200,2,855,4.170731707317073
8482431,5,B005PAM7FG,"This is my 4th pregnancy and I wish I would have found this DVD sooner!  I have had or borrowed different DVDs for each of my pregnancies, and this is by far my favorite - which I have to admit surprised me since it was done by the least known instructor - at least to me.  It has a rather slow pace and is low impact, but is still challenging enough to make my muscles burn by the end of the different exercises.  There are a few different segments, the main ones being: Floor Exercises, Standing Exercises, and Deep Stretching.  They are not all the same length, the first being about as long as the last two combined (the last two are a few minutes off in length from each other).  At first I wasn't sure if I liked that, but after owning it for a while I like the fact that I can pick what section(s) I want to make the work out as long and hard as I feel up to.  I am in my second trimester, but because it is my 4th I am bigger than most pregnant women at this stage and I think that I should be able to continue this DVD well into my third trimester.

Things I Like:
- I can pick a segment/time amount that suits how I feel that day.
- There is a good mix of old and new moves.
- She is very informative without being too talkative - I've even learned that I was doing some of the old moves wrong!
- There is a realistic pace.  I can get my pillow and get down to the floor without hurrying to catch up or waiting for her to tell me what to do.
- I can feel a burn, but because of the stretching don't get sore later.
- It's not so intense that I feel exhausted when I'm done (meaning I'll be willing to do it more often because I don't dread it).
- I don't need any special equipment to use the DVD - just a couple blankets, pillows, or even towels work.

Things I Don't Like:
- The set is (in my opinion) ugly.  An empty warehouse with strange colors for lighting... rather vain, but I did notice....
- One of the standing exercises has you swaying around like kelp in the ocean - I actually think it feels really good, but I'm always thinking about how stupid I look while I'm doing it, and hope that no one sees me - ha!

So, you can see the negatives are pretty minor.  The bottom line is, this is a great DVD, and I would recommend it to any and all pregnant women.",1376265600,3,2278,3.9606126914660833
8482432,5,B005PAM7FG,"Pregnant women no longer sit in a rocking chair and crochet booties for nine months!
Staying fit during pregnancy is ideal and common now, and the benefits of exercise may alleviate discomforts associated with the condition. This program is designed for every trimester of pregnancy and the stretches promote ease in labor and faster post partum recovery. If you are not physically fit the program can be used in sections to begin building strength if your physician advices.

The program begins with an extensive welcome section full of information on the changes in preparation for the events associated with pregnancy. Some of those mentioned are the changes in spinal curvatures as the body weight increases forward. Some recommendations are exercises to relieve tension in chest and shoulders and upper mid back muscles. The floor/mat exercises target lower body muscles, hips, feet, and of utmost importance strengthening the pelvic floor muscles which carry most of the weight of the baby.
Not much is required to get started. Simple items you will need are just two blankets and a yoga mat.

To begin: A very relaxing gentle seated warm-up with the deep breathing;this is wonderful relaxation and in addition oxygenates the blood for mom and baby. Upper body stretches, gentle twists, gentle neck stretches, and foot exercises are a treat especially after a long day at work!

Three very thorough sections follow, (listed by the above reviewer), and these are demonstrated carefully, as Annette herself is pregnant and talks through every position and use of props, (blankets). Whether on your back for gentle contractions and release of the abdomen, (such as bridge pose in yoga),frightened cat and cow, or  strengthening upper body with arm circles, shoulder rolls, there allotted time to change position.

 A standing series such as yoga warrior series, lunges, and side stretches. The total time for this program is 80 minutes and it much similar to a gentle yoga for pregnancy with a pilates blend.",1324080000,,2011,5.153374233128834
