5045986,5,B00705R3QC,"Hello there,
I used my 24 hour access and watched a good bit of the material and was not only impressed, but moved and inspired(and told Mr. Harlan as much in a Facebook message). I have no intention of returning my dvd....unless there is some kind of physical defect!
I admire the degree of love,care, and hard work that was put into this production; the set and the lighting are pleasing to the eye and the sound is, of course, killing!
And...I play electric bass, but found every bit of this dvd relevant. Looking forward to getting Lincoln Goines dvd when it comes out,too...
Thanks for a stellar product!!!!!
Sincerely, with gratitude,
Mark",1327536000,,645,4.716814159292035
5045987,5,B00705R3QC,"Eric is one of the baddest players out there, and so young!  This dvd is great because he really breaks down his playing, concepts, and outlook.  It is rare to find musicians that are actually articulate with words!  He is also a spiritual, carefree, beautiful human.  So while this dvd offers meticulous technical concepts specific to drum set, it also offers a great philosophical outlook on music.",1327276800,,400,4.925373134328358
5045988,5,B00705R3QC,"As soon as this DVD released, I ordered it.
Eric Harland and people from JazzHeaven did a great job!
I'm thankful for that, because Eric Harland is my longtime
musical joy and inspiration. His playing with Charles Lloyd,
SF Jazz Collective, Aaron Parks, Aaron Goldberg ... is just beautiful.
So what can say more?! Go for it, it is a great DVD for any musician
because it is about m u s i c first.",1327276800,2,397,4.306666666666667
5045989,5,B00705R3QC,"Short version: great drumming by a great drummer, inspiring teaching, great band performances, great filming (incl. add. camera for feet), fantastic sound, achieving the highest standard in educational DVD.

Detailed: as far as I can tell from my own humble experience as a drummer, musician and teacher, you indeed find what makes ""The Yin & Yang Of Jazz Drumming"" here. Not only that Eric Harland is one of the most inspiring characters of the international Jazz drumming community today - interesting enough to watch and to listen to anyway: but after spending a weekend following this inspiring document I find, this DVD is special for several reasons. You can tell it is produced by an understanding person with profound drum background - guided by a love and passion for the subject, having a sincere concern.

Eric Harland's master class provides a comprehensive insight into (Jazz) drumming, and offers a real image of how to become a vital element of an improvising ensemble. The mp3s to play along reflect the realistic impression of a playing situation, and have the capacity to inspire you to pick up the phone and call your friends for a session : )

From the ""drumming perspective"" this DVD is a valuable guide about what matters in Jazz drumming such as the art of listening, practicing, playing in time and out of time, playing on form and free, the math aspect of rhythm, different feelings, finding your own philosophy / conception (if you need any ...),  developing technique as well as facing personal difficulties. Needles to mention all other little details to discover having the opportunity to watch a great drummer play at close range.

Throughout Harland's entire performance there is a glimpse of sincere interest in not only sharing knowledge about music, but in paying tribute to the mystery of creation Itself.

Despite to all the impressive musicianship and drumming he makes the considerate listener understand, that there is no other magic formula to understand in music but ""walk the path"", and enjoy the journey. In a nutshell: Eric Harland's style of teaching is inspiring, encouraging and has the flair to match.

The additional interview done by Falk Willis - whom I remember being an awesome drummer himself is interesting for several reasons - check it out.  He is doing a great job in creating a comfortable, patient atmosphere, bringing up new topics only where necessary, and basically focusing on the artist to speak out.

Result: this DVD is worth buying it - I already ordered another JazzHeaven DVD.",1327190400,,2546,5.0
5045990,5,B00705R3QC,"A awesome DVD
As soon as this DVD released, I ordered it.
I'm much more satisfied than I expected.

Eric shows not only his phrases but also mental things; his philosophy, musicality,
mental attitude for making creative sound, and so on.
I think that it's the best ever.",1327104000,,270,4.625
5045991,5,B00705R3QC,"Jazz Heaven is a new website that, among other things, offers instructional videos for jazz muscians including Eric Harland's
""The Yin & Yang of Jazz Drumming"".  I recently discovered Eric on Youtube and hope to hear him live in the near future.  Meanwhile, I purchased the video as soon as it came available, and have already watched it three times. However, I haven't downloaded the charts yet.

I think Eric is a wondrful teacher and philosopher.  His emphasis in this video is on timekeeping, interacting with the other muscians, and drumming musicality.  His demonstrations make for great listening and effective instruction.  One interesting aspect of his kit is that I believe he uses a second snare as his high tom.",1327104000,,723,4.983333333333333
8507572,5,B00705R3QC,absolutely a good buy... eric is one of the new greats in jazz drumming. his style here is easy going and very informative. i am watching regularly and picking up new information each time. love it..,1444608000,,199,4.555555555555555
8507573,5,B00705R3QC,Another excellent video from JazzHeaven they never disappoint.  I'm not a drummer but wanted to understand more about time and feel from a drummer's point of view and Eric's playing and explanations gave be exactly what I was looking for.,1434412800,,238,4.95

8507575,5,B00705R3QC,"When I first heard about Jazzheaven, I did because of Eric Harland. I checked the trailers for his instructional video and I had to buy it, so I did.

In about a week and a half, I had the DVD in my hands (Argentina), with amazing material from Eric, with great video/audio quality, and fortunately, they covered more than the usual technique and stuff, they covered the way Eric sees, feels and lives music. It's a MUST for any drummer/musician out there who is willing to learn from the best.

After all this, Ralph Peterson's contest arrived, and I decided to give it a try, I never won anything so I had nothing to lose. I got to win a CD from Ralph, but due to legal stuff I didn't read in the contest information, I couldn't receive the CD in Argentina. BUT, the amazing people behind JazzHeaven (in this case, Falk), were able to assist and help me in an incredible way.

So, basically, I cannot stress enough how good the material as well as their customer care service is, I will definitely get more dvds from them in the future.

Thanks again guys!",1402358400,,1058,4.410256410256411
8507576,5,B00705R3QC,I have been playing for years but found the clips extremely helpful. Would recommend this to other experienced drummers or new drummers that want to start off well.,1394409600,2,164,4.892857142857143
8507577,5,B00705R3QC,Great concepts and great playing! I loved the spiritual part.  An unique Dvd on jazz drumming with lots of concepts to keep you thinking about how to be more and more musical.,1392163200,,175,4.46875
8507578,5,B00705R3QC,I really enjoy Eric Harland's interpretation and philosophy on Jazz Drumming. He is very melodical in his approach and demonstrate his techniques in playing the drums by using melodic texture. It's like he plays the drums like a mallet instrument..like a marimba or vibes. He is very avangardish but you can still feel the Jazz swinging pulse. You can tell that he puts his personality into his playing. Very cerebral and inspiring. Great stuff!!!!,1351987200,,448,5.0675675675675675
8507579,5,B00705R3QC,"I purchased the first three available drum DVDs from Jazzheaven (Harland, Hoenig, Peterson). This is a niche market and these videos are really unique -- please support their work! This video feels almost like a ""drum hang"" -- Harland is likeable and the instruction is friendly and conversational. The playing is, of course, outstanding, and the quality production gives you a front-row seat to some sensitive work that might be difficult to pick up in another setting, with the added bonus that you can watch it repeatedly. As with the other Jazzheaven videos, the interview section is every bit as interesting as the demonstrations.",1343520000,,635,5.115384615384615
8507580,5,B00705R3QC,"Questo dvd ha le risposte che cercavo...  lo raccomando anche ai non batteristi!!! La scelta dei contenuti  proprio il punto di forza di questa masterclass, gli argomenti sono trattati in maniera analitica e profonda ma esposti con semplicit e chiarezza. Eric  fantastico come musicista e come insegnante.
Grazie ad Eric per aver messo il suo sapere a disposizione di tutti e a Falk per aver realizzato questo bellissimo progetto.",1329523200,,430,5.202898550724638
8507581,5,B00705R3QC,"Un excellent complment au dvd de Ralph Peterson.
En effet Eric Harland dveloppe des points particuliers de son jeu trs moderne(mesures impaires, polyrythmes, placement sur le temps, etc ...).
On assiste  de grands moments de musique, que se soit en solo ou en groupe.
La qualit de cette vido, du son, fait que c'est un des meilleurs produits disponibles actuellement dans cette catgorie !
Je suis fan !",1328140800,,402,4.911764705882353
