8202790,1,B000RWFCH2,I don't like it I hate it so much I thought about returning but keep it. I will not order another DVD.,1383436800,,102,3.6818181818181817
8202791,5,B000RWFCH2,"This is a good DVD to show you how to use the Knitting Board.  It's a new phase of knitting without needles.  You use a board with pegs, and you wrap yarn around the pegs by using different wrapping techniques.  Really cool, but if you are a regular knitter who uses needles, you might not enjoy this new hobby which has become a new fad.",1371686400,2,338,4.1692307692307695
8202792,2,B000RWFCH2,"I ordered this item as a Christmas gift.  It arrived in a bubble envelope with a hole in it.  Inside the envelope was the DVD that should have been in the paper CD evelope, but it wasn't, and that was half in and out of a folded over piece of cardboard.  I've seen this item in a yarn shop nicely packaged in a standard DVD case with labeling.  This had neither, only the disc.  Lots of other info regarding other items they sell that have nothing to do with what I bought. Would have been nice if time had been taken to make the item I bought nice to give as a gift than getting all the info I didn't need.  I'll be sending this back if they don't supply a DVD case for it.  Very Disappoint.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Weave-and-Hook-Knitting-Board-Basic-I-How-To-DVD-Instruction/dp/B000RWFCH2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Weave and Hook Knitting Board Basic I How-To DVD Instruction</a>",1288656000,21,928,5.1879194630872485
