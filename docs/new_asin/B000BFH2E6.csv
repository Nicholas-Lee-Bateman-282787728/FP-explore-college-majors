8085994,5,B000BFH2E6,"I rented this from netflix to use as a review with my fifth graders before the STAR science test.  The video is PERFECT!!!  I couldn't ask for anything more.  The music is fun, and what they are singing is even better.  It is exactly the standards that fifth graders need to know.  I do recommend waiting and showing this at the end of the year, right before the test once you have taught everything.  It might not make sense for the kids before the unit because it is all still unfamiliar.  I sat at the computer and paused several times throughout each song to review further.  My students are extremely bright with super high test scores, and we loved it, so I'm really not sure why the negative reviews from other teachers.",1272931200,,727,4.454545454545454
8085995,4,B000BFH2E6,"I was skeptical when I rented this as I read the previous rating and didn't know what to expect. I am VERY glad I didn't rely on a poor rating to sway me from trying it out. This video is GREAT!!! I am a 4th grade teacher AND a parent of a 5th grader who is about to take the CA State Science Test. I sat with my son and previewed it before handing it off to his teacher and my fellow teachers at school. This video has neat graphics and cool rock music. The music they've come up with is outstanding!! This video is not meant for older adults to enjoy -- this is a video made to attract the attention of 5th graders, so this is geared toward that age group. The tunes are catchy and they've come up with a different song for each section of the video. They DO repeat what they say, but what teacher only says things ONE TIME?!?! They don't over-repeat it, they merely say it a couple times to let it sink in. My son was laughing and saying that his friends would laugh at the movie for some of its silliness, but as I caught him unwittingly singing along, I knew that THAT would be the reason he would remember the information presented. There are 7 sections: Solar Trip, Its Our Weather, Water Cycle, Anatomy Blues, Its Matter That Matters, Photosynthesis, and Life Science (4th grade bonus video). All in all, this is a great video to follow up on what has already been taught.",1178236800,10,1380,4.231060606060606
8085996,5,B000BFH2E6,"The video was awesome!  We enjoyed the music, special effects, and the educational value of this product.  I highly recommend this video for 9 - 12 year old children.  We look forward to the production of more grade level content videos from this company.",1137542400,,255,4.75
8085997,5,B000BFH2E6,Rock-on videos will make great gifts for my nieces and nephews. The DVD shows creativity with many visual elements set to appropriate music. I look forward to future installments.,1134691200,,179,5.206896551724138
8085998,5,B000BFH2E6,"Being a teacher I found this DVD to be a great supplemental teaching tool to my students. Not only did they love it, they wanted me to keep playing it. It is awesome to play before a unit and then use it for review before the test. It follows the California State standards and I would recommend this educational DVD to 2nd-6th grade teachers. You'll love it and so will your students!!!!! 2 thumbs up!!",1133568000,3,403,4.386666666666667

This review speaks for itself from a highly reputable publication.

I believe this title to be very entertaining and a great basic review overall of each subject.

School Library Journal  10-20-05

Rock-On. DVD. color. 30 min. with lyrics. Prod. by Blue Sonic Prods. Dist. by 411 Video Information. 2005. $19.95.

Gr 4-6-Creatively designed to conform to California's Fifth Grade Science Content Standards, Rock-On is a wonderful combination of fun graphics and diagrams and memorable songs. Titles of the music videos include ""Solar Trip,"" ""It's Our Weather,"" ""Water Cycle,"" ""It's Matter That Matters,"" ""Photosynthesis,"" ""Anatomy Blues,"" and ""Life Science"" (billed as a fourth grade bonus video). Each segment is a straightforward lesson in the basics of the topic, and interesting enough to engage fourth to sixth graders as well as younger students. The tunes are catchy and the vocals are clear. Useful to introduce or review a science lesson, as a last minute refresher before a test, or just for fun. This title should be in every elementary and middle school collection.-Linda Fortino, Library Media Consultant, Fontana,WI",1133568000,,1184,5.372972972972973
