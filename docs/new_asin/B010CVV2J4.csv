8722060,5,B010CVV2J4,How will it end? I can't tell you but I will say Space Brothers has taken a piece of me that was missing and has helped me see some good in life so that's worth more than anything. Watch and experience this change. Don't feel discouraged either there are three more great collections after this one.,1489708800,,299,4.357142857142857
8722061,5,B010CVV2J4,"After 3 recap episodes, this set finishes up the survival training, covers the Comeback Competition (they build a rover!), and introduces some back story for a couple of characters. Hibito returns from the moon a little worse for wear from his adventure there...

This show still continues to enthrall and inspire me (not the recap episodes though). I really enjoyed Hibito's second arc, nearly as much as the first one. Mutta's storyline is still lots of fun to follow, but it is a fun change of pace every time the show switches to Hibito, and he tackles different issues than Mutta.

This set contains episodes 52-64 (14 episodes) out 99 total.",1447113600,,647,4.81981981981982
