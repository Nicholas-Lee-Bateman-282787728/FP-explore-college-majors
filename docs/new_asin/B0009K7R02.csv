2296997,5,B0009K7R02,"This was an excellent collection of a true classic.  Not only did this collection bring back wonderful childhood memories, but my children enjoyed watching it as well.  I am glad to have this collection in our family and trust that my children will enjoy it for years to come.",1169596800,2,276,4.612244897959184

2296999,5,B0009K7R02,"Everytime they had Kung Fu on TV I would wait for it and watch it. Now, I don't have to wait. Next would be to get Kung Fu The Movie and then maybe, the Kung Fu-The Legend Continues series.",1168300800,,189,3.871794871794872
2297000,5,B0009K7R02,I bought these for my husband. We both loved to watch the reruns of Kung Fu when we were youner and we still love watching them together. The quality is as good as I remember them to be. (not up to today's standards) but good enough. I imagine these were low budget productions originally. But I am very happy with this purchase.,1168300800,4,329,4.32258064516129
2297001,4,B0009K7R02,"The concept of the series is of a quiet humble man who avoids action at almost any cost... Caine (David Carradine) was taught a good soldier is not violent, a fighter is not angry, and a victor is not vengeful...

Caine runs a long way with a price on his head for murder... He comes to the American West where he travels the countryside facing many pillars of violence... He effectively inspires the character with infrequently found qualities for an action hero: grace and self-control, suppleness and rhythmic endurance, speed and patience, tenacity and power...

For several years in the Shaolin Temple, Caine learns to exercise and develop his inner strength... He learns to make powerful the force of his body... Yet he was taught to reverence all against whom he may use such force... He comes to know how weakness prevails over strength, how gentleness conquers, how he seeks victory in contention...

With an emphasis on Buddhist philosophy, ""Kung Fu"" is a morality play, a magic show, combining the Western genre with martial arts...",1167782400,11,1043,4.948571428571428

2297003,5,B0009K7R02,"I am just as inspired now as 40 years ago with this series. I am so happy to find it on DVD - clear, without commercials, able to freeze the spell-binding photography, able to go back over the lessons of pure poetry.  What a treat with the guest stars as well: a little Jodie Foster, Jos Feliciano, Leslie Nielsen and many others. This series is a beautiful necklace of precious gems.  If it seems trite or campy now, it is only because so many have borrowed from it, e.g. ""Expect the unexpected.""",1152316800,29,497,4.391304347826087

2297005,5,B0009K7R02,Great old TV series. The episodes' audio and video are all nice and clear. They appear to have benefited from a well done re-mastering.,1384819200,,135,4.666666666666667
2297006,5,B0009K7R02,"Filmed in the early seventies as a Western series, ""Kung Fu"", imparts the wisdom and teachings of the Shaolin priests in a most entertaining fashion. After studying for many years under the masters of the Eastern philosphy, ""Caine""(David Carradine) begins his journey West. Sought after as a wanted man for the killing of a royal(self-defense), and also seeking the half-brother he never knew, his travels take him through the old West of the United States.

Most episodes begin with flashbacks of the young Caine, studying at the temple(""When you can snatch the pebble, Grasshopper, it will be time for you to leave""). As he journeys, he runs into many different and dangerous situations, and we see flashbacks of the particular lesson he learned that he will use to help him through the prejudices he faces. The soft spoken and humble Priest only uses his defensive training when necessary, (usually about once or twice an episode). The filming of these scenes are beautiful. Often in slow-mo we can see the beauty of the moves and the anguish on the faces of the opponents as they must sometimes fight for the lives. There are always great lessons of life to be learned in each story.

The series opens with the Pilot Movie(2/72), his Shaolin beginnings, and the start of his journey. There are great guest stars including a little Jodie Foster who shows great talent early on in ""Alethea""(Season 1).

A series that will stand the test of time.

2297007,5,B0009K7R02,"I waited for several years to get this so that I wouldn't have to pay hundreds of dollars for it. Now I guess I wait for the for the rest of it to get affordable, maybe in the mean time I'll get some of the movies for the collection. Good idea......",1366156800,,249,3.9019607843137254
2297008,5,B0009K7R02,The Kung Fu battle in each episode is great to watch -- but mostly there are lots of little nuggets of wisdom that make me stop and think.  One episode at a time is plenty... but they are also definitely worth watching again and again.,1294704000,,235,4.222222222222222
2297009,5,B0009K7R02,"I was a huge fan of Kung Fu in the 70's.  I hadn't seen or even thought about it much in years until a friend and I mentioned recently how much we loved the show.  I had no idea if it was still available, but a quick search online showed me that the entire series (3 seasons) was now out on DVD.  I received it a few weeks ago, and it's still an absolute joy to watch.  In addition to the show itself still being as cool as ever, watching it kind of ""takes me back"" to a different part of my life, in the best way.  And having matured to a greater or lesser degree (depending on who you talk to) over the intervening years, I find I can appreciate the show's subtleties and philosophical teachings better now than when I was young.

The extras about the development of the show, casting, etc. are informative.  But of course it's the show itself that stands out.  A few reviews mentioned that the video quality wasn't all that good - I've only watched the pilot movie and a few episodes so far, but have found the video quality to be just fine.  After all, it was shot in the early 70's and will only look as good as the technology at that time would have allowed.  I actually like the fact that it looks exactly as I remember it, making the experience all the more authentic.

If you loved the show like I did, it's a no-brainer.  You get the whole series for less than $100...snatch the pebble from my hand, walk the rice-paper, and buy this set, Grasshopper!",1220745600,,1461,4.215827338129497
2297010,5,B0009K7R02,I just finished watching the 62 episodes and it exceeded my expectations.  Great concept for a TV series.,1213660800,,105,4.833333333333333
2297011,4,B0009K7R02,"I bought this set with some trepidation. It's a 70's TV show, with simple plots and appealed to that generation. Would it stand the test of time?

Yes!

The quality of presentation and packaging is supported by the quality of the dvd's. The picture holds up well on a big screen. The plots are as you would remember, predictable but nevertheless inspirational and moving. Caradine lives his role, it is impossible to not accept the he and Caine are one and the same.

The initial picture and first episode will quickly get you hooked. Why was he called grasshopper? A fundamental link to being in tune with the world. Philosophy as entertainment? Hollywood providing a role model? Don't look too deep. Just buy and enjoy as much as we did over thirty years ago.",1207353600,,761,4.664179104477612
2297012,5,B0009K7R02,"Wonderful & Safe Entertainment For Whole Family

We do not have regular TV as a result of what is being shown today, especially the commercials we find very to be very offensive and can be worst then the programming in some cases.

We are purchasing more & more of the various DVDs from the time when shows were morally much safer all around!

Kung FU Episodes aside from being great shows, offer Moral Life Lessons we feel are beneficial to all our children & us alike!

Healthier experience for children of all ages!",1207094400,,518,4.537634408602151
2297013,5,B0009K7R02,"I think you have to know about the series if you're going to buy this. It was one of the first programmes I remember watching on tv as a kid. So if you're reading the review, you're interested in buying the DVD's but wonder if it's worth it. I have to say I have certainly got my money's worth with the DVD's. There are 4 double sided disks in each box with 3 programmes on each side of the disk. I am only half way through the second series but my wife complains that I am hogging the TV...(where is Caine when you need him!) If you want to see endless Kung Fu fighting then this is not for you as Caine does 2 fights per episode. It's more about the philosophy in the temple and Caine applying the principles through life doing his 'Little Hobo' bit. If you collect the final Caine Kung Fu film then you have a complete collection. Watching the programmes also takes you back to your halcyan days of Yore, (the good old days) and what you were doing when Kung Fu was on 'the box'. I'm certainly glad I bought them, great value for money.",1203811200,5,1039,4.174129353233831
2297014,5,B0009K7R02,"Excellent series, it was nice watching it from the begining to end, something I've never been able to do. The quality of the dvd's are excellent.

2297016,5,B0009K7R02,"This is just a great series, period.  I like the first season because Caine is so innocent, and because the portrayal of westerners is gritty - the whole gestalt is mesmerizing from a 2008 standpoint.  The second season is also excellent - sometimes too many flashbacks, some hokey acting, but a lot of really well-done stunts and good stories.  The third season is different...I don't like the 'new' intro they did, and some of the stories are ridiculous.  Sometimes you can just tell how they are directing the actors and the acting, including Carradine's, is stiff.  But this season also has some of the best stories, and best fight sequences.  Now if they would just put the 1990's sequel series on DVD!",1200787200,,707,4.754098360655738
2297017,5,B0009K7R02,One of the finest TV series ever put on. For the time this was very well written and acted. I thought the premise for the series was very inventive.,1199577600,,148,4.137931034482759

Back in the 70's those who made this TV-show a reality did it from heart, compassion, soul and respect. I realy miss this very spiritual show from them days. And am greatfull that this enlighting collection is now in my pesronal home library. When specially shows these days heavily lack to speak of patients, observe with the senses, will of the spirit, forgiveness and love. Thanks!

2297019,4,B0009K7R02,"I really enjoy my Kung Fu tv series, however the first disc that is suppose to have the pilot movie is exactly the same as the # 3 disc.  How can I get the correct disc 1 ?",1192492800,2,172,3.526315789473684
2297020,5,B0009K7R02,"If you've never seen the series, buy it. The introduction of Eastern principles to popular culture in the U.S. started an avalanche of change in awareness and consciousness. If you are a fan of the series, well there is no question about it.

The series is well packaged, strong plastic holders for each DVD. Lots of information on the boxes, and summaries of the episodes as well.

Seeing the shows, sequentially, and having them to watch and understand is exceptional. My only disappointment is the show did not continue longer - further developing understanding of living these principles daily. (But maybe that's just my Western over-indulgent appetite speaking.) There is plenty to be learned here from each episode, and the entire series as a whole.

The extras - Season 1 (beginnings, casting, directing, etc...), Season 2 (a dinner conversation about meaning, significance), and Season 3 (trip to China - Shaolin Temple, Great Wall, back streets, Chinese New Year) - all offer significant insight into many aspects of the series.

David Carradine makes a strong effort to clarify that he is NOT Kwai Chang Caine, but in the end he is still deeply affected by the experience that was Kung Fu and it shows in all his conversation, experiences shown on the DVD. (Radames Pera seems to have integrated his character, the philosophy, into his adult self more than Carradine. Perhaps he should write a book on his take of the series, philosophy, phenomenon.) Carradine's great sense of humor shines through as well in the personal encounters he has - his ""Rules Of Getting Through Life"" are wonderful.

The fact that his mentor, trainer, (Rob Moses) is present in the China trip and what a dream come true that was for him is a great piece of insight into the work. Knowing the impact the effort of creating this series had on those involved only serves to make this an even more meaningful piece of philosophy and peace of mind(s).

If you, as I, learn from film this is a MUST HAVE for your collection.",1191024000,,2006,4.816860465116279
2297021,5,B0009K7R02,"I have waited my whole life to be able to see the entire series again. As a youth I couldn't wait to watch the show every week at night when it was on, I based much of what I thought was right and the way things should be on the teachings of 'Grasshapuh'. This three season set is top quality and it even has the 90 minute series premier. It's most definately worth the money.",1187136000,2,376,4.026666666666666
2297022,4,B0009K7R02,"I bought this for my 61 year old husband who loved kung fu then and loves it now.  although the sound and color is the same as it was when it came out, it is great fun to watch and quite nostalgic.  As always love the ability to just click and have it purchased and shipped with the one click.",1185062400,3,293,3.8666666666666667
2297023,5,B0009K7R02,"Not only will you enjoy the full three-season run, which includes the 2-hour pilot show, but there are many special features, interviews, and extras throughout the three seasons. Being older, wiser, one tends to see the little guffaws in wardrobe, mis-matched stand-ins and crew members getting into the shot. In one such scene Caine is fighting a man (the actor's stand-in) and the man is seen standing idly by watching ""himself"" fight Caine. Too Funny. The temple scenes are the greatest value to me. Yes, they guzzied up the old ""castle"" from Camelot to make it look like a Chinese Buddhist temple, but it looks great anyway. One thing I caught though that is historically inaccurate, Carradine is always talking about the Tao, and so are his masters, even quoting Lao Tzu in many cases. However, Lao Tzu would have been a contemporary of the Shaolin sect and his writings would not have been widely published so that monks would use his quotes as ""sage wisdom"". Also, Shaolin was a Ch'an (Zen in Japanese)Buddhist temple, and would not have had an interest in Lao Tzu or Taoism. That notwithstanding, I highly recommend these for anyone who enjoys Asian culture, Taoism, martial arts, etc. Everyone can find something within this series, and within themselves that they didn't know existed previously.

2297024,5,B0009K7R02,"When I was younger I would watch Kung Fu on some of the upper UHF channels, and even as a boy I loved the story of Caine and his trials and tribulations. This transfer to DVD is ok and the picture does appear to be cropped somewhat, but it's not severe, and does not ruin the presentation. Some of the episodes are real treats and the lessons are as relevant today as they were in the 70's. I enjoyed this as a boy and now my son enjoys it as well. I definitely recommend all three of the seasons if you enjoy eastern mysticism or martial arts.",1174780800,,544,4.093457943925234

8062483,3,B0009K7R02,"Was a bit expensive for just the first 3 seasons, as I could have purchased the entire group of seasons (if available) for about the same price.  Purchased this as a Father's Day present for my almost 96 year old Father.  He used to like the series a lot, but now says it doesn't have enough ""action"" in it.  Oh, well.",1498435200,,318,4.180327868852459
8062484,5,B0009K7R02,"I remember the ""Kung Fu"" series as a HS freshman, and with the bullying at school I always felt intimidated and useless, and even if I didn't understand the episodes at the time, I had a bit of calm knowing that when I go in on Monday morn, I had something to say. I was so young but I felt there was something better in the world. Knowing Kung Fu as a TV series and a piece of your own life is dealing  with everything that reality gives you. The greatest thing about the series is that it is probably the best written Hollywood TV show ever made, based on the old Chinese novel ""Journey To The West"". But instead of India being the new frontier it is the 1800's American West during the expansion of the US continent, and Cain's quest is his to find his brother and family at the risk of his own capture as a murderer.
The cast are superb, mostly a ""Who's-Who"" of the best Asian-American actors who prove their mettle among some of  Hollywood's greatest acting talents. There are so many but Keye Luke and Phillip Ahn shine as the masters in Cain's past who lead him to his destiny and prove that even the smallest of victories shall grant the greatest gift, even if no man ever needs to fight. Caine lived among the meek, and retribution was always made by the merciful, good or evil.
Move forward to college Eastern Philosophy classes when I read and practiced the yarrow reeds of the ""I Ching"", and realized that as I read the poetry to impress my college buds, I recognized these parables of life changes from my youth. This inspired me to consider purchasing the full collection of ""Kung Fu"" some day and several decades later it was the right time because the DVD format supports the incredible story content and side notes.
The packaging is perfect, with limited commentaries from each season by David Carradine as he expresses his views on the sets, props, and trivia.  Not only is the writing of the series top notch, the photography is amazing and a wonderful experience to watch again.
