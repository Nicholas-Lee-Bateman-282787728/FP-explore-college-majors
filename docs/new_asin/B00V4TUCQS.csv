7076412,5,B00V4TUCQS,"Great film!! In a genre where originality is in short supply, these filmmakers have managed to find an interesting and compelling take on the zombie film. Artistically realized and very well put together, this one not to be missed. Look forward to more from these filmmakers.",1444867200,2,275,5.0
7076413,4,B00V4TUCQS,"If Kevin Smith had a three way with Roger Corman and George A. Romero, and birthed a love child, it would be A Plague So Pleasant.

This is a truly original idea. Yes its about Zombies, which has been kicked to death with no return of originality. But there are the few that stand out. There are the few that do something totally different, and expresses that originality that so many lack. A Plague so Pleasant is one of those that spark an original idea, and a unique approach to the world of Zombies. This half Black and White, and half in Color comedy horror, is a picture that has such a dry humor, that you the viewer, truly are entertained by. I absolutely loved this comedy horror. It was fresh, different, and truly an odd duck in a world of countless repeats.

The unique slow burn mentality. The odd camera work. Amazing makeup and effects, which I was floored how excellent this reality was in the picture. The makeup and effects, is what truly adds such great flare to the film. The first half and end half, the black and white filmed moments, is truly my favorite part of the film as a whole. There is a slow burn, dry humor and artistic approach in the film at the start and end.

The low down to the plot is. Yes the Zombie Apocalypse happened. A 12 hour Zombie rampage. What they discovered is the Zombies would only become animated, and attacked if fired upon. It you use a weapon they turn into brain eating, fast zombies. So the public, the government put into place that no Zombie could be killed. And so the Zombies just existed without bothering the humans as long as the humans didn't bother them. Your main character is Clay. His roommate Todd wants to date his sister Mia. But Mia is in love with her dead boyfriend. She cant let go of him, even though he is dead roaming around the woods. Clay takes it upon himself to kill the boyfriend Zombie. He sneaks out and finds the boyfriend zombie, kills it. Well as you would guess, the bullet awakens the brain eating zombies. No longer are they peaceful, but now ravaging dead once again.

All the acting is spot on. The roommate Todd played by Maxwell Moody acts in that Christian Bale, American Psycho tone of conversation and emotions. Moody truly captures the part, and creates a dry humor that you have to see to understand. David Chandler, your main star, and character Clay is also a mix of dry humor, and emotional depression. All the characters come to life in a believable way through the wonderful, odd, over the top at times acting. Each of the characters have their own style that just makes the film, funny, different, and absolutely weird. Eva Boehnke plays Mia. She is fantastic in the part. The chemistry between the actors is like watching a stage play of performers, playing off each other, in odd, weird ways that stand out. Which I might add that this is the first feature length film for all three of them, (at least that is what I can find out). I think more or less they did a great job for a low budget, indie horror, B-movie.

The dialogue at times is gut busting. The script is something that makes this film stand out above and beyond all the other rehashed Zombie films. There is a moment where Clay is at his office, during a meeting, when his boss is reading form a pamphlet that I cracked up on. I mean its dull and stupid moment, but that was the point. It was like Ben Stein in Ferris Buellers Day Off, when he was taking attendance. That is what this movie details, specifically at the start in the Black and White moments. A dry, corny, dull humor that just makes you crack up.

Being brought out on DVD by Wild Eye Releasing. Wild Eye did another fantastic, weird and odd choice of film to express. A Plague so Pleasant is a different style of Zombie film. Yes it has the mentality of comedy horror, but it also adds the unique reality of independent film making.

This feature is written and co-directed by Benjamin Roberds. Also as co-director Jordan Reyes. This being both there first time in the direction department. This is there first feature length film, and I think with all its odd and screwy reality, it works. I was entertained. I laughed, and felt all the wonderful dry humor. The silliness, and also the homage trademarks to the Zombie Film world.

These two directors took the old, tired, I don't want to hear about zombies again. I could care less mentality, and turned it around for me. I will be very blunt, I hate Zombies. I hate Zombie movies, I hate everything about Zombies this day and age, that is unless we are talking about the original concepts, or horror landmarks like, Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of Dead, and Day of the Dead, Fulcis Zombie, or anything Fulci, 28 Days Later and so on. The Zombie mentality has been hashed, rehashed and over done to the point they aren't scary, and to me there utterly boring. Thankfully there are a few writers and directors of films that bleed some new original reality into the dead, (no pun intended) concept. Both Roberds and Reyes are two of those directors that give a new voice to a tired dead reality. Roberds writing created a unique blend of dry, silly comedy, around a world of flesh eating, oatmeal loving Zombies.

Theres a moment in the film where Clay is in a rundown building and there is an eyeless Zombie. This moment is awesome. It plays out like all the old westerns. There in a standoff moment. Music, close up of the faces, and hands, as they pause to see which one makes the first movie. A brilliant moment. That is what this film has, many moments that are truly unique and memorable.

If I had to pick one flaw, it would be the running time. Only coming in at a little over 75 minutes, it still felt a little long winded, and kind of dragged in small spots. Not a major flaw, but one that could have added a little tighter flow of the film if it had been cut by 5 to 10 minutes.

I have to give a huge shout out to Tylar Carver. His make-up special effects is extraordinary and some of the best I have seen in a low budget horror film. He truly captured a unique, yet old school beauty to blood, gore and rot. Amazing shots of pure make-up carnage that stood out. Also I have to give a shout out to one of the directors, Jordan Reyes for the cinematography, pure awesome. I think that is another amazing thing about this low budget horror film, is all the behind the scenes work. The visual effects, sound department, music, makeup, lighting, all works, and in my viewpoint gave an excellent trip of independent horror.

Love the song Oh Freedom written and recorded by Green Gerry, who also is in the film as himself, a.k.a. Mias Zombie Boyfriend (Green Gerry Facebook). The music and sound throughout the film give another good reality to this fascinating trip into low budget, unique comedy horror.

Extras:

Promos, both Domestic and International.

Also the disc. comes with many trailers. Ebola Zombies, Blood Soaked, Disco Exorcist, Jonah Lives, and Night of the living Dead: Reanimated, A Zombie Exorcism, Frankensteins Hungry Dead.

Overall:

My favorite parts are the black and white moments. For lovers of low budget, independent, B-movies, Drive-In style flare and late night screenings, I feel you will take to this film, and get it. Lovers of Horror Comedy, of Dark Comedy will love this film. This is fun romp, and also a unique B-movie zombie film that stands out from the countless others. A great DVD from Wild Eye Releasing for all the fans that get this style of B-movie entertainment.

Slowly you learn to live with them, eventually you don't think much of them at all.

As someone who has seen an exorbitant amount of zombie movies, I did not expect to be particularly impressed by this one. This is one case however, in which I was thrilled to be wrong!

""A Plague so Pleasant"" delivers a truly unique take on the zombie paradigm. Both humorous and poignant at times, the film succeeds in remaining unpredictable throughout the entire hour and twenty minutes, a quality often lacking in many post apocalyptic tales of the like. My hats are off to these filmmakers in a big way. What they have accomplished on a shoe string budget exceeds what many, with ten times their budget, strive for yet fail to achieve. I cannot wait to see what they put out next.

7076428,3,B00V4TUCQS,"I liked the concept of the movie. However, and while I realize using the word ""realism"" in concerns to a zombie movie may sound elitist, no matter how silly or far fetched the fictional world is, if the alternate reality is going to use real-world common sense, physics, and other trappings then it has to make sense within its own world. The premise, that zombies are only flesh-eating monsters when attacked, is good. But the start of the movie's action (and color, it starts and ends in black and white) is when a lone zombie, not in sight of any other zombie, is shot. I could understand a chain reaction to violent horde if even one other saw the attack, and then other zombies saw that zombie react, but all it takes is to hear 1 gun shot and every zombie suddenly goes into a murderous rage? That would mean any loud, gunfire-resembling sound should cause the same thing. There are a lot of things that sound like that. In this movie's reality, a simple car backfiring would cause a swarm, and Independence Day fireworks would destroy the world. It had me, and it's well shot and made, but as soon as this piece of shoddy world-building hit my consciousness, I was out of the story. For genre fans, it's still worth a watch, hence the 3 stars. I would've given it 4 if not for the contrived cause of the horde.",1501286400,2,1317,4.446280991735537

7076441,5,B00V4TUCQS,"A Plague So Pleasant (2015)

A Plague So Pleasant is a full length indie film, and that cost $1,400 to make. These movie prodigies, Benjamin Roberbs and Jordan Reyes were born with a talent to make great films. With a 76 minute running time it goes by fast but there are several Redford moments throughout. Redford means awesome btw for those who aren't hip.

The acting was well done, and the special effects were great, but the best part was the unique story. I've never seen a zombie movie quite like this one. The zombies are fascinating because they aren't violent unless you provoke them. The story starts off one year after the zombie apocalypse began. The initial outbreak only lasted twelve hours, but two billion people were killed by the half-day zombie conflict.

Zombies are more of a nuisance than a threat. Almost like bums. It's actually a felony to shoot a zombie because if a walking corpse is harmed, they will all attack. They prefer oats rather than brains. Unfortunately, the zombies keep multiplying because if you die of natural causes, you just get up again and shuffle the earth as one of the undead. Basically, zombies have replaced death. This movie was a treat from start to finish. And it might be cliche to compare the film makers to Quentin Tarantino but the ending credits are something he would be smiling at once they rolled. What a fun tensioned filled flick. Sure there are flaws but this is a beautiful start to a future movie career.

Freshman phenom's for sure! I highly recommend this movie to any zombie fan. I can't wait to see these guys next movie! Thanks to jordansbrains for the help with this review. #moviesandcandy #lasvegas",1445472000,4,1674,4.722602739726027
7076442,4,B00V4TUCQS,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

I am so thankful there are directors out there who can still find new takes on the zombie genre.  Now, don't get me wrong:  I love straight-up zombie movies as much as the next guy; and THE WALKING DEAD is my favorite show on TV right now.  But when somebody can bring something new to the tablewell, thats a true talent.  Such is the case with A PLAGUE SO PLEASANT, a recent release from Wild Eye Releasing.  This low budget gem is a nice detour from the standard zombie fare most of us are used to.

This film is not perfect, but its full of heart and talent.  And despite working with a shoestring budget (I heard they shot the whole film for only $3,000), the production team does an amazing job in putting everything together.

A PLAGUE SO PLEASANT is shot well, and the camerawork looks good onscreen.  The film is presented in black-and-white, though, which threw me a bit.  Im not sure why this was chosen, but I suppose it works as a whole; it just seemsodd.  But thankfully, its not a big detractor.

The acting is about what youd expect from a low budget film, but its pretty good, thankfully.  I am not familiar with the cast, but they do a fine job in their roles.

The special effects are, once again, decent for a low budget picture.  And now that I think about it, I would imagine they are the reason for the black-and-white presentation.  Cheaper effects actually look better in B&W than in color.

But the story in A PLAGUE SO PLEASANT is the real winner here.  This is not a typical zombie-genre style plot.  I love how the dead are an endangered species in the film, and the lengths to which the government goes in an attempt to protect them.  One sign on a fence even states PICK POCKETING THE UNDEAD IS CONSIDERED GRAVE ROBBING AND WILL BE PROSECUTED.  Very good stuff.

As such, I really enjoyed A PLAGUE SO PLEASANT, and I recommend it.  Keep your expectations realistic (dont get into it expecting a WALKING DEAD budget), and you should thoroughly enjoy it.  I see bigger and better things in the production teams future, so I cannot wait to see what they do next.",1445299200,3,2162,4.412658227848102
8709095,3,B00V4TUCQS,"I bought this film for a few reasons.  The first reason is that I am a horror movie enthusiast.  I especially love zombie films.  The second reason is that my Latin teacher was an extra and the Executive Producer!  Hopefully, my workload doesn't mysteriously get harder because of this review!  Ha!

So onto the review.  It is indeed a low budget film, but that doesn't necessarily mean it is terrible.  Plenty of lower budget films are amazing.  However, I think a slightly bigger budget may have helped here, especially with the CGI effects.  Some of the practical effects, such as glass shards sticking out of flesh, would probably have been better too.

The plot was indeed different.  Aside from the horror/black comedy film Fido, zombies as a protected species have not been done.  This was a new approach.  I thoroughly enjoyed the idea of the ""living, or unliving, cemetery"".  The pacing was a little slow.  I don't know much about the director, if this is his first foray or if he has a few under his belt, but pacing is a learned skill that gets better with each film made.  This suffered from too many shots lingering a bit much.

There were a few plot holes here and there.  I don't want to go into detail for they are integral to the story and would spoil it for people who haven't seen it yet.  But just know there are one or two head-scratchers.  The writing was solid (aside from the mentioned holes).  It was a good yarn.  But my brother Joe made an astute observation that this film might have been better if it was condensed down to that of something like a Twilight Zone episode.  I think it struggled to fill in the gaps with the hour and seventeen-minute runtime.

The quirkiness of the characters is going to come down to personal tastes.  The characters Todd and Mia are either going to make people chuckle or make people groan.  The acting is hit or miss.  The extras were amazing, especially one in particular. Hint, hint. Ha!.  In all seriousness, I think the main actor did a fantastic job.  Perhaps a bit hammy here and there, but otherwise a solid performance.  See my above comments on Mia and Todd.  And they weren't bad by any means, they just may not be your cup of tea.  It is apparent the director/writer was certainly going for some shades of Tarantino or Kevin Smith with his dialogue and narration choices.

The film was a fun 3 out of 5.  It was a different take on zombies, made with heart (you could certainly tell that), had a believable story with a few holes (for the realm of horror), but suffered from pacing issues, iffy effects, and style choices that may or may not put off the viewer.",1531353600,,2635,4.498942917547569
