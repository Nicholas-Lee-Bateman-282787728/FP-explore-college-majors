8241483,4,B0011E4BC2,If you are a Kennedy fan then this is worth watching...just for the info and the pics and videos. The angle of the video...the whole curse thing...they kind of failed to really do anything with the angle. I think it was just a money making op because the Kennedy name still sells so good.,1313884800,,288,4.351851851851852

8241485,5,B0011E4BC2,"This is a program focusing on all the tragedies that have happened in the Kennedy family starting from when the first Kennedy arrived in America from Ireland to JFK, Jr.'s death in 1999. It has a lot of information, so it is great for those who know little about the Kennedy family.",1262563200,2,282,4.4423076923076925
8241486,5,B0011E4BC2,"This is an excellent biography/documentary of the Kennedy family, dating back to JFK's grandparents. I watched it on the History Channel and just had to search for it, to buy it. It revealed so many things I did not know about this family. It also has some beautiful home movies of the whole family; all of John and Bobby growing up; swimming, playing. If you don't believe this family has a curse following them, you will believe it when you watch this. It is just not a coincidence that everytime one of these people went on a plane, or in a car, they didn't get killed. The most shocking, and what I did not know, was that while JFK was still in his teens, his oldest brother, jealous of Jack's medal and heroic act from the war, goes on a mission to win back his father's attention from Jack. He and his passenger was supposed to eject, but somehow they didn't, and their aircraft exploded. Then a few years later, JFK's sister goes on a plane with her married lover, and they crash. And the tragedies go on and on and on....",1209686400,,1029,4.364583333333333
