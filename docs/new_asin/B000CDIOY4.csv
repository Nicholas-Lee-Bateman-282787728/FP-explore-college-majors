2458799,4,B000CDIOY4,"Watching this film was my first exposure to this work by the adolescent Mozart, so I'm going to start with my impressions of the opera itself. Like early Verdi, Mitridate conforms to the structural conventions of the time. In Mozart's case, this means the rigid format set by the genre known as opera seria, using a slight storyline as a backdrop for a series of florid arias sung by an extensive cast of characters. But Mitridate is no mere curiosity, it is a substantial opera in its own right, just as Verdi's Nabucco and Ernani are substantial operas. In fact, I was amazed at how this opera progressively grows more open and alive despite the rigid structure, infused with its own distinctive brand of youthful vigor(another thing it has in common with Nabucco and Ernani), how the music goes from fairly uninspired(still pretty, though) imitations of Gluck in the first half to the uniquely Mozartean showpieces that dominate the second half and show an astonishing amount of emotional depth for a fourteen-year-old. Mitridate might not be Don Giovanni, but it has moments of transcendence and is well worth a serious listen(and look).

On to the film. Jean-Pierre Ponnelle has managed an intimate but not stagy visual experience by filming on location at the beautiful, atmospheric and palatial Teatro Olimpico which provides both bright and wide open courtyards and dark, claustrophobic corridors. Ponnelle avoids private chambers in his interpretation, which gives the environment a more impersonal look, but this lends itself to the title character's emphasis on politics and ambition over interpersonal relationships and compassion.

Ponnelle has gathered an attractive cast of singing actors, both physically and vocally. I've been a fan of the recently deceased dramatic tenor Gosta Winbergh for some time now, although I confess to having experienced very few of his performances. He looks a little like the actor Viggo Mortenson, and his voice is reminiscent of Pavarotti's. But don't let that milky smooth voice fool you...Winbergh is perfectly capable of all the fire and adrenaline necessary for the role of Mitridate. The rest of the leading roles are taken by women. Ann Murray and Anne Gjevang play Mitridate's two sons, the Goofus and Gallant of opera seria. Murray is poignant as Sifare, the loyal son who tries to resist his love for his father's fiance, Gjevang brash, intense, and later quietly moving as the Shakespearean Farnace, the id to Sifare's ego. Yvonne Kenny plays the object of so many affections. Kenny is appropriately gorgeous, a mixture of Catherine Deneuve and Bernadette Peters, but more than that, she is noble, elegant, graceful, and her delivery of her arias, as well as her love duet with Murray, is flawless and beautifully uplifting. Finally, Joan Rodgers as Ismene, Farnace's abandoned fiancee, is very pretty and, more importantly, very assured in her singing, with a voice that matches her feminine beauty every step of the way.

There are longer versions of this opera available, so obviously some cuts were made. These were probably necessary to maintain a dramatic pace, since the story itself is rather static. The main attractions here are the location sets, which give a sense of closeness to the sea, and of course Mozart's music, beautifully written, beautifully sung.",1144886400,42,3328,5.147874306839187

If every one of his performances were of this mettle, the Wild Man would bestride the world like a colossus.

It is superbly sung (with one exception). The late Gosta Winbergh IS Mitridate. His landfall and thanksgiving to the gods are magical. How well he conveys the filicidal rage of the vanquished king. What a pity that the sound-engineers do him no favours in ""Quel ribelle e quell'ingrato"" and ""Gi di piet mi spoglio"" where his voice is recessed in each instance. He is better served in ""Vado incontro al fato estremo"", a gutsy aria in the minor that prefigures the opening bars of K 183. Yvonne Kenny - here as Aspasia - never made a better record. What a ""Al destin, che la minaccia."" It sets the scene for the subsequent action. She also melts stone in ""Nel grave tormento."" Much the same could be said of Ann Murray as Sifare - she could be remembered for ""Lungi da te, mio bene"" and nothing else and count herself blessed (and in passing, this aria alone is worth the price of admission - and how sweetly it's played by the Concentus Musicus Wien). Joan Rodgers is a sumptuous Ismeme. The only blot here - and it's a shocker - is Anne Gjevang as Farnace. She's so bovine (to wit, ""Va, l'error mio palesa"") one almost reaches for a cow-bell. Einstein states that Mitridate was the best opera seria to come Mozart's way. With Ponnelle in charge of proceedings, his claim rings true. One becomes engrossed in the narrative.

There are majors cuts in terms of arias and recitatives (for starters, Arbate's ""L'odio nel cor frenate"" and Farnace's ""Venga pur, minacci e frema"" are missing from Act 1). They're available in Hager's performance.

This is a triumph for all concerned, not least a fourteen year old kid. Indeed, one walks away with a heightened appreciation of ""the miracle that God allowed to be born in Salzburg."" Gun stuff.",1413417600,2,3386,5.550387596899225

8097879,5,B000CDIOY4,"HOSANNA TO PONNELLE'S SENSATIONAL PRODUCTION OF MITRIDATE

Of the 18 operas written in the 18th c. adapting the 1673 play ""Mithridate"" by French author Jean Racine, Mozart's Mitridate is practically the only one that is remembered, performed on stage, recorded, and filmed.

""Mitridate, re di Ponto"" is here directed by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, with the great Swedish tenor Gsta Winbergh in the title role, dazzingly filmed in 1986 in the surrealistically beautiful Vicenza's Teatro Olimpico, with the magnificent conducting of Nicolas Harnoncourt.

Notice that most of the best DVDs of Mozart's operas are published by Deutsche Grammophon. Which is also the publisher of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mozart-The-Salzburg-Festspiele-Opera-Boxset/dp/B000I8OFKU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mozart - The Salzburg Festspiele Opera Boxset</a>, labeled ""M-22"", as it includes all the 22 operas of Mozart, including an interesting Mitridate, but in a production presented in cheapo decors and ordinary clothing that kill any visual excitement.

LIBRETTO & SCORE

A note of caution: The DG box gives us the music and the scenery, but not the libretto. The libretto is indispensable to fully appreciate the music which follows the action on the stage and the feelings expressed by the beautiful arias. Synopses of action and indexes of tracks and arias are provided in the skimpy pamphlet, but this help is not enough.
The missing Italian libretto for Mitridate can be found online, either on ""opera.stanford.edu"", or as a complete PDF at ""librettidopera.it"".
The English translation is best found in the booklets offered in individual CD boxes. This means buying an additional version the opera, enabling us to join the fun game of comparing versions and singers, an entertainment for opera lovers which can last a lifetime.

The full score of Mitridate can be found at the Web site of DME, the ""Digital Mozart Edition"", which has put online all the works already published by NMA, the indispensable ""Neue Mozart Ausgabe"" (""New Mozart Edition"", with a good Wikipedia article).
This comprehensive site contains interesting photocopies of original documents and pages of Mozart's autograph scores. But the autograph Mitridate manuscript is lost, and only one manuscript copy (kept in Lisbon) has been preserved.

The DME (and the NMA) are key sources of research for any study of Mozart. No separate texts of the libretti are offered on DME, all shown integrated within the scores themselves.

MOZART'S LOVE OF THE VOICE AND HIS OVERRIDING PASSION FOR OPERA

""Of all the products of the Renaissance, opera is undoubtedly the most remarkable"" (Abert).

Opera was created at the end of the 16th c. by a group of elite musicians/scholars in Florence avid to re-generate the ideal of ancient Greek tragedy and its music, of which they had a nearly ""impenetrable"" image. Anyway, by trial and error, and introducing the native Italian taste for drama, they arrived at a formula, with the first opera ""Dafne"", by the composer Jacopo Peri (1597-8).

Thus, opera was first born as ""opera seria"", a genre of ""high drama"" among characters of the highest social prestige, tormented by the super-hot passions of the 17th - 18th c. upper classes. The story of Mitridate is a classical conflict of emotions between love and political ambition, the favored plot of the French playwright Jean Racine.

What is astonishing in the score of Mitridate is the energy poured out by the young boy of 14 in his music. From his early age Mozart could set in music the most tender feelings and the violence of rage and hatred.

Mozart's rare chameleonesque ability to navigate easily between both extremes of emotional life made him exceptionally gifted to write music for the voice. And Mozart was in love with voice all his life.
His unique emotional sensitivity made him ideal for opera writing. Mozart was a hyper-sensitive composer usually responding to events with extreme emotions immediately expressed in music. As long as he could live the emotions of his characters, he was able to generate the right music.

Mozart always felt he was first and above all an opera composer. He always yearned to write operas, and when he had a commission, he was at the summum of his creative faculties -- absorbed, ""in the flow"" -- and could, excitedly, passionately, invest all his energies unaware of his physical limits and exhaustion.

Mozart's first aria catalogued in the Kchel listing is K. 21, ""Va dal furor portata"", for tenor, written in London at age 9, and is a song of anger. Before Mitridate, Mozart had already written 16 arias, multiple vocal pieces for religious use, and 4 operas/cantatas, including the charming ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bastien-Und-Bastienne/dp/B000GYI31I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bastien Und Bastienne</a>"" (age 12) and the astonishing ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/La-Finta-Semplice/dp/B000667FPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">La Finta Semplice</a>"", (age 13), an opera of 558 music sheets, lasting 2.5 hours.

The musical coverage of emotional life by a young boy before puberty was nothing short of miraculous. And in a sense, these early Italian operas, such as Mitridate, are even more sensational than the well-known operas of maturity, as they already contain the contrast of delicate and furious music that he was able to inject in all his opera writing.

Opera is about singing. Mozart's music requires the very best voices to shine in its unique glow.

It would be hard to find a better Mitridate than the Swedish dramatic tenor Gsta Winbergh, who ranks among the very best tenors of all time, and who can sound smoother than Pavarotti. With his noble features, Winbergh is capable of expressing the most intense emotions. His tenor voice is highly seductive, with no rasping or edging. He brings all the rage and furor that Mitridate must project in his fateful predicament. Physically fit, he can move around easily, a more agile actor than say, Pavarotti in Ponnelle's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Idomeneo/dp/B000E5KOJI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Idomeneo</a>.

The four female singers framing the intense masculine presence of Winbergh are all so beautiful and so seductive that it is hard for me to pinpoint any weakness. The review by C. Boerger presents a fair evaluation of their brilliant performances.
Of course Yvonne Kenny, as Aspasia, the woman who sets into play the conflict between Mitridate and his sons, is spectacular, in singing and in dress. Ann Murray, as the dutiful son Sifare, shows all the sensitivity that her part requires.

COMPARING THE PONNELLE/HARNONCOURT DVD VERSION WITH LEOPOLD HAGER'S CD VERSION

I also own the CD recording of Leopold Hager, in the COMPLETE MOZART EDITION published by Philips in 1991 for the 200th anniversary of Mozart's death,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mozart-Mitridate-Philips-Complete-Mozart-Edition-Vol-29/dp/B00000411A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mozart: Mitridate (Philips Complete Mozart Edition, Vol. 29)</a>.
Hager's version, of Jan 1977, lasts 193' 21"", against the listed 124' of Ponnelle's 1986 extravaganza, with only 118' 19"" of effective music. Which means that 75' of the complete version have been lopped off by Ponnelle, or 39% -- 45' of aria music (out of 122') and 30' of recitative music (out of 71') .

Hager always likes to present a reference version, with all the recitatives and all the music. But his singers are so melodious that they make listening to them a pleasure. For instance, the superbly virile German tenor Werner Hollweg sings Mitridate, facing FIVE world-class sopranos with equally enchanting voices: Arleen Auger (unforgettably lovable as Aspasia), Edita Gruberova (simply unmatchable as Sifare), Agnes Baltsa, and Ileana Cotrubas, as main protagonists, plus Christine Weidinger in the marginal role of Arbate. Such a cast cannot be surpassed.

Ponnelle solved the tricky problem of Arbate, an aging male advisor to the king with a soprano castrato part. Instead of a female soprano, Ponnelle staged a young boy, as Mitridate's third son, preserving the soprano partition although losing Arbate's only aria, No. 3 ""L'odio nel cor frenate"".

In both versions, all these magnificent voices make the whole difference.

When Mozart conducted the premiere of Mitridate, re di Ponto, K 87, in Milan on Dec. 26, 1770, just short of 15, a performance that lasted six hours (with ballet), music-loving Milanese erupted in shouts of ""Evviva il maestrino!"" The opera was performed a total of 22 times, a prodigious success for a new opera, rarely achieved in those days when Italy was flooded by an overabundance of new works.

PONNELLE'S OBSESSION FOR STAGING THE MOST SUMPTUOUS PRODUCTION TO FRAME THE SUPREME BEAUTY OF MOZART'S MUSIC

Ponnelle's productions are at the exact antipodes of the bare, cheapo, weird, hyper-""modern"" productions of Salzburg. Ponnelle's supreme art is to introduce super-luxurious decors and fantastic clothings for the best singers in the world.

Ponnelle likes to show his singers in full action in the large, open public spaces of the grandiose palace, unlike the claustrophobic and shabby interiors of ""modern"" productions. The grandeur of the settings provides an excellent background to the high-flown conflict of the lust for political power against the forces of love and passion.

All in all, it is the consistent beauty of all the components that makes this film so exceptional, a true gem.
- The backgrounds are spectacular architectural visions.
- The costumes are fantastic inventions of Ponnelle, always obsessed by the French style of Louis XIV's court at Versailles, but exaggerating their grandiosity to the point of absurdism. It matters not, we are in the domain of pure uninhibited fantasy, and the extravagant costumes harmonize well with the extraordinary majesty of the palatial background.
- In this context, it is a must that all the singers be exquisitely attractive and their singing superlative. Visual beauty is paramount. Ponnelle's expert directing gets the most expression out of his singers' acting. The filming is always stunning and perfectly enhances the extravaganza of the production.
- Mozart's music is beautiful and energetic, sublime in places. I only regret that the final chorus be so short. And the conducting by Harnoncourt captures the contrasts of tenderness and fury that move the story along. The riveting pace of the opera is due to the condensed libretto, deleting 75', that is 39%, of the music, and Harnoncourt's vigorous conducting in the creation of this exciting masterpiece.

The Ponnelle/Harnoncourt team, in order to maintain the visual interest of the DVD viewer, opted to cut the following 6 arias out of the original 25 numbers:
- No. 3 ""L'odio nel cor frenate"" (Arbate);
- No. 5 ""Parto: Nel gran cimento"" (Sifare);
- No. 6 ""Venga pur, minacci e frema"" (Farnace);
- No. 12 ""Tu, che fedel mi sei"" (Mitridate);
- No. 19 ""Tu sai per chi m'accese"" (Ismene), truly ravishing;
- No. 23 ""Se di regnar sei vago"" (Marzio).
I still miss those 6 deleted arias, all exquisite. Moreover, many arias have been considerably shortened. For instance:
- No. 2 ""Soffre il mio cor con pace"" (Sifare), lasting 8' in Hager is reduced to 2' 50"" in Ponnelle/Harnoncourt.
- No. 9, ""In faccia all'oggetto"" (Ismene, a very beautiful piece) has been shortened from 6' 44"" to 3' 43"".
- No. 15, ""So quanto a te dispiace"" (Ismene again) goes from 6' 34"" to 3' 24"".
Clearly, Ismene's ravishing music has been drastically curtailed, while Aspasia's arias have been left intact.
Many recitatives have been omitted or condensed. But, fortunately, all the original music remains in the Hager version.

But we have to trust Ponnelle's instinct. As a result, the story line is firmer, and the DVD becomes much more enjoyable -- not so much for professional musicians, established experts, and fanatical Mozart lovers, but mainly for the new generation of music-lovers, who are thus allowed to discover, for the first time in history, this exciting opera of young Mozart,

I have been watching this DVD every day for many weeks while doing my home gym exercises. And I cannot tire of listening to this energizing music and watching these magnificent singers in action.

THE ENTRY FOR MITRIDATE IN STANLEY SADIE'S ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-NEW-GROVE-BOOK-OF-OPERAS/dp/B009THCITQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE NEW GROVE BOOK OF OPERAS</a>"" (1996)

This famous compendium of the more than 250 most significant operas gives the following comment:

""Mitridate was commissioned for Carnival 1771; Mozart wrote the recitatives and overture while touring Italy in 1770. Reaching Milan on 18 October, he was forced to write and rewrite the arias quickly; Benedetti [Sifare] caused anxiety by his late arrival (1 December), and someone tried to persuade the prima donna [Bernasconi] to introduce arias from Gasparini's Mitridate (1767,Turin: with the same libretto). [She refused, delighted with Mozart's arias].

As in Vienna in 1768 [about Mozart's opera ""La Finta Semplice""] there were those who condemned the work in advance because of Mozart's extreme youth. They were silenced by the first performance....[26 December 1770. Hermann Abert describes in details the ""intrigues"" of rival composers Leopold had to combat to save the integrity of his son's opera].

Fitting the arias for demanding singers did not prevent Mozart introducing ample variety of expression:
- Aspasia's second aria [No. 4 ""Nel sen mi palpita""] is a powerful lament in G minor;
- Sifare's second [No. 5 ""Parto: Nel gran cimento"", here, alas, omitted] combines short andante sections with vehement allegro passages.
All Sifare's, Aspasia's and lsmene's music is characterized by extreme virtuosity.
Mozart skilfully abbreviated the required ternary forms and used a large number of arias in which contrasting affections are expressed by alternating tempos.
The overture is a three-movement sinfonia in D major and the finale a very short coro of soloists.

Mitridate is an astonishing achievement for a boy of 14; it makes the best use of conventional forms of expression and presents a drama which, if artificial, contains scenes of real intensity"" (p. 430).

THE EXCEPTIONAL EMOTIONAL DEPTH AND RANGE OF MOZART'S VOCAL MUSIC

One may legitimately wonder how the boy Mozart was able to express in music the  feelings of adults that he may not have yet experienced directly in real life (like amorous passion, or the rage of revenge). But Mozart KNEW precisely what the music of those feelings and emotions sounded like.

Since Mozart's very young age, Leopold took him everywhere during their European travels to watch the operas being shown in town -- often, nearly every evening. Mozart, with his phenomenal memory, had heard, since infancy, such a quantity of opera music by the best composers of the time that he was capable of recreating it instinctively through his own playing and writing.

Daines Barrington, the London lawyer examining Mozart at age 8, describes in his famous report to the Royal Society, ""Account of a very remarkable young Musician"", how he tested the boy's skills and had him improvise music for ""Song of love"", ""Affetto"", ""Song of rage"", and ""Song of Anger"", when the young boy ""worked himself into such a pitch that he was beating his harpsichord like a person possessed, rising sometimes in his chair"".

Mozart at 9 already wrote not only competent and able music, but exciting and eerily beautiful music. Just listen to the aria ""Va, dal furor portata"", K.21 written in 1765 when Mozart was in London, sung for instance by our superb Gsta Winbergh.

Mozart at 14? Just listen to the great, extraordinary aria ""Misero me! - Misero pargoletto"", K.77, sung by Edith Mathis, or Teresa Berganza, which Mozart produced on March 12, 1770 at a grand soire of the highest nobility and the best connoisseurs of Milan, organized by Count Firmian, the Austrian governor-general of Lombardy, and Leopold's friend.

This is an exceptional ""tour de force"" lasting a full 13' 37"" (as sung by Edith Mathis) of the most sublime and passionate music Mozart was capable of. He never produced a longer aria. And he only twice wrote again an aria of this phenomenal scope,
- the famous ""Ah, Lo Previdi!"", K272 (13' 23"" as sung by Lucia Popp) , written in August 1777, in Salzburg, age 21,
- and the transcendent ""Popoli di Tessaglia"", K316, written in July 1778, in Paris, for his love Aloysia Weber, assuring her that this was his very best aria ever. (11' 24"", sung by super-coloratura Edita Gruberova, who reaches towards the end the famous G6, the highest note sung in the repertoire.)

This aria ""Misero me! - Misero pargoletto"", K.77, is what convinced Milan's ""Regio Ducal Teatro"" (precursor of La Scala) that the young boy Mozart of 14 was capable of writing a full opera worthy of the great Milan stage, and gambled -- against all business prudence, and over the bitterness of competing composers -- on entrusting the small teenager with a most important commission, in fact a vital one, as it launched Mozart's career as an operatic composer in Italy. And this commission was of course ""Mitridate, Re di Ponto"" K. 87.

The production met with such great acclaim that it led to the commission of another opera for the 1772 Christmas/Carnival season in Milan -- the powerful ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lucio-Silla/dp/B000000SC2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lucio Silla</a>"", K135.

THE MODERN RE-EVALUATION OF MOZART'S ""EARLY"" MUSIC

""Mitridate"" is catalogued among the young Mozart's ""early Italian operas"".
And Ponnelle's work is contributing to the current radical re-evaluation of Mozart's early music and early operas.

This revision has been supported by Stanley Sadie, in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mozart-The-Early-Years-1756-1781/dp/0198165293/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mozart: The Early Years 1756-1781</a>&nbsp;(2006). Sadie, like Ponnelle, is yet another musical expert who seriously focused on the absolute value and intrinsic beauty of Mozart's early music.

Sadie, to his immense credit, explicitly debunks the common myth, that had become a clich in the 20th c., of a ""maturation"" process of Mozart happening in the late 1780's, his famous last decade in Vienna. The critics  who viewed Mozart's music in this simplistic schema tended to rhapsodize on the genius of the last operas, and easily dismissed the early operas, professing ignorance and disdain for his ""juvenilia"" unworthy of our time and attention.
They contributed to the neglect of Mozart's early music by singers, opera house managers, and the public. According to known records, Mitridate was never again produced since the Milan's Carnival performances until the 20th c.

Was Mitridate, less ""mature"" than Lucio Silla, Idomeneo, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/La-Clemenza-di-Tito/dp/B000CDIOYE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">La Clemenza di Tito</a>? ""Mature"" implies that the earlier works were ""immature"", which is nonsense. Sadie makes us listen again to these earliest operas, Bastien und Bastienne, K 50, la Finta Semplice, K 51, Mitridate, K. 87, and Lucio Silla, K 135, and shows us exactly where, how and why these early operas are in no way ""immature"", but already exciting, original, professional compositions.

THE REDISCOVERY OF MOZART'S EARLY OPERAS

Recently, most musicologists, in the same league as Sadie, have seriously begun revamping young Mozart's image, getting rid of the trite clichs (""mature,"" ""immature"", ""growing,"" ""blooming,"" ""blossoming"") firmly entrenched in the old-school commentators.

The clichs were accepted currency mostly because musical critics had never even heard or studied Mozart's early operas. Even today, Mitridate has been very rarely performed and studied. This was a time when versions of Mozart's Mitridate remained practically unavailable. Thanks to Hager and Ponnelle's enthusiasm, Mitridate is now, for the first time, enjoying world-wide exposure and distribution.

The rediscovery of Mozart's early operas is primarily the achievement of Philips's historical undertaking, on the occasion of the 200th anniversay of Mozart's death (1991), to present a fabulous recording of all Mozart's work, including, for the first time in history, all his early operas. This is the tour-de-force collection of THE COMPLETE MOZART EDITION, of 180 CDs in 45 volumes, published by Philips in 1991.
Mitridate is presented by Philips in the complete interpretation of Leopold Hager, of 193', now a de facto reference recording.

So, Ponnelle is justified in intensifying, by cuts and condensation, the dramatic interest of Mitridate for young modern audiences.
Truly, it is refreshing to venture off the beaten tracks of the routine programs of the great opera houses. Can we listen all our lives only to Don Giovanni, K 527, or Die Zauberflte, K 620, over and over again - although we could imagine worse fates - and never explore the vast range of Mozart's production? Overexposure can kill the strongest affection.

Most people know only the famous five, so-called ""mature"", operas of Mozart:
- the exciting ""Die Entfuhrung aus dem Serail"" (Abduction from the Seraglio), K 384 of 1782,
plus the last four all produced in the last five years of Mozart's life (1786-1791):
- ""Le Nozze di Figaro"", K 492;
- ""Don Giovanni"", K 527;
- ""Cosi Fan Tutte"", K 588;
- and ""Die Zauberflte"", K 620.
And nothing else. ""La Clemenza di Tito"", K 621, is still neglected by opera house managers, older folks still under the influence of the clichs of previous generations who had seen in ""La Clemenza"" only an anachronistic backward return to obsolete, dead and buried, and ""boring"" opera seria.

But, really, after an overdose of Sarastro in the ""Flute"", it is a delightful refreshing experience to reconnect with the youthful passionate Mozart of Mitridate.

The earlier operas have been left unknown and grossly undervalued mostly because their stodgy, conventional librettos of 18th-century formal court entertainment pose a difficult (and expensive) challenge to effective staging able to excite the visual interest of a modern popular audience.
And Ponnelle definitively showed in his Mitridate film that he was able -- with exceptional scenery, costumes, and supreme singers -- to render these stilted librettos alive and turn them into riveting productions

Mind you, the same thing happened to Hndel's operas, which got buried for good after their initial production. In the 18th c., opera goers and music lovers always craved for novelty - not unlike our taste for movies nowadays. Previous operas were immediately forgotten and replaced with new works. The composer was the only one who knew and could remember his previous operas.

It's only in the 20th c., with a new sense of historicity and the magical power of recording, that an interest reappeared in the old forgotten operas of Hndel and Mozart. Gradually, Mozart's youth operas are finally being dusted off and resurrected, and their magnificent music rediscovered and appreciated.

PONNELLE HAS CONTRIBUTED TO OUR RE-DEVELOPING A TASTE FOR OPERA SERIA

The modern tendency to affect disdain for ""opera seria"" - ""dramma per musica"" on noble heroic subjects mostly drawn from classical antiquity (Ancient Greece and Rome) or biblical stories, and ""festa teatrale"" suitable for a royal or aristocratic celebration - didn't improve matters.
Mitridate fuses the ""rhetorical heroism of the text"" and the ""grand historical background"" from Racine's French play with the ""complex intrigue"" of Italian drama (Abert, p. 189).

Even such a grandiose opera as ""Idomeneo"", K 366, was ignored for two centuries and re-exhumed only recently when Pavarotti and Domingo proved it could make a superlative audience-pleaser, with Hildegard Behrens's unforgettable mad scene, and Ponnelle daring to dress up the Homeric heroes in surreal French Louis XIV costumes and wigs.

We cannot over-estimate the impact of Ponnelle's filmed productions. Thanks to him, such difficult-to-stage grand opera serias as Idomeneo, Mitridate and La Clemenza di Tito, are given a new fresh listen, and, thanks to the new technology of DVDs, Ponnelle's spectacular performances have become available in the whole world and enabled a modern public to rediscover Mozart's enchanting music.

By educating the public to their extraordinary beauty, Ponnelle has contributed to this new and sudden revelation of Mozart's youth operas, unknown and ignored until the very end of the 20th c. As a result, this public interest is gradually inducing the best (and best-financed) opera houses to stage them.

All those expert Mozart lovers -- Sadie, Ponnelle, Hager, Bhm, and Harnoncourt -- are able to make us appreciate this unique freshness and sparkle of youth in Mozart's early music, and, in Mitridate, his unrelenting energy.

HERMANN ABERT'S THOROUGH BUT STERN ANALYSIS OF MOZART'S MITRIDATE

This complete re-evaluation of Mozart's early music, for the benefit of the next generations of Mozart lovers, is not the fact of Stanley Sadie or Ponnelle alone, but is taking place in the context of a contemporary campaign of restoration of Mozart waged on many fronts, tending to demonstrate that Mozart's ""early"" music has a remarkably distinct beauty, inimitable charm, and is valuable and admirable in its own right.

The other great expert is Hermann Abert, whose monumental&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/W-A-Mozart/dp/0300072236/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">W.A. Mozart</a>&nbsp;(1919, translated with a recent exhaustive in-depth revision in 2007), is the Bible for scholars and lovers of Mozart. Abert devotes many pages to the historical events leading to the commission, writing, and production of Mitridate (p. 140-3), and to the analysis of the music (p. 188-192).

As usual, Abert, a German academic authority of the highest caliber, reproaches Mozart for introducing new untamed ideas into the principal theme of the arias or the orchestral music.
""Clearly, he has yet to fathom the principal secret of Italian music, namely the organic unity of its melodic writing, a unity that is preserved in spite of all its breadth and wealth of detail. Instead of calmly developing his ideas, he all too often breaks off and catches his listeners off-guard by introducing new motifs that spring inexhaustibly from his ever-fertile imagination. Elsewhere, too, there is often too much of a good thing"" (p. 191).
As an example, Abert mentions the ""outburst of fury"" in Aspasia's No. 1 aria ""Al destin che la minaccia"", which, Abert claims, should be ""a simple prayer to God"" (p. 190).

Similarly, Abert is pleased that in the first half, Mozart is able to deny ""his symphonic skills free rein"", but from around No. 14 ""Nel grave tormento"" (Aspasia) ""the instruments become increasingly prominent in the German manner"", leading to play by the orchestra that is ""detracting from the prior claims of the vocal line.""
Abert is disturbed when Mozart's ""principal poetic idea"" is threatened by his ""most disparate moods"" which ""threaten the hegemony of the principal musical idea."" This is Abert versus a Mozart who prefers to indulge his ""delight in his own wealth of ideas and in purely musical contrasts"".

MOZART'S PREDILECTION FOR MUSIC ""FLOWING LIKE OIL""

But Abert's criticism is terribly unfair and it touches on the very essence of Mozart's composition style.

For Mozart's own natural tendency is to give free rein to his inventions and to follow his own spontaneous melodies and orchestral ideas wherever they want to lead him, most often unpredictably to us and also to him.
Above all, Mozart's supreme value in writing music was ""flow"" -- music ""flowing like oil"" is his fundamental motto for composition, as he continually repeated to his father Leopold, even if Mozart was the only one to clearly perceive how the flow should go.

In Daniel Kahneman's modern psychology (""Thinking, fast & slow"", 2011): Mozart's spontaneous intuition (System 1) is distinct from music laboriously constructed simply to apply theoretical principles of composition (System 2 of reflection, control, and reasoning).

And no doubt about it, Mozart would have never retouched any of his music simply to abide by Abert's punditry.

For one of the immense charms of Mozart's music, clearly manifest in Mitridate, is precisely in following him through this happy, unbridled sudden jumps to new musical phrases, themes, and ideas which take him we never know where, but always have a gracious way to blend with the whole while they deliver at the end a unified piece.
And they're so quickly gone that we want and need to re-listen again and again to the work to capture all its subtleties and evanescent beauties.
This is the essence of Mozart's ""flow"" for which there is no formula (System 1's intuition), and which needs Mozart himself to be perceived and created.

Aristocratic connoisseurs would complain about this unbounded wealth of musical ideas that went too fast to be even appreciated, even less remembered. Nobody could cope with the unstoppable abundance of his music. His father Leopold tried to remind him of the need to check this torrent-like creativity; professional musicians and singers would occasionally complain.

Leopold played a decisive role in nurturing Mozart's creativity without stifling it. During the journeys through Italy when young Mozart was writing all the recitatives of Mitridate, he worked with such fluency and rapidity that his hand used to hurt at the end of the day. Leopold prevented him from burning out, refusing to let him work after meals, and instead taking the young boy out for a walk to refresh his mind and energies.

Unchecked and inexhaustible spontaneous creativity was already then in Mozart's teens, a major force of his composing. And if this was the true, indelible, mark of his ""genius"", it should be respected and lauded. Leopold, who was an expert musician in his own right, didn't dare to rewrite his son's work, and found Mitridate an excellent opera.

ABERT STILL AVERSE TO RESPECTING THE UNIQUE CREATIVITY OF MOZART'S GENIUS

Ironically, Abert shares the Romantic image of the ""genius"" as an outworldly artist who follows his own artistic urges, nearly always in battle with his philistine social environment. For the Romantics, Mozart's life was elevated and revered as the emblematic example of genius against society -- an iconic figure driven by an inner engine and fueled by a personal flame expressing his miraculous creativity. The script is always ""Extraordinary Creativity Triumphing over Conformity""

From a purely musical perspective, Hermann Abert's analysis is incomparable.
The great and conscientious Abert had already dismissed as simplistic this view of Mozart as ""growing"" into his final phase, instead substituting a clear analysis of various styles developing through the accidents of Mozart's life, and the influences of his models and mentors.

In fact, a lot of the gaiety, charm, inexpressible longing, and iridescent atmosphere of the music in Mozart's younger years was never recaptured later during the Vienna decade, when Mozart had to tackle on his own the new problems of survival in adult life -- domestic, economic, emotional, and professional.

But it is annoying to see Abert distributing compliments and criticisms to Mozart's music from the top of his pontifical academic chair that only reflect his own personal standards and biases of the time. He is always lauding Mozart whenever he finds unified thematic development, but mercilessly criticizing Mozart for his instinctive and irresistible compulsion to introduce new ideas and unexpected new themes and motifs, which happens in many places in Mitridate.

So Abert failed to be consistent with his own concept of ""genius"" -- an artist being his only own rule-giver. Abert erected himself as the final judge of ""quality"" as soon as Mozart's musical composition didn't exactly correspond to Abert's own academic expectations.

Abert, a strong ""System 2"" disciplinarian (in the same mold as Mozart's father, Leopold), was not plugged into this absolute freedom of ""System 1"" music ""flowing like oil"". Whereas Mozart always allowed himself to be freely guided by his instinct, with complete self-confidence in his natural creativity.

ETERNAL THANKS AND GLORY TO PONNELLE FOR HIS INDEFATIGABLE LOVE OF MOZART'S OPERAS

We are lucky that Ponnelle so much loved Mitridate that he staged it and filmed it in the most sumptuous decor in the Western world, the Teatro Olimpico in Vicenza, and that he rightly selected the unforgettable Gsta Winbergh for the title role.
The performances of all those supreme singers treating us with the enchanting vocal music created by an incomparable genius, are a feast to the ear.
And so we are extremely lucky to have in this Ponnelle-Harnoncourt version of Mitridate on DG a great iconic DVD, that can serve as a marvelous introduction to ""opera seria"".

Ponnelle ambitioned to produce all of Mozart's operas. We got his ""Idomeneo"", and his ""Clemenza di Tito"", but it is our loss that he died accidently before he could give us his own version of the last of the four great ""opera serias"" of Mozart, ""Lucio Silla"".
