8211577,3,B000TZC6MG,"Great film. Several minutes of the Spanish  subtitles are missing.  If you need to understand  the psychology of a transgender child or the situation  the family goes through,  watch it.

  I would rate it 5 stars if it didn't  have the subtitles problem. It caused me problems with my students.",1469059200,,295,4.74

8211579,5,B000TZC6MG,"Very tender portrayal of a little seven year old girl trapped in a boy's body.  There are moments of laughter and sadness as the cross dressing boy creates disturbances in school and his neighborhood.  The reaction of his best friends parents was priceless when he said he was going to marry him!  That was a ""gut buster"". LOL
I only wish that the movie was dubbed in English.  The movie only comes in Spanish subtitles or English subtitles.  Check to make sure you are ordering the correct language version of the movie.",1416960000,,521,4.619565217391305
8211580,5,B000TZC6MG,"Some children are born knowing who they are, but convincing the rest of the world that who they are is okay can seem an unwinnable fight. Seven year old Ludo approaches the fight with charm, determination, and sanguinity. A Truly Beautiful film about a difficult subject.",1402272000,,271,4.913043478260869
8211581,5,B000TZC6MG,"Given recent news story about the young transgendered girl in Colorado (national press, an appearance on Katie Couric's daytime talk show, etc.) this movie is both timely AND timeless.  The transgendered have been with us always, and at all ages.  Sadly, they are usually painfully closeted by the bigotry that surrounds them, subject to bullying, Bible-thumping and vicious assault, and prey to self-loathing, substance abuse and suicide.  Just Google ""Ben Brownlee,"" ""Angie Zapata"" or ""Gwen Araujo,"" or visit Wikipedia's ""List of unlawfully killed transgender people"" to learn more.

Thankfully, we're beginning to see more and more people, from parents to employers and school administrators to providers like the Girl Scouts, recognizing and accepting these unique souls for who and what they are, and making every effort to support them as they maneuver the convoluted path to self-acceptance, wholeness and appropriate gender representation.

All of that is a prelude to lauding this foreign-language film for its sensitive, humorous and uplifting depiction of a transgendered child, his baffled but loving parents, and the less-kind world in which they live.  Young Ludovic, born male, insists that he will grow up to be a woman, marry a boy and live happily ever after.  His parents are supportive, to a point, but at a loss to explain or amend their child's behavior and flights of fancy.  As the larger world presses in with all its homophobia and single-minded hatred, the child's family is faced with difficult choices and painful challenges.  Will love prevail?  Will hope?  Will an innocent child's rose-colored dreams?

Whether you are interested in transgender issues, or just seeking a well-made, wryly comic and heartwarming film, I heartily recommend Ma Vie en Rose.",1363392000,3,1785,5.335714285714285
