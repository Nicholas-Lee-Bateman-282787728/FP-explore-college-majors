7313594,5,B010LY9JUQ,"The movie was well made. I'm not a huge fan of MH but caught myself watching and even singing the songs afterward. It was definitely different and the musical aspect really appealed to my daughter as she loves music! It kept the attention of even my son while watching in the car traveling over the holidays.

We have watched this now many times and each time my daughter picks up on something new in the movie. It has a really nice message as well. It even prompted my daughter to ask me questions and turned into a really nice conversation about life.

My only con is small. Some of the other ghouls that she is used to seeing didn't have such large roles as in the past. She was sort of disappointed about it but was overshadowed by the introduction of new ghouls. She loved the new characters!

Overall, we really love the movie and my daughter asks to watch the movie frequently. She's watched this movie more than the previous MH movies. Love it!!",1451865600,,953,4.434285714285714

7313634,5,B010LY9JUQ,"Ever since the Monster High series switched over to full length features from the shorts they use to do we have been watching. I haven't seen one I didn't like yet. I was wondering how this one would turn out. I DVR'd it for my daughter and we sat down to watch it. I was pleasantly surprised. The music was pretty good throughout. For the series first musical I was curious how the music would go. The series has two really catchy theme songs, and with each movie I always look forward to hearing what kind of song will be on the opening.

We also bought the soundtrack on iTunes for my daughters iPod.

Not going to go into the story. If you are unsure just DVR it off Nickelodeon and then decide for yourself. That's the nice thing about this series now they stream the movie over cable before you buy it.",1446249600,,808,4.2745098039215685

7313642,5,B010LY9JUQ,"I actually got a chance to watch this movie before it premiered in the U.S, so if you love MH this is another MUST HAVE in your collection. I'm not really the musical type, but every song is worth listening to.  I also can't wait because there's another movie that is going to come straight to DVD soon.",1445558400,,303,4.224137931034483

7313644,3,B010LY9JUQ,"My daughter and I are huge fans of Monster High; however, this movie seems to be created by someone different than the artist in the past.  The girls were slightly different - Cleo had Blue Hair and Nefrha had Green Hair; however, if you look at movies in the past and the dolls that we have it is different - so it was hard to keep up with who was who on this movie.  The music was GREAT!",1445472000,,389,3.9743589743589745

7313655,4,B010LY9JUQ,"My daughter really enjoyed this movie she's a big fan of monster high. I was a bit skeptical because it is a ""musical"" however it wasn't over the top so I didn't mind watching it with her.",1444003200,,188,4.108108108108108
7313656,2,B010LY9JUQ,"The kids like this fine.  However, the disc itself seems to be programmed strangely.  On our Pioneer Blue Ray player we can't get it to play.  You get through the previews, and it just locks into a loop of stills with music that is impossible to get out of.  You see the menu for a second, but the disc won't respond.  All other Blu Rays work on this player.  Kids aren't that disappointed to watch the DVD in that room, but it's frustrating that a such shoddy programming would make it into production. Also, no way to skip ads at front of disc, which is equally annoying.",1443916800,,573,4.308411214953271

My girls thought it was a little odd to see Deuce singing!! All in all it is a great Monster High movie with a fun plot, a musical message, and saving the world!",1443657600,3,292,4.140350877192983
7313664,5,B010LY9JUQ,"I watched the movie on Netflix and loved it. Hope lots of new dolls come from it. The art work and story is great. I love cleos new hair! Long story short. . . Catty gave up being famous to learn to sing from the heart. Cleos family has to go to Boo York because of the coming comet from their scaritage. Cleo invites all her friends. Catty looks for inspiration and finds the musically talented Pharoah to guide her. A promise has to be made under the comet, while Neferah and Toralei are up to no good. Can the ghouls of Monster High and their new friends make it through Boo York without disaster and the world coming to an end?",1443571200,4,631,4.180327868852459
7313665,4,B010LY9JUQ,"First, I'm downloading the movie as I'm writing. Second, something happen delay my Blu-ray/DVD copy. Amazon must have done priority replacement because the order had USPS tracking number that should have arrived the 29th but instead came UPS today the 30th. So I had to wait an extra day for both. Not the end of world. So, please stop with the 1 star review on avaliblity, and let's talk movie.

I love that MH is really trying something different with these movie and a MH musical hits on high note. All the usual tropes are here making it an unmistakable MH outing. No spoilers on story, but if you've enjoyed all movies with the ghouls add to that a healthy mix of pop music this dose not disappont. The Blu-ray looks better than the previous movies.  The tunes are catchy and only really seemed a bit shoehorned in during the Due/Cleo scene.

Like said said no spoilers but everything you expect the featured characters to be are, especially Toralei. The new ghouls are fun though seem a bit far out from traditional ""Monster"" ghouls. Nefera makes a great baddie that you really appreciate her rare appearances.

The two biggest downsides are that Frankie, Howleen, Draculara, and Operetta are pretty much there just because it is a MH movie. None of them really don't really add anything as who they are and easily have had four other ghouls I'm there place, but as a MH movie Frankie, Clawdeen, and Draculaura have to be there even if as background. Other then the ghouls I'm kind of disappointed that we only got original songs. My favorite musical bit from MH is by far Catty's version of Magic Carpet from the end of 13 wishes. A good spoof of a recognizable pop would have great, but here we don't even get MH version of New York New Your which seemed like a cheap "" we don't want pay to use"" from Mattle. Shame on them.

Last thing to be sure to mention. The disc dose have the extra feature of Spring Unsprung from Ever After High. If you follow that series you probably already seen it, but make a fun kind of double feature.

Now that it is released and we can stop moaning about shipping, or digital avaliblity I say Boo York Boo York did a fine job telling a MH story without making fell like a been there scared that like the last couple of movies have. After this I am looking forward to see what is coming next in the MH world.",1443571200,,2347,4.433874709976799
7313666,5,B010LY9JUQ,"For those complainers, Netflix has it now when you search under ""Boo York,"" and not ""Monster High."" Watched it twice today. I love Catty Noir getting more time and the inclusion of many new characters really feels like the MH world is getting bigger all the time. Boo York is AWESOME!!! The songs are perfectly set to each scene and the songs themselves can be played over and over again. Sooooooo much better than Frozen and I looooooooooooooooooove Frozen so much I have bought tickets to see it on ice years in advance. I will be purchasing the soundtrack for my car.",1443571200,,570,4.598039215686274
