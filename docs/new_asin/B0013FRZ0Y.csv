If Misty Mundae wasn't so delicious, it would have no value at all.  I own this title simply to own it.  The one time I have watched it will almost certainly be the last.

3105835,4,B0013FRZ0Y,"So, the fabled `Vampire Strangler' gets the special edition treatment. For those who don't know, this is softcore superstar, Misty Mundae's only ""hardcore"" film. However, be warned: if you are not a Misty Mundae fan, this film will not interest you in the slightest. If you are looking for a good hardcore movie, again, you need to look elsewhere: this is not a film that you will want to buy on a whim. It's a very low-budget affair complete with shoddy camera work and rotten acting.

If you already own the `Ultra-Naughty' DVD (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Misty-Mundae-in-Vampire-Strangler-Unrated-Uncut-Region-1-Ntsc/dp/B0010V81H2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Misty Mundae in Vampire Strangler Unrated Uncut Region 1 Ntsc</a>), is it worth getting this new edition? Well, yes it is if you're interested in the additional material. This new edition contains a re-edited version of the film with the hardcore scenes incorporated into the main feature. The previous version only had these as bonus material. The new edit gives the film a running time of 88 minutes; the previous version's running time was 54 minutes. There is little discernable improvement in picture quality from the originally issued material.

Some stock footage of eastern European street scenes has been added to give the impression that Lydia (Misty Mundae) hails from Transylvania. Additional material has also been added to the scene where Lydia is woken up by something. In the new version, a projector suddenly appears and begins showing an 8mm black and white film of a couple having sex. The original sequence saw Lydia getting out of bed to check the door before returning to bed. This sequence does not appear in the new version.

On the second DVD in this set, the `Vampire Strangler' related extras consist of isolated erotic scenes (these are the deleted scenes as per the original Ultra-Naughty edition) and the original `lost' opening scene. I don't know why this scene was not edited into the restored version, but it does answer something that has puzzled me. The original opening credits list six performers: Misty Mondae [sic], Benny the Stain (aka Joey Smack), Stella Axelstar, Michi, Freak Nasty and Sonny Alacard. However, only four people appear in the film. Well, this original opening involves those missing cast members, but Misty does not appear in this scene. Incidentally, the fourth cast member from the original issue is Lily Tiger. Her presence in `Vampire Strangler' is never explained. While Johnnie (William Hellfire) and Lydia are doing their thing, Lily watches and becomes so aroused that she indulges herself in some minor hanky-panky with the doorframe!

The lovely Lily also appears in one of the DVD's bonus films, `The Vibrating Maid'. This seems like an odd choice for a bonus item since it's already available with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lust-in-the-Mummy-s-Tomb/dp/B000077W1A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lust in the Mummy's Tomb</a>&nbsp;and `The Inn of 1000 Sins'. I would have thought that something a little harder to find such as `Peeping in a Girl's Dormitory' would have been a more interesting choice. Another bonus film is `My Date With Misty Mundae'. Again an odd choice since it can also be found on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Girl-Seduction-A-Collection-of-Misty-Mundae-Featurettes-1997-2002/dp/B00012FXTA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Girl Seduction: A Collection of Misty Mundae Featurettes 1997-2002</a>&nbsp;and it is incorporated into the storyline in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vampire-Vixens-Region-2/dp/B000096KIW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vampire Vixens [Region 2</a>] and in the same title  in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Misty-Mundae-Euro-Vixen-Collection/dp/B0009Y275I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Misty Mundae Euro-Vixen Collection</a>. However, the version on the new `Vampire Strangler' DVD is a little longer and has a ""something for the ladies"" moment when more of Misty's co-star, Mike Stefano, is exposed during the phone-sex scene than previous issues of this film have shown.

Of more interest to Misty fans is a short (approximately eight minutes), previously unseen film called `My Property'. This was shot in 1998 for the never completed `Hotel Asphyxia' and has Misty paired with William Hellfire for some nasty naughtiness. It's a pity that more unseen Misty footage could not have appeared as bonus material: surely there must be plenty in existence.

There are a number of trailers for upcoming releases including several Factory 2000 films that have never been issued on DVD, trailers for some retro hardcore titles are also included. The package is rounded off with a booklet containing liner notes and photographs from the production. The picture that accompanies Amazon's listing is taken from the slipcase. The pictures that grace the front and back covers of the DVD case are slightly more risque with Misty wearing a vampire cape and not much else in poses that recall Lina Romay in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Female-Vampire/dp/6305943613/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Female Vampire</a>.

Unfortunately, no documentary material is included in the bonus material. An interview with William Hellfire or a commentary track could have been very interesting. There are some quotes from Hellfire in the liner notes, though.

`Vampire Strangler' is not a good film. Its infamous content may lure the unwary into thinking that this Factory 2000 production above all others pushes the exploitative envelope furthest. This is not the case. You need only to look at the Factory 2000 trailers on this DVD to see that their in-your-face sex and violence scenarios have a much nastier edge with softcore material compared to `Vampire Strangler' with its hardcore, but actually quite mellow content. There is only one reason for obtaining this DVD: Misty Mundae. The fact of the matter is that had Misty's later career in exploitation movies not blossomed, then this film would have been long forgotten. For Misty's disciples, any previously unseen material is always welcome. The film itself is worth three stars for Misty, but the small amount of additional material just about bumps the whole package up to four stars.",1206057600,39,6447,5.946062567421791
3105836,3,B0013FRZ0Y,"""Misty in her only adult role."" Such is the boast that has given `Vampire Strangler' its near legendary status among Misty Mundae fans.

Directed by William Hellfire, this is, even by the standards of Factory 2000, a shoestring-budget effort. The film opens with Lydia (Misty Mundae) taking a bath. She falls asleep, and a man in a cape enters. She awakens and seems to invite him to attack her. He strangles her and she apparently dies. Only of course, she doesn't; she wakes up. This `was it a dream' device is used a number of times in this film, leaving the viewer thoroughly bewildered. Soon Lydia is speaking to her cousin Johnnie (William Hellfire) and we discover that she is Transylvanian and about to visit him in America. There follows a series of sex scenes interspersed with some none too convincing strangling. That's it really. The picture quality ranges from indifferent to poor, as does the acting. There are a few scenes that suffer from some abrupt editing although it's difficult to know whether this was deliberate or just incompetent.

So, what's all the fuss about? Well, the most jaw-dropping moments occur in the deleted scenes. There are no hardcore scenes of penetration, but there is some unsimulated oral action. Hellfire also indulges in some rather intimate finger work on Misty. That's it, really. We're not talking movie greatness here, but devoted Misty fans will obviously want to own a copy of this film.",1200787200,6,1440,4.897540983606557

8250733,2,B0013FRZ0Y,"I should have known better because...The movie was shot by factory 2000 which as far as I know has never had a descent film produced and has terrible camera work..
I should have known better because ...Wm Hellfire chose to use himself as a main character actor. He was the boy friend of Misty and her sister. But this guy is so homely,skinny, and hairy and then groping and having real sex with the young Misty is almost too much to bear.

I should have known better because... this is advertised as ""Misty's porn film"" when it isn't at all. Other than some gross oral sex, there is nothing to indicate that this is a porn film. In porn the camera views are especially important and at least 3 cameras are used from different POVs..This looked like it was shot with a VCR camera and was so fuzzy that hardly anything is seen. There are no orgasms after the sex but worst of all is the fact that Misty was just 18 and they all were drunk. Misty never was under the idea that this would ever be releasd and when she became a star, Hellfire sold the rights.

The only saving grace is seen in a short called ""My private thing"" or something like that where Misty suffocates Hellfire with a pillow. Here we see the musculature of a well built young girl in athletic terms. Misty, 5'7, was quite muscular as her shoulders and arms were large but without fat. Her back is the most impressive part as she demonstrated the powerful back muscles of an athlete. Her back is ""v"" shaped and her buttucks are big and strong as are her upper legs. The number of films where Misty is tossed around by smaller, weaker womwen is a joke. The movie ""Splatter Beach"" where there is no nudity also shows that she has large shoulders and big thighs. Her waist is small giving her the shape that we all love.

IMO the sad part is that this short interlude is possibly what held Misty back from being a mainstream star. The has great looks when she is in shape (like the film ""Chantel""), the natural body (no plastic surgery or breast implants),and her georgeous face and acting ability would have been irresistable for many directors. But the call never came and it may have been due to the label of former porn star which is anathemic in Hollywood

The saving grace is the fact that we got enough interviews in tte ""extras""(that simply are never done in Hollywood) so we get an idea of knowing her somewhat. The interviews however got more and more unenthusiastic and until her last one (after Lust for Dracula) seemed like a girl that was totally burned out. She stated that she was desperately homesick after being in LA for only 3 days. That movie, made in conjuncture with Chantal, were the last films she made as the leading lady. Her nervous breakdown during the shooting of Chantel also probably had something to do with her descision",1306022400,9,2817,4.464077669902912
8250734,2,B0013FRZ0Y,Vampire Strangler is one of the early films of Misty Mundae when she was working for Factory 2000. This film is like a mix of Last House on the Left with vampires. Truthfully it's not a very good movie. Basically the only reason to actually watch this movie is to see Misty Mundae perform nude throughout the film and surprisingly she has some explicit sex scenes in this video as well. So I recommend Vampire Strangler only to Misty Mundae fans or horndogs that wanna see naked chicks and some explicit sex.,1291680000,,508,4.532608695652174
