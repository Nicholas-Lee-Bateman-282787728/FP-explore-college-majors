It arrived much earlier than the earliest expected arrival date, so when i came home and saw it sitting on the kitchen table, I screamed. I've been wanting this DVD for a long time, and now that I have it, it's even cooler than I thought it would be. Absolutely no complaints here!",1390867200,,341,4.34375

Photobook: Contains a few photos of each featured member except Henry and Zhou Mi (and the ones that were in the army at the time this was made.)

Now, on to the main part of the review... Loved it. These guys really know how to make the audience happy. The first few songs get you really pumped up since they are so full of energy. I love how they transition into some of the slower songs and then into some goofy ones. These guys are real professionals. They know exactly when to act cool and when to have fun. There performances are fantastic. They'll having you dancing to their fast upbeat songs one minute (Opera, Mr. Simple, A-Cha, Bonamana, etc), then sending you into stitches the next moment when they are all cosplaying (Good Friends and Pajama Party) or just goofying around (Walkin and Do-Re-Mi). I've never enjoyed a concert on DVD as much as this one. Truly amazing in every sense. Definitely worth every penny.

Recommended for any ELF or anyone interested in K-Pop.",1383436800,4,2295,4.494004796163069
