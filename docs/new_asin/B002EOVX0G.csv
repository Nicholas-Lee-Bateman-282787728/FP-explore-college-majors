8367916,2,B002EOVX0G,Good acting but I'm sorry I wasted my time watching this movie.,1503360000,,63,4.333333333333333
8367917,5,B002EOVX0G,"I picked up this movie @ a video store in Austin based on the cover. Had to know who this character was! Immediately after watching, I bought it online. My god, this is a perfect movie. The irony of adults acting out teenage insecurities, the anxiety-inducing hilarity of the pacing, jean on jean & patterned turtle necks. Some scenes reminded me of ""Welcome to the Dollhouse,"" like when Gretchen is on the corded phone talking to a boy and her mom is in the kitchen, elated at the sweet idea of a boyfriend for her daughter, completely unsuspecting of the adult nature of the call.  The mom, Becky Ann Baker, plays the SAME kind of mom she does in Freaks & Geeks. Warm, understanding, desperate to save her daughter from the pain of adulthood.

I think what this film does so well, what makes it different, is that its just as sad as it is hysterical. I hurt so badly at times in this movie for Gretchen, but that doesn't stop me from pointing & laughing. The settings are also great - the way Gretchen's mother's house feels like a comfortable cage, her father's house feels like a squatter's, the restaurant she temporarily works at is as pathetic seeming as her attempt to fit in there, the ""rave"" club is as elementary & hopeless as her escape, etc. The character's wardrobes are just fun. I don't know what year we're living in during this movie, but it doesn't matter.

This movie gave me alot of feelings, more than Gretchen, probably. And it took me days to shake them. I can't wait to see Courtney Davis again in another Steve Collins flick, ""You Hurt My Feelings"" - I suggested it to be ordered to my local video store.",1418083200,,1630,4.481481481481482

8367919,4,B002EOVX0G,"I went to high school with some of the principle individuals in this movie (Courtney Davis, John Merriman and Caroline Mithoff)and was curious to see and support their artistic endeavour.  After all, who wouldn't want to help out the people who beat you up for your lunch money, stuck you in lockers, made fun of you every chance they got which culminated in the pouring of pig's blood on you at prom leaving you a broken and twisted mess of a human being?

Nah, I'm just kidding.  They were cool people when we shared Dr. Case's senior IB English class.  But I digress.  Onto the film review...

I got to tell you, I like this film.  Even though I'm into more dark subject matter and overt comedies, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and found myself pulling for Gretchen to break herself free from her self-destructive tendencies in choosing loser boyfriends (I'm not sure if this is partly because of my acquaintence with Courtney...still debating that).  The film reveals perhaps why Gretchen does fall for these types (introducing her absent father) and shows her attempts to get to know him by getting a job at his place of business (a hamburger stand).  Despite all the things bearing down on her and her own timid nature working against her, Gretchen finally learns to stand up for herself (with the help of Mom) against Ricky (her cheating boyfriend) and Nick (her side interest).

The DVD also includes 3 short films (2 with Gretchen as the subject) which provide background on Gretchen.  All in all a very enjoyable and entertaining film I would recommend to anyone who ever felt on the outside looking in.  Way to go Courtney, John and Caroline!  Now, you promised not to beat me up anymore if I wrote you guys a positive review.  Please guys, the doctors said I can't lose anymore blood.  I've already had my entire supply changed 3 times because of your pummelings!",1340496000,,1876,4.6941896024464835
8367920,4,B002EOVX0G,"i saw this movie on television once, and i just knew that i needed to own it! i gave it as a gift to my cousin, and he loves it too! it's a family favorite.",1327536000,,156,3.4857142857142858
8367921,4,B002EOVX0G,"Gretchen is one of those films that even adults can admire, despite the fact it focuses around the daily life of a confused teenager.

Gretchen is the main character- she's a teenage girl who is extremely shy and has trouble communicating with her classmates as a result (especially her boyfriend) and she has remarkably low self-esteem too.

She absolutely loves her boyfriend, but... apparently he doesn't feel the same way about her (since soon after the movie kicks in, he's caught cheating on Gretchen outside with another girl behind a building, and so eventually a confrontation between the girl and Gretchen occurs. From here, the storyline kicks in and...

I was never really sure what the storyline is supposed to be about! It's basically total fluff- the entire movie.  Nothing truly remarkable occurs, like, ever.  However, perhaps the fact Gretchen's character is such an outcast and never feels like she belongs to any particular crowd is the reason the film kept my attention, because after she gets sent to a special school for troubled teens, she gets involved in the wrong crowd *again*.

Basically Gretchen has a terrible and uninspiring life, and even though there's not much taking place as far as compelling storyline development is concerned, there's definitely *something* appealing about this film. There's also a message (perhaps intentional) that all men are total scumbags. At least, the movie writers made it seem that way.

Overall, good acting, but constant emptiness in the storyline leading to plenty of unmemorable and pointless segments is what one can expect while watching Gretchen... but I still really liked it. I just can't explain why.  The ending should have been better, I believe.",1309392000,,1724,5.132142857142857
8367922,5,B002EOVX0G,"I got to see this movie at a festival in New York.  I didn't know what to expect, and was totally delighted by it.  It's definitely an off-beat film, with stylized performances and a funky, Austin TX vibe.  But when it comes down to it, the film is incredibly poignant and sweet in how it tells the story of the title character, a teen girl struggling with typical teen issues in a very untypical way.  If you liked ""Welcome to the Dollhouse,"" you will definitely like ""Gretchen"" though I think Gretchen herself is a much more sympathetic and appealing character, and this movie -- while just as bitterly funny as ""Dollhouse"" -- has a good deal more pathos and sincerity.",1257379200,5,671,4.566666666666666
8367923,5,B002EOVX0G,This is a great movie.  It's unusual - and original - and extremely funny.  I loved it.,1256688000,3,87,4.0588235294117645
