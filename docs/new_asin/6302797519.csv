The film never becomes maudlin or overly sentimental, though in another director's hand that might have happened.  It simply tells the story the way Conrad told it.

511364,4,6302797519,"Lord Jim: ""I've been a so-called coward and a so-called hero and there's not the thickness of a sheet of paper between them. Maybe cowards and heroes are just ordinary men who, for a split second, do something out of the ordinary. That's all."" I saw this film right after it was released in 1965 and loved it. I still do; but it got a bum rap from the critics initially and didn't do well at the box office. It got some awards recognition by the British in the BAFTA's, but was shut out on this side of the pond. It is adapted from Joseph Conrad's 1900 book of the same name which was written as a psychological study of a young merchant seaman, Jim Burke, who, forced to deal with his act of cowardice aboard the merchant ship, Patna, seeks to redeem himself. Director Richard Brooks does a good job in portraying the psychological conflicts of Jim; but he also drifts a bit into epic storytelling...which is why I haven't awarded the film 5 stars. But it is still and excellent movie, filmed in Super Panavision and has stunning cinematography. O'Toole, as with many of his other films of this period delivers a magnificent performance as Jim...and he has stated this was his favorite film role. The film has good action sequences and a moving love story. Performances by Eli Wallach and James Mason are colorful and solid, and Daliah Lavi is gorgeous in her role, which is more substantive than any of her other film roles. I love Peter O'Toole's films from this period and this one is almost as good as the best of them. Highly recommended!",1445299200,8,1544,4.517857142857143
511365,4,6302797519,"This is an excellent story by a great and insightful writer.  Peter O'Toole's performance is excellent.  The photography and locations are lush and colorful, sharply focused.

511370,4,6302797519,"This movie is a classic.  It is unlike any other movie that I have ever seen and as such stands apart from other movies.  This movie is certainly not of the 'video game' genre that is so prevalent in today's movie cinema where a weak plot is upstaged and compensated by continuous super-human special effects.  This movie is a thinker.  As such, it causes the viewer to contemplate the intricacies of human nature, human failure, the corresponding consequences of an unwise spontaneous decision, and the desire to hide and run from the past by loosing oneself in an unfamiliar place.  How does good character fit within the consequences of a bad decision?  How can this man ever find purpose; how can he find redemption?

Loved Deliah Lavi, since her later role in Casino Royale (1967). Can you believe she entered acting after her service in the Israeli military?

I was a bit dubious about buying the dvd as Amazon stated that the aspect ratio on the dvd sold by Mill Creek was 1:1.33. I am happy to report that the film is widescreen in its original aspect ratio of 1:2.20. The picture and sound quality are very good, not fantastic. I thoroughly enjoyed the film and the viewing experience. The price of the dvd makes it an absolute bargain.

Amazon have now amended their description to show the correct aspect ratio.",1418774400,2,572,4.386792452830188
511444,5,6302797519,"I saw this film in a theater as soon as it was released in St. Paul, and suddenly a summer day in my hometown became a place of mystery, adventure, amazement. Yes, thast's what I got from it, Jim, on the other hand, got disgrace, humiliation and profound loneliness. Joseph Conrad had scoured the Malay Archipelago in the Merchangt Marine; he knew the realities of the rain forest, the isolated cultures, the lack of western sophisticaton. Henry James wrote novels contrastng
Europeans and Americans, both groups modern westerners; Conrad contrasted two alien races. You could say there was a romantic impulse in both Conrad and his characters that was slamming against an intractable realism. It is to Conrad's credit that the
realism prevails. The same cannot be said about Richard Brooks's film adaptation. On seeing it again, I was uncomfortably aware of seeing TREASURE ISLAND with an all adult cast, even a sexy tropical romance thrown in. More importantly, if Conrad's readers learn anything about the geography of this region it is that it is a Muslim Sea. So why did Brooks  place displaced Buddhist monks in the Malayan rain forest? Are they more exotic, better movie subjects, pacifists, etc.? I admit I am being harsh, because the film makes for great escapist entertainment in the ORIENTALIST MODE that Edward Saiid was to expose in a famous book years
later. That's the real problem: Conrad wrote a profound novel of westerners confronting their ignorance of most of the world. Late
in the novel, Marlowe, Conrad's narrator, runs into a brash, young super confident AMERICAN sailor, who tells the sober, cautious Englishman, Americans will rule the world of the future. At least, that's how this ignorant prophet of worse things to come strikes the reader. Do you think that sailor could tell the difference between a Buddhist and a Muslim? Would he care? How about an American military advisor leading native forces to a stunning victory against his/our - ""enemy""?  SAND PEBBLES with Steve McQueen was not as well made a film about westerns bustling in Asia, but at least it got the dirty politics right. By the way, the actual novel by Conrad has none of these shortcomings. It is beautifully written and profoundly moving, and tells the truth about
Southeast Asia.",1417478400,,2281,4.968586387434555
511445,5,6302797519,"This is a little known film apparently based on Joseph Conrad's book ""Heart of Darkness""  . The film is amazing in many respects such as the acting, the plot, and the scenery.  The actors do a first- rate job of convincing performances and deserved Academy Awards !! This is a movie one would want to watch over and over and involves the plot of a British Naval officer making a serious mistake in judgement in his early life and trying to attone for it the rest of his life.",1416700800,,475,4.325842696629214
511446,4,6302797519,"LORD JIM is an elegant and underrated film made early in Peter O'Toole's career, shortly after LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, a masterpiece that overshadowed much of O'Toole's later work.  The film LORD JIM, perhaps more than Conrad's novel, is a respectful portrayal of the detachment and determination that characterize the practice of Buddhism.  LORD JIM's photography is pretty if pedestrian.  The sound track, however, is a delight:  jingling bells intermingled with percussive cadences energize scene after scene; each word of the script is audible, crisp, even when whispered.  Among an international cast's panoply of able performances, James Mason's canny rogue is an especially unsettling foil for Peter O'Toole's idealistic officer.  If nothing else, Conrad's subtle narrative makes LORD JIM worth sitting through:  it's a story about a man who flees when he must remain, but who later redeems himself by remaining when he might flee.  The novel's Victorian admonition that life without honor is worthless eschews the lawless heroes who populate Modern fiction.",1414800000,5,1061,5.506172839506172

511526,5,6302797519,"This is an excellent movie based on the Josef Conrad novel of the same name. The main theme of the movie is how one man can face his fear and how he deals with it. In the movie it mentions several times the main character (Jim played by Peter O'Toole) facing his fear in certain situations. At first he fails to meet his fear successfully (he succumbs to the fear), and the action of his succumbing to his fear in that particular situation follows him around wherever he goes. The situation repeats itself later in the movie where Jim successfully faces his fear this time. It is an excellent movie. The only change I would've liked to have seen would be for Jim to have just killed the river pirates he had trapped who were trying to negotiate with him for their freedom. He should've listened to the village chief and killed all the river pirates, for a much simpler and effective solution. Its an excellent movie, and the story is excellent, and the point the movie and the book are trying to make about facing one's fears was excellently expressed in the movie and book as well.",1400544000,4,1082,4.46969696969697

This one was made a few years after Peter O'Toole won one of the seven Oscars awarded to Lawrence of Arabia.  Alas, this picture is no Lawrence, but we get to see young O'Toole play another moody man seeking redemption.  O'Toole does this part so well, the picture gets four of five stars.  O'Toole also plays in Murphy's War (1971)as a lone survivor of a ship sunk by a Nazi U Boat and he sets out to sink it.  It seems his roles were typecast after Lawrence of Arabia, but the scripts didn't get much better for him for a long while.
O'Toole's character Jim begins as a narrative by Jack Hawkins, telling us of Jim's potential to rise to great expectations.  Like many hopes and dreams of youth, Jim's takes a turn when he is faced with a moment of cowardice while serving as the first mate on the S.S. Patna; an aging vessel carrying Muslims traveling to Mecca as it's cargo.  A simular incident was known to Conrad in 1880 when he heard of the S.S. Jeddah also abandoned by it's British crew during bad weather.  The Jeddah was rescued by a French ship and towed to shore, just as the Patna was rescued and waiting in port when Jim and the crew of the Patna came ashore in their life boat.  Disgrace came to the crew of the Jeddah just as it did to Jim.  I suppose the reason I did not give Lord Jim five stars is because of this second part of the movie when Jim attempts to redeem himself through various self sacrificing deeds.  It's painful to watch as Jim goes through the inner torment that comes with dishonoring oneself and lives to regret it over and over again.  This fear and poor decision based on panic is what confronts every person at least once during thier life and only a few sieze the moment to bring honor instead of disgrace.  That's what forgiveness is for, but Jim seems never to learn this and move on.  Although it is very difficult to move on for many of us.  I told my son, before he left for the military that there is something worst than death, it is living without honor.  Lord Jim is what I think of as a man who lives without honor.  The other characters in the film (Jurgens, Mason, Wallach)  are the examples of men living without honor and finding reasons to stay in that dishonorable life, robbing others, lying, cheating, murdering.  Jim is on the other end of dishonor, trying to make up for it by his good deeds.  All the while secretly suicidal, knowing he can never live up to the measure he has placed in front of him that will erase his past deed of dishonor, always threatening to reveal his true character.  In the end he gives into his fear of discovery and allows dishonorable men to challenge him for what they want most; the gold in the village-the love of money is the root of all evil.  And Jim trys to get what he wants most; a chance to be a hero and redeem himself-pride comes before a fall.  You can guess what happens without me telling you.  Neither gets what they want in the end.  A familiar tale.  One that we all know to be painful to watch in others, let alone live it in ourself.  It is a well done movie and O'Toole seems to be well suited for these roles.  If you are young (younger than I) then you may not find this movie to be as gut wrenching as I did.  If you have not found forgiveness in this life, it will be equally disturbing for you.  Just know that forgiveness is available.  I hope you are open to it when it comes.",1275091200,4,3639,4.2748538011695905
511580,3,6302797519,"Lord Jim
 Jim (Peter O'Toole) is out to redeem himself after an act of cowardice.  He sets out in the hope of gaining a new life and ends up fighting smugglers and pirates in a desperate bid to forget his past.  James Mason, Eli Wallach, and Curt Jurgens play baddies and Jack Hawkins is the officer who sympathizes with Jim.  Is it too late for redemption and love, or will Jim prove a coward once again?

Violent Content
 The film includes many skirmishes and battles between natives and money hungry gun-runners.  Men are dispatched in many ways.  The natives throw spears.  Due to the fact that this is a sixties movie, the spears always pass under the persons arm or never actually pierce skin.  There is a lot of shooting.  A few people get strangled.  There are a few kick-boxing matches, and a man is slashed with a machete.
 The most disturbing scene of violence is saved for Jim himself.  He is tortured by bandits (mostly off-screen, but we see the build-up and the aftermath) and we watch his face as he screams in pain.  The scene is rather tame by todays standards, but some kids will be frightened.

Sexual Content
 Men are shown shirtless throughout the film.  Jim is shown swimming with naked children.  After torture fails, Eli Wallach's character pushes a beautiful woman in front of Jim, telling him that he may make love to her for the next hour.  He then forcibly rips open her shirt exposing her to Jim (we see her back and then her shoulders from the front, but no real nudity).  Jim refuses Wallach's offer, but later admits to the woman that he ""desired her"".

Language
 Terms such as ""damned"" and ""damnation"" are used in context, and hell is briefly referenced.

Morales
 Jim's morales are slightly amibiguous.  Many of the characters in the film seem to have a basic belief in a god of some kind.  Muslims are portrayed in a positive light.  Jim's search for redemption is the focal point of the story.  He refuses to sell out the natives despite being tortured.  Jim desires that ""God give him a second chance.""

 Lord Jim is based on a classic novel by Joseph Conrad.  It might have been better for the film if it had not been.  The film is too slow to be a good action movie, and has too much action to be a good thought-provoking film.  It follows the books plot loosely at best and for the most part, strays completely from it.  Peter O'Toole, James Mason and company all give good performances, there are some good scenes, and the action is well-handled, but over-all the film is lacking and will probably go down as a cheap imitation of Lawrence of Arabia.  The film is the equivalent of a modern PG-13, and will probably not offend most people, but is likely to bore little kids, teenagers, and many adults.  Plus, the dvd is VERY expensive.  Is the film worth it? Probably not.",1252454400,,2814,4.52988047808765
511581,3,6302797519,"It's still good, but at times hard to follow, and also incomplete in some areas. For example what were they fighting about? The film didn't go into good detail about what the fighting was about; was it religious? was it political? what what? The scenes were flawless, and the acting was rather good, and the chemistry between O'Toole, and the girl was splendid, but what was the fighting all about? I did get what the story was about, and that was about a man who needed a second chance to redeem himself after he blew it the first time around. The film stars Peter O' Toole as the main character of Lord Jim, and he was an officer in the British Navy, and he would end up being disgraced as a coward during a hurricane he instead of saving the passengers jumps with the rest of the crew. After being ousted by the British Navy he wanders for a period of time, and then fate brings him to an island that he's trying to open a trade route to, and he ends up leading a coup as a group of islanders(not New York mind you) are fighting against a corrupt group of pirates to bring law and order to their land, or so that's what I got out of the movie, and Lord Jim pays the ultimate price. This was still a good movie despite being hard to follow at times as it kept my interest going. Perhaps now I will venture into reading the book, and see if I can find out more about this story.",1249257600,3,1379,4.168539325842697
511582,4,6302797519,"Having read the novel before finally seeing this film in it's wide-screen format on DVD, I was expecting to be disappointed. Why?  Because it's very hard to capture Conrad's psychology of the main character, Jim, onto the big screen.  O'Toole comes very close in a very under-stated performance which ranks as one of his most under-rated in comparison to ""Lawrence of Arabia"" where he was much more flamboyant.  Here he displays his angst and deep disgust at himself for failing at a crucial moment in his life.  Richard Brooks is not David Lean but he is still a very good director and he stages the battle scenes effectively plus utilizing the Super-Panavision scope very well (I did manage to see a rare but badly discolored 70mm print of this film in Hollywood).  Plus the supporting cast is superb with an excellent James Mason as the devious Mr Brown a standout.

Filmed in Super Panavasion 70 on locations in South East Asia, the film looks breathtaking in this excellent DVD transfer that has been remastered in high definition.  Jack Hawkins narrates as well as appears (sadly, after he had had operations for throat cancer so his rich voice has lost some of its magic) and just when you think the story is reaching a conclusion, James Mason turns up for another chapter.  Bronislau Kaper's music score is one of the greats (also including lots of Asian gamelan instruments) and decades ago was a collector's item LP.  This anamorphic transfer recreates the visual impact of the film's initial theatrical release and the Dolby Digital sound is knockout.

511617,4,6302797519,"It was nice to watch this film again, an old friend from my teen years.  Fans of the novel know the story so I won't repeat it here.  The film is true to the book for the most part, with an altered ending that brings comprehendable closure.  Brooks' screenplay allows Jim redemption and purification through death, suitably in the Malay ritual of his adopted people, a nice touch.  I also took as a compliment to the story the stereotyped portrayal of the Malays, as a sort-of wallpaper for the European characters.  This captures the essence of Conrad and it was refreshing to see this in this 1965 pre-PC film.  I hate to think how a modern director would present this story; no doubt it would be transformed into ""Apocalypto"" or ""Dances With Wolves"", white-man-bad-brown-man-good.  Very un-Conrad.  I was struck by the similarities in music, set and overall feel to the Kurtz native army scenes from ""Apocalypse Now"", another Conrad-based story that obviously inspired Coppolla.  Overall, a 4-star film with beautiful photography, a good pace and well-developed characters.  A minor minus for me are O'Toole's effeminate mannerisms which I could accept in ""Lawrence"", true to the alleged sexual orientation of that character.  Here, they're simply annoying.",1207699200,2,1260,5.097560975609756

511620,1,6302797519,"I saw this film, but didn't watch it; I was too busy marking the wild and incomprehensible mangling of the book's ideas and characters.

I should've been clued in to the direction the movie was taking when Brooks displays Jim's romanticism early on by showing the equivalent of a cinematic thought balloon: O'Toole grinning idiotically as a scene of him rescuing some shipwrecked vixen on a raft plays in the background.

Conrad's robust existentialism is probably impossible to convey in film, and the disclaimer, ""Apapted From"", while caveat enough, perhaps to some, should've read ""Title Borrowed From""

since therein lies the only similarity. After the inquest scene the movie, already clumbsy, is a free and badly written improvisation. Think of an adaptation of 'Moby Dick' showing Ahab having a shoot-out with pirates in a saloon and then getting the girl. If the novel's ideas are like fully formed sentences, they are presented here as inarticulate half-words.

I know, the never was a movie made from a book that will please.

But this movie was not made from Conrad's novel, which really needs no defence as it, even with all its flaws, stands unassailable above this quotidian slander. So do yourself a favor and either don't read the book or don't watch the movie.

Apologies to Mr. Brooks, but this wasn't one of his better moments.",1157155200,8,1346,4.96
511621,5,6302797519,"Conrad's novel, like many he wrote, was on one level a ripping yarn, and on another, an exploration of the inner man.  The psychological aspect to the story, written at the turn of the twentieth century, heralded a new style of fiction.  This adds to its interest, although the heavily descriptive prose is an acquired taste.

It is the journey of a troubled outcast, roaming the South Seas in a time gone by, taking us through adventure and ending in redemption.  It is both glorious romance and personal enlightenment.  The novel opens with a description of the character, a manly seaman, dogged and taciturn, yet susceptible to deeper agony.  This was the essence of the story: the soul in tempest.

The picture is a very competent adaptation of the book, well written and filmed on location with an excellent cast.  Peter O'Toole is a fine actor and at this time was at the height of his powers.  He is more suited to playing eccentrics and had already defined Lawrence of Arabia on screen.  He might have been less convincing as Jim, but his performance was solid and sufficiently enigmatic to carry the role.

Like all good stories, it has a good ending.  While not a happy one, it is the most satisfying resolution of a tale you will ever get.  The written version is exquisite, and the film captures this beautifully.  You will never forget it.",1152403200,27,1352,4.673728813559322

511623,5,6302797519,"The key to enjoying Joseph Conrad's Lord Jim on screen is accepting the hero's personal standard at face value: ""if I lose without honor, then everything will have been for nothing."" We in the West often think of winning, often at all costs, and so to win with honor seems a noble goal. But what of losing without honor? Dramatizing this theme is what distinguishes this movie from practically every other film to come out of Hollywood. And Peter O'Toole's character enunciates this credo explicitly at the end of the movie, as he explains his decision not to run away from the consequences of his actions a second time.

The movie was beautifully photographed in Southeast Asia, the screenplay is articulate yet concise, and the acting is uniformly superb. Aside from O'Toole's subtle performance are first-rate contributions from Paul Lukas as the elderly trader who plays a father surrogate role to O'Toole's Jim, an understated Dalia Lavi as his love interest, Eli Wallach enjoying himself as a local warlord, and James Mason almost delectable as an English pirate. Often overlooked is Curt Jurgens, who turns in a quiet but powerful character study of a drunk filled with self-loathing, someone who foreshadows what Lord Jim would have been transformed into had he chose to run away.

511676,4,6302797519,"I had read where another reviewer stated an apt title for this film might have been `Lawrence of Malaya' as both films feature Peter O'Toole as a man who finds himself in a foreign land, fighting against an oppressive power structure, eventually earning the respect of the native peoples, but ultimately suffering from the undeniable fact that he is a stranger, and will always be regarded as such despite whatever honor and reverence imparted upon him by those whom he helped.  Based on a novel by Joseph Conrad and written and directed by Richard Brooks (Blackboard Jungle), Lord Jim (1965) stars Peter O'Toole as the title character (although the `Lord' part isn't assigned to him until much later in the film).  Also appearing is James Mason (20,000 Leagues Under the Sea), Eli Wallach (The Magnificent Seven), Curt Jrgens (The Longest Day), Jack Hawkins (The Bridge on the River Kwai), Paul Lukas (The Lady Vanishes), Daliah Lavi (The Silencers), and Tatsuo Saito (Three Stripes in the Sun).

As the story begins we witness a young British sailor named Jim graduating from sailor's school (or whatever they call it) and taking a commission on a ship commanded by Captain Marlow (Hawkins).  Jim seems a perfectly capable and able seaman, but he's also a bit of a daydreamer as thoughts of gallantry and heroic deeds swirl in his head.  After an injury leaves Jim in a foreign port, he signs on aboard the S.S. Patna, a rusty, decrepit tramp steamer carrying a mess of Muslims on a pilgrimage.  Trouble occurs at sea and the ship appears in danger of sinking, which drives the cowardly crew (Jim finds himself terror-stricken, reluctantly joining the rest of the crew) to abandon ship prematurely in one of the two meager lifeboats.  As they return to port, they're shocked to see the ship they abandoned is now in the harbor, as it was salvaged (and all passengers saved).  Driven by guilt, Jim confesses to his sins, and is shunned by his fellow British sailors, becoming a social outcast, eventually taking any job aboard any ship in an effort to escape the shameful eyes that now look upon him.  Eventually Jim finds himself in the employ of a trader named Stein (Lukas), transporting munitions to group of natives indentured to a ruthless and philosophical warlord (Wallach).  Jim manages to deliver the weapons, but soon finds himself caught up in the resistance movement, fighting alongside the natives, perhaps in an effort of redemption, as he's continually haunted and consumed by his actions of the past.  His heroism earns him a level of acceptance from the peoples, as they infer upon him the title of `Tuan', or Lord Jim out of respect.  Jim seems to have found a place in the world, but, as one would expect, the past (which he hadn't shared with his adopted peoples) comes back to haunt him in the form of a pirate named Gentleman Brown (Mason).

In terms of grand epics (the film runs a hefty 2 hours and 34 minutes), I felt Lord Jim fell a little short in comparison to such films like Bridge on the River Kwai or Lawrence of Arabia.  I guess the main issue I had was it seemed O'Toole's character just seemed so distant to me.  He was sort of presented as this man-boy, caught up in dreams of grandeur, yet mired within his own limitations and fears, subsequently haunted by a past he can't escape.  I think he turned in a very good performance, but I just had a problem connecting with his character and so his cause never really became my cause.  This lack of connection prevented me from investing too much of myself within the film, and often made me reflect on Hollywood's general inability to properly relate source material to the silver screen.  Perhaps this stems from the fact that some novels just aren't adaptable to film (but then I used to think that of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings novels, and they turned out pretty well).  At times I thought the film was really wonderful, and had clear direction, but then other times it seemed a little disjointed.  I did enjoy Wallach's performance as The General as he was presented as cunning and thoughtful villain, instead of just a two-dimensional antagonist element used to drive the story.  I thought James Mason did exceptionally well as Gentleman Brown, understanding Jim's weakness so perfectly and using it to his advantage.  I especially like how he was introduced, described by another character as a man that `has given more people to death than the Bubonic Plague.  He's wanted from Madagascar to Hong Kong for piracy, slaving, mutiny, murder, arson, rape, and some things that aren't even mentioned in the Bible.'  After a build up like that, I could hardly wait to see the character, and I wasn't disappointed.  I did feel some of the supporting parts, especially the natives, seemed a bit weak and watered down, and existed not so much as real, supportive characters, but more as plot contrivances (I also felt this of the character of Stein, especially with the sort of creepy father-son relationship he had with Jim).  The in-depth and extended examination of the differences between one being a coward versus being a hero seemed a bit murky at times, and the concepts a little indigestible, but I think this has more to due with variances with regards to the source material.  All in all a sweeping and entertaining film with a compelling heart and excellent production values that fell a little short of being a masterpiece, but not for lack of trying.

The widescreen anamorphic (2.20:1) picture on this DVD looks decent, but some of the colors didn't seem as sharp as I felt they could have been.  The Dolby Digital 3.0 audio is acceptable, and generally clear and distinct.  Extras include a preview section featuring trailers for Lawrence of Arabia, Bridge on the River Kwai, and In Cold Blood.

511677,4,6302797519,"Well, Peter O'Toole was never going to find another character or film as magnificent as Lawrence of Arabia. And his first films after that triumph were commendable attempts to avoid typecasting - What's New Pussycat and Becket. But it was inevitable he would again become a tormented blonde Englishman in an alien environment. And he could have done a lot worse than starring as Lord Jim for Richard Brooks.

Any discussion of this film has to concentrate on O'Toole and Brooks. That is not to say there are no other impressive performances, or that the film is not beautifully photographed or graced with a lushly evocative score. But the film is Brooks' vision and O'Toole is the one who must bring it to life. They are both reasonably successful.

Brooks obviously wanted to create an intelligent epic -one to rival the Robert Bolt/David Lean collaborations. But Brooks was both writer and director - and he was adapting a book that was as pyschological as potentially visual. Luckily for him, audiences in the 1960's were more sophisticated (dare we say intelligent?) and willing to think about what they were watching than today's consumers of assembly-line disposable entertainment. So characters could discuss and debate as well as blow things up. Although the disjointed nature of some of the film suggests pre-release studio interference. In the end, the film is a commendable attempt - perhaps more worthy than enjoyable, but still with lots to hold the viewer's interest.

The southeast Asian locations are frequently spectacular and some sequences - the storm at sea and the final battle with pirates - are excitedly staged. The film always looks and sounds beautiful. And, for once, an international cast with various accents actually contributes to the flavor of the script and characters. Stalwart Jack Hawkins, industrious Paul Lukas, wily Eli Wallach (doing a variation on his Magnificent Seven bandit) and James Mason seemingly enjoying himself as a gentleman pirate. The ""native"" players are also unusually good. Only gorgeous Daliah Lavi occasionally seems out of place, looking more like a 60's dolly bird than an exotic maiden.

But, of course, it is Peter O'Toole who commands the greatest attention. He is seldom off the screen and is probably the main reason for viewing the film today. He is properly enigmatic although without the multiple layers of Lawrence. This may well be the only film in which O'Toole occasionally underacts. After all these years, I still remember the Mad Magazine parody of Lord Jim. Two extras keep asking which emotion O'Toole is displaying - anger, love, determination, fear, doubt. For each one, he wear the same expression.

I'm quite glad to have seen Lord Jim again after so long - and with it looking so good. It's not a classic, not a film to be watched repeatedly. But it's a fine example of a large scale epic that could also be thoughtful and almost moving. A relic of an age of big and brave film making.",1093305600,70,2969,4.953815261044177

7831165,5,6302797519,"A buried treasure from the 1960's.  Shot not too long after Lawrence of Arabia (1962), this for its' time was a very dark story to put on screen.  Can't think of any major actor who would have taken the part.  Instead of watching a movie with people with superhuman abilities, this is a movie, that you can see yourself inside the main character (Peter O'Toole)",1520985600,,361,4.523076923076923

7831167,1,6302797519,"For the most part, this was an interesting story even if it was saturated with the whole ""white man's burden"" and ""white guilt"" mantras that hollyweird loves beating the drum on so much. I was willing to watch until a certain character died, O'Toole's character was blamed because ""reasons"" (???) and at the very end, O'Toole allows himself to be killed by the people he fought to protect.

I know the hollyweird elite would love to see all European whites sacrifice themselves for a third world whose squalor is a direct result of these same ethnic elites' genocidal nature, but WOW. I know O'Toole was fresh off ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" but I am shocked that his role in this film didn't set his career back by a decade. What an amazingly-bad ending to a film that was only interesting because of the personalities of O'Toole and James Mason to begin with!",1514246400,,855,4.662251655629139
