6249430,5,B00I462XTS,"At a glance this series seems a tad silly. It even makes a little fun of itself when it flashes between delusions and reality showing girls arms flailing in comical manners. But coming to the end of the series, it just hits home really well.

The story revolves around a former 8th grade syndrome sufferer named Yuuta. Basically means in middle school he had a very active imagination and dreamed he was this fantastical character. He has since grown up more and realizes how embarrassing his behavior was so hes trying to change.

Of course, in enters Takanashi Rikka who has not come to that stage yet. She is completely wrapped up in her fantastic world and many episodes you get to see her and others battling it out. Episodes go frequently off the wall to down to earth as you watch Yuuta struggling to deal with Rikka and struggling to hide his own past which is similar to her's.

But here is when the kicker comes. The whole series, doesn't just make these delusions reality and give you great comedy moments. It delves deep into the nature of the syndrome and why these kids choose to escape into imagination. As you watch, you don't expect it to go to some really serious places but then it does and it just leaves you applauding. The blend of seriousness with comedy makes this series and it's characters very endearing.

Really, anime fans owe it to themselves to at least rent or view season one online. It will surprise you by the end and gives a wonderful well crafted story.

The only fault here is the fact that the US publisher is currently lying by calling it the ""Complete Collection."" As of this moment, season two is currently airing in Japan. When you buy this, you are only getting season one. As most single season shows are about 300 minutes, the fact that this is 325 minutes may mean this release also includes all the mini episodes. But don't hold your breath on it.

When this series was airing there was also many mini episodes that aired with it. There was also OVAs too. Hopefully there will be some clarification before release if this set is getting the special treatment.

I'd hate to advise waiting for a more complete release as this is such a great show, but if you choose to wait for a collection that contains season two and all the OVAs + mini episodes then that wouldn't be a bad thing. Just be sure and let the publisher know that you want the extras, not a cut version of the original show.",1392076800,29,2435,4.483069977426637
6249431,5,B00I462XTS,"Saw this on Amazon Prime, and was blown away. The characters had depth, and
were all endearing in their own ways. Though Yula shuns Rikka at first, he still sees
himself in her, and when he learns more about her, finds himself drawn to her.
Everyone who has ever felt isolated and friendless in school will relate to this,
and will root for them. Though I'm not ordinarily a binge-watcher, I went through
this series in a couple of days, so anxious was I to find out what happens next.

Two seasons currently are out and a possible 3rd if the demand is there. Support the makers and maybe we just will get our 3rd season.

Animation is very good and really has wonderful colors especially during fight scenes.

The music is pretty good too!

6249439,5,B00I462XTS,"I haven't bought this yet but I did watch it. The reason why I haven't bought it is mainly due to the fact it hasn't been dubbed, but when it did get dubbed it was horrid. I'm really starting to rethink my opinion on buying the sub version after seeing the dubbed. The English voice acting was so bad I honestly feel like they ruined a great anime because of it. So I'm doing this review as a fan not as a costumer, because I have seen the anime just haven't bought it yet. But let me just say even though this box set is not dubbed in English its still better then the dubbed. Don't make the same mistake I made. Buy it you won't regret it. If you wanna watch the dubbed version how ever, I recommend finding a site for free anime before you waste money on it. Then you'll see why I regret not buying this when I could.

6249444,2,B00I462XTS,"I should probably begin this review with a concession to the ""different strokes for different folks"" principle. ""Love, Chunibyo, and Other Delusions"" (LCOD) is highly ranked here on Amazon, so apparently it's right up some folk's alley. I have a huge soft spot for anime about social losers and high-school weirdos, so I started watching LCOD with really high hopes, but to tell the truth... I was disappointed. It's mediocre to the core.

Let's start with what LCOD does right. For starters, this anime is visually gorgeous, with vibrant color, smooth and detailed animation, great work on facial expressions, and some very imaginative fight sequences when we go into ""as seen by Rika"" mode. I also appreciated the realistic character designs. These high school girls don't look like kindergarteners or adult film stars, but like normal teenaged girls with normal builds. (Same goes for the guys, though that's usually less of a problem in anime...) Finally, this anime is cute. No, correction: IT'S STINKIN' ADORABLE! The characters' silliness and everyone's earnest astonishment each time is the height of animated cuteness. In particular, the little ""ow"" noise Rika makes when she gets bopped on the head might be the single cutest sound effect I've ever heard.

However, this same focus on cuteness is ultimately a liability that harms the show's humor and ability to tell a good story. One of the cardinal principles of comedy is timing - to be funny, you have to tell a joke at the right pace and not get bogged down. Unfortunately, LCOD gets so wrapped up in trying to milk cuteness out of every interaction that it slows down its jokes (to display cute reactions) to the point where they are seldom funny. It also hurts itself by sticking too close to the middle on the absurdity scale - LCOD keeps things too reigned in to be truly zany, but the way everyone acts isn't realistic enough to be a proper slice of life, either.

And on that last point, the problems of too-slow pacing, unbelievability, and monomania about cuteness all converge to damage the quality of the plot. Put simply, in their desperation to make Rika and her relationship with Yuuta the paragon of cuteness, they have delivered us the story of a one-dimensional cutout falling in love with a teenaged baby. Rika's chunibyo stems from real problems and real grief, and real grief on this level is seldom pretty. It has rough edges. When prodded, it gets mean. In much the same way Rika retreats from reality, this show retreats from those rough edges and the real human interest they could lead to and only deals with them on the shallowest level possible. Going deeper to those ugly, awkward places just wouldn't be ""cute.""

Again, this show is not without a few virtues. It does manage to be touching in a place or two, and the comedy occasionally hits the right notes. (Especially whenever Dekomori has screen time - this girl is easily the funniest part of the show and is definitely one of its saving graces. When they don't slow Rika's delivery down, she can also generate the occasional laugh.) However, to me, the overall package is severely lacking. I got up to episode 9 or 10 and finally just stopped watching. It didn't hold my interest, and even getting that far felt like a chore.

6249447,5,B00I462XTS,"Alright, while I do not yet own this DVD I wanted to give it a fair shake against those giving it only 1 star for the lack of English Dubs.  While I do understand that Amazon failed to list the details accurately, the pictures taken of the back of the DVD box CLEARLY indicate that there are NO ENGLISH DUBS (and im certain its better this way anyways).

The show is among the growing list of comedy/drama genre animes that I personally cannot bring myself to finish because I don't want to end it.

6249460,4,B00I462XTS,"I really enjoyed this series even though it was made by Kyoto animation, known for their series like KON! and Lucky Star, which is mostly moe. But with this series, I didn't feel the moe vibe. Yes, most of the girls fit the moe type but they seemed more real unlike the other two I mentioned early.

The story is good. A guy is trying to forget his cringe-worth past when he meets a girl still stuck in that embarrassing phase that he's gone many lengths to try to forget. Along the way romance starts to happen. And that's all I am going to say because I don't want to spoil the series too much.

Only one reason why I gave this 4 stars is because on Amazon, they did say that it was English dubbed but when I finally got it, it only said Japanese audio 2.0 and English subtitles. I heard there is going to be a re-release soon with any English dub but oh well. I enjoyed the series at least.",1407628800,3,893,4.126436781609195
6249461,5,B00I462XTS,"First up-the stats:

This ""Complete Collection"" has only the first 12 ep season, the Christmas OVA, and the first set of 6 ONAs that came out at the tail end of 2012.  Plus previews, promos and textless opening/closing songs.  Earlier reviews claim no OVA or ONAs, both are on the third disc--the OVA can be found on the main menu, ONAs are in the Special Features under ""Chuni-shorts"".

Regardless of what Amazon has stated, this is sub ONLY, no dub available.  Don't order this then one star your review because you didn't double-czech and roll over the image of the back of the DVD case.

AND, it should be noted, there is zero ecchi--no oppai, no pantsu, no jiggle, not even any double entendre.  Beyond playful/gentle slapstick and some adult themes, this is a very clean show.  If you're looking for any of this, then move along, nothing to see here.

Previous reviews pretty much nail the gist of this first season, so I won't bore you by reiterating the already stated.  For this viewer, I really liked it for the look of the characters and the animation (very sharp colors, amazing eyes) the VA is superb; you might need a trigger finger on the pause function of your viewing device because the subtitles zip through quickly at times, and on occasion trivia notes also appear on screen to clarify a phrase or action.  Personally I can relate to Rikka's and Yuta's characters for I too was alone my first year of JH and needed someone to hide behind...not nearly as extreme as their cases, of course.

I watched the first four eps on Animefave after reading a review in OtakuUSA magazine, fell very much in like with this show, saved my pennies and not disappointed that I bought it.

6249464,4,B00I462XTS,"I am an anime-kind-of-girl. I've been watching these odd cartoons from Japan since my age was in the single digits, (not a boast, just a fact) and while I am not tired and cynical, or still sweet on days of yonder, I have watched enough to see priorities, fads, and prevalent content shift across a broad spectrum. More often lately,  I wish I had the teeth and claws to clutch tightly on the more memorable series I have enjoyed. So much can be said about older anime series and genres compared to newer shows, but really I am simply searching for something new to feed the flames of my fandom. I enjoyed this show very much, actually. Enough to buy it, and with enough left over energy, I am motivated to tell others about it and my experience. What Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions does well in character development dramatically overshadows its shortcomings lack of plot and the prerequisites of its tired genre. Concluding this introduction into my hindsight, the meat of this show brings about a sense of enthusiasm and justification for adding it to my, and perhaps your collection.

I first discovered LCD (ha) in early 2014 when I discovered it on what continues to surprise me as a thermally expanding programing block of Hulu Plus. I'll freely admit that it had been as show I originally avoided during its simulcast, but given one lazy afternoon alone in my apartment, and despite being a little overwhelmed with so much content to choose from, I decided to give it a shot. Two days later, I was still glued to the television. I still found it funny, engaging, and heartfelt down to the 12th episode of its first season. Not a perfect show, but sweetly sincere in its attempt to offer up something very different on an emotional level. Its subject of study is initially unclear. One glance at the title credits will tell you it is a show undoubted belongs to a particular breed that will certainly not suit everyone's tastes. Be honest with yourself. High-school hijinks, beach episodes, and one guy totally drowning in girls? From a stapled gut of the exhausted and overused comedic high-school genre, I had initially avoided subjecting myself to another, yet another...blah blah bleh. But as I said, two sunless days later, I finished this first season with rapid inertia and more than a little regret. I liked these characters. A lot. Not obsessively, and not with the passion to hunt down piles of associated merchandise, but with enough respect and renewed appreciation for Japanese children between the ages of fourteen and sixteen.

It truly is such an emotional age. Many, many things happen; not just love, but the choice between remaining a child or becoming an adult--the part of the 'delusion' featured in the title is a neat plot device to prove just how hard we can hold onto the past and persist to ignore the responsibilities and restraints society can place on us whether or not we accept such an important mantel.

Togashi Yuta is a pretty decent guy. He lives with his hip mom and has a not-so-creepy and thankfully  normal relationship with his younger sister. The walkway outside his room is filled with boxes from his recent and rather dramatic departure from his old life. For you see, in middle school, Yuta was one of those kids the other children passed in the hallway with a nervous lack of eye contact and hushed voices. In his attempt to hang on to the fleeting freedom and spirit of his youth, during middle school Yuta created a delusional persona of himself called the 'Dark Flame Master', and complete with sword and armor, embraced the night, darkness, and whatever weirdness served to distance him from his severely alienated classmates. Funny, yes, but like all of us looking back on certain things we did in childhood, very embarrassing So embarrassing, Yuta transferred schools to a high-school far away where no one, absolutely no one, could recognize or remember his academic 'chunibyo'. This word is interesting. It exists sandwiched in the title, apparently referring to phenomenon children of his age are prone to experience in Ye Old Nippon. Takanashi Rikka is the cute girl who lives on the floor above him, the female counterpart to his psychosis (but with an eye patch instead of a sword). And as cute as she is, she is unlike Yuta in that her delusion is still very much prevalent in that she verbally, psychologically, and existentially defies the logic and attempts of anyone to place her somewhat close to the center of sanity. What a great romantic pair. I route for them instantly, and at the same time, applaud Yuta's patience with sincerity.
A wider cast of oddball characters soon forms a social brigade known as: The Society for Competitive Napping. Complete with a spacey upperclassman, a deceptively perfect class prez, and a perky blonde with an odd penchant for mythology proactively pad the cast, and each of them struggle with their own delusions, or like Yuta, the embarrassing regrets of the their past activities while they were caught deeply in the spell of ending youth.

That, in itself, is the greatest strength Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions has: Its characters, through and through, make or break the show. As we watch them grow and interact, the story itself meanders from encounter to encounter, a weird balance of what is real and what is imagined. Whether or not you and sympathize, empathize, or simply sit stunned at their antics will polarize your enjoyment of this show with and capitol P. The 'story' itself does not actually drive the narrative, but rather, at the center unfolds the relationship between Rikka and Yuta, and whether or not she accepts his rationality and whether or not he can tolerate her ideology.

Throughout the course of several successive episodes, we find ourselves embroiled in a world where motivations are revealed to be based on past traumas, insecurities, and understandable rejections of social constraints. It is also during this emotional back-swing that will either completely drive you away or firmly cement you within the camp of these characters. I, for one, felt compassion (I'm normally kind of heartless) and was moved by their sincerity and although strange, very unconventional reactions to the normies pushing them toward the abandonment of their childish games.

Chunibyo itself exists as an interesting story alone. It becomes clear that while funny antics and shenanigans create humor for the more-firmly grounded audience, this tale of weird love is just that, a love story. I can appreciate the bells and whistles to create an unconventional setting, but this is still a story about teen love. Confused and slightly destructive, but with a sincere need for acceptance among peers with a steadfast retention of individuality and youth. The show does well in creating a balance in what should be chaos, and creates a safe world for these characters to exist, miss, and fumble their encounters with one another. In short, coming of age never managed to make me smile so much.

Its failings, however, must be mentioned. The lack of an over-aching plot may bother some, and simply put, watching this children argue, contest, and bounce off one another with reckless energy may require more patience and time than some are willing to invest. Visually, it appears most remarkable for its lack of pandering and rehash of character designs. Yuta often looks like he just rolled out of bed, and Rikka possesses her own unique fashion sense. On that note, their clothes also fit remarkably well, even loose at times, which is a nice change. Action sequences push the show to its peak throughout the interplay between different characters during their delusions. The result is interestingly depicted. Musically, it does not make enough of an impression beyond its bouncy and catchy opening theme, although the butt-bouncing thing seems kind of out of place, and might offer a tell to the tastes of certain creative minds behind the show...perhaps. For me, I enjoyed the series subtitled very much. It is not a departure from typical Sentai Filmworks skeletal releases.

It happens to all of us sooner or later. Each of us, at some point, comes to that bridge in life between childhood and adulthood, one we can either choose to cross or in some cases, dig in our heels and hold onto the freedom and magic that grants us an identity or power that can seem so much more appealing. In retrospect, it is easy to see how daydreaming during recess, hunting for knowledge among other ideologies, and even imagining an alternate universe was and in some cases still is a vast improvement over the expectations of society. Crossing said bridge can actually happen at any point in life, but it is definitely our choice and our choice alone to take that first step away from what may not seem granted instead to what can be attained through effort, sacrifice, and its harsher realities. That statement is precisely what I found so captivating about Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions; not a portrait of either childhood or adulthood, but the process and meticulous undertaking of turning our attainability into a reality, and thus leaving the unrealistic or painful rest where it belongs: in our memories. So many of these anime shows that focus on high-school antics often forget about us, the audience, who are made more aware of the superficial nature of these stories and are ultimately responsible for deciding the worth of their content.

That is what I like about this show. I pronounce this show extremely accessible, heartfelt, and never betraying of the emotions of growing up. As a character study or psychological event, it does not fail in its attempts to decipher the feelings it characters have as the grow and learn to love. And it doesn't hurt that is still manages to depict the antics, adventures, and spirited encounters of the youths we have all come to love in our high-school romcoms too. For that, when I consider the time it took to write this review, I felt my passion returning for anime of this genre in general. I always recommend a thorough investigation before purchase, but hopefully my soapbox at least peaked your interest or encouraged a closer examination.
Now I hate it that I must go back to work. Work is boring. I'd rather be a wizard, ninja, or dark lord. I can admit that easily, and that makes me human; an interestingly easy comparison to make to these animated characters.

And since Amazon rates these things based on stars, I'll give this release four. Perfection is a hard ideal in any medium. This one almost makes it, but I have higher hopes for season two. Usagi out.",1403827200,5,10636,4.86692435118719

There are also minisodes which may be included with this set, but it is also missing the OVA/movie mentioned above.
Overall a very sweet and sentimental show that reminds me of Welcome to NHK and My Pet Monster.

My only problem is that I didn't realize it wasn't English dubbed and I had to get back into the habit of reading watching at the same time again. I wish I had paid better attention to the product. But I don't regret my purchase.",1501718400,,326,4.344262295081967
8639090,3,B00I462XTS,There is truly no romance in this and the girl he has a crush on at the beginning......why is she in this?,1500854400,,106,3.8636363636363638
8639091,1,B00I462XTS,"This is only the sub, and in a low quality DVD release. I bought it because the only English version I saw around was in a non-North American blu-ray, but it turns out it's an extremely disappointing release overall. I don't understand why Sentai would release this and not a full dual-audio release in blu-ray quality. Just watch it online and save some money!",1499212800,,361,4.65625

8639095,5,B00I462XTS,Exactly as written.  It's a dvd set alright,1473984000,,43,4.375
