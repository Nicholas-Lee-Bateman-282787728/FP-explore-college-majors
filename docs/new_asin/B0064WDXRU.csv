8492997,5,B0064WDXRU,A great homage to the drive-in movies of the 70s. It is even filmed in a way that gives it that authentic 70s feel. It also has a nice twist on the Sasquatch/Bigfoot mythos. The actors do a fine job. But the standout is Sarah French AKA Scarlet Salem in the lead role. Sarah does an outstanding job here.,1393200000,,304,4.169491525423729
8492998,3,B0064WDXRU,"""Shriek of the Sasquatch!"" summons up memories of ridiculous 1970s horror movies. It's got horrible hair, terrifying clothes, huge cars, lots of wood paneling, and even a video of Jimmy Carter's ""Crisis of Confidence"" speech (which is no better now than it was in 1979.) The plot has amusing parallels to almost every Bigfoot picture ever made, and has a real 1970's ethic despite being made in 2010 (it's set in 1979.) The creature is equal parts scary and laughable, the gore and special effects are notably cheesy, and the lighting and awful color balance appear vintage as does the film damage. The authenticity of the film's look is enough to make it deserving of two stars, with a third added for pure cheesy fun. The acting is terrible and wholly in keeping with the genre (the coroner in particular turns in one of the most wooden performances in cinema history.)

Now that I've outlined the relative successes of the film, I have to mention my misgivings: despite trying to mimic a filmmaking style of 40 years ago (and doing it very successfully) the movie still needs to entertain. Unfortunately there is a lot of padding in the 81 minute running time which results in frequent stretches of boredom. One of the most painful scenes which I thought would never end was the ""hitchhiking to oblivion"" scene. We all knew how it was going to turn out, but it was absolutely tortuous getting there. This isn't the only example of this phenomenon, but it illustrates the point. If you are a fan of cheesy 1970s creature features, you will love reliving the glory days of Bigfoot cinema with ""Shriek of the Sasquatch!""; consider it a guilty pleasure for connoisseurs of fine B-movies.",1366588800,,1686,4.773972602739726
8492999,2,B0064WDXRU,"This movie was basically good for a laugh.  The ""sasquatch"" definitely had no ""real"" quality at all.  His appearance was that of a ""man in a suit"".  Very fake.  I would not recommend buying this movie.",1334620800,,201,4.5
8493000,5,B0064WDXRU,Real fun campy movie.  Reminded me of watching late night channel 9 movies late at night in the late 70's.  They shot is somehow to look like it was.  I watch anything bigfoot.  Liked it alot.  Everyone who comes over wants to borrow it!  I'm keeping it!,1326931200,4,254,4.297872340425532
