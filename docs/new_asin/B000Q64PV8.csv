In fact, it depicts the historical truth that during Akbar's reign, Muslims and Hindus were staunch allies. Muslims treated Hindus with great respect and trust; in fact many of Akbar's most loyal military commanders were Hindus who defended the Mughal Empire with their life and their honor. The tremendous success of this movie at the box office in India where far more Hindus than Muslims watched this movie in the cinema houses is proof of this magnificent movie's popularity among both Muslims and Hindus of India.",1324857600,,636,5.009433962264151

But then, I found myself unexpectedly swept up in this story of a prince defying his father for love of a woman, really enjoying it, and wanting to see how the story would turn out.

Some amazing set design, and some beautiful songs, along with often really strong cinematography.

2 versions of film exist. It was originally released in 1960, mostly in black and, but with two reels in color. Filmmaker Asif had wanted to make the whole film in color, but lacked the funds. In 2004 it was re-released in a version that colorized the black and white reels. While that would normally be a film sacrilege to me, in this case it was done with loving care, at great expense, and with the intention of finishing Asif's version the way he wanted. I actually own both versions.

Following the advice of what seemed the majority of critics I watched the colorized version first, and was shocked to find it really worked for me.  Maybe the early Indian color process had a slightly unreal look that let the reels that were originally in color blend just about seamlessly with the colorized reels, but in any case the whole worked wonderfully.

On the other hand I recently watched the film again, this time in the original mostly black and white/2 reels in color version.  I found that somewhat less satisfying.  The magic of the piece seemed dimmed, the fairy tale sense of being in another world less constantly palpable.  The sets felt less amazing, and details didn't catch my eye the same way.

The Eros release is pretty high quality for the color and the Shameroo/Eros is OK for the older black and white/color combination. That print is very beat up, but at least the image seems sharp.  (As with many Indian films there are lots of weak knock off releases that look like someone just burned a VHS tape onto DVD).",1306281600,,1972,4.589743589743589
