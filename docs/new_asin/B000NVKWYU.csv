2783800,1,B000NVKWYU,"Save your money and your time on ""Marie and Jack: A Hardcore Love Story"", it was more like a hardcore disappointment!

To call itself a 'movie' is stretching it, as the 'movie' is only one scene, consisting of 28 minutes. Throughout the 28 minutes, the sex and intimacy is interrupted by the interview of the couple, ruining the mood.

I got the movie for my wife and I to enjoy and we did everything but enjoy it. Halfway through my wife didn't even want to watch anymore because of the interviews interrupting the sex. While watching the sex scene, the camera was way too close to the action and had a claustrophobic feel to it.

Tony Comstock is pulling one over by selling all these different scenes as 'movies'.  To be more fair, he should put all the scenes together to make one movie, that would be more legitimate.",1329696000,6,822,4.496644295302014
2783801,2,B000NVKWYU,"I am sorry for all of the aficionados, this isn't that great of a movie, waaaayy too much talking that practically puts you to sleep.  The sex isn't all that.

2783802,2,B000NVKWYU,Worked well as a contrast against the standard/mainstream.  Lives up to being an erotic documentary. But that's about it.,1209686400,4,121,5.368421052631579
2783803,1,B000NVKWYU,I read the reviews on this DVD and it sounded great.  My husband and I watched it and we were disappointed.  I thought it was going have more of a sexual story to it then just sex.  They were real people but I wish it had more a of a story to it.,1193529600,11,246,3.6037735849056602
2783804,5,B000NVKWYU,"Comstock does it again, presenting a brief and enjoyable documentary about one couple's love life. The entire presentation takes about forty minutes. Marie and Jack introduce themselves in the first half, talking about how they met, the challeneges of balancing work against their home life, and about their real devotion to each other and to their marriage. Their discussion includes a few physical details of their sex play, illustrated by cuts between the interview and a scene in their bedroom. (I just wish Jack wouldn't interrupt her so much - that really grates on me.) The second half of this study presents a longer look at their lovemaking, including the moments from shown in the interview. The lovers are clearly there for each other first, and for the camera second if at all.

This is what erotica is supposed to be, and so very rarely is. It shows a loving moment between a loving couple, generally doing things that I'd enjoy with my own beloved. After the interview at the start I feel that I know them, at least a little. I want to see them happy together, and that includes delighting each other sexually.

The unusual thing about this handsome couple is that they work as actors in the adult film industry, and generally work with other people. This leads to odd moments on the set, such as when some adult actor is introduced to Jack just before getting physical on camera with Jack's wife, marie. It also leads to some odd moments at home, thinking about how to act natural with each other after acting out exaggerations of other people's fantasies all day on the set. Maybe ""acting natural"" itself is an act for them - and maybe putting that concious effort into what the other wants isn't a bad thing.

Explicitly sexual videos are easy enough to find. Videos with genuine affection, gentle tone, and people you can care about are painfully rare, though. Jack and Marie give just that, the kind of erotica that sensitive viewers can whole-heartedly enjoy.

2783805,2,B000NVKWYU,"I'm surprised by these glowing reviews.  They inspired me to buy the film, but I found the film itself deeply uninspiring.  I bought it to watch with my boyfriend-- and we're new to couples' porn, so I wasn't after anything too intense-- but it was 28 minutes (28 minutes for $24!) and astoundingly dull.  The commentary between the husband and wife is interesting for a glimpse into the real life of people in the porn industry, but neither their conversation nor the sex scenes are arousing to any notable degree.  Mainly, as another reviewer wrote, they talk about the relatively ""vanilla"" nature of their home sex life, and about the corresponding intimacy.  They seem to love each other and enjoy the sex, but, as a viewer, there isn't much to be excited about.  I certainly won't buy any other Comstock films, despite the giddy reviews, and I'm returning this one.",1183766400,28,870,4.766666666666667
2783806,5,B000NVKWYU,"Tony Comstock is the creator and master of a new genre of films:  explicit couples' sexuality documentaries.  Comstock states that ""intent to arouse"" is often cited as the dividing line between art and porn.  Of all the emotions a director might hope to induce in an audience, arousal remains the last taboo, and Tony Comstock takes it head-on.

Marie and Jack:  A Hardcore Love Story marked Comstock's creation of the genre.  Marie and Jack are a husband and wife pair who met while the both worked in the porn industry.  Both are still active in the industry, and their on-screen antics are completely separate from what goes on behind their bedroom door.  In intimate conversation, they reveal the ins and outs of their marriage and love life.  They delight in the fact that their home sex life is relatively vanilla, with a few key positions and some signature moves that each knows turns the other on.

When Marie and Jack agreed to star in this documentary, they made a pact not to edit their sex life for the camera, but to create a revealing and intimate portrait of their life in the bedroom.  This is the hands-down winner for any couple looking to watch erotic film together, and Comstock offers a number of other titles in this series for viewer who get hooked on the idea.  Matt & Khym and Xana & Dax are two titles available from Amazon.  I only wished they also carried his first-rate gay male feature Damon & Hunter.",1175644800,10,1432,4.612648221343873
2783807,5,B000NVKWYU,"A couple of years back I went seeking sexy films I might watch with my husband - something fun and erotic that we could share. Having trawled through acres of trite, poorly crafted, not very inspiring videos and on the verge of giving up the search, I had the luck to find Tony and Peggy Comstock and Comstock Films. I've been a fan ever since - hence the reviews!

Marie and Jack: A Hardcore Love Story, from director Tony Comstock, has been talked about a good deal and justifiably cooed over since its release in 2003. Reviewers one by one have succumbed to the film's charm. They've no doubt been beguiled, like I was, by the fresh faced enthusiasm that Jack and Marie demonstrate for each other, engaged by their good natured humour and captivated by witnessing the intimacy and pleasure of authentic sex between this real life couple, all skillfully captured buy a clever filmmaker.

As I discovered on my search, Marie and Jack seems to represent a rare find in explicit erotic material -- a film that truly celebrates sex as a joyous, intimate connection between people and does so in a way that clearly reminds us of why beautiful lovemaking is so enthralling and pleasurable to watch. I highly recommend this film.

Tony's other films including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Xana-and-Dax-When-Opposites-Attract-Real-People-Real-Life-Real-Sex-series/dp/B000NVJSHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Xana and Dax: When Opposites Attract (Real People, Real Life, Real Sex series)</a>&nbsp;are all a pleasure to watch.",1174867200,17,1561,5.523012552301255
2783808,5,B000NVKWYU,"Along with his wife Peggy, filmmaker Tony Comstock makes a name for himself in filming real couples having sex.  These are not the horrible ""amateur"" films one can find everywhere on the internet, but lovingly filmed and beautifully lit near-documentaries of couples who genuinely enjoy each other.  ""Marie and Jack:  A Hardcore Love Story"" was the first Comstock film, and if you have high standards for erotic films you won't be disappointed.

The couple--Marie Silva, a porn actress who works under the name of Aria, and her husband Jack Bravo, also a porn actor--talk frankly about their relationship and how their sex life intermeshes with their professional lives.  Interspersed with their interview are the sex scenes.  Despite their professions neither Marie nor Jack look like typical porn stars--they're good-looking, but not gorgeous; there are no fake breasts or painted faces or overly buff bodies or bad fake tans.  About the most outrageous thing to be seen on either of them are Marie's silver-painted nails!  The chemistry between them is palpable, which makes the sex scenes scorchingly hot.  There is no overdone moaning or screaming or weird positions.  It is voyeurism at its most intimate, but with much better camera angles.

This is a great couples film, as well as a good introduction for the sex film neophyte.  Comstock Films has released three other films since ""Marie and Jack""--one, ""Matt and Khym:  Better Than Ever"" is also available on Amazon--but ""Marie and Jack"" remains a sentimental favorite of mine.  It's always enjoyable to watch people having sex who look like they're actually having fun.  Thank you, Tony and Peggy!",1173571200,29,1658,5.134328358208955

8181630,2,B000NVKWYU,"Just one sex scene.  I would have enjoyed seeing Marie and Jack explore each other in at least 2 or 3 situations other than missionary in the bedroom. So much missed potential here.  Soft core,  Overpriced. Actors were pleasing to look at; don't expect too much.
