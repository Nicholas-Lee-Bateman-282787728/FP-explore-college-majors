8378716,5,B000JX40JA,"I must admit that I gave this movie 5 stars mostly because I was its Technical Advisor (archery) and the one shooting all the arrows in this now hard-to-find movie. Michael Nouri plays a professor who's out to solve a murder. When the villain, Patrick Oneal, (for whom I doubled in all archery scenes), finds that Spraggue is out to bring the killer to justice, he decides to kill (yes, by bow and arrow) him as well. The movie has its lighter side as well. Features: Michael Nouri, Patrick Oneal, Glynnis Johns and James Cromwell.",1489968000,,531,4.6
8378717,5,B000JX40JA,"""Spraggue"" was an unsold television pilot from 1984.  Why it was unsold, I'll never understand.  An excellent mystery filmed entirely in Boston based on a series of books by Linda  Barnes.  Michael Nouri made a charming leading man.  Veteran British actress, Glynnis Johns was fabulous as Michael Spraggue's aristocratic Aunt Mary.  If only it had been picked up, it would have given Murder, She Wrote a run for its money.",1473552000,2,422,4.957142857142857
