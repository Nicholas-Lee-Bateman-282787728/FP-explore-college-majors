1271341,2,B00003CXRA,"The only reason I gave this film two stars is because of the interesting and suspenseful non-sniper battles, which really aren't much of the film.  However, as soon as this movie moves from the battle fields to the relationship and human side, it loses all ground.  The romance is trite, and the love triangle is even dumber.  This movie tries so hard to have the gore and violence and shocks that Saving Private Ryan had, but there really aren't any characters to care about at all.  Many of the human stories in the film have been so Hollywoodized that the film ends up being a trite war film about love instead of the tense sniper film that the previews made it out to be.  Also, so many ideas are ripped off of other sniper films that it seems incredibly old.  Many times in this movie I felt like I was watching much older films and reading many other books.  The last thing I will say is that Enemy at the Gates could've been much shorter, by about an hour.  This movie is quite dissapointing and isn't near the caliber of any of the great war films like A Bridge Too Far or Bridge on the River Kwai.  I reccommend that you see any of those older films before you spend ten dollars to see this one.",988675200,4,1204,4.292035398230088
1271342,5,B00003CXRA,"This movie was the most amazing reconstruction of World War Two Russia I have ever seen.  It depicts the Russian struglle perfectly while keeping the characters as real as possible.  Stunning performances from Harris, Fiennes, and Law, all three alike.  This is a must see for anyone with a strong mind who is ready to be blown away.",988675200,,333,4.706896551724138
1271343,4,B00003CXRA,"This movie was well done.  The opening battle scene was almost identical to SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.  Lots of legs and arms went flying and many people were killed.  As one good sniper survives (Jude Law, he kills 5 enemies with one rifle from very far away.  Another soldier hooks him up with the newspaper industry and the sniper man becomes famous with the people and is on the hunt for another excellent sharp shooter (Ed Harris- The Rock).  This film lacks in the middle where I off-and-on fell asleep, even though a few people get shot with a loud bang.  The ending really pulled it around as {Rachel Weiez- The Mummy 1 & 2) became the true love of the young good shooter and her kid brother is hanged, and there is a big battle.  The ending is not accurate to the actual happenings of the true event, but it comes somewhat close.  Ed Harris shoots the good sniper's friend, but thinks he killed the good sniper, his enemy.  Then Harris goes out and of course they see eachother at the same time... and well you get it.  This movie is good in acting, directing (considering it was made in Europe), and story.  The beginning rocks, the middle is sleepy, the keeps your eyes open most of the time.  See this movie on video.",985219200,6,1223,4.410714285714286
1271344,5,B00003CXRA,"""Enemy at the Gates"" has often been criticized for being unauthentic. Have we forgotten that this IS a movie? The writers and director HAVE taken creative license when it comes to language, casting, and history. The true story has been greatly altered, but if you wanted to have a history lesson, I'm sure the local university could help you out. We go to the movies for entertainment. And that's exactly what ""Enemy at the Gates"" is. A full 2+ hours of excellent filmmaking. There is truly something for everyone. The guys will love the graphic battle scenes. The ladies will love the romantic subplot and the unbelievably handsome leading men. If the actors aren't speaking Russian, or if you find it unbelievable that a couple can make love amond a bunch of grimy sleeping soldiers, then where's your imagination? This a beautiful story of bravery, perserverance, and humanity in the face of unspeakable horrors of war. The acting is superb. Jude Law once again proves that his beauty is surpassed only by his talent. Ed Harris was perfect as the ice-cold Nazi sniper Koenig sent to snuff out Law's Vassily Zaitsev. Rachel Weisz was believable as the female soldier with a personal vengance against the Nazis. She was beautiful enough to be a leading lady, but not at all done-up. She's as filthy as everyone else, rather than fully made-up as she crawls through the trenches. To be fair, however, the one weakness I found was that the love triangle tentatively set up between Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), Vassily and Tania was not terribly effective. There was simply not enough interaction between the characers, mainly Fiennes and Weisz, to warrant Fiennes anger when it is revealed that Vassily and Tania are lovers. The character of Danilov was such a nerdy twitt anyway,  don't understand why Fiennes bothered with it. He is cut out for so much more. But that's the worst I can say about it. Worth every penny you spend if you go into it with an open mind. Appreciate the amazing cinematography, the solid acting, the beautiful story. Forget the little details that give away that this is NOT the real WWII. I for one am glad of that.",985132800,28,2140,4.783783783783784
1271345,3,B00003CXRA,"In war, during a prolonged battle-- the outcome of which will be pivotal to the efforts of both sides-- death becomes a fact of life and the decline of morale among the troops follows in it's wake.  What better way, then, to bolster the spirits of those who must fight and die than by giving them a hero?  For once established, even if he is killed, the hero will have served his purpose, for the martyr is just as potent in death as the hero is in life.  In ""Enemy At the Gates,"" directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud, the Russians and Germans, in September of 1942, have reached an impasse during the siege of Stalingrad.  Casualties continue to mount on both sides and the Russians especially are beginning to feel the weight of what seems to be a futile effort, though this is the city that must not fall to the enemy at any cost.  When Khrushchev (Bob Hoskins) arrives to take charge and solicits ideas from his officers as to how they may turn the tide of the battle, a young political officer in charge of propaganda, Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) steps forward and proffers a hero, a soldier from among the ranks he knows to be a marksman of exceptional ability.  His name is Vasily Zaitsev (Jude Law), and with Danilov's newspaper touting his exploits, Vasily soon becomes the hero of the Russian people who rallies them to the cause.  Quickly aware of the situation, however, the Germans waste no time in bringing in a sharpshooter of their own, Major Konig (Ed Harris), specifically for the purpose of hunting down and eliminating Zaitsev.  And so, in the pitch of battle, the duel between the two becomes the focus of attention, the outcome of which will seemingly be viewed as victory or defeat by and for the armies of both sides.  Early in the film, Annaud creates a sense of urgency and tension that promises to sweep you along to the climax, and the anticipation of an involving emotional experience at that point is high.  Unfortunately, even as the siege reaches an impasse, so does the film.  About half way through it all begins to sputter, and you begin to get the feeling that the promises made at the beginning will never be fulfilled.  And you're right.  Failing to elicit the necessary emotional involvement from the audience, it finally stalls altogether and by the time you get to the end it seems almost anticlimactic.  Overall, the film suffers from it's own ambition; it attempts to be of a much larger scale and more profound than it really is.  Annaud apparently intended to make a sweeping epic and an intimate, character driven film at the same time, but the formula for any success in the endeavor eluded him.  By interjecting and concentrating on too many elements involving the relationships between the characters, he minimizes the importance of the duel itself, and thereby diminishes the impact of it--especially the outcome-- that greatly affects the success of the film.  Distracting as well is the fact that all of the Russians have class-distinctive British accents, which makes their credibility a bit hard to swallow.  The high point of the film would have to be Jude Law's performance as the sniper, Vasily Zaitsev.  He manages enough emotional depth and lends a bearing to the character that make him believable, though there is one lapse near the end when during a particularly emotional scene he briefly slips into a such a ""Cockney"" dialect that it takes you out of the moment.  That one exception aside, it's a solid performance.  Ed Harris delivers a notable performance, as well, though far removed from the best work he's ever done.  Though he affects a fairly stoic countenance, he never quite achieves the enigmatic quality that would've made a dramatic impact as a counterpoint to Zaitsev's more overt humanness.  Rachel Weisz comports herself well as Tania, the woman who impacts the lives of Danilov and Vasily, but the role is far from challenging.  There is some chemistry between her and Law, however, and their scenes together create what little emotional apex there is to the film.  Surprisingly, the low point of the film is the performance given by Joseph Fiennes, a terrific actor who was so outstanding in ""Shakespeare In Love.""  Any depth of character he achieves here, as Danilov, seems feigned, and his whole delivery is simply too melodramatic to be entirely effective.  As the director, of course, Annaud is the one who must ultimately be held accountable for it.  And it illustrates just how much impact the expertise (or lack thereof) of the director can have on a film, for even the best actors must rely on the instincts of their director, as well as their own, to keep them on task.  The supporting cast includes Ron Perlman (Koulikov), Gabriel Thomson (Sasha) and Eva Mattes (Mother Filipov).  Though based on a true story, and dealing with a significant historical event-- that being the battle of Stalingrad itself-- ""Enemy At the Gates,"" simply does not deliver what could have been an engrossing cinematic experience.  It's not a bad movie, by any means, and it certainly has it's moments; but in the final analysis, it's just another movie, and not a very memorable one at that.",985046400,5,5153,4.788700564971752
1271346,3,B00003CXRA,"Where is reality here?  Filmmakers can take certain license where moviegoers have some knowledge of the facts (e.g., The Right Stuff, or even Zulu).  Where fans are typically entirely in the dark, Enemy is a wonderful example of how easily filmmakers can revert to Gunga Din and other shopworn Circa 1930's templates.  Facts: (1) Sasha was 15 when he was hanged for espionage - he never met Chernova or Zaitsev. (2) Zaitsev's ""career"" was over by the end of August 1942.  Its end had nothing to do with ""Danilov"" (a fictional character) or his jealousy - simply put, Zaitsev's propaganda value deteriorated because he wasn't the #1 Soviet sniper any more, because he was beginning to be viewed as comically irrelevant, because the Red Army and its Allies started making real news of their own, and because Zaitsev was shot in the face and temporarily blinded. (3) Konig, or Konings, may or may not have existed.  His ""son"", his gold-tipped ciggies, and his relationship with poor Sasha were all made up. (4) Chernova and Zaitsev WERE lovers, but she was also a sniper, and, after recovering from her grievous abdominal wound, never saw Zaitsev again.  Zaitsev married and realized his dream, verbalized in the film, of managing a factory - why that was brought up and dropped is a bit of dopy editing.  The Red Army was clearly not on the verge of throwing in the towel at the beginning of November 1942 - they were in the midst of preparing the offensive against the Germans, Hungarians, Rumanians and Italians that would turn the tide of the war.  Oh, well....you get my point.",985046400,6,1579,4.758241758241758
1271347,5,B00003CXRA,"The year is 1942.  The battle is for Stalingrad, the last obstacle between the Nazis and the oil fields of the Asian Soviet Republics. Into this epic struggle between the desperate Soviets and the overextended Nazis plunges our hero, Vassili Zaitsev, fresh from the Urals and played by Jude Law.  Surviving a horific boat ride and initial battle, he befriends and impresses young comissar Danilov, played by Joseph Fiennes.
Vassili is an excellent shot and he's clever.  We see him dispatch six or so Nazis, with the others in their midst not even noticing because of the way he's timed his shots to coincide with explosions. Danilov has Vasily transferred to the sniper division and proceeds to make him into a national hero by writing skillfull propaganda. Danilov and Vassili's friendship is tested by their common desire for beautiful Tanya, a fellow soldier.  Daniliv feels a special desire for her since they are both Jewish, but she is more drawn to Vassili's bravery.
Meanwhile, Vassily is picking off Nazi officers all over Stalingrad.  The Nazis decide this won't do and send the aristocratic head of their sniper school, Major Konig (played by Ed Harris), to finish off the young sharpshooter.  This is played up by Daniliv as an epic class struggle in the best tradition of Soviet propaganda. The movie moves to its conclusion with the struggle between and Vassily and Konig and the love triangle involving Vassily, Daniliv and Tanya as the central elements.
Did you ever think you'd see stirring site of the hammer and sickle waving in the breeze, while cheering soldiers circled it, in a Hollywood movie? Joseph McCarthy must be whirling in his grave. Seriously, it was great to see history portrayed from a non-American viewpoint. There were no American characters in this film.",984873600,5,1793,4.9799331103678925
1271348,2,B00003CXRA,"I didn't come away from this movie feeling it was a complete waste of time but it was a waste of resources, $90million worth on sets and costumes and authenticity for a basically theatrical production. All the actors put in good performances particularly ed harris. The film basically never gets to grips with its material or the setting. Are we grateful to the russians for saving us from fascism and being utterly cruel and heartless in the process or should we revile them as they were in the cold war ? This is not a dilemma the film answers but just raises over and over while pointing out these are all people who love and hate and are weak and strong and they are in a war, apart from that the war could be anywhere. Lack of vision is what i'm talking about. For example the film actually opens to tell how far the ""german jackboot"" has put its heel into Europes back, well so what if you were unaware of a war in Russia or a place called Stalingrad in history this piece of information is next to useless to citizens of 2001. It is clumsy and at best school room history. Then theres the whole issue of the central character and his conscience over killing so many for whatever cause. Little effort is made to see inside the characters beyond some minor lines about the obvious side of killing for example Zaitsev explains to a would be sniper that these are real people they are killing but he could be talking about buying cucmbers at the supermarket for all his zeal in the task. The script is poor and does no service for a new europe seeking truths in the past for all that the film is just another technical production success with a well acted drama element not untypical of a tv show like wings of war. I particularly enjoyed the romance section of the film even if cliched",984873600,2,1789,4.391566265060241

Perhaps the name of the movie is too misleading and should have referenced the personal stories instead of highlighting the war.  I do think we can get a good idea of the battle that waged between the stalwart Russians and the die hard Germans.

1271727,5,B00003CXRA,"My father was in Stalingrad during the German siege.  He remembered and spoke of Zaystev's importance ... he really had been the first of many held out as more than a hero but as a symbol of hope against the fascist invaders.

My father said that before Zaystev, deaths at the hands of Soviet nationals seemingly exceeded losses by Germans.  Soviet nationals were willing to risk being shot by either side in the conflict taking a chance of being taken alive as a prisoner by German forces.  But once news of Zaystev broke, the entire dynamic changed.  Soviet troops fought harder and more willingly.  Of course, this movie was Trumped up ... the confirmed kill count was true but the cat and mouse game of wits between snipers was a fake story.

Perhaps Vasily was a state hero, but it was Mikhail Kruschev who changed the paradigm from desperation to hope and turned the battle around.  This movie's finer quality is that it promoted hope over self-destruction.",1511136000,5,963,4.724550898203593

In that film, the Russian sniper Lyudmila Mykhailovna Pavlichenks story was far better executed, and a much more compelling story of humanity. No girl power for its own sake, just a tough Russian woman in an extraordinarily bad situation, with an obvious gift for delivering lead at long distances...Plus- Mosin Nagants and explosions!",1510963200,,666,5.166666666666667

Two snipers pitted against each other. They take on a love story that isn't needed.  But it's there.

It's a Soviet vs a Nazi at the battle of Stalingrad so it's tough pick sides based on 2 bad ideologies. But they make the Soviet into the hero as a common 'everyman' vs the mighty German war machine.

There are some flaw. The Soviets all have British accents. And Ed Harris is the German sniper with an American accept. So that kind of takes you out of the story a little bit. But it still works.

It's not quite as great as I remember it from when I first saw the movie when it came out, but I still found it very entertaining. It's a good story. It does not do any favors for Nikita Khrushchev, making him look like a tyrannical monster (so there's some historical accuracy there).

1271733,4,B00003CXRA,"A very good movie about The Battle of Stalingrad, during WWII.
While it is not correct in every detail, it is based on true events.
This movie is based on the service of an infantry soldier that goes on to serve as a Sniper during The Battle of Stalingrad.
As a sniper, he had a great many confirmed kills of enemy Officers that served to increase the morale of the Russian troops, and the Russian people.
The Snipers were so good at what they did, that it served to hurt the morale of the German troops, and their supporters back home as well.
This long battle helped turn the tide of the war against the German forces invading Russia.
Be advised that this is a war movie, and as such, there is death and destruction(albeit simulated) that some viewers may find offensive.  Don't say that I didn't warn you.
If you are a history buff, use your favorite search engine(or your local library) to look up more information about this battle and/or other battles that took place during this terrible war that took the lives of many millions of people on numerous battle fronts  across Europe and Africa.",1510358400,2,1098,4.540404040404041

1272025,2,B00003CXRA,"Thoroughly disappointed in this movie.  I'll give it a two because of the photography.

This film has managed to reduce the deaths of 2 million human beings into a love story & the gratuitous kid ala Spielberg's Short Round & Lucas' Anakin Skywalker debacle.  Somehow, the director/producers/editors even made a hero out of Khrushchev.

Major participants in this battle are completely ignored.  The editing is poor (in one scene a soldier is frozen rock solid & 1 second later he is floppy (defrosted?) instantaneously.

The film attempts to compensate all the wishy-washy goop going on by showing horrific deaths.  But even this falls short when the movie attempts to show the child Sasha hanging with an obvious adult dummy about 18"" taller.

Not historically correct & a very sad attempt at a WW II movie.  It gives no justice to the men & women who fought & lost their lives in Stalingrad.  If you want romance & gore, with no sustenance, this movie is for you.",1493078400,3,966,4.765060240963855

1272194,5,B00003CXRA,"Having Mosin Nagant 91/30 and Mauser rifles in the collection, seems to mandate having the movie that shows the armies that used them so well!  At the ranges demonstrated in the movie, open iron sights would do just as well up to 650 meters.  Most shots were at 30 to 500 meters!

Having the DVD means I can analyze the movie, and watch it over and over.  So thankful that the Russians won, and defeated the Nazi's!
My father, Capt. Arthur Cyril Devine, piloted B-17 bombers on two war tours, for total of 50 missions, over Europe, to stifle the flow of Nazi weapons.  He bombed France (Submarine pens, air fields), from March of 1943, in 13 missions, then on to Benghazi, Libya, to bomb Sicily, then
Italy.  Next, he moved forward to Brendisi, Italy, to fly over the Alps, to bomb Germany, and the Ruhr Valley, taking out the German manufacturing centers, followed with massive attacks on the oil fields of Ploesti, Romania!  He earned several Distinguished Flying Crosses,
the Croix de Guerre with palm, issued to military units whose members performed heroic deeds in combat and were subsequently recognized by headquarters, two Purple Hearts, among others.
The awards that he earned, [...]
The war scenes of ""Enemy At The Gates"" were epic views of Artillery attacks, aerial bombardment by German forces, and ground fighting.  Well worth viewing, by anyone interested in history, war, and the technology of combat weapons. The love scenes were irrelevant to the story line, unnecessary to character development, but, allowed a bit of film time to be used to offset the tragedy, gore, heroism, bravery, courage, and horror.  I recommend you get your own DVD and at least one Mosin Nagant 91/30 rifle, with accessories!",1482278400,,1720,4.883161512027492

1272341,4,B00003CXRA,"My father was a veteran of WWII. As such, I have read many books and (of course) seen many films about the subject. I know this battle was the greatest victory by Russia against Germany during the war.

As a rule, I prefer watching a film on the subject (even a dramatic one, like this) with the characters speaking their native language (Russian and German), while using English subtitles. It is hard to do, but it can be pulled off.

However, in real life, Jude Law, Rachel Weisz, Joseph Fiennes and Bob Hoskins are all from Great Britain, so one can't expect them to be speaking Russian, anymore than to expect Ed Harris (who is from New Jersey) to be speaking German.

However, for me I made an exception to my rule, because this film is so very good.

After all is said and done, it would not be anywhere near as appealing a film without this terrific cast.

Most of all, I have to credit Darren Aronosky, who is an excellent director, and has made many other very good films. I think this is one of his best.",1473552000,,1014,4.343915343915344

Besides the story which is invented for the most part (nothing wrong with that) I did not like some things which were completely unrealistic for those times. I will refrain from mentioning them here as that would be spoilers, but suffice it to say that I know a bit about history, and three major points of the film were absolutely impossible and actually took away from the story rather than adding to it.

It is a MOVIE and as thus was meant to be enjoyed. I think this movie is important because as other interviewers have so accurately pointed out, so few Americans have any clue about what happened on the Eastern Front and how it impacted the overall outcome of the war. The acting was superb and the screen play was terrific. I place this movie in the same genre of great WWII movies such as Saving Private Ryan, Memphis Bell, Patton etc.
Uprising, and The Resistance are two movies you might want to check out. They didn't enjoy the popularity of Saving Ryan but they are fantastic movies that also inform about parts of the war the most Americans remain ignorant to. The Pianist is also one of my favorite WWII pics.
The Poles were horribly treated during AND after the war. So many cheesy WWII movies have been made this one is not one of those...its a great movie",1460419200,,1014,4.546448087431694

1272948,4,B00003CXRA,"I first watched this movie about a decade ago and it provides the audience with a breathtaking glimpse into how the Red Army and the people of the USSR fought valiantly to defend Stalingrad from the Nazi hordes in hopes of saving the Russian motherland from the jaws of fascism. Although most Americans celebrate the exploits of American airmen and soldiers who fought in Normandy and the Pacific in bringing down the German war machine, the fact that this movie highlights the titanic struggle of the Russian people to save the USSR from Hitler is one of the many reasons why Russia refers to WW2 in Europe as the Great Patriotic War, because Stalin saw Hitler's plans to enslave Slavic peoples and turn all of Slavic Europe into a German colony a mortal threat to his country's existence, and therefore came to see WW2 as a conflict to defend the Russian motherland from fascism. Also of interest about this movie is the fact that the future Soviet leader Nikita Khruschev played a role in helping the Red Army defeat the German army at Leningrad (ironically, the same man who was heavily involved in leading the Red Army to victory at Stalingrad would later denounce Stalin and his cult of personality).",1451952000,,1206,4.747619047619048

1272950,3,B00003CXRA,"It's admirable that a Hollywood movie would make a movie covering events on the Eastern Front of WW2 as it doesn't happen often, and the special effects and certain scenes are done quite well in this movie. The music is generally good but at times bombastic and overdone. The film in general is grossly inaccurate as to history and should not be taken seriously as educational or even somewhat accurately depicting historical events. It is about as historically accurate as the 1965 Battle of the Bulge film (Henry Fonda, Robert Shaw), entertaining but laughable at the same time. Taken for what it is, it is interesting whenever battle scenes are shown but lags very noticeably once the dialog takes over. From that point it becomes utterly ridiculous, especially the nonsensical romance. I can forgive the English accents but it would have been nice had the film been done in Russian and German with other languages available for subtitles. This of course would have been impractical with the chosen cast but it would have still helped things. A potentially harmful effect of watching this movie is that a lot of lazy people will watch it thinking it's true history and not just a lot of preposterous national stereotypes and myths (ie, Russians are noble, virtuous peasants and Germans are all sadistic, Nazi snobs, the biggest battle in the history of humanity was decided by two snipers, etc.). The fact of the matter is that Russians and Germans both served under cruel, murderous governments during WW2, and many people have a hard time coming to grips with the reality that Stalin was every bit as evil as Hitler. There were good and bad people on both sides. One comes away from this movie with the impression that WW2 was decided on the Western Front, and that events on the far less important or meaningful Eastern Front hinged on a duel between some British guy in a Russian uniform and a middle aged American dude in a German one.",1450224000,,1943,4.785714285714286

1273015,3,B00003CXRA,"In one of the ""special features"" accompanying this DVD, the director Jean-Jacques Annaud talks of the fascination of the ""rhythm"" of a slow, intimate story (the sniper v. sniper slow dance) set against the world-historical, densely-populated, ""action-oriented"" story of the Battle of Stalingrad in 1942-43, the battle in which the Red Army, taking horrific losses, managed to stop the eastward movement of Hitler's Nazi war machine.  The movie actually starts with an old-fashioned visual device -- the map of Europe with the black stain of Nazism spreading out from Germany in all directions, until it comes, in the east, to the Volga . . . I liked that.  It reminded me of old war movies I had enjoyed.  And the ""rhythm"" idea is kind of neat too, although it's pretty much an aesthetic indulgence on Annaud's part -- for it isn't totally credible, for all of rhetoric of the Russian propagandist commissar Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) and Nikita Khrushchev (Bob Hoskins), that victory at Stalingrad depends on the outcome of the sniper war between the Russian Vassily Zaitsev and the German master-sniper Konig (Ed Harris).  One has to give some credit to the set-designers -- the ruined Stalingrad is well presented and at times spectacularly filmed, whether in its details or in  the wider picture.  But that's it -- for the film is hollow at the core:  these cast members have done very good work in other movies, and they go at it like true professionals here, but they're given nothing to work on in terms of character.  Such back-stories as we get are very sketchy, and it's as if they have no lives beyond the exigencies of the plot.  The spicing up of a degree of rivalry between Danilov and Zaitsev, erstwhile friends, because of the presence of Rachel Weisz as a fetching woman soldier looks like a desperate attempt to inject ""human interest,"" but it doesn't go anywhere except a rather stereotyped reconciliation near the end.  Rachel Weisz is capable of really engaging characterization (like Harris and Hoskins), but she too is given little to work with.  Hoskins's Khrushchev is a very broad caricature -- basically, ""I've come to Stalingrad to kick ass, take names, and in so doing turn back the Nazis"" -- and the timeworn contrast between the heroic common soldiers and the brutal officers is played out once again.  I think we see more Russians killed by Russians than by Nazis.  Even allowing for some truth to that, it seems over-the-top here, and one can understand why the Russians found the movie offensive.  Just about all the close-up brutality in the movie is committed by them.  In the German scenes, it's pretty much Ed Harris with his boss or alone.  I see the movie as really wasting the talents of some good character-actors.  Moment by moment, it isn't boring -- but when one reflects back on it, there's not much there.",1447113600,,2850,4.843298969072165

Why the German Paratroopers dropped into hell, hence the special Medal made for the survivors of that battle (the CRETA MEDAL). Basically they were delayed for six months & they got trapped in the vastness of Russia in temperatures that actually froze the Gasoline in the Tanks.  Entering that bit of historical truth.  IT WAS BASICALLY A BATTLE OF NO RETREAT FOR BOTH SIDES.  Stalingrad, had to be  held at any cost by the Russians.  Because the name Had a big meaning for them, Also for the Germans,  it was the same idea. Now, Ed Harris, brought in as the ace Elite German sniper brought in to get rid of an unknown, by chane sniper Jude Law, who definitely gets the attention of the lll R. & Bob hoskins playing the Role of Krushchev. Making him a kind of super soldier,  very clever of course (Moral). Is everything. Now the action begins an excellent game of cat & mouse.

1273347,5,B00003CXRA,"I really thought the cast and crew did a wonderful job in making this film.  The opening scenes are enough to make you aware of how really bad the situation was in the Soviet Union shortly after the German invasion.  did the film makers exaggerate?  I think not as much as the traditional writeup would lead us to believe.  I thought Bob Hoskins playing Khruchov conveyed a harshness in dealing with army officers and the situation as a whole that seemed very Russian (and Ukrainian) to me.  In writing the characters of Zaitsev, the university trained local girl and the political worker the film makers cought much of what I would consider legitimate character types of that era.  Ron Pearlman is great and what he has to say about Soviet-German relations before the outbreak of war is worth listening to. Stalin virtually destroyed the Soviet military during the 30s.  Some viewers did not like the romance as part of tthe movie.  Conducting a major battle in an urban area means interaction between military and civilian personnel.  So the local little boy played a very dangerous game going between Soviet and German units, so young men and women will snatch bits of time for love and sex.  You will find romance in the best of Soviet war related fiction.  This whole film reminds me so much of Konstantine Siminov's Dni i Nochi or though it deals with the Civil War, M. Sholokhov's Tixii Don.  I spent years of my academic career reading Soviet literature, many trips there including Volgagrad.  I spent hours in the historical museum, probably saw Zaitsev's gun.  For a 67 year old lady I really thought they cought many of the key points on the event.",1430956800,12,1659,4.715277777777778

1273453,5,B00003CXRA,"One of the best movies ever in my opinion. War stories are a great stage for Hollywood due to the nature of everything being condensed into minute, by minute, raw emotion, and reality. For the war story buff a very realistic narrative of the battle of Stalingrad, quite simply the turning point in the war against Nazi Germany, and in many opinions the bloodiest battle in the history of mankind. For the pacifist the story glorifies victory over evil, while at the same time showing war at it's most basic aspect as being inherently evil. But the real reason I wrote this review is because in many of the reviews the romantic aspect of the movie is questioned. It's not just Hollywood here. It is quite simple the most carefully crafted rebuke of Communism ever; In the scene where the political officer dies, where he allows the German sniper to shoot him, to expose the German snipers position, he states the error of socialist theory. "" We thought we could create the perfect society, but we forgot about envy."" Beautiful!",1429228800,3,1026,4.705555555555556

1273569,5,B00003CXRA,"A real sniper movie compared against the uncharacteristically heavyhanded, superficial, and just plain unengaging Clint Eastwood I have never seen. Totally inept. He luckily caught a moment when Americans were desperate for a hero. What kind of hero. He sits back up to a mile from his targets and decides finally to give it up when, at least in themovie, he participates in his first real close qurters firefight. He comes home between tours just long enough to get his wife pregnant again and then takes off. He had, in the movie, an over inflated sense of his own importance to the war effort to the exclusion of consideration of his responsibilities to his wife and children. The acting of the lead character was totally shallow running the gamut of emotions from A to B. I totally did not care when the Kyle character died at the end. I never ""bonded"" with him emotionally. Eastwood at perhaps his least skillful. Maybe, time to retire. ENEMY AT THE GATES however is a masterful battle between two master snipers and their motivations. The acting is superb, the story nuanced and multilayered and photography engaging and relevant rather than simply ""there"" as it was in American Sniper. ENEMY AT THE GATES is how classics are made.",1425340800,,1237,4.812206572769953

1273615,5,B00003CXRA,"The siege of Stalingrad during WWII was a exercise of desperation for both the Russian residents and the invading Germans.  Unheeded lessons of history continue to punish both the ignorant and the arrogant.  Nikita Khrushchev, one of Stalin's last remaining military leaders after one of his legendary purges was hard pressed to give his people hope and the will to fight in such abdominal circumstances.  One of his propaganda officers had just been saved by a man from the interior that was raised by his grandfather to hunt and thus a excellent shot.  This story too was repeated during America's Civil War.  Southern men lived a rural existence with much of their sustenance coming from the bush and woods.  Northern men had long since migrated to the cities where earning a living became a year round affair unlike early northerners, where winters limited families tables to hunting activities.  In the battle of Stalingrad, snipers became the heroes and hope for the city's beleaguered residents.  This movie is excellent and well worth seeing.",1424390400,,1050,5.063953488372093

1273710,5,B00003CXRA,"ENEMY AT THE GATES has grown on me. It focuses on the cat and mouse tactics employed by the German Major Konig (Ed Harris) and Soviet Vassily Zaitzev (Jude Law), both snipers trying to bring the other out into the open in the fight for Stalingrad during WWII. The film constantly shifts focus between the Soviet propaganda officer (Joseph Fiennes) and female Soviet soldier (Rachel Weisz) in a curious love triangle. This adds to the drama and gives it a human element. By the time of the denouement there is no emotion left. This is heartbreaking stuff. The only emotion felt, is delivered by James Horner's score during the scenes when the two men actually do confront each other. But the war, its devastation on personal humanity seems to be the focus here. The casting of Ed Harris is interesting. We kind of think that maybe he will not be that bad of a guy. When he arrives he uses a standard military salute when reporting. I thought that was significant. However, we see the fate of a young Russian boy who had been giving information to Major Konig throughout the film. That boy's fate brings to reality the true nature of this conflict.

HART'S WAR is an incredible WWII film set in a German POW camp. Bruce Willis plays Col. William A. McNamara, senior ranking American officer in the camp. Colin Farrell plays Lt. Thomas W. Hart, who has been recently captured during the Battle of the Bulge. Hart had attended Yale Law School. There is a murder in the camp and a downed Tuskegee Airmen is accused of the murder. Col. McNamara organizes a court-martial with the permission of the camp commandant Visser, played by Marcel Iure, and Lt. Hart is chosen to defend him. The court-martial is an elaborate ruse to cover a planned escape and more. HART'S WAR is an interesting film. It is worth seeing to watch Bruce Willis' performance. Bruce Willis' Col. William A. McNamara is a very strange character as probes and manipulates people and events. I thought Rachel Portman's score was very interesting and brought out the underlying humanity of what unfolded. HART'S WAR is an incredible film and that is just the point. It is a dark and moody film, but under it all, it lacks credibility. If HART'S WAR had been simply an outright battle of wits between Col. McNamara and commandant Visser I think it would have fared much better.

WINDTALKERS is a good WWII movies filmed over the past few years in that brings attention to these uniquely qualified men of war to draw upon their heritage in this time of global conflict. It is a multi-layered and multi-faceted tale told visually through incredible images enhanced with armor piercing sound effects. The dialogue really has to take a back seat to this simple tale of men and their survival because the images of the land, the bleak faces and the carnage tell it all. This film is named WINDTALKERS but the film does not really focus on the code developed by the Navajo Marines. Director Raoul Walsh had peripherally addressed the Navajo code in 1955 with his film BATTLE CRY with Felix Noriego as Marine Crazy Horse where we saw Japanese operators baffled while listening in on radio and field-telephone transmissions. Director John Woo, as did Raoul Walsh, decides to focus his attention on the men and their diverse backgrounds and what makes them Marines. However, Woo narrows his focus on the relationship between a war-weary, shell-shocked and enigmatic Marine sergeant (Nicolas Cage) and a good-natured naive Navajo recruit (Adam Beach) assigned to him. Beach can't understand the actions or behavior of loner Cage's intensity for killing and bloodshed but learns eventually that if you survive you then increase your chances of having your comrades around you survive as well. Woo is a director noted for action and WINDTALKERS contains some of the most frenetically staged sequences ever filmed. These sequences reminded me of some of Sam Peckinpah's cathartic work from THE WILD BUNCH, the montages of the combat maelstrom of his CROSS OF IRON and the intensity of the intimate fighting of combatants from Edward Zwick's Civil War epic GLORY. This is not action for the sake of action that can be easily labeled on John Woo. Woo is making a statement that all this carnage can be addictive yet simultaneously it usually creates and strengthens intimate camaraderie. But you really can never afford to be close to any of your buddies and this is a highly moral conflict. Is battle weary hardness a symptom or a mechanism to survive? This is the price of defending the ideals that we hold so dear. This is a very subtle and great film that can be easily glossed right over for its true meaning and realization. WINDTALKERS draws attention to forgotten heroes.",1421625600,,4724,4.809348093480935

This is the story of Vassili Zaitsev a real life Russian sniper who became famous as an excellent Marksmen during the battle.  The film shows the interaction between the Russians in the sniper unit as they work hard and under very difficult conditions to kill Germans soldiers. Jude law is Zaitsev and does a very good job as a young man who finds himself made a hero in a situation he does not really want to be in.  Joseph Fiennes is Danilov, a Russian officer, who finds Zaitsev and sort of markets him to the Russian people in Stalingrad as the Hero of the Day. Rachel Weisz is the love interest of Vassili and Danilov, but unfortunately she is not interested in Danilov.  The German army send for Major Konig a German sniper of great skill to hunt down Zaitsev and kill him.  The following game of cat and mouse is very well done. The tension experienced by both men is very real.  Even thou the outcome is known before the movie starts the journey is worth the watch.

1273839,3,B00003CXRA,"This move has nothing wrong with it that I can tell.  A young country boy finds his niche in the Red Army and helps save the day for the Soviets during the crucial, six month long, battle for Stalingrad....a battle on which the war may truly have turned.  (If the Nazis has won, they may have had a clear road to Asian oil fields).  But for all of that, and the well done footage of big battle scenes, it's hard to get too excited by the action.  The character played by Joseph Fiennes, Danilov, is repulsive, and yet he is the hero's best friend.  Hmmm.  The only person I cared about in the entire film was little Sasha, a young boy working as a double agent.  Yes, the Soviets deserve their due for the sacrifices they made during the war (and this film glosses over the damage Stalin did to the Soviet military before the war, crippling it), but that film may come another day.",1419552000,,881,4.303030303030303

1273842,4,B00003CXRA,"Why Hollywood has to stick love scenes in a war movie is beyond me. With that said, I finally purchased this movie for my library of favorites. The opening scenes are like that in ""Saving Private Ryan"" and gets your attention right up front. The opening scenes are, in fact, very factual as relayed by surviving troops who were at the ""Battle of Stalingrad.""

If you like the Mosin-Nagant 91/30 and arms like the German Karabiner 98 Kurz and other Soviet/German weapons of the era, you will love the historical use of these weapons in the movie.

The mental gymnastics of the cat-n-mouse game played by the Russian and German snipers is well worth the view (the Hollywood view, that is). While fictional, the film is loosely based on war stories told by Soviet sniper Vasily Zaitsev who died in 1991. There ware many fine Russian snipers, both male and female, and this is but one story - but a good one.",1419033600,,904,4.574074074074074

Enemy at the Gates concentrates on two snipers, one from Russia and one from Germany in the Battle of Stalingrad.  The Russians do NOT want to lose the battle for the city named after ""The Boss"".  It would be most horrific.  The acting is very good.  Ed Harris, playing German Major Knig is a detached killer.  Jude Law as Vassili Zaitsev, is a peasant from the Urals.  He happens to be a good shot.  His ""good shot"" turns into a thing of legend among the Russians and soon not only is he a huge part of their propaganda, but he attains a hero-like status.

The two snipers play a game of human chess between each other.  This is a deep movie and, again, disregarding the love story and superfluous Hollywood BS, this is a great historical story.",1410652800,,967,4.370786516853933

1274236,3,B00003CXRA,"I kept meaning to watch this movie as I find WWII history particularly fascinating, and there are so few movies based on the Eastern front. Well, I finally watched it and have to say I'm a bit disappointed.

While it is an entertaining watch, I felt like they went a bit heavy handed on the anti-socialist propaganda. It almost seemed as if the screenwriter or the director was worried somebody might call them a ""Dirty Commie"" if they portrayed the Soviets in too positive a manner, so they overcompensated by inserting various digs in the dialogue and included a huge emphasis on scenes depicting the cruelty of the Soviet officers against their own troops. Danilov's  ""Rich in love, poor in love"" speech at the end about how Socialism must be a farce because he didn't get the girl is particularly cringe worthy, as is the bizarre, out of place pro-Isreal rhetoric that Tania spews when she explains how she learned to shoot (""My father taught me, he was saving up to buy land in palestine, that's the only land we have a right to defend""... blah blah etc etc). All of these things would be a lot less annoying had the Nazi's been portrayed as badly, but rather disturbingly (aside from Tania reading about what happened to her parents, and Major Konig's singular act of cruelty at the end) the Germans come out of this film looking pretty rosey, perhaps even professional or honorable. Most of the atrocities committed by the Nazis were committed on the eastern front and without providing any depiction of these atrocities there is no preface to explain the desperation of the situation the Soviets were facing.

All that being said, the effects are good, the photography is good, the acting isn't bad and the love story isn't too painfully mushy. It's not my favorite WWII movie but I'd watch it again. I'm not sure I'd recommend it though, as there are much better WWII movies out there. For anyone interested in the Eastern front, I'd probably recommend the 2009 film  Attack On Leningrad as an alternative.",1408320000,,2015,4.732193732193732

It's a horrible movie that doesn't miss a beat in demonizing Russian people. In spite of an end blurb about ""the Soviet Union's victory"" or some such thing, it makes the Red Army look like a bunch of thugs and slobs, at best, and spares no opportunity to use the most base anti-Soviet stereotypes. Especially today, it certainly fits the narrative of those who desire conflict with Russia.

The NKVD shooting the retreating soldiers with machine guns is exactly the way the Red Army did things. The NKVD
morphed into the KGB which morphed into the FSB which morphed into those Spetsnaz bastards murdering civilians
in Ukraine. The NKVD commissars were largely Jewish as was Danilov. Hard not to sympathize with Zaitsev, an
authentic hero. Ron Perlman does a great job as always. Bob Hoskins did Kruschev perfectly. Most of the people who died on the  Soviet side were not Russians, but rather Beloruthenes and Ukrainians.  The people died really for nothing except Stalin's whims.
After the War, many of the surviving Soviet folks were sent to the Gulag (as was Solzenitsyn). It was such a war that one wishes

The sparkle was that at least the talents of some was recognized.  Thus, the importance of the sniper.  Talent to be nurtured.

Yes, those things are important but not to the exclusion of everything else. Battle of Stalingrad? Fact. Two snipers from opposing sides?  Fact. All the details of this movie about their lives?  Well.........
If you aren't such an historical purist that you can't accept some embellishments that are intended to broaden the interested audience, then you will enjoy the beauty of this film that is made about the Center of Hell.

Settings of war:  disorderly, random destruction. Chaos and tension.
Cinematography:  excellent, especially since most scenes were during dark winter months in dust-filled air or candle-lit interiors.
Casting and acting:  excellent!  The right people were shrewd, demanding, selfishly brave, selflessly brave, cruel, cold, deadly, innocent, tender, wary, attentive, wistful, warm, frightened, clever, wise, friendly, false friends, hateful and loving.
Pace:  never slow!
Sound and music:  appropriately warlike.
Resolution of all characters and ending:  unforgettable.

This is now one of my favorite movies! I recommend watching with a Russian friend, as I did. If that's not practical for you, don't worry!  You will understand everything. Also, one thing many people will love:  no English sub-titles; not necessary.

I would love to think of some clever way to end my review to make myself look witty but the truth is, this movie is so pure and raw and wonderful that I just want to say WATCH IT! Don't judge it based on history. Instead, step into the whirling, chaotic, dusty world of war and you will be so involved with its beauty and tension that you will be sorry when it ends.

1274581,4,B00003CXRA,"This film has been on my back burner for quite a while and I'm glad I finally got around to watching it. The first 20 mins. or so is very similar to the beginning of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. It spares nothing showing the horror and fear of going into battle. The troops got it on both sides. From the German on one end and there own commanders on the other. According to what I have read, this is pretty factual. Stalin had given orders there wasn't any retreating, what so ever. The performances were pretty good for the most part. There is no attempt though, to try and have a Russian accent or German for the most part I personally would rate it up there with the previous mentioned film and THE LONGEST DAY.",1399161600,,707,4.2835820895522385
1274582,3,B00003CXRA,"When going into this film it is best to remember that it is a fictional story based on the Battle of Stalingrad. While the film does do justice to some aspects of the battle it falls short elsewhere. The first twenty to thirty minutes throws a lot at the viewer. We get to experience the horrors of the War and political officers spreading propaganda to raise moral or to shoot deserters and cowards. From the first charge it's clear that the Russians are under equipped to hold back the German lines; half of the troops get a rifle while the other half holds a clip of ammo. The charge fails and the Russians retreat only to be killed by the NKVD who were following order 227 the famous no step back propaganda which was supposed to promote patriotism and bravery.  In the Initial phases the Soviets fought hard, they resisted in a ruined city which to a lot seemed already lost.

 The movie lost me at times after the beginning. The love story seemed lack lustered and for me and was nothing more than a hindrance to the plot.  The rest of the issues stem from history and are just things I would have liked to be included. The battle of Stalingrad was one of the costliest battles in the war. The civilian deaths alone are huge; and many of them starved to death while other resorted to eating whatever they could find which included wallpaper and in extreme cases cannibalism. The movie depicts little when it comes to civilian hardships. I wish the director would have used Russian actors; several actors had heavy English accents. I also wished the characters would have acted more Russian.

 All in all Enemy at the Gates is entertaining it does have its flaws but as long as you are willing to look past them the movie is worth a watch. Also for a similar movie in setting try the movie Stalingrad directed by Joseph Vilsmaier which follows Germans and depicts the horrors of war instead of glorifying it.",1398902400,2,1913,4.530434782608696
1274583,3,B00003CXRA,"I want to love this film. There are moments when I really do - the progression from the train car, the crossing of the Volga, the first battle with the NKVD lining up behind the troops and gunning them down as they retreat from an impossible assault, it's all very good and accurate. Then, the film takes this hard turn towards convenience and contrivance. The forced relationship between Danielov and Zaitsev, the relationship with the girl it interferes, for me, with the narrative of the place. Stalingrad was the place that the Nazi irresistible force met the unyielding Soviet resolve - a million people died within that cauldron in a 6 month time span - and yet the film lingers in basements and propaganda. Ed Harris kinda mails this one in, you can almost see him counting his paycheck and wondering if it will be enough to tide him over while he makes Pollock. Still, in the modern cannon of war films, this manages to deliver a few great moments, a stunning score, and some nods to actual events. For those interested, I recommend the book ""Stalingrad"" by Anthony Beevor, and then consider this as a fine piece of 21st century propaganda.",1398816000,5,1148,4.688118811881188

The movie tells the story of a Russian infantryman who has some shooting skills during the time when the Germans were trying to take Stalingrad during WWII. In the ends it turns into a cat and mouse game between the Russian sniper and a German colonel sniper. The German is a bit older and has more experience, but the Russian has good instincts. There is some romance, and one scene of the Russian making love in to a women in foxhole type conditions. Sex-wise, that's the worst it gets.

1274717,5,B00003CXRA,"Extremely well acted and directed war film based on a non-fiction book written by William Craig. Set in the dark days of the German onslaught against the Russian city, Stalingrad from 1942-1943. The story is based somewhat loosely on a real Russian sniper (and ultimately a national hero), Vasily Zaitsev. Having an avid interest in WWII story-telling films, I found that this movie gets almost all the details correct, including period Russian firearms and equipment. Jude Law, Rachel Weisz, Bob Hoskins, Joseph Fiennes, and Ed Harris turn in superior performances. The film portrays violence in a very realistic manner, which might cause younger viewers a little pain, but fortunately violence does not make up the better part of the movie. I'm giving this film five stars, not because it's a favorite of mine (although I liked it very much), but because it is a well-directed, well-acted intense drama that is of the highest technical quality and uses historical events with superb accuracy.",1393718400,3,994,5.1419753086419755

1274722,4,B00003CXRA,"Wildly entertaining, but as an historian, it is not as accurate as it could be.  Granted Hollywood is Hollywood.  But the Germans did not just suffer from snipers; the Soviets perfected urban warfare in Stalingrad.  Unlike most of the battles of the Soviet-German War, the Soviets caused as many casualties as they took.  Yes, Stalin's infamous 'no retreat' order was carried out in some instances, but usually the comissars and rear units could cajole the shirkers back to the front.  Plus with a river at your back, it is not easy to retreat in the first place.  The video also makes no mention of the Soviet counter offensives on the North bank of the Don River's bend that diverted more and more German forces there.

Bob Hoskins is excellent as a younger Nikita Kruschev who plays Stalin's personal political representative on site.

1275001,3,B00003CXRA,"I started watching this with a friend, but had to go home an hour into it. Intrigued by the premise, I decided to rent it on Amazon in order to finish the movie...
And by the time I got to the end of the film I was thoroughly done with it.  Here's why:

(SPOILERS)
1) Historically inaccurate: I generally take this for granted with these kinds of movies. However, this one was off enough that even my eye was starting to twitch. See other reviews as to how.

2) Plot: It started off strong, and then devolved into a silly romantic plot. Some reviewers have said that this was to attract a female audience. Well, as a female, I'll tell you I'm more turned off than pulled in. Such a pity too. Russia was one of the few places were women were openly wearing a uniform, fighting on the battlefields and piloting fighter planes. When they introduced Tanya initially, I was pleased they were going to give a nod to this. I had to take a swig of whiskey to suppress my groan when I realized that she was never going to be shown shooting anybody, and was reduced to a glorified camp follower. Not that I was expecting rambo, but it's almost like this movie played right into the vein of reasoning that several people are still using to keep military women out of combat positions today: if we put them in the field, they'll be sexually distracting.

I was excited about the sniper battle, but it became so many repetitive head shots that it was like watching a Gears of War video of game play performed by a kid who stays rooted in front of his/her xbox. Also, where did the war go? For the entire sniper duel, there was no one else on the field. Did the Germans and Russians just get tired of fighting each other and say ""Hey, look,let's send our two best snipers in, and whoever loses has to leave Stalingrad."" It sure felt that way, especially since the movie just cut to a liberated Stalingrad after the German sniper was blow away. What an insult to every veteran of that battle!

3) Acting: Well, it certainly wasn't the worst I've seen, but OUCH. They had a solid cast, but what the heck was up with the accents? While I'm glad none of the leads tried to feign a Russian accent, having a mix of British, American, and slap-dash German and Russian was just painful. There was one ridiculous moment at beginning where the Russian commander starts off yelling in a Russian accent, fluctuates to a British and then back into Russian. Also the German Sniper rocked back and forth between a watery German accent and English accent in a couple places. Line delivery was ok, but there was really no chemistry between the actors at all and certainly no fire. It's what I'd imagine you'd get if you took Band of Brothers, and gave it a hearty dose of Valium. When the Russian political officer took one for the team at the end, I felt nothing. That is not how one should feel after that sort of thing.

3)Dialogue: Wow. This movie has some of the least memorable dialogue I've ever come across. I just finished watching it an hour ago and there is not one single line I remember. It was overloaded with banal political statements. The dialogue was so trite, that I often found myself wishing for the battle scenes to resume because they said so much more than the dialouge.

All and all, it was just mediocre. It had so much potential.",1382572800,,3325,4.423202614379085

I have been a fanatic about anything Soviet since I was in high school, so this film hits all the right notes for me.  Yes, its a fictional story based on history (there was a real Vasili Zaitsev who was a real sniper during the real Battle of Stalingrad), and yes, it teems with anti-communist propaganda, even so many years after the Cold War.  All in all, though, it is an action-packed, suspenseful, and entertaining movie about a Soviet sniper defending Stalingrad from the Nazis.  For God's sake, it has Bob Hoskins as a spot-on Nikita Khrushchev.  What more could you ask for, really?  Additionally, Blu-Ray version looks pretty damn good.",1374969600,3,798,4.538461538461538
1275145,4,B00003CXRA,"The grim despair of WW II's Eastern Front is here reconstricted in full-spectrum brutality. Arnaud not only gives us a candid look at the devastation of civilization in bombed-out cities, the dashing of all human hopes and dreams as survivors are forced to dwell in cellars like rats, but also their desperation to reclaim their humanity by fighting for hope itself.

Arnaud gives the standard Western view of Soviet Communism as a false hope, engineered by agitprop artists to keep the masses struggling on for the synthetic agendas which led to the very devastation in which these survivors scramble.  This analysis is captured in the Koulikov character, who reiterates nearly every Western cliche in just a few lines.  And, most explicitly, in Commissar Danilov putting himself in the line of fire for a Nazi bullet, plowing into the brain of a Jewish-Marxist intellectual stripped of his BS and willingly dying rather than face the real world.  A Tory wet dream indeed, as is the entire film's Burkian subtext.

But Arnaud's cynicism applies equally to other illusions fostered by other leaders in rituals of official violence: making a Free World, safe for democracy under the rule of law.  One can only wish that modern commissars, offering the same solace to human rats in the caves of Afghanistan and Iraq, would be as honest in recognizing their own futility, and resolve it accordingly.",1374883200,,1396,5.021645021645021

The acting was very good although there should have been richer dialogue.
I was not expecting this movie to provide such an insight into the world of a sniper, which I've always been interested in. This movie mostly follows the movement of the two men, which was highly entertaining. I did not know there was so much strategy involved in sniping.
I also appreciate the profiling of the Stalingrad battles, which were astounding. I've never known the battles were so gruesome.
Overall, this movie was very dark and it sort of mixed the sadness with the triumph.
I still give it five stars; I love the story.",1371859200,2,688,4.647540983606557

After seeing this movie I would like to think I have a pretty good idea where the writers/director added their 'artistic discretion' but either way it makes for an enjoyable story. Taking place at the turn of the tide in Stalingrad during WWII, an average infantryman becomes a hero for the Russian army by being the inspiration of a sniper team and the face for a propoganda campaign.

1275306,5,B00003CXRA,"An interesting film for the Nagant Revolver or Mosin Nagant collector. They are everywhere in this film !

Although this film is successful in having the viewer rooting for the Russian Sniper, Vassili, overall I had very mixed feelings. The immediate characters are well constructed, and we care for them. Yet when it comes right down to it, both sides of this conflict, Stalinist Russia and Nazi Germany, were deplorable constructs. Rather than have either win, it would be preferable both should lose.

I enjoyed seeing Nikita Krushshev as a character. From what I know of him, he was accurately portrayed here. Shrewd, tough, ruthless, but no Sociopath, as Stalin and Hitler both clearly were. The Additonal Scenes are particularly good at fleshing out his character. They should not have been cut from the Theatrical Release.

The cruelty of Russian Political Correctness is evident throughout. Saying the wrong thing or having the wrong attitude is punished severely. Vassili grew up on a farm, where they needed to hunt for food, and needed to protect livestock from wolves. But when the Commissars discovered his Grandfather kept a rifle for this purpose, he was taken away, never to be seen again. The Cult of Personality is also shown; enormous portraits and statues of Stalin litter the landscape. Excuse me for stating I see some stark parallels to our modern day USA, where our Speech is strictly monitored, our Right to Bear Arms is under constant assault, and we have elevated a Community Organizer as our new God.",1367020800,,1528,4.984313725490196
1275307,5,B00003CXRA,"I have seen many war movies, but very few like ""Enemy At The Gates"".  Set during the siege of Stalingrad in 1942, this movie tells the story of Russian super sniper Vasilli Zaitsev and his duel with the German sniper, Maj. Konig, sent to kill him.  Besides Vasilli and Konig, the main characters include Soviet commander Nikita Khrushchev, Danilov, a political officer who befriends Vasilli, Tania Chernova, the beautiful soldier who falls in love with Vasilli and Danilov, and her family.

This movie portrays the savagery of the Eastern Front.  What really sets this apart from other movies is the non-stop intensity.  Whereas other movies often show breaks in the action, this one shows the characters living their lives amidst the ruin of war.  In this it is probably an accurate portrayal of a city and an army under siege.  As this involved a war between Germans and Russians, I did not have much emotional investment in either side so I could watch the action with more objectivity than is the case in movies such as ""Saving Private Ryan.""  I watched this in preparation for a class I was teaching on World War II.  I found it to be a great aid to understanding the nature of the war in the east.",1366502400,,1203,4.636792452830188

1275399,5,B00003CXRA,"I have seen ""Enemy at the Gates"" probably half a dozen times, and it is rare that I ever sit through any motion picture twice.  Jude Law is Vasily Zaitsev, one of Russia's great heroes of WWII, who was a highly-decorated sniper during the battle of Stalingrad.  The often-ignored eastern front of the Nazi regime is portrayed through a gripping microcosm as the battle for that strategic city on the Volga River is  played out through a duel between Zaitsev and his German sniper nemesis, Major Koenig.  The battle scenes show how desperate and brutal Russia's war was, for soldiers and civilians alike.  There is a subplot of a love story between Zaitsev and a female Russian soldier (Rachel Weisz).  She is convincing and serves to humanize Zaitsev, as he becomes a reluctant hero, and a pawn of the propaganda war.  Ed Harris--with those unforgettable blue eyes and cat-like coiled menace--is perfectly cast as the German sniper.  His quiet, grim, cat-and-mouse game with Zaitsev is the heart and soul of this movie and is played to perfection.  Jude Law turns in a flawless performance as a ""shepherd boy from the Urals"" whom fate has thrown into a key role in the defense of his country.  He is the Sergeant York of Russian lore.  Jude Law  manages to portray the emotional journey from Zaitsev's initial rural naivete to that of an intelligent and cunning, worthy opponent for one of Germany's top sharpshooters.  Gripping story.  Fantastic performances across the board.  Only one thing:  viewers who like their fare light, feel-good, romantic, filmed with vaseline lenses etc, and without violence or blood are unlikely to be charmed by the subject matter or the flat-out realism of the battle scenes and general milieu.  I direct them instead to ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" or ""Mary Poppins"".",1362787200,2,1799,4.923588039867109
1275400,4,B00003CXRA,I have always enjoyed this film.  Performances are solid and presumably an accurate portrayal of the battle from one sniper's point of view.,1362614400,,140,5.086956521739131
1275401,5,B00003CXRA,"This movie is great if you have a love for WWII history, in particular the Russian/German aspect of the war.  If you are a firearms lover, and have a fondness for the Mosin Nagant, you are REALLY going to love this movie.  Well written, well acted, well worth the price.",1362614400,,270,4.38
1275462,5,B00003CXRA,I really liked this movie. It was better than I thought it was going to be. This cat and mouse game of two snipers is worth a look.,1362182400,,131,3.7142857142857144

1275464,5,B00003CXRA,"Although some history of the battle for Stalingrad by Germany and the Soviet Union
in 1942-43 were not historically correct, the over all view was true as to the brutality of the war between Russia and Germany.  When I taught U.S or World history I talked about the Eastern Front including the Battle for Stalingrad ( most teachers don't even mention the Eastern front.  But I did, Leningrad (900 days) the close call about losing Moscow and the Battle of Kursk.  But to show the brutality of the Eastern Front I  show Enemy at the Gates, which had to throw in a romance, which didn't happen, to please women who watched the film. My students couldn't believe that one could have romance and sex under those conditions.  The part of Khrushchev  played by Bob Hoskins is quite notable as when he arrives at Stalingrad by boat to stiffen the resolve of the Russian troops he looks and acts almost like Khrushchev, he is quite noticeable if  one knows what the future leader of Russia looked like.  He certainly plays the role well in the speeches he gives, although no one really knows what he said.  Ed Harris is especially good as the German sniper who comes to Stalingrad to find and kill the Russian sniper.  He is as cool and  deliberative as  you would expect from a German(SS) sniper.  Finny is  very cool and humble about his gift as a good sniper who grew up on the Siberian plains with his grandfather having taught him how to hide and shoot the wolves, and hide he does on the Russian front.  His friend and college and political commissar  helps his career by making him a hero by using the power of the Soviet press to highlight it. A really well done film that was nominated for several Oscars Including supporting actor for Ed Harris, best picture, etc. But he highest award it got was for original screen play.",1361145600,,1824,4.532110091743119
1275465,5,B00003CXRA,"For those of you who like WWII movies do not overlook this gem! It tells the story of snipers in the Battle of Stalingrad. It shows memorable battle sequences (both infantry and sniper).  It does well with a fictionalized account of the historical sniper duel of the Russian Sniper, Vasily Grigoryevich Zaytsev and Nazi Sniper Erwin Knig. It also shows female Russian snipers (They existed and were as tough and skilled as their male counterparts, ex: Lyudmila Mykhailivna Pavlichenko) One big plus in this movie is they actually got the scope right! Instead of blacking out a ring and putting crosshairs on a screen. You are actually seeing what a sniper would be seeing. 5/5 Great Movie, must watch!",1361059200,,701,4.890756302521009

1275467,4,B00003CXRA,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, enough that I began doing additional reading and research on The Battle of Stalingrad. If you believe that only the Americans and British suffered during WWII, you need to watch this movie and read up on The Battle of Stalingrad and Operation Uranus. The tenacity of the Russian troops and the Nazi defeat at Stalingrad was the beginning of the end for the Third Reich.",1360800000,,402,4.757142857142857

1275470,4,B00003CXRA,"This is a bit different than the traditional World War II movie, and is extremely fascinating as it delves into the lives of various people affected by war, revealing the humanity behind war. It also shows the grit and determination of those who are dedicated to protecting their friends and countrymen from invasive enemies. It centers around Jude Law as a Russian army sniper and his standoff with a German sniper. It is a cat-and-mouse game as each man tries to get inside the other's head in an effort to lure him into a trap where he can be taken out with a sniper shot. This is an intriguing look at another side of what goes on during wartime.",1359331200,,650,4.470588235294118

1275505,1,B00003CXRA,"This movie was poorly made, as in, it is one of the most historically inaccurate movies I have ever seen.  Only Mel Gibsons Brave heart might be even less historically accurate than this.  I don't know why so many directors and writers have to put the stupid, stupid love triangle in a movie.  All the kill moments were head shots.  Again, Stupid.  Granted, yes, it is a movie, but a movie is still a movie and some movies are just stupid.  I bought this a couple years ago and I don't think i have a greater regret in my life, than sitting down and watching this movie.  Though i do enjoy Jude Law, and Ed Harris, i just think both characters were crap.  Of course in the Typical Western movie style; Germans are all evil Nazi monsters who eat children and execute everyone Mercilessly.  The Russians are a proud people, that are ""Valiant and Honorable"", yet committed the same, and worse War Crimes than the Nazi Germans did.  Honestly, this movie was just terrible.  Don't waste your money.  Maybe this is just my opinion.

 Historically Inaccurate, boring plot, stupid kill scenes,and A-Typical depiction of the Factions in the movie.",1357948800,2,1138,4.653266331658291

1275509,4,B00003CXRA,"An interesting flick. Showing a glimpse of the horrors of WWII. Not a good film for children or those with weak stomachs. The nudity scene was unneccessary.

The portion of the film devoted to Kruchev shows just how much of a dispical man he was. A truly evil man who did take the life's of hundreds of thousand people to gain power.

This film gives one a feeling of what Stalingrad must have been like during the fighting from more of the Russian point of view.",1357603200,,463,4.372093023255814

1275577,4,B00003CXRA,"Bought this after seeing it on Amazon Instant Video and having a World War II hankering. I hadn't seen it in something like eight or nine years, so it was interesting to re-experience. It's not quite as good as my once-teenage mind believed, not least of all because I'm now old enough to realize that an English accent is not a Russian accent.

That aside, it's still a great movie to watch, even if bits are historically off here and there. I always preferred it more for it's slower take on action scenes rather than a history lesson, so keeping that it mind helps take some of the heat off its weirder elements.

In the end, I'm not sure it's worth full price when I got it after all this time, but I also can't say I regret buying it. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone interested in World War II as a hobby rather than a passion.",1356825600,,840,4.310126582278481

There are many reasons why I love this movie, chief among this being the music that James Horner composes, one of the only movie soundtracks that I have purchased.  Another reason is how well the action and violence is portrayed.  It casts a stark and indifferent light to how unforgiving something as horrible as war is, and does well to express that horror to a viewer whom (more than likely) has not experienced such a travesty.

The last thing I think I would have to mentioned are the actors, which perform their roles with a genuine feel that accentuates the tense foreboding of their character's times.

1275875,5,B00003CXRA,"I found it to be a good movie that acurately portrayed the Battle of Stalingrad and the true story of these two snipers that fought it out to the death. Many have said that it is insulting to the Russian people in the way that the soldiers were locked in box cars and shot by their own officers, but in reality, both of these things really happened to prevent desertion. Stalin even said in his speech at the Battle of Stalingrad that 'All traitors will be shot'. Soldiers would run away from the battle, where they would be shot, or they would escape from unguarded box cars, making it necessary to lock the doors on the cars, otherwise, when the train arrived at Stalingrad, it would be empty!

It does show a different front of world war II, which is always an interesting diversion from the typical 'Mericans vs. Nazi or Japanese plot. Also, choosing to focus on a sniper other than a generic soldier was a cool concept. Unfortunately, that's where the positives end.

Actors who are suppose to be Russian or German don't speak their respective language, AND speak in English with British/American accents. Rough transition between scenes and plot points left me wondering ""wait, did I miss something?"". Shallow characters that make me feel indifferent whether they lived or died. A stupid, stupid love triangle that took focus away from the overall plot and served as a cue for over dramatic, generic score.

1275953,4,B00003CXRA,"So after openly admitting that this genre often leaves me cold, I have to take a step back from my stance and admit that `Enemy at the Gates' is kind of great.  It is slow and brooding and yet intense to near perfection, which is exactly what I like to see in my war movies.  I'm often dismayed at the war films that focus solely on the action, thrusting the audience into the pits of chaotic warfare without really grounding us in WHO we are watching, but the great thing about `Enemy at the Gates' is that it completely understands how to layer the characters and build a base for our undivided attention before pushing us out into the battlefield.  And, in all honestly, containing the warfare to a more subtle and quiet setting (the sniping) makes it all the more intimate and internalized, which adds to the intensity as opposed to just bolstering our external excitement.  Bookended with two vastly different yet equally stirring moments of violence and containing fiercely sharp performances by Jude Law and Ed Harris (an actor I'm not often fond of), `Enemy at the Gates' stands out in the crowd as a superior `war film'.  The middle of the film is slightly muddled by a love triangle that is used to establish character development yet serves as more of a distraction than anything else (but then again, we love us some Rachel Weisz, so I'm not really complaining), but at the end of the day I cannot say I wasn't impressed by Jean-Jacques Annaud's achievement here.",1312502400,,1475,4.636015325670498

The love triangle and the over the top portrayal of Nikita Kruschev are probaby the biggest detractions from the story line, but they also provide enough entertainment value as to not pull too much from the main story line.

1276125,5,B00003CXRA,"THE STORY: By 1942 Adolph Hitler's military Juggernaut had steam-rolled east across the Soviet Union until he reached the gates of Stalingrad on the Volga River. It was here that Joseph Stalin deemed that the Nazi encroachment into the Russian homeland would cease.

Many of the battles for possession of Stalingrad are detailed in the film but the central story focuses upon the renowned Soviet snipers, (many of these heroic individuals being women), who saved the day for their Motherland. Before the months of battle eventually concluded, (which ultimately reduced the entire city to one gigantic pile of rubble), the German officers had become so paranoid about assasination that it considerably reduced their ability to wage war. German officers were being slaughtered by the snipers in large numbers every day as the low-echelon foot soldiers became more and more leaderless until all German hope of victory was eventually lost.

Nikita Khrushchev, the Soviet political officer whom Stalin had placed in charge of the Soviet forces, (and the man who later commented on 18 November 1956, ""We will bury you,"" essentially to the United States), particularly spotlighted one highly skilled sniper for the Soviet media, an act which resulted in a huge public relations coup and which generated much-needed hope for the Soviets. The urban guerilla activities of this man, (artfully played by Jude Law), comes down to a one-on-one contest with a renowned German sniper, (brilliantly conveyed by Ed Harris.)

The mounting suspense in this 2001 film tenoned with its astounding realism makes the movie so compelling as to rank as one of the best contemporary films I've ever viewed. Lots of action, a decent romantic sub-plot, flawless casting, and marvelous cinematography all contribute to make this one a movie which you will surely want to watch over and over. One picks up more of the film's clever details with each subsequent viewing.

I wanted to also mention two peripheral items. The first is that you can still go out to numerous local gun shops and actually buy these Soviet sniper rifles, (7.62 x 54 Russian), scope and all, for about $150 bucks apiece and they shoot great -- I own two of them, one with a scope and one without. The ammunition is cheap at under five dollars for twenty rounds. They are incredibly powerful and accurate, about the same as the popular American .30-06 caliber rifle. My second remark is that if you like gritty war films, you might wish to also see this 1989 movie on DVD which is not widely known but terrific nonetheless:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Winter-War-Talvisota/dp/B0000646UN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Winter War (Talvisota)</a>. It's in color, subtitled in English, and features the most realistic war action I've ever seen staged -- it's all about the brief War between Finland and the Soviet Union in 1939.

1276128,4,B00003CXRA,"I very much enjoyed this movie, despite the perhaps inevitable Hollywood hype.  To be certain, the screen play is based on a the Soviet rendition of a supposed sniper duel in besieged Stalingrad.  Yes, there were no doubt hundreds of sniper duels in Stalingrad, but this one wasn't one of them.

According to Soviet propaganda, the Germans send their greatest sniper, Koenig, to remove the deadly Zaitsev from the surface of the earth.  At the moment of truth, the virtually invisible Koenig shoots Zaitsev's spotter when the spotter foolishly points out Koenig's position under a sheet of tin.  Zaitsev, seeing the muzzle flash and/or dust disturbed by the muzzle gases, fires at Koenig and kills him.  Note:  Even the Soviet account mentions no murdered child.

Zaitsev was, in fact, an accomplished sniper.  The problem is that the character, Koenig, who was supposedly the primary instructor of a German sniper school, has never been identified.  In fact, there was no Koenig ['King' in German].  Therefore the story was simply a Soviet propaganda ploy to make the unlikely point, that Soviet snipers, the Soviet military, and the Soviet system, was superior.

Clearly, no reasonable military system would send one of their primary instructors into the death trap of Stalingrad.  There were plenty of entirely competent marksmen there, already.  On the other hand, I read the account of a Russian female sniper who killed a German sniper and recovered his log book of kills.  She claimed that this German had logged over 500 Russian snipers killed.  Who was the better sniper?  The Russian woman who killed the German sniper or the German sniper who was successful over 500 times in counter-sniper combat?

Me?  I'm not so certain.  The Soviets would have certainly promoted their lady sniper as the 'best'.  The German, however, must have previously survived far more than 500 duels with his life as the price.  Not remarkably he finally paid it.",1265760000,,1951,5.03125

1276132,4,B00003CXRA,"If you're in the mood for a really good war flick you can't go wrong with 2001's ""Enemy at the Gates."" Most WWII films take place on the Western Front whereas ""Enemy"" is one of only two films I can think of that address the Eastern front, the other being Sam Peckinpah's underrated ""Cross of Iron"" (1977).

THE PLOT: The entire story takes place during the pivotal Battle of Stalingrad. Russian troops are carted in by the literal trainloads as the Germans attack/bomb the city. Once the dust clears the situation settles into a more personal battle of sharpshooting wills. A lowly young Russian soldier named Vassili (Jude Law) distinguishes himself for his shooting skills and is promoted as a national hero to motivate the Russian cause. After numerous German officers are assassinated Major Knig (Ed Harris), the top German sniper, is assigned to seek out and eliminate Vassili.

I saw this film back when it was first released to video and three things stuck in my mind over the years: (1.) The opening sequence where the Russian troops are boated across the Volga River to join the fight. This sequence is just extremely harrowing, even more so than Saving Private Ryan's opening D-Day invasion. This is definitely one of the most realistic, well-done scenes in war film history. The film's worth viewing for this incredible sequence alone! (2.) The city-in-rubble sets with bodies strewn everywhere had a lasting impression on me as did the scurring-like-rats-through-the-rubble warfare. (3.) Some may find this weird, but I always remembered the discreet love-making scene while the soldiers laid in the rubble trying to sleep. I'm not sure why this left an impression, maybe because it struck me as so real -- men & women would be drawn to one another and mate even in the worst possible scenarios.

I just saw the film a second time recently and, again, the warfare reminded me of human rats scurring through the debris. What's interesting is that I later discovered that the film was based on the book ""War of the Rats"" by David L. Robbins. Guess the movie was supposed to provoke the imagery of rats, huh?

The cast also includes Joseph Fiennes as the political officer who elevates Vassili to hero status via his pamphlets and articles, while Rachel Weisz plays the romantic interest between the two. Ron Perlman is also on hand in a limited role as Vassili's sharpshooting comrade.

As with any film based on historical events there are facts-obsessed critics who decry the lack of authenticity in this or that detail (e.g. ""The zippers on the trousers aren't right -- blasphemy!!"", but ""Enemy"" gets the gist right and, besides, it motivates the viewer to research the actual Battle of Stalingrad, at least this is what it did for me. What more can you ask for? The fact is Vassili played a key role in motivating the Russians to victory in the Battle of Stalingrad, one of the major turning points of World War II; from then on it was all downhill for Germany.

FINAL WORD: ""Enemy at the Gates"" is a truly unforgettable war film about an oft-ignored important aspect of WWII, the Eastern front. It has numerous memorable scenes, especially the opening crossing of the Volga and also a clever sequence involving a large shard of reflective glass. In my humble opinion the film's far better than the contemporaneous ""Saving Private Ryan"" (I'm sure I'll get a handful of 'non-helpful' votes for that sacrilegious' statement).

Doubtful. Rachel Wiesz's character is supposed to be Ukrainian, and not jewish. Apparently though every World War 2 movie about Europe has to hammer home the Holocaust in some way. Guess it's a standard receipe in Hollywood. She was according to history a deadly individual who arrived in Stalingrad with around a Hundred kills already, and not the timid, afraid to shoot my gun character portrayed in the movie. A slight to her I'm sure, not sure what's wrong with a strong proud woman in a movie, defending her country, BUT Hollywood seems to not like the idea.

No the Russians had pleant of guns at Stalingrad. No need to wait for some poor schmuck to buy it so you could have one. Wrong period in history. Not one Russian soldier has a bayonet, despite a Red Army rule against removing them. History? NO! Entertainment, Yes. I liked Ron Pearlman's character. Too bad he dies quick.

1276186,4,B00003CXRA,"Enemy at the Gates, despite being mostly fictitious, is a very entertaining film that accurately depicts much of the fighting in Stalingrad. Though the focus in this film is on the duel between snipers Vassili Zaitsev and Major Koenig, short battle sequences are thrown in periodically to remind us there's a bigger war taking place.

For the most part, the sequences in Enemy at the Gates are believable, if not quite historically accurate. There are a couple of questionable scenes, such as Koenig walking out in the open at the end (a rookie mistake) and his rank (Majors in the Wehrmacht were never snipers), but it is about entertainment, after all.

One of my biggest complaints with this film, however, is that the Russian characters are predominantly portrayed by British actors. Needless to say, the accents are ridiculous. The acting is superb, though, with both Jude Law and Ed Harris delivering excellent performances.

1276187,4,B00003CXRA,"In March 2001, a World War II film adapted from a 1973 nonfiction book ""Enemy at the Gates: The Battle for Stalingrad"" by William Craig was released in theaters.

Featuring a screenplay written and  directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud (""Wings of Courage"", ""L'Amant"", ""Seven Years in Tibet"", etc.) along with co-writer Alain Godard (""Wings of Courage"", ""Der Name Der Rose"", ""Palace"", etc.), the film which had a budget of $68 million, went on to make over $96 million worldwide.

""ENEMY OF THE GATES"" is a fictionalized story about the Russian sniper hero Vassili Zaitsev.  Known for killing hundreds of Axis soldiers using a Mosin-Nagant rifle but also a symbol of success for the Russians in their use of training of snipers.

The film begins with a young Vassili being taught by his grandfather how to shoot a fox that is about to hunt down a horse.  We are then taken to World War II where Vassili (Jude Law) is a Red Army soldier and is traveling in a cattle truck with soldiers and civilians.  He immediately takes notice of a beautiful woman (Rachel Weisz).

The cattle truck is then turned to a military convoy headed to Stalingrad, which is being under attack from the Germans.  We see soldiers trying to cross the Volga getting gunned down and slaughtered as the Germans have airplanes to take down the ships in the sea.

The Russian military issues the warning that if anyone from the Red Army attempts to run or retreat, they will be killed.  The groups are split into two groups.  One that is assigned with a Mosin-Nagant rifle, while the other carries ammunition.  Vassili is given the ammunition.

Because of misinformation of how far the control the Germans have of the city, members of the Red Army end up being slaughtered by their own military for violating the rule.

We then see a car driving through the streets and becomes under fire from the German, eventually knocking the car over.  The driver, Commissar Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) hides amongst the bodies of other Russians.  As the Germans come and make sure all Russians are dead, a few of the Nazi military leaders start to relax while one takes a shower outside of a destroyed building.

Commissar Danilov gets one of the rifles but he is not a real soldier that knows how to fire guns but one of the Russian survivors, Vassili tells him that he will take all five of the Germans out and he does so by using a rifle with one shot each.  Danilov is grateful that Vassili was there to take them down and is amazed of what courage this young man had in taking on the Nazi's literally by himself.

Meanwhile, Nikita Khrushchev (Bob Hoskins) arrives in Stalingrad to coordinate defense strategies.  Because of the constant lead changes between the Russians the Germans, morale is down.  To improve morale, Commissar Danilov offers Khrushchev a suggestion that the Russians need to have a hero.  When asked if he knows of one, Danilov suggests  Vassili.

Commissar Danilov who has the job of boosting morale through media like newspapers and propaganda fliers has took his new friend Vassili and made him the major hero throughout Russia.  Wherever Vassili shows up, the Russian soldiers are inspired to have him around.  Vassili is now transferred to the Russian sniper division.

As the film progresses, Vassili ends up at the home of Mother Filipov (Eva Mattes) who lives with her son Sacha (Gabriel Thomson).  That is where Vassili is reunited with the beautiful woman he saw when he first became a soldier.  The woman is a soldier named Tania Chernova (Rachel Weisz) who learned German.

Vassili is happy to see Tania but so is Commissar Danilov who seems to have fallen for the soldier as well.  He immediately tries to convince her that her knowledge of German can help the Russians intelligence decode German communication.

Meanwhile, Vassili's fame continues to grow as he and the other snipers are killing off German soldiers and officers.  The Germans who are aware of the Russian hero, Vassili decide to bring their top sniper to go after him.  His name is Major Erwin Konig (Ed Harris), an excellent sniper and the head of the German Army Sniper School.

While Vassili and other snipers are out on a mission, Major Konig takes out two of the snipers that accompanied Vassili.  Immediately, Vassili knows that Kong's precision and his way of hunting is excellent and feels that he may not be up to the job to take him on.

Danilov knowing that his friend is feeling a bit down about the situation, brings in Koulikov (Ron Perlman), a sniper who trained under Konig before the war.  Koulikov then trains Vassili on the ways Major Konig thinks and behaves.

Thus begins the cat-and-mouse game between Vassili and Major Konig and who has the skills and experience to take each other out.  Meanwhile, the relationship intensifies for Tania and Vassili but what will happen when Commissar Danilov who also has fallen for Tania finds out his friend Vassili (who knows that Danilov is smitten with her) is also going for her behind his back?

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""ENEMY AT THE GATES"" receives its 1080p High Definition transfer (2:35:1 aspect ratio) which looks absolutely wonderful when watching the war unfold.  Just watching the war in the first half hour as chaos erupts during a cold, cloudy day with this bluish tinge showing bleakness was well captured by Director of Photography (Robert Fraisse).

With that being said, the majority of the shots during days of overcast and conditions were not colorful and vibrant.  Indoor scenes showcase a yellowness as natural lighting and places where there are no electricity shows the amber effects with blacks all around the characters.

""ENEMY AT THE GATES"" is not a film to expect color vibrancy, its a film depicting war with many lives lost, times when the Russian forces feel they don't know themselves if they will live another day.  I didn't notice any compression artifacts and even in times of darkness, I think I saw may a little speckle but overall, the transfer to HD was well done.

As for audio, the 5.1 Dolby TrueHD transfer (also featured are French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital tracks) was great but not excellent.  There is very good use of direction of sound from the ongoing bombings throughout the city which utilizes the low frequency of the subwoofer, then during scenes where there are many Russians around, you can hear those people talk in the fronts while dialogue is coming straight from the center speaker.  Sniper shots and rifle shots are also done well as you can hear the bullets zipping and hitting its target on impact.  But if there was one weakness that I found, I did not notice any usage of the rear surrounds.

This was surprising because you hear the front channel and subwoofer being utilized but I was putting my ear right next to my rear surrounds during several scenes and I didn't hear anything.  Made sure to switch to another film to make sure that things were working correctly and surround utilization was fine, switched back to ""ENEMY AT THE GATES"" and no rear surround usage.  Overall, audio use was very good but it would have been even better if the rears were utilized effectively.

Subtitles are featured in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""ENEMY AT THE GATES"" features several informative special features which include:

JUDGMENT CALL:

""ENEMY AT THE GATES"" is a very impressive war film.  Around the time this film came out, I was impressed by the amount of extras utilized for the film but to see body parts and blood spatters (in one scene it gets on the camera).  This was filmed wonderfully!

I was also impressed with the performances with all four major talents.  Jude Law did a great job as Vassili, and on one side we know he is the great sniper of Russia but when not on the battlefield, he was a man in love.  Ed Harris who plays the antagonist is just a wonderful actor and did a great job playing Major Konig.  And the performances by Rachel Weisz and Joseph Fiennes are absolutely fabulous.

If you take the film on its own as a fictionalized story, then you can probably enjoy the screenplay as it shows the bleakness of war but how, during war, love is found and how love was lost.  It's a powerful film...  But its a powerful film that can be marred by the fact that certain scenes are embellished for the sake of the story.  This is not a factual story.

There were protests in Russia of how Russian soldiers and officers were being depicted.  For example, soldiers who were forced by their officers to attack Nazi machine guns in a suicide attempt and if they retreated, the officers shot and killed their own.  For Russians who honor their war heroes and those who lost their lives at ""The Battle of Stalingrad"", they have every right to have been upset with how the soldiers were depicted.

But this is a fictional film inspired from three pages of the original book by William Craig.  It's indeed a powerful film with strong images of war and a film featuring wonderful performances from the talent.  The Blu-ray HD transfer is well-done and fans of the film may want to double dip if they have own the original DVD release solely for picture quality and lossless audio.

I enjoyed ""ENEMY AT THE GATES"" and I definitely recommend it on Blu-ray!",1242691200,9,10961,4.758876523582406

1276191,4,B00003CXRA,"I rate this movie overall as a four star (out of five).  I will divide it in terms of:

Historical Accuracy:  Yes Vasily Zaitzev fought in Stalingrad and earned the tittle of Hero of the Soviet Union.  Its true he was extensively used in propaganda efforts by the Red Army in trying to keep the moral of its troops high while still being on the loosing side of the war.  The careless disregard for human lifes and the lack of war materiel was true on part of the Red Army, the use of terror and the fratricidal killing by the political troops of the NKVD and the political commissars was also true.  The importance attached to Zaitzev by the German High Command was grossly overated, the sharpshooters as a whole were seen as a grave danger but bringing a full Prussian Colonel to deal with just a Russian soldier will not be in line with the usual behavior of the Wehrmacht.  The film gives too much importance to Nikita Khruschev and any credit at all to General Chuikov, who kept the defenses of Stalingrad going against all odds.  Although the premise of the story is basically true some details are way off so I will give 3 stars in terms of accuracy.

Entertainment.-  Very entertaining, very good scenes specially the crossing of the Volga while being attacked by Stukas and the Red Square battle.  Sniping is mostly a game of stealth and patiente and certainly is not a matter of great spectacle but the movie kept this very light and did not make it boring.  In this category the movie certainly rates a high 4 stars.

The Romance.- I didn't see the point of Rachel Weisz's character, too untrue, too volatile.  Very convenient that she was listening to the radio when news of the assasination of her parents by a german death squad came, this is the sole premise for her getting in harms way to try to acheive vengeance by becoming a sniper and landing in the process in the arms of Jude Law (sorry Zaitzev).  The romantic triangle was also unnecesary and Danillof (Joseph Fiennes) should have been played as a manipulating Commissar rather than a basically good man lead astray by jealousy.  As I undestand one of the requisites to be a Political Commisar was devoting your actions to the cause while leaving personal feelings or symphaties out of the way.  Since the romance and the amorous triangle was hokey and unnecessary I will give this part a One-star.

The Scope.- Stalingrad was basically the bloodiest and greatest battle fought until that moment, one can even argue it is the biggest battle ever fought, I believe the scope of the movie was not appropriate to showcase the battle, in fact you never learn something about the battle in itself, why the Russians in the end win, the treatment of the battle is mostly referential and tangential.  the snipers were one of the causes for the german defeat but not the main reason.  The encircling operation of Stalingrad is much more important as the city was left isolated when the Rumanian, Italian and Hungarian armies that were left in the left and right flank of the city defenses collapsed against the Soviet attack allowing the German Sixth Army to be encircled and the starved it to submission in the bleakest part of the winter 42-43.  There is never a reference to this, about the starvation of the german army, and we don't have a feeling for the battle with its artillery duels and the house to house fighting.  In this respect the movie does not pay justice to the subject and I will leave this as three stars.

The sets.-  very well done, the sets look real, I have seen pictures of red square and the red October factory and the sets used are very accurate.  The Volga I believe is a much more impressive river than what is shown to us (I believe the movie was shot in Germany and maybe the river portrayed is the Rhine.  The ambientation, the uniforms, the equipment shown is very realistic (mark III panzer tanks, spandau machine guns, SKDf half tracks, etc.) in this respect I will give the production a five star.

The Music.-  repetitive, needs more grandeur to accomodate the subject, I was not impressed by the soundtrack.  Why not use Soviet and German patriotic music that has the grandeur and probably give the movie more realism.  Three star.

Overall a good movie, not the best on the subject and the Stalingrad Battle still has not been portrayed as justly deserved",1239580800,,4360,4.608808290155441

Instead of just shooting and blood and gore you have two guys in love with the same woman amidst the fighting and brutality of war. You have action, suspense and romance in a true to life package. The Russian sniper becomes so notorious that the Germans send a sniper after him. You see both sides of the conflict which doesn't always happen in war movies.

Many are unarmed and ordered to pick up the rifles of the men who are killed ahead of them. When these men retreat, the Soviet Socialists kill them with their own machine guns. In this brutal war, the Russian sniper became a legend in this fiery maelstrom.

1276268,3,B00003CXRA,"This is based on a true story from the Battle of Stalingrad. It tells how a sniper became a hero for publicity and morale. The first scene shows men crossing the river in the daytime! [Night crossings would prevent air attacks.] Wasn't there a Soviet Air Force to defend against those Stuka fighters? Were those soldiers only given one clip of ammunition? Next there is a charge against entrenched troops. Didn't they learn anything since WW I? [Or is this just symbolism and propaganda?] Vassily Zaitsev the shepherd knows how to shoot a rifle. Nikita Khrushchev is now in charge and asks for suggestions. Why not improve morale? The sniper's exploits are advertised for building morale. Women were used for sniper duty, successfully.

Vassily gets an experienced older sniper who studied in the German sniper school. The Germans use a captured soldier as lure to reveal a sniper's location. A young boy provides a story for a bar of chocolate. Major Koenig lays a clever trap, it almost works. Is that boy a double agent? Tanya and Vassily are nice to each other. There will be a new attack and Vassily is prepared for Koenig. Koenig is very clever to understand that boy, and lays a trap. Will wolf hunter Vassily become the hunted? Will personal emotion create an unneeded conflict? The film continues to the final showdown between Vassily and Koenig. Is it believable, or just a dramatic ending? Will Vassily meet Tanya for a happy ending?

The encircled German 6th Army surrendered at Stalingrad in February 1943. It was the end of the beginning. The Battle of Kursk in July 1943 marked the beginning of the end for Nazi Germany.

1276269,3,B00003CXRA,"The opening scenes capture the realities of war almost as effectively as was done in ""Saving Private Ryan.""  This movie does something that so many other WWII movies does so stupidly, though: It tries to drive a romance into the middle of a survival of the fittest mortal combat film.  I don't mind such a thing in a work of fiction, but this movie is about the Battle of Stalingrad, which is probably the most important battle of WWII.

Actually, the film is about a legend that grew in Soviet Russia during WWII, and this story puts it into that great battle.  The opening scenes are pure adrenaline pumping combat that is stark and terrible.  As the film settles down, though, we begin to focus in on a highly politicized duel between a pair of snipers.  One is a peasant from Russia.  The other is a professional from Nazi Germany.  They hunt for one another through the broken city of Stalingrad, each attempting to find their advantage against the other.

To be sure, the sniper scenes are a bit far fetched, the love story is strange, the political drama overdone.  The mass combat is spectacular.  Watch this film for a look at that for yourself.  The climax is ridiculous, especially for a sniper war.  I suggest that you watch this film once just to get an idea of the nature of combat between the professional German army and the conscripted peasant army of the Soviet Union.  It will give you a small look at the struggle that cost 20 million Soviets' lives.",1200268800,,1470,4.561068702290076

I wasn't sure I would enjoy a war movie, but found this story of the 2 snipers, with the backdrop of the Second WW in Stalingrad compelling.  Jean-Jacques Annoud co-wrote, produced and directed this film released in 2001.  Not your usual war movie, but focused on the main characters: Ed Harris as Major Konig the German officer brought to kill Zaitsev and their struggles to survive successful in eliminating the other; and it follows the relationship of political officer Danilov (Joseph Feinnes) and Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law) through many ups and downs of support, neglect, political wrangling, and later jealousy over the love interest played by Rachael Weisz.  In the end Danilov sees the truth of the situation and how he used Zaitsev to serve his own purposes and questions the meaning of war.

1276335,4,B00003CXRA,"I enjoyed this movie, and give it 4 stars for its scenery, props and acting.
However, you'll have to already know (i.e., have studied) the Eastern Front war in general and the Stalingrad battle in particular to understand the overall war picture. By that I mean in the movie the Soviets seem to go from almost certain defeat to victory without explanation. (The real explanation, by the way, was largely twofold - the Germans grossly over extended their supply lines, and the Russians very smartly fed just enough troops into Stalingrad to keep the Germans fixated on ""winning"" there until the Russians could organize their encircling counter-attack. None of this comes out in the movie).

The setting, scenes, uniforms & weapons, were accurately protrayed to a very good level of detail. Too bad the plot wasn't treated the same. It starts off as a broad heroic story, which then narrows to a conflict between Zaitsev and Koenig, with a love triangle of Zaitsev-Tanya-Danilov thrown in. Plot development is the film's weakest point in my opinion.

There are some inaccuracies, such as the locking of the Russian cattle-car troop trains - that was NOT the Soviet's practice! They left them open in case of air attack. Things like that scene are most likely the result of American (or more generally, western) inclinations to view the Communists as indifferent to life or as some sort of slave-labor-based society. Mismanagement aside, the Russians suffered terribly from the war.

Its a good movie - but don't take it as history. Zaitsev was a real person though and a real hero, as was Tanya. Major Koenig is now believed to be a propaganda invention.
For the real story of Stalingrad, I'd suggest reading the book ""Enemy at the Gates"" by William Craig - a very easy read.",1188777600,2,1773,4.864238410596027
1276336,3,B00003CXRA,"Set during the fall of Stalingrad in World War two, ""Enemy at the Gates"" focuses on Vassili Zaitsev, a poor soldier who has a gift for sharp shooting. That gift comes to the attention of Commisar Danilov, who sees Zaitsev as a political propaganda coup for an ailing Russian military. The Germans call in a sniper of their own, a Major Konig, to deal with this sniper who is growing in fame.

The tension is thick in this movie, as the two snipers stalk each other. However, around them is the maelstrom of the Battle of Stalingrad. The stark realities of the Russian army are very realistic, with soldiers sharing a single weapon, living in horrid conditions, and suffering badly.

The attempts of the political officers to exploit Zaitsev for their own goals are also highlighted. Their sometimes cynical use of people to advance the glory of the Motherland is sometimes horrible to contemplate and view.

The movie is earthy and real, and the acting is excellent. Jude Law is great in the lead roll. I was very impressed with the cast of the movie.

1276338,4,B00003CXRA,"[...]I watched the movie on TV recently  without  knowing beforehand whether the actual  figures and plot were real or fictional.

The three central characters, two of whom at least were apparently real,  make up the eternal  triangle. The Russian sniper is  the  hero ( he was taught  to shoot very accurately by his wolf-hunting grandfather: ""put snow in your mouth so  the  wolf won't see your breath). He is made a hero by  his  would-be  rival,  the lovelorn Jewish Communist Party Commissar in charge of battle site  propaganda. They are both in love with the lovely  Jewish Soviet  infantry heroine  who plans to  go and farm in Palestine if she survives the war.

The  filmmakers, bending the truth, have made the sharp shooting activities of the particular hero  a critical part of the whole Battle of Stalingrad. If the hero  gets killed  it will be  a national tragedy, if not a disaster, For the Germans, if their  sharpshooter is killed, who is shipped in from Berlin  in a Pullman train  specifically to  wipe out the hero, it will be a humiliation. so much so the Nazi  Major  is told by General Paulus to remove his dog tags in case he falls. If you believe the film plot the duelling was apparently set  up on purpose as part of the  commissar's propaganda (I don't know if Danilov the  commissar is real or fictional). Such a duel did take place but was probably not central to the  Battle of Stalingrad (which was won  in 1943 when  the Russians surrounded the Germans  who found themselves enclosed in the city and forced the whole army to surrender including the General). The victory is celebrated  near the  end of the film but  it does not explain how the  it came about, though no doubt the dogged resistance inside the city  was  very important.

The war  action -particularly in the first  half hour of the movie -  is very graphic and  exciting and more  realistic  than most war films. The romantic  line , apparently real, between hero and heroine adds tone to what would otherwise be just  another  bang-bang movie for 100 minutes. I believe there is even a computer  game based on the film that concentrates on the shooting gallery aspect. The film makers do successfully, if not entirely completely,  put the Battle of Stalingrad in its perspective as arguably the  turning in  point in  the European  theatre  of World War II, that drained  Hitler's forces. But they do not explain that without the Russian victory at Stalingrad in 1943  the allied  invasion of Normandy would have been  impossible in 1944 and World War II would have been prolonged (assuming that America would have  hesitated to us the atomic bomb  it developed in 1945 against  Europeans).

The action part of the movie is mainly focused on the Russian sharpshooter's duel  with the elegant  German sniper  sent  to  cut him down.  Action narrows from the opening  mass battle scenes to a handful of Russian  sharp shooters, who fall one by one to the cunning  German ace and ends up with a one-on-one  Western type gun duel. The sense of war is hell pervades the atmosphere of a ruined city in which fighting is from building to building. The Germans appear to have  an air advantage and an ability to drop bombs with devastating  impact but their tanks, confined by narrow alleys amid the ruins are not much help. I recently saw actual footage of the Battle in a German documentary  on TV and the  fountain  featured early in the film also appears as it really was though not  piled high with  dead bodies. Not being a World War II  expert I  cannot quibble with the  many  minor historical  mistakes that have been identified by purists but  even if I were aware of them when I viewed the film it wouldn't have made  much difference to my enjoyment. The cast all round is superb, especially the principal  characters. My only  complaint is the Hollywood type  ending. The temporarily separated  lovers meet in  hospital before the final fade out  In real life they both assumed  each other were dead and  didn't find  the truth for many year afterwards. That  would  have been  , in my opinion,  a better ending than the fictional one contrived  for no good reason by the filmmakers. Isn't it enough that both survived? Surely the assumption that American box offices need happy  endings (if that was the reason for a dumb they lived happily ever after ending) is  outdated?",1174694400,4,4381,4.658278145695364
1276339,4,B00003CXRA,"For what it's worth, this film deserves more credit than it is frequently given.  I think that most criticisms of the film stem from the reviewers entering the film with certain preconceived notions about how what the film was going to be, only to be let down.  I don't blame the reviewers entirely.  ENEMY AT THE GATES is a little unsure of what it wants to become.  Should we make a film that accurately captures the battle of Stalingrad?  Should we, instead, focus on the wonderful story of these two rival snipers?  Or should we try and communicate an even more personal story about love and the evils of war?  Unfortunately, ENEMY AT THE GATES tries to accomplish all three and, if judged by any single standard, ultimately fails.

Let me take them in turn.  ENEMY AT THE GATES begins in a manner quite reminiscent of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.  After a quick character development scene in which we see our young protagonist being taught how to stalk and snipe a wolf, we suddenly see him thrust amongst the Red Army, railed off to the shores of the Volga River, and thrown into the midst of a German siege.  The opening is spectacular and moving.  Thousands of Russian soldiers are being ferried across the Volga while German dive bombers and artillery decimate their numbers.  As if that isn't bad enough, those wise enough to try and flee the fight are mercilessly gunned down by their own Russian commanders.  While some have criticized this movie for historical accuracy, such things did occur.  And just in case you think I'm trying to demonize the Russian commanders, ENEMY AT THE GATES provides these men with plenty of motivation.  They are the ones who must answer to the high command, who demand victory at all costs.  What would we do?  Of course, this film is not perfectly historically accurate.  From this point on, we do not get much story about the battle for Stalingrad.  The ending of the film leaves the outcome of this battle completely mysterious.  If you came looking for a movie purely about the battle and the Russian front, you came to the wrong place.  While I think that the action scenes are skillfully handled, this is obviously not where the film's interest lies.

What is the interest?  It is about the incredible struggle, based on true events, that occurred during the battle.  For while both armies attack each other brutally, two men endlessly hunt each other, putting each other's skill to the ultimate test.  Our protagonist, Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law), plays a Russian peasant who was taught by his grandfather how to shoot.  An expert marksmen and natural talent, Zaitsev stalks the German army, proving his skill time and time again.  Thanks to his friend Commisar Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), a political officer in charge of the military press, Zaitsev soon becomes an iconic hero of the Russian army--a symbol of communist dominance over fascist Germany.  Germany begins to take notice and sends out their best sniper to hunt the young Russian down.  Killing him would deal a symbolic death blow to Russia.  Germany's marksmen is Major K&ouml;nig (Ed Harris), an aristocratic deer hunter and the instructor at the sniper school in Berlin.  As soon as K&ouml;nig enters the picture, ENEMY AT THE GATES takes a dramatic turn.  Suddenly, the film is about the rivalry of these two men.  For me, this is the most interesting storyline in the film.  Both Ed Harris and Jude Law have an intensity about them, often communicated only by turning the camera on their eyes, that is perfect for the silent nature of the sniping scenes.  I could have watched a whole movie dedicated to only these two marksmen.  The sniping scenes are expertly handled, the background sets of war-torn Stalingrad are amazingly detailed and completely set the tone, and the tension and suspense of these scenes is high.

But, alas, ENEMY AT THE GATES does not simply decide to abandon an accurate portrayal of the battle for Stalingrad for a more focused piece on these two snipers.  Instead, an infamous ""love triangle"" is introduced to the film to stir things up.  I say ""infamous"" only because it seems to have ruined everyone's day if you read the reviews on this site.  While I would agree that this ""love triangle"" is not the most interesting part of the film, I do think that it has some merit.  For one thing, it provides Zeitsev with motivation towards the end of the film.  In the beginning, he seems to have nothing to lose, fully aware that each day may be his last.  He is fearless in his struggle against the Germans.  But as he begins to fall in love with Tania Chernova (Rachel Weisz), suddenly he has something to lose.  Furthermore, his love provides him ultimately with the confidence and determination to put an end to K&ouml;nig, who has been seemingly invincible up until that point.

The really interesting question, I think, is why not just have a love interest?  Why involve a love triangle with Commisar Danilov?  Here, I think that the film shines, at least in conception if not in execution.  The love triangle provides Commisar Danilov with his ever-increasing menace towards Zaitsev.  It makes him abuse his power and become the kind of evil man he once feared.  This, in turn, only heightens our love of the protagonist, as his natural goodness is depicted side-by-side with the evil of his friend.  One thing that kept occurring to me as I watched this film was the question: Who is the bad guy?  Is it the Germans?  Is it Major K&ouml;nig?  Is it Danilov when he becomes enraged at his unrequited love for Tania?  Is it Kruschev?  Is it the Russian generals who shoot their own troops?  It's hard to say!  All that we know is that Vassili is good.  Perhaps the filmmakers didn't want to glorify the Russians?  The truth is that no one ends up very good in this film, besides our two lovers.  War seems to bring out the worst in everyone, even Danilov.  Perhaps that is what ENEMY AT THE GATES is trying to strive for with its inclusion of the love triangle.  War is evil.  And humans are only pawns in the game.

Ultimately, I enjoyed ENEMY AT THE GATES.  In fact, I enjoyed it more the second time I watched it.  You cannot really knock it for not being an accurate portrayal of the battle of Stalingrad.  It is focused on two men in the middle of that battle.  Every film must explore life's events through the eyes of a few characters.  That's where the interest lies!  Anything else would just be a third-person perspective on explosions and gunfire.  While I wish the film could have focused even more on the sniping angle than it does, I believe it to be a respectable war film and one that is quite interesting.",1173830400,5,6662,4.680172413793104
1276340,3,B00003CXRA,"""Enemy at the Gates"" is a middling entry in the canon of World War II films. The battle sequences are fantastic, and the visual effects are awesome. However, the storytelling elements are weak. What was an interesting story from World War II is muddled up with an unneeded love triangle arc, and the scenes meant to be menacing turn out being rather dull. If that wasn't bad enough, none of the actors use accents that were true to the characters. All of the Russian characters have British accents, and Ed Harris' German sports an American accent. This has the affect of distancing the viewer from the story. James Horner's original score sounds too much like John Williams' music from ""Schindler's List,"" which also ruins the momentum of the film.

The acting is alright. Jude Law has never impressed me as an actor, and his performance as Vassili shows he has little talent. Joseph Fiennes is a good actor, but is rather bland as Vassili's friend. Bob Hoskins is a fine actor, but is unimpressive and not menacing enough to pull off the role of Nikita Kruschev. Ed Harris also lacks the menace to pull off the character of Major Konig. The two standout performances in the film are Rachel Weiz as Tania, and Ron Perlman (""Hellboy"") in a brief role as a Russian soldier.

Overall, ""Enemy at the Gates"" is a rather bland World War II epic. While the action is good, the story and acting is weak. I recommend seeing it once, and that's it.

""Well, I thought the acting was pretty darn good"" (4.5).

""Good killing scenes"" (4.0).

""I thought it was pretty realistic about war... dirty, grimy, and people die"" (4.5).

""I thought the sniper scenes were very well done... you have to know your enemy, see your enemy"" (4.0).

However:

""It had the ""Saving Private Ryan"" flavor, mixed with a love story, a story about friendship, and a clear example of the cruelty of war"" (3.0).

""It was okay, I guess"" (3.0).

Our conclusion?  Entertaining and gritty.  Not the best of war-themed movies, but John Wayne wasn't swaggering around either.  The viewer won't have the best understanding of which aspects of this story were true and which were all Hollywood.  The Russians were noble and the Germans were beasts.  Remember the line about histories being written by the victors?  There you go!

We appreciated the reality of war being presented as ""... dirty, grimy, and people die.""  Certainly, in any war, there are stories of luck, of hope, and of love.  We also know that the dirty, grimy, and people dying part predominates.  The film is true in that regard.

Fully accurate or not, how refreshing to have a war hero without an ego. Was the intention to give a full history lesson or to focus on the intriguing game of cat and mouse of the opposing sharpshooters Vassily Zaitzev(Jude Law)and the German Major Konig (Ed Harris)with the battle for Stalingrad as the backdrop.

1276375,5,B00003CXRA,"A central statue display of Children dancing around a Maypole with a Crocodile leering at them while buildings burn after the bombing of a railroad yard in Stalingrad. That was the picture on the original cover of the famous book produced by William Craig that this film used as a resource. It makes an impression immediately as to what nightmares this battle was all about and the film does deliver that impression just as well. I was haunted by the stories in Mr. Craig's book when I first became acquainted with the work in 1980. You can feel the atmosphere in this film. It is very Stalinist in the deep browns, blacks and fiery red of war. As Al Stewart said in his famous song ""Roads to Moscow"": ""and the pale sun of October whispers the Snow will soon be coming..and I wonder when I'll be home again and the morning answers 'never' and the evening sighs and the steely russian skies go on ...forever"". So you can imagine how I felt as I sat in the audience for the first showing of this movie. When it was over, the audience sat there...in stunned silence at what had been shown and no one left the theatre as the credits rolled to the end. It was as if everyone could not quite take in all that was given in this movie. It did not fail in trying to tell the personal tales that Craig spoke about, but it tended to center on a few individuals (real people, in most cases, but somewhat romanticized) yet, it does convey a certain sense of the misery of fighting in the city. The director made a few changes in the fates of individuals, added a political officer in the mix to good effect and generally did a good job. A few scenes from the original have been CUT. One in the meeting with Nikita K of political officers where one wets his pants and another when Ed Harris (as Maj. Konig, an Oscar worthy performance!) is sitting in the train and the camera focuses on terribly wounded Germans in another train, stacked like cattle ready to head in the opposite direction, staring at him in a luxurious train car alone is a bit longer before he pulls the curtain down so that he don't have to look at them. The film decends into a personal duel between Harris and Jude Law playing the hero Vassily Zaitzev, two snipers of note. The film misses on other heroes like General Vassili Chuikov or Colonel Ivan Lyudnikov, a division commander who defended the Barrikady factory against the German Pioneer unit. 15 year old Sacha Fillipov was indeed hanged for espionage, but this too was romanticized for effect. I have nothing against it. It is still an effective picture. Not perfect for a History scholar but the film produces the intended result. The truth is that most Americans were unaware of the Russian fight at Stalingrad, only Harrison Salisbury, a reporter for the NY Times, wrote and reported during the war about Soviet fighting that later made for effective books that he wrote as an afterthought. It is still good and makes for an entertaining semi-historical lesson.",1158969600,5,2981,4.5427509293680295
1276376,4,B00003CXRA,"As you may have read, this movie covers events from the Battle of Stalingrad 1942, which was the turning point of the war against Nazi Germany.  This was a brutal battle during a harsh winter and the casualties were horrific.  Brutalities occurred from both sides fighting the battle, the Nazi's, which are well known, and the Soviets, the brutalities of which are alarmingly little known.  Considering the library shelves full of the atrocities committed by the Soviets, there remains a dichotomy on the coverage committed by both of these totalitarian regimes.  An acknowledgment of the nature of the Soviet Union will be when there's an equivalent Schindler's List Hollywood movie, heaped with loads of awards, and broadcast on network TV without commercial interruption.  That day may be a long time off, or may never occur, so there only exist whatever rare movies occur on it.  There are a few telling statements here and there, Bob Hoskins as Krushchev, the Communist political leader in the battle, asks another soldier what he thinks can be done to motivate the Soviet soldiers, and he replies threaten their families, to which Krushchev lets out a ""pfthh, of course we already tried that!"".  This is a realistic comment on the mentality of the Russians who killed thousands of their own troops in disciplinary actions.  There's a comment on the `political correctness' of the movie.  It's the other way around, politically correct would be to say how great the Russians were in WWII.  The fact that this Hollywood movie has been released and is un-politically correct is what's surprising, and is why you should view such a rarity.

There is a duel between two snipers in the movie, one German, one Russian.  It's should have been more of a back story as opposed to being the plot.  There's also a love interest.  Apparently aspects of these events did occur, but you should consider this a fictional movie of course, although the historical background certainly isn't.  It's not a great movie, because of the sniper and love interest are so-so done, but it's a good movie, and one of the few large screen Hollywood cinematic releases on the subject, is relatively short at a bit over two hours considering the subject matter, and is essential viewing for anyone interested in Stalingrad and the nature of the Soviet Union.

""Oy you, I shoot for the ruddy Soviets too!  Get them Jerries, I will!""

The actual Soviet Stalingrad veterans were so offended by inaccuracies in the movie and the insulting way in which the movie portrays the Soviet army, that they asked the Russian Parliament to ban the film in Russia.

The acting is downright lousy as are the stupid and highly unnecessary British accents.  The stupid British kid posing as a Russian spy, the stupid British guy posing as a Soviet sniper...  Even Bob Hoskins (American) throws in the fake UK accent (So irritating!)  But the ultimate laugh was when Ed Harris is mixing English and German together in his sentences.  Just annoying altogether.  They should have done this film in Soviet-era Russian and Third Reich German, as executed so well in ""Downfall.""

""Enemy At The Gates"" bombed at theaters for a reason, and it is in the Amazon bargain bin for a reason:  It's a stupid film.

Skip this one, and get ""Downfall"" instead.  You will not be dissappointed with that film, I assure you.",1150502400,11,1077,4.725806451612903
1276430,4,B00003CXRA,"Taken as a historical drama rather than an attempt to flawlessly depict a historical incident, this is topnotch entertainment.  ""Enemy At The Gates"" portrays the conflict between a young Russian sniper played by Law and the German sniper (Harris) who is sent to kill him during the German attack on Stalingrad during WWII. Apart from a scene which awkwardly caricatures the Russian field commanders and the occasionally distracting accents, the film successfully immerses the viewer in this tense war drama.

The romance between Zaitsev and Tania is kind of unnecessary, and I am not sure if the sex scene is obligatory or advances their relationship. This love side story lacks passion; a lot of it feels mechanical and routine. ""Enemy At The Gates"" is still a consistently intriguing war film-rare because it does not involve Americans. While we are never really concerned about the outcome of the actual war, nor do we entirely care about several aspects of the main characters, there are many good scenes of suspense, and the overall mood of the movie is effective. ""Enemy at the Gates"" is worth seeing if it sounds interesting to you.",1149379200,4,1139,4.989473684210527
1276431,4,B00003CXRA,"For those of you who want a shoot-em-up war movie... this is right up your alley (as it is mine!).  But historically, it's incredibly inaccurate.

Put your feet on the coffee table, crack a beer, open a bag of potato chips, and lose yourself in a really good war movie.  Beautiful set design for a blasted out Stalingrad, great costuming, and wonderful makeup.  I wonder how long it took them to get clean after their filming in all the dirt and debris

However, this movie is about as historically accurate as John Wayne's ""Flying Tigers""

I would HIGHLY recommend reading the books, ""Enemy At The Gates"" by William Craig, and ""War of the Rats"" by David Robbins.  These are the REAL stories of the battle of Stalingrad.  The incredible suffering of both Soviet and German armies, and what it meant to be a Soviet conscript in the Red Army and thrown into the ""Kessel"" which was Stalingrad.  (AKA ""Der hexen kessel"" The witches' cauldron).  Both Soviet resolve and the famous Russian winter ganged up on the German and some Italian forces to create a truly exquisite hell on earth, and the nearly totally destroyed city of Stalingrad itself gave wonderful and equal cover to both forces.  There is no more savage warfare than urban fighting.

The movie is the story of the dual between the Soviet and German snipers and does indeed make for a great flick.  But the true story is quite different.  In the book, ""Enemy At The Gates"", the dual took up a whole two or three pages... it was a mere trifle in the total battle.

Jude Law's character, Vassili Zaitsev, was probably not a ""superb"" marksman since most urban sniping is at 100 yards or less (usually a lot less).  The Moisen-Nagant is a good rifle, but it was still a field-grade, as-issued rifle.  What Zaitsev was REALLY good at, where he really shined, was in hiding and concealment.  Tania Chernova was blond and, in addition to being a very successful sniper in her own right, did some explosives work.

The real person (named in the movie) Sacha Fillipov was indeed hanged, but not by the German sniper.  He was rounded up by a German army squad and hanged, not from a water tower, but from a tree along with three or four other Russian youths.  He was not a little kid as in the movie, but was fifteen or sixteen.

Another little tidbit... the German major was not killed standing up in a train yard, but while he was in his cover under steel plates.  Snipers DO NOT break cover... ever... and offer themselves up as fodder by walking out into the open.  While there may be other snipers (counter-snipers) operating in the area, it's just plain suicide.  (Trust me on this... I know of which I speak).

The whole movie is riddled with little details that are not factual.  It either portrays incidences which did not happen, omits incidences which did, or portrays actual incidences incorrectly... very incorrectly.

Bottom line.... Forget all about the history books, and just relax and enjoy the movie... It's a good one!!!  (That is, if you can overlook Russians speaking with British accents).  To tell the truth, I'm watching it again as I'm writing this.

And, thank God, at least it's not a movie loaded with obscenities!  I was in the military and I know what it's really like, but this is one inaccuracy I approve of.

And Rachel Weisz should ABSOLUTELY get an Oscar for her performance in the only sex scene in the movie.  If she doesn't light your fire in this sequence, you have a real problem!!

1276432,5,B00003CXRA,"Let me start off by saying that I'm not a war movie buff, like the other reviewers here seem to be.  I never really watched all of ""Platoon"" and I still feel that the first fifteen intense, minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan"" is what actually saves it from being completely boring and just plain middling for the rest of it.  But, getting back to ""Enemy at the Gates"", I really don't like war movies and American war films in particular, are almost always one-sided.  This movie however, covers a portion of the war that is almost never told, the Russian front and particularly the battle for Stalingrad.  This movie deserves major props for tackling a part of the war that Hollywood refused to acknowledge (instead creating yet another anti-war film or worse yet, an imitation John Wayne piece of [...] like ""We Were Soldiers"") and script writers avoided at all costs in an effort to create another ""Full Metal Jacket"" for American consumption.  This movie's realism isn't about what war really looks like, in the way ""Private Ryan"" was (although, I think you'd be hard pressed to say that the beginning of ""Enemy"" is any less powerful or chaotic than ""Private Ryan's"" was)this movie actually focuse's on story, not war and on people and the choices they make during one.  This movie is just that...a movie... so, if you're expecting complete, historical, accuracy from this film, than you're probably better off watched yet another, dreary, documentary on the A&E channel!  ""Enemy"" is great because you're dealing with the creation of and separating the differences between idols and heroes based on their faith, beliefs and their values.  This movie also paralells boxing, with Vasilli, as a young almost-protege', with natural skill on his way up and Major Konig is like an aged champion who knows he must face the young contender at some point.  In the process, Vasilli sees the champion/Konig in action first hand and is awed by his already incredible skill, making him become a little kid again, unsure if he can even beat him now.  To top off that comparison, Bob Hoskins as Krushchev, is incredible and (probably not far off from what the real man was like in real-life)he should have gotten an Oscar for his role as Krushchev (let's face it, he was better in this than ""Roger Rabbit""!).  He in fact, plays the role almost like that of a Don King-like fight promoter, who's interest in Vasilli is to promote a ""fight of the century"" between the ""Russian"" and ""the German"" as propaganda for the Russian side.  There is a part where Konig, begins to take an almost fatherly interest in Vasilli (and you get the sense that they both admire one another like a protege') asking ""why he didn't learn to shoot from his father"" and we also learn about Konig's son's death, I would have liked to have seen this storyline followed more and expounded upon.  One even wonders if they're would have been a father/son or a teacher/student relationship between them had there been no war.  As for the love interest,... completely believeable!  I don't know of any man or woman, who hasn't been in love with someone...who was in love with someone else. Where, no matter what you do (logic, reason, change of clothes, etc.) nothing can change the fact that that person just doesn't feel that way about you. If you can't understand that, than you're just missing something and I don't mean just about this movie! But seriously, you feel for everyone in this film and I think that's what really makes this film work so well.  Except Sasha, I was actually very happy when the Major finally killed him off.  First, I don't like any little boy with a girls name (except Sue of course) and this kid just tried too hard to look and be adorable! I thought he was a real piece of sh@# to begin with and he would just grow up and become an adult like that.  So when he did meet his untimely end, I actually had a nice, big, smile on my face.  When he met his end, I didn't particularly care at all...""serves him right"" I thought.  Sasha, makes the little girl from ""War of the Worlds"" seem downright loveable!  Another thing about this movie, for anyone who doubts the love story or interest in this film.  I know a lot of women who have seen this film and they all tell me that the sex scene between Rachel Weitz and Jude Law is one of the hottest scenes they've ever seen and I've heard quite a few say that it's even one of their favorites!  If you want your girl to think you have a heart and... intelligence...than rent this film for her and you'll get plenty of lov'in!  Besides that, she'll (temporarily at least), think you're smart and courageous like Vasilli and the sex scene will keep her happy and... better yet...you won't get bored!  Grreat Move and an even greater movie because of it!  Rent it for both you and Her!",1146960000,3,4811,4.610785463071513
1276433,3,B00003CXRA,"""Enemy at the Gates"" is a work of historical fiction, directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud who also wrote the screenplay along with Alain Godard.  The setting is the battle of Stalingrad which was the turning point in World War II.  The story is about a duel between two snipers:  Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law), a Russian soldier who goes from a foot solider without a rifle, to a state hero, and Major Konig (Ed Harris), an aristocratic German officer who is sent to kill Zaitsev.  This film premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival on February 7th of 2001.

The base story is true, but the account is fictionalized to make a more standard movie.  The movie at the start has a broad focus, concentrating on the battle at the start of the film.  During this part of the movie we do see the main characters, but they are not identified.  The movie then narrows its focus to the main characters, starting with the meeting of Commisar Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) and Zaitsev, where Zaitsev's marksmanship saves the two of them, as he eliminates some German officers and their guards.  The result is that Danilov decides to promote Zaitsev as a hero in his writing, as well as himself in the eyes of Khrushchev (Bob Hoskins).

The relationship between Danilov and Zaitsev is complicated by a love triangle, as Danilov and Zaitsev compete for Tania Chernova (Rachel Weisz), who becomes a soldier herself, as she joins the fight against the Germans.  Another side story includes that of Sacha Filipov (Gabriel Thomson) and his mother (Eva Mattes) who are Tania's neighbors.  Sacha sells information to the Major Konig, but also tips off Danilov so that he can help Zaitsev prevail.

This is not a perfect movie by any means.  The horrors of living in Stalingrad during this battle are not really shown, especially the starvation aspect, which would have well served the sub-plot where Sacha is selling information to Major Konig.  Once the story narrows to the main characters, the battle disappears for the most part, reappearing only when needed.  Finally, the fictionalized story isn't really anything new, there are no chances taken, and there are no real surprises.

This DVD has 5.1 surround sound, and is widescreen enhanced for 16:9 televisions.  There is a behind-the-scenes featurette and cast and crew interviews.  It also contains some additional scenes, which were not used in the movie.

Despite some weaknesses, I do find this movie to be very entertaining, and overall I would definitely recommend this DVD.  The performances by the main characters are all solid, and there are no major flaws or mistakes.  It is true that the story is not 100% accurate historically, but if that is what you are looking for then you really ought to be looking at books on the subject, or perhaps some documentaries and not a movie made primarily for entertainment.",1146614400,,2858,4.885892116182573
1276434,4,B00003CXRA,"I'm not that familiar with the true account of the famed Russian sniper, Vassili Zaitsev so I can't comment on how accurately the script of his accomplishments is portrayed, but as one fairly familiar with the German attack on Stalingrad, ENEMY AT THE GATES is a fair adaptation of the events that occurred there during the 1942 Eastern Front campaign. I do know that Zaitsev did in fact, score 182 kills with his Nosin-Nagant model 1891/30 rifle and did in fact kill the German Major Kulikov, who had been tracking him for 5 days prior to the German withdrawal of Stalingrad.

The story begins when a beleaguered Russian army, on the brink of disaster, and desperately in need of a moral boost. A Russian propagandist (Fiennes) introduces the high command to the story of Zaitsev (Law), a Russian sniper from the Urals wilderness who had successfully killed over a dozen German officers. A local propaganda campaign began and with Zaitsev's elevated stature among the local populace, he draws the ire of the German high command, who send their best sniper, Major Konig (Harris) (I don't know why they chose not to use Kulikov's real name) to engage in a thrilling cat-and-mouse chase between the two warriors. Rachel Weisz adds what is likely a fictionalized romance to the film, and Bob Hoskins gives a brilliant portrayal of a middle aged Nikita Krushchev.

Most notable in this film is the presentation to the western world of the events of the Eastern Front during World War II. An epic saga, for the most part, overlooked by film makers. The peasant army of Russia in the 1930's and 40's was, for the most part, illiterate. Therefore, when compared to the war in the west and in the Pacific, only a fraction of personal accounts have been written on this theater of operations. It's good to see what appears to be a fairly accurate portrayal of that sector of the war.

The acting in this film is above average. The filming itself is great with realistic battle scenes and ensuing chaos that was apparent during the Battle of Stalingrad. The horrors of war are graffic in this movie, so parents should be advised.",1146096000,5,2119,4.752717391304348

This movie takes you to Stalingrad the Nazis last stand and hope to fight off the Russians starting on a boatt getting shot at by planes above heading to the docks to recive a gun or ammo the Russian military weren't to financially well off and could not afford a gun for every soldier so one soldier got a gun and the other a clip of ammo

The whole plot of the movie is a Russian Sniper is born and begins killing to many Nazi officers so the Nazis send their best Sniper to take him out

1276436,5,B00003CXRA,"Based on a true story and handsomely presented, ENEMY AT THE GATES is a rousing World War II action flick chronicling the Battle of Stalingrad as seen through the eyes of Russian soldier Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law,) a young Russian soldier ferried over to the besieged city at the height of battle who soon proves himself a peerless sniper.  In fact, before long Vassili Zaitsev has picked off so many high-ranking officers the Germans call upon their own champion, Maj. Knig (Ed Harris,) to take the precocious young sniper down.

  This movie is the story of their cat-and-mouse hunt for each other through the piling rubble of Stalingrad.  The plot is adorned with a love-triangle involving Vassili, a fellow soldier named Tania Chernova (Rachel Weisz) and a propaganda agent, Commisar Danilov, played by Joseph Fiennes.  Nikita Krushchev (Bob Hoskins) arrives at one point to bully and bluster, drink vodka, resent Stalin, and generally chew a bit of carpet.  Thankfully none of these side streets prove too distracting.  Even when Danilov tells Vassili the fate of Stalingrad, upon which falls the fate of the war, will be determined by which sniper is able to outwit the other, seems a little less forced than it should.

 The half-destroyed city is beautifully recreated and photographed.  The pacing allows for us to spend tense moments with Law and Harris, doing not much more than looking through a gun-sight, without growing bored.  This movie also seems wonderfully edited.  Battles, action characters in movement, are hard to keep track of while maintaining the proper mood and tension, but we never get lost or disentangled from what's going on.  Law is very good as the young shootist who must convince himself he not overmatched, and Harris, in a role that calls for little more than one note, is pitch perfect.  One of the better war movies to come down the pike in a while.",1142726400,4,1890,4.917981072555205

Yes, it was historically inaccurate to have it occur in the daytime, but it made for a more exciting movie.  I found the love scene between Zaitzev and Chernova very erotic.",1139529600,,382,4.507246376811594
1276438,5,B00003CXRA,"At least three films are needed to describe World War II values;  this one is a Russian view, 'Stalingrad' is the German reaction and 'Saving Private Ryan' is for the Americans.

 In each case, lots of men die.  'Ryan' is typically American, stumbling into hell and then showing incredible courage in the belief that despite the bumbling of superiors they will make it a better place.  'Stalingrad' is typically Nazi, based on the heartless assumption that human lives do not matter for any reason.  'Enemy' expresses the ""soul"" of the Russian people, incredibly decent, humane and resourceful despite the total depravities of their communist rulers.

 It's a simple story.  The film opens with masses of Russians being driven into withering German machinegun fire at Stalingrad.  Many of those Russian serfs are without weapons, because their commanders know the unarmed soldiers will be able to use the weapons of those who are the first to be killed.  Gradually, the commissars realize they must treat common soldiers with some decency if they are to avoid defeat.  So, to show the Red Army that it is possible to defeat the Germans, a skilled sniper is elevated to be a popular hero of the people.  It's based on actual events, like the other two films.

 All three are visually stunning, a graphic reminder of the brutal impact of war.  The acting is superb;  the plots, in each case, have an authentic tone.  Purists will have a delight debating picayune details in each film, perhaps never realizing that life and war includes incongruities as well as logic.  If you've been there, you already know anything is possible.

 Instead, watch this film because of how it depicts the character of the Russians, a people who rose far above their communist masters to win a tremendous victory.  It should be remembered the Russians faced and defeated 80 percent of the Nazi military.  The ordinary Russian is resourceful, brave, decent and loyal to a fault to Mother Russia;  Stalin is portrayed as an absolute tyrant who ruled only by extreme terror, while Krushchev is presented as the ruthless commisar who slowly learns to listen to the advice of others.

 As in most literature, the central characters are larger-than-life stereotypes.  In 'Enemy', the Russian sniper and his girlfriend become people anyone would genuinely like to know and invite home for a barbecue;  Krushchev is the boss to definitely avoid, while the German sniper is a prime candidate for lethal injection.

 But this together with gripping action and sustained suspense  --  any fool knows it will end with a dead German and the good Russian alive somewhere with his girlfriend  --  but getting there is a is a beautiful chess game in which pawns, knights, bishops and queens fall until only one king is left alive.  Like most stories, the history may not always be as clear as some would like;  but then, is 'The Illiad' or the Bible accurate history?  Hardly.  Instead, the truly great works of literature and film are more of an impressive study of character and morals.

 In that, it ranks with the best films of World War II.

 Buy this, then get 'Stalingrad' and 'Saving Private Ryan'.  The subtleties within each will be appreciated once all three have been viewed.",1134777600,7,3250,4.886238532110092
1276439,5,B00003CXRA,I really liked this movie.  Jude law was spectacular- as well as all the other actors.  The authenticity of the story made the movie. I highly recommend it,1132358400,2,155,4.5
1276507,1,B00003CXRA,"I was ""temping"" at Sovietski Collection Imports when a huge order arrived for WWll era uniforms and props.  They were to outfit an upcoming film about the snipers of the Battle of Stalingrad!  Not a documentary, but a full length Major Motion Picture!  I could hardly contain my excitement waiting for its debut; it was gonna be so awesome...!
It could have been, but alas, it wasn't.  Anyone remember the Aesop's fable wherein a farmer permits a fox, closely pursued by hunters, to hide in his barn?  Then the farmer loudly tells the hunters he has seen no fox, all the while winking and gesturing toward the barn.  The hunters depart, not getting the message.  As the fox takes her leave, the farmer berates her for showing no gratitude.  ""I would be more grateful,"" she replies, ""if only your body language had been as helpful as your words.""  Likewise, ""Enemy at the Gates"" gets a star of gratitude for recognizing the enormous Soviet contribution to the Victory, and for its portrayal of sympathetic Russian and Ukrainian heroes based on real people.  But, like Aesop's fox, I'm unimpressed by its overall body language.
OK, I didn't expect strict historical accuracy from Jean-Jacques Annaud.  After all, he had previously given us that ludicrously un-natural ""nature"" film of a male bear nurturing an orphan cub!  One expects Hollywood fantasy to pervade even ""realistic"" movies.  The fact that EATG's famous duel likely never occured does not detract from the overall story.  Silly melodrama, banal dialogue, distracting accents, and unbelievable actions, to a greater degree, do.  But I could have overlooked those.  I could even forgive the unrealistic suspensions of fighting which occur each time the snipers take to the streets.  Because EATG gives us the immensely interesting Stalingrad setting, complete with long overdue Eastern Front heroes for us to root for!  But wait... all is not what it seems.  Unfortunately, its overwhelming amount of heavyhanded russophobic propaganda suggests that the producers' fear, like that of Aesop's farmer, was being pegged an ""enemy collaborator.""  And unlike the hunters in the fable, the audience can't possibly miss the (wink, nudge) ""message.""
I could cite dozens of examples, but here are just a few, crafted to create a politically-correct counterbalance of Russian incompetance and callousness:  #1.  That unforgetable Volga crossing; those sluggishly moving boats under unopposed Stuka fire!  In reality, most crossings were done at night, under cover of darkness and Soviet air defense forces (PVO).  #2.  Those human waves of unarmed cannonfodder hurling themselves against German fortifications, shadowed by NKVD gunners itching to mow down any retreat!  In fact, depicted here are a penal battalion and blocking troops, not a typical Red Army engagement.  This scene is especially dishonest, because in Stalingrad, highly effective ten-man squads, well armed with machine guns and other weapons, engaged in urban guerrilla combat.  The setting was more likely a ruined house or factory than an open town square!  #3.  Those CGI formations of German bombers brazenly razing the city -- and no Russian planes in sight!  In fact, Stalingrad was where Soviet aviation finally gained air superiority over the Luftwaffe.  Fighter pilots of the PVO guarded installations and strategic locations.  ""Free Hunters"" of the Soviet air force (VVS) patrolled the city, seeking targets of opportunity.  Some of these pilots, such as the female ACE Lilya Litvyak, became as legendary as the famous sniper Vasiliy Zaitsev.
Which brings me to EATG's main characters.  Zaitsev, while played charmingly by Hollywood heartthrob Jude Law, was actually a strict, self-confident leader, not a shy farmboy.  He did have a frontline affair with one of his female snipers.  (One of the film's redeeming features is its recognition of the million-plus Soviet women combatants.)  We never see Weiss's character fire her weapon.  However, Tanya Chernova was already a partisan and sniper before meeting Zaitsev, and scored some 81 kills in her short war-career. The young Ukrainian was obsessed with avenging her family -- to the point of disregarding Zaitsev's training.  After she initiated one premature firefight, resulting in the deaths of her comrades, Zaitsev slapped her across the face in rage.  So much for the tender Hollywood romance!  Nor did he return for her following her wounding and recovery.  When asked why, he coldly replied he didn't want a woman whose injuries prevented her from bearing children!  The political officer Danilov is misrepresented in the film, an embarrassing, contrived character whose purpose is to provide Zaitsev a romantic rival.  For most of the movie, the character is the producers' main vehicle for disseminating their russophobic sentiment.  At the end, Danilov's tearful anti-communist epiphany and lovesick sacrifice are not only unconvincing but nauseating.  Equally hamhanded, politically-correct anti-commie dialogue was scripted for Ron Perlman's completely wasted character.  Also irritating was the film's portrayal of Sasha, the too-adorable chocolate-loving child martyr.  The real Sasha, who met the same fate as the celluloid urchin, was a partisan already in his late teens.  And the less said about the outrageously over-the-top performance of Bob Hoskins as Nikita Khruschev, the better!
All in all, this film promised so much greatness and delivered so much b.s.  I'm sorry to say so.  But the truth is this:  I would be embarrassed to sit through this offensive mess with any of my Russian friends.  The German film ""Stalingrad"" gives a much more accurate and serious impression of the turning-point battle.  William Craig's book, which inspired the title and some of the scenes of EATG, is worth reading.  David L. Robbins' historical fiction ""War of the Rats"" will appeal to those interested in snipers, although it has way too much emphasis on the Zaitsev/Chernova love affair (and even portrays Tanya as an American).  My recommendation for anyone who would like to experience a truly realistic novel of the Battle of Stalingrad, by a writer who was on site: find a translated copy of Konstantin Simonov's ""Days and Nights.""

Sure, this was a great movie for passing the time, great action, fine acting, and so forth.  The truth is the whole plotline is false, not that they ever truly claim it to be based on a true story.  He is one soldier, one of millions in Soviet army.  They sadly idolize Zaitsev as the hero of Soviet.  The truth was, there would be little knowledge of him around Soviet Union at the time.

Tania was Zaitsev's lover, but she was wounded during a raid on a German HQ, not by shrapnel and Zaitsev actually carried her back to Soviet lines. The young boy, Sacha Fillipov, is also a true character who was hanged for his spying. The duel between Zaitsev and Koenig was more like Hollywood in real life than it was in the movie. Zaitsev and Kulikov, who died in the movie, managed to trick Konings to shoot a helmet, Kulikov stood up and acted as if he had been shot, when Konings looked at his ""victim"", Zaitsev shot him in between the eyes.

1276515,5,B00003CXRA,"If anyone ever does a picture about Khruschev, Bob Hoskins must play the lead role. And it wouldn't be typecasting either, because he only shows up for a total of, say, ten minutes in this film as Khruschev in his Stalingrad position as the senior Political Comissar. (What, you ask, is a Political Commissar? Read on.)This was a much sweeter assignment,apparently, for Nikita Sergeievich than his previous one, which was to surrender Kiev.

But back to Mr. Hoskins. This, my friends, is acting. Never mind the make up job that turns the star of Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Mona Lisa, and the Cotton Club into the star of the Cuban Missile Crisis and The Secret Meeting About Stalin.  Never mind the set-up by excited crowds whispering about ""Stalin's envoy"" (didn't they know he'd surrendered Kiev?). In one sweeping scene, Hoskins manages to convey Khruschevian brutality (throwing a pistol at his predecessor with a gruff, ""You might want to avoid the red tape""), fearmongering contempuousness as he slowly inspects the political officers, and his propensity for odd witticisms: ""I want our boys to stop [expletive connotating defecation] their pants."" ""This isn't Leningrad. It isn't Moscow. This is Stalingrad. This city bears the name of [leans into trembling officers face ominously] the boss."" Does he raise his voice? No, he doesn't have to.

Then we see him shift, chameleon like, in response to a suggestion an officer Danilov gives when Khruschev demands one. ""Hope. They need hope."" When Danilov tells Khruschev that yes, he knows a hero who can provide such hope, a sharpshooter who was able to kill five Germans one right after the other in order to save the officer and himself, a smile literally creeps across the senior officer's  face. It's clear he's decided this is information he can use.

Brilliant performance. Five minutes to show emotions and characteristics that run the gamut with a character who's been diagnosed posthumously as being something less than mentally balanced. Mr. Hoskins, I salute you! Jude Law does well too, although he's a young'n here with room to grow.

""Enemy At the Gates"" tells us,on one level, about one of the most brutal battles of The Great Patriotic War. But the main character in this story isn't the people of Stalingrad or the Soviet army, it's a rifleman named Vassili Zaitzev (a real guy, apparently, who has his own monument someplace) who is touted as an expert marksman after killing the five Germans Danilev mentioned above. The information about this, as a result of the Commissar's little machine, gets out all over the USSR, and before you can say ""Nastrovye!"", Vassili is like a Soviet Frank Sinatra, getting fan male from Minsk to Pinsk. No dummy, Vassili realizes quickly he's being used, and protests. To no avail, however. Khruschev and Danilov are not above putting the child of a friend in mortal danger to continue the sniper exploits and the positive press they bring.

So, apparently, this is what Political Comissars do: they  run around creating and putting out propoganda about the great work other people are doing while these other people actually do the work, perhaps even risking their lives.(The scary thing is, given Stalingrad's remarkable victory, its Comissars' propoganda may have actually done some good.) Danilov et al, in the film, continue to use Vassili as agitprop to spruce up morale among soldiers and citizens alike. In an art-meets-reality spin, Annaud himself creats a final duel between Zaitzev and his German counterpart in the film that never occurred.

 Annaud's theme of someone just trying to do their job, only to have someone else exploit it for the good of ""the collective"", with sometimes tragic results, could be reflective of a minor scale of a certain seventy year experiment with a nation full of workers. Or, arguably, of the perceived need in any conflict for the folks on the home front to believe their boys are doing well.

And historically inaccurate though it may be, the sniper duel scene pretty much rocks the free world. Or the Communist world. Whatever.",1125446400,3,4078,4.991163475699558

 The movie kicks off at the battle of Stalingrad, as troops cross the Volga River, awaiting on the other side is the Nazi war machine crusing any resistance!!!When they reach other side, they are welcomed by chaos, death, and destruction, and are sent to press the attack!!!

An, ordinary soldier named Vassili Zaitsev(Jude Law) only with a clip  of ammo is sent in with hundreds of others, on a suicide charge, in a hoppless attempt to break the German lines!!! They move forward and are mowed down, and if they retreat they are shot by their officers, a lose, lose situation!!! Vassili some how survives the battle and is met by Danilov(Joesph Fiennes), a political officer, who becomes his best friend!!! When he sees, Vassili Zaitsev take out 7 German officers!!!

 Meanwhile, Kruschev (Bob Hoskins) comes to Stalingrad to take control of the situation. Danilov, tells him a different way of motivating the soldiers instead of giving them the choice of bullets, he suggest that they encourage them and make examples, or heros!!! From their on, Vassili becomes the center of propaganda, and the Red Army forms the sniper division, and form a brave counter offensive against the Nazi army, in the ruins of Stalingrad!!!

 Vassili and Danilov, are best friend, but then get caught in a love triangle, between the beautiful Tania (Rachel Weisz) and things start to heat up!!! Meanwhile, the Germans send in their best sniper Major Konig(Ed Harris), to kill the great Vassil Zaitsev that is reaking havok among the German Army!!! As, the struggle for Stalingrad rages on, a private war rages on, playing cat and mouse in a fight to the death, in the vast ruins of the great city!!!

 Sounds like, a great movie huh, well it is more than great!!! This movie tells about how the Russian snipers, the greatest being Vassili Zaitsev (242 kills total), played an important in the battle of Stalingrad, which was a turning point in the war!!! THis has to be the best WW2 movie since ""Saving Private Ryan"",!!!

 Everything was perfect about the movie, especially the cast of actors, along with the realistic feel, and sheer visual genius!!! The special features are woth checking out too!!! This movie is an instant classic that you will savor every minute of action packed excitment, along with realistic combat!!!

Overall, I will give this a 5/5, for being a fantastic war movie about the great sniper war going on during Stalingrad!!! THis opens up The Eastern Front for the first time as well as WW2 sniper theme going on!!! This is a tale of the Legendary Vassli Zaitsev!! This is great for any action fan or anybody that loves great war movies!!!

The criticisms I read about Enemy at the Gates are, by and large, correct!  And, as a rule, I do not like war movies.  So why on earth do I think this is a great movie?!  I did happen to read the account of the sniper duel at the heart of the story, many years ago.  (The story has been made more marketable, the love story is silly, but it is in essence truer to history than other much hyped movies...)

Well, the performances are great.  The movie tells of a battle that was central to WWII.

I think I rate this movie so highly because it focuses on the brutal win or lose nature of total war.  That's what it came down to.  If the Russians lost they were going to be massacred en masse - that was Hitler's plan to make room for German expansion to the East.  No 'earn this' like at the end of Private Ryan. WWII was about the life and death of vast numbers of civilians.  The upbeat ending is bogus - yes I agree.

But the abject, brutal Power you are going to feel - the blow to your chest that will have you aching all over comes from the setting - the incredible squalor and waste of the siege/defense of Stalingrad.

  Every sight is overcast, dark, dingy, dirty, cold and deadly. The people, if you can believe they are still people, seem most like maggots scurrying about in a cold, dank tomb, day after grinding day.

  Every mindless, ghastly horror of War you can think of, from the total Dehumanization of young and old - to the pointless mass reduction of lives to gore and stench - to the total Avarice of politicians - to the total Malignancy of Greed and Power - is hurled straight into in your face.

It's surreal, but a fitting introduction to a movie about the harrowing, intersecting worlds of a sniper and a propagandist.

The hero gets his rifle (a very bad thing for Wehrmacht officers), but the film never develops into the sniper movie action-oriented viewers expect. Instead, it has more to say about the megaphone than the Dragunov, offering insights aplenty into propaganda in wartime and the terror of life under Stalin. On top of that, there's a robust allegorical layer far more complex than it first appears.

As a couple or three hundred reviewers have noted, this film has its share of problems: The plot twists are telegraphed, a Russian accent couldn't be located for Mr. Law, the lighting calls attention to itself, and the romantic element has all the chemistry of a firefly. But unless you watch movies like a producer, you can probably put the nit-picking aside and enjoy the film.

Oh, and one last thing: Apparently, Soviet rifles never need cleaning. And to think they lost the Cold War.",1114819200,3,1338,4.88546255506608

Ed Harris is great as the Unemotional German sniper, but he's so completely american in his language that its almost unbelievable to completely believe him.

Unlike Saving Private Ryan, Pearl Harbor, D-day or Tora Tora Tora, Enemy at the Gates evolves completely around the Germans and Russians. Not once does anyother civilization involved in the war enter into this struggle. Its different to watch if all you've ever seen is the American side against the Germans, and it gives us a understanding on how far the German's arm did indeed reach during that time.

1276542,3,B00003CXRA,"The movie is set in Russia, Stalingrad(Now known as Volgograd after Premier Nikita Kruschev changed it when stalin's falsified image was uncovered by Nikita) starring Jude Law as Vassili Zaitsev a Russian born soviet sniper expert and one of the all time soviet sniper aces of world war two, the movie is mixed with parts of fact and alot of american/western propaganda after the war and when the coldwar began, the movie begins with Jude's character being forced from one transport to another, as a conscript in the soviet army, namely a poorly equiped, badly moralled and poorly used soviet army(all mostly being myths for a deeper depth and urgency to the movie thus being hollywoodized) Jude's character find himself becoming a sniper in the russian army after showing his skill to a officer, Danilov and this is where a love triangle begins minus one angle so well it's just a love story begins, Vassili and Danilov become fast friends, Danilov being a politcal officer in charge of propaganda to counter the Nazi propaganda chooses Vassili to be the hope of stalingrad, a person that all slavic soldiers and civilians could look up to in the dire time of the war, so to ensure his own position and safety from his higher ups Danilov rests his hopes on Vassili as well, soon after Vassili becomes a major threat to the fascists war effort in stalingrad and send their own sniper ace to counter Vassili and his fledgling student snipers, and counter he does, Ed Harres as Major Konig soon meets up to vassili on the battle field in a game of hide and seek in the torn city of stalingrad, from the love triangle both vassili and danilov meet up with a local city milita girl named Tania Chernova played by Rachel Weisz, Tania soon after Vassili and Danilov begin to compete for this girl.

Without spoiling the ending, enemy at the gates is a good action movie, but DO NOT take this movie as any type of historical reference, the movie is mostly mythical in almost every way so if your looking for a action WW2 movie then this ones for you, if your looking for a accurate ww2 movie do not get this.",1114387200,,2101,4.602666666666667
1276543,4,B00003CXRA,"For all the widespread critical acclaim that surrounded the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan (which portrayed the D-Day invasion Normandy landing), little is said about the opening scenes of Enemy At The Gates. Just as lifelike and certainly as, if not more, compelling, Enemy At The Gates paints a vivid picture of the Battle of Stalingrad...

As Nazi forces besiege the city, Russian peasants are shipped across the river in undefended boats. As Luftwaffe swoop down from the skies and rain bullets on the men below, only the mountain of bodies that topple on top of a man can save him from being shot himself. Those who do survive and make it to shore are armed with a single Kalashnikov - but not every man, only every other man... The unarmed men are instructed to follow a man with gun, and when he is killed, to pick up the weapon himself and fight the enemy valiantly.

Sharp-shooting farm boy Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law) finds himself thrust into this bloody environment. As part of the initial wave of the Russian advance, he is forced to play dead and hide among the mangled bodies of his countrymen when the Germans annihilate the Russian offensive. Using the bodies as cover, he puts his sniper skills to work, not against the animals he used to shoot for food, but against German officers exposed to his crosshairs. Vassili's brilliant talents are immediately recognized by Commisar Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) who ends up befriending the man.

As a powerful figure in the Communist propaganda machine, Danilov uses his skills and connections to transform Vassili into a larger-than-life hero, creating the impression that he is capable of defeating the German army all by himself. It's Danilov's hope that by creating a recognizable face for the war effort, he can raise the morale of the Russian forces and turn the tide against the advancing German armies.

But the relationship between the two men becomes complicated when Vassili and Danilov both fall in love with the same woman, a female soldier named Tania Chernova (Rachel Weisz). Will Danilov's jealousies turn him against his friend? The man who made Vassili is certainly capable of tearing him down, and in the Soviet Union, no one is above the wrath of Stalin... Vassili's problems are further accentuated by the announced arrival of his German counterpart, Major Konig (Ed Harris), winner of the Iron Cross and the most celebrated sniper in German history.

Based on the true story of the two real life soldiers, Zaitsev and Konig, Enemy At The Gates sticks closely to the historical record concerning the showdown between these noted wartime figures. Were they mere creations of propaganda? Or was this the individual battle of the century? Only history can make that distinction. Meanwhile, Enemy At The Gates makes a place for itself among the great war dramas of our era. A well-cultivated screenplay, coupled with an unparalleled visual display of the destructiveness of war, makes this a must-see film - both for its educational and historical value as well as its edge-of-your-seat excitement...

The DVD Report",1113868800,2,3096,4.9787234042553195
1276544,3,B00003CXRA,"An underexplored WWII chapter, the battle for Stalingrad, is interestingly examined in this big budget epic...notable for its spectacular battle scenes and another pitch perfect performance from the gifted Jude Law.

Unfortunately, the screenplay follows in the footsteps of TITANIC and PEARL HARBOR by  tossing in the obligatory Hollywood ""love triangle"" (scored by James Horner, you often think the iceberg might be just around the next corner) which doesn't work, in spite of Law and the excellent Rachel Weisz.

Top billed Joseph Fiennes is out of his element and can't keep up with his two main costars.  His scenes with Bob Hoskins, who seems to channel Kruschev by way of Danny Devito, are similarly lackluster.  Ed Harris, who looks every bit the part of a Nazi aristocrat, looks like he's more concerned about why he's speaking with an American accent than he does about finding his prey.  The accents, incidentally, range from Midwestern to Cockney to Ye Olde English to unintelligible (Ron Perlman) ...everything under the sun, except German or Russian: the nationalities of all the characters.

The intellectual and charismatic director, Jean-Jacques Annaud, was apparently trying to be all things to all people and  the result is a mediocre movie worth watching if only for the battle scenes and Law/Weitz performances.

The DVD offers no particularly interesting special features.  Given the fact that such an important episode in WWII history has been under exploited by Hollywood, a director or historian's commentary track would have been welcome.",1112400000,4,1564,5.295546558704453

Great history deflated to a boring love blahblah  on war background  in embarassingly badly crafted dcor - reminds of Spartacus movies of the 50ies or the first Star Trek serials with plastic rocks flying around. Very listless. Dully played by most of the actors. If something is mud and dirty - must be Russian. Annaud proves this beautiful attitude once again.

It's weird, we usually see good versus bad in war movies like this (meaning, America vs Whoever Else), so it was hard to take my eyes away from fighting armies who have no regard for human life on either side. Not that this is what the movie is REALLY about. We all know it's about sniper versus sniper, and I agree with the other reviewer that it's about the PEOPLE involved, how they deal with existing in a surreal war environment like this. What drags the movie a little IS the romantic subplot, but the other subplot about the German sniper and the Russian boy was actually very interesting. Not the greatest war movie, but certainly fresh and much needed. Whenever I watch it playing on a movie channel, I can't take my eyes off it.

I have watched this, utterly rivetted, several times these last months, and my fascination with the historical period and characters is undiminished.

1276608,2,B00003CXRA,"Judging by all the comments made about the historical innacuracy of this film (somehow the outcome of biggest battle in the history of the world hinges on the personal gun duel between a Russian speaking with an English accent and a German speaking with an American accent), or the hackneyed way the contrived romance displaces what ought to be the real story in the movie (the sniper duel), I still rented this movie hoping that I would like it.

To be honest, there were some very fascinating parts of this film -- even the innactuarate ones like the nonsensical opening phase of the film is still interesting to watch.

The sniper scenes are also interesting to watch, however I doubt that a huge battle between several hundred thousands of soldiers would suddenly cease just so that a sniper duel between two people can have greater dramatic tension. There are many points when the snipers reveal themselves in the open where, although perhaps invulnerable to each other, would make wonderful targets for other soldiers, including other snipers.

I also found the ending very odd. I got the impression that when the Russians were evacuating the city across the Volga river, that the Germans were poised for victory. Suddenly, the movie cuts to the next scene where somehow the Germans lost. Although this is true historically, the movie offers no context or explanation for the sudden change in fortune. In reality the change in fortune came about because of large Russian army counterattacks on an overextended German line, but the movie tries to tell you that the battle was decided one the Russian sniper bested the German sniper.

PLEASE.

Overall, an okay movie. My boyfriend majors in european history and he was more disappointed in this movie than I. I could stand the romance, however the way it was played was too cutesy and unlikely. This movie is a throw-away popcorn flick that for some reason thinks it's better than it really is.

1276611,4,B00003CXRA,"The fortunes of the Second World War on the Eastern Front were played out both in a macrocosmic and a microcosmic way, the former being the German army versus the Soviet army, the latter being the personal duel of two opposing infantrymen in war-torn Stalingrad in the autumn of 1942.

Such is the setting for this movie, which deals with the brutality of the no-holds-barred war between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, where no quarter was expected or given. Stalingrad was to be epitomized as the turning point of the war on the Eastern Front (and the graphic showing the map of Nazi-occupied Europe being ""inked"" over by a spreading swastika showed this memorably), yet the focus for this film was on four particular people: sniper Vassili Zaitzev (Jude Law), upon whose real-life experiences in Stalingrad the film is based, the political officer Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), their mutual love interest Tania (Rachel Weisz) and the German army sniper Major Konig (Ed Harris).

While the Germans do their level best to kill every Soviet army soldier in sight both on the ground and from the air, the Soviets have to kill the enemy as well as avoid being shot themselves for ""cowardice"". In one harrowing scene, shortly after Zaitzev lands ashore after being nearly killed while crossing the Volga in a flimsy passenger boat, soldiers fall back after an utterly ill-thought-out infantry attack involving both armed and unarmed soldiers against enemy positions, such was the desperation - and absurdity - behind the ""tactics"" intended to throw the enemy back, only to be mown down by fellow soldiers at the behest of fanatical ""no-retreat"" officers.

And yet even the German commander-in-chief (Matthias Habich) tells Konig upon first meeting him that his army ""was not meant for this kind of fighting"", a sign that defeat was already on the way - hence, the (unrealistic) idea that the killing of Zaitzev might somehow demoralize the Soviets to such an extent that they may lose heart in fighting for Stalingrad's survival. Certainly, Krushchev (played with vigor by Bob Hoskins), after hearing a report that the famed shepherd boy from the Urals had been killed, believed that with that memorable line to Danilov, ""What are they [the Germans] supposed to do? Dangle his body in front of our men?!""

Many war movies, amongst them ""The Blue Max"" (1966), ""Mosquito Squadron"" (1968), ""Zeppelin"" (1971) and ""The Pianist"" (2002), inevitably involve principal male characters falling in love with female characters, yet such sub-plots usually are seen as doing more to damage, if not derail, the main story. In this case, it is the ""cat-and-mouse"" sniper duel between Zaitzev and Konig, with ""moves"" being played out according to information being passed on to both men by a boy named Sacha (Gabriel Marshall-Thompson), who believes in Zaitzev yet ultimately loses his life in a shocking way.

With the ""love triangle"" involving Zaitzev, Danilov and Tania, it is tempting to believe that it is totally unnecessary and might lead to many in the audience cringing to the point of frustration, given the amount of time devoted to it. Nevertheless, instead of putting Russia first, Danilov's interest in Tania and his jealousy betray his weak character, as he is prepared both to abandon his main propaganda tool and to betray his comrade by daring to report to the authorities Zaitzev's alleged ""change of attitude"", much to the shock of the woman who has to type his lies (although, curiously, this betrayal is never followed up). With friends like him, who needs enemies? Certainly not Zaitzev, who admitted to Danilov at one point that he was on the verge of cracking up, because he was being made to carry a burden that he would otherwise never have chosen had he realized what Danilov was getting him into. Only the manner of Sacha's death stiffens the Russian sniper's resolve to kill the German responsible.

As a war film, ""Enemy at the Gates"" has more going for it than some might suggest. As well as Robert Fraisse's photography of a city being bombarded and destroyed, the dark colors and constantly burning buildings creating the mood, Alain Godard and Jean-Jacques Annaud, both of whom had worked together on ""The Name of the Rose"" (1986), have produced a memorable movie dealing with one of the darkest chapters in world history with their meticulous attention to detail. Even the scene where Zaitzev tells Tania, ""These people know they're going to die, so each night they come back is a celebration"", shows just how characteristically the Russians viewed both their lives and the situation in general, as they battled to keep Stalingrad in their hands, which they eventually succeeded in doing after 180 days of the hardest fighting ever experienced by two opposing armies during what the Soviets termed the ""Great Patriotic War"".",1106524800,,4839,5.004968944099379
1276612,4,B00003CXRA,"I am bit amused to read so many negative reviews about this movie which people complaints of historical inaccuracy and all that sort of nonsense. And these are probably the same people who praised movies like Braveheart, Elizabeth, Windtalkers and other numerous historical movies that have no concept of being historically accurate.

Enemy at the Gates is based on the true Soviet hero but obviously it been fictionalized to meet the Hollywood's standards for entertainment and story. This is typical and not abnormal as some people thinks. Jude Law does an very good job in the lead role and he proves to be well supported by his supporting cast members like Joseph Fiennes, Rachel Wiesz and Ed Harris. Does it really matter if Ed Harris' German sniper ace really existed or not?? Does it matter that Mel Gibson wore kilts in Braveheart when real William Wallace never did?? Or Christ was nailed on the Latin cross in Passion of Christ when he was actually nailed on a Roman ""T"" cross? I guess not so when does historical inaccuracy doom any movie??

The movie was made with a singular view point of Jude Law's character. Fiennes' character was most uneven as he goes from overzealous promoter to jealous lover. The romance angle was not bad as Rachel Weisz provided an interesting character. Their love scene among the dirty sleeping soldiers in the bunker add a certain level of reality to their situation. Ed Harris provides an interesting and challenging foe as an ace German sniper whose ego regarded his duel with Vassili like a game. I thought the movie was pretty entertaining as both sides play their cat and mouse game as the story unfold. Interestingly, you never really know who's the mouse and who's playing the cat!

The DVD of Enemy at the Gates proves to be a pretty good set. The image quality is pretty good and the sound effects works well in Dolby Digital 5.1. There are also few extra features included in the DVD which may or may not enchane your viewing pleasure.

I thought this was one of the underrated World War II movies that came out in our recent years. It could just be that Soviet heroes are not popular Hollywood material (Harrison Ford's K-19 movie sunk at the box offices too).",1104969600,2,2214,4.713178294573644
1276613,1,B00003CXRA,"While I was excited to see Jude Law and Joseph Fiennes in the same movie, `Enemy at the Gates' still managed to disappoint me both in plot and acting. This movie is another in the series of easily predictable cookie cutter `war/love' films to come out of Hollywood. Peppered with irrelevant metaphors of wolves and donkeys, I found myself laughing at the moments that were supposed to be serious. For example, Danilov says, `What we need is a hero.' Khrushchev sarcastically replies, `Do you know any heroes?' Danilov answers, `I know one.' Please, this scene happens in every movie. Naturally after that conversation, the camera moves to the main character, who is also the `hero' previously talked about. As for the romance, it was completely unnecessary. The romance was so forced. There were no sparks between Jude Law and Rachel Weisz. The love scene in the barracks was completely unbelievable as well as unpassionate. First, I thought it was totally lame that they make the girl start it especially if we're supposed to believe that she's a virgin. Second, she looked as if she were in pain during the whole sex part and if they were really in love, he would act like he cared instead of pounding away. Third, like the guy walking through wouldn't notice, let's get realistic here.

I personally think that I may have enjoyed the movie if Tania character were a guy or not in the movie at all. The love was not only forced, but was completely unnecessary and took away from the movie instead of making it better. Her character was a complete stereotype the `smart strong independent coy tomboy.' How she was going to be involved was so obvious and bland. I was relieved when she got shot, I thought there was going to be a plot twist, but alas she miraculously bounced back to perfect health in some random hospital. It was clear that the love part of the movie was in it because it was part of this equation that supposedly equals `good epic film.' Visually, I got pretty tired of the shaking and moving camera during fight scenes and scenes with sniper stuff. I know that it was supposed to create confusion and discomfort like the characters feel, but it didn't work for me for over two hours. I did however, really like the fonts that they used on screen in the beginning and again in the credits in the end. I think those parts were visually well done. The favorite part of the movie was the part with the map and the Nazi regime looking like black blood infesting Europe. I thought that was a great visual representation of what was happening at that time. The only scene that had any positive impact on me was the beginning when all the soldiers were being forced out of the train to battle to fight and most likely die. That scene was pretty well done but the blood explosions in slow motion were a little too much. This movie was trying to be a riveting `epic film' geared toward everyone with war and explosions for guys and love and `hot guys' for girls. With all these supposedly promising ingredients the film didn't work because there was no chemistry between Fiennes and Law or between Law and Weisz. This is a hard thing to not have because they were trying to portray these dramatic roles that were very heavy and serious but instead the acting and `love' scenes made me laugh instead of identify with them.

1276687,4,B00003CXRA,"An unneccesary and often excruiatingly annoying love triangle, best friends who fall apart and then reconcile somewhat, Soviet soldiers who all speak with British accents- it sounds something like Pearl Harbor and everything like a bad movie, but Enemy at the Gates is able to overcome its weaknesses and shapes up into a decent war movie.

The battle for Stalingrad was one of the bloodiest and most important conflicts in one of the bloodiest and most important conflicts in history.  Over 95% of the once-proud city on the Volga was destroyed, providing the perfect setting for snipers to pick off enemy soldiers and weaken morale.  Thrust into this crucible was Vassili Zeitsez, a shepard from the Urals and crackshot who soon became the object of a Soviet Propaganda mission.  With every officer he killed and dogtag he collected his legend grew, until finally the Nazis sent in a crack sniper of their own to take him out.

Although the latter is almost certainly a work of fiction, the movie depicts the duels between the two snipers very well, and although it is a given that none will die before the conclusion, that for once does not translate into a lack of tension.  The set design is nothing short of brilliant, and at no point does the veiwer feel that he or she is not right in the center of a bombed-out industrial city.  The opening battle scene, from the harrowing crossing of the Volga to the vastly under-equipped Soviet troops charging the entrenched German army, is brilliant and one of the best even put to film.

However, the film is not without its faults, some of which are major.  The love-triangle is incredibly unneccesary and irratating: this is a war movie, there is no need for the cute soldier who tears apart a strong friendship.  In addition, the fact that all the Soviets spoke with British accents irratated me strongly.  I know it's a minor point,  but are American viewers so ignorant that they'll only veiw people as ""foriegn"" if they sound different?

However, this is a decent war movie and bears watching, if only to see Harris's physical acting at the end of the film.  7/10",1097280000,,2118,4.735694822888283

I think that many viewers will enjoy this movie greatly because it is not the typical war movie. There are large battle scenes, but what makes Enemy at the Gates so unique is that the story revolves around two snipers so it results in a deadly game of cat and mouse.

1276690,4,B00003CXRA,"Enemy at the Gates is a pretty good war flick. It's a five star movie trapped with in a four with only a few flaws.

Vassili Zaitsev(Law) is Russian thrown into WWII. He's been sent to fight at Stalingrad and is sent without a weapon. He's told to pick one up off his fallen comrades. He is quickly put into a tight spot, but Vassili knows how to use a rifle. His grandfather taught him from a child to shoot one. He quickly kills some Germans and is spotted by Commisar Danilov(Fiennes) a low lying Russian political officer.

He sees the deeds that Vassili has done and sees it as an opportunity. He reprts what he's seen to Khrushchev(Hoskins) who is the Russian commander in Stalingrad. It's Danilov's idea to build up Vassili's deeds in print to help with the morale of the city. The ploy works and Vassili is sent on more sniper missions in the city because of the effectiveness they are having against the Germans.

The whole city of Stalingrad is undersiege and even the townfolk are helping with the war. Tania Chernova(Weisz) is an educated pretty woman. She quickly gets the eye of Vassili and Danilov and they both fall for her. Vassili enjoys Tania's company and she even goes on some missions with him. Danilov thinks it's a waist of her education and a torn in friendship and loyalty is made between the two because of her.

The legend of Vassili is stating to grow even more with the more kills he gets. The Germans morale is beginning to fade and the Russians are starting to make a push. To stop this threat they decide to bring in a special sniper this time for the assignment. They bring in Maj. Knig is not just a good German sniper. He is the lead trainer for the Nazi army and is one objective is to kill Vassili.

The game of cat and mouse is on as the snipers hunt each other. The odds are stacked against Vassili because Danilov won't let him know of the exact danger he is in. Someone must win because the winner of this vendetta could decide the fate of Stalingrad.

Jude Law gives in my opinion the second best performance of his carear. He doesn't equal the job that he does in Cold Mountain but he's fantastic as Vassili. This guy can really act and he is quicly becoming one of my more favorite actors. He doesn't give a real good Russian accent which is his only flaw.

The other actors are good in the movie. Ed Harris is good as Konig as is Fiennes as Danilov. Weisz is alright as the love interest but is a waste to the film.

The love story really does hurt the film. They never develop it much to be a huge major part of the story. The whole movie is based off a real story and I've never heard of Vassili having a girlfriend. I know they had to do some stuff for filler, but if you are at ;east make it worth our time.

This is a good war flick. It's the best movie that I've seen to date on the battle of Stalingrad, but it should have been more. It's still great though and the showdown between Harris and Law is worth the wait. If you like war films or a good thriller, you won't want to miss this one.",1094428800,2,3044,4.261698440207972

1276692,3,B00003CXRA,"When this movie was announced I was quite excited because I wrongly thought it would be based on William Craig's outstanding book of the same name which I have read more than once. Unfortunately, this film is a major failure. The Battle of Stalingrad was an epic engagement that changed the course of the Second World War. By focusing on sniper Vassily Zaitsev's supposed duel with the German sniper, Konings (which author Antony Beevor in his book ""Stalingrad"" doubts even occurred), the whole drama

 of the battle, both from the point of view of the commanders as well as the men on the ground participating in the ""Rattenkrieg"" (rat's war) is lost. There are glaring errors in the film, one of which is the playing of the Soviet National Anthem which in reality was not adopted until 1944.

 The reason I give this film a 3 star rating and not less, which it really deserves is because British and American viewers generally have no idea of what went on in the Russo-German front

 of the Second World War. Movies like ""The Longest Day"" give the impression that the Western Allies won the war all by themselves, whereas in truth, 3/4 of the entire strength of the German army was destroyed by the USSR. It is the Soviets who really paid the price in blood for the ultimate defeat of Nazi

 Germany. Since this film does at least brings out the sacrifices of the Soviet peoples, I give it an extra star. I am still waiting for the true story of Stalingrad to come to the screen.",1091491200,3,1481,4.541353383458647
1276693,2,B00003CXRA,"Jean-Jacques Annaud directs this movie surrounding true characters and events during the WWII campaign for Stalingrad: the turning point against Germany in the Eastern Front.

 Jude Law plays Vassily Zaitzev a Russian peasant who enrolls with the Red Army and is sent to Stalingrad to get his first combat experience. As the battle progresses, he soon finds himself to be one of the best marksmen in the Red Army. Frustrated at the losses suffered during the constant skirmishes, the German army seeks to send their own specialized marksman to dispose of Vassily. German Major Konig (Ed Harris) takes the challenge and vows to kill Vassily and bring honor back to the Wermacht.

 The movie tries to capture the audience into the horrors of Stalingrad but becomes trapped by its own Hollywood style. The characters quickly become two-dimensional stereotypes lost in conventional and predictably boring Hollywood sub-plots canned with the usual cliche dialogue. The love story was unecessary, stereotypical, and just plain irritating. Throughout the movie, the director seemed more interested at making humorous jabs of Soviets and communism instead of emphasizing the dramatic elements of the plot. This undermined the director's attempts at presenting the story as a true drama and instead reduced it to the credibility level of a generic Rambo 3 movie.

 The movie isn't worth owning or a second look after rental. For a more sober portrayal of this decisive battle and its effects on the human condition, I would recommend the two German films titled ""Stalingrad"" instead.",1091059200,3,1574,5.250996015936255
1276694,4,B00003CXRA,"Enemy at the Gates is a suspenseful account of the famous Russian sniper Vassily, his duel with the German sniper Konig, and the three other characters that change his life during the battle at Stalingrad.  The film portrays the attitudes of the war in an almost original perspective, suffering all to the terrible inflictions of war, while demonstrating the madness that could only be crushed with the war.  There is one major sex scene, and a movie filled with visceral and visible gunshot wounds.  This is a movie that is a joy to watch, is contemporary to the times, and showcases what our society today too often ignores: Heroes.

STUDY GUIDE - Some questions to think about while watching...

1. Humanity: Stalingrad, with its torn buildings, dismal skyscapes, and eternal battles of gunfire, is almost more important than the sniper Vassily, the main protagonist.  What does the landscape of the city tell you about the passions of men?
2. Implications: This film tries to pay credence to both the Russians and the Germans, while trying to play at their faults as well.  It appears, however, that the film is still in favor of the Allies, from the distasteful humor in Major Konig toward his work, the ominous rows of sleek black German battle tanks, and the hopeful dancing of the Russian soldiers who knew they were to die.  How does this movie paint the German personality?  Do you think it is a valid statement?
3. Evolution: Cinema has seen many, many WWII films.  From the blood and dust of Saving Private Ryan, to the practical jokes and youthfulness of The Great Escape, WWII films showcase a museum of human feelings regarding the Second Great War.  Where does Enemy at the Gates fit into this grand tradition?  How does it compare?
4. Realism: It's obvious the film tries to be realistic.  The bloody battles and lost friends and gloomy atmosphere only emphasize and accent this theme.  Yet there is a certain glee in the gun-battles, as if it were a video-game being played out.  This is perceived in the cycling of snarpshooters beside Vassily the inevitable conflict between Vassily and Konig, the kill count papers, and the soap-opera love triangle between Danilov, Vassily, and Tanya.  Do these elements become shortcomings, or do they flourish the film in its cinematic quest?
5. Stageplay: One of the first surprises of the film is that the Russian actors have British accents, while the Germans have German accents and speak English.  How does this affect the atmosphere of the film?",1090195200,3,2508,4.863529411764706
1276695,4,B00003CXRA,"For those who might think I only review things I'm wildly enthusiastic about, I have to rate this DVD a 4.  Why?  It is in English.
When it comes out in German, or Russian, with English subtitles, I may offer a different opinion.  However, all I know about the Battle of Stalingrad, which I won't pit against a professional historian, suggests that some of the themes dealt with in this movie, cannot be dealt with in English.
To wit, I include:
1.  What it meant to be a Jew in Stalin's Wartime Soviet Union. No matter how beatiful the Jewess, she should be heard in Russian.
2.  No matter how evil, no matter how great the actor, a German major top sniper should speak German.  I think Ed Harris is among our greatest actors.  He does a magnificent job here, even hanging the young Russian boy who has acted as a double agent, appearing to be sympathetic to the German sniper sent to eliminated the great Soviet hero.
3.  Stalingrad was more than mud.  This movie somehow bypasses the absolute worst period of the Battle of Stalingrad.  See the German film of 1992, titled, ""Stalingrad.""  The winter defeated the Germans, not the Russians.  This movie bypasses the period from November, 1942 to February, 1943, when General Paulus' Army surrenders. In addition, the position and personager of General Paulus, who committed high treason by surrendering, is given rather short shrift here.
4.  This is just NOT a great battle or historical film.  The known actors have not invalidated that.  It is all just too ""easy"" (such as the Major ""hearing"" the snipers approaching a known pathway through pipes in a nearly silent factory, at a time when there could nearly have been no such silence.  In addition, the impression is given that German fighters followed the Major as he stalked the heralded Soviet sniper, and to my knowledge, ther is no evidence this happened.  Those sequences simply are too ""computer graphic.""
5.  War is a great backdrop for a love story, but Stalingrad was no love story. I refer the reader back to the German film, Stalingrad.  Whether historically accurate or not, this simply is too romanticized a version of a Jewish woman falling in love with a Ukranian peasant, spurning her ""true"" beloved, the Jewish political officer.  The ending of the film Stalingrad, in which the surviving ""whore"" of of the German officers is killed trying to save surviving Germans, is more believable.
6.  Convenience.  Glass ""falling"" so that antagonists can see one another in deadly confrontation, went out with ""Father Knows Best.""  It decries the suspension of disbelief needed to be impressed by such a confrontation.
7.  So, I suggest, see this film, but understand its weaknesses before you invest precious time.  Otherwise, I recommend ""Stalingrad"" (the German film), which is worth seeing, even if you are multitasking.
8.  It is never as simple as, ""shoot soldiers to get them to fight"" or ""give them hope"" or ""give them a reason"" (see Gettysburg, to wit).  Here, we're led to believe that Khruschev was easily enticed from one philosophy to another.  I doubt it greatly.
Get it?  I hope so.

1276696,2,B00003CXRA,"It's amazing how you can see a full-production, serious Hollywood film about World War II and not have it be about pain, nationalism, classism, xenophobia, primitive regression, freedom, social control-you know, the things war is about-but instead have it just be about a guy getting laid, his friend's envy over the fact, and the near (naturally near) loss of his betrothed to circumstances beyond his control. WWII...American high school...is this a disturbing mix up, or is it just me? (I'm not sure of the reasons for the conflation, but I suspect it might be because audiences really don't want a film about complicated issues and that film makers, with deadlines in one pile and bills in another, know this. It's a well oiled war machine, the film industry. But now I conflate!)
Jude Law plays super sniper and Soviet national hero Vassili Zaitsev and is amazing as always. Somehow I can loath a movie with Law in it and still like him and his character. In EATG, Zaitsev's relationships with others unfortunately become purely device driven: it's the stock Romantic Interest / Best Buddy / Arch Nemesis trio. Joseph Fiennes (Best Buddy) is Commisar Danilov, an erratic propaganda writer who becomes Vassili's biographer for the Soviet papers. As you'd half expect ahead of time, Danilov betrays his friend in the final act. But as if his motivations were never worth our time, Danilov then sacrifices his life so that Vassili can win his struggle with stone faced Ed Harris, who plays Knig (Arch Nemesis), a German Major sent by the furor to snipe the sniper. The subplot of Rachel Weisz as Tania Chernova (Romantic Interest), aside from a surprising, well acted public sex and probable deflowering scene, is so superficially presented it's hardly worth analysis.
I don't know. When I see a war flick like this-one that follows a single individual around-I always feel like I'm watching a movie about the concept of luck, and how interesting a theme can luck really make, even in a war picture? So even though (and because) it's trite to tears, it's fitting that Fiennes' final lines-just before by far the most stylized ""shot"" of many bullets to the head in this film-argue there're basic flaws in the communist dream: ""some will always be lucky...lucky in life, lucky in love."" Wow. War really makes you think, doesn't it?
It's impossible for me to give this movie any dramatic weight or credibility after a disappointing scene like that, even considering the (light) treatment of issues of intellectualism and war throughout: the refraining metaphor of the bullet to the brain; the underground library stocked with both Marx and Gethe; ever relevant questions of media, truth, and propaganda. (Most frustrating, the deconstructive fact that the obviously over embellished story is based on Soviet war literature to begin with makes the film makers seem oblivious to their own subject matter.)All this must have felt like representing the heavy tomes of 1940s Eurasian bloodshed over conquest and racism with a tangible moment for script writers Alain Godard and Jean-Jacques Annaud. But when the political struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie gets cast as little more than a booty call, the effect only seems unintentionally comedic.",1083888000,2,3258,5.068901303538175
1276740,2,B00003CXRA,"I suppose I'm churlish for not liking this movie.  Not having seen ads or reviews and not having read the book, I was misled by the opening sequences into thinking that this was a movie about the battle of Stalingrad.  The opening sequences are very effective and impressively nightmarish in showing that ""war is hell,"" a message one can't hear too often.
Then it all goes dreadfully wrong, as the viewer is expected to be interested in a farfetched cat-and-mouse game between two snipers.  This is such small potatoes compared to the start of the movie that I turned it off in disgust.  As with virtually all ""hit man"" movies, I quickly lose interest in ""who kills who?"" as the body count increases.  But I guess if you liked Pulp Fiction, you may like this.",1082937600,2,759,4.592592592592593

This is easily better then platoon and o so many others.
The basic plot is about a man who is in the soviet army. The beginning is very graphic showing how russians were forced to charge the enemies at all cost very sad begining then you get to see the main character show his sniper skills where he snipes 5 nazis he goes on to becoming a full time sniper sniping many nazi officers. germany decided to send there highly trained veteran sniper to kill the russian sniper
so it becomes a war between to countries and a fight between two men.
It might sound a little cheesy but i assure you its not i widely suggest you buy it or atleast see it. if you would like to know a little bit about me and what other movies i suggest you buy go to my site on amazon and look at my dvd collection.",1082419200,,1040,4.0048076923076925
1276742,4,B00003CXRA,"This movie accomplished one thing which I especially appreciate: it dispelled the ridiculous prejudice against snipers.  Snipers take out targets of value (usually officers) at long range, potentially deciding battles with fewer casualties among the ""grunts"" than would occur in an assault.  That being said, I found myself identifying with both snipers in this movie.  The German was, of course, not a communist, and any communist he sent to the hereafter made the world a better place, but Jude Law's character was not really a communist either.  He was simply an ordinary person used as a tool by the most prolific murderer in human history: Stalin.  He was just doing his bit for ""Mother Russia"".  So we have two basically good human beings plying their trade against each other, in the service of two monsters.  In the final analysis, when it's Nazi v. Commie, whom do you root for?  Logic says neither, which calls into question why our country sent so much aid to the Commies, but that's another topic.",1081728000,2,1009,4.894117647058824
1276743,1,B00003CXRA,"Enemy at the Gates ia a great book about the Staligrad campaign.  However, it is a bad movie.  The film is filled with inacuracies that misslead the audiance about what actually happened.  It is also plagued by being anti-communist propaganda, rather than good story telling.
Where they got it wrong.
1.  Vasily Zeitzev arrived at Stalingrad as a fully trained sniper.
2.  Tania Chernova was a partisan and later a sniper, not a translator.  Let her be the woman she was not a week female, but rather an expert sniper in her own right.  She personally killed 81 germans before being wounded.
3. Tania was Vasily's lover, but they did not get back together after the war, because both believed that the other was dead.
4.  Ron Pearlman's character lived through the war.
5.  Vasily shot Keonig without leaving his hiding place.
Danolov was wounded when he tried to point out Koenig's position to Vasily, not killed.
The Russians were not idiots, they knew how to fight and made the Germans bleed at Stalingrad.
5.  The Stalingrad campaign involved millions of soldiers and did not hinge on the fate a duel between two.
There is a great story in the tale of this sniper duel.  It did not need to be falsified to keep women in their place or to show that the Russians were fools...
If you want a riviting story read the book.
If you want good history read the book.
Skip  the movie.  :(",1081382400,12,1383,4.550607287449393
1276744,4,B00003CXRA,"Enemy at the Gates is a fine war film, despite a few critical flaws which could've made a bit better.  Director Jean-Jacques Annuad creates an elaborate and perfect atmosphere for this film, which takes place during World War II.  The film is based on a unique true story.
  It's 1942, World War II rages on, the fate of the world is being decided in a city on the Volga River, Stalingrad.  Jude Law plays Vasseli Zeitsev, a very skilled Russian sniper.  Jospeh Fiennes plays his friend, and is a Russian journalist who writes stories of Vasseli's victories and makes him more known to the public.  Ed Harris plays Major Konig, a German sniper who is sent to kill Vasseli and save Hilter from more humiliation.  Rachel Weisz plays the love interest of Law's character, for there's also a little love story involved in this war epic.  The film works better as a suspense thriller than a war film, but it indeed is great for its intensity.  Of course Saving Private Ryan remains the best or one of the best war films still and probably will continue to be.
  Enemy at the Gates performed decently at the box-office for some critics really did bash it.  They said there more than enough inaccuracies especially with the accents, which I have to say is true, the Russians have British accents, while the Germans or atleast Ed Harris's character has an Ameerican accent.
  Enemy at the Gates is rated R for Strong Graphic War Violence and Some Sexuality.  The violence is reasonably bloody, after all it's a war film and deals with sharpshooters.
The violence includes battle sequences and substantial gun violence, most of which is bloody.  There is hardly any profanity.  As for the sexual content, there's an explict sex scence which was really quite gratuitous and some other sexual innuendo.  No nudity.
  Gates is good, but it still seems to be lacking and it certainly could've had some improvements to make it a great deal better.",1076716800,,1933,4.727544910179641
1276745,4,B00003CXRA,"""Enemy at the Gates"" was quite interesting. It was about the Germans attacking and trying to take over the Russian City of Stalingrad during World War II (WWII). I had no idea the German army had gotten that far into Russia before. But then again I didn't immerse myself in studying WW II either. I'm not sure just how much of the story line was based on fact but if most of it was true then I am totally amazed.
The opening scenes were brutal and reminded me of the first half-hour of ""Saving Private Ryan"". They showed the Russians coming off a train. Every other soldier in line was handed a rifle; the next person in line was handed the ammunition. They were told if the person in front of you gets killed, grab the rifle and go on yourself. As they crossed the river to attack the enemy and defend their homeland they were virtually massacred. If the Germans didn't kill them, their own officers were shooting them calling them cowards. One man, Vassily Zaitzev portrayed by Jude Law, came to the aid of another, Joseph Fiennes character Danilov. The way Vassily fired his weapon was certainly what made the story. He soon became a member of a sniper crew.
Thanks to Danilov his name and face was in the papers. His superiors made a big thing out of him. The country needed a hero and he was to be it. It wasn't long before the Germans sent in their top sniper, Major Konig played by Ed Harris, to try to locate this now famous Russian. The movie then went back and forth between the two men and what they were doing.
The film was suspenseful. It had action, combat scenes, intrigue, heroes, villains, and a little romance. The ending left me bewildered but I'm not going to ruin it for you. This film was well worth watching.",1075334400,3,1731,4.4125
1276746,4,B00003CXRA,"Understanding history is always dicey when using any cinematic production as a guide, however, after viewing ""Enemy at the Gates"", it is no great stretch to understand why the Russian people felt such an intense animus for would-be German occupiers during WW11.  Roiling within the brutal warfare that engulfed Stalingrad was a more personal conflict that is the subject of this highly entertaining movie. Two exceptional men, one a common shepherd from the Urals, the other a well-born officer fighting for the cause of Hitler.  Both were gifted sharpshooters. This is an utterly facinating look into the world of snipers and the psychology that motivates them. Jude Law was Vassili Saitsev, a real life hero in the battle for Stalingrad and was portrayed by Law as a simple soldier engaged in an intense and deadly life and death duel with Major Konig (Ed Harris). Both Law and Harris have deep penetrating eyes that served well in emphasizing a deadly job behind the scope of a high powered rifle. In an area of specialized warfare where no margin for error exists, it takes a special type of person who can sit motionless for hours or even days waiting for the right moment to squeeze the trigger. This epic movie is very well done, the special effects are detailed and breathtaking and used only to support the film, not drive it like some of the demographically motivated drivel that all too frequently dominates a domestic Hollywood production. The supporting roles were well cast and rounded out ably enough.  Bob Hoskins was quite believable in portraying the dogged menace of a wartime Nikita Khrushchev. Lovely Rachel Weisz (The Mummy) and gifted actor Joseph Fiennes (Shakespeare in Love) fleshed out the cast in their supporting roles as Russian soldiers driven to protect the homeland.  Highly entertaining.",1073174400,2,1821,5.0198675496688745
1276747,5,B00003CXRA,"I usually don't write reviews on films, but the Enemy at the Gates is a good exception to the rule. It is about the battle of Stalingrad (russian for the city of Stalin), one of the fiercest and cruelest battles of human history, where dozens of thousands of people were killed and which culminated with the nazi loss of face, defeat and winter retreat of its troops trough the Russian prairie, a sour pill gulped down before by Napoleon and his army.
 War is in itself the theatre of antipodal human sentiments of Love & Hate, Elation in victory versus Frustation in defeat, Magnanimity of the conqueror and Cowardice of the conquered and the film provides a lot of such stuff . It is also a ""decipher or I will devour you"", a Greek play of human sentiments magistrally transported to the wide-screen by the renowned French director, a game of chess between two of the best snipers of the nazi and Soviet army, who fight one each other till one prevails. But many die before this happens, and many love triangles are to be ruptured by envy, delation and intrigue, just to name a few of the human sentiments parading in front of you in the big screen. Politics of the time is also on display, and the defender of Stalingrad, Nikita Kruschev bets all his chips in the propaganda chessboard.
 The rationale behind each shapshooter's move is amazing, and in order to survive they have to know in advance all the steps to be taken by their opponent. Who will win in the end? The Russian or the German? See the film and you will know the surprising end. A good film to buy and to see many times. I hope you enjoy it as I did.",1070582400,2,1620,4.414715719063545
1276748,4,B00003CXRA,"As everyone else has commented in great detail, it seems superfluous to say what the film is about. An unimaginably ghastly battle of WW2 is given the best treatment visually one probably could reasonably hope to expect. The set and digital effects are stunning (even if at times they are clearly digitally-derived: mainly due to a desire to show the ""camera"" moving rather self-consciously in three dimensions in a way that does not really help in depicting reality). This has got to be the toughest thing about depicting such a terrible battle amidst the ruins of a medium-sized city. The film's plot though, unlike the best war films, is rather uninvolving and this I think is partly due to the rather over simplistic plot and the rather wooden characters. The early sniper duels are very good and involving - if only the rest had been like this. There is something slightly false about the dialogue - not altogether ringing true. Still this film really does deliver on the visual goods and this is reason alone to see it. Whilst the sets have a painterly ""composed"" look to them (a little to many ""romantic"" statues of Lenin and Stalin lying about I think) the scenes of desolate destroyed streets are impressive as are the scenes of attacks from the air. The film misses the gritty reality of ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Schindler's List"", but not by much and certainly it is way superior to say, ""The Pianist"" in this regard. A fine effort in depicting the un-depictable.",1070496000,2,1475,4.765625

1276790,3,B00003CXRA,"ENEMY AT THE GATES is the sprawling sort of war movie that lies somewhere between the reality of massacre of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and any war film with John Wayne.  The opening scenes of the battle for Stalingrad during World War II set, in their gruesome intensity, the brute nature that was the street fighting between the Nazi Wehrmacht and the Soviet Red Army.  When Stalin's political commissars send out an untrained and poorly equipped group of conscripts, the resulting slaughter, first by the Germans, then by the commissars for desertion and cowardice, well indicates the chaotic state that riddled the Soviet Army during the early war years.  The typical Red Army conscript was as likely to die from a bullet to the back as from the front.  Into this maelstrom, steps Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law), one of those conscripts who ran but had the great good fortune to run into one of those very commissars Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) who would have shot him but now welcomes him since both are cut off.  Zaitsev's sharpshooting ability impresses Danilov enough to introduce him to Senior Political Commissar Nikita Khruschev (Bob Hoskins), who promptly elevates Zaitsev to national hero status.  Up to this point, director Jean-Jacques Annaud is on firm ground as he allows Law, Fiennes, and Hoskins to bounce off each other collectively and shine singly so that each makes a series of indelible impressions.  Beginning with the introduction of Nazi Major Konig (Ed Harris), who is sent to Stalingrad to kill Zaitsev for public relations purposes, Annaud permits ENEMY AT THE GATES to march inexorably toward melodrama.  The second half devolves into a cat and mouse game between Konig and Zaitsev, with each sniper under pressure from their respective superiors to kill the other.  It would have made more cinematic sense had these two met and fought on their own without a Russian version of High Noon.  Furthering muddying the waters is a pointless love triangle between Zaitsev and a Russian interpreter Tania (Rachel Weisz), who, predictably enough is loved by Danilov as well.
Still, ENEMY AT THE GATES permits the viewer to observe at a nearly first hand level the insanity that was the carnage of Stalingrad.  If that viewer has to endure the drivel and dreck of the required Hollywood love triangle to appreciate a game of deadly tag played out on an infinitely larger scale of war, then the worth of the film is yet evident.  Not every soldier gets to make love to a beautiful woman with bullets and bombs blazing overhead.  The fact that Jude Law does this does not make this a film to miss.",1070150400,,2603,4.875283446712018
1276791,5,B00003CXRA,"Seldom is an event in history so well rendered as is the classic battle for Stalingrad during WWII in this superb film about a classic sniper's duel between a young and renowned Soviet rifleman who had become a virtual legend to both his fellow soldiers and the ragged proletariat back home, on the one hand, and an older and highly decorated Wehrmacht officer who has come to eliminate the young Soviet phenomenon for propaganda purposes. One is sucked immediately in the hopeless vortex of the battlefield, a place where senseless full frontal charges into the German positions are ordered by incompetent (and cowering) Soviet officers, and where raw youthful recruits rarely last long enough to have their own rifle to fight with. The sequences in which the vanguard is mowed down and those behind them literally leap through the mud to retrieve rifles and some ammo capture the maximum mismatch of well-trained and battle-hardened German soldiers face-off untrained and unseasoned Soviet inductees.
The cast is superb, from Jude Law, playing Vassili Zaitsev, the young Soviet sniper, to the always terrific Ed Harris, as the German major sent to find and kill Vassili, and with Bob Hoskins playing a young and courageous Nikita Krushchev, determined to turn the situation at Stalingrad around, and Rachel Weisz as a female sniper enamored of Vassili, and Joseph Fiennes, as a young Russian propaganda officer who propels Vassili into an unwanted limelight and celebrity and comes to confuse Vassili's success with his own.  As the film progresses we see again and again the ways in which the men and women caught in the murderous crossfire and struggling to survive in the ruined chaos of what was left of the once marvelous city of Stalingrad. Here death is literally just around the corner, accompanied by a scant instant of blinding sound and pain, and surviving is as much a matter of luck and placement as of skill and determination.
The denizens of the long siege of Stalingrad and the associated prosecution of the stalemated battle prosecute their efforts with ragged fatalism, and so many die from wounds or hunger or disease that death becomes a virtual constant companion for each of them, and each of the characters is transformed in some fashion by the experience. What is most amazing about the classic snipers' duel is the fact that it is all based on historical fact, and the eventual survivor of the duel goes on to live a long and satisfying life thereafter.  Given the insanity and cruelty of war, such instances are examples of the old saw that truth is sometimes stranger than fiction. This is a wonderful albeit grim and sometimes depressing movie, and one I can heartily recommend. Enjoy!",1069286400,12,2715,4.964835164835165
1276792,5,B00003CXRA,"For a 20 year old boy from Mexico the common war movies are the Rambo series and many others where the Soviet Army or Red Army are the bad boys, and you grow up with this idea. But when i read on a magazine the filming of this movie i was not expected to be one of my favourites because the story is about a young Soviet sniper who became in 9 days a national hero and the chase of his counterpart an experimented German marksman.
In first place i don't belive it was a good movie because Saving Private Ryan is (for say) the actual war epic movie but when i see it i just found a new war epic movie form a battle who was the most bloddy of all: the siege of Stalingrad. the cast include good actors like Jude Law in the play of the Hero Vassili Zaitsev and Ed Harris the role of the Major Edwig Koenig and one of the most beauties actress of this times Rachel Weisz on the role of Tania Chernova.

1276793,4,B00003CXRA,"This ia an intense and smart cat-and-mouse tale of two men - a Russian marksman played by Jude Law and a cold-hearted Nazi sniper played by Ed Harris - made heros by the necessity of war.  The script makes a smart choice by focusing on the tale of the younger Russian, including his friends (Fiennes) and loves (Weisz) to make a more sympathetic character.  By doing this and witholding the same character build-up of Mr. Harris' character (who gets due service by what the script does NOT tell us ... a good case of ""less is more"").  The intensity of the four lead performances, combined with real locations, a strong supporting cast, a strong script, a true story, and the solid directing job by Jean-Jacques Annaud makes for a very good film.  It does not reach the heights of PLATOON or THE THIN RED LINE, but it is still an awfully good movie.",1061164800,3,848,4.522875816993464
1276794,1,B00003CXRA,"A film which is meant to dramatise the battle of Stalingrad. Naturally it is hard to portray a battle of the complexity of Stalingrad do that instead we focus on two snipers one Russian and one German trying to kill each other. The Russian sniper has been built up by their propaganda as a sort of superman and is somehow vital t the war effort. The German is a cunning professional from a military school.
The film is however dreadful. One wonders why people make films which bear so little resemblance to the events they are portraying. After the disasters of the Kharkov and Kerch Penisula offensives the Russians fought the Stalingrad campaign cautiously. They held the city of Stalingrad with limited forces whist building up a huge counter attack on the plains surrounding the city. The Russians turned every building into a fortress and by staging counter attacks at night and using multi story building to negate the advantage of German tanks. The film however portrays the Russians as dullards mounting attacks in which massed infantry rush well entrenched infantry positions. Half of the Russians are not even armed. One wonders if the film makers ever read anything about the actual campaign or the mechanics of the fighting.
The film is also anti communist, but the message of anti communism is at the intellectual level of a Marvel Comic book. Characters declaim how they once believed in setting up a classless society but now they realise how wrong they were. There is one scene in which soldiers retreating from an unsuccessful attack are machine gunned by their own officers. Another character with metal teeth describes how his teeth were hit out by a hammer as a punishment. The message is ham fisted, unrealistic and detracts from the flow of the film.
The main character played by Jude Law is a peasant who did some shooting before the war. He develops quickly as a sniper because of his skills. It is noticeable that when stupid people write films they have problems in portraying peasants and working class people. This is no exception, Law plays his character as a sort of amiable simpleton. There is not sense that a person who is a peasant can have a sense of humour an intelligent grasp of his surroundings or even be cynical about his surroundings.
Whilst the scenes devoted to the main characters Jude Law and Ed Harris are good, the rest of the film does not rise above tedium. The film is marred by its lack of historical accuracy, its preachyness and  the cardboard nature of its characters. The only bright spot is Bob Hoskins playing Nikita Krushev as a Mafia Hood.",1057968000,10,2599,4.775555555555556
1276795,5,B00003CXRA,This is one of if no the best sniper movie I've ever seen. A little week on the storyline but makes up for it during the action sequences. I recomend this movie to sniper and war movie fans.,1057449600,,190,4.026315789473684
1276796,2,B00003CXRA,"When I first heard about ""Enemy at the Gate"", I was intensely excited: one of my favorite directors (Jean-Jacques Arnaud, who produced such brilliant, intriguing, and engaging spectacles as ""Name of the Rose"", ""The Bear"", and ""Seven Years in Tibet"") helming up a film about a sniper duel in the ruins of Stalingrad during the darkest days of World War II. Leaving aside the question of who to root for (the Nazis or the Soviets, gee, great choice), I was giddy with anticipation: after all, the Eastern Front of WWII is an overlooked genre, even though most of the carnage occurred in the clash between Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia.
The only war film to really deal with the horrific death-struggle between the totalitarian empires of Stalin and Hitler is ""Stalingrad"", Joseph Vilmaier's traumatic study of the effects of the chaotic Eastern Front on a squad of German troopers. What was most exciting about the prospect of ""Enemy at the Gate"", which deals with the same period, is the struggle between the Russian sniper Vasily Zaitzev (Jude Law) and his German counterpart and would-be assassin, Major Konig (Ed Harris). What could be better than a personal duel between two of the war's deadliest snipers, played out over the Ragnarokian fight between the war's two deadly evils?
Ah, what could have been. ""Enemy at the Gate,"" for all its excellent production value and directorial talent, stumbles badly.  Some movies should be content to snuggle into their subject and remain there, and this is one of them. ""Enemy"" fails in that it tries to do too many things, and does all of them poorly. Jude Law plays Zaitzev, a young Russian sniper who rallies the morale of the battered Russian defenders of Stalingrad by harrying the Nazis in the ruins; Ed Harris plays Konig, the German sniper sent to kill Zaitzev and spare the Fuhrer embarrassment.
Had Arnaud stuck to the intricate game of cat-and-mouse between the snipers, ""Enemy at the Gate"" could have approached sheer brilliance, and would certainly have been a classic. Lamentably, the movie throws in two other themes that eventually hobble the film: national politics (with Bob Hoskins wasted as a flatulent Nikita Krushchev), and a miserable love triangle between Zaitzev, a Russian woman adjutant (played by the ever-tasty Rachel Weisz), and a Russian officer Danilov (played blandly by the overrated Joseph Fiennes).
It is simply too much for the movie to handle well, and distracts from the real conflict between the snipers. As a result, the love-triangle feels forced and pedantic; I found myself wishing that the hopeless affair would get resolved so we could get back to the action.
When Arnaud centers on the duel between his protagonists, the movie is at its best---and in these sequences, filmed amid the smoking ruins of Stalingrad, the film delivers. But as Nietzsche said, 'one criticizes most accutely when one compares to the Ideal"", and ""Enemy at the Gate"" could have been so much better. Because Arnaud forces us to skip back and forth between the sniper duel, the romance, and the political sequences, the sniper scenes themselves suffer, seem disjointed, and ultimately the duel itself gets lost in the shuffle. Think the final conflict between Harris and Law is going to be exciting? Think again; the final duel ends lamely and awkwardly, and Harris's character behaves in a way that is so totally out of character as to be unbelievable.
There are some sensational moments in the film: the scenes of German Stukas dive-bombing Russian transports are horrific and brilliantly conceived, as are the harrowing sequences where ill-equipped Russian soldiers, unarmed, ran behind their comrades into battle, waiting for the man ahead of them to drop so they could use his weapon. Arnaud also gets the feel of bombed-out and gutted Stalingrad just right, and has made a perfect playground of death for his combatants.
But far too many things are wrong with this film; Jude Law, an excellent and disciplined actor, plays Zaitzev with quiet and deadly dignity, but he seems bursting to be allowed to act. Harris, usually a solid actor, seems awkward with his role, and delivers his lines in a stilted voice. Ron Perelman, an old alumnus from Arnaud's ""Quest for Fire"" (where he played a Cro-Magnon), seems wrong given the tone of the movie, and it is almost a relief when he is shot.
Ultimately ""Enemy at the Gate"" succumbs to its flaws, and is far more frustrating that it is satisfying. The viewer thinks back to the promising opening sequence, where a young Zaitzev sights a wolf through his telescope, and wonders: ah, if only the director could have let us see the war through the eyes of the two 'wolves' and their telescopes, what a satisfying film ""Enemy"" might have been.",1053820800,12,4752,4.94
1276797,4,B00003CXRA,"Enemy At the Gates tells the story of the battle of Stalingrad and more specifically a duel between a Russian and German sniper.  There are several scenes which show the grand scheme of things in the battle and then it progresses to go deeper into the sniper part of the story.  The duels between the two expert snipers are excellent putting the viewer right next to the action.  The final duel is very well put together as well.  Most of these scenes are very nerve wracking as we wait for the sound of the bullet to break the silence.
 While the duel is the better part of the movie, the performances are also very good.  Jude Law is the best as Vasily Zaitsev, the famous Russian sniper.  Ed Harris is his rival as the German major Konig, the sniper brought in to kill Vasily.  Joseph Fiennes is also very good as the writer who makes Vasily famous by publishing stories about his exploits.  Rachel Weissz plays Tanya, the love interest which was okay in the story but probably could have been left out.  There are very graphic scenes of battle and also one scene with a ""sexual situation"" so beware.  Excellent musical score by James Horner which adds to the mood of the duels.  DVD is very good with plenty of extras for action fans.

1276798,4,B00003CXRA,"Enemy at the Gates is a very good movie.  It is very graphic, and the ending quite frankly suprised me.  Some of the special effects leave something to be desired, that is one reason that I could not give it 5 stars, particularly when they are crossing the Volga and the Stukas attacked.  It looked pretty fake.  When they get into the City and they are bombed, the special effects improved.  Also my only other major complaint is that all of the actors spoke with English accents.  I love English Accents, and the actors and actresses are great, so that balances the Accent Problem.  I would definitely recommend this movie to any WWII fan, or any fan of War movies, which I am not, I hate war and this movie helps me appreciate the sacrifices that people make in times of it.",1052784000,,777,4.429577464788732

The problem with the movie is that it does not follow the true story of Vassili Zaitsev.  Agreed, this is a movie and the producers have the right to use artistic license, BUT, the true story of Zaitsev is even more fascinating than the movie portrays.
I would encourage the viewer to explore the history of Zaitsev and the female in the movie, Tania Chernova.  I assure you, it will amaze you!  For instance, in real life Chernova was an American, a New Yorker of Russian descent (something you will not get from the movie).

1276873,4,B00003CXRA,"This film is something of a complication. Although I did enjoy it there are many arguments. First the good points! The almost all British cast (except Ed Harris) are top-notch including Jude Law (A.1, Road To Perdition, Gattaca), Rachael Weisz (The Mummy & Mummy Returns, About A Boy), Joseph Fiennes (End Of The Affair, Shakespeare In Love), Bob Hoskins (too many to name!)...and Ed Harris (who I don't know much about really). The real shiners in the cast are Jude Law - and particularly Bob Hoskins (who was infact the only actor that even attempted a Russian accent!). Rachael Weisz and Joseph Fiennes (who was annoying - and second rate to his brother Ralph in my opinion) were wasted however. They failed to make a big impression on the film (suprisingly enough considering their calibres!). The graphics are as good as can be wished for, plot interesting and probably one of the best war films around. Due to [bad] attempts of war films such as 'Windtalkers', which really does twist history (ie - with soldiers singing to children and giving them chocolate when really they raped and pillaged) this is a masterpiece!
Ok - If you like war films in general then I suggest to watch this, or even if you like thrillers, I suggest you watch this. If however you like tacky, twisted plots (with lots of bangs), or even accurately followed historical events then this may not be for you, but nevertheless still worth watching. I'd advise any Russians to stay clear though as nobody likes to see foreign actors take the roles of their own historical 'heros' - especially when they make no attempt to keep it Russian (ie - keeping the British accents).",1047427200,4,1651,4.7560975609756095

first _ the description of the ""stupid germans"" is boring, the german soldiers as well as the russian soldiers were not stupid ! second the uniforms and medals , especially the german, they are not only partly inaccurate, the negative highlight was when ed harris/major koenig spoke about his son who was killed and handed a medal down which he said was the iron cross of his son. but it was no iron cross, it was the german war merit award ! this is a stupid mistake and i cannot forgive this , sorry for being picky !

Most people don't like staring at the bottom of the screen at subtitles. If the German point of view was not focused on as much, they probly would have had subtitles for the Germans. Language is not an issue. The story is the issue. Look at all the CLASSIC war films where English is spoken on screen to portray other nations soldiers: ""Paths Of Glory"", Kirk Douglas plays a Frenchman. ""Midway"", the Japanese speak English in the film. In ""The Train"", the French and German characters all speak English in the film. The idea is to know that they are speaking English, but that it is supposed to represent their language in the film. It dosent mean that all the characters in the film are speaking one universal language. This film is a great war film. It has epic battle scenes, and the acting is well done.

1276878,5,B00003CXRA,"A lot of folk don't get this movie. The director is dealing not so much with war, but with the creation of a propoganda icon. The film jumps back and forth between reality and myth. In essence, it's the story of the Soviets building up a myth about a heroic sniper in the ruins of Stalingrad, taking his exploits and exagerating them. One scene may be gritty realism, while another surreal myth. The opening scene is a good example of the former, while the climax, in a hushed, mist shrouded rail yard, is the ultimate expression of the latter. Yes, it's impossible to imagine a day when any part of Stalingrad was virtually bereft of sound. The director knows this and that's the whole point. Watch the film while asking yourself, ""Is this scene a view of what 'really' happened, or part of the created myth?"" A friend, with more knowledge than I in such matters, tells me that there are many, obvious references to the great Soviet director Sergei Eisenstein. If you are looking for nothing but ""reality"", I recommend _Band of Brothers_ instead. As for the romance, I'm usually very much against a slapped-together ""Hollywood"" romance, but it's well handled here and not a huge part of the story. Those who talk about it ""marring"" a large part of the film are prehaps seeing the romance as bigger than it is, hating the fact that it is there at all. Ironically, there were female snipers in Stalingrad and there has been a suggestion that the historical main character did have a romantic attachment to a female sniper. While watching, ask yourself if the romance appears in the ""realistic"" scenes or the ""mythical"" scenes...",1041206400,4,1627,4.712280701754386

1276939,4,B00003CXRA,"First off, I'm  usually a stickler for historical accuracy, either literal (Tora! Tora! Tora!), or figurative - the ""flavor"" of the times the movie deals with (Braveheart).
Enemy at the Gates is a bit in both categories. From the literal point of view, the Russians used Mosin-Nagant M-91/30 rifles and the Germans used K-98k Mausers in the movie, as they actually did, and the uniforms appeared to be pretty correct, as well. And the dirt and devastation and horrid living conditions in a destroyed city came thru loud and clear. The Soviet use of (very) expendable shock troops was also there, along with the strange-to-western-thinking importance of political indoctrination, both of which were real.
Was the often mentioned love triangle necessary to the movie? No, not really, but it did serve to show that people are still people, even under brutal living conditions, in very trying times.
Was it an accurate portrayal of the actual siege of Stalingrad? I don't know, likely not, I'd guess. How can you handle such an overwhelming historical situation in one two hour movie? BUT... was it a visually realistic, visceral look at a part of WW II that has been almost ignored by Hollywood? I'd say yes.....
I'd say it is a very good movie, overall, in kind of the same way that Red Dawn is a good movie, even tho RD is completely fictional, and Enemy is more or less factually based. Both of these movies hit you in the gut that war is dirty, and cold, and hurts.",1038355200,3,1466,4.7265625

How these people survive, fight, and love in an environment where death can come at any minute is the true focus of the film. The point is to see how heroic in the face of insurmountable odds men and women can be.
The film understates the brutality of the German forces and emphasizes the vicious discipline tatics of the Red Army. The Soviet soldiers were sent against machine guns with no weapons, no leadership, and apparently no real training.
How hero(s) arise from this is the story. Others have focused on a love triangle in this story as a cliche, but on careful examination I think something else is going on between the young boy, the German, the girl and the political officer. Watch the film and think about it.

1276942,2,B00003CXRA,"First of all, this is NOT the story of the seige of Stalingrad and never comes close to telling the story of that pivotal battle.  At best, it is a made up war-romance, comrades in-arms tale with a historical figure, Vasilly Zaitzev, at the center.
Not a bad movie, but not a very good one either.
The first 10-20 minutes of the film are pretty good.  The footage of Stukas attacking Soviet troops as they make the crossing into Stalingrad was terrific.  The film, on the whole, loses track of itself in my view and becomes a mish-mash of contrived sub-plots.  It's not nearly as bad as that god-aweful  Pearl Harbor movie with Ben Affleck but it ain't very good.
The story of the defense of Stalingrad is one of the most compelling and dramatic of the war.  This movie really tells none of that story other than to bring the Soviet war-hero/sniper Vasilly Zeitzev to the attention of people who otherwise wouldn't know who he is.  The storyline regarding the SS sniper who hunts Zeitzev in Slalingrad (Ed Harris) is more mythology than history - - there were stories and rumors about it at the time, but there's scant historical record suggesting that the Germans actually dispatched anybody to try to do Zeitzev in.
After a couple of hours of watching Jude Law's Zeitzev knocking off German officers one at a time, and gawking at the love triangle sub-plot that basically wrecks half the film, we learn as the credits start to roll that Russians win the day and beat back the Germans with absolutely no portion of the story devoted to explaining how that actually happened.  Somewhere between 1 and 2 million people died in Stalingrad in the battle that wiped out the German 6th army and pretty much made a German defeat inevitable and the movie really doesn't tell that story.  Too bad.  This could have been a great movie.",1031875200,15,1826,4.625386996904025
1276943,3,B00003CXRA,"World War II was won and lost on the Russian Front, but most Hollywood war movies pretend that it never happened. The Russians themselves are partly to blame for this, since for 40-odd years they denied Western historians access to their records; nonetheless it is a pretty glaring omission. ""Enemy at the Gates"" is only the second English-speaking movie I've ever seen on the subject, and while it is riddled with flaws, it is still a pretty entertaining flick.
In the summer of 1942, the Germans launched an all-out offensive into the oil-producing regions of southeastern Russia, the Caucuses, with the aim of choking the Red Army to death by slicing its gasoline arteries. To achieve this aim they had to advance down a narrow corridor formed by the land bridge between the Don and Volga rivers, into the Caucuses mountains, and take Grozny, near the Turkish Border. On their flank, built on the banks of the Volga, sat the big industrial city of Stalingrad. The Germans had to either take the city by storm or seal it off to prevent the Red Army from using it as a springboard to hit back at them as they moved south. For their purposes one suited as well as the other. The important thing was not to lose sight of the objective of the whole campaign: the oilfields.
Characteristically, Adolf Hitler, who had drafted the undeniably brilliant plan, did exactly that: midway through the offensive he peeled a third of his fighting strength away from the oilfield attack and threw it at Stalingrad. His reasons were partly political: it bore the name of his arch-enemy, and had a lot of prestiege, if no military, value. It was not enough to flatten the city or to neutralize it: he wanted it captured, even if this meant jeopardizing the entire meaning of the campaign he himself had engineered, and putting an elite mobile army of 300,000-odd men at risk of being annihilated in a ""rat war"" for which they were not trained or equipped.
""Enemy at the Gates"" begins midway during this fateful campaign. Although set in Stalingrad, it is not about the battle itself but a duel between snipers, German and Russian, which serves as a metaphor for the battle itself. Young Vassily Zeitsev (Jude Law) is meant to represent Russia: he's an engaging, somewhat naive peasant-boy from Siberia whose skill with a rifle, and whose friendship with an influential commisar named Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) make him a celebrity. But while Vassily is quite an able killer, he is really no more than a gifted amateur, and he knows it. Opposing him is the steely-eyed and cool-blooded Major Konig (Ed Harris), who has been brought into Stalingrad specifically to kill this nuisance, and who bears himself like a man who is the best at what he does and knows it, and knows you know it too. As the movie progresses, the struggle between the snipers becomes more and more personal, and for most of the film the two characters are presented simply as protagonist and antagonist. Law is a good choice for Zeitsev, and Bob Hoskins is hilarious as the villainous Nikita Kruschev, who tries to steal the movie by doing things like handing a defeated Red Army general a pistol and telling him to ""cut through the red tape"" but the movie belongs to Ed Harris, who turns out to have a highly personal motivation for killing Zeitsev after all. Unfortunately, the writers commit a horrible Hollywood blunder and turn him into a cartoon Nazi just before the film's climax, thus making the cardinal storytelling mistake of telling the audience what to feel rather than simply letting the action speak for itself. It is as if they suddenly realized he was not a villain but merely an antagonist, and the ... audience might be confused be seeing him as a man instead of a (Nazi)uniform. This is such foolishness it comes close to ruining the movie by itself, but ""Gates"" has just enough to recommend it despite this and other blunders, namely a by-the-numbers love-story/triangle, claustrophobic photography and jumpy editing. It could have been a classic war movie, but in the end it settles as simple entertainment. I would recommend it as a rental, but only die-hard war buffs would want to buy the DVD.",1030924800,6,4172,4.771784232365145

1276945,4,B00003CXRA,This is the story of the Nazi invasion of Stalingrad in WWII. However it is not really the siege itself that is the focus but the battle between two famous snipers. The russian sniper Vassily Zaitsev and Nazi Major Konig. I had always thought that Russia's involvement in WWII would have made for some great films and after seeing this film I'm not overly dissapointed. Historical accuracy is once again thrown out by Hollywood but the central focus in the film remains the same as that in which it was in real life; that the central character Vassily Zaitsev brings hope and inspiration to his fellow soldiers by his skill as a marksman.,1030838400,,638,4.654867256637168
1276946,2,B00003CXRA,"Based on surface look alone, Enemy at the Gates is an impressive production with excellent visuals and a high-caliber cast and crew.  Unfortunately, despite the hefty pricetag and technical merit, the film is mostly a mediocre accomplishment, and really, almost all the main cast and crew are at fault.
Gates does begin in a very promising fashion.  After the flashback pre-credits opening scene, we're thrust into the mayhem of the battle of Stalingrad, and in this seven-minute setpiece, director Jean-Jacques Annaud captures the chaos, the terror, and the outright horror of the fighting, stumbling only when he decides to let James Horner's score drown out every other sound (why is it directors these days feel the need to employ this method?) (worse yet, Horner's score in this scene sounds far too similar to John Williams' work in Schindler's List).  From there, the film narrows its focus to two central characters, the sniper Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law) and his opponent, Major Konig (Ed Harris).  The rest of the film is a game of cat-and-mouse, as well as a tacked on love story that occasionally plays in between the sniper sequences.
As far as war films go, Enemy at the Gates fails to deliver.  Once again, another film that seems to promise to show the graphic horrors and epic scale of the battle of Stalingrad merely uses it as a backdrop (the other film would be Stalingrad).  True, the sniper hunts are fairly riveting in a visceral manner, but never truly engaging because you don't feel for the protagonist.  This is mostly the script's fault, which doesn't give Jude Law the opportunity to develop into a full-fledged, three-dimensional character.  All we really learn about this guy is his lack of self-confidence, and even though he might be scared, the suspense is confined to a minimum because the outcome of the situation is never in doubt.
Ed Harris, unsurprisingly, fares much better as the villain of the picture.  Actually, despite playing the obvious bad guy, he creates a rather complex character who isn't as unfeeling and inhumane as he may initially seem.  Unfortunately, director Annaud must have been afraid we would have sympathized with him too much so he turns him into a typical monster by the end, definitely the worst move the film makes.
The love story honestly isn't of much interest.  Law and Rachel Weisz have zero romantic chemistry and every scene that focuses on these two is a complete bore.  Joseph Fiennes is on hand to be the third wheel of this supposed love triangle, but nobody else in the film seems to want him around, so why bother?
Gates is marred by all sorts of little problems.  The editing and pacing is off; for instance, one scene features a Russian sniper briefly leaving his post, then the next, he's suddenly in German hands.  We never see him get caught, we're just told so.  The sudden move from one place to another occurs often among the characters; it's rather jarring and not necessarily believable considering the snipers that are lying in wait to pick off trespassers.
The film never works as an anti-war stance, in spite of the grim tone and the bloody violence, it fails as a romance, and as a game of cat-and-mouse, you never feel the stakes to be as high as they should and you find yourself rooting for the villain because he feels more human and believable (for the majority of the running time, at least) than our so-called hero.  For all the elements I listed above, you can find more effective films that employ them with more precision and entertainment value.  Enemy at the Gates is really just a forgettable war film.

1276978,1,B00003CXRA,"A prime example of Hollywood's taste for Art Direction over script.  Sure, the city looks devastated, but all the Russians are happy-go-lucky sorts throughout.  What is supposed to be devastation comes out seeming more like ""rustic charm.""  Starvation, disease, hopelessness?  Not here, it's make-up for the ladies and dances every night!
  I'm not against a love story, but pppllleeaaassee give it more depth than a late night episode of Elimidate.  I'm tired of seeing the same ""love at first sight"" garbage.  As for the way ""they contrasted the two countries by making one sniper an aristocrat and the other a pig farmer""--ya, very moving, not since Rocky III where the Russian was training with high-tech equipment while Rocky was punching sides of beef have I been so moved by the subtle use of metaphor.
  And as for showing the ""realism"" of war?  Everytime people were gunned down they all died neatly or were wounded in that ""ouch I'm limping"" kind of way.  Odd, you'd think a bullet tearing through flesh and bone would sorta make you scream uncontrollably.  War here still looks like something you can tough your way through, when in reality it sends many of even the strongest souls whimpering into their pillow (read some Stephen Ambrose.)
  The worst offense of all though was making the entire Battle of Stalingrad about these two men.  i don't mean making the movie about them, I mean they literally made the entire battle hinge on who won the sniper's duel-yes, forget the MILLIONS who struggled and died there, it's the two with pretty eyes and strong jawlines who really matter.  It's amazing that people who thrill over the accuracy of the weapons here are willing to overlook the trivializing of the entire event.  No, you don't have to be historically accurate to the point of boredom, but you also don't have to be historically inacurate to the point of insult and stupidity.

1276979,5,B00003CXRA,"Despite its historical flaws, Enemy at the Gates is an awesome war film.  This film captures the essence of the sniper so greatly, at least in my opinion.  The waiting, the patience, the careful aiming, the camouflage.  All of it is depicted wonderfully.  Much of this is due to the fact that the cast was taught by an actual sharpshooter.  And the weaponry, wow.  I could not believe how accurately the Gewehr sniper rifle was recreated.  Everything down to the scope with its three separate lines instead of the intersecting two on most other sniper rifles.
The story begins with a senseless, suicidal charge on the Germans by the Soviets.  I was blown away by that.  The men are rushed out of trains and onto tranport ships as stukas bombed and shot at them.  You can sense the madness of Stalin even though the tory isn't truthful to history: The men are forced towards the German lines, some not even quipped with weaponry and if they retreat they are shot by their own officers.
I think the main reason people dislike this is that it doesn't center on the Stalingrad battle.  It centers on a sniper duel between Major Konig, played magnificently by Ed Harris, and the Soviet sniper hero Vasille played greatly by Jude Law.  You have the expert sniper who is bent on killing the morale booster/officer killer soviet.  The whole movie is basically a dramatic story of courage and heroics.  You have the hero, Vasille with the gift of aim and courage,and the man who makes him famous played by Joseph Fiennes.  You have a strange love triangle between Fiennes, Law, and the heroine played by Rachel Weisz.  I wouldn't really call it a triangle since Law and Weisz are the ones in love. Fiennes is the hopeless.  It not much of a romance, but it adds a bit of flavor into the plot.  As the movie comes to a close, you see that the love story was actually essential since the two friends develop a hate for each other that is eventually reconsiled.  There are many twists in the movie that make your jaw drop.  I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it, but the most unexpected things happen at moments that make the timing outrageously and surprisingly impecable.  I just love this movie.
While not entirely accurate to history, it is indeed a great war movie.  I find it laughable that people trash this film because it isn't the most accurate thing.  If people expected to see the true battle of Stalingrad, then would not the description of the movie give them some sort of hint?
All in all, if you're looking for a movie about Stalingrad that is historically accurate, don't turn to this.  Go for 'Stalingrad' with Dominique Horwitz.  If you're looing for an awesome war movie/sniper drama and don't really care about the facts, this is for you.",1027987200,4,2764,4.591836734693878

Of course, there are complaints about its historical accuracy.  As you can imagine, Hollywood is more bent on entertaining than educating. . . and as long as it doesn't grossly cross that line (i.e. Pearl Harbor) is a nice way to expose many people to the significant events of history.

1276984,5,B00003CXRA,"Enemy At The Gates is an unusual war movie and not a typical Hollywood blockbuster like Pearl Harbor. When I first saw this film in the movies, I was really... stunned by the reality of the scene, the realization of how brave the soldiers were when two had to share one weapon against an almost unbeatable enemy. That was during the beginning of the movie. I can also say that it's not really for the soft-hearted people, since there is a lot of blood - as I was saying, realistic - they're not afraid to show the deaths of men shot down. So as I was sitting in the cinema, I realized I can't run away from any horrible scene. I now own the movie and I got used to it and every time I watch it, it seems better and better, more touching every time. It is about the Russian city Stalingrad, basically the last big city which would not be defeated by Germany and Hitler, and about the way the Russian soldiers, poorly equipped and trained, have to defend the city from the enemy. One of them is Vasilij Zaitsev, who shoots so well (especially a sniper, who waits silently until the right time for shooting) that he's a menace to the German officers. So a German major is called on, to kill Zaitsev. Vasilij also befriends Danilov, who is publishing newspaper. They're great friends in the beginning. Then, they go to a family where there's a little boy Sacha, who admires Zaitsev greatly. He is regularly visiting the German major, cleaning his shoes, so he's confused because the major tries to spy on Zaitsev by asking Sacha questions and giving him chocolate - but Sacha then wants to help Zaitsev because of admiration. When Zaitsev and Danilov are at Sacha's family's house, Tanya comes in to the house. Both Zaitsev and Danilov fall for her, but Zaitsev has seen her at the train carrying him to Stalingrad, but she didn't see him. Tanya falls in love with Zaitsev then, so it sort of becomes a conflict between Zaitsev and Danilov. She also wants to fight because her parents were killed, but Danilov wants to protect her and keep her away from harm, while Zaitsev of course wants her safe but understands her desire for revenge and lets her fight. So all this is bound into the thrilling epic movie Enemy At The Gates, with times of tension and suspense as the two snipers wait for each other to appear and for the right moment to give the other one a last second of life, at times touching and moving because of the Russian spirit, the love that Tanya and Vasilij shared, the realism of the movie which is hard to portray - there is not a moment of it being unrealistic, too romantic or sappy. It is just pure harsh life of the people in Stalingrad - Russia's last hope.
If you've got some experience with war movies and you know it's your taste, you definitely won't be disappointed by this movie - it will only move you to various emotions which you will experience throughout the movie.

I have read an incredible amount of negative reviews on this movie and I can say just one thing about it - it's one of the greatest movies I have ever seen, because it is realistic - more so than in other war movies. ""Enemy At The Gates"" portrays the Russians and the Germans exactly the way they were back then in World War II.
The setting of the film is wonderful - showing Stalingrad as a city of ruins destroyed by the war and bombs. The actors are all wonderful - their intensity and psychological emotions are shown right there in their faces. I think the actors have done an excellent job on making this movie come alive and seem real - it worked! Even the romance between Tanya (Rachel Weisz) and Vassilli (Jude Law) is shown realistically. There were no sweet and sappy romantic scenes like in true Hollywood movies. These were too tough and harsh times to get really carried away with passion.
The story is definitely interesting and original as well. It depicts a duel between two excellent snipers, Konig and Zaitsev. Amidst the brutal conditions in the ruins of Stalingrad, the two snipers seek each other out all the time, making the movie full of suspense and intensity.

1277068,3,B00003CXRA,"A reasonably competent portrayal of the siege of Leningrad in the 2nd world war, by the director of 'Seven Years In Tibet' and 'Name Of The Rose'. The main protagonists are a Russian sniper Zaitsev ( Jude Law ) and a German sniper Major Konig ( Ed Harris ) who is brought in to kill Zaitsev and destroy his talismanic value to the Russians. There is a love triangle between Zaitsev, Tania ( Rachel Weitz ) and Danilov ( Joseph Fiennes ) which is also a main part of the plot.
 The action scenes and sets, with Leningrad as a bombed to destruction city of the dead are well done, but there have been so many good war films of this type eg. Cross Of Iron, Stalingrad, full Metal Jacket, that the film would have to have a stronger script and more impressive acting to really stand out from the crowd. 125 mins. long, but lacking the real epic quality of the films mentioned. More should have been done with the script to create greater empathy for the characters; Jude Law's acting ranges from very good to average, there is one particular scene where he attempts to put on an 'I'm thinking' face that is over the top. There is drama, but the film score is inadequate as it does little to create tension or excitement.
 Ed Harris gives the strongest performance in the film all steely eyes and controlled violence. The accents are interestingly inconsistent, the Germans sounding English or English with a German accent and Krushchev ( Bob Hoskins ) has a half cockney, half Russian accent. The film is worth seeing, just don't expect to be bowled over and try not to compare it with other more impressive war films, at least not until the end.

For those of you that haven't read a book about Stalingrad and what REALLY happened there, it will will be hard to understand why this film is offensive and this must be said beforehand. But facts are facts, and no matter what Hollywood's ""needs"" are when trying to score a box office hit i think it's a sacrilege to the 100s of 1000s of ppl who lost their lives in that battle to do films like this one.
  First of all, if we are to take for granted what this film shows what happened was that the Russian army was an ill-trained bunch of peasants running mindlessly into machine gun fire. Also,  while the Wermacht was roaming the city there is no Russian army to be seen defending it except for the odd sniper here or there, plus, the Russians are portrayed as an army equipped only with rifles when in reality they had some of the most advanced technology of the time both in hand weapons as well as in heavy weapons.
  The Stalingrad battle took place as much outside the city in the open steppes where 1000s of ppl died by freezing or starvation as well as inside the city where the battle was literally taking place face to face. There are accounts of German soldiers occupying the top 3 floors of a building and the Russians the bottom floors!!! All this, along with a plethora of other facts are spectacularly ABSENT from this film. But perhaps the most notable thing being absent from it is the fact that the German army was just as much in panic and despair as the Russian one could be if not more. All history accounts agree to the fact the Stalingrad was the personal hell of every German soldier, a fact also shining by its absence in this film. Even the story between the Russian and the German sniper isn't completely accurate but this is minor compared to the overall picture...
  This is not the first time Hollywood butchers history nor will it be the last. And maybe Hollywood is actually improving when one thinks of the surreal distortion of history they did recently with ""Pearl Harbor""...
  So, any positive stuff concerning this flick? Sure. Ed Harris gives his usual stunning performance. Jude Law is very good too allthough to me he hardly brought in mind a Russian, it looked more like a British soldier having a trasnfer over to the Red Army. The production (keeping in mind the overwhelming innacuracies) is incredible, and especially the depiction of the ruined city. The duel itself between the two snipers involved is superbly given and it's probably the one thing that keeps this movie going. In that sense, think of this film more as a ""war thriller"" than a war film because the real Stalingrad story was many dozens of times more brutal than this and, as i mentioned above, totally different.
  And lastly, is ths film worth watching? Yes, if you are aware WHAT it is you are watching. If you know you are watching a nicely filmed lie then yes. If not then no.",1022371200,10,2967,4.516791044776119

In Jean-Jacques Annaud's ""Enemy at the Gates"", once again, the largest war ever seen on Earth is the backdrop for a sniper duel between the German noble Major Koenig, and Hero of the Soviet Union, sniper Vasilli Zaitsev.
Many people compare ""Enemy"" to ""Saving Private Ryan"". There is no comparison as ""Saving Private Ryan"" lets the realization of war sink in with D-Day and a plot still rooted in the war going around them. ""Enemy"", centered in Stalingrad, quickly turns from a battle for the city to a battle between two snipers. Jude Law stars as Vasilli, a boy from the Urals who is gratified as a hero by Commisar Danilov, played by the overrated Joseph Fiennes. Nikita Krushchev, played by Bob Hoskins, oversees all the operations while Tania Chernova (Rachael Wiesz) stays close to Vasilli as he fights Koenig, played by Ed Harris.
The opening scene was interesting, crossing the river under fire from the Luftwaffe, but could have been less graphic. Whoever coordinated the blood spattering must have liked the neck, because we see many neck wounds, and as the boats cross, we see a boat full of blood. Isn't that a little cliched from ""Saving Private Ryan""? The one thing that got me a little dissapointed is the lack of accents. Bob Hoskins seems to be the only one to attempt Russian, while the three lead actors are all British. You hear more of their home accent then you do Russian. And Ed Harris, as the respected actor he is, does not even show a glint of German. It was very sad to see professional actors not even have it down. Where was the dialect coach?
As the movie progresses, there are moments of suspense, but nothing completely special. The movie does manage to convey the need for companionship and unity in those dark times, but in my opinion, ""Enemy at the Gates"" is not as special as a WWII film as everyone makes it out to be. The performances could have been much better, while the special effects are just right. Horner's score is the bright spot of the film, with a great suite repeated throughout.",1021075200,4,2317,4.70935960591133
1277158,3,B00003CXRA,"Enemy at the Gates embraces two frist class actors to tell a story of admiration, love and hate. Same with all war movies, we need a hero to lead the story. However, what made Enemy at the Gates a different war movie is that, the hero was made unvoluntarily. Jude Law just happened to be a the right place at the right time, spotted by Joseph Fiennes about Jude's ability and put him on the altar for worshipping, so as to boost the morale of the army against the German invasion. However, ironically, Joseph started to be jealous aginst the hero he created by his pen, and this was intensified when the girl he liked fell for Jude. His creation and attempted destruction of the hero he created, put this ""hero"" in an ever struggling position which is nothing more than a puppet to his creator. The psychological and emotional changes and state of these characters were well played by both Joseph and Jude. However, in terms of the plot, it is somehow predictable, and especially when it is love that torn two good friends apart, this has been used too much already. Should there be some new ideas about this part of the plot, the story will be much better and less predictable. The enjoyable index will also be higher.

The complete overpowering of Russian farmboys and rifleshooters by a well-oiled machinery was convincingly portrayed. Like defenseless rabbits- the scenes where German warplanes take out half the newcomers on the boat, the suicidal run of half-a-rifle per man against machineguns and tanks, the burning of Stalingrad and the scene where Fiennes' character sacrifices itself for his friend, are very penetrating. Likewise, there is no glamour about either the main character or his love interest. And theirs is a very different courtship confined by countryside habits and by the short lifespan war lent, which makes the atmosphere all the more realistic.

1277162,2,B00003CXRA,"Based on an actual incident during World War II, this could have been an excellent film. It should have focused entirely on the cat and mouse tactics employed by the German Major Konig (Ed Harris) and Soviet Vassily Zaitzev (Jude Law), both snipers trying to bring the other out into the open. However, the film constantly shifts focus between the Soviet propaganda officer (Joseph Fiennes) and female Soviet soldier (Rachel Weisz) in a ridiculous love triangle. This totally destroys the pace of the film and detracts from its main subject. By the time of the denouement there is no emotion felt. The characters, the two protagonists, are never given any real depth to lend meaning to their actions and motivations. The only emotion felt, is delivered by James Horner's score during the scenes when the two men actually do confront each other. When I think about it, the scenes with Major Konig and the young Russian boy should also have been explored much deeper. Their relationship was in an allegorical sense greater than Konig's duel with Zaitzev's.  It presented moral questions on the conduct of war, which are actually disturbing to watch. This film is an example of many lost opportunities. The DVD transfer is good and it does seem to play better on TV than in it did in the theatre.

1277165,3,B00003CXRA,"Enemy At The Gates is the story of a Russian Sniper, that is a hero to the Russians, named Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law) and how he rose from a simple grunt to Russia's best sniper. After word of his exploits spread, Germany's Third Reich dispatches German Sniper: Major Konig (Ed Harris). From the time the Major arrives the duel begins in a game of cat and mouse, that lasts the better part of two hours.
Enemy At The Gates is acted well by all of the cast. The problems begin with the suspense. In a film like this you should have great feeling of suspense, afterall it's a duel between two hihgly skilled snipers. The suspense is there but it could have been played upon more. The next problem may be the somewhat corny love story Vassili eventually has with beautiful female soldier (Rachel Weisz). This can be veiwed as corny when compared to the no-nonsense ""Saving Private Ryan"". The final problem is the lack of American influence. Russia and Germany were both our enemies at the time and Russia was until the end of the Cold War. However, in Enemy At The Gates, we our asked to cheer for the Russians, which can be a bitter pill to swallow.
Special Features include a Widescreen version enhanced for 16:9 television sets. Dolby Digital sound in three languages. A trailor, behind-the-scence featurette, cast and crew interviews and deleted scenes.
Bottom Line:
Enemy At The Gates is a good film. It hits the mark but it's kind of hard to want Russia to win a war. I still enjoyed this film. Eventually, you look beyond Communism and see that Vassili is a human and you want him to kill Major Konig, even though he is a person as well. I guess Paramount knew we probably like the Communists more then the Nazis. Case in point Enemy At The Gates is a good war film, with subtle sub-plots, that are guranteed to make you root for Vassili, even though you may not like the Russians at the time. I would recommend this film to anyone who liked ""Saving Private Ryan"", because this is the Russian version of the underdog heroes.",1018656000,,2028,4.528610354223433
1277204,5,B00003CXRA,"""Enemy at the Gates"" (2001)
I first heard about this movie on Box Office America ages and ages ago. I thought it looked really good. Unfortunately this movie didn't get the best reviews in town, so I decided to rent it on video. I've just finished watching this amazing film, and I thought it was a shame that it was so underrated.
This is one of the best war movies I have I ever seen. Its stunningly atmospheric and moody, with excellent and taut direction, a fabulous cast with kicks for giving believable performances, a story and script that portrays war in its coldest hour, and some very developed and interesting characters that kept me captivated the entire time.
Enemy at the Gates is a big winner because it shows the true harsh reality of war. Unlike the also 2001 released Behind Enemy Lines which is merely an entertaining fun movie with a bit of a war idea going on somewhere in the story, Enemy at the Gates really does shock the audience when they take them behind the enemy lines. The movie shows what lengths people will go to if it results in winning war and triumph. It also shows what really happens in war, the back-stories, the leg losing, the blood-splattering, and the city-destroying, real and raw world of war. Because of this the movie is definitely not for the faint-hearted, and I even felt a little queasy after the stunning opening sequence.
The star-studded cast features Oscar nominee Jude Law, Joseph Fiennes, Ed Harris, Rachel Weisz and Bob Hoskins in the leading role. Law is a sensitive and compassionate hero, Harris is a cunning and creepy villain, Weisz (fresh from the success of The Mummy Returns) is a beautiful and heroic leading lass, and Hoskins we don't really see that much of, but he does well with what small role he has. Fiennes is the real star power here. I also thought he was terribly underrated for his performance in Shakespeare in Love, and he proves yet again that he is quietly one of the most brilliant actors of his generation. Fiennes pulls of a real winner especially in this case, displaying a character who is jealous yet friendly, longing but also fulfilled. His character is merely a supporting role, but he is the character I felt most drawn to.
The special effects in this movie could beat Saving Private Ryan in its own game. After an authentic and scary opening sequence, the movie continues to get more and more violent, and more and more attractively moody. The special effects aren't quite as spectacular as Pearl Harbour or The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, but they do display a small kind of blockbuster excellence in appearance, which we don't get much these days.
Enemy at the Gates will probably be on my top 15, if not 10, of the year 2001. It is presented with a cold, raw and real atmosphere, gives us characters to care about and sympathise with, special effects to wow about, direction to go completely nuts about (well done, Jean-Jacques Annaud!) and overall is one of the more clever war films I've seen. Highly recommended for people who can stomach what war really was.

1277205,5,B00003CXRA,"If you like war movies and history, then go after a stunning visual rendition of the Battle for Stalingrad. With the background of that immense tragedy, a personal confrontation between two snipers, a russian and a german, unfolds in the sieged city. The russian sniper depicted (Zaitsev)really existed, and russian sniper warfare was very important psichologically in Stalingrad, to undermine the enemy's will to fight. It also provided the russians with enough propaganda material to raise the morale of their soldiers, through the divulgation of the stories of the hero snipers of Stalingrad in the whole Army (This battle was the turning point for the war on the eastern front). The movie has very good photography and realistic settings and the plot deals with the struggle between evil and good, the exploitation of the ingenuity of the russian sniper for political purposes, and the extreme deprivation that the combatants had to endure during this battle. Certainly as gripping as Das Boot.",1018137600,2,998,5.204968944099379

1277207,3,B00003CXRA,"When this film works, it's a nail-biting triumph.  When it doesn't, it's a languid bore.  Enemy at the Gates is a strange mixture of absolutely tip-top confrontation scenes (based around the duel of two snipers) and ho-hum melodrama, hurt by shallow characters and thin relationships.
The first four scenes of the film illustrate this film's main weakness, which is pacing.  We are introduced to our main character, a naturally gifted marksman, only fleetingly, and his ensuing friendship with a propaganda officer is (on which hangs the whole story) is so flimsy that when one begins to betray the other, it's hardly worth your attention.  Same for its central romance, at least in the beginning.  Here, however, at least the  charms of both lead players (Jude Law and Rachel Weisz) are such that the relationship finally awakens...too late into the movie, but still very much necessary.  Not so the attraction of the propaganda officer (Joseph Fiennes) to Weisz' character, which remains in the ""she's beautiful, I like her"" zone.  The script never gives them any moments where we can see his attraction for her mounting, so we're relegated to that first scene where she walks in and both men are enraptured with her looks.  Pretty shallow foundation for a love triangle.
It's a shame that as a whole Enemy at the Gates doesn't work all that well, because some of its individual sequences are really terrific.  The first time we come across German rival sniper Maj. Koenig (Ed Harris, eternally sublime especially when playing sympathetic villains), the tension is so well built up that it's almost unbearable to watch.  Weisz and Law's love scene is sensitively handled, painfully intimate, director Jean-Jacques Annaud thankfully dispensing with James Horner's overused score at this point to let the characters breathe.  And the setting of this scene creates much sexual tension, even though not much is shown.  Maj. Koenig's scenes with ""Sacha"" (a Russian child who may or may not be a traitor) are also great, economical but illuminating.  These scenes are eminently memorable in my head, while my impression on the overall plot and character relationships remains fuzzy, at best.
The rewards of those great sniper scenes are worth the weak spots in between, so I'd still say this film is worth checking out.  It could've paid more attention to giving its characters clearer personalities -- that is definitely a script problem -- but still enjoyable despite its flaws.",1017532800,,2476,5.079012345679012

The idea of presenting a more intimate angle of the battle by making it a game of cat and mouse between two snipers with a personal war of eyes is awesome, and the viewer is exposed to a series of sniper techniques that alone are worth the whole movie. Even romance is presented in a very original way and is not disconnected from the rest of the plot. Finally, there is an excellent moral message on the failure of the Marxist ideology, given at the end by the Russian Danilov: ""There is no new man. There's only man.

1277210,2,B00003CXRA,"There is a certain kind of war epic that I am uncomfortable reviewing. Enemy at the Gates is one of these. If it were a court case and I were a judge, I could excuse myself. Since it isn't, I'll give it my best shot.
If you look at the movies made prior to W.W.II, you won't find many war movies. Most of those that were made viewed war as either savage, pointless, or, at best, a necessary evil. Gone WIth the Wind is the most famous example. During W.W.II, Hollywood cranked out hundreds of war- themed films. This was only natural and was intended to boost both moral and patriotism. Despite how sanitized and unrealistic most of these were, I can appreciate how necessary they were and how they serve today as a vital record of the social structure of the time.
W.W.II is still a valid and interesting theme, one which in recent years has inspired several brilliant movies, including Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List and Life is Beautiful. Enemy at the Gates, however, in no way deserves to be compared with them. It taked a script structured basically like the war movies of the 1940s and 1950s, then adds in all the graphic 'realism' that modern technology allows. They must have ordered fake blood by the ton. That the results are expected to pass as entertainment suggests that all social changes over the decades are not positive ones.
The movie takes place during the siege at Stalingrad, USSR in the winter of 1942. This battle was at least as decisive as the Normandy Invasion [D-day]. It took a lot longer and the toll on civilians, as well as the military, was much higher. Because it involved mainly Russians and Germans, it is not that well known in America.
For a time, it looked as though the Russians would be resoundingly defeated. One day they learned that a soldier named Vasili Zaitsey {Jude Law] was a great marksman. They transferred him to the sniper division where he killed scores of German soldiers and officers. The Russian publicity machine made him a hero, and his efforts may have played a role in turning the tide against the Germans. The Germans finally resorted to bringing in their best sniper, an aristocratic officer, Maj. Erwin Lonig [Ed Harris]. An elaborate game of cat and mouse followed. This part of the story is true. What is not true is a love triangle between Zaitsey, a fellow officer [Rachael Weisz] and Commissar Danilov [Joseph Fiennes]. There was a similar triangle in this year's Pearl Harbor, and I guess the thinking is that, if worked for Titanic, it'll work in any expensive historical epic.
The cast is good, but as I watched, I couldn't help thinking about the really great movies they have acted in. Titles like Shakespeare in Love, Elizabeth and Apollo 13 came to mind. Almost all of the characters speak with an upper-class English accent. This somehow sounded most unrealistic, as if members of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art had decided to do a play about the Battle of Stalingrad.

Without the native language spoken the film's credibility is compromised from the start but Americans hate reading subtitles. Obviously the authors of this boring bomb-dud weren't at all that well read.

Jokes aside, this one is a good if not flawless war movie. The producers call it mystery-thriller. I still call it war movie, since there is no mystery in who is who in this one.
But what in Heavens, has this movie to do with the Battle at Stalingrad?
Stalingrad is just a poor excuse to rehash the war genre.
Even though the story bases itself on historic figures, it is rather superficial in scope.
What really bothered me though, was this very pronounced British accent in Russian uniforms! And Hoskins as Kruschchev is simply ridiculous! Especially when he tries to emulate a Russian accent with Cockney undertones. What is London? A suburb of Stalingrad?
I appreciate his immense effort, but still he does not possess the stamina to play the, much younger then, and more energetic Nikita Kruschchev (I can see him as Beria anytime...).
Acting in general, is good but could be far more greater.
The only one who really stands out this time is Ed Harris.
He does a magnificent job as a German expert sniper with a casual fatality about the job he has to accomplish (those who are about to die, salute you...).
Annaud is not really at his best in this one.
Although Stalingrad has been reproduced quite well, Annaud simply makes it an action shooting movie, adding here and there some pathos to help the actors involved getting along with the plot...
If you want to watch truly impressive movies about the battle of Stalingrad, then rent or buy the 1992 released ""Stalingrad"" or even better, the 1949 russian movie ""The battle at Stalingrad"".
Both will tell you a lot more about the horrors of war and the mistakes of the Wehrmacht in misjudging its own capabilities, than this wimpy and seemingly intellectual film...
Sorry, Jean-Jacques, try harder next time. In the meanwhile, try to enjoy other movies, especially those mentioned before, as well as a German movie on the same subject, called ""Hunde, wollt Ihr Ewig leben?"" (Stalingrad: Dogs, Do You Want to Live Forever?), or the story of the battle, viewed from the German side, with no frills, nor love story. Just the crude reality.",1015286400,2,2125,4.745945945945946

Like their counterparts in the West (there was an American sniper against the best that the Germans could muster), these snipers duel against each other until one pervails. And this is where the suspense really comes in. The setting is very interesting and there is a short commentary on how the movie was created at the end of the video that is truly worth the viewing.
The choice of actors is really superb with Jude Law playing the part of the Russian sniper Vassili Zaitsev, and Ed Harris as the German sniper. The romance between Vassili and a woman - played by Rachel Weisz -  also employed as a sniper, is somewhat lacking and unconvincing. Russian women in uniform really were not that glamorous.

1277264,5,B00003CXRA,"I have watched this movie four times, and have read the reviews here on Amazon three times.  I am now compelled to write mine...
First of all, let me start by saying that there are better books on the battle of Stalingrad (I have close to a dozen at arm's reach) and there are better movies about the battle.  However, if you look in an 'average' person's library, you might find one or maybe two of these books, and probably none of the movies.

I give this movie five stars because it is Hollywood's attempt to show the bravery and sacrifice of the brave soldiers who lived, fought, and died in the cold and bloody battles for a city which no longer even bears the same name!
Yes, I'll be the first one to point out that there were a number of small flaws in the movie.  How about the last frame of the movie, which mentions that ""Several times decorated with the Order of Lenin...""  His actual ""medal tally"" was as follows: Gold Star of the Hero of the Soviet Union (awarded for killing 225 German soldiers and officers from 10 October to 17 December 1942 in Stalingrad) the Order of Lenin, two Orders of the Red Banner and the Order of the Patriotic War 1st Class.
Additionally, they neglected to mention that he actually did become a factory supervisor after the War, as he mentions as his goal in the movie.
I have read numerous complaints about the movie here in the reviews.  Let's remember though- this is a MOVIE.  It's not a documentary, meant to be 100% 'actual and factual'.  Watch the History Channel if you want that.  In regards to how it compares to the book, let me say this- try adding every detail and/or plot twist of a book into a movie.  You simply can't do that, unless you want your audiences to watch a seven, eight, or nine-hour movie (and you go bankrupt in filming it!)
Yes, I'll agree with some of the reviews that Ed Harris was a bit too stiff and colorless, even for a 'stiff' German officer. He attempted to make his character sinister and evil through his cold and colorless portrayal, and that is what it became- cold and colorless acting.
Additionally, a note on ""Russians"" with British accents, as mentioned by another reviewer.  Yes, they did have some heavy Brit accents.  However, having lived in Russia for nearly two years as an English teacher, one comes to realize that most Russians who learn English in school learn ""British"", and I have known many Russians with impeccable ""British"" English.

Finally, yes, ""love"" did exist during the War.  Two feet away from me, I have the medals belonging to a Captain (male) and a Sergeant (female) who fought together (in the same unit) through Stalingrad, Warsaw and Berlin, and were married during occupation duty in Germany! It did happen...
Is the movie better or equal to SPR?  Yes and No- they are different movies, filmed about different events, two years and several thousand miles apart.  SPR is definately bloodier, and even though I believe it is one of the best war movies ever made, I have no intention of watching it for a third time (though I think it should be manditory viewing at least once!) In my honest opinion, I believe that the movies are on par with one another, with EAG being much more watchable.

One can nit-pick this movie (and any movie, for that matter) to death, but based on the fact that, for the first time, Hollywood is actually acknowledging the War that happened on the OTHER side of the world, and gave it their best shot, it deserves a five-star rating.
The impression that this movie leaves you with is the right one- the War on the Eastern Front was bloody and brutal, and many, many brave men and women (both in and out of uniform) died defending their country's interests. One can only have the utmost respect and admiration of anyone who survived these terrible battles.
Next time you see a veteran of one of these battles walking down the street, thank them for everything they did, to spare the majority of us from ever having to experience these horrible events.
Until then, grab some popcorn, toss in the movie, and enjoy!",1014336000,13,4057,4.558459422283356
1277265,3,B00003CXRA,"Obiously the objective of Hollywood is to entertain - not to teach history; however I genuinely feel this film does a disservice to the history of Stalingrad and especially to the women who fought for Russia.  From reading numerous text on the fighting on the Eastern Front I can tell you most assuredly that the Russian infantry assault tactics in the Stalingrad did not involve mass charges across open squares.  The Russians were expert at street fighting and outfought the Germans using innovative tactics that the Germans never successfully countered.  For example, to overcome the German artillery and air superiority the Russians ""hugged the Germans close"", with the front line being separate rooms in the same building.  The Russians also developed tactics such as special 10 man assault squads equipped with automatic weapons, blowing mouse holes between buildings for unexposed movement, sending troops in the sewers to inflitrate behind the Germans, etc.  As far as women were concerned, the Russians had special sniper schools for women and in fact several women won the highest award of the Hero of the Soviet Union.  Also women served in the anti-aircraft units, artillery, and even as tankist.  In this movie the female lead is nothing but a sex symbol and a distraction to the main plot.  In additon, the role of the commisar is a silly and unbelievable caricature.  Even the fighting scenes were ho hum.  If you want to see a more realistic movie on the fighting in Stalingrad, I highly recommend the 1991 German film ""Stalingrad"" with English subtitles.  I much anticipated ""Enemy"" and was sorely dissapointed.",1013385600,6,1628,5.082706766917293

The two dueled for days in the rubbles of Stalingrad until one day, the German killed an overly-enthusiastic political commissar at the side of Zaitzev.  But in the process Zaitzev caught a glint off the German's sniperscope.  He killed the German with one shot.
Those are the historical facts.  What happened in the movie is creative license.  Contrary to the claims of some reviewers, this movie is not a ""chick flick"" in the guise of a war movie.  If anything, the romantic triangle between Jude Law, Joseph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz is underdeveloped, and seems oddly detached from the rest of the action.  There are some dramatic (read gruesome) battle sequences in the tradition of SPR, and the film does give a flavor of the brutality of the Eastern Front, although as some have pointed out, it is NOT a historically accurate depiction of the Battle of Stalingrad per se.
Mostly, this is a movie about the personal duel between 2 soldiers, played with admirable nuances by Jude Law and Ed Harris.  The grand ideological conflict behind the war does not matter here.  The bombs raining overhead merely set the stage for a contest of skills and will between 2 reluctant warriors, neither of whom takes pleasure in the prospect of killing, but both equally determined to perform his duties.  I was strangely reminded of Heat as I watched the film.  And in many ways, although the setting cannot be more different, this film is closer in spirit to the classic cop-and-gangster cat-and-mouse thriller than most war movies.
A very well done and entertaining film.  Although I think the film left a great deal unexplored with regards to the psychology of the protagonists, and the ending was too saccharine to be believable.  This weakness in the writing is what kept the film from being a 5-star masterpiece.",1013299200,7,1981,4.788235294117647
1277267,1,B00003CXRA,"I was very disappointed with the movie ""Enemy at the Gates.""  I believe my disappointment is based on the fact that I enjoyed the book very much, and the way the producer/director chose to change charater motivations in the movie ruined a very well-written story.
I am often disappointed when a book I thoroughly enjoy is made into a movie; I have once more learned my lesson and will leave movie watching to those who lack good reading abilities",1011830400,6,446,4.6455696202531644
1277268,4,B00003CXRA,"The movie centers upon German invasion of Stalingrad. I found myself shocked at the frightening treatment of the Soviet soldiers. As the poorly-trained Soviet soldiers are sent into battle, only one man in each pair is allowed a gun- the other bullets. We watch in disbelief as the men are shot down, most of them, unarmed. The camera angles are unbelieveable as you feel you are within the movie.
Here, we are introduced to Vassily Zaitzer(Jude Law) A skilled sharp-shooter whose ability is recognized by a war reporter, Danilov. (Joseph Fiennes) As Zaitzer picks off nearby officers from his hiding place beneath the dead bodies of his fellow soldiers, Danilov discovers the one person who may heighten the hopes of the Soviet people.
Thus, we follow Zaitzer as he picks off the top officers one by one, Danilov, publishing his friend's accomplishments. But love is introduced when a young woman soldier is introduced. (Rachel Weisz) Zaitzer as well as Danilov are taken with this woman and so starts the subtle conflict between the two men.
Elsewhere, the German government has gotten word of the Soviet sniper and sends in their top man-Major Konig,(Ed Harris) to take out Zaitzer.
I don't believe this movie will become a war epic but I do feel it gives in excellent depiction of the struggle of WWII and of the memorable battle of Stalingrad. It is very believable and very thought provoking.
I gave this movie only four stars because I found the love triangle a little too prominate as the sex scene was too unbelievable during the situation the two characters were in- though I will not give away anymore. I would definitely recommend this movie. I was thoroughly entertained and saddened by the story line.

1277270,4,B00003CXRA,"The opening scene of Enemy At The Gates is very much reminiscent of (and heavily borrows from) the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan in its graphic depiction of the madness and brutality of war. However, that is no bad thing because to this point Saving Private Ryan is the most realistic cinematic depiction of war ever made. Set around the Nazi invasion of Russia, and more specifically the Battle of Stalingrad during World War II, this is the story of a reluctant hero Vassily Zaitzev (Jude Law), a sniper elevated to iconic status by a combination of his own deeds and political war propaganda. Vassily gives his people new hope and as a result, the Nazis view Vassily as a major threat to their conquest of Russia and send their own expert marksman Major Konig (Ed Harris) to Stalingrad to hunt down and kill Vassily, and so begins a game of cat and mouse.
Director Jean-Jacques Annaud expertly recreates and captures the horrors of war and a city made desolate. The main cat and mouse plot between the two expert marksmen is also well-handled and Annaud maintains a good balance between the need for suspense, urgency and character development. Okay so what if it was only the Penal units of the NKVD that shot retreating soldiers and not the main part of the Red Army? (You say tomato I say tomatoe). It is a fact that under Stalin and subsequent communist Soviet regimes that people were unfairly imprisoned for such crimes as having a different opinion or writing a book and that Stalin committed horrific crimes against his people. Is it morally okay to shoot criminals and people who were unjustly jailed? I don't think so. It is also a fact that propaganda (on all sides) always plays an important part in war, and that the Russian soldiers in WWII fought incredibly hard and won against all odds, as depicted in this movie. However, this is not just a war movie or a thriller set in wartime, it also maintains a couple of good sub-plots, including a love triangle between Vassily, the propaganda journalist Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) who made him a hero and a female soldier played by Rachel Weisz. The casting of the movie is pretty interesting, with the exception of the excellent Ed Harris, the main characters are all played by British actors (with English accents), including a cameo from Bob Hoskins as Joseph Stalin. The reason behind this I don't know but they all give good performances, although I must admit to still being slightly unconvinced with Rachel Weisz's acting ability.
While not quite hitting the heady heights of classic war movies such as Saving Private Ryan, Enemy At The Gates nonetheless gives a refreshingly alternative viewpoint and historical retelling of the second world war from what has often been a neglected Russian perspective: Differences aside and contrary to popular opinion, it is unlikely that the Allies would have won WWII so quickly if it were not for the doggedness and enormous sacrifices of the Russian people. This is definitely superior to most of the dross that gets released on a weekly basis and whilst not quite scaling the heights to greatness, it's a pretty good film that I highly recommend checking out.",1011139200,,3176,4.8080438756855575
1277271,4,B00003CXRA,"Based loosely on actual events, this gripping film depicts a war within a war: a deadly game of cat and mouse between two expert snipers in urban ruins, amidst the greater conflict of the German invasion of Russia during World War II.
The main actors (Law and Harris) are superb, nailing each scene with stone-firm hands and steel-blue eyes. Supporting performances by Ron Perlman and the lovely Rachel Weisz are also well done. Joseph Fiennes is adequate, though (as in _Shakespeare in Love_) he comes across as ""puppyish"", as if he's trying too hard to play a good actor playing his character. The war footage is indeed stark and violent. The score is subtly wonderful, the themes lending emotion to the alternatively violent, tense and tender scenes.
In short, this is a gripping, solid film, whose minor weaknesses are perhaps a touch of predictability and (initially) the fact that the Russians are all speaking with British accents. Not on par with Schindler's List as WW-II period movies go, but recommended nonetheless. Four stars.",1010880000,3,1039,5.011560693641618
1277272,1,B00003CXRA,"The movie had great potential even though it was based on partially true events. Anyway, the movie starts as Vassili Zaitsev is going to the front padlocked in a boxcar. This was the first thing I noticed that was insulting to my country and its history. The portrayal of my grandfathers that fought in this battle as ill-equipped frightened cattle.  This is pure BS, if anyone has ever read a non-fiction account of this battle or seen a documentary about this battle then they know that what they show on the screen is pure crap. History has shown that Soviet soldiers weren't so frightened and ill-equipped when compared the the ""MIGHTY"" Wehrmacht. The first 30 minutes of the film insulted me on such a level that I had no interest in watching the rest of this bland and worthless film. In the first scene, supposedly you see the Red army in action. What you are really seeing is an NKVD penal unit charging across ""Red Square."" into the german machine guns which of course decimate the soldiers and then as they retreat their own officers(aka executioners?) mow down the rest. the Red army never fought like this. The Penal units of the NKVD did-however shooting retreating soldiers on such a scale was never done. Who in the already dwindling 62nd army had time to waste more men for nothing? Besides, Stalingrad was not fought charging across squares-it was fought within houses, rooms, factories all in brutal close quarters fighting. The Specialties of the Soviet soldiers: Submachine guns, grenades, flamethrowers, knives, bayonets, sharpened shovels, and any other form of material that could be found. the 10man storm squad was more important than a 10,000 man division. The first scene is heavily done with all the typical western stereotypes and cliches of the cold war. oddly enough the character i liked was the German sniper-he seemed very real to me. the ""Russian"" Characters were all marionettes-I felt no sympathy towards them. The Characters, with the exception of the German were all without depth-no surprise here-film made by a French dabbler named jean-jacques annuad. Little does this incompetent idiot understand Russians, and the Battle of Stalingrad. Some of the sniper scenes were interesting to watch even though they were done in a surprisingly quiet Stalingrad. The Propaganda theme was pathetic-Historically it played a very miniscule part. the love triangle was out of place-Women played a very impotant part, but they were not frightened whores as this film would have one believe. Vehicles were important to Annuad-he got them and their usage wrong. German pz. III's effortlessly mowing down Russian defense in the factories-please, there were 3 soviet tank brigades equipped with T-34's and KV's that fought in the factories. ""the germans have tanks, aircraft, artillery what do I have?"" A dialogue done by one of those ""Incompetent"" Soviet wusses.
Guess what, our soldiers had all of those things. How else were they able to bleed the Germans? I won't write anymore, I don't want to think of this pathetic film anymore.""A foreigner will not notice, a Russian will not forgive."" -Valeriy Potapov, Director of Russian Battlefield(History.vif2.ru)
I recommend watching The Russian film ""Come and See"" or to read The books ""Enemy at the gates"" or ""War of the rats"" Read and watch this and maybe you can understand the Russian fron of WW2. this film isn't not a source for anything-Pure BS 0/5",1010102400,60,3427,5.012280701754386
1277273,4,B00003CXRA,"This 2001 war movie brings WW2 to audiences from a unique perspective for Americans - the battle of Stalingrad in 1942 which lasted six months, took 2 million lives and was an important turning point in the war. It stars Jude Law as a Russian sharpshooter  and Joseph Fiennes as a fellow soldier of a slightly higher rank who publicizes the hero's courage throughout Russia.  However, the Germans bring in their own sharpshooter, Ed Harris.  A young shoeshine boy, Gabriel Thompson, who might or might not be betraying his country, a Jewish Russian soldier, Rachel Weisz, who is the love interest of the two Russian soldiers and Bob Hoskins as Nikita Krushchev, round out the cast.  Each one gives an impressive performance.
The battle scenes are excellent, the cruelty of war clearly  demonstrated, especially in the scenes when the Russians shoot their own men for running away.  There's a lot of blood and it is all very real and gruesome.  This sets the stage for the rest of the story, which is quite gripping, especially as the two sharpshooters are locked in a cat and mouse game throughout most of the film.  At those times, my eyes were glued to the screen, feeling the tension as well as the hardships that the Russians endured.  However, when it came to the romance, the story lagged and there was just a little too much modern interpretation of Communism for my taste. The story was a good one though and could have stood on its own without all that extra stuff. I did thoroughly enjoy the video, however, and recommend it for war film buffs, especially for those who might want to explore this rarely explored part of history.

This is a great movie to see this, it is very educational, before it I had no idea of Stalingrad, and I love history and specially WW2, sure, is not as good as Saving Private Ryan, but it is at least as authentic, which makes it a great contender for best war movie. Plus, the story is based on a true story, all the characters did exist, a thing that I loved, plus it shows how hard it was for Russia to stop Nazi Germany, moreover, the Nazis are shown, just like in Ryan, as true people and soldiers, not evil people, or the bad guys, because I think as well as Spielberg and Jean-Jacques Annaud that in a war there are no good guys and bad guys. And this movie is like that, although some people might argue about that, this movie is not that heroic, we have to remember that it is a true story, and it can't be changed that dramatically. It is still about Russian folk hero Vassili Zaitzev, but Ed Harris did as usual a great job in being a nemesis, authentic and real, not exaggerated. The rest of the cast is al so great, Rachel Weisz is both beautiful, like I have always said, but also authentic, she really played a strong character, not a damsel in distress but a soldier, which makes the movie good, plus she played it great, you fell related to her, to Jude Law, to Joseph Fiennes, to Bob Hoskins, to Ed Harris, and to Ron Perlman who had a sort but memorable role, but I specially liked Rachel, it was about time she showed her skills and her beauty, the Mummy was not enough, although she looks dirty because of her role as a soldier, in some takes she really looks lovely, sure, she looks amazing in The Mummy Returns, but I liked her in this movie. Still, the cast is all amazing, big names, big movie, not many publicity, I almost not heard about Enemy, I saw the trailer when it was already playing, weird thing, that's why the movie is not that famous, but it should be. And the DVD, well, to be a Paramount movie, it has good special editions, a trailer, deleted scenes, 2 featurettes, this is the least you could have done for Braveheart or The Untouchables, but that is a thing of the past, keep it up, don't loose track.

By and large , I hate the after-feeling of watching a real bad movie . This motion picture generated that feeling - don't let it do the same for you . Let my redeeming be in the form of preventing you from sharing my misfortune .
In case you haven't heard , this film was a disaster at the box office ( which is , surprisingly enough for some , quite a good criterion in this case... ) , and that according to critics the story was weak and lame - they were right all along ; This film has no standing ability whatsoever . The idea of making a movie about the eastern flank battles in WWII is interesting and welcomed on its own - but what about the rest of the story ? What about a decent plot ? What about acting ?
In my opinion , what they had decided to do here was to ride success wave of ""Saving Private Ryan""(SPR) - somebody wanted to make some money and found a way :  let's take a good part of ""SPR"" - the sniper - concentrate and develop his contribution to the war efforts - and build an entire movie about the heroism of his mighty loneliness . What a hoax ! What a sham ! There is no development , no depth , no understanding of his hardship of killing men that are unaware of his existence , almost no inner conflict - just the expected , seen before , 100 yards meaningless executions for the lust of the blood you `ought' to show in WWII movies .
The worst part of it all is that I feel for the SPR sniper character much more than I would ever feel for this sniper ! His leading actor abilities are so feeble , I couldn't care less for his fate in the end  . Aside from that , the sniper duel is shameful to Ed Harris who agreed to take part in a role , that didn't utilize even an inch of his talent . They could put me in Harris' place and it would still be the same ( I'm exaggerating here only to stress my point ) . His Part , like all the others' is without soul or depth - they actually didn't give him a chance to play ! I don't really want to discuss the plot , nor the rest of the crew - they don't deserve it .
The only interesting thing I found was the intense battle scene in the beginning , again just like in SPR - a complete and disgraceful copy of the structure of that film . Like its predecessor , this scene is hard to watch , but convey the horror of the war .
Even the final scene of the duel is so irritating  you won't imagine . No moral , no relief , no hubris , no tears - nothing ! Do yourself a favor and complete your liabilities to this movie by clicking this review's 'No' or 'Yes' button and continue to better movies .",1008633600,10,2794,3.9223985890652555
1277334,5,B00003CXRA,"Forgotten history is usual the most interesting. 'Enemy at the Gate' catches a rare glimpse of this forgotten history. Captured is part of the tremendous suffering due to war during the battle of Stalingrad. A reminder, that the 20th Century is by far the bloodiest in history.
The characters are rich and full. However the movie's greatest appeal is stepping into the mind of a sniper. The sniper, a solider drunk with his sniper rifle, is also a 20th centuries invention. This makes the film a good but solemn and even at times gruesome watch. A message of tremendous suffering is a bitter pill. However, this gruesomeness ends up being the movie's biggest downside. Excessive killing towards the end, damps the overall quality of the story.
Enjoy 'Enemy at the Gate' and if your interest is sparked, read about history. Educate yourself about the centuries' wars. Grasp for the wisdom, which once collectively gained, may prevent the 21 century being even more bloodier.",1008288000,,973,4.975460122699387
1277335,3,B00003CXRA,"It is difficult to know exactly what the producers of this film intended it to be. Is this portrayal of the dreadful stalemate that was the battle for Stalingrad meant to demonstrate that the communist dictatorship of Stalin was every bit as evil as the fascist dictatorship of Hitler, not least in its total disregard for the value of human life? Is it a gritty thriller about the individual bravery and personal cunning of two evenly matched national heroes, each striving for a symbolic victory over their enemy? Is it a tragedy centred on the impossible love triangle involving a young woman of the Russian intelligentsia, a naive shepherd boy from the Urals and his new-found friend, a political officer within the Red Army? Is it merely another large-budget gore-fest, intended to leave one awe-struck at modern graphic technology? Sadly - I suspect through trying to be all of the above to some degree - ""Enemy at the Gates"" fails to come across as anything of any real note.
Certainly, the special effects are gut-churningly realistic. Unfortunately, for me, they sum up one of this film's great failings: they are so detailed and overblown that it is impossible to take them in. And while this may go some way towards conveying the terrifying and bewildering conditions in which warfare is generally conducted, it also goes a long way towards losing the focus of the audience's attention at crucial stages of the drama. As a result, the film's message, if indeed it has one, becomes lost amongst the myriad messages screaming for our attention. We stop involving ourselves in the drama and start instead almost to admire it as spectacle, which although sickening is never what it really should be - frightening and involving. (For that, you need to watch ""Band of Brothers"".)
The same complaints are true of the flow of the film as a whole. Of the story's numerous sub-plots - Vassili's childhood circumstances; K&ouml;nig's and Koulikov's personal backgrounds; Sacha's activities in the enemy's camp; Tania's vacillation between the Sniper Corps and a safe intelligence job; or even, indeed, Danilov's feelings for Tania - none are really explored to any degree. Few are ever explained or even, in fact, allowed to play out effectively. It is thus hard to become absorbed in any of the film's various elements for long.
The film is worth watching for some powerful performances by the principals - especially Bob Hoskins in the role of Nikita Khrushchev - and, if you need that sort of thing, for its graphic portrayals of man's inhumanity to man. Unfortunately, though, the film's often-cumbersome dialogue, coupled with rather directionless editing, makes for an overly long, somewhat confusing and ultimately unsatisfying drama.
This DVD production is nothing very special, either. The anamorphic widescreen picture quality is superb, of course. Also included is almost 40 minutes of background material, as well as a good 10 minutes-worth of out-takes. Sadly, though, there is no way to view the movie with the out-takes reinserted at the appropriate places, which is a great shame, given that the decision to cut these scenes was obviously taken at a late post-production stage and they are in no way unfinished. Although their reinstatement would make the film even longer, I can't help feeling that this would, in fact, help illuminate other scenes and make sense of some of the action. It would at least be nice to have the opportunity to try it that way. One way and another, then, I have to say that this is an altogether disappointing production.",1008201600,4,3567,4.996638655462185

It's hard to tell what you're going to get when you find yourself watching a Jean-Jacques Annaud film. Some of his output deserves instant classic status; some should never have seen the light of day. Enemy at the Gates balances on the thin line between the two, but does eventually manage to fall on the side of the former.

Annaud teams up with Alain Godard (as in most of his truly fine efforts) to offer up a screenplay about two snipers, Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law) and Major Konig (Ed Harris) during the 1942/43 siege of Stalingrad. The two are backed by a solid cast of minor characters, including the off-kilter-genius casting of Bob Hoskins as Krushchev. And while Annaud and Godard use the story of Zaitsev to examine the pros and cons of propaganda, they thankfully never lose focus on the real story-- two guys trying to kill each other while a war rages around them. It doesn't sound all that interesting when stripped down, and there are certainly a few places where the film drags, but overall it works much better than one would expect it to. Jude Law is, as always, a pleasure to watch onscreen, and Ed Harris gives one of his better performances (though he can't seem to decide if he's supposed to be speaking in a German accent or not).

The attack by Nazi fighter planes on Russian soldiers crossing the Volga river by boat was particularly disturbing in it's effectiveness.  The wartime settings depicting war time Stalingrad was first rate.
The story revolves around the pitting of the top Nazi sniper, played by Ed Harris against the propagandized top Soviet sniper played by Jude Law.  The battle of wits between the 2 is played out very nicely.  There is also a love triangle played out between Law, Soviet political officer Joseph Fiennes (excellent as usual) and Soviet soldier Rachel Weisz.  This proves to be too syrupy for my own taste.
As is usual with contemporary films, this one runs about 20 minutes too long.  Incidently, Bob Hoskins is chillingly effective as Nikita Khruschev.",1007683200,,897,5.194444444444445

Everyone (5 or 6 people) thought the love-story aspect really detracted from the movie. When I saw it I thought it was the Hokiest movie I have seen in years.  There are maybe 15 minutes (out of a 2 hour movie) of good sniper action and suspense.  The two snipers were well cast and did fine jobs of acting.  The young commissar did a credable job, but the girl soldier/translator was terrible (though I loved her in The Mummy).  Worst of all was the Hokey love story that competed with(and often overshadowed) the military story line. Some of the graphics, especially some of the air attacks, were just hilarious, they looked like something in a cartoon.  There were a lot of little historical inaccuracies that could be overlooked easily enough.  Wartime footage shows the sun actually shining some during the Stalingrad campaign, though most of the action was set at night.  There are advantages to daytime sniping, and that would have helped the overall drearyness of the movie.  Even though I really liked the Russian sniper, the movie leads one to favor the German sniper and his side in general.

As a self-confessed WW II buff (for reasons that should be obvious from my byline), I found the movie to be about as historically accurate as they come, with an unusual attention to detail (from authentical tanks down to the rags wrapped around rifles to keep one's hands from freezing to the metal). The opening, depicting the Soviet leadership's attempt to get a grip on the desperate situation by callously force-feeding untrained recruits into the maul (and having them shot by political commissars when retreating for ""Edification"") is as
gripping as it is sadly historical.
The protagonist, Chief Master Sergeant Vassili Grigorievich Zaitsev (a.k.a. Vasily Zaitzeff, depending on the transliteration system used), was in real live the Red Army's most famous sniper, although not its top scorer. His ""pupils"" indeed included the Jewish girl Tania
Chernova, who became famous in her own right, and a love affair
did exist between the two. (...)
Cinematography does a great job of showing the grisliness and unglorious side of war in general and this type of urban warfare in particular, and the actors put in good to excellent performances. I am told that the ladies fall for Jude Law; I was greatly charmed by Rachel Weisz but have the excuse that she resembles my real-life spouse :-)
But the best performance I saw was that of Ed Harris, playing the antagonist, depicted in some historical accounts (and in the movie) as a German army major named Koenig or Koenigs (head of the sniper school at Zossen in former East Germany), and in other accounts as an SS-colonel named Thorvald.

There were also a few effective quips (like Khruschev's (Bob Hoskins) 'advice' to a failed commander of Soviet forces at Stalingrad), as well as some preposterously high-minded balderdash straight out of the Inept Writer's Handbook on Historical Speech (take for example the philosophical voice-over opening the film, which is straight out of the mouth of an illiterate shepherd and reeks of the 'leopard-with-springs' monologue from 'Gallipoli').
However, there were also some less desirable elements, the most prominent being the forced, obligatory love triangle between super-sharpshooter Vasily (Jude Law), political animal Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) and lady sharpshooter Tanya (Rachel Weisz). I kept hoping we would get past this customary plot hindrance and get on with the war once the equally obligatory love scene - which caused more titters than groans in the audience - was over, but noooo! Then we must also have a bonding scene, where the lovers keep their clothes on but reveal their souls or something along these lines. At least director Jean-Jacques Annaud had enough sense to cut this wholly inappropriate display with a chilling scene that amply made up for the emotional desert created by two people drawn together by threat of imminent death rather than anything else.
Don't get me wrong - the triangle-subplot aside, this was a thoroughly engrossing war spectacle, the battle sequence opening it was the most breathtaking, fascinating scene since the swordfight on top of a bamboo forest in 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon', and the actors did a fine job with what they were given, which is not a whole lot.
It seems to be a trademark of war movies to display characters as parts of the bigger scheme rather than actual people. Nevertheless, Jude Law and Joseph Fiennes (who very successfully plays agains type) develop a tangible, complex relationship as two disparate men who learn to care about each other. As I was sitting at the cinema, a thought passed my mind that would probably disrupt the whole canon of the war-movie making: Why couldn't we just lose the girl and have a nice love story between the two men? At least one begins to care for them, which is more than I can say for Weisz, whose limited acting range comes down to a girl-next-door smile and an over-exaggerated display of physical pleasure. Bob Hoskins lends (gruesome) comic relief as the determined Khruschev, Ed Harris is cool and sinister as Vasily's German nemesis, Major Koning, and young Gabriel Marshall-Thomas is both endearing and convincing as a young Russian boy who takes on the risky role of undercover counterintelligence agent.
All in all, 'Enemy at the Gates' works fine in the visual department and manages to convey the emotional conflict in most of its characters, but when it comes to 'intimate relations', it fails miserably on the army blanket where it succeeds on the battlefield.",1006473600,4,3086,5.029296875

Everyone is complaining that it had to much of a love story, but considering the plot is about a love story, that is kinda fitting. Sure, it isn't as action packed as Saving Private Ryan, but it is definately an enjoyable film in it's own right. It's beautifully directed, I mean the visual style of the whole film is awe inspiring. I like the french-style directing used, reminicent of Luc Besson, although he is still the best French director. The acting is superb, even if they do have English accents, who cares? This is less of an all out war film than Private ryan, but I enjoyed it's subdued, almost mellow pace. The action scenes between the snipers are cleverly done and quite hair raising.

1277374,1,B00003CXRA,"I purchased this movie based on the actors and the subject matter, figuring it was a 'no lose' choice.  Boy was I wrong!  For starters, the producers teleported Czar Nichola's army of WW1 to WW2 Stalingrad.  By 1942 the Russians were producing huge numbers of small arms and there was no need for succeeding waves of attacking soldiers to pick up weapons from the dead.
From watching the movie you would think that Stalingrad was as desolate as the moon, not a city where 600,000 troops incessently fought over every inch for more than 6 months.  The Russian snipers even have a cute tradition of walking through hundreds of metres of no man's land to acquire their victim's weapon.  I don't think so!  Of course the Russians are depicted as proud and brave, loyal to the Motherland, the Germans automata, if not outright buffoons.  This despite the fact the sixth army was a shock army with the most experienced troops the Wermacht could offer.
Half way thru the movie I wondered how a project with such potential could slip so badly.  Then it hit me - it isn't a war movie with a love story subplot, but a love story in a war setting.  In sum, I wish the money poorly spent on EATG had rather been used to create a better DVD version of Cross of Iron!",1005868800,11,1253,4.4605263157894735

Based on factual events the story really is about two men who are sent out to win for their countries this decisive physcological battle.  A (based on a real Russian hero) Russian shepherd / hunting sharpshooter Vassily Zaitzev (Jude Law) turned sniper has the edge by becoming a political & the peoples hero versus a Germany's #1 Marksman Major Konig (Ed Harris) who is sent to kill this Russian sniper hero.  The movie is a cat & mouse game between these two experts with both countries depending on their respective man to win.  Mean while the ""Battle of Stalingrad"" continues.
This Widescreen DVD captures the dissmal & gruesome conditions of this wore torn Russian city & its Army.  Well Directed and acted this movie is a great addition to your WWII DVD library.",1005782400,2,1001,4.763005780346821
1277377,3,B00003CXRA,"The movie begins with young troops going to the front lines to a central Soviet city that bares the name of their leader, Stalingrad.
As the doors are opened, the troops stand in shock at what they see, the destruction of a once mighty city by a force that is far superior to what the Russians can muster up. However, the soldiers (most who are given a gun and 5 bullets) are forced to charge at gunpoint (it will be either the Russian Commanders or the German Forces that will kill them). Those who do not have guns are have to retrieve the guns from the dead. Moral is low and all looks lost when a new Commander named Krushchev arrives to handle the situation.
This is the backdrop for the real story, which focuses on young Vassily Zaitsev, played by Jude Law. Vassily is a young man, a farmer's son, who was taught by his grandfather to shoot and is excellent at it. He meets up with Danilov, a Political Officer whose job is similar to a moral cheerleader. Together, they plan to make Zaitsev a legend, a German killing sniper machine.
As Zaitsev's reputation for killing German officers becomes a turning point in the battle, the German's call in their head sniper, played by Ed Harris. This leads to a show down that only one can walk away from. Intertwined in this is a romantic triangle between Vassily, Danilov and a young Jewish fighter named Tania (Rachel Weisz).
The Russian/German showdown is definitely the showcase of this movie. There are tense scenes where the snipers scramble for superior hiding spots to gain the advantage, and throughout the movie Harris' Major Koenig always seems to have the upper hand, with his cunning technique. One of the best scenes in the movie involve Vassily and a fellow tracker (Dana Cebulla) think they got Koenig in a clothing factory, but are instead walking into a trap.
At this level, the movie suceeds. However, Director Annaud tries to dig deeper into the characters and like most convenient plot tricks is to introduce a love triangle. This does not succeed however, because Weisz and Law have no chemistry together. It was even made worse when the two actors were forced to endure one of the most uncomfortable love scenes in recent memory. Joseph Fiennes is in the background and does not have the scene presence he had in movies like ""Shakespeare in Love"". His Danilov is scheming, petty and cowardly.
The movie is also too tense throughout. There is little time for humor or lightheartedness. While this may make for realism, it is not helpful to us people who have to sit through two hours of stark misery. Even movies of great darkness such as Schindler's List had a few moments of brightness. The colors in this movie are grey and flat, as if the Omaha landing scene in ""Saving Private Ryan"" was stretched to the length of the whole movie.
Another bad point was the ending. It had no emotional pull, because the main characters seem to have no real depth or chemistry. It was also a standard, contrived ending.
I would recommend this movie because of the fabulous showdown of the sniper's and the bloody realism of the Battle of Stalingrad. However, it is a movie that has no real center, a center that is often filled by intriguing characters or interesting plot twist in superior movies such as Saving Private Ryan.....Rating: C+",1005696000,2,3298,4.668384879725086

With Enemy At The Gates I thought I would delete that blank. And I was very disappointed. After the first 15 minutes it gets really boring. Don't need to mention that the actors choice couldn't be more wrong. Joseph Fiennes is a fine actor, but Jude Law is much less than a mediocre actor, big time screw up. You couldn't ever tell when he's happy or when he's unhappy. By the way, we already saw this in Artificial Inteligence and Mr. Rippley. Jude Law is one of the worst things ever appeared in Hollywood.

The approach in this film is to build the story around the rivalry between two sharp-shooters.  Jude Law for the Soviets as a devastatingly accurate sniper against the ""cool as steel"" Ed Harris brought in by his Nazi superiors to neutralise him.  Joseph Fiennes contributes as the KGB Intelligence Officer who sees in Law the perfect raw material to create a ""hero of the revolution"" for Stalin's propaganda machine.
In this approach the film succeed well and it is a genuinely absorbing and interesting experience.  The film succeeds in bringing home the awfulness and despair of Stalingrad and the tenousness of life in such times.  There is an interesting lack of moralising in this film and the Russians regime comes off barely better than the Nazis.  The performances are all appropriate to the ambience of the film and the production underlines the awfulness of war - as if we needed a reminder.

There are moments of realist horror, but also moments of suspense, drama, intrigue, love, sex, humor, you name it. The movie starts off on a bad note, displaying a map of Europe with a Nazi presence gobbling it up complemented by a narrator's voice; something straight out of old propoganda films, but oh well, it only lasts a few seconds. Ed Harris does a great job as the German sniper, but the real star of this film should have been Bob Hoskins, whose colorful portrayal of Kruschev probably comes very close to the real man himself. Production and set design is excellent; the sequence involving the factory duel where the glass plays a prominent role simply didn't get the press it deserved. Also, there is a gorgeous musical theme at the end of the film.

1277453,4,B00003CXRA,"We all know about what happened to the Germans at the Battle of Stalingrad but the battle of the Stanligrad snipers is new.
Will the movie show us how slain heroes inspire their comrades to success, or is it a David and Goliath outcome that pits a Soviet shepherd against a WWI German sharp shooter?  Within this uncertainty of the sniper duel is an accurate description of the Battle of Stalingrad.  Fighting takes place from building to building, death and casualties are numerous, rifles are in short supply, entire families contribute to the war effort, and everyone struggles for maintenance of morale in the trenches.
The battle is probably the most important conflict for the Soviets during WWII and was very important to the success of all nations fighting Fascism.  Stalingrad was the most costly of efforts to the Third Reich, and Soviet casualties were also very high.  Why the Germans thought they could win where Napoleon had failed (Russian winter) is beyond my understanding.  However, my understanding may be limited by my own Cold War assumptions.
Within the old Soviet anthem (online everywhere) there are references to ""strong in our friendship tried by fire"" and ""long may our crimson flag inspire"" and, ""we fought for the future, destroyed the invader"".  Maybe the Battle of Stalingrad was the fight where Russians, Ukrainians and many others in the south fused into Soviets.

1277455,5,B00003CXRA,"There are a number of things to love about this movie.  The subject alone makes it highly unusual.  By any measure, the bulk of the fighting of WW II took place on the German Eastern front.  More troops were involved, more very large battles and offensives took place, and more casualties were caused on the German-Russian front than any other arena in the war.  In large part because of the Cold War, Europe and the United States persistently failed to recognize the Soviet contribution to the War, and this was reflected in a complete lack of Hollywood films displaying any Soviet involvement in WW II.  For most non-students of WW II, the Soviet part of the war is perceived as a rather minor part of the conflict.  This movie helps correct some of that misapprehension by focusing on the major front of WW II.
The story itself is not a terribly compelling one, but nearly everything else in the film sparkles.  The performances are all excellent, the sets--which were all constructed especially for this film--were just extraordinary, the visuals were all stunning, and the battle sequences were both exhilirating and horrific.
The only weakpoint in the film is the loosness of the script.  While nearly every scene is memorable, the film functions best as a collection of great individual bits, rather than a marvelous, unified whole.  Nonetheless, I feel comfortable rating this five stars because of the first rate performances, the amazingly vivid battle sequences, and the amazing sets.",1002931200,9,1495,4.971887550200803
1277456,2,B00003CXRA,"This was one of those movies that should have remained as a trailer and never been shown with dialogue. The reason I gave this two and not one star was that at times this was a very appealing movie visually. Then however, the characters opened their mouths. Now, I realize that this was made in Hollywood, and I wasn't expecting the characters to speak Russian, or even have Russian accents. But both of the main characters spoke in British accents, and I just couldn't get past this. I mean nothing is absolutely worse than trying to imagine the horror of what the war must have like for the Russian defenders, and trying to get into their shoes, but then they're calling each other ""comrade"" with British accents (for the love of God why not a good neutral accent?) . As for the rest of the movie, there's one scene that was so unbelievably stupid that it made me want to get up and leave the theater. Not to give anything away, but two of the snipers attempt to sneak up on a master sniper by crawling through a pipe that made so much noise that it would have been impossible not to hear--and then they're surprised that they end up being ambused after they emerge from the pipe. This scene was absolutely inexcusable. I don't expect everything to be realistic, but this went to the point of insulting the intelligence of the viewer.

1277498,4,B00003CXRA,"This is a war-within-a-war story based on a real WWII Soviet sniper upon whom the Soviets built much of their morale boosting war propaganda.  Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law) is an extraordinary marksman, pressed into service as a sniper in the Soviet army.  Through a combination of effective sharpshooting and relentless coverage by propadanda minister Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), Vassili becomes a Soviet hero and a German nemesis.  In response, the Germans send their best sniper, Major Konig (Ed Harris) to find Vassili and take him out.  The result is a deadly game of cat and mouse where the lines between predator and prey blur.
Director Jean-Jaques Annaud (""Seven Years in Tibet"") also collaborated in writing the screenplay which is mostly riveting, but too often loses focus.  The film is generally well directed with an authentic wartime feel to it.  While some have criticized it for looking too much like ""Saving Private Ryan"", I feel such a comparison is a compliment.  Using outstanding cinematography as a model, and coming close to duplicating it is a positive, not a negative.  There has also been a lot of criticism of the fact that the Russians don't have Russian accents and the Germans don't have German accents and thus it isn't realistic.  I find this criticism ironic and without merit.  How someone can accept as realistic the fact that all the characters are speaking English and then criticize as unrealistic the fact that they don't speak accented English is beyond me.
My main criticism of Annaud is his inability to stay locked on the main storyline, the story of the snipers.  He feels compelled to throw in a meaningless love triangle and lots of other fluff that really add nothing to the story.  The time would have been better spent delving deeper into the minds of the snipers and creating additional suspense filled confrontations.
Jude Law gives a fine follow-up to his outstanding performance in ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" showing that he is here to stay.  He strikes an excellent balance between Vassili's sense of duty and reluctance to be a hero, showing a character that is compelled to be courageous when he is really scared.
Rachel Weisz also turns in a strong performance though her character is totally superfluous to the main story.  Bob Hoskins renders a fabulous wartime Khrushchev.  Ed Harris is good as the German sharpshooter, but this is not among his better performances.  Joseph Fiennes is also very good, although his is another role that is overemphasized needlessly.
This is a very good film that lost its opportunity to be great because of Annaud's inexplicable need to wander from a terrific storyline.  I rated it 7/10.  It is a good wartime thriller worth a look.",1002153600,6,2720,4.953744493392071

This is definitly worth watching. A little slow at times, but that was to help build the characters. Unlike most films, both the German and the Russian sniper are made out to be a couple of guys doing their jobs. Neither is protrayed as the antogonist.

1277500,4,B00003CXRA,"My primary interest in this movie was historical.  I enjoy studying World War II history, and the battle for Stalingrad has always been, in my estimation, one of the most fascinating episodes of the entire war.  When I first saw a preview for ""Enemy at the Gates"" I immediately began to salivate.  When I finally got a chance to see it, unfortunately not on the big screen but on my VCR, I was not disappointed.
This movie provides a rare and realistic glimpse into the horror and chaos that was Stalingrad.  From the initial scenes of poorly armed Russian concripts being strafed by Stukas as they were ferried across the Volga, to the commissars machine-gunning their own retreating soldiers, to the piles of bodies lying in the rubble strewn streets, ""Enemy at the Gates"" paints a realistic picture of the city and the battle.  The production was extremely well done, and did a fabulous job of setting the scene for the two intertwined story lines.
The main plot focuses on Vasili Zaitsev, a real but at the same time legendary figure in the Russian history books, who became a sniper of great skill and renown.  ""Noble Sniper"" Zaitsev became a national hero as the battle for Stalingrad raged, and as his tally of German kills grew.  The Germans obviously took notice as well, and sent the head of their sniper school, a Major Koenig, to deal with this young upstart.  ""Enemy at the Gates"" depicts, with some artistic license, their duel which is also recounted in the pages of Alan Clark's book ""Barbarossa.""  The ending is similar to Clark's historical narrative in several key details, but modified in other details for the sake of dramatic effect.
The second story line is the love triangle (with the obligatory sex scene) involving Zaitsev, his best friend and promoter, and an attractive young lady who happens to serve in the local citizen militia.  I suppose this aspect of the movie makes it more attractive to some viewers who might not otherwise be interested in watching a straight ""war flick,"" particularly one as graphic as this.  Nevertheless, I thought this element of the movie seemed a bit contrived and out of place.  From my perspective as a historical purist, I thought it took something away from an otherwise great movie.
Overall, ""Enemy at the Gates"" is suspenseful and riveting, historically insightful if not necessarily true in every detail, and carries an underlying theme about the precious value of life and love in the face of the most horrific of circumstances.  I enjoyed it immensely, and would recommend it enthusiastically.",1001980800,3,2563,4.864367816091954

First, it is not based on the book ""Enemy at the Gates"", whih I recomend you buy.  It make this movie look like a Disney movie.  This movie is based on the book ""War of the Rats"".  The imagry is great, and the scenes at the docks were a work of art.
I liked the movie because it wasn't your typical ""bad Germans"", ""poor poor Russian"" theame.  This was a Bad war, bad Russia, bad German (note I said German, not Germans) theame.
The history gets a little hollywood, even though it was filmed in Europe, but all war movies are like that.  The love story is true, but the end of it is changed for the movie to make a happy ending, and the end of the sniper duel is so well known, and so much better than the ending in the movie I have no idea why they changed it, but most people wouldn't know the difference anyway.  (The Germans never would have attacked down the middle of a street in Saving Private Ryan either, but that is what makes movies.) This movie in no more or less Hollywood than some of the better war movies, better than most acctually.
The movie is a very different perspective, and is great for that reason.  The mock ups of the German Panzer III's out of American M-24 Chafee tanks was done VERY well, as good, or better than the Tiger I out of a T-34 in Kelly's Heros, and Private Ryan.
If you want something new and different, watch the movie.

Excellent supporting roles are dependable Ron Perleman as a war-weary, sardonic soldier, and Bob Hoskins playing Nikita Khruschev (the resemblance is uncanny!)

1277563,2,B00003CXRA,"I have this theory that the better the movie, the more disjointed and
scattered the supporting material is on the DVD.  Hannibal had hours
of slick promo interviews -- so does Enemy At The Gates.  I sat
through it anyway.
To be kind, it lacks the visceral kick of Private
Ryan, or the emotional insight of Thin Red Line.
But to be blunt:
What were they thinking?
A cast of competent actors cannot save this
cliche ridden nonsense.  Every scene is an exercise in
non-directing/non-writing/non-acting/non-film-making.  The story is
based on real incidents but not happy to leave well enough alone,
Annaud has decided to seek a greater truth -- i.e. change it all and
mess it up in the process.
What we are left with are all the bad
moments in movies strung together -- a love triangle, a dramatic
slaughter of troops charging across red square, blah blah blah.
The
cast seems to have no idea why they're there.  You get the feeling
they had no rehearsal time, no discussion about scenes, were
improvising the script, and had no idea that they were actually going
to use the takes they were shooting.
Why two stars instead of one?
Well it looks nice.  The photography and effects are appropriate, not
obtrusive.

The story is about a Russian Sniper who killed a lot of German officers during the siege of Stalingrad. The Nazi sent its own top sniper from Berlin to counter the Russian sniper. The Russian sniper played here by Jude Law and the German sniper played by Ed Harris. Performances are quite good and the movie is beautifully shot by director Jean-Jacques Annaud. Unfortunately the DVD sound quality is nowhere near the sound quality of Saving Private Ryan. If you watch this after watching Saving private Ryan DVD, you will be disappointed by the sound quality.

1277565,2,B00003CXRA,"I had high hopes for this film, and perhaps that's why I was so let down by it.  A movie based on a very dramatic true life showdown between snipers during World War II featuring the amazingly talented actors Joseph Fiennes (Shakespeare in Love) and Ed Harris (Pollock) can't miss, right?  Unlike the sharpshooters in the story, this flick misses badly.  Mostly I blame the director, although the writer gets a big chunk of blame as well.  The director, Jean-Jacques Annaud, seems concerned only with the visual effectiveness of the backdrops of this film and with nothing else.  Joseph Fiennes is a terrific actor but the director allows his British mannerisms to show even though he's playing a Russian.  Every time Fiennes pronounced Tonya as ""Tonyer"" it made the movie a little less real, which is the last thing a viewer wants from a historical drama.
What I'll never understand is why the writer didn't stay true to history.  The historical facts are much more dramatic than the story told here.  Gone is the three day standoff between the Russian and German.  Remember in Saving Private Ryan when the German sniper was killed by the bullet passing through his scope and hitting him in the head?  That's how the real story in Stalingrad ended, but not in this film.  The reason for this change is one of the snipers wants to go back to being a regular soldier.  No reason is really given for his wishes.  This is especially bad since he was pretty keen on becoming a sniper in the first place.  The ending is anticlimactic, mainly because for most of the film we see the two snipers playing a game of cat and mouse.  When one finally kills the other, it has nothing to do with sniping, and is only marginally connected to the game they were previously playing.
The German sniper (Ed Harris) is woefully two dimensional, though Ed Harris manages to make him interesting even if we are never presented with the character's motivation beyond a single mention that his son was killed at Stalingrad when the Germans first attacked.  The Russian's motivation is based in Hollywood clichs.  This introduces a love interest and a spunky kid spy, as though simply staying alive isn't motivation enough.  Despite some good acting (Bob Hoskins is wonderful as Kruschev), the movie descends into nothing more than a bland Hollywood war story.",999648000,23,2336,4.768656716417911

1277568,5,B00003CXRA,"I watched Batman and Enemy at the Gates today, and thought EatTG is much better. It had a very clear focus, the mini-battle between the snipers entwined with the love triangle (much better than Pearl harbor's love story), and they set it up well against the grand yet brutle background of the crumbing Stalingrad, arguably the greatest battlefield in WWII. The movie gave viewer a very human view of the German Major Sniper, making it a battle not between bad and evil, but between people who all were very deeply injured by the war. That humnan aspect, I believe, gave much life to the story. (Spoiler!!!) When Jude Law killed that Major, I was very much relieved, but also felt sad, considering that the Major wasn't so bad a guy. I didn't like Batman, because I didn't feel compassion toward the ""Bad guys"", and naturally, also felt less for Batman, and cared even less about the plot. Overall, it was a very intense and humane battle, though only two or so people were involved, and only couple of shots fired. The love scene was also very cute, I thought, because though they did it in such a improper and dirty public place, it was still so touching, considering bombs were been droped night and day and corpse is all you could see, and very true, considering their age and that natural desire for body contact.

1277570,4,B00003CXRA,"I found Enemy at the Gates to be an impressive war movie.  Unfortunately, I think this is one of those cases where people came into it expecting something on the level of Saving Private Ryan and were inevitably disappointed.  To be fair the two movies are cut from entirely different molds. Unlike S.P.R., Enemy relies heavily on its gradually intensifying and emotional storyline, which to some may make the movie seem to drag, but is a breath of fresh air to those of us who appreciate good writing, character development, and convincing actors. I also found the films evolving romantic elements to be consistent with the rest of the movie, not overbearing it to the point of distraction (as in Pearl Harbor).  Evenly dispersed throughout the movie are some impressive bombing and battle sequences, as well as some brillantly choreographed sniper encounters. Visually, the film conveys an appropriately harsh feel not unlike S.P.R.; even Rachel Weisz's character wears very little makeup (although she never once lacks for sensual energy). The bombing sequences are simply stunning, delivering in boatloads the take-you-there realism we have come to expect from today's special effects technologies.  As with movies like The Thirteenth Floor (who suffered from the success of The Matrix), Enemy suffered at the box office from the recent success of a blockbuster in the same genre, S.P.R.  But with the release of Pearl Harbor we were shown just how poorly a contemporary war movie could be.  So with this in mind and judging by its high sales, it is no wonder then that Enemy at the Gates has gained a newfound puplic appreciation, an appreciation I most definitely share.",999388800,,1675,5.050724637681159
1277571,3,B00003CXRA,"I've read that there is enormous pressure to make all films English language because the profits are so much higher. That is why many foreign countries find their directors now shooting English language films. This film is a case in point with Frenchman Jean Jacques Anaud making yet another English language film with an all English language cast. He ends up with very uneven results. Everyone who is playing a Russian is patently unbelievable. Ed Harris, however, shows that an English language actor can pull it off if he is so intensely into the character that nothing else matters, including his native tongue. He brilliantly, quietly and incisively portrays a Nazi officer who has been ordered to kill the Russian sniper (Jude Law), who has been embarrassing Hitler with all of his German kills. Harris seems to understand that less is more when playing this kind of role. The others tend to overact to compensate, almost always a mistake.

We start with the Battle of Stalingrad in WWII and there meet Joseph Fiennes, a rather creepy Russian officer, who commandeers Jude Law's character into being the master sniper who the Germans are eager to bring to a halt. Along the way there is a romance between Law and Rachel Weisz and we even meet Bob Hoskins as Nikita Kruschev! Law is sexy, as usual, but he is so obviously an Englishman that he can't bring this character entirely home to us. The romance aspect isn't bad. If Harris hadn't been in this movie though with the main cat and mouse aspect, I would certainly have labelled it an outright failure. Perhaps I've seen too many actual Russian movies, with subtitles and Russian actors, which interfered with my credibility level in viewing this film. That would seem to be a barrier that Anaud must overcome though if he wishes to continue to attract me to his work. His best English language film was ""The Lover"" set in Vietnam when it was French Indochina and populated by the French. Perhaps he needs to keep some nexus with his French heritage intact in his films and not drift into cultures totally alien to him.

1277572,4,B00003CXRA,"ENEMY AT THE GATES (2001, R= Strong Graphic War Violence, Brief Profanity, and Some Brief Sexual Content) The Cast: JUDE LAW, ED HARRIS, RACHEL WEISEZ and BOB HOSKINS. The Genre: ACTION/ROMANCE/WAR/DRAMA The Plot: In the European battles of WWII, the best sniper ever (Jude Law) is found by a newspaper reporter, who ends up turning the man into a celebrity soldier, who will give the country hope in winning the war. After the fact, another famous sniper (Harris) is on the trail of killing him off. BASED ON A TRUE STORY. What Works: Realistic depictions of the early stages in the European battles of WWII. Great performances and heart-pounding drama, as well as powerful directing top that all off. What Doesn't: The moments where yet another, but realistic, romance forms between JUDE LAW and RACHEL WEISEZ when using a historical event as a backdrop for it. As well as the sleepy moments in between battles that are supposed to be a major part of the film, but just boost up more of LAW's performance. Reality Check: The battles are very real, but the final battle in the end is out of purportion of what the actual events were like between the two snipers (Harris, Law). The Catch: Since there have been so many war films being produced lately, like THE THIN RED LINE, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, PEARL HARBOR, APOCALYPSE NOW REDUX- you may get tired of seeing another one. And this film does have some sex in it and strong, very graphic war violence- so kids should not see this film.

1277624,5,B00003CXRA,"I enjoy historic movies, but can never understand one thing. If you are going to go through all the trouble of recreating a historic drama, than why not make it accurate? Vassili was not a dashing handsome young man. He was a rather portly, squinty eyed looking little devil. This should not take away from his supreme skill during the battle of Stalingrad (now St. Petersburg) where he demoralized the Nazis with his sniping abilities. The final confrontation when Vassili did cap the German sniper was not portrayed anything like the actual historic event. Vassili actually tricked him with a glove on a stick. As a movie though it is VERY good. The opening scene when the inexperienced Russians are thrown against the Nazi War Machine is every bit as good as 'Saving Private Ryan's' opening D-Day scene. There is a love triangle too in this flick, I thought it unneccesary, but it kept the movie flowing between hunting/hunted scenes. There actually was a female Russian sniper who scored 300 kills. The Russians actually employed hundreds of snipers in Stalingrad because guerilla warfare was the only way they could save their city. Anyone who wasn't assigned sniper duty, was issused a rifle that only had two settings, safe and fully automatic. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a World War II movie without the over-whelming American patriotic, chest thumping, overly sentimental team USA #1 forever theme.

Enter Vassily Zaietseff (Jude Law), a Russian shepherd promoted, on the strength of his superlative marksmanship, to an elite sniper by his compatriot Danilov (Joseph Fiennes). The story contains elements of rivalry, treachery, friendship, patriotism and sacrifice amidst the collapsing ruins of Stalingrad, as well as romance, once Zaietseff and Danilov find themselves competeing for the love of Tanya (Rachel Weisz), a dedicated and devoted fellow soldier and romantic interest. As Zaietseff's fame spreads as an expert sniper and Russian national hero (on account of his masterful assasinations of high-ranking Nazi officers), a German agent and veteran sniper, Konig (Ed Harris) is sent to make short work of the young and potentially dangerous Zaietseff. The most intimate encounter of the film takes place between the ageing, but lethal, Konig and Zaietseff as they attempt to dispatch each other across the Russain warzone. Moreover, their relationship is characterised by a high level of involvement and cunningly judged moments of violence and suspense. The opening reel (a charge of poorly-armed Russian infantry falling before the Nazis) owes a great deal to ""Saving Private Ryan"", though this film lacks the immediacy of Spielberg's now great war epic.

1277626,3,B00003CXRA,"Jean Jacques Annauds Enemy at the Gates comes on like the nasty younger brother to Speilbergs Saving Private Ryan. In Speilbergs vision, war is the final option by which Democracy can overcome Tyranny. In Enemy at the Gates war is the meat grinder into which Tyranny casts its constituents.
The beginning of Enemy at the Gates (EatG) deliberately echoes Saving Private Ryan (SPR) but is the exact antithesis to it. In SPR, American GIs storm ashore on the beaches of Normandy. Subjected to murderous German fire (graphically depicted), the Americans rely on leadership, firepower and clever tactics from experienced veterans to get them off the beach.
The experience of war for the Russian conscripts of EatG is somewhat different. Arriving on the east bank of the Volga in locked cattle trucks, their first view of Stalingrad is that of hell. They are subjected to continuous air and artillery attack as they cross the Stygian Volga in flimsy boats with little or no protection. Those who try to escape into the river are summarily shot by the Commissars. Upon reaching the city itself, half the conscripts are handed rifles  the others are told to pick them up weapons as their comrades fall  and are sent straight into battle with no planning or leaders against a well armed and prepared foe. Slaughter ensues and the NKVD mercilessly shoots down the survivors that try and retreat to their own lines.
Welcome to Stalingrad.
So begins a film of such potential and promise that it is hugely disappointing when it falls flat on its face. The story revolves around the exploits of Noble Sniper Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law). According to legend, Zaitsev was such a threat to German morale that they sent the head of the German Sniper School, Major Konig (Ed Harris) to deal with him. So far so good. Add love interest in the form of Tania Chernova (Rachel Weisz) and a triangle with Commissar/friend Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) and the potential was there for an adult love story (and I don't mean the XXX variety) set against a truly epic backdrop.
And what a backdrop! The recreation of the devastated city is truly awesome. Cold, yet burning, strewn with corpses and piled with rubble, the city itself becomes the most powerful character on the screen.
So what went wrong?
Well the actual script for a start. Basically, no relationship is developed between Fiennes and Weisz. This turns the love triangle into a toothless dramatic device as the conflict between the two men is ascribed a political motive. There is no progression in the relationships between the characters  they just seem to turn on and off as the vagaries of the script dictate. Also the Mrs Filipov character is meaningless  she serves only to act as a mother for Sasha, a character that could just as well have been an orphan. By doing this she just sucks up screen time that could have been better used elsewhere.
Nothing serves to tie the events together into a convincing narrative, which, considering that the most important battle of the Second World War is taking place, exhibits extreme laziness on the part of the script writer and the director. No overall impression of the battle is produced, so there is no sense of urgency in the Soviet position. A string of battles take place but the viewer is in no place to put the pieces together, to watch as the German stranglehold on the city tightens. As the film progresses, the individual characters seem oddly divorced from everything else thats happening. Passing references are made to some significant landmarks, such as the Tractor Factory, the Chemical Works and the Department Store but the average viewer has no idea where these locations are and why they are important.
And to think it could all have been simply handled by placing the Danilov and/or Chernova characters in the 62nd Army headquarters makes the sloppy handling all the more mysterious.
Which brings us to the overall ambivalent treatment of the historical setting. No, Im not complaining about irrelevant technical details such as when certain tanks were manufactured. But their is an overall disregard for the historical context of the setting. Using this film as a sole point of reference would leave you to believe that the Soviets were capable only of staging mass human wave attacks during the middle of the day and partying in the bunkers at night. In reality, it was the Soviet expertise in infiltration and night attacks that overcame the German superiority in air and artillery. Also, according to the film, the battle was managed by Kruschev (played excellently played Bob Hoskins) from a luxurious headquarters on the Eastern side Volga. No mention is made of Chuikov, the 62nd Army commander responsible for the defence of the city whose headquarters on the West bank of the Volga was frequently under direct German fire. The final Soviet victory is not attributed to any particular event either. One day, the Germans surrender. Why? There is not even a passing mention of the Soviet counter offensive that surrounded the German 6th Army in Stalingrad (this is doubly surprising as, in the films timeframe, the Germans were surrounded BEFORE the final showdown between Zaitsev and Konig).
One is also forced to wonder whether the German financing of the film was a consideration in the depiction of German forces, who are portrayed in much more even-handed light than is the Soviet Army.
So ultimately, the film fails. The true story of the battle of Stalingrad is so dramatic that if the film had followed the historical tension closely, a much more gripping film would have been the result. As it is we are left with a spectacular looking film (there has got to be an Oscar in there somewhere for set design) with some masterful moments and some relevant comments on the nature of tyranny and war. If only it had had a script
It really only deserves 2.5 stars but for the magnificent set and the subject matter.

1277630,5,B00003CXRA,"It is not easy to write a review on this movie - on the one hand it is a ``piece of art,'' but on the other hand it is very rare in the social/historical sense. As the former, I think it not perfect at all as many noticed (but complain about the accent? I don't think that subtitles are any better), but now a day after watching it I am still intrigued and wonder about it. As a suspense, I think that the duel between snipers is very interesting, for example. I think many people expected to see a war  epic and therefore were disappointed with the personal ``chamber''-like  further developments, so they could not except the love story. However, I found these personal developments of characters the most interesting (and there were not much of epic there anyway). I think this is the most realistic war movie I ever saw - when people (both Germans and the Russians) are just people and do what they have to do, since there is no way out of this mess.  So, they don't expect to survive and cannot therefore  postpone their personal feelings.
The historical aspect is much more important. Indeed, after these numerous Hollywood war movies one can be under the impression the American troops won the WWII alone. However, a simple analysis of the death toll - 295,000 (US, military, both in the Pacific and Europe) and more than 7,000,000 of Germans (3,250,000 military) suggests that somebody else was also involved. So, here comes this movie about the main pivotal point of WWII filling the gap a little bit  for a wider audience.

1277631,3,B00003CXRA,"The opening scenes of the movie are incredibly accurate and well handled, portraying the hysterical shoveling of untrained soldiery into a desperate struggle to retain control of Stalingrad.  Few westerners have any idea how many Russian soldiers died during the opening year of Hitler's ""Barbarossa"" campaign, and this opening scene shows why:  incompetent leadership caused largely by Stalin's purges and the control given to the NKVD (predecessor to the KGB) over military operations about which they had no clue.  ""Hold at all costs, no retreat on pain of death"" was the sole order of the day and it led to the needless sacrifice of millions as whole armies were destroyed.
From here the action shrinks from epic to a more personal level as we meet the protagonists.  Again, the film handles things well although we have the first inklings of formulaic characterization and ""pat"" storytelling.  Jude Law is appropriately noble and down-to-earth as ""Vasily,"" Rachel Weisz' character is fairly obviously drawn from the legend of the female ""Baltic sniper,"" and Ed Harris' ""Major Koenig"" is the epitome of the cold, calculating, Teutonic knight.  Joe Fiennes' betrayal of Vasily is all the more appropriate as he represents the corrupt Communist leadership.  Ron Perlman's character is obvious cannon fodder.  The list goes on.
As others have already pointed out, the plot is broken into obvious elements--the duel, the love triangle, the tragic child, and so forth.  Why it's impossible for Hollywood to create any but the most simplistic plot devices and elements is a mystery worthy of Robert Stack.  We know how the various threads will resolve long before the denouement appears onscreen.  Of course, since the film is based on a true story we should know the result of some of the plot threads, but the filmmakers unfortunately chose to alter history in favor of the happy ending.
Despite all this it's a watchable film with good action sequences and a reasonable story line.  It makes a reasonable attempt at tactical and military accuracy, which is very unusual.  It's also beautiful on the big screen; it's just too bad that the director resorted to such obvious devices and left us with an appropriately American, nicey-nice ending.  Much of the film's impact is lost to this vapid and predictable closure.

1277683,4,B00003CXRA,"I am writing this review to talk about DVD Qualty. Paramount has turned out more than a few DVDs of good movies on bad Quality DVDs  ( bad picture , bad sound  , no extra features and so on...The Hunt For Red October was a real disapointment for such a good movie!  But  they did a great job on this one!!!! The picture is perfect and it is presented in true anamorphic wide screen. The DVD includes plenty of extra features. The movie may not be the most accurate when it comes to history but it is still a very entertaining movie to watch Bob Hoskins as Kruschev He  was perfect for the part . The best line in the movie was spoken by Kruschev  quote...""  I DON`T CARE IF YOU HAVE LOST HALF YOU MEN!! LOSE THE OTHER HALF THEN LOSE YOUR SELF!!!!  I you like WW2 movies you should like this one  Four stars out of five for Enemy At The Gates and good job Paramount!!!!",998179200,2,868,4.119047619047619
1277684,5,B00003CXRA,"Probably the best war movie ever. The movie concerns the World War II Battle of Stalingrad from 1942-1943 with almost 2 million dead, it was the biggest and most deadly battle of all time.
Based on American William Craig's book it concentates on a true life duel between the best German and Russian snipers.(The 400 page book had no more than 20 pages dealing with these snipers.)
The only hokey/contived part of the mvie is the female Jewish sniper Tania. The real Tania was a blonde gentile ballerina/medical student and full time sniper and lover of the hero, Vassili. (If the movie needed someone ""Jewish"" they could have used 21 year old commando Captain Ignacy Changar who killed 200 Germans.)
The battle scenes are stupendous and then some.",998179200,,747,4.84375
1277685,3,B00003CXRA,"It is so gratifying to finally see a major motion picture made about the WWII Russian Front.  After all, it was the Red Army that inflicted 80% of Germany's total casualties in the war, a fact that many Americans remain sadly ignorant of.  It is high time we get past Cold War attitudes and pay tribute to the heroism of the Soviet Union in its bitter but ultimately triumphant struggle against Nazism.  _Enemy at the Gates_ is a movie of epic proportions, featuring good overall performances by a solid cast as well as a spectacular cinematic recreation of the bombed-out city of Stalingrad.
Still, the movie tends to drag at times, and could have been much better.  The love triangle subplot was more of a distraction than anything else, taking up time that could have been better used to tell more of the awesome story of the battle of Stalingrad as a whole.  Rather than simply having the German commander state, ""These snipers are demoralizing my people,"" it would have been nice to have actually ""seen"" a little bit more of how the actions of Zaitsev and the Soviet snipers wore down the vaunted German infantry.  Regrettably, the duel between Zaitsev and Koenig seemed to be taking place in a separate reality than the war itself, almost giving the impression that both sides had an unwritten agreement to let the two rivals shoot it out without interference.  Also, the abrupt ending gave no explanation as to how the Red Army, seemingly on the ropes throughout the movie, suddenly emerged victorious.  It would not have taken much film time to explain how this came about: the tenacity of Stalingrads defenders drew the mechanized German forces into costly city fighting, allowing the Red Armys powerful reserves massed to the north and south to punch through the weak Axis flanks and encircle the Germans.  Saving Private Ryan succeeded in telling much of the story of the Normandy invasion in a way that neatly complimented the movies plot.  I wish that Enemy at the Gates had made more of a similar effort.
I know that dramatic license is a fact of life with historical movies, but it is way overdone in this one.  The opening sequence of the Volga crossing is powerful filmmaking and is mostly accurate up until Zaitsev and his fellow soldiers enter the city.  The following part about only every other man receiving a weapon and being sent of in a suicide charge is purely the stuff of legend, though, more fitting of the WWI Russian Army or a Soviet punishment battalion.  The reality was that the Red Army in Stalingrad fought mostly in small detachments armed with submachine guns rather than rifles, moving stealthily amongst the rubble and ambushing the Germans in brutal house-to-house fighting.  This sort of close-quarter combat, where the front lines were often separated by less than 20 yards (or even a mere hallway or staircase), would have played out on screen just as well (better, in fact) as the charge of the Red horde that is the stuff of popular imagination rather than true history.  The conclusion of this scene is misleading, as well.  The Soviets did shoot many deserters who attempted to flee the front lines, but this degree of harshness did not apply to survivors of a failed attack as shown in the film.  The commanders of the Red Army were often brutal towards their men, but not quite that brutal.  As for the way the sniper duel is finally brought to a close, with Koenig walking upright in plain view towards what he suspects is the spot where he has just shot Zaitsev dead, it is just ridiculous.  Not even a rookie sniper would have made such a fatal error, much less an instructor.
The Soviet characters all share the names of actual people, but none are true to their real-world counterparts.  Vassili Zaitsev was more of a natural leader than the movie gives him credit for, not just a shy boy from the Urals reluctantly pushed into the limelight.  Danilov, the political officer, appears to have been crafted by the screenwriters almost solely in order to make a faddish intellectual statement about the pitfalls of Communist idealism.  The real Danilov was shot (though not fatally) when he foolishly stood up to point out Major Koenigs location to Zaitsev, not in an act of suicide. Tania Chernovas on-screen character was the furthest from reality, though.  She was actually a short, temperamental blonde who had previously fought as a partisan in Byelorussia and the Ukraine.  A veteran killer by the time she arrived in Stalingrad and possessing a single-minded hatred of the Germans, the real-life Tania could hardly have been more different from the sensitive student/soldier who never actually fires her rifle once throughout the whole film.  Also, Chernova was likely Ukrainian, not Jewish (only worth noting because of the widespread myth that most Ukrainians welcomed the Nazis as liberators from Soviet rule).  Ironically, the character that seemed truest to reality was Major Koenig, a shadowy figure who some historians claim might never have existed.
Though I used most of the space here to criticize this movie, I guess the fact that I bought the DVD means that I nonetheless enjoyed it.  I probably would have rated it better were I not such a Russian history buff.  Do yourself a favor and take the time to read both _Enemy at the Gates_, by William Craig (a very readable non-fiction account of the whole Stalingrad campaign) and _War of the Rats_, by David Robbins (a novelized version of the sniper duel that is both a better story and closer to historical fact than this movie was).  My main regret is that the films potential was largely squandered to make room for unneeded political rhetoric and melodrama.  I only hope that its mediocre performance will not discourage film producers from backing other Russian Front projects in the future.",998179200,153,5817,4.834677419354839
1277686,3,B00003CXRA,"Let me preface this by saying if you are a person that does not enjoy movies that are loose interpretations of historical truths, this movie may not be for you.  Even with myself not knowing anything about the true story this movie was based on I can already tell you that this film took HUGE historical liberties with its adaptation.  There are just too many parts of the plot (the romance, the best friends battling over a woman, the fate of the child, the ending, etc.) that come out of Hollywood's favorite audience manipulation methods.  The movie is a good portrayal of Stalingrad's general atmosphere during World War II and urban sniper techniques but the story's details are straight out of Hollywood.
If you're not familiar with ""Enemy at the Gates,"" the movie is based on a battle between two of the war's top snipers (German and Russian) in the Battle of Stalingrad which was a turning point in World War II.  As far as casting, the movie has an excellent ensemble of some of today's top acting talent.  As mentioned in the DVD documentaries, Ed Harris and Jude Law are perfect candidates for the sniper roles considering the constant closeups required on their eyes during the film.  Both actors are blessed with brilliantly colored eyes that project a sense of tranquility required for the audience to believe their roles as snipers.
The DVD was a little disappointing.  Considering the big budget financing this film, you'd think they would have added more extras in the DVD.  Besides the usual DVD options, (sound, subtitles, scene selection) two documentaries are included that cover the making of the movie.  Both are general in theme.  It is impressive to witness the production design required in ""Enemy at the Gates"" as they had to rebuild battle torn Stalingrad for this movie's filming.  One surprsing element of the film are the enjoyable deleted scenes.  When watching deleted scenes, many times it becomes apparent just why they were deleted.  I felt though that ""Enemy at the Gates"" should have included some of their deleted scenes as they reveal more about the characters and their complexities.  In particular, the political officer's disillusionment with communism is covered in greater detail which allows you to see the character in a different light.  With the current editing of the movie, the political officer (played by Joseph Fiennes) comes across as a shallow and pitiful person but his character is given much more depth and better understanding of his final actions in the movie with the deleted scenes.  Sadly, some of the brilliant peformances by Bob Hoskins were also taken out.
Some big budget war epics leave you with the impression that the director was out of his league.  Jean-Jacques Annaud does a very good job of keeping the audience in the film and the cinematography is s superb complement to the acting talent.  This is the type of movie that is much more enjoyable with a great theater sound system but it will keep you captivated throughout the film regardless.  The ending was a letdown and almost leaves you with the impression that a test audience decided the outcome as it doesn't seem to fit into the movie.  Still, a good film and one of the better World War II projects in recent years.",998092800,,3251,4.844484629294756
1277687,4,B00003CXRA,"I am not a fan of giving details and spoilers as unfortunately so many others here feel necessary.  Often I felt as though I watched the whole movie already after reading varous reviews.  So please forgive the generic review.
""Enemy at the Gates"" is a very impressive movie.  It is a visual feast.  The acting, plot, beautiful cinematography, and directing are top-notch.  The setting and war scenes are simply amazing.  We really enjoyed this movie very much.
However, there are some minor weaknesses that prevent this picture from reaching EPIC proportion.  The accents of the 'Russians' are .... British, just like the actors.  No attempt was made to have any side speak the authentic language, or at the least, try to have some degree of authenticity by using a russian or German accent.  I was not as moved as I felt I could have been by parts of the story, nor did I feel they developed the Russian story as well as they could have.  Too much emphasis was placed on the love story instead of further developing the intracacies of the Russian 'story', especially in magnitude.  Often, I felt as though there were only 50-100 Russians fighting the entire Russian war.  Stalin was totally avoided in this picture as well as any real politics besides a small handful of people.  I didn't expect a documentary, but I did expect a little more BEEF in this regard.  This could have been an EPIC, however, it is now just a good, entertaining movie.",998092800,3,1446,4.686507936507937
1277688,4,B00003CXRA,"As another reviewer pointed out, it is difficult to decide whether you root for anyone when it's a Hitler versus Stalin match, but the film itself is exceptionally well done. Although the ebb and flow of the battle is lost in the context of the story of the two snipers, the film holds your attention to the end, wondering who will win the game of cat and mouse being played out in the midst of one of history's most horrific battles. The real Hollywood suprise however, was that the dedicated Communist journalist recognizes the moral equivilence of nazism and communism at the end, when it is too late. That in itself is a real shocker.",998092800,,638,4.556521739130435
1277689,4,B00003CXRA,"Based on a true story, this movie attempts to bring the climatic battle of WWII to life--Stalingrad.  1942 was the make or break year for Russian resistance to Hitler.  Defeatism was abundant in the Red Army, they felt they couldn't win.  Being a maniac also, Stalin needed the enemy to be halted at the city bearing his name.
Jude Law plays Vassili, the Russian supersniper who claimed 242 kills at Stalingrad.  Joseph Fiennes is Danilov, the political officer who makes him a star--it seems in real life Danilov really was not terribly involved.  Rachel Weisz is Tani Chernova, another sharpshooter and Vassili's love.  Like many other people, I too had a problem with these British Russians, particularly Weisz--I kept waiting for Brendan Fraser and a mummy to show up.
The love story between Tani and Vassili is out of place in this film.  Perhaps we were shown to understand that even love can flourish in the worst of conditions.  The sex scene does seem terribly out of place.
Ed Harris is Major Koning, sent from Berlin to hunt Vassili down.  In many books I have never found a Major Koning, but rather an SS Colonel Heinz Thorwald who hunted him down.  Take it for what it is, there was a German sniper hunting him so let's not worry about the name.
The cat and mouse game which many seem to dislike is the best part.  It's a struggle between two men, told through their eyes.  The backdrop is impressive, fighting among the ruins of a once great city.  This was some of the most savage fighting of the war and it is accurately depicted.
Some complain about historical inaccuracies---movies will always have them.  The Russians may have been outproducing the Germans, but the supplies weren't reaching the troops.  Guns and ammunition were in short supply at the beginning of the battle, which in when the movie takes place.
The Russians suffered casulties of 750,000 at Stalingrad, the Germans were defeated soundly for the first time and began their march backwards.  Excellent film---pick up a book on Stalingrad and get the full story.",998006400,6,2048,4.775568181818182
1277690,5,B00003CXRA,"The Nazi's are at the height of thier power.  The German army is charging threw the Soviet Union.  The ruins of the city of Stalingrad stands as a symbol of Russia's brave resistance and Hitler's army is determined to capture it.  The hope of the Russians lies on a young sniper named Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law).  Propaganda produced by Vassili's friend Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) turns him into a local hero.  Vassili begins to cause problems for the German army when he targets thier officers.  The Germans dispatch thier best sniper Major Konig (Ed Harris) for the sole purpose of killing Vassili.  The two become locked in a game of cat and mouse that may decide the outcome of the war.
This was a great movie.  It was exciting and tense to watch Konig and Vassili try to outmaneuver each other.  Trap after trap and counter maneuver.  The experience of Konig shows as Vassili begins to doubt himself.  The film also shows the patience and dedication it takes to be a successful sniper.
Paramount has put together a great DVD.  The transfer is perfect.  The audio is excellent and is one of the best DD 5.1 mixes I have heard.

But after watching it on DVD I realised that some of the Hollywood cliches are still there. The acting is pretty incredible from everyone by Weiss. Ed Harris and Jude Law are just excellent as the snipers and convey emotion. Ron Pearlman's breif character is good. Rachel Weiss was flat, dull and for the most part both uninteresting and not needed. The movie loses 2 stars for the following reasons. 1. A boring and typical Hollywood love story that had no place being in the film. 2. The good old Happy Ending. Stalingrad must have been a nightmare of untold proportions. Yet they make sure the ending is a happy one. It would have been far more impactful at the end to have had Weiss character dead and while everyone was dancing and singing Law wandering around wondering what there was to celebrate and of finding out how lonely and unappealing it could be to be a hero. But the happy ending takes away any real need for us to think. Overall it is a film worth owning if for no other reason than Ed Harris.",997920000,3,1103,4.438423645320197
1277752,5,B00003CXRA,"Of the many essential films to the WW2 story,this crucial example of reality during a time of combat fully demonstrates the virtues of the hero-factor,in the case of the story's young soldier that must show his people hope in the ways of a combat-a combat that would bring the ultimate challenge of fear not to his opponent but to himself. This extraordinary release of the millenium not only shows a willing justifiable plot but brings us an almost uncomparable reunion of cinema's best men for the job. Starting the cast with Ed Harris,we see the expectation given to his 'hunter' soldier by the film's cause,and learn that the man resembles the brilliance of 'From Russia with love's s.p.e.c.t.r.e assazin Red Grant which in 1963 was powerfully portrayed by the late Robert Shaw(1927-1979),but Harris' entry holds a touch of heroism,comparable to Jude Law's soviet. Adding up to this level of irony given by Harris we are given another truely great presence Bob Hoskins portraying a crucial Nikita Krushchev. Hoskins is truely admirable in this film as well as the common war element or gift shown by Harris,as well as a great directing chore given by Jean-Jacques Annaud. Even though the film displays newcomer actors Jude Law,Joseph Fiennes,and Rachel Weisz as the stars,Harris and Hoskins through the 'backup' talent of Annaud really give proffessionalism to the film. Fabulous,extraordinary video presentation,but mostly worth buying for the two men that are simply worth watching in combat.",997920000,,1498,5.194214876033058
1277753,4,B00003CXRA,"I have studied the Eastern Front for many years, and finally there is a movie I can see about it.
The opening scenes, especially on the young Red Army soldiers cross the Volga river into the battlefield, were both realistic and visually stunning; which painted a gruesome and grandiose picture of all the books I have read regarding the battle of Stalingrad.  Another strength about the movie is that it showed the tremendous sacrifice and suffering of Russian soldiers who fought on despite tremendous casualty from German fire and NKVD (Soviet State Security forces) executions.
I think this film has brilliantly captured the fact that however much the Soviet press in WWII played up the propaganda about personal heroism during the war, the authorities had a total lack of respect for individual lives. According to Antony Beevor's book on Stalingrad, Chuikov, the commander of the Red Army in Stalingrad that disappointingly did not show up in this film, was quoted as saying ""Every man must become one of the stones defending Stalingrad.""  Perhaps the real horror of the battle of Stalingrad was that Russian soldiers were used as discardable weapons in order to defeat the enemy, which utimately saved the world from Nazi domination.
The cinematography of the duel between two snipers (Ed Harris and Jude Law) was very good, but I believe too much time was spent on this theme.  I did not care for the love story that kind of got stuffed into the movie perhaps to soften up the hard edges of battle.  As a war movie, ""Eenmy at the Gates"" have some obvious weak spots. However, overall I am just very happy to see a well-produced movie on one of the most decisive battles of the Eastern Front, and hope that more films will be made regarding this subject in the future.",997920000,47,1774,4.787581699346405
1277754,3,B00003CXRA,"""Enemy at the Gates"" brings to the screen a realistic depiction of the physical brutalities of war, doing for Stalingrad what ""Saving Private Ryan"" did for Normandy. The recreation is stylish and vivid, but the movie falls considerably short on any emotional connection or lasting impact once the story ends.
The fact that this is a full-force war film does not hinder my interest in it. As a critic, I have come to respect many war films that most people of a general audience would find tedious. The movie begins in such a way, as young Vassili Zaitsev (Jude Law) arrives on the shores of the Volga River leading to a war-torn Stalingrad. German bomber planes swoop down like vultures on the small transports crossing the river, and a stand-off between the German and Russian armies creates a massive amount of intensity and energy.
The recreation is brilliant, but as the movie moves on, its plot begins to hinder. Vassili meets a surviving soldier, Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), whose specialty is propoganda. He uses this to make Vassili a hero in the eyes of soldiers and civilians alike, and soon Vassili is known and hailed by all he meets, including the strong-willed female soldier Tania Chernova (Rachel Weisz), and a German sniper who has been sent by the Third Reich to seek out and destroy Vassili.
It is here that the disinterest heightens. The movie becomes a cross stitch of cat-and-mouse scenes and an out-of-place love story, both of which generate little sparks. Vassili spends his days in hiding, seeking out the man that has been sent to take his life. Some scenes work, such as a scene in which he is cornered by the German with nothing but a small stove to conceal him. But these scenes become plentiful, and the more there are, the less intriguing they become as we await the final payoff.
And after seeing this film, I'm beginning to think that Hollywood is never going to get away with creating a film devoid of a love story. Yes, love stories sometimes work as an emotional outlet for a much bigger event; here, it is unmoving. A scene in which Vassili and Tania make love in the middle of sleeping soldiers makes for little passion, while an exchange of dialogue and kisses before the big finale makes me want to shout, ""There's a war going on.""
All of this is a shame, because director Jean-Jaques Annaud certainly has an eye for an effective war sequence. From our plane's-eye-view of swooping German bombers to large, sudden clouds of dust and smoke filling the air, the dismal and cold atmosphere of war is stunningly portrayed. The bloodshed is high, though does more in the film's favor than against it. War has never been so realistic since ""Saving Private Ryan.""
The cast does commendably well in their parts, though certain characters leave something to be desired. Jude Law is convincing as the stern Vassili, and he shares just enough chemistry with Rachel Weisz so that the love story is believable on a physical level, at least. Joseph Fiennes is enthusiastic as always, but my respect vanished for him by film's end. Ed Harris doesn't say much in the film as the German sniper Konig, and he doesn't have to. His cold looks and rock face make a believer out of us.
I wasn't very interested in the story behind ""Enemy at the Gates."" Somewhere within the depths of its storyline, there is a war epic just screaming to be let out. We get small glimpses of that epic with the intense war images and scenes, but their counterparts are less than interesting. Annaud has created a juggernaut, but I wonder is this is the kind he had in mind.",997833600,3,3572,4.680445151033386
1277755,3,B00003CXRA,"When I went to go see this movie I was expecting something along the lines of an action nonfiction movie about the battle of Stalingrad, and two of the most famous snipers of all time.  I thought they portrayed the Germans in a bad way.  Most Germans in the Wehrmacht in WWII were not Nazis but nice people.  I doubt that Major Konings (the German Sniper) would have hung a child or be caught out in the open by Vassili Zaitsev (the Russian Sniper).  Another thing I did not like was the love story, it interuppted the true Stalingrad and all the Heroes who fought within. One more part was with the Russians.  They had massive artillery amounts which were not revealed in the movie, and were very poor, so they could not afford to forcefully kill one of thier commanders.  Besides that, everything else was very realistic and had many parts of excitement that I enjoyed.  If you are not as closely linked to history as I am, and you do not know as many details, this will be the right action+thriller for you.",997833600,,1010,4.427027027027027

1277757,3,B00003CXRA,"An enjoyable wartime thriller that doesn't quite warrant being kept in my collection.
The cast are generally OK, although the excellent Ed Harris as the Nazi sniper Major Koenig is the only actor who enhances his reputation in this film.  The script is decent, and most of the direction is understated but fine enough.
Some of the Russian characters' accents are slightly dubious, ranging from upper class English (Rachel Weisz) to Cockney (Bob Hoskins, as Khruschev), with Jude Law somewhere in the middle.  Hoskins is miscast, in fact, and I'm not too convinced about Law either.  Nor does he handle a rifle with Harris' assurance.
The sniper confrontations between Law and Harris are very well done, and actually fairly gripping (with excellent use of bomb-damaged Stalingrad), but the film occasionally get bogged down in earnest scenery-chewing sections of emotional turmoil.  Added to this is James Horner's sub-Titanic music score, with an annoying wordless female chorus occasionally intruding to let us know that something momentous is happening on screen in case we miss it.
Technically the film is very well made, with fine use of CGI effects to conjure up awe-inspiring images of war-torn Stalingrad.
The DVD itself is first rate: the 2.35:1 anamorphic transfer is flawless, and one of the best I've seen.  The extras include 2 reasonable featurettes and an above average trailer.
To sum up, worth seeing but I'd recommend sampling before buying.",997660800,4,1458,5.187234042553191
1277758,3,B00003CXRA,"***1/2  Jean-Jacques Annaud's &#8220;Enemy at the Gates&#8221; opens with an extended sequence depicting the 1942 Siege of Stalingrad that is almost as impressive, in its size, scope and battleground realism, as the Normandy Invasion scene in &#8220;Saving Private Ryan.&#8221;
Although &#8220;Enemy at the Gates&#8221; never again returns to this level of greatness, it does emerge as a pretty decent war movie, nonetheless.  The film is based on the true story of a Soviet marksman, Sergeant Vassili Zaitsev, who finds himself - as much through fate and the efforts of an officer friend of his as through any act of bravery on his own part - suddenly thrust to the forefront as a national hero, a position created to bolster the fading morale of the Russian troops who are, at that moment, being mercilessly pounded by the German war machine.  So famous &#8211; and, thus, so much a threat to German security - has Vassili become, that the Germans have even sent their greatest sniper, Major Konig, to find and dispatch him.
Thus, the film becomes at times a fascinating depiction of a cat-and-mouse duel of wits between two evenly matched antagonists both bent on the same outcome.  Ed Harris plays Konig with all the steely-eyed intensity of a bloodthirsty killer, as much driven by his need for personal triumph as his love of the greater cause.  In contrast, Vassili is portrayed as an almost reluctant hero, a man who would gladly relinquish the burden placed on him if circumstances could be different.  Part of the fascination of his character rests in the struggle Vassili undergoes as he tries to reconcile the heroic image of himself as portrayed in the newspapers with the all-too-human man of flesh and blood he knows himself to be.  Jude Law, despite his grating and wholly anachronistic English accent, underplays his role nicely, as does Joseph Fiennes, as Commissar Danilov, the Marxist idealist who comes up with the plan of turning Vassili's acts into the stuff of legend.
In addition to covering an aspect of World War II that has long gone untouched by moviemakers until now, &#8220;Enemy at the Gates&#8221; provides us with an interesting plot - even though, at 130 minutes, it does tend to fall into a dramatic monotony every now and then.  Furthermore, the film is saddled with a romantic triangle of such surpassing banality that it threatens to reduce the movie in the final scenes to as great a pile of rubble as those we see so skillfully created by the set designer.  Speaking of which, the single greatest element of this film is clearly its meticulously mounted imagery of both chaotic battle scenes and the burned out remains of a devastated war torn city.  Kudos go out to all the film's technical people, its production designer, art directors, set decorator, editors, cinematographer, special effects technicians etc.  They have done a truly monumental job on this film.  Only James Horner's score turns out to be a bit problematic, since the first ten or so notes of the recurring main theme sound exactly like John Williams' work from &#8220;Schindler's List.&#8221;
Yet, &#8220;Enemy at the Gates,&#8221; though not a perfect film, has much to offer in terms of its plot, its performances and, above all, its grand visual style.  For that last aspect alone, the film should not be missed.",997574400,13,3328,4.953321364452424

Although technically proficient, the film was not the least bit compelling and the characters motives are as blurry as a stained glass.

1277760,4,B00003CXRA,"Enemy a the gates is a very good movie. However it lacks in some of the aspects of a great film. for a war movie it is great. It contains lots of action, and it takes place all in Russia, a very seldom looked at front. It's the true story of Vassili Zaitsev of Russia, snipering off the German army. Then the Nazis send thier leading marksman to kill him. It contains a love story between Vassili and another woman sniper, which was a little weak. This is definatly a good war film, but seems to lack the emotion that films like ""Saving Private Ryan"" seem to capture.

1277820,3,B00003CXRA,"'Enemy at the Gates' is a solid sniper movie. It is set in World War II, and told from a Russian perspective. All the main characters are Russian, and their primary adversaries are the Germans, who want to take over their cities. Standard WWII stuff.
  Jude Law plays Vassili, a young Russian sniper who excels at what he does, and has become a sort of folk hero for his people. Ed Harris is Konig, a German officer, also adept at sniping, sent to kill Vassili, thus quashing the Russian spirit. A game of cat & mouse is afoot, and it is adequately played out.
  The film has a stirring beginning not unlike the heavy introduction of ""Saving Private Ryan"" - a raging battle is afoot. It is quite graphic, as artillery shoots into people's heads, body parts fly everywhere, and bullets riddle the brave. After that somewhat vivid bit of cinema, things settle down, and we get to know the characters better. Vassili meets a young newspaper man, played by Joseph Fiennes, who helps turn him into an instant legend. Rachel Weisz plays Tania, Vassili's love interest. There develops somewhat of a love triangle, which basically just serves as filler space. All the while, Konig is setting traps to lure Vassili into a showdown.
  'Enemy at the Gates' is acted and directed well. The cinematography is ripped straight from ""Saving Private Ryan"", and adds an overall *gritty* feel to the picture. The plotting is well-paced. The sniper scenes between Vassili and Konig are effectively tense.
  I am aware, through research, that this film is not quite historically accurate. I do not mean to be callous, but I usually don't mark that against a movie. Movies really aren't here to be history books, they're here to tell an interesting, emotional story. I have rarely seen a picture, based on real events, which truly captures exact facts - no mistakes. 'Enemy at the Gates' makes for engaging cinema, and is done suitably well. It is not groundbreaking, but it is not meant to be. It is a solid sniper flick.",997142400,11,2000,4.727011494252873
1277821,5,B00003CXRA,"A must for one's war movie collection. If you liked Saving Private Ryan you will love this one. Set during the battle of  Stalingrad, Enemy At The Gate shows the brutal conflict of the eastern front. A great addition to anyones war movie collection.",997142400,2,249,4.659090909090909
1277822,2,B00003CXRA,"I'd been waiting for the release of this film for more than a year and I was completely frustrated with it when I finally saw it. The film does not do the least bit of justice to the actual fighting that took place in and around Stalingrad. There is not a hint of the suffering that millions experienced there. In the city itself, we see the Soviet troops drinking and singing every night as if they're out for the happy hours after work.
Just like many other big-budget movies, Enemy at the Gates is made up of modules. There is a love story, there is personal rivalry for the affection of the female character,  a parallel personal rivalry between two snipers, etc. There are only winners and losers, heroes and villains, or at best synthetic Hollywood characters.
By the way, even though the story between Zaitsev and the German sniper is legendary, Anthony Beevor, the author of ""Stalingrad - The Fateful Siege"" says there is not a single mention of it in the archives, even though the slightest incident involving the sinpers was recorded by the Soviets for propaganda purposes. (In the 10-hour documentary ""Russia's War"", Zaitsev makes an appearance as an old man and retells the same story, though.) And also, Krushchev being sent there by Stalin to get things straight is utterly inaccurate historically.
If you're interested in not just another Hollywood movie but some insight as to how people lived through the siege under such extraordinary conditions, I highly recommend Vassily Grosmann's novel ""Life and Fate"", centered around the fighting in Stalingrad. As a Soviet war journalist, he spent a long time in the city during the siege and knew many of the leading snipers, including Zaitsev, personally.
Lastly, The Soviet regime had a liking for glorifying superhuman amounts of work done by industrial workers before the war. The most famous such worker is Stakhanov, a miner who allegedly produced in a day an output equal to that his whole work team would produce in a week (or something like that). ""Socialist competition"", as it was called, then spread around the country with reports of how much coal a certain Ivan extracted in a certain coal mine every day in the newspapers. During Stalingrad, the same idea applied to snipers. The competition among snipers for the greatest number of Germans killed was reported with relish in the Red Army newspaper handed out to the troops. In short, Zaitsev was not the only sniper, nor did he actually kill the most. But he was the most well-known, for some reason.
I give the film 2 stars because however frustrating it is, it was interesting to see the ruined city recreated. And the river-crossing scene at the beginning is also stunning.",997142400,6,2702,4.848484848484849
1277823,2,B00003CXRA,"I was so excited to sit down and watch what I thought was going to be a recreation of one of the most important duels not only in WWII but in any war. However, after sitting through this two-hour plus movie, I was more disappointed than anything. Half the movie is building up a love story that frankly has nothing to do with what happened during this historical event. It drags the movie and was insulting to a historian like myself.
Secondly, If you are going to base a movie on a historical event, the least the director could do is get the ending correct.  Instead of making a partially correct ending so he or she could ad some Hollywood flare.
Finally, I just couldn't get serious about a war movie where Germans are speaking English. This was a big factor in my displeasure of the movie.
Overall, for those who know nothing about the historical background of the movie, you just might enjoy it. Those looking for a solid war movie, might get disappointed by the non-stop inclusion of scenes dedicated to building up the love story. It's unfortunate that such a great true life story had to be butchered, one day maybe someone will get it right.",997142400,,1151,4.507177033492823

It depicts neither the character, nor the spirit, nor the soul, nor the mindset of the people. Forget the real events and characters. It is about an imaginary people invented by hollywood.
This pure fantasy-fiction farce presents a medley, in one bowl, of situations taken from different places and periods of the war, an ignorant-tourist gift set like balalaika, nesting doll, bottles of vodka (glass bottles in the trenches?), and, of course, typical western fare of ""Russian"" ""cannon fodder for the officers"". Also, the Russians are to blame themselves for the massacre in the territories occupied by the Nazis and the loss of soldiers on the front.
This continued hollywood trip along the path of rewriting the history of the war more than fifty years after its end is an insult. It is not about my grandparents who fought in the war since the first day of it.",996624000,15,975,4.951219512195122
1277825,4,B00003CXRA,"This film is one of the first films ever sold to a primarily American audience about the Soviet Front in WW2. In that regard it is an important film. Although the American involvement in the war has been greatly documented in countless films (starting even during the war, with 1942's ""Bataan"", and reaching up to now with the recent release of ""Pearl Harbor"") the ""Great Patriotic War"" as it was remebered in the former USSR, has largely been ignored by Hollywood and the Western media in general.
It is on the Russian Front that the hitherto undefeated German war machine finally met its match. The incredible saga of the German invasion of Russia in the summer of 1941, until the final, devastating defeat of Germany and Nazism in the spring of 1945 is a factual subject that, if it were a work of fiction, would put J.R.R. Tolkien's works to shame.
This particular movie is about a very personal duel within the context if the battle of Stalingrad, a mammoth battle which consumed the entire German Sixth Army. (numbering nearly a quarter of a million men) A Soviet sniper named Vassily Zaitsev, (Jude Law) whose roots are from a poor, Siberian herding family is quietly and efficiently killing off large numbers of German officers. A political commisar (Joseph Fiennes) witnesses one instance where Zaitsev single-handedly kills five German officers and decides to use Zaitsev as a propagnada example of how the Russian soldiers should be.
As Zaitsev's kills continue to rack up and his fame and notoriety become more and more widespread, the German high command decides to send their own master sniper to deal with the Russian. Their answer is the commander of their own elite sniper school in Berlin, a Major Koenig (wonderfully played by Ed Harris). As the two antagonists become aware of each other's presence, their duel becomes one of personal survival and conflict, more and more detached from the larger battle raging around them.
In a twist in the plot, there is a Russian boy, named Sascha, who ""helps"" both Major Koenig and Zaitsev, pointing out places where the other is likely to be and where the other likes to stalk his prey. There is also a love triangle between Zaitsev, a female soldier (Rachel Weisz - ""The Mummy"") and Danilov the political commisar (Fiennes).
All in all, this was an excellent movie, but did not make a truly lasting impression on me like other classic war movies, such as Saving Private Ryan, Full Metal Jacket, and Apocalypse Now.",996624000,,2474,4.837264150943396

1277827,5,B00003CXRA,"This is perhaps the best WWII film I've seen this year, even better than Pearl Harbor I must add!
Jude Law's portrayal of Sergeant Vassili is so real, you could feel his determination and courage in fighting the seemingly lost cause of Fatherland Stalingrad in his eyes.
The cinematography of the movie is brilliant thanks to Jean-Jacques Annaud's eye for details. The head-on battle confrontation between the Nazis and the Russians is brilliant and the part where Russian soldiers turning back in fear were shot by their own officers shows the desperation and suffering one has to endure to save a country's freedom.
Joseph Fiennes also put up a great performance as Commissar Danilov who falls for the same woman as Vassili. Ed Harris' portrayal of Nazi Major Erwin Konig is a cunning and worthy nemesis of Vassili.
The sniper scenes where Vassili singlehandedly kills 6 soldiers in the Nazi ""Showering"" scene were impressive and also the part in the ruined factory when Vassili managed to escape Major Erwin's attention with the help of a glass' reflection was also well choreographed.

1277889,1,B00003CXRA,"I saw this movie at a movie theater. I was excited because I had been waiting for hollywood to make a movie about the Eastern Front. Cross of Iron is great, but I wanted a modern interpretation. The first, oh, 10 minutes may be more poignant than SPR's first 20, as the untrained, panicky recruits, complete with Jude Law, go across the Volga in barges and then attack a German position, many without rifles. This is the most realistic part of the movie. Basically all of the men are senselessly slaughtered, as in what really happened. Then everything goes to hell. For one thing, they make it seem like this duel between the two snipers decides the fate of the great Battle of Stalingrad. The thing is, however many kills snipers rack up, they are not battle winners. The standard infantry is, as they can defend and take positions. It would have been so much interesting if they have concentrated on the standard infantry, not the snipers. It's like there's nothing else happening, and these two guys are just duking it out. So unrealistic. I thought that at least IN THE CONDITIONS OF STALINGRAD, THE FILTH, THE VERMON, THE IMPENDING DEATH, we wouldn't have a cheesy romance. ... The lovey dovey degrades everyone's intelligence. The very last thing on a soldier's mind in those conditions is [romance].  ...",996105600,6,1312,4.754385964912281
1277890,5,B00003CXRA,"Yes, the plot of this movie is fiction.  Zietzev arrived in Staligrad an accomplished sniper with a well-equipped Siberian division, for instance.  However, there are a number of reviews attacking the believability of this fiction that are quite off.</p>
First:  Front line romance.  It happened in the Red Army, and not rarely.  The Soviet Union went so far as to lift the ban on abortions for service women (if they so chose) so they could continue to fight.  While the love story is certainly not the best written ever (Two men see one woman who sees them back.  DING - love triangle.), it doesn't detract from the realism of the story.</p>
Second: Snipers navigating wound the city undetected by the enemy.  Hundreds of snipers on both sides did.  Granted, as a sniper you were MUCH more likey to die than your comrades, but but the ones who survived did so by getting close to the enemy and getting away.  In Stalingrad, there weren't any ""lines"" for them to go through either.  People from both sides would often assume an area to be secure only to find themselves surrounded, on the ""front line"" or being the lines.  One night, while celebrating for having fought their way to within sight of the Volga (and assuming the battle to be won) some 200 german soldiers were picked off by Soviet fire from the surrounding buildings.  You could get through (like Zietzev), or you could get unexpectedly killed (like his first kills).</p>
The movie is definitely historical fiction, but it's fiction that is very true to the truth of the events.</p>",995932800,4,1548,4.752808988764045
1277891,5,B00003CXRA,"Historians (eg AJP Taylor) occasionally remind us that the Second World War was essentially a war between Germany and Russia.  That was where WWII was won and lost; the rest was not side-show, by any means, but the Russian front was where Nazism was defeated.  And yet in the movies, until now, ""the Russian front"" has never figured except as the end-of-film punishment for the Nazi officer or soldier, vicious or comically bumbling according to stereotype.
This film's best moments come in the beginning, with a horrific battle scene, in which the utter inumanity of both sides is made clear.
To their own officers the Russian soldiers are cannon fodder, no more.  As they go in to face the Germans their officer shouts (possibly the only training they have had): ""The man with the rifle shoots.  When the man with the rifle dies, the man behind picks up the rifle.  The man with the rifle shoots.  When the man with the rifle dies... "" and so on, over and over.  Soldiers who panic are shot by their own officers.  The only way out for these soldiers is death, and it is a terrible way to die.
The film first focuses on a young Russian soldier, a peasant who has developed a marksman's eye shooting wolves on his grandfather's farm.  Though wounded, he is able to kill a number of German officers.  In doing so he gains the friendship of a young Commissar, who uses him as a propaganda weapon, to give the Russian side hope and a symbol, in a war they have so far been losing.  The scenes between Jude Law as the marksman, and Ralph Fiennes as the Commissar work well, showing the knife-edge of cynicism and service involved in such deals.  And Bob Hoskins is superb as Nikita Kruschev, sent by Stalin to stiffen resolve at the front.  Hoskins plays Kruschev as an amiable thug, with a certain charm to go with his utter ruthlessness, which is perhaps not far wrong.
The film actually works best when dealing with a grand scale and a larger canvas.  When it narrows down to deal with a (slightly contrived) duel between the Russian sniper and a German expert brought in to kill him, it loses some of its power.  It does the sniper duel extremely well, and it is an entertainng and intelligently presented duel.  But it personalises a conflict which was above all an impersonal one.  The fate of individuals in a bloody conflict could still have been presented, without this loss of the large picture.
On the other hand, the love story was well presented and credible; life does go on, even in a city reduced to rubble, still being defended though hardly one brick or stone stood upon another.
Jerry Hopkins' score is also worth singling out: often a pastiche of Prokoffiev, and in particular (and quite appropriately) _Alexander Nefsky_, it manages an impressive grandeur in the larger set-pieces, as well as considerable lyricism in the more personal scenes.
This could have been a classic film; it is not quite that.  It is, however, a very good film, well and intelligently made, and interesting even for its flaws.  Recommended.
Cheers!

Perhaps if you have yet to see it, you're thinking ""well jeez, this is a movie about a bunch of Russians and I'm supossed to be on THEIR side?"" But believe me, you will be.  As is known, soldiers of war are fighting the same battle no matter which country they happen to be from.  A book keeper from London could be shooting at a journalist from Berlin and, not knowing, the two would still think the other as a life long enemy.  This movie explains that...along with exceptional filming skills. Jude Law plays Vassili - just a soldier from Russia who happens to be a sniper to perfection.  He is new to war, but is ready to fight for what he believes in.  Even when events such as only every other soldier in a line obtaining a rifle while the other odd men get the bullits and are told ""WHEN the soldier with the rifle dies, pick it up and continue fighting."" He eventually meets up with journalist Danilov (Shakespere in Love) who builds up Vassili into a Russian hero in order to provide hope to the people of their country. Along the way, they meet up with Tania (The Mummy) and both fall in love with her, yet it seems she falls hardest for Vassili.  All thw while, Nazi Sniper (Ed Harris) is given orders to stop this ""hero"" from Russia in order for them to win the war.  He uses the likes of a child to get to him and it'll make you sick enough to want to kill Ed Harris, despite the amazing man he is in real life - that's how good he plays this character.

1277894,4,B00003CXRA,"I just came from viewing this movie at the theatre last night. On the plus side, the director did an excellent job of capturing the essence of the hell on Earth that was Stalingrad. The acting, for the most part, is very good (although I thought Ed Harris was a little wooden as the German marksman Maj. Konig), and the special effects were outstanding. Having read the book before seeing the movie, I was impressed by how realistic the sets were, even if, to make the story more interesting, some liberty was taken with the historical facts, a la ""Braveheart"". (For example, the young informant Sasha is hung by Maj. Konig in the movie when, in reality, the boy was hung by the Germans near the end of the battle, months after Konig's death. Also, in reality, Zaitzev's love interest, Tanya, was herself an accomplished sniper, killing over 70 Germans.)
On the downside, the script incorporates a wholly non-essential ""Love triangle"" that, I thought, detracted from the film and made it somewhat slow in places, much like ""Pearl Harbor"".

1277898,2,B00003CXRA,"Finally, we have a Hollywood produced film with a story based on a major battle on the Eastern Front of WWII. However, please note that this is a film based on fiction only. Though Vasily Zaitsev was a real person and a formidable Russian sniper at Stalingrad, there is no existing documentary proof that any German sniper was specially assigned and sent from Berlin to annihilate him (you may call that ""legendary"" German sniper Wehrmacht Major Konig or Konings or SS Colonel Thorwald or whatever name he was given) and that the duel between him and that German specialist sniper had ever taken place. That story behind the duel was based entirely on Soviet propaganda which glorified the superhuman prowess of the Red Army. The battle of Stalingrad was a catastrophe for the Germans caused by Hitler's blunder. However, it was not the turning point of WWII in Europe as such. The true turning point was the battle of Moscow after which it was no longer militarily possible for Germany to defeat the Soviet Union and the only chance of winning the war for Germany had been thrown away. How could or would you expect the Soviet Union or Stalin ""to save the world"" by holding on at Stalingrad and defeating the Germans there when the Soviet Union was as evil an empire as the Third Reich? Stalin was no better if not much worse than Hitler in the treatment of his own citizens and his ambition to propagate Communism throughout the world. (Please refer to the famine in Ukraine in the 1930s, the Nazi Soviet Pact in 1939, the Soviet annexation of the 3 Baltic states and the invasion of Finland in 1940). The film was well made with great special effects and the scene of the transferring of troops across the Volga river was spectacular. The setting of the film resembled very much the true battlefield of Stalingrad. That was very impressive. However, more emphasis should have been placed on the battlefield on a grand scale and the fighting spirits and sufferings of soldiers of both sides instead of the duel itself. Snipers per sec do not and cannot win a war. The ordinary foot soldiers should deserve the credit. That is particular true for the battle of Stalingrad.",993945600,3,2173,4.706036745406824

The duel between the snipers was good but because we have to sit through all the ""love interest"" parts the duel becomes overly long and towards the end you just want one of them to get shot so it will be over.  Finally, when we do get to the climax of the duel it is heavily dipped in Hollywood instead of ending it the way it is written in the histories.

The film didn't show how the duel was affecting other people, and it didn't show how Zeitsev represented the Allies and Koenigs represented the Nazis. To show how the situation really happened, the director needed to add these things to show people how much the victory of their side's sniper mattered to them. After Zeitsev killed Koenigs, the Allies showed that they weren't going to give up, and ultimately won the Battle of Stalingrad. I also think that at the end when Koenigs was killed at close range took away from the fact that they were both expert snipers, and Zeitsev had shown that he could beat the enemy in the area they thought they had the least trouble in.",993254400,,862,4.677631578947368
1277953,4,B00003CXRA,"When I read ""Enemy at the Gates"" in 1982 I though about the wonderful thing that would be to see a movie about the battle of Stalingrad which I have been thoroughly studying for more than a decade. A pleasant surprise came with ""Enemy at the Gates"" directed by the French director Jean-Jacques Annaud. Even though I was a bit disappointed because of the single perspective of the movie (the movie only focuses in the duel between a German officer former hunter from the Black Forest and a Russian -Siberian- sniper). Conversely Craig's book tells many terrible - however fascinating- personal stories from Russians, Italians and Germans survivors of the battle who were still alive at the time of its first edition (the book was written in the early sixties after five years of research). I would have liked to see these personal accounts recreated in the movie.
My critic also goes in a similar way to that I made to ""Saving Private Ryan"". With the exception of the time devoted to Ed Harris -the german sniper- this is more or less a one-sided view of the battle and here Annaud losses a great opportunity. Anyway this is a film that I strongly recommend not only to those who like me have beed interested in the battle of Stalingrad during a life but specially to the young people. They must know about this madness and realize that without two dictators (Hitler and Stalin), this tragedy would never happened.",993168000,,1413,4.701612903225806

Besides there aren't 2 books out there that agree on a lot of the details either so who knows.........  I would have liked to have seen the ending of the sniper battle done a little more historically and the love triangle plot line detracted more than added to the story but  over all it is a great movie.  The other thing going for this movie is that it helps to show the American audience that there was more to WWII than the US vs Ger. or the US vs Japan.

1277956,5,B00003CXRA,"About a year ago I had to do a school project on a book of my choosing, and I read the book ""Enemy at the Gates"", about the battle of Stalingrad from 1942 to 1943.  I found this book to be enthralling and would have rated it 5 out of 5.  I was absolutely thrilled to find out that it was being made into a movie, but from the beginning I knew there would be trouble.  First of all, the story:  Enemy at the Gates (the book) is about the battle of Stalingrad during the winter of 1942-43 when Adolf Hitler turned his attention toward the city of Stalingrad in the Caucasus on the southern steppes of Russia.  The war between Russia and Germany by this time had lasted for 1 year.  Although the city of Stalingrad held no strategic importance, if Joseph Stalin lost the city which held his name, he, along with the rest of Russia, would be devastated.  Adolf Hitler assigned General Paulus' 6th army to take the city, and in August of 1942 the 6th army attacked.  By October they had cleared the whole city, save the Northern factory district, off all resistance.  It seemed the battle was over, all the Germans had to do was clear that district and the day was theirs.  But the Northern Factory District was on the West bank of the Volga river, across that river there were no Germans, only Russians, and so the Russians ferried across entire armies straight into battle. Autumn wore on into Winter, the thing the Germans had learned to dread from the appalling losses at the battle for Moscow in the winter of 1941.  German equipment wasn't meant to take the brutal cold of ""General Winter"", engines froze up, guns jammed, men died.  On the other hand, the Russian tanks were designed to operate in sub-zero conditions, Red Army soldiers were equpped with Winter clothing. The tide turned.  Slowly the Russians pushed out of the factory district and forced the Germans back.  Russian armies reach around and encircle the 6th army on the steppe by early December 1942.  On Christmas day the Russian bear attacks the beleaguered men of the 6th army, by late January 1943 the 6th army is virtually destroyed, in early February Field Marshal Paulus and his staff surrender, the battle is over.  The difference between the book and the movie is that the book focuses on the entire battle, while the movies focus is on the duel between the two top snipers, the Russian Vassili Zaitsev and the German Major Koenig.  This angered me slightly because there were so many classic movie shots which could have been achieved in the book.  I also noticed two mistakes in the movie. First of all, Major Koenig wasn't killed in the open, he was shot while still under the scrap metal. This I think was the biggest sacrifice for movie moments over historical accuracy.  Also, in a few scenes you see Russian tanks which appear to be either T-34/85s, KV-85s, or JS-2s, yet these tanks were not developed until late '43 or '44.  But these flaws were redeemed by the fantastic action sequences and amazing sounds and computer imaging.  I found the movie thrilling and wonderful and, out of 10, I would give it a 9.5.  Great job Annaud.",992304000,10,3115,4.574774774774775
1277957,4,B00003CXRA,"This is a well-made, well-acted, and powerful film. That said, a few observations:

Vassily Zaitsev, the hero of this film, certainly existed in reality. Tania Chernova, the Rachel Weisz character, may have existed, though there are enough inconsistencies in the stories about her to make one doubt. But the German supersniper who was supposedly sent to Stalingrad to find and kill Zaitsev is almost certainly fictional. There's nothing in German or Soviet archives to establish his existence. The aged and blind Vassily Zaitsev apparently recalled only that he and another Soviet sniper had together killed a German sniper at Stalingrad, not that there had been a supersniper sent to kill him, that the two had stalked each other, etc. Further-as the film tells us very clearly-Zaitsev was played up in Soviet wartime propaganda, which was not noted for its scrupulous truthfulness, and it seems that such material is the source of the ""snipers' duel"" story.

It's doubtful that, at the stage of the war shown in this film, so many Soviet troops had to be forced to the front at gunpoint, or that Soviet generals would have launched the imbecilic human wave attacks shown at the beginning of the movie.

The preternatural skill of Major Koenig, the German sniper, is powerfully conveyed. Purists will object that nobody in history has been THAT good a shot, or anything close to it.

Rachel Weisz is such an extraordinarily appealing actress that one overlooks the absurdities in how her character is written. The Tania Chernova of this film (not to mention Ms Weisz herself) seems far too sweet, soft, and humane to be the bloody-minded fanatic that an actual woman would have had to be to volunteer for sniper duty in the hell of Stalingrad. The filmmakers have even turned her into an intellectual Germanophile who reads Goethe, etc. Come now.

Joseph Fiennes' handsome, cultured, and sensitive political officer is also a gross implausibility, though I didn't notice this until after the film was over.

Bob Hoskins appears briefly but memorably as Nikita Khruschev; his vulgar and murderous beast reminds one of his Beria character in the excellent THE INNER CIRCLE (which BTW REALLY needs to come out on DVD).

Michael Medved detested James Horner's musical score. I found it very effective, though Horneresque-but what else should one expect Horner to sound like?

One perhaps eccentric observation.  The name of the German supersniper in the movie is ""Koenig."" However, in other sources the name is given as ""Thorwald"" or ""Thorvald."" This is also the last name of the Raymond Burr character in Hitchcock's REAR WINDOW. The struggle in that film, depending as it does upon spyglass spying, reminds one oddly of the snipers' duel in ENEMY AT THE GATES, and one wonders whether whoever wrote the script for the Hitchcock film knew the fable of the Stalingrad snipers.",992044800,,2873,5.031578947368421
1277958,3,B00003CXRA,"well another movie that believes in wartime romance being more important than wartime facts.if you want to watch a more interesting foreign movie about stalingrad see the german made, subtitiled movie ""Stalingrad"" by the same people that brought us ""Das Boot"". it is a much more compelling movie that shows the  utter waste, pain, and randomness of war, and doesn't sugar coat or glamorize either side. while the look of ""enemy"" is good, some of the cgi is unrealistic looking, especially the bombing by the german Ju 88's. i was looking forward to a movie that showed the great patriotic war {as it was known by the russians}  i was dissapointed in the genericness of this film {Saving private sniper}. little of the ruthlessness of the nkvd and the commisars was dealt with after the opening of the movie, the fact is russians knew that they were most likely to die one way or the other, either at the hands of the germans or their own security people. to protect their famillies {who were also at risk from motherland} it was the fate of common as well as officers of the red army to fight without thought of their own well being. we in the west cannot begin to imagine the ultimate between the rock and the hard place these poor people were in. hopefully someone will make a movie about the real thing and have it in a language we can understand.",991958400,3,1350,4.551440329218107
1277999,5,B00003CXRA,"As a general rule, I don't see war movies in the theater, but my husband took me to this one because he was interested in the sniper-aspect of the story. I was glad he did, because I was spellbound all the way through the movie. This movie was about a Russian boy-soldier, Vasilli (Jude Law) who happens to be an excellent sniper. He saves the life of a political propagandist, Danilov (Joseph Fiennes) who then writes up the Vasilli's exploits to encourage the Russian army, and the local Russians, all of whom are being brutalized by Nazi forces. Vasilli quickly becomes a famed hero, and something of a celebrity. No sooner does he kill off most of the Nazi commanders in town, but an infamous Nazi sniper, Major Konings (Ed Harris) comes to hunt him down. The chase is on, and the tension builds steadily. Add Tania, a beautiful female soldier, to the mix, and a love triangle develops between Vasilli and Danilov, further fueling the tension of the film.
This movie had an authentic feel and a good story full of twists. And the acting was great. Jude Law gives a steady performance as Vasilli, and Joseph Fiennes lights up the screen with his passionate and deep Danilov. Ed Harris is intense as usual, and it was nice to see Rachel Weisz in a role that was quite a departure from the comical librarian in The Mummy. Other notable supporting characters: Ron Perlman as Koulikov, and Bob Hoskins as a perfect Nikita Khrushchev.
The look of the film was both lush and spare, perfect for a war movie. The directing was skillful, and the script was great, taking a refreshing non-American view of the Russian fronts of World War II, and avoiding the easy resolutions of many Hollywood movies.
A movie well worth seeing.",991612800,6,1721,4.645901639344262
1278000,4,B00003CXRA,"The first thing this film definitely deserves credit for is the fact that it presents a WWII story from a POV that definitely hasn't been explored enough in film (the Russian perspective).  And this film does so without any strong biases.  It does not try to portray the russian soldiers from an American point of view, for example (although it did have a bit of an underlying commentary on communism).  An American viewer will not feel conscious of the fact that these are Soviet heroes rather than US Army Rangers...they are simply portrayed as protagonists in a desperate conflict.  Stalingrad was a pinnacle point in the war and it really does deserve to have a mainstream film made about it.  As a movie about the battle of Stalingrad itself, this film is good but not great.  The sets are great and the opening battle gives you an idea of just how desperate a situation the Soviet troops were in (and why their valiant efforts at Stalingrad should be tributed).  But on the other hand, I felt that the background information leading up to the battle was overly simplistic.  The extent of the battle was not really portrayed enough either.  After the initial landing scene, the battle of Stalingrad is largely ignored so that the film can focus solely on the sniper battle as if it was the only thing that mattered.  They should have shown more of the large scale warfare and the bloody and hopeless city fighting that went on, as well as how the Germans began losing the upper hand (it's not like it was due entirely to the efforts of one single russian sniper!)  They could also have portrayed the fact that people were starving, rather than having the available resources to sit down and have good meals and parties while they weren't fighting.  Nevertheless, the sniper battles were very well done and the atmosphere was conveyed very well.  I also felt that the plot (about the russian sniper who must bear the unwilling burden of being a heroic symbol for his people, despite his own fears and limitations), made a very touching example of wartime sacrifice.  Sometimes you have no choice but to be a hero, and it is not an easy cross to bear.  I think that the love triangle could have worked, but it really needed to be fleshed out a bit more and the resolution seemed too abrupt, too simple and overly dramatic.  As a result, it hurts the film and gives us the impression that they just HAD to throw in a generic love conflict.  But its not nearly as untolerable as the one in Pearl Harbor though.  Ultimately, the film's main flaws are that it is a bit too conventional and also fails in one or two major areas in successfully telling the Stalingrad story.  If it had been tweaked a bit it would've had potential to be a classic war film along the lines of Saving Private Ryan.  Instead it turns out as a very well executed, albeit conventional war film.  Although not perfect, it still stands high above such useless drivel as ""Pearl Harbor"" and ""The Patriot"".",991526400,3,2976,4.598484848484849
1278001,5,B00003CXRA,"""Enemy at the Gates"" is a great film.  The combat scenes are all excellently choreographed and edited, from the massive opening battle sequences, to all of the tense sniper vs. sniper showdowns in the bombed out ruins of Stalingrad. The opening batttle sequence is shocking in its brutal depiction of World War II's eastern front.
The film shows a new perspective on WW2.  There are no Americans in this film, so you can get a feel of how the struggle against Nazi Germany extended much farther than U.S. casualties.  In fact, the Soviet Union lost close to 50 times more people in the war than the United States did.  That's right, 50 times.  Over one million soldiers lost their lives in the Battle of Stalingrad, which the movie is set in.  That's why I think this movie is informative in showing a new perspective.  It is also goes beyond the typical communist=evil rhetoric that has been so common in U.S. movie making.
The special effects, sound, and cinematography are all excellent, and there is a riveting plot to hold the wathcer's attention.  Of course, I have to discuss the weakness, which is, of course, the love triangle between the film's three main protagonists.  Unnecessary, and it does take away from the power and meaning of the film.
Some have complained about the accents, among other things, of the characters being detrimental to the realism.  You have to realize that this is a film.  Everything can't always be portrayed accurately you know.  Besides, normally the results are not always too pretty when an actor tries to put on an accent that is not their own.  Further, this is not a documentary, it's historical fiction.  Watch it as what it is.",991353600,5,1675,4.750865051903114

1278003,4,B00003CXRA,"As an English Eastern Front enthusiast I was very pleased with Enemy At The Gates.  It lacked in many areas however the fact that the film was made at all can only be a good thing.  With most WWII films coming out of the US or the UK with a very clear bias to them the general public is still convinced the Allies beat the Germans almost single handledly with the Russians playing a minor role.  A film like this addresses this issue and brings to the film-going public's attention the front where the Germans really lost the war and brings home the brutality of the pivotal battle that finally halted their advance.
The script is clearly the work of a non-English speaking European as it lacks realism and on 2 or 3 occasions leaves you cringing.  Although I am English the accents seemed out of place - especially the American actor who plays a Russian sniper putting on a pretty awful Cockney accent.  However the film's action scenes soon overshadow these flaws.  The opening action scene I felt was more compelling, grandiose and spine-tingling than Saving Private Ryan's much heralded opening scene.  While I have read endlessly about the Eastern Front and in particular the Battle of Stalingrad this film gave me a visualisation and a truer picture than I could possibly guess.  The fact that is was also made without a political or a propagandist slant from either protaganist nation in the battle is another plus.
If so many films since 1945 can be made about the North Africa campaign where in a reality only a small number of divisions were involved, I hope that more films can be put into production about this huge and unhumanly brutal battle and indeed about the many battles on the Eastern Front.

1278005,4,B00003CXRA,"After many major Hollywood epics about the war on the Western Front (THE LONGEST DAY, PATTON, A BRIDGE TOO FAR, BATTLE OF THE BULGE, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN), it is long overdue that ENEMY AT THE GATES, centered on the pivotal battle for Stalingrad, should play to audiences ... particularly American audiences.
The core of the plot is the personal duel between two expert snipers, the Red Army's Vasily Zaitsev (Jude Law) and the German Wehrmacht major, Koenig (Ed Harris), the latter brought into the Stalingrad cauldron to kill the former before he totally destroys the morale of the German troops trying to capture the city. It's a cat and mouse confrontation depicted with startling realism, though, in this case, the mouse is just as deadly as the cat. The rest of the film is just window dressing, especially the sappy love triangle between Zaitsev, political commissar Danilov (Joseph Fiennes), and a female Red Army sniper, Tania, played by Rachel Weisz.
The film, set among the rubble and destroyed factories of Stalin's city, is visually stunning. The performances of Law, Harris and Fiennes are excellent, as is that by Bob Hoskins, who plays Joe Stalin's political representative on the scene, Nikita Krushchev. My complaints center on the accents of the main characters, which don't sound Russian by any stretch of the imagination, the previously-mentioned and totally superfluous love story, and the fact that the Krushchev is given way too much screen time at the expense of the Russian general, Chuikov, who doesn't even appear, even though he was the Red Army's military commander whose gritty defense of the city ultimately prevailed.
This story of the duel between Zaitsev and his German nemesis is based in fact, though a better telling of the tale is the work of book fiction, WAR OF THE RATS, by David Robbins. If you're interested in this footnote to the Stalingrad struggle, the book is a ""must"", and the film will serve as excellent visual reinforcement.",990489600,136,1976,5.009118541033435

""Enemy at the Gates"" is a Very Good War film; It has Wonderful Performances All Round, Great Direction, a Good Script and Wonderful Production Values. But Alas, it is Let down by a Lack of Scope. The film seems to have Low Self-Esteem; rarely do I say this about a 2 hour and 26 minute movie, but I Wish it would have been Longer. More Character Development, More Tense Face-offs, More Everything.
The Main Problems with the film are its Overbearing Score; it's Slow and Heavy going Second Act and it's Bare Bones Story, like would-be Epics like ""All the Pretty Horses"" and ""The 13th Warrior"", this film should have had More In It than just a bit of Romance, Great Performances and a few Well Directed Action Sequences.

This movie had some good looking battle sceanes and some well thought out sniper duels, that manage to make the movie watchable and kind of fun.  However, there is a love story that distracts from the meat of the movie, and is poorly held together.  If a movie is going to have a real romance during the bloodiest most brutal battle the world has ever seen, the film is going to have to make some sacrifices on its impact and how it shows the war.  This movie trys to have it both ways, to be a serious movie on the battle of Stalingrad and still have a cheesy love story.  This doesn't work, I didn't believe it, and watching the actors I don't think they really did either.
  Russia really did have female snipers in WWII, and the hero that the movie follows is believed to have had a reltionship with one of them during this battle.  However, the reltionship was never really called a real romance, it was more about a couple of nervous soldiers comforting each other.

The movie goes back and forth between a German leader and an American one as they are both fooled by the same 12-year old, who is trying to help put an end to the brutality. The shooting sequences aren't just there for the sake of gore and blood, but more for the sake of developing battles between professionals who have been there before.
Acting performances were more than impressive for Jude Law, especially, and Ed Harris. They brought a lot of realism to the table and they easily resembled the real soldiers at that time. Sasha, the adolescent who serves as the spy, did a fairly good job. The atmosphere for ""Enemy at the Gates"" is very dreary, similar to ""Gladiator"", but, I think that made it more realistic, such as scenes with the soldiers cooped up together in shelters, almost silent, a few of them talking about how they may never get to see their family again and things of that nature.
