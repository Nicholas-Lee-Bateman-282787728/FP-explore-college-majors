2532887,5,B000ERVJI6,I bought this tape for my grandaughter and she loved it. She is a big Dora fan. She has watched it over and over. Amazon has the best prices around.,1168560000,2,148,3.966666666666667
2532888,4,B000ERVJI6,"This is one of the few Dora DVDs with a Spanish language track (oddly).  It's the same voices as the Spanish version of Dora on TV, so our kids are definitely hooked! (Twins, bilingual boys)

There is lots of Diego on this DVD - and he does weird talking to the animal stuff (might be better in English).

Overall, good stuff",1162425600,24,325,4.295081967213115
2532909,1,B000ERVJI6,"I never got this. I got a completely different dvd. I kept it bc it was a Dora we didn't have, but it was not the one i ordered",1378339200,,127,3.413793103448276
2532910,5,B000ERVJI6,"This is a good video for your children if they like the Dora show.  My son has watched it about a million times, so we definitely got our money's worth.  If your child is not familiar with the show then you may want to catch it on tv first, as some children do not like the show.  Most however do enjoy it.",1374710400,,306,3.903225806451613
2532911,3,B000ERVJI6,I don't really like Dora but the children like her step-by-step problem solving adventures.  The fact that someone or something is always in danger makes the children feel a little anxious sometimes though,1372809600,,205,5.212121212121212
2532912,5,B000ERVJI6,my daughter has been watching this movie non stop since we got it. she loves her dora and this became another one of her favorites!,1361836800,,131,4.28

2532915,4,B000ERVJI6,"All girls of my daugther's age (2 and a half) love dora. She didn't know her until I bought this DVD and now she can see Dora anywhere (in the car, on a portable device...) I also play it very frequently in French and Spanish so it is a great language learning device for bilingual children.

Lots of pros and one only con: It only has four chapters. I wish it had more!",1344556800,,370,4.068493150684931
2532916,4,B000ERVJI6,"My 2 year old daughter loves this cartoon - she watches it non-stop, and it keeps our occupied for good 45 minutes. Also, I think she's learned some Spanish. Overall, a very good purchase, and I would get more Dora cartoons for her.",1316476800,,232,4.4186046511627906

2532919,5,B000ERVJI6,"I bought this for my 2 and 1/2 year old granddaughter.  She loves it and watches it as much as you will let her.  She recently had to make a 4 1/2 hour car trip and was so interested she never made a sound except for interacting with the video. It is well worth the money.  she especially likes swiper when he says ""o man""",1283040000,3,322,3.923076923076923
2532920,1,B000ERVJI6,"I purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my little niece, who loves Dora.  Imagine my surprise as she put the movie in to the DVD player and nothing happened. Her response to me was TE TE why my movie is not playing?  I was just as disappointed as she was to discover on Christmas day that my gift to her was a poor purchase choice.",1261958400,,337,4.014925373134329
2532921,5,B000ERVJI6,You usually can't go wrong with Dora and this DVD is not exception. Cute episodes that all 3 boys enjoy.,1261699200,,104,4.25
2532922,5,B000ERVJI6,"My 2 grandchildren will literally watch Dora over and over. They talk to the t.v. during the interactive segments,and I feel that they actually learn and have fun at the same time-which is rare. They are 3 and 5 years old. This is far and above, a better choice than the cartoons for this age group. So in closing, I do not think that you can go wrong with Dora,but I wish that you could buy the whole season in a boxed set.",1254614400,3,424,4.120481927710843
2532923,5,B000ERVJI6,This DVD is great for teaching toddlers about animals.  I do not let my baby girl watch TV unless its educational.  This DVD is just that.  She stays engaged and has learned a lot.,1243900800,2,180,4.235294117647059
2532924,5,B000ERVJI6,This was our first Dora movie purchase and my son would watch it 24/7 if we would let him.  He is 2 1/2 and I think he has watched it at least once everyday since Christmas.  If your kids like Dora I would highly recommend it.,1231372800,3,226,3.891304347826087
2532925,5,B000ERVJI6,Dora and Diego are leaders in children education. My 4 year old watched all the episodes back to back - something that doesn't happen with any other program aside from Diego.,1229731200,,174,4.645161290322581
2532926,5,B000ERVJI6,"This is my 3 yr old favorite, specially because Diego is included and provides more action with all the animal rescue. This video is great for kids that are interested in animals. Animal adventures has the Spanish Stereo (under set up options). It is ""fantastico"". My three year old is learning at fast speed lots of spanish words (cabra, cascada, animales, corriendo, etc). we love it. The voices are high pitched but eventually you get used to hear them",1214006400,2,455,4.772151898734177

2532928,5,B000ERVJI6,"My three year old daughter loves Dora's videos.  She watches each of them all the time.  They have yet to fail us.  She LEARNS so much from them.  I don't feel as though they are babysitting her.  Instead, they are teaching and entertaining her.  I homeschool my nine year old daughter, and this is a subtle way of homeschooling my three year old.  It is a supplement to her laxed, but effective curriculum.",1168819200,7,407,4.493150684931507

Children love her?  CHECK.  Cant get the songs out of your mind for days?  CHECK  Anything else on tv like it?  -----no check---  Dora is a great little lady.  She offers entertainment for children with no violence, no ""mature"" themes, no sketchy language, and they learn spanish and about ""things"".  Its sad to see some of the things on TV, cartoons are violent, lots of death and destruction.  Dora offers something that parents can trust.  I am very happy to have this, its something that can be played on computer, in car, wherever.  Also, strange as it sounds, this one also has a spanish soundtrack.  I thought the idea was Dora taught spanish.  Anyway, this particular one is in spanish too.  I still have Dora songs in my mind from years ago.  WOW.",1409184000,2,918,4.707006369426751
