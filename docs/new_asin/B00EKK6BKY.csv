8606393,5,B00EKK6BKY,"This is an excellent workout.  It's what I started with when I began using Firm workouts, 15 years ago.  I lost 120 pounds in 18 months without ever dieting.  When I began, using this tape, I was a size 22-24; by the time I was done adding Firm workouts and increasing my weights, I was a size 4-6 and solid muscle and there was nothing I couldn't do.  When I started, I couldn't climb a staircase without stopping to take a breath, but thanks to the Firm, by the time I was fit I thought nothing of riding my bike 20 miles, hiking difficult trails for 8 hours straight, rock climbing, canoeing or kayaking all day - I was unstoppable and it all began with the Firm.

They're not kidding when they say ""results in 10 workouts or your money back""; do any of these workouts 10 times - including this one - and you WILL look and feel different.  As an added bonus, because the exercises (cardio and weights) are all paired for maximum results (for instance, you may work your triceps a lot during one segment; in the next you'll work your biceps as your legs are doing something else), as you get stronger and more fit, you continue to get benefits from even the easier routines.  Even once I was extremely fit, I continued to do this work (although less often than I had at the beginning), but used weights for every aerobics section that didn't include any swinging motions in the arms (risk of damaging your elbow if you swing weights), put up to 10-15 pounds on my shoulders during the squat sections, put weights on my groin for the bridge work and used ankle weights where appropriate.  An excellent workout and an excellent introduction to the kinds of workout the Firm does.  If you're looking to move on to more weights, try to get a copy of the Firm Classic workout Volume 1.  Firm Cardio and Firm Strength also include plenty of weight lifting.  It's just a shame that the company hasn't put all of its classic routines on DVD and that they're charging outrageous prices for the ones that ARE on disc.",1440115200,10,2009,4.432065217391305
8606394,1,B00EKK6BKY,This video is almost all cardio with very little weights. I was disappointed,1404864000,2,76,4.923076923076923
