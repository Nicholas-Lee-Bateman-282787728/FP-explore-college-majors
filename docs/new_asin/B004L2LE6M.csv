Andrews Blu-ray Review: With the film TRON [1982], make sure you've got the popcorn ready popped, a soda in hand, and a comfy seat, because once you enter the grid you won't want to leave, because Walt Disney Productions brings you the ultimate film experience right into your living room and it will definitely not disappoint you. Sadly the film never received critical acclaim at the box office it so deserved, but of course over time it has developed a very strong fan base followings who wish they could enter the Grid. But with this stunning Blu-ray disc release, Disney is not only giving fans the chance to experience a totally unique film again, compared to what I viewed on my inferior DVD release, but the Blu-ray disc also offers you lots of additional entertaining special features for extra enjoyment. What is especially spectacular is at the start of the film where you view totally amazing different colourful graphics and the way they move about the screen you get a near on spectacular 3D visual effect treat that really sets you up for the rest of the film.

This original TRON film was released in the early 1980s, at a time when computers were new and frightening to many, not yet having found a place in peoples homes. TRON was far ahead of its time, predicting a world in which people would interact in cyberspace by way of alternate personas. The film was the first to extensively use computer graphics, seen by Hollywood at the time almost as cheating, with traditional artists and model-makers afraid for their jobs. As with the film today, TRON still stands out as being far ahead of its time. Its CGI special effects may look slightly dated, but one of course must appreciate for its cinematic accomplishments and for general geeky nerds, has kept this film desirable for decades.

TRON is one of those films that brought forth so many new ideas, and did so many things in a different way from anything that came before that its tough to quantify its impact on film. Its novel combination of hand-drawn animation techniques, optical techniques, and computer generated imagery to create a visual representation, accuracy aside, of how the computer world works is something thats permeated pop culture on a scale that is nearly unprecedented. You can see popular elements of TRON in computer games, music videos, TV shows, and even other films.

And yet, even though today its achievements are well known, the film kind of flew under the radar at the time of its release in 1982, making little more than a small splash in a big pond, which is kind of surprising, considering everything it brought to the table. I mean, it was a big special effects science fiction blockbuster, released by a huge company in the post STAR WARS era, starring a relatively well known star in Jeff Bridges. TRON was enthusiastically reviewed by critics too, with endorsements from big named, who gave it a perfect score. I guess the idea of computers being portrayed in such a grandiose way just didn't resonate well with the cinema audiences of the early 1980s. TRON was labelled as a financial disappointment by Disney, and swept it under the rug for nearly thirty years.

That being said, TRON is an excellent film. It follows the exploits of genius programmer Kevin Flynn [Jeff Bridges], a man whos greatest and most profitable achievements have been stolen from him by a less talented co-worker. He spends his free time trying to hack into the system of his former company, designing different computer programs to break into their computer systems to find evidence to return his property to him. Kevin Flynn enlists the help of his friends, who are still programmers who work for that company, to help him break into the computer network from the inside. In an attempt to defend itself, the computers defence system uses a conveniently placed laser device to suck Kevin Flynn into the computer network. There he embarks on an epic quest to defeat the computer program thats trapped him, enlisting the help of the computer programs that have been trapped inside the network, as well as those designed by his friends on the outside, including TRON himself. From there they face lethal computer games, and an army of villainous defence programs that try and stop them from achieving their goal. The story isn't exactly the most ground-breaking, but its strength lies in its execution, which TRON does in a nearly flawless manner.

TRON is an absolute blast from start to finish. Jeff Bridges truly embraces the role of computer programmer turned computer program, bringing an incredibly enthusiastic performance to the role of Kevin Flynn, one that could have easily turned cheesy, or boring in the wrong hands. His supporting cast follows suit, with all-star performances from David Warner as the Master Control Programs right hand man Saark, and Bruce Boxleitner as the hero of the computer world, and the title character TRON. You can tell that this cast really enjoyed making this film, as there is a lot of passion that is presented throughout the film that you view on your TV screen. Their performances are accompanied by an appropriately 1980s techno sounding synthesized soundtrack, and while its incredibly fitting, it definitely enhances the enjoyment of the film, especially in the dramatic computer battle scenes.

TRON is a visual tour de force, that uses a combination of traditional methods and primitive computer effects to create a world that was unlike anything that came before it, and a world that is spectacle and impressive and has never really been replicated, even by its own sequel. TRON is a product of true cinematic vision, and manages to innovate while being incredibly entertaining at the same time, not an easy feat, but the Disney organisation as always does a very professional job.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Walt Disney Productions presents us with a stunning 1080p image presentation and especially in the unusual 2.20:1 aspect ratio. TRON was prepared for a 70mm and 35mm theatrical. The film was scanned and restored in 4K, and then scaled down for a Blu-ray presentation in 1080p. But of course parts of the TRON film will never look as detailed, or as sharp as a modern Hollywood production. TRON  was shot on 65mm film negative, in full colour for majority of the scenes that take place in the real world, and 65mm in black-and-white for the scenes shot with actors that take place in the computer world. Those scenes that take place in the computer were then printed down to VistaVision, a horizontal 35mm film format, where each scene was hand tinted, and combined with effects sequences that were generated by the computers to create the unique visuals of the film. Once these scenes were finished, they were blown back up to 65mm film negative and combined with the 65mm colour negative sequences to create a Super Panavision 70 and 35mm prints for theatrical distribution. Did you catch all of that? Vast improvements have been made to enhance the overall feel of the original TRON for this Blu-ray release. For a film that was released in 1982, and the 1080p picture quality is so strong that seeing it with this Blu-ray disc format is like literally seeing it for the first time and in doing so you can see all the limitations in the hand-done technology, yet it only serves to add even greater appreciation for the way things were created, and the attention to detail here is breath-taking. Earlier releases of this film on the inferior DVD format suffered from flickering wherever the colourful lines of light were composited onto the frames as part of its original production. But this new release greatly reduces that flicker, creating a far more enjoyable viewing experience. The effects themselves remain the same, meaning they are totally spectacular and the film TRON looks totally enhanced, despite the age of the film and of course overall, it looks better than ever.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Walt Disney Productions presents us with an equally stunning new 5.1 DTS- HD Master Audio experience, and especially as TRON was released to cinemas with a 70mm six track Dolby Stereo soundtrack, which has been remixed and presented here via a 5.1 DTS-Master Audio soundtrack. TRON soundtrack is just as much of an experience as its visual counterpart. You will experience ambient sound is constantly coming out of every speaker. Voices are panned all around the sound stage, moving from left to right, and even spending some time in the surrounds. Things are constantly crashing into walls, and being blown up as the action unfolds, and the sub-woofer responds with an impressive amount of force. Voices are never lost under the intense sound design of the world of TRON. Add to all this, the awesome Wendy Carlos music film score that adds to the ambience of the film, and youve got a film that was not only ground-breaking at the time it came out, but will continue to be for those who are willing to take a journey and overlook some of its narrative flaws. Overall, I was blown away by just how good TRON sounds and I wish more soundtracks were this well mixed. Even with the dominant music, dialogue and clarity never gets overwhelmed, and there are plenty of moments of quiet reflection to complement the bombastic parts of the film. I am always continuously surprised and pleased by many of the audio offerings you get to hear throughout the film and the audio matches its picture perfectly throughout the film TRON. So all in all this is an A/V sound experience you have been waiting to hear, because surpassed my expectations. Sure, after well over 30 years you can definitely hear the age in this mix, but really, it fits in wonderfully with the look of the film.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: SCREEN SAVER: If you are a fan of the film TRON, well via the use of this Blu-ray disc you can download this unique item that will end up on your computer screen and will be displayed as a special screen saver, where you will see an animation of a character riding a light cycle, the type of vehicle designed by concept artist Syd Mead for the simulated world of the TRON universe. In the Blu-ray disc Menu you have a choice of different settings, which include Delay; 5 minutes; 10 minutes and 20 minutes.

Special Feature: The TRON Phenomenon [New Bonus] [2011] [1080p] [1.78:1] [9:45] The cast and crew of 'TRON' discuss the legacy of the original 'TRON' film in this recently produced exclusive special feature. We also get to view old 1982 film footage of the boffins at the MAGI SynthaVision Computer Company. They all give great praise towards Steven Lisberger on how ahead of his time he was in making the film TRON and we see him being interviewed in a rare 1982 film footage. We also get to view some stunning images of Syd Meads amazing conceptual artwork, as well as some stunning early computer graphics test animation.

Special Feature: Photo Tronology [New Bonus] [2011] [1080p] [1.78:1] [17:00] 'TRON and TRON: LEGACY Writer/Producer/Director Steven  Lisberger and his son Carl Lisberger, visit the Walt Disney Archives in search of the original production stills, principal photography, large colour transparencies, colour tests, conceptual art and rare note book materials the studio saved from the original 'TRON film.

Audio Commentary with Director Steven Lisberger, Producer Donald Kushner, Associate Producer and Visual Effects Supervisor Harrison Ellenshaw and Visual Effects Supervisor Richard Taylor: Here Steven Lisberger welcomes us to this audio commentary, next up is Donald Kushner, next up is Harrison Ellenshaw and finally to introduce themselves is Richard Taylor, and here they are to provide us with some audio commentary on the film TRON. They inform us that the origins of TRON dates back to the early days work they did on the animation of characters made out of light imagery, and what also helped is that they tried to keep up-to-date on the early computer graphics that started to emerge in the 1980s period. We here that the person that owned the Laser Laboratory was in fact Lawrence Livermore of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory which is situated in 7000 East Ave, Livermore, CA 94550, USA. Who was very enthusiastic in allow them to film TRON. By the way, when you see the three actors turn up at the big door at ENCOM that was a real radiation door to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and is 12 feet thick. When you see Jeff bridges gets zapped into the TRON computer games world and you see everyones clothes glowing with bright colours, we get explained in great detail the technical side of how the effects were produced. When you see the Lightcycles escaping and being chased by the computer tanks, both were designed by the brilliant futuristic graphic designer and Conceptual Artist Syd Mead. When you see the breath-taking scene in which a Solar Sailer zips across the virtual world of the Grid on a beam of concentrated energy, while trying to escape, they mention that down below that at one point the Solar Sailer flies over a lake, that actually has the shape of Mickey Mouses head. They also comment that they wished that had available at the time todays modern bicycle helmets of making the picture, and they also comment that it is very funny today how the bicycle helmet around the world wear these types of helmets and also spandex clothing and they didn't realise at the time that the people involved with the film were the pioneers of roller blading and bicycle technology. What has made me really angry is that one of the audio commentators says, It is one of these sequences where you can see the subtlety on this LaserDisc of the variations in colour and just the difference in the tone of his overall body costume and the difference of the tonality of the whites of the head gear. Well I think this is very unprofessional attitude, because this same audio commentary was included in the inferior DVD release, and now it has been included in the Blu-ray release, well again I think this is a very unprofessional attitude of the Walt Disney Productions, as it should have done a new recordings to include the word DVD release or Blu-ray release.

It also includes interviews with the cast and crew of the film that share their experiences from working on this unique project, as well as discuss the special efforts that went into bringing it to completion.  It was also so cool to see Jeff Bridges put back on his own personal TRON helmet and says, When I have it on all day, it seems to bring me peace. As a bonus we get clips from Steven Lisbergers early animation entitled Cosmic Cartoon, as well as lots of rare clips from the 1980 animated television film Animalympics that was produced by the Lisberger Studios, Inc. On top of all that, throughout the made-for-video documentary, it gets broken up with insert headings, which consist of THE ORIGINS OF TRON; THE WARRIORS OF TRON; THE WIZARDS OF TRON and END OF THE LINE . . . ?

01. Lightcycle Scene with Alternate Carlos Music Tracks [2002] [480i] [1.33:1] [88:21] The music for TRON was composed by Wendy Carlos, and the composers original music was deleted from the final version of the film. Here you get a reconstruction of the Lightcycle sequence with its original musical underscore. Wendy Carlos had originally composed an electronic score to accompany the Lightcycle sequence. The music was not used in the final version of the film. The final soundtrack features only the character dialogue and the sound effects of the Lightcycle.

02. End Credits with Original Carlos Music [2002] [480i] [1.33:1] [5:15] Here we are presented with only a segment of Wendy Carloss end credit music that is featured in the final-release version of the film TRON.

The following clip we get to view presents Wendy Carloss original end credit music in its entirety.

Special Feature: PUBLICITY: After finishing the live-action photography for the film TRON, the filmmakers assembled a five-minute sample reel to be shown at the National Association of Theater Owners [NATO] convention. The reel we get to view, which took six weeks to produce, served as a trial run for the visual effects procedures to be used in the post production work. What we get to view is seven individual features all relating to promoting the up and coming release of the film TRON, which are as follows:

01. NATO [2002] [480i] [1.33:1] [5:02] Here we get to view the Preview Trailer of the Original TRON film that was shown at the National Association of Theater Owners Convention, which was basically a sample reel of the film, and a work-in-progress to demonstrate what the audiences can expect to see when the full film is released.

02. WORK-IN-PROGRESS [2002] [480i] [1.33:1] [1:26] Here we get to view is the Work-In-Progress Trailer. It is of particular interest to note that it contains the original Black-and-White production footage, plus the production audio, as well as early tests for computer animation.

Although Harrison Ellenshaw was very disappointed the certain deleted scenes were not included in the film, at least he is very pleased they are preserved in the following deleted scenes.

02. TRON AND TORIS LOVE SCENE #1 [2002] [480i] [1.33:1] [1:56] The so called LOVE SCENE between Tron and Yoris features some of the most extensive backlight compositing in the film. Over forty separate elements were generated to create the final composite background of Yoriss TRANSFORMED apartment, This scene was deleted so late that it has its complete effects animation, as well as full music score and sound effects.

03. TRON AND TORIS LOVE SCENE #2 [2002] [480i] [1.33:1] [00:44] The second scene in Yoris quarters, commonly referred to by the filmmakers as the MORNING AFTER scene, and was also deleted from the film. The scene you view was originally intended to follow Flynns journey in the recognizer. The audio track is only partly heard in this scene sadly does not exist.

04. ALTERNATE OPENING PROLOGUE [2002] [480i] [1.33:1] [1:21] In order to clarify the interaction of the Electronic World and the Real World of TRON, an Opening Prologue, consisting of three paragraphs of text was added to the film.

04. Lightcycle MAGI Animation Tests [2002] [480i] [1.33:1] [00:16] For some unknown reason there is no sound provided.

05. Recognizer: Space Paranoids Video Game [Letterbox image] [2002] [480i] [1.33:1] [00:16] The footage was originally created by MAGI as a full-frame image, but was later stretched to a Widescreen image to accommodate close-up, and here we view the Letterbox version, that is presented here in its entirety.

06. Recognizer: Space Paranoids Video Game [Full-Frame image] [2002] [480i] [1.33:1] [00:16] Here is the original footage that was originally created by MAGI as a Full-Frame image version, that is presented here in its entirety.

05. Lightcycle Chase Storyboard [2002] [480i] [1.33:1] [1:56] Here again you get to view the very basic pen and ink storyboard drawings, and at the same time you get to hear the actual film soundtrack relating to what you view with the pen and ink drawings, and at the same time we get short clips from the film relating to the storyboard drawings.

Finally, TRON [1982] is for my money, is a technical achievement, and probably now a much better looking film to have in your Blu-ray Collection. The film is fun, never drags, and features some great performances from an enthusiastic cast. The Blu-ray takes full advantage of the films high resolution crisp images are only amplified now being on the 1080p image format in being able see the visionary 1982 film in its finest image spectacular. Highly Recommended!
