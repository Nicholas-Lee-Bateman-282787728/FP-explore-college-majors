1371113,5,B00004Y6A4,"I rated this movie 5 stard only because it is the single worst movie I have ever seen, that takes a lot.  I think it is supposed to be a thriller but it made me laugh to tears.  It was Directed by the same guy who did Dawn of the Dead.  If you want to see the most obviuos low low budget Viet Nam movie with killer hippies, check it out.",1008115200,,337,3.7183098591549295
1371114,5,B00004Y6A4,"There must be something in that Michigan water. It produces talent like Campbell, Raimi, Spiegel, and of course Josh Becker... Do the Great Lakes hold some secret of great cinematic wonder? Perhaps.
This is one of the coolest horror films of the 80's. Becker works with almost no budget to recreate the late 1960's. He takes you from the jungles of Vietnam to rural Michigan, and it ain't too bad. So what if the Viet Cong village looks like it was erected on a soccer field! That's the beauty of it. The story is cool and Raimi is great as the psychotic 'Mansonesque' cult leader. You can feel Becker's determination as you watch this film. Check out his other films Running Time and Lunatics: A Love Story (featuring the amazing Ted Raimi).",1006041600,3,742,4.628787878787879
1371115,5,B00004Y6A4,"This is by far the best movie about a bloodthirsty cult hunted down by vigilante Vietnam vets I've ever seen. Ok well, it's the only one I've ever seen. You will watch this film more than once without a doubt.",990057600,4,209,4.25
1371116,5,B00004Y6A4,"Vietnam Vets Vs. Charles Manson-like gang ! Some of those elements that are now part of the famous and beloved EVIL DEAD the trilogy are easily detected here. Great FX for a very low budget movie,insane ideas and stunts,great plot- of course it's not perfect,but if they had had more dough,it would have been. Watch this ! it is unbelievable. You will be pleased to have this great item in your video collection.",988588800,,412,4.657534246575342
1371117,4,B00004Y6A4,"This DVD edition brings new life into an already great film. Scenes that were barely visible in the old VHS copies are now crystal clear. Be warned, however, that the audio commentary from co-writer Bruce Campbell and director Josh Becker, though occasionally insightful and consistently entertaining, does not give this film the credit it deserves. This is a very good film.",987811200,4,375,5.163934426229508
1371118,4,B00004Y6A4,"Ok, I own most of Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi's movies, so I had to give this movie a whirl (Josh Becker worked on Evil Dead).  Overall, don't expect any academy award winning performances or plot.  This movie is well below low-budget and I don't think Becker of Campbell (who provide a commentary) are trying to pass it off as anything it is not either.
As a movie to sit back and enjoy without taking seriously; you will enjoy it.  The commentary shines, very humorous and entertaining all the way through.  But, I am partial to Raimi/Campbell movies and others might not be.
Once again, get it for the commentary...well worth it.",984182400,,633,4.625
1371119,5,B00004Y6A4,"If you're tired of Speilburg's blantant attempts to wring emotions from the tendons of your soul, then this movie is like a soothing balm to your weary, weather-beaten lips.  While various other films strive to be genuine and well-made, this one does not even need to: every bit of action, every facial expression, every bit of dialogue speaks from the heart--or at least the spleen.  Bruce Campbell is brilliant in this epic tale of heartbreak and intrigue.  Not for the whole family, definitely not appropriate to show at Cousin Betty's wedding, this movie is one that at least the committed Sam Raimi-Bruce Campbell fans can enjoy.  Hail to the king, baby.",978825600,,659,4.90990990990991
1371120,5,B00004Y6A4,"This film is full of suprises.  From the plot twists taking us from the jungles of Vietnam to the backwoods of Michigan, this film cant be beat.  Some of the best acting youll find in the Raimi/Becker catalogue, this one cant be missed.",975542400,4,236,4.465116279069767
1371121,3,B00004Y6A4,"""Thou Shalt Not Kill...Except"" is yet another obscure movie remastered by the video gods at Anchor Bay. The plot follows a group of war heroes, fresh out of Vietnam, who end up battling a cult of Charles Manson types in a small town. This may sound like a serious plot (like a revenge movie), but it's really not. Actually, this movie is more of a slapstick comedy than anything, and like all comedies, it wears a little thin upon repeated viewings. ""Thou Shalt Not Kill...Except"" comes from the same core group (Sam Raimi, Josh Becker, Bruce Campbell) that worked on ""The Evil Dead,"" so if you appreciated the humor in that movie, you'll most likely get a kick out of this one.  I personally found it superior to that overrated shocker.",974851200,4,737,4.625954198473282
1371152,5,B00004Y6A4,"This movie was NOT directed by the same guy who directed ""Dawn of the Dead"" (either version).  It was directed by Josh Becker of ""Running Time"" and ""Alien Apocalypse"" fame.  He also directed some episodes of Xena.  The movie is also know as ""Stryker's War"" and features Sam Raimi, the director of ""Evil Dead"" and ""Spider-Man,"" as a Charles Manson-esque cult leader and stars Bruce Campbell (under the pseudonym ""Brian Schulz,"" a SAG actor in a non-SAG film is usually a no-no) as a returned Viet Nam vet.  It's cheesy, but great!  If you're a fan of the ""Evil Dead"" crowd's other early movies (""Crimewave"" or ""Night of the Intruder"" for example), you'll love this one, too.  There's a great out-of-print DVD editon, I recommend you look for that version.",1174521600,,754,4.7615384615384615
1371153,3,B00004Y6A4,Please only buy this if you are a Bruce Campbell fan. Why? A Great 5-Star Commentary to a 1-Star Movie.,1154476800,2,103,4.2
1371154,5,B00004Y6A4,"From the world of Raimi and Campbell comes this mid 80's cult gem right out of DETROIT MICHIGAN!!! Where do I begin with this unique blend of war stories, gore, low budget style, insanity and action? Now as much as I like this movie, I know some may not get it and that is natural since b-movies or cult films tend to appeal to a limited but open minded audience. For those who are into this type of cinema, you came to the right place and it doesn't get much better than this movie. I think the most important aspect of this film is Sam Raimi's performance as the morbidly deranged Charles Manson like cult leader. Everything from his motions right down to classic lines such as ""Don't you ever touch the sacrificial fluids... okey dokey"" as he delivers it in the film will make you say this is the guy who directed Spider Man? It's a bold mixture of humor and instability. This film is also another example of low budget appeal and style that you can not reproduce so it is for sure a great campy film for its time. Now the filming location is credited as being shot at Bruce Campbell's old residence but no other locations are listed so it got me thinking that the war sequences and cabin shots may have been shot way out in the suburbs? Northville Tunnels would have been a great filming location for some of the scenes (those of you from the Detroit area will know what I am talking about). Also, fans of Evil Dead and low budget horror will really dig this flick. By all accounts, that acting is cheese and some of the effects are what you expect of a low budget film but this is why cult film enthusiast like us love these type of films.",1145404800,13,1644,4.306451612903226

1371157,1,B00004Y6A4,"Are you kidding?  I can't believe anyone with a brain would remotely suggest that this film has any type of viewing pleasure.  Read the title... yes, that's right, no your not dreaming, read it again out loud... There, that should sum up why you should never give this film the time of day.  I saw this film by mistake on television and literally have panic attacks at the thought of how much better off I would be if I hadn't.  I could feel myself getting dumber with every second. Do I really need to say it?  Ok, here it goes, don't waste your time.  Then again, the fact that your here reading this review doesn't say much...",1098835200,3,629,4.333333333333333
1371158,5,B00004Y6A4,"THIS FILM WAS BY FAR ONE OF THE MOST ORIGINAL AND ENTERTAINING LOW BUDGET FILMS THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN.
I HAD READ BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE REVIEWS ABOUT THIS FILM, BUT I DID NOT LET THEM HAMPER MY OPINION ABOUT IT.
AFTER ALL, EVERYONE'S VIEW ON A PARTICULAR FILM IS NOT ALWAYS THE SAME. IT'S STRICTLY A MATTER OF TASTE!
THIS WAS A GOOD WAY TO PASS 85 MINUTES. I LAUGHED QUITE A BIT AT SOME OF THE UTTERLY RIDICULOUS SCENES.
THIS MOVIE IS NOT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY AND IF THIS MOVIE IS TAKEN IN THE CORRECT CONTEXT, IT CAN AND WILL BE ENJOYED!!
WE JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THIS IS NOT AN OSCAR WINNER, BUT IT IS STILL AN EXCEPTIONALLY ORIGINAL LOW BUDGET FILM!
MIGHT I ALSO SAY THAT IF YOU LIKE GORE AND BLOOD AND MURDERS, THEN THIS IS THE MOVIE FOR YOU.
I FOUND IT TO BE A FILM THAT WILL BRING ME NUMEROUS FUN-FILLED VIEWINGS.
TO SUM IT UP, IF YOU HAVE A SICK SENSE OF HUMOR OR A TASTE FOR STRANGE AND WEIRD CINEMA, THEN THIS IS THE MOVIE FOR YOU!!

1371159,1,B00004Y6A4,"This movie was just awful.  It had the look and feel of being made by high school students.  It was not funny, or interesting and really did not have anything worth mentioning to encourage you to watch it.  I would have given it a one except I realized, it could have been worse. Nah, it could not have been worse, it is a one.",1056758400,5,327,4.078125
1371160,5,B00004Y6A4,"Is it any wonder that the critics missed the mark on Thou Shalt Not Kill... Except (TSNKE)? Even To Live And Die In LA recieved a lukewarm reception from the so called 'critics'. It is clear by the general consenus of fans which truly apprecaite this and other fine films that TSNKE simply must not be missed!
This piece of artwork features a generous helping of everything. Action, violence, romance, drama, and of course ... Revenge! From the sleazy cult girls to the kennel owner, you will get to know each and every well developed character. The sets and locations, while clearly independent film quailty, are used wisely to enhance the viewers perception and plotline.
Add - the deleted scene, alternate opening, trailer, audio commentary, superb wide screen picture and cryoted clear soundtrack and you have a rare jem of a film.",1010016000,9,835,4.887323943661972
1371161,5,B00004Y6A4,"Never in my wildest dreams could I have envisioned this semi-obscure gem on DVD and yet, here it is.  I've watched the VHS version of T.S.N.K.E. (sink-ee) at least 200 times all the way through, but my first DVD viewing was like experiencing a whole new T.S.N.K.E.  Scenes that once looked suspiciously lit by car headlights have been transformed into scenes that are clearly lit by car headlights.  The soundtrack has been given the digital restoration it deserves and the commentary track is just weird.  To realize that at least two other people still acknowledge this film is really spooky.  Somebody pinch me.",1008806400,8,614,4.922330097087379
7926631,4,B00004Y6A4,"Sam Raimi ""Evil Dead"" fans will appreciate this direct-to-VHS classic ""so-bad-its-good"" flick from the 80s. The remastered print is good considering the graininess and pure cheapness of the original. This is sheer campiness with horrid acting and dialog right out of the z-movie TROMA catalog.
Sam Raimi stars as a Manson like cult leader under attack from revenge-seeking Vietnam vets. Thats all you need to know,s o sit back and enjot the ride. This bluray release is packed full of extras for anyone who wants to dig deeper into the career of successful director, Raimi. Enjoy.",1506643200,,580,5.052083333333333

7926635,3,B00004Y6A4,"I don't know if there has ever been or ever will be a movie quite like Thou Shalt Not Kill....Except.  An exploitation film to be sure, but not completely action and not completely horror.  Viewers will find many things to be offended by from this movie unless they see it for what it is: an trashy send-up of John Wayne movies.  The Blu-ray release is stellar and includes many great extras, not the least of which is the short film Stryker's War (which was shot on Super-8 film and stars Burn Notice's Bruce Campbell) which was used to raise money for the feature-length movie.  If you are already a fan of this movie, it is worth every dime and then some.",1358121600,,658,4.413223140495868
7926636,4,B00004Y6A4,"Thou Shalt Not Kill...Except is a low-budget action movie along the lines of Rambo. It pits marines and the Manson Family against each other, and is full of violence. The first hour is pretty good, but the final twenty minutes or so are awesome and deliver the bloody action-packed goods. This feature-length film is pretty much a remake of the 1980 short film Stryker's War, which is also included on the Blu-Ray/DVD Combo just released by Synapse. There's also an interview with Bruce Campbell, interviews with the cast and crew, and a funny deleted scene involving puke. This is a must-buy for exploitation fans, and for Bruce Campbell fans, since Stryker's War starred him.",1335916800,,677,4.947368421052632
7926637,5,B00004Y6A4,"I remember owning the original VHS tape for Thou Shalt Not Kill... Except. It is great to finally see a Blu-Ray filled with all the bells and whistles that it deserves. If you are looking for a great Saving Private Ryan war-movie you need to look elsewhere. This is 80's war cheese at its finest. Sam Raimi plays the villain, a Charles Manson-type cult leader. The regulars are also here... Ted Raimi, Scott Spiegel, Tim Quill and Bruce Campbells feet... This Blu-ray features the full Super 8mm short ""Stryker's War featuring Bruce Campbell as Stryker.

7926638,3,B00004Y6A4,"Thou Shalt Not Kill...Except has the distinction of being co-authored by B-movie god Bruce Campbell and features Evil Dead trilogy director Sam Raimi as a vicious Charles Manson-type murdering psychopath.  On those merits alone, the film is worth watching, but beyond that, there's little here to really recommend.  In 1969, Vietnam war hero Stryker (Brian Schulz) returns home, only to learn that a murderous cult is making their presence felt.  It isn't long before Stryker and his Marine buddies find themselves on a collision course.  Short, nasty, and rivaling Troma films of the time in terms of production values, Thou Shalt Not Kill...Except is a fun forgotten flick that delivers a majority of the goods those who enjoy this kind of film come looking for.  There's nothing really great about it, but there's nothing downright awful about it either.  Synapse Films made this Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack a shocking labor of love, with an insightful commentary from Campbell, Schulz, and director Josh Becker, as well as the original short film ""Stryker's War"" of which Thou Shalt Not Kill...Except is based upon, starring Bruce Campbell.",1334534400,,1139,5.19672131147541
7926639,2,B00004Y6A4,"Wow, now that was bad wasn't it?

Somewhat marketed as a horror film but really an action thriller bordering on troma level acting and dull dialogue. When Sam Raimi makes appearances in movies, he is usually funny or at least fitting in, but here he is just exhibiting plain old bad acting in a film that I don't think should be associated with Evil Dead/Intruder etc, just because it has Sam Raimi.

So if you are a horror fan that is expecting some lost classic slasher/gore film featuring some of the crew from Evil Dead then beware, because all you really get from this film is a C-rate action flick with some minor gore. Bah",1334361600,2,629,4.460869565217391
7926640,5,B00004Y6A4,"Sam Raimi and what looks like his buddies, some relatives, and next-door neighbors decided to make a movie. Because the director knew what he was doing and the soundtrack helped build some serious tension, the film becomes a masterpiece of mayhem. Biker hippies with bad teeth are stinking up the great outdoors while terrorizing a small town until four vets fresh from 'Nam show up and the results are buckets of blood and lots of hair. The bad acting works for the film because everything is played straight. The best performance as the Manson type cult leader is Sam Raimi. Raimi is a goofy sadist making up all his own rituals. Thou Shalt not.. delivers many great bloody effects to make the movie even more fun. Great action, super bloody, and unintentionally funny from beginning to end. Widescreen dvd from anchor bay is very clear. The bluray is super grainy so don't sell your dvd yet.",1228003200,,894,4.737179487179487
