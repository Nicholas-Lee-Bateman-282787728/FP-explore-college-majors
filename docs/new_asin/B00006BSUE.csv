7966907,5,B00006BSUE,"Great film.  Exactly what I wanted and did have a gathering to show the film - nearly a true depiction of events and rising above prejudices.  Plan to show it again on 4th of July at the gathering it showed honor, pride and love of USA.  Well worth the purchase.  Would order from this vendor again.",1349222400,,299,4.285714285714286
7966908,3,B00006BSUE,"This film states, ""In our time of political correctness, it is easy to portray the white man as bad and the Indian as good.""  It then praises a Caucasian missionary named Johnson who came up with the idea of Navajo code talkers.  Instead of saying this, the documentary makers could have said, ""The success of the Navajo Code Talkers was due to a biracial effort.""  Griping about P.C. takes the easy way out.  The documentary makers fail to realize that not all missionaries do good.  Many Americans of color and people in the developing world say, ""First, Europe sent the missionaries, then they sent the soldiers and plantation owners.""  Yes, Johnson had a good idea.  However, he was not the one to risk his life on the battlefields of the Second World War.  I think Navajo veterans themselves deserve more credit than this documentary grants.

Along those lines, there was only one actual Navajo code talker interviewed here.  In a book about these soldiers and at the premiere of ""Windtalkers,"" one sees that many of them are still alive.  It is true that Tom Hanks' campaign for WWII vets is needed and that many are dying in great numbers.  However, there is far from just one Code Talker alive.  An important aspect of Black American history is that the nation exploited Black soldiers for wars and then treated them like second-class citizens (again) once they returned home.  This documentary, too, fails to answer whether life was better for these Native American men after they sacrificed themselves for this country.

I found this documentary slanted and not thorough.",1115683200,11,1581,4.868913857677903
