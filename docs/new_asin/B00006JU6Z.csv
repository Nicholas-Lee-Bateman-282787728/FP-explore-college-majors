Id Rate this movie a 10 star if I could. Great Movie,buy it today you won't regret it,trust me.",1234137600,7,259,4.6521739130434785
1782467,4,B00006JU6Z,"I liked this movie. AS far as the look and stuff, think REd Shoe Diaries. It's professionally shot as if it was on tv. I liked the movie though a couple of scenes diddn't make sense, but I laughed at how great the ending was. I think how they got to the point of the plot of the movie, was nebulous at the least. I never thought that's what the movie'd be about. Some scenes of Stephen not liking his father or his father making condescending remarks (Freeloader, loser, good for nothing) would have worked. But set that aside, it's pretty much a good movie. It has trailers on it and that's it. Some of the trailers don't look good, but this one was a keeper, i might buy it even. I'm a Stephen Baldwin fan.",1213833600,,708,4.213235294117647
1782468,1,B00006JU6Z,"Stephen Baldwin (The Usual Suspects, Sex Monster) plays a big shot son of another big shot who gets involved with the beautiful Kari Wuhrer (Anaconda, Eight Legged Freaks) in a game of deciet and passion. Why couldn't it of been passion and canoles? The 2 are after a crapload of money, and both become entangled with one another, but can they trust each other. Boring, with way too much bad acting. Only interest for guys who like Wuhrer and want to see her in the buff and for those fans who already know Baldwin's career is in the john, but want to watch another movie he is in ruin it. Baldwin and Wuhrer Executive Produced this debacally mundane fart joke",1091232000,4,660,4.508333333333334
1782469,2,B00006JU6Z,"If it wasn't for Kari Wuhrer's attractive naked body that appears throughout the movie this movie wouldn't ""work"" like it did.
Kari plays Lauren, who is an analyst at an investment banking company. Baldwin plays Clay and he is the son of a very rich owner of a client firm. Together they make a plan to get all the rich man's money without killing him.
Good only if you like Kari Wuhrer...you'll get to see a lot of her...if you know what I mean.",1085529600,22,446,4.321428571428571
1782470,2,B00006JU6Z,"This is truly a ""B"" quality movie and like many ""B"" movies they are Rent-ers NOT Buyers.  There was oddly some good acting by Stephen Baldwin, but that is only to Stephen Baldwin standards.  For the Kari Wuhrer fans there are a couple of goods scenes where she is ""Performing at Her Best"".  OK movie to see but, stick to the video store with this bad boy",1062374400,11,354,4.253731343283582
7970676,5,B00006JU6Z,"5 stars for Kari Wuhrer, she plays the women that goes into a glass corporation and  works as the finicial person
 the owner hires her back after the the president of the company fires her , because she wants the same money
as the guys, she is a risk taker, so she buys  some stocks on her own and calls the  the company that just fired her,
they buy some stocks from the same place and make a killing, so they fired the president that fired her and hired her back,
she knows she has to take risk , to work with the men in the company, so she seduces the owner;s son
and they decide to make a plan to make his daddy mad and when the plan stats coming together
well, things change, hence the name of the movie ""spider web""
there is nudity where needed in the show but, it starts slow, but if you pay attention to detail, it will keep you at the edge of your seat
and at the end, you will think the same, what webs we can spin when it all counts!!",1521244800,,945,3.957894736842105

7970681,4,B00006JU6Z,You finally get to see Kari Wuhrer in something good. I think she's underrated and this movie illustrates that very well.,1367020800,,121,4.809523809523809
7970682,5,B00006JU6Z,"Kari Wuhrer has her own devious way in SPIDER'S WEB. It's basically a cat and mouse thriller about one simple con involving lots of money that becomes a trap. That is why they say, BE CAREFUL WHO YOU TRUST.",1361836800,,206,4.3076923076923075
7970683,4,B00006JU6Z,"A good thriller which I had partially seen on TV, but missed the ending. Worth the purchase to resolve the mystery.",1356998400,,115,4.523809523809524
7970684,3,B00006JU6Z,"This movie wasn't bad, but was almost a porno! It was like watching ""soft-core"" with a plot. Not a bad movie though.",1356739200,,116,4.318181818181818
7970685,4,B00006JU6Z,"I think this movie falls in the genre of erotic thriller. Basicly that means it's a movie with nude scenes. And so fans of Kari Wuhrer gets to see her do sex scenes in the movie. I think the movie does pretty good keeping you tuned in, in between the nudity, as there is drama and good story. But it is essentially a movie for Kari Wuhrer fans since she is lead actress, lead character, and we get to see her nude.",1266105600,,414,4.060975609756097
