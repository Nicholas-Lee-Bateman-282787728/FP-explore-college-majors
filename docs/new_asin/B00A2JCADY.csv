8546232,1,B00A2JCADY,"Beware when you purchase this four-disc set. I got one from eBay exactly like this and it DOES NOT include all 22 episodes even though the packaging states that it does. At total of eight episodes are missing:

DISC 1 is supposed to include six episodes but only includes the first four on the list;

DISC 2 is supposed to include six episodes but again includes only the first four on the list;

DISC 3 is supposed to include five episodes but like Discs 1 and 2 includes only the first four;

DISC 4 is supposed to include five episodes but includes only the second and third episodes on the list for a total of TWO episodes.

Episodes missing are as follows:

""Thou Shalt Not Steele""
""Steele Belted""
""Steeling the Show""
""Steele Flying High""
""Steele Among the Living""
""Steele in the News""
""Sting of Steele""
""Steele in Circulation""

If you'll notice, other Season One sets are more expensive than this 4-disc set, and if they actually include all 22 episodes, they're worth the extra money. This 4-disc set includes only 16 episodes even though it states it's the complete season.",1467676800,,1081,4.657894736842105
8546233,5,B00A2JCADY,Arrived on time. Item as described. Many thanks for the memories,1466467200,,64,4.909090909090909
