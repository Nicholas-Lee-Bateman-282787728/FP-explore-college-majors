This edition focuses on things of wonder all around us, e.g., sky, moon, etc.",1141603200,7,321,4.907407407407407
2440134,1,B000BT9916,"I thought that since this video was from Sesame Street, it would either be educational or fun and not harmful.  Wrong.  Elmo is a naturally curious guy, who loves to say, ""Elmo wants to know MORE about ..."".  That is good, very good.  Unfortunately, he invariably follows this with ""Let's ask televsion"" and a bouncing TV appears with a video.  The videos it shows are not bad, factual and short enough to hold interest.  However, advocating TV as the primary means of learning is irresponsible.  ""I saw it on TV"" does not imply accurate information and TV is the last thing I want my daughter to think of using as an information source.  Why Elmo can't say ""Let's ask Encyclopedia"", ""Let's go to the library"", or ""Let's ask a teacher"" is beyond my comprehension.

My rating:  0 of 5 stars.

My husband's rating:  ""If I had known, I wouldn't have bought it!""

This DVD is going to quietly disappear and be replaced with something with actual value.",1141603200,10,948,4.604790419161676

8092042,5,B000BT9916,Elmo is very funny. Baby loves it and I have to say that Elmo character makes some comments and jokes that only an adult would understand. I find him very entertaining compared to Barney and Tellitubies. I would pick watching Elmo anyday over the other children DVDs.,1214006400,,267,4.702127659574468
