8265842,5,B0017GYD36,ive listened to this series on audio discs in the car for years and now have been able to watch it on DVD.  This series is wonderful.  I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to understand Philosophy and its history since Plato.,1433462400,,230,4.325581395348837
8265843,4,B0017GYD36,"I purchased this set of CD's (not DVD's), used, from Amazon for $127.97.  The list price on the Teaching Company's site is $789.90 (audio only) (but occasionally discounted).  I'm pleased with the purchase and happy that I didn't pay more than I did.  I listened to these CD's, one to two hours a night, instead of watching TV--it was a better use of my time.  Of course, I had most of this material in college, but it was still a great refresher.

This set of lectures has seven parts, in chronological sequence:

I:  Classical Origins--pre-Socratics, Sophists, Plato, Aristotle, Stoics, Epicureans, Ecletics (Cicero, Polybius), Skeptics (Sextus Empiricus)
II:  The Christian Age--Hebrew Bible (Job, mostly), Synoptic Gospels, Paul, Plotinus and other neo-Platonists, Augustine, Aquinas, Scholastics, Mystics, Luther, Calvin
III: From the Renaissance to the Age of Reason--Machiavelli, More, Erasmus, Galileo, Bacon, Descartes,Hobbes, Spinoza, Pascal, Bayle, Newton
IV:  The Enlightenment and Its Critics--Locke, Vico, Montesquieu, Mandeville, Berkely, Hume, Smith, Rousseau
V:  The Age of Ideology--Kant, Burke, Hegel, Marx, Mill, Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche
VI:  Modernism and the Age of Analysis--James, Freud, Ayer, Weber, Husserl, Dewy, Heidegger, Wittgenstein, the Frankfurt School, Levi-Strauss
VII: The Crisis of Modernity--Hayek, Popper, Kuhn, Quine, Habermas, Rawls, Derrida, Rorty, Gouldner, Macintyre, Nozick

Each of the professors enuciated very clearly; diction and vocal variety were very good.
I'm pleased that Smith, Hayek, Popper, Kuhn, and Nozick were included; many of us in the private sector are very leery of Left-leaning professors--and yes, they did include various Marxists, as might be expected, but they were very fair to each philosopher included.

I just have a couple of complaints.  The great laissez-faire philosopher of the 19th century, Herbert Spencer, was not included in the lectures.  And the great metaphysician of the 20th century, Prof. Samuel Alexander, was also not included.  One of his famous quotes (Space, Time, and Deity, p. 35) is ""It is not, I believe, too much to say that all of the vital problems of philosophy depend for their solution on the solution of the problem of what Space and Time are and more particularly how they are related to each other.""  The empiricists, deconstructionists, structuralists, and existentialists would do well to study Alexander's work.  As for the philosophy of language, I think that Bertrand Russell had it right; if you have a linguistic issue, simply translate the problem to the predicate calculus and solve it that way.

The lecture on Schopenhauer was given by a woman professor--which is kind of funny because Schopenhauer wrote a famous critical essay entitled ""On Women"" (now available on the Web, of course).",1311465600,4,2817,5.524475524475524
8265844,4,B0017GYD36,"This is a most thorough and thought-provoking study of the roots of western thought.  This is not the quick overview but the deep study by way of many professors each specializing in their particular portion of the course.  All the professors are easy to follow and give passion to their topic making the study go quickly.  Indeed, you may find it necessary to go back and listen again from the deep thinking it imparts.

This study works equally well in either the visual or audio format.",1210723200,6,489,4.651162790697675
