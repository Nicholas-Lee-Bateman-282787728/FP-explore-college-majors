C I D naturally has the incidents of crimes and needs patience to follow and understand the events .Has lots of hit songs during the outdoor shooting in the beautiful city of Mumbai affectionately the Gateway to India especially via Cruise Liners such as SS Karanja, SS  Uganda and many more. Resolution and contrast are not so much of high quality to be average over all. But the audio is very clear and of high quality. You may have to adjust the settings on LCD/LED versions. Played by some of the best of the Film Industry of India.",1457654400,,699,4.369230769230769
