5256529,3,B0093ST4WA,"A transient by the name of Sam Bass (Howard Duff) arrives in a small town looking for a job but soon becomes attracted to both the sheriff's sister (Dorothy Hart, THE NAKED CITY) and the idea of buying a horse to race. But when a crooked promoter (Marc Lawrence) destroys his dream, he reluctantly turns outlaw. The title is a misnomer. The film is all about Duff's character, a real outlaw, and Calamity Jane (Yvonne De Carlo) is in the film only peripherally for the first half before the second half features her more prominently but it's still about Sam Bass. Directed by George Sherman, it's a generic western with only its downbeat ending to make it standout among the plethora of ""B"" oaters. De Carlo is lively but Duff's performance is D.O.A. Historically, it's piffle as there's no evidence that the real Sam Bass and Calamity Jane ever knew each other. With Lloyd Bridges, Norman Lloyd, Willard Parker, Roy Roberts and Ann Doran.

The region 2 DVD from Universal France is a colorful full frame (1.33) transfer with optional French subtitles.",1356480000,2,1052,4.78021978021978

8535359,3,B0093ST4WA,"This grade B 1949 film is a typical western of the time. Its story about the outlaw Sam Bass (born 1851) and Calamity Jane (born 1852) is in no way similar to the actual historical figures. More than half a dozen films were made about each separately - for there is no proof they knew each other and most are better than this one. Sam is portrayed as a nave farm young man who cannot read and who has a great love of horses - both of which cause him serious problems in this film. He falls in love with the sister of the sheriff, which also causes him, and her, problems. He is very virtuous until he is tricked and responds foolishly, which gets him into trouble and he is wanted by the law.
Calamity Jane in this film is a woman who is also in love with Sam. She is interested in horse racing. She is quite foolish and does things to help Sam which make matters worse. She brags about him in a salon which prompts a man to trick him. She rescues him from jail when he should have remained and been tried - and would have been found innocent.
Yvonne De Carlo does not look as well in this film as she does in films she was in later in life.",1459641600,3,1141,4.053097345132743

Also starring Howard Duff, this is good, traditional Western entertainment, with an excellent Technicolor print. Very enjoyable....",1415664000,3,245,6.0285714285714285
