4116029,4,B003EYVXWI,"The message is familiar:  adultery brings consequences to all those involved.  This film takes it to another level with deadly repercussions for many of the people involved in this mess, one of whom has also engaged in an illegal scheme at work that only complicates things even further for him.

There is also an odd and rather sad metaphor involving two dogs which belong to some of the people of the film; I won't spoil it.

4116031,5,B003EYVXWI,"This movie had me from ""G'day."" It's an Australian-made crime drama that serves as a perfect illustration of Shakespeare's caution, ""Oh what a tangled web we weave...""

The first deceit that the main character sets out to practice is the relatively minor one of arranging for a kickback from one of the subcontractors he's dealing with on the honeymoon resort he's been hired to construct. However, then his girlfriend enlists him in a plot to make off with some apparently ill-gotten money she finds. The two somewhat low-level strands of intention to deceive become entangled and together form a coarse noose that threatens to hang everyone. Life for all the characters spirals down into repercussion and murder.

The movie reminded me a little of ""A Simple Plan,"" a lesson in unintended consequences. It deserved the Australian movie awards it won.

There are quite a few bonus materials on this DVD. ""Inside the Square,"" a partial commentary on the making of the film, didn't add anything to my appreciation of ""The Square."" In fact, watching this loose assemblage of prep sessions right after viewing the movie slackened the impact of the film itself. So if you don't have a lot of time, you could perhaps skip this feature.

However there's a video of the song ""Sand"" by Jessica Chapnik that's mellow and pensive and underscores the film's mood of twining toward tragedy.

Then there's a short film called ""Spider"" on the disc. It gave the tyro directors/writers of ""The Square"" some practice in producing a film. It's on a completely different subject from ""The Square,"" but it generates the same sort of tension. We feel that a small, early transgression we witness is going to lead to some terrible consequences, but we don't know what form the calamity is going to take. So be sure to make time to watch this bonus item.",1283385600,,1830,4.852564102564102
4116032,5,B003EYVXWI,"Noir films obsess over unintended consequences, on the destruction that may proceed from the slightest failures of foresight or from simple chance. This notion is best illustrated in the literary forebear ""The Maltese Falcon,"" where Spade reflects on Flitcraft, a seemingly normal, happy man who one day abandoned his job and family after nearly being crushed by a falling beam. The truth, Flitcraft realized, was that the seeming solidity of his world was a lie--all could be lost in an instant for no reason at all. So, he abandoned this world, abandoned regularity and left it all behind. In Nash Edgerton's feature debut ""The Square,"" Raymond Yale (David Roberts), an ethically dubious construction manager, decides to begin anew as well, not for any philosophical reasons, but rather because he is tired of his wife or, at least, much more interested in the lovely young Carla Smith (Claire van der Boom [a ridiculous name, even by Dutch standards]), a neighbor from across the cove in their small Australian town. Raymond would actually prefer to simply keep seeing Carla on the side, but Carla wants to escape her loutish, criminal husband Smithy (Anthony Hayes), and gives Raymond an ultimatum. Raymond finally relents, and they decide to fund their escape by relieving Smithy of a few hundred thousand ill-gotten dollars, and covering their theft by hiring the shady Billy (Joel Edgerton, co-writer and brother of Nash) to burn the Smith house while the town collectively takes part in Christmas festivities. This seemingly straightforward plan, however, goes horrifically awry and, in a vision rather more moralistic than that of the Darwinian-minded Hammett, Raymond and Carla soon find that the beams are falling with disturbing regularity. Many viewers will be incredulous that Murphy's Law could be applied with such speed and merciless consistency, but this is part of the film's fun, seeing how everything falls apart so completely. More significantly, while chance is clearly against all those involved, the human motivations remain clear and believable. They repeatedly fall into traps, but we can see how and why they wandered into them.

""The Square"" is a somewhat difficult film to review, as the reviewer must reveal little. Many have compensated by comparing it to earlier works, particularly ""Blood Simple."" This is indeed apt even beyond the obvious fraternal debut collaboration on a severely noir-oriented thriller angle. Significantly, Edgerton and co. take a Coen-esque hyper-cinematic and slightly postmodern approach (though in a non-winking manner), reinforce the drama via delicious black humor, and even the sparse solo piano that often drives the score reminds of ""Blood Simple""'s minimalist soundtrack. The Australian setting, however, makes ""The Square"" stand apart somewhat from its antecedents. Though perhaps I'm alone in this, my exposure to Australian film have given me a quasi-mythical view of the country as being somehow more brutal and raw then the rest of the Anglosphere. This is no doubt hyperbolic if not an utter fabrication, but this vision is reinforced and expanded by ""The Square,"" where this Australian town seems a sort of grotesque recasting of the stereotypical image of the American south, filled with steamy intrigue and hardened rednecks bearing antisocial hair. (The mullet budget on this film must've been enormous.) Thus, it is appropriate and familiar, yet still somehow new. Similarly, Edgerton expands the visual palette, mixing standard noir high-contrast and emphasis on night, shadow and rain with a dusty, gray-brown color scheme that oozes sleaze and treachery. (Indeed the film is so smudged and muted looking that I wondered if the theater had turned down the bulb, though viewing the DVD proved this was not the case.) Despite the low-budget and 16mm film stock, however, the film is quite smooth and professional, filled with terse, hard-edged performances and edited down to a sharp, tightly knit narrative. (This efficiency is made even more evident after viewing the 25 minutes of deleted scenes on the DVD.) The film is not exactly fast-paced, but it has an unrelenting intensity to it--everything seems to matter, and does. (That said, the film still has the odd little touches that make a movie stand out, such as the peculiar subplot about the adulterous pair's similarly enamored pet dogs.)

The main criticism viewers will have of ""The Square"" is from a human interest angle. There are no heroes, as Raymond is a cheater and corrupt businessman (he receives kickbacks from contractors) even before they embark on the scheme, while Carla is little more than an adulterous cipher. (Quite an attractive one, though. Mentioned that before did I? May well do so again before the review is done.) Though I can't deny that Raymond is a bad guy, I'll admit to sympathizing with him. While films of this sort often suggest that venal sins lead to those of a mortal nature, Raymond doesn't really become more malevolent as the film progresses, but merely has the world collapse around him. As soon as the arson goes awry and Raymond begins receiving mysterious cards demanding cash for silence (but about what? He has many secrets), he is paralyzed, hopeless. Other reviewers have compared the film to a nightmare, the sort where you perform some terrible deed and spend the rest of the dream awaiting and fearing your punishment. (And, of course, failing at simple tasks and having absolutely everything go wrong is another common dream theme.) The resemblance is indeed uncanny, and the dreadful sensation it imbues draws me deep into Raymond's plight even if, objectively speaking, he seems to be asking for some sort of rebuke. (Many others, however, receive rather unwarranted retribution.)

I've been pretty cagey here by necessity, so I'll throw in a few honorifics. In short, ""The Square"" is the best thriller since ""No Country For Old Men"" and perhaps the best thrillers of the 00s apart from that film. Discover it now before the other cult film aficionados find it and be hipper than the rest.

4116033,5,B003EYVXWI,"""The Square""  is an excellent crime thriller from first-time director Nash Edgerton.  Small-town contractor Ray (David Roberts) knows his way around taking and giving kickbacks to assure that a project comes in on time and on budget.  He's having an affair with the much younger Carla (Claire van der Boom), who is eager to leave this tiny coastal town and free herself from abusive boyfriend Billy (Anthony Hayes).  In classic film noir tradition, Claire pushes Ray into planning a robbery of Billy's illegally acquired cash with the line, ""This is our chance.  We have to take it.""

 But the plan goes terribly wrong when Ray hires a professional arsonist who botches the job.  Suspicions are aroused, insinuations made, and the police get involved.  For a time, it looks as if Ray and Claire will escape discovery ... until a blackmail note arrives.

 ""The Square"" has the look and feel of one of those B movies of the late 1940's with tough guys, gals using them in nefarious plots, and unforeseen outcomes. Director Edgerton sets up an unusual structure, with a lot of character development shown in flashback during the film's second act.  This makes the film lag, since it starts with little extraneous dialogue or fuss and builds at a crisp pace.  It also tends to stop the narrative cold.  A more traditional buildup would make more sense here.

 Special features on the Blu-ray Disc include a behind-the-scenes look at the film, deleted scenes, a music video, and making-of featurettes.  ""The Square"" is also available on DVD.",1282780800,,1536,4.914396887159533
4116034,5,B003EYVXWI,"This is a great film that keeps you on the edge of your seat and keeps you wondering what's going to happen next.  While the plot does have a sort of Murphy's law series of events occurring, they're not utterly implausible, and in fact seem to be pretty likely in many cases.  There's only one sort of twist in the film that's kind of implausible and is used obviously just to create another problem for the protagonist but the film was still better by creating this issue.  I know I'm being rather cryptic, but I'm trying not to reveal anything.  Overall, the film is excellent, it's easy to follow and it sucks you into the drama.  The main character is fantastically written and acted, he's rather likable and you root for him but he also portrays his selfishness, brashness, and immorality of infidelity in a very humanistic way.  I'd highly recommend this to any level of film-goer (except young children obviously).",1281657600,,921,4.6894409937888195
4116035,4,B003EYVXWI,"When you are looking for a movie that is a little different and that will keep you interested throughout, but without any big names, this one will do nicely.  The movie is a low budget film from Australia directed by Nash Edgerton and it stars his brother Joel Edgerton who also was a writer for this film.  I found the acting to be quite good and the plotline was interesting and entertaining.  This movie kept me on the edge of my seat throughout.  I don't like to give away plots, so I'll give a quick summary:  A contractor is taking bribes from his subcontractor.  Meanwhile he is having an affair with woman in the same town.  Her husband is close friends with another subcontractor.  The woman finds that her husband has a stash of cash and so she and the contractor begin a plan to escape their marriages and their spouses.  Thus begins the Manifestation of Murphy's Law.

There are some negatives.  The sound is very annoying.  The actors are difficult to understand with their Aussie accents and the clarity of the sound makes it doubly difficult to make out all of the conversations.  So I missed some of the subtleties.  Some of the parts were overplayed - at the end particularly.

However, that said, I would definitely recommend this film to anyone that enjoys an edgy, tense drama.  There was also a short film prior to the main feature; this was also a Nash Edgerton film.  It was terrific and once during The Square, one of those characters makes his way into the emergency room (very Hitchcock like).

I'm giving it a 4 star rating because I enjoyed it; beware, though, my wife would only have given it a 2.5 star rating.  But we often do not see eye to eye on movie reviews.",1279670400,12,1694,4.495081967213115
4116036,5,B003EYVXWI,"Had the good fortune to see this in Pittsburgh last night, with a Q&A session with director Nash Edgerton after the film.  This is the best thriller I've seen in a very long time -- gritty, emotional and incredibly tense.  Comparisons with the Coens and their debut 'Blood Simple' are inevitable, but 'The Square' is not a copycat film in any sense.  The tension barely lets up during the course of the entire movie, and there's a constant feel of menace, like something really bad is always lurking just around the corner (it usually is).

4116055,4,B003EYVXWI,"The Australian film, The Square, is well versed in the long and storied history of film noir.  It takes its basic narrative outline from Gilda, The Postman Always Rings Twice, and Double Indemnity--the kind of films familiar to non-film buffs, even if it is second hand information gathered through parodies and borrowed snippets in other films.  And while the story is nothing new, the film orchestrates each bad decision with such craft that it's hard not to be won over by such a well made film.

Like some of the above films, The Square begins with an illicit tryst.  As the movie begins, Ray and Carla appear to have been carrying on an affair for some time.  There is an age and class difference between the two.  Ray manages a construction site and has slipped into a comfortable upper middle class lifestyle, where Carla, while not poor, is married to a low level gangster.  Ray appears to be about a decade Carla's senior, and while it isn't entirely clear what Ray finds so mundane about his typical middle class existence, I'm sure Carla's age is part of her allure.  The two have been talking about running away together for some months, and an opportunity arises when Carla comes across a duffel bag full of cash hidden in the crawl space of her house.  The two plan to steal the bag, hire someone to burn down the house in order to hide the theft, and then run off together.

The director, Nash Edgarton (brother to the Joel Edgarton, actor and screenwriter), smartly avoids too much exposition.  We don't need to know what problems Ray has been having with his wife, or what it is exactly that Carla's husband, Greg, does that makes it necessary for him to have a coterie of seedy friends, so the filmmakers don't tell us.  The movie is appropriately streamlined.  Obviously, the plan to steal the duffel bag full of money and burn down Carla's house doesn't work as planned, which sets each character against the other.  Part of the appeal of film noir is the manner in which choices veer off into unforeseen consequences.  A major theme of the genre tends to be our own lack of control, how we are often carried along the stream of life and when we attempt to change course we too often encounter eddies and currents that override our intentions.  The Square is a film about the irrevocability of choices.

The Edgarton brothers are mostly known for work in front of the camera than behind it (director Nash has done both acting and stunt work while his brother Joel has started making inroads acting in large Hollywood fare).  But judging by the well crafted nature of The Square, these two should team up more often as a writing and directing team.  Film noir is often the chosen genre for eager young directors who are looking to prove themselves.  There's a reason why Quentin Tarantino, Brian Singer, and, of course, the Cohen Brothers (who would go on to make film noir their own little playground for years to come) started their careers by making taunt film noir thrillers: film noir is the perfect test of a director's skills.  Early film noir established a clear visual style, and since its inception in the mid-forties, the genre has had a sense of formalism about it.  In order to master the genre, you had to first show that you understood how the language of film worked while simultaneously applying your own spin on the themes of love, lust, murder, and the underside of capitalism.  Likewise, Nash Edgarton understands the genre well, and he convinces us that each small decision these characters make, which appear reasonable on their own, could spiral into unthinkable mistakes.  He also tells the story visually, never wasting words when a subtle camera movement will do.  For us outsiders, Australia is often viewed as a rugged desert full of sun hardened men and women.  I can think of fewer settings more suitable to film noir.",1334534400,,3867,4.700296735905044

Clearly the sick humor is intended, cue the big dog's swim across the channel (whoops), or Santa Claus tearing away his jolly garb in a mad dash with the rest of his firehouse crew to the fire engines - and you just KNOW where they are going.

Here's the scoop. David Roberts plays Raymond Yale. A decent sort with a decent boss level job at a construction company, a decent wife and home and children. But he also has a girlfriend. The girlfriend has a boyfriend that's into something bad and involves a serious amount of money. Yale is also working a kickback with one of his sub-contractors. Between the boyfriend's ill-gotten gains and the kickback dough, the two should be able to blow town and live happily ever after. Right!!!!

Things, of course, go horribly wrong. What should have been fairly routine gets stung by the fickle finger of fate and the bad stuff snowballs into an insurmountable pile of doo-doo.

This is a good movie. It's not really different than the others of its kind and maybe not directed quite as well as, say , 'Before the Devil Knows You're Dead.' but it's still a solid effort. The acting is generally good as is the directing and other aspects of production. I suppose the future for this kind of movie might be limited. The viewer pretty much knows early on that the deal is going to go south. It's really a matter of how it's going to happen.

4116063,4,B003EYVXWI,"The story has been painstakingly described by other reviewers, so I will dispense with that formality. The plot was intricately conceived and played out, easily the equal of Blood Simple, A Simple Plan, and other, similar productions by far better-known directors such as Sam Raimi and the Cohen brothers. Indeed, each step in its progression meets the criteria of plausibility. Anyone who yields to the temptation of a seemingly simple, straightforward but illegal path always discovers that it rapidly escalates into a dangerous labyrinth of unforeseen consequences and suffocating guilt. Each new move simply makes the noose a bit tighter. So it was with Raymond and Carla.

But from the first few moments, an issue began nagging at my common sense. What forces could have ever brought this couple together in the first place? Yes, they lived in semi-proximity on opposite sides of an inlet, but what traits did Raymond display at any time which would endear him to a much younger and more attractive woman? He was completely devoid of personality and humor, of meager financial means, physically unimpressive, weak-willed and submissive. Go to a young-singles bar looking and acting like Raymond and you will be going home alone.

Yet, he somehow so excited Carla, who could have her pick of younger and much more attractive men, that she chose to sneak around on her intimidating husband and engage in a risky, tawdry affair in parked cars and motels. If she wanted out of her marriage, why didn't she simply steal the satchel of money and run? Raymond was never portrayed as a dupe, as in Body Heat. Her passion for him is presented as real and unwavering, yet at no time did I honestly sense a real, explicable bond between these characters. For this story to work for me, Raymond would have to possess a lot more charm.

This deficiency detracted from my enjoyment of the movie somewhat and cost it one star. I still highly recommend it, but with a much more dynamic Raymond, it could have been a minor masterpiece.",1293840000,2,2023,4.875
4116064,4,B003EYVXWI,"If you liked ""Blood Simple"" and other such movies you're likely to enjoy this suspenseful thriller.  Like the earlier movie it's basically about two lovers who get caught in a complex web of trechery and violence.  However, the ending is disappointing. The screenwriter seems to simply run out of plot and, with nowhere to go, turns the film into Gunfight at the Ok Corral.  It's also a bit confusing because so many of the male characters look more or less alike.  Still, this is a lively, well-acted and directed film, definitely worth seeing.",1293667200,,545,4.827956989247312
4116065,4,B003EYVXWI,"The Square is yet another fine Austalian drama.  It tells of an affair, of betrayal, and revenge.  It is set in the construction site of a large road bridge.  An unlikely location for a powerful drama.
The opening scene in the rain where the leads are bonking furiously in an old Ford Laser may seem a bit off putting for some viewers (how could they fit in such a small vehicle).  The plot is unusual but highly believable leading to a dramatic and surprising finale.  They say The Square is a 'stroke of twisted genius' and I heartily concur.
As usual in Australian movies the leading actors are ably assisted by a team of polished minor characters, all drawn from Australian theatre and television.
I get The Square feeling this will become a Cult Film.
Mash Edgerton's direction and Luke Doolan's editing are tight and up to the highest standard.
Three and a half stars.",1292976000,,874,4.612903225806452

4116067,5,B003EYVXWI,"This is a real life kind of thriller , no glam or pathetic hollywood moral . Tells a story how one unfortunate decision of a individual is dragging down everybody's life who is involved .",1286064000,,187,4.371428571428571
4116068,4,B003EYVXWI,"I'll admit I'm a sap for the types of films that start out with an unelaborate plan and then everything gets intricate along the way. The Square is one nervy nail biter and a great deal of amusement and hazard to go with your fattening popcorn and liver disease causing soft drinks.

Highly recommended if you take pleasure in those films that include all the film noir staples: itching, sex, greed, lust, suspense, and partially black places with no place to hide.

The thriller aspect is very well done, with plot twists that keep you you alert and attentive.",1286064000,,561,4.656565656565657
