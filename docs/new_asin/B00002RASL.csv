Take a break: watch this film. Herzog in his best exploration of the unconcious, some may say. What is it about watching our fears take over? Let that camel alone! This movie was so unnerving for me 15 years ago that I still remember it in full.",973036800,2,410,5.323076923076923
1255879,3,B00002RASL,"I saw this on the big screen at a sparsely attended $1-showing in a notoriously liberal college, and several viewers left before it was over, frustrated, confused, and perhaps even disturbed.  The novelty of the  all-dwarf cast will wear off quickly for almost everyone, and one must be  nearly as strange as the film itself to sit through it all.  That said, I'm  glad I did.  The others touch on Hombre, who steals the show, and I'll just  mention that there's some really moving LOVE scenes in here too.  There are  also extended scenes of a car going around in circles, food fights,  tormenting blind midgets, and a big dead sow. This movie won't let you love  it, but one feels closed-minded in turning away.",958003200,12,713,4.624
1255880,4,B00002RASL,"Very disturbing film which gains in stature after re-viewing with the director Herzog's commentary.  As depressing as the film is, there is a lot of humor in it.  Herzog's obvious love for and delight with his cast shines  through.  Crispin Glover's contribution is minimal and a little puzzling.  This is a special film and if you are just now looking to get into Herzog's  work this is really not the place to start.  On DVD try Fitzcarraldo.",952732800,,444,4.688311688311688
1255881,3,B00002RASL,"This is a good film that is definitely something you WON'T see anywhere else.  The imagery alone sets it apart -- a prison rebellion led by some rather vicious, and many times comical midgets, forces you to keep  watching.
A really great performance by the midget Helmut D&ouml;ring aka  Hombre.  Some parts will disturb you, some will leave you holding your ribs  from the uncontrollable laughter (if you're into little people harassing  other blind little people, hotwiring cars etc. hehe)

1255882,5,B00002RASL,"A revolution has gripped a remote village/prison/asylum inhabited entirely by dwarves. Inside a fenced compound, one dwarf  holds another one hostage while the rest of the little people taunt the captor, threatening to  destroy everything. Then the tiny barbarians at the gate gleefully run  amok. They set flowers on fire, crucify monkeys, vandalize a car, and  unsuccessfully attempt sexual relations. In the climax, the captor  apparently kills the hostage (the action occurs off-screen) and then  hurries away until he confronts a gnarled tree. He angrily accuses the tree  of pointing at him. The last five minutes of the film show one of the  revolutionaries cackling at a distraught camel.
  Although the action  can be described, the plot is not prominent; this film exists as a series  of loosely connected scenes. These scenes are both hilarious and  disturbing; often I found myself simultaneously amused, agitated, and  confused. For example, the incessant, maniacal and high-pitched laughter  that accompanies the havoc wrought by the Lilliputian horde is extremely  unnerving yet engrossing.
  Though this film is unlikely to be on any  of those prevalent best-of-the-millennium lists, I believe that director  Werner Herzog has created the celluloid equivalent of a Goya painting. If  you are a devotee of the fringes of humanity and think that the cinema  should be more than just simple narratives, definitely watch this  astounding film.",945993600,28,1455,5.397321428571429
1255883,1,B00002RASL,"A while back I was getting into this Werner Herzog phase where I was systematically buying all of his movies.  ""Even Dwarfs Started Small"" was the one that put a stop to that.

Sure, there are plenty of off-putting Herzog movies.  Nobody would accuse the guy of being overly concerned with the visual or psychological comfort of his audience, but this movie is beyond the pale.

Supposedly this tale -- of an insurrection of dwarfs and midgets in a penal colony on the Canary Islands -- is meant to be an ""allegory of the larger world,"" at least according to the grand suggestions of various critics and commentators.

But that doesn't mean it's any good.  The allegorical nature of the events (charitably assuming they were intentional on the director's part) is inarticulate, poorly controlled, and goes nowhere.

A master allegorist is careful to not reveal too explicitly what he means his tale to embody, yet Herzog's ""restraint"" in this department is runs to a vice:  the story is so open-ended and promiscuously seeded that its events could stand for almost anything.

Which leaves us with just a colossally irritating story of dwarfs run amok.

As for Herzog, it's possible to be the best and still be overrated.  For me, this film was a reminder of that.",1212796800,8,1263,4.800925925925926

There's no definitive moral-political feel good resolution, there's no 'plot' as such. No sublime blasphemy, no obvious us-vs-them moral equivalance. Just blatant anarchy and futile revolution made silly and horrifying by a film, with midgets. The commentary by the director is worth a watch alone; if you find your self lost after watching, try again with the commentary on-you'll at least get a laugh out of that if you didn't during the film.

1255886,5,B00002RASL,"I saw this in a crappy 16mm print in Chicago (on a double feature with Fata Morgana).  The picture was quite faded, and the sound was muddled, and, yet, the brilliance of the film came through.  Now it's on DVD (in a great transfer by our friends at Anchor Bay), and it's an ever better film.  The film is essentially a bunch of dwarfs/little people taking over an asylum, and proceeding to destroy everything in sight.  You see cannibalistic chickens, a monkey crucified (not actually crucified, but the image is quite unique), flower pots soaked with kerosene, a camel, and a runaway truck.  Some of the dwarfs were injured in the film (one caught on fire, and another was run over by the truck...both survived, thankfully), and Herzog said to the crew that he would jump in a cactus patch if everyone survived the production.  They all did, and Herzog kept his word.  He recounts this story rather endearingly in Les Blank's short film ""Werner Herzog Eats His Shoe"" (which is on the Burden of Dreams DVD).  I really wasn't disturbed by the film, just strangely exhilarated.  It's a great piece of work.",1173225600,,1105,4.683937823834197
1255887,4,B00002RASL,"Werner Herzog's second feature film still retains its ability to both shock and disturb and highlights the maverick German's propensity to covet controversy and take risks. In it's depiction of a world entirely made up of dwarves he forces the audience to ask the uncomfortable question of what it is too be normal? The film's detailing of a dwarf uprising at an unnamed and mysterious institution, has an allegorical echo of the many protests and rebellions hitting the USA, Mexico and Germany itself around the turn of the decade. The question of normality thus takes on frightening and nightmarish tones when one considers the various human rights violations occurring in the world at that time. The sense of a nightmare also lends the film a strange and cloying atmosphere, not unlike that found in an effective horror film. The desolate and dead landscape of the Spanish island of Lanzarote only goes to reinforce this sense of fear and isolation and is one of the most effective spatial metaphors to surface in Herzog's cinema. He effortlessly exposes our deepest and innermost anxieties and how we take so many things for granted (such as opening a door or climbing onto a bed). Accusations of exploitation have been levelled at Herzog in regard to this film, but in reality he affords the dwarves a decency and humanity, and a sense of reality by the manner in which he shoots them and composes them in the shot. With an open ended narrative structure and an equally strange soundtrack, Herzog showed the world that his lexicon of film language was to be different. Not an intentional deconstruction like Godard, but a much more naturalistic form of film-making, film-making based on gut instinct. If one can persevere through the form and the nihilistic tone, one discovers a treasure trove overflowing with symbolism and metaphor, and at the film's conclusion a better understanding of the human condition.",1152662400,,1916,4.990625
1255888,4,B00002RASL,"Werner Herzog's second feature is set in Mexico and features a colony of dwarfs who revolt against their dictator. As Herzog later said, ""it's a dark desperate sort of film,"" that he cobbled together with a cast of dwarfs and a stolen camera from a film school. The revolution features chaos and anarchy, dwarfs through bottles of wine at a moving truck, light things on fire, and kill farm animals all to the tune of serene African music. I have no clue what this film means, but it is undeniably intriguing, the kind of film one would expect from a doped-up tribe in the Amazon. See it for yourself.",1135814400,,601,4.522935779816514
1255889,1,B00002RASL,"Just once I would like to hear that some ""art film"" director came out and admitted that he or she merely gathered a bunch of people (of whatever size), took them somewhere, told them to do as they would for a couple hours in front of a camera, then released the result in a rundown ""art"" theatre, just to see how many posers he or she could get to proclaim:  ""Fantastic!  Meaningful!  An unparalleled comment on the human condition!""

There is nothing here.  Period. And I refuse to submit to ""artsy correctness"" by stating otherwise.  So, unless one finds 90 minutes of gratuituous sadism, animal cruelty and mindless barbarism to somehow be a ""statement"" of something or other, then may I sincerely recommend one try a relatively uplifting film instead--like, say, anything by Brian Yuzna?",1122076800,10,791,4.822222222222222
1255890,5,B00002RASL,"I cannot believe it took me 35 years to discover this movie...

I mean, I love Herzog, I've seen at least a half dozen of his films - And I've long been an afficanado of weird cinema: I'm a huge fan of Jodorowsky and David Lynch, saw ERASERHEAD and SWEET MOVIE and SALO when they premiered in the theaters back in the 70s, and of course I have seen and long loved Tod Browning's FREAKS...

But seeing this last night for the first time was a revelation - It's as darkly funny and unsettling as ERASERHEAD or anything Lynch has done (funnier, even, I daresay) - Whether you want to take it as a Goya-esque barb at human civilization or comic apocalyptic nightmare, or just good weird fun, it's a masterpiece - Totally unforgettable images, on a par with THE HOLY MOUNTAIN or Matthew Barney's CREMASTER CYCLE - 'Hombre' the midget is hysterical, a wind-up toy part Curly Howard part Adolf Hitler - Don't let political correctness or animal rights get in the way of enjoying this surreal spoof (Herzog assures us in the commentary that no ainmals were injured here, apart from the pig which was butchered for food (I'm a vegetarian myself, but hey...)",1116201600,4,1148,4.567961165048544
1255891,5,B00002RASL,"Werner Herzogs EVEN DWARVES STARTED SMALL could be described to the uniniated as TERROR OF TINY TOWN crossed with RIOT IN CELL BLOCK FOUR. In this film inmates at a prison farm (or perhaps its a mental institution, the film is unclear) revolt, hold the head of the institution captive in his villa, and go around creating havoc and mayhem around the grounds of the institution. The warden (or what ever he is supposed to be) is holding one of the inmates tied up in his office. Now all of this would sound fairly ordinary, except the cast consists entirely of midgets and dwarves!

AUCH ZWERGE HABEN ANGEFANGEN (or EVEN DWARVES STARTED SMALL) is one those films that is hard to figure out. Some critics have said this film is about locking away societies freaks from the rest of the normal world, but that is hardly the case. In this films world everyone is apparently a midget or a dwarf, even though the sets are set to ordinary scale. The head of the institution is a midget. So is a woman from the outside who arrives briefly asking for directions (She drives a normal sized car). All in all it sounds like a film that was dreamed up as some ones idea of a joke.

This film is fun to watch, at least for the first quarter hour. After that the film starts to become rough going. The film really has no beginning and no real end. Its all middle. After awhile watching midgets commit endless acts of vandalism becomes tedious and boring. Half way through the film the inmates begin to commit acts of cruelty on animals, which makes the film rather unpleasant. The crucifixtion of a monkey on a cross is not my idea of good taste. This is one of those films that is unusual enough that I would recommend seeing it more than once, to try and understand it's true meaning.  Enjoy.",1109721600,3,1778,4.447852760736196

Even so, I found it boring, annoying, and unpleasant.  The 'message' was so unsubtle that I kept looking for something else, which did not appear.  How many times and for how long does one need to see someone laughing maniaically or a driverless car running in circles before one gets the point?

The use of dwarves seems in this later day, with our more evolved view of sexism, racism, agism, and whatever else, to be somewhat exploitative (sizism?).

1255901,5,B00002RASL,"I can't believe I hadn't seen or even heard about this insanely maniacal film for so many years. Although I've seen some of Herzog's later work with mixed reactions, EVEN DWARFS has made an undeniable and indelible mark on my brain. I thought it was going to be some stupid midget comedy (ala ""Terror of Tiny Town""), but instead it's a raw, disturbing nightmare of a world gone mad....and every actor in it is a midget (or ""little person""). Don't expect ""Wizard of Oz"" here, folks.... there are many stark images and an increasingly ominous mood throughout. Coupled with some scenes of mild animal abuse, you may want to keep your ""little people"" from watching this one. However, even with the sense of dread and psychosis, there is plenty of humor generated throughout from the cast of midgets who obviously gave their all. And Herzog's ""real life"" approach to filming makes his characters even more real -- they may look at the camera or react in real terror or laugh --- it's almost like Herzog has pulled us as viewers into his celluloid nightmare and we find ourselves reacting the same way as some of his cast are to the surrounding events. This is ultra-cinema.
Anchor Bay's DVD has a very enlightening commentary track by Herzog who clears up that the camel's knee ligaments were not severed for the film (the camel was not hurt in any way) and talks about how one of the midgets got run over and caught on fire during the shooting (he lived). He speaks about how stupid chickens are, too, and after you see the mouse scene with the stupid chicken walking back and forth a million times, you'll agree. Crazy actor Crispin Glover is also on the commentary track because apparently he was inspired by Herzog's film to make his own related upcoming ""dwarfs"" film (I can't wait).
EVEN DWARFS may not be for all tastes (if you find stuff like ""Forrest Gump"" entertaining - skip this one!). But, if you are MAD MAD MAD and like stuff like ""Eraserhead"" and ""Gummo"" - then check out these mad midgets. ""Hehehehehehehheheehehehe""....",983664000,23,2032,4.69467787114846

Like an abstract work of art it is something to be subjectively experienced.
It is stunningly visual, a pinnacle of Cinematography.
I can't think of any film more unique than this one, it is in its own genre.
The portrayal of dwarfs as actual human beings was revolutionary at the time and the intensity of their behavior is overwhelmingly fascinating, as it would be for any other ensemble of actors.
This is a brilliant nightmare of surrealism.
The cruelty of animals to each other is well documented here, and I am sure very offensive and distressing for some but reality is reality.
In a way I guess you could call it degenerate humor.
For me and the director, Werner Herzog, the most questionable (Satanic?) scene is the slow murder of a mother pig while her piglets continue to nurse. A bit too far I think.
This pig was slated for slaughter so it wasn't killed just for the sake of the film.
Make of it what you will.
Even Dwarfs Started Small is unapologetic and there is no  redemption.

This DVD release is mastered from a very good quality print but is not an HD restoration.
The commentary is useful, very insightful.

7916095,2,B00002RASL,"Werner Herzog was one of the most innovative and influential filmmakers of the twentieth century, and while much of his body of work is challenging and engrossing, ""Even Dwarfs Started Small"" is trying and generally repugnant by design. The film explores the differences between physical and mental freedom with a cast of little people. This is no ""Terror of Tiny Town,"" though, as is clear from the very opening featuring chicken cannibalism to a deliberately grating score (that reappears throughout the film.) Essentially the small inmates have taken over their asylum, while one of their number, Pepe (Gerd Gickel,) is tied to a chair and held hostage by the administrator in charge of the institution.

The film is short on linear plot and long on symbolism. It's very difficult to identify with or appreciate any of the characters (other than the two blind men who are ironically the smartest and only productive people in the institution) as they are universally loathsome and despicable, which gets to the point of the inhumanity of incarceration. The problem is that while revolution against inhuman conditions might be a plausible reason to identify with the inmates, their behavior is far more destructive and irrational than the rules of the institution itself, leading inescapably to the observation that some people aren't free because they cannot exist within any kind of reasonable societal norms. These antisocial tendencies are omnipresent, from scab eating to the serial taunting of Hombre (Helmut Dring,) the smallest of the inmates (leading to a wholly unnecessary subplot about attempted conjugal relations.) Without getting into too much detail, the inmates take over and immediately destroy all that's beautiful and good in their limited world: they burn flowers, commit wanton destruction on a palm tree, smash china, pointlessly kill a sow with piglets, and crucify a monkey (!) out of rebellion without consideration of their actions or their consequences (obviously more incarceration for the petty tyrants.) Food fights and gross attention deficit issues (they steal a car, fail to use it productively, and immediately steal a motorcycle, which suffers a similar pointless fate) underscore the total lack of civility at the institution, and makes the decision to institutionalize these people seem cogent, rational, and wholly defensible.

Distractions are everywhere (e.g. the subplot about the lost shoe that will just not go away,) but within all the malaise there are moments of genius. I was interested that when the inmates finally hotwired the car which could have allowed them to escape, they chose not to. Even they understood that they have no place in society, and instead trash the car which they rig to run in circles in the courtyard, paralleling not only their lives, but dovetailing with the gruesome footage of the chicken carrying a dead mouse back and forth because she doesn't know what to do with it or where it can be safely consumed. They make the car into a toy for breaking dishes, and in so doing abandon their only chance of escape, which is their only hope. The chickens feeding on themselves was an over-the-head symbolic bashing, and was another brilliant if repellant image. Even more insightful into the lives of the inmates is the scene with the bug collection. Insects are dressed as various members of a wedding party (""This is the grasshopper as the groom..."", ""I've got a spider with eight legs here; I was going to knit it a sweater."") While I was particularly amused by the beetle in the top hat as the best man, the bigger point of them controlling these bugs in their own little insect box was striking as they were doing it as a clear proxy for the control over their own lives that was absolutely lacking.

While much of the lugubriously-paced film is manic destruction, the most disturbing character interactions occur between Pepe and the headmaster, who alternately berates the inmates and tries to explain and justify institutional decision making in a variety of face-saving diatribes. Pepe's response is creepy and uniform throughout: he just smiles and laughs maniacally. Reason is clearly a commodity lacking on either side of the desk. While this is most likely viewed as an indictment of prisons, it really demonstrates that certain people cannot live freely, either mentally or physically. Most of the dialogue is stultifying, but there are moments of brilliance there also (""Before you are hanged you must comb your hair."") The conclusion is somewhat ambiguous as to what happens to Pepe (watch it yourself and see) but the headmaster eventually goes insane, concluding the film yelling at a tree accusingly, while the inmates taunt a camel.

I am genuinely mixed on how to appraise this movie. It's far longer than necessary and contains much to loathe, particularly the violence against animals. It's never OK to torture animals, and even though this was made long before the animal rights movement started, the brutalization of animals for no purpose other than to demonstrate sadism and destruction is morally repugnant and is the single biggest negative in my ultimate rating. On the other hand, the symbolism in the film is undeniably brilliant and the cinematography and sound creates the desired claustrophobic discomfort admirably. This is not one of Herzog's standout pieces, and is definitely not for the faint of heart. Compositionally and thematically this is an interesting exploration of man's inhumanity to man and what it means to be civilized, but the free-flowing rampaging and pointless brutality make this a real challenge to endure.

The DVD is in black and white with excellent subtitles, and the picture is generally sharp though it's obviously an older movie. The sound quality is quite good (though you might not enjoy what you are hearing, especially the musical interludes.) The disc comes with a commentary by Herzog, Crispin Glover, and Norman Hill. I might have understood more about Herzog's directorial choices if I had seen it, but it wouldn't play on either of my DVD players unfortunately. I would have loved to see it; maybe Herzog could have convinced me that more of his genius was onscreen than I detected on my own. If you are a Herzog collector or fan, this is indispensable; likewise those disposed to avant-garde cinema or prison trauma films might want to see this. For all others understand that the audience that will truly appreciate (much less enjoy) this film is, much like the cast, extremely small.",1333238400,3,6534,5.0914179104477615

I didn't think this could actually be a movie but after a little research I came across ""Even Dwarfs Started Small"". I have no idea what was said during the whole movie, not entirely sure what the language was. Germanic in origin I think. This movie is all about rebellion, on a surprisingly large scale, ironically enough. If you're a fan of Herzog's work this is at least worth a look, but be forewarned that you may not be able to sit through the whole film - it tends to drag and the high-pitched voices are tedious on the ears very quickly.",1312416000,,670,4.2015503875969
7916097,1,B00002RASL,"Even for Werner Herzog fans, this film might be too weird.  I know it was for me.  Aimless, meandering, with no plot, no story, and no meaning.  Kind of absurdist, but without the entertainment value of an absurdist masterpiece like ""Un Chien Andalou"".

I think anybody who sees a deeper meaning in this film other than a pointless exercise in trying to be ""intellectual"", or ""artistic"" is really seeing something that doesn't exist.  The meaning is not there. It does not exist. The emperor is wearing no clothes (sorry Werner, you just didn't pull it off this time).  And I say this as somebody who really enjoys ""art films"".  There's no metaphorical statement, there's no thought-provoking story, there is definitely no entertainment value in the film. Just a bunch of little people running around doing dumb things.

If you are new to Herzog films, start with something more accessible, such as ""Aguirre, The Wrath of God"", or ""Fitzcarraldo"", or even ""Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans"".",1288656000,,998,4.934131736526946
7916098,4,B00002RASL,"This perplexing, but very funny, film is like an ""Our Gang"" comedy, with dwarfs starring as insane asylum residents who run amok.  I cannot tell you what the subtext is, and there is not much of a plot.  The actors, all dwarfs, are very good and interesting.  They were all very expressive and mesmerizing.  I was struck when I watched it, how so very good-looking some of these actors/actresses were.  Even those who didn't possess a conventional beauty were interesting and appealing.

  Throughout the film, you hear them laugh:  sometimes it is infectious, endearing; other times it is maniacal, obnoxious.  Throughout the film, a strange lugubrious lamentation in Spanish is heard.  Some of Herzog's motifs in this film:  cannibalizing chickens, a dead, nursing sow, two blind dwarfs whose white sticks are taller than they are, and they use them as one would use sticks to break a pinata.

Towards the end of the film, the dwarfs become very excited and obsessed over the idea of burning plants which are in full bloom.  The old truck goes around and around (as did the truck in ""Stroczek"", a five star, ""must-see film""!) as many potted plants are doused with a flammable substance and set aflame.

This film is definitely worth seeing; I don't know that I really took anything away from it, other than I was entertained in a way that I had not been entertained before.  It was not exploitive like ""Freaks"".  The dwarfs were the stars of the show (only dwarfs in this movie) and treated with respect.  You'll never see a movie like this again, and it has Werner Herzog's fingerprints all over it.  I watched this from an inter-library loan, but I like it so much, I'm going to buy my own copy.

What more can you ask for in a film?",1283385600,2,1737,4.651315789473684
7916099,4,B00002RASL,"I used to love Werner Herzog movies. I still think he is fantastic, but some of his films, especially early ones like ""Even Dwarfs Started Small,"" are really starting to show their age. Still, this might be the ultimate 1960s-70s nihilistic Continental European art film experience.

Starring a cast made up of entirely little people, this movie has kind of a ""the lunatics have taken over the asylum"" theme. Anti-authoritarian in the extreme, it is not a picture for the faint of heart. It starts right out with cannibalistic chickens and moves on to abuse of animals, abuse of the blind, abuse of authority, abuse of fellow human beings... Just abuse all around, really.

The movie revels in the absurd, starting with the entire premise of a world of only little people and going right through the main story elements and visual gags used in the movie -- like a car set to run around and around in circles by itself while little people do whatever they can to rain down destruction all around it.

At the start of the film, the style and tone reminded me of the parody of nihilistic Continental European art films from an episode of Monty Python, where a woman is sitting in a garbage dump on a stool with a cabbage, and a nervous Frenchman smokes a cigarette nearby and eventually says ""I see you have a cabbage,"" pauses for a while and then blurts out ""I am a revolutionary."" That's really the level of message and complexity seen here.

I'm really glad there were Continental European filmmakers in the 1960s and 1970s who made movies like this one. God bless Werner Herzog. Watching this is a blast from the past. But I can't say it's a pleasant or uplifting experience. I'm glad that films like this that revel exclusively, or at least almost exclusively, in the dark side of human nature without taking the light into account have fallen out of fashion.

Still, it's important to see something like this every once in a while. Recommended, but not for people who get easily upset at things like the abuse of animals, the disabled, or people in general.",1263340800,,2060,4.648351648351649
7916100,5,B00002RASL,"This is one of the most grotesque and disturbing films to come out of any director's mind since -- well, since anytime. With a premise as twisted as the cast members' little bodies (dwarfs and midgets stage an inmates' uprising in an insane asylum), ""EDSS"" is a one-of-a-kind film (""Freaks"" and ""Terror of Tiny Town"" don't have a patch on this) that will leave you seared and scarred with its bizarre tableaux. Some of the situations are darkly humorous - for example, the  midget known as ""Hombre"" (Helmut Doring) repeatedly tries and fails for nearly five minutes of the film to scale a normal-sized brass bed so he can make love to the tiny woman up top -- all the while being watched through a crack in the door by a group of tiny, giggling voyeurs. Method acting at its finest. But the film's atmosphere of suffocating nausea (the all-German dialog with English subtitles tends to heighten this effect) is strong stuff. If you have a refined sense of the absurd, you might enjoy this grainy, full-frontal assault on your sanity. But DO exercise some discretion: I took a date - a woman who spoke fluent German - to see this film at Portland State in 1977 thinking it was a comedy a la ""The Little Rascals"". You can probably guess how that evening ended. Nevertheless, EDSS really *is* a classic, which deserves more than one viewing, so I give it 5-stars.",1233273600,,1360,4.619834710743802
7916101,3,B00002RASL,"Werner Herzog's black and white 1970 film, Even Dwarfs Started Small (Auch Zwerge Haben Klein Angefangen) is one of those films that is beyond such grounded definitions as good and bad, and, like its American predecessor, Freaks, is simply one of the oddest films ever made. Bad critics have praised it for all the wrong reasons- such as being a statement on politics, the Vietnam War, the partition of Germany, against religion, and prudish ignorants have condemned it for similarly wrong reasons. Yet, few have ever watched it all the way through with unsparing eyes. It is a film that has a very sparse narrative structure, seeming improvisations, yet it is clearly not an early example of Postmodern preening, nor is it an amorphic surreal mess in the Warhol Factory mode. It is, however, like Freaks, neither as good nor bad as its greatest champions nor detractors claim it is. In fact, as one of the earliest films in the Herzog canon, made concurrently with the `documentaries' Fata Morgana and The Flying Doctors Of East Africa, it far more resembles such low budget 1960s black and white horror masterpieces as Herk Harvey's Carnival Of Souls, Francis Ford Coppola's Dementia 13, and George Romero's Night Of The Living Dead, or even the low budget 1960s films of American maverick filmmaker Sam Fuller. Yet, it is both a horror film and a black comedy.... Yet, the film, also written by Herzog, is not about rebellion, but weak anomy and enervation, for nothing is accomplished in the end, except mindless anarchism. The screenplay, such as it is, is virtually nonexistent, and, save for the soliloquies of the asylum boss, none of it matters, in terms of content. The film was shot on one of the Spanish Canary Islands, Lanzarote, which is a bleak volcanic wasteland, and mostly from the eye level of the dwarves, which adds to the monstrous feel that the `normal things' take on. That it only runs 96 minutes is a good choice, but if the film was only 70 or so minutes in length it would be even more effective. As it is, it as an oddball film that fits no categories, is beyond good and bad, yet also an early example of Herzog's continuing filmic war against the evil of nature- which Herzog sees as despairingly immanent. For the rest of us, the sights and sounds of the two sickest of the dwarves- Pepe and Hombre- laughing maniacally until they both seem ready to drop dead, is one of the most bizarre and powerful images recorded on film, as well as one of the scariest. It may not mean a damned thing, but it sure packs a wallop. Would that every film could say even that much.",1221004800,2,2597,4.660130718954249
