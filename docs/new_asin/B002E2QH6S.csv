8366793,5,B002E2QH6S,I absolutely loved this! It was one of the workouts that felt SO rewarding! I've been watching for the availability of this DVD so I can purchase it!,1487289600,,149,4.357142857142857
8366794,3,B002E2QH6S,"So the music is not terrible but not great and they have Drum and Base playing during the cool down and meditation parts which is kind of odd. A bit fast moving so not great for beginners. Cool looking people, different setting. A nice alternative.",1382918400,,248,4.533333333333333
8366795,5,B002E2QH6S,"I've tried many different yoga workouts (DVDs and classes), and this one is my favorite.  Chaos does a wonderful job of creating sequences that flow, so they that feel naturally progressive.  She repeats the moves enough times for you to feel stronger and more flexible without repeating the moves so many times that you get bored (common problem for me when doing yoga).  She also incorporates some nice toning sequences (specific yoga moves, such as chair squats, done in quick succession) for both the upper and lower body.

The meditation portion also leaves you in a nice calm headspace (and this from someone who always gets bored with meditation).

I like the music too, although I'm not qualified to say whether it's real punk music.  It helps focus my mind and it's playing quietly enough that it's not distracting or jarring.  If it's not your kind of music, you can always opt for the ""no music"" audio option.

Overall, I would highly recommend this to anyone who's looking for a yoga practice that's fun, challenging, and engaging.",1339372800,2,1043,4.853107344632768
