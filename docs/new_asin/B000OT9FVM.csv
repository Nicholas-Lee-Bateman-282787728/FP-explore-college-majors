8186580,2,B000OT9FVM,"Just saw the video and very disappointed. I'm sure Bernie has substantial knowledge in trading options but he didn't go into details with each of the 10 things he talked about.  Also, I don't know if there's any secrets to what he talked about unless you're a complete novice.  However, if you're a novice then you wouldn't understand what he's talking about in this video because he doesn't cover anything with examples.  I'm not a novice but I still didn't know what he said because of lack of examples.  Also, the way he speaks is very very boring.  He doesn't seem to get to the point at all.  When it's all said and done, you wonder what the hell did he just talked about.  This video is a taped version of one of his seminars in some sort of big meeting room in a hotel or business building.  Again, all he does in this video is just looking at the overhead screen projector already printed info and doesn't go into details with some writings or drawings of his own while speaking.  I felt like I was in a very boring class room I took while I was in college where you just couldn't wait till it's over.  NOT WORTH 100 BUCKS FOR THIS VIDEO!  Get a used version if you still want to see him talk.",1283990400,6,1201,4.269911504424779
