8188721,4,B000P3K3OK,"I love Naushad's music direction, Mahamad Rafi's singing, songs, dances and the dialogs.
I watch the movie frequently. Very enjoyable.

I dislike the fact that the DVD does not work on one of my players",1403308800,,202,4.771428571428571
8188722,2,B000P3K3OK,"I've been studying South Asia so I thought I'd watch some movies by people in the region. The movies arrived quickly but the sound quality is terrible and the DVDs themselves skip and get stuck on my computer, my parents' DVD player, and every other DVD player you put them on. The movies themselves have great storylines and music, but the DVDs are really poor quality.",1269388800,,370,4.621212121212121
8188723,5,B000P3K3OK,"`Kohinoor' is a 1960 black and white Hindi movie sutitles in Urdu and English. Very popular when it was released, three of the most famous artists of the time- Dilip Kumar, Meena Kumari and Jeevan have teamed up to do a remarkable job of acting. It is a long show (two and a half hours), with a story line of the prince and princess in love reuniting after facing tremendous obstacles. The best aspect of the movie is the music. Every song is worth listening to again and again. The dance performances by `Narthaki Rajalakshmi' are remarkable in that she has an unbelievably flexible body and classical dance background. Both Meena Kumari and Dilip Kumar capture the audience with their talent, looks, and powerful presence. An excellent movie to watch, for the old time's sake.",1258156800,3,778,4.770370370370371
