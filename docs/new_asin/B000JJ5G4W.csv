2672497,5,B000JJ5G4W,This movie is one of the heart achiest movies I have seen in a long time. My stomach sinks when I even think about it. It is a really honest look at relationships and the idea that no matter how much you love someone you will never be perfectly happy. The acting is brilliant and there are so many poignant moments...... but I can't write any more because I am folding into a foetal rock even thinking about them. It's so so lovely but I don't want to watch it ever again. the end.,1171756800,10,481,4.127659574468085
2672498,4,B000JJ5G4W,"""Conversations with Other Women"" employs one interesting experimental narrative technique - dual frames -- but that should not discourage you from seeing this unique, intelligent and most of all romantic film. It is a love story about two grown-up people played by Helena Bonham-Cater and Aaron Eckhart, and their visible chemistry virtually carries the film, making it a sweet and poignant romance.

The film is set in a Manhattan hotel where a wedding ceremony has just been over. We are introduced to a man (Aaron Eckhart) and a woman (Helena Bonham-Carter) meeting each other after 10 years' separation since their last break-up. The man is now dating with another woman while the woman is living in London, but as they exchange words, they (and we) realize that the love between them might not be perfectly over.

This simple plot is told with dual frames, which means you are watching the screen divided into two parts - right and left - and both frames follow the two persons in different time or the same two persons from different angles. The similar technique is seen in ""Timecode"" (which split the screen into four) and some scenes of popular TV series ""24"" and this visual experience would be pretentious to some, innovative to another, but to most of us it would be neither because the entire film is tactfully edited, so the double frames would not just bother you if they do not impress. I for one like a traditional single frame approach better and that's the reason I decided to give one star less.

Greatest thing about the film is the romantic feelings between the two characters sincerely and credibly played by two leads. Like Julie and Ethan in ""Before Sunset,"" we can feel the happiness and sadness of the two, which is genuinely touching to see. The film is very talky because of its setting, but most of us would not mind it because of the bitter-sweet moments expressed in a very subtle way. And don't forget Carla Bruni's songs which are all fantastic.",1171670400,22,1979,4.763848396501458
2672499,5,B000JJ5G4W,This film is obviously the result of much creative talent.  The use of split screen provides the audience the sensation of watching live theater.  Honest and true emotion by the actors make the best of an intelligent script.,1171411200,5,224,4.868421052631579
2672500,1,B000JJ5G4W,"(1 1/2*'s)  'Conversations with Other Women' is a gabby flick that has two old flames sparring with one another after his sister's wedding.  She's the seventh bridesmaid, neatly enough.  Generically named, the man (Aaron Eckhart) and the woman (Helena Bohlan Carter) are boorish and egotistical; each with enough baggage to fill the refuse for the entire wedding reception.  I'm not sure if the unnamed characters are meant to be universal (like the ""everyman"") or if the writers merely want them to be mysterious, but, either way, we are stuck with two empty suits we'd rather not know about any way.  She regards him with the interest of a casual maneater.  He's obsessed with her, but his conversations with her in her hotel room are so laced with  vanity that we can only think they deserve one another.  Sort of like a soap opera version of Sarte's 'No Exit,' where ""hell is other people,"" there are at least a few redeeming traits.  First of all, they are both attractive actors, and, except for their repulsive characters' personalities, they do have some sexy, seductive moments, complete with music sung by a French woman singer.  Then, there's the fact this debacle clocks in before an hour and a half, a measure of mercy for the audience.  (In all fairness, Eckhart and Carter do an excellent job with such trivial material.)  To provide an example, after making love, she goes into the bathroom and calls a lover on her cell phone while he calls and leaves a message with her husband.  Then, he interrupts her with sarcasm as she makes flippant remarks about her own rudeness.  With dialogue that is the epitome of banality, and a split screen image throughout the entire film, we all become schizoid with a novelty technique that was used and discarded in the late sixties.  (It was used to highlight key scenes in 'Charlie' and 'Woodstock' and resurrected briefly in 'Sideways,' but was even regrettable there.)  By all means, if you must insist on a riveting chick flick, then see 'Lake House,' pull out 'Terms of Endearment,' or even see 'The Break Up,' but, believe me, I'm offering ""Night-time savings' time"".  Don't bother renting 'Conversations with Other Women'.",1169251200,5,2183,4.872628726287263
2672501,4,B000JJ5G4W,"Aaron Eckhart--Thank you for Smoking, stars alongside Helena Carter in this movie based on the premise of ""two sides to every love story.""

If you have ever watched a show of 24, you can appreciate the ""split screen"" approach.  In that show, they use ""split screen"" as a way to show what's going on, one character may be on location, and the other is at the office, seeing both is obviously better than seeing one just talking on the phone.

In this movie, Director Hans Canosa, takes this several steps further, he uses this as a way to show what happened in the past (instead of just showing flashbacks) in real time as it is happening, he also uses this to show future events, while we are still in the present-- such as the couple still being in the room on one screen, and walking down the hall in another at the same time.  He also uses this to show both points of view, similar to how when you are in the real world, and think up what or how you might say something, each viewport centers on each characters own interpretations of what is going on.  There is also the lovely approach of having both screens try and ""come together"" which adds a nice symbolic touch to the film.

Some people will give up on this movie because of the ""split screen"" way of shooting.  However, those who can learn to appreciate such a device will enjoy this film.  The film is peppered with witty banter between Eckhart and Carter and the main reason I enjoyed the movie.

Another reviewer stated, the title is ""Conversations with Other Women,"" and one would expect it to include ""other women,""  However after reflecting a bit on the movie, you can see it lives up to its name.  You have Man and Woman in their late thirties, as well as their early twenties.  They have been apart for ten years,  and as anyone older than ten can tell you, your quite a different person now than you were ten years ago.

Heroes fans will also be happy to hear, that the twenties version of ""Woman"" is played by the beautiful and talented Nora Zehetner, while she has only a few speaking roles, her parts do add to the films overall enjoyment.

I give this a 4 out of 5.  I still think the use of ""split screen"" should be in small doses; however, this movie makes it work. Should you choose to buy this DVD, I feel you can't help but enjoy it, the concept of showing both viewpoints of the characters at the same time works to great effect in this movie.  I do not wish to give any plot points away, suffice it to say the concept of the movie is handled to great effect.  I haven't seen a movie with such engaging dialogue in a while, and the chemistry between the two actors is superb, nothing missing or lacking in this movie at all.",1168732800,51,2704,4.3313492063492065
2672502,5,B000JJ5G4W,"Hans Canosa made an important decision when he made this film. Up until Conversations With Other Women there have only been a few directors that have attempted to portray a film in a split screen format.  ""Timecode"" and Andy Warhol's ""Chelsea Girls"" gave it a shot and both failed miserably because they lacked the strength of direction, cast and script.

Unlike the other films, Canosa uses the split screen to represent the rift that's developed between the two characters in the film and furthermore the conflicting opinions that each person presents.  Conversations grabs you - to the point where you feel like a viewer no more.  You are watching two people bounce opinions and witty remarks back and forth, much as you would eavesdropping on a couple arguing next to you on a long train ride.  You are drawn to actions and reactions - waiting and wanting to see what will happen next - hoping to get a glimpse of who they are and what brought them to this.

Conversations has the right recipe to do this with Aaron Eckhart and Helena Bonham Carter as the lead characters - two extremely versatile great actors that have excellent chemistry: chemistry that's clearly visible in this film.  Just as importantly, Gabrielle Zevin's story and script shines in a film where it absolutely needed to. One of the brightest and most intelligent films of 2006.",1168560000,13,1354,4.810344827586207
2672503,2,B000JJ5G4W,"There are several things that are vital and basic to the importance of a successful film. First is the screenplay. Then acting. Then sets. The further down the list we go, the less important the items are to the success of the movie. But if you screw up too many of the latter items, the earlier ones begin to falter because of them, and this is why CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHER WOMEN failed as an entertainment venue.

The screenplay was well done, focusing on two people with no names (""Man"" played by Aaron Eckhart and ""Woman"" by Helena Bonham Carter). They ""meet"" at a wedding in Los Angeles and sexual sparks begin flying. Man makes several flirting attempts and Woman knocks him down. But Man persists and eventually succeeds in getting to Woman's hotel room. Here we begin to suspect and learn much about this pair. They are not strangers and have a destructive relationship from years before. In the end, Woman must fly back to London in the morning while Man returns to his much younger girlfriend.

The acting of Eckhart and Carter is admirable and their line deliveries are pithy, funny, and often heart-wrenching.

Where we come into problems is on almost every other level of the film. First we have to mention the title of the film, Conversations With Other Women. Titles are important to viewers. They help tie the story being told with what's been advertised. But this title has absolutely nothing to do with the story, as there is only one woman and they do much more than simply converse.

Once we enter the hotel room, the sets become very dark and almost grainy. The sex scene is practically non-existent and very forced.

And finally we have to look at the entire film being done in split screen. The big question is why? Doing art for the sake of art is ridiculous and many viewers may come away feeling as if director Hans Canosa used this medium simply to create ""something different."" That's bad. Very bad. This may not have been Canosa's intention, but it certainly comes off feeling that way. It added a major distraction to the enjoyment of the film rather than giving it any sense of originality.",1168560000,7,2121,4.660427807486631
2672504,4,B000JJ5G4W,"There are so many conventional movies about adulterous chance meetings that the prospects of another one wouldn't seem to be too promising. However, director Hans Canosa takes a rather novel approach with this small-scale 2006 indie film in looking at the illicit one-night stand with a pervasive split-screen process. Most often, the two sides reflect the perspectives from the man and woman at the center of the story, and at other times, we see their individual memories as flashbacks to their youthful courtship. Initially, the gimmicky aspect of watching the duality of the action is rather jarring, but it gradually becomes a dramatically effective means for exhibiting the dynamics of the two characters in real time. Gabrielle Zevin's sharply delineated, often amusing dialogue also helps to bring an immediacy to what could have been a predictably drawn situation.

The intimate, verbose plot itself turns on several contrivances, some more forgivable than others (like the absence of names for the lovers and the misunderstanding arising from matching cell phones). Regardless, it's really the adroit charm and emotional dexterity of the actors that sets this movie apart. Playing yet another rascally man-child, Aaron Eckhart adds shades of mid-life romantic vulnerability that make his character likably flawed. But the picture really belongs to Helena Bonham Carter's richly textured performance as the woman, easily her best work since 1997's ""The Wings of the Dove"". As a complacent married woman who feels herself hurtling palpably toward forty, she provides such revealing nuance with each scene that I ended up wondering more about her character's fate than his. With her sad dark eyes and pouty mouth, she looks more like legendary French actress Jeanne Moreau as the years pass, an instant passport for world-weary gravitas.

Shot in only thirteen days and with a running time of only 84 minutes, the movie is quite small in scope, but it is also a relatively undiscovered gem that will hopefully take on new life on DVD. Speaking of which, the 2007 DVD has a surprisingly robust number of extras beginning with Canosa's thoughtful commentary track. Also included are an entertaining 25-minute interview with an easily bantering Eckhart and Carter from the Telluride Film Festival; an insightful five-minute short with the director showing a demo of his dual-camera filmmaking technique; a helpful four-minute explanation of why split-screen was used specifically for the film; and a less interesting, more technical twenty-minute demonstration of how Canosa used Apple Final Cut Pro software to make his complex edits.",1168473600,23,2639,5.356626506024097
2672505,4,B000JJ5G4W,"I love Aaron Eckhart, he has done some great acting. Haven't seen Bonham Carter much, since I don't watch Tim Burton movies, but this was a good study in male/female relationships, and why there isn't always a happy ending. The dialogue was witty and engaging, although Eckhart played against type in this role. He usually plays despicable characters who NO ONE could or would ever love in the first place. Bonham Carter is a beautiful woman to look at though (strange how I never really noticed that before; maybe because Tim Burton makes her look hideous in most of those silly ""monster"" roles she plays) so looking at her in her natural beauty was refreshing. And that ROCK STAR hair of hers was AWESOME!! It was also refreshing to see her not be so self-conscious about the nearly nude scenes she does, where similar actresses would be VERY worried about how they don't have a ""perfect"" figure and use body doubles. (at least, it didn't seem like she wasn't the person on screen). Overall, the plot had lots of promise, and the split-screen technique at least made it more engaging. However, in the end, it would not be a movie I would recommend highly. There are certainly more entertaining movies out there along these lines with better plots.",1386288000,,1249,4.73394495412844

2672509,4,B000JJ5G4W,"We came home in the wee hours after a midnight showing of Les Miserables and while brushing my teeth, turned on this show with Helena Bonham Carter looking very contemporary and gorgeous.  Poor thing has been with Tim Burton and Tom Hooper so long one forgets she used to be something of a femme fatale and not just a freak.  In Les Miserables she plays the innkeeper's thieving, sluttish wife, the mother of poor Eponine, a heartless slattern with a touch of old De Sade in her veins.  Well, maybe she's a little bit cruel as ""Woman"" in Conversation(s) With Other Women(oh, what a title, they should have just called it, The Good-Looking Miserable Ones--in the film she plays the wife of a London cardiologist who once met and married young Aaron Eckhart (played by another actor in his 20s) who left him and broke his heart--the Don Juan whose finally meets his match, a lovely conceit and Eckhart plays it well.  All you hear about is the split screen but it didn't really bother me all that much, not like the scenes of Helena Bonham Carter's makeup remaining untouched after a long shower and blowdrying her hair through a long Eckhart soliloquy about what he should do about his present day girlfriend, Sarah, sexy and 24.  This seemed improbable but in real life men are constantly turning to newer models for sexual excitement, I suppose.  The new movie SAFE HAVEN gives us the spectacle of Julianne Hough, also 24, falling in love with Josh Duhamel, also 40, as though it were absolutely nothing.  I mean, I sort of felt sorry for Sarah but hey, she'll get over it, she's no Camille Claudel.

Naturally we stayed awake the rest of the night to see what was going to happen in the remaining 74 minutes of the movie, especially to the pallid pink formal that Helena Bonham Carter (""Woman"")(maybe it would be shorter to just call her Helena Bonham Woman) is forced to wear as a bridesmaid.  I know what would cheer people up!  A movie in which bridesmaids' dresses do not horrify the lead actresses cast as the bridesmaids, but instead made them look better than their usual sex outfits.  That would dispose of at least two dozen romcoms I have sat through, but maybe it's time for that annual pull-Shoah-off-the-shelf spree anyhow.",1360886400,,2238,4.669211195928753
2672510,5,B000JJ5G4W,"If you like aaron eckhardt and helena bonham carter, this is a must-see film. They both give very convincing performances as former lovers who never quite got over each other and, after running into eachother at a wedding, decide to spend the night together in a hotel room. Its a sad, sad movie. Although the reunion was actually engineered by ex (and now expat) Helena, now living in London, who came to the states, she claims,as a last-minute favor to the bride (aaron's sister)who was one bridesmaid short, even though the two women were not particularly close (indeed, helena wasn't even on the original guest list). However, she might have thought twice about engineering the meet-up had she known the extent to which aaron was still smitten. As the possibility of their sleeping together takes on an air of inevitability, Helena frets: ""No good can come of this,"" while, for aaron, who has pined for her for so long, has no such ambivalence.  He uses every ounce of charm that  an aging faun (of 38!) can muster and when that doesn't work, careens manically from insults to heart-wrenching pleas to threats to create trouble between Helena and her cardiologist husband. Aaron's the romantic of the two--amour, toujour l'amour. Helena, while no cold fish--to the contrary, she, too longs for the passion that she never found with anyone else--she also hasn't forgotten the drama that went along with it and isn't interested in getting back on the rollercoaster (having found ""happiness,"" or, more accurate, achieved a state of being ""not unhappy"" and, anyway, is too good a soul to up and leave a caring husband and/or the children. Aaron, too, is in a committed relationship, but not as committed; no marriage vows, children, etc.; if she's settled for a safe haven, he's in a holding pattern. Anyway, I've said too much already.

Two guests meet at a wedding in Manhattan. At first we think that it is a chance meeting of strangers who may or may not indulge in a one night stand.

Except that circumstances are against them. The man mostly refuses to grow up and the woman is stably if boringly married and neither are entirely willing to throw comfortable circumstances to the wind to pursue what may be only a romantic dream.

The dialogue and emotional resonance of the actors as they explore these circumstances is compelling and affecting. Will love conquer all? Or is it too late?

2672516,4,B000JJ5G4W,"The core of this short movie is the dialogue between ""Man"" (Aaron Eckhart) and ""Woman"" (Helena Bonham Carter).  It seemed obvious from the very beginning that these two knew each other and were trying to reconnect, but were unsure about the other and thus were being very defensive and tentative about it.  Their conversation is dominated by the retraction of these defensive lies and evasions.  The long-established _convention_ is for such stories to move closer and closer to the truth, it also allows for detours where one deception or evasion replaces another.  And that the choice of the deception/evasion can reveal much about the character.

The constantly shifting sands of what the viewer believes about the relationship kept me fully engaged.  In reading other reviews here, I found myself disagreeing with some of what they claimed were the facts behind the two characters, and I view this as a positive testament to the challenge of following the shifting situation.

My focus kept me from having any emotional identification with the characters themselves or their situation.  Viewers who are likely to experience the movie from such a perspective should look at other reviews--my sense is that _some_ such viewers tend to have significant problems with this movie.

The use of split screen is effective in keeping this movie from being visually boring.  Much of the dialogue benefits from seeing the face and body language of the characters, but having only talking heads can be tedious.  Sometimes you see contrasting viewpoints; sometimes flashbacks; sometimes just what a wandering eye would see.  Sometimes the second view was distracting: I wanted to focus on the talking head, or even close my eyes to better hear what was behind the words.  But this overload is part of the challenge of the movie.

The movie perpetrates several _unnecessary_ frauds on the audience, and I usually react strongly against such, but here I was willing to let it pass.  For example: The movie opens with the two talking to each other as if they were total strangers.  If they had had an audience _within_ the movie that they were trying to mislead, this would have been understandable, but they are alone off to the side and we are the only audience.

4 stars because the movie's charm was ephemeral for me: fun while it lasted, but nothing memorable.",1270598400,,2353,4.976982097186701
2672517,5,B000JJ5G4W,"This 84 minute film, shot in around two weeks, edited by hand on a Mac and employing a decidedly different visual appearance might seem to viewers to be too low budget or hand-made to be worth watching.  However, if you do watch it, you'll find it a rich, interesting and captivating gem of a film, well worth the effort it takes to find it!

The film centers around two people - never named - who meet at a wedding reception and share an intense chemistry.  Flirting turns to passion - and that's where the interesting part of the story begins: in the conversations that follow.

The technique of shooting in split screen could easily have turned into a gimmick or an Oscar bid with bigger-budget movies.  Here, however, it is perfectly used - providing two sides of the same story, past and present, here and there and point of view.  We as an audience can edit the film ourselves, and while the process does take time to get used to, it leaves us with a film that will change every time we see it and gives us an almost infinite opportunity to notice new things.

But the real showcase of this film is not the visuals or the budget: it is the acting.  Helena Bonham-Carter soars as the far-from-home, potentially unhappy Woman, managing to show both comedic timing and realistic heartbreak.  Not to be outdone, Aaron Eckhart gives a convincing performance as the witty yet troubled Man, and provides a perfect Yang to Bonham-Carter's Yin.  The two actors have incredible chemistry, making the flirtatious opening scenes even more convincing, and fun.

The DVD itself has some pretty nice extras, including an interview with Aaron and Helena that was not widely released in addition to a feature commentary with the director and a few other, more technical extras.  Also worth mentioning is the soundtrack, most of which is by French singer/songwriter and recent First Lady, Carla Bruni, whose folk voice lends the perfect atmosphere to the action.

In short, this is not a film to miss.

This is an intriguing movie.  I normally don't like films that are all dialogue, but ""Conversations with Other Women"" hooked me pretty quickly.  I think it's all down to the fact that Helena Bonham-Carter and Aaron Eckhart having a great deal of charisma and chemistry together and the fact that the dialogue rings true and sparkles.

As for the split screen depiction, initially I found myself hoping it would go away, but once I settled into the movie, I didn't mind it and thought it sometimes added to the story (but it would be interesting to see a version where most everything was done on one screen).

Turning to the story, it's pretty simple.  Bonham-Carter and Eckhart meet at a wedding.  At first, they way they talk, you would think they don't know each other.  But then you start to realize and the film reveals that they were once married and that marriage ended with Bonham-Carter's character packing up and moving to London and marrying an older man.  Eventually, the two (ex)lovers retire to her hotel room and have sex and talk about the past and the future.

I think it's a testimony to the chemistry that the two stars have and the dialogue of the film that I did not find their actions sleazy or reprehensible (Bonham-Carter's character cheating on her husband and Eckhart cheating on his much younger girlfriend).  Through their conversations and the flashbacks shown on the split screen, we see just how much love and passion once existed between them.  I'm left with the opinion that their divorce happened so quickly and they were cut off from each other so rapidly, their love didn't die but just went on hiatus...only to come back at full burn when they met again at the wedding.

I'm left wondering what would happen after the story ended.  Frankly, it's hard to see how either of them could have just gone back to where they were before (for example, Bonham-Carter's character's protestations that she's happy in her life in London ring false...and Eckhart makes it very clear that he never got over her).  I'd like to think that in the fictional world where these two lovers exist, Bonham-Carter's character did return to London and wound up her marriage there before coming back to Eckhart's character in New York.  I couldn't help but notice that the split screen finally united at the very end of the movie and perhaps that symbolizes a hopeful future.

The movie isn't perfect.  I thought that a bit of the sex scene in the hotel was rather graphic (not for me, but older and more conservative people would probably be put off by it).  Also, the idea that the two characters would have identical cell phones that would allow Bonham-Carter's character to answer a call from Eckhart's girlfriend seemed a bit improbable (as did the idea that the girlfriend would not have instantly realized why this had happened).  But those aren't significant enough flaws to take away from the rewarding experience that watching the film was for me (and I bought a copy from amazon.com right before posting this).",1249776000,2,3051,4.797323135755258
2672521,4,B000JJ5G4W,"The film starts as a casual meeting of a man (Aaron Eckhart) and a woman (Helen Bonham Carter) on the wedding banquet in a New York City Hotel. They seem to know each other and used to be close once. Now she is married to a doctor, the cardiologist, and lives in London. He has a steady girlfriend, a ""23 on August 12"" Broadway Show Dancer. They seem to like each other and flirt innocently while drinking champagne, smoking (she is) and dancing. But gradually, apparently forgotten or hidden very deep inside feelings come back to life so intensely that they might (or not) change a man's and a woman's lives again.

This is my kind of film, with only two main characters, with the subtle interaction between them, when we have to rely more on their body languages, their eyes, their facial expressions than to the words that they say to each other. ""Conversations with Other Women"" is a riveting, bittersweet, honest, and realistic movie about making choices, losses, and regrets. Two people used to be the one world which had split years ago leaving them not just on the different continents but on the different halves of the screen. The film brings to mind Before Sunrise of course but its atmosphere is more sober and melancholic. It is not about possibility of future together, it is all about past. Both actors are excellent. The split screen technique works perfectly for the whole duration of the film. It is a very well made and creative indie picture which I enjoyed watching.",1248825600,,1488,4.679389312977099

2672523,4,B000JJ5G4W,"""Conversations with other women"" was a really good movie. Although some may find the split screen annoying, I found it very interesting and insightful. The entirety of your movie is almost all in real time, and the addition of the split screen gives us an interesting look into the many layers of this relationship, as well as of their past. The movie is about a man and a woman at a wedding; they start talking and it is obvious there is something more between them. As the movie takes us through their interactions and glimpses of the past, we get to know these two rather complicated individuals.

Aaron Eckhart and Helena Bonham Carter are truly fantastic in their portrayal of these two interesting, yet very normal individuals. In fact, they may very well just be your run-of-the-mill people at a wedding. They have made these characters very interesting and to top it all off is the witty and very entertaining dialogue. This movie is completely character driven and completely worth watching.",1212105600,,1000,4.847953216374269
2672524,4,B000JJ5G4W,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  It has a compelling story and believable characters.

The only problem I had with it is technical in nature. I had originally rented the movie twice through Netflix but had playback problems.  It would get to a specific point in the movie and would become choppy thereafter.  I decided to go ahead and purchase the movie assuming I'd gotten the same DVD twice and that there were scratches that were causing the problem.  I had the same exact problem with the pristine DVD.

At this point I was convinced it was a manufacturing defect so I contacted the distribution company.  They apparently already knew of the problem and sent me a new copy of the movie at no charge to me.  It plays perfectly.

This is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.  As long as this movie has been out it stinks that they still have the bad copies in circulation.",1208908800,,880,4.477987421383648

2672526,3,B000JJ5G4W,"This movie starts as a sharp and engaging study of two people flirting and edging around some unspecified mutual history, but seems to go completely limp when, ahem, the deed is done. Perhaps the characters just wear out their welcome: Only Woody Allen can really make you care to spend two hours with self-obsessed and neurotic New Yorkers, and even he can't do it all of the time. The more I found out about these two the less interesting they seemed, and I found myself checking the time. The split-screen works well as the characters' identities unspool, but again loses its punch as the hours roll by.

2672527,1,B000JJ5G4W,"UPDATE:  I have now watched part of this movie in the full frame version.  My fears were confirmed.  It doesn't work the way it was intended.  The alternate versus simultaneous presentations of the two points of references negates the effect intended and makes it much less of a success.  By all means, get the widescreen version.

I admit I have not seen this version of the movie, but stay with me, please, plenty of reviews exist for the widescreen version.  The cover says that they released this version in full screen.  Since the dual frame/screen technique used in this film would be unwatchable in that format it appears that they separated the two frames and then stitched them together, showing one frame at a time and then jumping back and forth.  While that worked well in ""Sliding Doors"", the premise of that movie was that you were seeing two alternate versions of the same events, depending on which way a certain key moment went early in the picture.  Here, the two screens are showing the same event from two different perspectives, mostly simultaneously (except for the occasional, ""present day/flashback"" moment), and so presenting it in this version destroys a major non-verbal part of the story.

The only reasons I can fathom for buying this version would be an obsessive distaste for widescreen (which some people have), or it is going to be watched on a screen so small that both frames would be so tiny they couldn't be easily viewed.",1199491200,12,1459,4.796
2672528,5,B000JJ5G4W,"There are so few love stories like the one you encounter in this film.  For audience that saw and enjoyed ""Before Sunrise"" and ""Before Sundown"" - the message is that you must not miss this film since it belongs in the same class. The uniqueness of this film is that it is completely shot from the each person's point of view and perception of the other. These two lovers have eyes only for each other.  It is as if the rest of the world exists only because of them.  Without each other's company, their world is empty, lonely and unhappy place - almost like a vacuum.  Based completely on the dialog between two main characters, this film will require your undivided attention.  This is not every day talk between two people who profoundly love each other.  It is also a battle of the wits.
It is wonderful to see Helena Bonham Carter looking so beautiful and spontaneous.  It is a film about happy times of the first love and the compromises both of these two lovers have made in the last decade of their lives; once they are divorced and living on two separate continents.  Film will get you thinking about choices we make in life and the price that come with it.  I absolutely love this film and recommend it to everyone!
Also the choice of (French) music is great for this feature film. It adds European feel to it, as weel as extra dose of sensuality.",1199404800,5,1356,4.435483870967742
2672529,5,B000JJ5G4W,"I watched this movie two times - back to back.  I was intrigued by it the first time but I loved it the second time.  What I didn't realize the first time, and what many reviewers seem to fail to realize, is that these two ""strangers"" were once married...they are each others ex-wife and ex-husband.  Watch it again.  Listen to the dialogue when they describe their exes.  When he's sharing his version of the past she asks quietly ""how long were we married then?"" and he answers ""about 6 months.""

This is one of the most amazing stories of lost love/lust rekindled that I have ever seen.  Anyone whose ever been involved in a great love and then ended up marrying someone who is perfect in every way will love this film.  Anyone who's ever encountered that first love years later will appreciate every every unspoken and quietly spoken nuance this film has to offer.

My only question is - are the children really her's?  She says they are not and yet they call her mommy on the answering machine.  She doesn't tell him about them as if mentioning them would be too painful.  He finds out about them first on the machine but doesn't mention them to her and then again when he's looking at pictures in her wallet.  If the one is going to be 12...could it be his?  At one point in the film he says that when she left she was pregnant...

If you didn't appreciate this movie the first time around, try watching it again.  It's not just a movie about a chance encounter and a one night stand.  When he says toward the end that he feels even lonelier now than he did before and that this makes everything seem so final, we realize that he's been dreaming about this reunion for 10 years.  She has to get back to London.  Is it for her husband or for her kids?  Would she leave him if it wasn't for the kids?

2672530,5,B000JJ5G4W,"Because I do free lance work as a film editor,""Conversations with other Women"" is an especially interesting film for me to review. From the technical side, I can so appreciate the amount of time and thought that went in to creating a film such as this. It is truly unconventional in its format in that the story of a man and a woman who meet at a wedding is told in dual or ""split"" screen.(""Conversations"" was shot with two hidef cameras and finished on a Mac Computer using Final Cut Pro. That may not mean a lot to some, but trust me, this product is amazing for the technology used.)This may be unnerving to some, but to me it only enhanced and made more intense the conversations that transpire on one evening between Actors Helena Bonham-Carter and Aaron Eckhardt.

Apart from the unusual format of this film,the script I find to be one of the most intimate and revealing about two people and their word exchange. This is not a film of action,but a film of words and double entendre. The relationship of these two people slowly unfolds in real time,past time and in ""thought"" time,meaning that what these characters are REALLY thinking at the moment is revealed DESPITE what they are really saying. This is the wonder of the split screen technology. Helena Bonham-Carter is superior in acting and communicating in this film. Eckhardt is a cut below,but his character is not as ""deep"" so I can forgive an actor who is below par of a superstar,in my opinion.

This film, to me, is genius, and can be enjoyed and clinically examined  at different levels each time I watch it. Many may not enjoy or understand this film. I loved it.",1195516800,3,1633,4.585616438356165
2672531,4,B000JJ5G4W,"I knew nothing about this film, but grabbed it from the library shelf because of the two actors.  So it was a great pleasure to see the very smart story unfold.

(Forgive my crankiness, but I hate it when some readers feel it is the role of the reviewer to retell the whole story, including all of the surprises.  If you haven't seen the film yet, be careful of reading the reviews.  The ones with angry comments from me are the ones to avoid!)

The script is very smart.  I was drawn in from the first by the clever dialogue and the excellent actors.  Aaron Eckhart and Helena Bonham Carter are well matched for this romantic pas de deux.  At first the flirtation was funny and light hearted and then ""as the plot thickened"" the interaction became deeper and, at times, extremely poignant.  Eckhart, who is so great at playing the ""player"" is quite touching when he drops his smile and lets the pain show on his face.

Much has been said here about the split screen device.  At first I found it a little complicating but after a while it worked well for me.  We do see the past, often, in the present, and this was a way of showing how our memories color our present perceptions.

Personally I felt that, after all of the intensity in the story, that the ending was a little weak and for that I guess I subtract a star.",1193875200,2,1320,4.317073170731708

Plus, there are two great actors (Aaron Eckhart and Helena Bonham Carter) who finally get to share the screen together.  When the split screen started between Eckhart and Carter, it was a little challenging to keep up.  But, the script really perked my interest in following between two unnamed characters.  Slowly, the plot unravels in the conversation which is refreshingly new.  Often times, many films go straight into spelling everything out rather than let the audience piece it together in a drama like this.  You can really sense the chemistry between the two and the dialogue is smart and never drags.  Well, I don't want to ruin it so I will leave it at this.  Discover this rare gem from a slew of predictable romatic comedy/dramas.

For extras on this DVD, the interview with Eckhart and Carter together is a treat.  You can really sense that both actors really enjoyed working on  this film together.  Also, the difficult questions were asked and Carter answers them quite honestly with shear wit.  Eckhart gets stuck answering the questions afterwards and unfortunately cannot match Carter's wit.

It is short as the action takes place over only a few hours, but they are poignant and satisfying moments. The split-screen was not a distraction at all and I found that at times it seamlessly allowed me the chance to enjoy this movie on another level. To explain; if you think about it, we don't interact with others with tunnel vision, we take in the whole surrounding area. Having the unique cinematic opportunity to see both reactions simultaneously gave it a more intimate feeling, adding to the reality and the integrity of this well written movie. I would not buy it as it is not something I'd care to watch over and over - this is a slice of life, a few hours between two people.

'Conversation(s) with Other Women' is an intriguing title. It has little to do with the plot and suggests so much more to do with the changing roles of men and women. The plot is a common one: Young couple met, fall in love, part and meet by accident a decade to wonder what if...

In ""Conversations..."" the sexual roles are reversed. A painful film for men to watch and feel. Rather than a woman dumped and still bleeding, here it is the man. More painful for men as men have to suffer cuts in silence and rarely get over it other than by pulling up the emotional drawbridge. Women are liberated to talk with other women.

In 'Conversations...' it is not accidential meeting. The man is trapped. He had to attend. The predatory woman returns to see if her cornered pray is still wounded by her claws. She brilliantly fakes concern for the husband and children she has left at home.

It is unusual for a dialogue to hold an audience's attention. The fact that 'Conversations...' does, is testimony to the quality of the script, acting and editing.

2672545,4,B000JJ5G4W,"Hans Canosa makes a strong debut with Gabrielle Zevin's intelligent screenplay (read two character dialogue) CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHER WOMEN and while some viewers may be distressed about his choice of use of the split screen presentation, Canosa's decision to be the editor of the film makes a strong argument for his artistic decision.  We are able to not only see ell sides of the characters physically, but we are also allowed to step into the 'private space' created by each of the characters, a space that grows in meaning as the film proceeds.  For this viewer it enhances the story.

It would be difficult to imagine two finer actors than Helen Bonham Carter and Aaron Eckhart to pull off this story.  Bonham Carter has flown in form London as a last minute replacement bridesmaid for an old friend and is bored by the wedding until she encounters Aaron Eckhart whom we soon learn is the bride's brother.  But coincidences don't stop there: soon the couple decide to have a night together and as they begin to share their current uncomfortable lives they recall that they were young lovers (well played by Erik Eidem and Nora Zehetner in flashbacks) and more than likely were married as first marriages.....but to say more would ruin the repartee that these two brilliant actors enjoy playing against each other.

Canosa manages to create a solid interplay between his actors and then capitalizes on the gifts of each by placing them in simultaneous and revealing views that more that provides his rationale for using the split screens as his technique.  Bonham Carter is more beautiful than ever and proves she is one of our finest actresses on film, seen far too seldom these days.  CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHER WOMEN is a sly look at relationships that slowly creeps up on you as you learn the secrets of each character.  It is a fine piece of filmmaking!

This movie is slow to unfold and a bit boring overall! Both characters in this film begin talking during a wedding reception.... At first you think they don't know each other and are getting to know each other for the very first time...... It becomes apparent later on in this film that they were romantically involved years before hand, but have gone on to live separate lives..... The wedding is the first they have seen each other in years.

Helena Bonham Carter's character, we find out, currently lives in London and is married to a cardiologist, while Aaron Eckhart's character is dating a much younger woman who is a dancer. I found it annoying that they keep referring to each other and their former lives together in the third person.

Anyway, the two end up having a one night stand once the wedding reception is over and then Helena Bonham Carter's character returns home to London. It is apparent that Aaron Eckhart's character is still in love with Helena Bonham Carter's character and he wants her back.
