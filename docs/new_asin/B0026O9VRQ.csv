Ernie  Fosselius  probably  knew  that  taking  on  ""Apocalypse  Now""  was  an  easy  target... Coppola  had  LOTS  of  troubles  and  way  too many  misfortunes.  He  kicked  at  the  ""system"",  and  for  awhile,  seemed  to  be  paying  the  price  for  it.  Fosselius  thought  this  one  out... Billy  Gray  does  his  best  Martin  Sheen  and  really  carries  it  off.  There  are  two  schools  in  comedy... play  an  absurd  situation  straight,  or  play  a  serious  situation  with  unruly  humor  In  this  case  Fosselius  plays  it  straight,  even  when  everything  around  him  says  he  has  gone  too  far.
It  is  simply  a  great  romp!  I  would  have  given  it  a  fifth  star,  but  they  included  ""Warriors  of  the  Wasteland"",  which  was  simply  MST 3000  material... I  would  have  preferred  to  see  ""Hardware  Wars""  instead.
Do  it  with  class... long  live  ""Porklips  Now""!!!",1402790400,2,1124,4.622093023255814

8353256,5,B0026O9VRQ,"It's a parody of Apocalypse Now about going uptown to meet a butcher.  I wish it was longer, but it was funny.  I had watched Redux recently, so the original movie was still fresh in my head.

The major downside is the price.  For how short it is, the price is just too high.",1337299200,4,275,4.037037037037037
8353257,5,B0026O9VRQ,"If you love satires, or are a fan of the movie ""Apocalypse Now"" and just need a 'lighter moment', this movie is for you. I saw it first many, many years ago, and we loved it then as we love it now - it's SO DAMN CLEVER! If you are too serious about your love of ""Apocalypse Now"", don't get this - it's a take-off, and it is silly, and it's a wonderful laugh. It's kinda pricey at 19.95, but I've been waiting all these years, hanging onto my old VHS version, so I'm glad it finally came out in DVD. I haven't watched the DVD yet as I just received it, but it can't be any worse than my VHS home recorded tape. Recommended for fans of satire and SNL skits.",1319414400,3,655,3.9696969696969697
8353258,5,B0026O9VRQ,"Fatigued and PDSD'd from trying to get through 'Redux' in one go? Then what you need is 'Porklips Now'. A piece of sheer brilliance by Ernie Fosselius, who decided to make one of the best spoofs you'll ever likely to see. The lead character, Dullard, is played wonderfully deadpan by William ""Billy"" Gray who finds himself on a mission to Chinatown to take care of 'business' with rogue butcher Fred ""Madman"" Mertz (Fosselius). A great deal of the hilarity of this short movie comes from the way it parodies scenes from 'Apocalypse Now' perfectly by substituting suburban San Francisco on a  near zero budget.  Acting is painfully spot on at times -  Fosselius as 'Mertz' or Tom Bullock's 'Shutterbug', making this film the perfect antidote to Coppola's original.
One word of advice, don't watch this before 'Redux' or you'll never keep a straight face.",1259280000,9,853,4.909722222222222
