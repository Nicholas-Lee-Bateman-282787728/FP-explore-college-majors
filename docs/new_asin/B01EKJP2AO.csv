8759032,4,B01EKJP2AO,"This is a brief documentary that emphasizes the numerous primary source newspaper sources on racial violence with particular emphasis on African American victims who were tortured and burned to death. From the beginning to the end, the author traces American-style burnings at the stake beginning with a handful of blacks in New England. The bulk of the material covered in the film, however, runs from the 1880s to the 1920s, covering a wave of southern-style mob killings. The film could have benefited from inclusion of the viewpoints of a historian or two to explain the deeper meaning of this kind of violence in American history and culture and why it occurred when it did. For that, viewers should probably read Wood's Lynching & Spectacle: Witnessing Racial Violence in America, 1890-1940 (UNC Press, 2009).",1495497600,,815,5.135338345864661
