6935843,5,B00RVZJ3U0,"A feel-good movie reminiscent of a fairy-tale.  If this were a book, it would sell in paperback, rather than hard-back, but it was fun to watch and I can imagine watching it a second time perhaps six months down the road.

6935849,3,B00RVZJ3U0,"Had this movie in my queue for a bit. Wanted a mindless movie to watch just in case. Today was that day. I woke up with a huge headache so I stayed in bed. Once I felt better, needed something to do. Here I go to watch a movie out of my queue. Of course, I didn't expect an amazing movie as I knew it would be one to pass the time since Lauren Holly was starring in it. I was right! The movie starts off with a terrible southern accent, and the narrating voice was so deep that I couldn't figure out if it was Lauren Holly miserably attempting a southern accent or a gentleman miserably attempting a southern accent. Turns out, it was Lauren Holly, or at least it was supposed to be her character in the movie. She plays a successful author, on her book tour. One of her stops is in a quaint southern town, because there is an independent book store owned by a lady the main character seems to esteem. Lauren Holly's character is also from the south, so she has the typical southern accent, southern presentation, southern charm and politeness and the southern mother always trying to marry off their daughters, so they can show their worth, regardless if their daughters are successful and independent. The acting was a little over the top, as things tend to be ""thought of like that being from the south"" but its charming. There are some sappy flirting and romance, suspense and drama. At the end, everything gets wrapped up in a nice little bow for the viewer as its very predictable. All in all, its a nice movie for a Sunday afternoon with a bottle of wine.",1493769600,3,1562,4.371134020618556

6935887,2,B00RVZJ3U0,Painfully goofy.  This is another example of southerners made to look like complete idiots.  I wonder how much of the cast were really from the South.  They were all straining to keep up their stereotyped accents and stereotyped view of Southerners as simpletons.  Most actors can't put on an accent and come across naturally.  The directing was over-the-top; the writing sparse with repetitive jokes.,1483056000,4,401,5.203125

But this movie sure is terrific:  wonderfully scripted, well acted not only by the leads but by the multitude of supporting players, beautifully photographed and produced.  Exceptionally rare that I award a five star rating to a film that I had never heard of before but this one earned all five stars.",1473120000,6,383,4.861538461538461

8696006,5,B00RVZJ3U0,"'twas a very sweet movie.  I loved it.

I did not care for a couple of the characters.  The assistant /publicist was rude to the point of being 'snarky', but thankfully the heroine more than made up for her.  It would seem like she'd have someone who had better manners, given her line of work.  Any other differences or challenges in the characters overall could be very forgiven.",1514332800,,381,4.544117647058823

8696008,2,B00RVZJ3U0,"I can't say that I hate it cuz that hate's just too harsh of a word. So I am going with two stars which says that I simply did NOT LIKE it. The southern accents came on thick in the beginning & then waned as the movie went on. It was painful to watch to be quite honest. The comedy was forced: cheesy at best, falling flat at worst. Most of the acting was 2nd rate save the big names that starred in it (the mayor, Abby, the Valerie Harper character, & some of the townsfolk, even ""Walter""). The mayor's kids did a mediocre job of acting.

A little over halfway through, all of a sudden the tone of the movie changed. It went from being cheesy goofiness to dead serious. I stuck through it till the end so I could write my honest review of it. IMO, if **I** were the director/screenwriter of this movie I would have gone with a less corny approach, especially in the beginning. Although it ended well with a ""happily ever after"" ending...it had a very choppy sort of script & execution. When I saw that both Valerie Harper & Lauren Holly were the Executive Producers of the movie, I had high hopes for it. It left me rather disappointed. Even the end credits ran on rather long & were drawn out, with great pauses between the credit slides.",1508198400,2,1240,4.276595744680851

8696011,3,B00RVZJ3U0,"Cute story.  Atrocious attempts at speaking in Southern accents.  The narrator sounded like an African American ... so seeing that the voice was coming from a white girl was odd.  These movie makers need to either hire real Southerners to play Southern characters, as those from elsewhere have no ear for it.  We Southerners can identify which southern state a person is from, their race and likely their age, based on their way of speaking.  Occasionally, we might be confused about gender, as in the case of the first narration.

There was  hint of Mississippi in those speakers accents, but there were enough flaws to render it annoying.

If you can get past that, its a cute romcom.",1499731200,3,686,4.754237288135593

8696013,4,B00RVZJ3U0,"A very sweet story.  Sometimes saccharine sweet.  Although integral to the story, the towns people drove me nuts.  The film could easily have been titled something else - No Boundaries wouldn't have been a bad idea ;-).  And there are many others.  Won't spoil it for you, but if you enjoy a good romantic and sweet ""Lifetime"" type movies, this one will make you happy.  Happy watching!  ~R",1499212800,3,390,4.647058823529412
