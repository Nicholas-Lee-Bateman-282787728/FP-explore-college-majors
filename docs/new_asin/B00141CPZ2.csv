8253985,5,B00141CPZ2,"This is a thought-provoking story, complete with suspense, action, drama and the ability to find love again.  The hero, at the beginning of the story, is grieving for his dead wife and child..  While he is an Ottoman miniature painter, we see him painting his dead child in European fashion, which is frowned upon by the Ottomans.  Terrified when soldiers come to take him to the Wazir, he is instead ordered to go to Cappadochia, where a usurper to the Sultanate has been captured, and will be beheaded as soon as our hero can get him painted in European fashion.  They need this as proof, back in Istanbul, that he is dead and as a warning to any of his followers.  Unwilling to go, but with his apprentice held as hostage, he leaves with a band of soldiers.  Attacked along the way, they suffer some casualties, and find a girl that they finally let accompany them.  When they get to the Caravanserai  (a stopping place for travelers along the Silk Road), he determines that the man he is supposed to paint can't possibly by the right guy!  You'll  have to watch to see how event unfold - it's terrific!",1380931200,,1106,4.5125628140703515
8253986,4,B00141CPZ2,"CENNETI BEKLERKEN (Waiting for Heaven) involves the tale of an Ottoman miniaturist, a rebel ruler, an Ottoman vizier, and a reworking of Velazquez's famous painting ""The Maids of Honor."" Director Dervis Zaim uses all this material to comment on the relationship of past to present; although ostensibly an historical drama (with lavishly mounted sets and costumes), the film shows how the past can be reworked according to different social, political, and ideological forces.  Everyone - from miniaturists, to rulers, to the lowest echelons of society - is in a sense an 'author' of their own histories. The film is wonderful to look at, and includes some surprising sequences; at one point Zaim uses animation to comment on the relativity of history and history-making, as well as emphasizing the continuing significance of Ottoman traditions to the contemporary Turkish Republic.  A complex piece that deserves more than one viewing.",1358899200,,934,5.346938775510204
