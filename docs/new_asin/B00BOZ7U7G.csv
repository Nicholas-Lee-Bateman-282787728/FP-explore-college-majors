I appreciate the educational opportunity for them to learn their shapes and also be exposed to different environments such as a farm, an open-air market and an underwater adventure.  We now like to practice what we have learned in the video by looking for shapes in our every day activities.  My children have watched this video since age one and are now in school.  We still pull it out and they enjoy watching it in Spanish, which is great for language development!  I recommend this video for any family looking for a great opportunity to help their children lean.  This video will definitely stay on the top of my list of birthday gifts!",1406505600,,712,4.611111111111111

I have given this video as a gift to other families with young children and they have expressed to me ... how their children love the nature scenes and the way the shapes are brought into the various scenes in this video.  Their children easily picked up the natural sense of identifying the shapes around them after watching this video and they enjoyed seeing the many animals that are included in ""Great from Go, Shapes all Around.""",1366156800,,555,4.831578947368421
