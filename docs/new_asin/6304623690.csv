7874918,2,6304623690,"Racetrack farce WIN, PLACE OR STEAL gets two stars instead of one only because of the many fine actors who were unfortunately involved in a nag of a project that got out of the gate last and not only didn't run ""in the money"" but entirely failed to finish the race.

This forced attempt at slapstick comedy is a slow-moving story of three men who scheme to remove a betting machine from a racetrack so they can print their own winning tickets.

One final note: The video's cover art depicts McLean Stevenson (of TV's M*A*S*H) as the picture's star- totally misleading, as Stevenson is 7th billed and portrays a minor character.

It's no big surprise that this movie is NOT available on DVD.
RECOMMENDED: Pierce Brosnan stars in THE HEIST (1989)-- a satisfying racetrack crime caper that has more twists and turns than Churchill Downs!

Of course when there was so much cocaine being snorted while filming and editing, it is amazing it even got completed. I told Ray, Billy, and Frank they would bungle the caper and that I didn't want anything to do with it. I was right and after it was all said and done they had to agree that they were bunglers. They were my friends, my buddies, well at least Ray and Frank, I don't think Billy really knows what a friendship means, that doesn't mean I didn't like Billy, just would never till this day trust him, that's all. Most likely no one will ever read this I just didn't want my friends story to not have at least one review, I bought the video on Amazon but so far have not watched it, maybe I should just for the memories. Frank and Ray passed away years ago, I still miss them, right or wrong they were friends that you could relie on, well on second thought, Ray wasn't really always that reliable, and both Frank and Ray would sue at the drop of a hat. O. K. let me just say they were my friends and leave it at that.....Bill Perron",1198281600,,1107,4.177570093457944
