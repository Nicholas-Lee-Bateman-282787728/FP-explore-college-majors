It's basically the same plot as The Running Man, but in a cruel irony, The New Gladiators was made years earlier! Plenty of futuristic sets, clothes, and dirtbike action to please even the most jaded post-nuke fan! ( this text refers to the vhs version).",995155200,,385,4.938461538461539
1046803,3,6305554439,"Among the many, many other Italian post-apocalyptic films made between 1982-1984, this one lies about dead in the center.  Not nearly as dreary as EXTERMINATORS OF THE YEAR 3000 and RUSH, but not quite as classy as ESCAPE  FROM THE BRONX, RAIDERS OF ATLANTIS, or even ENDGAME.
Fulci really is a  giallo/horror director at heart, and his touches for the most part fail  miserably with this film.  The story pre-dates the Running Man, but isn't  too terribly interesting.  For the most part, the film is saved by its  great cast (Jared Martin, Al Cliver, Donald O'Brien, Claudio Cassinelli,  Fred Williamson, Al Yamanouchi, and Howard Ross) and  decent music by Riz  Ortelani (CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST).  The special effects, however, are  mind-numbingly wretched, and the final chariot chase scene has to be among  the cheesiest ever filmed.
Fans of Fulci's gore flicks will be  disappointed, but those who have seen most of Italy's other post-apoc  flicks should realize that they get a lot worse!",951264000,3,991,5.062111801242236

7891382,2,6305554439,"While the film is rather good for a post-Apocalypse film directed by goremeister Lucio Fulci, the DVD presentation by Troma Entertainmnet is a step below a VHS release. Unfortunately, it is the only way to get it in the U.S. right now (it will soon be released on Blu-Ray, not from Troma, so you may want to wait for that release) and it is truly awful. Not the film, the DVD. The film predates THE RUNNING MAN by several years and offers what we expect from Fulci; gory deaths, exploding bodies and decapitated body parts. Wait for the Blu-Ray and then watch it. You are guaranteed to be thoroughly entertained. Like another Italian Post-nuke flick called ENDGAME, it is about a televised reality show that pits criminals against gladiators (which makes me wonder where Stephen King, a.k.a. ""Richard Bachman"" got his idea for THE RUNNING GAME). It's pretty good and violent, so give yourself some time and wait for the Blu. You'll be glad you did.",1423180800,6,948,4.716867469879518

7891384,4,6305554439,"Totally unconvincing as an actual view at the future, New Gladiators (aka: ""Rome 2072: The New Gladiators"" or ""Fighting Centurions"") is none the less an extremely entertaining Sci-Fi action programmer from Lucio Fulci. At times gory, action packed (full of exploding-for-no-reason vehicles), cheese-tastic dialogue (""Go to Hell!"", ""I would - if I thought it would increase my ratings!"") and delicious scenary reused from other Italian sci-fi films, giving the film the feel of an episode of Doctor Who circa 1983 as directed by slow-minded aliens.

Jared Martin, of the 1980s War of the Worlds series and Fulci's own AENIGMA, is our hero - the star Killbike champion. It's hard to tell if he is the star of the TV show Killbike BEFORE he's framed for murdering the Clockwork Orange-esque gang who murdered his wife, or if that is a flashback (as indicated by the commentary from Fulci-fan Troma staff) and that's how he became a Killbike star. I think it's the former, though. He finds himself in a prison cell (a one room riff on Stuart Gordon's FORTRESS which had yet to be made) with Fred ""The Hammer"" Williamson (From Dusk Till Dawn, Black Caesar, New Barbarians etc), Hal Yamagouchi (from ""Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"") and Al Cliver (dubbed again by the guy who did Zombie for him), among others. They are trained in hilarious strobe-lit scene with mentally-projected holograms to become more effective killers (this has very little to do with the game show they ultimately compete in), there's a love story, in-fighting, a sadistic guard...You get the picture.

No, words cannot describe the joys of the picture - small model sets, actually entertaining sci-fi ideas (almost universally executed beneath their value) and Riz Ortolani (orchestral composer and film composer for ""Cannibal Holocaust"" and Fulci's ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" and ""Perversion Story/One On Top of the Other"") contributes a scruzzy New Wave rock score which is a total, rip-roaring triumphant cheesefest. Sure, there's only three pieces of music and they loop constantly, but by the end you'll be so happy it won't matter!

The DVD is a fairly typical early 21st century Troma disc - fullscreen video master, stereo, minimal extras. A commentary from the ""FBI"" (Fulci Benevolant Institution) is just Trent ""Killjoy, Dead Girl and Terror Firmer"" Haaga and Troma's then-DVD producer Ronni Raygun riffing on the movie. It's unclear whether only some of the affection for the film is sarcastic, or all of it, but it's entertaining enough. There's a short interview with the beautiful Antonella Fulci (not as good as on the ""Zombie"" blu-ray or Arrow ""Gates of Hell"" Daughter of Darkness interviews) apparently filmed by herself or a friend (note the Divine ""Love Reaction"" vinyl prominantly displayed...did she think John Waters owned Troma?), a Dario Argento interview (not a lot involved here, but mention is made of Fulci and how he didn't play a part influencing Dario, at all), a short Robert Englund interview about...Dario Argento, and the usual introduction and trailer. There's also some Troma extras with nothing to do with the film.

Considering it's a full screen video master, and the film is clearly missing some information (yes I would prefer a 1.85:1 transfer but fortunately New Gladiators was not a cinemascope production, so we're not missing too much), the transfer is pretty good. Once you get used to the idea that in this dystopian future, a particular shade of dark green has replaced the colour black, you'll notice it upscales just fine.

Overall, it's the best version of the movie out there I'm aware of (apparently the US Media release cuts out some of the violence) and it's pretty cheap, so pick it up.",1363046400,3,3714,5.052202283849918

this is my fave non horror fulci i like it better then his westerns,comedies and conquest{although imo he has never made a bad movie}

there is some great gore cool action scenes and some nice looking itallian chicks

7891388,2,6305554439,"No figure in the horror film genre is as divisive as Lucio Fulci. After watching one or two of his films, viewers tend to move into one of two camps. One side hails Fulci as a master of terror, a man who upped the gore quotient in his films while creating wonderfully atmospheric pictures. For these people, Fulci is right up there with the likes of Dario Argento as one of the best filmmakers ever to emerge from Italy. The other camp sneers at these claims, pointing to the plodding pace of his films, the use of extreme gore to camouflage plot holes, and the director's inability to draw good performances out of his cast as evidence of mediocrity. Initially, I enjoyed Fulci's films, specifically ""Zombie,"" ""City of the Living Dead,"" and ""The New York Ripper"" because I did not know any better. When I came on the scene, you went to Fulci to feed your craving for gore. What a difference a few years exploring the genre makes! While I will not go so far as to remove Lucio from my play list altogether, I have seen enough of his films to realize he is not a cinematic genius. He is at best a competent director, at worst an abysmal one, and there are plenty of examples of bad filmmaking in this director's filmography. Included in his canon of mediocre movies is one of his forays into science fiction, the 1983 movie ""The New Gladiators.""
Forget the Fulci of horror with this movie. Instead, cast your mind back to the days when Italian directors went on a sci-fi bender, pumping out product to ride the success of Carpenter's ""Escape From New York"" and the Mel Gibson vehicle ""The Road Warrior."" Fulci dove on the bandwagon with this ""shocker"" about a futuristic society that uses televised gladiatorial combat shows to keep the masses in line. I know what you're thinking: Schwarzenegger's ""The Running Man"" and reality television, right? Maybe, except most of this film's focus has little to do with either of these two concepts. Jared Martin plays Drake, the champion racer in the ""Thrillkill"" program who just happens to murder some goons roughing up his wife. He's arrested, convicted, and sentenced to television's latest program, a new gladiatorial combat program advertised as the successor to the Coliseum games of ancient Rome. Martin ends up in a jail/training program with Abdul (Fred Williamson), Akira (Al Yamanouchi), Kirk (Al Cliver), and a few other miscreants. Also in the picture is Cortez (Claudio Cassinelli), a ruthless television executive, and Raven (Howard Ross), the sadistic guard in charge of training the ""contestants"" with cheesy ray gun effects and laughable punishments.
The training programs look positively awful. In one series of scenes, Fulci has his actors fighting while strobe lights flash. Why? Who knows, but it looks ridiculous. The extreme training eventually unites all of the personalities, with Martin's character emerging as the unofficial leader of the group. By the time Drake swallows a device that allows him to melt metal, I knew I was watching an absolute clunker of a film. The contest does take place, but it's the tamest gladiatorial combat scenario I have yet witnessed in a sci-fi film. All you see are a bunch of guys riding around on bikes hacking away at one another. A bit of the old trademark Fulci gore livens things up briefly, but not enough to salvage the film. The scenes, shot in extreme close up to hide glaring flaws in the set pieces, are interesting only when you compare them to other movies. And wait until you see the conclusion! What a groaner. I won't spoil the fine points for you, but at one moment a satellite blows up in space, which we see on a computer monitor. Fine, but should we see smoke rising off a celestial object? I think not, Mr. Fulci! There's simply no excuse for this sort of sloppy special effects work, even in low budget Italian boilerplate. What did he use as a stand in for that satellite, a Christmas ornament?
Surprisingly, I liked several things about the movie. That scene where we see the convicts suspended over an electrified floor was hilarious. Too, the set pieces for the city, which looked like cardboard cut outs adorned with holiday lighting, worked in an odd way. The best part of the film was a glance at a rival network's show about people who sign on to face their fears through some sort of computer simulation. We see a lady reclining on a bed as a giant pendulum swings closer and closer to her throat. Nifty! They ought to try that out on one of the reality shows on our television networks. Overall, ""The New Gladiators"" is too ridiculous to take as a serious entry in the science fiction genre. The ideas behind the shoddy pacing, acting, and effects work, however, does seem highly prescient considering what came after. In that regard, Fulci's film is worth watching if you don't mind laughing too hard at the whole thing. By the way, Riz Ortolani scored the movie.
Troma released the DVD version of the film and made a mess of it in the process. Supposedly ""restored"" for our viewing pleasure, the picture is a fullscreen transfer of what looks like a murky VHS tape. Extras include an interview with Dario Argento (?), several schlock Troma trailers, an intro from Lloyd Kaufman, and an interview with Fulci's daughter (the director passed away in the 1990s from diabetes). Fans of the Italian science fiction era-roughly the early 1980s-should probably check this one out. Rent it first, though.",1086652800,,5432,4.761399787910922
7891389,2,6305554439,"Coming from the 'Italian Master of Gore' I was definately expecting something that this movie is not.  It is not comparable to Fulci's masterpieces.  While there were a small handfull of scenes where the Master makes himself known, they were too few and far between to keep the movie alive.
This movie is very similar to the dozens of other low-budget 'dark future' movies of the time, and if you've seen one you've seen them all.  The story is slow and often difficult to follow and the ending makes zero sense.
However I do give this movie points for originality.  This movie is a lower budget version of 'The Running Man', except this movie was first.  I also enjoyed the god-awful special effects; they were another saving grace of the film (read: the fly by city miniature scenes).  Not to mention the soundtrack that consists of one song repeated over and over (not a bad song though).
Even though the movie is not too enjoyable, I would have given in three stars because of the extras, unfortunately the awful quality of the movie took away from its rating.  But in true Troma fashion there are a decent array of extras included with this flic.
Bottom line don't expect 'Zombie', but rather a lower budget 'Logan's Run' or 'The Running Man'.  If these kind of movies are your thing then you can probably get your money's worth from this film.",1042416000,,1349,4.615062761506276
