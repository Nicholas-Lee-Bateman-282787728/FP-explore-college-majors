4466135,5,B004TXFFI6,"This Communist propaganada movie appears to follow the facts as I understand them from reading both German and American accounts, with the exception of Stalin's overblown role in the planning.  As one who knows that few creatures are lower than a commie, and as one who wishes the Germans had won at Stalingrad, I was surprised at the level-headed restraint.  The footage of tanks and other equipment such as the German machine guns is worth the price even without a story line.",1329868800,4,478,4.817073170731708
4466136,3,B004TXFFI6,"A reasonably good job of telling the story of the epic, war-changing five month battle that cost over a million lives and spelt the beginning of the end for the Thousand Year Reich.  Despite the picture's Russian origins, it is surprisingly bereft of anti-German sentiment, despite one's expectations to the contrary.  The action sequences, which were rather epic in scope, portraying major engagements during the siege, somehow left me underwhelmed, although other reviewers have found them to be quite good.  There was an emotional flatness to the movie, when compared to the 2013 ""Stalingrad"", also Russian-made--a movie which is truly moving and exceptionally good.  Stalingrad 2013 version can easily take its place at the top of World War 2 movies, and I  strongly recommend the more recent version.  Unfortunately, I watched the 1990 ""Stalingrad"" after seeing the 2013 version",1419724800,,883,5.316546762589928
4466137,4,B004TXFFI6,"There are already some excellent reviews here and I won't add to what they've already said. The real value of this film is to see the sort of propaganda a totalitarian dictatorship produces. The battle scenes are excellent. But there's so much Stalin.not surprising that so many of the former Soviets I meet are still very much in love with him. I enjoyed the way Churchill and Roosevelt were portrayed, and also I liked seeing all the American vehicles and airplanes in use by Soviet forces. But one bizarre aspect of the movie has me puzzled.when Stalin walks about his office his shoes squeak. Nobody else's shoes squeak. Is there meaning in this? It's very peculiar.",1416268800,,670,4.7844827586206895

4466139,4,B004TXFFI6,"Pure Soviet Propaganda and it's pretty good! The movie... well, that's not quiet the right word for it... It's sort of a quazi-docu-drama... covers events up to and after teh Battle of Stalingrad. Whats cool is the use of actual military equipment, and a lot of it, on both the German and Soviet sides. They got the early war Red Army uniforms right. The German ones are later war- a bunch of M43 caps, for example, but it doesn't take away from the scenes too much.
If you put aside the obvious pro-Stalin message and just roll your eyes at a Russian speaking Churchill and Roosevelt you will enjoy this as much as I did.",1412899200,2,622,4.417391304347826
4466140,3,B004TXFFI6,"I bought the DVD to check out the Soviet view of the battle, not long after WWII was over.  It is full of propaganda and Stalin looks brilliant as he figures out how to defeat the Germans and sadly sends his men to their doom.  As I thought it would be interesting from this perspective, I have no qualms with the movie.  The problem is the DVD itself.  The DVD freezes when I try to watch any of the bonus material.  Additionally, if I pause the movie part way through and try to restart it.... the DVD also freezes.  So this is not a riveting story, mostly an idea of how Stalin wanted the battle to be remembered by the Russians.  However, at least my copy, of the DVD has some issues.",1407369600,4,688,4.166666666666667
4466141,4,B004TXFFI6,"I popped for all 3 of the restored Soviet DVD's, Stalingrad, Orel, and Fall of Berlin. This was the best of the three. Stalin's god-like solo scenes give you a chance to get a drink of water or go to the bathroom, but the battle scenes really deliver. We only see CGI these days but having the actual planes fly over sent shivers down my spine. In one scene crossing the Volga, a boat full of men takes a direct hit and it was so realistic, well, the same thing happened in Enemy at the Gates and there was no comparison. I have several Stalingrad documentaries with actual footage and this is a great supplement. The battle scenes are mostly staged with more men and equipment than you usually see, and the director is matter of fact about the violence, he doesn't overdo it but I still felt lots of suspense. In the fight for Pavlov's house, as men are fighting up and down the staircase, occasionally a body falls from above past the camera, reminding you there's more going on than just what you see. In general, done quite well, I'm leaving this one out to watch again.",1407110400,4,1074,4.402010050251256
4466142,4,B004TXFFI6,"Stalin became up close and personal in this film.  His perspective, his interactions with his team members and others enlightened and fascinated.  The battle scenes were vivid, but this is really the actor who played Stalin's film.  See it!",1406073600,,240,5.102564102564102

4466144,5,B004TXFFI6,"While today Stalin is largely regarded as a butcher, this film paints a very different picture of him.  It is an epic film and very well made, especially since it was done while the Soviets were at war, if I recall.  Although Stalin and the Soviets are portrayed in such an impossibly good light as to be almost comical, the film does convey, and very well, the struggle faced by the citizens of the USSR and their relentless fight against the invading Facists, much to the degree, although not as powerfully, as Sergei Eisestein's ""Alexander Nevsky.  Overall, an excellent film, with a little historical revisionism thrown in for the heck of it...",1398124800,,648,4.767857142857143
4466145,3,B004TXFFI6,"In war, the head of the state is the supreme commander. Zhukov was Deputy Supreme Commander in WW II. Practically all the military strategies and tactics were Zhukov's contribution. In this movie, Stalin took all the credit; ridiculous. Another major problem is that Stalin was portrayed as a mild-mannered gentle person; in reality, he was hot-tempered, stubborn, secretive and skeptical.
The war scenes are acceptable, but not outstanding. In short, there is just too much Stalin and not enough Zhukov, who directed most of the battles, in this movie to put the whole affair in historical perspective.",1393632000,2,603,5.22680412371134
4466146,3,B004TXFFI6,"This film is historically accurate and quite interesting. Purchasers should be aware, however, that the film spends more time in Stalin's office in the Kremlin than it does on the Stalingrad battlefield ! This film was produced by the Soviets as propaganda to extol Stalin as an incomparable strategist and national leader. After the first hour, it gets very monotonous to swtich back to Stalin in the Kremlin every ten minutes or so.",1393027200,5,434,4.958904109589041
4466147,4,B004TXFFI6,"This film gives you a look into the cult of personality that seems to be a necessity in a totalitarian state. It is quite an excellany view into how the Wehrmacht and its equipment work since the German armaments are all real, captured by the Red Army. It also gives you an excellant view of the style of photography and acting that had been developed in the USSR. The dramatic lighting effects are done without the computer aided effects of today. It is a trip into the past as seen trough the eyes of the communist party of Stalin. There is little to no credit given to Zhukov which is quite interesting.",1389225600,,606,4.419642857142857
4466148,4,B004TXFFI6,"A fairly well made Soviet propaganda film about what the Russians called their Great Patriotic War. Although it has a Stalin slant as it makes him look like a military genius and underplays the role of all of his military generals and makes Hitler look totally bonkers, its usage of actual Nazi equipment as well as Soviet equipment was very well done. The filming itself leaves something to be desired as the camera man shooting some of the scenes had trembling hands. The film is done in black and white and is in documentary form, and there are good English subtitles so it was easy to follow along. It does make a point that the Soviets did the bulk of the fighting, and dying in WW2 on the allies side. of course not mentioning Stalin's purge of the officer corps prior to the German invasion. Remember as the film kept reiterating that ""Stalin is always with you"" even if he physically wasn't at the front with his troops..

The Soviet actors who portrayed Stalin, Hitler, Roosevelt had strong physical resemblances to the characters that they portrayed.",1388707200,,1060,4.698924731182796

4466150,3,B004TXFFI6,"First of all, the sound and picture quality of this restored Soviet movie are excellent. No complaints there. I mostly buy Russian language films (and I buy a lot) for the language (desperately trying to retain what proficiency I have in it), and this was a good film for that purpose. Five stars for the DVD itself.

Now to the movie.

Combat scenes: Not bad. Perhaps too many dead Germans and too few Russians (I think the ratio was actually quite the reverse of that shown in ""The Battle of Stalingrad"". The room-to-room fighting in ""Dom Pavlova"" is probably the cinematic high point of this film, and worth watching for this sequence alone. Overall, one does get an idea of the utter savagery the battle was in reality. I was rather disappointed that the omnipresent Soviet slogan ""Ni shagu nazad!""(Not one step back!) of that time never made an appearance in this movie.

Historical accuracy: Low - pure Stalinist distortion. In reality, both Hitler and Stalin (and Churchill, when you think of it) meddled incessantly in military matters, and every time they did so it was pure disaster at the front. Stalingrad was one instance where the supposed ""genius"" Stalin actually allowed his commanders to work independently. The result was a brilliant Soviet victory. Hitler, meanwhile, interfered at every level, and the result was catastrophe (for him and National Socialism, that is - it resulted in a great triumph for Humanity). This movie's portrayal of Stalin presiding over every move the Red Army made during this period is pure fantasy. Marshal Georgij Zhukov, the true architect of Soviet victory, gets one brief, non-contextual mention here.

Human interest: Virtually non-existent. ""The Battle of Stalingrad"" desperately needed some sort of character hook to hang the narrative from, but it is sadly lacking. Maybe the producers were trying to make Stalin that hook? If so, they failed miserably.

Interesting trivia: The scene with the nocturnal visit of the ""Old Friend"" is mentioned in Solzhenitsyn's novel ""The First Circle"". In that book, Stalin is portrayed as wishing he actually had such a trusted friend to whom he could speak frankly, whilst bemoaning the fact that he had purged (and basically murdered) anyone who could have fulfilled that role.",1380844800,30,2270,5.0588235294117645
4466151,5,B004TXFFI6,"Another very good Russian account of this brutal battle. I can only imagine what it must have really been like during this battle. Good acting, good drama.",1363737600,6,155,4.777777777777778
4466152,4,B004TXFFI6,"This restoration is excellent, with clear and sharp visual and sound. Only because of frequent stiffled and cardboard acting by most of the Soviet principals, did I not give this 5 stars. I don't think I have ever seen a production, better ""re-enactment,"" of greater magnitude of personnel, materiel, spent ordnance and destruction than in this ""movie."" The Soviets spared no cost to chronicle and portray the extensive and lengthy conflict that was the Battle of Stalingrad. The terrain is expansive or urban as the case requires, with real snow, ice, cold and smoke-filled skies. Produced only a few years after the end of WW II, the re-enactment uses a plethora of authentic equipment. All phases of this great conflict are covered, and famous conflicts within the city such as Pavlov's House, the Rail Station, the Red October Steel Factory, the Dzerzhinsky tractor factory and the Barrikady gun factory, are all portrayed. The portrayal of Stalin is certainly artificially contrived for propaganda purposes, but this movie is a valuable document on it's subject, and serves as fine couterpoint to the 1993 German-made intimate treament of director Joseph Vilsmaier.",1359763200,5,1170,5.2287234042553195
4466153,4,B004TXFFI6,"Some movies are not that great or important at the time of their making. And sometimes the reason a movie is great or important changes with time. That is the case with this rather interesting film, which was made not too long after the end of World War 2. I'm sure at the time it was a huge event when this film was released in the Soviet Union - the memories of this cataclysm still raw in everyone's mind. It was an important film then because of its relatively fresh retelling of the most epic of battles and its extensive recreations of the battle scenes - quite realistic given the day and technology, but it also served as a rebuttal to the persistent charge that Stalin was an ineffective and incompetent military leader who really had little to do with the success of the Soviet's victory over the Nazis. So, at the time it was two movies, one that told the story of the Battle of Stalingrad quite factually, and a second movie intertwined with the first that served to further build and augment the cult of personality that Stalin wanted to create and use to control the narrative of the post war story telling, which to that point was often unflattering to Stalin - to say the least. He also clearly used this film to control and shape the narrative - vis-a-vis - the perception of the allies (U.K. and U.S.A.) amongst the citizens of the Soviet Union as the Cold War began. So, today, anyone who is familiar with the history of the 20th Century, the Cold War, the Soviet Union, Stalin, and of course World War 2 (The Great Patriotic War), cannot help but be fascinated by this incredible example of state propaganda and how it was crafted and used to control the narrative. It is a fascinating historical artifact and its value for providing insight and understanding of that time and world is incredibly important. I think it is a must have for socio-political types fascinated by the 20th Century, or anyone interested in WW2 and the Stalin cult of personality. And if you want to know about the Battle of Stalingrad - well, you get three hours of that too, told in exacting detail and quite remarkably filmed.",1358726400,3,2124,4.5483028720626635
4466154,1,B004TXFFI6,"Soviet video, stalin is lovely, calm and comprehensive, very smart, this is a film, acted, dramatized, not real combat  scenes, grandiose soviet music at background,  it was a waste of money",1358035200,7,190,5.096774193548387
4466155,5,B004TXFFI6,"This movie, made in 1949, is typical of the period.  Yes, it shows Stalin as a wise and far-seeing leader who remined calm through all crises, and who was so gentle in his manner that he could never have commited any atrocities.  Yes, it's got a good deal of communist propoganda in it.  However, let the viewer remember that all war movies of that period showed the leaders in this same light, be they Soviet, British, or American.  History is written by the victors, as they say.

Leaving aside the whitewash job it did on the soviet leaders, and the absence of Gen. Zhukov, who was out-of-favor at the time it was made, it is a film about a battle, and it does a good job of showing the crucial events.  There is no 'love interest', and no stories of soldiers in basic training.  It tells the story of the battle and very little else.  There are many brief scenes of arrows showing troop movements, making the progress of the battle clear.

Todays' war movies owe nothing to the leaders, and don't have much in them in the way of propoganda, but they also focus on the emotional aspects so much that they aren't much good for learning history.  In 1949, war movies were about war.  Today, they're usually about the people who fight them.  That's a good thing, but it's also interesting to see the war; understand the strategy; and even see the propaganda that went along with it.

I learned more watching this movie than I have from any war film made in the last 20 or 30 years.

I was at once repelled and fascinated by the way Stalin was shown.  The butcher of millions is shown as the sagacious leader and trustworthy ""Vozd"" (boss), and the film makes it easy to see why so many Russians still revere him. They believed the propaganda, but then, that's what propaganda is supposed to do - seem believable.

It's also pretty clear that the restoration and subtitles was done by a small company, who knew it would never sell in huge numbers, and that's why it costs so much.  If you're interested in Soviet history or in WWII history, you won't regret having this in your collection, though you may well regret the price.

I am glad the Russians won this battle, from which Hitler, Churchill's ""bloodthirsty guttersnipe"", never recovered.  It's a pity that the true victor, Gen. Zhukov, wasn't shown as he should be.  Nevertheless, if The Soviets hadn't won, things on this earth would be a lot worse.

I look forward to seeing a modern Russian epic on the same theme that will show the truth, but when it happens, I won't throw this one out.

History is written by the victors, yes.  But it's also only written by the survivors, and in the long run, Stalinism didn't survive.",1340582400,16,2680,4.514522821576763
