1663481,1,B00005U13M,I guess some people might like this. I was very disappointed with the level of violence.,1264118400,,88,4.5625
1663482,2,B00005U13M,"This movie spent a lot of time on sexual implications and direct sexual, vulgar language.  At one point a woman in the movie kept begging to be f...ked and was murdered for bothering a man who would not.  The picture was blurry most of the time but I was able to watch it.  The plot was ok, (nothing exciting).  For the age and price of this movie it was passable.

Watch this if you have nothing else to watch.",1172016000,,411,4.151898734177215
1663483,3,B00005U13M,"This film is unbelievably bad, a product/relic of the French film industry at its low water mark in the early 1980's. Lee Marvin, in his penultimate role, appears to be drunk and nearly dead throughout most of the film. Tina Louise (yes, ""Ginger"" from Gilligan's Island and still sporting the same hair style) is cast at Lee Marvin's ""moll"", presumably because the producer/director found them in the same nursing home. The sound is terrible, the dubbing is unintentionally hilarious and the film is presented in full screen (pan and scan).

So why did I give it three stars? This is a ""party"" film, to be enjoyed while inebriated with your friends. That and the fact that Lee Marvin was a better ""action hero"" with one foot in the grave than most of today's crop of wannabes.",1171152000,4,776,4.705882352941177
1663484,3,B00005U13M,"An armored car holdup goes bad, and the Lee Marvin character is on the run.  He ends up hiding on the farm of a dysfunctional family.  Everyone wants the bag of money he grabbed during the holdup.  The plot seems to be more about the family than about the robbery.  The motion picture has sex (there are scenes in a bordello, including bondage and discipline; bedroom scenes; one scene in the kitchen); significant nudity ranging from female nudest campers to a boy getting his butt whipped; and a large amount of violence.  I would personally give it an R rating or, in the other rating system, AO for adult only.  I am looking at the uncut French version.  You will obviously not see this on TV, at least not in the United States.

I would agree with a previous reviewer that the sound quality is bad.  Perhaps that is the result of a poor job dubbing in English for a French film.  It was necessary to strain to hear some of the dialogue, which made it difficult at times to follow the story.  It is an obviously older Lee Marvin in the motion picture, and it is not one of his better acting assignments.

It is hard to say who actually ends up with the money.  Many characters end up dead, and some murders are conveniently blamed on the robber.",1104451200,6,1249,4.378260869565217
1663485,5,B00005U13M,this is a solid period movie.  fair warning it is full of sexual content that I couldn't believe was in a movie from this time. It was obviously dubbed from french but what I cannot figure out is that lee marvin is actually speaking english while all the characters speak french. Overall a solid film with lots of twists.,1092441600,2,321,4.440677966101695
1663486,1,B00005U13M,"Movie is OK, but DVD quality is practically non-existent, sound is just bad.",1078358400,7,76,4.923076923076923

7954171,1,B00005U13M,"My pick for the WORST Lee Marvin film of all time.  The only reason he could have made this piece of garbage is because they paid him a very large sum to do it.  My review? There's not ONE GOOD THING to say about this film. It is, unquestionably, a complete waste of time to watch this film. I only bought it because I'm a huge Lee Marvin fan so I collect all his films.",1470009600,,370,3.92
7954172,1,B00005U13M,"The movie was actually good for it's time, which made it all the more frustrating. However the transfer was so so bad! Sound was often inaudible, picture was cut from wide to old TV format, so often you only saw half of the actor's face that was speaking. Looks like it was transferred from a used VHS tape.",1425340800,,307,4.310344827586207
7954173,4,B00005U13M,"It was good,but didn't know it was forgein? I like Tina Louise though! Might buy more of her movies. Good prompt service.",1401580800,,121,4.545454545454546
7954174,3,B00005U13M,"I have seen this film a few times and each time I am left with the thought, it could have been much better. The director probably saw gangster films from the 1940's and wanted to make a film in that style with Marvin playing a Bogart type character.  Many characters dress in 40's style including Marvin, with suits and hats. The opening is quite good, but it goes down hill from there. For starters the subplot of the woman who craves sex could have been cut out, completely. It ruins the film.  Also the subplot of the two girls sunning themselves, looks very out of place too. That alone would have improved the film a lot. The dubbing is poor too. Marvin really carries the film, his strong screen presence makes it watchable. Still some of the action is OK, and some great. I added a extra star because I am a Marvin fan.",1387843200,,826,4.357142857142857
7954175,1,B00005U13M,I'm a huge Lee Marvin fan and the reason I gave this only 1 star is because the DVD was of such poor quality.  It looked like 10 generation VHS and their was no audio.  I'd love to get a good copy if available.  But the reseller was great and refunded my money with no questions.,1382572800,,279,3.9464285714285716
7954176,5,B00005U13M,this is a great MOVIE if you likie lee marvin oh I forgot GINGER IS IN THIS TOO  she looks hot as usal,1362268800,,102,3.4347826086956523
7954177,2,B00005U13M,"Clearly this is not Lee Marvin's most memorable role. After robbing an armed vehicle using a bazooka, wearing a suit with a red carnation, Jimmy Cobb (Lee Marvin) hides out in a barn at a farmhouse owned by oversexed siblings who abuse their help. He ditches the money in the wheat field, but it is quickly removed by a boy who enjoys whiskey, cigarettes, and the local cat house where his aunt works. Everyone is after the money they think is buried in the field.

The film has lost something over time. My bad transferred to DVD copy made watching a film that lacked some entertainment value more difficult. The film claims it was made in 1984, but it has the feel of a 1970's sex comedy. Even Lee Marvin couldn't save this film.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, N-word, sex, nudity, sex talk.",1361664000,,787,4.535211267605634
7954178,1,B00005U13M,i HAD TO SEND THE DVD BACK BECAUSE IT WAS FAULTY AND COULD NOT PLAY THE DVD. THE PROVIDER NEEDS TO CHECK THE QUALITY OF HIS DVDS BEFORE SENDING.  NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER,1352419200,,166,4.03030303030303
7954179,1,B00005U13M,"This review is not so much about the film, but the poor quality of the DVD.
The picture quality is horrific! Fortunately, I only lost $2.00 on it not including S&H and sales tax.
This should serve as a warning! If the item is too low-priced, it's more than likely of poor quality (as opposed to high inventory). I will never buy DVD's from Beverly Wilshire Filmworks. I'll have to seek out the French only version of ""Canicule"" found on Amazon.fr, which was released by Studio Canal. I hope I have better luck!

Love and Peace,
Carlos Romero",1331078400,,541,4.520408163265306
