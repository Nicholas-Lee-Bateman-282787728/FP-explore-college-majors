8636505,4,B00HVJZ4OA,"This 4 part serial showcases a young Anthony Newly as well as Bernard Lee (well known as ""M"" in the early James Bond movies).  It's an entertaining kids' adventure.  Although it could have benefited from some restoration to remove the audio noise and some of the video noise, it is watchable.  Due to the apparent total lack of any restoration efforts the quality of the video and especially the audio suffer; but, it all seems to be there and there are no noticeable gaps and the ""noise"" is more or less tolerable.  The 4 stars are for the content -- not for the quality of the audio or video ... keep in mind that this was made in 1947 and the years have not been very kind to the original ""film"".",1433548800,3,699,4.312977099236641
8636506,4,B00HVJZ4OA,"Produced at J. Arthur Rank's Gainsborough Studios in 1947, this five-part children's serial is extremely well made and a lot of fun.
The highlight is seeing Tony (later Anthony) Newley's  very assured and likable screen debut as Dusty Bates, a stowaway on his sailor uncle's ship who discovers a jewel smuggling racket, unbeknown to the ship's captain played by the estimable Bernard Lee.  A very young looking sixteen at the time, it is not difficult to understand why David Lean perfectly cast Newley as the Artful Dodger in his classic film version of ""Oliver Twist"" a year later.
Newley gets a lot of solid support in this film with the other two featured juveniles effectively played by Billie Brook and Michael McKeag and the usual contingent of fine British character actors. Apart from the ever reliable Lee, there is the typical middle class mum of the period (Grace Arnold), Dusty's uncle (Wally Hatch) and his seafaring mate (Ronald Shiner)  and amongst the villains, Ralph Truman and John Longden.
A bit thin on plot but with a thrill packed final chapter, this serial makes excellent use of location filming around the London docks and I presume the Islington Studios of Gainsborough (which was once a power station) came in handy for the warehouse scenes, etc.  Sadly Rank closed this old studio down in 1950.
Thanks to Alpha Video for resurrecting this ""lost"" post-war children's entertainment which even us older kids can still enjoy.  The print is more than presentable;  no restoration (if that was ever possible!) or extras from this budget label.  A bargain at less than six bucks!",1426982400,5,1601,4.951492537313433
8636507,2,B00HVJZ4OA,Great to see this serial out on Dvd but no attempt has been made to give any restoration or special features. At best it is no better than VHS tape. Cheap and cheerful only.,1394582400,3,173,4.117647058823529
