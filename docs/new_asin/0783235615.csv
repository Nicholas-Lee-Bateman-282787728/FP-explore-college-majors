Also  in the new version of the movie, since Hitchcock's 100th birthday, when  Piccoli goes to Moscow and his counter-part Stafford says ""Yes, that's  the end of Topaz"". Or like young Claude Jade says: ""o I love the  cubans, they are so wild!""",953251200,2,459,4.7

70137,5,0783235615,"Excellent film; one of my favorite Hitchcock movies.  I would rank this at the top of his second tier movies.....almost great, but did not have major Hollywood stars (except John Forsythe) and most of the cast were Europeans or lesser known Americans, like John Vernon who is best remembered as Dean Vernon Wormer in ANIMAL HOUSE.  The performance by Frederick Stafford as Andr Devereaux is truly outstanding, as is that of Dany Robin as Nicole Devereaux.  The last half hour of the film is spine tingling.  There are three endings to the film: 1.a duel where the villain is shot in the back...awful. 2. both leave on adjacent airplanes, Aeroflot and Pan Am....very unrealistic...odds of those two aircraft being adjacent to one another are about a million to one. 3.  the villain goes home and commits suicide by shooting himself off camera......the best and most realistic.",1463702400,3,875,4.965753424657534

70146,1,0783235615,"I won't spend time listing all the reasons I consider myself a true Hitchcock fan.  If you read this, I'm assuming you'll at least give me the benefit of the doubt.  This is the bottom of the barrel.  Anyone praising it or giving it more than two stars is out of their minds.  Lackluster acting, sloppy plot execution to the point of near incoherence, and who knows what ending you'll get with the version you buy.  Doesn't that really tell you everything?  The first version, approved by Hitchcock, was laughed at in previews, so on with re-shoots.  Problem was certain actors weren't available, so they cobbled together another ending, and still another one.  As with even the absolute worst of Hitchcock, there are some glowing moments, a few interesting camera moves, and some decent acting from the second and third strings.  If you're a true fan of The Master, you should see this film only after you've seen all the others.  But you better have a magazine or a crossword puzzle with you.  That's the only way you'll get through it.",1441670400,,1038,4.679558011049724
70157,3,0783235615,"TOPAZ, based on a novel of the same name by Leon Uris, was Hitchcock's second (and final) foray into the Cold War, and is about a French agent who gets caught in between the Americans and the Russians. By this point in his career, Hitchcock was quite content to plagiarize himself, as a lot of elements in TOPAZ can be found in his other (better) films, but I did find this to be a slight improvement over his previous effort, TORN CURTAIN. Without the star power behind this as was in TORN CURTAIN, TOPAZ's story, as labyrinthine and convoluted as it is, is brought to the foreground. As always, Hitch's use of camera-work and editing to create suspense is as evident here as it is throughout most of his other work. The sequence which stood out the most to me was a prolonged, mostly silent scene in which a Martinique agent gains access to a hotel where he will get some documents important to the plot, all while his French contact watches from the other side of the street. There was also a just-before-death confession reminiscent of one in THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH, and an exquisitely filmed death scene in which a woman's purple dress fills most of the screen. Still, the plot this time was a bit unwieldy. As there weren't any stars in the film, there wasn't as much focus in the story as I would have liked. At first you think it will be about some Russian defectors, later American NATO agents, and then it settles on a French NATO agent who works on behalf of the Americans to get some information on Russian activities in Cuba. Although it will probably benefit from watching it a few more times, on first viewing it was a lot of take in and keep track of. Still, the complicatedness of it all allowed for some interesting double and triple-dealings. From an acting standpoint, I thought that most of the performances were rather wooden. Considering that this is perhaps the most talkative Hitchcock movie I've seen so far, it was a little difficult to watch in that regard. Still, it wasn't all bad. John Forsythe (THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY) had a supporting role as an American NATO agent, and he did fine. And even though badly miscast, John Vernon did alright for himself as Cuban Rico Parra. Switching composers again, Maurice Jarre provided the score, and while not in the same league as Bernard Herrmann (after all, who is?), his cues and main theme set the tone of the film quite nicely with some occasionally quirky touches. The title sequence, set over a Russian parade, also had a stirring martial quality that perfectly set the mood for the tense opening scene. Overall, I would say that TOPAZ has more immediate entertainment value than did TORN CURTAIN, although the plot is more complicated and the acting isn't as good. Still, TOPAZ is as eloquently produced as anything Hitchcock laid his hands on and provides enough thrills to balance out the long running time.",1439683200,,2891,4.637426900584796

There is no commentary, for God's sake, and, worse, there is, not an appreciation, as promised, but a disapproval, a harsh criticism, a grumble, by an expert who sniffs at Hitchcock for failing to live up to said expert's superior standards.",1438473600,,465,4.9743589743589745
70161,2,0783235615,"I rented this film and couldn't get through it.  Too much unfocused action, not enough of a through story to keep me riveted.  Like Hitchcock after Psycho, this film feels tired and bloated, and incoherent too boot.  I remember seeing this film in real time, and feeling the same way, although I was a mere slip of a lad who still had hair.  Well, John Forsythe in a hat is always a welcome presence, and Dean Wormer (John Vernon) as Fidel or is it Che, remains riveting.

70163,3,0783235615,"This review is for the movie in general, I bought the Hitchcock BD collection including this movie. All I can say is that it's a decent spy flick but nothing spectacular at all. I kept expecting some typical Hitchcock flare for visuals but nothing really happens other than a fairly uneventful 'cold war' espionage theme regarding the Cuban missile crisis. Good casting, good acting but the screenplay was quite boring. I can't see myself watching this over and over, more like once in a blue moon.",1436659200,,498,4.8023255813953485
70164,3,0783235615,"This is one of those stories that drags. It's boring and mundane at times, but mostly in the first half of the film. By the second half, it does pick up, but then the ending is a disappointment. Nevertheless, if you're looking for a spy film and you're a Hitchcock fan, this movie is worth watching once. It concerns the Cuban missile crisis and the Russian-Cuban Communist ties of the early 1960s. It is shown from the point of view of a French spy who is on assignment for the American government. I admit I don't know much about this era in history, because I wasn't born until the mid-1970s. But then, I've always been fascinated with the Cold War since it was still going on in the Reagan-era 1980s. If you like Cold War spy films, this is okay. I prefer ""Torn Curtain"" to this; I know most would disagree. Again, this isn't a terrible film, but there are better films about the Cold War available.",1436140800,3,903,4.413173652694611
70165,3,0783235615,"Hitchcock's Topaz isn't so much a good film but it had the potential to be. It's way too long for no good reason which the film tends to drag at times, with some better editing in the script it could've been less bloated and a lot smoother throughout. The actors weren't huge stars in Topaz but did an alright acting job. This was back in 1969 which the Hayes code expired but Hitch would take to his advantage until his follow up in '72 Frenzy. As by this point he was interested in the Cold War which we saw in his previous film. Topaz takes us back to the Cuban Missile Crisis in the early '60s where American spies are sent to Cuba and find Russia hiding weapons which is where the US first finds out in the film. I did enjoy it's plot as well as some decent suspense but it does get a little boring at times. It is worth giving a try if you're a diehard Hitchcock fan as I am and recently finished watching all of his films. All I can say is that his films were rather consistent for 6 decades but with that many some are just going to be better than others. There were some real masterpieces from the all time classics (Psycho, Rear Window, Vertigo, North By Northwest) as well as some truly underrated gems (Rope, Murder!, Blackmail, The Lodger, Trouble With Harry, Family Plot), there were some that were downright awful (Juno And The Paycock, Champagne, Skin Game) and there were some average ones in there as well. Topaz falls into that category which might be a bit above average, I personally enjoyed it more than his previous film Torn Curtain which most fans would disagree. The pacing and length are what put the film in mediocrity, it's not the plot or the film itself. Topaz is worth checking out if you're a fan of Hitchcock, you're not missing much though if you're not. Topaz is really just alright, take it or leave it.",1435968000,,1840,4.36734693877551
70166,5,0783235615,It's a nice spy story and the storyline is good.  Recommended.,1434844800,,62,4.636363636363637
70177,4,0783235615,"Hitchcock spotters will have an easy time catching his wheelchair at the airport cameo in TOPAZ (1969). Special mention to Roscoe Lee Browne, who's excellent in a small but pivotal role during the NYC segment.

This Cold War drama begins with a defection to the U.S. of high-ranking KGBer Boris Kusenov (Per-Axel Arosenius) and his revelation to debriefers of unnamed French spy 'Topaz' who's been supplying NATO secrets to the Russians. American CIA agent Michael Nordstrom (John Forsythe) asks his French counterpart currently stationed in D.C., Andre Devereaux (Frederick Stafford), for assistance in learning what exactly is contained in a secret Cuba/USSR agreement.

Devereaux, who has strong ties to Fidel Castro's government as well as Resistance connections there, travels first to Harlem and then Cuba, even as Russian nukes are being shipped to that island. These medium range missiles and their Soviet operators quickly bring on the Oct.'62 Cuban Missile Crisis. Everywhere Andre goes during these perilous days, those close to him meet tragic fates. He himself pays a steep price for what's discovered, both personally and professionally.

The only fault (if any) of this interesting adaptation of the Leon Uris espionage thriller is one of rhythm. The film goes on for an inordinately long time and when you expect a finale it takes another turn, a last bit of business that ends as unexpectedly as it begins. This jarring conclusion is followed by a cheesy montage of story highlights that flash over Maurice Jarr's music track. It's doubtful many in theaters stayed to see them.",1431129600,,1594,5.21875

70182,4,0783235615,"This film captures very well the fear and suspicion of the 1960s between the west and the Soviet Union.  The U.S. government was very concerned that the USSR putting missiles in Cuba would upset the delicate balance in the western hemisphere and possibly lead to a nuclear war.  John Forsythe and Frederick Stafford are agents for their governments (the U.S. and France) working together to learn of a sleeper Soviet agent within French Intelligence who was giving NATO secrets to the Soviets.  Through their investigation, and with the help of a defector, they learn that the Soviets are indeed putting offensive missiles into Cuba.  Alfred Hitchcock was superb in his direction of this story of international intrigue.  John Vernon, Roscoe Lee Browne, and Karin Dor also star in this great movie.

70184,2,0783235615,"As much as I would have liked to have given this film 5 stars because it was the only one to have been critical of the dictatorship I cannot do so in good conscience. Incidentally, the plot of this movie was based on a true story of espionage: a Russian high official defected with his family and fingered a spy ring in the highest level of France.

All right, why did this film lack the usual Hitchcock touch? Unlike Psycho, the score was terrible as was the dialogue. There were spots where the acting was wooden. Karin Dor's acting was at times overdone. Several times when suspense was going to build up simply failed to do so.

70228,4,0783235615,"I've seen most of Alfred Hitchcock's films but this is the first time I've seen this espionage thriller.  Critics and audiences at the time pretty much condemned the film, I suspect mostly because it didn't compare to other Hitchcock classics.

The story is set in 1962 and the American CIA suspects that the Soviet Union is moving armament into Cuba, including possible nuclear missiles.  The agent in charge to find out is Michael Nordstrom played by John Forsythe, who I suspect was the only recognizable actor in the film, at least by American audiences.  A Soviet defector to the U. S. has provided enough information that would confirm the military buildup, but more detail is needed.  Nordstrom has also learned that there may be a leak within the NATO allies, specifically the French.

Nordstrom is friendly with Andre Devereaux (Frederick Stafford), a French spy based in Washington.  Devereaux agrees to help the Americans, but keeps it a secret from his bosses who may be in cahoots with the Soviets.  Hitchcock, who liked to work on set locations, spreads his wings here shooting in Denmark, France, Germany and New York as well as California.  The film looks good with some obvious exceptions like driving a car with fake backdrops.

Devereaux who is married with a grown daughter also has a girlfriend (Karin Dor) in Cuba who poses as a Castro revolutionary but is actually part of an underground movement to depose him.  Devereaux's time in Havana takes up much of the film's running time and that is clearly a problem.  One of my favorite characters is Rico Parra (John Vernon) who is one of Castro's lieutenants.  He's mean but not without occasional sympathy.  I was also frustrated by all of the native Spanish speaking and French speaking cast speaking in English.  Here's a group of French bureaucrats speaking English with strong French accents.  Kinda dumb.

Still I liked the film to some degree.  Maybe it was the historical element.  This is the days of Kennedy's strong stand against the Soviets in October, 1962.  The biggest issue is the bloated length (143 minutes).  Ouch!

The Blu ray disc comes in 1080p with a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  There are some evident digital corrections to the film but, overall, looked pretty good.  Skin tones are accurate, colors are bright and consistent and black levels are good.  No complaints, just don't expect a demo grade transfer.  The audio includes a DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 Mono track.  It seems perfectly aligned with the film.  Dialog is clear (save the accents noted above) and properly centered.  The musical soundtrack is excellent but don't expect to be blown away technically.  A good mix.  Extras include an ""Appreciation"" piece by critic Leonard Maltin, 3 alternate endings, storyboards, photos and a trailer.  Subtitles are available in Spanish, French and English SDH.",1394236800,,2849,4.983014861995754

70247,3,0783235615,"For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some thoughts on this movie...

Topaz (1969) is an Alfred Hitchcock Cold War spy thriller.  Hitchcock was in a slump in the mid to late 1960s starting with Torn Curtain (1966), and later Topaz.  Topaz, while not a bad movie, is problematic for me for several reasons.  One is that it's too long.  I believe it's Hitch's longest film ever.  For a movie that's already dull, dry, stale, and bland, this is borderline torture.  Secondly, I find that I can't really connect with the characters very much.  They're just sort of on the screen doing their thing and they're not exactly likeable.  Third, the acting is wooden for the most part.  Fourth, the movie lacks the typical ""Hitchcock feel"" of his previous movies.  I think Hitchcock briefly lost his touch during the second half of the 1960s.  Maybe it's because of his choice of stories and plots - that is, making Cold War spy thrillers.  There are a some good moments in Topaz, but they're not great in number.  Lastly, the dialogue is too lengthy throughout much of the movie, adding to the dullness.

On the plus side, this movie does have some nice looking women in it.  I added a star because of this.  The sets are pretty good, also.

I really don't think this movie should be labeled an ""Alfred Hitchcock Masterpiece"".  It's far from it.  I do think that every Hitchcock fan should view it and judge for themselves.  This might be one of those movies that might grow on you over time the more times you watch it - an acquired taste.  I give it 3 stars because it does have some memorable moments and is well filmed.

The extras on the DVD include a segment called ""Topaz: An Appreciation"" by film historian and critic Leonard Maltin.  Maltin does a good job describing why this movie has been unfairly criticized while also making a good case for its re-evaluation decades later.  He also does a good job sticking up for Hitchcock and gives many interesting viewpoints with historical perspective.  Watch and see for yourself.",1357862400,2,2049,4.635097493036212
70248,5,0783235615,"While this isn't absolutely top-drawer Hitchcock I sure enjoyed it. The way this DVD is presented adds a lot. Leonard Maltin's 29-minute discussion extra is informative and gives good context of the movie to we viewers. Three different endings to Topaz were filmed and this offering contains all three plus Maltin's clip detailing the story behind the multiple endings.

Also, I have a certain affinity for this film after seeing it at the theater as a kid. I suspect virtually everyone reading this can strongly relate to this tendency to perhaps perceive a movie as somewhat better than it probably is, viewing it now on DVD many years later.

I should rate Topaz a four-star entertainment but Amazon invites you to rate this ""product"" and Its clean print, nice packaging, and a half dozen extras add up to a tip-top ""evening at the movies"".",1355356800,2,843,4.847222222222222

As a piece of filmmaking, TOPAZ certainly has atmosphere, with good use of various locations - even though I suspect the Cuban scenes were filmed elsewhere.  However the film itself I think is about half an hour too long: too much time is spent on needless plot exposition, and there are few thrilling moments.  The two central performances are colorless; this might not necessarily be a fault in itself (some of Hitchcock's other stars gave equally nondescript performances), but attention focuses too much on them and not sufficiently on telling the story.

Made after Torn Curtain, Topaz is Hitchcock's return to the spy genre. However, the film fails to generate any real suspense, unlike his earlier films, which are masterpieces and the mostly abysmal Torn Curtain (which had at least one good sequence that had plenty of suspense in comparison to the rest of the movie). I liked John Forsythe (who would later play the unseen Charlie in Charlie's Angels), and Frederick Stafford was very good as Devereaux. The film was also much too long than it should have been, in my opinion. Could have had a better plot and a much better screenplay, though. In my opinion, Torn Curtain was the beginning of the end for The Master Of Suspense as far as suspenseful motion pictures were concerned...

70255,4,0783235615,"Alfred Hitchcock brings to the screen a spy story of satisfying complexity and sophistication written by Leon Uris. It takes place during one of the cold war's hot spots: the Cuban missile crisis.

Michael Nordstrom (John Forsythe) is a top US spy who is forced to enlist the aid of Andre Devereaux (Frederick Stafford) with regard to some critical information about what the Soviets are doing in Cuba. But both men are aware that the ""neutral"" French embassy in Washington seems to have rather too close communication with Moscow. Still, Andre has an ""asset"" in Havana in the form of a beautiful lady who is in love with him, and so he goes to Cuba to see what he can see.

There's a lot of clever twists, a good bit of behind the scenes information concerning how spies do their work, and none of it so fast-paced that one cannot follow it. We spend time in Paris, New York, Havana, and Washington, not to mention on several airplanes.

I'm not going to give too much away, but the critical clues have to do with who knows whom, and who does not know that X knows Y, all of that. There are several intertwined love stories, but they don't overwhelm the picture. Since there is known to be a leak in the French embassy, you can't help looking at several characters and wonder which one is passing information on to the Soviets.

The 3rd part is in New York city and the most dramatic one. The role of Philippe Dubois (the florist-cum-spy) is a pleasure to watch and reminds similar character in Bond's spy stories.
The 4th part, mostly in Paris, is the only part which deals with the title issue, the 'Topaz'.

In the end, I feel the Topaz issue (which really happened in '62) could have been given more space and depth in the film than the missile crisis issue - no matter whether they are related or not. But the film did just the opposite which left questions and motives on the Topaz issue unanswered and the film bit long.

The story concerns itself with the Cuban Missile Crises (circa 1962) and French intelligence's intervention in Cuba with respect to American interests.

A French intelligence officer's wife is having an affair with a man, codename ""Topaz"", and the point is made that all wives always talk ""shop"" concerning the work of their spy spouses. Thus, ""Topaz"" knows everything;

The husband, a French intelligence officer, is having an affair with the beautiful head of a subversive underground group in Havana.  Before starting this movement, she played an important role in the seating of Fidel Castro, as Batista was fleeing. The national respect earned by her work provided a position of influence, but since that time, she has observed that the Castro government is not the government she wanted, so creates a new underground movement for personally satisfaction.

This is a quiet, subtle Hitchcock film without major film stars; that is, stars recognizable to American audiences. But it definitely is Hitchcock, from a book by Leon Uris.

These films without including the saga of Bond films or The man from UNCLE (for instance).

And I make this brief account because the impression after forty five years - specially for the negw generations of movie lovers looks totally different.

In this sense this was (since Thirty nine steps and Sabotage) the third film related with this subject.

Effectively, Hitchcok focuses his attention around the neglected affective repercusions respect the people who was involved. I mean the international conflict is left aside to carve in relief certain unforgettable sequences (such as Juanita's death and the unmasking of Jarre as the link)

This Cold War drama begins with a defection to the U.S. of high-ranking KGBer Boris Kusenov (Per-Axel Arosenius) and his revelation to debriefers of unnamed French spy 'Topaz' who's been supplying NATO secrets to the Russians. American CIA agent Michael Nordstrom (John Forsythe) asks his French counterpart currently stationed in D.C., Andre Devereaux (Frederick Stafford), for assistance in learning what exactly is contained in a secret Cuba/USSR agreement.

Devereaux, who has strong ties to Fidel Castro's government as well as Resistance connections there, travels first to Harlem and then Cuba, even as Russian nukes are being shipped to that island. These medium range missiles and their Soviet operators quickly bring on the Oct.'62 Cuban Missile Crisis. Everywhere Andre goes during these perilous days, those close to him meet tragic fates. He himself pays a steep price for what's discovered, both personally and professionally.

The only fault (if any) of this interesting adaptation of the Leon Uris espionage thriller is one of rhythm. The film goes on for an inordinately long time and when you expect a finale it takes another turn, a last bit of business that ends as unexpectedly as it begins. This jarring conclusion is followed by a cheesy montage of story highlights that flash over Maurice Jarr&eacute;'s music track.

There is also an array of excellent French actors, who speak only in heavily accented English.  Nonetheless, it is a very good film, if not a great one.

The main character is a French intelligence operative, who operates in close cooperation with the CIA and is a kind of maverick.  He is extremely good at what he does and has a system of his own operatives and collaborators set up.  As he gets involved in an investigation at the behest of the CIA, he comes into contact with crude Cuban revolutionaries (one of them finds a diplomatic dispatch wrapped around a half-eaten hamburger), uses an affair to get information about Russian missile placements in Cuba, and then fights to find a conspiracy (and at the same time save his career) in Paris.  He operates in environments that mix elegant style with the saddest brutalities and constant threats, often humorously portrayed.

70275,4,0783235615,"After the cold war in East Germany in ""Torn Curtain"", Hitchcock had to deal with the big bad wolf, the USSR. And he did in this film, though it concerns more Washington and France, but only a little bit Cuba and practically not at all the USSR, directly at least since the bad guy is the USSR. We are in October 1962. A top KGB official defects to the USA and reveals a few things, but little, about Cuba. He confirms at least something is happening in Cuba. Hitchcock finds it funny to insist on the incompetence and impotence of the Americans, and particularly the CIA. That's the first remark from the KGB fleeing official. But it is shown in length. They are obliged to go through a French secret agent in Washington to get the information they want, including the pictures of his mission to Cuba for surveillance of the Russian deliveries. And it is funny how the French commercial attach&eacute; of the French embassy is going to use his connection with another French agent from the French West Indies to approach the necessary person in the Cuban delegation to the United Nations General Assembly to get a copy of the agreement between the USSR and Cuba. And he will then go to Cuba himself to get the hard photographic data he needs. What is surprising is not the fact that some French secret service people helped the USA at a time when they could not get what they wanted, in 1962 when the world was on the brink of a nuclear war. What is funny is that this film comes four years after the decision by General de Gaulle to kick NATO out of France, and one year after the famous 1968 events and in fact the year when General de Gaulle resigned from power in the spring of 1969. The film was made in 1969. The film was released in the USA only on December 19, 1969 and mostly in 1970 for Europe. It shows how without the French the missile crisis in Cuba would not have been solved by John F. Kennedy, a recollection that goes against the strong campaign against General de Gaulle and France in 1969 due to the strong opposition General de Gaulle took against the Vietnam war in 1967 and 1968, including his famous speech in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, shortly before Nixon sent US troops into that country. But the film has another interest in the title and what it means: a spying ring directly in the French government at top level of specialists and technical executives, just under ministerial positions. That ring called Topaz was spying in the French government and NATO for the USSR. The film shows how the poor commercial attach&eacute; is mixed in the doings of that ring without knowing at first and then knowing and trying to expose the ring and the men, but expose them within the very power structure of France, which is the way things are done in France: keep everything within the family circle and let's wash our dirty laundry in private. They even let the top rung of that ring leave for the Soviet Union when the whole business is finished and the commercial attach&eacute; is sent back to Washington from where he had been called back. There Hitchcock is becoming in a way funny, scary too, but definitely funny. The French and their little love affairs, and their little private luncheons and dinners, the French and their republican aristocratic dealings and etiquette, and of curse their cute eighteenth and nineteenth century houses and mansions in Paris, these places you hardly see behind their majestic facades. And Hitchcock even uses well-known French actors from the 1968-1969 period and makes them speak English with a very elaborate English French accent, far away from the French accent we all associate with camembert, red wine and bread baguette, but that has all to do with fluent English spoken by bilingual French individuals. Maurice Chevalier's out. It's that humor that is funny, both strange and ah ah. But with time I am afraid it has aged and is more nostalgic, for those who can remember, than really active today. Though Cuba is still there and still standing in its revolutionary shoes, though pretty worn out and being renovated as fast as possible, in these days when all the ex-Maoist and ex-Soviet guerrilla or open warfare movements like the Tamil Tigers, the FARCs and the Nepali Maoists are moving out of the violent terrorist picture and eventually back into the political and economic vaster democratic picture, and Russia is definitely still trying to put the Soviet boots back on and rebuild their past glory and power. The great change is that China is the potential first economic power in the world and that they have decided to associate quite a few people with them in that new role. We might finally reach a real multi-polar world twenty years after the fall of the Iron Curtain and of the dual-divide across the big global cake.

70300,3,0783235615,"""Topaz"" is a tired Cold War thriller from the Master.

After the disaster of ""Torn Curtain"", Hitchcock had a go at making another ""Bond-like"" film but once again he missed the mark and never tried it again. If he had not made the brilliant ""Frenzy"" three years later one could easily have come to the conclusion that he was well past his best.

One of the major problems with ""Topaz"" is that the actors are all second-rate - particulary Frederick Stafford in the lead role of a French intelligence agent.

There are some interesting touches  - for example the scene in the flower shop where we can't hear what the actors are saying - but this film smacks of a once-great director struggling to find his feet in the ""modern"" cinema.

""Topaz"" should be seen once by all Hitchcock fans, but despite the advocacy of Leonard Maltin and other reviewers, Hitchcock's third-to-last film doesn't have much to recommend it.",1182038400,,913,4.716981132075472
70301,4,0783235615,"The reasessment of Hitchcock's 1960's work continues, begun with the amazing Marnie. (Torn Curtain may be a lost cause, however.) It's fair to say that Topaz benefits from this ongoing reconsideration. It's just a very good movie.

The plot follows an episodic but compelling arc along the trail of French cold-war spy leaks. A number of satisfying (and inter-twining) sub-stories among the large cast are well presented. The parallel infidelities of the Stafford/Robin husband and wife are interesting and key to ultimate plot resolution. Some very nice ""set pieces"" are included, the tent poles that support Hitchcock movies. I found the location photography to be both realistic and refreshing. The film's main fault, of course, is the absence of a convincing ending. How Hitch believed that the ""duel"" ending would stand up is beyond me. I'm not sure how Uris ended his book.

Jarre's music is almost laughable, certainly in comparison with the monumental Herrmann. Topaz is a serious movie about serious themes (betrayal, good versus evil) and Jarre's music does nothing to advance these themes.

Finally, Leonard Maltin's commentary touches powerfully on Hitchcock's directorial powers, the likes of which are few and far-between these days. Outside of maybe Soderberg and Tykwer, most modern-day directors have little idea of where to place the camera, how to sequence images through cutting, et al.  (Poster child of directorial ineptitude is Ron Howard who absolutely doesn't have a clue.)  Suffice it to say that Topaz is a very well directed movie that delivers visual style and meaning in spades.",1154476800,45,1608,5.265625
70302,2,0783235615,"It became generally assumed after ""Torn Curtain"" and even more so after ""Topaz""  that the great Hitchcock had finally fallen victim to the march of time.  It turns out what he had actually fallen victim to were idiots at Universal Studios who insisted he hop on the ""evils-of-communism"" bandwagon.  The results turned out to be exactly what these meddlers deserved.  ""Topaz"" is, simply put, a misguided failure on just about every count.  Hitchcock loathed location filming, and this film required extensive location work.  Music had always been an integral part of the Hitchcock ""recipe"".  Since he had lost his favorite composer, Bernard Herrmann (again precipitated by studio meddling on ""Torn Curtain"") the score was composed by the fine Maurice Jarre who, unfortunately, just didn't seem able to fill Herrmann's shoes.  It is obvious in scene after scene that Hitchcock just didn't give a damn about this film.  And the lesson cost Universal over $4 Million, nearly five times as much as Hitch had spent on ""Psycho"" a few years earlier.

The fact that Hitchcock was still fully capable of making a good film was proven when he came roaring back some three years later with the remarkable ""Frenzy"" and, a couple of years later, with his valedictory, the lovely ""Family Plot"".

""Topaz"" is a slight blemish on a remarkable career.  Nothing more, nothing less.",1150070400,4,1361,5.026785714285714

70304,3,0783235615,"Despite the failure of ""Torn Curtain"", Hitchcock decided to make another Cold War spy thriller. Based on the Leon Uris novel of the same name, ""Topaz"" is meant to be an exciting and suspenseful spy drama. However, it comes off as poor excuse for a James Bond movie.

If that last comment seemed harsh, don't take it to heart. ""Topaz"" has actually aged fairly well. It isn't a masterpiece and pales in comparison to even ""Torn Curtain"", but it sill makes for an entertainign film.

The film's plot involves a CIA agent (John Forsythe) who has French operative by the name of Deveraux (Frederick Stafford) go to Cuba and intercept Russian missile rumors and a Nato spy named Topaz. While in Havana, Deveraux's investigation becomes riskier with each move. People are double crossed, mudered and comitting suicide. When he returns home to Paris, the danger builds, leading up to a predictable but overall satisfying end.

The film does have some good things going for it. It is far from Hitch's best work, but some of the scenes are fantastic. The acting is top notch as well, especially Stafford, John Vernon and Forsythe. The extras are cool, especially the three alternate endings. I don't highly recommend ""Topaz"", but it certainly won't be a waste if you buy it.",1128038400,15,1264,4.815668202764977
70305,3,0783235615,"Director Alfred Hitchcock's uneven adaptation of Leon Uris' ""Topaz""  does not rank among his finest efforts. However, the 1969 espionage thriller is not without merit. There are classic Hitchcockian touches scattered amidst a rather overlong story, particularly his imaginative use of sound during the New York segments. Though lacking in star power, the international cast (particularly John Forsythe, Frederick Stafford, Roscoe Lee Browne, John Vernon and Karin Dor) is better than expected.  Unfortunately, the film suffers from several lengthy dialogue sequences that bog down the globe-trotting narrative. ""Topaz"" cries out for more action - and less talk - from the Master of Suspense.",1127433600,21,691,5.699029126213592
70306,3,0783235615,"THE MOVIE:

Topaz is one of those movies that when I watch it I keep checking the time to figure out how much longer I have to watch it. The reason is simple. There are some great scenes and there is an okay story but it takes to long to actually get to the story. The movie picks up for me whem Frederick Stafford goes to New York. I think the movie could have included only a little bit of the things that happened before since we are told that there is a defecting russian (Credits). Then have the russian defector tell what he knows. Finally John Forsyth commissions Frederick Stafford in his hotel room and the movie starts like that. I would take other bits here and there out. It could have been a great hour and 45 minute movie! It would have had it's problems but it would be enjoyable. (Many would disagree that so much could be taken out but this is my opinion.) This brings me to ----

THE DVD:

I like that there is an uncut version on the dvd- the problem is the SHORTER theatrical version should have also been included! It needed the trimming that was done for it's theatrical release! Why didn't they include both versions, or the theatrical version with a deleted scenes archive (prefferably both versions)? The fact that the un tightened version is all that is included adds to what was wrong with the film - even in it's theatrical release. Once again I like the fact the uncut version is included but it shouldn't be ALL that was included.

The documentary rocks. I enjoyed it. It isn't the best documentary in the Universal Hitchcock dvd library but it rocks just the same.

I like that they included the three different endings as well...

The trailer isn't his best but is worth a look as well.

The other extras are rather standard but it is nice to have them anyway.",1100736000,24,1792,4.395770392749244
70317,5,0783235615,"Alfred Hitchcock used the true story of the KGB defector Anatoliy Golitsyn [New Lies For Old, The Perestroika Deception] and made it into a brilliant movie.

Golitsyn's real escape from Helsinki's Russian Embassy in 1961 is portrayed here as real challenge although it is not shown how difficult it must've been in reality.

Russian communists were aware of Golitsyn's potential so much that the KGB operations in Finland had to be re-assessed and changed.

In the film Russian defector tells the CIA all important facts about the Soviet infiltration of France's intelligence services, in reality Golitsyn has not only uncovered many Soviet spies inside the US, U.K. and French governments and intelligence services, he also has warned the West of the Soviet long-range plans for the future ""collapse of communism"" which is not [unfortunately] mentioned in this movie.

Hitchcock has done a great job by illustrating how evil communism truly is, by showing the situation in Cuba, the tyrannical oppressive communist machine that will not stop at anything including torture and murder.

Topaz is a masterful movie and should be viewed by many people to remind them that communism, as hideous and horrific this ideology is, shouldn't be allowed to remain alive and well because of its deadly potential that threatens the mankind.",1100044800,13,1327,5.211267605633803
70318,3,0783235615,"After 1966's ""Torn Curtain"" flopped, Hitchcock decided to make another spy thriller. ""Topaz"", based on Leon Uris's best - selling novel of the same name, is meant to be an exciting, suspenseful espionage thriller involving nuclear missiles in Cuba. Despite a few engaging sequences, that show Hitch still had it, the film comes off as a second - rate James Bond flick rather than a Hitchcock masterpiece.
John Forsythe (the only recognizable actor in the entire cast) plays a CIA agent who recruits a French Operative named Devereaux (Frederick Stafford, who gives a great performance despite the film's flaws)to help him find out if rumors of Russian missiles in Cuba are true. His investigation leaves behind a string of casualities who either kill themselves or get murdered. The plot seems cool, but it's slow - moving and hard to follow at some points.
The main thing that keeps ""Topaz"" afloat is the top - notch acting. Hitchcock clearly thought that great acting would triumph over starpower, which is why he filled the cast with highly talented unknowns. In the past, legends like Sean Connery, Jimmy Stewart, Cary Grant, Gregory Peck, Ingrid Bergman, Grace Kelly, and a host of others starred in Hitchcock masterpieces and gave great performances in their roles, but at same points were unconvincing. The acting in ""Topaz"" is flawless; I recommend it.",1083456000,9,1360,5.0488888888888885

Stafford gathers intel provided by his Cuban mistress, a widow of a top revolutionary played by an attractive Karin Dor of James Bond fame.  He manages to smuggle out the information under the suspicious eye of bearded Castro crony John Vernon.
Learning from Forsythe of the existence of an espionage ring, code named Topaz, a group of French politicos spying for the Russians, Stafford sets out to smash it.

Shot directly after 1966's TORN CURTAIN, Hitchcock's TOPAZ is a more matter-of-fact tale than a genuine thriller where real lives were at stake. Essentially an American intelligence head (John Forsythe) uses his friend in the French Intelligence (Frederick Stafford) to spy for the United States in Cuba and at the same time they try to ferret out a high French official passing on secrets to the Soviets. This all takes place during the height of the Cuban missile crisis. Roscoe Lee Browne as Philippe Dubois has the best scenes in the film as he has to get close to the Cuban United Nations delegation visiting Harlem and staying at the Theresa Hotel to photograph some secret papers from a high official (John Vernon as Rico Parra).

70323,4,0783235615,"The story as I got it:  Leon Uris writes books about the middle east for the most part.  Exodus, Mila 18, QB VII, The Haj.  He has an enormous reputation for well researched, gripping novels based on historical fact.  What reason is there to believe he was willing to abandon that reputation for Topaz?  In researching the book QB VII, I'm told, he stumbled across a story that he felt had to be told, and interrupted his work on QB VII to write Topaz.  For reasons of drama, and personal security, it was necessary to rearrange some facts and personalities, but the story is said to be essentially true.
As noted by another reviewer, the movie is good, but not great Hitchcock.  Maybe, it has to do with the truthfulness of the story converting to an action movie.  A similar situation arose in the attempt to make a movie out of Ken Follett's On Wings of Eagles.
I think Hitchcock gave this movie the attention it deserved, but let's face it.  It is easier for anyone to control the pace and action in a fictional work.  The marvel of this movie and the novel upon which it was based, is the way that fiction was interwoven in an essentially true story, leaving the audience to wonder.

Michel Piccoli is a conventional foil. Philippe Noiret is more interesting as a French NATO official, and John Vernon as a Cuban official. The Cubans are not demonized, though Karin Dor does explain her cooperation to him being because Castro has turned the island she loves into a prison.
The film jumps from Copenhagen to Washington to New York to Cuba to Paris. Many of the key scenes are filmed from a distance at which the viewer cannot hear what is said. If the visuals were more interesting, this might work, but as it is, it only makes the characters and their fates seem remote in interest.",979430400,10,902,4.7025316455696204

The film is admittedly dated. Modern thrillers and spy stories have much more action and car chases are in most of them. This film is more subdued, but that does not mean it is not riveting.
