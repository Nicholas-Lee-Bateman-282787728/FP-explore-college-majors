4659004,4,B005DEUEQ8,"""The Harimya Bridge"" is a wonderful film about forgiveness and cultural perspectives and angles.  Due to it's style, it is definitely not a film for ""everyone"", but still, a good film that can give you ideas to consider and leave you warm inside.

FOR THE PARENTS AND OTHER CONCERNED PEOPLE...
Content-wise, there's nothing really to worry about.  It is pretty family friendly actually.  The only thing that may be difficult for some children who are young is it does deal with heavy themes of forgiveness, understanding, and cultural angles.  Also, another issue is that though this is very much American; the style, pacing, and cinematography is very much Asian (I'll explain this later on)...so some may find this difficult to sit through.

MOVING ON...

CINEMATIC STYLE:
This film is difficult for me to use my typical categorical analysis, so I will go ahead and address this first since it is what sets everything up.  I mentioned in the title and in the prior paragraphs that style may be an issue here.  The Asian films that I have seen seem to take a vastly different approach to narrative telling.  Outside of  martial arts/action/thriller films (actually sometimes including them), Asian films often have a quiet and subtle mood.  Even many of the Asian horror films focus more on raising tension through the ""non-active"" moments.  Not too much flash, and sometimes not even much music...just natural ambience.  The Characters make small, but still profound gestures versus huge dramatics that we are used to...often trying to express a lot through the use of little.  And they sparingly (but very intentionally) utilize huge outbursts from the characters.  The directors of this particular film seemed to really want to use that style, and thus this film is a very quiet and not too ""explosive"".  Emotions are more naturally expressed, and very little exaggeration all around.  The visual colors are also fairly dull lacking in vibrancy (not a bad thing...actually it adds to the mood).  Some people may not like this, while others might.  In fact, it's much more quiet and subtle then ""The Pursuit of Hapyness"" was (the closest  parallel I can think of).

PLOT (NO SPOILERS...i'll only mention things found in the synopsis on the back of the DVD):
The plot is fairly basic and straightforward.  After and untimely death of a son, a Father is seeking to reclaim the last remnants of what his son left behind.  There aren't any major plot twists...but only subtle ones.  What this film focuses on is the relationships and perspectives of people.  It follows a more slice-of-life genre.  So, though the plot isn't anything ""unique"" or ""special"", that honestly wasn't the focus of the film in the first place.  Instead, it's the people, their emotions, and their interactions that are the focus.

CHARACTERS:
To be honest, I personally found the characters to be very natural and quite relatable.  The director's weren't aiming this to be a piercing soap opera with exaggerated emotions.  Instead, these are real people with real lives.  That seemed to be the angle they were taking and it really worked well.  They do get angry, they do cry, they do find joy, and some display heavy curiosity...but these are expressed in the most natural and subtle of ways.  I did enjoy the characters and was able to engage in their world.

CULTURE:
Besides forgiveness and other themes, another point that this film desires to drive is the issue of seeing beyond ourselves and our own view.  There are many cultures in the world and they sometimes approach things differently, or have/lack certain practices that are ""totally crazy"" to us.  Thus, this film is portrayed very much from a Japanese perspective (since most of the film takes place in Japan).  Some may find it difficult and insulting to watch because they do a good job in putting you in an uncomfortable situation where two cultural ideas clash.  Depending on your perception, you may see one side as more right than the other, but when it comes down to it...that's not the issue.  The issue the directors are trying to zone in on is ""understanding"".  Some will be made very uncomfortable by this aspect of the film (I was), but I think it's a necessary lesson...this is the reality of the multi-national/cultural world we live in.  As one who has done volunteer work overseas, this has been a lesson I had to learn, as well.  Anyways, besides this major theme...the film reflects many interesting traditions and nuances of the Japanese culture.  It was really cool to watch

ALL IN ALL...
This was a good purchase.  The film may be quiet and subtle in its approach, but it definitely was challenging, testing, and ultimately heartwarming.  A very good lesson about seeing beyond ourselves...whether it's about one culture to the other, or from one person to another.",1335744000,2,4828,4.9183168316831685
4659005,3,B005DEUEQ8,"Movie title is listed as (Blu-ray/DVD Combo) in that order.  One would think packaging is in Blu Ray, not it isn't.  It came in as DVD packaging.  Movie is good.",1326240000,,161,4.3
4659006,2,B005DEUEQ8,"Minor roadblocks to this becoming a better film was the slow pace for the first half hour, mostly on the American side, and the lack of a clearly developed background and development of our central characters. So besides a dozing early experience the viewer has almost no understanding and emotional connection with our main U.S. born protagonists. Even the central Japanese character is only barely known towards the end. The movie felt populated by character puppets.

Major roadblocks were in the overly stereotyped ""Ugly"", push everyone around, American portrayal of Daniel Holder to the point of losing credulity. Second, was the residual hatred by Holder towards the Japanese based upon his father's experience as a Japanese POW. The plot line that he has carried hatred for fifty years doesn't hold up as even most POWs and military personal themselves were willing to move forwards easily within a couple of decades of war's end. To further that by almost disowning his own son who goes to Japan in an exchange teaching program just didn't seem like a natural and loving father behavior.

When Holder recreates his reason for hating the Japanese he mentions mis-treatments in POW camps as well as other atrocities. The Japanese response is that war makes countries do things that they later regret - no one is immune. They cite a few examples such as Vietnam, Korea, Iraq. The film should have driven that point, and really the central theme of forgiveness and understanding, even further. They could have mentioned the fire bombings in Dresden, Germany and Tokyo, Japan; Hiroshima, Nagasaki; chemical warfare such as Agent Orange in Vietnam and neighboring countries that to this day still have deathly health effects. Most notably the movie could have emphasized even further how quickly the peoples of Japan and the other countries forgive as a rebuttal to his reasons for hatred. Holder's predictable 180 degree turn around in attitude after a week was a bit hard to swallow but a nice to see, feel good ending.

A more important issue and the movie's secondary theme of racism and caste discrimination, present in any society, was only touched upon and should have been developed further but all we're given are a few allusions to how a child of Japanese and African-American heritage would be seen in Japan or in America.",1324771200,2,2335,4.997429305912596
4659007,5,B005DEUEQ8,"Featuring a collaboration from the East and the West, ""The Harimaya Bridge"" is a film written and directed by African-American filmmaker Aaron Woolfolk.

Woolfolk, a former JET (Japan Exchange and Teaching Program) participant who lived in Japan for many years and taught in Kochi Prefecture  is known for his short film ""Rage!"" which won a Director's Guild of America Award.  He won an award for his screenplay ""The Harimaya Bridge"" in which he received a Walt Disney Studios/ABC Entertainment Talent Development Grant and in 2008, production began on ""The Bridge of Harimaya"".  Woolfolk would become the first African-American to shoot a feature film in Japan and the film would receive rave reviews.

VIDEO:

""The Harimaya Bridge"" is presented in 1080p High Definition.  For the most part, the film looks very good as skin tones are natural.  But once you get to the filming in Japan, I found the scenery to be breathtaking.  On Blu-ray, the details on the shrine and the areas that Noriko visited, to see the detail on the wood and also just the overall vibrance of the red Harimaya Bridge, it looked beautiful in HD.

And I have to say that where many films are shot in Kanto and Kansai region, it was great to watch a film by an American filmmaker going to an area like Kochi, smaller villages that have been around for over a thousand years and capturing it on camera.  Granted, its thanks to Woolfolk having taught in the area but with so many films shot in the concrete jungle of Japan, it was refreshing to see one shot in the countryside and capturing the overall scenery and ambiance.  I'm a sucker for beautiful scenery and on Blu-ray, the film looked fantastic!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""The Harimaya Bridge"" is presented in Japanese and English Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  The film is primarily a dialogue and music driven film.  Both are crystal clear coming from the center and front channels.  The music from Kazunori Maruyama is absolutely beautiful to listen to.

But as far as the lossless soundtrack goes, the ambiance of the area can be heard through the surround channels.  From birds chirping to even the engine of a vehicle, you can hear it through the surround channels.  Not an immersive soundtrack but for a film of this nature, the lossless soundtrack was appropriate.

The subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""The Harimaya Bridge"" comes with the following special features:

  Making Of - (21:09) The making of ""The Harimaya Bridge"".  A Japanese featurette (with English subtitles) on the making of ""The Harimaya Bridge"".

JUDGMENT CALL:

Heartwarming, emotional and a wonderful co-production between America and Japan!

After watching ""The Harimaya Bridge"", this film definitely had a strong, holding effect on me.  Because what you see in this film are experiences that I had in my life.

Through this film, Aaron Woolfolk is able to communicate a message of needing to understand each other.  To communicate with each other and its because for a lot of people, traditionally through one's perspective, everything is based in your own country.  Unless you are able to travel to another country or to embrace other cultures which is much more easier thanks to the Internet, people can start to learn from each other.

I watched as Ben Guillory played the role of Daniel Holder, a character who still feels the pain of losing a father in World War II and his attitude towards Japan.  I know there are many war veterans who still exhibit this feeling of hatred towards an opposing country due to war, but those who are able to find understanding that war brings out the ugliness of countries and its people.

In my case, I grew up in an area with not many Asian people and during the '80s of Japanese business purchasing American companies, our family was put in position of fear as we were stereotyped as a Japanese family and our home was vandalized with ""Go Home Japs!"" spray-painted all over our house.  I have had an interest in Japanese culture as a child, thanks to my father who was stationed in Japan at one time, but more so because of this incident.  And through college, the majority of my friends were Japanese, I was studying Japanese and dating Japanese.  Also, my brother at time began dating Japanese.

But I was worried because growing up, my grandfather would tell us stories of how he was part of a group of Filipino soldiers who's job was to fight against the Japanese (and eventually were given a chance to become Americans and serve for the American military).  Needless to say, his stories of what they had to do to survive and fight the Japanese were quite horrific but when we would bring our Japanese friends home and he would meet with them, I would worry that it would set him off.  But he accepted them.  And he told me that what happened back then was because of war and that Japan was now our ally.

So, I can understand Daniel's anger but I have to admit, the belligerence in the attitude of the character was insulting.  But that was the part that Guillory was to play.  A man who had to go to Japan, in his case, the last place he wanted to go to and get his son's paintings.

The other side of the equation is Noriko Kubo's situation and her family's honor.  Dishonoring her family because she married a Kokujin (a Black foreigner).  For me, I have known many women who have married men that were not Japanese and I have known friends who have had difficult situations because their father would not support a marriage to a non-Japanese.  And yes, even I had the same situation where a Japanese girl I was dating was forbidden to see me by her father because my ethnicity (I am Filipino American) was deemed not good enough for his daughter.  But because I studied and understood Japanese culture, I know the importance of family honor and unlike Mickey and Noriko who defied their parents and sought out after their own personal happiness together... unlike them, I was unable too because of my respect of her father's honor.

So, ""The Harimaya Bridge"" was a film that I felt was heartwarming, emotional but also a film that was very much needed today.  And I'm glad to see an African-American filmmaker, Aaron Woolfolk, doing just that.  I know a lot of friends who are Black and taught in Japan and how many get stereotyped as being someone like a basketball player or movie actor and it was interesting to see something like that in the film.  There were a lot of small things that I experienced or saw for myself, that I couldn't help but smile in the fact that Woolfolk incorporated those things into the film.

Woolfolk talked about his influences in his audio commentary.  Of how Akira Kurosawa and Yasujiro Ozu were influences of his and how he wanted to create a hybrid film that would be easily accessible to Japanese and non-Japanese and in many ways, I do feel that he accomplished it with this film.

But at the same time, I feel those who may have never went to Japan or understand Japanese culture may not understand those small little things that I found important.  But if you had a familiarity with the culture, especially if you had an understand of Japanese cinema, may you be a fan of a Kurosawa, Ozu, Naruse or Shimizu film, the storyline of family honor to the differences between modern vs. traditional family thinking applies to this film.

And I felt that Woolfolk did a good job of incorporating that to the film.

While Guillory did a fine job as the father of Mickey Holder, I also applaud the casting of Saki Takaoka who plays Noriko Kubo and also Misa Shimizu as Yuiko Hara.  Both of their performances were wonderful and also it was great to see other Japanese talent that I am familiar with in this film.  Especially pop star Misono getting her big break on this film as well.  And also, just a bonus for those who are familiar with the Japanese pop culture, to have legendary singer Kyu Sakamoto's wife/actress Yukiko Kashiwagi also in the film was pretty cool to see. And of course, having Danny Glover in the film is a bonus!  It was great to see him in this film but also believing in the film as one of the producers.

Overall, I have to admit that I am so grateful to Aaron Woolfolk for going forward and writing and directing a film such as ""The Harimaya Bridge"" to be made and also surprised and applaud FUNimation Entertainment for bringing this film to a wider audience.  The film is beautiful, vibrant, heartwarming but also painful and thought-provoking as well.

The film does seem like a Japanese film, especially in structure and what filmmaker Aaron Woolfolk wanted to communicate, but at the same time, its easily accessible to those who are not Japanese, especially those wanting to learn Japanese culture and those who have had similar experiences to the characters of this film.

I am so grateful to see this film as it mirrors the experiences that many of us who have embraced Japanese culture, despite being from another country.

""The Harimaya Bridge"" is highly recommended!",1323993600,9,9631,4.730053989202159
4659008,3,B005DEUEQ8,"Had never heard of this film, but I am so glad I decided to take a chance on it. It was a beautiful film and it was a cinematographic feast. I mean, I watched it a second time right away just to look at the beauty of the scenery. The story is quite an interesting one as well.",1321315200,,276,3.7758620689655173
4659009,5,B005DEUEQ8,"This movie 1st caught my attention when the local Japanese station (Channel 18.2 here in Southern CA) had commercials for its limited theater release in early 2010. This, being the 1st Japanese movie directed by a Black person quickly caught my eye as person of color myself.

Now that I'd seen it, I can say that The Harimaya Bridge is a very deep & emotional movie. It deals with issues that will limit its appeal to the American mainstream, but for those with an open mind, this is worth watching.

The movie's about Daniel Holder, a photographer with a strong hatred for the Japanese- mainly due to of the death of his father in a Japanese POW camp during WWII. But it wasn't just the death of his dad that created his hatred, but accounts of how he died. So when his son Mickey announced his plans to go there to teach English, father & son got into a heated debate which resulted in Daniel putting hands on his grown son. While living there, Mickey dies in an accident. Daniel later finds out while living there his son made some paintings & was married to Noriko, a Japanese woman who was at the funeral.  After going to a concert being given by a once distraught father who found solace in having his late daughter's compositions performed, Daniel decides to go to Japan to get his son's final paintings for the same propose. He ends up spending a great deal of the film searching for the mysterious Noriko who disappeared shortly after returning to Japan. Upon finally finding her, he finds out that his late son has left something much more valuable than just paintings. What that is...I'm not going to spoil it, but it changes Daniel's outlook & will force him to deal with his prejudices.

Although written & directed by a person of color, this movie is more Japanese than Western/Hollywood. It moves at a slow pace, but not in a boring way. Also most of the movie takes place in Kochi City, which is as far removed from Tokyo as you can get & is beautifully shot. Masao Nakabori, the film's cinematographer deserves credit for the great shots of rural Japan in a low budget picture.

Among the American actors, only Danny Glover is well known (although the main star Ben Guillory was also in ""The Color Purple"" with Glover) & he's in a minor role as Daniel's brother. The Japanese actresses on the other hand are the real stars here esp. Saki Takaoka (Noriko), & Misa Shimizu (Hara, Daniel's guide). They both steal the spotlight & are shown as real people, not caricatures as are in many Western movies about Japan. Jpop singer Misono (who sings the movie's closing theme) is also present, playing the happy-go lucky secretary with an obsession for American culture. She's kind of the comic relief in the movie who Daniel later hires as his translator as she eventually loses her job thanks to his behavior. Throughout the movie we're reminded that prejudice & discrimination aren't just over skin color or different racial backgrounds- Hara tells Daniel that she couldn't marry the man she loved because he comes from a family of Barakumin (someone who deals with dead bodies like executioners, coroners & undertakers). As the movie climaxes a Japanese voiceover explains the Harimaya Bridge which plays a big part of this picture, which has a forbidden love tale to it.

As for the home release, this is a DVD/Blue Ray combo pack, so you're getting two discs. Bonus features include the making of this movie as well as interviews with the main actors, the director & cinematographer, & some commentary from Woolfolk, who provides some info on the movie itself. It would have been great if the short films he did prior to making this were included. From what I can see, these features are on both disks. The only flaw I really see with this home release is the lack of subtitles outside the parts with spoken Japanese as it's hard to understand the Japanese actors at times.

For me, what I really enjoy about this film is seeing people of color in the international stage like Japan which you don't normally see in American movies. For his 1st full length feature, Aaron Woolfolk does a good job as director- it's something different from what's coming out of Hollywood & I also doubt Tyler Perry would try & make something like this. Yet despite the limited appeal this movie will have, it's still worth checking out. In fact, I'm so excited about ""The Harimaya Bridge"" that I'm telling everybody I know about this film!",1319328000,10,4437,4.659003831417625

8466732,5,B005DEUEQ8,"Even without knowing in advance that filmmaker Aaron Woolfolk was heavily inspired by the legendary director Akira Kurosawa, something about his debut feature THE HARIMAYA BRIDGE called to mind films by Kurosawa like DREAMS and RHAPSODY IN AUGUST. It's nothing on the surface of the movie that can be quickly interpreted or discerned. It's something much more subtle and nuanced that comes through in the very natural pacing of the story and the sensitive development of its characters. It also seems to come through in the deep level of attention that Woolfolk, like his cinematic inspiration, pays to the sumptuous rural settings chosen for this film that reflect the Japan of old through modern eyes -- as opposed to the country's more often seen urban environs. All this, however, isn't meant to say that THE HARIMAYA BRIDGE, Woolfolk's first feature, is a flawless masterpiece. It isn't. But it is a very masterful directorial debut that is often as visually stunning as it is emotionally stirring. With a fantastic cast that includes Ben Guillory, Saki Takaoka, Misa Shimizu and Danny Glover (also the film's producer), THE HARIMAYA BRIDGE is a densely layered portrait of the extended human family that touches on a complex variety of themes, including romantic and familial love, bigotry, loss, sorrow, discovery, tradition, and the unexpected bridges that can lead us to redemption and forgiveness.
