8274902,1,B0019NSWX4,"I wanted Split Second Starring Rutger Hauer which this DVD IS NOT!  Second the DVD I want with Rutger, Amazon is charging over $100 for a 1 hour and 30 minute DVD!  If you think in your wildest dreams I am paying that as much as I ;love Rutger, you are nuts!  I have Split Second and I did not get if\t from you and it did not cost $125!  I was able to get it from a friend.  Also anyone who believes this elephant film has Rutger Hauer in it is being Blind Sided!  Rutger Hauer fans, Split Second, the real one with our Rutger  is on You Tube for FREE to watch and enjoy!

DVD's should be cheap and available to all.  Don;t over pay when you can get the film for free on other venues!",1430956800,2,685,3.9057971014492754
8274903,1,B0019NSWX4,"The ""Split Second"" we all know and love is a Rutger Hauer science fiction flick.  This movie, also titled ""Split Second"" has a picture of an elephant on the cover and also has the words ""Fair Game"".  It sells for about $5.00 as well.  The product description is for the Rutger Hauer movie, and it lists all the reviews from the Rutger Hauer movie, but this is a completely different film.  It is a documentary on hunting African elephants.  Don't be misled.  It is not a cheap or bootleg copy of the Rutger Hauer flick.  It is the wrong movie regardless of the product description and reviews on the page.  I have notified Amazon they've posted this documentary incorrectly as the science fiction movie by Hauer.",1302912000,5,712,4.595238095238095
