8546596,5,B00512YMEC,"In my 51 year-old opinion, no funnier movie was ever made.  Why this is not available in DVD Region 1 (US / Canada) format is a mystery.  I guess the studio that produced it shamed Hollywood.. who knows?  But do try to see this film if you can appreciate British satire at all.  Stands up to multiple viewings due to Cockney accents... it's easy to miss a punch line the first time round.",1328572800,,388,4.273972602739726
