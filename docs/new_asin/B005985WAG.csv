8462878,4,B005985WAG,"This is a great addition to any You Can't Do That On Television fans collection. Image Gallery has commentary with photos from the event and I loved having the interviews from Lisa, Les, and Rodney.

My only complaint was that there was not enough footage from the Q and A sessions with actors and crew. I did find a lot of information on SlimeCon on their website and was hoping to get to see more interviews and video from the actual event. The Bonus features are very nice, but the main content seemed to be a little lacking.

Obviously, I missed both SlimeCons and would've loved to have been there and I was hoping to get to see a lot of the footage on this DVD. I still love YCDTOTV and hope that someday the series will be released on DVD. Until then, I will keep watching this DVD.",1321228800,,789,4.2885906040268456
8462879,4,B005985WAG,"Since the episodes aren't available anywhere, this doc is one of the few sources of information about the hit '80s kids' show ""You Can't Do That On Television"". The first half hour is a photo slide show that plays while the creators of SlimeCon discuss putting the event together on the audio track. After that, we're treated to on-camera interviews with the late Les Lye and one of the SlimeCon staff members. The remainder of the film consists of footage shot at SlimeCon of many original cast members interacting with an audience. There are fan interviews as well. The entire program then repeats with closed captions.",1318464000,4,621,4.867924528301887
