Everything is crystal clear as it should be and it has true natural sound and weight to it. And as a bonus, if you have an external USB blu-ray drive or a blu ray drive built into yor PC, there is a folder with the music that's downloadable to an external device.  The file is in three favors, mp3 @ 320kbps, FLAC @ 96khz/24bit, and one listed as 'for headphones only'. That's a nice touch to include such things!

So if you want that real Latin flavor and you want it in hi-def & hi Rez, look no further!  Highly recommended!",1398124800,,670,4.301587301587301
