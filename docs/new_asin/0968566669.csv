Since I do XC myself like a wildman, I know it's action-packed. But I haven't seen any movie images of the way it really is. Not for decades, anyway...Bill Koch had a neat little flick years ago, but, c'mon, we've been so thirsty for something like this! So, all I have to say is: FINALLY! Finally, a big chunk of our big sport hits the big screen, done right.
This movie has it all, with MTV pacing. Great skiing variety--cruising, racing, playing. And a fully-stoked soundtrack, with plenty of music variety, too.
It's great to see the celebration of the Soldier's Hollow course, where the Olympics are getting ready to start. It's the next best thing to being there!
I really liked the downhill bombin' on the long twisty pitch-changing runs. Down, down, down we go! There is some fine cornering going on, too. I love seeing them bustin some angulation to keep on course at 30mph.
It really let me know why I like racing so much. It's just so cool to get fully dialed in and then let it all hang out on a GREAT course!
My slogan: ""XC: Free ski! --Up, down, all around! Anywhere there's snow!""
XC is so much bigger than anyone has shown in media. Other forms of skiing are, I daresay, so limited for most people. This flick shows more of the fun than any other...and I hope there's more where it came from!
Thanks, XCZone! You're in a league of your own!",1013126400,,1400,4.409266409266409
