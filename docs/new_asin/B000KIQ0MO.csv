8157159,5,B000KIQ0MO,Great storyline! I'm disappointed in Joe Penny's character at the end. I look at him sideways when I see him on TV. I'll never forget this ending.,1381017600,,146,4.444444444444445
8157160,5,B000KIQ0MO,"Five stars for Melissa Gilbert and Joe Penny!  Melissa Gilbert is a shy, young fashion designer who meets handsome attorney Joe Penny who is from a Mafia family, unbeknownst to her in the beginning.  He tells her nothing of his family or his work, and she becomes frustrated.  Their courtship is very romantic and sexy, but the marriage becomes strained because of her fears and eventual knowledge of what she got herself into.  The acting on both parts is excellent, but the ending is sad.",1188777600,10,490,4.729411764705882
