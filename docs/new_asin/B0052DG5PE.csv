8453817,1,B0052DG5PE,"You actually don't have a star low enough to rate this sleezy B movie. I bought it for the scenery, but there are more ugly sky scrapers than jungle, and the rocks in the jungle are fake. Besides, you get the impression that the jaguar/tiger or whatever he was - and he was very pretty - is padding along in a green belt next to the highway. One of the worst things is that every time you put the disc back to play the movie, you have to listen to the same endless trailers about other grade B sleezy movies.",1431820800,,508,4.09
8453818,1,B0052DG5PE,I look at this movie and want to get it for some one as gift but wanted it in English version but unfortunately the way the seller put it up its hard to say if its English or Spanish version after buying it then I realised fully that its Spanish version instead of English am really dissapointed because I belief that its the sellers responsibility to describe fully their products for any potential buyer so now am stuck with Spanish version and the person whom I get it for doesnt speak Spanish so I will not recommended it to no one who is looking for English version because I sent an email to their customer service department concerning about this issue instead of helping me to solve this issue they were defending them self by telling me its Spanish version when I the real sense its not what the specs say.,1402012800,,815,4.403973509933775
