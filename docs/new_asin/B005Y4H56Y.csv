8489125,5,B005Y4H56Y,"I had a DVD for Romantic Christmas Fireside my friend saw it and he really wanted one, so I tried Amazon and they had one left and it had been reduced in price. I order for my friend he is enjoying it even if its not cold weather he says its relaxing. I sorry if you like this review this was the last one on order.",1462924800,,315,3.787878787878788
8489126,2,B005Y4H56Y,"The instrumental arrangements are very well done and sound very nice. I'm rating this DVD only two stars due to the low quality of the fireplace video. Three complaints about the video fire: 1) it's a gas fireplace rather than a wood fire; 2) the video quality is poor... certainly nothing close to even 720p HD... looks more like low-res video upscaled to 480p at best. The DVD case says ""originally filmed in HD""... well perhaps, but bad things happened to the video on its way to being on the DVD; and 3) the person shooting the video chose to zoom in on the fire rather than pull back and frame the shot with some room on all sides. The result on my 52"" TV is a log and fire that is 2x larger than real life. The photo of the back of the DVD case is exactly what you get. Imagine that on your wide-screen TV.

I can't recommend this package as a DVD.",1388016000,,854,4.175757575757576
8489127,5,B005Y4H56Y,We thoroughly enjoyed this on the big screen.  The grandkids love it and so much easier than building a messy fire.  Music is very nice.,1362787200,,136,4.4
8489128,2,B005Y4H56Y,"what i don't like about this dvd is that it features a gas fire instead of a real wood fire.  i want to see the log being consumed by the fire.  i want my fake fire to be real, not gas!  the audio is fine...jim brickman is good as always...it's just the video that's disappointing.",1355961600,4,281,4.072727272727272
8489129,5,B005Y4H56Y,"I just love this music! And, I love the fact that you can have a nice, crackling fire on your tv while you listen to the music. If you so choose, you can have just music, just fireplace, or both together. This will be nice to have playing while guests gather for Christmas! Just think....you can enjoy a fireplace without having to chop firewood and you can enjoy it all year long! (remember you have just the fireplace, no music option.) I highly recommend this dvd!",1323216000,,467,4.441860465116279
