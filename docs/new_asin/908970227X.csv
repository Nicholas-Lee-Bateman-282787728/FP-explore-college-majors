7901720,2,908970227X,"I'm not sure how the creator came up with the name ""Canyon landscapes"", but there is no canyon in this video.  Actually, there's not much of anything other than a gravel road.  As you walk down the road, you almost get to a ""view"", but the video ends and moves onto another segment, only to repeat the process... almost there, almost there, doh! next segment.  In the last segment, you catch a glimpse of the ocean, but you never get to see it.  Video quality is average and the music is irrelevant.  I recommend you add $3 to what you pay for this video and get the Virtual Active Canyon Hike video.  It's actually flimed in real canyons - like what you would expect for a canyon.",1365465600,3,681,4.322834645669292
7901721,5,908970227X,"The video quality looks very good on my Insignia 26"" flat panel television with resolution of 1366x768 as played on a standard DVD player.  I do not exercise with the video; I just use it as a decoration (like the fish tank or fireplace videos).  The background audio is basically superimposed birds chirping.  It doesn't necessarily sound like what you'd hear if you were in the desert canyons, but I guess it's there if you want it.",1358899200,3,434,4.6103896103896105
