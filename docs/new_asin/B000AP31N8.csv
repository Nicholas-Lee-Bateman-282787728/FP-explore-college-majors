2390381,4,B000AP31N8,I'M NOT MUCH FOR BUGS BUT THESE WERE CUTE ONES. THE STORY IS SIMILAR TO THE GRINCH BUT WITH MORE OF A CHRISTIAN POINT OF VIEW. THIS IS CUTE FOR SMALL CHILDREN AND ADULTS WATCHING IT WITH THEM WON'T BE BORED. I ALSO LOVED THE VOICES.,1358208000,,232,4.065217391304348
2390382,5,B000AP31N8,This video is very entertaining and instructive. After several viewings it still captures my two girls attention. I feel good knowing they won't be hearing or seeing suggestive or adult content. The voices of Ensign Parker & Barney Fife brings a smile to my face.,1323216000,,263,4.866666666666666
2390383,5,B000AP31N8,"We love all the Hermie series DVDs!! We usually get them at the local Christian bookstore, but sometimes money and time are of short supply so I looked on Amazon, and lo and behold, they have a great selection of Max Lucado's wonderful series for children. This Fruitcake Christmas is now a favorite of my girls and I and we will watch it over and over each Christmas and many times in between. I recommend ALL the Hermie and Friends' videos.",1265155200,,442,4.469135802469136
2390384,4,B000AP31N8,"We bought this for one of our daughter a couple years ago, the message of this movie is good, and my daughters like it, it gives them an understanding what Christmas is really about, and it teaches them to share also.",1219190400,,217,4.317073170731708
2390385,5,B000AP31N8,We love all the Hermie and Friends movies and this is no exception. They are all great family fun and teach an important lesson. My 7 year old wants to own the whole collection.,1204502400,,177,4.235294117647059
2390386,5,B000AP31N8,"This is a beautiful story about the true meaning of Christmas.  The story is told with a healthy does of humor, and my whole family enjoys it.
This series is the best, and I definitely recommend this Chrismas DVD.",1190160000,,213,4.461538461538462
2390387,5,B000AP31N8,"We've yet to be disappointed by Hermie and Wormie. Our girls, and all of their friends are quite entertained by the group of insects. The animation is incredible. We'll be adding more of Hermie and Wormie to our collection!",1177804800,2,223,4.743589743589744
2390388,5,B000AP31N8,"The Hermie and Friends videos are all wonderfully animated, humorous, and enlightening.  Each video contains timeless Biblical truths that will resonate with even the youngest viewers.

In Fruitcake Christmas, the bugs learn the true message of Christmas with Christ squarely at the center.  Parents and children alike will benefit from seeing beyond the gifts and festivities that surround our modern-day Christmas frenzy and understand what true giving is all about.  Parents will enjoy the movie along with the kids as plenty of references to popular Christmas classics are eluded to such as Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol and others like the Grinch Who Stole Christmas, Rudolph and more.

The sing-a-longs are delightful and with the '12 Bugs of Christmas,' you might catch yourself singing 5 Ants that sing, rather than '5 Golden Rings' to a popular Christmas carol!",1171843200,5,875,5.311594202898551
2390389,5,B000AP31N8,"Excellent movie! I don't know who enjoys watching it more, my children or me!",1163289600,,77,4.571428571428571
2390390,5,B000AP31N8,"Probably the sweetest of all the Hermie videos, this one truly captures the meaning of Christmas.  Many other Christmas videos shy away from the Christ in CHRISTmas, but this one is straight forward.  It even parodies many of the other Christmas videos, with subtle references to Rudolph, Charlie Brown, Frosty, and others.  Watch carefully!  And Rick and Bubba - what fantastic additions to the Hermie world.",1130284800,10,409,5.151515151515151

8079030,5,B000AP31N8,"Fruitcake and coachroaches.  This one is a frist for me. The bad guys are the roaches, who steal the fruitcake.  But they learn a priceless lesson, Christmas is about a Savior, being with family to share Christmas and praise God for giving us (the world) his son Jesus Christ.  Like I said, this is a frist for me, BUT I liked it.  Thank You and God Bless You Amazon.  Love, Georgia",1420675200,,382,4.323943661971831

8079036,5,B000AP31N8,"What cute characters and better yet a series that gives all glory to the only GOD WHO IS THE FATHER, THE SON & THE HOLY GHOST (Isaiah 7:14, 9:6 & 1 John 5:7)
