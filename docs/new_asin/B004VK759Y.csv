4482756,5,B004VK759Y,Really enjoyed this series when it was on TV on the mystery movies of the week. I have other seasons of this show as well and enjoy them all. Thanks,1361404800,,148,3.966666666666667
4482757,2,B004VK759Y,"IMHO compared to other made for TV DVD the quality of the video is not that good. In fact on one DVD there was a warning about video being from historical...The quality is better than off the air recordings. The images are a little fuzzy - not that crisp. There are artifacts which indicates DVDs were not cut from the original.

The first episode on each disk has opening for NBC Sunday night movies which advertises Columbo, Hec Ramsey, McCloud, as well as McMillan... In other words there are two episodes per disk.

The above comments applies to SERIES FIVE as well (since 5 has 7 episodes the 4th disk has only one episode).

All said, it's better than not having any video.",1358467200,,679,4.504065040650406

4482760,5,B004VK759Y,"I suppose if you were not a Mystery Movie fan, it would be the same old stuff, but I enjoyed all those and especially this part of the series with Rock Hudson.",1331942400,,159,4.0
4482761,2,B004VK759Y,"Since my wife is hearing impaired, I was very disappointed since I had purchased this DVD for her.  I think Amazon should make it more obvious with a note when a movie or TV program is not closed captioned.",1320883200,3,206,4.282051282051282
4482762,5,B004VK759Y,"I Have not been able to watch this season yet, but I intend to watch every season except six. The show was depressing without St. James as the wife. I wish the studio couldve work things out with her contract then i would have purchased the rest. Its like watching the Lucy Show without Lucy.",1318896000,,292,4.327272727272727
4482763,3,B004VK759Y,"Yes, Sally was Pregnant in this season and then there was the mention of a baby in one episode and he was never seen...then, all of a sudden, the episodes continued with no baby anywhere. No Mention, no siting, nothing...while I love this show, its lack of logic puzzles me. I wonder why the producers did it? Anyone who knows, please advise. Thanks!",1303344000,17,350,4.571428571428571
4482764,5,B004VK759Y,"Following on the heels of the previous season box sets of ""McMillan and Wife"" that have sold in huge quantities comes ""McMillan and Wife: Season 4"". The series about a San Francisco police commisioner who solves crimes alongside his beautiful wife starred movie great Rock Hudson and Susan Saint James and ran for a total of six seasons. Saint James was absent from the final year due to a contract dispute when the actress wanted more money. The series was retitlted simply ""McMillan"" and due to terrible ratings ultimately cancelled.

 Season four was the year Sally became pregnant. This set contains 6 telefilms running around 90 minutes each. There are no bonus features.

 The following is a list of season 4's episodes along with their airdates.

1. ""Downshift to Danger"", Sept. 29, 1974
2. ""The Game of Survival"", Oct. 20, 1974
3. ""Buried Alive"", Nov. 10, 1974
4. ""Guilty By Association"", Dec. 8, 1974
5. ""Night Train To L.A."", Jan. 19, 1975
6. ""Love, Honor, and Swindle"", Feb. 16, 1975",1302566400,24,994,4.823529411764706
4482765,5,B004VK759Y,what a great show i like the old tv shows i wish they still made them like they used to,1400889600,,87,3.4
4482766,5,B004VK759Y,"I love the old McMillan & Wife series; so enjoyed receiving this season.  However, I had a problem with the discs as they would not play in two of my machines, and had to return them for replacement.",1400025600,,199,4.2368421052631575
4482767,5,B004VK759Y,McMillan and Wife is a fun show. It's a mix of a mystery in solving a crime and a romance comedy. Rock Hudson and Susan St. James were a perfect couple for this show!,1398297600,,166,3.911764705882353
4482768,4,B004VK759Y,"An original component of NBC's Mystery Movie lineup, McMillan and Wife features Rock Hudson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ice-Station-Zebra/dp/B008B4KVS8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ice Station Zebra</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Giant/dp/B0007US7FI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Giant</a>) as San Francisco Police Commissioner Stuart `Mac' McMillan, and Susan Saint James (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kate-And-Allie/dp/B003476UIW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kate And Allie</a>), as his wife and crime-solving partner, Sally.  The big development in season four (1974-75), is that due to the pregnancy of Susan Saint James, Sally is also pregnant for five of the six episodes.  In the season finale it is intimated that Sally has given birth to a son, who strangely, is never seen in the remainder of the series.

Sally's pregnancy doesn't keep her from taking a very active role, particularly early on, as she seems to be more involved, than in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/season-three/dp/B004HHX9PK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">season three</a>.  The slightly goofy sergeant Charles Enright (John Schuck) remains Mac's right hand man, and crusty housekeeper Mildred (Nancy Walker), is never shy about offering her opinions.  Mixing romance, mystery, humor, and action, and featuring a solid list of guest stars, McMillan and Wife maintains its appeal for mystery lovers, with more unusual and exciting adventures.  All six episodes are two hour productions, with a runtime of about 98 minutes each.

The McMillan's are one of several teams participating in a rally race, in ""Downshift To Danger"".  Unfortunately, someone is sabotaging the vehicles, and putting the racers at risk. (Rating: 3 stars)

""The Game of Survival"" is a more straightforward whodunit, where a newspaper tycoon is murdered, and a tennis player who is a friend of Sally's, is the prime suspect. (Rating: 4 stars)

""Buried Alive"", is a cloak and dagger affair, where Mac's past history in military intelligence is featured again, as a former comrade is murdered, and Mac's ex-commander unexpectedly appears on the scene.  This one is complicated, and a little too clever.  The pieces that don't quite fit, but it is still better than average.  (Rating: 3.5 stars)

While serving on a jury, Mildred is attacked, and another juror is murdered in ""Guilt By Association"".  Sally often wore a red football jersey with the number 18, as a nightgown.  In the mid 70's, Gene Washington, presently an executive with the NFL, was a star receiver for the 49ers, and wore the number 18.  Washington also had an interest in acting, and he appears in this episode, as a football player suspected of murder.  With a lot happening, Mac has to work extra hard to solve this complicated case. (Rating: 3.5 stars)

In ""Night Train to L.A., the obnoxious author of a book about crooked cops, becomes a homicide victim, while travelling on a train loaded with cops.  Mac, Mildred, and Enright, are also part of the group, who were bound for a convention in Los Angeles.  Set on a train, the story is a little slow moving, and doesn't play fair with the viewer.  (Rating: 3 stars)

In ""Love, Honor, And Swindle"", Sally has given birth to a son (who will never be seen).  Mac's mother (Mildred Natwick) arrives in town, with the news that her daughter (Gretchen Corbett), is getting married to man (David Birney) who might be a thief.  As Mac prepares for his sister's wedding, a complicated mystery emerges. (Rating: 4 stars)

Season Four is notable for Sally's pregnancy.  While the writers keep her well out of harm's way, Susan Saint James is still prominently involved in the first four episodes.  The romance between the couple remains, but it is toned down.  Despite the challenges, Season Four is probably one of the stronger in the series.

Due to some issues with the quality of the source material, image quality is soft in places.  Unfortunately, the episodes are not subtitled, and like the previous seasons, there are no bonus features.  While not perfect, fans of this classic series should appreciate that it is available on DVD, and also that the set has come down in price since its initial release.  In comparison, the series McCloud has not fared as well, as at this time, seasons three through seven are only available on Region 2 DVD.",1374883200,2,4473,5.559822747415066

4482772,5,B004VK759Y,"Great. Found out ""Wife"" and housekeeper left after the fifth season, so also purchased that, but no more. Too bad Rock had to be the way he was as well as the show's producers and not give ""Wife"" what she wanted. They goofed.",1364860800,,225,4.255813953488372
4482773,1,B004VK759Y,"I was looking forward to seeing the episode, ""Night Train to LA.""  What I got to see was nothing but blackness even with the DVD player at max brightness.  It was so frustrating not being able to distinguish anyone or anything going on in most of the night shots both inside and outside of the train.  The lighting was terrible - dark was pitch dark; no effort was made to illuminate the scenes enough so you could at least see what was happening, what the characters were doing, where they were headed, or even know who the action was focused on. It's a very intriguing episode - too bad you can't see it to enjoy it.",1364688000,,618,4.310344827586207
4482774,5,B004VK759Y,"I read that Rock Hudson wasn't too thrilled with this series but it sure doesn't show in his wry, sly portrayal of police commissioner Stuart McMillan. He was truly a superb comedian and even though this is a mystery, his sense of humor comes through. I wanted to be Sally McMillan when I was 12 and planned to wear a football jersey and hoop earrings to bed when I married someone like Stuart McMillan. This is a fun show that is far superior to television today!",1361491200,8,464,4.406976744186046
8443461,5,B004VK759Y,great husband and wife mystery tv show. Funny show. Both actors play well off of each other. Some episodes are better than others.  Highly recommend for mystery buffs. Great way to spend a rainy day.,1527724800,,199,4.685714285714286
8443462,5,B004VK759Y,"I remember watching this program with my parents when I was a child but am able to appreciate it far more by rediscovering it as an adult. It is a wonderfully engaging show and offers real entertainment value for its cost. The best thing about it, in my opinion, is the talent of its lead actors, Rock Hudson and Susan St. James, who have a wonderful chemistry as Police Commissioner Stewart McMillan and wife, Sally. Hudson's deft handling of drama and comedic content alike are a treat to behold and he is very likeable with his soft voice and commanding presence. The lovely Susan St. James is an absolute delight and makes one understand why the show didn't last long once she departed. Her Sally McMillan is one of the most engaging and likeable female characters of the last forty years of television and she and Hudson play so well off one another.

In McMillan & Wife, the talented Nancy Walker and John Schuck enhance this already delightful dish with their wonderful talents -- she of the acerbic wit and he of the lovingly bumbling humor.

Moreover, for anyone who remembers the 70s or who merely finds that era interesting, this show is a fun, frolicking time machine showcasing the clothes, cars, and hairstyles of that decade. Sally's adorable wardrobe and 70s style alone will probably be a draw for any woman, who will want to raid her closet for those fun retro styles!

All in all this is a very entertaining show and, I think, a great addition to anyone's home viewing library.",1474761600,,1496,4.659090909090909
