8689126,1,B00PT6NMHS,"This is not a Digitally Remastered version of this film. It looks terrible and sounds worse. The DVD menu literally only has a ""play"" button (it's a DVD-R film). Also, this DVD abruptly stops mid-scene (chapter 14 of the DVD) where Joy Bang is trapped in the movie theater with zombies. She literally runs to the check the second door and the film stops and goes back to the menu. After checking the DVD, there are only 14 chapters on the DVD and so that the was the entirety of the film on this DVD. This was not a damaged disc...it was faulty making of the DVD. Beware purchasing it. Hope some of you got the film if you ordered this exact DVD, but I sure didn't.",1529280000,,665,4.244094488188976

8689128,1,B00PT6NMHS,"Not a bad film, what I saw of it. The disc was defective, totally shut down half way through and returned to home screen. Deep Discount made the return process so one sided that it wasn't worth the trouble. I got burned. The movie is worth digging, just beware who you buy from.",1509408000,,278,4.264150943396227
8689129,1,B00PT6NMHS,"This is a great film, but this Mutant Sorority Pictures release is GARBAGE.  It is NOT digitally remastered.  It looks like garbage.  It's in full screen format.  The cherry on top is that IT DOESN'T EVEN CONTAIN THE WHOLE FILM!!!  It stops about an hour into it (it's supposed to be 90 mins).  This garbage shouldn't be allowed to be sold. DO NOT BUY.",1501286400,3,352,4.421875
8689130,1,B00PT6NMHS,"Terrible quality. No hint at being ""Digitally Remastered"". Sound and Picture worse than VHS. Should never be allowed to be sold on Amazon. great shame since the movie is of interest to many horror film buffs. A travesty of a presentation. Be warned!",1472688000,9,249,4.813953488372093
8689131,5,B00PT6NMHS,"This is one of the few times I have found a horror movie that was not cheesey and hard to look at.  Usually the story line is not there at all.  Most horror movies are low budget porn.  The characters are so annoying, you want to get up and just not spend time with them.  This movie is artsy and it has a great story line.  The fact that is is entertaining is shocking considering the theme.  But it rocks.  LOVE IT.  This I can respect.",1468454400,,438,4.011627906976744

8689133,1,B00PT6NMHS,"Received the alleged digitally remastered dvd today lol.
Amazon - THIS IS NOT REMASTERED!!
I can copy homemade VHS recordings to DVD better than this!
Nor did I receive a complete film - Stopped at 1 hour & 1 min.
Amazon & this distributor should be taken to trading standards.
Will be seeking a full refund.",1429056000,7,308,4.517857142857143
8689134,4,B00PT6NMHS,"Released in 1973, ""Messiah of Evil"" is an American film. The title is misleading; the movie was originally called ""Dead People,"" which is more fitting.

THE PLOT: A woman (Marianna Hill) goes to the California coastal town of Point Dune to visit her artist father. She can't find him, but runs into a guy (Michael Greer) and his two female companions (Anitra Ford & Joy Bang). They all soon discover that there are mysterious and peculiar things going on in town: The people are somnambulistic and mysteriously stand at the shore every twilight looking out to sea. Things eventually take a deadly turn.

The film has a haunting ambiance, effectively combining elements of ""Carnival of Souls"" (1962) and ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1968). It's on par with ""Carnival"" but not great like ""Night,"" a classic horror masterpiece.

As noted above, Marianna Hill is the doe-eyed protagonist. You may not remember her, but she's one of the most beautiful women to ever appear on the Original Series of Star Trek, specifically the episode ""Dagger of the the Mind"" as Dr. Helen Noel. The film is a must for fans of Ms. Hill (like me) since she is prominently featured.

The title ""Messiah of Evil"" is too generic and gives the impression that the story prominently features a weirdo dark Christ-figure, but this is hardly the case. The dark messiah is ambiguous and barely featured. A more fitting title would be ""Village of the Dead"" or something to this effect.

BOTTOM LINE: Many hail this as a moody horror masterpiece from the early 70s. It has a few highlights and is mandatory viewing for 60s-70s mystery/horror aficionados and admirers of the lovely Marianna Hill. Unfortunately, it's actually kind of boring and the whole ""dark messiah"" side of the story is seriously insubstantial.

The film runs 90 minutes and was shot in Malibu, Burbank, Anaheim, Melrose, Venice and Echo Park, California.

GRADE: C+ or B-",1425254400,6,1908,4.8885448916408665
8689135,1,B00PT6NMHS,No stars for good reason but couldn't submit without any stars. Ordered twice and never got the full 90 minute movie. 1 hour the 1st time. 1 hour 1 minute the 2nd time. Will not give a 3rd try. Be cautious when ordering.,1422403200,7,220,4.1395348837209305
