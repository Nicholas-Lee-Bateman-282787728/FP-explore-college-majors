8233174,4,B000YJS3ME,"The history of Warrior Queen Boudica begins 40AD with Romes humiliation and plunder of her tribe the Iceni, after her husband Chief Prasutagus death.

Twenty years later events move quickly: a neighbouring tribal alliance; destruction of the druids' religious base in the north-west by General Seutonius, Boudicas razing of Camulodunum, Londinium and Verulamium; final confrontation with Rome and total defeat of the Britons.

The struggle was always between numbers and wild tactics of the Britons, and Rome's iron-disciplined killing machine, so aptly prophesied by Daniel in chapter seven verse seven of his book, [I] sawand behold a fourth beaststrong exceeding; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and break in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it.

In the final confrontation Tacitus records the Romans killed 80,000 with the loss of only 400, their saw-toothed iron formation creating a charnel house.

Expert commentary, geographical animations and acting make for great educational value.",1465084800,,1017,5.5
8233175,3,B000YJS3ME,I liked this historical work about Queen Boudica. There is a little more information out there on the net about her but I enjoy History Channel so am glad to have this dvd in my library.,1376265600,,186,4.194444444444445
8233176,5,B000YJS3ME,"""Warrior Queen Boudica"" is an excellent documentary!  I knew very little about Boudica before watching this DVD and I had very little interest in her.  I am interested in the Roman army which was why I bought this video.  The History Channel went all out making this video very authentic with the costumes and the actors they chose for Suetonius Paulinus and Boudica were perfect.  The Romans spoke Latin (with English subtitles) which made it even more authentic.  They did not cut corners. The historians were fascinating and really brought to life the high stakes that were involved for both the British and the Romans.  The one historian said, ""Suetonius knew he could not possibly go back to Rome being defeated.  He knew that he would win or die this day, and every soldier there knew that too.""  The descriptions of the battle tactics and the choosing of the battle site were very informative.  This is a documentary that is very solid historically, yet is as enjoyable to watch as a movie. ""Warrior Queen Boudica"" is a DVD that you will really enjoy watching.  It is well worth the money.",1326240000,7,1096,4.721052631578948
8233177,5,B000YJS3ME,"Watch this inspiring but sad documentary about how the forgetten Queen of Iceni, UK. Boudica was her name. This documentary shows her rise to fame in ancient Roman history books as a rebel leader whose ragtag tribal armies once drove fear into the invading Roman legions.

King Prasutagus was her husband who lived in peace with the invading Romans of ancient Britain. However, after his death, his Iceni tribe was brutally ravaged by the Romans who humiliated and beat Queen Boudica in front of her people and gravely dishonored her daughters. Breeming vengeance and wanting justice, Boudica sought to unite other tribes in her eastern regions against the Romans. Since everyone was tired of Roman brutality, the tribes united and fought under the banner of Boudica.
They crushed one small Roman legion and attacked Roman settlements including London commercial center, slaughtering everyone there and razing everything to the ground. The fire was so hot that charred remains can be seen to this present day in cities where Boudica's armies destroyed. Drunk high on victory and never anticipating the might of Roman military superiority, Boudica's tribal armies, though great in number, were of no match to the 2 remaining legions who stood united against them. The decisive final battle somewhere in central UK saw the military victory of 2 Roman legions and how they cornered and walled the freedom-fighting rebels into a field of carnage and massacre.

Sad ending to this story. No one knows where Boudica and her 2 daughters disappeared into at the end. Sad to see Boudica being defeated!

RIP Boudica!

Boudica's name and story are hardly remembered today, but back in ancient times, she stood out as a symbol of freedom from Roman oppression. To the Romans, she was one of the most daring and successful rebel leaders ever to rise up against their invading Empire.",1258156800,5,1871,5.0453074433656955
