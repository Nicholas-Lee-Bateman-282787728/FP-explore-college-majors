5130948,5,B0084IHVUC,"Eva Gabor, the woman who did the voice of the female mouse is my fave woman actor. I just adore Eva's accent. What I like about these movies is; the music, comedy, classic Disney magic, charm, and the heart in it. These movies i feel are timeless and a great family film for all. Perfect for all ages of Disney lovers! My fave of these two movies is the second. I like the Aussie theme and it just never seems to get old to me. Plus, this movie is just so sweet. Like where Bernard was trying to porpoise to Bianca. My fave scene in the second movie, was the part where the mouse substitutes the rocks for the eagle eggs. It's sad that they just don't make movies like this anymore. This movie is definitely worth watching. I'm trying to get up the be one of the top 1000 reviews. So please before you dislike this just tell me what you don't like below so that I can get better. Thanks for reading and God bless you.",1338681600,15,917,4.157303370786517

5130971,2,B0084IHVUC,"Rescuers (1977) is one of the worst Disney films I have ever seen.  The story is predictable.

Bob Newhart is particularly bad.

Zsa Zsa Gabor is very good & makes the film watchable.

Geraldine Page is good as the villain.

Michele Stacy as the orphan is almost unbearable.

The worst crocodiles, Nero & Claudius (?)proved good commit relief",1518912000,,342,4.810344827586207

The first Rescuers was made during the golden age of cel animation, it is BEAUTIFUL and the story is delightful of course, classic Disney. But the sequel was made at the dawn of computer animation (and it sticks out like a sore thumb as it does in the animated Beauty and The Beast and Aladdin), and is still beautiful in its own right, not as brilliant to look at as the full cel animation in my humble opinion, but the story is fantastic, the characters are hilarious, the villain is a classic Disney villain and there's no singing-which is a big deal...for me.",1501718400,,694,4.4296875

The original film is pretty lethargically paced, though it features some fun characters and good voice work. However ""Down Under"" upped the game on every level. The setting is more exciting, the side characters are much more enjoyable, the kid is resourceful as opposed to just being a whiny moppet, and everything that worked the first time (Bianca, Bernard and a strong villain) still works.

Happy endings all around, even for Rufus the spectacle-wearing cat.  Rescuers Down Under is good too.

5131357,3,B0084IHVUC,"Wow. This is definitely R rated. Or should be. Cruella De'Vill is a horrid, evil fiend. Like a demonic c---. And the violence and the screaming and the yelling and the cruelty... it's just weird nowadays. Even creepy. NOT FOR KIDS. The writers take a couple of shots at the NRA, which is repulsive to me to put that in a ""kids"" movie. I added some pics. They only works in the context of the dialogue in the movie.

The animation is amazing and you will instantly fall in love with ""Evinrude"". He's the the outboard motor on the mouses boat (a leaf). Totally cool. The swamp creatures are cool. Again, this movie plays the whole cultural stereotype. There's this family of swamp rants and one is a drunk. His wife calls him a 'cracka' (sounds like 'craker'). You will need to make yourself less ignorant on this word to get to the context (the etymology is at the link below)

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Walt Disney animators had consciously set out to produce a pair of animation films showing the before-and-after effects of digital technology on animation, they hardly could have produced more of a perfect presentation than The Rescuers [1977] and The Rescuers Down Under [1990] and the two animation films, made just 13 years apart, and the concentration on the same two protagonists responding to a pair of similar situations, are nonetheless radically different in practically every aspect of visual design and approach. And the shifts extend past the construction methods: Seen side-by-side in the new Blu-ray and DVD double release of the The Rescuers 35th Anniversary and The Rescuers Down Under and they are a clear-cut portrait of Traditional Walt Disney vs. the Walt Disney Renaissance.

Both animation films are loosely based on the author Margery Sharps Rescuers books, and both star Eva Gabor and Bob Newhart as a pair of mice whose international aid group helps people in need, a sort of mouse-specific shadow United Nations, based in the UN headquarters itself. In the first animation film The Rescuers we have Hungarian diplomat Miss Bianca [Eva Gabor] and clumsy American janitor Bernard [Bob Newhart] accept a mission to track down and assist an orphan girl named Penny, who was kidnapped by half-mad, all-evil pawnbroker Madame Medusa and is being used to explore a dangerous cave system in search of a gigantic diamond. In the second animation film The Rescuers Down Under we get to see Miss Bianca and Bernard head to Australia to rescue a boy named Cody [Adam Ryen] who was kidnapped by surly nasty evil poacher McLeach [George C. Scott] after catching McLeach in the act of his diabolical schemes. Along the way, the mice join forces with a local kangaroo mouse [Tristan Rogers] and help rescue an immense golden eagle.

The Rescuers was one of the last of Walt Disneys traditional cell-animation department. When it was produced, three of the studios long-time core animators entitled the nine old men, as Walt Disney himself called them. The three who worked as key animators on The Rescuers were Milt Kahl, Frank Thomas, and Ollie Johnson and all had retired after the animation film had been finished. The animation film served as a training ground for up-and-comers, including Don Bluth and Glen Keane, and as a testing ground for a new xerographic process that let animators transfer coloured lines to animated cells, instead of the black lines that were previously standard. But the new process doesnt always work as well; the thick, fuzzy grey lines around the animated characters often make them stand out starkly from the painted backgrounds. Some of the animation is noticeably recycled throughout the animation film, or brought in from past Walt Disney features. While The Rescuers is at times a showcase for marvellously expressive art, especially in Milt Kahls design for Madame Medusa, a sloppy, flailing disaster of a woman with a shapeless bust hanging to her waist and a face like a half-empty bag.

Contrast this with The Rescuers Down Under, here we have the Disney Siudios first wholly digital film. While The Little Mermaid was the first animated feature to use Disneys proprietary CAPS (Computer Animation Production System) software in a limited capacity, The Rescuers Down Under used it throughout, with animators building entirely digital backgrounds, drawing, painting, and assembling images entirely via the computer. The technique allowed for finer lines, more graduated shading, richer shadows, sharper contrast, and an integration between planes that sadly The Rescuers lacked. It is a gorgeous, visually ambitious film, full of show-off set pieces reportedly inspired by the work of Hayao Miyazaki.

Both animation films have their ultimate rewards. The Rescuers has a much more personal charm than its sequel, particularly in the quirky, prickly characters. The animation film has a real sense of menace and malice, particularly in Madame Medusas casually sadistic treatment of Penny, and the authentically frightening scene where Penny is trapped in a flooding cavern with Madame Medusa threatening her from above. The Rescuers Down Under, meanwhile, has a vast sense of space and a rich field of colour; which sadly flopped at the box office, with reviewers grumbling that Walt Disney Studio had abandoned its musical heritage by dropping any pretence of songs, and that the story was slightly bland. But the animation film remains an animators showcase, visually impressive even by todays standard. And both animation films have memorable nasty villains, with McLeachs muttering dark humour and Madame Medusas thrilling Cruella De Vil wildness and both looking particularly frightening when placed next to a vulnerable child. (One early script treatment for the first Rescuers called for Madame Medusa to be in similar vein of Cruella De Vil; the idea was ultimately scrapped, but its easy to see the influence in her big gestures and expressive talk and in the fact that they drive the same garish roadster in the same barely controlled fashion.)

Both animation films have sadly their failings as well. The Rescuers is mightily treacly in spots, relying heavily on a gap-toothed, lisping, frequently crying wide-eyed orphan to deliver pathos by the bucket load. The periodic songs are an awkward mixture, with a Disney sing-along show tune, a sad ballad, and a wispy 70s easy-listening number all jostling for space. The animation film makes heavy use of grainy painted backgrounds, opening with a series of impressionistic still-frames in which the texture of the painted surfaces stands out more than the colour. And it spends a surprising amount of time on hick jokes and dead-end bits of narrative business, as when Miss Bianca and Bernard try to take a shortcut through a rainy zoo and get scared off by lion noises. The Rescuers Down Under, meanwhile, swaps The Rescuers surly albatross pilot, Orville (voiced by old-time radio star Jim Jordan), for a louder, jokey version named Wilbur, voiced by John Candy and designed as the butt of endless aggressive physical gags. The Rescuers Down Under also builds an entire storyline around Cody meeting and befriending a group of animals imprisoned in McLeachs lair and then the film forgets them entirely, whisking the protagonists off to adventure and thoughtlessly leaving a group of highly individualised, compelling characters alone in the dark to die.

But from the outset, the individual experience, the two animation films are most fascinating to look at a company in the process of reinventing itself. In just 13 years, Walt Disney Studio went from showcasing sentiment and heartstring-plucking emotion to pushing high-flying adventure. It dropped the songs and the wistfulness, polished up the colour, and poured on the spectacle and the big, broad gags. To some degree, it stopped aiming so obviously at the heart, and aimed more directly at the adrenal glands. And in the process, it became a company more directly prepared for the 21st century of film. Both Rescuers animation films stand as historical pieces, but they have the most to say when viewed in direct comparison, especially for the whole family.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The Rescuers and The Rescuers Down Under have both been framed in a respectful aspect ratio of 1.66:1 and is presented in a brilliant 1080p encoded transfer. Unlike many of these Walt Disney Studio classics brought to the Blu-ray format, and there is an occasional dust speckle can be seen occasionally, and sharpness is not always top notch in every shot. The lines are solid and consistent with no artefacts and no banding was noticed at all. Colours are beautifully controlled throughout both animation films.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The Rescuers and The Rescuers Down Under 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 sound mix is very much an audio track of its era with most of the audio spread across the front channels and very little seeping into the rears apart from occasional echoes of songs or the background scores by Artie Butler and Bruce Broughtons background score with both animation films. The Rescuers Down Under surround channel gets a very nice workout from the McLeachs huge tractor, he uses to terrorise his victims. The dialogue is always very clear and precise and has been placed in the centre channel, but there are a couple of instances of directional dialogue.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Peoplitis [The Deleted Song] [1080p] [1.77:1] [4:30] Ron Clements [Animator] introduces us to something he was involved with in The Rescuers in 1974 and using storyboards, and tells us the particular song was composed by Floyd Huddleston and also explains the concept of Peoplitis, which unfortunately was deleted. The singing artists includes Louis Prima, Sam Pitera and The Witnesses, who were in The Jungle Book and to me Peoplitis is very similar in style to I Wanna Be Like You and see if you agree with me?

Special Feature: Silly Symphony Animated Short: Three Blind Mouseketeers [1936] [480i] [1.33:1] [8:45] The three blind mice are musketeers that live in a cellar. Captain Katt [Billy Bletcher] (the devious cat) sets a number of traps for them and goes to sleep. Then the musketeers come out to search for food evading all the clutches. The cat eventually wakes up and begins chasing them, but they escape thanks to their teamwork. There is a slight mistake with the animation, where at one point Captain Katts eye patch appears on his right eye.

Special Feature: Walt Disney True-Life Adventure: Water Birds [1952] [1080p] [1.33:1] [3:40] Water Birds is a 1952 American short documentary film directed by Ben Sharpsteen. It won an Academy Award in 1953 for Best Short Subject (Two-Reel). The film was produced by Walt Disney as part of the True-Life Adventures series of nature documentaries. It was shot in Technicolor by more than a dozen cameramen and was created in cooperation with the National Audubon Society and the Denver Museum of Natural History. What we get to view is as always a very professional presentation, that the Walt Disney Studio always excels in and we get to hear a lot of interesting information about the Water Birds, especially of all the feathered variety.

Special Feature: Walt Disney Sing-Along Song: Someones Waiting for You [1977] [1080p] [1.66:1] [2:12] Here we get a selection of images from The Rescuers with a specific female artist [unknown] singing the song. What you get is yellow subtitles at the bottom of the screen, so you can sing-along with the song. I suspect younger audience will demand to sing this song loads of times, to the annoyance to their parents.

Special Feature Documentary: The Making of The Rescuers Down Under [1990] [480i] [1.33:1] 10:32] Thomas Schumacher [Producer]; Michael Gabriel [Director]; Maurice Hunt [Art Director]; Hendel Butoy [Director]; Kathy Zeilinkski [Supervising Animator] and Ruben Aquino [Supervising Animator] talk extensively about the two year production in bringing this animation film to the silver screen. You get to see the crew with their research trip to Australia and trips to the San Diego Zoo to watch real animals in motion and to draw them, so to bring them to life in The Rescuers Down Under.

Special Feature: Learn How To Take Your Favourite Movie On The Go: Disney Digital Copy [1080p] [1.77:1] [1:02]

Special Feature: Discover Blu-ray 3D With Timon & Puba [1080p] [1.77:1 [4:23] Of course this will not be seen in 3D, it is just an amusing video promotion for the 3D format and quite enjoyable it is to.

Finally, The Rescuers Blu-ray 2 Movie Collection is a worthwhile dual release and is a totally endearing and classic animated films that the whole family will love, while The Rescuers Down Under does a reasonable serviceable job as a sequel, even if it not as strong as the original animation film. The Rescuers and The Rescuers Down Under have never looked or sounded better, especially the impressive and clear picture quality of both animation films, makes these animation films are definitely worth buying for any fan of Walt Disney animated films. By the way I have always loved these Walt Disney animation films and I fully admit that it's probably my nostalgia for them talking, but they'll always hold a special place in my animation-loving heart. The emotional aspect of the first film and the throwback Bluth-inspired animation makes me adore it so much. The adventure and fun of the second animation film causes me to appreciate it probably a little more than I sis when it was first released in 1990. In any case, it's great to see these two animation films finally get the high-definition treatment. This Disney duo Blu-ray pack should please all fans of this animation film double bill should be very happy with the outcome, both in the audio and visual departments. Highly Recommended!

5131490,5,B0084IHVUC,"*The edition that I am reviewing is the standard DVD 2-Disc set*

""The Rescuers"" is considered one of Disney's animated (and non-princess) adventure gems.  In fact, for it's time, it managed to break box office records and hold on to it for almost a complete decade (until Fievel came on the scene with ""An American Tale"" came on the scene).  ""The Rescuers Down Under"" represents one of those rare sequels that does manage to significantly improve upon the original in terms of both general production value and in learning from both the failings and successes of the prior.  This is truly a good and solid package that one can enjoy.

ABOUT THE FILMS (ABSOLUTELY NO SPOILERS):
Between the two, ""The Rescuers Down Under"" is my favorite.  You see, the original ""The Rescuers"" is a solid film with an easy to follow plot, clear direction, some good humor, and tons of imagination.  However, though I did like the characters of Bernard and Bianca, there really wasn't much character development and therefore no real chance for me to develop a bond or connection with them.  Also, I found the girl really annoying.  I'm sure that wasn't helpful to my likability of the film haha.  But it's solid, and still a heart warmer.  Also, I'm used to old style animation (I was raised on the original ""Looney Tunes"", ""Tom and Jerry"", and ""Merrie Melodies""), but if a viewer is not particularly used to (or expecting) a flatter, old-school form of animation...that could be a turn off...or not (some people are drawn to something drastically different).  This film was released in 1977 so that should give you a clue to the animation style.  Personally, I'd rate this film 4 stars leaning towards 3.

""The Rescuers Down Under"" on the other hand surpasses the original in leaps and bounds.  Released in 1990, the production value is evidently stronger and much more modern.  The colors are more vibrant, a greater use of cinematic perspectives and angles, and much more imaginative action sequences.  Not only this, but the story is so much more cohesive and well paced.  I also loved the characters this time around.  They are much more appealing and relatable...and they took time to develop them.  You actually got to connect.  Also, the end was exceptionally satisfying.  I also really really enjoyed the humor here quite a bit more.  This is the film that got me to rate this 5 stars.

ABOUT THE PACKAGING:
The set comes in two discs which are packed in a normal sized DVD case with a flip page (one disc on each page...no stacking).  It should be noted that ""The Rescuers"" copy that is included is the 35th Anniversary edition.

ABOUT THE SPECIAL FEATURES:
On ""The Rescuers"" disc -
1. A copy of the ""Three Blind Mouseketeers"" Silly Symphony short film.
2.  A copy of ""Water Birds""...an old Disney wildlife documentary feature.
3.  A sing along to the film song ""Someone's Waiting For You"".

On ""The Rescuers Down Under"" disc -
There's a documentary on ""The Making of the Rescuers Down Under"".  It lasts around 10-minutes and is quite insightful.  There are also some mini shorts explaining what Disney Digital Movies are as well as the Disney 3D thing.

ALL IN ALL:
All in All, this is a wonderful collection of one of Disney's most noteworthy film series.  At an affordable price for two, this package is definitely a steal.  It is, admittedly, not the deepest or most engaging of Disney films...but it is still enjoyable, at times inspiring, and uniquely magnificent.",1422835200,,3461,4.79054054054054

It's got even more action-packed adventure as we follow a boy character this time around (whose name slips my mind at the moment), and yet another rodent named Jake, I think it was.

5131532,5,B0084IHVUC,"During the past Black Friday I got this for only $10 at FYE.  I watched both movies back to back, and truly enjoyed both of them.  For this review, I am going to judge each film on its own merits.

The Rescuers:  This is often regarded as a one of the best from Disneys dark-age; and I somewhat agree.  Its not as delightful as Robin Hood, the Sword in the Stone or the Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, but its still a film that I would place somewhere in the better half of Disneys animated canon.  I love the concept of mice that live in a world right under our own, and I especially like that theres a group dedicated to helping people.  Theres just something heartwarming about it.  Though we do owe Margarey Sharp thanks for the concept, this is much better than any of the books.  I liked them when I was a kid, but now they're just mediocre to me.  Unlike some Disney adaptions like the Jungle Book and the Wind In The Willows, this is nothing but a step-up from the books, especially in the character department.  Bernard and Bianca are 2 of my top five Disney mice; along with Basil from the Great Mouse Detective as well as Monterey Jack and Gadget Hackwrench from Chip N Dale Rescue Rangers (Wheres Mickey? you might ask; Im sorry but I don't like him).  And there were a fair many other memorable characters as well, like Rufus the cat, Orville the albatross and my favorite dragonfly Evinrude.  He was just so cute and awesome.  Madame Medusa and her associates were okay.  While not the most memorable Disney villains they were entertaining, especially the crocodiles.  The songs are quite nice; especially Some Ones Waiting for You.  Overall its an above average film that Walt would have been proud of, but its just not one of my favorites.  I really don't know why.  I guess because its a little slow in some parts, Penny can be annoying at times and to be honest its not as fun as some other Disney films.  But its still good.
4 stars.

The Rescuers Down Under:  First of all, let me discuss why I think this should even exist.  To be honest, I don't think they could have picked a better source of material for a sequel.  While Rescuers isn't the best Disney movie even of its time, its one of the very few that doesnt end with a happily ever after feel.  Doing a sequel to Robin Hood or the Sword in the Stone would have just felt forced (much like all those direct to video sequels Disney did), but not the Rescuers.  Fun fact; Disney was going to make a TV show for the Rescuers but after the death of Eva Gabor they scrapped it and reworked it into Chip N Dale Rescue Rangers.  As you know I love that show, so perhaps it was for the better.  Anyways, it definitely had room for more stories, and I am glad they picked it.  And unlike nearly all of the direct to video sequels, this one rocked.  Ever since I can remember this has been one of my favorite Disney movies.  I actually think I saw this before the Rescuers, which may explain why it was not one of my all-time favorites.  I really don't know what they were trying for to make this one so good, but its superior to the original in very way.  The animation is astounding.  Personally, I would love to see this film on the big screen in 3D because some of the scenes with the eagle flying really give the illusion of flight.  The story was just more interesting and fast-paced than the original, and the other characters were much better as well.  Cody was never annoying, Jake was cool, Wilbur was hilarious and McLeech was one of the best Disney villains.  He was sadistic, yet funny.  I also thought that Joanna was a very entertaining sidekick.  The scene with the eggs is priceless.  Without a doubt this is one of the best Disney movies ever.  In fact, I would rank it as my 3rd favorite after the Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast.  I cant believe this bombed at the box office.  Seriously, who wouldnt love this movie?  I've had it in one format or another ever since I first saw it.
5 stars.

So thats 9 stars, which divided 2 equals 4.5.  Im rounding up because I love the Rescuers Down Under so much, and the first one is not bad.  This needs to be in everyones Disney blu-ray collection.  Spread the word, because the Rescuers Down Under needs all the love it can get.",1417564800,,4271,4.333333333333333

There are so many classic voices in the movie--if you grew up on Disney like I did, you will recognize many of the voices.

5131599,5,B0084IHVUC,"The Rescuers: The 23rd animated Disney classic is underrated and somewhat forgotten, yet one of Disney's finest! It's a great movie, even one of Disney's finest underrated works.

This charming film, while undoubtedly heartwarming, is also creative and very lively. It has lots of adventure and suspense, classic humor, fine artwork, a wonderful soundtrack and a dark atmosphere. When I say ""dark"" I mean dark in the sense of being somewhat chilly, but without being extremely dark or a story of horror/terror. The darkness of the Devil's Bayou is amazing, creepy to the point of almost looking like a forbidding place, which helps a lot to create this distinct atmosphere.

Despite the apparent simplicity, this motion picture has some very artistic palette colors. One good example of this is the amazing and gorgeous opening sequence. The beautiful but sad song 'The Journey' matches in perfection.

The song 'Tomorrow is another day' is very optimistic and nostalgic. Not just that, it fits perfectly on that sequence: beautiful vistas painted with heart and soul. Besides, that rainbow and those New York City lights at night look incredibly real.

The song 'Someone's waiting for you' is heartwarming, but so is the sequence itself. 'The U.S. Air Force' is a delightful instrumental music, very energetic and full of life.

Medusa is a great villain. One of Disney's best villains, says I. She's mean and nasty, but at the same time funny (even hilarious at times). She is a little eccentric but not too much and not annoying. Besides, she isn't too sinister or one of the most cruel villains.

Medusa's sidekick, Snoops, is someone I don't consider a real villain. He's not bad enough to be a villain and he doesn't know how to be bad, although he attempts. I think that deep down he is a good guy. I like Snoops: he's a simple and goofy guy but funny (even hilarious at times) and not that bad. He's more of a poor guy who messed with the wrong person.

By the way, Medusa and Snoops have a nice pawn shop named ""Medusa's pawn shop"" or, like Medusa delightfully says on the telephone, Madame Medusa's pawn shop boutique.

Comical characters like Luke and the albatross Orville have small roles, perhaps because this movie is more of a dramatic natured one. Numerous swamp animals appear (others than Luke), but their roles are minor (with the exception of Ellie Mae and Evinrude).

Bernard is the kind of romantic and shy hero. Bianca has a characteristic Hungarian charm (her voice actress, Eva Gabor, was Hungarian). Orville is carefree and spirited, as well as a comic relief. Like albatrosses in real life, he flies beautifully but is very bad at landings.

Evinrude's sounds are awesome. They sound so real! I have no words to describe them! James MacDonald really had a gift for sounds.

Penny was apparently modeled after Michelle Stacy, the cute little girl who did her voice. Penny is cute and has a very cute voice. People sympathize with Penny and her situation in the film, yet despite being very endearing she is also confident and has a strong personality - something which Snoops doesn't know how to deal with.

The crocodiles Nero and Brutus are hilarious in every scene they appear. I don't know why, but there is something hilarious about them even just by looking at them. They are at their most hilarious when they play organ. And those rascals really know how to play talent, LOL. They have talent for music, LOL! Besides, although they are Medusa's loyal pets, they are good crocodiles and not vicious. Whenever they catch Penny, they always grab her carefully not to harm her. And they are just as careful with her beloved teddy bear. Even in the water they have special care with her and her teddy bear.

A very good and timeless Disney classic! This is one of those animated classics I grew up with - and 'The Rescuers Down Under' too. Both were part of my childhood.

1977 was one of the best years in cinema ever!

This should definitely be on Top 250.

The Rescuers - Down Under: THE RESCUERS, in my opinion, is pure Disney entertainment. It made me feel all warm and tingly when Bernard (voice of Bob Newhart) and Bianca (voice of Eva Gabor) set out on their mission to rescue Cody (voice of Adam Ryen) and the rare golden eagle. If you ask me, McLeach (voice of George C. Scott) was absolutely nefarious. You'll have to see the movie if you want to know why. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone was perfectly cast, the direction was flawless, and Disney has scored a big hit. Also, after having seen this movie, I would love to go to Australia one day. In conclusion, I highly recommend this pure Disney blockbuster to everyone who hasn't seen it. I guarantee you you'll enjoy it.",1397088000,5,4735,4.714285714285714

5131603,4,B0084IHVUC,"I'm not going to get into the story, we have all seen the Rescuers/Down under.  Nonetheless I was thrilled that these made it to Blu-Ray.  However, my one issue is that it took me a while to figure out how to play Down Under.  I thought it might have been on the ""bonus disc"", but I couldn't find it.  There are two discs, but seemingly one movie.

The reason for this confusion was this: you pop in Disc 1 and you see a dvd menu that is basically a menu over a backdrop of the medusa's boat-house in the swamp.  One logically assumes it is the Rescuers disc.  So then you put in Disc 2 and see a ""bonus features"" menu.  Where's the ""down under"" disc?  Apparently there isn't one, the movie is hidden in the dvd menu of disc one which appears to be only ""The Rescuers"", but it actually contains both movies.  The disc menu is just themed as if it is only ""the rescuers"".  Logically it didn't make much sense to me, I had to navigate through the Disc 1 menu before I found Down Under.

However as I watched The Rescuer's Down Under I was distraught to discover that the audio on this version of the movie (or at least my DVD copy) is faulty. Secondary audio such as the phone ringing (Hawaii RAS scene) and Cody's mother talking in the beginning have been completely forgotten (the same thing happened to my Beauty and the Beast DVD even though the additional language has everything intact). Instead all you have is silence so it seems like the characters have super hearing and are responding to something the audience has to assume. It's nothing major but considering my VHS is better than the DVD in that respect, it's a sorry loss. Very disappointing that despite being an anniversary release and restoration of the movies, this has happened especially when we're in the peak of film and audio industry, the digital era. As a Film and Animation student, it really is more so irksome and disappointing in addition to it being a favorite and a birthday gift.

I replaced my older dvd version of The Rescuers Down Under which was my favorite of the two movies, but now that I have them both in BD, I can appreciate the first movie mopre. The first movie is definitely more colorful and the animation (mostly hand drawn) as compared to the second one being more computer drawn, is beautiful as the story weaves around bayou country. The stories are suitable for ""children of all ages"" as Disney likes to say, and I'm a ""senior"" and have a lot of fun watching these movies. The mouse characters are done so well and very lovable. You get caught up int he subtle love story going on between Miss Bianca (Eva Gabor) and Bernard (Bob Newhart. John Candy as the voice of the albatross is a great touch, he is hilarious. Not a lot of extras, but what is there is worthwhile, a Silly Symphony cartoon of Three Blind Mouseketeers is fun.

5131619,5,B0084IHVUC,"Disney Studios 23rd full length animated feature film from the Disney studios. The Rescuers has been justifiably paired with the studios 29th animated feature film the sequel released 13 years later The Rescuers Down Under.

The original Rescuers film is not one of my favorites, but it isn't a bad film. It just looks and feels a little underwhelming compared to the classic Disney animated films of Yesteryear. The Rescuers is a dark film both in visual style and story. It's not the first time Disney has had dark themes in their animated films, but this one seems dark throughout.

The Blu Ray transfer of the first film is too dark and doesn't appear to have had the royal treatment in terms of clean up. It is brighter than the old DVD, but it should have been brightened up a bit more because in the night scenes (which are most of the time) the detail seems lost in the darkness. Don't misunderstand me, I wouldn't want to change the original concept and art, just let us see all that great animation and beautiful color work. The color palette is interesting and certainly different than most of Disney's animated films. I actually like it a lot. There are occasional specks here and there and the whole film just looks like it needed a little more care. It's still the best this film has ever looked on Home Video and I don't think we'll see a better version anytime soon.

This is also one of the rare occasions where the new Xerography process suits the material. The Xerography process while being a cost saving achievement did not make these newer films better in my opinion, in fact they just don't have the Disney luster we've all become accustomed to.

Like I stated in previous reviews on films from this era of Disney's animated cannon  the process has been fleshed out more and the new process isn't as jarring as it seemed in Sword and the Stone and some others from this time period between 1961-1981.

The artwork is beautiful in the film, but it is a totally different style. The rougher lines on the drawings being exposed tend to come across like their unpolished, but this is really not the case with this film, Jungle Book and 101 Dalmatians. Because Disney ended the traditional process with the fabulous looking Sleeping Beauty, (yes one scene used this process.. a sort of trial) these films looks very 2 dimensional and just don't seem to have the same magical look to them.

The Rescuers is the first and only animated film from Disney to get a theatrical sequel (until the recent Winnie The Pooh sequel) and I for one think the sequel is a better film.  This may be in part because the newer film looks so much better and is brighter. The restoration seems to be very good, but to be fair this film may not have needed nearly as much work as the original. The Blu Ray is by far the best looking home video release. There are other reasons I prefer this film to the original, one is the dramatic art work and sheer scale of the scenes are something we hadn't seen from Disney before this. Even if Disney's animated films didn't always improve upon the early classics, it is interesting and impressive to see them trying something new with each picture. I've watched them all in order in a very short amount of time and I can see their growth in some areas, sadly not always giving us a better film each time.

I own DVD release and the new Blu Ray and it's nice to see we're getting past the aspect ration issue years, the new Blu Ray (like the old DVD release) is in 1:66:1 which it the correct aspect ratio. The fact that we get both films on this release is a good selling point, but while the Blu Ray looks very good, the addition of a ""making of"" for the first film, Trailers? Hello? and some new worthy extras would have gone a long way to bring this release up a notch, it is a 35th anniversary edition after all. Why not celebrate it with some newly recorded interviews and making of the film stuff? There are some decent extras, one being from the true life adventure series some vintage shorts etc., but it all seems rather randon to me. If you want to own The Rescuers and The Rescuers Down Under, then the Blu Ray is the way to go. You may want to hold onto your DVD's for the extras, but that's your decision.",1384300800,3,4255,4.444871794871795

5131632,3,B0084IHVUC,"I won't comment too much on the film but it is one of my childhood favorites. For this restoration Disney hasn't done much but they also have not tampered with anything like they did with The Sword in the Stone, leading to massive DNR problems and an all-around terrible picture.

This new release has some murky and untouched scenes, though, the restoration has cleaned it up better than any other previous release. Most scenes are fairly detailed and quite a bit better than any other I have seen. I can't really remember what the theatrical version looked like but this is about as close as it will come. Softness resides and it is clear it probably needs a new master from the negative.

The color timing seems to be an issue for some. The older DVD was ridiculously cool and they seem to have restored a good deal of the natural, warmer coloration some were looking for. It may still seem off as do some of the other coloring choices for their other films but to me it isn't a huge deal as we at least have a decent presentation of this adventure classic. In my opinion people can at least rest easy it doesn't look like the old DVD in most scenes.

3.5 stars, though, as Disney surely could have done better. At this point most of us are satisfied when they don't completely butcher something.",1376870400,2,1299,4.472573839662447

Disney home video is usually overpriced but it seems like you get what you pay for in the packaging.

I also feel like this is a pretty good deal for a Disney set, since you're getting two films for what they'd typically charge for one, even if they are a bit short.

The transfer is good, about the best image quality you could expect for the 1977 Rescuers and naturally better for Down Under. Having both movies on the same disc is convenient, although the menu is a little confusing initially since it is themed after the first movie.

5131660,4,B0084IHVUC,"Overview:

Walt Disney Studios has produced many classic films through the years, but its consistently innovative and often brilliant work in animation is what made the company the powerhouse it is today. Several generations have grown up watching Disney classics such as Snow White and The Seven Dwarves and Pinocchio, and many more generations to come will enjoy newer classics like The Lion King and Beauty and the Beast. Although Disney has many classics under their belt, there are also many films that fewer people may remember, and some that many have tried to forget!

 Considering all this, its difficult to know where The Rescuers stands in the long history of Walt Disney Studios. It may lack the beautiful animation of the early days and the modern elements of the renaissance era, but what it does have to offer is modesty and heart. The story and characters are very simple, but somehow that's make makes the film so powerful and effective, especially for kids. The Rescuers and its 1990 sequel The Rescuers Down Under often aren't considered in the same breath as Cinderella or Sleeping Beauty, but with likable characters, an adventurous spirit, and a feeling of innocence lost in many modern animated films, they are actually just as good.

The Rescuers (1977)

 Both The Rescuers and its sequel follow the same basic plot. A particularly evil person with a doofy sidekick kidnaps a cute little kid because they know the location of something rare. In the case of the first movie, an orphan girl named Penny is kidnapped by Cruella Deville's redheaded cousin because she knows the location of a valuable diamond. Penny manages to reach out for help with a message in a bottle that goes all the way to New York city, where its found by a council of helpful mice. A bright and peppy female mouse named Miss Bianca volunteers to find Penny and asks the humble janitor Bernard to aid her on the quest. Against all odds they set off on an adventure to rescue Penny from her captors.

 The Rescuers is very effective in getting the audience emotionally involved in its story. The animators at Walt Disney Studios are masters at audience manipulation, and their tactics are very evident here. Penny's story is very tragic and there are many scenes that will tug on your heartstrings until they snap. Many people appreciate the sentimental aspects present in may Disney films. There are many reassuring speeches, sappy musical interludes, and downright sad scenes spread throughout the film, but I sometimes feel the sentimentality is laid on too thick.

 This was the first Disney film to be written by both the classic team known as the Nine Old Men as well as several new coming writers intended to carry the flag into the new generation. As a result we get a mix between the old-school spirit of sentiment and drama as well as the newer style of situational comedy and exciting action. I think that for the most part the outcome of this was something unique, and it gives The Rescuers a very distinct style when compared so some other Disney animated films.

 The characters are probably my favorite part of this movie. Disney films do a great job of making you love the heroes and love to hate the villains, and The Rescuers is certainly no exception. In fact, it defines that ability more than any other movie I can think of. The main characters Miss Bianca and Bernard are small and furry little creatures with really big, emotional eyes. They are essentially the epitome of cute. The other friendly characters they run into along the way are fun and entertaining as well. The villains are also designed with sinister perfection. The first time you see Madame Medusa, you immediately know she's the villain just by the way she looks. She is very ugly and she has no neck (reminds me of my third grade teacher).

 In terms of comedy, this film was trying to be more dramatic compared to other films of that era including The Jungle Book and The Sword and The Stone. Still, the film contained many funny moments, mainly as a result of Bernard's nervousness during the adventure. There is also one very funny minor character who breathes fire every time he takes a sip of whiskey. Who doesn't love some good old fashioned retroactively offensive Disney moments?

 As someone who recently re watched The Rescuers after seeing it just a few times as a kid, I have to say I didn't really hold this movie in a  high enough regard. I always thought of it as a little more boring than most Disney movies, but now I don't think that's true at all. It kept me entertained the entire time and I was throughly engaged with the story and characters. Several scenes were as tense as anything I've seen in an animated film. The Rescuers may not be the perfect Disney film, but it sure is a great one.

RATING: 3.5/5

The Rescuers Down Under (1990)

 The first Rescuers movie was released to high praise from critics who gave a lukewarm reception to Disney's previous animated feature, Robin Hood. The Rescuers was seen as a return to form for Disney, who by the late 70's had lost much of the respect they had garnered in the 40's and 50's. The film continued doing well in several re-releases so in a rare move for Disney it was decided that a sequel be produced.

 The result was the 1990 film The Rescuers Down Under, which saw our heroes Bernard and Miss Bianca once again team up to save a kidnapped child, this time a young boy trapped by a sinister poacher hellbent on discovering the whereabouts of a rare bird in the Australian outback. The plot is very similar to the first movie, but with a whole lot of additional characters and a whole lot more production value. This film looks absolutely great, but what else would you expect from Disney in the 90's?

 Down Under was the second film to be released during the Disney renaissance and it shows in the quality of both the animation and the writing. Gone is the humble nature of the original movie, replaced with the grand spectacle of the 90's. This time instead of a lame ballad as an opening, we get a spectacularly animated sequence of the young boy soaring through the air on the back of a majestic eagle. I can see why most people my age know the sequel more than the original.

 The obvious difference between the first and second movie is its attempt to broaden the appeal in terms of both comedy and action to a younger generation more accustomed to the cartoon style of saturday morning cartoons than the animated films of old. The comedy comes more quickly and easily than in the first movie. All around I felt Down Under had a more light-hearted feel than the heavy-handed original. The characters are more playful, and as a result more relatable as well.

 The action of this movie is truly spectacular. There are many sequences in this film that will have you on the edge of your seat. I was reminded of Indiana Jones many times while watching, and believe me that's a very good thing! Everything is smooth and quick-paced, and most importantly easy to follow whats going on.

 Overall The Rescuers Down Under is a fitting sequel to the classic original that brings a lot more to the table than one might initially think. The animation is absolutely great, and the tone is light-hearted and fun. It is a film that won't disappoint if you're looking for a family film anybody can enjoy.

Visually, the disc is stunning, on par with all of Disney's other animated releases. No complaints there.

Audio wise, the original movie really shows its age. Limited frequency range, some sound effects / dialouge / music in some places sounds tinny. This does not seem to be consistant with other movies of the era, but seems to be consistant with previous home video releases of this movie. Not sure why the sound quality is so bad in this movie, earlier Disney movies didn't sound nearly this bad.

It never even occured to me that TV starts could do anything by live action movies (obviously I was very young at the time).  The best thing about these two are the subtle things, the animation placed atop Eva's laugh thrilling for adventure with Bob's panic filled voice, playing the straight man, even as a mouse.  The villian are people you love to hate, the secondary characters are full of personality and all in the classical Disney family fun with themes of conservation, heroism, always seeking to do the right thing.

5131728,4,B0084IHVUC,"An enjoyable and classic animated adventure that will continue to entertain families for many generations to come.  ""The Rescuers: 35th Anniversary Edition"" and the sequel ""The Rescuers Down Under"" will be released on Blu-ray and DVD in August 2012!

Back in 1977, ""The Rescuers"", the 23rd film in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series, would become Disney's most successful animated film.  The film would break the record for the largest financial amount made for an animated film on opening weekend and would receive rave reviews from film critics. Created with the budget of $1.2 million, ""The Rescuers"" would earn over $71 million in the box office.

Based on the books ""The Rescuers"" and ""Miss Bianca"" by Margery Sharp, the success of the film would lead to a sequel (the 29th film in the Walt Disney Animated Classics) titled ""The Rescuers Down Under"" in 1990.

Its sequel ""The Rescuers Down Under"" was Disney's first traditionally-animated film to use the Computer Animation Production System (CAPS) utilizing digital ink and paint and compositing and its departure from hand-painted cels. The film would also be the first collaboration with computer graphics company, Pixar and also the second animated film after the 1985 film, ""The Black Cauldron"", to not include any musical numbers.

Unfortunately, the film was released during the time that Disney was still in transition and it became the least successful box office performance for a Disney animated film.  Budgeted at $37.9 million, ""The Rescuers Down Under"" would earn $47 million in the box office.

But for those who were fans of the film, both ""The Rescuers"" film will now receive its 35th Anniversary Edition on Blu-ray!

VIDEO:

""The Rescuers"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:66:1).  The first film is a bit similar to ""The Aristocats"" (both Blu-ray titles are being released on the same day) in the fact that the character style looks as if it was hand drawn while background scenery is very detailed but you can tell it is an older film by its presentation.  There are some scratches that can be seen. There are moments where scenes are colorful and vibrant, black levels were nice and deep and I'm confident to say this is the best version of the film to day on a home video release.

""The Rescuers Down Under"" in the other hand is a more recent film and presentation-wise, is much cleaner and more vibrant than the original film.  More modern animation presentation/style which lends to its more cleaner, vibrant and more detailed look.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""The Rescuers"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio with French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  I felt the original was more dialogue-driven.  Primarily front and center channel driven.  While dialogue is crystal clear, the sequel, ""The Rescuers Down Under"", being a more modern film, sounds much better and utilizes the surround channels.  From the flight of the Marahute to the sounds of the crocodiles snapping their mouths, there is good use of directional sound.

Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""The Rescuers: 35th Anniversary Edition/The Rescuers Down Under"" comes with the following special features:

  Deleted Song - Deleted song for ""Peoplitis"".
  ""Three Blind Mouseketeers"" - Silly Symphony Animated Short- (8:45) A 1936 animated short of ""Three Blind Mouseketeers"".
  ""Water Birds - A Walt Disney True Life Adventure"" - (30:42) A documentary feature on water birds.
  ""Someone's Waiting For You"" Sing-Along - Sing-along for ""Someone's Waiting For You"".
  The Making of The Rescuers Down Under - (10:13) A featurette on the making of ""The Rescuers Down Under"".

EXTRAS:

""The Rescuers: 35th Anniversary Edition/The Rescuers Down Under"" comes with a slipcover case and a DVD version of both films.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I was young when I watched ""The Rescuers"" in the theater and watching it on Blu-ray, this would be my first time watching this film since I was a child back in the late '70s.

I personally can see its charm and allure, from its little mouse characters and how the film hooks you with its child actor, the film is pretty much big on ""cuteness"" and also has this adventure element as these two mice represent a secret organization.

While a short animated film, the original tugged on the hearts of many viewers during that era in time.  And what is quite interesting is juxtaposing this film with its sequel ""The Rescuers Down Under"".  In how it treats its youngsters.  For those familiar with Disney during the late '70s, the company tried to take on more darker themes in its storyline.  While the original has a feisty antagonist who is mean and selfish, the sequel has a man who seems far too ruthless and willing to risk a child's safety in order to get information, so he can make a lot of money.

While both films are Rated G, it was interesting to see the varying difference of storyline.  While the first film was more adventurous, cute and fun, especially as it also focused on the relationship between Miss Bianca and Bernard, the second still showcases both mice, but the storyline is more adventurous and bold, rather than adventurous and emotional.  In the first film, you feel for Penny and you want to see the best of her character.  While Cody is a youngster full of energy, it makes you think of why a young boy is going around near cliffs in the Australian Outback without his parents.

Granted, these are films that were never meant to be taken too seriously but I guess when it comes to storyline, the original is much better, while when it comes to picture and audio quality, the sequel, being made many years later is the winner in terms of presentation and sound.

So, I'm glad that both are included in this Blu-ray release and also, for parents, it's a plus that this Blu-ray release, also comes with both DVD's.  There is no doubt that this is the best version of ""The Rescuers"" to come out on home video due to the picture and audio quality improvement and also both films are included together for this 35th anniversary edition.  There are a few special features included, including the Silly Symphony animated short ""The Three Blind Mousketeers"" and an interesting, older documentary on ""Water Birds"".

Overall, ""The Rescuers"" is a fun family film, as this is a fun and entertaining Disney release on Blu-ray.  For parents who are looking for a fun family film or Disney collectors wanting an HD upgrade for these two animated films, will no doubt want to upgrade their copies of ""The Rescuers"" and ""The Rescuers Down Under"" to Blu-ray.  Two Disney Animated Classics films for the price of one, it's definitely worth it!",1354320000,,6679,4.904634581105169
5131729,5,B0084IHVUC,"If your a fan of Disney movies and are trying to build a new blu-ray collection of them, this is a good buy.

5131730,4,B0084IHVUC,I love both of the movies. Both of the movies are  on the list of  Disney theatrical animated features released films The rescues is number 23 and the rescuers down under is number 29.

5131733,2,B0084IHVUC,"The first Rescuers, even with its theme of child abduction and abuse, is at least watered down by its typically cute Disney animal antics. Madame Medusa may treat Penny horribly, but it's a mostly ""cartoony"" violence mitigated by delightful swamp folk and silly alligators.

The sequel, the Rescuers Down Under, is an entirely different matter. Its protagonist is a big game hunter with little of Medusa's buffoonish behavior. Instead he delights in violence and, in the climax of the film, hangs the boy he's kidnapped over a pit of alligators, frightening beasts animated with no sense of whimsy like the crocs in the first Rescuers. When the crane the boy is dangling from gets jammed, the hunter tries to shoot the cable holding the boy over the crocs, all the while cackling with sadistic delight.

I have no idea what Disney was thinking when making Down Under. It is a horribly inappropriate, violent movie that should have easily earned a PG-13 rating for the ending sequence. Whoever the geniuses were who thought that feeding a child to crocodiles in a gritty animated fashion made for a great Disney film should have their heads examined.

Show the first movie to you kids, with the caveat that Medusa treats Penny horribly (at one point telling her she's ""homely"" and no one will ever love her.) But stay away from the sadistic, horrible sequel!",1353801600,6,1357,4.865800865800866
5131734,5,B0084IHVUC,The movies are some of Disney's best. They both have the same general story line of two mice rescuing a child in trouble.

I enjoy BOTH ""Rescuers"" movies, but of course in their own different ways. The original ""Rescuers"" is soft and heavy, but also an enjoyable mystery and rescue mission, very similar to my favorite Disney movie ""The Great Mouse Detective."" I like ""The Rescuers Down Under"" for being a more modern action-packed wilderness adventure, having a similar heart to modern computer animated films. It is very rare to see an animated movie take place in the Outback of Australia, and I think this movie has detailed it very well. This sequel is actually way better than those lousy direct-to-video sequels. This 2 Movie Collection DVD is unregrettable!",1351296000,3,769,5.015625

5131747,5,B0084IHVUC,Both of these movies are wonderful additions to the Disney cannon but the original Rescuers holds a special place in my heart because it was released the year I was born and because of Bernard's fear of the number 13 the month and day of my birthday are on the calendar at the end of the movie.,1348531200,,294,4.175438596491228
5131748,5,B0084IHVUC,"I am a HUGE fan of the original movie and so am really pleased to finally see its Hi-Def release, and whilst this is not a clean-up job on a par with a Disney household-name feature like say 'Snow White', it is a really great version.
Thankfully it's not been taken from the same dismal print as that of the previously released DVD, it's taken from an earlier, and altogether cleaner, print as can be plainly seen by the fact that the opening logo is the original 'Buena Vista' logo and not the later 'castle' logo that appears at the beginning of the old DVD.
Therefore the restoration of this particular print just needed the DNR applying (digital noise reduction) to clean it up for Blu-ray. To remove the blemishes from the other (DVD) print would have been an altogether different, and more expensive, task, and that seems to be reserved these days for only the studio's 'diamond editions'.
Anyway, the result is a smart and clean picture, with nicely saturated colours and in some places even the texture of the board that the background is painted on is visible. I own original cels and even some backgrounds from this movie and I can tell you that the colour match of this Blu-ray edition is really rather good.
The few problems left on screen here and there, like one or two grit particles and out-of focus frames, are on the original film print and cannot be corrected with just a DNR pass.
The 5.1 sound mix is great too, with clear upfront dialogue and nicely spread atmospherics and music.
The bonus material is sadly lacking, I would have loved to see some vintage behind the scenes footage (which I know exists, as I remember watching 'making of' promotions on TV leading up to the 1977 cinema release), but instead Disney has generously added 'Down Under' as a great big bonus feature! And as the sequel was actually a bona-fide cinema release and not a straight to video 'cheap-quel' I think that its inclusion as a bonus is actually a rather magnanimous one!

5131750,5,B0084IHVUC,"This review is really more for ""The Rescuers Down Under"" than the original ""Rescuers"".  I was never really a huge fan of ""The Rescuers"" and didn't think it was one of Disney's better efforts.  ""The Rescuers Down Under"", on the other hand, remains to this day my all time favorite Disney movie!  I'm an amateur wildlife artist, specializing in birds of prey, and it was RDU that got me into eagles in the first place!  I absolutely love this movie, and it was superior to it's prequel in so many ways - the animation was much better, the storyline was great, the music score by Bruce Broughton was phenomenal.  I also liked the fact that Disney decided not to make this a musical (notwithstanding McLeach's twisted renditions of ""Home on the Range"" and ""You Get a Line, I'll Get a Pole"").  I was spellbound when I originally saw this in a theater and, sadly, I was only able to see it theatrically once.  But the epic outback landscapes, and Cody's flight on Marahute's back were awesome on the big screen.  And the whole theater just rumbled when McLeach drove his bushwhacker around!  McLeach, himself, was the definitive Disney villain - I mean, come on, he aimed his gun at a kid, threw knives at a kid, and dangled a kid into a crocodile pit, not to mention threw the kid's backpack into the crocodile pit to make everyone think he was dead!  This guy was really twisted!  You were cheering when he finally got his just due!  Another thing I like about RDU is that you really don't have to have seen the original ""Rescuers"" to know what's going on - it's a great movie by itself.  The eagle, Marahute, is amazing - a huge eagle, beautifully colored, with a 40 foot wingspan.  Obviously, someone at Disney was a National Geographic fan, because according to the National Geographic video ""Australia's Aborigines"", the Aboriginal name for the white bellied sea eagle is ""Marawuti"", the great hunter (a 2 letter difference from ""Marahute"").  Cody, the Australian boy who saves Marahute, wasn't voiced by an Australian actor (I think the boy who voiced him, Adan Ryen, was actually Norwegian), so his accent sort of comes and goes, but he's still very believable as far as his character goes, even if his accent is not.  And Jake, the kangaroo rat, has all the can-do of Crocodile Dundee, and always tries to impress Miss Bianca, but in the end, it's the humble Bernard who's the big hero and who ultimately wins Bianca's heart!  Wilbur, the albatross, voiced by the late John Candy, provides comic relief, as does Frank, the frilled lizard.  All in all, it's a great adventure story that I've seen probably over 100 times and I never tire of it.

As for the DVD, they did a new digital tranfer I think, and so the graininess that was present in the original DVD release from 2000 is gone, and it's a clear picture throughout!  (I remember that was a point of contention with the 2000 release).  I had always hoped Disney would make a deluxe repackage of RDU for it's anniversary, but I guess this is the closest we will get.  The DVD also includes ""The Making of RDU"", which was not on the 2000 release (but it was included on the German version!)  It's only a 10 minute documentary, and although it is insightful, I wish they would have had some interviews with the voice actors.  Also, I remember watching a making of RDU back in 1990, where it showed how they went to the Peregrine Fund headquarters in Idaho to draw some of the birds, but in this one, the head animator says he drew from a big, stuffed eagle on loan from the Natural History museum.  (In the end credits to RDU, they do thank the Peregrine Fund).  Anyway, it's nice to finally have a decent version of RDU, even if you do have to buy the 2 DVD set in order to get it.  It's also nice that it's finally available on Blu-Ray, as well - I would love to see how it looks in hi-def once I have a player!  I'm sure Marahute will look amazing soaring through the sky again!

As long as I do have ""The Rescuers"" as well, I'll probably give it another chance one of these days.",1348272000,,4040,4.473396998635743

5131752,4,B0084IHVUC,"Disney has packaged one of its classic features with its sequel in a new Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack.  ""The Rescuers"" / ""The Rescuers Down Under"" double feature commemorates the 35th anniversary of the introduction of two of the world's bravest mice -- Bernard and Bianca -- as they set out on two exciting rescue missions packed with comic adventures.

In ""The Rescuers"" (1977), a little girl named Penny has been kidnapped by Miss Medusa.  When the human law enforcement officials fail to locate the child, Bernard and Miss Bianca take over with the help of several colorful animal companions.  Though there is plenty of comedy, the movie has its share of frightening moments.  Voices are provided by Bob Newhart (Bernard), Eva Gabor (Bianca), and Geraldine Page (Miss Medusa).

""The Rescuers Down Under"" (1990) has further adventures that take place in Australia.  The two-disc Combo Pack contains a deleted song; ""The Three Blind Mouseketeers,"" a Silly Symphony animated short; ""Water Birds,"" a Disney True-Life Adventure; sing-along song; and making-of featurette.",1347408000,,1064,5.2976190476190474
5131753,5,B0084IHVUC,"The Rescuers was the last feature produced by Walt's legendary team of animators (the nine old men) and is easily their best since Walt's death in 1966. Released in 1977, The Rescuers is a delightful and heartfelt story full of adventure, poignancy and great characters. Both Bernard and Miss Bianca are wonderful creations that compliment each other. Madame Medusa may seem like Cruella De Vil but is not at all forgettable. The voice cast is spot on with Bob Newhart, Eva Gabor, Geraldine Page and the rest giving memorable performances and bringing unforgettable characters to life. The story of these two mice rescuing a little girl keeps you invested the whole time and you care for them very much. The Rescuers may seem a like a little obscure film but the truth is that is a Disney classic through and through.

Released 13 years later in 1990, The Rescuers Down Under was Disney's first official sequel produced by the main studio (not to be confused with a cheapquel). With high production values and using the CAPS system for the first time, Down Under is a breathtaking adventure. Bob Newhart and Eva Gabor reprised their roles as Bernard and Miss Bianca as they now are headed to Australia to rescue a little boy from an evil poacher. While I like the first film more, the sequel stills has a lot going for it. Again the voice cast is wonderful, the updated animation looks amazing and the flight scenes are absolutely mesmerizing.

Both The Rescuers and The Rescuers Down Under offer high quality entertainment and they're sure to delight the entire family.

Video & Audio

First, I have to say that The Rescuers DVD was one of the worst DVDs I'd ever owned. That being said, this BD is a very solid upgrade. The picture is clean for the most time although some tiny specs appear from time to time. Detail and clarity are strong and artifacting is nowhere to be found. A nice job done by Disney.

The Rescuers Down Under looks brighter and more striking than its predecessor. Detail and clarity are spot on and colors are bright and bold. It's not a CAPS transfer and some light grain permeates the picture but it gives it a nice filmic quality. A nice transfer all around.

Both films have 5.1 DTS-HD MA and while both get the job done, Down Under has a better use for it than the first film (due of course to inherent limitations). All in all, both are adequate mixes.

Bonus Material

This is the most disappointing part of the set. Being its 35 anniversary and being such a great film, I expected more and more substantial bonus material for The Rescuers. Anyway, this is what was included:

""Peoplitis"" is a recently found deleted song from The Rescuers. Introduced by director Ron Clements, the song is nothing extraordinary and it is better that it was cut off.

""Water Birds"" is an episode from Walt Disney's famous True-Life Advetures

""Three Blind Mouseketeers"" is a silly simphony featuring mice.

""Disney Song Selection""

""The Making of The Rescuers Down Under"" is a promotional piece that came around the same time the film was released. It's a very short piece but at least is something.

A DVD copy is included for each film.

Final Thoughts

The Rescuers is an absolute Disney classic. The Rescuers Down Under, while not as good as the first is still highly entertaining. Both films offer nice transfers, good sound and a slim amount bonus material. Anyway, buy this set and you won't be disappointed!!",1346976000,40,3431,4.712374581939799

It is an adorable story and the animation definitely got better with blu-ray, but it still has the original touch to it.  There are fun songs and characters that make this story a classic for years to come!

5131759,4,B0084IHVUC,"I can now show my children this wonderful film thanks to Walt Disney Home Entertainment's 2-movie Blu-ray release of ""The Rescuers"" and ""The Rescuers Down Under"" in a 35th Anniversary Edition. Both films are charming and hold up well. However, the original remains the jewel in the crown.

""The Rescuers"" tells the story of two mice named Miss Bianca and Bernard. Miss Bianca is a member of the international Rescue Aid Society and Bernard is their janitor. Miss Bianca chooses Bernard as her cohort for a mission to rescue a little girl named Penny from a devious woman and her inept accomplice. They're using the child to look for a lost diamond in the swamps of Devil's Bayou.

Besides the messages of good wins over evil and you have to confront a challenge even if you're afraid, this movie is just fun. There aren't any great social commentaries or life lessons to be found. It's a whimsical and suspenseful adventure for the whole family.

""The Rescuers Down Under"" takes Miss Bianca and Bernard to the Outback of Australia. There they must rescue a boy from the clutches of an evil poacher named McLeach. McLeach uses the child as an unknowing guide to the nest of an eagle and its eggs. Can they save the boy and keep the poacher from killing the great eagle and her offspring?

Unlike its predecessor, this sequel carries an obvious statement against the hunting and killing of animals. It's still an action-packed thrill ride and very humorous even with an agenda. I think every animated film in the early 1990s needed a purpose and reason to exist.

Hungarian actress Eva Gabor voices Miss Bianca with all the sophistication and panache she was known for. Bob Newhart brings Bernard to life with his trademark quiet and indifferent vocalization. John Candy gives a comical performance as the bumbling albatross Wilbur. George C. Scott sounds as malevolent as I'm sure Disney allowed him to as McLeach.

The high-definition transfers of both films look great. The recent ""The Rescuers Down Under"" looks finer than the original as far as animation quality goes. You can see the limits of the art in ""The Rescuers"" getting pushed a bit beyond their original ""real film"" intentions. The movie still looks and sounds better than it ever has. The audio for the movies shine brightly through their 5.1 surround mixes.

There are quite a few special features in this edition. They include the deleted song ""Peoplitis"" and a sing-along song entitled ""Someone's Waiting for You."" It contains the classic Silly Symphony short ""The Three Blind Mouseketeers"" and the featurette ""The Making of 'The Rescuers Down Under.'"" The ""Water Birds"" Disney True Life Adventure is also included.

The 3-Disc 35th Anniversary Edition of ""The Rescuers"" and ""The Rescuers Down Under"" on Blu-ray is a perfect addition to any family's movie library.

The first film is fine, nothing outstanding about it.  Only notable for Bob Newhart voice talent.

There are quite a few extras on the discs, nothing outstanding.  No Making of  for the first film but you would not need one really for this film since not the top of Disney films.

And, I have always wondered WHY WAS THE SEQUEL MADE?  Best part of that unnecessary sequel is having the late John Candy voice talent.  It was unnecessary, the first film was not a major hit, so why this sequel?

Now, Disney is now going cheap on blu ray packages.  For the last few years they have been bending over backwards  to promote blu rays, but here as they did with the Pocahontas package & Aristocats packages we get plain jane discs with no artwork on them.

I have always thought The Rescuers looked horribly bad on home video, from the VHS tapes to the DVD's, so I was very intrigued to see what this Blu-ray release would turn out. I was absolutely blown away by the level of quality showcased here! Crisp, clear, and beautifully rendered... The opening charcoal paintings in the credits have a real vibrancy to them, almost as if the viewer is looking at the original drawings. Bernard, Bianca, Penny, and the rest of these timeless characters literally jump off the screen, and I have no qualms saying that they have NEVER looked more alive than they do here on this release. I bought this title solely for this movie and I consider my money well spent. On to The Rescuers Down Under! Initially, I was more underwhelmed with this transfer than the original Rescuers. The overall picture looked bland and some scenes are not nearly as crisp as I saw in The Rescuers or other Disney Blu-ray releases. However, after viewing standard def 90s 'documentary' (featured as an extra on this release) on the making of this sequel, I realize what a stark upgrade the high definition transfer gives us! Yes, the palette is mostly in the realm of neutral colors with vibrant hues being a rare occurrence,  but I doubt the video quality will ever look better than it does here without a complete overhaul of the original source elements. The worst the film looks is in the first five to ten minutes. Once Bernard and Bianca are on their journey to Australia, the quality most certainly improves. If I were to give out ratings based solely on the visual appearance, The Rescuers gets 5/5 stars and its sequel, 3.5/5 stars. However, fans of either or both movies will not walk away unimpressed!

5131762,4,B0084IHVUC,"A substantial number of Disney animated feature debut on Blu-ray this Tuesday. One release, perhaps more than any other, stands as a crossroads between ""old school"" and ""next generation"" Disney animation: The Rescuers and The Rescuers Down Under.

When The Rescuers premiered in 1977, it was very well received but the public and the press, though things behind the scenes were getting tumultuous.

Based on Margery Sharp's book, The Rescuers follow two mice who rescue humans on behalf of their Rescue Aid Society (a group that co-exists behind the walls of the United Nations building).  Eva Gabor voices the lovely Bianca and Bob Newhart plays Bernard.

There's wonderful casting all the way around, harkening back to an era when Disney did enlist celebrities for the lead characters (who promoted the film on The Merv Griffin Show) and allow character actors and voice actors to round out the casts. Disney was still the name above the title and the studio had neither the budget nor the inclination to cast the multi-million-dollar variety of superstar often heard today in theatrical animation.

Times were simpler then, perhaps, and so is the film, which follows a very linear storyline as the mice board an albatross (voiced by longtime radio star Jim Jordan of Fibber McGee and Molly) and head for the bayou to rescue a little girl from Madame Medusa (the flamboyant Geraldine Page in her second Disney film) and her flunky Snoops (a caricature of Disney historian John Culhane voiced by Disney comedy veteran Joe Flynn in his only animated Disney role).

Not a musical, the film does have atmospheric songs performed offscreen by Shelby Flint, who hit the pop charts with ""Angel on My Shoulder"" and had become a very busy vocalist for TV shows, commercials and animation (Snoopy Come Home, Rankin/Bass' Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July, NBC's The Borrowers). An Oscar nomination for Best Song went to ""Someone's Waiting for You."" (Robie Lester fans take note: she is the singing voice of Bianca.)

But at the Disney studio, animators were becoming divided about artistic direction and Don Bluth was not pleased with what he saw as shortcuts on The Rescuers. Within a few years of this film, he would lead an artist walk out that impacted the next feature, The Fox and the Hound, the last feature to combine the talents of new and veteran animators.

You can also see this blend in The Rescuers -- masterful work by artists who worked with Walt and those that they mentored. Of course, the animation of Medusa is astounding, its roughness and energy captured in the sketchy, ""scritchy"" look of the xerox cel process. This a look didn't always suit the films in which it was used, but it works well here.

The Disney studio had never produced a sequel to any of its animated features before The Rescuers Down Under, but much had changed by 1990, including a new management team and transformations in corporate philosophies. But unlike some of the direct-to-video features that would emerge, this film boasts superior production values that actually exceed that of its predecessor.

Some of that sheen is due to rapid advances in computer technology, making specific settings, effects and animated objects more accessible. The CAPS system was perhaps the biggest develop to debut in The Rescuers Down Under. This eliminated the need for inked and painted animation cels -- the artwork went directly into the system for outline and color. Because of this, there is no breakdown in image quality (which could happen with layer upon layer of cels).

Eva Gabor and Bob Newhart are back as Bernard and Bianca, this time flown by a different albatross. Jim Jordan had passed away, so John Candy's voice added not only contemporary celebrity, but also a broader comedy potential and therefore appears in much more of the film as comic relief.

The biggest difference is that the villain is, this time around, not played at all for laughs, but completely evil and disturbingly unbalanced, brilliantly voiced by George C. Scott.

There are no songs at all in this sequel, though ""Rescue Aid Society"" is part of the underscore. Bruce Brougton's score is excellent -- and the recurring theme heard in his music is also used for the dancing fountain at the Epcot theme park.",1345161600,6,4276,4.938718662952646
5131763,4,B0084IHVUC,"Splendid Blu-Ray pairing of the 1977 Disney favorite ""The Rescuers"" - now celebrating its 35th Anniversary - with its underappreciated, beautifully drawn 1990 sequel ""The Rescuers Down Under"" has arrived on Blu-Ray in a BD/DVD Disney combo pack. The original ""Rescuers"" is a gentle kids animated feature - slight but still endearing - and the 1990 ""Down Under"" was noteworthy for being one of the last Disney animated efforts that would be made without songs for a number of years to come. It still has, musically, a brilliant score by Bruce Broughton, however, that ranks with his best, as well as some fleeting uses of computer animation. Both films look colorful and detailed in Disney's 1080p AVC encoded transfers, though it's clear neither was treated to the kind of digital restoration other films of their respective eras have been. Extras include, on ""The Rescuers,"" a deleted song, a bonus short (""Three Blind Mouseketeers""), and a 1990 vintage Making Of for the sequel.

I highly recommend this to any fan of Disney, but also to anyone who simply loves a story of friendship, bravery and commitment as these are all themes you can find in both movies!",1345075200,,638,4.369747899159663
5131765,2,B0084IHVUC,"I'm the world's number one fan of Disney's original 1977 classic ""The Rescuers,"" and anyone who knows me well can confirm that.  Naturally, when this Blu-ray/DVD set was announced I had some pretty high expectations.  The idea of the sequel being included together with the original film repulsed me from the start, but I was willing to forgive Disney's impertinence if they at least did a nice job presenting the original ""The Rescuers"" in high definition.  I was immediately skeptical following the rather mediocre ""restoration"" job done to ""The Fox and the Hound"" released for the first time on Blu-ray several months ago.  Understanding ""The Rescuers"" to be one of those unpolished jewels that Disney often forgets on the back shelf, I knew I had reason to worry.  Alas, my worries have all been confirmed here.

When Blu-ray came to be, it quickly became a synonym for dazzling, perfect picture quality and the ultimate home theater experience.  Unfortunately, a Blu-ray transfer cannot make miracles out of source material that is not properly cleaned, and no degree of high definition is going to cover up the film print's flaws.  Disney's first major mistake for ""The Rescuers"" (and assuming for ""The Fox and the Hound"" as well) was the very idea of deciding to perform a clean-up job on an old copy of the master print.  There's no fooling me; the print that Disney performed its laughable ""All-new digital restoration"" on is the same, used and abused print used for the 1999 VHS and 2003 DVD releases with some very basic touch-ups here and there.  Had they recycled their ""snappy new remastering"" claim, proudly presented on the back of the disastrous 2003 DVD, they would be avoiding genuine accusations of false advertising.  If Disney had intended for this to be the ultimate home video release for ""The Rescuers"" they would have taken the time to produce a fresh new copy straight from the original masters of the film and performed HD magic on that; unfortunately, there's not a trace of evidence of such effort.  One only needs to compare what is seen on these discs with material from 1977, or even 1983, both in film and in paper print, just to see a drastic difference in overall coloration.  The lack of balance in color makes the film appear ""stuffy"", over-saturated and just plain murky, robbing film-viewers of the pleasure of enjoying ""The Rescuers"" as it was meant to be enjoyed, with its original soft story-book color palette.  What we have instead is an obnoxious blue tint bathing the entire film, making Madame Medusa's face vary between pink and purple hues and two alligators with bottle-green eyes instead of bright canary yellow.  In terms of sharpness, the film appears much improved, though it hardly makes up for the serious flaws in colorization that downright ruin the entire film experience.  Early releases of Disney's ""Peter Pan,"" for example, suffered from similar flaws, but these were fortunately fixed for the 2006 DVD release, much to the annoyance of several Disney enthusiasts that don't understand color-correction to be an indispensable part of film restoration (and which in turn, corrects colors).  It seems Disney did not want to face their wrath here, and shame on them for that.  On the bright side, the audio sounds rather crisp, if nothing compared to the audio restoration jobs of other, much older films.  The French and Latin American Spanish dubs included on the set do sound catastrophic, I'm afraid, with proper artifact clean-up done only during the 'silent' parts and evidence of them throughout the speech parts.

In terms of bonus features, Disney has once again let everybody down.  Considering the complex production history of this particular title, it should not have been difficult to find tons of material from which to create a generous number of behind-the-scenes featurettes.  Heck, even one theatrical trailer or two would have sufficed, but those are also nowhere to be found.  A number of bonus features from the 2003 DVD release were brought back, though for some reason the most interesting one, the behind-the-scenes photo gallery, was dropped altogether, to be replaced with one of Louis Prima's (forgive me, horrid) songs, ""Peopleitis"", set to a collection of original artwork from one of those ""The Rescuers"" that never was (and thank goodness).  For those interested, Disney is planning to release a small collection of never-before heard songs intended from this film.  None of the songs have the appeal of the songs that Disney rightfully chose for the film in the end (""The Journey,"" ""Tomorrow Is Another Day""..), though an earlier version of ""Someone's Waiting for You"" entitled ""The Need to Be Loved"" performed by Jennifer Paz does sound promising.  Why Disney didn't include it as a bonus feature is beyond me.

As far as the sequel is concerned, I don't know and I frankly don't care.  When I originally purchased it on DVD I watched it one and a half times then forgot all about it on the shelf.  When I finally got rid of it I had no intention of replacing it, so naturally, being charged extra here for a film I do not want on top of a poor job done on the film I do want, well, hardly makes me smile.

I'm one of those people who prefer DVD packaging to Blu-ray packaging, so that's the edition I chose.  Consumers of that packaging option will be annoyed to discover that all three discs are held together by one single plastic knot, increasing the risk of scratching and mishandling.  I know that similar packaging was an issue for ""The Fox and the Hound"", so it's just great to see that Walt Disney Home Entertainment really cares about their consumers.

Is it worth upgrading from the previous 2003 DVD release?  Most certainly.  The new edition on Blu-ray is far from perfect, but it comes considerably closer than most of the previous home video releases (the 1992 VHS is still the most accurate when it comes to proper color presentation.  The picture has been cleared of the vast majority of artifacts and imperfections, though some still flicker occasionally from time to time and there's evidence of grain left during some scenes.  The brightness and contrast levels are a bit off throughout the film, causing some of the more vivid colors to either look pale or appear as if ready to bleed out, and finally, the level of HD sharpness could have been improved.  Though the film is a product of the studio's ""sketchy"" xerox period, sharper outlines would have reduced that effect to be far more visually appealing.  The worst is, as I have addressed before, the incorrect color hues seen throughout the film.  These were off in all previous releases, particularly those in 1999 and 2003, and have not been corrected.  Still, the overall presentation is a major improvement from any previous release in just about every sense.  The new edition drops the picture gallery, the ""Under the Hat: Villains"" clip and the dull 'set-top game.'  Disney's True-Life Adventure: Water Birds has been kept and a much cleaner print is offered this time, though the Silly Symphonies short appears as it did before, I believe.  All in all, yes, this new edition is a sure improvement, but still far, far from perfection.

I lost faith on this release quickly and my fears have been confirmed.  In spite of my many weeks of preparation for this major let-down, however, I can't help but feel extremely cheated.  I've invested in Disney in many ways: films, books, travel, theatrical releases, you name it, the fact that they don't value me enough to hand me a proper edition of my all-time favorite Disney film is hurtful.  Fortunately, I can drift away from Disney products from now-on and feel like I can stay true to that choice, and at the same time, not feel like I'm missing out on anything worth-while.  It's a shame that this will likely be the last physical media release for ""The Rescuers"" because it is hardly any less dismal than its previous home video releases.  It really is a shame.",1344988800,44,7987,4.853982300884955

Everything clicks in this movie, from the animation to the dialog to the music to the comedic timing. And don't forget the phenomenal cast, which includes the much missed John Candy and George C. Scott!
Seriously, this is a template for how to put an animated feature together, as there are no missteps here. It's a brilliant project all the way around, and serves as a perfect example of a film that can appeal to everyone.",1344384000,,572,4.457142857142857
