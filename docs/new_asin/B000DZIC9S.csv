If I were still a 6th grade science classroom teacher, I might use it to introduce a new topic to the class in a interesting-to-kids way.  As a homeschooling mom now, I was looking for an alternative to reading a list of geologic and tectonic definitions for my kids.

We watched about 10 topics at a stretch with my 2 sixth graders and 1 second grader for a homeschool activity.  My not-a-fan-of-science sixth grader learned a few terms and understood it well.  My exceptional science-minded sixth grader expanded on the topics for the rest of the family. My second grader was interested because it was a cartoon.

We stopped the dvd after each definition to check for understanding, expand on the info, or critique the info.  It was worth it for us because we laughed at the bad animation.  If you are a creationist, you will probably not like the video.  We are old earth Christians and had no problem with it.

My biggest disappointment about the video was the poor visual graphics.  A video should use visuals to help explain (time line, map, animation, etc) and interest the kids.  Too much of this was silly cartoon characters talking to each other with big science words, too little was helpful illustrations.",1419897600,,1495,4.67816091954023
8103009,1,B000DZIC9S,"This Squibs video is terrible. The cartoon is very poorly done. It doesn't explain the topics well. You can't even really understand what they are trying to explain. A much better choice would be: Greatest Discoveries With Bill Nye: Earth Sciences. Bill Nye's video was excellent with amazing graphics, interviews with experts, and clear detailed explanations. This Squibs video is a waste of time.",1350432000,,398,5.234375
8103010,4,B000DZIC9S,"If you want your child (and probably yourself!) to be challenged by an educational science video, this is the series to get.  Squibs covers detailed concepts and terminology from a wide range of sciences.  I am reasonably well versed in the sciences, yet I learned new facts right along with the kids.

The Squibs producer don't pull any punches when it comes to providing correct information and terminology.  In fact, unlike many other science videos for kids that I've watched, I have yet to see inaccurate information in any of the Squibs videos.

The only negative aspect I see on these shows are some of the songs themselves.  In an effort to diversify the music and connect with modern music, some of the songs are hard to understand and feel disjointed.  One complaint I have seen is that the videos gloss over too much information to be useful.  One reviewer stated, ""It attempts to cover an entire textbook or two of material in seconds"".  This is a valid concern although I think misguided.  It does indeed cover a large amount of information in a short time, but it is not intended to be used in a vacuum.  Books, games, discussions, and repetition are critical to help your kids understand what has just been presented.  No video alone can teach them all they need to know about science.

Despite being a bit over their heads, my children (age 5 and 8) love these shows and watch them whenever they can.  They enjoy them, but most importantly, they are learning and remembering.

Yes, it's complex; yes, it's challenging; and yes, you may occasionally feel stupid watching it; but if the show doesn't challenge your kids to think and learn, what's the point of watching?",1183420800,,1683,4.715753424657534
