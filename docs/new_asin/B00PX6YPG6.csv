6824866,4,B00PX6YPG6,"Hyapatia Lee was, in my opinion, one of the most exotically beautiful women to ever do adult films. Being 1/4 Cherokee shows in her brown eyes and long, raven-haired tresses. In 'Ribald Tales of Canterbury', she has 3 scenes, a girl-on-girl, a three-way and a sensual tryst with Mike Horner. Set in the Middle Ages, the whole thing drags on a bit, as Hyapatia invites her fellow travelers to relate their most erotic tales. But the costumes and sets were well done for an x-rated romp. 'Tasty Tastums' was a little better, since it was set in modern times (at least at the time it was filmed). It was fascinating to see some people who were on the cusp of stardom, including Peter North and Mike Horner. The interview with Lee's hubby, Bud Lee, was also interesting. Vinegar Syndrome did a good job with this. The transfer is relatively clean, with some of the more darkly lit scenes having a bit of a grainy look. But all in all, an enjoyable 'flashback' to the golden age of adult films. Back when movies like this were shot on film (not video), and female performers had yet to desecrate themselves with multiple piercings, tattoos and other nonsense.",1422748800,108,1154,4.634146341463414

6824868,5,B00PX6YPG6,"I really enjoyed this movie for it was all that I thought it woulld be and more.  I think too many times Hollywood censers movies because of sex, but this is exactly what this is all about and I am glad we as adults and can view it.  We can watch a lot of horror, violence, and unspeakable crimes but when it comes to love making, we are simply too prudish.  Well enough of this.  As adutlt, we have the right to view such things and if you don't like it, then don't watch it!  But the film is great!!!!!",1336608000,8,504,4.0
6824869,5,B00PX6YPG6,This film was my introduction to hardcore sex. It was very funny and entertaining but at the same time the sex was scorching hot. Yeah it was made in the 70's but they do things in this title that due to aids and unexpected pregnancies they don't allow anymore. In other words it's bareback unprotected sex. That's what makes this a taboo and rare title. When you watch this movie you can't help but to laugh at how stupid it really is. But any guy over 30 will remember Ribald very well. Hyapatia Lee is one of those classic pornstars but you will find that she is very hot. I cannot describe what happens in the scenes due to it's graphic content. But if you have a classic XXX collection this film is essenrial!,1191888000,3,714,4.335820895522388

6824875,5,B00PX6YPG6,"Adapted from Geoffrey Chaucers Canterbury Tales In which pilgrims engage in a game of storytelling to pass the time, our Hostess, embodied by the radiant Hyapatia Lee, is offering a purse full of coins to the traveler that can spin the most delicious yarn on their journey to Canterbury. This serves as the McGuffin to frame a series of sexy vignettes as we watch each tale of debauchery come to life.

The film also features Lady of Bath Colleen Brennan and her luscious gumdrop nipples, Mike Horner in his pre-gurning days as The Knight and Debra Lynn, who is stunningly beautiful as the Young Abbot. Hyapatia Lee is a natural leader as The Hostess, while she beguiles with her dancing prowess and aptitude on violin as the love-torn Gypsy.

The supper scene at the millers home is particularly memorable. I hadnt known that you could eat in double entendre. The scene in which The Abbot gives her virginity to The Knight is touching. His adoration for her, her trust of him, coupled with the perfectly suited music is pure sweetness. The finale between the hostess and The Knight is also lovely.

The care and money that went into this film is unheard of in todays adult industry. The cast, costumes, sets, music and performances are amazing. Watching it, I was transported and felt I was tagging along with the travelers journeying to Canterbury.

This film is perfect for couples wanting a sexy transportive experience. It is romantic and naughty, but not dirty.

The sound is rendered in clear mono. The extras on this DVD include a wonderful interview with director Bud Lee, as well as his commentary. A free bonus feature is also included. What a bargain!

It is Tasty. Hyapatia plays a radio personality on a failing radio station. I assume it was inspired by the television show WKRP in Cincinnati. The stressed-out boss of the station lashes out at his DJs, threatening them with termination. Faced with certain doom, they decide to go for broke and do everything that they always dreamed of doing ON AIR. Sexcapades ensue and the ratings skyrocket. This is a silly, but fun film that has some very hot and sexy scenes.

I recommend this DVD to anyone who loves escapist entertainment. The film is exquisitely constructed. Looking at the credits, they poured their hearts into it. I just looked at the credits for The Force Awakens nearly 2,000 people worked on that film! This film had about 40.

Note: [The film is rated X; whatever that means. The sex scenes feature total nudity, head to toe (as they should, [smile]) penetration and cum shots abound. Maybe it got an X rather than a XXX because the sex scenes are only about 50% of the film. I seem to recall, that back in the 1980s, when I was a kid, the MPAA changed X to NC-17 and XXX was assigned to hardcore videos. I direct you to the insightful and disturbing documentary This Film Is Not Yet Rated, for more information on ratings. After you watch it you won't know anything more about how films are rated, but at least youll be frightened!]",1489968000,3,3015,4.675471698113207

6824885,4,B00PX6YPG6,"I'm ambivalent about rating Ribald Tales of Canterbury.  On the one hand, it's XXX pornography and somewhat mediocre as pure porn.  On the other hand, it is a gem within its genre especially in comparison to the stuff that litters the Internet today.  It has a real plot, of sorts, derived from Chaucer's Canterbury Tales with good writing, settings, set dressing, and cinematography to support a cast among whom many are quite skillful actors.  Its real value is its role as an example of a bygone historical era when even pornography producers took pride in their work, unfettered by the endless stream of potboiler political tracts that spew out of Hollywood today.",1480464000,7,668,4.9375

I bought this primarily because I wanted a film with Hyapatia Lee before her entry into serious acting and because I was curious about the treatment they would give The Canterbury Tales. It is perfectly adequate adult entertainment but I, personally, would not rank it in the top five of my favorite adult DVDs. Still it provides what you bought it to see. It does NOT contain the kinds of scenes common in contemporary adult movies which I I find distasteful, but which I won't discuss here at the risk of being called a bigot or a fill-in-the-blank-phobe. The movie leaves one unanswered question: How did a gnarled old gnome like Bud Lee ever catch a hottie like Hyapatia?",1473984000,2,863,4.574193548387097

The plot loosley follows Chaucers work, a group of travelers on pilgrimage decide to tell stories along the way to pass the time.  These stories are erotic and sexual and well done.

You can also tell that the actors really tried to learn their lines and tried to act (to the best of their ability).  This appears to be a sign of a Hypatia Lee film and I can deal with that. happily.

Yes, you had to watch 70's hairstyles but they tried to fit that in with the costumes and it worked.  Plus it was nice to see pubic hair and natural breasts again.  The modern shaved-&-implant actresses make one forget what a woman really looks like.
