The series is definitely aimed at 12-15 year old boys, and it resonated at a time when americans were arguably more patriotic than they are today (at least judging by mass media coverage and the series you see on tv today).  Highly recommended.",1374278400,2,368,4.5606060606060606
8150007,4,B000JD0K1C,"I've been trying to find the early TV program called Jet Jackson. I finally found it under the Capitan Midnight moniker. I had to revive my VCR because I've only found it on tape, I could not find it on DVD. It sure brought back memories of sitting in front of the Westinghouse black and white TV on a Saturday morning in 1956. The ony problem is their are only two episodes. Please bing back Jet Jackson on DVD.",1296000000,4,412,4.227848101265823
