7960999,5,B000065HVX,"A brilliant and often misunderstood cautionary tale of forbidden love. It's a great movie if you just pay attention to the dialogue and suspend any prejudice up front. Yes, what Humbert does is WRONG but the details of the story, at least give you a glimpse into the WHY of it all. In this story the details matter. There is a Monster in this movie but I won't spoil it.",1471651200,,370,4.3
