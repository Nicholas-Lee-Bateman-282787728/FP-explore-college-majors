7800733,5,1632505886,"I was pleased to see that the material was exactly as stated. Not an exhaustive reference tome, but a basic how to, well demo-ed, with the addition of tricks learned over a thirty year period of using the equipment. It introduced me to burrs and other tools I had yet to use, in a way I could understand. Thanks, Andy!",1503964800,,318,4.316666666666666

7800735,5,1632505886,"Andy is Creative, Talented, Funny and very knowledgeable educator.  That is why a DVD about a flex shaft was so enjoyable.  After watching this video you either want to get on the internet and buy one or rush to you studio to blow of all the dust on the flex shaft you bought years ago and start using it the way it is meant to be used.  Go back and push that buy button and get one is these ""Bad Boys""it is worth your time and money. Also check out Andy's website and learn more.",1481328000,2,480,4.031578947368421
