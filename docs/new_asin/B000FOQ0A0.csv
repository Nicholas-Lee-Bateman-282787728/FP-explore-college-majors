2580718,5,B000FOQ0A0,I saw this Alan Jackson performance on CMT along with my wife. I told her she could hire Alan to sing at my funeral. These are great gospel songs performed by one of my favorite country stars. I think it is a must have for every country music fan.,1242345600,5,247,4.061224489795919
2580719,5,B000FOQ0A0,"Most country stars who have reached superstardom reach for a genre that is dear to them, and in this case, Alan Jackson had been asked often by his mother to do gospel music.  After his father died, he presented his mother with a gift on Christmas morning, a CD of music from their roots.  Released in 2006, it is a gift to all who love the deep rich voice of Jackson and those who cherish music like no other, gospel music.

You will hear interviews with his wife Denise and her mother, and also Alan's mother.  We get an invitation to his home in Newnan Georgia, and chat with his sisters.  The musical Jackson family in Newnan performs a tune at the gravesite of his father.  Included is a performance with some family members.

The selections here are recognizable to the average gospel listener with the Old Rugged Cross and In the Garden, two of the most popular gospel songs ever written.  Jackson wrote I Want to Stroll Over Heaven With You, for his mother who will one day meet his father in Heaven.

The selections are:  Blessed Assurance;  In the Garden; I Love To Tell The Story; Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus; 'Tis So Sweet To Trust In Jesus;

When We All Get To Heaven; Softly And Tenderly; Standing On the Promises; Are You Washed In the Blood/I'll Fly Away; What A Friend We Have In Jesus.

Leaning On the Everlasting Arms; The Old Rugged Cross; How Great Thou Art. I recommend the companion CD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Precious-Memories/dp/B000E6UJP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Precious Memories</a>.
