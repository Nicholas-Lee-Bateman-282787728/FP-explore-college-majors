2934013,5,B000V9KER4,"Im such a big fan of Kellie Martin and its because of films like this. Having seen most of Kellie's films, this one is in my top 5. She shines in this film, along with the entire cast. I wish it went on for longer. The acting and story are brilliant in this picture and you are engaged for every minute of it. Highly recommended for amazon customers.

8217415,5,B000V9KER4,I think Kellie Martin is such a great actress. All the actors are very good but she really shines in this movie. This poignant and touching story emphasizes the importance of maintaining family relationships through everything you experience in life. It is a very realistic story and Mary Steenburgen does a masterful job in her portrayal of a mentally challenged mother. The secret that is revealed near the end provides a fitting conclusion to this special story. This is an excellent movie that all the family can enjoy.,1489708800,,523,4.954545454545454
8217416,5,B000V9KER4,"Bought for someone else, as I don't ""go in"" for this drama crap. However, she loved the movie, and I had been trying to find it for her for a long time. She got it. She watched, and continues to re-watch it, and she is happy. Thus, I am happy. Also, she never tried to force me to watch it, so I did not have to gouge my eyeballs our of their sockets with a K-Bar.

8217417,4,B000V9KER4,"An inspiring and yet heart-wrenching movie about having a mom and with a low IQ. It shows what can happen when the primary care dies and the daughter is now forced to become her own mom's caretaker, just as she is getting ready to start working to her own dreams. This movie takes you on a roller coaster of emotions as the mother and daughter struggle to figure out how to cope.",1457827200,,379,4.277777777777778
