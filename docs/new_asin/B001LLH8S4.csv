3685014,5,B001LLH8S4,"This was an entertaining and moving film built around a well developed and unpredictable story. Spike reminded the world of the sacrifices and contributions made by African American soldiers during WWII in a clever, compelling, and dignity affirming way. You'd have to sleep through half of the film to miss the connection between the opening and closing segments. Beyond that, if you don't like Spike Lee, if you have no clue what the word ""miracle"" means, or if you spend too much effort critiquing the type of pavement on the roads in the film - you might not like it. Otherwise, most people will enjoy this film.",1233532800,18,616,4.766355140186916
3685015,5,B001LLH8S4,"Awesome and deeply moving! A true and real ""miracle"". I can't wait to purchase the dvd!",1233100800,8,87,4.5
3685016,1,B001LLH8S4,"Miracle at St Anna? Not really. The only miracle will be if you manage to sit through the whole movie.

SPOILERS:

The story is a mess, it's convoluted,  you will keep waiting for a resolution to some of the questions raised, but the answers never come.  Who was it that he shot in the post office?  Did the boy have some kind of super natural power?  Did the stone head? What was the miracle?  How could you miss your target with a shouldered Thompson smg at 10 yards?  How can you shoot 1000 rounds from a 30 round Thompson mag, maybe that was the miracle?  How come the giant couldn't lift that skinny barn beam without rubbing the head?  And the ending was just plain goofy, the little boy is a seatbelt tycoon? Great.

The ""shaky"" camera technique should not be noticeable, When it is appropriate then it blends in and you don't even consciously notice it.  Sticks out like a sore thumb in this film.

The music is poorly done.  Movie soundtracks should not distract from the images on the screen. When you are pulled out of what you are looking at to wonder why the music seems odd it's not a good thing!  It's supposed to add to the experience, not be detrimental to it.

The acting was pretty good, but the dialog was questionable at best and not appropriate to the time period.  But it's the story, the writing, the plot, that ruins this movie.  Just to much stuff started and never finished, it's almost as if half the movie is missing.

And one goof that pulled me out of the film for few minutes was a scene at a railroad crossing, the surface of the road at the crossing was clearly modern and not appropriate to the 1940's.",1232496000,13,1637,4.360927152317881
3685017,2,B001LLH8S4,"One of Spike's worst, I'm sorry to say. I was looking forward to seeing it, especially after the dust up when Spike decided to take Clint Eastwood to task over not showing any Black marines on Iwo. Now it seems Spike was just selling wolf tickets to promote his film. This effort barely holds together. And the little fairy tale ending doesn't help at all. Neither do all the cliched close up shots of Nazi insignia and uniforms with heavy music playing in the background. What a mess. Too bad.",1232150400,13,494,4.5

3685028,3,B001LLH8S4,"Not bad, but not good either. With all the political correctness about minorities needing to be represented in modern movies about WW1 or WW2, Spike Lee comes to the rescue and attempts to patch the hole. Although it is honorable to give tribute to black men that saw action in WW2, it is overplayed and exaggerated, like that stupid movie about the Tuskegee boys (Red Tails, or something?). The hard truth is that there were only a FEW black units that saw combat in the entire war. The US army did not see blacks as being capable to fight cohesively as whites (much less mix with them). Most blacks served in rear-echelon positions, like transportation, logistics, cleaning off battlefields, identifying and claiming bodies, handling supplies, distributing rations and ammo to the white units, etc. There were a handful of black units that fought, and it was primarily in Italy ;44-45. Their stories deserve to be told, but I can think of others that could do better than Lee.",1501372800,,978,4.8273809523809526

3685071,2,B001LLH8S4,"I waited a long time to see this film. I should have kept waiting. I don't think I missed a thing.
After a lifetime spent reading military history and talking at length with WW II veterans, I believe that the US Army infantry divisions engaged in combat in WW II were manned by dedicated soldiers who served their country honorably and well, very much at the daily risk of their lives. I see no reason to modify this statement with regard to the black men who filled the ranks of the 92nd in Italy.
Unfortunately, the filmmaker saw fit to incorporate just about every possible cliche and inaccuracy he could think of into this film. In the first place, deciding to go strolling across a stream in broad daylight within arm's reach of each other, with defenders hidden on the other side invites disaster. One of the few things this film got right was the effectiveness of a German gun crew with an MG 42. Secondly, who in their right mind  would carry around a sixty pound marble head of a statue suspended from a cartridge belt ? At a glance, a squad leader would have ordered this
thing discarded the moment he noticed it .Fans of this film should strap the head of a statue to their own belts and see just how far they get  through their daily routines before they give up.
A German officer preventing his men from murdering a wounded enemy is one thing. How likely would he really be to hand him a loaded weapon and turn his back on him ? Then there's Renata, the source of much interest in this film. At some point she's outdoors doing laundry. During a conversation with one of the protagonists she abruptly removes her top and proceeds to finish her task half - naked. I'm sure this sort of thing happened often during the war....... As a matter of fact, a close relative of mine was in the Fifth Army in Italy from the landing at Salerno until the German surrender. Most of the women he described to me were barrel - shaped grandmothers who reeked of woodsmoke and olive oil. Of course this reality would not have created the impression the filmmaker sought. There is also the matter of high fives, vocabulary that wouldn't be heard for decades, weapons slung across the chest with the muzzles down, thirty shot Thompson Submachine guns firing sixty second bursts, the complete absence of Browning Automatic Rifles, etc. I could go on.
In the face of great adversity, a majority of the black Americans  in the 92 Infantry Division served their country with distinction. The survivors deserved to see their story related realistically, and with respect. In this, I believe the filmmaker failed..
Judging by this film's commercial and critical reception, it appears that I have plenty of company.
Two stars for the location shooting in Italy.",1447113600,5,2747,4.625

Excellent movie with great music from The Who and many punk and disco 70's hits set against a gritty New York background. Its a true story and horrific in its time. EVERYONE was scared to leave their house back in the 70's when the killings were going on. It also coincided with the great black out when all hell broke loose and it was hotter then hell when all the power went dead in the entire city making it even scarier that a psycho was on the loose.

3685108,5,B001LLH8S4,"Count me among those who really liked this film set in the Italian theatre in World War II.

Yes, some of the dialog doesn't fit the time.  (This is a frequent weakness of all films set in the past.)  Yes, the screenplay indulged some current digs (partisans or terrorists?).  Yes, some scenes are improbable.  Yes, there are some cardboard figures.

These shortcomings are, however, more than offset by the film's pluses.  It gives visibility to the role of African-Americans troops in the Second World War, especially the 92nd Infantry Division.  Young Americans need to know that in the American south, German POWs could eat in segregated restaurants while African-American soldiers could not.  There are some gestures to the hold of tradition in rural Italy -- old legends, old superstitions.  How the arrival of African-Americans discombobulated Europeans who expected Americans to be white - was handled nicely.  I appreciated how the film did not make fun of the religiosity of ""PFC Train,"" the ""Chocolate Giant,"" played by Omar Benson Miller.

""Miracle at St. Anna"" opens as a crime film, but shifts back to the Italian campaign of World War II to explain the motives behind the unexpected murder in a New York post office.  There's a nice suspense as viewers, caught up in the story of the fighting in Italy, try to figure out which soldier will be the one to pull the trigger decades later.  And the final scene is emotional, indeed full of ""wonder,"" which is, I suppose, another word for ""miracle.""

3685137,5,B001LLH8S4,"As some others have said about the 1-star reviews, I don't know what movie they watched because it wasn't the one I watched.

But we see two major errors in the negative reviews. So let's deal with them.

1) ""all the white people are racist""
This is so wrong it's amazing that anyone could claim it. The entire film revolves around the caring, even loving, relationships between white and black characters. Yes, there are some white racists. It's the 1940s.
But let's go group by group.

US Military Officers: we have roughly 3.

First, there is the idiot racist junior officer who is immediately in charge of the main characters. He's the kind of man who refuses to believe what the troops on the ground say because they don't fit his mental understanding of what ""has to be the truth"". He also refuses to let there be any response to his orders. Yes, he's white and he's doing this to black troops. But this type of character exists in hundreds of war movies, and sends people to their deaths through their idiocy regardless of color, what war, what time in history.
Because these people exist, and untold thousands of men have died because of their mental defects.

Second, there is the brief appearance by a high-ranking officer who understands the situation and treats the black characters with respect. This character appears in countless films as well.

Third, the MPs in the flashback to basic training in Mississippi. They attempt to prevent the conflict between the black soldiers and white shop-owner from escalating to violence. Let's call them neutral.

Second, Nazis: we have a Nazi officer who commits atrocities and those who follow the orders to do so. We also have a Nazi officer and Nazi soldier who are critical to the miracle and subsequent acts. Saying too much would involve spoilers.

Third, Italian Partisans: again, good and bad, and the difference is critical to the film.

Fourth, Italian Civilians: the central relationship of the movie is one between a black soldier and a white civilian. Most of the rest of the Italians show nothing but positivity (or more) to the black soldiers. Again, there is a special, critical link between the black soldiers and the Italians that is very important but not going to spoil things.

Fifth, US Civilians: There are those in the basic training flashback, who are typical racists for the most part. It's Mississippi in the 1940s. Then there are those who appear in the ""current"" time of the initial event. They are eager to do their job and show no concern about color. We even have a black woman put a white man with authority in his place, and he takes it.

2) the ""over-sexed Negro"" stereotype.
Again, this is just wrong, and it is due to failure to consider the range of characters.

We have a group of young men in a new place. I can tell you with the utmost certainty that, regardless of color or anything else, a group of young men in a new place will include some who are looking for sexual relationships with new women. Many groups of men go to new places solely for this purpose. Many businesses and events exist primarily to facilitate the interaction of young men with women, and they make most of their money from the young men who are eager to pay for access to women.

Now such a group of young men will very often feature two types who come into conflict. There is the nice guy, who wants to win over the woman by showing her respect and being realistic about their situation. He will also usually try to maintain group cohesion to a considerable effort.

Then we have the young man who will make it his primary mission to get the woman. He will say whatever it takes, do whatever he can, to get her. He will push aside the nice guy. He will abandon the group. What he wants is the woman. It does not matter who the woman is. I have seen a friend gently stroking the arm of another friend's 60-something mother with a cast on her leg, in front of her husband, her brother, her son, and a bunch of his friends. When he left, we all looked around to say ""Did you just see what I saw?"" Yes, we did all see it.

When Mr Raging Hormones gets the woman, the nice guy is angry at him, especially if he was essentially knocked out of the way. The nice guy is often more angry or disgusted at the woman. Either she was too foolish to see through the sex-hound's blandishments, or she saw them and accepted them.

No ""over-sexed Negro"", just the dynamics of groups of young men with regard to women.

Now let's think about film-making and stereotypes. A film is short. Miracle at St Anna is 160 minutes and that's long. The more characters a film has, the less time there is to spend on each of them. It is impossible to give every secondary, tertiary, there-for-a-few-seconds, character a unique complex personality. The result is that some characters must serve as a function, as a role, not as true characters, as individuals. The result will be that some characters are stereotypes.

If this were an epic Band of Brothers type production, maybe we'd have fewer stereotypes. But even in Band of Brothers, David Schwimmer's idiot officer is the same person as the idiot officer in St Anna. He just got promoted out of combat duty. I'm sure we could go through the holy Saving Private Ryan and find a list of stereotypes as well. Did anyone think that Private Ryan, once found, would say ""Great! Get me out of here!"" instead of ""No way, I will fulfill my duty.""? No, that's not what the noble soldier does.

But even in an epic-length production, we must remember that there is truth to some stereotypes. How many of us can say that there is no aspect of ourselves that is stereotypical of something: our age, our occupation, our gender, our race, our physical appearance?

To get to the positive: This film is entirely about the complex relationships between black men and white men and women in a life-and-death situation in a foreign nation. The love between a black soldier and an Italian civilian is the central relationship in the film. The steps that a black man will take to avenge the evils done by white men motivate the telling of the tale.

Black men treat white people as having supernatural spiritual powers. White people treat black men in the same way. We are dealing with miracles, and with people who believe in them. There is more, but we will avoid spoilers.

But this film is ultimately about the care and love between black men and white men that transcends status and time.

And there is one scene that is so heartbreaking that it brings tears to my eyes whenever I remember it, and it is powerful enough that it comes to my mind unbidden often enough that I had to buy this film several years after first seeing it. The moment would not go away, and should not go away.

Those who see only stereotypes or nitpick at errors about what sayings or actions were in the film that were not common in the WW2 era are missing things that are so much more important that I feel sorry for them.

See and feel the relationships, and find the miracles. They are there.",1390780800,14,7054,4.5485398579321235

Although I usually don't care about war movies, this one get my attention and feelings. The story is a kind of tale, which is not usual in Spike Lee's flimo. The question of War is asked, on the opposite of a lot of other war movies for which war is just evidence; the Buffalo Soldiers, rarely evoqued, are focused here, and we could see how they are used

When I watch a movie, I like to be entertained and I don't think critically about a movie that is to be viewed for entertainment purposes.  If I want to watch a movie that is meant to make me think, I watch a documentary.
Now, on to the movie.  Spike Lee tells a story about a group of black men who were separated from their all black battalion and end up travelling to a small town in Italy set during WWII.  The story has its typical stereotypes of black men: The player, the smart one, the sensitive one, the sensible leader and the dumb one.  Of course they all clash, one falls in love, another seduces her, and so on.  The interesting part of the movie is the little boy who travels with them and becomes the center of the movie.
Spike Lee does what he does very well, he tells an interesting story set within a troubling time in America's history and includes an aspect that makes you feel for the characters.

3685203,5,B001LLH8S4,"I'll admit, Spike Lee is far from my favorite filmmaker. I like 'she's gotta have it' and 'Clockers' but was never taken with his later films like 'Summer Of Sam' and 'Inside Man'. 'Miracle at St Anna' has not only made me a fan again but it's easily one of the best films that I've seen concerning war and the impact it has on people.

Starting with a murder in the 1980's, 'Miracle at St Anna' flashes back to a group of four Buffalo Soldiers during World War II. After an attack by the German's (and a disastrous call by their ignorant captain) soldiers Stamps, Cummings, Negron and Train end up behind enemy lines in Italy. Train finds a young Italian boy named Angelo and the soldiers take him to nearby village that's being exploited by both sides of the war. The characters find a sort of solace between enemy lines but of course the village has problems of it's own. This may sound typical and maybe heavy-handed but there's even MORE going on in this film than it seems. Eveything plays out in a sort of dream-like quality with some episodic moments that're both fascinating and engaging. Spike Lee's usual themes of racism and prejudice are in full-swing but they are only a few of the many elements at work.

While the flash-forwards in the 1980's are filled with star-named actors like John Leguizamo, John Turturro and Joseph Gordan-Levitt it's really the lesser known actors in the WWII flashbacks that stand out. Derek Luke, Laz Alonso, Michael Ealy, and Omar Benson Miller as the four soldiers are exceptional. In fact I'm not really sure what the point was to the 1980's story, though it definitly grabs your attention at the beginning. I realize it was part of the original novel (by the screen writer James Mcbride) and the ending is quite moving, I'm just not sure how necessary it was.

Like I said, 'Miracle at St Anna' is an excellent cinematic experience and is easily my favorite of Spike Lee's films to date. I know a lot of people are harping on this movie for being inaccurate to history or having characters and situations that seem larger than life. To me they just added to the experience and when there are this many engaging elements to a film and it's pulled off so well by a talented filmmaker I honestly didn't care.

3685207,3,B001LLH8S4,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

  While the history of the African-American combat soldiers in World War II has been told before (for example Danny Glover's 1997 TV Movie ""Buffalo Soldiers""), it's a subject that's well worth being told from a new and fresh perspective. So here Spike Lee has decided to adapt Jame McBride's book which tells the story of the four black 'Buffalo Soldiers' of the 92nd Infantry Division, stuck inside an Italian town behind German lines during World War II.

  The idea that the protagonist, Hector Negron, has been waiting for years working inside the post office in New York City, with a gun at his side, hoping that one day the Italian partisan who betrayed him and his unit and all the Italian people he had befriended during the war, would simply walk in and ask to buy some stamps, seems quite far-fetched. In the book, Negron has the gun for protection but even if that were the case, wouldn't one of his co-workers have noticed that the gun was there in all the years he was working at the post office? Even worse is all the time wasted on introducing the reporter and the police detective who are investigating the shooting. All we really needed was to show the shooting, cut to the detective interviewing Negron for a about a minute and then flashback to the war.

  Spike Lee never tires in reminding us of the extent of the discrimination suffered by the black soldiers in World War II by their commanding officers. I didn't find it unbelievable that the racist officer Nokes would order artillery fire on the Buffalo soldiers' position simply because he couldn't believe that the soldiers were capable of making it to the other side of the river despite being surrounded by a whole slew of Germans. By the same token, it wasn't unreasonable to believe that the Germans would broadcast propaganda toward the black soldiers through a loudspeaker during the battle. Lee wants us to see the irony as the Germans remind the black soldiers that they're fighting for a government who treats them like second class citizens. But why does Lee focus on the propaganda broadcast for so long? We get the point in the first thirty seconds but it just goes on and on; one gets the impression that Lee revels in driving the point home despite adding unnecessary minutes to the narrative.

  Another example of Spike Lee overkill is the flashback to the diner a year before down south. The flashback is in two parts. The first part is the good one where we see the four Buffalo soldiers being told to eat out back by the racist store owner as four German POW's are chowing down in plain view. But then Lee undermines that excellent sequence by having the Buffalo soldiers return, point their weapons at the store owner and ask for him to serve them. Just like Tarantino who fulfills an adolescent need for revenge by having Hitler unrealistically killed in 'Inglourious Basterds', Lee does the same thing here, with the full knowledge that in real life, the Buffalo soldiers would have been court-martialed or even worse, ended up lynched for threatening a white store owner.

  Some have said that Spike Lee is hypocritical after his denunciation of the James Coffey prisoner character in the movie 'The Green Mile'. Lee coined the term ""the magical Negro"", defined in Wikipedia as ""a supporting, sometimes mystical stock character in fiction who, by use of special insight or powers, helps the white protagonist get out of trouble."" The magical Negro is ""in some way outwardly or inwardly disabled, either by discrimination, disability or social constraint."" And isn't that what Private Samuel Train is? He's a simpleton who sacrifices himself for the young white protagonist, Angelo. While I thought the child actor who plays the young boy was quite good, was it all that necessary to have him refer to Train as the 'chocolate soldier' ad nauseum? There comes a point when 'cute' becomes 'obnoxious'.

  The middle of the 'Miracle' gets bogged down with a series of slow-moving scenes including Train's interactions with the boy, the soldiers' discussions with the Italian villagers and the extensive machinations of the partisans. Although probably anachronistic, I did enjoy Bishop's conflict with Cummings which involved the issue of black collaboration with whites. Bishop's position, which advocates that progress has been made by blacks via-a-vis a white racist society, was probably more reflective of the 1940s than Cummings' militant viewpoint, which basically advocated separatism and sounded like it came from someone who was active in the 1960s and beyond. Bishop and Cummings also come to blows over the Italian woman, Renata, which is another way in which Lee attempts to 'humanize' his characters. One truism is revealed: women will take 'bad boys' over 'ordinary guys' any day.

  Lee's penchant for 'balance' may give the wrong impression about the German soldier in World War II. They were just as bad in regards to committing atrocities as the specialized 'Nazi' units. Yes there could have been a 'good' German office such as Eicholz, the former English teacher and the deserter Han Brandt, who ended up saving Angelo, but they were the exception to the rule. And even many so-called ""good"" Germans agreed in principle that the Jewish people were less than sub-human and needed to be segregated, deported or even eliminated in one way or another. One thing is certain: Eicholz handing his own gun over to Negron at the film's denouement would never have happened.

  'Miracle' could have been a good film with extensive editing as well as Lee's toning down of all the heavy-handed moralizing. It also wouldn't have hurt to pare down the soundtrack which unfortunately underscores the dialogue throughout the entire film. Because Lee is bent on throwing in the kitchen sink, he leaves us with an 'epic' that's overlong and clumsy with too many subplots coupled with an obvious anachronistic perspective.",1285372800,4,5963,4.934065934065934
3685208,5,B001LLH8S4,"As it happens, the US 92nd Infantry Division was a dumping ground for incompetent white officers.  The general staff operated on the assumption that these imcompetents would do the least damage, overall, commanding Negro soldiers, who were generally tolerated by the white man's army only at the insistence of the Roosevelt Administration.  The high percentage of bad reviews this excellent and historically accurate movie has received has little to do with the movie itself, and everything to do with the persistence of institutional and structural racism in the US, because this movie is, as I say, painstakingly accurate.  It is worth noting that the full range of racial attitudes are depicted here among every group.  For instance, a second white company commander informs the divisional commander of why these men were isolated on the far side of a river their own company commander insists they didn't cross.  White MPs intervene on behalf of the black soldiers who were denied service at a cafe in Mississippi, to no avail.  A German officer stops a man under his command from shooting a wounded and unarmed black American.  The black soldiers in this movie also represent the full range of men serving in the 92nd; just as white soldiers were not all exemplary, neither was every black man heroic simply because he was black.  But this isn't just a war movie, it is also a complex mystery, which also makes it enigmatic to the typical Clint Eastwood/John Wayne fan.  If you are a white person considering this movie, you must suspend most of your assumptions first, and accept the accuracy of this movie, even though you do not wish to believe that it is accurate.  If you can't do that, you will dismiss it as nonsense.",1280707200,28,1729,4.870307167235495

3685211,3,B001LLH8S4,"Spike Lee is one of our generation's best filmmakers. However, whenever he attacks an ambitious theme, he seems to ""over produce"". Here, he directs James McBride's screenplay about the courageous contribution of African-American soldiers in WWII, something which has been overlooked by every contemporary filmmaker from John Ford to Clint Eastwood. Lee's foray into epic war movies sadly backfires. The opening scene was unexpected and powerful, leaving you to believe that something really exciting would follow. NOT! The lack of character development and muddled plot lines result in us not getting a sense for these 4 soldiers from the all-black 92nd Infantry Division trapped in a village in Tuscany with Germans closing in. The location shots are lush and the soundtrack provides the suspense and pathos lacking in the dialogue and acting. The actors' efforts are lost in a film almost entirely in Italian or German WITH SUBTITLES! It's hard enough to follow along without having to read dialogue. Derek Luke, Michael Ealy and Laz Alonso are excellent in their thin feature parts. However, Omar Benson Miller is miscast in a pivotal role as a Forrest Whitaker wannabee who talks like minstrel player. His bumbling teddy bear shuffle-along act quickly got on my nerves. Also, I blinked and completely missed Kerry Washington! While I appreciate and respect what Lee tried to do here, as an African-American, I'm deeply offended by the shallow stereotypes depicted - one soldier teaching a young Italian boy to ""high five"" while another lusts after ""forbidden fruit"" (white women), combined with Miller's ""shuck'n & jive'n holy ghost"" act. The 166-minute mess is an hour too long. With some deft editing and better character development, ""Miracle At St. Anna"" could be a historically significant work, both entertaining and educational.

3685212,4,B001LLH8S4,"I wasn't sure I liked this movie the first time I saw it.  I think that's my first response to a lot of Spike Lee's movies. The first time I watched this one, I was looking for the over-all story. It would give that part alone about 3 out of 5 stars. But as a snap shot of black history, I thought this movie was well done. When I watched it  (on video) the second time, I was more into watching how the very individualized  black characters react to racism in the 1940s. When that was more central to my focus the movie meant more to me. (Also interesting: How different groups with totally different agendas appeal to God to be on their side)

When the story was about racism and when it wasn't, the story was more about individual people in a certain situation than it was about the situation (WWII) itself. Spike showed the Germans as good and bad, as strong and weak, some only really interested in getting back to their daily lives with wives and children--and some of them only interested in honor and glory and advancing their own rank in the military. (I never understood the comparison to Clint Eastwood's WWII movies: Clint used individual people to give a big but intimate picture of the whole war.)

It took some getting used to the big, simple guy who adopts the little boy--but I did second time I saw it. The little boy, I never got used to. Seems like a casting error to me most of the time, but he did a good job just looking tiny and vulnerable sometimes. Still, something about him was too clumsy at times--but I got over it.

In the end, I would say I liked the characters and how they showed up in the story. And that's what Spike Lee movies are all about. It's usually not about how you move from A to B to C to the end with his movies. It's always about the characters. And I liked them and I liked the bit of black history the movie revealed. So mission accomplished.

The historical accuracy is zero, and any attempts to compare it to Band of Brothers is laughable. It is an insult to the Black combat units it is suppose to represent. As a previous reviewer stated, it is a total loss of two hours of their life. I am only writing this review in hopes that other people will not fall into the same trap. By the way if you can believe an infantry man would carry around a marble head that would have to have weighed about 50lbs just for the hell of it,through the Italian mountains, for the duration of WWII, then you would believe just about anything. Most soldiers threw away their gas masks because they (certainly less then 5lbs)were too heavy. Give me a break! This movie belongs at the bottom of the 99cents bin and it would be almost criminal to be asked to pay that for it. The miracle was that it ever made it to DVD.",1269993600,3,1050,4.303030303030303
3685215,5,B001LLH8S4,"I stumbled onto this movie on the Encore HD channel last night, about 20 minutes into it, and couldn't break away.  Spell binding.  I will be watching for it again.  I'd like to purchase the DVD, but it's only available on the wide screen version, which means you lose resolution when zoom it in to fill the screen vertically.  Since most of use are going HD tv's, you'd think DVD makers would format a version for that size screen.  I'll wait.

The story is about a Benedict Arnold in the Italian Resistance was responsible for the massacre of hundreds, if not thousands, of innocent civilians, in two villages in the Apennines mountains of Italy. Serendipitously, a group of four Buffalo soldiers, separated from their command, encounter this man.  What unfolds is gruesome, but accurate, retelling of the horrors of modern warfare, which we've only experienced on our soil at Pearl Harbor and NYC. Forty years later, one of the soldiers encounters the turn coat in NYC, posing as an innocent immigrant. Hector shoots the SOB in cold blood and then stands trial for his murder.  The movie then ""flashes back"" and provides the justification for the man's execution as a war criminal.

Some of the dialog might be a bit over the top, but knowing well (up close and personal as the expression goes) the generations which were adults during WWII, the attitudes of condescension towards Blacks is not inaccurate.  Nor is the depiction of some Army officers as totally inept off the mark.  I, too, served for 24 years, and met plenty of hard-headed officers who made bone-head decisions. The old Beetle Bailey cartoons weren't based on imaginary problems; what made the old sitcoms of Sgt Bilko and McHale's Navy funny is that there is an element of truth in them as they depict officer incompetence.  And during those 24 years, I saw plenty of subtle form of discrimination as well.

I suspect what accounts for the high number of 1 star ratings is not the movie content so much as mirror effect.  People are just plain uncomfortable seeing themselves as they are (or were), and Mr. Lee surely has done a fine job depicting the reality of the 1940s.",1268438400,11,2146,4.749326145552561

'Miracle at St Anna' is one of those films that will glue your eyes to the screen. There is violence, there is tension, there are moments of alomst every single human emotion.

3685218,5,B001LLH8S4,"Spike Lee isn't capable of making a less than stellar movie, and this movie is no exception.  I'm therefore stunned that there are so many negative reviews, and I can only posit that too many people came to the movie with rigid expectations or were just incapable of relating to the themes which are explored.  Those themes, set in the Italy of WWII, are numerous and masterfully layerered and interwoven: the horrors and pointlessness of war, romance and lust, bonds of family, care of children, empathy and brutality, betrayal and revenge, patriotism and alienation, existence of God and the problem of evil, death and afterlife, and especially racism and its transcendence.

As one would expect from a Spike Lee movie, the acting, plot construction, scenery, soundtrack, etc. are all excellent, with the result that this movie is deeply powerful and gripping.  The three hours felt like one hour, and I expect to remember this movie for a long time.  If I had to complain about something, perhaps the ending was a bit too terse and convenient, but that doesn't do much to diminish my appreciation for this movie.

I would have thought that a story of such historical importance would have been told with more passionate depth in order to rekindle some form of interest in the positive contribrutions of Black Men in America. Instead the amatureish acting coupled with the lack of drama failed to spark any interest in the events depicted int this film at all.

As for the racism- it existed, it happened and it still is happening so for all of those whining about it in this film- get over it. I noticed that a lot of negative reviews were concerning that topic and historical accuracy. It's a movie! It's entertainment from someone's point of view, as film is art.

3685223,4,B001LLH8S4,"I agree that the Miracle of St. Anna actors used some vernacular that was not common for that time period and that the actions of the African American soldiers in dealing with white American were also questionable.  During this time period you must remember that African Americans were still being lynched by whites, segregation was acceptable in many areas; African Americans that stood up for themselves were regularly and severely punished.  I believe Spike Lee may have brought in a little creativity to some of the scenes (just like most movies), however I thought the movie was very good.  My father served in World War II.  He spoke regularly of the mistreatment by white officers and white civilians and how this mistreatment made people of color carry heavy burdens.  African American men (and most people who were mistreated for centuries) were not allowed to release any disgruntled feelings on their nemesis, without vengeance.
  Again, I enjoyed the movie; the cinematography was just breath taking.  I enjoyed the relationship the Chocolate giant had developed with the little Italian boy.

It was a breath of fresh air to see a war movie where Blacks were not shown as servants or not shown at all as a part of the war effort.  I especially enjoyed the scene where it was shown the racism in this country that the soldiers had to endure just to get to the war to fight.

3685226,4,B001LLH8S4,"I saw this movie last night and cannot get it out of my head. I understand that many ""war buffs"" may watch war movies in order to see if the most acurate weapons are used and if the uniforms are correct etc. but I can assure you that most moviegoers do not have the slightest idea about these things. The portrayal of the racism that existed in the US Army was shocking to me though I have to admit that when confronted with it after the initial shock wore off I was not surprised. I agree that there was a somewhat chaotic and disjointed feeling to the story but I must wonder if that was not intended. War is chaotic and random and senseless and disjointed and maybe that feeling is intended by the director. I would have liked more character development. A lot of questions were left unanswered and that bothered me: where was the statue head on the beach at the end of the movie from- how did it get there? What happened to Hector after he met up with his benefactor on the beach (and how was he able to fly out of the country after posting bail)? How did the boy survive the war? Was he actually killed in the final battle scene and then somehow revived? Was that the miracle? What were the other miracles?  Why did Renata sleep with Bishop when she seemed to have a crush on the other guy?(that made no sense to me whatsoever)In spite of my unanswered questions and confusion I found the overall message of the movie moving and haunting. The relationship between the ""chocolate giant and the boy was beautiful.
The scene of the massacre at St. Anna was riveting and horrifying. The story of the resistance fighters was inspiring. I also learned about the history of the Buffalo Soldiers- which I am embarrased to say I knew nothing about. The scene of the racism in the roadside ice cream shop also blew me away. When I am watching a movie I guess I don't pull it apart and wonder if soldiers would have spoken the way they were speaking or if it would have been possible to speak back to a commanding officer. It seems to me that people who view movies this way are just sitting there looking for mistakes and that is not a way to watch a movie. If you want total historical accuracy go to a museum or watch the History channel. Overall- it was a movie which taught me, made me think and feel strong emotions. I would recommend it and I would watch it again.",1251763200,7,2365,4.326576576576577
3685227,2,B001LLH8S4,"With all respect to the filmmakers including the director Spike Lee, ""Miracle at St. Anna"" is a big misfire. I don't say the film is unwatchable, but after sitting through the overlong film that deals with such important historical events as the ""Buffalo Soldiers,"" all African-American regiments in the U.S. army, my impression was simply this: ""What is the point?""

The film begins with a murder at a post office in New York City in 1983. Before a rookie news reporter, the arrested elder postal worker Aubrey Stamps (Derek Luke) recounts his experiences during the WWII in Italy, 1944, when he and three other black soldiers were trapped in a small village while fighting the German army. The frame story is a bit too long, but effective enough to lead us to the story within it.

""Miracle at St. Anna"" is part a war movie with several combat scenes, which are pretty bloody. But basically the film is about the four soldiers (played by Derek Luke, Michael Ealy, Laz Alonso and Omar Benson Miller), and a group of Italians they encounter. There are a few subplots including a strange boy who seems to speak with his invisible friend. Private Sam Train (Omar Benson Miller who looks like young Forest Whitaker) tries to protect him.

I know the film is based on a work of fiction (by James McBride and the screenplay was adapted by the writer too), not a documentary about true events in Italy during WWII and the ""Buffalo Soldiers."" Also, I understand it is only natural that the story revolves around the four fictional soldiers. We need someone we can relate to.

Unfortunately in this film there is none we can relate to. These characters - most Italians and Germans too - are all types at best, conventional and flat, repeatedly used in other films. The narrative is also confusing with one flashback within flashback.

With its rambling narrative and too many cameos (talented actors like John Leguizamo appear briefly, apparently only to prolong the story) that are detracts the viewers from the main story, ""Miracles at St. Anna"" is a typical example of too many things going on, blurring the meaning of the ""miracle"" of the title, and more importantly, the historical importance of the ""Buffalo Soldiers.""",1251072000,2,2216,4.821052631578947

Fighting for your country when your country doesn't have your back is something I can't imagine and yet it happens. So many have been in this position, faced it and died. It brings tears to my eyes. Everyone should see this movie. Everyone should answer the question, ""how can I put an end to racism?"" and then act on that answer.

3685231,1,B001LLH8S4,A really disjointed movie that was difficult to follow even on the second viewing. Horribly disconnected story with mid-bongling plot leaps.,1248307200,5,140,5.714285714285714
3685232,4,B001LLH8S4,"I have just finished my 2nd viewing of this film. It was certainly inaccurate in some of the jargon and social interactions between the black soldiers but, I think the target audiance of the film would have found the more restained, conservative, authentic behavior of African Americans of the time period too ""unbelievable"" emotionally today.
Many reviews compare this film negatively w/ ""Saving Private Ryan"" which has become the official ""great"" WWII movie in many peoples minds. Pvt. Ryan and this film are equally effected by modern views and the times in which they were made. Both films are heavily influenced by the post Vietnam image of war and American soldiering.
Speilberg may have gotten more of the soldiers common speech and pop-culture interests right, but his film is no more accurate than Spike Lee's. The value that we place on the lives of individuals and humans in general was just not present in those times. Following orders was done without question by 99% of service men at the time, questioning a superiors orders to his face was virtually unheard of and many had a very fatalistic attitude toward their circumstances and did not really consider that there might be an ""alternative"" way of doing things. The U.S. army was very 'liberal' by the standards of the time, but even then no one did much hand wringing about civilian casualties and many men died following orders that were either suicidal or very poorly conceived on a regular basis. There were few opportunities to ""vent"" ones frustrations. Outside of the U.S. army any kind of insubordinate attitude was basically a death sentence. In the Soviet and Japanese armies even retreat was considered treason. It is estimated the as much as 1/4 of all Soviet KIA's were as a result of Soviet bullets. (The Red Army was extremely undisciplined in the early years of the war, at times entire units were executed or starved to death).
The film is much more emotionally accurate than Private Ryan in many ways. Including its portrayal of incompetant officers: this was pretty common especially in the early days of the war in the European theatre. Tom Hanks nobel, benevolent, tear jerker teacher-dad is about as real as John Wayne or G.I. Joe. Many white soldiers were butched by useless officers ,I am sure Buffalo soldiers were unlikely to receive better treatment. The sexaul interaction w/ the Italian woman is also pretty realistic. Continental Europeans were far more immodest than Brits or U.S. and the less sexly modest standards of black men combined w/ Italian women deprived of most of their best men from the earlier years of the war seems very believable, although its hard to imagine this young woman would have stayed in such sultry proportions considering the extreme food shortages.
Lastly I thought Spike was relatively fair to the Germans. He had at least two ""good"" Germans in the film.(The disloyal officer who reads poetry..ps. this is the same fellow that gives his pistol over to the surviving Buffalo, and the boyish blond landser). He does accuratly portray the rest of the Germans as very disiplined and hard, thats what made them the worlds standard of their day. This is interpretated as making them ""monsters"" by todays standards, but this was the expectation in all militaries of the time, except maybe the Soviet which did actively encouraged its troops to defile women and children and commit atrocities. Sorry to burst eveyones bubble but there are no ""Good Wars"" only necessary or unnecessary ones. I think the question of wether U.S. and British involvement in WWII was necessary is still unanswered. Spike Lee at least saves his preaching for one narrow topic(race)and does not make a propaganda film like Speilberg. The film has problems but it is dishonest to pretend that they are all due to ""inaccuracies"", something which is inherent in 99% of all WWII films.",1248307200,3,3878,4.949386503067485

3685234,2,B001LLH8S4,"Leonard Nimoy said it best years ago when he wrote that a director cannot ride a bad script.  In MIRACLE AT ST. ANNA there are great actors, locations, and military hardware.  The problem is that they go nowhere with the story.  Add to an already lame screenplay other half developed subplots and bizarre occurrences and you have MIRACLE AT ST. ANNA.

This could have been a great war film about the 92nd Infantry Division ""Buffalo Soldiers.""  Having spent considerable time assigned to Fort Huachuca, Arizona I am quite familiar with the history of the Buffalo Soldiers.  They certainly deserved better than this film.

Summary:  An aging veteran shoots a man with a luger.  In the subsequent police investigation they locate a sculptured marble head in the veteran's apartment.  The film then flashes back to 1944 Italy and a squad of GI's caught behind German lines.  The squad from the 92nd Infantry Division ends up dragging along extra baggage in the way of a shell shocked Italian youth, a marble statue head, Italian resistance fighters, and a solitary German prisoner.  The soldiers move into an unoccupied Italian village and wait for something to happen while at the same time voicing their own voluminous personal agendas.

In the soldiers' midst is an Italian traitor who betrays them to the Germans.  At the point of being relieved by elements of their Infantry Division the Germans counterattack and decimate the relief force and all but one of the squad members.  The film then moves back to the 1980s and rejoins the pre-trial hearing involving the shooting incident.

In addition to the main story there are also the side stories including the massacre at St. Anna, German soldier gone AWOL, the shell shocked Italian boy summoning up images of his dead friend, and a German captain questioning his colonel's implausible Nazi idealism.

I had high hopes for this film.  Instead it does not even come close to films like SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS.  In watching the film I was rooting for the squad to succeed, but could not understand why they were loitering about in the village.  The other detractor in the film was historical accuracy.  Although the massacre at St. Anna is based on a true event it became a sideline event in this film.  I also could not help noticing some of the mismatched German SS and army insignia on some of the soldiers.

There is also too little of actor Christian Berkel in this film.  Berkel has appeared in several war films as a German soldier such as DOWNFALL, BLACK BOOK, and VALKYRIE.  In fact in ST. ANNA Berkel also appeared with Waldemar Kobur who also had supporting roles in BLACK BOOK and VALKYRIE.  Berkel's role as the German officer who spares the last GI in the squad is fleeting at best and is part of one of those subplots that just never developed properly.

The final street battle scene is fairly impressive and to some extent redeems the end of the movie in the same way that the final battle scene of CASTLE KEEP brought some measure of excitement to an otherwise lackluster film.",1247184000,5,3067,4.770398481973435

Even the ending with the posting of bail by Mr. Negron and the dramatic entrance by the big shot lawyer.

This film illustrates a part of the war that has been largely neglected.  Racism was a fact of everyday life and having the Buffalo soldiers in combat was a bold experiment.  Most whites were convinced that ""negros"" couldn't hold up in combat.  Many whites didn't want to be proven wrong.  This film illustrate this without over doing it.  The scenery is spectaular.  This is a visually beautiful film.  The action sequences are vivid.  There are several characters I like and some I loved to hate.  This film shows the desparation of civilians who are caught in the jaws of a brutal war that seemed like it would never end.

He could have told the story of a couple of soldiers as they progress through bootcamp and enter combat.  But instead Spike Lee produces a ridiculous, heavy handed, grossly fictional account.  The film fails on several levels:

1) All the white officers are vicous racist. The protagonist are sterotypes.  There is the obligatory over-sexed African American, the big simple guy, the quite reflective wise one, etc.  The Italian peasants seem to be only interested in jumping into bed and showing off their breast.  In reality, they were starving and caught in terrible cross fires.
2) The story is absolutely predictable
3) A group of African American soldier pull their weapons on racist civilians in town during boot camp.  They would be instantly identified, court marshalled, and put in the slammer.
4) The CO drives in a Jeep to the supposedly encircled hilltop town thick with Germans to curse out the protagonists.  Shortly thereafter the Germans blitz through the town.
5) An enlisted character assaults an officer during a combat situation.  He would be restrained and quite possibly shot on the spot.

3685267,3,B001LLH8S4,"After hearing all the negative reviews about Spike Lee's World War II movie, I avoided seeing it at the theater. After watching it on DVD, I regretted that decision.
While ""Miracle at St. Anna"" isn't perfect, it's entertaining and moving, with some powerful scenes sure to hit the emotions.
Many critics have labeled it a mess, but I don't quite see the mess they're speaking of.
It seems they're not used to Spike Lee's method of filmmaking. His ""joints"" can seem disjointed. But I personally thought he toned down some of his more eccentric idiosyncrasies.
I've also read that many people are wondering what exactly is the ""miracle."" What I like about this movie is that it doesn't highlight what the miracle is. It leaves it up to us, the viewer -- something that most big movies don't do, as they'd rather spoonfeed us, hold our hands and explain EVERYTHING, so we don't have to think or make our own decisions.
I also have another response to those critics who say Spike Lee presented the main white character as a stereotypical, one-dimensional racist. That may be so, but in doing so, he's presenting a litmus test for those same individuals who are quick to point out ""racism"" directed toward white characters, but have yet to criticize ongoing racism toward minorities, in both film and real life.
This movie was better than I thought it would be. It's nowhere near the train wreck that critics and others tried to make it out to be. I believe their criticism of this movie was more directed at Spike Lee, than the movie itself.
Spike Lee kept the sentimentality to a minimum (something that Spielberg couldn't help himself to do with in his otherwise great movie Saving Private Ryan, nor could Eastwood achieve in his similarly good movie Letters From Iwo Jima).
And it was a surprise to find out which character would survive at the end. That's something that most filmmakers give away long before the film's conclusion.
Viewers should put aside their dislike of Spike Lee, and not go with the majority of self-absorbed critics, and see how Miracle at St. Anna, despite its flaws, is still a rich movie.",1242432000,3,2114,4.747282608695652

Is he mocking religious convictions and dogma or rather showing it as the glue that keeps men from going totally mad? I have too many questions left from this movie and usually that guides you to reading the novel, but not in this case, the movie just made me angry with its Deus ex machina ending.

The movie script was way to convoluted to want to write a plot synopsis. In fact this movie should have been trimmed down by 20-40 minutes to make it as lean as possible. Sad thing is I didn't really feel any way towards the characters in this movie (except the big bid dumb country private) even with the important piece of history it represents and my own personnel connection to the history. Also, the 2 sergeants in the movie, their tension with each other wasn't there. I didn't see their gripe as legitimate, rather something forced because it's a movie and it has to be on.

They were cast in a light inferior to those around them, while the self serving portrayal of white officers as bigoted idiots was just as offensive.
Couple this with a completely disjointed story, gratuitous violence not at all in the vein of other superior movies about WWII until the village battle, and the unnecessry sexual encounter after the all in the movie call on Christ for their protection, and you have a true piece of crap.

Spike used a novel only loosely based on the St. Anna de Stazzema atrocity.

This film seems pasted together.  Train's relationship with the boy was the film's most successful aspect, but the supernatural aspect with the boy's brother didn't work and seemed out of place.  The statue head came off as a gimmick that gave me no reason to empathize with Negron when he saw it at film's end.

Over the course of the last few decades, war movies have become so unflinchingly brutal and authentic in their depiction of life on the battlefield that they've become all but impossible to sit through - and I say this as a compliment, not as a denigration.  They SHOULD be impossible to sit through.  This IS war we're talking about after all.

That being said, it should also be pointed out that ""The Miracle at St. Anna"" - a highly fictionalized account of an actual event - devotes only a minimal amount of time to carnage and bloodshed as it unfolds its story of four African-American soldiers (Laz Alonso, Derek Luke, Michael Ealy and Omar Benson Miller) trapped behind enemy lines in Italy during the closing days of WW II.  The film recounts their experiences with sympathetic villagers, anti-Fascist partisan fighters, Nazi soldiers (of both good and bad stripe), an orphaned boy they take under their wing and, of course, the requisite beautiful Italian peasant girl (Valentina Cervi) who wears tight sweaters and has a steamy encounter with one of the men.

This latest work by Spike Lee certainly has its heart in the right place and there are scenes of undeniable intensity and power where he once again demonstrates his bona fides as a director of genuine vision and power (the brutal massacre of a group of unarmed villagers at the hands of the Nazis - the one truly nonfiction moment in the story - is the emotional high point of the movie).

Yet, the movie, as a whole, adds up to much less than the sum of its parts, a victim of both overreaching and over-length (the movie takes a full two hours and 40 minutes to tell its story).  Interestingly, the screenplay by James McBride (based on his novel) suffers from trying to do too much and too little at one and the same time.  At some points, it seems as if he is doing his best to throw everything but the kitchen sink into the narrative mix, while, at others, the movie feels thin and underdeveloped, with the characters stuck for long stretches of time in a storyline that doesn`t seem to be going anywhere all that interesting or dramatic.  The diffuse and meandering plot drains the film of much of its narrative and emotional energy, and the movie is further hampered by the use of an uninteresting murder subplot - set in the 1980s - as an all too conventional framing device for the main story.  It is in these scenes, in particular, where Lee's grand opera style of filmmaking - bolstered by Terence Blanchard's melodramatic score - most threatens to fall over the edge into pretentiousness.  Moreover, the bathos and low comedy that frequently creep into the writing, as well as the fact that the four men seem more like clearly differentiated ""types"" than fully-rounded human beings, serve to undercut the generally fine performances by a large and gifted cast.

Apart from the gripping war-is-hell scenes, ""The Miracle at St Anna"" is at its best when it's focusing on the bitter irony of men being called upon to do their patriotic duty of fighting and dying in a foreign land - all for a country that forces them to serve in black-only units in the field and to eat in segregated diners back home.  One of the characters even confesses, at one point, that he feels more ""free"" and accepted in Italy than he does in the United States.

There's probably a first-rate two-hour-long movie buried somewhere in the midst of ""The Miracle at St. Anna.""  A pity Lee and McBride weren't able to fully ferret it out.",1238803200,5,3494,4.666123778501628

Next we see four Buffalo soldiers barely survive German and friendly fire during a barrage and take shelter in an Italian village. Meanwhile the Germans are looking for a deserter that saw his commander order another village massacred when they could not tell him where a Partisan leader was hiding. When the Germans assault the village, the Buffalo soldiers try to keep them from killing everyone including a small boy that seemed frightened of one of the Partisans. The story unfolds over the course of the movie and by the end we know why the postal worker shot the man and why he has a priceless Venetian statue head, and an interesting story that should keep you glued.

3685345,3,B001LLH8S4,"MIRACLE AT ST. ANNA got panned pretty severely. And I can see why. Lacking cohesion and hopscotching around like a child with A-D-D, the story is tough to follow. And what about the title? Exactly what is ""the Miracle""? Some might say it's that this film ever got made. But there are some upsides to it that I think make this a semi-watchable flick.

The first plus is that it focuses on a little known regiment of black WW II fighters called ""The Buffalo Soldiers."" Spike Lee had apparently been aching to do another ""black story"" and found his muse in Nazi occupied Italy.

Although there's been some bashing related to overacting on the main characters' parts, I didn't find that to be the case. Derek Luke, Michael Ealy, and the rest of these band of brothers did fine in my eyes. Although Spike did have them doing things that weren't being done during this time (specifically the ""high five"" which wasn't realized until the late 70s), I did find their delivery of the story to be engaging enough, and kept me watching during its entire, lengthy, 2 hours and 40 minute run time.

I also really liked the on-site filming locations in Italy, which gave the entire production a very real quality. The cobbled streets, twisted landscape, and ancient-looking buildings were all well-shown in the film and had me ogling at various times.

But, as they say, all good things must come to an end. Although Spike Lee tries admirably to keep the story together, he too often wanders off on tangents that have nothing to do with the story. One particularly infuriating scene involves John Leguizamo (THE HAPPENING). He's in modern day Italy with his lover and his only use for being in the film is that he throws a newspaper out a window so that it lands on a man's table. Why couldn't the man have simply seen it at a newsstand? Why the whole set up with Leguizamo and the hot chick? Sex for the sake of sex, perhaps?

The other, less infuriating, item that shows Spike wandering away was when he films the Buffalo boys being refused food service at a place back in the States before they were shipped overseas. Why this played a role in the film and what it had to do with the Miracle is anyone's guess.

Finally, there's the tough sell of the Miracle itself. Although people can debate what qualifies as a miracle, I think most would say it equates to something supernatural that cannot be explained by normal evidence. And here lies perhaps the biggest problem for Miracle at St. Anna. There really isn't a miracle. Perhaps it's well enough that one of the Buffalo men made it home and found his way to peace. Perhaps it's that the world spun and allowed the last surviving Buffalo Soldier to avenge the people of St. Anna and his fallen brothers.

The verdict?  This has to rank as one of Spike's worst movies right up there with ""Jungle Fever"", ""Girl Six"", ""School Daze"", ""Mo Better Blues"", etc.  You would think after he made two successful films like ""The 25th Hour"" or ""Inside Man"" but unfortunately he loaded this movie with his racial polemnics, stereotypes, irrevelant subplots--it's like he threw in the whole kitchen sink in this one!!  Also the Black soldiers in this are depicted almost without exception as street types rather than the trained battle worn soldiers they truly were--what a disservice.  What really surprised me was when the english speaking Italian Renata beds down with the most unsympathetic character in the movie!!  Don't get me wrong there is some good acting in this film particularly from Derek Luke who has been in better movies than this like ""Spartan"" and ""Antwone Fisher"" and also the Italian actors were excellent too.  In fact I found the segments with Italian partisans more involving than the subplots of the infantry--figure that out.  What this film needed was a better story and director perhaps John Singleton, Carl Franklin, Bill Duke and even Mr Eastwood himself.  I've heard that many of the Italian survivors of the atrocity are angry at Lee and James McBride, the writer of this story for taking liberties to the story.  If you want a better film on the contributions of Africain Americans to the war effort, rent ""Glory"".

The main character just pulls a gun and shoots the 'victim' and you are taken back in time in WW2.
It was VERY slow at first and you see the BAD treatment african ameraicans get durin world war 2.
The plot is slow and wierd at times when the child keeps refering to his 'friend' who is invisible.
Im use to slow movies, especially documentries with no action, or books like war and peace.
Towards the end the plot thickens and you witness betrayal between comrads and family.
I felt it odd how only one military person remained *and the little boy ran away* in the village after the germans killed everyone, but then in WW2, they actually did.
I don't want to give away the plot, b/c you can watch it or find the ending online but after that fateful day, that one survivor remembers the traitor and kills him in 1983.
He made bail by the person who he help saved.
After that final line ""I was that boy"" it all comes together and thats why I like the movie b/c of the PLOT!!
Also, another review does point the cons of the film, that I also noted. ""contemporary language, modern topics of discussion, poor acting, and endless preaching about the evils of America."" I did my best to ignore the visible poor acting and tried to focus my attention to the main plot, which was pretty good.
But forgive me but the acting and language, I couldn't understand what the american soldiers were saying, I had to put sub titles on to try to understand them. =/
Yes, I live under a rock, but I didn't know that ""Spike Lee had scolded Clint Eastwood for not having any African Americans in Iwo Jima and had wanted him to rewrite history.""
Its bad b/c not only were african americans were treated badly in WW2 but the japanese americans*which we put in 'concentration' like camps after the bombing of pearl harbor, the indians *windtalkers* the hispanics, who also weren't white and faught in WW2 and were treated as bad. Maybe we should scold SP for not having hispanics in the movie.

Besides that, I always say, peoples taste in movies varies. To me, I figured it was somehwat better then SPR. Dont get me wrong, I liked SPR but the ending was kinda TOO 'hollywood' but its a MOVIE based on historic events.

To be honest, I felt that there were a lot of unnecessary characters that jumbled together in one confusing mass.  For instance, there is a scene where one officer meets a superior in their headquarters to discuss the battalion.  It lasts about 5 minutes and they only discuss things that the viewer already realized.  These two men are never revisited.  What was the point?

There are also a lot of villagers that get face-time, when really, the movie should be focusing on its main characters.  Because of these extra characters, I feel like one never really gets to know about the 4 men in the movie.  You never know anything about their past, their thoughts or beliefs, what drew them into enlisting, etc.  I didn't understand why those 4 men were basically hanging out in that village and, astonishingly, going to parties and just walking around like they owned the place.

Another thing that annoyed me was the need to show nudity in the film.  Spoiler Alert: there is no overly explicit sex scene, rather the Italian female just takes off her shirt while she's doing laundry and lets one of the guys look at her.  I mean, who DOESN'T strip while their doing laundry??  Another opportunity was showing a dead woman's breast who had a baby.  The camera zoomed in on it as if saying, ""Look!  Look!  Boob!""  There also seemed to be something of a love-triangle going on between her and 2 of the guys, but it was never realized.  It just confused me even more from the plot.

The camera angles were strange and distracting, cutting from one person to the next as a variety of people are praying.  It didn't draw me into the film, it just made me realize more fully where I was.

Finally, the thing that totally confused me was the ending.  Another spoiler alert: a German officer just gives his gun to one of the severely wounded men.  What??  It's nice that there was a spark of humanity in war, but you have no idea who this German officer is and why he would give this man a GUN, never mind taking him prisoner or something.  Was that the miracle???  I don't know.  I never figured out what the miracle was.  And why did that guy get a Purple Heart?  What did he do except survive?

After writing all this down I've just realized that I want to change this rating from a 2-star to a 1-star.  I'm never watching this again, I can tell you that.  If you're curious, go rent it - but I recommend Redbox.  It truly is unfortunate.

To be blunt and straight to the point, Spike Lee could have made a better attempt at staying true to the book. In many cases, there are major discrepancies between the book and the movie (both as the characters are concerned and with certain events). In my opinion, this is an average WWII flick (although it was a nice change of pace to see authentic languages being spoken instead of English merged with bad accents). It would have been nice to see more detail and background information in the interest of character development; although I do understand that there are time constraints and budget issues with movies. I was not able to connect with the characters as well as I did while reading the book.

This movie just stunk. The whole 'Sleeping Man' and 'Chocolate Giant' thing was corney and stupid. I got tired of the whole Train character in about two seconds. And the Italian woman with the glorious breasts was nice but then they have her say that she is married and then develop some kind of emotional thing with one guy then turn around and have sex with the other guy and then right before she dies she redeems her virtue by looking at the 'good guy' and saying his name as if to say, ""it was you that I wanted... but the other guy was just so damned smooth that I couldn't stop myself'. This movie was ridiculous up to the very end when SPOILER ALERT 'Seat Belts' becomes a great revelation. That big stupid 100 pound bowling ball of a statue head that the big stupid idiot carries around for the entire movie was just that SToOpId. And so were other things like the newspaper fling out the window when John Leguizamo (who is in the movie for no other reason)is having his morning coffee and sex to land on just the right guys table at just the right time. This stupid junk was also seen when the mail man just happens to have just that one guy come up to his window and he just happens to have that gun.

3685367,3,B001LLH8S4,"Spike... Spike... Spike. After lambasting Clint Eastwood - not to say his accusations were specious - in collaboration with the screenwriter James McBride, he ends up committing comparable indiscretions and taking too long in doing so..  I had a hard time in staying in the appropriate era, as the actors voiced present era interpretations of Vietnam Era mentalities in a film about a black squadron in World War II. Black soldiers of that era were alienated from white peers however they were of similar mind regarding the cause. It was not a perception of fighting ""the white man's war,"" it was an opportunity to advance the premise of equality by demonstration of bravery, valor and patriotism commensurate with any other soldier, with the objective of securing a non-segregated seat at America's diverse ethnic table.

At the core, this story of  four black soldiers who in part due to the bigotry and incompetence of their company commander find themselves isolated behind enemy lines and forced to fend for themselves by establishing a partnership with the Italian locals.  Over the course of interaction each member of each group is required to overcome biases, both internal and external, as well as inculcated beliefs of the value of another human being.

 There is much to be commended in MASA, starting with the aspiration to bring the story of the Buffalo soldiers to a wider audience; often the cinematography of the Italian countryside is breathtaking and although I had personal reservations regarding the infusion of ""trickster"" role from the African American oral tradition, for many viewers the underlying story of sublimation of self-interest in the course of transition  to selfless dedication and sacrifice for the benefit of another will be appealing.

Unfortunately, far too many characters are portrayed as caricatures; the Germans are nearly all heartless executioners of a meagerly defensible people, while essentially every aspect of the African Diaspora was ineffectually and superficially infused in the roles of a mere four  men.  By the time the film approaches the conclusion, the cursory and skeptical occurrences of the concluding scenes are a welcomed event only because the uneven presentation has come to a close.",1235174400,6,2250,5.242339832869081

If a white man had made this movie and drawn the black characters this way, he would be widely derided as a racist, and rightly so.

I'm not sure what the studios were thinking with this film, but obviously Spike Lee has earned enough clout to get away with garbage like this.

More specifically, it is the story of 4 black soldiers separated from their unit who come into contact with a young Italian boy and a family of Italian peasants. One of the soldiers particularly takes a liking to the traumatized boy-and his imaginary friend-and sort of ""adopts"" the boy as his own. In turn, the boy calls his new friend his ""chocolate giant."" The story is very Christian and religion is a major factor in bringing together these people from two completely different worlds. The brutal racism of the era is also well depicted and there seems to be sort of an epiphany on the part of the black soldiers when they come into contact with these ""white folks"" who do not treat them like animals.

I'm not a huge fan of Spike Lee, but I do think he is a talented filmmaker who has made some quality films. Thus, I was disappointed with what I would regard as a somewhat amateurish production. The story was moving and had a lot of potential, but I think Lee blew it here. The battle sequences were awkward, the dialogue was often weak and inane, and too many of the characters were exaggerated to the point of near caricatures.

I knew there were black Army units but I thought they mostly stuck to supply (the Red Ball Express).  I didn't realize there were black combat units until a few years ago.  Shame really because it sounds like many of them showed valor along the lines of the Japanese-American units.

The scene that really bothers me is the scene where they try to get Ice Cream in Alabama and are refused service, unless they go to the back.  Sitting in the restaurant were German POWs who were getting better treatment than the American soldiers.  It was a sad reflection on the times but an indication of just how far we've come.

3685377,4,B001LLH8S4,"I was somewhat amused by Spike Lee's assertion that Clint Eastwood ignored Black American soldiers efforts in the battles of the Pacific Rim in WWII. I almost didn't look at ""Flags of Our Fathers"" {FOF} or ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" as your typical war film. It was more of a reconciling of truths that soldiers needed to come to terms with instead of a ""no man left behind"" type of battle compilation (like ""Saving Private Ryan"").

""Miracle at St. Anna"" (MSA) is closer to the scope of ""FOF"" than perhaps Spike wants to be. This film has scope, grandeur, a very solid cast, although some potholes in script and dialogue. I'm officially on the Laz Alonso (Corp. Hector Negron) bandwagon. His inherent sadness and disappointment as an older man (juxtaposed by his calm/self-assuredness as a young man) is palpable onscreen. He conveys a wide range of emotion with his eyes, something that many actors fail to do. Derek Luke and Michael Ealy (2nd Staff Sgt. Aubrey Stamps and Sgt. Bishop Cummings respectively) are like 2 sides of a coin-one fire and passion, the other cool and professional. Omar Benson Miller (PFC Train) is a giant chocolate teddy bear, and newcomer Matteo Sciabordi (Angelo) shows how war can absolutely paralyze you with fear.

I chose to view the miracle of ""MSA"" as one lone boy-family murdered, hungry, desperate, and lost-being able to live a full life, be successful, and take back what the war took from him years ago. It's a powerful message of redemption and love.

The score is a wonderful piece of work (with respect to other reviewers who believed that some of the music was out of place; the spiritual was-and is-an integral part of Black American history). Spike generally employs the talents of Terrence Blanchard (who scored 'When the Levees Broke' and 'Four Little Girls' as well), and he doesn't disappoint. As a note of interest, the Morehouse College Glee Club (my husband's-and Spike's-alma mater) sings during the end credits.

I enjoyed this film in theaters and will enjoy the DVD as well (although it is lacking in additional commentary/special features). 4 stars.",1234569600,,2105,4.904494382022472

3685379,3,B001LLH8S4,"I can't shake the feeling that one of the reasons that Spike Lee did this film, besides the fact that the story focuses on a portion of the Buffalo Soldiers, was the fact that Lee (and others) was (were) so disappointed in the lack of acknowledgement of African-Americans in Clint Eastwood's Flags of Our Fathers.  Those with short memories may already have forgotten, or perhaps didn't even know, that there was a tiff between Eastwood and Lee over the lack of minority (read: African-American) representation in Eastwood's much hyped film.

Moving along past that feeling, Miracle at St. Anna focuses on a group of Buffalo Soldiers that are cut-off from their unit after crossing a river.  The men wind up in a Tuscan village, behind enemy lines, trying to hold out until they can escape or be rescued.  Without a working radio to contact their unit, unable to speak the language (for the most part), and not sure who to trust around them as things in the village just don't seem quite right.

Throw in racial tension that comes from flash backs, a company commander that is an obvious redneck bigot, and others along the way just to make sure the story really uses all of the long running time to score points about racism during World War II and previously, and perhaps a lot since.

I'd like to say Miracle at St. Anna is a good film, but unfortunately several things detracted from that rating for me along the way.  Parts of the film did, as another reviewer notes, seem out of place and/or felt like they were shoe-horned in.  Are scenes missing that would have helped make it all flow better and make more sense?  I don't know, but it all comes through somewhat forced.  Thrown on top of the scenes dealing with racism at points not directly related to the on-going story line, you get the feeling that Lee should have cut those portions while expanding other.

On top of all of that the musical score is obnoxiously melodramatic for my tastes and distracts from the film more than enhances it.  The volume levels for the score drown out action and dialogue at times and just plain makes the film seemed all the more forced.

What could have been and should have been a more enjoyable film watching experience instead was less than I wanted and hoped for.  On the plus side, the featurette about the Buffalo Soldiers is interesting, the action sequences are fairly good (with a few notable exceptions: one scene with the Chocolate Giant carrying what was obviously a doll was laughably fake, as well as a few other scenes that just don't come off as well as they should), and the main story line is actually interesting, despite it too being shoe-horned into semi-current events in a way that leaves you thinking all along about what really links those events with the events that we're watching.

Picture quality on the Blu-ray is quite nice, but again the audio seems to distract (due to the musical score) more than it should.

In summary: a film that should have been better, shorter, and more tightly packaged.  See it, but exercise caution before buying and perhaps think rental first.",1234310400,2,3100,4.679558011049724
3685396,1,B001LLH8S4,"I had wanted to like this movie so much. As much as I wanted to like Windtalkers. Both had potential to be really great but were unable to rise above an absolutely juvenile and cheesy script.  I am an avid WWII buff and I give alot of license to war movies and don't pick them apart for their accuracy or lack there of but this one not only insults the viewer but the legacy of the 92nd/Buffalo.

The Good : Absolutely beautiful cinematography. If you could mute the sound (dialogue) one might think they were watching a pretty decent WWII era movie. Battle scenes were shot well. Uniforms were pretty dead on accurate and the weapons were accurate although  Thompson SMGs  and 1911 .45 caliber HGs did not have 100 round clips......

The Bad : Awful and embarrassing dialogue embellished with overacting which made it almost comical. Obligatory nudity. Soldiers using language and phrases that would be used only today. A German louspeaker that blares Axis Sally's propaganda for several square miles over the battlefield and is audible to all. Fragmented story with a total lack of cohesion (like this review). My favorite is the commanding white officer (Nokes?) stating that the Germans were going to cause a race riot by piping in the propaganda. I think that those valiant soldiers were more interested in staying alive and protecting their comrades than starting a race riot in Italy under fire. But then again this shows the mentality of Spike Lee and the writer.

The Ugly :  All white officers and soldiers portrayed as bigoted haters.  In one instance  the commanding officer refuses to believe members of the 92nd crossed the river so does not send supporting artillery strikes. His reasoning for this is ""He is lying"".
This same commanding officer condescendingly orders a black soldier to get him water. The black soldier spits into the canteen before giving it to white officer. Not only does this lower the mentality of the movie several notches but  also slanders the memory of those brave men of the 92nd/Buffalo that fought for their country.

This movie had potential, unfortunately it was executed by someone who was unable to deliver. It is filled with contemporary language, modern topics of discussion,  poor acting, and endless preaching about the evils of  America. Spike Lee had scolded Clint Eastwood for not having any African Americans in Iwo Jima and had wanted him to rewrite history. Well, Spike has done that with this movie.",1234310400,145,2459,4.882211538461538
3685397,1,B001LLH8S4,"Hyped as the greatest WWII film since 'Saving Private Ryan', this falls 'way' short of even being an interesting movie. Did the director, Spike Lee, think that throwing a few body parts around was going to put this in the save category as 'Saving Private Ryan'?

What was even worse, being a 'new release' this title wasn't discounted 'anywhere', as most new releases are on Tuesdays when typically new releases come out.

Initially listed at $29.99, marked down to $19.99, not initially listed at $19.99 marked down to around $15.00 for the first week of the release.

Initially listed at $29.99? For a 'single disk' DVD, not to mention a second rate film that didn't live up to all the commercial hype of it. And on top of that, 'NO' special features were included with the DVD!

I think I'm going to start ignoring all the hype of new releases, and instead of buying those I think I would be interested in, I'll go to a local 'Red Box' and pay a dollar to rent it first, and see if it's worth investing any money into, or something that I'll ever watch more than once.

This one will for sure go to the bottom shelf of my DVD library!",1234310400,14,1137,4.421052631578948
3685398,5,B001LLH8S4,"War movies have been used as tools of propaganda, and I've been of the opinion that any movie that tells the truth about war is an anti-war movie. But Spike Lee goes beyond those two narrow conceptions of war in Miracle At St. Anna. I think Mr. Lee is trying to capture the humanity and the miracle inherent in the human spirit.

Lee takes us into the world of four black soldiers caught in a town behind enemy lines in Italy during World War II. Some of the clich&eacute;s of war movies exist here, the men of different backgrounds and different values thrown together because of war, but Lee doesn't use these clich&eacute;s so we can fill in the blanks he delves into the character of these men showing us their foibles, idiosyncrasies, their strengths, their humanness. And you care about the men and the experience they go through. This same depth of character isn't reserved for the Americans, Lee allows us to see that all the participants of war aren't necessarily hero's or villains but people caught up in something others have created but they share the capacities for loving their families, enduring the hardships of war, as well as the horror of seeing your friends and comrades die in horrible circumstances and extravagances that we all can be pushed to.

Yes, the movie does have a couple sub-plots but none seem tacked on, an after thought, or distracting in fact those scenes add to our getting to know the characters better they are an organic part of the movie.

I was disappointed by the lack of special features, I usually like the making of documentaries, but every DVD doesn't need to have a gag reel. & the quality of the movie more than makes up for the lack of extras.

I think this may be the first fully actualized war movie I've ever seen. It may not line up to your expectations, it may shatter your pre-conceived notions, but it will move you. This is a movie made by a master of the art, or at least an artist at the height of his powers.",1234310400,13,1971,4.512605042016807
3685399,5,B001LLH8S4,"It is a wonderful story about black soldiers in WWII.  They were not accepted by many white Americans, but, readily accepted by the Italians.  There are references to the ""Sant'Anna di Stazzema massacre"" of Italian citizens by the German SS.",1234224000,6,241,5.0
3685400,4,B001LLH8S4,"Miracle at St. Anna is the latest film from director Spike Lee. It is his first war movie, and arguably only the second action-based thriller after 2007's Inside Man. The WWII period film actually opens in the early 80's: A post-office clerk (Laz Alonso) abruptly shoots a customer with a vintage military pistol. An ensuing police investigation finds an Italian stone bust worth millions in the suspect's apartment. A rookie reporter (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) prods him about it, and the main narrative begins: in 1944, four black men, members of the 92nd Infantry ""Buffalo Soldiers"" fight their way behind enemy lines in Axis-controlled Italy. They include the towering Train (Omar Benson Miller), level-headed Stamps (Derek Luke), preacher turned apostate Bishop (Michael Ealy), and Afro-Latin/de facto translator Hector (Alonso). Train obsessively carries the aforementioned bust, retrieved from a previous battle.

The quartet manages to find shelter in the Italian village of St. Anna- locals there include partisans who fight against the Nazis. The group also looks after an injured Italian boy (Matteo Sciabordi) with a dark secret, whose foreign tongue and vivid imagination endears him to the God-fearing Train. Meanwhile, resident cynic Bishop frequently butts heads with Stamps, not just over orders but in getting the attention of the pretty Renata (Valentina Cervi).

The narrative touches on the conflict and the comfort that the soldiers manage to find in the sleepy village: A Nazi radio broadcast mocks the soldiers' plight as they fight for a country that won't allow them to be served at a restaurant (a scene at an American ice cream parlor illustrates this, with a twist); the group openly dance and flirt with local women, and debate whether their efforts will truly have any impact back home. Conflict with a racist commanding officer threatens to undermine everything as Nazis march toward the town.

Lee adapted Miracle at St. Anna from James McBride's 2004 novel, who also wrote the screenplay. The film even manages to offer some quasi-sympathetic Nazis- one, an officer (who likes to read poetry) whose complaints about lack of food and supplies falls on deaf ears; another, a soldier who balks at slaughter of civilians. The cinematography from Matthew J. Libatique is at least as sympathetic as Ernest Dickerson's was to Lee's early work. Lots of wide shots are seen of the Italian countryside, giving scope to how overwhelmed and isolated the four protagonists are.

The film lingers a little too long in a few scenes with the villagers and a sub-plot involving a traitor among the partisans, and a court trial epilogue ends rather abruptly, but overall the story is extremely engaging, a portrait of men who sacrificed greatly not only for their country but for a community that was not afforded the same human rights that were being defended on the world stage.

Extras are minimal here; hopefully a deluxe 2-disc edition will eventually be available.",1234224000,,2982,5.1912681912681915
3685401,5,B001LLH8S4,"This movie is a Spike Lee gem which really should have received more acclaim.  It is so well done, even better than the book.  It looks at World War II from a different angle and reminds us there actually were Black soldiers -- unsung, unrecognized heroes.  It is quite moving -- and I am not a fan of war films.  This one is so different, though, it really deserves better recognition than it received.",1234051200,4,403,4.405405405405405
3685402,4,B001LLH8S4,"Fantastic!  I was deeply touched by ""MIRACLE AT ST. ANNA"" and its fictional story by James McBride and directed by Spike Lee.  But moreso for using the Blu-ray as a way to educate people of the African Americans who fought in World War II and many before that time.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

The film is presented in 1080p high definition (2:35:1).  Overall, the picture quality is very good.  Most of the scenes are all outdoor shots and the sunlight and the rain showers and the different weather patterns were featured well on video. Shot in a beautiful Italian village with the mountains in the backdrop, lush surroundings.  Really good location in terms of where they shot this film.

And of course, the film is full of action.  Similar to ""Saving Private Ryan"", the film has its share of violent moments and dismemberment.  Some scenes such as one part with the Nazi's talking on top of a mountain, displayed quite a bit of noise in the background, but that scene is fairly short, so nothing to worry about.  But all in all, very good picture quality.

The sound is featured in English 5.1 DTS-HD (48khz/24-bit) audio.  The sound is incredible.  From the battle scenes of hearing the multiple gun shots, missiles starting up from the rear channels of your speakers and then flying towards the sides and then front speaker channels and hearing the blast.  And then the subtle moments of hearing the rain all around you.  Those were well done and similar to the video, you definitely get very good audio quality as well!

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""MIRACLE AT ST. ANNA"" comes with three features and personally, I felt that the two major features are important because they interview African American Veterans who fought in World War II but also showcased the history of the ""Buffalo Soldier"".  Included in the special features:

  * Deeds Not Words - Director Spike Lee, Writer/Screenwriter James McBride and several veterans who served in World War II in Italy in a live roundtable discussion (about 18 min. long) in regards to their experiences in World War II and being in Italy, how they were treated and then how they were treated back home.  But to see how far African Americans have come and also talking about Obama being the next President (obviously, shot before he won the election).  Very good special feature!
  * The Buffalo Soldier Experiences - Learning the history of the Buffalo soldier.  A very informative documentary that is about 18 minutes long and went as far back from the Civil War to the present.  Also, a woman who talked about how she bonded with one of the men and has always wondered what has happened to the two guys that stayed in her village, not knowing if they lived or died.  But will always be grateful for their heroism.
  * Deleted Scenes - There were several deleted scenes and extended scenes.  Some that were rather important and wish they kept in the film but then again, with the film at 160 minutes already, it's going a bit long.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""MIRACLE AT ST. ANNA"" is an epic film which I enjoyed it a lot. In fact, after the film, I really felt it was fantastic.

But there are a few things that prevent it from being excellent.

Granted, compared to other war films and fictional and a bit far-fetched at times.  The death of the Italian man in the beginning of the film by an older Corporal Hector Negron is surprising that he's had a gun in his possession near the bank check out area where he works and waiting for revenge 40+ years after World World War II is a bit far-fetched.

As for timing, at 160 minutes, it is long and for some, the love triangle focusing on Renata, Stamps and Bishop may have tacked on some additional minutes which some may seem uncalled for.  But I actually felt the film needed it.  Because the truth is the Italians didn't have the racial intolerance towards Blacks like how things were in the U.S.  This village was the home of poor Italians, they didn't have TV.  They looked at the 92nd Infantry Division as heroes.  And thus, the men were treated as equals and some had relationships with the Italian women in the village.

If anything, I think that the storyline of the Italian Fascists who capture the Nazi was difficult because they are thrown into the movie with not much character development.  Were we supposed to care about these men?  Obviously one is a traitor but would one really go as far to have his countryman killed for revenge?

And then the use of characters such as reporter Tim Boyle (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), Enrico (John Leguizamo) or Colonel Driscoll (D.B. Sweeney).  Men that would seem to have an important part in the film but they don't.  If anything, they were used as transitional phases for other points in the film.

But I'm sure I can nitpick and find what could be edited or not be edited but personally, I was satisfied with the film.  It is a tearjerker.  These four characters that have different personalities, you do care for them but the adventure from beginning to end, I was left speechless.  Omar Benson Miller as Private First Class Sam Train was indeed the gentle giant and he had a wonderful performance.  As did the other three men, Michael Ealy, Laz Alonso and Derek Luke.  Great performances by these four men!

""MIRACLE AT ST. ANNA"" was really a fantastic film.  It had a good balance from action, heartwarming moments and scenes that captured your attention.  And the fact that you have a Blu-ray that does go into the Buffalo Soldiers and interviewing those who fought in the war and also those who were villagers in Italy in contact with the soldiers validating certain parts of the film and their experiences, it was great to have all that included in conjunction with the very good picture and audio quality in the Blu-ray.

Overall, ""MIRACLE AT ST. ANNA"" is a fantastic Blu-ray release that I recommend wholeheartedly!",1234051200,3,5849,4.666340508806262
