6131282,1,B00H47IWDY,It was an Ok movie and it was cute but once again it was the same old same old..good movie for young kids,1393200000,2,105,3.608695652173913
6131283,4,B00H47IWDY,I Never heard of the Producers or Animation company but this movie turned out to be very good which the whole family enjoyed.,1393200000,8,125,4.478260869565218
6131284,3,B00H47IWDY,"The good:
1. Good animation detail for main characters in the viewing area. Up there with the better made animations but not the best like ""Rango"" & ""Ratatouille"".
2. Acceptable (but nothing new) storyline of being different and going on a journey with the usual obstacles to prove your worth.
The not so good:
1. Background mattes or overlays were typical cheap production savers of a non-moving, still or unchanging scene. Leaves, clouds, grass, critters - just frozen in time. Miyazaki would roll over in his grave.
2. Voicing was OK at best and for the most part just didn't give character or emotion to our acting animals.
3. The customary animal song and dance numbers were really weak. Not catchy fun, not good music choreography. Additionally, a feeble attempt at introducing traditional African sounds.
4. The overall storyline was predictable and safe - actually a bit boring.",1392854400,8,886,4.993243243243243
6131285,5,B00H47IWDY,I gave this movie 5 stars as it kept the attention of both myself and my two boys during the whole movie. The characters were funny and the music was awesome. Great lesson learned through the movie.,1392681600,,198,4.378378378378378
6131286,5,B00H47IWDY,Excellent movie loved it a bit sad at times playback was great I would highly recommend this movie to my friends and family,1392681600,,123,4.391304347826087
6131287,5,B00H47IWDY,"this is a film that should  appeal to all ages. the story holds your attention, the characters are well done and the graphics are excellent.  the 3d  adds a nice feeling of depth and does not use the cheap looking  coming at you effect.",1392336000,2,236,4.295454545454546
6131288,5,B00H47IWDY,"I was lucky enough to ""discover"" this movie before it's release date and I can tell you I was blown away by it. It's a great kid's movie and a fantastic family picture. I really enjoy 3d movies and lately there hasn't been that many of them, so I ""picked up"" this movie only because it was all there was for something new out there, and because of it's low price I figured it won't hurt too bad if it turned out to be a waste of time. Boy am I glad I did! It's like discovering treasure, getting something for nothing! The 3d is some of the very best you've seen in a long time, the computer animation is really fantastic and the colors, what a joy. The story isn't really original, but it's time tested true..think the Lion King, only with a Zebra as the star..oh and no songs. Get this movie for yourself, for your kids, for your family..you'll be glad you did.",1391558400,23,863,4.204819277108434

6131324,3,B00H47IWDY,"I have to admit that I came into this film with fairly high expectations even though a majority of the reviews about it have been pretty negative.  The reason I figured Khumba would succeed despite the criticisms had all to do with the studio behind it (Triggerfish) and the CG film they released prior to this one- Adventures in Zambezia.

While Zambezia hadn't exactly forced Pixar back into becoming a software company, it did offer quite a bit of charm, had a stellar cast and somehow managed to dazzle visually despite a fairly modest budget.  Naturally, when I learned the same team was hoping to follow up the bird-centric Zambezia with a CG epic based on an outcast zebra forced into an exodus across the desert to achieve his destiny, I had pretty high hopes.  Suffice to say, I was indeed slightly disappointed with the end result but we'll get to that in a moment.  First let's take a quick look at the hard facts.

Released in October of 2013 and built on a budget of roughly $20-mil, Khumba (pronounced ""coom-ba"") tells the 85-minute tale of a half-striped zebra born into a superstitious herd from behind the shelter of a fence of foliage they built for protection.

Fearing his lack of hind-stripes as a bad sign (in this case a cause for drought), Khumba is rejected by most of his peers and elders and only in the dying breaths of his mother does he assemble the (fairly forced) trappings of a quest to find himself.

Taking on a self-exodus of epic proportion, the titular character (Jake T. Austin) sets forth from the comfort and shelter of the zebra safe-hold as well as the company of his father (Laurence Fishburne) and tomboy/ peer Tombi (AnnaSophia Robb) into the unforgiving and vast Karoo region.

Of course he is alone for nary a moment and ends up facing his destiny with a wide variety of odd cohorts including a shady wild dog named Skalk (Steve Buscemi), a  maternal and resilient wildebeest (Loretta Devine) and a moody ostrich (Richard E. Grant).  All the while he and his small band of like-minded travelers are pursued by the half-blind (but radar capable) leopard Phango (Liam Neeson).

There are many things Khumba does well and I can't stress the importance of this as a production.  First of all the models and textures look, once again, fantastic.  There are many different routes a studio can take when it comes to the concept of talking animals in CG.  Triggerfish opted for specimens with a wonderful blend of photo-realism and personification.  The visual appeal isn't limited to the characters either; the environments, effects like sunsets and lighting are all top notch as well.  Truly the look of the film is truly never in question when finding fault.

You also get some beautiful voice acting from some of the globe's top talent and, because the film was designed around the English-speaking cast, no concern of mismatched mouth flaps or mistimed dialog segments.  The well-cast performances are spot on and lend weight to the film right from the onset.

Now for the bad news.  The quest itself is fairly typical in its build, tension and resolve and, if I may be frank, a little less inspired than expected.  Sure there are grander themes at play here like the notion that beauty is more than skin deep, that it's wrong to judge others because they may look differently and the alienation that comes with teen-hood can be cured by seeking out a magic watering hole.  Wait scratch that last one.  Anyway, the point is that the plot structure is very copy/ paste by its nature and it falls victim to its own lack of cleverness on multiple occasions throughout the film.  Perhaps not the least of which is in the pacing, which makes the 85-minute run-time feel much, much longer.

Lessons come off as heavy-handed and unnatural and there are hints of some deeper plot threads floating about (like a wise mantis watching over Khumba's trek and the appearance of a gecko around every corner) that are never fully fleshed out.

I'm of the opinion Triggerfish knew the meat and potatoes of the narrative were sorely lacking and they did what they could to compensate for this by integrating multiple attempts at humor into the fold (to varying degrees of success).  As a result we get a weak musical number from the ostrich about being ostracize, an encounter with a wacky over-the-top sheep named Nora, some sort of tribal hierarchy rodent society etc.  These do provide brief distractions from the fact that we are trekking across the desert in nearly real-time on a pretty ridiculous mission but the experiences are largely forgettable and strangely vacant.

All in all, Khumba is loaded with great intentions and can be viewed as a decent family movie accordingly so long as the viewer(s) enter the film aware of the fact that the storytelling is absolutely nothing like we've come to expect from studios like Pixar, DreamWorks, Blue Sky and so on.  The film doesn't commit any major crimes so much as it brings nothing new, surprising or terribly interesting to the equation.  It is possible, in the interest of accuracy, they sought dryness in the film to represent the Karoo Desert in which the piece is set but somehow I suspect the narrative isn't where it belongs.",1424822400,,5219,4.764444444444444
