7094194,5,B00VM5HWK8,A moving film with the added bonus of getting a glimpse into the real Hawaiian culture not seen by most. An extremely interesting ensemble of scientists assembled to tell this interesting story of who we are and where were headed. Sobering and inspirational.,1430092800,,258,5.023255813953488
7094195,5,B00VM5HWK8,"Really a wonderful feature documentary.  Entertaining, informative and visually stunning to watch.  This is really a ""must see"" for everyone.",1429833600,3,141,6.0
7094196,5,B00VM5HWK8,"It's all about sustainability and how humans and nature can exist in harmony. This film is amazing in 4K, I highly recommend the Blu-Ray version so you can feast your eyes on the beauty of our world!",1429660800,2,199,4.405405405405405
7094197,5,B00VM5HWK8,"This film is extraordinary since it not only informs us about climate change, which many films do, but explores the reasons behind our collective inaction. In that way it is beyond politics. It uses evolutionary biology and psychology to help the viewer to wake up to the conundrum of our attitude towards climate change.  It is beautifully filmed and the insights of all the scientists, philosophers, farmers and modern thinkers are stunning in their clarity. It holds up a mirror and by confronting and hopefully digesting many of these difficult truth we might be able, as humanity, to face the difficult moment in time for our species.",1429660800,,639,4.97196261682243
7094198,5,B00VM5HWK8,A film which speaks the truth about who we are as a species and where we are headed. A truly inspiring and artful film combining evolution and evolutionary psychology with stories of what it takes to bring about the changes we so desperately need.,1429660800,,247,4.636363636363637
7094199,5,B00VM5HWK8,"An important film with gorgeous cinematography, stunning international locations and insightful commentary from the world's leading environmental scientists. You owe it to yourself to see this ultimately inspirational film that teaches us the way of the farmers who live off the land.",1429660800,2,284,5.785714285714286
7094200,5,B00VM5HWK8,Everyone needs to view this documentary. Maybe if it reaches enough people a large enough group can be formed to make changes. If only a major country would make the first move toward change as an example for the rest of the world.,1489622400,,231,4.395348837209302
7094201,3,B00VM5HWK8,"Raises awareness but does not provide steps to follow.

I give three stars because there are so many movies and clips raising awareness about the impending environmental disaster.

Yet only few videos give some steps to alleviate this issue.

Most people know that the world is quite polluted and getting worse. So what can we do?

Well, start by consuming less and recycling more.

Here are some steps.
1. Don't buy what you don' t need. Most of the times that is everything. Most US households have too many things already.
2. Drive less. You really don't have to go.
3. Recycle/ reuse. Don't throw it away!
4. Grow some of your own food. Saves money, time to go shopping, and it is healthier.
5. Don't buy stuff or invest in companies that are clearly polluting!
6. Don't litter/ Pick up trash. This is very easy to do but people rarely do it.
7. Encourage others to not waste :D",1487548800,4,882,4.4875
7094202,5,B00VM5HWK8,"Very important film which does not flinch from the critical juncture we are at and the need for human beings to become aware, accept the truth and take immediate action, before it really is too late.  Only disappointment is wish that more attention was paid to the animal-based food system as a contributor to climate change, deforestation, overuse and pollution of water.  Thank you for this wake-up call.",1482710400,,406,4.955882352941177
7094203,4,B00VM5HWK8,Very good and insightful.,1482537600,,25,5.5
7094204,5,B00VM5HWK8,"Good movie, makes you think, would have liked to hear more about some solutions. Was a little long and repetitive, but had good imagery and music.",1480896000,,146,4.653846153846154
7094205,5,B00VM5HWK8,the psychology and social behaviors were really quite important to bring up; why do we continue the unsustainable ways even though we know the facts? great documentary.,1480550400,,168,5.2592592592592595
7094206,5,B00VM5HWK8,I wish programs like this could be on the regular tv viewing of people who need to wake up and hear how the changes are coming exponentially in the past few years. No one even talks about the acidifying of the ocean or how the amount of land left doesn't matter when there's no water to support it.,1477699200,3,298,4.155172413793103
7094207,2,B00VM5HWK8,This documentary could have used some tighter editing. It seemed rambling and slightly incoherent.,1473984000,,98,6.071428571428571
7094208,5,B00VM5HWK8,Please Share this important film with all your friends. We need to understand that our daily choices matter.,1473897600,,108,5.055555555555555

8710514,2,B00VM5HWK8,It is very hard to concentrate with the musac in the background. It plays like a marketing presentation. The theme is very important and I am sure the experts that appear are knowledgable. The movie has no real thread. It jumps from subject to subject and then back. This movie needs a complete re-edit to make it viewable.,1530835200,,323,4.586206896551724
8710515,1,B00VM5HWK8,Do not watch/listen to this.  It is nothing but one-liners from experts coupled with extremely irritating music in the background.,1530403200,,130,5.5
8710516,5,B00VM5HWK8,"Some of the problems in this documentary have been known for decades, such as water shortages and strains on the food supply, but others may be new on the radars of many, such as the future of geo-engineering. Definitely worth watching.",1517529600,,236,4.780487804878049
8710517,5,B00VM5HWK8,"The human race is facing a perfect storm. We hear about the climate and behavioral science from the scientists, the plight of farming from the farmers (who laugh, flummoxed), and look to the peoples of the Hawaiian Islands to remember sustainability and living with the land within the confines of what was immediately available.
In growing peril are the basic resources necessary for human survival around the globe - where to live, what to drink, and what to eat. Destabilization of weather patterns are already fracturing living systems around the globe: in the Arctic, the South Pole, America's plain-based croplands and fields in California, as well as in the oceans, and elsewhere.
Our footing for life is being unzipped by oceanic and environmental destruction brought about by human activity.
It's just nice to have these lost or buried facts paired with clear, undiminished perspective.",1502582400,,895,5.222222222222222

8710520,2,B00VM5HWK8,"'The World Is Doomed'. Really. Not presenting this as a negative comment, but that's exactly what they 'want' you to 'see'. Awesome. Now what do we 'do' about it? The film like SOOooo many others of the same genre, continues and CONTINUES to take you around the globe into the organics of different traditions, farming styles, society, economics, pharmaceutical and vegetational prognosis, calamities, cost of living against yesterday to today... This painted picture is nothing more of than 'we are doing very badly' as a species. Granted. Get it. Got it. Love to hear the truth but not sure this film does anything other than paint the most morbid, 'we fu_ed up' picture out of humanity. Scholastically, I don't see where there's a benefit, so I can project one - in any way. I believe they 'tried' to fulfill a purposeful entity but see it drowned out in a myriad of sadness.",1495324800,,878,4.782894736842105

8710523,5,B00VM5HWK8,"Wow. Must watch. Depicts a terrifying reality of denial that hits home, opens your eyes, and somehow still manages to spark an inspiration to make a difference in our future however we can, while we can.",1489795200,2,203,4.666666666666667
