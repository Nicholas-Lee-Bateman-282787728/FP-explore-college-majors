3982297,5,B002STN6B6,Great Transaction! Easy and reasonable. Thank you! My little boy watches it everday many times. Great learning tool. Very satisfied with the results.,1324857600,,149,5.521739130434782
3982298,4,B002STN6B6,"Now my 3-year old definitely does not like Barney as much as Gavin, my 18 month old. Gavin loves the music and singing and I love the great Barney themes. He teaches the importance of manners, playing nice with others, and more! There are 19 Barney songs throughout the DVD, with my favorite ""Clean Up."" Honestly, Barney is not one of my favorites to watch, but he does teach good values and the music is catchy. It is also cute because the DVD begins with Baby Bop forgetting her manners, and Barney teaches the importance of being polite. I think this DVD would be great for kids as young as 1 years old and it is basically a great collection of Barney favorites. It is 65 minutes long which I think is just right.",1263513600,5,716,4.350746268656716
