The music is horrible.  Some of the exercises are okay, but more are just plain silly.  If you are looking for a good laugh, buy this DVD.  If you're looking for a real yoga practice, get Baron Baptiste's Core Power DVD.  It was filmed live, with real students, and is accompanied by an inspiring soundtrack by Krishna Das.
To respond to the second reviewer, I wasn't trying to say that Kundalini yoga is ""bad"" or not ""real.""  But really, there are many, many good yoga DVDs available.  This one's poor production is really distracting.  I suggested Baron Baptiste's Core Power DVD not because it's ""power yoga,"" but because it's GOOD.  I do not generally practice ""power"" style yoga.  I normally practice Anusara, Kripalu, or Sivananda styles.  But Baptiste's DVD is so good and effective, that it doesn't matter what style you label it.",1089158400,7,1019,4.765714285714286

8007289,5,B0001610SE,"Gurutej Kaur is a very thorough instructor. She explains each movement very well, and gives you explanations that make you understand why each movement is so important. I always feel more focused and alert after this workout. Her demeanor is also very kind and open which I appreciate since people in everyday life can be so nasty or cruel, or judge you based on how you look. I feel like if I met Gurutej, she would welcome me with a smile and no judgment. Thank you Gurutej Kaur for a great Kundalini workout!",1366675200,,511,4.505376344086022
8007290,5,B0001610SE,"This, as the other of Gurutej Kaur's videos, provides an enormously helpful range of teachings and tools, delivered in such a uniquely inspiring and grounded style. Thank you!",1364342400,,175,5.285714285714286
8007291,1,B0001610SE,"As someone who's had prior exposure to Kundalini yoga through hands-on classes, and has been studying/working with chakra energy for years, I can safely say this DVD will leave a beginner clueless. The exercises are basic hodge podge movements with no explanation of their origins. I've learned more off of YouTube than viewing this DVD.

Things lacking:

a) Lack of Kundalini instruction and explanation. Not even a simple mention of serpent-coiled energy.

b) Lack of clear instruction of our chakras and their purpose. Just mentions ""clearing your brain,"" or letting out ""bottled energy."" No mention of specific chakras, their effects on the body, associations, etc.

c) Terrible video editing - really funny they show you a snazzy cover with Gurutej on the beach, but in reality you're in the corner of somebody's house, and you can see the cars whizzing by outside. The entire video looks like a high school project.

I like Joan Price's review that states, ""Then, chakra by chakra, she explains and demonstrates."" Where? Did Joan even watch the DVD? Maybe she watched a different one than I did.

Bottomline: Looking to be a serious student of Kundalini and chakra energy work? Look elsewhere. Looking to spend an hour doing feel good exercises. Here ya go.",1219449600,4,1263,5.019138755980861
8007292,5,B0001610SE,"I love this yoga teacher...she is a little flaky, but her enthusiasm is so genuine. She is a ""free spirit"" and somehow, when I am doing this tape, I feel like one, too.  I love the variety of postures and movements, and the gentle way she teaches.",1166140800,5,247,4.25531914893617
8007293,3,B0001610SE,"In Chakra Yoga for Mental Balance, yogini Gurutej Kaur presents a Kundalini yoga based practice. Kundalini yoga is quite different from the more familiar hatha yoga styles, as it focuses mainly on rapid movements (as opposed to static poses) designed to awaken the body's energy. In her narration, Kaur emphasizes how the different exercises will stimulate the brain to help you feel both more relaxed and more alive.

The DVD is nicely broken down into 22 chapters, which includes the 20 exercises plus the introduction and closing mantra (chanting is included in each of these two segments). For each exercise sequence, Kaur spends about 30-90 seconds explaining the exercise and its benefits, and then for the next 1-3 minutes, she instructs via voiceover as you actually perform the exercise. The movements range from very easy, such as wrist rotations, to a few that are quite challenging, including a full backbend (wheel pose). The 20 exercises are as follows: 1) brain balance, 2) lasso pose, 3) standing forward stretch, 4) circle pose, 5) pulling energy, 6) wrist rotations, 7) kidney stimulation, 8) standing arm rotations, 9) thumb flips, 10) wings barely touching, 11) finger presses, 12) extended arms spiral flexes, 13) leg forward front bow, 14) shimmy, 15) back platform leg lifts, 16) wheel pose, 17) cat stretches, 18) neck rolls, 19) meditation, and 20) deep relaxation.

I have taken a few Kundalini classes in the past and have enjoyed them, and although the exercises on this video had a similar feel, there was not much that I recognized. Also, I thought that going back and forth between Kaur's live instruction and voiceover interrupted the flow of the practice; I would have preferred if she provided all of her instruction while actually performing the exercises. But my main disappointment with this video was the lack of focus on the chakras, or the seven energy centers of the body. I expected that ""chakra yoga"" meant each exercise would be specifically connected to one of the chakra centers, but this was not the case; Kaur only briefly mentions the concept of chakras in her introduction.

Although my body felt stimulated after performing this video, I still prefer my hatha practice, both for the feelings it brings me during and after. However, I suspect that more regular practitioners of Kundalini yoga are likely to make a better connection with this video than I did.",1129939200,11,2409,5.0175
8007294,5,B0001610SE,"I would recommend getting all 3 chakra yoga dvd's led by Gurutej Kaur to use as a complete total body series. I would also recommend adding ""Kundalini Yoga"" with Gurmukh to add an aerobic workout to these three. Top it off with a qigong practice and a hatha yoga session and that is 6 days of healing and strength building. By Sunday you should be buzzing around all over town spreading the joys and wisdom of yoga.",1129507200,10,415,4.402597402597403
8007295,4,B0001610SE,"I felt better when this DVD was done then I ever would have thought considering the relaxed pace. It was subtle, but I felt my body was ""shaky/humming"" after like after Qi Gong. What was weird was during, I am about 3 days from PMS & during, I felt like I was getting it right then & there & did get it a day early, when I am normally like clockwork & even this month thought I'd be a day late. I also felt my digestive ability working faster & better then normal with is usually weak with me.

She talks about meridians a lot & some of the movements looked like Qi Gong movements I've done & seen before. There were also some popular yoga positions, one she called half-wheel. There was some nice standing forward bends in the begining. Simple finger presses, and others that are not fair describe without doing to feel the effects. They all seemed simple when she talks about it & then takes concentration to do. She is alone in a simple room with flowers & rug nearby & has a sweet voice. Between each movement there is artwork & written is the name of the next one. The beautiful artwork I was suprised to learn in the credits was created by her.

I took off one star because in between each move, she sits in another place, telling you for up to 2 min what each move is going to be, how it's done, what it's good for in terms of the body, mind & spirit. After a few viewings, I feel the need to keep grabbing the remote to fast forward. I wish she could have given some of this information as you are actaully doing the moves so you don't get a bored, though a little rest is greatly appreciated, but I'd rather just hit the pause button.

If you aren't into Qi Gong or sensitive to energies to the point you notice them consciously, you may not feel the effects enough to feel the benefits since the exercises are so different then you normally see even in a yoga class & some seem almost too easy. There are some good stretchig, but most are very subtle.",1116201600,9,1961,4.210106382978723
8007296,5,B0001610SE,"This is the oldest form of yoga, it is esoteric, and it is not just about a workout. If you know nothing about kundalini then you may not like this workout, it's different. This workout is mainly to clear the aura, especially around the top chakras. Whenever I do this workout, my sinus problem leaves for a couple days. I plan on doing this one forever. I was also able to concentrate better at work. So this one is for mental clarity just like the title states. It's not for working up a sweat. It has to do with cleansing energies, meridians, mudras, chakras, breaking up stagnation & old cords. It's a spiritual workout that will brighten your being & create balance in your life. I was so amazed with this one that I ordered her other one for the body on VHS, I hope she puts the other one on DVD too. GURUTEJ, please make some more DVD's, I love your workout, the exercises you teach are very powerful & some I have never seen before, it's very exciting to me. I have all the kundalini DVDs out there & yours is one of a kind. Thanks!",1090713600,22,1040,4.257575757575758
8007297,4,B0001610SE,"I disagree with the previous person that said this is hokey and cheesy. It is a wonderful Kundalini practice! Guruteg Kaur instructions are very clear and she makes it fun! You start with a warm up, which is typical for Kundalini Yoga, then the challenging practice, and finally the relaxation. She uses a crystal chime during the relaxation, which is wonderful!!! I'm really not sure why the other person was so negative. (Real Yoga???) Surely Kundalini is not American Power Yoga, so please give this practice a try if you'd like to try an inspirational yoga practice. Also, try Ravi Sing's DVDs because his are very good if you're interested in experiencing Kundalini Yoga ...a real yoga ;o)
