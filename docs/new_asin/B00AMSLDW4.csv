5453314,5,B00AMSLDW4,"Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ

Prince Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston of Ten Commandments fame) was raised up with his best Roman buddy Messala (Stephen Boyd). Little did they know at the time that they would grow up become adversaries, and as a result this would lead to may adventures. In the process Judah leads many different lives that parallels and crosses the life of Jesus.

We see Judah in the mines, on the galleys, and even adopted by a roman Noble man as young Arrius. Mean time back at home his family is incarcerated by Messala leading to trials and tribulation that only Jesus can correct.
-------------------------------------------------

A lot of time and money went into this MGM production that netted 11 Academy Awards, along with many others such as BAFAT, David di Donatello, Directors Guild of America, Golden Globes, Laurel, Writers Guild of America, etc.

You will be so intrigued that you may not notice the 212+ minutes depending on the version.

One highlight, the chariot race was reproduced many times in various forms.

===========================

The definitive Ten Commandments.

An interesting title as the Commandment part is a tad closer to the end of the movie. Cecil B. DeMille takes a few liberties with history; however if he did not then this would have been some dry documentary instead of a great epic. This story is more of the life and times of Moses from birth to the last farewell. We see rivalry, temptation, brick making and dancing girls.

One item that Cecil tactfully worked around is where do you think Anne Baxter ...Nefretiri came from? Can you say sister? As the bloodlines from Egyptians, came through the women. That is why who ever married her would become pharaoh.

The graphics are great for the time; the plagues are really spooky and we all still hold the image of the parting of the sea. The acting has that 50's epic feel. Elmer Bernstein's music adds a hidden dimension to the story and you will not be able to get it out of your head. Edward G. Robinson made a great Dathan; He gets to be a modern day Dathan in Key Largo (1948). Is it not interesting that Pharaoh Rameses in The Prince of Egypt - DTS (1998) looks like Yul Brynner?

This is the one version most people relate too. The story has been told before and after this version. Some people know this version better than the real one.

The story moves right along and kept me captivated for the entire 3 hours of each movie. A copy of the original Been Hur theater booklet was included, which talks about the making of the movie.  Fun to look through. The video content about the making of the movie was also included. It dispelled the decades old rumor that a stunt man was killed during the chariot race scene. They go over how the trample scene was choreographed with a weighted dummy body. Yakima Canute, the master of all stuntmen, was interviewed, along with Charlton Heston.",1506902400,2,723,4.784

Perfect for the Season:
The colors from Paramount's VistaVision spectacular, The Ten Commandments (1956), are beautifully restored in this 50th Anniversary Re-Release. Filming took place from October 1954 to August 1955 both on-location (Egypt) and in-studio (Hollywood), making for vibrant sets and crisp Dolby sounds suitable for this lively part of the year!

Sharing in this double-feature is MGM's colossal attraction, Ben-Hur (1959). Boasting the full 222 minute cut and featured in its original rich anamorphic, Technicolor presentation, this picture shot almost entirely on-location in Italy will boldly breathe in the vernal season!

Perfect for the Family:
Far too often are films from this era discounted for their presumed ""dated"" material. However, there truly is a timelessness in motion pictures of which these two titles are fine examples. Many lessons can be taught, shared, and learned within the family from these stories. Although the Motion Picture Production Code was still enforced, this latter half of the 1950s showcased filmmakers making more daring moves. Make no mistake: a 'Family' film doesn't necessarily mean it is for children only. Adult guidance is needed to help interpret some of the images and dialogue in these features, such as Ben-Hur's scene on a slave ship and the plagues of The Ten Commandments--some of them depicted more brutally than the source material.

Perfectly Frugal:
Yes, there are more expansive collections available for each of these titles, and with expanse comes expense. This collection is light on the wallet and still full on the features! The Ten Commandments gets a clear Dolby Surround mix, and Ben-Hur is treated with an atmospheric 5.1 Surround from Dolby Digital. Each film is presented in its original aspect ratio--1.85:1 for The Ten Commandments, 2.76:1 for Ben-Hur--and both made to fit the standard 16X9 home screen (this means that black bars will be at the top and bottom to preserve the original ratio; to view a more true presentation, the images will need to be projected with accommodating anamorphic lenses/screens). Add in commentaries, an isolated score, and trailers, and you'll discover just how more than worth the price this collection is!",1491350400,,2425,5.727777777777778

He already owns the Ben Hur movie on DVD, but he did not own The Ten Commandments movie and this combo pack was significantly cheaper than the Ten Commandments DVD sold individually. I have not seen the Ben Hur movie, but I can vouch for The Ten Commandments that it is absolutely amazing! I have watched it ever since I was a young child and enjoy watching it still today. Charlton Heston is a great actor who does an incredible job portraying Moses. Note that the movie does deviate in many ways from the biblical account, including romantic relationships that clearly did not take place, but hey, its Hollywood. It is a clean movie and families will enjoy watching it together. I know my father will be thrilled to own this movie, and maybe I will get his old copy of Ben Hur. ;) I definitely recommend it to anyone interested!

I feel Ben holds a slight edge over Commandments only because there is the slightest feel of Sunday School cartoonism to the Commandments that maybe most people would not even notice. I purchased these treasures from Amazon when the set was only $9.99. What a deal. I grew up with these movies and feel proud to own these beautiful looking motion pictures.

5454067,5,B00AMSLDW4,"You will not regret this purchase. I grew up watching The Ten Commandments every Easter with my parents (my dad would normally fall asleep before it ended because it is so long) and I've begun watching it with my kids now that I have my own. I have yet to watch the BEN-HUR copy from this set, but just getting the set for The Ten Commandments is more than worth it.

This is the remastered version of The Ten Commandments and they did an absolutely amazing job remastering this movie. When the movie started and I saw how clean and vibrant the colors were I would have thought this movie was just recently filmed. The quality is that good. The actors and actresses look fabulous and the sets and backdrops are breath-taking now that is its cleaned up. I'm fairly certain the movie looks better now than it did when it was first filmed. On a large high definition television you actually get the sense that you are present during the movie sequences. The sound quality of both films is great as well. Listening to these films in DTS-HD just adds to the immersive quality of the restorations.

This is a 4 disc set, two discs for each movie. Both movies are remasters, but the remastering for The Ten Commandments is clearly better than that for BEN-HUR. I briefly put in the BEN-HUR movie just to check the quality. It is very good also.

The story in the movie is so good. Great lesson for kids so even though the movie is very long its well worth sitting and watching with them. the performance by the actors and actresses still holds up to any modern acting today. I love this movie and this version specifically is jaw-dropping.

The sound is very good. The picure quality verys from camera angles to sceanes. At times the picture is bluray true and at times you get dvd level of clearity. The audio always is crisp.

Stalag 17 is even quality through out the picture. The video very good. It seems clean and h.d. i thought the films print must of been the limit to quality. The audio was mono but clear.

I purchased the set for stalag and was happy to pay 7.88. Amazon.

The Ten Commandments is one of my favorite movies.  It is pretty much as the bible states but there are some ""Hollywood"" scenes which are not in the bible.

I hadn't watche either of these in probably about 45 years. I was stunne at how well they've stood the test of time; and indication of a true classic.
The video transfer to Blu-Ray is outstanding as is the Dolby Digital Sound reproduction.

Edith Head doing the costume work! Just another indication of the type of quality you're in for with these films.",1430956800,,564,4.686868686868687

DeMille's adherence to the Scriptures in producing The Ten Commandments (compared to the recently produced ""Exodus,"" which falls into complete disrepute with its ""dramatic license""). That's what makes The Ten Commandments and Ben Hur the epics that they have become, and why Exodus will fade from view shortly.",1430352000,2,457,4.9480519480519485

5454844,4,B00AMSLDW4,"Getting two classic movies for one relatively low price was a deal I couldn't pass up.  Both movies are very good, two of the best of the period of epic-style, cast-of-thousands productions from the 1950s and 1960s.  The visual quality of both sets of Blu-ray disks is stunning.  The other production qualities of the movies are generally top notch.  The one thing I dislike is the ""plodding"" pace of the dialog and the scenes in general.  I much prefer the snappier pace of the dialog in a movie like ""The Maltese Falcon.""  With the exception of the chariot race scene, ""Ben-Hur"" particularly suffers from a slow pace.  The camera loves to linger on close-ups of Heston as Hur as he agonizes about the various aspects of his life.  At times I thought I was watching a silent movie actor.  Still, the movies are more interesting than most of the modern day ""shoot-em-ups"" that pass for movies today.",1428537600,,899,4.67515923566879

I never saw the movie in the theater.  I watched the Blu-ray version last evening and was spellbound.  I saw colors and detail that I never saw in the 40 plus years of viewing this movie.  The detail is spectacular.  Costumes have visible threads.  The scene with the gifts from Ethiopia!!!  Amazing!!  We froze the movie several times just to view the colors and costume detail.
I have not yet seen Ben Hur but will add additional comments once I have, I just had to get the review for the Ten Commandments online.

You can even see the texture in the cloth!  All of this doesn't come at the price of a harsh or brittle looking picture like sometimes happens with an HD release of a classic movie.

I'm pleased the introduction by Cecile B. DeMille was included, and thrilled that the DVDs have scene selections as I was unable to watch it one setting.  Only negative is the case as others have mentioned, but for the price I paid, I'm not complaining.  Buy it, you will love it!",1406332800,,604,4.163793103448276

This double blu-ray is a MUST-BUY,the picture quality is above expectations,bearing in mind the age of these two classics,this is blu-ray at it,s finest,reference level!!!!! I kid you not.
Now,a bit about what you get,4 discs,aye,FOUR DISCS,packaged beautifully,there is no point in reviewing the films,Hollywood at it,s BEST,I completely agree with one previous reviewer,when you think about today,s CGI then think about some of the scenes in both these classics,REAL PEOPLE!!!!! it,s quite mindblowing,aye,as the old saying go,s,""they just don't make them like that anymore"".
I was very lucky to purchase this double blu-ray at a price of $14.97,including p&p,in one of amazon.com,s sales,I,m delighted to now own them,I can watch them anytime,particularly Xmas.

At first they are friendly, but his friend tries to convince him of the supremacy of Rome which Judah does not like and they have a falling out. In the power play that follows, Judah is exiled and goes on an adventure that sees him rising up again from the bottom.

In The Ten Commandments (1956), Heston stars as Moses in the epic biblical drama of the life of Moses.

I would still like to get the ""Ben-Hur Clloectors Edition"" sometime soon.  But I digress.  I found this duel movie Blu-Ray at Costco (Big Suprise).  As I Love both of these, I bought this mostly for Ben-Hur, but secondarily because I don't always want to open up my Ten Commandments Collector edition just to watch it.  I want to be able to enjoy the Collectors Edition on Special occasions (Like on Yom Kippor or Passover).  I like this two in one because I can watch either one without feeling bad about opening up the collectors edition (except on the Holy Days).  Plus I can put it on my Blu-Ray/movie shelf without finding a special place for it (like I do the collectors edition).
  Plus they are two great Epic Movies.  Both are well done.  With great color.  Lavish sets (The 10 Commandments was filmed in alot of locations in Egypt & the Sinai Penesula Area).  And of course both have Charlton Heston (GREAT ACTING BY HIM!!!!!  And let's not forget the All Star cast in the Ten Commandments like: Yvonne De Carlo, John Derek, Yul Brenner, Vincent Price, Edward G Robinson, et al).  So do yourself the favor & get this today

5455518,5,B00AMSLDW4,"This review is for the Bluray twin-pack of ""The Ten Commandments"" and ""Ben-Hur"". The trailers and advertisements for many films speak of ""Thrills"" and ""Magnificence"" and being a ""Once In A Lifetime Experience"" ! Usually it's exaggeration. For these two works of art, it is fact! If you haven't already joined the ranks of Bluray viewers, this set alone is reason enough to do so. Can I award 10 stars? Incredible picture and sound! Looks nearly 3-dimensional. What breath-taking detail on behalf of the producers and directors. Each film is presented on two disks ( total of four Blurays), and overtures as well as intermissions, etc. included). The commentaries are incredible, especially for ""The Ten Commandments"". You'll be amazed at the insights and details! Like taking a College course! Fun as can be. Multiple trailers are here, too. I'd seen ""The Ten Commandments"" many times on TV, but this is the first time I'd watched ""Ben-Hur"". All that I can say is it makes my list of all-time great films hands down! The chariot race is, of course, crazy-great, but there is so much more to it. ""Ben-Hur"" netted 11 Oscars out of 12  nominations, including Best Actor for Charleton Heston and Best Picture. It's easy to see why.(In the interest of full-disclosure, there is one scene with Heston in Jack Hawkins' chamber on the ship where there is a ""skip"" of a few film frames. Not a biggie, a surprise glitch, perhaps present in the original film).This two-movie set is an incredible bargain for two movies, each of which take film-making to a unique high place. Awesome!!!",1390003200,12,1574,4.873134328358209

5455545,5,B00AMSLDW4,"Let me start off by saying, yes these are both the remastered 50th anniversary editions of Ben Hur and The Ten Commandments that are sold separately for the same price as this double feature. Yes there are four Blu-rays in the case, two for Ben Hur and two for The Ten Commandments. And yes this is really is as good a deal as it seems. If you are looking to add these two movies to your collection, this is the one to buy. The only thing that you are giving up by buying this double feature is having one extra case on your shelf.
As far as the movies themselves go, the remastering job on both is incredible. The video quality looks as good as movies that are filmed today, and the audio has been remastered into DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, and sounds awesome. The films are also complete, with parts of the films, especially Ben Hur, that I've never seen before.

The two films did get different treatment though, and I must admit that I like the remastering on The Ten Commandments better.

Ben Hur which was shot on 65mm film, maintains it original theatrical ultra-widescreen aspect which requires letter boxing at the top and bottom of the screen. If there is a let down for me, it is the audio remastering. While it is remastered in DTS-HD 5.1, the EQ was not reworked to give the voice track especially, as well as the music tracks the depth and bass that we are used to in todays films. Instead they have more of a tinny sound that was the norm for films of their day.

The Ten Commandments is presented in a 16x9 aspect ratio which eliminates the black bars on the top and bottom and fills the screen completely. The other big difference is the audio EQ was done so that the full depth of the sound, which does sound as good as films made today, fills the room with the DTS-HD 5.1 surround sound. The full presence of Charlton Heston's voice is faithfully reproduced, as well as the magnificent music throughout the film.

So in short, if you are wanting to add these two classics to your library, this is a no brainer.",1388707200,189,2027,4.382978723404255

""The Ten Commandments"" has an AMAZINGLY beautiful picture, with very accurate colors (as with the flesh tones, for example), vivid colors, and it's EXTREMELY sharp.  The audio is excellent as well. BluRay.com lauds this blu-ray as being one of the best ever done, the standard for how to remaster a film for blu-ray, and I agree strongly.  You will be amazed, literally, by the gorgeous HD picture quality. I'm very pleased with this purchase.

You can literally see the threads and other small intricacies in the clothing and backgrounds, and of course in the actors' faces, right from the movie's very beginning. GREAT job on this film's Blu-Ray picture, just beautiful HD quality.  The very best blu-ray of an older film, quality-wise, that I've seen!  The movie looks about 40 years newer than it is!

I have always loved this film for its story, script, and acting.  One of my favorites; a long film that you seem to get through quickly, not tediously, every time.

Both movies are split into 2 discs each, broken at the intermissions (thus 4 total discs in this package), but this is done to allow for high MbPS transfers-- just what we customers should want.

The second disk also has another interlude and that is a pain when you just want to watch the picture. Other then that the movie is great and looks like it come out in this year.

I admit this one is a bit soap operaish. But with Charlton Heston, how can you go wrong. Get a lot of popcorn.

In Ben Hrur, the betray of a child-time friend to rob of his wealth and to gain political position was eventually defeated by the great family bound, faithfulness of the servants, and most of all, by the love and faith ii Jesus Christ. A great cast, good performance, including that of the villain Boyd, and the epic chariot race are all vividly re-captured by the  high-res blu-ray presentation with sharpness and brilliant colors. It's a DeMille's great worthy of watching again and again.

The Ten Commandment is a all-time best biblical story about Moses fulfillment of God's salvation to lead the Hebrews free from Farah's bondage.

'Ten Commandments' was sourced from a VistaVision print. VistaVision was a system that used 35mm film sideways- like a 35mm still camera and that gave a frame twice the size of regular vertically shot cinema film. Needless to say that it too looks spectacular in HD.,1369353600,33,440,4.653846153846154

5455688,5,B00AMSLDW4,"I was surprised when I saw that these two Charlton Heston films had been slated for release as a Warner Brothers ""Double Feature"" with a list price under $20. I paid $14.95, or about $17 with tax through amazon.

Surprised because ""Ben-Hur"" was just re-released in a painstaking and expensive ""50th Anniversary"" remastering in 2011, and that is the version included here (all that money spent and there's STILL distortion in the soundtrack at some points!). Surprised again, because ""The Ten Commandments"" received its latest and greatest remaster in 2011 as well in a 6K ""Two-Disc Special Edition,"" and that SE is the version included here. In fact, Amazon lists the price of that 2-BD SE of ""Ten"" at $21.95 (!?), which is $7 more than the selling price of the Double Feature set under review. Go figure.

There are FOUR BDs in this set. Both movies time out at over 3 hours long, so they are each spread over two BDs, breaking at the most-natural point imaginable: the Intermission. I think that both movies could have been fit on one BD each, but whatever.

As far as extras go, ""Ben-Hur"" contains an informative commentary by film historian T. Gene Hatcher with Charlton Heston, and a music-only track showcasing Miklos Rozsa's award-winning score and the theatrical trailers. I would mention that the UCE of this film contains an additional disc that is absolutely loaded with extra features, including the silent movie version from 1925. The extras on ""Ten"" include three trailers (with that from 1956 being of an extended length and featuring Cecil B DeMille himself), a commentary track, and a short newsreel of the 1956 NYC premiere on Disc 2.

So you get these two classic films - the huge spectacle, the bad acting (""Oh, Moses, Moses!"") and everything else - for next to nothing. You can buy the films as a twofer and save around $5, or you can buy them separately for around $10 each. The fantasy that is the Bible and Bible-related fictions like Ben-Hur never looked better than they do in these 1950s Hollywood epics...and you can now get them on BD for about what it would have cost you and your date to see them in a theater back in the day.

More evidence that we are fast approaching the days when hardcopy media for films and music will be a thing of the past. One can buy BDs of classic films for next to nothing these days. BDs are cheaper than DVDs ever were, just as DVDs were eventually cheaper than VHS ever was. If prices continue their downward trend, they'll be selling BDs at cost within the next two years...at which point, the studios will most likely say, ""why bother?""

Enjoy owning your own copies of these spectacles while you can.

Recommended.",1363046400,43,2680,4.68936170212766
5455689,5,B00AMSLDW4,"The brilliant restoration and remastering of DeMille's Epic Masterpiece THE TEN COMMANDMENTS is one of the best if not the greatest one I have seen on high definition so far for a classic film.  Working with the original Vista-Vision 35mm negative source may account for that.  It even surpasses BEN-HUR's remastering that tends to carry slight deficiencies in contrast levels during some dark scenes.  TEN COMMANDMENTS turned out 100% perfect.  Comparable to the high quality excellence that the Walt Disney Company invests in order to restore their classic animated masterpieces to look better than they ever will in high definition.  TEN COMMANDMENTS is not only the most popular Biblical epic of all time, it is the highest grossing one as well in the Biblical genre.  Due to the attention to details and dedication poured into the making of this time-less classic film, it should have won Best Picture and all the major award categories below that during the 1957 AMPAS ceremonies.  Charlton Heston should have received his first oscar 3 years before and then get a 2nd one in 1960 for Ben-Hur.  Edward G.Robinson was perfect in his portrayal of Dathan and should have received the Best Supporting Actor award for that role.  I guess Academy members back then enjoyed watching Cantinflas dangling from a balloon in Around the World in 80 Days better than being moved by the finger of God writing His Ten Commandments on granite stone atop Mount Sinai.  Both masterpiece Biblical epics should not be missing as part of every home entertainment film collection.",1363046400,95,1564,5.0271317829457365
