5191244,5,B008YRL79O,"Martin Taylor is a dad that is out of touch with his entire family. When he realizes that his family needs to reconnect before it's too late, Martin hatches a really crazy plan that will bring the family together for Christmas or tear them apart forever.

Surprising his family right at Christmas, Martin decides that the entire family will unplug from the world for 3 days. Taking the idea to the extreme, Martin blacks out the windows, turns off all power and water to the house and refuses all contact with the outside world.

At first his family fights back in a big way. After all, they have some last minute Christmas shopping plans for the day. When they finally see Martin's heart behind his crazy plan, they all agree to band together for their very own 3 Day Test.

This video was a fun film that every age in the house seemed to enjoy. At times the plan rivals the slapstick survival of the ""Home Alone"" series which provides for some comedic breaks between some more serious family bonding times. With its lovely family-centered message, 3 Day Test is a great film for a family movie night during the Christmas season or any time of the year.

I received this DVD complimentary from EchoLight in exchange for an honest review but the opinions in this review are all mine.",1358812800,6,1283,4.565217391304348

5191246,5,B008YRL79O,"They loved it. They watch movies a lot and love to watch family movies.
I am glad I purchased it.",1358553600,,97,3.9
5191247,2,B008YRL79O,All the actors did a very fine job but I found the story line and script to be poor.  Expected better quality from Corbin Bernsen.  But it was funny in many spots and totally family friendly.,1357516800,,191,4.277777777777778
5191248,3,B008YRL79O,"Expected a bit more development of the story & interactions.  Some funny parts, but the ending was somewhat weak.  Could have been much more than it was...",1356652800,,155,4.703703703703703
5191249,5,B008YRL79O,"I loved this movie! Qudos to EchoLight for putting family first and wanting to put out family friendly movies.

The 3 Day Test shows that when a family 'unplugs' itself for 3 Days they draw closer to their family and find out what really makes them happy.. and it's not all the 'things' in their lives.",1353974400,3,302,4.392857142857143

5191275,5,B008YRL79O,This was a fantastic family movie!  I am not a movie critique but just a dumb ole country boy who is tired of the filth on movies and television today.  This was a movie for any age and it was clean movie with a theme.  Well Done Corbin!,1392163200,,237,3.8958333333333335
5191276,3,B008YRL79O,"... but what is it about the directors of some of these more explicitly faith-based movies? I am a Christian.  I believe in the premise of the movie, which I take to be that modern tech culture has harmed how families work, has made us too dependent on our toys, and perhaps we need to back away from all that tech and learn how to be human again, especially with those we say we love. I get that.

But for some reason, you can really tell the difference between a movie with so-so direction that is slipping into preachy-ness, versus a first class adventure or comedy or romance that is so engaging it never once lets you realize you're watching a movie, let alone get preachy.  That to me, is the measure of a good movie.  You never see actors, sets, special effects, etc.  Instead, you have an experience. You suspend your disbelief from the first to the last.  There is never a lapse. And if there is some great truth to learn, it's woven perfectly, seamlessly into the fabric of the story itself.

This movie falls short of that standard. The plot is simple. A dysfunctional family is growing more and more disconnected until the dad realizes his survivalist elder brother may have a solution: pretend for three days that the modern world as you know it has been blown away and it's just you and your family, all alone, trying to survive, and finally coming together as a team.

But there comes a point in the story where, for me at least, I fell out of the movie and into the ""what are they doing"" zone? It happens when they have to chop up a piece of furniture for firewood. Everybody knows they're just pretending. In our house, the wife is not going to just let me chop up some old piece of furniture for a game. They didn't build any motivation into it. I couldn't see it happening, not even in the universe created by the story.  It wasn't real. I started seeing the actors as just people reading a script uncritically. They weren't really there, in the story, either. So why should I be?

From that point forward it became work to finish watching it.

Others may enjoy it more than I did, and it was a movie where you didn't have to worry about anything happening that might bother your four year old. Well, except perhaps for that one scene with the angry doll.  THAT was creepy, and one of the better moments in the movie. But other than that, harmless fun. Though I think it could have been a great deal more fun with top notch direction.",1390608000,,2453,4.3907284768211925
5191277,5,B008YRL79O,"This one is a delight. Takes place during Christmas season, with light 'religious' overtones. Is a sweet, funny movie. Worth the price to own it or just rent it. By Corbin Bernsen.",1388793600,,180,4.65625
5191278,4,B008YRL79O,This was very good family movie no cussing just down home fun!!! The teens love it and so did my 20 year old.,1382918400,2,109,3.782608695652174
5191279,4,B008YRL79O,"What an awesome (though contrived) and fun movie.  Highly suggested as a possible stimulus for conversation for husbands and wives hoping to bring their families closer.  The movie accurately details some of the struggles families face in today's world, and one family's novel way to refocus within.  Hate to see the low rating on IMDB.  Conservative family-oriented movies that aren't crude, aren't violent, or that don't push the limits of good taste appear to generally struggle harder for worthy ratings.",1381017600,4,508,5.3125
5191280,5,B008YRL79O,"Enjoyed - was a family friendly movie- these days families need,and should, ""unplug"",and spend real time together. Get this and watch as a family :-)",1380758400,3,149,5.0

8532655,3,B008YRL79O,"Just ok. A good attempt at a different Christmas movie but just didn't work entirely
. I was a little disappointed. Wanted it to be a great family holiday movie. It's a bit slow and imitates a few other movies.",1517702400,,210,4.275
8532656,2,B008YRL79O,"I'm sorry, but a father locking his family away with no heat, no water and no access to the outside world does not sound like a heartwarming family film. In reality, this would be the actions of an abusive, controller... Yikes.",1493337600,,227,4.560975609756097
8532657,2,B008YRL79O,"Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for this kind of movie.  It seemed so unlikely that I couldn't continue watching it.  There's a man who has locked his family in and a man who decides to do the same.  Getting rid of all the things taken for granted ... including light, power, heat, outside views, etc.  That's when I stopped watching it.",1482537600,,337,4.301587301587301

8532659,2,B008YRL79O,"I was disappointed in this movie myself.  It has a great idea of focusing on the fa mk Ilya without the distraction of modern gadgets, but it takes a strange turn. It's a clean family movie. Children would probably enjoy it. It just wasn't exactly what I expected.",1481241600,,264,4.5
