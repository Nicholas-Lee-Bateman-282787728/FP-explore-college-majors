2105213,3,B0002MH1SA,"This set is called the authorized DVD collection, but should have offered a lot more. It offers some in depth interviews and nice perspective into Tiger's life from Tiger himself from his childhood to his excellent career through the 2004 season, but that's really it. The bonus footage is just ok, but not really that exciting with some features from Tiger's clinic and more interview footage as well as some commercials and a few shots.

The Majors bonus footage is simply too short. It would have been nice to have more of Tiger's artistry on the course featured rather just a couple minutes of clips per major. And especially with his 97 Masters breakthrough. Far more time should have been devoted to that, as his 2000 season and 2001 Masters triumph to cap off the Tiger Slam. He is chasing Jack's records and to give such little footage of his major footage spoils it a bit.

I am a huge Tiger fan, but I can only recommend this to big fans like myself who want to fill out their Tiger collection. I know the DVD's aim was to focus on Tiger the man, but Tiger the man wouldn't be Tiger without Tiger the GOLFER and that footage should have been equally portrayed on this DVD. The Clinic footage was pretty bland as well. Personally since this is 2013 and Tiger now has 14 majors vs the 8 he had back then I think they should consider remaking this DVD package with a more balanced approach to his life and his extraordinary golf. I would be willing to pay for set that examines his life (without being gossipy and salacious, but would put a flawed Tiger in proper perspective with his moving on after his marriage ended, but not having that as the focus of course) and especially his new triumphs like the 2008 US open. That was a real test of adversity with an ailing Tiger hobbling around on one knee battling like a warrior for a 14th major. I believe a new set could put him and his career more in perspective and would be worth a purchase for even more casual fans. This set however is pretty average and doesn't do his legacy justice.",1360972800,,2047,4.441489361702128

Oh, brother

Pathetic",1281744000,,102,4.2631578947368425
2105217,4,B0002MH1SA,"I really enjoyed watching this DVD series.  I think it showed the other side of Tiger which proves he had difficulties in his life just like the rest of us.  I think it showed the human side of him rather than just the professional golfer which he never showed.  I think this series is a great addition to a DVD collection if you are a true Tiger fan.  I would purchase this even after the recent issues with Tiger, he is still a great golfer.",1263081600,3,443,4.176470588235294
2105218,4,B0002MH1SA,"This is not a 5 star product, unfortunately. I love watching Tiger each week, but this DVD collection could have been a lot better, given what he has done in his career. There are good gems about how he was raised, and how he gets into the zone while playing, but there is a lot of ""fluff"" considering the person they are talking about. By fluff, I mean praise for Tiger Woods instead of good content. They could have done a lot more in the way of teaching golfers how to get better. It's more of a documentary and bio than anything that will improve your game a ton.

At $9 used, its worth it for any true Tiger fan, but don't pay much more for it.",1235692800,,649,4.110236220472441
2105219,3,B0002MH1SA,This wasn't as good as I had expected. These DVDS started very slow and never picked up. The bonus features were very cool.,1151193600,2,123,4.391304347826087
2105220,5,B0002MH1SA,"For true Tiger fans this is the ultimate collection, especially since Tiger Woods has been very private about his personal life. In this set he talks about his family and his thoughts and feelings during his childhood and teen years and also shows the fun side of his personality which we rarely see on the golf course. The interviews are a very important part of this collection and the bonus features are the icing on the cake, but if you are mostly interested in actual golf footage, then buy the DVDs of his major wins, but if you want to see the personal side of Tiger this is the Collection to have.",1118275200,9,605,4.410714285714286
2105221,2,B0002MH1SA,"Really disappointed in this set. Far too much fluff and not enough substance here. Was looking forward to the clinic, but there was nothing there of exception. You can find most of this footage on the Channel. My advice? If you must see this: Rent don't buy. Not worth $50, and probably not worth half as much used.",1110844800,4,315,4.448275862068965
2105222,5,B0002MH1SA,Tiger woods has truly made me appreciate golf far more than I ever did before. He truly is One of a Kind. He has already changed the game&He up the Ante. He has Won 8 Majors&shows no signs of Slowing down. Props to the Brother for doing His Thing. this is just the start when his career is over He will be Called the Greatest  Ever.,1107561600,3,332,4.03030303030303
8029448,5,B0002MH1SA,"What a terrific bargain! Almost four hours on three DVDs for two-and-a-half bucks, which roughly works out to about a penny a minute. Although the set I bought was used, its indistinguishable from the new product.

Although Im not a golfer, I like to read about champion athletes and see them on the screen. There may in fact be too many interviews in Tiger, the Authorized DVD Collection. But they're easy enough to zip through to the next coverage of Tiger swinging a club. The HD production values are very fine through the entire set: the camera work, the spoken audio, and the music which is softly played and therefore not irritating, though it is repetitive. Theres none of the highly annoying video-and-audio flash-bang characteristic of so much sports coverage we see these days for all manner of championship athletic events.

If you can buy a copy of this for less than three dollars, your money will be well spent, even if you're not a golfer.",1525478400,,955,4.746987951807229

I wasn't disappointed either, although I would have preferred that the Set had less talking and more of Tiger's Unique golf shots. Still, It's a Good set of 3 discs to have in one's collection.",1491177600,,325,4.52542372881356
