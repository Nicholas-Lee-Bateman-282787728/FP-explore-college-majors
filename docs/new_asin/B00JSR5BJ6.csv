6389793,5,B00JSR5BJ6,"Great collection! If you are a fan of the series this is a must have! Quality packaging, great design and fun special features!

6389794,5,B00JSR5BJ6,"The show is great, and having them all in on box set with a few extras is wonderful. From the comic strip to the series is has been very good overall. Packaging is nice and the bonus CD has the title song and 7 others. I thought he 4th season wasn't as good as the others, but it was still better than most of the stuff on TV.",1404086400,10,326,3.8088235294117645
6389795,5,B00JSR5BJ6,"I wasn't sure what to think of this product when I saw it hit the Amazon shelves. It seemed to be coming out awfully close to the final episode's air date, and seemed surprisingly cheap for a complete series set ($55 = roughly $1/episode, + bonuses), so I was skeptical if this was a legit release or not. I am very happy to have been proven wrong!

First off, in terms of basic content, you already know the show. It's been around since 2005, and continues to provide be the go-to show for scathing political and social satire on culture clash and race relations (season 4 aside). All episodes are present in excellent picture and audio, and indeed seem to be uncensored (as stated on the box). Obviously, I haven't had time to watch through every episode to verify this, but that seems to be the case.

What really surprised me on this was the packaging. Each season is contained in sexy, foldout cardboard sleeves, like the kind that the special Thinpak editions of CDs used to come in, 3 discs to a season (except season 4, which is only 2 discs). Since the sleeves are all Thinpak sized, the whole set only takes up about two ""regular"" DVD cases worth of space on the shelf. Solid!

Special features include episode commentaries, some deleted scenes, short features, etc, etc, and a surprise bonus soundtrack CD as well!

This is an absolute must-have for Boondocks fans. For the curious onlookers, The Boondocks is not an easy show to pick up. It's crude and offensive, but backed with a biting and harsh satire. Yes, this is the show that delights in dropping the N-word en masse, both in culturally defensive and completely insensitive ways. Add in some racial stereotypes (black and white alike), a splash of gangsta culture, drench it in radical black power movement ideology, then roll all that up in a snarky BET burrito, and serve with hot anime-inspired action sauce. Think you can handle it? If so, GO FOR IT. This show is solid gold at what it does (barring the creator-not-involved season 4), and it is honestly one of the best cartoons to come out in the last decade because of it.

6389831,4,B00JSR5BJ6,"Really great series. One of my favorites.

But the second you get this in the mail, take the 4th season out of the case, and throw it in the garbage. Its bad. Its real bad. You can tell by the 2nd episode that its not the same as the other seasons. Its terrible. If you ever see the option to just buy the first 3 seasons get that instead. By the 2nd episode of the 4th season I was skipping forward in the episodes to see if it ever got good. It doesn't, it gets worse.

Maybe I'm overreacting but I'd rather watch the first season of The Nutshack over the 4th season of The Boondocks. Well maybe its not that bad but its pretty bad.

First 3 seasons are 5/5 amazing though, worth the buy.",1474329600,,690,4.0588235294117645

It offers a black perspective of black issues and American society in general - a welcome break from the white supremacist assumptions that underpin the ""default"", ""respectable"" perspective in most mainstream media and social commentary.

The style of animation is bad-ass. The stories are well written and paced and the characters are all hilarious in their own ways. Yes, it presents stereotypes, but it does them in a way that deliberately makes you THINK about them, and it while it pokes fun at the shortcomings in the African-American community, it does so from their perspective. As a white person, this series genuinely makes me think about what I can do as a white person to help fight racism.",1424736000,,759,4.883720930232558

6389885,5,B00JSR5BJ6,"Ive seen a lot of these episodes on Adult Swim and You Tube.  I bought this Box Set because there are episodes I cant find that I would like to see. When the show first aired, some of the guys that I worked with tried to get me to watch it, back then I couldn't relate to the show because it seemed to be geared towards a younger audience. Recently Ive started watching the show again and find the Uncle Ruckus character amusing and the Huey character interesting. Uncle Ruckus suffers from the same thing our modern Industrial society suffers from, an inability to accept self. Just as Ruckus cant accept that he is Black we cant accept that we a just one of the varied expressions of life compliments of this Biosphere we inhabit. When you examine Ruckuss reality you realize its delusional and dysfunctional, so too is this modified and synthetic reality weve created.  The thing I find interesting about Huey is his willingness to remove the layers to try and find answers. Unfortunately most of the time he only goes so far, realizing only part of the answer. An example is the Season 1 Christmas episode. Huey correctly realizes that Christmas is nothing more than the remnants of a Pagan Roman Festival yet he gets hung up arguing Jesus was Black. When I remove the layers from the Jesus character I find a person committed to Pure, Unconditional and Everlasting LOVE. A commitment so deep he is willing to die for it. I find the use of the N-word a bit over the top, Im sure its just the writers attempt to keep it real, staying true to the streets. I wouldnt be surprised if a hot-shot Producer hadnt done a study that found a correlation between the amount of times the word is used and the number of people watching the show. The episodes probably had an N-word minimum. I read a review on the show where the person was critical of it. The argument was, if a White person wrote a show with stereotypes of Blacks, people would be outraged. I don't consider this a show of stereotypes, I think of it as Satire. I believe the writers are saying, its time we take a hard look at what we are doing and how we are doing it. When I take a hard look I see a world out of balance. Anyone with any knowledge of Machinery, Cars or Human Anatomy knows that if any of them are out of balance they will not operate the way they were designed to, when the balance is severe enough they will shutdown.  When I think about the mental and physical state of most of the world, the extreme and erratic weather we are having and the fact that 700,000 people control 50% of the worlds wealth while the other 6+ Billion are trying to get as much of the remaining 50%. We are getting dangerously close to that edge.",1423958400,4,2702,4.378486055776892

Brilliant concept, brilliant voicings, and some brilliant guests too.  Very adult in it's language but a very clever bit of comedic social commentary. Well done Aaron Macgruder and co.",1412985600,,299,4.96
6389899,5,B00JSR5BJ6,"This series is pretty hilarious but BE WARNED:  it contains alot of stereotypes (of all races) and use of the N word, and I mean used alot.  Im ok with the content mostly because they don't single any race out to an extreme, alot of is used to point out the ridiculous attitudes some people have and how clownish some stereotypes are.  The writing is better than average for television and overall it just makes me laugh...alot.",1412294400,2,428,4.532467532467533

6389905,5,B00JSR5BJ6,"The funniest series ever on TV.  That's one man's opinion.  If you're highly sensitive towards racial issues, or don't get satire, you may be highly offended as these characters take on blacks, whites, and 'normal' society unmercifully.  No holes barred.  The most racist man ever to appear on TV is Uncle Ruckus - No Relation - a black man who spews more racial hatred than most KKK members - and makes it funny.  Watch a couple episodes on Toons TV or Netflix - and if you like them, this set of the entire 4 seasons is a real bargain.",1410220800,3,537,4.383838383838384
