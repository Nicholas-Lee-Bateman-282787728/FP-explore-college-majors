3809365,5,B001UV4X4W,"but I couldn't help but laugh at the insane humor on display here. I suppose I'm just an immature teenager at heart sometimes (and I love The Whitest Kids U Know, well, at least the first 2 seasons).

I don't know if I can recommend this film, because it's obviously not for everyone......in fact I don't think it's for anyone really, except for me and my friends. So if any of you are reading this.....oh what the hell, you're gonna buy it anyways.",1245974400,22,449,4.409638554216867
3809366,3,B001UV4X4W,"Miss March is a decent movie. Not everyone will enjoy it but it will be one of those movies that goes on demand on you watch it just to see how it it. The movie starts off with two little kids finding a playboy in a brothers box. From there off Tucker( Trevor Moore) spends his whole life off the playboy magazine.

  I am not going to say much about the movie except that it was not a Best Comedy award.",1244246400,,404,3.962962962962963
3809367,2,B001UV4X4W,"Miss March utilizes both lewd gags and random bursts of imbecilic humor, and this style of comedy will easily appeal to some and completely disgust others.  If you've jumped aboard the recent gross-out comedy bandwagon, characterized by short bouts of real humor sandwiched between squalidly immoral excesses, the first feature film from the creators of The Whitest Kids You Know might just be your cup of tea, though the sum of its parts can't maintain the quality of the popular sketch comedy show.

On Prom night, minutes before he's about to lose his virginity to longtime girlfriend Cindi (Raquel Alessi), Eugene (Cregger) falls down a flight of stairs and winds up in a coma.  Four years pass and the bewildered youth awakens to find that all of his friends and family have abandoned him, except for his maniacal, sex-obsessed buddy Tucker (Moore).  Together the mismatched duo embarks on a desperately deranged road trip to the Playboy Mansion to reunite the traumatized youth with Cindi, who is now Playmate of the Month.

Vulgar comedy only surpasses its simplicities when the characters involved are actually relatable or worthy of our sympathy.  The immature humor found throughout Miss March falls a little shorter than its true recycled nature due to the two main protagonists and their overly despicable presentations.  Neither straight man Eugene nor funny man Tucker succeed in overcoming their annoyingly expected stereotyped traits and every attempt at redemption falls on eyes blinded by indifference.

Perhaps what's most impressive about Miss March is the amount of questionable activities the creators manage to squeeze into an R-rated film. It's done in a comedic, unrealistic manner, but ""pushing the envelope"" isn't a phrase extreme enough to accurately describe some of the taboo endeavors. Sadly, the gratuitous female nudity expected from a film shot at the Playboy Mansion and replicating a full-blown Hugh Hefner party is minimal, forcing the obnoxious and insufficient buffoonery to be relied upon much too heavily.

Konrath.

Talon: I was shocked. And not by the immense nudity, violence, poop, or humor.

I was shocked because this was considered one of the worst movies ever made. What is wrong with people? I had a considerable amount of laughs. The cinematography was good. The writing was good. It wasn't too long and it had 6 million dollars to play with.

Hugh Hefner is in it!

C'mon!

Let this be an important message that professional critics suck and all of them should be wiped off the face of the planet.

I have seen dozens of BAD movies. Movies that are close to unwatchable.

ZAAT (1971)
HOWARD THE DUCK (1986)
ALONE IN THE DARK (2005)

Joe: JAWS 4: THE REVENGE (1987)

I still have flashbacks.

Talon: But even if they are terrible and they make you want to do every drug in the world to help relieve the brain pain... they can still be enjoyed. And shared. Think about it; a group of people put hundreds of hours of work and spent mucho dollars on something just for you to watch.

Grow up and stop whining about it.

Joe: All opinions are valid, and we all have things we don't like. But how much better would the world be if we celebrated what we don't like, rather than threw hate-pies at it?

Hating something doesn't make it bad.

If you don't find something funny, or if you find it offensive, that doesn't mean you should trash it. Our growing adoption of social media has made it increasingly easy for everyone to share their opinions. But just because you can criticize everything doesn't mean you should.

I believe artists should be celebrated, even if you don't like what they're doing. What have you created lately? And if you have created something, how much good will it bring the world if others heap scorn upon you and your creation?

MISS MARCH may not be for everyone. If it isn't for you, that doesn't make it bad.

Talon: It makes you bad.

Joe: Pretty much. I have zero tolerance for intolerant people.

Talon: You should maybe reread that sentence.

Joe: Shut up. I have no tolerance for you.

Talon: Here's some of the dialog my dad and I had while viewing. Try to imagine some of our phrases as catchy slogans:

""This is the best song ever made.""
""MPEG is the best rapper alive.""

""Best worst movie ever!""

""Wait, this bombed? Why?""
""People suck.""

""I wish Hugh Hefner was my dad.""
""Same.""

""I laughed out loud at least ten times. That's even more than I laughed at Old Yeller.""

""Potty humor. Drug humor. Sex humor. Nudity. It's like a Greatest Hits package for adolescent boys.""",1495497600,,2904,5.110403397027601

They set fire to a hotel and have crazed firefighters after them the whole time(Tuckers girlfriend is a fireman,they live by the code) They party with a wannabee rapper who somehow made it big.

3810317,2,B001UV4X4W,"Although I didn't think this movie was gonna be great in the first place, I was somewhat heartbroken by how disappointing this movie is.  Whitest Kids U'Know was a fine show and comedy troupe, and directors Trevor and Zach has a decent enough comedic talents, but it seems like they reached their limit in how capable they can pull off a feature-length film.  It's repulsive, the jokes were boring, and the characters antics get tiresome after way; the film seems more effective as a ten-minute sketch than anything else.

It did started off strong.  Not so much with the premise, which is about Eugene (Zach) who got into a four-year coma and found out by his bumbling friend Tucker (Trevor) that his girlfriend is a playboy bunny so they're on a road trip to get her back, but the wackiness that initially gave way.  The first 15 minutes were hilarious, ranging from the bizarre abstinence speech to how Eugene got out of the coma; they have good timing and delivery on those ideas.  As the plot goes on, however, the movie progressive got less funny.  The way the jokes set-up became predictable and clich, more emphasis is on shock humor, overused facial gags, I had the feeling the movie was becoming lazy.  None of the humor and tact mean anyone, and the characters don't bother to make themselves more interesting than their gags.  Trevor, the bumbling sexist apathetic buddy, got on my nerves when he goes through with the same clueless gag over and over again.

The directors just struggle to make a basic story work, and it felt padded despite the 95 minute run.  It feels less like an homage to screwball road trip films and more like a halfhearted attempt of a screwball road trip film.  There's plenty of skits in the Whitest Kids U'Know series that has more substance in a short time than ""Miss March""; for the most part, this is an old issue.",1275609600,,1857,4.628048780487805

'Miss March' is so stupid that you can't help but laugh at the over the top gross out gags that propel this stupid film through it's running time like a torpedo propelling through water.

The cast especially Cregger and Moore play two childhood friends, one who is a sex crazed kook and the other a reserved guy waiting for the right time to lose his virginity to his girlfriend of 2 1/2 years. After one of them comes out of a 4 year long coma(don't ask!), the two embark on a cross country road trip and extreme wackiness ensues!

The film is full of raunchy ridiculous high jinks and nudity and shouldn't even be worth looking at, but I must confess that I haven't laugh so hard in a while.

A long sketch but a great sketch.  This film is hysterically funny.  I rented it from Netflix and decided immediately I'd have to buy it.  It's full of surprises.  Nothing is sacred.  If the acting sucks the comedy is absolutely brilliant.

Make sure not to miss the supplements, they were insanely funny as well.

I was laughing while watching it, so it's hard to really hate a movie like this.

You know how it is- you think a movie absolutely stinks, but you keep watching it anyway because you find it funny?

You don't *want* to laugh because secretly you know it's bottom of the barrel comedy... but you continue watching despite that.  Yeah you get the point.  It's one of *those* kind of films.

The amount of vulgar scenes you will witness in Miss March is incredibly high. This is NOT a movie for kids- this is strictly humor intended for young adults.

A young man plans to have his first sexual experience with a girl a magical one, and on prom night, but while he's getting ready to head for her bedroom, he takes a wrong turn down the basement stairs, falling down, and a toolbox hits him on the head before the entire cabinet comes crashing down on top of him.  Talk about a rough night.

Four years later, he wakes up in the hospital room, and let me just say his friend (who totally reminds me of WWE wrestler Edge) is the main character in the film, and he's a complete moron.  No matter what he does, everything he does is wrong.  He's goofy, immature, and gross.  Hey, we all know people like that in real life, haha.  His friend however (the one who wakes up in the hospital) is the complete opposite of that- he's more respectable and treats women with dignity.

Anyway, we find out the girlfriend of the young man who awakes in the hospital has found a career as a model at the Playboy mansion, so the two friends take a ride to the west coast in search for his girlfriend.

THIS is when the story really gets going, and the two of them go on some amazing adventures while traveling around the country, usually really moronic adventures that involve making trouble with people they shouldn't be messing with.

Overall, a really funny film.  NOT necessarily a well made, thought-provoking, intelligent kind of humor, but good enough to create some laughs for 1 hour and 20 minutes.",1266019200,7,2084,4.470899470899471

I mean the previews had some honestly funny moments in them that made me laugh out loud but those usually mean that the best scenes of the film have been seen already and the rest is drek. I was pleasantly surprised. Don't get me wrong, this isn't LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, but it is an entertaining comedy.

Eugene Bell (Zach Cregger) and Cyndi Whitehall (Raquel Alessi) are two high school seniors who have strongly adopted the wait until your married vow of celibacy. They go to middle schools and preach this to younger kids (in the first of many hilarious moments). But the big night of prom is around the corner and Cyndi wants the two of them to show their love physically, insisting until Eugene gives in.

The night arrives and of course Eugene turns to his best friend Tucker Cleigh (Trevor Moore) for advice. Best friends forever, Tucker has become the class lout, attempting to bed any and every female in sight. This doesn't mean he succeeds, it just means he wants to. Who better to give Eugene advice, right?

They all arrive at the big party. Cyndi goes upstairs to get ready. Tucker begins to fuel Eugene's fire and calm his nerve with alcohol. And in a drunken stupor, Eugene heads to meet his destiny with Cyndi...only to take a wrong door and fall down the stairs, landing at the bottom and having a tool case land on his head, placing him in a coma for 4 years.

Four years later Tucker wakes Eugene using the same method, a huge smack to the head. Grateful to be awake at first, Eugene discovers life isn't that great for him at the moment. Between atrophied muscles, no bowel control, his parents forgetting about him in the hospital and apparently Tucker being the only person who cares, he then discovers that Cyndi is not a playmate, Miss March.

The two make plans to get Eugene back in shape and then head out to find Cyndi and discover what happened. Those plans are tossed into immediate gear when a problem between Tucker and his girlfriend (one of the funniest sight gags in the film) results in his having to leave town with her hot on his trail along with fire fighters across the country. Her brother is a fire fighter and according to Tucker, they're all crazy and side together.

The pair head out on their road trip and have one problem after another slow them down. Not since Steve Martin and John Candy hit the road in PLANES TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES has a duo had this many problems. The pair hitches a ride with an old high school chum named Horsedick.mpeg (Craig Robinson) who's become a celebrity in his own right, a huge rap star. The songs he offers on view here as well as accompanying videos may be raunchy but they are hilarious as well.

Hopping on board the party buss, Horsedick insists that Eugene lose his virginity on the way. It's a party bus and he wants nothing but partying going on. Enter one of the funniest moments seen in the trailer that still gets a laugh here, the result of which finds Tucker and Eugene tossed off the bus in the middle of the desert. Fortunately a pair of nympho lesbians picks the pair up asking them to drive while they make out in the back.

Then more trouble comes up. But eventually the boys make their way to the coast and to Tucker's Holy Grail, the Playboy mansion! Cyndi is supposed to be there at a big party and the duo now just need to find a way in. Can they do so? Will Eugene find out what went wrong between him and Cyndi? Will Tucker discover that the years he's spent studying the Playboy lifestyle in the pages of the magazine pay off or were they just a hoax?

The only way to see is to watch this DVD and get a chuckle in the process. The film falls into the category of crude humor films and if you walk in aware of this you'll find plenty to laugh at. If you found everything from ANIMAL HOUSE to ROAD TRIP funny then you'll love this one.

Movies like this are not so much about the acting as the humor involved. Sure these characters aren't believable but admit it, there was someone you knew somewhere alone the way just like Tucker. The guy who thought that every word found in Playboy was true. The guy who thought if he knew the likes and dislikes of women he'd have his way with them all.

While there are moments between the characters here that are goofy and laced in laughs, there are also moments where you truly see an affection between them. Not just the dynamic duo on the road but Cyndi and Eugene as well. And words of wisdom are also offered by none other than Hugh Hefner himself in a send up of his own empire and self description.

If you're looking for a good time, a laugh and not easily offended then you'll like this film. While this is juvenile humor, it's not for juveniles. Definitely not for the kids. So send them to bed, pop the DVD in and then try and stifle the laughter so you don't wake them up. It won't be an easy task.

When judging the star rating for this one I was on the verge of giving it 3 stars. The only reason to jump to 4 was that yes, I'd watch this one again. Will everyone else? I'm not sure. It depends on your sense of humor so judge for yourself. But it is worth watching at least once.",1252195200,,5189,4.337113402061855

Moore plays his best bud, and the pair go on a cross country trip to find Eugene's old girlfriend (Raquel Alessi), who has since become a Playboy centerfold.  There's plenty of gross out gags and naked flesh on display, but in the end, the film ends up playing out like an overlong sketch from the duo's show.

This guy is not believable at all. If you happen to see this movie and you read my review, you'll understand what I am talking about.

Besides terrible acting and bad character choices, this movie has only a couple laughs in it, and even they seemed forced. The only reason I finished this movie was because I paid $5.99 to get it on demand from Comcast and at least wanted to get my money's worth, even though it was still a complete waste of money.

Do yourself the favor and don't buy this movie. Rent it and you will see why. You will even thank every one that wrote a negative review about this movie which prevented you from buying it.

On the night he is to lose his virginity, straight-arrow high school student Eugene Bell (Zach Cregger) gets conked on the head, causing him to fall into a coma for four long years.  When he finally awakens, he discovers that his once-demure and squeaky-clean girlfriend (Raquel Alessi) has apparently dropped her abstinence-only policy in favor of a career as a Playboy centerfold model.  His best buddy, the goofy Tucker Cleigh (nicely played by Trevor Moore), decides to spring Eugene from the hospital where he's undergoing physical therapy and drive across country to the Playboy Mansion to help the recently awakened young man get a second chance with his girl.

""Miss March,"" co-written/directed by Cregger and Moore, is another one of those seemingly limitless sophomoric raunch-fests that have been flooding the cineplexes ever since ""Animal House"" hit the fan back in the late 1970s.  The jokes - which mainly center around poop and physical disabilities - range from the clever to the just-plain-stupid, with the ratio, unfortunately, weighted far more towards the latter than towards the former.  However, almost in spite of itself, the movie still manages to generate a few good-natured laughs from time to time.  And though he doesn't have much going for him in the acting department, Hugh Hefner does have a good time parodying himself in a cameo appearance late in the movie.",1250553600,,1398,5.13215859030837
3810408,1,B001UV4X4W,"I've seen many a bad movie over the years, but this one is close to the top (or rather, the bottom) of the list. I'd been looking for a silly but well-done R-Rated comedy. But you won't find it here. Head-cracking (literally) slapstick without the choreographed comedy of Laurel and Hardy; a script that's full of amateurish sexual and scatalogical obscenity that made it hard even for me to watch; and...well, I don't ask for a well-crafted ""plot"" or artistry if a film offers at least a good laugh or titillating entertainment. But--I'm sorry--""Miss March"" offers neither. The ""jokes"" would appeal only to immature, dysfunctional adolescents (like the sub-hero) who need counseling. The ""R-Rated"" scenes are mostly disgusting rather than sexy. At the end, a Hefneresque character (or was it the real ""Hef,"" in a cameo appearance? I don't know) advises the loser-friend on how to get what he wants from a woman. Great stuff, eh? Since the ""film"" is rated ""R"" and is therefore not suitable for viewers under 18, I strongly recommend that responsible parents show it to their teenaged sons (and daughters), see where the boys laugh and hit PAUSE to take time to discuss what they think is so funny--and require a coherent answer before hitting the PLAY button to continue again. It might be a ""teachable moment.""",1249257600,3,1311,4.90990990990991
3810409,1,B001UV4X4W,"At the local red box the other night i rented ""Miss March"" for a dollar. Unfortunately i didn't care too much for it. It feels like a whole unfunny skit of ""The Whitest kids you know"". It does offer some original laughs but it's lousy plot kicks in and you spend 90 minutes watching characters you really don't care for. In the end, if you must watch a movie I recommend this. But for renting only. I'm so happy I rented this and didn't buy it. P.S. I'm a huge ""whitest kids you know"" fan! Hopefully there next film won't be as dumb.",1248998400,7,533,4.184466019417476
3810410,2,B001UV4X4W,"I'm struggling to find one redeeming quality about this movie...I really am.  Sure I chuckled a few times, but in the end I was left scratching my head and asking, ""Did I really just sit through that?""  The lead characters Eugene (Zach Cregger) and Tucker (Trevor Moore) were over the top at times and obnoxiously whiney at others.  How many times can two guys scream like girls?

The only part that was decent was the cameo Hefner gave.  As another poster stated he gave a good performance (or just acted as himself) and delivers a simple explanation about how to treat women.

I guess with these movies it's hit or miss and this one just missed for me.  In the end I decided to give it two stars for the few laughs I did manage to let out and for Hef.  Would I watch it again?  Never.  Am I mad I watched it once? Na.",1248912000,3,819,4.225806451612903

3810412,2,B001UV4X4W,"I really cannot find good reason to describe the plot in any detail, but sufficed to say two guys make a venture for the Playboy mansion in hopes of reacquainting with a lost love centerfold. In the interim we get treated to plenty of diarrhea, old sight gags, boring writing, unfunny jokes, and lengthy diatribe that would have been funny ten years ago. I can laugh at good fire service jokes, but the whole psychotic, sexless firemen gag running throughout the film was lame - and it would be nice if one film would actually show how the pumpers really work (sans the Con Air, Evolution, Miss March incorrectness)

The Blu pic is actually decent through most of the film, though delving into the B grade quality stock through several indoor sequences. Nothing to test the visuals as the cross country footage entails all of 30 seconds so that leaves the sound and supplements. The sound is uneventful and the supplements cater to the Whitest Kids U Know crowd.

The Viral Videos offering is a staged audition sequence that does not entertain much, but as stated the fans that have been renting the TV series are asking about this. The Down & Dirty uncensored (or edited option) allowed Craig Robinson (Pineapple Express, Zack & Miri, etc.) to have more of the only fun in the movie with his rapping video clip.

I have to admit Hugh Hefner has a natural screen presence and his 60 second sequence was actually appropriate - it appears he does not have to act, it just comes naturally, as does his explanation about how to treat women; skip the movie and just watch that one part.

The unrated is only 3:10 minutes longer and had nothing special to offer over the rated. I did verify they dubbed over the school speech in both versions, so I am curious what she was actually saying that they had to change it. Skipper.",1248307200,11,1819,4.587692307692308
