4522533,3,B0051GOB2G,I was really disappointed in this series. There were great actors but the story never seemed to really get going. I found it disjointed and kept waiting for it to settle on a storyline. I do like Jason Ritter and Blair Underwood but they can only act with what they are given.,1484870400,,276,4.326923076923077
4522534,1,B0051GOB2G,"Returned this series as it was too hard to keep-up with and jumped around from past to present all the time to much.  Even, to the future.",1484438400,,138,4.111111111111111

4522537,5,B0051GOB2G,Very Interesting,1478908800,,16,7.5
4522538,4,B0051GOB2G,"To keep in mind right off the bat ---  The ""complete series"" [sic] is in fact the first year of some 22 episodes and is yet ==another== of those ""projected"" series for further seasons but it just didn't happen! NBC cancelled it. On the other hand, for eleven dollars and change [at this writing] and to be entertained for over 15 hours isn't a bad deal. Now, and this is something else to keep in mind, while the show had hopes of being continued, and which it was not, there is at least, how can I phrase this, a ==partial== resolution to the 22 episode action although it was clearly in anticipation of continuing the story line for a second season and, alas, we get stiffed on that one as episode 22 is the end of the line! But again, the ride wasn't bad for what I paid for the =5= discs [only available in DVD, =not= Blu Ray], but the show had potential! I'll also say this, the last 5 episodes on disk #5, at least IMO, was riveting and I don't use that word lightly. When you see the last scene, you'll find yourself saying, ""a continuation would have been great"" because the actors were very good and the tension is decent to hold your interest.

Turns out, there are various series like this and by that I mean that SciFi stuff is mixed with the drama but if the writing is decent, you go along with it  Hey, think of it this way, you say to the writers that you are willing to, shall we say, suspend reality [especially in those shows with SciFi or fantasy stuff mixed into the drama] and your reason is simple, viz., you'll suspend reality in order to be entertained! The series was criticized by some reviews I read elsewhere where [and I won't give anything away so don't worry] they said, and permit me to get a bit cryptic here,  the ""opposition"" is unmasked ""as early as episode 2"" but my own reaction in having watched the whole thing was ""so what?"" and I still enjoyed it. Indeed, I think a continuation would have been great and that last episode does set it up for an obvious continuation ==but== I've had that happen before as was the case with the ""Revolution"" series which was not renewed or another interesting one and again billed as a ""complete series"" but after season 2, that was it, ""Last Resort."" although there was, again, at least a partial resolution of the season's action but clearly set up to continue for a 3rd season but which was not picked up. Right now, I'm into ""The 100"" and I'm awaiting Season 4.

Anyway. over 15 hours of entertainment with bonus stuff and a very reasonable price [$11.43 at this writing] for the 22 episodes and bonus material.  The series ran from 2010 into 2011 for those 22 episodes and that was it. It ==is== a let-down as to ""what happens next"" but, as I say, there is a ==partial== resolution at least to the pressing drama that unfolds before going on for a story continuation but which never happened but you're not left totally high and dry. I just remembered as I type this, I had enjoyed ""V""  and once again, no 'final' resolution because it wasn't renewed but of that which I saw, hey, it was entertaining and at least some season resolution but no 'major' resolution of ""V"" and ditto for ""The Event"" in the absence of a =total= resolution  In essence, you get some but not all. Too bad because the potential for ""The Event"" was there but NBC pulled the plug and no doubt this is why the price is so low. Enjoy.

4522545,5,B0051GOB2G,I watched this series when it aired on Tv years ago. I do not understand why they did not renew for another season. It is one of the best shows made. Each episode was fantastic to the point you couldn't wait to watch the next one.,1466553600,,230,4.021739130434782
4522546,3,B0051GOB2G,"Long and drawn out best describes this TV mini series.
I had high hopes for it because it's cast are well respected actors/actresses but sadly it was not meant to be.
Synopsis : An alien craft crashes in Alaska during World War Two.
Some of the aliens that look human escape and blend into society taking up various lives.
The show becomes convoluted because it keeps jumping back in forth in time making it confusing to follow in addition to very little action in it.
Bottom line, pas on it unless you have nothing else to watch.",1464393600,,530,4.474226804123711

4522562,2,B0051GOB2G,"Watched a few shows, but after numerous unnecessary homocides, decided it is not worth the effort to watch. May be an Australian story, because the actors do not show much emotion or body lsnguage and that is one of their movies' weaknesses.",1456617600,,241,4.761904761904762
4522563,2,B0051GOB2G,"Watched two out of the five disks. Horrible acting, very painful to watch. Way too many improbabilities to be a viable story unless you're six years old.

Note to all, this is only season 1 with bonus material and there was no season 2 because the show was cancelled.  The Event: The Complete Series ... is incomplete because there was no money to complete it.  This is so wrong to title it the complete series when only one series was produced.  Do not be duped!
Just watched season 1 of the series ""The Event"" from start to finish.  The series ""The Event"" was fantastic but this is not.  If you are looking for season 2, it is not in this set.  If you are looking for answers, you will not get them here.
Go get season 1 on Amazon, for free if you have a prime subscription and forego this misleading title.  I think there should be a law against this and Amazon should do a better job policing of its titles.",1407801600,4,856,4.234567901234568

4522699,5,B0051GOB2G,"****SPOILER ALERT!!!****

I have this habit of finding new series based on reviews on Amazon.  This is one of the gems I found on here, and I can not even begin to tell you how amazing this show is, and how glad I am that I found it!!!

It starts off with a young couple that gets caught in the middle of a government conspiracy involving a UFO that crashed in 1947  in Alaska with ""aliens"" in it, quite a few of which got away and are considered ""sleepers"".  These ""sleepers"" are aliens from that ship that have integrated themselves into modern day society.  Their DNA is less than 1% different from regular humans, and look, talk, and act almost exactly identical to us. Some have even made it as far as the White House.

As the story unravels, you learn more of how long they have been alive, and even on planet earth. They age extremely slowly, and are extremely smart and technologically advanced.  You become to get attached to the ""aliens"" and find yourself torn between who to ""root"" for quite frequently.

Never before have I seen a show that had me on the edge of my seat, biting my nails (which I have never done!), and pushing play on my DVD player as fast as I can, and not being able to sleep because I was thinking about what was going to happen.  Yes, it is that good.  I have also recently got several of my friends addicted to it, and they all have the same opinion of it as I do.  If you get this, you won't be disappointed!!!

4522700,5,B0051GOB2G,This series was very good as far as it went. The ending was different but still left us wondering what would happen now that the other planet was in orbit around the earth. Just another case of the network idiot leaders not letting the series finish to its inevitable conclusion or a possible ending that would be unexpected.,1388361600,,325,4.620689655172414
4522701,3,B0051GOB2G,"It's hard to write a review about a show like this one. At the beginning of the series there appear to be two main storylines, though these converge and reorganize later as the characters interact. The more grown-up political storyline with the president and Sophia is full of great mature actors while the Sean and Layla storyline really tends to be groanworthy. With better actors, a few better writers, and a few decisions made differently this probably could have been a great show. It can be very enjoyable for people who like television and don't mind overlooking flaws. Because you will have to do that constantly. The Sophia storyline in particular will appeal to people who like a good character-driven suspenseful story. Sophia's character is one of the best I've seen on television. I think without Laura Innes the show wouldn't have been worth watching, though Blair Underwood's incompetent president character is pretty compelling himself. Zeljko Ivanek's NSA director seems like a drone at first but is revealed to be a complex and thoughtful character -- one of the show's best.

I'm starting to ramble, so I'll wrap this up by saying this is a good show for people who:
1) don't mind very obvious imperfection
2) enjoy scifi, mystery, thrillers, character-driven stories
3) don't mind shows that get canceled after one season and are left with a cruel cliffhanger",1385942400,,1379,4.995652173913044
4522702,5,B0051GOB2G,"This is yet another show that makes me hate the networks so much.  They always cancel the best shows, especially when they are science fiction.  I don't agree with the belief stated by the creative staff that the early episodes were hard to follow, but either way, that was changed and the show maintained it's action and intrigue.  The cast was exceptional and the concept, while not the most original, was very well crafted.  And the season, and unfortunately series, finale cliffhanger was perfect.",1385596800,2,501,4.928571428571429
4522703,4,B0051GOB2G,"I just finished watching this series and I will say it was quite enjoyable.

Without giving away too much of the show's plot, I will say the characters themselves could have been written a little better, I got a 2 dimensional feel for each character.  In my opinion, there was not enough background on each of the characters (except for the brief flashback or 2, in the first couple of episodes), to explain how they got to where they were in the present, with the exception of the lead character Sean, played by Jason Ritter.  The other characters, I felt could have been more developed, but maybe that would have come had the series been allowed to continue.

That being said, I think this would have been better as a mini-series.  Although there was a cliff hanger in the final episode, I felt that the first season's story line was completed, and a new story line (based on a bit of vague information given in the final episodes of season 1) would have had to be developed for the second season.

I would recommend this series, it is entertaining, and you can't beat the price.",1385078400,4,1081,4.517948717948718

I almost gave up but then decided to hang in there and see it through a second episode and was I glad I did. I really loved the show. The writing and plot are quite unique - very imaginative. The acting by most of the actors was very good - the only weak link (and boy, she was super weak) is Sean's girlfriend Leila. If there was any flaw in the show, it was her.  I love ""the President"" - he is quite a hunk!  :)

I was looking forward to a second season and figured Amazon would have it - nope. I do hope the producers get their head on straight and push for a second series, at least to bring an end to it. But the possibilities of where the show can go are endless.

If you were put off by the first episode as I was - go back and view it again. Believe me, it's worth it - a very exciting and fun show.",1381881600,,894,3.8688524590163933

4522756,3,B0051GOB2G,"The Event starts off with a bang. Literally. We begin with the integral characters of the story, Sean Walker (Jason Ritter) hijacking a plane, trying to find out why his girlfriend Leila Buchanan (Sarah Roemer) has gone missing during their romantic cruise. This leads to unbelievable and unimaginable revelations...like the conspiracy of the 66 mysterious captives held in an off the grid and classified Alaskan compound since the 1940s and the plot to kill the president of the US. And it's almost all done in flashbacks.

Like many, back when this series was on TV, I watched and quickly lost interest by the middle part of the season. When it was put into DVD format, I checked it out and remembered all the little reasons I lost interest. I love high-concept, fast-paced and overly complicated series (a la Flashforward 24, Lost, etc) that asks the viewers to do more than just sit back and mindlessly enjoy, and quickly forget, what they just watched. However, I don't enjoy watching TV shows that continually ask you to believe in plot lines that don't make any sense at all or to watch characters do stupid things that don't make any sense at all. It gets so frustrating and tedious.

The problem with The Event is that the writers boxed themselves into corners with the plot, which had more holes than a sieve and became more complicated than was needed. While there is a lot of action and things move along, it felt static. It lost its excitement and tried too hard every week to outdo the previous episode. The coherency and general believability is lost by the middle, as revelations become more outlandish and the big 'ta-das' that had me go 'huh?' rather than 'wow'. After awhile, I didn't care and all the revelations felt empty, confusing or nonsensical. The narrative, while daring, gets annoying. The only thing really elevates this particular series is the performances by the entire cast, both the main and secondary actors. The cast was expansive, diverse and full of heavy-hitting and established names like Blair Underwood, Laura Innes, Bill Smitrovich and Zeljko Ivanek but it wasn't enough to make something out of nothing. Everything else, left to be desired. Good for a one time look-see but won't ever have a spot on my DVD library.",1351555200,,2260,4.837209302325581

***Spoiler Alert***
The US.  Destination of the Universe. Aliens who don't age much prefer to live in the US than any other country and don't even mention any other planet.
Destroying a monument- a war crime and a good reason to kill a few hundred people when you learn that they're defenceless. This will mark you as a moral person.
I will always find you (sob)- even though he was the one to walk away and found her only by coincidence.
If people have been trying to kill you and you find yourself safe, why not assert your right to go for a walk outside the safe zone and have a whiny tantrum when you find out someone is keeping guard over you. If he is a nicely dressed, smiling man, scream at him that you don't feel safe. Later, kill him.
Police stations are easy to break out of. Go into the bathroom and smash the window, no one has ever tried that before.
Gunshot wounds heal in hours and do not significantly inhibit movement. The next day you will have a limp but don't worry, it will only be intermittent.
A group of aliens wants to infect humans with a deadly virus.  Of all the deadly viruses out there they chose the Spanish Flu-worse in some unspecified way.  They keep saying that it killed 25% of earth's population in 1918.  Yeah. When food was scarce, people were poor, hygiene was basic and ANTIBIOTICS did not exist.  Hmm. Wonder if that makes a difference?
A star goes supernova over a few decades.  It was completely unexpected.
A person with the flu should not be allowed to sleep or they might die.
A pretty girl can do anything if she whinges loudly enough. The heroine was so irritating that I just kept hoping someone was going to hit her.
If ever a hotel loses your details you should have a tantrum and run away.  This will allay suspicion since the government is clearly after you.
Airline staff don't need to undergo any screening or customs. No one ever suspects them.
When your husband is ventilated in ICU you should use your cell phone right beside the bed. The staff have probably already told you that doing so will affect his equipment but what the hey!  Your call is more important.
And that's even before we get to the planet-sized plot hole in the last 2 minutes. They have to decimate the earth' s population because they need to make room for their own people.  They arrive on their own planet, seemingly negating the need for genocide. 2.5 billion extra guests for dinner?  No problem when you have... the X-Panda Planet! $29.95, plus Portal Shipping!

OK, so I have a thing for hotties that can kick serious ""A"" while keeping their makeup intact!

First and foremost, thanks to NBC for providing a serial program that actually offered some closure.

Serial type programs need to pick up and hold an audience quickly. Many considered ""The Event"" to be an NBC ""bubble"" show re: to getting picked for a 2nd season.  Where this show was slightly different from many serial programs that offer ""the big conclusion"" at the end of the season, ""The Event"" gave out pieces of the mystery throughout the year.  With that said, IMHO, the show actually got stronger as the series progressed and for a first year program the big-3 networks generally like to see an audience right out of the gate where the cable and secondary channels are more inclined to risk subsequent seasons to allow a program to build an audience.

""The Event"" has many of the facets that make for good TV: Political Intrigue, Compelling Characters (both good and bad), Action, Sexual Overtones and did I mention Taylor Cole, Taylor Cole and Taylor Cole?

Seriously, there were very few US programs axed in 2011 that caused even a minor mist up.  ""The Event"" on the strength of a strong second half of the season was one!

The fact that ""The Event"" is still holding its price steadily in the +-$30 range is a sure sign of it's after market popularity, as there are many recent cancellation that are for sale on Amazon for less the $8 (including 2-day delivery for Prime Members).

As to the story, it is a good premise and holds your interest; at least mine.  One of the problems may have been all of the character backstories were handled in flashbacks.  So, some may have found it a little confusing.  Hence, the low ratings that caused the cancellation.

Now, there is scuttlebutt that the series is to be concluded on the SyFy channel as a mini-series.  If that remains true, then wait until the actual series IS complete before buying.

Far too often in sci-fi melodramas, you're presented with the inevitable ""good guys"" and the equally inevitable ""bad guys"".  Not so in THE EVENT.  The moral ambiguity -- where you're forced (like it or not) to acknowledge both sides of the issue -- makes for a trenchant, thought-provoking TV series, unlike anything else you're likely to encounter.

Excellent, probing characterizations, brilliant dialogue, unmitigating suspense, plot twists galore and a believable -- you'll have no difficulty suspending your credulity -- story line that continually keeps you on the edge of your seat, one episode after another.

4522790,5,B0051GOB2G,"I am deeply saddened that NBC won't bring The Event back for a second season! I found this series to be fresh, exciting, though-provoking, and very creative. Additionally, it's wonderful to see convincing acting on a television drama - the cast worked well together, the dialogue was inventive, and the pace of the show kept me a bit breathless in a few episodes! With all of the horrible ""junk"" that passes for TV viewing these days, it was great to find a very well-done, well-scripted, well-acted show that provides the viewer with an intense story line, impressive visuals and effects, and a sense of anticipation and adventure. Highly recommended - I'm hoping beyond hope that NBC will consider bringing the show back for a 2nd season!",1322265600,,740,4.880952380952381
4522791,3,B0051GOB2G,"SPOILERS

This premise is just tired right now.  I guess they figured since V wasn't around anymore (is it?) that they'd pick up where it left off.  The only reason I kept watching it was because I knew there were a limited number of episodes and I wanted to see if they made a full story out of it.
My biggest gripe with this show, aside from the tired premise, was that the writers seemed to be making it up episode by episode.  That's fine for a sit com but when you're trying to tell a story that has a massive amount of background and these things all tie in together it can get a bit wonky.
Characters were killed off and replaced, the theme of telling the story outside of chronological order seemed to abruptly stop in one episode, leaving a couple of things left out (how did Jason Ritter get on the plane that he hijacked?  How did he know that it was her dad that was flying it?  I may have missed it, but I'm not going to insult anyone's intelligence by saying that it would have been told later on).
The show crumbled into bad sci-fi/espionage by about the end.  Poisoning of the president and secret antidotes, etc.
I will say I was extremely impressed with the acting of the vice president.  I feel he did an exceptional job.  In fact I don't have a problem with any of the acting, it's the writing that ruined this show in my opinion.",1321315200,2,1350,4.262745098039216
4522792,3,B0051GOB2G,"After the first three or four episodes, I was ready to give up on The Event. I was sick of the flashbacks, and the predictability of scenes involving the young couple. What kept me interested were the White House scenes (Sorry, trying to stay spoiler free). I thought the acting there was top-notch. As I watched more episodes and the overall story began to come together (flashback-free), I began to really enjoy the show and root for many of the characters: Agent Lee, and the head of Intelligence (forgot his title) were a couple of my favorites.......And then it was over. The Event often alluded to during the show was never actually shown. Not a problem for season 1, but I really would've liked to have seen a season 2. I hear that won't happen.

4522794,5,B0051GOB2G,"For those who've seen many of the other hit shows (I hate to mention it but Lost being one of them...)will be getting a fresh new concept in that this show is as contemporary as things can get...I myself am very intrigued in the way the underlying plot ties into real-world conspiracy and extraterrestrial questions. From the Pilot to every episode released each week the suspense and edge-of-your-seat tension continues to have you glued to the television set waiting for more to be answered. The continuity of the plot is masterful in what I can only describe is something like Christopher Nolan's movie Inception or how the movie Vantage Point cleverly sequenced each cut to finally reveal the truth. The flashbacks and snippets of each character are revealed more and more through brief yet significant cuts. The cast and acting is superb in my opinion. For those who go in wanting to see a more ""Lost"" like plot should stray away as this is a totally different genre. Too many viewers complain that the cuts are confusing and that they don't reveal enough but this show wouldn't be as original and intriguing if every flashback gave you 100% of what each character was about. Each flashback lasts about a minute or so and does just enough to provide you with another small piece of what The Event is all about without being so info-packed to confuse even the most close-minded viewers. Whats the point of watching the show if the creator gave you the beginning, middle, and end all at once? Don't just take my word for it, go and watch it yourself and see how each episode takes you on a thrill-ride that you wish will never end. I give The Event a 5 out of 5 so far...the best Sci-Fi/Conspiracy Theory show out today! Sadly the show has been cancelled by NBC and there are only RUMORS that it maybe picked up by other cable networks one being SyFy but Nick Wauters the creator of the show has already moved on to Vampire Diaries.  Those who are truly faithful will want to pick this up, there is even a blog on [...] where Wauters actually gives viewers more of the story.  For those who are still on the edge of wanting to spend around $30 bucks for the Complete Series of this show I suggest you check it out on hulu.com  Guaranteed you will NOT be disappointed.

Whoa.  How come I didn't hear about these guys when the show was going strong!  Purchased the set and after the last espisode my family was on the edge of their seats asking for season 2!

Yeah, I nearly had a riot on my hands when I told them it was canceled.  One of my kids asked me why all the great shows were being canceled after the first season.  The Dresden Files was another we were aching for a second season.

There are so many plots and subplots in ""The Event"" which haven't been resolved.  I hear stories that another may come in and take over it's production.  Sci Fi, Netflix, other's have been mentioned.  But nobody has confirmed.

Hopefully we won't be left here waiting for ""The Event"" Second season.  It's definitely a show that has much more to offer.",1316822400,80,898,4.375757575757576

However, NBC canceled this TV Show so it is incomplete with no ENDING. The title of this product is misleading because it says the COMPLETE SERIES, but in order to be a complete series it needs to have an ending. Do no waste your money on this, unless you want it for any special features? I myself downloaded it and it's NBC own fault for being greedy and thinking only of their pockets. At least with some TV Networks when they cancel a TV show at least they make sure it has an ending.",1315526400,57,655,4.0852713178294575
4522812,4,B0051GOB2G,"I watched most of this series on tv then got the dvd to rewatch it and catch up on the pieces I missed.

It's an excellent series, suspense and sci fi mixed well together in a tale that spans the globe and the years. And if it has one strength to shine above all the others for me, its the characterizations. The show goes to great lengths to show the mighty falling at every step of the way. The president, young and idealistic, slowly being broken down and turned into a paranoid and desperate man who will do anything to protect his country. The leader of the aliens, a woman who starts off near saintly, torn apart by events including the death of her son and the unexpected approaching destruction of her race, turning into a mass murderer. Yet even as it brings the mighty down it raises the humble, with an assassin being slowly transformed into a hero, a paranoic head of security being shown as paranoid for a reason and even learning to trust. The acting is superb.

There are however two weaknesses for me. The first is the unecessary way the plot jumps through time periods. I don't mind the odd flash back, but at the beginning the show is all flashbacks, and I found myself constantly being jerked out of my comfort zone as I tried to work out where and when I was. It interrupts the flow of the story.

The second are some strange plot hole issues. (Warning some spoilers ahead). First the pilot of the plane. Since any plane and any pilot would do why would the bad guys kidnap the daughter's of an alien on Earth to do it, and in so doing create a mess for themselves? It seems contrived and unecessarily complicated, though of course if it hadn't happened, the story's main character and plot couldn't happen.

There is also the issue of the defenders of humanity, who it turns the initial bad guy is one of. I don't have a problem with a secret underground resistence opposing an alien threat, that's fine. I do have a problem with them fighting an alien race with uber technology, with mystic knowledge, ancient scrolls and moving pieces of stone representing people(?) on a strange stone tablet of future events. Its just wrong.

And then there's the major plot hole. When the alien's go mad and start planning the death of humanity, its all so that apparently the Earth will have room for their two and a half billion people. A strange reason but still a reason. Then right at the end (Major spoiler), they bring their entire world across and set it up somewhere out there in Earth's orbit. If you can do that and your only danger to your world was that the old star was going supernova, then why do you need the extra room? It sort of makes everything that has gone before, completely redundant.

Still, other then those issues, this is an excellent show. Taught, tense and a walk into the unknown, exactly as it should be, and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes a good alien romp, a thriller and a mystery.

Its a pity that there will be no second season.

Cheers.",1315526400,61,2995,4.452554744525547
4522813,4,B0051GOB2G,I love this show but it needs to available on Blu Ray. The show was shown in HD on NBC so there is no excuse for not releasing it on Blu Ray HD. Why do they keep taking these steps back? Is the industry reverting to all DVD format? My 4 stars are for the show itself not releasing it on blu ray I give the publisher/distributors 0 stars.,1314576000,,337,3.898550724637681
4522814,4,B0051GOB2G,"The Event has plenty of flaws. It has a twisty plot that often abandons believability, and the characters' personalities often bend or flip to fit the constantly changing story. The lack of proper character development was also disappointing; top class sci-fi dramas like Heroes or Battlestar Galactica made up for sometimes nonsensical plot lines with strong character interaction and backstory, but The Event is primarily plot-driven and the characters were never fully fleshed out by the end of the series.

4522816,2,B0051GOB2G,"The Event was annoying. Everytime you thought it was about to go somewhere it didn't. False happenings that seemed like were big deals were actually not important. The reason I started watching The Event from the start was it was so shrouded in mystery that it actually looked interesting. First of all, there's Sean Walker, who's girlfriend gets kidnapped and he has to save her. That only lasted five episodes. Hal Holbrook plays this evil guy named Dempsey who WAS NEVER EXPLAINED. And there's Blake Sterling and the president. At the beginning of the show, Blake was a bad guy, and then he just turns into a good guy? This show makes absoulutely no sense. And yet, it had so much potential. A story about aliens that look like humans living among us secretely trying to kill us is such an awesome idea, but it just doesn't go anywhere. As for the actual Event, not expalined. A one-sentence teaser about it is given in the last episode. The Event ended with a shocker, but also a MAJOR cliffhanger. The way it slowly trickles out information makes this show not worth watching.",1312934400,6,1081,4.664921465968586

To bad America has no patients for television. There's so much instant gratification in our society that we want a season to start and end in just a few hours. We're just not willing to wait and watch a plan unfold. The final episode of this show was nothing short of spectacular. I was really looking foward to season 2 but that won't happen now. To many sci-fi ""fans"" have turned into critics. I wonder if there is anything they like and now they have crushed nearly all science fiction from American television.",1311638400,5,742,4.338129496402877
4522818,3,B0051GOB2G,"This show went from being brilliant to unwatchable in just one season which is quite unusual. Usually it takes a number of seasons for this to occur with a series, like it did with ""24"".

The plot is this: people from another planet crashed here years ago.  They look like us but they do not age much plus they are vastly ahead scientifically. Some of them were caught and imprisoned and others were blended into society over the decades, often in positions of power within the government. The leader of this group is a middle aged woman named Sophia. She has been in prison.  Her two sons have been free on the outside.  Simon is inside the government in a high level law enforcement job.  Thomas is a roving agent, who steps in when needed to keep things on course, like giving us the atomic bomb during World War 2.  Over the years Thomas has changed, becoming more militant and wanting to free his people.

Added to this are a whole bunch of other characters with Jason Ritter in the hero role as the boyfriend of one of these aliens.  Except she doesn't know she is an alien because her father was one and he had children with a non-alien. Ritter is supposedly the one who will save the planet and he finds a rogue federal agent to assist him. We also meet the President and all of his advisers and watch them try to deal with this crisis.

I think where this show went wrong was that it wrote the most interesting character out of the show.  This was Thomas, Sophia's son.  He was a fascinating character and although he was initially a villain, you came to see him as seriously conflicted. Jason Ritter should have been the most interesting character but his is a one note performance which gets tiresome.  He reminded me of the Jack Bauer role in ""24"" where we watch him try to save the world week after week in a dogged, tireless, one dimensional style.

When I heard this had been cancelled, I thought the right decision was made.  The creators had half a good season but lost it on the back half.  I certainly would not have watched season two.
