I really  wanted it for the  cartoon called  ""Old Glory""
because I remembered it from the time I was a child  and  always loved it.",1365292800,,194,3.9210526315789473
7828655,4,6302593395,"Very appropriate to have Egghead on the cover, because he's the only popular (well, that's kinda stretching it, now isn't it?) character on here.

1. Cinderella Meets Fella (Egghead)
2. Hamateur Night (Egghead)
3. Thugs With Dirty Mugs
4. Cross-Country Detours
5. Dangerous Dan McFoo (Egghead)
6. The Bear's Tale

7828656,3,6302593395,"Released in 1991, this MGM/UA compilation of Tex Avery's Warner Brothers insanity should have been a slam dunk. Unfortunately, ""The Golden Age of Looney Tunes"" combines Avery gems such as ""Thugs With Dirty Mugs"" (1939) and ""Cross Country Detours"" (1940) with lesser efforts like ""The Crackpot Quail"" (1941). Since the out-of-print video includes seven cartoons, you're not exactly getting value for money. Making matters worse, Warner has consistently shortchanged Avery in its ""Golden Collection"" DVD sets. Animation aficionados deserve a more representative selection of Tex's early brilliance.",1222819200,5,596,5.862068965517241
