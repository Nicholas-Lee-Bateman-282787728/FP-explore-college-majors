8030690,5,B0002Q9VSE,"Despite being dated, these films are Hollywood musical film-making at its best.  Judy Garland could almost carry a movie by herself, with her incredible, legendary voice and dancing skills.  Add choreography by that master of movie moves, Busby Berkeley, and Gene Kelly as a costar, and this film were never become too dated to enjoy.

""Summertime"" is of course fluff too, but the music alone makes it worth watching, and again - nobody made a musical quite like MGM in its heyday.  Watch for the uncredited cameo at the end by Judy's daughter, Liza Minnelli.",1476576000,,559,4.852631578947369
