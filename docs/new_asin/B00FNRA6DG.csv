8617339,5,B00FNRA6DG,Ridiculously campy made for TV movie from 1980. Ted Danson and Christopher Lee star in a James Bond spoof about an evil genius with a shrink ray and the computer programmer who is drafted to stop him. This movie was made where I lived in 1980 and Ted Danson actually spent time in my classroom telling us about how movies are made. He even rode my BMX bike on the playground during recess. He was genuinely nice to all of the kids who were so interested in the movie being made. I've looked for this movie for years and was ecstatic to find it for sale!,1441152000,4,553,4.226415094339623
8617340,5,B00FNRA6DG,"I've waited for a dvd release of this title for years!  If you're a James Bond fan and don't mind a lighter and fun take on the spy genre then you'll love this film.  Ted Danson in a pre Cheers roll stars as a government computer tech who is recruited after the government's master computer is stolen by super villain Christopher Lee.
Highly Recommended!",1384214400,6,354,4.515625
