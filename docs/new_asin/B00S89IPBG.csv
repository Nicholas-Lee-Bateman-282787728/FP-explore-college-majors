6964416,5,B00S89IPBG,"Laugh out loud funny sketch show mixed with bits of her live comedy. Amy Schumer is outrageous, naughty and hilarious. 3 DVD disc set contains 20 episodes and some great behind the scenes bonus footage and extras. Witty,immature and sometimes shocking. Awesome DVD set.",1423872000,15,269,5.136363636363637
6964417,5,B00S89IPBG,"This show is so funny. The first season is great and the second season blows it away. Amy Schumer is one of my favorite comics. I've never cried while laughing so much while watching a show.
Also, this has nothing to do with the show exactly, but if you get a chance to see her live, GO! She's amazingly funny. Can't wait to rewatch both seasons.",1423008000,21,346,4.257575757575758
6964418,1,B00S89IPBG,"Here we go again... a 5 Star show gets shafted by cheap distribitors who refuse to put out a bluray set thereby ensuring a 1 Star review.
I AM NOT BUYING DVDS ANYMORE!!!! Stop releasing great shows only on DVD! You won't get my money and i will negatively review your cheapskate products! What's it going to take?!!",1421798400,4,315,4.448275862068965
6964419,5,B00S89IPBG,"I love Inside Amy Schumer, but I'm always mystified by the end credits. Why doesn't Amy give credit to all of the comedians from the 1990s and early 2000s who wrote all of the bits for her show? If you're going to use material from John Mulaney, Dave Chappelle, Patrice O'Neal, Kathleen Madigan, Tammy Pescatelli, Marc Maron, and even Mad TV, then you should have the class and dignity to give credit where credit is due. But I guess that as long as you have a body fueled by Twinkies and genitals that continually smell like a homeless man's foot, you'll always have something that people will be happy to laugh at!",1489708800,,616,4.508928571428571

6964427,5,B00S89IPBG,I'm very glad that Amy Schumer Exist.  Such a Hilarious Breath Of Fresh Air. This Show Format is #EVERYTHING.  I want her to be my New Best Friend.  I love her Series.,1466812800,2,167,4.15625
6964428,5,B00S89IPBG,"I adore the humor of Amy Schumer. She's crude, blatantly sexual, and above all, hyper sexual. While she does add very subtle amounts of social commentary, her humor is mostly about everyday observations (like all comedians ;). From her trip to Florida, where she stays at a pretentious hotel, to romantic dinners during which a bombshell is dropped on her from her date, this is, in my opinion, comedic gold. She will especially appeal to Millennials; we can identify wholeheartedly with her life! This is sketch comedy, done with small bits of stand up in between.",1465171200,2,565,4.895833333333333

6964430,5,B00S89IPBG,Thought the whole thing was unrated and it's just the bonus features. That was kind of a bummer but I love Amy!,1455926400,,111,4.090909090909091
6964431,5,B00S89IPBG,"I have been a big fan and was  late to the  party. Time to  play catch up on  DVD. My admiration for  Amy's talent has been  lowered a bit over the  revelations some  of her material was ""borrowed"" from  others which  was supposed to  be  original. Ooops! Now  she  is  being  dragged into politics by  uncle Chuck Schumer. Chuck is  using  you Amy, just say no... Stay  funny Amy and stay away from politics it may end  or limit  your career. We want the  best for and  from you.",1455840000,,480,4.134831460674158

6964469,5,B00S89IPBG,"I love her!  Season's 1& 2 were awesome! She is so raw, and hilarious. Amy is wrong in all the right ways, but she is definitely not for everyone. If you are easily offended at a total lack of ""ladylike"" behavior, or a woman who is not a afraid to poke fun at anything in a totally inappropriate manner, then she is not for you! I plan on purchasing every season they let her make.",1434326400,4,381,4.08
