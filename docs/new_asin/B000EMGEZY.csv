8111387,3,B000EMGEZY,"Papa has big problems with all of his grown childrenand finances. Heart of gold papa struggles through each of his childrens difficulties, and tries his best to support them in their strugglesuntil their struggles become his own. This drama has some comedic moments, particularly with kiddie shenanigans, but its mostly a drama of struggles. Its interesting to see Robert Montgomery in an early role and the accomplished stage actor, Louis Mann, starring in a film, but the entertainment value of this film is low. Worth watching, but contemporary viewers may struggle with it.",1526169600,,577,5.21505376344086

8111389,4,B000EMGEZY,"I had never heard of this film before I saw it for sale, but being an early MGM Robert Montgomery vehicle and being the only talking film in which Louis Mann had a role, I thought I would give it a try. I'm glad I did. Mann plays a German immigrant who has fled to the U.S. as a young man because of a violent act he commited during a fit of temper. Here in the U.S. he raises four children and becomes the owner of a barber shop. He has the chance to become the partner in a savings and loan, but discovers that his son Ludwig needs to go to a dry climate for two years so he refuses the deal so he can take his son out west.

Years later the savings and loan has become a success and the man that Louis Mann's character would have partnered with has become wealthy. On top of this, the would-be partner's son (Robert Montgomery) has grown up to be a spoiled rascal who happens to be in love with Mann's daughter. But that is the least of his problems. Although this is a very good drama in the MGM-Irving Thalberg era tradition and I highly recommend it, don't be fooled by Robert Montgomery being placed so prominently on the DVD cover. He actually has a very small supporting role. This is basically a one man show and that man is Louis Mann. He's perfect as the man for whom no sacrifice is too big where his children are concerned. That is mainly because he doesn't consider his acts sacrifices, for his most valuable possession is the love of his children. In fact, at the end, Mann's character is feeling like a failure not because of the horrific things going on in his life at that time. It is because he feels like he has lost the love and affection of his children when he is seemingly forgotten by them at Christmas.

The video quality is excellent as are all Roan restorations I've seen. The audio can be troublesome in spots but it is clear enough. There is just that background hiss in places that you often have in early talking films. There are some good extras on this DVD too. There is an introduction plus two featurettes. One featurette is on the film itself and the other is about being a child star. The final extra feature is a weird little dance number by some children entitled ""The Radiation March"". If you have other Roan DVDs you've likely seen this one before.",1236988800,6,2291,4.288683602771362
8111390,4,B000EMGEZY,"When I first saw this film, the muffled soundtrack in the beginning caused me to wonder if I would be able to get through it. Either my ear became attuned to it or the soundtrack improved as the film continued. My suggestion is to stick it out in the beginning, because this film has a sweet, moving story to tell. It's not original, but there is an endearing quality, the tone of which is set by Louis Mann as the father. Basically a stage actor, I believe he only appeared in this one film, as sadly he died in 1931. Because of his accent, I thought the film took place in Europe, but the viewer soon realizes it's small town U.S.A. in a now romanticized era long passed. Robert Montgomery is excellent in his role as a spoiled but likeable scion of a wealthy family. Leila Hyams plays one of the grown daughters of Mann's family and was one of the most beautiful actresses of her day. Elliot Nugent is very good in his role as another of the grown children. I have added this as one of the must-see Christmas films in my collection. It's a long forgotten film that really should be seen if you enjoy old classic movies and can appreciate black and white films.",1230595200,8,1163,4.339449541284404
