8154229,5,B000K4X5PS,Read the book and then watch this movie.  Or just the movie.....you will be pissed off at the pin heads guarding our country by being in charge of security.  Watch to see what the reward was for such massive screw ups.,1425686400,,218,4.2926829268292686
8154230,4,B000K4X5PS,"It is hard to believe that so many ""experts"" were fooled by this rather clever man.  A former Egyptian soldier, discharged from the Egyptian Army for his radical beliefs, joins the US Army.  He becomes an intelligence source.  And even to this day has apparently now been dealt with with regard to his crimes.

I have the book which goes into much greater detail.  It is incredible to me how the people who are supposed to keep an eye on known terrorists seem unable to follow people like this and the 9/11 terrorists.  We know that FBI Agents testified before Congress that they were watching the terrorists learn to fly airliners, but this information ""got lost"".  Information like this doesn't get lost, it gets buried.

If seem these people are more interested in spying on the American people than in the activities of known terrorists.",1377561600,2,841,4.751724137931035
8154231,4,B000K4X5PS,"I was the main character in this DVD, so I had to do a lot of research and homework on this story; and I can tell you from firsthand experience that Lance Hori (the director) and I (main character) wanted to give you a much deeper story, but the production company (Tower Productions) decided to present to our viewers an ""all Arabs are terrorists"" biased version adapted for the mind of a confederate flag hugging NASCAR-loving 3-year old toddler.

The true story is a lot more complex; and although the DVD accurately recited events leading to the 911 terrorist attacks, the real story is about a highly energetic officer that wanted to do good and service American interests by helping the Afghan Rebels fight the Russians; but then was caught off-guard in turbulent political shifts!

This guy, handsome, athletic, outgoing, was one of the CIA's main contacts to Ossama Bin Laden, not only he infiltrated Bin Laden's organization, but he also was the guy that trained Bin Laden's body guards and gained his/their unquestioned trust. In fact, when Bin Laden wanted to cross the dangerous Afghan mountains into Pakistan then to Sudan, he specifically asked (the CIA) for Ali Mohammed to lead his security team and plot the road for his safe transportation. If you do watch the movie ""Charlie's War""(it's about Senator Charlie Wilson - Tom Hanks - a senator that dedicated so much of his time, effort and political influence to fund and train the Afghan rebels to fight the Russian invasion), then you would sympathize better with Ali Mohammed's character.

He was caught in an international political cliff, right at the moment when the US government shifted its policy from spending more than 1.0 Billion a year helping Afghan rebels with weapons ammunition and training, to ZERO! One day he was CIA's top guy helping Bin Laden and the rebels, then the next day he was a no body! He was cut-off from any action, prestige or recognition for achieving an impossible task: helping a bunch of turbine wearing peasants fight the runner-up strongest military power on the planet!

The real story about this individual (Ali Mohammed) takes shape after (1) The Afghan rebels succeed in pushing out the Russians from Afghanistan; (2) The US decides to pull out from Afghanistan, and NOT invest in rebuilding the country; and (3) The Taliban rising to political power and pushing aside Bin Laden and his ""Foreign"" (non-Afghani) freedom fighters and politely asking him/them to leave. Thus causing the formation of a group of highly religious, highly trained, young and idealistic freedom fighters, looking for international recognition and ready to march to their leader's (Bin Laden) orders without question... The Birth of Al Qaeda!

Did Ali Mohamed ""Triple Cross"" the (1) FBI, (2) CIA and (3) US Army to push his own ""evil anti-western"" agenda? Was he the mastermind behind 911 as depicted in the DVD? Probably not! All I could say is that he was caught in the middle of shifting political currents and was doing his best to make a judgment call on what's right and what's wrong. The guy was a small fish in an ocean of turbulence; he was a pawn in a complicated chess game played by large intelligence agencies (CIA, KGB, MI6...etc) who themselves didn't have a plan B for these fundamentalist rebels that they helped fund and train!

All in all, the documentary had presented many facts and truthfully depicted many dry events. However, the production company could have invested a bit more effort to tell the ""Human"" story behind the character of Ali Mohammed and his motivation!

Finally, and for the record; Ali Mohammed, although depicted as an evil terrorist in the DVD, he has never been indicted, the US government never took him to court, and is currently being hidden by US Government law enforcement in a witness protection program. If he were a true terrorist, he would've been tried and booked in jail or placed on death row by now. It is the CIA, the FBI and US Army (supposedly the organizations which he ""triple"" crossed) that are hiding him and protecting him for more than 12 years after the 911 attacks! This fact alone tells you that ""the folks in power"" do not want to try one of their own, as they prefer to hide him somewhere safe than to have him expose the dirty laundry which he participated in the late 80's and 90's!

All in all, do watch the DVD it has many (dry) facts and figures, and do watch ""Charlie's War"" (the Hollywood version with Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts); to get a full 360 degree view of the full story!",1357430400,7,4544,4.779617834394904
8154232,5,B000K4X5PS,"I saw Triple Cross:Bin Laden's Spy In America a couple years ago when it aired on the National Geographic Channel. It is a gripping story of the ineptness of our CIA,FBI and DOD! Even after Egypt warned us that Ali Mohamed was dismissed from the Egyptian army for being a radical Muslim they still allowed him to join our military, where he proceeded to create the training manuals for the future Al-Qaeda,and recruited terrorists in America's mosques from coast to coast!

Will surely make all viewers ask themselves WHY,and many more questions about our government that NEED to be asked!",1257724800,3,589,4.89
8154233,4,B000K4X5PS,"I found the video informative, but not convincing.  I depends on how well one has studied and understands the Moslem world, as to how the video is interpreted.  The Moslem world's cultural and philosophical approach is so different and strange to many in the West, that they don't believe people really live and think like a Moslem.  The choose fantasy to fact.  They cannot accept a Moslem's view of life and human beings place in the world.

So, from that standpoint, I found it is a good tutorial on the modern Moslem uprising and how it reflects the mind of many Moslems.  Even to the very educated and intelligent Moslem, the ""struggle"" represents a continuation of the war against the Christian (now Western) Crusaders.  To fundamental Moslems, the struggle to win souls for Allah by the sword which began in the year 620 A. D. under Mohammed has never ceased.  It has only been thwarted by lack of funding and the dispersal of ""true believers"" as jahidist call themselves.  This video gives the viewer a sense of that struggle and the dedication of its perpetrators.",1250812800,,1073,4.756756756756757

8154235,3,B000K4X5PS,"This is an interesting story, but it is much better told in the book on which it was based. If you want the best account, I'd recommend the book.",1188000000,8,145,4.0344827586206895
