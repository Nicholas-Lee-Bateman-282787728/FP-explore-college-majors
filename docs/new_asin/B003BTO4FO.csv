8393911,5,B003BTO4FO,"This is an excellent art film, of the 3 films I've seen by Export from the Facets Limited Edition series it's both the most experimental, and for that reason my favorite. I would like there to be a DVD release of her short films for it's there that the experimentalism is really at the forefront. The film has mature content, so be mindful of that if you are considering seeing it.",1362873600,,381,4.380281690140845
8393912,5,B003BTO4FO,"Invisible Adversaries is an early film by Valie Export that was received with great enthusiasm when it was first released in 1976. It is set in 1970's Vienna, and explores female sexuality and the body in ways that had never been attempted before. The protagonist, Anne, is an artist who becomes obsessed with the idea that aliens, called Hyskos, are taking over people's bodies. As in her other films, like Menschenfrauen (1980), Export experiments with blending different audio and visual medias within the film.  For example, she makes the main character an artist and in this way integrates different styles of art. She also blends in montages,still photographs, performance art and video clips. The effects are jarring and they transport audiences into Anne's mental state. The film continues to break from conventions and offers an incomparable experience.",1320278400,2,862,5.291970802919708
