And the choreography is well worth watching. They took there on this one. And given its age its a very good transfer however it looks as though it was redone through film or transfered from vhs. There are about 3 very short runs in the film. But it doesn't take away from the film much at all.

I would have given it a 5 star rating because for me its the best film Chi did out of all his Shaw movies. But the Chinese Native Americans in the forest [I'm Native American] Was a bit much. And there is a surprise in this movie that makes you go what the heck!

But all in all its very good. The humor is also very good. You will enjoy the laughs. This movies emotional aspect also made the movie worth seeing. Its like I said a really different Martial Arts movie. A must have to your DVD Martial Arts collection.",1174176000,4,986,4.051282051282051

Here is a brief synopsis on this flick,,,,,I hate giving synopsis on movis,,i do belive it take away from the core of the flick,,,,Therefore, I  do this with immense reservations: ""Iron Neck Li"" is about this dude ""Chi Kuan Chun"", who has a history of putting his neck on the line for the citizens of his neigbourhood, protecting them from the bully leaders, and governors.  One fine day,,it just so happened that the King/ Emperor (A really nice guy), was passing through the town incognito and saw this great deed, Iron Neck Li fighting some thugs,who just murdered a fellow citizen.  Not only did the Emperor saved him from execution but also spoke on his behalf, thus spearing his life,,the Emperor then hired him to be his personal body guard.  They then too a trip to Taiwan. The rest you can just imagine the chaos and mayhem.  This flick has all the features of an amazing old school performance,,,,the choreography and cinematograpy well put together.  A really tight, and great story.  The dvd transfer very good.  You will not be dissapointed!!",1152662400,,1192,4.714975845410628
