8553262,5,B00AL1G890,"First saw Brent Nixon on a cruise to Alaska from Seattle, WA on board the Infinity. His lectures are second to no one. They are excellent is really an understatement as are his videos, including this one on Otters, Seals & Sea Lions, Bears, and Alaska. We learned so much from his lectures, which are duplicated on the videos. From beginning to end you are entertained and taught all at the same time! Well worth the money and time invested in the video.",1404604800,2,454,4.481927710843373
