8256050,5,B0014M3HZ8,This DVD is a life saver. I can now wrap my little one on my back with ease. I can keep my house clean. It is absolutley amazing how my little one immediately falls asleep after being wrapped. So glad this DVD exists.,1400198400,,217,4.069767441860465
8256051,5,B0014M3HZ8,"Tummy 2 Tummy is an instructional babywearing DVD; it is intended to be used as a reference, so most people won't watch all of the content in one sitting, and it is very easy to navigate.  The DVD has multiple menus and it also comes with a list of each of the sections so that it is very easy to watch sections about particular babywearing options or it also easy to navigate and find whatever you're looking for.

The DVD is obviously produced by regular people (moms who have experience with wearing their babies, I guess, and from the back of the DVD it looks like each of the ladies also has some sort of website or business that relates to babywearing).  Since they are not models it is easy to relate to the ladies and it really doesn't seem like they are performing ""stunts"" when they hoist the babies around into interesting carries.  It all seems very doable. The downside of having non-actors instruct us is that they have varying levels of comfort with being filmed.  I thought Darien (ring slings) and Kelley (Asian back carriers) seemed totally at ease; Tanya (pouches) seemed really nervous and kept saying ""butt"" which I thought was distracting since it didn't match the tone of the rest of the production, and Tracy (simple pieces of cloth) was all right but her voice was kind of soft and hard to hear.  All of the ladies seemed totally knowledgeable about the topics that they covered, and they were friendly and fun to watch.  They were easy to relate to, and watching the subjects felt kind of like having a friend show you how to start babywearing; it almost seemed like their phone numbers should have been included so that you could call them up if you had any questions, because they seem so friendly and eager to help.

Each of the sections includes a discussion on safety.  They often recommend looking in a mirror to make sure that things look right when you're wearing your baby.  As I've tried some of the back carries that are new to me, I've done that and it has been really helpful.  They also suggest putting your baby on while you're sitting down (if you need to), or having someone else ""spot"" you to keep things safe as you're getting started.

The DVD contains a lot of information that is not typically mentioned in the babywearing videos that are on YouTube.  For each type of babywearing they talk about the different types of fabric, or other options that are available for the different types of carry.  A couple examples of this: discussion on whether you want padding, partial padding, or no padding for a sling; discussion on when and how to choose a pouch.  In the ""Asian back carriers"" section Kelley talks about Podaegis and the Onbuhimu, which I had never heard of, so I thought that was interesting.  Each section includes how to nurse while babywearing with whatever method you're using, how to get the baby out when you're done babywearing, and there are troubleshooting sections to cover common problems with each type of babywearing--and how to correct the problems.  The ring sling troubleshooting section reminded me of when I first tried wearing my daughter because I had most of the problems that she fixes, but I gradually figured out how to fix them on my own.  It would have been nice to have this DVD back when I was starting with that!

Each section shows caries that are classified as ""basic"" or ""advanced"", and they have little icons to indicate what ages a particular carry is most suitable for.

There were only a couple things that I didn't really like about this DVD: first, the backgrounds are ugly! They remind me of my high school yearbook pictures.  Aside from the backgrounds, the DVD seems totally up-to-date, though.  The other thing was, this DVD boasts ""detailed demonstrations of over 50 positions!"" so I figured that with only four sections I would definitely learn some new ways to carry my daughter!  If I counted correctly there are a total of 32 carries for the first three sections, and 26 carries using a piece of cloth.  Well, I have a Moby wrap, but I wasn't really interested in learning new ways to tie my daughter onto me.  I didn't notice that half of the DVD is about pieces of cloth (wrap/shawl/pareo).  I may be more interested in that section later, but I can't really see myself becoming interested in shawls and pareos.  The carries for the other carriers were all kind of similar: tummy to tummy, hip carry, back carry, etc.

Overall, this is still a fantastic DVD!  I think the best thing about it is that it makes everything look realy doable.  All of the carries are actually demonstrated with a real child.  (It's kind of fun, too, because you sometimes you see the same kids and since this wasn't filmed all on one day the same kids are different ages.  I liked that.)

Also, this DVD makes it obvious that you don't have to spend much (or anything at all) to wear your baby effectively.  If you want to try babywearing and don't want to spend $100-300 on an Ergo or some other fancy carrier, you can spend a couple dollars on some fabric that you like, or use a piece of cloth that you already own, and you can have all of the same benefits that come with babywearing.  (The section about pieces of fabric is very specific about dimensions.)

I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who is interested in babywearing and wants to learn how to do it, especially if you don't have a friend nearby that can get you started.  If you're introducing someone to babywearing, this would be an awesome gift.  I think it would also be a great resource for babywearing groups.",1360195200,2,5568,4.586868686868687
8256052,5,B0014M3HZ8,"I have a Moby wrap. It covers using 3 other styles of baby carriers as well, but since I have a Moby, I'm focusing on that part of the video.  I actually had this video with my first child, but just never got around to watching it. Big mistake!  This video shows you many ways to use the Moby that solved a lot of my struggles: how to nurse in the wrap, how to put the wrap on very quickly, how to put the wrap on while holding your child (when you cant or your baby won't let you put them down, )how to use the wrap for back and hip carries (not covered in Moby instructions.) Also discussed type of fabric to use that keeps child cool and child can  breath through.  My baby would often get too hot in the Moby. After watching this video,  I ended up looking up ""woven baby wrap"" on Internet and purchasing a wrap made of a light cotton gauzy material that is more comfortable for baby. They also describe more  variations of the basic wraps that
Moby demonstrates which make it easier to adjust to infants age. I have my 2nd child who is now 6 days old and  after using a variation from this video, figured out a carry that gives good head support.

 Basically women have been using wraps to carry their children for thousands of years. Every struggle you have using a wrap has been experienced and solved by mothers who have come before you. This video taps into this rich trove of wisdom. Essential if you plan to babywear.",1334534400,,1428,4.239852398523985
8256053,5,B0014M3HZ8,"I bought this DVD because I am expecting my second child and I am planning on babywearing him very early using the Tibetan rucksack carry. I learned a lot more than I expected, instructions are very clear and each carrier type covered (ring sling, pouches, Asian back carriers, simple pieces of cloth) has interesting features. I had a ring sling and a back carrier for my first child and really liked both but I wanted to know more about babywearing, especially for a newborn and this DVD is a very good resource.",1295308800,2,514,4.5978260869565215
