7453573,5,B015XC8BT6,"I LOVED this movie!!
 It's very creative and very, very funny. My husband & I laughed so hard throughout, as did our 16 year old daughter.
It is entertaining and I highly recommend it!

 It's about a close family. It's a love story, and it's all true as it's a creative documentary. Just adored this movie!!!  Unfortunately it seemed to have had a small, short release in very few theaters. Also, like, no advertising. Too bad, as it's incredibly entertaining, just what a movie should be. Google the trailer. It's even a lot funnier than that.
I'm so glad it's available on Amazon, now more people can see it! I'm a huge fan of this movie, as you can see!",1450137600,4,656,4.441666666666666
7453574,4,B015XC8BT6,"""Meet the Patels"" (2014 release; 88 min.) brings the story of Ravi Patel (TV actor best known for his work in Past Lives , and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia) and his quest for the perfect mate. As the movie opens, we see an animated sequence in which Ravi is telling us what's been going on. We then go back 2 years, when he and his parents and sister go on a family vacation to India. And that it is a ""family"" vacation becomes all too clear as it turns out in his dad's home village of Gujarat, most people are named Patel. Eventually Ravi decides to try the matchmaking skills of his parents (who themselves married in an arranged wedding). Will Ravi find his perfect mate? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this movie is a labor of love for Ravi and his sister Geeta Patel, who co-directed. With little or no budget, they film the dating adventures or Ravi for over 2 years. And did I tell you that the Patel parents are in the movie? ""Almost 30, never married: Code Red!"" is how Ravi describes himself. His dad came to the US in 1967, and obviously has done very well for himself. He is also a doting dad, always ready, willing and able to give advice to his kids, whether they want it or not. There are plenty of hilarious scenes in the first half of the movie, to the obvious enjoyment of the theater audience. The second half of the movie is not so much laugh-out-loud funny, but more a reflection on the importance of family. Please note: you do NOT have to be Indian or Indian-American to enjoy this movie (I am not). There is a surprising amount of great music placement throughout the film, including MIA, Hot Chocolate, Soup Purpose, and many others. This movie was first released at the 2014 Los Angeles Film festival. No idea why this has been sitting on the shelves for over a year before finally getting released in theaters...

""Meet the Patels"" opened this weekend out of the blue at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati without any pre-release advertising or hype. I love a good documentary, and so I checked it out. The early evening screening where I saw this at was attended much better than I had anticipated, and I should point out that there were quite a few from the Indian community here in Cincinnati. This is a light-hearted documentary that flew by in no time. If you like documentaries or a glimpse at the dating scene in the Indian-American community, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Meet the Patels"" is worth checking out!",1445126400,20,2569,4.487179487179487

7453609,4,B015XC8BT6,"Seen free on the PBS Independent Lens website.

This is a home-made movie made by Geeta Patel, sister of Ravi. The weaknesses of the home-made techniques may interfere with your interest and enjoyment of the film.

However, if you have any interest in Indian culture in general, or in the institution of arranged marriages, you will find this a very interesting experience.

The Patel family is gigantic, and arranged marriages are a useful social institution, ensuring compatibility and avoiding genetic weaknesses. A number of my Indian friends have told me horror stories about the weaknesses of these marriages -- a form of ""slavery"" to some.

The Patels give a much more optimistic version of their reality -- they believe many of the horror stories are exaggerated, but emphasize that this is one small slice of life -- they are not on a crusade but simply telling it the way their parents found it and how it worked for Ravi.

This is the best PBS documentaries I've seen on Independent Lens -- it makes my yearly contribution pay great dividends. The family values on display in this film are very heartening, and many of the people were very interesting. I agree with another reviewer;  ""the star of the film was the father, he's smart, very witty, funny as hell and could see him doing other films, someone should do a reality show about him and his family! He's a born natural in front of the camera, we can learn so much from a man like this, his insight into human nature is astounding!""

Overall, I found the film honest and enlightening, despite the technical weaknesses.

7453613,5,B015XC8BT6,"I thought this was one of the funniest documentaries I have seen.  It is better than most comedy films being released today.  That said, it offered so many new insights into present day Indian culture and the adjustments of first generation Indian American's was fresh. First generation American's have always struggled to meld the pressures to adhere to the old while they identify with their environment (3 of my grandparents were European immigrants so I heard lots of stories growing up).  I have always been fascinated by Indian culture and I have had many Indian friends over the years, (I even had a short-term relationship with an Indian) and I have known several Patels (on an acquaintance basis only) and yet, I learned so much!

This story has a great deal of insight into the meaning of family and common bonds across cultures.  If you read the other reviews, you know that Ravi Patel is nearly 30 (I think the documentary time period is about 18 months) and he's under extreme pressure from his parents and relatives to find an Indian mate, preferably another Patel (Patels come from small area within Gujarat region and in India, their cultural standards are to marry another Patel).  However, his parents (both Patels from this region) are open to him marrying someone beyond the Patel lineage (as time passes and he fails to meet any female Patel that appeals to him during a trip to Gujarat; their focus shifts to any Indian woman as they focus more on grand babies than specific bloodlines).  As Ravi makes the effort to travel throughout the U.S. and Canada to meet potential candidates (some who were nice enough to allow the date to be filmed); he comes to realize that none of these women measure up to his former Caucasian American girlfriend, with whom he ended his relationship when he began his search.  I won't give away the ending.

Ravi's father is a very funny and intelligent man, who offers the voice of reason throughout the story. However, both parents are emotionally suffering at the possibility that their son may never marry (to which they equate that he will never be happy).  Their arguments are heartbreaking and as the observer, you can identity at some level with each point of view.  At one point, his parents subtly broach their concern that he isn't attracted to females and he is at a loss for fear that they will not accept his past with dating women who are not Indian (he has never mentioned one woman, whom he has dated so their suspicions are legitimate to them). His sister is responsible for this documentary and in large part presents an unbiased point of view.  There are exceptions but when her insights are share they are typically recollections of growing up in the U.S. with immigrant parents, which thoughtfully adds to the dynamic of the story line.

One thing I found as an odd criticism among the reviews was that it had a few animated portions to this video.  These were put in place when Ravi was actually recording in audio only.  These scenes were mostly times when he had great emotion (after intense arguments with parents or a disappointing dating experience and a few that will spoil the ending).  I totally respect someone, who would allow such personal thoughts to be broadcast to the world.  The fact, he didn't want his face on camera is not shameful nor did it detract from the overall narrative to this documentary.  I watch about 80-100 documentaries a year, some very professional with lots of money behind it and others with little expertise or financing.  Though the big money was not behind this (or didn't appear to be), I thought it was done very professionally and hats off to his sister, Geeta Patel. Another reviewer said it was hard to follow, I think they were distracted or uninterested in the topic as I found this flowed quite well.

I actually got this from my local library and I got into a great discussion with the librarian when I returned it. She was very enthusiastic about watching it after I highlighted the key components.  I ended by saying, ""I want to be a Patel"" after watching this.  I would definitely watch this again!  I may even buy it but not at its current price of $180. on this site!",1482969600,2,4198,4.689373297002724

7453622,4,B015XC8BT6,"I like films with Anglo-Indian themes. This one is no exception. I enjoyed this film, which I saw on Netflix. It is a sort of cinema verite', quasi-documentary, offering a sneak peak into Indian culture. The senior Patels were born in India, migrating to the USA in 1967. Their children, Ravi and Geeta, were born in the USA. Hence, there is a bit of a culture clash when it comes to marriage.

This film follows the efforts of the senior Patels to get their son, Ravi, married to a nice Indian girl. Who knew that an entire world-wide network exists to do just that? So, I found the cultural aspects of this film to be quite interesting. The parents eventually come to terms with the concept that the ""heart wants what the heart wants"". Though the ending of the film is no surprise, it is the journey that is of interest.

There is some animation interspersed throughout the film, which I found enjoyable. The use of a hand held camera by Ravi's sister,  Geeta, who is the actual filmmaker, makes this film a truly family affair,  and gives the film a home made feel. While the film is not what I had expected, overall, I enjoyed it, as the Patels are a likable family.",1475366400,,1170,4.453271028037383

He goes on a whirlwind series of dates across the country and back to India to speak more to people, and ultimately found his love. The film is a cute mix of animation, professional video, and home made handy-cam footage.

It is a look inside a segment of East Indian culture, and how a young Indian man born and raised in the States is not able to find an Indian girl to marry, though his parents are pressuring him.  He's actually in love with an Anglo American girl but is afraid if he marries her his parents won't approve and he'll lose touch with his native culture.

Must be supreme pressures for these kids if they are not married by 30.

After watching this movie, you will wonder if Ravi and Audrey are forever happy, well the movie doesn't tell but you can find out on the Web.

7453707,3,B015XC8BT6,"""Meet the Patels"" is very funny in a natural way. The parents are endearing, lovable, and 3Dimensional people who want what's best for their children. I found myself thoroughly enjoying the is moving 85% because of the parents and/or anecdotal stories the kids told about their family/Patel community. However, I found Ravi and his sister Geeta wanting, while I respect and appreciate their willingness to put themselves on camera and show there flaws I just ended feeling sorry for their parents--the kids did seem spoiled and slightly selfish. It's clear Ravi has succumb to all of the worst attributes of western men, namely unwillingness to grow up. It's clear why he doesn't want seriously date an Indian girl--HE DOESN""T WANT TO PULL THE TRIGGER--he know's he'd ACTUALLY have to MARRY an Indian girl. He just wants to use his American girl and ""date"" until their both pushing 40. I found myself calling him a scumbag when he read his ex-girlfriend's email aloud on camera, that felt deeply personal and private and I really felt like I was intruding.

7453810,5,B015XC8BT6,"This documentary is the total package. It's funny but it's also poignant in so many ways. You feel like you know the subjects, because parents and adult children are universal. This doc captured so vividly the incredible pressure that Indian adults are under to get married. And the courage to take a different path. The benefit is that it taught a lot about the culture and sub culture within the culture. I had no idea, and it left me wanting to learn more. A peek under the cover of the culture/race. What I found annoying although I'm sure it's not unique, that when the Indian second generation explored dating outside the culture they would always assume the alternative would be white. They would say how would our parents feel if we married a white woman/man as if that was the ultimate choice. Versus wondering how parents would accept a non-Indian (for example no mention of possibly dating a black woman, who are actually closer in skin color). Small peeve. I adored this documentary. It used cool/imaginative techniques and used devices that made the doc absolutely and completely entertaining. And at the end they finally showed the film maker sister. One thing it brought home for me is that the dating ""fix up"" dating system could work if we let it, and how we instead try to meet someone by chance/random. Maybe the secret is to find someone with a strong link to your values and common experience.",1454198400,,1414,4.728744939271255

The obvious love these parents have for their son shines through and that's the problem. Ravi wants to please his parents and goes to great lengths to find an acceptable Indian wife. Great lengths! His search for an acceptable Patel wife takes him on a  cross-country and intercontinental journey, dating dozens of girls along the way.

Ravi's sister (who is also single and a disappointment on that account) holds the camera. Definitely has a home movie quality. But it isn't that noticeable once you get into the story.

7453832,5,B015XC8BT6,"""Meet the Patels"" is a heartwarming and funny portrayal of the pursuit of matrimony as seen through the eyes of Ravi Patel, a 30--year-old American Indian man who is torn between being true to his own feelings and pleasing his family, especially his parents who above all, wish for him to settle down with an ideal girl, only their idea of the ideal girl is a girl of Indian origin with traditional values. This docu-drama (filmed by both Ravi and his sister Geeta Patel) traces the parents' efforts in match-making their only son, an adventure that takes them to India and back.

I loved the cultural portrayal of matrimony as seen by the Indian community - throughout the docu-drama, Indian couples, both young and old, attest to the effectiveness of matchmaking, and many couples seem perfectly content to have been match-made. But Ravi and his sister, Geeta (who is also unmarried), just can't seem to get into this cultural tradition. They are both educated and have spent their lives in America and have come to accept the duality of their existence: part of them identifies strongly with being Indian and they are perfectly happy with this, enjoying the camaraderie and closeness that comes from being part of a larger community that is close-knit and loyal; and the other part, which embraces being American and having friends who are of diverse backgrounds.

Ravi's openness to having his parents matchmake for him is countered by his agonizing over the break-up of his relationship with his long-term girlfriend, Audrey, who happens to be white, and whose existence is kept secret from Ravi's parents for most of the film. There was much in this film that resonated with me - since I too am Indian, though female, and chose a less conventional path in pursuit of personal happiness, just like Ravi did. The beauty of the film is its ultimate message of acceptance and tolerance and the acknowledgment that in the end - it is one's personal happiness that is important and the deciding factor in the choices one makes. Funny, ironic, and heartwarming, ""Meet the Patels"" is recommended!",1453593600,,2094,4.895774647887324

This only happened Meet the Patels]]when people spoke rapidly and the times there were no subtitles  At the beginning of the movie it is mentioned that his sister is doing the filming and she doesn't always get good images, etc.  The animation is short, when it is used, and is about the topic being discussed.

First off; it's genuinely funny. Ravi and his dad share a sense of humor that transcends culture and gender. You will laugh out loud.
Secondly: it's fast paced with snappy editing, thus eliminating the boredom that dooms many docs. It avoids another doc killer:  a preachy and/or artificial tone.
Third: you get observe a loving, real family, warts and all. After watching this: I even got a sense of the invisible, behind the camera sister. I fell in love with the parents.
Fourth: the struggle between valuing your culture of origin and adapting to American culture is fascinating. The viewer is treated to the delights of Indian cuisine fashion dating and weddings. I'm not Indian, but just like in 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' I recognized many aspects in this family.
Fifth: the family's struggles and love are genuinely moving. The wisdom and insight of arranged marriages were a surprising eye opener. I actually got tearful watching the traditional Indian mother, struggle with her kids' modern relationship notions.

It is a sweet movie in the sense that all of the parties involved want to do the right thing. The parents simply want to have their kids use the same formula that in their culture brings the most success in marriage and in life because they care the most above all for their children's happiness and well being. The children in turn want to please their parents and do what is correct and pro survival in their culture, but since they have been exposed and lived in a different culture, they have evolved very differently. I along with thousands of other children who have grown up with two cultures knows it is very difficult to operate only in one culture as a grown up who has been exposed to two cultures. Anyhow the movie shows the struggle but it is done with so much love and care and laughter and honesty that I hated to see the movie end. This was a very entertaining, well done documentary/movie. I actually would like to see a sequel: Ravi and Audrey married with children and the adventures that will bring, with the extended family?.

7453893,1,B015XC8BT6,"Had high expectations. This movie coukd have been shooted for just hslf hour. Camera work could have been better by hiring a professional video grapher even if it is portraid as documentary. At times the main character was not at all in the frame during the dualogues. Story was dragged for too long n also this applies to one particular Indian community. Indian families in general who have migrated 20 or 30 years ago from all other parts of India, and who have permanently settled in the USA, now a days are very open to other cultural values in this country. The dating game or process is  exaugurated a littke bit more or may be it happened personally just in their household n not true for other families in general. Not worth your money on the home video so called as a""documentary movie"" as you know some of the excellent professional movies are streamable online for free...",1451433600,3,883,4.624203821656051
