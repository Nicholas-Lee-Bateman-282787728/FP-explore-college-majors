8409952,1,B003Z606KU,"The DVD would have been much better without the truly awful music which sometimes played over the talking. Every time there was a break in the instruction and general descriptions of the scene, and the video showed the actual fishing, that horrible music would start up again, as if fishermen need music to enjoy fishing. Someone's kid on the staff of In-Fisherman has a crappy band needing work so why not torture those who want to learn about fishing with some stinky music. I won't be purchasing another DVD in the series.",1409356800,,525,4.717391304347826
8409953,3,B003Z606KU,If you have watched the TV show this is probably all old segments. I enjoyed this DVD and thought it was much better than prime time pan fish even though the perch segment is the same. (and kind of boring) This DVD is worth checking out for beginners and the spinner baits used for white bass in this DVD do catch fish. (I use them) This DVD is worth checking out if you are really into pan fish and want to catch more of them but for veterans this DVD may not be what your looking for.,1375142400,,486,4.020618556701031
8409954,1,B003Z606KU,"This is a great dvd if you have a $10,000 a week fishing budget and own all the equipment on the plant. There is nothing anywhere on this dvd to help you catch cold much less a fish. All this is a much of clips from previous tv shows. If you looking for some dvd to help you catch more fish. This ain't it! Very disappointed to say the least.
