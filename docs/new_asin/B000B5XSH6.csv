8081744,4,B000B5XSH6,"I based my rating on the overall content.  This is a fun way to play the guitar but in order to follow De Rey's method, you must have more than a beginner experience, this is for a high intermediate player.  It is fun to see how she manipulates the guitar and fretboard but I think a bit more explanation in the accompanying  instructional booklet would indeed be more helpful.",1365724800,,377,4.434782608695652
8081745,5,B000B5XSH6,"The DVD is thoroughly enjoyable.  Del Rey is a wonderful performer and teacher.  She's patient, clear and concise.  The audio/video quality is excellent as is the lighting.  The only thing you see is Del and her guitar with a black backdrop.
The Boogie Woogie, Stride material is fun and can definitely be a spicy, interesting boost to anyone's solo repertoire.
Del has a charming vocal style but you can sing and phrase the tunes to fit your own personality or simply play the guitar and leave out the vocals.
The Boogie Woogie/Stride techniques are invaluable and will carry over into other songs.  When watching the DVD, I caught myself thinking, ""How might Rory Gallagher have approached these songs?  How can I approach/alter the vocals and phrasing to fit my personality and perspective?""  It can be done.
There's a lot of great stuff here and a booklet with big tab is included as well!
To the beginners, intermediate players and even the advanced players not versed in this type of material; my advise is to relax.  Listen to how the bass line and melody work together.  Don't get frustrated.  Take your time.  There's a learning curve.
Open up your eyes, ears and mind.  With practice it's possible; and best of all Boogie Woogie/Stride style is fun and well worth the effort.

Other than that I would really just echo everything that Charles Kahler wrote in his review.",1352851200,,1379,4.7923728813559325
8081746,5,B000B5XSH6,"Del Ray teaches five songs on this DVD, and also teaches a long exercise featuring different walking basses.  The Homespun difficulty rating is Level 4 (advanced intermediate).  While the pieces are difficult, a good Level 3 player (intermediate player) would benefit greatly from this DVD. The exercise and first three tunes are in standard tuning, the next in Dropped D, and the last in Open G.  All are in Fingerstyle and all are lots of fun.  Del Rey's performances of the songs and her instruction are without flaw.  Her way of walking basses is unique and clever.  If you are interested in Boogie Woogie guitar, you have to have this DVD.  If you want to learn to walk basses all the way up the fingerboard without using your thumb, you have to have this DVD.  If you want to improve your blues guitar playing, you have to have this DVD.",1127088000,14,843,4.573333333333333
