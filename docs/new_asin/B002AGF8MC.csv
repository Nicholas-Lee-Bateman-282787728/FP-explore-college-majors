8359445,1,B002AGF8MC,"The person selling this is doing so illegally. He does not own the rights to it. He is currently trying to sell on his website, what appear to be homemade copies of presentation DVDs from many different researchers in this field. The man's name is Bill Knell and it is rumored he is currently under investigation for these practices.

As another reviewer stated, this DVD is very disappointing in its production quality. This is because it was not produced in the way this seller describes; it was not produced and directed for TV, as the seller implies. Also, the copies were apparently homemade, by the seller, which probably accounts for the HGTV segment that the other reviewer found at the end.

If you want good information, please search on the names of the researchers and go directly to them for information on purchasing DVDs. This will ensure that you get the best quality product and that you continue to support the work they do.",1252195200,,942,4.737804878048781
8359446,2,B002AGF8MC,"This is not a professional video look at the major themes of Richard M. Dolan's book, ""UFOs and the National Security State: Chronology of a Cover-up 1941-1973."" This is a videotaped MUFON meeting with Dolan as a guest speaker. He has a PowerPoint presentation and the video sometimes cuts away from the speaker to look at the slideshow, other times, the speaker is inserted in a small box which is re-sized on the fly to accommodate more data appearing on the screen.

I had hoped for a professional-style documentary, like a History Channel documentary with footage and narration. Unfortunately, this DVD fell far short. In addition to the above-noted features, the frames occasionally freeze and twice there was garbled sound.

I gave this DVD two stars instead of one because Dolan is a pretty good speaker and his talk was interesting. In no case should anyone confuse this DVD with a professional production. At the very end of my copy, there were a couple of minutes of video from HGTV, cementing my impression of this having been a purely amateur production. Let the buyer beware!",1248220800,5,1088,4.875675675675676
