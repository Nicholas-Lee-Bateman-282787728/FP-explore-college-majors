8141426,2,B000HT38E4,"The triple bill is intriguing, but Island is bonkers (and Marlon Brado is bad in it) and Dark City is a montage of scenes that don't come together. The Hidden? Probably not going to watch it given the other 2 movies on the DVD.",1432080000,,227,4.181818181818182

8141429,4,B000HT38E4,"All 3 films are full screen. I knew that before ordering, and think you should too. A very inexpensive way to preview some movies, before purchasing better copies.

The Island of Dr. Moreau is about a cast away who soon finds himself on a remote island, run by a scientist, ""playing God"" and his equally mad protg, and populated by dozens of their failed experiments. Not enough of Brando's insane brilliance, but very strange and beautiful. Much better than the critics led me to think, when it was originally released. I might go for the wide screen version, at some time. 3.5 stars.

I loved Dark City when I first saw it, but that was long ago. I wanted to be sure it held up, before investing in a more expensive version. An ordinary man wakes up in a strange film noir world, where the life that is unfolding before him doesn't seem to be his, so he endeavors to find out what's going on. Great, idea driven Sci-Fi that never bores. I will pick up the wide screen director's cut soon. 4.5 stars.

The Hidden is a low budget Sci-Fi, crime thriller that is fun enough. A police detective, in pursuit of a strange homicidal maniac is joined by a slightly odd FBI agent.  I liked it, but will probably settle for this copy. 2.5 stars.

My final 4 star rating is for the value as well as the quality of the movies. No deductions for being full screen, because I knew that's what I purchased.",1297468800,10,1392,4.400778210116732
8141430,3,B000HT38E4,"I bought this set purely for ""dark city"".  The other two movies are okay, but if I had it to do over again I would have just gotten ""dark city"" as a single.",1249776000,2,156,3.727272727272727
8141431,3,B000HT38E4,"""Dark city"" shows Keifer Sutheland as an evil, mouth-breathing doctor vs. the bad guy from ""End of Days"" (who here plays a good guy), whereas ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"" features Val Kilmer being slowly driven insane by freaky man/animal hybrids and a creepy, doughy Marlon Brando.  If only there were some way to combine these two movies...

It's a lot of weird for a little money.",1227571200,8,381,4.6716417910447765
