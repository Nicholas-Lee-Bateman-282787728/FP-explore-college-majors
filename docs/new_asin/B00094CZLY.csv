8133308,5,B00094CZLY,"Thanks to John Schneider, fans can have a look behind the scenes of the making of the Reunion shows made in 1996 - 97. John took his own home movies and interviews the cast from the iconic Dukes of Hazzard series from the late 70s and early 80s. Excellent for anyone who wants to keep up with their famous comedic actors from Hazzard County. A must for real Dukes' fans.",1325030400,,370,4.3
