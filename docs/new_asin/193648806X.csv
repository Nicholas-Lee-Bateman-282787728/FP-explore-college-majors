203753,3,193648806X,"When is the 2nd coming of Christ?  No one really knows.  I heard one pastor say, we keep looking for the end of time when what we really need to be concerned with is the end of our time on earth.  No one is promised their next breath.  Our decisions made in this life will affect our home in eternity.  The last pope speaks of some interesting facts and possibilities but in the end we just need to love Jesus",1380844800,7,409,4.0625
203754,2,193648806X,"I gave it a two-star rather than a one-star review, because I didn't ""hate"" the video, I just couldn't finish watching it.  I shut it off after the first five minutes; it not only failed to capture my attention, but the music score overshadowed the dialogue.  A few days later I tried again, for ten to fifteen minutes. Off again.  For those of you who prefer, or require closed caption, this video doesn't have it.",1380758400,6,415,4.506666666666667
203755,5,193648806X,"In this documentary, Tom Horn and Chris Putnam delve into a prophecy supposedly inspired by a vision that Saint Malachy was given in the 12th century. This vision was of the next consecutive 112 popes. Pope Francis is now this 112th pope. So how does this documentary handle this somewhat controversial topic?

First off, there is no attempt to hide the critical scrutiny given to the prophecy. Mr. Horn and Mr. Putnam clearly explain that the lineage may have been a forgery prior to the late 1500s, but after this, a publication cements the description given for the remaining popes. So the evidence they present is fairly balanced and honest in my opinion.

What I found interesting (and wish they would have expounded on) were prophecies throughout time and cultures and geographic location which also support some type of major change occurring to humanity in the exact same time frame (2012 - 13). These include prophecies from the Mayans, the Aztecs, Native American tribes, the Zohar, and even Jonathan Edwards! And before you dismiss any visions of end times prophecy coming from non-Christian sources, remember that God gave king Nebuchadnezzar very powerful, prophetic dreams - and he was by no means a believer in the true God.

This DVD draws on the excellent research done for the books&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Petrus-Romanus-The-Final-Pope-Is-Here/dp/0984825614/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Petrus Romanus: The Final Pope Is Here</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Exo-Vaticana-Petrus-Romanus-Project-LUCIFER-and-the-Vatican-s-astonishing-exo-theological-plan-for-the-arrival-of-an-alien-savior/dp/0984825630/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Exo-Vaticana: Petrus Romanus, Project LUCIFER, and the Vatican's astonishing exo-theological plan for the arrival of an alien savior</a>. I have read Exo Vaticana and half (so far) of Petrus Romanus and recommend them highly. (In fact, Tom Horn will be releasing another book entitled, ""Zenith 2016"" shortly which I am looking forward to reading.)

The documentary leaves off with a positive tone. It's the idea that even if this pope is not the final one before the great tribulation takes place, the prophecy has stirred many Christian around the world and may help to lead to some kind of a world-wide Christian awakening. Let's pray that is the case.",1375401600,48,2407,6.112426035502959
203756,5,193648806X,"I don't mean that as an insult. Its just that I bought this off of survivormall.com which is Tom horns webstore and I just figured they wouldnt have enough money to make a high quality doc. I was wrong. This doc is higher quality than most history channel docs. Beautifully made, great scenery, great speakers, informative. Loved it. I only wish I delved deeper and was a bit longer. So Mr Horn if you are reading this please please make another! I would love one dealing with Exo Vaticana and delving into that. Also make it at least an hour anf a half for 20 bucks. But I still enjoyed it!",1374105600,26,591,4.333333333333333

203760,2,193648806X,I was really disappointed. I thought this was based on Bible prophecy not some obscure bishop. I paid way too much for a disappointing hour.,1397347200,2,140,4.64
203761,4,193648806X,And quite likely considering it is quoting St. Matthew and St. John prophecies of the Last Days.  There is a last pope before the Apocalupse.,1395705600,,141,4.64

203763,5,193648806X,"Quite provocative and rather convincing...is Tom Horn's ""The Last Pope?""  Historical prophecy backs up his opinion(s). I highly recommend it for viewing (easier than reading). Am planning on reading his book on this topic, as well.",1392076800,,231,5.416666666666667

7802022,3,193648806X,"I'm Catholic and was very interested in the prophecies....but unfortunately this DVD did not really inspire me nor did it really get ""into"" what the Title implies. To be very honest...I fell asleep watching it half way through..maybe I was just tired..but It only ""hypnotized me "" into a deep sleep...that was the purpose!!??",1435536000,,325,5.037037037037037

7802027,4,193648806X,"This movie has good information. I had heard most of it from other sources. If you have been in the conspiracy theories on youtube or if you are familiar with the prophecy of the popes but Malachy, you probably have heard this information. If you haven't studied this out yet, The Last Pope? will give you a quick update on what you need to know.",1408579200,,346,4.338461538461538
