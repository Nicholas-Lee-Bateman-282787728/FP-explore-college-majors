8532085,4,B008XCIVPS,"It's important to note that this DVD does NOT have English subtitles. If you need them, you'll have to look for a subtitle file online. I only knocked off one star for that, since the item title does state that it's a Japan DVD, and the details do specify that they're Japanese subtitles. I don't mind doing a little extra work to add the English subtitles, as this movie is out of print everywhere except Japan.",1501113600,,412,4.434210526315789
