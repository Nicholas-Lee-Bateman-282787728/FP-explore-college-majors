8520299,2,B007PCGSEI,"This double feature has an OK image quality, but it seems amazing they could not fit subtitles into either of the movies. Also, 1408 comes with only one of the endings (I personally liked the other one better). I found the experience of buying this bundle completely lacking as I just do not conceive what technical difficulties they could have come across to justify not having subtitles, even if only English ones.

As far as movies go, The Mist is a very entertaining feature about alien things in a mist that end up killing whoever makes it out there. The most interesting part is the social breakdown that the people trapped outside of the mist start to experience as their universe shrinks and their survival instincts start to take over. That being said, I can think of few ways the monsters can be made to look faker or cheaper. It is truly appalling the low budget/quality of the monsters, up to the point where it would have been better not to show them at all.

1408 is a nice feature about an 'evil room' and you truly begin to feel the claustrophobia of the supernatural investigator trapped in the room. I thought it was an interesting kind of horror as the main character is not against an adversary that he can focus, but rather against an evil entity that surrounds him... like The Force :) I did not like, however, that there are two endings to this film and only one of those makes it into this blu ray. I would have assumed they could have fit the extra 15 minutes of an alternate ending in there but... if even subtitles didn't make it in what can we expect about multiple endings, right?",1404604800,7,1609,4.488054607508532
8520300,5,B007PCGSEI,"I bought these blu-rays, together, as  it was a better deal than buying them alone. They are both excellent quality, which is the main thing most people are concerned about in regards to the review.

In regards to the movies: neither are for children.

The Mist is about a man and his son who go to a grocery store, and while there a mist descends upon them and they are unable to leave. They then must find a way to survive what could be lurking outside.

1408 is about an author who goes to a hotel and stays in room 1408, in which many people have died in, to write a story about the history of the room. While there, he encounters things that he thought others were lying about. He must then survive the room for one night.",1392249600,,727,4.2086330935251794
