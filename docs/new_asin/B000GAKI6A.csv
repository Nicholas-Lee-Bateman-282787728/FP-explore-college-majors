8129804,3,B000GAKI6A,"I ordered this to use for Spanish language study, and it would have been great, but the sound quality is so poor that it is has limited usefulness as a language learning tool.  When it was dubbed, the music track was set at a much higher volume than the narration, so you see the animated story and hear the music but the Spanish narration is barely audible.  Additionally, given that these are stories for small kids, the language should be slow and easy to follow, but because the wordy storytelling has to keep up with the animated story, the narrator rattles off the story at a pace too fast for children (or language learners)to keep up with. It is a very worthy project that could have been better executed.  Given the very reasonable price, it still may be of interest to some people.  The 1970's artistic style is unique and interesting.",1330128000,,845,4.576158940397351
