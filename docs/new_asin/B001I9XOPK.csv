3646522,5,B001I9XOPK,"Awesome. Brilliant. Insane. Those are three words that describe the slasher flick 100 Tears. It is possibly the goriest slasher movie ever made. I didn't keep count or anything, but I imagine the body count was about thirty, and nearly all of the deaths occur onscreen. There's many decapitations and amputations, as well as a pretty good script and above average performances from the cast. 100 Tears along with Hatchet, Killer Movie, Midnight Movie, Gutterballs, and the Friday the 13th and My Bloody Valentine reboots are proving that the slasher film isn't just still alive, it's bigger and better than ever.",1236816000,5,612,5.069306930693069
3646523,5,B001I9XOPK,"All clowns are evil. But most are subtle, creepy and menacing, so you can't quite say why they're evil.

Not Gurdy in 100 TEARS. He swings a huge meat cleaver -- a HUGE meat cleaver! -- and racks up a body count faster than you can count his victims.

Two tabloid reporters hunt Gurdy, seeking a story about serial killers. Naturally, these reporters learn more than they'd like to know.

100 TEARS is a throwback to that 1970s, drive-in/grindhouse style of horror. Raw, visceral, graphic gore. The film was shot in Florida (home of supermarket tabloids), which adds to that atmosphere.

3646524,3,B001I9XOPK,"100 TEARS is basically about two tabloid reporters who are searching for a murderous clown. And by murderous clown, I mean he carries around a butcher knife the size of a small child and definitely puts it to good use. He dismembers and decapitates his victims in over the top fashion. The clown also never speaks which is great and spares the viewer the supid one-liners... he lets his butcher knife do the talking. There's also a twist that may or may not be revealed in the trailers for this movie, so I'll just go ahead and say it: the clown (who goes by the name Gurdy the Clown) has an estranged daughter who also happens to be a serial killer. They eventually unite and team up, going on a killing spree before coming face to face with the tabloid reporters.

Basically the movie revolves around the two tabloid reporters Mark and Jen, who also happen to be roommates and BFF (that's best friends forever for all you internet lingo illiterate folk), and their goofy chemistry, and Gurdy the Killer is sort of a background character (you do learn his back story, but for the most part all you know is that he just likes to kill people). But the bottom line is that 100 TEARS is a total gorefest and nothing more. There's nothing deep about the story, the script and acting are God awful (especially Raine Brown who plays Gurdy's daughter), and the outcome of the overall story is pretty anticlimactic. So if gore is what you're looking for then you're going to be in for a treat. There's nothing in the film that's difficult to watch because the gore is so over the top (it's comparable to watching a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/GWAR-video/dp/B000FILVC8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">GWAR video</a>), but you'll be in awe at how much blood is used in the film. People get their arms, legs, feet, and heads cut off... their intestines ripped out of their bodies... you name it. My favorite death scene involves a girl in a wheelchair getting decapitated and then getting pushed down a flight of stairs. Quality-wise, the film is very low quality because it's a super low budget movie, but some parts of the film still look pretty cool. A lot of scenes are very grainy and it creates an overall dirty feel to the movie, specifically Gurdy's scenes.

Overall, 100 TEARS has a lot of cool gore scenes, but other than that I didn't really enjoy anything about it. There was a couple of funny moments, but for the most part it just wasn't a very good movie. The acting was horrible and it wasn't even one of those ""so bad it's good"" things either... it was just annoying. Also the script leaves much to be desired. There's absolutely NOTHING realistic in this movie. The most disappointing thing about this movie is the fact that Gurdy the Clown is not scary. If the filmmakers were trying to take the whole ""fear of clowns"" thing and re-instill it into the minds of whoever's watching this movie, then they failed. Gurdy is more like a serial killer who happens to dress like a clown, as opposed to someone who totally embodies a character that will give you nightmares. The end result of the movie is that it's almost like a cross between&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MURDER-SET-PIECES/dp/B000CDG5MW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MURDER-SET-PIECES</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/HOUSE-OF-1000-CORPSES/dp/B00009MGEM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES</a>, except not nearly as good as either one. 100 TEARS is not a good movie but I've seen a lot worse and I would only recommend this movie to people looking to see a lot of gore.

3646527,5,B001I9XOPK,"Marcus Koch directed and did the special fx for this Joe Davison written clown slasher film starring Raine Brown and others. When you watch this film, you'll understand why say ""Raine Brown and others"" -- Raine's performance of Christine Gleason is so incredibly over-the-top that it pretty well overshadows all but Jack Amos as Gurdy the Clown.

This film features 9 kills in the first 12 minutes of the movie as Gurdy the Clown wreaks havoc and commits mass murder in a random half-way house. And from that point on there are more than enough bloody, gory, violent kills to keep even the most demanding of slasher horror fans from becoming bored.

Joe Davison wrote a fantastic story with a really cool twist, that I will not get into here because the film releases on DVD on the 8th of December here in the United States so I really do not want to ruin this film for you.

Marcus, as the director and creator of special f/x, is genius. The technical aspects of this film, from lighting to camera-work, to the directing of characters and development, to every single kill stand heads and tails above most slasher films to include those put out by mainstream big budget studios.

Buy this film. You'll not be disappointed in Raine or Jack's performance. Another fantastic performance is found in Jeff Dylan Graham's short appearance as one of Gurd'Y's victim. If ultra-violent, gore and blood, and incredibly terrifying clowns are your thing - then you'll absolutely be into 100 TEARS.",1226880000,4,1486,4.79296875

3646529,5,B001I9XOPK,"Attention all splatter enthusiasts, your day of deliverance is at hand! Gurdy the clown (Jack Amos) has arrived in order to cause enough bloody mayhem to drown you! 100 TEARS is the tale of said clown, and his terrible, blood-drenched trail of vengeance! The opening scene alone is worth its weight in entrails! TEARS also stars Raine Brown (HORROR, AUNT ROSE), who has finally redeemed herself after her horrid appearance in the inept floater, WOODS OF EVIL. Here, she shines w/ maniacal glee! I give this one 5 stars for three major reasons. 1- It's obviously limited budget. 2- Gurdy is awesome! 3- Ms. Brown's insane performance. So, if your tastes run toward the gory / funny, and eeevil, murderous clowns are your delight, then 100 TEARS is a surefire hit!...",1285891200,3,765,4.847328244274809
3646530,2,B001I9XOPK,Ok. This has got to be one of the worst slasher films ever. Yes it was gory but unfortunately that is all it delivers. And quite frankly some of the scenes were way overdone to the point that it was just laughable cause it looked so fake. This could've been bearable as there were some cool killings but the production and acting were so bad that it would make a pornography movie look like a masterpiece. I think 100 tears is appropriate for the title because that is how many tears the viewer will shed once he realized what kind of crappy movie they rented. If you want a good slasher film then do yourself a favor and avoid this one at all costs.,1276387200,3,650,4.25

3646532,4,B001I9XOPK,"The micro-budget indie horror scene is wall to wall with movies that get attention strictly for having loads of gore and brutality. But often those movies lack, wit, decently action or even competent staging of those set pieces. So it is mystifying how a movie as well done as 100 TEARS has not garnered a huge cult following in the three years it was made.

The movie is wall to wally gore, but more importantly, that gore is effectively shot and edited to have IMPACT and not just some backyard yoddle with a camcorder and an enema bottle of stage blood. These shock scenes grab you and for for broke like being in a a mini war zone with the killer of the title. Speaking of the killer, a killer clown lends itself to parody but here is played thankfully straigt with now smart ass lines, hell no lines at all. He's a hulking menace, a killing machine turned on by the sight of severed limbs and spurting head stumps.

But also on tap that works better than it has any right to is the main thrust of the story dealing with the best friend duo of tabloid reporters on the case. Their story is often groan inducing cute,. but never so much that you hate them. In fact they end up being fairly well written characters by the end of he movie. Also well written in the twist in the last fifteen minutes that takes the movie into a whole other direction.

This movie is far better than a huge percentage of the much and dreck in the peer group for which it was made. So check it ouf if you like your slasher movies strong and creative.",1270339200,5,1531,4.290657439446367

Somebody please help me find more of this awesome trash because I got such a kick out of this!!!  Yes, within the first five minutes into this flick you will experience crazy, off-the-wall, gore galore almost completely throughout this cheesy masterpiece!  Actually, to tell you the truth, I was exhausted from it all and was able to rest my eyes during the few scenes that didn't contain gore.  Fast pace, too!  The 90 something minutes went by quick! Haha.  The acting is ok.  Not annoying at all.  Again, this flick is made for sake of throwing as much blood in your face as possible.  Being that it is a low-budget flick, the gore is of course, 'Terror Firmer' style. Not like what you'd see in 'SAW' films or any other big-budget gore flick.  That being said, the FX is still impressive and fun to watch.  So let that be a warning for those who aren't into this kind of thing.  '1OO TEARS' goes best with other gems such as: 'BUZZSAW', 'Cannibal Campout', 'Terror Firmer' etc.  I will definitely have this on the playlist for next Halloween!",1266969600,4,1315,4.555555555555555

8310550,1,B001I9XOPK,"<strong>100 Tears</strong> (Marcus Koch, 2007)

Over the course of December, 2011, I watched a total of thirty-one films. For those bad at math, that works out to one movie per day. Of them, <em>100 Tears</em> was the third-worst of the lot, managing to be--barely--better than Richard Linklater's <em>subUrbia</em> and Charles Kaufman's <em>Mother's Day</em>. But ""barely"" is a relative term. I have already spewed vitriol over those two pieces of dung, while <em>100 Tears</em> is still sitting in the review queue waiting for me to find the proper words to give it the review it deserves... so maybe this was the worst of the lot and I just haven't realized it yet. Anything is possible.

Plot: a couple of bumbling Internet journalists, Christine Greason (<em>Sculpture</em> scream queen Raine brown) and Mark Webb (<em>Frost Bite</em>'s Joe Davison, who also wrote the script) (note: I'm pretty sure they were not meant to come across as bumbling), investigate a tale, told very confusingly in the movie's opening scenes, about a circus performer, Gurdy the Clown (<em>Unearthed</em>'s Jack Amos), who was sent to prison years ago for a crime he didn't commit, went crazy inside, and exacted brutal, bloody revenge on those who sent him up when he got out. Now he's on the run from the law, still crazy, and still killing, and both the journalists and a couple of police officers are closing in on him. But the circus community is a tight-knit one indeed.

Marcus Koch is normally a special effects guy (recently on things like <em>Quarantine 2: Terminal</em> and <em>The Theatre Bizarre</em>), and it shows; a good bulk of the film's budget went to the gore effects, and honestly, they were worth it. If only anything else about the movie had been. Davison's script is woefully lacking (or the editing was), leading to the movie, especially the first fifteen or so minutes of it, being incredibly confusing. The acting is about what you'd expect from a microbudget gore film. The sets are about as low-budget as they come, and this effect was not helped by the lighting--some really odd choices made in that department, which makes me wonder if choices were made at all. The cinematography, courtesy one Wesley Wing (his first film work), didn't help much either; he's got a basic idea of where to put a camera, but not much in the way of interesting things to do with it. I'm spending a lot of time on the tech details here because they turn what could have been a relatively entertaining film into something of a slog. Remember the Jim Rose Circus Sideshow episode of the X-Files? Go watch that again instead, it's a much better time. ",1329264000,2,2643,4.892857142857143
