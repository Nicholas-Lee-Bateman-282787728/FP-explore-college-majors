5406634,3,B00AAQKHIO,This is an okay disk. I bought it to try an strengthen my knees for running and it seemed to help a bit. But the exercises are a bit low-key for me and seem aimed for older folks who may not be so mobile (I run 15 to 20 miles per week).,1392163200,2,236,3.5576923076923075
5406635,5,B00AAQKHIO,"Didn't have to take time off work OR pay an arm and leg to learn the same therapeutic exercises.

The moves are simple to follow and its nice to be able to follow a professional AT HOME every time I do the exercises.

For $20 compared to hundreds of dollars saved....definitely worth a try.

Would definitely recommend to all my friends that have knee problems.",1389657600,3,361,4.523076923076923
5406636,5,B00AAQKHIO,"I have spent the last year dealing with ""runners knee""  I put off going to therapy which was a mistake, but luckily came accross this DVD.  I have done the begginer exercises 6 times and already have seen improvement.  It is easy to follow and only takes about 15 minutes to do.  I really wish I had found this dvd a year ago.",1389571200,6,326,4.126984126984127
5406637,5,B00AAQKHIO,"This DVD includes many of the same exercises used by physical therapists for treatment of menisucus tears and knee tracking issues.  Clear instructions, low-key music, no gimmicks, and separate programs for beginners and more advanced users.",1389225600,7,241,5.694444444444445
5406638,5,B00AAQKHIO,I loved this exercise program.  I was in a lot of knee pain and since I did this exercise my knee pain decreased.  I re3commend this to others.,1384560000,9,143,4.071428571428571
5406639,5,B00AAQKHIO,Save $$.  Buy the dvd and fix the problem yourself.  I appreciated the clear instructions and the 3 levels of difficulty so a I could adjust for my specific knee issues. Very professionally done and beats going to many other health professionals who may or may not help.  I would recommend this dvd to anyone who needs to improve knee strength and stability,1383350400,7,357,4.634920634920635
5406640,5,B00AAQKHIO,the perfect combination of education and easy to follow low impact exercises.  this tape has proven to be a life saver and i recommend it to everyone.,1374192000,7,150,4.555555555555555
5406641,5,B00AAQKHIO,I paid thousands of dollars to a physical therapist and he gave me the same exercises that you can find on this DVD.  The key to success will be to follow the exercises and consistently work at improving the strength and stability of the knee joint.  They may look simple but they get the job done!,1366848000,23,298,4.303571428571429
5406642,5,B00AAQKHIO,"This DVD earns a perfect score. Five stars. Not everyone can access the kind of care they need after knee surgery, or injury. The DVD puts an excellent program of rehabilitation at the fingertips of every patient, regardless of ability to pay. If I had gone to one session with my physio-therapist, and then watched the DVD, I could have saved myself hundreds of dollars. My physio did the same things as the instructor on the DVD did, except Dr. Wong comes across as a sports medicine doctor, and the DVD extends and adjusts exercises that my therapist could never have done in the time we had scheduled.
Working through the three levels of knee-strengthening exercises, it becomes evident that this is a DVD for everyone, injured or not.
It is worth mentioning that the instructor and the ""patient"" in the presentation are normal looking, average people, no hype, no reality TV queens.
I would recommend the Vayalux DVD to anyone needing rehab for the knee, and wishing to avoid an endless weekly drain on their bank account.",1364601600,23,1027,4.775280898876405
5406643,4,B00AAQKHIO,"Super cheesy, but exercises seem decent.  I have poor patella tracking, and its pretty painful.  Simple exercises that I had no trouble following.  Definitely felt the work out in my knee.",1363824000,3,188,5.0
8549311,5,B00AAQKHIO,Nice Cd,1470960000,,7,3.0
8549312,1,B00AAQKHIO,Very slow and annoying!,1422316800,,23,5.0
8549313,5,B00AAQKHIO,"I could have saved a lot of time finding the right exercises if I had explored this DVD before reading the three books written by Orthopedic Surgeons and their Physical Therapists.  However, I recognize most of these exercise routines and know their benefit first hand.  Now I will memorize them, and put the books aside!!!

Truly this will gently strengthen every part of your body from the waist down.  Easy to memorize.  Gain a pain free life!

If our health insurance companies knew how helpful this is to relieve lower body pain, they would probably buy it for us!
Just wish they had a man in the DVD too.  It would benefit guys as well as gals.  BEST DVD & info out there.",1421366400,,678,4.455284552845528

8549318,5,B00AAQKHIO,This past January I was diagnosed with a torn meniscus on my knee.  I had physical therapy that cost me a $30 copay per visit.  This video has the same exercises (plus) as I did in physical therapy.  I highly recommend it for anyone with knee problems.  You can do it on your own time in the comfort of your own home.  Very simple exercises.,1397174400,2,341,4.184615384615385
8549319,5,B00AAQKHIO,"This program has helped my weak knees so much.  I'm an older gal and the exercises are not too challenging, but very effective.  Strengthening the muscles from the hip down has been very helpful.  Would recommend this program to anyone troubled with weak knees.",1393113600,6,261,4.886363636363637
8549320,4,B00AAQKHIO,"I have recently been diagnosed with arthritis, and a torn meniscus. It is to the point where I can not enjoy daily activities like golf, and doctors just want to do injections. Along with trying to lose weight, I decided to give this DVD a try and after only a week I am starting to see a difference in my knee. I seem to be able to do more natural movements like twisting, etc which would not be possible before. This is not an aerobic workout. It is slow paced and very deliberate and concentrates more on strength training and proper use of the knee. It also challenges muscles that you do not normally use in day to day functions. I am doing the intermediate now bu the beginner one would even be suitable for an elderly person. I highly recommend this DVD.",1392768000,13,761,4.328671328671328
