995901,2,6305255237,"Hardcore Champion Billy Gunn versus Bob Holly and Al Snow

This was a pretty good way to start the show. It was short, fast paced and fairly exciting. Not the best match on the card, but not bad.

WWF Tag Team Champions Owen Hart and Jeff Jarrett versus Test and D'Lo Brown

Although it is always nostalgic to watch an Owen Hart match, this one was short and uninteresting. The team of Test and D'Lo Brown was thrown together prior to the beginning of Wrestlemania XV and there was little chemistry in the match.

Butterbean versus Bart Gunn

Very quick, this match is known solely for ending Bart Gunn's WWF career. It was a legitimate match and ended after about thirty seconds.

The Big Show versus Mankind

Another very short match, though it was somewhat entertaining. A lame ending ruined the contest.

Intercontinental Champion Road Dogg versus Goldust, Ken Shamrock and Val Venis (Four Corners Match)

This was a pretty good match with four guys who can put on a decent show. It was nicely paced and definitely entertaining. It is one of the best matches on the card, which is a probably since it was not that good.

Kane versus Triple H

Like the Big Show/Mankind match, this one was ruined by a lame ending. Fortunately, it was given more time and both wrestlers looked good. It's worth watching.

Women's Champion Sable versus Tori

There is not much to say here. A short match, typical of women's matches.

European Champion Shane McMahon versus X-Pac

Although Shane McMahon is not a wrestler by trade, this was actually a pretty good match, though it was marred by interference which led to yet another lame ending.

The Big Bossman versus the Undertaker (Hell in a Cell Match)

A pretty dull match as far as Hell in a Cell matches go, though it was one of the better matches of this event. It is better known for the infamous ending which featured the Big Bossman hung from the top of the cell.

WWF Champion the Rock versus Steve Austin

This was a decent main event and probably the best match on the card, but it was definitely the worst of the three Rock/Austin matches are Wrestlemania. The match dragged in the middle and only picked up in the last couple minutes.

All in all, this was a very disappointing Wrestlemania. It featured a decent card but way too many cheap disqualification/interference endings and the rest of the matches were either thrown together too quickly or were way too short. The main event was average, as far as Wrestlemania main events go. There really is no reason to buy this DVD as there is not even one outstanding match.",1174521600,4,2573,4.613186813186813
995902,5,6305255237,"This was a great event for the WWF because it is wrestle mania! and it only comes once a year. They start the show off with boys 2 men singing america the beautiful.

The first match was a great opener, a triple threat hardcore match for the WWF Hardcore Championship, Bily Gunn VS. Al Snow VS. Hardcore Holly, it was a fast paced match and in the end Hardcore Holly became the new champ. 8/10

The next match was a tag-team match for the WWF Tag-Team Championships, it was D'Lo Brown and Test against Owen Hart and Jeff Jarrett. Jeff and Owen pinned D'Lo to retain, it was an ok match. 5/10

After that was the Brawl For All, Butterbean VS. Bart Gunn. Butterbean ended up knocking out Gunn in the first round with a punch to the face. 6/10

Next was The Big Show VS. Mankind, and the winner went on to the main event to be the special referee. The Big Show got himself DQ by chokeslamming Foley through two chairs. Mr. McMahon came out and started yelling at Big Show untill he got fed up and chokeslammed Vince, then Vince pressed charges against Show and made himself the ref because Mick had to go to the hospital. 10/10

The next match was the four corners elimination match for the Intercontinental Championship, The Road Dogg VS. Ken Shamrock VS. Goldust VS. Val Venus. Ken Shamrock and Val Venus got counted out, which left Road Dogg and Goldust, in the end the Road Dogg retained. 7/10

Next was Triple H VS. Kane, Triple H was trying to get Chyna back with DX after she left to go with Kane. Chyna betrayed Kane and cost Triple H the win, but they beat Kane up with a chair anyway. 6/10

After that was the Women's Title match, Sable VS. Tori. Sable pinned Tori to retain. 4/10

Next was the European Championship, the current champion Shane McMahon was defending his title against D-X's own X-Pac. Shane got the mean street possee and Test to interfere, then D-X came out and put the beat down on Shane's interference, then Triple H and Chyna backstabbed D-X and screwed X-Pac out of the title. 8/10

Next was the first ever Hell in a Cell Match at Wrestle Mania, it was The Undertaker VS. The Big Bossman. It was a pretty good match, it wasn't an extreme Hell in a Cell match like everyone is used to, they stayed inside the stucture the entire time, but it was good. Undertaker pinned Bossman becoming 8-0 at Wrestle Mania. at the end The Brood came down from the ceiling and threw a nouse down to Undertaker so that he could hang the Bossman. 10/10

Finally the Main Event it was Austin and The Rock's first confrentation at Wrestle Mania and it was by far the best one. Shawn Michaels told Vince that he couldn't be the ref, so they had Erl Hebner be the referee, who was later knocked out by The Rock giving him a Rock Bottom, the match was brutal They broke the Spanish announce table and they almost brought the staging down when Austin through The Rock into it, in the end Vince came out to help The Rock and then Mick Foley came out to ref, but was then taken out by a chair, and finally Austin hit the Stunner on The Rock and got the 3 count. Mr. McMahon was pissed and wanted Austin to give him the title, but Austin Stunnered him. It was an exciting match and a great end to a great night. 10/10

I would recommend this title to anybody, but I'll warn you there was a glitch on the Wrestle Mnaia 15 DVD's it keeps skipping during the Women's Title Match or it will skip entirely to the European Title Match.",1158105600,3,3430,4.318818040435459

75-78 C - Ok Dvd with some watchable matches, buy if you want

79-82 B - I would consider buying this

82-85 A - Great Dvd nice addition to the Collection

85+ A+ - A must have for any collection

Triple Threat for the Hardcore Championship Billy Gunn vs Hardcore Holly vs Al Snow- I personally thought this was a great way to open the shows. Hardcore contests always get the crowd going. Nice Armdrag I think by Gunn to Snow threw a table in the corner. Then Holly pins Snow for the Victory. Match Rating- 7

Tag Team Titles D'lo Brown & Test vs Jeff Jarret & Owen Hart- This was a ok tag match. Something average like you would see on a very good episode of Raw or SD! D'lo and Test just got done wrestling a battle royal on Heat to see who the tag partners were going to be. Jeff and Owen Retain Match Rating 5.5

Brawl for all press skip

Winner will be refree for the main event Mankind vs Paul Wight- This match was made No Dq but, then the ref disqualified Paul Wight because he could not control him. Mankind gets knocked out by a chokeslam through two chairs. Match Rating 7

Four Corners Elimination match for the IC title Road Dogg vs Goldust vs Val Venis vs Ken Shamrock- This was an ok match but I do not like the concept that you have to tag to get someone else in I like the concept when you have them in the ring at the same time. Val and Ken get counted out. Then Road Dogg wins with the pumphandle slam. Match Rating 6.5

Kane vs HHH- I personally thought these two have great chemistry together. This match is the best so far into the night. Kane gives HHH numerous shots to the outside ring post. Then Chyna comes out acting like she was going to help Kane but then she betrayed Kane by hitting him with a chair. Kane wins by DQ. Match Rating 8.5

Women's title match Tori vs Sable- Skip again

European Title match Shane Mcmahon vs X-pac- This is what I loved about the Euro title they always had great matches and this one did not dissapoint. Shane had numerous factors going for him. He had Test and the Posse at ringside so they helped some. Then here comes HHH to help. Not really this is one of the best Heel turns I have ever seen. Shane retains. Match Rating 8

Hell in a Cell Big Bossman vs Undertaker- This was probably the worst Cell match in the history of the Wwe. Ever thing was very skechty. A lot of people might have been expecting a Mankind and Undertaker match but this is just plain horrible. Undertaker wins. Match Rating 6

No Dq for the Wwe Title Stone Cold vs The Rock- This is the match of the night. It was not as good as Wm 17 match but it was still great. Vince is at ringside which makes things interesting. Austin hit the Stunner but there was no ref so Mankind comes down and makes the count for Austin to become the new Wwe Champion. Match Rating 9.5

995937,3,6305255237,"This wrestlemania may not be one of the best in the 20 year history of wrestlemania, but it's far from the worst.  Some of the matches are paper looked like they were going to be good but ended up being fair or flat out disappointing.  Here's a list of the card and my opinion on them.

- Ratings:  Dud = Horrible;  *= Poor; **=Fair; ***=Good; ****=Excellent; *****=Classic;

1.  Hardcore Title Match:  Hardcore Holly vs Al Snow vs Billy Gunn.  I thought it was strange that the WWE decided to replace road dogg and billy gunn in their originally assigned matches.  The match was very entertaining as it was fast paced.  They used tables, chairs, hockey sticks, and soda cans.  Billy Gunn hit the fameasser on snow but holly hit him with a chair and pins snow for  the win

Rating ***1/2

2.  Tag Team Title Match:  The late Owen Hart and Jeff Jarrett vs Test and D'Lo Brown:  The match was made at the last minute and you can tell by watching it that the participants were not really prepared for it.  Despite poor planning, it was okay.  Test got distracted by Jacqueline and Terri Runnels which left D-Lo alone with the champions and they made short work of D'lo.  Rating *

3.  Boxing match:  Butterbean vs Bart Gunn

Doesn't really need to be rated b/c it wasn't an actual match and not really worth seeing as Bart got knocked out in the 2nd round.

4.  Mankind vs Big Show

Foley was suffering some serious injuries which limited him for what he could do.  However, he does take some sick bumps which kept the match from getting a really bad grade.  The part where he sits on big show to deliver the maniable claw only to have show get up and fall back on him and the ending where he chokeslams Foley in between two chairs makes it a decent match.  Foley wins by DQ and becomes the speical guest referee for the rock vs austin match.

Rating ** 1/4

5.  Four corner elimination match for the IC title.

Goldust vs Road DOgg vs Ken Shamrock vs Val Venis

- Road Dogg seemed to be out of place here as Billy Gunn was the one who had a relationship with Shamrock's sister as well as the other three competitiors.  I don't think this match really displayed all four guys skills that well. It looked more like a main event for Raw type of match.  Shamrock's sister accidentally trips Goldust her current lover which distracted him long enough for Road Dogg to capitalize and win the match.

Rating ** 1/2

6.  HHH vs Kane

-HHH was on the verge of making that run for the heavyweight championship and becoming the GAME.  The match isn't as bad as what people make it out to be.  Granted, it could have been better, but it did turn to be a decent technical wrestling match until Chyna interfered and helped HHH lay into kane with multiple chair shots.  I didn't notcied this until last year, but Teddy Long was the referee for the match.

Rating ***1/4

7.  Tori vs Sable

-Horrible match, the ending with Nicole Bass helping Sable even though she was pretty killing Tori throughout the match.

Rating DUD

8.  X-pac vs Shane McMahon

- Not a great match but it was decent considering it was Shane's first real match and it was full of unnecessary interference.  This was the match that helped HHH makes the successful run as a heel as he betrays X-Pac with a pedigree and placing shane on top of Pac for the win.

Rating ** 1/2

9.  Hell In A Cell Match:  Undertaker Vs The late Boss Man

- a real letdown compared to Taker first two classic cell matches with Foley and HBK.  The only real hardcore moves in the match was taker hitting boss man with a chair and ramming his head into the cell a few times.  Should have been a regular match.  The ending was pretty cool when the brood put a noose around the neck of the boss man and lifted up the cell with him.

Rating: 1/2

10.  Rock vs Austin for the world title

- this match wasn't as good as the other two bouts but it was still good.  It was a brawl that took place all over the arena.  The Rock tried everything to win the match with a rock bottoms, rapid chair shots toward austin's knee and some interference from the boss but Foley evened the odds and austin turned the tide and hits the stunner for the win.

Rating ***

Overall, this show is solid but has no matches that were excellent or classics.  Rock vs Austin was the best matches and two other were good but everything else was average or poor.  Not a must have but it was a decent show.",1109116800,2,4407,4.313725490196078

CHAMPION BILLY GUNN VS. AL SNOW VS. HARDCORE HOLLY

A GOOD HARDCORE MATCH FROM THE EARLY DAYS OF THAT DIVISION. UNLIKE THE LATER HARDCORE TITLE MATCHES, THERE WAS NO 24/7 RULE. SO IF SOMEONE GOT PINNED, THAT WAS IT. A GOOD OPENING MATCH. RATING; 4/5

A GOOD MATCH. THE BEST PART ABOUT IT IS ITS FINALE IN WHICH THE BIG SHOW CHOKESLAMS MANKIND THROUGH 2 FOLDED OUT CHAIRS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RING. SURE, HE GOT DISQUALIFIED, BUT THAT MADE THE MATCH EVEN BETTER. RATING; 4/5

5. FOUR CORNERS MATCH FOR THE WWE INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP

RATING; 1/5

10. FOR THE WWE WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP

CHAMPION THE ROCK VS. STONE COLD STEVE AUSTIN

THE BEST AND MOST MEMORABLE MATCH OF THE NIGHT. A GOOD MATCH WITH PLENTY OF ACTION INSIDE AND OUT OF THE RING. ROCK AND AUSTIN WOULD ALSO CONFRONT EACH OTHER AT WRESTLEMANIA X-SEVEN AND XIX. RATING; 5/5

WMXV breakdown:
Hardcore Championship: Bob ""Hardcore"" Holly's legend begins with him becoming Hardcore Champion.
Tag Team Championship: Test & D'Lo Brown don't see eye-to-eye, and it shows in the match.  Owen Hart & Jeff Jarrett were a solid tag team.
Big Show vs Mankind: Vince has everything in his pocket to prevent Stone Cold from becoming Champion--and Big Show screws it all up by getting himself disqualified.  Show really has a falling out with the Corporation afterwards.
Intercontinental Championship: Solid match, even though Road Dogg retains gold.  James is a much better tag team wrestler than singles, in my opinion, and it shows down the road.
Kane vs Triple H: After tremedous buildup, DX reunites...or so everyone thought.
Women's Championship: Sable was a dominant Women's Champ and it showed at WrestleMania XV.  Is she the dominant female?
European Championship: Great effort by Shane, but match remembered for Triple H & Chyna turning heel, ending DX for 7 months.
Hell in a Cell: Probably the worst Hell in a Cell match ever, especially with Bossman being hung out to dry by the Brood.
Main Event (Rock vs Stone Cold): Match of the Night--Four refs (Mike Chioda, Tim White, Earl Hebner & Mick Foley/Mankind), Vince (and only Vince) at ringside, and the effort by both men made WrestleMania XV.

Hardcore Title: Billy Gunn v.s. Bob Holly v.s. Al Snow
The first Hardcore Title match at WrestleMania. And while it isn't the best hardcore match, it was still good match and a good way to open the show. ***
Tag Team Title: Owen Hart & Jeff Jarrett v.s. D'Lo Brown & Test
This match wasn't too horribly bad but there were a few problems with it. One, the match wasn't even made until minutes before the PPV. On Sunday Night Heat before the show started, there was a battle Royal to determine who would challenge Owen and Jeff for the title and D'Lo and Test were the last remaining men, so they were forced to team up (and they hate each other!) It made for a dull story and the match wasn't anything to really talk about. It is a somewhat historic match though, as it is the late great Owen Hart's last match at WrestleMania. **1/4
Brawl For All: Butterbean v.s. Bart Gunn
It's a boxer versus a wrestler who apparently wants to be a boxer. I can't really rate this match since it is a boxing match on a wrestling show. It was very quick though. Butterbean can really pack a punch.
Mankind v.s. Big Show
This match was to determine who would be the special guest referee for the WWF Title match later in the night. Mankind takes some pretty big bumps in this match (for one, he gets to have the Big Show at at least 500 lbs come crashing down with all his weight ((and I mean ALL)) onto Mankind. Ouch). **3/4 for some of Mick's bumps in the match and a little for the aftermath.
Intercontinental Title: Road Dogg v.s. Ken Shamrock v.s. Val Venis v.s. Goldust
The story here is everyone, except the Intercontinental champion Road Dogg, has had some relationship with Ken Shamrock's beautiful sister, Ryan Shamrock. The match itself wasn't too bad. Shamrock snaps when he's eliminated and cusses quite a bit while pounding the ... out of people. Fun huh? ***
Kane v.s. Triple H
About a month before this, Chyna turned her back on Triple H and D-Generation X to join the Corporation. And while there, she developed a relationship with Kane and HHH wanted revenge. So we get this match, which, sadly, really isn't one of Kane's better matches. Or HHH for that matter. But still, effort was there. **1/2
Women's Title: Sable v.s. Tori
This be Sable's last match at WrestleMania and Tori's first match ever. The story is Tori was a huge Sable fan and Sable was, pretty much, a beesh to her. So we get this... well... bad match. Nothing exciting really happens and the ending is really dumb when Nicole Bass interferes. *3/4
European Title: Shane McMahon v.s. X-Pac
For some reason, this match has always been a favorite of mine. It's one of X-Pac's few really good matches too. Shane pretty much robbed X-Pac of the European title following up to this and mimicked him and his Bronco Buster for weeks, really pissing X-Pac off. Match was one of the best of the night and a truly shocking ending (at least for it's time). ***1/2
Hell In A Cell Match: Undertaker v.s. Big Bossman
This has been dubbed the dud of the Hell In A Cell matches and there is reason for it. It was barely exciting at all. It was two big men in a HIAC match so there really wasn't much you could do with it. Don't know why they didn't make this a normal match but they didn't, so it brought the score and excitement way down. ** (At least we saw the Tombstone).
WWF Title: The Rock v.s. Steve Austin
Ahh finally, the match we've been waiting all night for. Definetly the match of the night as The Rock and Steve Austin gave it their all in the match. Awesome, awesome stuff. ****
While it wasn't the best WrestleMania of all time, it still delivered with good action and a great main event. A worthy entry in anyone's WWF(E) collection.",1035244800,,3878,4.471086036671368

While the Hell in the Cell match is often considered the worst HITC match, I disagree and found it to be the best match of the event, and the ending was real showmanship and true brutality.  Shane O Mac/X-Pac was a good match, I was entertained.  Other highlights of this event were Mankind/Big Show, HHH/Kane, and the four way Intercontinental title match.  And watching the Rock get pinned always makes me smile, even if it is by Stone Cold (4/5 stars).  The worst parts of the event, were BAD!

IC Title Four Way Elimination - Road Dogg vs. Val Venis vs. Shamrock vs. Golddust - This was sort of a swerve much like the Hardcore match.  The story was Billy Gunn, Venis, Goldust were all having [relations] with Shamrock's sister, Ryan.  He was not amused.  It would have made sense to have Gunn in this match, so it didn't happen.  Road Dogg was a recent Hardcore champ so he gets put in here just to shock us.  The match is okay because there are enough people not to have anyone stall.  **
Brawl for All - Bart Gunn vs. Butterbean - Bart Gunn had a rep as a toughman until this match.  This was a ""shoot"" so I won't rate it.
Triple H vs. Kane - Chyna turned on Triple H and joined the Corporation.  Kane was a reluctant member of the Corporation but formed a bond with Chyna.  This is pretty bad, especially when you consider how far these guys have come in the last few years. *
Women's Match - Sable vs. Tori - Tori was Sable's stalker at this point.  Bad, bad, horrible.  -***
Hell in a Cell - Undertaker vs. Bossman - This isn't nearly as good as the previous match.  Both guys were heels at this point and not very good wrestlers so the crowed is absolutely gone.  This is the worst Hell in a Cell ever and one of the worst Wrestlemania matches ever. - ****
Shane McMahon vs. X-Pac - Everyone though Shane would get his comeuppance here.  That's one thing Russo has going for him.  I never thought I'd see this.
WWF Title - Rock vs. Stone Cold - The one redeeming thing about this PPV.  Austin brought with him to the main event a sort of All-Japan style psychology where you go for your finisher only to have it blocked and countered to the opponent's finisher.  That happened in 1998 and it happens here.  This is a pretty good match but not as good as Backlash 1999 or Wrestlemania X-7. ****
In the End: One of the worst PPV's in a time when they managed to make at least something one thing interesting.  Austin vs. Rock is good, but not good enough to justify buying this PPV.  Look for the match on a Rock or Austin best of DVD.",1017792000,2,2879,4.244485294117647
995996,4,6305255237,"I love the WWF and most particularly Stone Cold and the Rock. Wrestlemania is the Super Bowl of professional wrestling and this star-studded event invigorates crowds every year and this year was no exception. You have to understand that professional wrestlers are simply actors doing their own stunts;that's all it is;just like on TV and in the theaters. Outstanding acting, superb matches, stunning beauties, and a great rendition of ""America, the Beautiful"" by Grammy-award winning artists Boyz II Men make this wrestling classic one for the ages. The down side is that Triple H begins his descent to the dark side after betraying DX and the Big Show was not the referee for the main event, which, by the way, is one of the best I've ever seen on a wrestling show...period.",1012780800,,775,4.878787878787879
995997,3,6305255237,"WWF put on a decent show but this is Wrestlemania and it should have been a GREAT show.
Some wrestlers didn't have the Wrestlemania spirit and some did.
The opener was a triple threat hardcore match, Billy Gunn, Al Snow and Hardcore Holly could have done abit more but it was an average opener.
The tag team match was what you would expect and was sadly Owens last Wrestlemania match.
The I.C. Title match wasn't to bad but could have also been better.
HHH vs Kane is a hard fought match and deserves to be one of the nights best, these 2 had the WRESTLEMANIA spirit.
The most dissapionting match of the night was shockingly the Hell in a cell match with the Undertaker vs Bossman. They could have given Taker a better opponent for a Hell in a cell match, all these 2 men do is brawl in the corner which lives a big fat DUD.
Shane Mcmahon took on X-pac in a surprising bout as Shane showed off his in ring ability,another hard fough match which is  also one of the nights best.
Now this next match, the main event showcased a classic bout  between Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Rock as these two stars had the spirit and performed brillaintly out side and in the ring which kept fans on the edge of this seat, also i have to say i give credit for the ref who took a nice chair shot.
This was the show stealer as it should be because this is WRESTLEMANIA.
All in all if you are a big WWF fan you should have already seen this, if not i suggest you order it now. Although there ae beter WRESTLEMANIA's such as WRESTLEMANIA 14 and WRESTLEMANIA 17 and i strongly suggest you to have a glimpse at them two strong events!",1007856000,,1617,4.229773462783172

996004,5,6305255237,"When I first saw Wrestlemania XV, I was not too crazy about the actual card itself. Don't get me wrong; some of the matches were excellent (HHH vs. Kane, The I-C Title match, X-Pac vs. Shane McMahon, Rock vs. Austin),  but some of the other matches left a bit to be desired (The Sable/Tori  match was a complete waste, The Hell in the Cell Match was surprisingly  bad, Test/ D'Lo Brown vs. Jeff Jarrett & the late, great Owen Hart was  boring, and what the hell was this ""Brawl for All""  garbage? ). However, although the event missed many opportunities to be  the greatest Wrestlemania ever, the WWF did not miss the opportunity to put  out an excellent DVD. The picture is clear, with some noticeable artifacts  in some spots; these however are very minor & do not detract from the  overall presentation. the sound has been remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1,  and to say that the WWF outdid itself is an understatement. The soundstage  is deep and the crowd & ambient noises wrap around nicely, bringing you  right into the action. You literally hear the crowd all around you. The  only flaw I found with the soundtrack was that for some reason, when the  referee would make a count, the bass would suddenly fall out. I realize  that the sound of the ref's hand striking the mat is not going to produce  the same impact as the sound of a 275 lb. body hitting the mat, but to  totally eliminate the bass is strange and is a major flaw (although a minor  annoyance). Hopefully the WWF will rectify this in their future DVD  releases. Needless to say, to slap a 5.1 soundtrack on the disc shows that  the WWF is committed to bringing the best possible product into the hands  (and homes) of their fans. The disc is also loaded with extras like  wrestler biographies, a Wrestlemania music video, footage from the  Wrestlemania Rage party, and two bonus audio tracks: The main event called  on one track by Jim Ross & The Rock, and a second track with JR &  Stone Cold Steve Austin. Great extra, undermined by the fact that Rocky  & The Rattlesnake stay in character throughout the entire comentary,  missing opportunities to lend some deep insight into the match. However,  the fact that there are 2 bonus commentary tracks, along with the other  extras, the better than average picture and breathtaking 5.1 soundtrack  makes this DVD a must for any true wrestling fan!",958176000,2,2365,4.601918465227818

This said, the actual program on the DVD is good;  however, the technical aspects are fairly poor.  The  video clarity isn't anywhere near what the DVD format is capable of, and  there are line crawls and picture distortion almost everywhere you look.

996062,4,6305255237,"This DVD was a fantastic entry for the WWF into the DVD market.  Most wrestling videos just give the replay of the entire event with a few extra behind the scenes thrown in, but this DVD packs much more then that.
It  has quick biographies and photos of all the wrestlers who participated in  the event (and even a few who didn't) as well as showing the entire event  in high quality footage.  The ability to just chapter skip to whatever  match you whish to see is incredibly conveninet.  Especially when compared  to fast forewarding video tapes and wondering exactly where the match  actually took place on the card.
In addition to being able to watch just  a single match, or the whole un-interrupted event, there is a special  section on the DVD which show the build up to the main matches on the PPV.  You can see interviews and footage from RAW's which actually show how the  match was built up.
The DVD is headlined by an electric performance by  Stone Cold and the Rock.  A fantastic hard core title match with one of the  first wrestling debut's of Shane McMahon.  The matches flow smoothly and  delivered on some high action spots as well.  The performance from everyone  involved was top notch as you would expect from such an important wrestling  event.  The only match that didn't live up to the hype was the Big Bossman  Vs. Undertaker Hell In A Cell match.  Perhaps a bad gimic for both  wrestlers to pull off together.
If you are a wrestling fan at all,  watching wrestling on DVD is 100% more satisfying than video tapes.  The  WWF choose this PPV as their entry into the DVD market for good reason,  it's matches, for the most part are crisp and awe inspiring.

996064,3,6305255237,"This ppv certainly does not live up to the WrestleMania legacy. Here are some reasons why: 1.) Most of the matches had absolutly no hype to them they were thrown together at the last minute (Test/Dlo vs. Jarret/Hart, or  HHH vs. Kane, or Bossman vs. Undertaker) It seemed like most of the matches  were named a week or two before the event. 2.) Most of the matches were  lackluster: the Hell in a Cell was the worst one of all time, including the  ones on Raw. Not to mention the hardcore bout.  3.) Austin in the main  event? Although he may be that popular he certainly can't put on a good  show, the rock had to carry this one. And who wasn't sick of having Austin  Main Event the last 23 out of 26 ppv's. Of course it was not all bad the  brawl for all was fun to watch Bart Gunn get knocked out and never show is  face in the WWF again. The Main Event was ok just so damn predictable. and  the x-pac shane match was good.  But watching these newer ppv's just makes  me wish they would start selling some ppv's from 95-97 before WWF Home  Video published them (Colesium went out of business) now if you want to  watch some good ppvs that aren't just slapped together an hour before they  go on then you should rent these.

Jeff and Owen retain with Jarrett pinning D'Lo while Test was on the outside arguing with Debra and Ivory. Sad to say, this was Owen's last Wrestlemania as he was living in his last says right before the tragedy that'd happen just a couple months later.

3.) Brawl For All: Bart Gunn vs Butterbean

Idk what possessed Vince McMahon to do the Brawl For All to start with. Many people never seemed too invested in these boxing matches...but Vince was. There's a pre-match video as Gunns trainers predict he will beat Butterbean in the first, and second and the like. Gorilla Monsoon is then introduced as a judge, making his final Mania apperance. The fight beginsand its over. Butterbean wins by knockout at 0:35. I think the WWF learned there lesson here as this was the last Brawl For All match to happen. Brawl For All is still extincted and Bart Gunn is still knocked out by Butterbean

4.) Big Show vs Mankind - Winner Referees the Stone Cold vs The Rock Main Event

The reason for this match happening was stupid in every way. Two people fighting to be named special referee in the main event?? Because it's such an honor, right? A slow-short back and forth match that ends with Mankind getting a DQ victory after Big Show Chokeslammed Mankind through 2 steel chairs. A pissed off Vince McMahon comes out and insults Big Show for ruining the plan that was supposed to benefit him (McMahon) in the main event. Vince slaps Show and Show knocks out Vince. Horrible match with a mediocre storyline. But then again, Vince Russo was writing the stories at the time so it's no shock as to why it was mediocre

5.) Four Corners Elimination WWF Intercontinental Championship Match: Road Dogg (c) vs Val Venis vs Ken Shamrock vs Goldust w/The Blue Meanie and Ryan Shamrock

Not too much of a bad match. A nice way to get some of the midcarders a spot on the Wrestlemania card but man oh man is Ryan Shamrock a sight for sore eyes! All 4 men were grapplers so there's a lot of decent grappling action going on throughout the match. Apparently, Jerry Lawler thinks Blue Meanie is an idiot, as we hilariously hear him call him dozens of times throughout the match. Road Dogg and Goldust are the final two in the match. Ryan accidentally distracts Goldust, which allows Road Dogg to hit Goldust with a unique move for the win to retain the title. After the match, Goldust severely scolds poor Ryan Shamrock

6.) Kane vs Triple H

As Kane made his way to the ring, the San Diego chicken mascot attacked Kane but failed. The person under the costume turned out to be Pete Rose who was trying to get some revenge for the Tombstone he suffered from Kane at the previous year's Wrestlemania. Unfortunately for Pete, he got Tombstoned again. On to the match! Kane and HHH had, had better matches prior to Mania and this was one of the worst. Things started out at a normal pace but mid-way though it slowed down became painful to watch. Philly almost fell asleep. Thankfully we had another Russo swerve at the end to make things seem semi-worthwhile. Must be seen to be believed.

7.) WWF Women's Championship Match: Sable (c) vs Tori

This match was just horrible. In fact, it'd probably explain why there weren't many diva matches at Wrestlemania afterwards. Tori was wearing some hideous bodysuit that looked like Giant Gonzalez and Tony the Tiger got mixed together. Sloppy match. Nicole Bass makes her WWF debut and helps Sable win the match. Next!

8.) WWF European Championship Match: Shane McMahon (c) w/Test vs X-Pac

This match featured a nice display of athleticism. Shane McMahon was just beginning his in-ring WWF career and he surprisingly impressed in the ring. Just as X-Pac looked to have the match won, part 2 of Vince Russo's swerves came in when Triple H came to the ring and turned on X-Pac with a Pedigree and Shane pinned X-Pac to retain the title. All while Chyna distracted the referee. Shane, Test, Triple H, and Chyna all attack X-Pac following the match. The New Age Outlaws try to jump in and save X-Pac but they get beat down too. Kane comes back out and goes right after Triple H and Chyna, chasing them to the back

9.) Hell In A Cell Match: Big Bossman vs The Undertaker w/Paul Bearer

Another disaster of a match. The build-up leading to this match was astonishing but unfortunately the match itself did not deliver. Both Bossman and Undertaker were heel in this match but Undertaker still got cheered from fans, most likely due to the respect they had for him. The match moved way too slow and this match was filled with nothing but a barrage of punches and kicks. Nothing else. Talk about a snoozefest. Taker puts Bossman away in the end with a Tombstone to go 8-0 at Wrestlemania. This was just as bad as Undertaker's match with Giant Gonzalez at Wrestlemania 9. What happened after the match is something that's still etched in my mind to this day. Following the bout, Undertaker with the assistance of The Brood and Paul Bearer, hung Big Bossman from the cell. Watching that as a kid, sent chills down my spine and literally scared the heck out of me. I was scared to go to bed that night. Horrendous match with a jaw dropping post-match scene

10.) WWF Championship Match: The Rock (c) vs Stone Cold Steve Austin

This was the first of the 3 Stone Cold vs The Rock matches to happen at Wrestlemania and it was probably the least exciting of the 3. Now I'm not saying this match isn't good but if you compare it to their other 2 matches, it can't compete. Before the match, Commissioner Michaels came out and told Vince McMahon he would not be the special referee (Earl Hebner was) and ordered that no members of The Corporation interfere in the match. J.R. also thankfully replaced Michael Cole on commentary to call the main event. The match was great in all aspects and was probably the best one of the night. Stone Cold and The Rock had a great chemistry with each other and it really showed in this match, making it exciting to watch along with King and J.R's commentary. Vince comes to the ring to try and prevent Stone Cold from winning but Mankind returns to the arena and lays Vince out. Through it all, Stone Cold manages to hit the Stunner on The Rock to win 3rd WWF Championship and Vince's face was priceless

Overall: This wasn't exactly the best Wrestlemania to end the 1990s. It was mostly filled with boring or mediocre matches with only 2 or 3 really being worth the watch. It was a fine example of having great build-up but not being able to deliver with matches on the PPV.",1395878400,,8143,4.80945558739255

1. Billy Gunn(c) vs Hardcore Holly vs Al Snow Hardcore Title: This was a last minute edition to the card, wasn't very good, because they 2 of them are not hardcore specialists, some missed spots and I was waiting for something to happen but it never did **

2. Owen Hart/Jeff Jarret vs D'lo Brown/Test WWF Tag Team Titles: This should of been on raw, a quick 5 minute match that didn't mean anything, not very good but not all that bad *3/4

3. Bart Gunn vs Butterbean Brawl For All: I don't think that it is fair to give this match a rating, I will say that bart takes a jaw breaking punh from butterbean N/A

4. Big Show vs Mick Foley: This was horrendous, the winner would ref the main event, the match is stupid and the ending is stupid, I don't want to waste my time on this match 3/4*

5. Road Dogg(c)vs Val Venis vs Goldust vs Kem Shamrock 4 corners elimination match IC Title: This was a good solid match, and suprisingly one of the best on the show, it had some good power moves, it seemed like these guys put there all into this one ***

6. Triple H vs Kane: This wasn't a good match at all, very dissapointing, was hard to get in to and had a screwjob ending, I didn't enjoy this one at all *3/4

7. Shane Mcmahon(c) vs X-Pac European Title: This was good, had good storyline telling and was fast paced, they made it easy to watch and had a good biuld up heading into the match ***

8. Undertaker vs Big Boss Man Hell in a cell match: This was the worst hell in a cell match ever, this dragged on and was very boring, match picked up towards the ending, I might be overatting this match but i liked the build up and hype towards this match **

9. The Rock(c) vs Steve Austin WWF Title No Dq: Match of the night by a mile, but still was the worst of there series, loved the fast paced offense and was a great great match to watch, another classic between these two ****1/4

The World tag team title match between the team of Jeff Jarrett & Owen Hart against the team of D-Lo Brown & Test was short but sweet. The Brawl For All boxing match between Butterbean & Bart Gunn was crud to the 10th power. The Mankind-Big Show match was so-so with a cruddy ending. The 4 corners elimination match for the IC title was pretty good for a 4 corners match. The HHH-Kane match was a hard-hitting brawl with a lousy DQ ending. The European title match between Shane McMahon & X-Pac was a fun & entertaining bout with a twist that you have to see to belive. The Hell In A Cell match between The Undertaker & The Big Boss Man was a sloppy but solid brawl. The No-DQ match for the World title between The Rock & Steve Austin was a fun,entertaining,hard-hitting,hardcore streetfight. I give this PPV a 7 out of 10.",1279584000,,960,4.30939226519337
7885921,2,6305255237,"Wrestlemania 15 was very awful. Only about 3 matches are watching and that is including the WWE title match. It had a good opener but the ppv didn't give much after that. Very poor ppv put together.

1. Hardcore Championship
Billy Gunn vs. Al Snow vs. Hardcore Holly
This was actually a good match up to start things off. It was very high energitic. It progressed at a good pace and their were some interesting weapons brought into the match. Holly takes a hard chair shot to the head from Gunn. there was a nice table crash too. Snow added some comedy to the match as well. pretty good opener to say the most. 3.5/5

2. WWE Tag Team Championship
Test & D Lo Brown w/ Ivory vs. Jeff Jarrett & Owen Hart w/ Debra
Pretty decent tag match here. Some nice tag team moves and some good counters but it ended so soon. about 7 or 8 minutes at the most in length. average match. 2.5/5

3. Brawl for All Boxing Match
Butterbean vs. Bart Gunn
Vince tryed so hard to get us to believe that Gunn was actually a prime boxer but to me he didn't showed me $h!* in this match. Very stupid a55 segment right here. I belive Butterbean took it easy too. Buttermean knock Bart's a55 out in the first 30 seconds, HAHA. 0.5/5

4. Big Show vs. Mankind
This match was here to declare the special referee in the main event. It had some decent physicality. Some hard shots as well but this wasn't wrestlemania material. this could have been saved for raw. The after match slap added more to the match. 3/5

5. Fatal Four Way for the Intercontinental Championship
Road Dogg vs. Goldust vs. Val Venis vs. Ken Shamrock
I didn't get the style of this match. The match more resemble of a tag match than a fatal four way. You had to tag to enter the match. One of the best match on the card though. Some good wrestling and some good high risk too. Pretty cool reversals as well. Had a pretty good ending. 3.5/5

6. Triple H vs. Kane
Before the match got underway, Pete Rose gets tombstone once again by Kane. Pretty better than decent match. Some good outside brawling. Some good in ring work as well. Chyna would come to ringside and introduce the steel steps to the match. The dq really hurt the match rating a lot to me. It could have got a higher rating if it had a better ending. Triple H pedigrees Kane onto a steel chair though. 3.5/5

7. Women's Championship
Sable vs. Tori
This was a pretty boring womens match up to me and Sable nor Tori are good women wrestlers by any means. Boring as hell to me. 1/5

8. European Championship
Shane McMahon w/ Test vs. X-Pac
This was to believe it or not probably the second best match of the night. Shane really proved himself in this match. Shane & X-Pac even whip each other with a leather belt in this one. A lot of interference from Test but it didn't really hurt the match. Some nice aerial moves and some good counters. Pretty good match. Triple H & Chyna would eventually turn their back on D-Generation X in this one. 4/5

9. Hell in the Cell Match
Undertaker w/ Paul Bearer vs. Big Bossman
This is defiantly the worst Hell in the cell match of all time. No real hell in the cell violence happening whatsoever. You even forget that this match was a Hell in the Cell match at times. A real disappointment right here. Lousy hell in the cell match. 2/5

10. WWE Championship
The Rock vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin
This match was defiantly the match of the night but itself wasn't 5 stars to me. They added the no dq rule to the match which did added more to it. Pretty good match. Some good brawling on the outside and a good table spot. Good main event but this wasn't even good enough to buy this ppv. A nice ending to a very poor wrestlemania. 4.5/5

Like I said, this was to me the third worst wrestlemania of all time. Very boring matches and not good whatsover. If you're a collector of wrestlemania's get it but other than that don't even worry about this one unless you buy the anthology sets.",1217721600,,3919,4.296747967479675
7885922,2,6305255237,"I decided to go back and watch this event again to see if it was as bad as I remebered it too be. To my surprise it wasn't bad but far from being great.

Hardcore Champion Billy Gunn VS Bob Holly VS Al Snow: One of my favorite divisions in WWF/WWE history. It gave many midcarders a chance to shine and even gave former world champions (Jericho, Kane, Undertaker, Big Show) something to do. This was a pretty good way to kick off the PPV as Holly ends up winning the belt.

WWF Tag Team Champions Owen Hart and Jeff Jarrett VS Test and D'Lo Brown: Brown-Test fought on Heat and now they are tag team partners? Whatever. Brown and Test coudlnt get along and lose in a borning match.

Butterbean VS Bart Gunn: Skipped over it

The Big Show VS Mankind: For a WrestleMania event, they treated alot of matches like they could have been saved for Raw. This was one of them. Mankind-Show brawl with weapons but Show chokeslams Mankind thru two chairs, which was botched and not as cool as you'd think, and he gets disqualified. McMahon yells at Show, who teases a chokeslam but he doesnt do it. McMahon slaps show and he punches him out.

Intercontinental Champion Road Dogg VS Goldust VS Ken Shamrock VS Val Venis: I thought i'd like the match but I thought it sucked. Shamrock and Venis get counted out but I can barely recall the ref even counting to ten. Road Doggs retains in the end and acts like he just won the world title.

Kane versus Triple H: It was good then Chyna turns on Kane and they beat him with a chair. Same as Big Show-Mankind, started good but ending with a cheap finish.

Women's Champion Sable VS Tori: I never watch women wrestling

European Champion Shane McMahon VS X-Pac: Like Kane VS HHH and Mankind VS Big Show, a good match with a stupid ending.

The Big Bossman VS Undertaker in a Hell in a Cell: You think Oh cool, Hell in a Cell. Wrong. For these two wrestlers they could have done alot better but the match was alright but nothing like other Hell in a Cell matches out there. It lasted a mere 15 minutes. Anther thing i've noticed is Bossman matches starts strong but end up going into the crapper towards the end. Im sure alot of people remember the aftermath of this match.

WWF Champion the Rock VS Steve Austin: These two headlined a few WrestleMania's afterwards but I don't think one of the matches didn't have outside interference in it. A very good match with Austin winning the title as Vince looked on in disbelief.

With all the talent WWE had at the time and for being the biggest show of the year, you could barely tell. Austin-Rock was the only good match worth watching while the rest of the stuff was watchable but nothing to go out of your way for. Not as Bad as WrestleMania 2 or 93 from Ceasars Palace.",1195948800,,2750,4.362035225048924
