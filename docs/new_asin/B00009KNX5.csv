1883392,5,B00009KNX5,"For one who got hooked on the TV show Wind at my Back, this movie provides the perfect closure. It is a sweet story that touches on the  historical events of the times without becoming melodramatic. It provides a glimpse of what life was like during those trying days previous to WWII, foretelling the cruel events that would unfold in short order. It was great to see the grown-up version of the children. I miss seeing Grace and Mrs. Bailey though. Too bad they weren't part of the cast. In summary, a great movie, a good story that should become part of the Christmas family viewing tradition.",1288569600,14,596,4.570093457943925
1883393,1,B00009KNX5,"No May Bailey, no Grace Bailey and a substitute Honey. Why did they even bother?This movie is the equivalent of a really bland afterschool special. I bought this dvd based upon how superb the series had been. I wish I had my money back. If you like the ""Wind At My Back"" series then PLEASE don't watch this because there's something missing.....(most of the original cast).",1261699200,6,373,4.666666666666667
1883394,2,B00009KNX5,Little disappointed with this DVD as some of the characters weren't in it and one of the main characters has been replaced.  Not quite the same!,1252108800,,144,4.538461538461538
1883395,5,B00009KNX5,"This is the ""wrap up"" of the wonderful Canadian period (Depression Era) dramatic television series ""Wind at My Back,"" which to my knowledge has never been shown in the US and is probably some of the best ""fun for all ages, family-friendly""  TV ... EVER.  This Christmas episode answers the questions that were cliffhangers when the series was unexpectedly axed by clearly stupid people who didn't know a fantastic product when they saw one.

The Christmas episode looks like they took plotlines from scripts (which probably would have been fantastic if they'd been produced) from the cancelled season and used them as a basis for this effort.  There's an awful lot going on in a very short time in this production.

 We also don't get to see the tough-as-nails May Bailey character (played brilliantly by Keifer Sutherland's mother/Donald's ex-wife--she's far and away the best actor in that family) or the wonderful nurse character they added in the final season in this production, and it's weaker for that.

If Sullivan Entertainment could resurrect this series, and syndicate it outside Canada, they could make money hand over fist and could retire the franchise of endless ""Anne of Green Gables"" retreads to earn their daily bread.

It's a brilliant series, with superb actors, fantastic costumes, great scripts, and compelling plotlines, and it's appropriate for all ages.

I can't recommend it highly enough.

If you do decide to get this Christmas episode, though, you'd better have seen all five seasons that preceded it--otherwise, you won't have a clue what's going on and you'll not be happy at all.

Last but not least, you get a better deal from AMAZON on this episode than you do from SULLIVAN ENTERTAINMENT (at least as of this writing).  SULLIVAN charges a usurious shipping charge, far exceeding Amazon's.  The smart buyer will bundle this up with a few other items and get the SUPER SAVER shipping.",1234224000,67,1917,5.009463722397476
1883396,5,B00009KNX5,"I had considered getting the series about 6 months ago but it was a little pricey, when looking for a few Christmas movies I hadn't seen I thought I'd try this out and it would be a cheaper way to preview the series than buying season one.  I loved the movie...great characters, gives a great feeling of the good parts of that era and a small glimpse at the horrible fear that came with reign of Hitler (a glance into the minds of those who feared him and those who thought he was just a crazy leader who would never have the power to be a danger to the world-those who were afraid to get involved, and those who risked thier lives to help a Jewish girl escape a Canadian deportation order.

Yet it was still an incredibly uplifting, family movie. People of all faiths should watch this movie to remind us all how dangerous it is to assume that the leader of a country who wants an entire population to die could not have the power to enact his vile plan.  If enough people fear him and enough people ignore him because he is apparently not a danger to anyone, horrendous things can happen.

A really terrific movie about the spirit of Christmas.",1227657600,19,1146,4.341121495327103
1883397,4,B00009KNX5,"I loved the ""Wind at My Back"" series and was eager to see this ""sequel.""  Also the plot of the story interested me.  I loved Hub's new girlfriend Anna and I thought that the boys turned out very handsome.  I really want Hub to get together with Anna rather than Maisie who was always a little hooligan, but given the differences in their faiths, they may not be able to.  I would really like another episode to this story.

Since I only watched two seasons of the five season series, I don't understand everything about the characters and their situations in THIS movie.  For instance, Toppy is back, but where is her husband Bob and her daughter Doris?  Toppy mentions that they have grown apart, but I would like to know more.  Another Character missing is Max's brother, Del Sutton.  At the end of season 2, it looks as if he and Grace will make a match of it, but Grace writes in here about someone named Van being her husband and his being killed or missing in the Spanish Civil War. Just who did Grace marry, and what happened to Del?  I assume that Mrs. Mae Bailey married Maisie McGinty's grandfather; why else would Maisie be staying with Toppy at the Bailey house, but what happened to the Bailey mine that went under at the end of season 2?  They need to get Season 3 on DVD pronto!

The only thing that really disappointed me about this movie was the character of Honey Bailey.  The actress portraying her here is so glum looking, always scowling compared to Cynthia Belleveau's Honey.  And she acts totally out of character, wanting desperately for Hub to join the priesthood.  She acts a good deal like Mae Bailey did in the series, wanting to have a say in the boys' careers and disliking a girl because of her faith.  I would think she would sympathize with Anna; after all, Honey was looked down on by the Baileys for being Catholic!  Toppy, always the snob in the series, was the liberal-minded one here.  Because of these inconsistancies, I deduct a star.  Still an enjoyable movie.  Bring on Season 3 of ""Wind at My Back!""",1143763200,4,2042,4.482384823848238

I had to give it 4 stars because if you've watched the entire series, you need some sense of closure and I suppose this is it. It's always sad when a series like Avonlea of Wind at My Back gets dropped suddenly.  Mother Bailey and Grace and both absent from this movie although there are ""letters"" from them to explain why.

We miss Mother Bailey and Grace who are in Europe trying to claim and bring home the body of Grace's dead husband killed in pre-WWII Europe. They never make it home for Christmas, but the other cast of characters are there.

The characters have grown and have learned important things about themselves and their beliefs -- about what they're willing to do and fight for. All the adventure settles around being home for Christmas, but when a life is at stake, Hub is unafraid and brings the fellow student home. The friend is a young womanYou come to find out she is not from Austria as claimed, but is, instead, a Jew in Canada without proper papers. A RCMP Officer is after her to deport her out of Canada.

1883425,5,B00009KNX5,"We first discovered and saw some episodes of Wind... on BYU tv, including what is on this disc. When BYU started the series again, we watched every episode. They did not finish with what is on this disc, and responded to an inquiry by saying they had shown all episodes. So we ordered this disc and if you're a fan of Wind..., it's great. Not superb, because there are some loose ends and indications of more to come. It does, however, bring to  completion most of the story lines that leave you hanging after the last ""official?"" episode. There is probably a story to the making of this disc, but we don't know what it is; I've not been able to find any information. If you can find the disc, it is very much worth having.",1343433600,2,723,4.3161764705882355

We were disappointed that Grandmother May Bailey and Grace were in Europe during the story, but as usual, the plot was entertaining and the character development was well done.  We wish the series could go on forever.  They just don't make such family friendly, well-made television shows these days.",1325462400,2,394,4.850746268656716
1883430,3,B00009KNX5,"If you are not very familiar with the series, this movie still works as a mildly interesting romantic drama about a teenager in love and trying to decide his future, with World War 2 events and aftermath swirling in the background and seemingly earth shattering dilemmas facing him at every turn.

This particular finale had to work hard to tie up the series loose ends and was crippled by not having the actors portraying Grace and Grandmother Bailey available. The producers regretably chose to rely too much on the Hub romance narrative (would have fit better as regular season episode storyline), but still, scripted television seldom comes anywhere near the excellence of the Wind at My Back.

The series had evolved over the years to center on the Grace and Hub characters (rather than the Honey and Ma Bailey characters at its start) and wisely so in my opinion, so this is an unsatisfying conclusion with 80 percent of the focus on Hub and his new flame, zero on Grace, and the rest dribbled out to other characters.

Generous screen time to many town characters was a part of the series' success and that was missed here (would have been great to see the futures for Jim and Pritchard Flett, the hotel proprietors, Alice, Del, Ollie, Archie and others spelled out more satisfyingly). These shortcomings were probably the result of budget and scheduling constraints. But this movie retains enough of the charms of the original series to be enjoyed by long time fans as well as those who never saw the series.",1323734400,7,1516,4.778625954198473

Mrs Bailey and Grace were missing.....two very big pieces of this series.  Toppy never had an ending with Archie....and practically the whole 90 minutes was about Hub and the Jewish girl.....I think the authors could have come up with a better story line to weave it so that the characters we had gotten to know so well were finally where we could take a deep breath and know that it was finished.  Ollie and Margery's adopting Alice's baby, Del? it was bad enough that Grace ran off with Van....but the ending could have been a little better....he runs off to war and the Christmas movie he is dead and she is off scouring Europe .....definitely could have done better...and Mrs. Bailey????....How could you have a movie without her?.....the ""stuff that made it so real""?.....Jim Flet and Pritchard....not even a sign of them and if he ever got together with the sports coach....I mean ...there was so much potential...with 5 seasons of such great characters, and themes, wonderful situations .....I think you could have done better.

Hub really went out on a ""limb"" to assist and befriend her despite what his mother thought. In doing so he realized that he could help people in other ways than to become a priest.

The picture was disappointing in that it was used to tie up the loose ends from the series Wind At My Back. But not seeing Grace or Mae Bailey was a real let down. This picture made me want to ask the producers....what happened to the rest of the series?",1303516800,,554,4.276190476190476
1883436,4,B00009KNX5,"While I liked the movie, I was disappointed in it.  No May Bailey.  Grace was mentioned and ""appeared"" for all of about ten seconds.  No Miss Bascome.  No anybody else but for Hub, Fat, Honey, Max, Violet, Zach, Maisy, and Toppy.  And Jim Flett (who wasn't on much at all).  All the other town characters were AWOL.

So instead of an ensemble piece with the families and the town, we mostly got Hub and a new girl Hub was involved with.  As well as a main storyline that had nothing to do with the show -- or any of the characters in it (with the exception of Hub).

I had expected a wrap-up of a series to... you know... wrap the series up.  Instead, we jumped ahead two years or so.  (Trying to keep spoiler-free here...) Fat suddenly wants to start a career I don't remember his having previously expressed an interest in.  Maisy's career choice has apparently fallen by the wayside -- which makes no sense given the fact that May Bailey should have been able to help her achieve her goal.  May is suddenly well enough to go gallivanting around Europe.  Toppy's life seems not to have changed a bit.  And the main storyline I had hoped to see dealt with got a bare mention (and left me quite dissatisfied!).

It was nice seeing some of the gang at least.  And the storyline was fine -- for what it was.  (Did I mention it mostly revolved around Hub?) So I give it 3.5 stars (rounded up to 4).
