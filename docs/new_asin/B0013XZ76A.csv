3120625,5,B0013XZ76A,"This is a great two-for-one movie pack. It contains HIDALGO and the remake of THE ALAMO.

HIDALGO is the name of a horse, but it really isn't a movie about a horse. Hidalgo is the name of a Mustang stallion owned by Frank T. Hopkins (Viggo Mortensen). Hopkins and Hidalgo have won every North American long distance horse race there is and join up with Buffalo Bill's Wild West show. Hidalgo is promoted as being the best long distance horse in the world. Then an Arab shows up challenging the claim and wanting Hopkins to put Hidalgo to the test by racing him in the Ocean of Fire, a famous long-distance horse race in the deserts of the Middle East. Hopkins agrees and it's off the Middle East. What ensues is a fast-paced adventure filled with sandstorms, desert quick sand, thieves, murderers, a few feisty cats, and an English temptress
.
HIDALGO is a really good action movie. Without any sex (though there are a couple of innuendos), hardly any foul language, and only swashbuckling violence, it's a movie that parents will enjoy bringing their children to see. The film starts off a little slow, but once it picks up there's no turning back. The acting in the film is well done and the stunts are fairly impressive (even more so for the scenes with Mortensen since he did most of his own stunts). There are a few anachronisms (some of the people refer to Iraq, but during the setting of the movie, Iraq wasn't even a country yet). Nevertheless, these things are fairly unnoticeable and take very little away from the film itself. Besides just being a great story, the movie also has a subtle message about not being afraid of who you are.

Overall, HIDALGO is an entertaining film full of excitement. It's a great story and does a good job of balancing the drama with a little comedy. Oh yeah, since it is a horse movie, somebody dies, just so you know.

The second movie is THE ALAMO. THE ALAMO isn't that bad of a movie. But, it's not all that great either. It falls into the realm of typical Hollywood fare. The movie's biggest flaw is that it tries to do too much in a short amount of time. What ends up happening is that instead of getting the overarching story of the Alamo and what it was about, one ends up with a hodge-podge of a movie tied around one place and one person, Davy Crockett (Billy Bob Thornton). Make no mistake, though THE ALAMO includes a cast of Dennis Quaid, Jason Patric, and Patrick Wilson, it's Billy Bob Thornton who is the star of this movie. His portrayal of Crockett is a different take than is usually seen, but is perhaps the most realistic portrayal of Crockett seen on film; he injects a bit of humanity back into the legend that so many of us have come to know. Crockett really is the only completely developed character in the film, but there are scenes where some of the other main characters (Bowie, Travis, Juan Seguin) are fleshed out a little. It makes me think that the director, John Lee Hancock, had originally spent more time developing those characters, but because of the tight-schedule and the postponed release date when the film was first seen in theaters, he was not able to develop them as much as he wanted.

The movie gives a decent background about the events surrounding the Alamo and why the battle came to be. There's also some fairly interesting conversations that take place among the various characters. These things are not necessarily bad things, but in a movie that's centered around the most legendary battle in Texas history, they don't fit well and slow the film down.

Overall, I enjoyed THE ALAMO. I like the John Wayne version better, but there were things in this version that really made me think about the story in a new and different light. Especially of interest is the death of Crockett which presents an interesting idea. As far as I know, there are conflicting claims about how Crockett died and the version presented in this movie is one that is perfectly plausible and fits in quite well with how Crockett is portrayed throughout the rest of the movie. Whatever you think about Crockett's death, the movie is worth watching for Thornton's performance alone and for some of the minor historical details that have been kept in tact (such as clothing, musical composition, etc.).",1395964800,5,4268,4.617918313570487

The casting is great as well, including Houstonian Dennis Quaid as Sam Houston, Billy Bob Thornton as Davy Crocket (""He prefers David!"").
