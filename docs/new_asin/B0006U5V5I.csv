8043239,5,B0006U5V5I,"This is a very hilarious film!!!! The movie has some of the finest TV stars(artistas de primera!!) from the Dominican Republic.  I'm NOT Dominican and I understood very well the jokes.  Of course, it's a foreign film, all foreign films are exaclty the same.

The movie depicts many many wonderful aspects of Dominican life and depicts a bit of history as to how was this rythim heard along the haitian borders. It criticizes government corruption (as in all foreign movies) and how people survive under corrupted governments, while at the same time depicts the kindness and goodness of the poor countryfolks.  All the time showing how everyone has a good time no matter what they're going thru in live.

The movie captures a lot of wonderful scenery, very humurous scenes and lots of ""perico ripiao"".

I recommend this to everyone!!!!!",1158883200,,835,4.928571428571429
8043240,5,B0006U5V5I,"I feel so proud of being Dominican !!! This movie is great ! I laought so hard !! Kudos for Angel Muniz and his team for once again making great movies, despite the everyday struggles. And to the person that said that the jokes are too dominican, well, my brother in-law, who is Canadian (no Spanish whatsoever), loved it. The translation was great.",1129334400,4,349,4.555555555555555
8043241,5,B0006U5V5I,"Some people have been scared by Angel Muiz's earlier works (specifically his two films about the adventures and misadventures of Balbuena, the protagonist of Nueba Yol and Nueba Yol III).  Perico Ripiao is a very different kind of film, a Dominican road movie featuring three escaped musicians who have been unjustly imprisoned.  The landscapes and diverse communities that they encounter as they try to make their way home are really stunning.  The story is funny and engaging.  I highly recommend it.",1121644800,4,502,5.160493827160494
8043242,5,B0006U5V5I,"I saw ""Perico Ripiao"" in 2005 and I have to agree it is the best Dominican movie ever made. The story happens in 1978, I was 14 at that time and living in the Dominican Republic. Besides bringing me wonderful memories from my childhood, the movie also exposes the naked truth about the corruption of some elements in the Dominican government and the army. The movie is very funny indeed. If you are Dominican and have not seen this movie, what are you waiting for?",1118966400,5,464,4.470588235294118
8043243,4,B0006U5V5I,"I really liked the movie. I thought it was very funny, but the humor is about things that dominicans experience so if you are not dominican or have never lived in the Dominican Republic, you might not find the movie humorous.",1111449600,3,225,4.512195121951219
8043244,5,B0006U5V5I,"Wowww, this movie is HILARIOUS. i laughed all the way throught the movie. This movie is about 3 guys who got put in jail for minor offenses and they have a little trio of the Dominican Music ""Perico Ripiao"", and they catch hell to run away. It is very well done and the plot stays on track.. I love this movie very much. A must see by all the latinos out there..",1106611200,13,362,4.041666666666667
