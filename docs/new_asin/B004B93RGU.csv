4314078,5,B004B93RGU,"I rented to this movie by chance, only because I am a fan of Marisa Tomei. I must say that after viewing it, I immediately purchase the dvd that same day. Wow, it has been a long time for me since I have seen a movie like this that made me feel happy, sad and in love. Please if you love romantic movies then you owe it to yourself to watch this one. You won't regret it!",1326758400,,371,3.831168831168831

4314091,5,B004B93RGU,"OMG; one of the most beautiful but sad romances I've ever watched. Rob Morrow and Marisa Tomei are both great. Mathilda May ( who I believe is a French actress) is stunning. Watch it with someone you truly love and you will appreciate him ( her ) more. A real tearjerker...........but now one
of my favorites; that's for sure. True love should never be  taken for granted.",1460592000,,372,4.552238805970149

4314111,5,B004B93RGU,"""The music in my heart I bore, long after it was heard no more.""  These words and their great significance represent the heart and soul of this movie.  It is a love story that spans decades.  It has a dual story line that intersects via one man.  One is a very close friendship that  grows into a strong and enduring love as time marches on.  The other is a deep romantic love that inspires life changing sacrifices for the one who is beloved.  One sacrifice is obvious while the other is not fully apparent until moments before the screen fades to black.  I found this movie so moving, the final moments when realization hits me being literally breath-taking, that I sat through the credits, listening to the beautiful musical score, thinking back over the scene that hinted at the sacrifice but which I did not properly grasp at the time.

The actors do a wonderful job playing roles to which they are ideally suited.  The subtleties of both friendship, blossoming love, intense romance and commitment to decisions made are played to perfection.  This movie, in all its aspects, is fantastic.  You will watch it more than once and want to share it with your friends.",1409702400,4,1168,4.64390243902439
4314112,5,B004B93RGU,"This is a special love story...

We often hear references to someone being ""willing to die for"" someone -- but we don't often hear or 'see' that term refer to a non-physical aspect of life, and ""dying"" in a different way (let alone, in a way that would be emotionally excruciating (or, if nothing else, torturous to the soul))...

There is a powerful realization that takes place at the end of the movie, and which can 'take your breath away', when the film abruptly ends, and you're left with a just-disclosed fact (in the story) which -- after the viewer 'puts two and two together', with what else has been learned in the story -- is both agonizing (when considering one of the characters, specifically), and also inspiring (when considering that same character -- given that their actions (as concluded by the viewer (given that the film does not explicitly state the inescapable facts of the conclusion one is left to draw)) represent a stunning testament to what that character was willing to sacrifice, out of their love for the other character)...

I literally gasped aloud, after what was probably a fraction of a second after a final 'disclosure' occurs in the story, and which immediately precedes the sudden ending/cut-to-black... and I was left with my mouth agape, and my emotions 'jolted', as the credits suddenly began to roll...

It has a powerful ending, and subsequently, is a powerful story.

The acting in this film is quite good, and this is definitely a 'kind' of love story that seems relatively rare to ever encounter 'at the movies' -- something that is interesting, 'different' in several respects, captivates the audience, doesn't get boring, involves likeable characters (and who both treat each other with kindness and respect), and involves an emotional ending -- and nobility -- that is both heartwrenching and inspiring -- and importantly, while also seeming plausible (given the context and nature of the two main characters' respective and mutual 'journeys').

It was refreshing to watch a well-crafted and remarkable love story played out in a movie, and acted so well, and with such appeal.

It's a shame that so many films in this genre fall short of ever 'batting a thousand', so to speak.

This was one of those rare experiences of watching a film whose story was so well written and 'told' (via the acting) that it felt (to me) like 'watching (versus reading) a book', so to speak. One of the few other films to result in my feeling that way (and involved some of the greatest 'storytelling' I've ever seen on film) was ""Fried Green Tomatoes"".

I highly recommend this film adaptation of Erich Segal's ""Only Love"". This is definitely a story, and a movie, unlike any I've ever read or seen. And akin to reading a good book, one is left with a feeling of having experienced something special, and which one is appreciative for the opportunity (and/or serendipity) to have ever crossed paths with.",1407283200,4,2936,4.856

I love Rob Morrow in anything and Marisa Tomei is great too.",1403136000,,115,4.0
4314115,5,B004B93RGU,It was a wonderful touching story and so much like life can really be. I truly enjoyed it and so did my lunch break movie friends.,1398988800,,130,4.038461538461538
4314136,5,B004B93RGU,Happened to catch this movie by chance on a rainy day... I liked it a lot. DVD works great! :),1393718400,,94,3.75
4314137,5,B004B93RGU,I read the book and saw the movie the movie lead me the book. I must say I enjoyed the movie better than the book which is unusual I usually enjoy the books that were made into movie better. I personally think His First  Love was his best friend all the time,1389052800,,258,3.9615384615384617
4314138,5,B004B93RGU,"I remember watching this mini-series on TV when it first aired. I got lost in the love story and learned a few lessons along the way about relationships and loves lost and found.  When it first aired it was during the time when VHS was still the format and it took years to come out on ""video"". I tucked this one away in my mind and read the book by Erich Segal which made the film version come even more alive to me.

Now that it is on DVD, I own two copies. One for myself and one to loan to friends---because chances are it won't return to me!  But that's fine--if they enjoy it as much as me, I will count it as a gift and just order another copy to loan/gift.",1383609600,9,664,3.9774436090225564

4314140,5,B004B93RGU,"Life's challenges, occurrences that happen in dail life often interrupt relationships. This story I find true to life in many ways, as many of us have lost that special someone that cannot be erased from our hearts no matter the years that pass by. This movie touched me in ways that no other has ever done. If you want a movie that speaks to you personally this is the one.",1375574400,3,374,4.357142857142857
4314141,5,B004B93RGU,"THE MOVIE WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL LOVE STORY WHICH SPANNED 3 CONTINENTS (I LOVE TRAVELING ABROAD).  THERE WAS ADVENTURE, INTRIGUE, AND THE SATISFACTION THAT THERE IS A LOVE WHICH LASTS FOR EVER!",1371427200,3,189,5.096774193548387

4314143,5,B004B93RGU,What can I say - it is another Erich Segal tearjerker. I am a fan of great love stories and this is one of them.,1369008000,,112,3.52
4314144,3,B004B93RGU,The headline says it all. Rob Morrow could not have been more miscast. Other talented actors wasted in this poorly written (and poorly paced) Segal screen adaptation.,1368230400,,166,5.185185185185185
4314145,5,B004B93RGU,"This movie is beautiful, and is not the invitation to over-sentiment it would be reasonable to expect.  Beautifully written, directed and acted, as well.  Beautifully paced.  So if you're in the mood for ""Crank"" or ""Assault on Precinct 13"" - don't pop this in your device.
This is a movie about love and loss and choices and consequences, and friendship, and so on.  The art of making that a dynamic film, instead of a soap opera - is one of its glories.  I found it entertaining - like a sweet melody - while it's busy opening you up.  Takes you on a ride that's joyful and touching; lights you up - and slays you - simultaneously.  Can you ask for more than that?",1364947200,16,665,4.357723577235772
4314148,5,B004B93RGU,I gave it as a gift because my cousin loved it.  She thinks it is great and that made it a good loving gift.,1364947200,,108,3.5

4314151,5,B004B93RGU,"Gave it a five, because it is a great Love Story. They don't make movies like this anymore. All the actors were great. I had seen this on television. I looked for it for such a long time. So I was happy I found it on DVD.",1357689600,6,221,3.723404255319149

4314155,5,B004B93RGU,"My current favorite movies are Before Sunrise/Before Sunset and this movie totally has that same kind of feel to it. Divided into two parts[so it's pretty long, a little over 3 hours] you really get a feel for the characters. By the end you feel as if you actually know them and it definitely gives the movie some strong emotion. If you're into romances i'd recommend it for sure. Starts off kinda slow, but give it time.",1344124800,,421,4.48051948051948
4314156,5,B004B93RGU,"I happened upon ""Only Love"" while surfing through the TV menu, and I'm glad I did. This movie, IMHO, is so un-fakey. It's not like way too many films these days: ""Hi, my name is Joe. Wanna go to bed with me?"" None of that. Just some wonderful, slow-moving courtships. I never shed a tear throughout the whole movie (rare for me) because it all seemed so rational, I remained riveted throughout the entire movie. The end, to me, was not at all ""sappy."" It was just what one would hope for in many respects, yet not totally idealistic. It's been a long time since I've seen a movie this good.",1341360000,,590,4.324324324324325

Decided to try to find a copy at Amazon and ordered it. It will be so nice to have a really good copy of this on DVD. It's a very good movie with good performances by stars that I like very much. Has everything - romance, tragedy, good ending. Holds your interest all the way through. It's nice to have a beautiful copy on DVD as some of the scenes of Europe and Africa are lovely.",1327708800,2,529,3.953271028037383
8421650,5,B004B93RGU,If you like love stories don't pass this one by! My 88 yr old mother had seen 5 times. This was my 3rd. Shows TRUE LOVE never dies.
