7202110,4,B00XWTD152,"Finding Bigfood is a great series that takes you on an adventure into the unknown! Definitely recommended for good entertainment, providing a glimpse into a world unknown.",1383350400,,171,5.37037037037037
7202111,5,B00XWTD152,"Finding Bigfoot is a very entertaining show. The commaraderie between the principal characters is what sets this show apart; the logical, the dreamer, the biologist, the true eye witnesses, etc. One day I expect they will have a real encounter and it will be on film! Too many people in this country and other areas, have shared Bigfoot sightings. To discount his existence as ridiculous and not real is unrealistic and unfair to the many professional eye-witnesses, followers and Bigfoot believers. Follow the show and enjoy the fun! You don't have to be a believer to watch!",1377907200,,576,4.948453608247423
7202112,5,B00XWTD152,A nice if a little overly formulaic series that presents interesting information/evidence about the creature in question and a decent successor to Monster Quest.,1374710400,,161,5.75
7202113,5,B00XWTD152,"I absolutely love the Finding Bigfoot shows. I think it is the adventure and the chase and then all of the people's stories of their experiences that simply make this a delightful show. It is also a lot of fun when the crew gets a howl or a wood knock and on occasion a whole tree pushed down! I have seen some folks critical of this show, but there is a reason this is one of the most popular shows that Animal Planet has ever ran! You are out in the forest having a great adventure just like we used to have as kids and frankly...this show is just FUN! They have also done a great job in pairing up the team...a lot of chemistry amongst them all even if that is seen as tension at times...what a hoot it is...give it a try...if nothing else you will have a good chuckle!",1373932800,,772,4.0855263157894735
7202114,5,B00XWTD152,"I watched this episode because it was filmed in my hometown, Mckean county, Allegheny National Forest.  I've never seen a Sasquatch there myself, and have roamed those same woods for years, but I believe there are people there, who drink enough, who could think that they have seen one.  The one where they were on the Kinzua Bridge was rather funny, with the banging on the bridge posts to communicate with the sasquatch.  It was worth the watch, if only so I can take a stick and bang it on the bridge for laughs.  Maybe I'll bring my Cloud B Sound Machine Lambie so I can talk to the ""squatch"".  Watch it to know what I'm talking about.  You won't be sorry.  Of course, you won't get that hour of your life back.  But what else is there to do?",1369872000,,746,4.2785714285714285

7202116,5,B00XWTD152,What a group. There's someone for everyone to identify with. Has nothing to do with believing the legend or not. Just entertaining.,1428969600,,131,5.0

7202118,5,B00XWTD152,"Ok guys, this show has me completely HOOKED. I will be honest, I was pretty skeptical about this show. I love comedies and the thought of watching some ridiculous show about people hunting for bigfoot seemed a little ridiculous. I watched a couple seasons on Netflix and at first was a little judgmental of some of the characters. I couldn't believe how absurd some of their ways of thinking were! However, I am now a HUGE fan of this show and have been watching it every night so that I can catch up on all of the seasons! It doesn't surprise me that this show is doing so well. It is so unique! We are all fascinated with the idea of a ""bigfoot"" existing out there somewhere and it is so interesting to watch along as these four ""bigfoot detectives"" travel across America looking for this alleged primate! Ranae is my absolute favorite character - she is a biologist and puts the guys in their place a lot of the time! I highly recommend watching this show - it's a great one!",1405987200,,978,4.3791208791208796

7202121,2,B00XWTD152,"Just an extension of all the other Big Foot shows. If big foot is ever found, these shows will go out of business. My son-in-law loves everything big foot but got bored about half way through this season.",1396224000,,204,4.394736842105263
