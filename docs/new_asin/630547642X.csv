The Corruptor, was an equal blend of this, good action sequences and a good story. Chow plays  nick chen, a NY cop on the Asian Gang unit. newcomer Danny Wallace  (Wahlberg), is put on the unit, to take down mobster henry lee before the  local punk fukienese dragons gang puts him out of business. There are so  many twists and turns in this film that i don't want to give anything away.  I had high hopes for this film, after the replacement killers and it  fulfilled them. It gave chow a chance to act (more than the 13 words he had  in replacement killers), not just shoot (although it's nice). The ending of  the film I found particularly well shot and acted. All in all a good  showcase for chow's talents, and a worthy third rank under Serpico and  prince of the city for movies about police corruption.",932688000,,923,4.376470588235295

1034900,4,630547642X,"See The Corruptor (1999) not for the plot but for the gritty performances of the two leads and for the explosive synergy of western cop drama and Hong Kong gangland cinema. Yeah, a crap ton of HK flourishes inhabit the screen, from brutal yet stylish action set pieces to themes of absolution, treachery, conflicting loyalties, and the ever shaky rabbit hole we call honor among thieves. It's Chow Yun-Fat's second stab at an English-speaking role and it's evident that the international superstar is more in a groove here than he was in The Replacement Killers (1998, with Mira Sorvino). He plays seasoned NYPD Lieutenant Nick Chen who heads up the 15th Precinct's Asian Gang Unit. Thing is, Nick is a dirty cop, compromise being the watchword in surviving the mean-ass streets of Chinatown. Into this cesspool steps idealistic young badge Danny Wallace (Mark Wahlberg), just now assigned to the Asian Gang Unit. Expectedly, Danny has a hell of a time fitting in, what with his new colleagues mercilessly teasing him that he must've caught yellow fever for him to be hobnobbing in the AGU. An incensed Nick Chen complains to his superior: ""He's worse than white! He's green!""

Cops on the take. Murdered whores in dumpsters. Warring tongs. Fluid allegiances. Those pesky Fukienese Dragons. The plot may be conventional, but, oh, man, the film slings sleaze like it was hash brown. And it's still an edgy and highly charged crime drama. The violence ain't no joke, son. At times, director James Foley channels John Woo's patented crackle. There's that dope car chase that rips thru Chinatown and leaves, in its wake, an impressive mess of collateral vehicles riddled with bullet holes. I love the authenticity of it, how Foley points out the repercussions of a car chase in which the participants are wildly taking shots at each other - there's bound to be stray bullets that find unintended targets.

Chow Yun-Fat has charisma coming out his bum. He dials up that tarnished charm. He's so locked in as the shady lawman whose bump of rationality wars with his natural bent for grandstanding. There's a fascination in watching him negotiate the tricky places of power in Chinatown. It's lovely, that tug-of-war he has with himself as his new partner steeps himself deeper and deeper into the very same underworld that years ago rotted away his principles. The surprise for me when I first saw The Corruptor was that Wahlberg kept up with Chow Yun-Fat and even makes it seem effortless. These two just work well together, and the camaraderie that develops between their characters feels natural and, more importantly, earned. Nowadays, we all know Wahlberg has acting chops, but back in 1999 you and I were still referring to him as Marky Mark. It helps that there's depth to Wahlberg's cop beyond the naive, fresh-faced patina. The rest of the cast is solid, with Brian Cox a standout as Wahlberg's beaten-down ex-cop dad. And, really, despite several hyperkinetic action sequences, it's the taut dynamics of the characters that drive the story.",1437955200,,3044,4.966666666666667

1035052,5,630547642X,"I initially got this movie because I remember watching it some years ago when I lived in Germany and there was a time when my father and I decided to make up the time to swing by faster by renting movies almost every day or every week at least and watching them through; movies I'd never even really heard or seen. Usually they were kung fu movies and such, but every now and then we'd pick up a movie that would seem to pass the entertainment radars for us (when you're an American in Germany, it's REALLY hard to find American movies or their debuts to hit overseas as it takes at least 6 months, if you're lucky, to almost 2 years just for an American movie to come out... can you imagine? While you read on the news that somewhere in California the Matrix has started, you'd have to wait an extra few months just to watch, or something like that-- I just use the Matrix as an example.)

The Corruptor was one of those movies and sadly, we'd ended up watching the movie on DVD because it just never showed up in the bigscreens there. So anyway, I remember watching this movie and thought about how insanely deep this movie was. All the stuff about Chinese gangs, crime, the asian-flare of a metropolis society and how everyone seems not to care-- plus it has Mark Wahlberg who's one of my most favorite hollywood actors. More importantly, it also houses CHOW YUN FAT!!! Not only does it have a favorite actor of mine but has an amazing chinese kung fu actor! Performances from both these actors really stock you in for the vicious ride and twists this movie has for a plot and the action that befits it isn't over the top since the setting is basically China Town.

In a way I wanna say this is like Law & Order meets Shaft, but that's a disheartening comparison except to say that it has the crime story scene with the heart-pounding action of the latter but intensified ten fold. The cinematography is astounding, the characters, protagonist and antagonists, all are a great bunch to watch intermingle with and against one another and it's a really good movie worth the watch; the least to say, own.

Really, if you dig cop movies, this is your hit.

If you dig drama, this movie's your bag.

If you dig action, this movie's your well-given shot.

Seriously top notch stuff and glad I came across it years ago. The fond memory of it being the thing that pulled me back to watch and own it now.",1169251200,3,2398,4.401805869074492
1035053,4,630547642X,"""The Corruptor"" is a tough complex crime thriller set among the vicious power grabs by competing tribes in New York's Chinatown.  Out to bring them down is decorated detective Nick Chen(Chow Yun-Fat), head of the Chinatown Gang Unit, and the partner that was foisted on him, the apparently green officer Danny Wallace(Mark Wahlberg).  Chen is an effective cop but some of his methods are a little unorthodox and occasionally skirt the law.  This does not always go over well with the more idealistic Wallace.  Yun-Fat is excellent as the tarnished hero and Wahlberg is solid in a role that is not as stereotypical as it first appears.  Ric Young is effectively creepy and villainous as the duplicitous gang leader Henry Lee.  The film has many plot strands to it and may appear at some junctures to be overplotted.  Never fear because these elements come together in the end for a satisfying experience.",1132272000,9,903,4.901315789473684

1035055,5,630547642X,"I loved the confrantation that Danny Wallace had with his dad about the contemplation of what to do about turning in his partner Nick Chen .. I won't spoil the quote you have to take it in context of the scenario of the movie. What an impact it made in my life that what I do in my life will be what I live with.  I don't know if I over looked the goings on with Nick Chen because after all he was Yun-Fat Chow or that his over looking Uncle Benny's activities was some how a kindness to help May a lost drug addict and prostitute unable to escape her fate he tries to be more then a cop in her heart.  The entire movie was tastefully done, story line excellant, directed in a way to make you laugh, cry, sit at the edge of you chair during those action scenes.  Not to mention the sound track subpurbly done.  I have had always found Yun-Fat Chow a believable actor in all rolls he portray; this movie he stole my heart (more then in Anna and the King).. the ending must be seen to appreciate how to me he was a good cop, with admiration to the writer in whatever message he wanted to leave you at the end.  If you thought Mark Wahlberg was exceptional in this roll you should see him in The Perfect Storm and never thought he would play such a sicko in Fear but had me convinced. Lady's don't judge all men by what goes on in this movie but be wise to it's message of common sense.  It always amazes me when an actor can play his/her complete opposite.  I look forward to watching more of both of these great actors movies.  Don't wait to buy THE CORRUPTOR should it go out of print you will regret it! Well I think so.  Thanks for listening - Bye.  Would welcome your comments too.",1083283200,6,1684,4.1067073170731705
1035056,4,630547642X,"I was really surprised by how good this movie is. I figured a straight-forward shoot-'em-up and some exotic intrigue was about all it would have going for it. The cover had the usual fatuous nonsense on it: ""You can't play by the rules when there aren't any."" Why is it 90% of video covers have a reformulation of the same stupid subtitle? Apparently there is some lucky guy out there is employed writing new, yet indistinguishable ways to either deny the existence of Rules/Boundaries/etc. or at least deny their applicability to some beautiful, well-armed people. Good for him.
Anyway, this movie definitely exceeded my expectations. Great direction, but most of all great performances from Chow-Yun Fat and Mark Wahlberg. Wahlberg's relationship with his father was fairly cliched, yet it still came across as believable. The various moral predicaments of the two cops were just as interesting and well-done as the fight scenes. There is one major chase scene, which I found silly after a while, since it gave the impression that there were absolutely no other police cars within ten miles of some maniac with an Uzi blowing away civilians.
But that is a nothing criticism. Really, the only sore spot was the FBI goonish guy, who was both tiresome and one-dimensional in comparison with the other characters. But on the main, an excellent action-thriller. Chow-Yun Fat wasn't limited by John Woo's formula this time around, and his chops definitel show as a result.",1081814400,15,1468,5.020491803278689
1035057,5,630547642X,"This movie has excellent plot and is not one of those mindless John Woo action films.  Acutally, it is the ONLY John Woo films that has a good plot in addition to the usual good actions.",1077840000,2,186,4.166666666666667
1035058,5,630547642X,"This movie was just mindless entertainment. This isn't a bad thing, because it's fun to watch. It's pure action, and the plot isn't very important. Also, this movie is extremely violent and gory, and there is a lot of sexuality/nudity. I would not recommend it to younger viewers or anyone who is intolerant of such things.
But the bottom line is, ""The Corruptor"" is a good movie in its own respects, and shouldn't be over analyzed. If you want to see some cool action without thinking, then this is the movie for you.",1041120000,2,518,4.580645161290323
1035059,5,630547642X,"I loved this movie. Way better than the overblown and much-hyped Training Day, this movie has extreme subtlety and plays its hand well. Chow Yun Fat is perfect as a corrupt cop rotting in the hell of his own making, whereas Wahlberg plays the rookie facing the small temptations that lead widely astray...",1033948800,,305,4.773584905660377
1035060,4,630547642X,"They say everyone has a secret. The Corruptor is a prime example of this saying because everyone in Chinatown is hiding something in this movie. Detective Nick Chen, played by international star Chow Yun-Fat, heads the Asian Crime Unit in his precinct. Chen is a decorated hero with many years on the force. He is also in the back pocket of Uncle Benny, the leader of the old-line gang in the city. Because of this he is fighting even harder to take down the Fukienese Dragons, a gang of young Chinese recently arrived to America. Adding to his problems Chen has a new cop in his unit, Mark Wahlberg plays Danny Wallace. Wallace is a rookie with his own secrets including a father who owes the Italian mob a large sum of money.
The Corruptor is fun! Any movie that starts off with an entire storefront exploding and the one ""survivor"" being gunned down as he comes out the door is bound to grab your attention. Many gunfights and chase scenes later you even realize there is a story here. Mark Wahlberg continues to improve as an actor though it is hard to think of him as anything other than ""Marky Mark."" Chow Yun-Fat is the main reason to see this movie. He was a star in China for many years before we were lucky enough to catch a glimpse of him. His English has improved immensely from his first American movie, The Replacement Killers, and his charisma is at the level that it always has been. When Chow is on the screen it is hard to watch others and it will definitely be interesting to see him in the remake of The King and I with Jodie Foster.
 James Foley directed this movie. It's not for everyone but if movies like Hard-Boiled and The Killer entertained you then check out The Corruptor. It's worth it!",1017187200,,1716,4.430379746835443
1035159,3,630547642X,"In The Corruptor, rookie New York cop Danny Wallace gets assigned to the Chinatown section. It soon looks like he is in way over his head. He's the only Caucasian in a formerly all Chinese unit, and his fellow cops don't want him around. This includes his partner, Nick Chen. There is enough crime and violence in a single day in Chinatown to fill an entire season of the TV series Law and Order. Wallace doesn't have long to prove his worth in this sea of criminals and gang lords movie, but reality is utterly disregarded. Midway though The Corruptor, something dawned on me. The action isn't supposed to reflect reality. What has happened over the last two decades is that one of the greatest and purely American genres, the Western, went out of fashion. You couldn't pay the public to see one. Yet the power of the Western as an idea remained, and it reappeared in the form of these modern cops and robbers movies. So, when the bad guys are chased in their vehicles by the good guys, it's no different from when the outlaw gang rode into town. Shots would be fired, and it was up to the citizens to take cover. There were no rights to be read, no one to keep the law officers in line. People dropped like flies in those old Westerns. The differences were that fake blood didn't fly from their bodies, and the sound of the gunfire didn't explode in Dolby digital sound. From now on, I will tell myself that I am watching a 21st Century Western.
Mark Wahlberg and Yun-Fat Chow really do try their best to be professional throughout the movie, although they throw each other some knowing glances that probably have nothing to do with the script.",1016755200,3,1646,4.49
1035160,4,630547642X,"I admit, I'm a little biased. I love cop flicks. This one wasn't too bad. It starts off with a bang, literally. A store in Chinatown blows up and the violence begins.
This story sets itself in the fictional 15th Precinct in Chinatown. If you are a New Yorker and live on the Lower East Side, then you'll recognize all the spots.
In Chow Yun Fat's real US debut, he tries his best to be the actor he was in Hong Kong. If it weren't for his accent, he'd probably fared better in the film. Hong Kong style filming and gunplay takes precedence in this film. Truthfully, there is more gunplay here in the film than the NYPD has seen in the last 20 years.
There were many technical flaws. Most would not be seen by the untrained eye. Chow gets shot in the end with a big bullet hole. Same goes for a bunch of cops in a Vice bust. My question, where were their bullet resistant vests?! Look out for the way MArk Wahlberg butchers a radio call. He uses language not used on REAL NYPD communications. There are more things to look out for but I digress.
Overall, I like the film, the plot and some of the portrayal. Most of all, I love the fact it was filmed in NYC. All films and shows pertaining to New York City should be filmed in New York City. Also, if you are missing the World Trade Center, they do a nice flyby of the city skyline.",1015459200,,1331,4.162790697674419

However, it has a convoluted storyline that is almost as chaotic as Natural Born Killers yet has not been pulled off in as clean or professional manner. The acting is mediocre and the shoot-outs gratuitous and many people may like the action, but the story is difficult to follow because there is no clean line defining who is good or bad or in between...
Three Stars because it is a complete tale of betrayal and corruption yet could have used some better acting and more development for the plot.
If you like action and guns, you should enjoy this movie. If you like a good plot and easy-to-understand character development, view at your own risk.",1010361600,3,688,4.694214876033058
1035162,4,630547642X,"This is a Hong Kong action flick with a distinct taste of the west.  The movie starts off with a bombing and small store shoot-out that is right out of John Woo's stylebook but then it under goes a change.  The story starts taking over and it is one of intrigue within intrigue.  There are great moments of action with two guns blazing and an unbelievable amount of bullets but the story becomes the main thing.  This works as glue that a lot of Hong Kong movies don't have.  There are long pauses of plot developments between double crossing bad guys that are a real change to what is a typical Hong Kong action flick.
The director John Foley likes to place people in positions where they have to make critical decisions under pressure (At Close Range and Fear) and this is no exception.  A caring cop caught up in a situation of corruption is under constant pressure to decide what is right.  You are kept guessing as to his ultimate decision but the pressure is there under a dozen different situations.  The sub-plots add to the texture of this movie and add to its richness.  These side stories of the bad cop father in trouble, the interaction of rival Chinese gangs and his love of Asian culture are all parts of the puzzle that is Danny Wallace played by Mark Wahlberg.  Foley knows Wahlberg from the direction of his acting breakthrough in Fear and uses him at what he does best, the confused tough guy with the sensitive agenda. (His latest movie ""The Yards"" is an example of what I mean). Nick Chen the experienced street cop played by Chow Yun-Fat is the perfect slightly crazy hard-hitting loner, who has embedded himself in the struggle of rival gangs in New York's Chinatown.  There is no black and white here, only shades of gray, in a world of who is doing what to whom but like the cultural differences between East and West the relationships between individuals overcomes the hard facts of doing business on the street.
A very good blend of the Hong Kong actions movie that was brought in by Chow Yun-Fat (if you hear the commentary that Foley never saw a Woo movie) and what Foley's image is for street life in New York.  Coming from New York and living and working in Asia gives me insight into the homework that went into the making of this movie and I will say they did a very good job.",993945600,3,2309,4.458432304038005
1035163,5,630547642X,"""The Replacement Killers"" was terrible.  It was like a Chow Yun Fat/John Woo movie by numbers and poses.  Nothing to speak of in terms of storyline or compelling characters (apart from Chow's) that his best known HK work featured.  This movie however features Chow Yun Fat as the sort of conflicted yet ultimately principled man he should play, but with tons of intrigue and a good performane by Mark Wahlberg as a rookie under Chow's wing.  It's not very ""Hollywood"" which is a good thing.  It definitely has a feeling closer to a foreign film and that is very welcome.  This doesn't have as much action as ""The Killer"" or ""The Replacement Killers"" but it had a solid storyline.  Hopefully with the success of the phenomenal ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", Chow Yun Fat's other movies will get the look they deserve.  This man shines whenever he's on the screen.  He saved ""Anna & The King"" as well.  I forgot to mention that for once New Line has SOME additional features, and they interesting.",993168000,8,998,4.716763005780347

With bad guys you love to hate, flawed good guys you hate to love, and an FBI guy so disgusting you want to drop a car on him, if you can't find someone to love or hate in this film, stick to cartoons.
Fucanese dragons made my blood boil every time they stutted their sneering faces across the screen.  I cheered every one oficer Chen took out.  I can't get enough of this film, I can't seem to stop watching and listening to it.
I think that is the key.  The sound track carries your emotions so well through the visual treat and savy scene cuts.  The high overhead shots continue to point out just how pointless it all was, but we watch the cast struggle through it all.  Temptation provided at a level no red blooded man could resist.  Boy did I want a rub down as I listened to ""Candy Perfume Girl"".
Watch this film.  Watch it often and loud.  Don't worry about the volence and blood, it's just a movie and nobody ""really"" gets hurt.  Just enjoy the thrill of one of the best chase scense ever filmed.

The  Corrupter is Chow Yun Fat's second American film.  He is perfectly cast as  a shady New York City cop in China town.  Mark Walhberg is also very good  as his new partner.  Another good performance was by Brian Cox as  Walhberg's father.
The film has some great action parts.  The film also  does a great job contrasting Chinese and US culture.  On many levels its a  great film about cultural diffusion.
However, despite some great cultural  exchanges, good actions scenes, and great acting the film in my opinion was  not very good.
Its too long and by the last 20 minutes the story is  dragging and dragging.  I wanted to like this film very much, but the story  itself and its collapse into boredom at the end sank this film for  me.
This was a good effort but it failed to cross the finish line.  It is  worth a rental, but not too buy.  You will not want to watch this film more  than once.
Again, I really wanted to like this film and wish I could  have.",967075200,,1110,4.230769230769231

I am a great fan of action  movies and this is a one of the best, the relationship between Chow and  Mark works well, especially Chow's feeling toward Mark being an outsider in  a world of the chinese.  A very moving ending even though sad had to  happen!!!",965952000,2,378,4.095890410958904
1035167,2,630547642X,"I tried hard to understand this film until I finally understood: it is incomprehensible, a mishmash.  No one figured out where the film was going  or what it was about.  They just filmed it. Sime nice colors, some fair  (for HK movies) action sequences, nice camera angles.  And talk like you're  overhearing a bunch of random telephone conversations.  A dish of Chinese  noodles is far more coherent than the strands of this movie.  And yet, we  should encourage these Hong Kong types to make more movies in the US.  They  do bring a nice perspective.  So far, it seems that the lavish Hollywood  budgets have corrupted these movies.  The high budget certainly seems to  have corrupted THE CORRUPTOR.  We have to get back to basics, i.e., a good  screenplay.  Once you have that, bring in the Hong Kong stars and  directors.  Bring in Chingmy Yau, while you're at it.  Bottom line: (and I  hate to say this on Amazon) you'd be better off renting this movie than  buying it.",965260800,,974,4.627218934911243
1035244,2,630547642X,"Sorry to say, ""The Corruptor"" is a ho hum, strictly by-the-numbers police procedural set in a precinct in the heart of New York City's Chinatown.  Chow-Yun Fat stars as the officer in charge of the district, a generally  serious and dedicated cop whose corruptibility we see played out as he beds  local prostitutes and makes cozy sweetheart deals with a racketeer in the  neighborhood.  Then in walks Wallace as a neophyte cop, the first white man  ever to work in this all-Asian department.  The question then becomes:  is  this new officer (Mark Wahlberg) as corrupt as Nick or is there a secret  hidden behind his faade of ""green"" newcomer?
Actually, the story of the  film emerges as more interesting in cold print than it does in its final  cinematic form. As written by Robert Pucci and directed by James Foley, the  film, particularly in its early stages, verges practically on the  incomprehensible.  This is partly due to the fact that the thick accents of  virtually the entire cast render much of the dialogue indecipherable (and  Wahlberg is not a heck of a lot better on that score in all honesty).  One  almost wishes that the entire film (rather than just a few brief snippets)  could have been translated with subtitles.  Adding to the incoherence is  the astonishing profusion of characters hurled our way almost from the very  beginning.  We spend much of the film just trying to figure out who is who,  how each person is related to the others, exactly how many gangs are  involved in the proceedings and what exactly it is they are all  after.
Luckily, about halfway into the film, the elements begin to jell a  bit and the interest level increases ever so slightly as the two principal  characters begin to discover truths about each other initially held back  from both them and us.  Even here, though, the film actually treads over  ground that was explored to far greater effectiveness in ""Donnie Brasco"" a  few years back.  That earlier movie, however, was considerably more  intrigued by the moral complexities of its situations and characters than  ""The Corruptor,"" with its weak and uninspired screenplay, ever manages to  be.  For the most part, this film is executed like a standard issue  cops-and-robbers shoot-em-up, filled with mediocre car chases and poorly  staged gun battles.  The filmmakers simply don't have the intellectual  where-with-all to cope with the ethical issues they want so desperately to  explore.
It's highly unlikely that even the most die-hard action movie  fan will be particularly impressed with this tepid genre entry.  The  saddest aspect of the film is watching the talented Mark Wahlberg (who has  scored most effectively in the past when appearing in more serious,  non-blockbuster roles and films) as he continues his unsuccessful attempt  to secure a place as a sure-fired draw at the movie box office.  The best  advice to Wahlberg may be to simply stop trying to be a star and  concentrate on being an actor.",964656000,,2976,4.909090909090909
1035245,2,630547642X,"I expected this to be an action packed killing spree, with superb Hong Kong style cinematography and an okay plot. Instead, what I received was a very good story with average cinematography and hardly any Hong Kong  killings!
The key to this movie is the relationship between the two  leads, and this comes across rather well, despite the aprehension of Marky  Mark being in there. He does himself proud, but C-Y Fat drops a peg or two  on the action ladder.
The film is not your average shoot-em-up, nor is it  your average thriller. It fails on both counts, think Internal Affairs  meets Showdown in Little Tokyo, without the best bits of either.
Though  I'd like to give it more, it failed to capture the imagination, and  countering that, it failed to provide enough bullets for a Terminator 2  type rating.
Avoid it if you want Hong Kong action, buy it if you like  the actors and want to relax with a passable plot, backed up by a weak  cast.",957657600,,948,4.517647058823529

1035251,4,630547642X,"This film seems to better represent the Chinese, Chow Yun Fat especially, in American film.  Recent efforts by HK film stars have resulted in the terrible stereotyping that always takes place in Hollywood.  Rushhour and  Lethal Weapon 4 both made objects of their Chinese stars, Chan and Li,  respectively.  The Corruptor shows the respect neccesary of an actor like  Chow Yun Fat, one of the finest and most prolific actors that has ever  lived.  It deals with the Chinese in a more mature way, almost as if  previous knowledge is helpful in fully understanding the movie.  The only  problem with this movie is that Fat is better than it.  No one can expect  Foley to provide the action neccesary to impress an American audience that  knows Fat, but in American action standards he does fine.  The opening to  the film is a very intense shoot-out in a Chinese lamp shop and later in  the film a Chinese song is actually played as the prominent background  music.  The film's mood is dark and dramatic.  A very well done film.",940377600,28,1026,4.657303370786517
