8475131,5,B003TZNVAO,"I was very excited to find that there was a movie about Simon Bolivar, the ""South American George Washington"" as some call him.  Very few people in the US know about that history.  I wish more movies like this were made, rather than remake after remake of the same old subjects that we now see in the cinemas.  There are some very important and tremendous opportunities for movies that tell of the dramatic histories of South America (as well as North America), and maybe that is at last beginning to happen with other dramas like ""La Pola"" and ""Manuela Saenz"" along with this production of ""Bolivar"".",1310428800,,601,4.650943396226415
8475132,5,B003TZNVAO,"WORTH THE WATCH! This is the most authentic and well done work on BOLIVAR ever created.  Betty Kaplan creates a visionary, compassionate, intelligent and passionate figure that is BOLIVAR.  This Story of a man that had a dream and accomplished it.  She brings you into the life emotionally, and allows you to live it as an audience.  The authenticity goes above and beyond, shot on locations where events took place, shot in the rich palaces in Peru, the awe inspiring churches to the rustic plains and rivers of Venezuela, bringing you to the reality of how Venezuela, Columbia, Peru and Ecuador were actually liberated and how Bolivia was formed, and how the idea of the United Nations was born.  The visuals truly tell the story, and the acting is amazing.  Notable scenes:  Bolivar's teacher, Simon Rodriguez (Luis Pardi) is magnificent during a first meeting in the high Andes after 9 years of separation, such a note of intense emotion;
Paez crossing with his ""llaneros"" the river on a daring attack on the Spanish; Bolivar falling in love with Manuela in a 1800 formal dance in an Ecuadorian mansion, sublime;
Bolivar boarding the 3 mast Bergantin, to meet the representatives of the United States, and so many others!  This Mini-Series is one for the books, a great experience & a must see!",1280188800,2,1298,4.841628959276018
