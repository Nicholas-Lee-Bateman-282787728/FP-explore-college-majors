4443905,4,B004P7CMOQ,"Parts 1 and 2 were great!! Part 3 did not give me much. I did not like climax of the story or how it ended. It seemed as if they couldn't find anything better to write. They should have stopped while they were ahead.
  Part 1 involved the two brothers. While they were both horrible, one was dillusional and perverted. In the end, the older brother showed that he did have a speck of decency.
  Part 2 involved the bank robbers. Most of them became vampires, but one of them refused to give in. It was full of action, and I even laughed at some parts.
  Part 3 went way back into the cowboy days. It just seemed thrown together. I was confused at a lot of it, and the part where the guy goes into this little interlude at the bar, was the worst. I was not impressed.",1341878400,,766,4.10738255033557

4443907,5,B004P7CMOQ,"I am an avid fan of both Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez.yes even the Spy Kids franchise. Nothing they have ever done has dissapointed me.

4443908,5,B004P7CMOQ,"I agree with the other review about the original movie ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" is the best movie in this series. However, being a ""die-hard"" fan of the movie, I had to get the entire series. This ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" Movie & Series is what is known as a ""Cult Classic"". I purchased all of these movies back in the VHS days, and I still love and enjoy these movies, especially now that you can get them all in one DVD set. To me, the movie ""The Hangman's Daughter"" is just as good as the original ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" movie. Plus, ""The Hangman's Daughter"" shows you where all of this begins, back in Mexico, during the days of the wild, wild west.

""Texas Blood Money"" is probably the weakest of the movies in this series, however it is still a good movie, that has the same bar & bartender as the Original ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" movie. Also, I really enjoyed ""The Full-Tilt Boogie"" (Behind the Scenes/Making of From Dusk till Dawn). It has George Clooney, Quentin Tarrantino, Juliette Lewis, and others explaining all the stuff that was involved in making the movie ""From Dusk Till Dawn"". If you are really, really into the ""Dusk Till Dawn"" movie, odds are that you'll enjoy this entire series, so in that context, I highly recommend this one. Thanks and enjoy!!!

P.S. The soundtrack to the Movie ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" is fantastic also!!!",1331078400,2,1339,4.506172839506172
4443909,4,B004P7CMOQ,You get the whole set for $10 buck.  very good value.  I like the main title too.  Nothing fancy.  Just pop the disc in and the main manual comes up. The first and the third movies are the best.  You can just skip the second one.  The documentary is fun to watch too.  But... the picture quality is very bad especially the first one.  Shaded area is pitch black without any detail. Light area is over saturated.  Horrible.  And there is no subtitle.  There are a lots of catch phrases in the movies.  I do wish they have subtitle in case I don't get what they are saying.,1326931200,,571,4.185185185185185
4443910,3,B004P7CMOQ,"This is along the same lines as the Hellraiser 4 Film Blu-Ray I had reviewed, also released by Echo Bridge/Miramax.

The films are all on one disc and the picture quality is pretty good, but the first film is by far the best of the bunch. The sequels are more like B movies, and Full Tilt Boogie is a poor quality Documentary with a few fun points but nothing amazing.

All four films are 1080P (which doesn't help full tilt boogie mind you), and From Dusk Till Dawn 1&3 have 5.1 surround, while the other two films have 2.0.

*slight spoiler*
Without going into too much of the synopsis and plot, the stories primarily encompasses a group of people getting caught off guard by a bunch of vampires. The first film especially switches gears very rapidly and it becomes a very different movie at that point =).
*end spoiler*

The picture quality is alright but nothing to write home about, it will most likely be the best we see for these movies, especially in a one disc bundle such as this. The audio can be a little low but is decent for the most part, and the extras are non existent. None what so ever, just scene selection and movie selection on the main screen, not even subtitles.

If you are looking for a cheap fix and are a fan of Rodriguez or Trejo then you will probably enjoy these films, they can be campy and fun, but the first one is by far the coolest and best fleshed out.
I would recommend this to any Tarantino/Rodriguez fans but tell them not to expect too much in terms of the production value. It's all very mediocre, but get's the job done.

Video Quality: C- (they all look alright, with the original fairing the best and full tilt looking atrocious)
Audio Quality :C- (can be on the low side, even with my sound bar I have to raise the volume pretty high)
Aesthetics: C (they could have made the print a little larger on the back cover)
Price: B (this was a pre-order on most sites for $7.99 and can now be had for $9.99 at most stores, not a bad deal if you enjoy these films. That's cheap for a blu-ray, let alone four of them.)
Extras: F (None at all, not even separate menus for each film,besides the initial choosing what movie you'd like to watch. And no subtitles at all brings this set down grade wise a lot.)
Overall: C-",1323475200,26,2254,4.329383886255924
4443911,4,B004P7CMOQ,"I have always said that blu rays need to have at leest two movies on one disc if they truly want to be the media of choice. They are slowly moving up but too many older movies NEED another movie on there. othewise many catalog features will never get to blu ray. And many will disapear from dvd as that slowly goes away too. Leaving them out of print forever. IT's a terrible thought. BUt many movies never made it to dvd from vhs, And that sucked! Ok. echo bridge, which usually does a terrible job on theater titles on blu ray ,does just that on the first movie, it's a lousy blu ray, all discolored and such. At least it doesnt have dirt on the print like halloween two does or lots of other movies on blu ray.  But it's still bad compared to the canadian release , which I own as well. That's heads aboved this drab looking bad print they used. HOWEVER the three other movies on here are good enough to make up for it. THey were direct to video releases and were never theatrical releases. they do look better on blu ray than dvd. THere's no extras but you get the whole set here. I would however buy the canadian one if you care about having a good picture on the first movie.  The other two look fine and they don't have any dirt or lines in them, something some major studie releases have on some of their 1990's releases! HOW bad is that? ANyways , these are a good imporvement over the dvds , and the colors look better by far.  So this one is for completists who want all three movies and they are all on one disc! which only once again proves that you CAN and should put at last two movies on a blu ray. The last movie was a documentary film about making the first movie. IT's in poor shape print wise, but it's still a good watch. This was made for conventions probably and therefore it's good that it's still around at all. I didn't mind the scratches on this one, it's a complete bonus video anyways.  THe second and third look good though and that's a good deal.  and 'full tilt boogie' is a nifty little documentary film from the mid 90's. SO cheers for all the movies on this one, except the first.",1321574400,13,2115,4.199507389162561

4443924,5,B004P7CMOQ,"I have been a fan of zombie and vampire movies all my life.  One of the best movies that combined the criminal thug element and the vampire genre is From Dusk till Dawn with George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino. I had not seen the (From Dusk till Dawn #2 or #3) and when I saw the complete series on one disk I purchased this combination (Miramax from dusk till dawn series) DVD for a bargain price on Amazon.

The four movies on this DVD include: the original from dusk till dawn, from dusk till dawn #2, and from dusk till dawn #3.  It also has Full-tilt Boogie which goes behind the scenes in the making of this movie and has the stars George Clooney, Quentin Tarantino and Juliette Lewis.

My favorite was the first movie in this series, but I also enjoyed from dusk to dawn #2 and #3.  The second movie was about a group of criminals getting together to rob a bank and all but one turns into a vampire. The third movie had a western theme which I actually loved.  It seems all these Dusk to dawn movies glorify the psychopathic criminal elements, who are all killers and thugs, but makes these psychopathic dirt bags look like heroes after defeating the vampires.

If you are a fan of Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino movies you should check out this combination DVD with all three movies and Full-Tilt Bookie.

All three films are on one disc. A second disc contains bonus material and a movie on the making of the film. Personally I enjoyed the first film immensely, but not enough to see how they made it. The sequels are worth a view, but are not ownership material per se unless part of the set. I bought this collection and paid for it by selling my original film at that major rival auction site by using it as a ""hook"" to sell a collection of lesser horror films.

If you own the first one and have seen the other two, most likely you will pass on this one.

Parental Guide: F-bombs, sex, and nudity in all 3 main features.",1367020800,6,829,4.104938271604938
4443981,2,B004P7CMOQ,"DVD - no closed captions/subtitles.  No matter how many
times I rewound and played at full volume I couldn't
understand parts of it.  Hard to rate the movie itself
when it's difficult to understand what is being said.
Of course other parts are so loud the sound has to be
turned down to half volume otherwise you lose your eardrums.
But this is not abnormal.  In the ""old"" days, sound technicians,
editors, whatever, made movies that can still be watched today
and still understood.  Today the FX are deemed more important.",1366243200,,523,4.714285714285714
