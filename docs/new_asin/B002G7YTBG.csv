3924669,5,B002G7YTBG,"I watch many Korean films.  I will buy them from Amazon, or watch them there, and Netflix.  I am currently learning Hangul and watching many of the TV series help me learn.  I love everything about the Korean culture.  When I was in the Army, I tried to get the Army to station me there.  Bummer....they sent me to Hawaii instead.

This was a really beautiful movie.  I was touched by the ending.  To be loved that way is a blessing.",1429401600,,433,4.2592592592592595
3924670,5,B002G7YTBG,"There are two kinds of pain that human beings often endure in cinema: the pain that announces itself through noise and deed and the pain that lies hidden, only showing itself through facial tics and tonal inflections. In MORE THAN BLUE, director Wai-keung Lau chooses to portray twin walls of self-imposed angst using the second type. The film is told in flashback as a pair of record producers reminisce about a love story concerning a tragic, ill-starred duo. In the flashback we learn of a record producer named K (Sang-woo kwon) who is dying of leukemia. He has only months to live when he meets Cream (Bo-yeong Lee), a woman who shamelessly announces that she will move in with him. They get along well, but their relation never becomes physical. She tells others that K is more like a brother or father than a lover. K does not tell her of his impending demise. Most of the film is from K's perspective. He loves her but must not tell her. Instead he decides that she must marry someone else who can take care of her. This he does. K finds her a dentist who might in ordinary circumstances prove a good match. During the courtship between Cream and the dentist, director Lau uses frequent flashback to add emotional resonance to the plot. Events which pass unnoticed the first time now assume totemic significance in flashback. The viewer feels K's pain as he tries to create a future for Cream who seems strangely detached from his efforts to marry her to another. It is only toward the last twenty minutes that the movie unveils a new level of pain. The viewer has seen Cream as a passive woman who does not mind being palmed off by a man who clearly loves her. A few key flashbacks reveal that Cream has long been aware that K is dying and she has chosen to give him the peace of mind that she knows is so critically important. She smiles and says nothing to tell K that she knows the truth. Her pain is to go along with the charade asked of her. There are two scenes that are played twice, with the flashback revealing the excruciating torment of both. The first occurs when Cream asks K to pose in a groom's outfit for a wedding shoot. This single picture is all she will ever have of a pseudo-marriage. The second is the marriage ceremony. K walks Cream down the aisle and for a brief moment her face is lit with radiant joy before he hands her to the dentist. K's hand lingers for the briefest second before he turns away. It is scenes like these that fill MORE THAN BLUE with the truism that withheld grief is infinitely more painful than any howl of existential tragedy. Few films say this more eloquently than this one. Highly recommended.",1407628800,,2655,4.487603305785124
3924671,5,B002G7YTBG,"another superb korean drama, tear jerker movies on a par with secert and now and forever and April Snow just great movies",1397260800,,121,4.545454545454546
3924672,2,B002G7YTBG,"This movie was very slow and hard to follow. The storyline was decent, but quite depressing. The ending was the best part but it didn't justify wasting the two hours before it. I could sit here and write a review explaining why, but that would also be wasting your time. There are many better movies on this website worth watching.",1394496000,,331,4.533333333333333

Also the finished song at the end during the credits will take your breath away.",1389225600,,174,4.46875
3924674,5,B002G7YTBG,"I incidentally watched this movie and it became my favorite movie. I watched 3 times in 2 days. I cried a lot. I am not a kind of person who cries when watching a movie. BUT this, I really cried a lot. It's a great movie and I definitely recommend everyone to watch it!",1388793600,,269,4.0
3924675,5,B002G7YTBG,I have only cried with two other movies. This movie had me crying all the way through. It was beautiful. It moved at a perfect pace. I was so shocked by the twist at the end. It added an extra poignancy to the movie. The love between the two leads was obvious to everyone but themselves.,1388620800,,287,4.142857142857143
3924676,5,B002G7YTBG,"so touching, various emotions. Funny, heart warming, heartbreaking. Although I do not like movies that make me sad, this one was actually really sweet movie",1388620800,,156,5.28
3924677,3,B002G7YTBG,"It's okay, seemed to predictable and one of those love movie that tries too hard. The only good part was the ending, the middle parts were too slow.",1388448000,,148,4.321428571428571
3924678,5,B002G7YTBG,This is an amazing love story.  I cried like crazy - I wasn't expecting that! The 2nd part of the story where it all came together was intriguing. A must see!!!,1387497600,,160,4.161290322580645
3924679,4,B002G7YTBG,"Starts off a little slow, but if you watch it to the end, you will NOT regret it. It all comes together!",1387497600,,104,3.772727272727273
3924680,4,B002G7YTBG,"I am an avid fan of Korean daily dramas and the characters in this movie really play their roles so convincingly you almost forget it's not real.  The formula, boy- loves- girl- but knows he's dying and won't admit it is frustrating in the beginning.  Then it's agonizing to watch the development of the story where the boy - K - tries to find someone suitable for his love, Cream, because he doesn't want her to be alone when he dies.  Just get your tissues ready.

The movie also has soul rending sound-tracks and some beautiful cinematic backdrops that adds to the poignancy of love lost too soon.",1387238400,,600,4.527777777777778
3924681,4,B002G7YTBG,"It's hard to imagine the events in this movie ever taking place in the US. Is it true to Korean culture? I don't know enough about Korean culture to be able to answer that, but I do know this isn't nearly the first Korean movie I've seen in which one or both parties to a nascent romantic relationship intentionally sabotage that relationship out of a sense of duty, protectiveness, nobility, whatever.

It's one the many varied ways human beings have found to befoul what would otherwise be their natural and loving attachment for each other. And one of the saddest.

In this movie, K not only encourages his one true love Cream (not either of their real names) to marry someone else, he practically architects the marriage. All because he's dying and doesn't want her to feel the loss of his death. Which of course is a ridiculous reason to act like that, since there are all kinds of ways for a person to feel loss, death or not, and to in the meantime deny oneself and another the gift of love is just plain dumb. If you're not enjoying and sharing the pleasures of life, then you're just waiting around to die, and what's the point of that?

Anyway, this movie is all about watching some of this sad, dumb behavior play out. And it offers that in a well-wrought, almost palpable presentation. The emotional heaviness will actually weigh you down, it runs so deep.

The writing, directing, acting, everything...it's all quite good, and tells a compelling story.

The one quibble I have, clearly is not shared by all. Some liked the way the story was wrapped up, but (without giving away too much) I would say that I felt that the ""plot twist"" was contrived, and that the story would have had as much or even more impact had it been shared from the outset. Still, I didn't _dislike_ the ending...I just think it was a bit awkward, to no great benefit to the movie.

I also found myself wishing that I spoke Korean, or at least knew more about different Korean dialects. The character Cream spoke in a way that even to my untrained ear was very different from the Korean I'm used to hearing. A lot more abruptness and deeper tones, versus what I might describe as a more melodic or (at times) even ""whiny"" way of speaking. I really loved listening to her, and whether it was meant to or not, it seemed to me that her different way of speaking added to the ""beat of a different drummer"" attitude she had.

(Maybe someone who does know Korean well will comment on that some day?)",1383264000,2,2479,4.495555555555556
3924682,5,B002G7YTBG,This movie was beautifully written and the characters were wonderful and believable. I just cried like a baby. The loved that they had for one another is what I think everyone would like to have at least once in a lifetime. It just saddened me that they never said the words that they both long to hear when time was of the essence. I hated that for them!!!!!! I love this movie.,1382832000,,379,4.277777777777778
3924683,4,B002G7YTBG,"Just watch it, great acting and would say it helps you stay focused on your goals in life. It definitely made me be thankful that the screenwriter thought of such wording to go with this.",1382486400,,187,4.371428571428571
3924684,5,B002G7YTBG,Very sad but the ending made the movie much better it is definitely different and very creative. I wish the girl express her love before it was too late.,1382313600,,153,4.310344827586207
3924685,4,B002G7YTBG,"I needed a good cry tonight and this certainly delivered (or maybe it's just my high emotional state at the moment?). Anyway, the story does get a while to get started, and I felt that there were some unnecessary characters along the way (especially in the beginning), but the second half (especially the last third) of the movie made up for all it's lacking. The spark or connection between the two main actors is not the greatest (they seemed more like very close family instead of lovers) but the internal dialogues were awesome to convey their emotions.

Overall, it was a worthwhile movie to wring out emotions. Would I watch it again? I am not sure if it will illicit the same response since I already know the plot in its entirety, but who knows? It is definitely in my list of the few movies that made me actually cry and not just teary eyed.",1381363200,,850,4.483870967741935
3924686,5,B002G7YTBG,"A very well acted movie, characters were developed well. Watch more than once to get full story. Sad and moving story.",1379289600,7,118,4.666666666666667
3924687,5,B002G7YTBG,"This is a total tear jerker.  If you are in the mood to cry then definitely watch it.  I couldn't stop crying.  I'm usually impatient and like to fast forward if the story is a little dull or the acting is bad/annoying, but didn't have to do that at all with this movie.  It's a beautiful film, with good acting and the story flowed. I really loved this movie and it kind of was a reminiscent of the Love Story.",1376092800,3,411,4.1
3924688,5,B002G7YTBG,"Looking into the reviews, I expected this movie to be great. I was still surprised by how much I enjoyed this story. I didn't agree with everything that happened in this movie but I love everything about it.",1371168000,2,207,4.473684210526316
3924689,5,B002G7YTBG,I basically agree with the other reviews. There are good characters in a pretty slow story. But a very special ending that ties everything together.,1369094400,3,148,4.96
3924690,5,B002G7YTBG,"AGAIN, LOVE KWON SANG WOO.  STORY WAS GREAT AND WHAT CAN I SAY, HE IS MY FAV SO I WILL WATCH ANYTHING HE IS IN.",1368057600,3,111,3.44
3924691,5,B002G7YTBG,"I really enjoyed this movie.  It is somewhat of a tear jerker.  It has an interesting and different story line, good acting and attractive actors.",1365811200,3,146,4.8
3924692,5,B002G7YTBG,"K and Cream are orphans who meet in high school, and have secretly loved each other since. K has terminal cancer and his only wish is to keep Cream from being alone; to do so, he pushes Cream into marrying a healthy and wealthy dentist, against their own hidden feelings. More Than Blue is a sad yet beautiful film, with authentic performances.

The story is very captivating; it can be joyful and heartwarming, as much as it can be painful and dreadful. It's an authentic representation of a ""terminal"" relationship; an authentic representation of a relationship that wants to be, but can't be - not exactly a happy fairytale. The film ends on a bittersweet note; an excellent and unexpected finale. As a side note, knowing the ending of the film from the beginning, or at least part of it, reminds me of the story/storytelling in ""A Moment To Remember"". The acting was superb, with a very authentic-feel and genuine chemistry between the two leads, Kwon Sang-woo and Lee Bo-young. The pacing was fast, and the storytelling was smooth. The music was excellent, down to the credits.

Overall, More Than Blue is a very moving and touching film; the amazing performances, the great music, and powerful story contribute to this film's excellence. As of 4/13/13, this film is available on Netflix Streaming and Amazon Prime Instant Video, a purchase is highly recommended for fans of the genre.

More Than Blue is safe for all audiences.",1365292800,14,1433,4.840816326530613
3924693,4,B002G7YTBG,"'More Than Blue' is a creative dramatization of the story behind a song's lyrics.  Reminiscent of O'Henry's 'Gift of the Magi', the two almost lovers sacrifice what they desire most for the benefit of the other.  The narrative moved a bit slow at times due to its sentimental nature, but the quality of the acting particularly on the part of Kwon Sang-Woo as 'K' is excellent and helps carry the story along.

As the other reviewer, iChat, noted, you really need to watch this film all the way to the end.  It pulls everything together and puts prior scenes into context.  It will touch your heart.",1361404800,7,598,4.60377358490566
3924694,5,B002G7YTBG,"This is a very sad movie. Its about a guy named K who loves Cream, but he won't tell her that he does because he's dying from cancer. Before he dies, he wants her to find someone to take care of her for when he's gone. Its a very beautiful movie. I would recommend this tearjerker.",1330905600,11,281,4.035714285714286

8369695,5,B002G7YTBG,"Let me start off by saying that I hated this movie for well over the first half of it. I despise contrived, melodramatic love stories, and this one seemed to fit the bill to a tee. However, at around the last 30-minute mark, everything changed. I wasn't expecting it, so I was completely unprepared for the plot twist. After that, it was a tissue marathon. I could not believe how well-crafted the movie was in terms of carefully setting up scenes and camera angles as part of the storytelling. I actually watched the whole movie again soon after to catch everything I had missed the first time around. Highly recommended.",1449705600,,622,4.663636363636364
8369696,5,B002G7YTBG,This movie is sadder than sadness. A great love story that reminded me of my sad friend. A plot line to make you think and feel. Watch it,1444176000,,137,3.9285714285714284

8369699,5,B002G7YTBG,"This was a great movie, quite unique despite the common Korean themes of broken family, lovers that can't get together, power ploys, etc. I enjoyed it from its baffling beginning to the bittersweet end.
