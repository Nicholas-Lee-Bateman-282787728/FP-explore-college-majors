874460,4,630443314X,"I like Rowan Atkinson very much. Like most people who know his work I first saw him as Mr. Bean, the slightly dim befuddled idiot clown who has a bit of a childish mean streak. Then I saw him in the twp Johnny English films which are wonderful send ups of James Bond as a fool and Mr. Beans Vacation which has one of the funniest begging on the street sequences I've ever seen.

This particular collection has him in the nineteen nineties in live performance in Boston. He looks quite young and it's interesting to see some of the genesis of his later work already being explored. The man has a fertile imagination and is a brilliant performer.",1382400000,,644,4.411764705882353

874538,5,630443314X,"I bought this dvd to replace my VHS tape many years ago. If you've never seen any Rowan Atkinson work besides 'Mr Bean', this is completely different. Be warned, you will need an awesome sense of humor to view this performance, those with no sense of humor, go back to watching politics. This dvd is not for you. It contains many skits with much foul language which adds to Atkinsons droll style. Initially I was disappointed with it because the best skits seemed to be missing. Don't worry, you will find all of those in the bonus features section, with the likes of 'Nobody named Jones' (my personal favourite!). Some comments say the way it was filmed detracts from the performance, I did not find that it mattered at all, once you're engrossed into the performances you don't notice. I watch it for clever comedy, not the pamorama or amazing sound quality. I highly recommend this dvd, it will be an essential addition for those with a great sense of humor. 5 star review.",1353283200,,976,4.614942528735632

I was familiar with him as Mr. Bean, America's introduction for those, I imagine, who hadn't ventured far  into British comedy. Most recently, I had an endless, tearful laugh over the second (and, yes, sexy!)""Johnny English"" at the movie theatre which showed acting chops you mightn't have guessed if you limited the man just to Mr. Bean. That juxtaposition of his acting styles started an all-out love of Rowan Atkinson. ""Rowan Atkinson Live!"" was simply fun and showed more of the man's versatile comedy talent.",1331251200,,590,4.959595959595959
874540,4,630443314X,"This has some really funny parts.  My favorite is Toby in Hell. There are some less funny parts, but Rowan Atkinson's personality carries through.

I have seen Atkinson in the BBC series ""Black Adder"" and ""Mr. Bean"" and this special, Rowan Atkinson Live(shot at the Boston University Huntington theatre), is equally as funny.  The skit set in Hell is especially hilarious.  Warning:  there is a fair amount of blue humor, particularly the sketch set in a classroom where Atkinson plays a teacher calling roll.

874639,5,630443314X,"I saw this act a long time ago on a cable TV channel. Then, in 1998, I bought the VHS, which unfortunately didn't bring two of the sketches now included on this DVD, maybe because it was a british version of the show. The text has some alterations too; e.g. ""latest release from Kylie Minogue"" instead of ""Puccini's greatest hits"", mentioned in the ""The Good Loser"" sketch. Of course, there is an improvement in terms of image and sound quality, along with the possibility of going directly to the funnier chapters you might want to show your friends. But, I have to agree with some of the reviewers that this DVD should come with a fair warning, since explicit language and gestures can be found with no shame at all! I love Rowan Atkinson and admires everything he does (well, maybe some of his movie roles could be left out of my list).

874642,5,630443314X,I had been looking for this DVD for a long time and finally found it on Amazon.  It is great material from a young Rowan Atkinson.

874643,5,630443314X,"I saw this show for the first on a Saturday night right after Saturday Night Live. The SNL had Pearl Jam as the musical guests and ran a week or two after Kurt Cobain had killed himself.  I was so sad over that loss and then this came on.  I laughed so hard. I quickly sought it out on video and saw for the first time the sketch about the rollcall at a high school.  I couldn't believe that this man was using such vulgar and hilarious language.  I have watched the show at least ten times and my affection for it has never diminished.  Stand outs: No One Called Jones, With Friends Like These, and Pink Tights And Plenty of Props.  I give copies of this show to people to see their reactions.  If they don't think this is funny, then I find it hard to believe they would find anything humourous.",1281916800,,797,4.169934640522876
874644,2,630443314X,"We are B-I-G Mr. Bean fans.  We have all of his movies, his entire regular series, and just enjoy his crazy, funny, clean persona.  While we understood that this wasn't just his ""Bean"" character, we DIDN'T realize that it was chocked full of simply obscene, most embarrasing bits that focus on subjects that very few fathers would want to watch with their son or daughter present, at ANY age.  What a disappointment.  I rarely write negative reviews, but felt compelled to do so.  I simply couldn't imagine watching it with anyone, and felt shamed watching it even alone.

Saw it again.............same problem. So I hoped when I bought this DVD it was there & of course..........laughed so hard I STILL haven't gotten the whole routine.

874647,5,630443314X,"Having the good sense to catch Rowan on tv when Blackadder was running, i have been a fan ever since. When Mr. Bean was making the rounds on Public tv, i was rather prepared to expect Rowan to win me over again.
He did that in abundance, as again, he created another original idea and took it overboard. He won me over again.
This intimate and pleasing dvd shows Rowan from 1991, and his approach has not changed. A generous amount of material is displayed with such laid back restraint, i was overcome with laughter by the second skit.
I am glad that America appreciates Rowan's talent. He is superb with whatever is handed to him. Am hoping that more like this is released for us fans.",1247097600,,687,4.417322834645669

The remaining skits ranged from not funny to crude with offensive language.  The best that my 17 1/2 year old son had to say about it was that it wasn't funny.

874703,5,630443314X,"Rowan Atkinson Live
I first saw this on cable several years ago.  Anyone who enjoys Rowan Atkinson's comedic talents is in for a good time with this program.  Recorded during a performance in Boston in 1991, it includes some classic irreverent jabs at British schools, religion, and social conventions.  Atkinson appears supported by Angus Deayton as his straight man and narrator.  Some routines are better than others, but humor is about as subjective as anything can get, so the bits that I didn't like as much might be the best things on the disk to someone else.

My favorite moments include ""A Warm Welcome"", in which Rowan plays the Devil as a polite, somewhat smarmy host in a smoking jacket welcoming the Damned - which ends up being just about everyone - to Hell.  Some of the groups who are damned wholesale are startling and hilarious.  ""With Friends Like These..."" involves Deayton narrating the horrors of his wedding day, with Atkinson portraying, in rapid succession, the lecherous priest who did the honors, his sillyass best man giving an incoherent and incriminating speech at the reception, and his new and utterly drunken father-in-law giving a heartfelt toast to the man he thinks his daughter should have married and an irreversible rejection of the groom's family.  I spurn you as I would spurn a rabid dog...  ""Pink Tights and Plenty of Props"" features Deayton as a professor of theatre giving a lecture on classic performance while Atkinson acts out the instructions on stage.  It defies description without giving its best moments away, so I'll simply say it left me gasping.  Other routines highlight Atkinson's considerable talent as a visual comedian - ""It Started with a Sneeze"" showed up in a Mr. Bean program later.  In ""Invisible Man"" he mimes the reaction of a tube rider as the titular character messes with him mercilessly, and in ""A Final Bash"" he plays a janitor who accidentally discovers an invisible drum kit and, after groping around trying to figure out what's what, ends up playing them flawlessly in pantomime.

The three deleted skits that are included with the DVD are of the same high quality.  ""Elementary Courting for Men"" is my favorite of these, with Deayton again delivering the lecture and Rowan acting out the do's and don't's of a perfect date.  When Deayton advises ""Not to look like a complete idiot when she opens the door"", a door swings open on the stage to reveal Atkinson looking more idiotic than ever before or since.  ""Guys after the Game"" has Atkinson alone on stage as an exquisitely polite maitre de at an Indian restaurant that has been besieged by drunken football hooligans.  ""Tom, Dick, and Harry"" features Atkinson, for the third time in the program, as a clergyman delivering the eulogy for Tom - blind and deaf - Dick - deaf and dumb - and Harry - blind and dumb - who have died together in a freak accident.  The punchline is his prediction of Tom's contribution to the Angels' Choir when the three of them reach Heaven and I suggest that you swallow whatever you're drinking before he speaks it.

This is a mandatory program for Rowan Atkinson fans and would be a great introduction to his work for the uninitiated.",1203638400,7,3194,4.806215722120658

874783,5,630443314X,"The only reason I got this DVD was because I liked the Mr. Bean series.
His physical acting abilities are displayed here, but it is his verbal humor that is the highlight.
Rowan Atkinson's portrayal of various gimmicks is wonderful.  Most of the show is filled with typical British humour so if you don't understand it, you won't be as amused. Also in one of the performances, he strays into  religious humor that some might find offensive.
I think the best item was the one where he portrays a Dean or a Principal, ""No one called Jones"".  It was hilarious and it's amazing how he performed it without even a hint of a smile.
A must-have if you are a Rowan Atkinson fan.",1190073600,,670,4.430894308943089
874784,5,630443314X,"If you have seen the VHS version of this live show, you will love the DVD version. Despite the fact that this DVD version divides up the sketches into what they call ""the real live show"" and ""extra sketches,"" (which I don't really know whether they were really extra sketches or they considered them extra sketches, even though on the VHS version, they all just appear together) the materials are really good. I liked the fact that it has an introduction with Rowan and his obsession over an American tuna sandwich, it was classic. The picture is really clear, it has a menu, and some facts about Rowan on the dvd extras, no behind the scene stuff (although I would highly prefer one), and the sound is just right.
If you like Rowan, his live show, or even his straight-man Angus Deayton, I highly recommend this DVD to you, it's a great addition to your DVD collection. Well, I hope this review helps.",1189900800,,902,4.539877300613497
874785,5,630443314X,"Absolutely brilliant performance by Atkinson; this is a fantastic DVD. As noted by other reviewers, it has a plethora of skits, including both US and UK sets. I was ecstatic to finally get the Devil sketch on DVD, having not seen it in years. (Had the VHS but lost it to Katrina.)

Now, a big knock against A&E, enough to give the release itself zero stars (I wish Amazon allowed for multiple ratings, so we could rate the performance separate from its media presentation). A&E apparently hates the hearing impaired. For years they have released countless shows on disc without any form of closed captioning or subtitles. What's mind boggling about that is, in many cases, the captioning is available to them, but they opt not to use it, instead ""cleaning"" the footage of such encoding. (In fact, A&E television programs are almost always captioned.) I can't fathom why, but it does result in lost sales.

I'm not deaf, but I do have a hearing problem. I overcome it with hearing aids and a good speaker system on my video, but I rarely buy A&E releases; I either rent them or wait for their appearance on TV. But I've bypassed buying scores of A&E releases -- everything from the entire release sets of Poirot to Jeeves & Wooster to Space: 1999 -- for lack of any form of captioning and/or subtitles.

FWIW, I have contacted A&E about it; the polite response was that the company did not feel their normal viewership/customer base needed captioning or subtitles to justify the additional cost.

Sorry for the rant. 5 stars to Mr. Atkinson and a superb performance; 0 to A&E for another shaft to the hearing impaired.",1189468800,5,1617,4.683098591549296
874786,5,630443314X,"Some may be wondering, I know I was. This edition contains the US version, which ends with the drum skit which is not in the UK version, But the DVD also contains as Bonus Features the skits that were in the UK version but not on the US. So it's the best of both worlds!

I'd seen the US version long ago on television, then managed to aquire a copy of the UK version, not knowing they were different, and I've thought I've been dreaming the drum skit all this time.

874854,5,630443314X,"My family owned the VHS version of 'Rowan Atkinson Live' several years ago, and it is singularly the best comic act I have ever seen.

This is genuinely one of those tapes you can watch over and over and over, and never ever get sick of. I remember how I'd almost memorized a few of the sketches having watched them so many times! (Yeah, it sounds lame, but if you watch this work of art, you'll see just what I'm talking about.)

My personal favorite acts are 'Pink Tights and Plenty of Props', 'A Warm Welcome', the Indian restaurant one (I forget the name) and the priest/bestman/father-in-law one (again, I can't remember the name). But really, not one of these acts won't make you fall off your seat laughing; they're all absolute and pure genius. If you still have a VHS tape player in these days of high-end digital media, make it a point to buy this right now.

Incidentally, the reason I don't remember the names of so many acts is that I haven't seen this tape in years! Literally about five or six years, since it got lost and VHS became relatively obsolete.

People of Amazon, please please PLEASE bring this title out on DVD, for the sake of the general community at large. The reviews for this product are phenomenal, as they should be, and I have no doubt that the DVDs will sell like hotcakes. I for one am in love with Atkinson's genius acts that I haven't seen in years, and will lap it up straightaway.

Buy this product.",1094256000,17,1440,4.4393939393939394
874855,5,630443314X,"Rowan Atkinson is a marvel of physical, scatological, and intellectual humor, a combination virtually unknown in the world today. This stage show is not generally a rehashing of things seen before (although ""It Started With A Sneeze"" is taken directly from an episode of ""Mr. Bean"") but is a unique and original group of works designed to highlight all of Atkinson's amazing comedic talents.

 My favorite of the skits is ""A Warm Welcome"" in which Atkinson plays the Devil (""...but you can call me 'Toby'..."") welcoming new arrivals. The best line (and the one that got the most laughs) in the show is when he summons ""the French"" out for special treatment. I am also fond of the amazing physical dexterity involved in ""Invisible Man"" and ""A Final Bash"". He is always great as a sadistic straight man, and his portrayal in ""Fatal Beatings"" is delightful. He returns as another evil headmaster in ""No One Called Jones"" which also shows his ability to handle more scatological humor with dexterity. For all around amusement, his portrayal as a hammy amateur actor in ""Pink Tights And Lots Of Props"" is delightful, and went over hugely well in front of a college audience, as you might expect.

 Five stars without question, although there are a few off color and offensive excesses I could have done without. Noteworthy also is the performance by Angus Deayton, the straight man in the two man sketches. This is a comic tour-de-force, and is not to be missed.",1091664000,14,1457,4.816

874857,5,630443314X,"Rowan Atkinson is a comedic talent to be reckoned with.  His display of verbal talents such as on the Blackadder series to his visual ability with the Mr. Bean series are absolutely amazing.  If you are a fan of either of these styles, then this video is a treat.  If you are a fan of both of them, then this video is an absolute must.  From ""It All Started With A Sneeze"" to ""Pink Tights and Lots of Props"" to the incredible ""With Friends Like These"", this concert never fails to please.  I know that this video was shown on Comedy Central a while ago, but it was severely edited.  Here is the full show.  And if this isn't enough Rowan Atkinson for you, and I'm sure it isn't, then check out the Amnesty International concerts he appears in as well.  I'd mention Blackadder, Mr. Bean, and The Thin Blue Line, but I am sure you have them already.  Sit back and enjoy this full hour of a great talent doing fantastic comedy.

874859,5,630443314X,"Though a concert video, this is much more than a stand-up routine.
It's a series of discrete sketches much more akin to Gilda Radner's 1980 GILDA concert than, say, an evening with  Bill Cosby or Chris Rock.  Unlike GILDA, however, which largely recycled familiar characters from another medium, the material here is entirely original.  Indeed, it's so unexpectedly novel that you'll be glad you bought this video, whether you're a rabid Atkinson fan or you've never heard of him.
Perhaps more than any other single work of his, this concert video showcases all of Rowan Atkinson's nuanced talents.  From the sublime ""Welcome to Hell"" sketch in which Atkinson has the duty of being a sort of genteel maitre d'-cum-camp-counselor for recently-arrived souls, to the encore sketch in which he wordlessly and near-proplessly makes you believe he's playing an elaborate drum set plagued by a rambunctious cat, Atkinson's range is put fully on display here.
A concern for non-Britons is whether they'll really understand the humor.  On this score, Atkinson triumphs again, because he's deliberately chosen universal events to build his sketches around.  Of the bits on offer, only two might wade in unfamiliar waters.  One centers around the nature of being a headmaster at a British public (private) school, and the other deals with the difficulty of staying awake during a church service and may not be fully funny to non-Christians.
These possible difficulties aside, Atkinson is far easier to add to your video collection than most comedians, because he deliberately avoids topical humor.  Instead, he crafts timeless sketches that will be just as funny 50 years from now as they are today.",981763200,57,1688,5.157509157509158
