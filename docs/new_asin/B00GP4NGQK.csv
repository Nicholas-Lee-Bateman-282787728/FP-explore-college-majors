6097752,3,B00GP4NGQK,"Good movie. However, VERY VERY poor video quality. It looks as if someone took a cam bootlegged copy, wrapped and packaged it to make it look all nice and pretty and are now selling it.  On the side of the the DVD case its says ""Promotional Copy"".  It leads you to think that the DVD came directly form the studio, distributor or that maybe its a DVD screener,  but its not.  Its a ""cam"" copy of the movie.",1455580800,,406,4.166666666666667

6097770,5,B00GP4NGQK,Heard about this movie and always wanted to watch. Seen it was on Amazon and I must say what a great movie I watched several time and enjoy it as if it was 2001. Kinda reminds me of Noah's Arc just a little older but over all a great movie.,1424304000,,240,3.82
6097771,4,B00GP4NGQK,"Only took the one star off due to this release being a Promotional Copy & the degraded Image Quality & really tight letter-box size WAS a tad distracting.  Which is REALLY a SHAME, because this is a truly a PIONEERING Film for American Black Same Gender Loving Males, for it's time.  This TRULY deserves a PROPER re-mastered Blu-ray Release.",1424217600,3,341,4.762711864406779

6097778,4,B00GP4NGQK,"I love this movie-- the quality of film is not that great. However, given the fact that it's only a promotional DVD and the movie came out so long ago, (self produced by the director) it can be forgiven.",1412640000,,203,4.230769230769231
6097779,4,B00GP4NGQK,"Fabulous Movie, Music and Great Cast. Really enjoyed it!",1409788800,,56,5.333333333333333
6097780,5,B00GP4NGQK,"This movie is a ""classic"" in the fact that it was the first of its kind to tell the story of gay black men during a time when white men were the face of gay culture. It is the precursor of the groundbreaking gay television series, Noah's Arc. This movie's importance in the telling of a part of human history cannot be overstated.",1407974400,3,330,4.253968253968254

6097782,3,B00GP4NGQK,It's the movie but the video and audit weren't  very good.  I still love this movie.,1406937600,,84,4.1875
6097783,5,B00GP4NGQK,"The writer is so gifted. I liked its substance and the characters were brilliant in conveying the specific roles. Hilariously funny, the message is of love is conveyed well - where you don't always get what you want, but sometimes a trick of fate happens when we least expect it. The story line has relevance and periodicity in the gay culture. Cast really complimented each other quite well. Moreover, it is nice to see a race that is so misrepresented and misunderstood portrayed in a volatile way, beyond the hustler who is just looking for only a one night stand; rather, love is the optimal objective.",1404864000,3,606,4.726415094339623
6097784,4,B00GP4NGQK,The movie is great from a material point of view. The film quality of the DVD could have been better. But definitely a worthwhile buy!,1401753600,,134,4.4

6097788,5,B00GP4NGQK,"As his first film, Ian-Polk does an accurate and sympathetic portrayal of four black gays
confronting the conflicts and challenges of being gay.",1393891200,,144,5.304347826086956
6097789,3,B00GP4NGQK,I was not aware this was a promo copy. So that was really disappointing. It needs digital remastering in the worst way. The movie is really good. I LOVE Seth Gilliam.,1392681600,,166,4.387096774193548
6097790,5,B00GP4NGQK,"The things I love most about Patrik's projects are his ability to create likeable characters, tell a great story, build a charming chemistry among the cast and make you so hungry for more...KUDOS",1392163200,3,195,4.9393939393939394

6097793,5,B00GP4NGQK,Cute storyline. Liked the cast especially Rockmond Dunbar & Seth Gilliam ( they had great chemistry). Nice initial film by Patrik-Ian Polk,1389657600,3,138,5.318181818181818
6097794,5,B00GP4NGQK,Great film when it was released. I've waited over 10 yrs for it to be placed on dvd. Finally here.,1388707200,,98,3.95
6097795,4,B00GP4NGQK,"Loved the romance that develops between two of the guys.  Also got into the characters.  Nothing against femme guys, but all of the movies I've seen from this director/producer are mostly about femme guys.  That seems to feed into the stereotype that gay men aren't masculine. Would love to see a romance between two black guys where both are masculine guys.",1388448000,,358,4.836065573770492
6097796,5,B00GP4NGQK,This movie is everything  and love it...please make a part two.. It would mean the world to me and a lot of people,1388448000,,114,3.9565217391304346
6097797,3,B00GP4NGQK,"Recorded poorly.  It needs ""digital remastering"" if possible and a free re-release to those of us who say this crazy little movie which launched Noah's Arc the tv series and it's tag on movie.",1386547200,2,192,4.647058823529412
6097798,4,B00GP4NGQK,"Love the movie, was excited to see it finally came out on DVD after all these years.  However was not so enthusiastic about the quality of the DVD itself.  It resembles the bootleg movies of yesteryears.

Excellent movie though.  I can't get enough of it.",1385337600,4,255,4.6
6097799,5,B00GP4NGQK,"i saw this back in 2000 at the cleveland ohio film festival then patrik gave a q & a after yeap i asked about the soundtrack then got his autograph & ticket stubs which i still have,i luved this movie wishing i'd find someone like darby omg well i got my dvd copy big ups to mr.polk shoutouts from akron ohio.",1384819200,,309,4.081967213114754

8626007,5,B00GP4NGQK,Great movie.,1489104000,,12,5.5
8626008,4,B00GP4NGQK,"This was the first film of Patrik-Ian Polk that i saw. I was drawn to it because of the subject matter and the involvement of Kenneth ""Babyface & Tracey Edmonds. I have tried to keep up with his movies, the most resent being ""Blackbird"". The picture quality could have been a little better, but over all, it does not take away from my enjoy of this film.",1488067200,,354,4.298507462686567

8626010,4,B00GP4NGQK,"This being Patrik-Ian Polk's first movie, I would say it was nicely done.  There are no subtitles nor any other flashy enhancements.  What you see is what you get.  I do like that it had romance, comedy, a dash of drama and healthy relationships between friends.  Seeing Ms. Loretta Devine in this movie was a pleasant surprise.  The movie doesn't have a dark and gloomy ending either.  I hope others give this movie a chance.",1483920000,,426,4.613333333333333
