7993397,3,B00009W36E,"Please disregard my 3 star rating. I had to put something for a rating in order to be able to write this. This listing for this movie got mixed up somewhere along the way. The picture for this item is showing a movie titled Far From Home-The Adventures of Yellow Dog. But the Product Description is for a totally different movie titled simply Far From Home and it stars Drew Barrymore and Matt Frewer. The listing in and of itself is called only Far From Home. That specific title is for the D Barrymore movie, not for the Yellow Dog movie. So before you buy this please contact the seller you wish to purchase this from and ask them which movie specifically that they're selling. Because I was looking for the D. Barrymore movie and when I typed Far From Home Drew Barrymore into the search engine, this came up in the results. So be very cautious before buying this title and be sure to contact the seller you wish to buy from under this listing and ask them which of the two movies they are selling. You don't want to end up getting the wrong movie due to a discrepancy in the listing. Thanks for reading!",1411430400,,1108,4.357487922705314
