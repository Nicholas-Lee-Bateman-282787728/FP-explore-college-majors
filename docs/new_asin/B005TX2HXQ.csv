8496866,5,B005TX2HXQ,Well worth the money! Both Videos are great. Video was just as advirtised. Blu Ray makes it that much better. Shipping was fast.,1349740800,,128,4.608695652173913
8496867,5,B005TX2HXQ,"I bought this blu ray for my husband and he absolutely loves it.  I like it too, I'm not a huge snowmobiler but I loved seeing the beautiful mountains and the music was really cool.  I think the music is played by bands that are local to the area, as I had never heard of them before.  It was worth the money for sure, very entertaining!  Not a lot of blu rays out there like this.",1323302400,,381,3.973684210526316
