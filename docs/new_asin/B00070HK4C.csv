2199516,5,B00070HK4C,"In regards to an earlier review, the King of Queens was not based on any british comedy, but instead on an earlier American show called the Honeymooners.  That's straight out of the director's mouth. So sorry my European friend, Americans do generate all the T.V. shows...well the one's worth watching anyway.

Altogether, this is definitely one of the funniest shows on T.V. to date.  Very underated, but like Everybody Loves Raymond, will prove to be a DVD treasure worth collecting long after the show has gone off the air.  Worth the $34 bucks I spent on it.",1112572800,6,562,4.762886597938144
2199517,5,B00070HK4C,"This is a funny show if you don't want tos ee acting, just comdeiens riffing one ach other.  Most of the jokes are about the wife who ""wants to have a bay-bee"" and the husband who cant ""preform.""  This is very BRITISH kind of humor, Peo_PLE!!  I think this might be a show from Britaint hat they made into an American one.  My friend Brett, who is a genious, says that a lot of our sitcoms have British origins.  Did yo know that the show threes company from the seventes was originally called Robin's Egg?  no, didn't think so.  Most people think that americans create allt he tv shows.  Also on this show is the dad from Seinfeld who is Histerical!!!!  So get this and watch the riffing and the british style comedy!",1110672000,2,718,4.338345864661654
2199518,5,B00070HK4C,"I just received my order a few days ago and haven't quite watched all the episodes, but the ones I have so far have been hilarious.  I have the first two seasons on King of Queens and Kevin James and co. seem to be really getting in the swing of things in their third season.

If you are a fan of the show i would definitely recommend.  If you are not a fan of the show I would say buy this season and you soon will be.",1109894400,8,419,3.793103448275862
2199519,5,B00070HK4C,"Second Season of KING OF QUEENS was good, but the 3rd Season is honestly the best of the series. Every episode is funny, from ""Do Rico"" all the way to ""Pregnant Pause."" The Third Season was probably the best in ratings too, along with many special guest stars (Uncredited on the DVD) like Florence Henderson, Angelo Pagan (Leah Remini's Husband), Eric Roberts, Pat Sajak, Vanna White, Gavin MacLead, Dom Irrera, Ricki Lake, Lou Ferrigno, and the first episode with MADtv's Nicole Sullivan playing Marilyn, (10x funnier role than ""Holly"" currently in Seasons 4-7). ""Paint Misbehavin'"" features the last episode with the character ""Richie"", but this Season includes more of ""Spence"" & ""Danny."" I love this show and can admit it's not getting better with the writing compared to 3rd Season. I want to remember KING OF QUEENS with this excellent DVD. I don't have to mention KEVIN JAMES, LEAH REMINI, or JERRY STILLER, because everyone already knows they are the best...and make the show a hit. This Third Season can represent the entire series.",1109721600,11,1041,4.988505747126437
2199520,5,B00070HK4C,"Doug, Carrie, and Arthur keep on making people laugh with this Third, great season, Some of the best Episodes are on this 3-disc set with Carrie wanting to go back to school, Doug and Deacon on strike, Arthur wanting more freedom from Carrie, and finally the season ending with Doug and Carrie trying to have a baby. This season is extremeley funny, with bust-out laughs and with some very serious moments. All you King of Queens fans will love this, and bet you can't wait for Season 4, and all the other seasons to come out and add to this great  collection of comedy.",1109462400,5,570,4.480769230769231
2199521,5,B00070HK4C,"The King of Queens is a great show. Difference between the honeymooners and the king of queens. The Kramdens live in the depression they don't have anything, Ralph always kicked Norton out of his apartment. Ralph Kramden is really mean. The King of Queens they have everything like a house, furniture, tv set and food in the kitchen.  Doug Heffernan is really a nice guy, he reminds of Babe Ruth and Fred Flintstone. He had three friends Spence since he known he was a kid, Deacon his co-worker from IPS, Danny his cousin who really fit in with the gang.  The King of Queens doesn't also remind of the honeymooners two shows and one movie Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Cheers and American Pie. Doug Heffernan and Spence Olchin is like Xander Harris, Danny Heffernan is Riley Finn, Arthur Spooner is like Daniel ""Oz"" Osborne, Deacon Palmer is Rupert Giles, Holly Shumpert is like Willow Rosenberg on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Doug Heffernan is like Cliff Clavin, Spence Olchin is like Norm Peterson, Arthur Spooner is like Ernie 'Coach' Pantusso, Danny Heffernan is like Woody Boyd, Holly Shumpert is like Carla Tortelli and Carrie Spooner is like Rebecca Howe on Cheers. Doug Heffernan is like Jim Levinstein, Spence Olchin is like Kevin Myers, Deacon Palmer is like Chris 'Oz' Ostreicher, Danny Heffernan is like Paul Finch, Holly Shumpert is like Michelle Flaherty Arthur Spooner is like Jim's Dad on American Pie.",1108684800,3,1412,4.879166666666666
2199522,4,B00070HK4C,"King of Queens is one of those sitcoms that seems to fly just below most people's TV radars.  It remains popular enough that it is now into it's seventh season on CBS and yet has never been a major enough hit that it becomes the topic of water cooler discussions the morning after a new episode.  At it's core this is a working man's, middle-class comedy.  Doug Heffernan (Kevin James) delivers parcels for IPS, and his wife Carrie (Leah Rhemini) is a legal secretary.  They are joined in their suburban Queens colonial by Carries father Arthur (Jerry Stiller) who rooms in the basement.

The show typically centers on the mundane problems that all middle-classers face on a daily basis such as not having enough money, squabbles with neighbors, problems at work, etc.  We all admire Doug for being a rather typical fat slob but somehow being able to land a gorgeous wife like Carrie.  The show is always consistently funny and has a wonderful cast of supporting nut co-stars including Doug's best friend and co-worker Deacon andnebbish mama's boy friend Spencer.  King of Queen's never aims too high and never ventures into dramatic plots as some comedies tend to do.  CArrie always wants to aim for a higher place in society, much to Doug's aggravation, while he is perfectly content to sit on the couch, watch the football game, and eat Doritos.  This tends to set up some of the more hilarious plots.

Notable season Three episodes include:

""Fatty McButterpants"" - Doug finds out that Carrie has been buying his clothes at the ""Big and Tall Shop"" and admits that he may have a weight problem. Carrie tells him that he could stand to lose about 40 pounds. Doug's feelings are upset and he takes it out by nit-picking on Carrie.

""Strike One"" - Doug Goes out and Buys a new SUV despite the fact that a strike is looming at work.  Sure enough a strike happens and an incensed Carrie has to work overtime to pick up the slack.  Spence buys their old car and it promptly drops dead.

""Strike Two"" Doug's sister gets him a job as a substitute teacher at her school which Doug thinks will be a breeze...until he meets his students.

""Strike Out""  Doug and Deacon are down and out due to the strike and turn to Arthur for companionship.  Soon the trio pass the day by pulling pranks on neighbors and yelling lewd comments from the porch to passers-by.

""Work Related"" - Arthur comes to work with CArrie and Carrie is horrified when Arthur is offered a job in her office.

""Wedding Presence""  Doug and Carrie don't want to attend and out-of-state wedding and hatch a plot to faker their attendance, which goes badly wrong!

""Inner Tube""  Doug lies to Carrie to get out of attending a seminar.  His guilt causes him to have some bizarre nightmares where he find himself on old TV shows such as ""The Honeymooners"" and ""Wheel of Fortune""

""Swim Neighbors""  AFter their fence is destroyed in a storm, The heffernan's new, annoying neighbors want to leave the fence down so they can have one hugh combined backyard.  But Doug and Carrie don't like them so they promptly have a new fence built..but they still want to use the neighbors fancy pool.

In addition to the regular Stars, Lou Ferrigno is back playing himself in a recurring role as the Heffernan's next door neighbor.  This really is a fun show.  Always consistently well-written and well-performed by all.",1108684800,15,3357,4.6678023850085175

We're up to about series 4 or 5 on TV at the moment (yeah, takes A LONG time for the programs to reach us here yet Amazon can ship the dvds out within 2 weeks!) and we wanted to start watching the entire show from the beginning.  You see, it was only shown on our tv during the summer non-ratings period.  It's like someone who is born on the 29th Feb only celebrating their birthday on the leap year!  We knew there was more to appreciate!
Series 3 is great, very funny moments, and then a quite sad season finale.

Keep writing funny and entertaining shows which seems to bypass a lot of them these days. Im sure this show will go on for years, but one thing I cannot understand is why this show has never found its way onto prime time TV in Australia.
