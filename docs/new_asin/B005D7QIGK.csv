8466401,5,B005D7QIGK,"I have had a very pleasant experience dealing with Stacy and Marty.  I ordered the Sean Connery's Edinburgh tape from them.
They got the tape to me very promptly and it was packaged quite well.
I had forgotten what vhs tapes were like and made a comment about the quality of it.  Marty is so concerned that I am pleased with my purchase that he is going above and beyond in trying to find another tape for me.  I have tried to tell him that this one is fine, but he is still going to try to find this tape for me.

These are very customer oriented folks and you will not be disappointed in dealing with them.

Thanks for all your help and concern Marty.",1323993600,,653,4.150793650793651
