3414637,5,B0018BEG50,"This DVD is a full length animated features, very fun for kids, suitable for age 6 and up. In the story, a new game show sends young Leo, Jackie, Margaret, and Alex to a remote island. There they will compete against each other in a survival challenge for a chance to win a million dollars. But on the way their plane crashes in an uncharted island, where they are forced to team up to survive. And by the way, there are dinosaurs. T-Rexes, Raptors, Pterodactyls and more dinosaurs are to be found on the island. This show is a fast paced action-adventure movie. This movie is one of those that parents or babysitting teens will not mind watching too. My 13 year old still likes it. Released in 2002 and it is 75 minutes long.

The same animation studio, ""DIC"", has released other titles to video and TV, such as animated versions of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Treasure Island, Globehunters, Zorro, and Dinosaur Island. The last 2 titles are really good. They also made the Archie's movies and the Inspector Gadget. Extras on the disc are Inspector Gadget info and fun facts. DVD quality is good, picture and sound clean, no issues with freezing up or anything.",1262649600,6,1164,4.596153846153846

8269197,5,B0018BEG50,"I get the fun part of it all. Finding the entertainmaent that will keep entertaining my child. So, the big thing now in my household has been dinosaurs. I only thought this would be a phase that would come to an end quickly. But I was wrong. Why? was I wrong because not only are the dinosaurs entertaing, but they have names, and they are very exciting. It allows the ability to learn and enjoy while learning. Then, the dinosaurs enter the home they are leave eaters, or meat eaters, and sometimes both. Then there are days they growl, and then there are days were the creativity, and thought towards it all becomes more than a thought. Because I hear hey, can you find me another movie like that-it was so cool, I like it better than the last one(which of course has to be watched again). Oh sure, I say I will do the best I can. The movie is great, and your child would like it alot just like mine has.",1301875200,,906,4.242774566473988
