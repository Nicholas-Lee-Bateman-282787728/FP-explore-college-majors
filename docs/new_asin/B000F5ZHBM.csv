I wasn't old enough back then to see these films when they were initially shown. There are quite alot of films here. On the first couple of discs they're pretty short. Many are 'silent'...with musical accompanyment. They all have computer generated titles. I'm guessing there were NO titles to begin with? And most will just fade out at the end, without saying 'the end'. As you work your way through the discs, the films get longer...(30 min each) AND with full sound!! The prints look as if they've been sliced with bread knives, but that just adds to their authenticity. I'm sure they've been put through the ringer over the years.

Very good introduction from 'sticky seat' Pete!",1354147200,,743,4.796875
