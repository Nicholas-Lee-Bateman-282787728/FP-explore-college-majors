1852798,5,B00008N72Q,"Loved the female lead in this , she is adorable and makes the whole movie shine. The filming is excellent  quality and the writing on par with any family tale out of hollywood say around 1950s plot style. No grainy cinema or weird over the top stuff just plain adorable in an old fashioned way. My big surprise ,I didn't know that Salman Khan could act that well. I've  only seen him in a few movies so far and he seemed so repressed but that could be a character style of tough guy he was playing and that was fine for those films but he did deliver the goods in this one all out. Full range of emotions and all his acting chops were clear to see.

 This is a very simple tale with some love , tragedy, slight mix up , last minute fix and happy ending . Lots and lots and lots and lots of singing in this one. Definitely chick flick style read in no staged phony fighting. Every once and a while I did fast forward through a song but you know I surprised myself and actually did listen to about 90% of them. This is definitely a family movie and will not offend anyone . The little white dog steals the show as the Hindi version of lassie. Can't really say it any better than the others so why try. Watch and decide for yourself.",1331251200,2,1230,4.1125
1852799,1,B00008N72Q,"After watching about ten brilliant Bollywood films I foolishly bought this one. From the first 5 minutes I hated this. at first I thought it was a comedy. No it is not. It has no redeeming quality.....honestly I could not finish this piece of trash. Well we make a lot of junk...so why not India. Like one reviewer said DO NOT judge Bollywood based on this film.

Update
I gave it another chance 3 years later after watching 50 Bollywood  films. The great sin of this movie is to stuff it with about 30 song and dance numbers with absolutely no subtitles. The plot is pretty simple and just contains a lot of  irrelevant chit chat between 2 rich families who seem to just play all the time. Way too much detail such as watch a family play pass the pillow for about 15 minutes. In short my opinion has not changed;  this is s pretty bad musical. and by the way video quality is poor.",1324857600,,882,4.295180722891566
1852800,1,B00008N72Q,"The movie in absolute fantasy - one of the most tawdry and shallow products of Indian cinema - by the vapid, for the vapid, of the vapid.",1273017600,2,137,4.111111111111111
1852801,5,B00008N72Q,"Hum Aapke Hain Koun is a 3 hour movie that maybe should have been 4 hours long.  Many of the scenes are energetic and move at a blistering pace just to get everything said and done, which is why some might think the acting is lacking.  The actors just are not given time to properly work many of the scenes. Some of the transitions between scenes are so abrupt that we almost get whiplash.  The camera work is very good and the image quality is adequate.  The sound is sub-today-standard and almost poor on 1 or 2 of the songs, but they are great songs.  Be prepared to speed read and watch scenes several times just to see everything. Based on movies that I have seen, at least 10 important later films were influenced by this film.

All that said, I highly recommend this absolutely adorable film for what it is, not what it isn't.  It is a family film.  There is great love between 2 brothers and 2 sisters. True love develops between the couple in the arranged marriage. There is intense electricity between Madhuri and Salmon as their love develops.  There is the Indian version of a pooh-pooh cushion (crunchy chips under a blanket). There is a wonderful subplot where Madhuri and the young girls play the game steel-the-groom's-shoes during the wedding. A little white dog is a cute and important character.  There is a ton of soul lifting laughter in this film as characters and guests laugh at the antics of the main characters.  And, my all time favorite, you never really know for sure who or how many will eventually get married in one of these films.

The negative reviewers do make some points.  If this film were remade with today's sound quality, choreography, film quality and directing it would be a tremendous film. However, it might lose something immeasurable in the process.",1268784000,4,1796,4.62776025236593
1852802,4,B00008N72Q,"This is generally a much loved Bollywood movie released in 1994. I think it has to be assessed within that time-frame.
It has all the simplicity and naivete that Hollywood did in the 50s and early 60s. Its the sort of movie Doris Day would have starred in in terms of nice people and family values. It has scenes such as two whole families sitting in a circle and playing a game of pass the cushion and when the music stops the person holding it has to perform some forfeit piece of poetry or music. Now this tells you something about the times in itself.
It is a long movie and there are many more songs than you tend to get these days. The songs were generally lively but I haven't felt tempted to download them. I did find the movie went on a bit at times though I know not all viewers felt that.
It is a piece that informs a lot about Indian customs with quite long scenes laying out cultural practices around weddings and allied rituals. These are people who put family first and will sacrifice personal desires for family sake. The families intermarried are idyllic except for an aunt who provides selfish, greedy contrast.
I came to Salman Khan movies this millennium and its interesting to see him younger. He is less self-conscious here and dances a lot better. I particularly noted the freer movement around his shoulders and wonder if all the bodybuilding since has locked him up there and restricted his range of movement!
All actors are good and the 2 leads (Salman and Madhuri Dixit) have good chemistry in what is, unashamedly, a building romantic tale.
There is nothing new here but it has its own period charms. For those who don't like sentimental or cute, for art-house cinema lovers and those who only like more real or recent stuff, this may not be for you. However for those who like Bollywood musicals this is one of the best loved in the genre- which won a swathe of awards when it was released.",1234396800,9,1919,4.485714285714286
1852803,2,B00008N72Q,"Bollywood never ceases to amaze me; this is one of those movies where most Westerners (or anybody who doesn't know Indian Cinema) get the wrong idea, because Bollywood is a love or hate relationship kind of deal. I was disappointed with this movie, while it is very very long, it offers an enjoyable 'white love' concept, and the family is always first message, and we all have our duties reminder; but it ends to be too childish, silly, and  unfortunately, Madhuri doesn't dance to the extent of her abilities. One thing I liked is seeing Salman so dark! was he suntanned or what? Also... what's up with the excessive slapping?",1200182400,,628,4.709090909090909
1852804,5,B00008N72Q,"This movie turned out to be one of the highest-grossing Indian movies of all-time, and no wonder - the music is superb [songs & melodies in the traditional Indian style], good casting, and lovely costumes, not to mention a story that tugs at the heartstrings.

The story itself is a typical Bollywood romance/ tearjerker - Prem [Salman Khan] and Nisha [the bewitching Madhuri Dixit] finds themselves falling for each other as Prem's older brother Rajesh [Mohnish Behl] marries Nisha's sister Pooja [Renuka Shahane]. Unfortunately tragedy strikes when Pooja dies shortly after the birth of her first child. The elder males feel that it would be best for Nisha to marry her widowed bro-in-law [common in many traditional societies] so as to provide the motherless child with a loving substitute mommy. Unbeknownst to the other family members, Prem and Nisha are deeply in love, and they decide to sacrifice their love for the sake of the family [another common thread in many Bollywood movies]. The rest of the story deals with what happens to the star-crossed lovers.

Though the plot is not extraordinary, what lifts this movie above the average Bollywood blockbuster is the excellent songs & dances that lend a melodious harmony to the movie itself, whilst not detracting from the actual story. The acting by the cast is credible, and the two leads [Salman & Madhuri] have a genuine chemistry [that is repeated in many other Hindi romances such as Saajan etc].

An entertaining family movie that is sure to warm your heart [just don't expect a typical Bollywood blockbuster that is heavy on violence and low on acting & plot].",1194220800,10,1627,4.974264705882353
1852805,1,B00008N72Q,"As I watched Salman Khan mugging shamelessly from virtually the first frame of the unbearably saccharine beginning of this film, which was even worse than watching the brilliantly talented dancer Mads make a fool of herself, I kept thinking I should reach for the remote and pull the plug; but as an experienced Bollywood film fanatic, I know that often enough a bad beginning is followed by some pretty good stuff ""after the interim,"" so I kept watching.  Incredibly, things got worse and worse as it dragged me along to its inevitable conclusion.

I am not a big fan of Salman Khan, so to be fair, I challenge myself to answer the question, ""If SRK had been playing this role instead of SK, would this have been a better film?""  The answer is almost always yes, and sometimes it's YESSSSS! But in this case, choke, gasp, no. But you wouldn't see him taking a role like this, did you? I'm just really glad I was home alone when I watched it, because my friends and family NEVER might have been turned off Bollywood films for good if they'd seen this as their first sample.

I've read that sometimes a Bollywood film does not have a fully-completed script before it begins production.  It is not clear if this film had one by the end.  It's kind of patched together, and could probably have told its thin and predictable story more effectively if it had been about an hour long.

NOT recommended for newcomers to the otherwise wonderful world of Bollywood!",1168732800,8,1456,4.598455598455598

THIRD HOUR: Prem and Nisha fall EVEN MORE MORE in LOVE than before!!! Try not to laugh when one of the relatives falls down a flight of staris and dies.

FOURTH HOUR (brace yourself, surprise ending): Prem and Nisha are so in love that they decide... to get married!

1852807,5,B00008N72Q,"This is a wonderful movie. The love story for all ages in any country. Prem and Nisha meet when their siblings get engaged in an arranged marriage. They at first tease each other, but eventually realize that they are in love. Then tragedy strikes, Nisha's sister Pooja, after giving birth to a beautiful boy, dies in a stairs accident. The families are grief stricken. They decide that the husband must marry again for the sake of the baby. The father's decide that Nisha will take Pooja's place. Nisha, being unaware that the families have arranged her to be marriewd to Rajesh, believes that she will be married to Prem.
Both lovers decide that for the sake of the families they will hide their love. Here is the traditional notion of sacreficing your happiness for the sake of many others.
This is a classic tale with the songs not only being an excellent breather from the movie, but they are also cute tunes that keep you involved in the story.
This film from Yash Chropra is the first from his family's company that explores the mixture of modern and tradional India. His later films Diwale Dulhania Y Jangege and Kuch Kuch Hota Hai expand the messages and themes begun in this film.
A must see film for everyone that loves love stories.",1056672000,65,1243,4.6289592760181

1852982,2,B00008N72Q,"I really tried to like this, I did. It was too loud, too long, and full of so many unnecessary details, characters, songs, and dialogue that I couldn't sit through the whole thing in one-go. I really like the director when he keeps his movies simple and basic like he did in Vivah, but when he decides to clutter up the story like he did here, the entire movie loses the warmth, charm, and incredible lessons of good values he's famous for. Also, I really disliked the cheap language, and rather risqu (for Bollywood) antics. Not that I'm a prude, but they didn't fit with the theme of the story at all.

As for the performances, Mr. Khan, and Ms. Dixit, did not make me care about them in any way. I didn't find either engaging or the least bit sympathetic. They each have a certain smugness in their screen presence that I resented a lot. An attitude of ""I'm SK, or I'm MD look at me, of course you love me, I don't have to do anything but smile and I'm the best."" Um I'm sorry, but not this girl. To be fair, yes, Ms. Dixit is exceptionally talented, but as for Mr. Khan... I still can't see why he's so popular. He can't dance, his ""acting"" is mediocre at best, and he's average looking without the bulky muscles and terrifying with them.

I think he's an incredible producer, he knows the business of movies probably almost better than anyone in Bollywood, he should really stick to making movies like Chiller Party Gang and stop trying to be a hero. This is considered one of his very best! I agree it isn't the drivel that ""The Bodyguard"" is, but really, if this and now masala like TB is all he wants to do, then I feel bad for the millions and millions of people that spend they're hard earned money to make him richer.

All in all, I hope to see better from both soon. I got this for free with Amazon Instant Video, so watch it like that if you're curious, but DO NOT PAY for it.",1380499200,2,1889,4.256267409470752

The plot was unreal, there was a lot of overacting and it could have been done in half the time. I was sorry to see good actors waste their talents on a silly chick flick.",1377993600,,310,4.362068965517241
1852984,5,B00008N72Q,"I guess it applies to a lot of people in India, mostly everyone's first movie in theater from my class when I was a kid. Great family movie and nice songs. One of the all time popular movies in India.",1376956800,,200,4.025
1852985,5,B00008N72Q,"This movie was unavailable to watch from Netflix and I'm kinda going broke just buying the movies out right on Amazon so I decided to rent it from them instead; it's wonderful! Now, it's climactic-critical scene in the movie is truly heartbreaking and I didn't really like that so much, but if you can rally from such a thing then they did it well. Now, I got the movie because I'm all crazy about Salman Khan and he certainly impresses in this film too! Because all the actors do such great jobs and have such great and equally important roles, his may not seem as prominent at times but even that is a new facet to his acting charm. What was a surprise in this movie for me was how much I enjoyed Madhuri Dixit in her role. I've seen her in a few other movies and she was good but nothing in those rolls really captured my heart, but she did in this one. She plays it to perfection. She was just so natural and yet so charmingly sweet and funny. In the scenes with the baby, she really came across as a loving mother. It was truly a beautiful sight. Speaking of which, Salman Khan looked like a wonderful loving uncle; in line to be a great dad. Now as for the movie feed itself, on my computer full screen did not fully cover my computer screen. I had a rectangle with a broader rectangle boarder on the outside. It was annoying but I still enjoyed the movie. You should also know, that for whatever reason, sometimes all the characters in a scene did not fully appear on the scene. Sometimes heads where cut off and they where cut in half - again frustrating. And finally, the opening song and the last song where not subtitled in English. Now with all that said, I loved the movie and would recommend it and it's rental from Amazon!",1373328000,,1737,4.298780487804878

The rest of it ain't bad either.",1369526400,,162,4.433333333333334
1852987,3,B00008N72Q,It's a cute movie but quite lengthy of one wedding and a lot of chitchat.  Some of the dances were entertaining. It's about love and family with lots of joy and happiness that goes along in this movie.,1366416000,,201,4.2894736842105265

1852989,5,B00008N72Q,"I am slowly working my way backwards from the most recent of Salman Khan's movies and now find myself in the 90's.  I'm going to say upfront that I was an instant fan and based on my readin ,he has starred in most of the top grossing Bollywood films in the last 20 years. So starting with Ek Tha Tiger ..I have watched in reverse.  I have to say that Hum Aapke Hain Koun pull all the pieces of Hindi romance, culture, and song together in this movie.  The more contemporary films had some elements - this film has it all.  I loved the story of love, sacrifice, and family. I enjoyed the courting and the wedding and the baby shower scenes, and the humor - all so wonderful  !  I thought the costumes and the haircuts were on target for the time period - unlike some other Bolly films where I wondered how did the costumer for Anne of Green Gables end up in India... and why are they wearing Satin and Lace ? Even so, I find the genre refreshing and just a good way to spend 3 hours...lol.

If you have a short attention span ( 90 minutes or less) then stay away from Bollywood - you won't make it.  But if you can and you want to start watching...Hum Aspke Hain Koun is a good place to start to introduce you to what you will see in coming movies - once your are hooked - you're hooked !

And yes, the picture quality wasn't that great, and yes, the subtitles dropped in and out and word usage was often off - but you got the message and it wasn't enough for me to say I won't watch it again.  Actually watching on the computer isn't bad - the movie doesn't pixelate. Oh and there's no intermission in this one so - just press stop at the halfway mark.",1355788800,4,1652,4.10248447204969

The choreography and music were excellent, the costumes were lovely and vibrant, and the cinematography was beautiful.
