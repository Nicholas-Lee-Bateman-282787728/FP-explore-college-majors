8107474,1,B000E8RGAK,"This initial feature film made by Galician director Jorge Coira is solidly anchored at the bottom of Coira's output, placed there by an inordinate shallowness of style and, notwithstanding some camera cleverness, a dreary emphasis upon usage of foul language by virtually the entire cast, not one of whom offers a winning performance, not unexpected in the event, due to the script's tired plotting, and less than effective characterization.  The storyline revolves about the tedious actions of Fran (F&eacute;lix G&oacute;mez) who has recently completed nine years of college study while having no clear concept of the career path that he wishes to follow.  Although his fianc&eacute;e Ana (Ver&oacute;nica S&aacute;nchez) has no difficulty with organizing his future as also do his parents with whom he resides and who point Fran toward a ""business"" occupation, against their son's fervent wishes.  The Spanish word for ""tick"" is garrapata and a viewer is apparently being expected to feel a dollop of sympathy for Fran during his attempts to achieve a tick-like or ""slacker"" lifestyle, as he sponges off his parents.  Fran's closest support comes from his friend Morgan (Javier Veiga) who believes himself to be a sort of master slacker.  The director apparently attempts to demonstrate, with only fair results,  that Fran is some type of universal figure, but the plotline does not generate adequate enough interest to avoid its being classified as merely a banal melodrama.  Additionally, Morgan's behaviour becomes increasingly erratic as the piece progresses, putting paid to his previous sophistic rambling, during the film's first pages.  It is clear that Coira is a skilful technician, but one who requires a more substantive tale to tell than this.",1402272000,,1759,5.3478260869565215
