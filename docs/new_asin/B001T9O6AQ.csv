8340882,5,B001T9O6AQ,"I'm a homeowner who like to do backyard projects with natural stones. I have made a natural stone waterfall and a flagstone patio before. I'm always amazed that people can make rocks using cement and use these man-made rocks to build a waterfall / pond.

This is a home made DVD, it doesn't have Hollywood quality video, but it's good enough to me. It has all the information I need. It shows every single step of the process, and lists all the tools/material you will need.  It shows some tricks to make a ""rock' looks realistic.

Now I understand why most man-made-rock waterfalls or ponds are made of round granite boulders, because they are ""relatively"" easier to make. Making a large angular boulder is a lot more difficult, but it must be very satisfying to make one (if it is successful).  I will probably take this challenge someday :)",1376697600,,843,4.6375838926174495
8340883,1,B001T9O6AQ,"Reading the two reviews was not helpful. I still don't know what making rocks is all about. Making a rock with what ? Paper mache, cement , ?",1327708800,,141,4.071428571428571
8340884,4,B001T9O6AQ,"Overall good for an amatuer video. The sound needed to be tweaked. The presenter voice was way too low low and the music way too high.
ALso some of the captions for ingedients,etc were done way too fast with scroll-text.
Learned alot and so far the best video out for this type of craft.
Can't wait till volume2.",1264809600,12,312,4.396551724137931
8340885,5,B001T9O6AQ,This video has inspired me to create a pond and a stream in my backyard.  I wasn't even considering this project until I watched this video and the instructions were so clear and easy to follow that I got very excited about making rocks and boulders in my own garden.  I would highly recommend this video to anyone interested in landscaping projects.,1235260800,14,350,4.629032258064516
