2691591,5,B000KI5T9Y,"When I first tried this DVD I didn't care for it much. I had been using Paul Grilley's Yin Yoga for quite sometime and I liked his style. After spending more time practicing Yin Yoga I went back to Sarah Power's DVD and really like it now :o)

Originally her sequencing seemed a bit off and she was a bit too chatty to my liking. But after discovering the abbreviated audio option, I've discovered the depth of this practice. There are two Yin Practices and she holds each posture for a very nice, long time:
1. Yin Kidney...my favorite. Includes easy forward and backward bends along with wide legged alternate leg forward bending and twists. The audio portion of this practice is quite nice and I like to listen to the non-abbreviated version.

2. Yin Liver. Includes forward and backward bends for your liver meridian. She is very spiritual and tells ""stories"" about life situations drawing from Buddhist themes on suffering (dharma talk). I like this practice of the abbreviated audio since listening over and over became old.

Also included are two Yang style practices (Sun Salutations or Vinyasa Flow).

You can add a Savasana and Meditation to any of the practices. The Savasana is absolutely lovely and relaxing. The meditation is very good for everyone (even beginners) and definetly will give you more ""insight"" into your own being. I love this meditation!

All of these segments can be played individually, or you can choose from 10 different canned sequences that run anywhere from 1 hour to almost 2 hours in length. The DVD menus are very well designed. In general, this practice will very much help you to listen to your body and get in touch with your internal world. It is a nice addition to my collection.

Namaste'

2691592,4,B000KI5T9Y,"For those who have never attended any of Sarah's classes, it's a wonderful introduction to Yin Yoga. Even long-time followers/students like myself can benefit from watching this comprehensive video. I particularly liked the kidney and liver sequences. Sarah is much more charismatic in person though...",1376006400,,302,5.733333333333333

2691594,4,B000KI5T9Y,"I was looking for some new yoga sequencing & postures.  Although a lot of the DVD involved Sun Salutations, Sarah adds some interesting twists to the usual moves.  Met my needs.",1362787200,,177,4.67741935483871
2691595,3,B000KI5T9Y,"I like the concept and I like the practice(s), but there are a lot of things that annoy me about this DVD which isn't conducive to meditation/relaxation.  First of all, she talks kind of like William Shatner; stops mid sentance, seems like she has to think about where she's going in the middle of the sentance.

She also uses the proper yoga terms for many of the poses, without always explaining or using the English words.  This makes what would otherwise be not so difficult poses kind of cumbersome because you have to look up at the TV to see what she's talking about in the middle of your flow.  If you are very advanced at yoga and have attended many classes where they use the formal terms then maybe you would like that aspect, but even if you practice yoga regularly and your teacher uses the English terms this can leave you frustrated.

Additionally, she uses human anatomy terms that I have completely forgotten since my freshman year anatomy classes.  I don't have the muscles and bones memorized anymore, so if she's telling me I should feel a stretch in some muscle or move some bone I'm not readily familiar with, I get frustrated.

Lastly, for the meditation, she makes you sit through several minutes of explanation as to what meditation is all about, which would be fine if there was a sort of appendix selection where you could find this, but very annoying in the middle of a sequence.

So... I like the idea, I like the sequences, I like the meditative aspect, but the instructor is very annoying!!",1360800000,5,1521,4.586715867158672
2691596,5,B000KI5T9Y,"Yin yoga is akin to guided stretching and for some reason getting beyond a need for coaching in this regard isn't a hurdle I've tackled.  Sarah brilliantly lengthens my everything in this DVD , especially my fluid peace of mind.  I recommend this yoga DVD which contains both aggressive yang flows as well as two ingenious yin sequences to all of my clients.  The inclusion of a savasana and guided meditation with the ability to construct your own class from the above options makes a complete package.  I love this DVD.",1332633600,7,521,4.6923076923076925
2691597,5,B000KI5T9Y,"Sarah Powers DVD has many different
classes on this one DVD.  I am enjoying
doing one a day and there are at least
2 weeks of classes.  Some are long
and some as short as 10 min.  Several
have a meditation at the beginning.
The Yin Yoga I use for my joints and
connective tissue as she asks you to
hold each pose 5 min.  She is talking
and explaining while you hold the pose.
The time goes quickly.  I will buy the
other one when I finish this one.
I have been doing yoga for 20 years and
this would also be good for beginners.
Thanks Amazon for carrying this very
useful DVD.

It is o'k,she is nice, instructve fluent, but there is nothing more. I miss the inner fire and the  sense of visual beauty of Shva Rea. Neither i saw there the dryish, but convincing attitude of J.J Gormly in her Yoga for everybody, nor the burning belief in his principles of Paul Grilley in his Yin yoga. With these teachers as neighbours, Sarah Powers rarly leaves the shelf.",1257897600,5,493,4.72093023255814
2691600,5,B000KI5T9Y,"A wonderful fusion of Yin/Yang Yoga, Traditional Chinese Medicine and Buddhist Philosophy. Sarah's voice and insights inspire you, and the Yoga sequences are easy to follow and adaptable for all levels of Yoga. There are different sequences recommended depending on your energy levels and how you are feeling emotionally to help create balance. A nice option once you are familiar with the poses is to have less commentary which works well with the Yin Yoga Poses where you are melting into the poses from 3-5 minutes. This DVD includes sequences to balance the physical and emotional energies of the Kidney, Bladder, Liver, and Gall Bladder meridians.",1257033600,6,652,5.160377358490566

2691602,5,B000KI5T9Y,"I had been taking yin classes at a local studio and enjoyed them very much, however I believe that I hurt myself doing yin practice and have since stopped.  I was never able to stick with the yin practice on this DVD.  I do however love Sarah's vinyasa practice on this DVD.  I love vinyasa flow practices, however I don't care for the rushed pace of many vinyasa DVD practices.  Sarah's vinyasa practice moves slowly however that does not mean it is easy!  It is very challenging.  When I practice without DVD this is the same speed I prefer to practice at to follow my slow ujjayi breathing.  It feels less like calisthenics at this pace.  I highly recommend this DVD.  I consistently use this to practice when I don't feel inspired to lead myself through practice.  Sarah does talk a whole lot on this DVD, however you have the option to cut a lot of that out.",1248134400,8,863,4.405063291139241
2691603,3,B000KI5T9Y,I tried this DVD once and immediately resold it on Amazon.  There was way too much talking and explaining in this video and no way to do a practice without having to listen to the same explanations over and over again.  This made the routines unnecessarily long without having the benefit of actually doing poses.  I was very disappointed with this DVD.,1246752000,6,353,4.661290322580645
2691604,4,B000KI5T9Y,I was looking forward to this DVD.  It is well worth it's money for all the material offered.  I was looking for the yin practice particularly. These are wonderful. There is no music during class and it is very slow paced. I think you need extra help for staying power when you are going it alone especially if you are a beginner.  Yet the practices themselves are truly excellent.,1237334400,7,381,4.492753623188406

2691606,4,B000KI5T9Y,"This is the first time i've taken time to write a review of a product.  I highly recommend this dvd.

You can group the yin, savasana, meditation and hatha practices together to customize your practice- to vary your practice from 20min to 2 hours.  It's the most flexible yoga dvd i've purchased- pun intended.

Also like that you can choose whether to listen to detailed instructions or listen to the abridged version, which is a function of Paul Grilley's great yin yoga dvd.",1227657600,8,477,4.710843373493976
2691607,4,B000KI5T9Y,"In this DVD, yoga instructor Sarah Powers offers a unique blend of yoga practices.  As she explains, her work strives to integrate the Yogic and Buddhist traditions and to encourage balance by providing both Yin practices, which are more receptive, and Yang practices, which are more active.  Given this, the DVD includes six main practices:  two active flow practices, two Yin practices, savasana, and meditation.  In all of the sequences, Sarah is leading a class of 7-8 participants, each of whom are practicing the postures at different levels.  Sarah frequently walks around the class performing adjustments, and she encourages modifications as well.

The Main Menu of the DVD is set up to allow the user to select Vinyasa Practices, Yin Practices, Savasana & Meditation, Guided Sequences, and Special Features (includes Sarah's Biography, Teachers, and other info).  I have broken down each segment as described below.

VINYASA PRACTICES
In each of these practices, Sarah places a strong emphasis on focused breathing, particularly integrating the prana from the upper half of the body with the lower.
1. Sun Salutation Practice (40 mins.)  Here Sarah methodically leads the class through a slow and deliberate series of sun salutations.  Each round includes a different lunge variation, ending with hanumanasana (splits) in the final round.  Sarah adds some strength moves, such as chaturanga repeated three times in a row, as well as some other unique variations, such as a simple locust with the legs moving in and out.
2. Vinyasa Flow (55 mins.)  The first 15 minutes of this series opens with a very slow round of sun salutation B.  Sarah then instructs what she calls a standing sequence flow.  Staying all on one side, she leads the class through warrior 1, warrior 2, reverse warrior, and then a series of variations which move between intense side stretch and warrior 1; this was a physically demanding series which really worked the glutes.  She finishes with revolved triangle and standing split before moving to the other side.  Next comes some simple backbending with a locust series and camel, and then the practice finishes on the floor for a reclined hand-to-foot series and happy baby pose.

YIN PRACTICES
A 7-minute ""Notes on Practice of Yin Yoga"" precedes these practices; Sarah explains the three principles of Yin Yoga (finding edge, practicing stillness, and holding poses a long time).  During the Yin practices, Sarah weaves in talk of Buddhist theory and includes stories and anecdotes; however, both practices also include an ""abbreviated audio"" option.  Most postures are held for five minutes.
1.  Yin Kidney (49 mins.)  This practice focuses on the Kidney/Urinary channels, which means that the emphasis on backbending postures; simple twists are included as well.
2.  Yin Liver (57 mins.)  This segment, which address the Liver/Gallbladder meridians, focuses more on hip-opening postures.  However, this practice also includes a few backbends, twists, and forward bends.

SAVASANA.  This is an 11-minute sequence that can be added on as an option to the vinyasa practices.  It includes both spoken guidance from Sarah and time for silent reflection during the second half, which includes a singing OM chant.

MEDITATION.  Sarah begins this 31-minute segment with a 7-minute introduction to meditation practice.  She describes the three stages of meditation--outer, inner, and innermost--and explains how these stages move from the most basic, mainly focusing on the breath, to the more complex, involving other sensations.  She also reviews the three inner attitudes involved in meditation (impartiality, non-judgmentalness, and cultivating interest).  In the final 10 minutes of the meditation practice, Sarah's talking becomes less frequent, allowing more time for silent reflection.

In the DVD's liner notes, Sarah offers tips for how to sequence the practices to best suit your needs on a particular day.  However, the DVD also includes a ""Guided Sequences"" section, which contains 10 pre-arranged practices ranging in length from 60 to 154 minutes.  Sarah encourages the user to listen to one's own experience to chose how to best use this DVD.  Overall, this DVD provides an excellent introduction to Yin Yoga with the additional option of more traditional vinyasa practice, although those who are used to more fast-moving ""power"" vinyasa yoga may not appreciate Sarah's more methodical style; similarly, some might find Sarah to be overly chatty during the Yin practices.  Personally, I found Sarah's voice to be soothing, and I thought that her storytelling added a distinctive element to the sequences, but I did find the Yang practices to be a bit slow for my liking.  I would recommend this DVD to all levels of yoga practitioners who are interested in experiencing Sarah's unique approach.",1219708800,68,4838,5.284031413612565
2691608,5,B000KI5T9Y,"This is the very best Yoga video I have ever purchased for a home practice. After using the exercises on this DVD for about a year now, I can clearly see the need for a Yin practice as part of any serious yoga practice. The meditative postures release your spirit in a way no other form can deliver and Sarah Powers insights are right on. There is so much on this DVD (even some complimentary vinyassa sequences) that you may never need to buy another yoga dvd. Great job Sarah! I highly recommend this DVD.",1208736000,12,507,4.347368421052631
2691609,4,B000KI5T9Y,"I originally bought this dvd for its fertility enhancing yin practices.  But, after a few hectic days at work, I discovered another more immediate benefit. I went through one of the two(liver or kidney) yin practices and I literally became completely relaxed, almost falling asleep. Coming from a person with stressed induced insomnia, this is an amazing feat. Beyond the beneficial relaxation, Sarah brings you deeper into the thinking behind the poses, not only from a spiritual Buddhist perspective but the physical connections of the Chinese meridians.

It's well worth the money. You receive several individual classes or sequences based on your ailment of the day. This adds up to more than $100 worth of yoga classes at a studio but now at your own time and pace.",1186963200,18,770,5.0078125
2691610,4,B000KI5T9Y,"I really felt this product was inspirational for my own yoga practice.  Although I haven't watched the whole thing, the first 40 min segment I watched left me feeling very relaxed and wanting to repeat it. I highly recommend it.",1180915200,4,228,4.7
2691611,5,B000KI5T9Y,"Highly highly highly recommended for those looking for a deep and deeply nurturing practice that really spans many features of the body-mind path, including Taoist / Chinese medicine teachings, Buddhist teachings, of course yoga, and just everyday life. She is a lovely and skilled guide. Very rich tool and treat.",1177200000,8,314,5.3
2691612,3,B000KI5T9Y,"Sarah Powers has put together wonderful sequences. My only complaint would be that her voice after awhile starts to irritate, it is the same tone and very slow through out the DVD. She also says some of the chinese info. incorrectly. To date Paul Grilley's Yin Yoga is by far the best. His voice is excellent. I also love Donna Helm-Yost's- Flow and Yin: A Balance Yoga Practice. Have a beautiful day :)",1173484800,28,403,4.534246575342466
2691613,4,B000KI5T9Y,"I usually do vinyasa/power yoga, but I was looking for something a little more soothing. It's a good change of pace for me. It helped me focus more on the inside--my breath, my awareness, etc., and it has eased a lot of the anxiety and resentment I was feeling about the break-up of my last relationship.",1161907200,7,304,4.446428571428571
2691614,5,B000KI5T9Y,"I've had this DVD for about 3 months now and use one of the practices on it at least twice each week.  I like the way the vinyasa routines focus heavily on breath and form, while the yin sessions allow me to relax and refresh on days I am seeking a less vigorous practice.  Admittedly I am still a relative newbie to yoga, but I find that all of the practices on this DVD add value to my home practice.  I have found many yoga DVDs out there, but most seem to offer sessions that last longer than an hour.  I don't always have that much time to devote to my daily practice and the practices on this DVD help with that since they are all an hour or less.

All in all, I highly recommend this an addition to your library if you have a regular home practice.",1161820800,9,755,4.040268456375839
2691615,4,B000KI5T9Y,I'm really enjoying Sarah's Insight Yoga DVD even though I'm actually only doing the yin yoga sets.  I like that she breaks down different sets to go with various meridians.  I find her commentary especially good!  I have recommended this to several yoga friends. I,1161302400,5,265,4.844444444444444
2691616,4,B000KI5T9Y,"Ms. Powers is a good guide.  I enjoy her Yin section of this DVD, as she does a very good job and am pleased that she includes some thought to the Buddha's teachings as she goes along. It is only my personal opinion that her Yang section of the DVD is of a lesser quality than I was expecting from her and that is why I only gave it a four star.  However, the DVD is well worth purchasing for any sincere student.",1161302400,9,413,3.963855421686747
2691617,4,B000KI5T9Y,"I took a weekend workshop with Sarah Powers a few years ago in Washington, DC and love the Yin practice. I love this DVD and love to listen to Sarah's words of wisdom.

Her yang practice is great as well.",1161216000,3,355,4.235294117647059
2691618,5,B000KI5T9Y,"Sarah Powers is incredibly knowledgeable and articulate, clearly having a background in physiology/anatomy as well as eastern philosophies.  Her teaching style is gentle and reflective but the practice is strenuous and cathartic.  You get a physical workout as well as insight as the title suggests.  The DVD has both Yin and Yang style practices and recommendations for when each may be appropriate for you  - the DVD is flexible in that it lets you pick and choose which practices you want to do that day.  I think that's why it may stand the test of repeated viewings - unlike some others.  For beginners or advanced practitioners  - I highly recommend this DVD.",1161216000,13,665,4.883928571428571
2691619,5,B000KI5T9Y,"I have this DVD as well as the Paul Grilley DVD, and the Erin Fleming CD.  I like them all.  If you are interested in yin practices you might find they complement each other.

Some days I gravitate towards one, and other days to another.

The Buddhist orientation on Sarah's, with her focus on breath work, makes her yin practices very soothing.  Paul's are a bit more yang, though there is gentleness there, too.  Erin's CD is very balanced and peaceful.  (If you're new to Yin Yoga you may want to start with the two DVDs and once you get familiar with the poses try Erin's CD, as there are no visuals to guide you.)

Both DVDs are full of options and excellent values.

(BTW, I love Sarah's Savasana with the chanting.)",1154736000,7,722,4.409090909090909
2691620,4,B000KI5T9Y,"I am fairly new to yoga but wanted to get a DVD that focused on yin yoga after attending a yoga workshop on yoga for dancers.  The workshop highlighted the benefits of yin yoga as well as the vinyasa style.  I have not found many DVDs that offer yin yoga.  When I saw that Sarah's DVD offered both the yin yoga and vinyasa style, I figured this was the DVD for me.  I had considered purchasing Paul Grilley's DVD, but really liked the different options this DVD had to offer.

I've been using the DVD for a few months now and I do enjoy it.  I like that the DVD tells you which sequence to use depending on what you are looking to improve in your life which ranges from decreasing fear or resentment to balancing an overactive day.  There are only a few things that I would suggest could have been improved.

In the savasana relaxation sequence that is offered, I find the chanting (the Tibetan mantra Om Mane Padme Om) that is used annoying.  I'm sure this appeals to many people, but is not my style.  I tend to end my session early so I don't have to listen to it.  Also, as one of the other reviewers mentioned, the stories that are told in the yin yoga do get a bit annoying after you've listened to them several times.  It is good that they offer the option to not listen to these stories with these sequences.  Might have been nice if they could have added some music here, but not having that let's the user select music they might like.  Also, many of the sequences they offer are very long.  If I have time to do yoga, I usually only have an hour.  Most of the sequences offered are much longer then this.  I wonder who has time to do these all at once.  The good thing is you don't have to do the sequences and can just opt to do a practice.

All in all it is a very good DVD that I continue to use and am happy that I bought.",1150502400,46,1837,4.109550561797753
2691621,5,B000KI5T9Y,"I think the negative review of the other customer is, unfortunately, very short sighted.  Maybe I am biased because I took a weekend workshop with Sarah & Ty Powers a few years ago in Atlanta and have been FOREVER CHANGED as a result.  I love this DVD and love to listen to Sarah's words of intuitive wisdom.  I continue to be awed by her magnitude as a teacher and a student of yoga and of Buddhism. There is a reverance about Sarah that continues to astound me and I cannot wait to meet her again.  If you came to this page out of interest in Yin Yoga or Sarah Powers or Paul Grilley, I strongly urge you to buy this DVD.  You will not be disappointed. And once you have done that, take it the next step and go on retreat with her.  The momentum of your own personal path will gain rapid speed after spending time with this beautiful soul.",1142899200,10,841,4.192546583850931

DVD offers a sequencing feature so you can go through yin, meditation and savasana or many other sequences without having to adjust your DVD. So far I've only done the yin practices and I didn't like the meditation that I tried but I love her long savasana. This DVD was very thoughtfully prepared and more than worth the investment.
