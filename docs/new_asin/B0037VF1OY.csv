5014737,4,B0037VF1OY,"I found TWA Flight 800 to be riveting but had a nagging concern that the presentation was unbalanced.  Although the producers raised a host of valid unanswered questions, it seemed to me that they had cherry-picked the information they presented.  I enjoy a good conspiracy theory as much as anyone, but it strains credulity that any cover-up could have lasted so long given the seeming inability of our government to keep secrets.",1408579200,2,431,4.972222222222222

5014740,5,B0037VF1OY,"Incredible film detailing immense fraud and deception to cover up what appears to have been the shooting down of TWA flight 800. The film is extremely objective, using only eye witness testimony, forensic evidence, and interviews with lead investigators. REALLY thorough job. Highly recommend.",1395964800,15,293,5.681818181818182
5014741,5,B0037VF1OY,"I am a lawyer and I do not consider myself a gullible person.  I don't believe in UFO's, 9/11 conspiracy, or any other kook stuff you see on the ""history"" channel.  But this movie had me convinced that there was an NTSB cover-up, and I hope someday there can be an answer to the questions it poses, for the good of the victims' families.

First of all, this is not a conspiracy theory movie, because a conspiracy theory would give an explanation of the alleged dark motives that caused the events  to occur.  Instead, this movie presents the producers' theory of what occurred, without speculating on the motives.  And I believe that their theory comports with the evidence.

When two pilots testify that they witnessed a missile attack while they were in the sky flying their aircraft, and then that missile attack is corroborated by hundreds of witnesses on the ground, that is a pretty good indicator.  As a trial lawyer, I am well aware of how witness recollections can be faulty.  But these statements appear to be consistent with each other.  Then you have crash investigators on film from a variety of agencies, who believe that physical evidence of the debris corroborate their account.  Then you also have radar data which appear to show a high velocity explosion consistent with a missile attack, not a low velocity explosion.

Then you listen to the explanation of the NTSB and the CIA.  When I heard the government version of events, I was even further convinced of the film's viewpoint.

Like I said, I am not one for believing in conspiracy theories.  So take it from me; the people shown in this film are worth your attention.",1392508800,29,1641,4.708771929824562
5014742,5,B0037VF1OY,"For those who doubt the conclusions of those whose job it was to find out what happened and why so that such ""accidents"" can be prevented in future, this movie will provide some small relief. It goes into detail; those who doubt don't need explanations about what is covered.

I hope this movie may cause a new investigation, which is needed quickly, not just for the families of those who died but for all of us so that we might be able once again to trust the NTSB, and so that those who have obstructed justice can be dealt with, and so that those who caused the crash can be identified,  and so that the way will be opened to preventing something similar from happening again.

A crime happened. Another crime covered up what happened. This cannot be allowed to stand.",1385942400,10,772,4.460992907801418
5014743,4,B0037VF1OY,"TWA Flight 800 tells an important story that has been told repeatedly before but needs to be told again because, as Andr Gide remarked, ""since nobody listens we have to keep going back and beginning all over again.""  On July 17, 1996, TWA 800 was shot down by two or three missiles off the coast of Long Island just over an area where, according to James Kallstrom who headed the FBI team that illegally usurped authority for the investigation from the NTSB, the US Navy was conducting classified maneuvers and the ship closest to the crash site fled instead of searching for possible survivors.  Needless to say, the transformation of a missile shoot-down into a fluke unexplained fuel explosion of the center wing tank (CWT) required ignoring or intimidating over a hundred eyewitnesses who saw the missile hit TWA 800, altering the plane's black boxes, hammering the fuselage to make the explosion appear to come from the inside, concealing radar tracks and residue from explosives, and much more.  All the damning evidence of the truth that could not be altered had to be lost or destroyed even while the FBI and CIA fabricated other evidence to support the Official Story; and did so in collusion with a media both compliant and corrupt.  This DVD admirably provides enough of the details to reveal the cover-up and prove the missile shoot-down, but is remarkably respectful and even deferential to the US government that it proves did this dark deceit.

The case for both a missile shoot-down and FBI/NTSB cover-up was made compellingly by the film's co-producer, Tom Stalcup, in his 2002 petition to the NTSB (National Transportation Safety Board).  The petition used to be available on the FIRO website he ran (Flight 800 Independent Researchers Organization), but sadly the entire previous website content has been taken down and replaced by ads for the present DVD and a new petition to the NTSB.

In 2002, Emmy award-winning journalist Kristina Borjesson published her essay ""Into the Buzzsaw,"" in a book of the same title subtitled ""Leading Journalists Expose THE MYTH of a FREE Press."" Because she tried to tell the truth about the crash, she was fired from CBS without ceremony and essentially banned from ""respectable"" media though she went on to co-host a talk show on WBAI with ex-DEA agent Michael Levine who exposed the CIA's world-wide drug running.

In 2003 Jack Cashill and James Sanders published a book of brilliant investigative reporting, ""First Strike: TWA Flight 800 and the Attack on America,"" which detailed the mechanics of the government cover-up from top to bottom.  Sanders had an inside track because as an ex-police officer turned investigative reporter he worked directly with TWA whistleblower Terrell Stacey who illegally took parts of the downed airliner (believing that it was legal to do so) and was then squeezed by the Department of Justice to give false testimony that allowed the DOJ to frame and convict Sanders and his wife Elizabeth for federal felony ""conspiracy.""  Sanders later successfully sued the FBI and DOJ and seven named individuals therein in a civil suit that alleged 32 specific malfeasances to which they offered no defense.  The military knows exactly what happened because their ships and submarines were in the immediate vicinity and because they also had an Orion P-3 intelligence-gathering airplane within a few miles of the explosion, about which they lied in spades, so the rest of us have been put in the awkward position of trying to infer from publicly available facts just what did occur, and why.

Thus, the following claim on the cover of the DVD is for marketing purposes only.  ""Now, a team of insiders from that investigation comes forward in this feature documentary to present new evidence and uncover what really happened to TWA Flight 800.""  This team has been trying its best to be heard for over a decade; it has something very important to say, and this DVD does a good job of saying it.

One notable weakness of the DVD is its unwillingness to state the obvious, viz. that from the outset the ""investigation"" was nothing but a massive and cynical cover-up of the cause of the crash.  The film assumes that even given the fact that the USG engineered this massive deceit of the American public, it deserves our trust and respect and faith that it did so for good and honorable reasons, much as does almost every critical book ever written about the Warren Commission Report.  Cashill and Sanders do not have such a benign view: they hold the Clinton administration responsible for covering up an act of terror by Al-Qaeda, specifically confederates of since-convicted WTC93 bomber Ramsi Yousef who was then on trial, in order to avoid turbulent political waters for the November 1996 elections.  Cashill in particular believes that 9/11 might have been prevented had only the act of terrorism been acknowledged and appropriate protective measures been put in place.

A few weeks ago, after viewing the film on EPIX before its DVD release, I phoned Tom Stalcup at the contact number listed on the FIRO website.  He must receive many unwelcome calls, but he seemed especially terse and reluctant to discuss the DVD with me after I asked why it made no mention of the fact that the ship closest to the crash site fled away instead of trying to engage in helpful rescue, and I spoke of it as a Navy vessel.  So I had to rush a question before he ended it, and asked, ""Don't you think that there was a massive, deliberate cynical cover-up of the cause of the crash of TWA by the government.""  He responded, ""No, of course I don't, but I appreciate the call.""  Not to spoil the DVD, but it ends with Stalcup giving what is called the ""smoking-gun,"" i.e., radar of TWA exploding with fragments being blown away at speeds of Mach 3-5, while the Official Story of a low energy CWT explosion could not generate speeds of even Mach 1 (speed of sound).  Stalcup may have done all his heroic work on TWA 800 managing to keep himself sequestered in a tiny tide-pool of self-protective thought, i.e., the TWA 800 investigation is an unusual aberration that must have occurred for some greater good.  Since Tom Stalcup is a physicist, he and viewers of this DVD would profit from the 911 Speakout site of physics teacher David Chandler and its even much better documented proofs of controlled demolition of WTC7 and the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001.  Jack Cashill has written that TWA 800 is the road to 9/11 and it may well be, but if so certainly not as he intends.

Although the publicly available evidence does not permit a decisive opinion about whose missiles shot down TWA 800 and why, given what is known about 9/11, the internal explosive charges that caused most of the damage to the Murrah Building in 1995, and the 1992 forced removal by FBIHQ of FBI agent provocateur Emad Salem after he insisted on building a bomb with inert powder instead of actual explosives so that his successor could facilitate a working truck bomb for the WTC93 event, it would be premature to rule out TWA 800 as one more effort to provoke Clinton into war in the Middle East, beginning with Iraq (as CIA-neocon spokeswoman Laurie Mylroie and others attempted with both WTC93 and OKC), or Iran.",1385337600,30,7258,4.832258064516129

5014753,5,B0037VF1OY,"When this first happened, the early news coverage I watched included the ground eyewitness reports by two military pilots who both saw a missile rising from the ground, exploding and bringing down the plane. Great witnesses with missile combat experience, but after a day or two, they were no longer allowed to talk about it to the press under threat of court martial. The two pilots were no longer being referenced in the coverage and when they were, we were told that what they really saw was the explosion and break up of the plane. Being former military myself with low altitude missile defense experience, I thought that was strange. This had nothing to do with the military, right?, so why muzzle these two military pilot eyewitnesses? While these pilots are not a part of this film, their initial eyewitness accounts were on my mind while watching this film. The new theory reported on the news was that an electrical spark caused the center fuel tank to explode. Now I knew something was suspicious. Fuel tanks in modern commercial planes do not explode because of 'faulty wiring'. The incident and explanation has gnawed at me ever since.

This film is the first credible investigation of TWA Flight 800 I have ever seen. It is a thorough and thoughtful investigative film that includes the on-camera testimonies of the actual investigators. I found out they were essentially cut out of the process, while the FBI tampered with, and 'disappeared', evidence to fit the evolving fuel tank theory. I was riveted. There was so much I learned from this film that I didn't know because it was never covered by the press then, and at the time, I read everything I could about it. It relieved some of the lingering stress I felt over it all because, from the start, I believed those two pilots. I'm left with only one real remaining question though, and that is; what someone or intellectual something was on that plane that made blowing it out of the air and killing all of those people the best and only option?",1468627200,3,2014,4.721590909090909
