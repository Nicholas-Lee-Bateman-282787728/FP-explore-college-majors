4858972,5,B005QJH440,"Wonderful music and a sweet melodrama with good acting , specially by Monty Woolley.
A wonderful story too! A very young Antony Quinn as the gangster cum financer.",1377561600,5,163,4.857142857142857

4858974,5,B005QJH440,June Haver & Dick Haymes are both at their very best in this 1944 musical and the picture quality and sound are top notch. This is a Region 0 release on DVD.,1368662400,2,157,3.9375
4858975,4,B005QJH440,"I love 1940s Fox musicals so I am a little biased,
and I understand that this is may not be to everyone's
liking. If you are a fan of June Haver and / or Dick Haymes,
there is much to enjoy, especially if you like romantic ballads.

Dick Haymes plays Ernest Ball, songwriter of many popular tunes
of the day. June Haver plays his love interest but does
not perform any musical numbers until the last 30 minutes of the film.
Both are a bit stiff when it comes to acting, but fare much better
as musical performers. A little bit of Monty Woolley goes a long way
for me. Anthony Quinn has the best acting role.

The print that Fox used to make the dvd, looks pretty good.
The colors are rich and vibrant and overall, they did a very nice
job bringing this Technicolor musical to dvd.

There are no dvd extras.",1367107200,15,806,4.220779220779221
4858976,4,B005QJH440,"This is a typical 1940's Fox musical - June Haver, Monty Woolley, Technicolor, nice songs and the most improbable ending in musicals. However, it's fun and harmless and tuneful. Like they say - they don't make 'em like this anymore. But I'm a sucker for the old musicals. Plus the Fox DVD is in a perfect edition.",1366416000,10,313,4.508771929824562
