8682764,5,B00O9ZSIYW,"This episode of Nova revolves around the disappearance of Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 on March 8, 2014.  The program follows both the flight of the Boeing 777 and the investigation and search efforts that followed.

Everything was routine until the flight was handed off from Malaysian ground control to Vietnamese ground control -- that was never established -- for both transponders (devices that send information to flight controllers on the ground) were shut off.  It disappeared from civilian radar completely, so search and rescue teams were sent out to try to find it based on the early evidence, but found nothing.

But it was tracked by military radar and that showed that the 777 changed course a couple of times before moving out of their range some time later.  Someone was flying the thing.  There is also another device onboard many airliners, one that connects to an Inmarsat satellite, which picked up acknowledgement signals from the flight until the following morning, after which it was never seen nor heard from again.

The story of how they narrowed the search area down to the ocean off Australia is complex and fascinating, and Nova does a good job of explaining it.  As we know, nothing has been turned up in over a year of searching.

Nova then turns to the possibility of avoiding such a tragedy in the future; there are already systems that can keep this from happening.  There are plans to fix the transponders so they can't be turned off; there are other plans that would have all airliners tracked continuously by satellites instead of ground radar (which covers only a few percent of the earth's surface), the possibility of streaming (sending out) all the data from the flight recorders during the flight so that finding the black boxes may not be necessary.  All of this holds the promise of making flying a little safer.

As we await the recovery of Flight 370, all of these possibilities are being considered.  There are reasons to implement them and also arguments against them.  Nova does a great job of explaining all of this, talking with many experts throughout the program.",1426809600,6,2116,4.874301675977653
