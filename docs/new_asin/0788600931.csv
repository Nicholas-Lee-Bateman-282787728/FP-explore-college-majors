74846,5,0788600931,"I originally saw this series on The History Channel and was enthralled, disturbed and, ultimately, angry as hell.
This is the least sensational, most clearly presented documentary on the JFK killing I've ever seen.  All of the people interviewed are credible--some you'll recognize--and the program, by the time you reach the fifth and final episode, has so completely destroyed the Warren Commission Report that you'll wonder how this outrageous cover-up has managed to survive this long.
This is first-class detective work, well-presented and--to boot--entertaining as hell.  Every high school kid in America should be required to view this before graduating (I'm glad to see the teacher above is doing so!).
This quiet little documentary--done by the BBC--blasts away the Kennedy assassination myth more effectively than Stone's movie hoped to, as admirable as his attempts were.
And while anybody who's done any reading on the JFK matter is already familiar with who was probably behind it, this program for the first time makes a convincing case as to who the actual shooters were.  The also manage to track down Woody Harrelson's dad in prison for an interview (he has been long considered by many to be one of the ""three tramps"" in Dealey Plaza that day; some even suspect he was one of the shooters).
Truly horrifying and compelling.  A must-see.  I own it, and I will show it to everybody I can.",977961600,44,1404,5.0344827586206895

The class is required of all Seniors and we spend approximately eight weeks on the Kennedy assassination.  We top off the class with an annual Senior Trip to Dallas in the Spring of each year.
This documentary has been a GREAT addition to my class.  Its detail and research based materials enhance my student's perspective of one of the most studied aspects of American history.
I highly recommend this video to anyone interested in the Kennedy assassination!",975283200,6,562,4.822916666666667
74848,5,0788600931,"First aired in 1988, this award winning British documentary, is absolutely essential viewing, not merely for the conspiracy minded, who are already convinced that Oswald could not have acted alone. There are enough  questions raised in the 4 and  hours, to make any intelligent person,  re-consider their preconceptions.  Not just a clever and exceptionally well  researched study of new scientific evidence, interviews with key witnesses  of the fateful event, ignored or discredited by the commission, there is  also a fresh look at the forensic evidence; principally the widely  criticised handling of the autopsy.
There is much to credit here, but  among the more interesting aspects of this film is the photographic  evidence which seems to clearly show a uniformed gunman, standing behind  the grassy knoll. Far from stopping short at this kind of revelation, the  program goes on to name him as a Corsican member of the French connection  Lucien Sarti.
What you will see here forms a cornerstone of much that is  discussed within Crossfire, and the list of people interviewed reads like a  who's who of the assassination. Quite simply unmissable, if you are not  moved to ask questions by the end of this film, YOU- killed Kennedy!",960163200,17,1238,5.115

74850,1,0788600931,"If I could have given zero stars to this, I would have.  For this shameful perversion of what the true facts of the JFK Assassination are (which to put it bluntly, is that Oswald did it and Oswald acted alone) to advertise  it with the title ""The truth shall set you free"" is the biggest  joke imaginable.  Oswald was seen by Howard Brennan firing his last shot.  19 of 20 forensic pathologists say unequivocably that JFK was shot only  twice and from behind.  The overwhelming majority of earwitnesses say only  three shots were fired.  All competent photo experts have authenticated  JFK's x-rays and autopsy photos, and the three ""tramps"" were  identified as nothing more than tramps when the original Dallas police  records were released several years ago.  Oswald murdered J.D. Tippit and  was seen by eleven witnesses doing so.  Oswald had no alibi, saying he was  eating lunch at the time of the shooting with ""Junior"" except  that ""Junior Jarman"" was on the fifth floor at the time of the  assassination and was photographed in the fifth floor window.

I do a review of each one of these in my book Undeniable Truths. Best Wishes- Ed Souza Author of Undeniable Truths-  amazon.com/author/jfkthetruth",1412985600,2,324,5.113207547169812
74864,3,0788600931,"The six part two disc DVD set ""The Men Who Killed Kennedy"" is an interesting series of 6 programs looking at the subject that there was a conspiracy to assassinate President John Kennedy on November 22 1963. In writing this review I am not going to get into whether I agree or disagree with the theories of how the President was killed. I am just looking at how the program and production quality of the shows were. At this point anyone who is old enough to have been alive when Kennedy was killed have by this time made their conclusions whether they believe the Warren report or not. I don't know that this series of programs will change their opinions but I can say regardless of that this is a fairly well made series.

Much of what is covered in this series of programs is not much new. There wasn't a whole lot new theories I found in watching this DVD but it did come up with a surprise or two even for me who has read and followed all the different suggestions of how the assassination occurred. The most well known of the conspiracy theories that is given most coverage here is the combination CIA-Mafia connection behind the shooting. It also looks at the suggestion of a second and maybe even a third gunman taking part in the shooting including one of those gunmen located in the grassy knoll area. One of the surprises I got in watching this DVD set was the theory that the fatal shot didn't come from the side as many believe but from the front. It is suggested that there was a gunman located down in a storm drain shooting from there. I don't know how long that theory has been around but it was new to me and an interesting theory. Of course it also looks at Lee Harvey Oswald, the man accused of killing Kennedy, and whether he acted alone or with others in the assassination or if he was just a patsy to help cover up the crime.

The interviews that are featured though out the series are what make this DVD set so interesting to watch. Some of the people were there that day at Dallas and watched the President and Mrs. Kennedy go by as the assassination suddenly took place. Some of them are the police officers who were part of the detail that escorted the presidential limo along the streets of Dallas and some were the officers who were in charge of the investigation and questioning of Oswald. These interviews alone are worth the price of the proverbial  admission.

The interviews with those individuals who have been doing their own investigations into the possible conspiracies that took place are also interesting to watch. Many of them give credible presentations of what they feel happened or probably happened. There are a couple though who are interviewed who's theories are shaky at best. For me they didn't make a point for their case at all. Especially the one claiming a blurry photo shows a figure of a man shooting a rifle while another man stands near by. It just looked like a blurry picture to me. Even when they outlines in the photo where the figures of the men were suppose to be it still looked like a blurry picture to me. As for the others however their presentations of their theories are believable enough that it could give the viewer reason to question if there was a cover up in the assassination. It is all up to the viewer to watch and decide for themselves.

Apparently there is some controversy with this DVD set however. As I mentioned in the beginning of this review there are 6 parts to this series. From what I have read in some of the other reviews for this DVD however originally there was 9 parts to the series but numbers 7, 8 and 9 have been left out. And from what I am reading it is not by accident they were left out. These three parts are suppose to present some interesting theories about the assassination including the 9th part that looks at the possibility that Vice President Lyndon Johnson may have approved or took part in some way in the killing of the President. I will say for the record here that I have heard of this theory in the past and I just don't believe Johnson had anything to do with the assassination. However having said that I would have been interested in seeing that particular part of the series and listen to the evidence behind why it is believed Johnson was somehow a part of the assassination. Would it change my opinion of my beliefs Johnson had no part in the assassination? I don't know and wouldn't know until I had a chance to see this particular episode. Fortunately from what I have read in the these other reviews you can see these three missing parts to the series on youtube. So I along with anyone else interested in seeing these missing parts will have to go there to watch these episodes.

All in all though these are interesting discs to watch no matter what your beliefs on what happened in Dallas that day are. The production is good. The editing is good. The over all presentation is good. Watch it and decide for yourself. I would recommend however to shop around for this DVD set and see if you can find a better price for it. $180 is to me a very steep price to pay for a two disc set. The copy I have of ""The Men Who Killed Kennedy"" was purchased in used condition at a Goodwill store for only $5 and plays as good as if it was brand new. $180.00 for a two disc DVD set? Now that's a real conspiracy!",1412726400,2,5323,4.393509127789047

74866,5,0788600931,"This is a very well-done documentary which definitely makes one wonder who is running things in this country.  I have read many, many books about the Kennedy assassination, and very much appreciated the way this documentary tied together so many details in a clear,  coherent way. My opinion is that there was definitely a conspiracy to kill Kennedy, but the plot is like a giant jigsaw puzzle that has many pieces and players.  This makes it very hard to unravel the truth of whole story, and frankly, I wonder if the entire plot will ever be completely unearthed.  This series is done in such an understandable way that it is easy to follow even for high school students or those new to the subject.

From watching the dvd's, one learns how much evidence was either ignored or destroyed when it did not conform to the official ""lone nut assassin"" theory that was immediately embraced by the Warren Commission. Many people raise the objection that if there really was a conspiracy to kill JFK, surely someone would have talked over these many years.  Well. . .many, many people have talked!  They were just ignored by investigators and/or their bosses who cherry-picked evidence in order to have an open & shut case against Oswald.  For example, anyone who heard shots from the Texas School Book Depository was interviewed by the FBI and ultimately, the Warren Commission; those who heard shots from the grassy knoll were not.  Witnesses who said they saw Oswald  shoot Officer Tippit were interviewed; those who saw two shooters, neither of which fit Oswald's description, were completely ignored.  Sadly, many witnesses have died very suspicious deaths--several of them immediately prior to testifying before the House Committee on Assassinations in the 1970's.

This series interviews many eye-witnesses who were there at Dealy Plaza the day of the assassination, along with law enforcement who dealt with Oswald, the FBI, Jack Ruby, etc.  Doctors at Parkland Hospital who worked to save JFK's life, people who were present at Kennedy's autopsy, witnesses to the Tippit murder and other key individuals are interviewed and they all have a very compelling story to tell.  Several veteran JFK researchers such as Jim Garrison are interviewed, as well as Marina Oswald.

Some might wonder why it is still important to know the truth of what happened on Nov. 22, 1963.  After all, so much time has passed; is it still relevant?  Is this just an interesting mystery for history buffs and conspiracy theorists?  I completely agree with one of the investigators interviewed on one of the dvd's that yes, this is still a very relevant issue to the American people.  First of all, truth always matters!  Secondly, if there truly was a conspiracy to kill Kennedy, then that means there are people who got away with murder.  Thirdly, if Oswald was really framed, then an innocent man was declared guilty and ultimately murdered--without ever receiving his constitutional rights such as the right to a lawyer, the presumption of innocence until proven guilty in a court of law, the right to a trial by jury, the right to face his accusers, etc. . .  For his descendants' sake, it is morally imperative to find out the truth and absolve him of guilt if he truly was a ""patsy,"" as he claimed.  Finally, if there were elements within the government who wield such power as to assassinate the elected president, then there is really no limit to what they are capable of. Images of 9-11 come to mind, along with other shady operations which have been sold to the American people as being perpetrated by ""lone nuts,""  ""terrorists,"" or ""extremists.""

I would definitely recommend getting the additional dvd's that were cut from this series.  (Available on E-Bay the last time I checked.)  They plunge further into the plot and reveal explosive information and name the names of those who were probably calling the shots.  Yes, most likely the Mafia, CIA, and anti-Castro Cubans were involved and provided the shooters and the leg work to carry out the actual assassination.  But the ultimate responsibility had to come from the highest levels of government  in order for the post-assassination cover up to be successful.

74870,5,0788600931,"The Truth that the CIA AND U.S. Forensic teams used as evidence to build as a cover up; to place Oswald as a patsy around the murdering plot that was cooked up by the CIA (Including former Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and George Bush Sr.), and the leaders of the Mafia (including Santo Trafficanti of Memphis, Tenn.); backed by the AFLCIO Teamsters Union funding.

74871,4,0788600931,"Obviously the last three chapters of the original complete series cut too close to the bone for some no doubt close to the cover up.

I got the whole nine chapter version on eBay and after watching it saw no legitimate reason why a ban should have been placed on the full nine chapters being available for public comsumption.

In this land of free speech supposedly proud of democracy once again it appears certain powers with a vested interest to maintain the official lie are able to censor what they don't want you to know.

The full documentary is consistent through all nine chapters in not manipulating visual and verbal witness accounts and we see in the last three Johnson's mistress and lawyer speaking freely about Johnson's involvement or complicity in Kennedy's assassination.

This is where a film documentary has advantage over a book.

Others throughout this whole documentary including an Oswald girlfriend aren't being quoted and it's their words we hear. So hearing these accounts along with other information we are basically able to draw our own conclusions just as law enforcement might.

As for the assassin or more likely assassins I was most intrigued by the location of the storm drain that offered a concealed position, access for escape and the trajectory for the fatal head shot.

As this review is for a shortened version the star rating I give it is less than it would be otherwise. Still in my opinion it is the best reference of all regarding the Kennedy assassination.",1390262400,,1501,4.862745098039215

His political decisions were bungled and made me wonder who in fact were the participants-- in and out of the White House, with secrets now being revealed.  The biggest tragedy of JFK's death as I learned here, was he ordered to stop the Viet Nam war right before his death but a few days after the national mourning, a new order was initiated to ramp it up.

The doctors from Parkland hospital and the Dallas coroner's office and Bethesda naval (official gov) autopsy testify that the official autopsy report circulated by the Warren commission is a fraud. Some of the theories are just that, theoretical speculation (badge man)but much of this is fact. The one thing the liars can never explain is; if the kill shot was from behind (6th floor Book depository)then why did the head go back? No matter how many smoke screens, 3 card Monty and shell games they play, even the most masterful illusionists can't eliminate this evidence that ruins the Warren report and renders it fictional.
The kill shot seen in the Zapruder film had to come from the front-side. One question; Allen Dulles was the original head of the CIA, Kennedy wanted to disband the CIA and in 1962 or 3 JFK had Dulles removed as head of the CIA.

74886,5,0788600931,"Has a lot of interesting things put in. BUT, since we are still owned by the rich and powerful, they STILL, don't want you to find out the truth.
Here is what I have learned....

The rich and powerful still own each and every one of us. Look at what happened to the only President to stand up to them.
They blew his head apart, while emory roberts (head of our president's secret service detail for that day) set him up and sat back and watched it happen. I wonder how much it costs to buy an agent. roberts even called back a agent that was going to help, after our president was hit, by the 2nd bullet. The first one missed.
johnson knew too, look at the smile on his face, in the motorcade. He knew exactly what was going to happen. He and his oil buddies in Texas got together, (The BU#@ Family) to figure it out.
THEY WANTED THEIR WAR IN FING VIETNAM. Johnsons carreer was over, and he wanted to be President, (No matter the cost)That's why Johnson was covered and pushed down by Rufus Youngblood, (a honest agent) after he ""saw some commotion in the President's car"". He leaped out of the front seat, and covered johnson. After he had johnson covered and safe, he heard the final two shots. It's all in his report. How did he leap over the back, of johnsons car while the other agent's behind, and in Kennedy's car did nothing.
Then about the agents in the front seat of the presidential car, The president, said quite clearly ""My God, I'm hit"" before he passed out. Then the driver practically stops, and looks back, like he is waiting......... ""Oh there it is, the kill shot. Punch it."" Almost like he was expecting it. They LET our President get assassinated! Then emory roberts radios back to johnsons car ""They got him. They got him."" (interesting choice of words).Watch this and learn a little, about how we lost our country.
John Kennedy was an incredibly brave soul, so was Bobby.
More than one of us knows what is really going on with our country, and how we lost it, so many years ago. Study and decided for yourself. Everything is out there.
But stand up and tell the American people the truth, and they (the ones really in charge) will KILL you. (Make it look like anything. Heart attack, car accident, lone gunman) WE better wake up.
They want a bunch of uniformed, obedient workers, that believe all the crap they tell you.

When the History Channel aired the first 6 parts of this series it helped to pique the curiosity of people like me who felt a deep sense of personal and national loss by this crime.  The Warren Commission only served to deepen this sense of loss and added betrayal and cover-up due to its superficial quality.  Over the decades some of its members have been well rewarded for their complicity.  See Gerald Ford for a case in point. These 6 parts cover the most superficial elements of the killing.  in the end they are little more than an ABC program about this event, that is, they offer only the safest information and background without drawing any conclusions that would annoy or offend their sponsors.
Several years ago, the History Channel broadcast 3 extra programs on the assassination that broke ground that few had been brave enough to discuss.  The programs included interviews with some of the most inside people left alive by those involved in the original conspiracy.  Unfortunately, the History Channel was unable to afford the legal threats leveled at them by members of the Johnson family among others and they published a retraction.
If you want a white washed discussion of the JFK assassination, they this series will due very nicely.

74895,4,0788600931,"Thanks to the Reviewer who pointed of what's missing from this DVD package? (Re. Chapters). That's a central theme to this astonishing production - what's missing from the places where the hardest evidence should be housed?

Absolutely over-running with hitherto unknown, lesser-discussed facts and intelligent speculation, all discs cry out for revisitation, slo-mo'ing, freeze-framing, all the way through.

Characters like Joseph Milteer are given due coverage, unlike Gerald Posner's book where this extemist was reduced to a tiny footnote. This DVD does not carve in concrete tha the Secret service in Dallas was not alerted to a very plot against JFK in Miami, though the implication is that the FBI and the Secret Service had (an intentional) ""failure to communicate"".

At times, we must consider this DVD-set with ""1988"" in mind. There's very little about General walker, Jack Ruby, David Ferrie, and others, which really tighten up the argument or belief that there was more than one shootist in Texas, on 11-22-63.

There's a mind-boggling segment features ablow-up of the Mary Moorman photo which reveals cloudy figures of three individuals, one a Military man with a home movie camera (he's given alot of footage here!) and two men standing either behind a white wall or picket fence. At first, even the most anti-Warren Commisssion viewer might say, yeah, color it in...big deal. But it is revealed that two researchers spent years on theblow-up. And one man in an apparent hardhat has been photgraphed from other angles (seen in another DVD) to show that perhaps this was not a case of an ink-blot gone astray.

Vey powerful is the part suggesting that (1) autopsy photos were modified and (2) JFK's brain was mostly removed between Dallas and Washington, D.C.

Still, we do not have 100% ""evidence"" of the *fatal* blow coming from Kennedy's ""right front"". Spaeking with a Doctor Of Physics, personally, I got a very learned but ""typical"" answer that ""if a person's brain explodes"", then his body flails about and initial impact physics is not relevant. Again, we are dealing with ""1988"", so new ballistics details have come out on the subject; very convincing evidence that most likely LHO did not fire a *rifle* on that day.

The ""Three assassins"" from France idea was new to me at the time and is very hard to follow on this documentary. I've had to replay that part (on my VHS tape of yore) about 45 times. One thing is strongly asserted though: a guy from France, identified as a very businesslike killer for profit, stood atop the Grassy Knoll.

If you just want one source for 11-22-63, this is probably the best, though the viewer must constantly look for supporting ideas/facts from newer sources.

The copy/narrative is excellent - I first watched this as a TV Special, with an American narrator. Here we have the presumptive original (English) voice.

74897,5,0788600931,"I first saw the multi-episode documentary The Men Who Killed Kennedy in November 2003 on the History Channel.  I have ALL the  episodes, including ones that aren't included in this set I'm reviewing.  This is a riveting, interesting documentary.  Whether you're a conspiracy believer or subscribe to the idea that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, I think you'll find this documentary very interesting to watch.

Here are the episodes:

1. The Coup d'Etat
2. The Forces Of Darkness
3. The Cover-Up
4. The Patsy
5. The Witnesses
6. The Truth Shall Make You Free
7. The Smoking Guns (not included in this set)
8. The Love Affair (not included in this set)
9. The Guilty Men (not included in this set)

The original series was broadcast in the UK in 1988, which was 25 years after the assassination.  In the 22 years since it was broadcast, a lot of other fascinating programs have aired on various TV channels.  Knowledge about the assassination has grown exponentially since 1988, as have advances in forensic science and ways of understanding what happened.  Just like everyone else, I have my own opinions about what happened in Dallas on November 22, 1963.  I've watched this documentary and countless others on The History Channel, The Discovery Channel, CNN, FOX News, and other networks.  I've also done my own research.

Some of the programs I have seen and taped over the years include:

JFK: Beyond The Magic Bullet
JFK: Beyond Conspiracy
JFK: 3 Shots That Changed America
JFK: Case Not Closed
JFK: Inside The Target Car
JFK: Altered Statesman
Who Murdered JFK?
24 Hours After The Kennedy Assassination
JFK: The Day That Changed America
Image Of An Assassination
Death In Dealey Plaza

Not all of these programs deal with the controversy about the assassination, but most of them do.

Not everything in this documentary is necessarily true, you can go to the bank on that.  The History Channel acknowledges this, as they did their own research into some of the material that was presented in the series, but it's still a fascinating program to watch.  What this documentary basically is designed to do is open up peoples' minds and get them thinking.  The title is ""The Men Who Killed Kennedy"", which obviously means it's geared toward conspiracy theorists and rejects the idea of a lone gunman.

Without going into a lot of specifics, I'll just sum up this documentary this way:  It's controversial, interesting, fascinating, thought-provoking, historic, nostalgic, and will really make you question a lot of things about the assassination and the time period in which it happened and what has gone on in this country in the decades since, especially if you're a conspiracy theorist.

If you can get your hands on the episodes from 2003 (The Smoking Guns, The Love Affair, and The Guilty Men), it will REALLY open your mind.

My favorite episodes in the whole series are The Cover-Up, The Witnesses, The Patsy, The Coup d'Etat, The Smoking Guns, and The Guilty Men.

If you're a JFK assassination buff, then this documentary will provide your fix for the day.  I highly recommend it.",1282608000,4,3089,4.882917466410748

74899,5,0788600931,"This episode of The Men Who Killed Kennedy is worth its weight in gold for a couple of reasons. First, it is no longer available due to political suppression by Johnson cronies and the History Channel has suppressed it and will not show it on TV anymore. What is so explosive in this video by Nigel Turner? Barr McClellan is interviewed (LBJ's attorney)and states with conviction that he is certain LBJ was involved in having JFK assassinated so as to become president, as well as to escape being removed from the 1964 ticket, and from being convicted for crimes associated with Bobby Baker and Billy Sol Estes. In addition, it is revealed that J.Edgar Hoover, LBJ, John J. McCloy (future Warren Commissioner), Richard Nixon,H.L.Hunt, and Clint Murchison met the night before the assassination at Murchison's estate. A maid verifies that and also adds that the week after the assassination, they dined on caviar and champaigne every day! Penn Jones Jr. originally revealed this big conference at Murchison's estate in Forgive My Grief, Vol 3. Barr McClellan's book Blood, Money & Power details much of this story and as in MWKK, ""The Guilty Men"", he notes a psychiatrist was muzzled to keep him silent about LBJ's depression and guilt, in the years before his death in 1973. A new book by Douglas Horne, Inside the Assassinations Records Review Board also discusses this episode and is a fine selection to the real forces that killed JFK. In conclusion,McClellan claims LBJ had others killed and his thug Mac Wallace is shown to have left the unidentified print on a box on the 6th floor of the Depository building from which the shots allegedly came. The suppression of this video is a crime against the truth and it should be released again so the American people can know the truth.",1272412800,26,1785,4.836601307189542

The History Channel presentation was originally sold in 2 parts (4 dvds). The first double dvd set contained: Volume 1 - The Coup d'Etat, The Forces of Darkness, The Cover-Up; and Volume 2 - The Patsy, The Witnesses, and The Truth Shal Set You Free. The second dvd set contained: Volume 1 - The Smoking Guns, and The Love Affair; and Volume 2 - The Guilty Men.

The cover shown on this advert is for the 1st of the double dvd sets. The 2nd cover has a more plain vanilla History channel logo. If there are other production sets, please post.

The 2nd set is perhaps the most controversial. The Love Affair describes a romantic affair between Judith Baker and Lee Osward. She was a cancer researcher gone astray and involved in a scheme to inject Fidel Castro with a virulent cancer which in its preliminary stages was tested on an unwitting subject in a US mental hospital. If you can find it anywhere, it is worth viewing. I have read that it has never again been aired on TV.
Volume 2 of the 2nd set - The Guilty Men - incriminates LBJ and other prominent Texans and Hoover in the cover-up if not the planning of the assassination. This last segment is now officially suppressed. You cannot find it anywhere unless in used copy. This episode is viewable in YouTube but in fair quality and in 5 segments.

Who did the shooting? When this documentary was aired, Mr Turner put together the best known evidence. Since no prosecutor has dared touch the issue since Jim Garrison, we are left with uncertain theorizing about Italian shooters (some claim one of the segments is now discreted because two of the possible Italian assassins claim an alibi). Recenly attention has focused on a James Files (a Google search will lead to an alleged confession - extraordinarily believeable but questions remain). Does 1 group of shooters rule out another? No.

Is absolutely everything alleged in the documentary true? No doubt there are weaknesses. Yet no one has proven anything to be absolutely incorrect. Is it possible the Italian Mafia was not involved? Yes. Is it possible that James Files was 1 of the shooters (Google search). You be the judge, because someday you might have to be one of the jurors.

Nigel Turner put together the best evidence at the time, bar none.",1264204800,3,2643,5.0228310502283104

Even if you exclude all of the witnesses in the DVD, many of whom are intelligent professionals, think on your own regardless of what the corporate owned mainstream media (ie.-Peter Jennings & his JFK program on ABC) or the Warren Commission have said. For instance.
A) Actual footage of witnesses by the dozens running towards the grassy knoll because that IS where they heard one of the shots come from.
B) The Secret Service getting called off from riding on JFK's limo & many other operational irregularities.
B)The photos of JFK's altered head wound & the way his body was rushed off by Secret Service and the many many other discrepancies in the investigation. So much evidence to prove a ""cover up"" existed that I can't list them here.

74909,2,0788600931,"This DVD is well presented, and is filled with some wonderful historic footage.
Unfortunately, its worth ends there.

The conspiracy theories in this documentary are just plain false.
After many years of research into this case, I have come to the rather disappointing and prosaic conclusion that Lee Harvey Oswald was indeed the murderer of JFK. He acted alone, there was no conspiracy.

So why do I say disappointing? For years I believed that Kennedy's assassination was, and HAD to be a very carefully planned conspiracy. Many things added fuel to my belief; the political climate of the time, Jack Ruby popping up out of nowhere and shooting Oswald before any trial inquest could be done, the ""grassy knoll"", the ""magic bullet"", the apparent conflicting eye (ear) witness testimony, etc., etc. I simply could not accept the notion of some looser nutcase killing the President of the United States. It just did not balance in my mind. The answer could not be that simple, I thought. I realized that I (like Agent Mulder) WANTED TO BELIEVE. The Warren Commission Report, and the House Select Committee on Assassinations report, just added to the mystery. No one believed the Warren Report, it was full of mistakes. Even LBJ (though not publicly) was convinced that Castro was somehow behind the assassination. Then there was E. Howard Hunts ""confession"" when he thought he was dying.

I have always given equal time to both schools of thought; the ""conspiracy"" theory, and the ""lone gunman"" theory. I have spent a small fortune on books, videos, and trips to the National Archives. At some point in my research, I came to realize that even the best conspiracy theories lacked any good evidence. In fact, I was able to debunk every single one.

The KEY to understanding this case is the one thing that is sadly overlooked or ignored by conspiracy buffs. The key is Lee Harvey Oswald HIMSELF.

When you understand this man's life, the people close to him, and his history, the pieces of the puzzle fit together at last.

I would urge anyone who is truly interested, and who TRULY wants to know the truth, to study the best books on both sides of the debate. Do a thorough study. Cross reference points of interest, and take no one's word as Gospel.

Sometimes, we don't want to know the truth. Everyone loves a mystery, and ""conspiracies"" are very alluring. They are also very big business. The truth in this case is only as complex as the troubled mind of one man; Lee Harvey Oswald.

""The Men Who Killed Kennedy"" is a very interesting introduction into some of the common conspiracy theories. View it critically. I also strongly recommend the following:

""Image of an Assassination"" - A new look at the Zapruder film. On DVD

74911,4,0788600931,"Those of us who are interested in history often come across situations where we have to defend the notion that there are conspiracies in history but not all history is a conspiracy. In modern times, with the possible future exception of 9/11, the `mystery' of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in November 1963 has played into the hands of those who see history merely as a conspiracy. I have read more than my fair share of books on the subject, most recently the late Norman Mailer's book on Oswald, and here I review a documentary from 1988 that, in essence, merely adds fuel to the fire of that controversy. At this remove however, in 2008, I think it is clear that the conspiracy mongers have had their day on the subject and have come up short. Not through lack of trying, though.

Given my leftward political trajectory since the time of the assassination one would think that I would be amenable to some theory of high-level governmental, corporate or criminal conspiracy. As a teenager I campaigned for Kennedy in 1960. I was shocked and dismayed by his murder, throwing away a political notebook that I kept and swearing off politics forever. That resolve obviously did not last long. I am, moreover, more than willing to believe that governmental officials, corporate officers and criminal masterminds are willing to anything to keep their positions of power. However, it just does not wash here. Part of the problem is there are just too many theories to fit the facts.

The real problem with the various conspiracy theories is that they ask us to suspend disbelieve for their theories even greater than the botched up job that the Warren Commission provided. These theories inevitably work between the lines of that report. I think the classic example in this documentary, that can stand for my opinion in general, is when one of the conspiracy theorists very calmly states his propositions about how the Warren Report botched things and then, as calmly cites four possible groups of conspirators who could have done the deed, anti-Castro Cubans, disgruntled CIA rogue elements, disgruntled militarists and Mafia-types. Well that narrows the field considerably, doesn't it?

 But here is the kicker- I am convinced that Lee Harvey Oswald was capable of doing the murder by himself, that he did it and that he stands before history as having done it. Grand conspiracy theories that deny the role of the individual in history do so in this case for no apparent reason. That `theory' may not be sexy enough for some but Oswald should have his fifteen minutes of fame. Unless someone produces the `smoking gun' missing in all other theories-in short, a real named person (or persons) who did the deed let us leave it at that.",1208304000,,2747,4.850746268656716

74913,2,0788600931,"This is fun to watch but it should not be taken as literal truth. Two of the men that were implicated as the trigger men in this video were shown to be at France in prison during the time of the assasination. I actually think this should NOT ever be shown on the History channel since so much of this video has shown to be completely wrong.
Still it is fun to watch, for the real story read ""Reclaiming History"" which makes a lot more sense overall, though it is a long read. The book is really strong on Oswald's background. I learned a lot that I did not know though I have been reading about the JFK assasination for years on end.
It is really hard to prove a conspiracy DIDN'T happen. If you just stick to the actual evidence, it points to Oswald acted alone (and if you read his background it is not all that surprising).
The evidence on Oswald is overwhelming.  Reminds me of evolution, evidence on evolution is overwhelming as well, and people just ignore it, like it isn't there.",1202342400,3,987,4.335135135135135

It is hard to believe that after 45 years of intensive research, thousands of books and endless debate, we are still left as confused as ever! For those who know their JFK facts ""The Men Who Killed Kennedy provides plenty of spectulative assumptions and tremendous leaps of faith as to how truthful most of the information presented is. However it is very entertaining and thought provoking. For those who have read Prosser's ""Case Closed"" and believe his conclusions, then the the Men Who Killed Kennedy will probably rile you. In spite of some sketchy evidence and questionable assumptions, I really enjoyed the series. My only regret is that Oliver Stone didn't base his movie around  one of the scenerials in The Men Who Killed Kennedy. I think the end result would have been more believable than the Clay Shaw and David Ferrie connection. All said and done I think it is a safe bet that Oswald was the shooter, but was he part of a conspiracy? I think the answer to that question is buried in the time he was in New Orleans before the Assassination and his connections with the Cubian groups and if the CIA had involvement with him. If we knew the truth and answers raised by his time in New Orlean's perhaps the JFK Assassination case could be closed.",1198713600,2,1393,4.6396761133603235

74919,4,0788600931,"Where were you when JFK was shot?  This is a question often asked among those who lived through this time in history.  The producers of this 2-disc DVD set asked this question to many of those who were actually in Dallas that fateful day in 1963.  And they also ask what they say and what they heard.  The responses shown here generally reflect a view that JFK was hit in the head by a bullet from the front shot at approximately ground level, which directly contradicts the Warren Commission report.  The movie also interviews dozens of individuals who were involved in the aftermath; including doctors present at the autopsy, police officers who dealt with either Oswald or Jack Ruby, and journalists who covered the case first hand.

The movie is taken from a History Channel serial and comes in the format of six episodes.  Each of the episodes deals with a different aspect of the assasination.  One episode focuses on Lee Harvey Oswald, another focuses on physical evidence such as acoustics and ballistics, another episode recreates events the day of the shooting, etc, etc...  Probably the most intriguing episode is the first two which produce evidence hinting that French assassins hired by the US mob shot Kennedy.

Overall, this series presents a lot of primary evidence that contradict the findings of the Warren commission, and even challenge the possibility that Lee Harvey Oswald participated in the killing.  The pace of the show is great, slow enough for everyone to get their words in.  What was really nice were the interviews; each interviewee got time to provide lengthy and detailed answers.

There are several things that could have been improved to make this good series great.  First, at the beginning of each and every interview, subtitles should be provided that give the name and title (doctor, police officer, witness, etc...) of each person.  This is especially important given the large number of individuals interviewed.  Second, there should have been one additional episode that went through the findings of the Warren Commission.  The Warren Commission report is thousands of pages long, and all but the most avid history buffs have never read a page of it.  As such, the entire series should have included one episode that comprehensively went over the history and findings of the Warren Commission.  Third, for a family that lost two of its sons, this show makes no mention of what other Kennedy family members have said about the assasinations.  This would have made a nice conclusion to the entire series.  Fourth, the organization of the entire serial could have been vastly improved.  The first episode should have went over the events as happened that all agree upon; from JFK's flight into Dallas to the conclusion of the Warren Commission.  The second episode should have explored in detail the Warren Commission report.  The third episode should have presented evidence not included in the Warren report.  The remainder of the episodes should then focus on contradictions between the Warren report and other evidence.  But all in all, still a great show.",1182816000,5,3100,5.005859375

The plot to kill Castro was turned on the president of the United States and his brother knew right away what had happened. More than 40 knowledgeable witnesses died sudden deaths within months, from Jack Ruby to RFK, in an attempt to hide the truth. The Warren Commission had all the facts they chose to keep to get their ""story"" recorded into the history books. If you think OJ was innocent, don't bother to look at this collection of facts.

74923,5,0788600931,"When it comes to the JFK assasination??? Well lets just say as numerous polls indicate, most people don't believe what was put out by the Warren Commission. The British documentary series ""The Men Who Killed Kennedy"", was the only televised challenge that had the guts to speak it's mind, namely through producer Nigel Turner. First presented in 1988, Turner and his team assembled a great deal of testimony and research to dispute the ""all so convenient and miraculous"" facts that were offered up as gospel. ""The Single Bullet Theory"" being the weapon to blow away all those that dare doubt their government. But then being British myself and realising like many others what the killing of JFK has had on not just US but World history. I made sure that I watched this series when it had first aired on A&E. And what a revelation! Now I had already had my eyes opened, when the 1973 Burt Lancaster film ""Executive Action"", laid out many of the same findings, only hidden within the semi-fictional framework of not naming anyone. But this series started to fill in the gaps and start naming the cast of characters. Now this subject is certainly something that you can literally write volumes on, but to my simple way of thinking, you either blindly believe that one single person could kill JFK -with the worst possible choice of rifle; getting himself photographed with said rifle beforehand; being lucky enough to have Kennedy totally exposed in the limo -a virtual sitting duck; having in the first place, the luck and money to get discharged from the Marine Corp and being granted without any troble at all,a visa to Russia -and so on and so on, not to mention all those convenient deaths, accidents and suicides for years to come. Well to my mind at least -theres room for doubt!

It's the absolute body of doubt that makes the case for the series. Although serious damage was done to it's credibility when the so called ""Marseille-drug hitmen connection"" was prooved false. But that does not or should not alter all the evidence it has prooved. Which brings us to the final three installments of this nine part expose. Certainly the most controversial and indicting of all -part 7. ""The Smoking Guns"", part 8. ""The Love Affair"" and finally the bombshell part 9. ""The Guilty Men"". These three parts were aired on the History Channel on the 40th anniversary of the assasination. The first night the channel aired all three, I missed it. But the second night when they were repeated, a station disclaimer was added before each commercial break and the show aired without any cuts. Still, anger had been raised but the parent company Disney, held firm. They were released on dvd together with the rest of the series and then -they were suddenly no more. Totally pulled from release with the company deeply apologizing for having aired the series in the first place. Evenso, I managed to tape them from that second night anyway and I'm glad I did. Talk about in demand! That final part 9. ""The Guilty Men"" produced in 2003, the part that implicates Lyndon Baines Johnson himself, through none other than one of his attorneys Barr McClellan. Incidently at the time of all this, his son Scott just happened to be George W. Bush's press secretary. Now you don't have to panic if you missed the airing or couldn't get your hands on a copy of the tape or dvd, because Barr McClellan put it all down in his book ""Blood, Money & Power"" which is still available on Amazon. I guess LBJ's dedicated and ageing supporters, felt safe in the fact that the public don't read much anymore.

In conclusion though, this is a series worthy of debate. Personally I believe there was a conspiracy and a big one! Oswald was the ultimate fall guy and it wasn't just the presidential limo that took a big RIGHT turn into Deeley Plaza that November day. As for papers being released in the future, well you got to believe if anything was written down it's long gone now, along with anyone who even slightly witnessed anything. Such is the way with history and the struggle for power and wealth.

74927,5,0788600931,"I think it was Vince Palamara who said this is the definitive investigation into the assassination.  That is correct.  Five stars isn't enough.

I could say more about what these dvds reveal but that would be ruining it for the viewer.  Just check it out.  You won't be disappointed unless you're a die hard believer in Oswald's guilt and the other garbage the government has been feeding us about this for the last 40 years.

To me anyone who watches this dvd series and still believes the government's story is a fool.

The most frightening aspect of this story for me is the killing of civilian witnesses.  Really the main purpose of the Warren Commission investigation was to identify all of the important witnesses so they could be killed.

But this shouldn't be surprising.  These are people who started an entire war.  Human life meant nothing to them.

We can see the hand of fate in this assassination and the events that surrounded it.  So many things could have happened differently.

If only:

1) people acted on Ruby's anonymous phone call and did not bring Oswald through the basement of the police station.  the original plan was probably to have Oswald killed by the police when he was arrested.

2) the FBI didn't confiscate the babushka lady's photo which probably clearly captured badge man firing

3) someone would have seen any of the shooters, grabbed them, and had them arrested

4) Kennedy wasn't killed but perhaps only injured or not hit at all

But none of these things happened.  For this we must give credit where credit is due to the FBI, the CIA, the snipers provided by the mafia, and good old 'Lyin Lyndon'. The people who did this weren't stupid.

If any of these things did happen they would have had contigency plans anyway.  But it would have been harder to continue the lie for all of this time.

We also see how individuals that became involved with those dark forces perhaps began to have second thoughts.

Ruby trying to warn them to change the plans about moving Oswald.

Badge man 'shaking and crying' immediately after shooting Kennedy.  Who knows why he was so upset.  Obviously this was a high pressure situation and every second mattered at that particular time.

Lyin Lyndon eventually had a nervous breakdown.  Did he perhaps have regrets about what happened and after observing what went on in Viet Nam ?  Who will ever know ?

These are people who sold their souls but maybe were having second thoughts.

Fate had determined that those who carried out this plot were not going to pay for their crimes in this world (at least not at that time).

Fate had determined that over time people would eventually unravel this mystery.  Miraculously enough evidence survived including important video and photographs to allow the courageous investigators to eventually figure out what happened.

President Kennedy's wife was fortunate she wasn't killed also.

I don't think it would be that easy or even possible to do something like this today.  That was a different time.

There's two additional episodes of this epoch dvd series which names names about who the conspirators were.  However the hypocrites have taken legal action to prevent these dvds from ever being shown on tv or sold again.

I have them though since I copied them from my vhs tape to dvd.  I give them away to people.

74929,5,0788600931,THE CIA AGENCY ASSASSINATED JFK AND CIA AND BLACK OPS AS BEING INVOLVED IN JFK SHOOTING,1142121600,11,87,4.5
74930,1,0788600931,"The multi-part A&E documentary series, ""The Men Who Killed Kennedy"" (1988/1995/2003), is more of the same unsupportable pro-conspiracy tripe that has circulated for decades with regard to President John F. Kennedy's 1963 assassination. It's kind of hard for me to believe that the otherwise-first-class TV organizations of ""A&E"" and ""The History Channel"" could even lend their good names to this type of purely-conjecture-based nonsense.

And one of the three 2003 ""add-on"" segments of ""TMWKK"", the part subtitled ""The Love Affair"" (which is not available on VHS or DVD), is positively one of the worst hunks of made-up dreck I can possibly imagine. That part of the documentary purports that Judyth Vary-Baker was having a love affair with JFK's killer, Lee Harvey Oswald, around the time of President Kennedy's death in late 1963.

That ridiculous ""TMWKK"" chapter also wants the gullible public to swallow the far-fetched notion that Oswald not only didn't have anything to do with JFK's murder, but that Oswald himself was trying to SAVE the President from being killed in the hours leading up to 12:30 PM on 11-22-63! Mr. Oswald was quite the humanitarian it would seem. He evidently didn't want to harm President Kennedy at all -- he, to the contrary, wanted to RESCUE him from an assassin's bullet. What a great guy! (Somebody please lead me to the puke bucket....because I think I'm going to hurl after having alluded to such sickening CT-created hogwash pertaining to ""Saint Oswald""!)

Footnote To The ""Love Affair"" Chapter -- Even if Judyth DID know Lee Oswald in some fashion, circa 1963, that by no means all of a sudden makes Oswald blameless in the JFK and J.D. Tippit murders. And why anyone with a speck of common sense would think that Judyth's sappy, sentimental attachment to Mr. Oswald would magically wipe out the Mount Everest of physical and circumstantial evidence that reveals Oswald to be a double-killer is the type of strange thinking that perhaps only a trained psychiatrist would have an explanation for.

The other two add-on parts to this A&E series, aired in 2003 -- ""The Smoking Guns"" and ""The Guilty Men"" -- are certainly no more credible than the baloney-filled and laughably-absurd ""Love Affair"" chapter, either.

""The Guilty Men"" segment deserves nothing but rancor as well, for its wholly-specious theory which suggests that JFK's Vice-President, Lyndon B. Johnson, was somehow pulling the assassins' strings and had ordered the ""hit"" on JFK in '63. There's not a grain of evidence to back up such vile claims, of course. And ""The History Channel"" itself was even pressured to issue an apology for the content of that particular program a short time after it initially aired in November 2003.

And in April of 2004, ""THC"" broadcast a special program for the purpose of refuting the ""Guilty Men"" episode. The cable network also said that that Johnson-bashing program would never be aired again, nor would it ever be released on a home-video format. (So much for the 'accuracy' of ""The Guilty Men"".)

But, no matter how many new installments of ""TMWKK"" series of programs that are produced, it won't turn Lee Harvey Oswald into an innocent ""Patsy"". Not even close.

Because......

The physical evidence does not now, nor has it ever, supported ""conspiracy"" in the murder of John F. Kennedy. Simple as that. The multitude of ""Conspiracy Theorists"" have PUT the ""Conspiracy"" in this case. Simple as that, too.

Can any CTer provide ONE single solid hunk of physical evidence to support the notion that President Kennedy was murdered as the result of a conspiracy? Or even a good piece of circumstantial evidence for that matter -- apart from shadows in grainy photographs, or unproven allegations of evidence-planting and photo-fakery, manipulation of records, witness coercion, and unsupported rumors of vast numbers of witnesses (including ALL THREE primary autopsy doctors -- Humes, Finck, and Boswell) who all supposedly just flat-out lied to the various post-assassination Government panels?

How about just one bullet fragment in the record somewhere that doesn't lead straight back to Oswald's Mannlicher-Carcano rifle?

How about....anything....that can bolster the current non-existent PHYSICAL EVIDENCE status of the ""Conspiracy-Theory Case"" in either the JFK murder or the J.D. Tippit slaying?

Anything?

Didn't think so. Because nothing's there.

Simple as that (too).

-------------

Another valid inquiry which has no believable or credible answer from a ""CT"" point-of-view is this:

How could these assassination plotters be so fantastically clever one minute, and so utterly stupid, bumbling, and reckless the next?

The best answer to that, of course, is the simplest one --- It's because they (the ""plotters"") weren't there in the first place -- and what SEEMS like cunning cleverness and great ""plotting"" one minute (e.g., the planting of literally ALL of the ""Oswald Did It Alone"" evidence) .... and recklessless beyond belief the next minute (e.g., the gunning down of Oswald on Live TV in a crowded police basement) .... is really just exactly what the evidence says it is ----

Two acts of total randomness, born out of pure happenstance, circumstance, and perfect opportunity to act upon these impulses (both on Oswald's part re. JFK and Tippit, and on Ruby's part re. Oswald's death).

Yet again -- Simple as that.

-------------

Slick-talking ""pro-conspiracy"" people (claiming to know things the Lone-Nut dumbbells on the other side of the aisle don't know, or just simply can't bring themselves to ""see"") have drilled stuff into the heads of weak-minded people who MAKE A CHOICE to believe the wilder ""conspiracy"" side of things (like the ""Badge Man"" hooey that makes up a portion of TMWKK), rather than to TRUST THE EVIDENCE ON THE TABLE.*

* = Another good (non-JFK) example of this being the O.J. Simpson murder trial. In the O.J. instance, ALL of the blood evidence was miraculously ""tainted"" and deemed utterly worthless by the defense (and the idiotic jury of 12 bought this foolhardy premise -- hook, line, and ""planted glove""), even though we KNOW the defense was full of stinky crap (and Vincent Bugliosi explains why in incredible detail during the 6-Tape O.J. Trial video series he made in 1999, which comes highly recommended by this writer). Vincent's O.J. video program is worthy even for JFK buffs, because many of the ridiculous claims of ""conspiracy"" and ""evidence tampering"" and ""planting of evidence"" can apply directly to the JFK case as well.

A smooth-talking lawyer, in many people's minds, is hard to fight and hard to disagree with (when their arguments SEEM to be valid and authentic). But NOTHING will suddenly change someone else's blood into O.J. Simpson's plasma (which is the tall tale that the defense was feeding the jury during the Simpson trial). And it was blood that was found AT THE MURDER SCENE no less!

Likewise, there's just too much evidence telling us Oswald pulled the trigger on JFK and J.D. Tippit to believe anything else (especially Tippit, of course; that's one murder case that's as water-tight as can be, no matter what some silly CTer wants to spoon-feed the masses to try and convince them otherwise).

-------------

Re. the ""1-Man Plot"" involving nobody but Lee Harvey Oswald........

I, myself, am of the opinion (given what Oswald could have known with 100% certainty re. JFK's motorcade route in the days/weeks leading up to 11-22-63) that Lee Oswald did not plan the assassination more than a few days in advance (6 days tops, given the newspaper reports about the motorcade).

This lack of preparation shows up in many post-assassination ways re. Oswald -- e.g.: his lousy escape ""plan"" (if he even had one in advance). He had no car; he couldn't drive (very well); and he obviously wasn't bound to ask co-worker Wes Frazier, or anyone, for a ride away from the murder scene within minutes of the shooting. This left him with the only viable means of locomotion for getting the heck out of Dodge/(Dealey Plaza) -- i.e., public transportation and just hoofing it all over the place (both of which he engaged in on November 22).

I'm also of the opinion (given the evidence) that Oswald almost certainly HAD to be of the following pre-November 22 mindset -- ""If I get a chance to kill JFK...OK; if not...so be it"".

HOW could he possibly have been of any other mindset/frame-of-mind in the hours/minutes leading up to 12:30 PM on 11-22-63? I say he couldn't have been of a ""I must kill him today no matter what!"" frame-of-mind.

Why? -- Because it's obvious that Lee Harvey Oswald was NOT suicidal. He proved that multiple times following the shooting. He fought for his life, and freedom. He fought for it by going to get his handgun at 1:00, and fought for it by killing J.D. Tippit (in a ""kill or be caught"" mindset, IMO). And he certainly fought for his life in the Texas Theater, where he hit a policeman in the face and attempted to shoot the officer.

Oswald wasn't a total dunce. He was smart enough to conceal that rifle in a makeshift bag for several hours inside the Depository without a single person seeing him with it. He was smart enough to NOT be seen by Bonnie Ray Williams while (more-than-likely) hiding inside his ""Sniper's Nest"" just before 12:30. And he was smart enough to ditch the rifle well enough so it wouldn't be found for 52 minutes after the shooting. Plus, he was smart enough to not ""tip his hand"" as he confronted his boss and a Dallas cop just two minutes after the shooting occurred (enabling Oswald to ""free"" himself for the moment and get out of the building).

Which means that he was also smart enough to HAVE to realize that his last-minute plan to kill the President all by himself (in total secrecy) probably would not be an easy task -- nor did he even think, IMO, that he would have any such golden, unimpeded opportunity to get the job done from the Depository's 6th Floor that day.

This explains to my satisfaction the rather slipshod, jerry-rigged activity Oswald engaged in during the minutes following his cowardly act of shooting the President of the United States in the back (and in the back of the head).**

** = Although, in Oswald's murderous mind, the decision to wait until JFK's car had turned the corner of Houston and Elm was actually a very smart move by LHO. Because it almost totally eliminated the risk of being fired upon with lightning-like speed by any of the President's Secret Service guards in the follow-up car (who all had their backs to Oswald throughout the entire shooting). A very smart ""delay"" on Oswald's part.

As I said, Oswald was no dunce. That fact was proven yet again after his arrest, when he shouted ""I'm just a patsy!"" on Live television. Those four words have sent CTers scurrying in all directions, looking for (non-existent) ""evidence"" to try and prove Oswald was right when he uttered his well-timed ""Patsy"" motto.

But please also remember that the ""Patsy"" declaration came out of Oswald's mouth just one second after he spouted a provable lie about having been ""taken in"" by the Dallas police because of his Russian ties. That was obviously a lie, and Oswald (plus everybody else with half a brain cell) knew WHY it was a lie -- because he had actually been ""taken in"" on suspicion of killing Officer Tippit, and Oswald knew this beyond all doubt.

So, it makes me wonder just WHY the ""Let's Free Oswald"" conspiracy brigade insists upon attaching so much credibility to Oswald's ""I'm just a patsy"" whitewash, which were words that IMMEDIATELY followed a known LIE. If he was lying one moment (and he was) -- then why would anyone think he would suddenly do an about-face and start telling the TRUTH the following moment?

Oswald's post-12:30 actions on the afternoon of 11-22-63 fit perfectly with the idea of a Lone-Nut Communist (practically on the spur of the moment) taking his gun to work the day he knew he might have a chance to change history.

And as it turned out -- he did change it. And I'm guessing that Lee Harvey Oswald was just as shocked as everybody else that he actually got a chance to pull that trigger on a completely-vacant 6th Floor that November afternoon.

-------------

It seems to me that many conspiracy theorists would rather look ANYWHERE for the ""true killers"" of John Kennedy except the one place where the true killer really resided -- on the 6th Floor of the TSBD (where a man who was positively identified as Lee Harvey Oswald was actually seen squeezing off his last of three rifle shots in the direction of the President's limousine).

Every single discrepancy in the case, and every gaffe made by the Dallas Police or the FBI (and there were some mistakes, as can be expected in any criminal case), have been blown up by CTers to Herculean importance and isolated from the ""whole"" of the JFK case in an attempt to prove that somebody else besides Oswald committed the two murders that LHO was charged with on November 22nd. (Although, implacably, the identity of this ""somebody else"" is never, ever revealed by conspiracists. We're just supposed to take it on ""faith"", I guess, that there was ""somebody else"", despite a complete lack of physical evidence to bolster such ""somebody else"" allegations.)

And by isolating those individual items that CTers claim ""don't add up to LHO's guilt"", the theorists have succeeded in some circles in turning a relatively-simple murder case (two cases including Tippit's, which is and was a no-brainer in favor of Oswald's guilt from Day 1) into a convoluted, complicated case of massive conspiratorial proportions, with Oswald not only being innocent of BOTH murders -- but with many CTers also wishing to absolve Lee Oswald of ALL connection with even the massive ""plot"" they advocate. Totally and outrageously ridiculous.

A few examples of what I'm talking about -- re. the ""isolation"" of certain evidence that makes CTers scream ""frame up"" and ""conspiracy"", etc. ----

>> The Tippit murder weapon being identified initially as an ""automatic"" weapon, instead of what it turned out to be -- Oswald's non-automatic revolver.

>> The rifle in the TSBD being innocently mis-labelled a ""Mauser"" initially by police, instead of what we later know it really was -- Oswald's ""Carcano"".

>> The ONE single witness at the Tippit scene who said she saw two men involved in the shooting of Officer Tippit -- instead of what we later KNOW occurred: Oswald, ALONE, was at the scene of the murder, per the multiple witnesses who do not back up Acquilla Clemmons' claim of two killers.

>> JFK's head moving violently backward after the fatal head shot -- which is probably the single biggest example of ""isolating"" a particular item in the case which has CT promoters telling us that it ""proves conspiracy"", instead of examining ALL the possibilities of why JFK's head did what it did on November 22 -- with a PROVEN possibility being: a head can go backward, toward the source of the gunfire, when shot from behind. That fact has been proven by people WAY more qualified than I (or the CTers) to make such an assessment. But staunch theorists in the popular ""It Couldn't Have Been Oswald"" club stand firm by their ""I just don't believe it"" stance.

>> Oswald's not being out of breath or excited when confronted by Officer Baker in the lunch room after the shooting. This, to many CTers, is somehow virtual PROOF that Oswald was innocent. IMO, the CTers who espouse that belief just aren't looking at the situation in the proper context and light. For, if Oswald had just shot the President on the 6th Floor, he would have no doubt somewhat EXPECTED the building to be crawling with cops a very short time after the shots rang out.

He HAD to know that the building from which he was shooting would be surrounded quickly -- therefore, he wasn't the least bit surprised to see a gun-toting policeman in that lunch room when he (Oswald) was in there. In my ""LN"" view, Oswald's calm demeanor spells ""Guilt"" way more than it does ""Innocence"" -- because any totally-innocent person in that same situation IS going to be scared to death and ask: ""What the hell is going on? I didn't do anything!"". But Oswald didn't do this; and didn't NEED to do this ... because he already KNEW what had just happened, and knew who had caused the turmoil. And he also knew that his employment status in the building would ""clear"" him for the time being.

See what I mean about isolating certain things and removing them from the bigger picture? The CTers are experts at doing this and then attaching the word ""conspiracy"" around each item as if that single item itself proves the whole ""CT case"". Well, it does not.

What ""proves"" that Oswald was guilty of being a double-murderer in November of 1963 (even without the benefit of a trial, which, unfortunately, we'll never see) is the TOTALITY OF THE DAMNING EVIDENCE AGAINST LEE HARVEY OSWALD. And this ""totality"" is overwhelming in scope -- as any CTer would be able to see if the Oliver Stone-like blinders (as well as the ""Men Who Killed Kennedy""-believing blinders) could be blasted from their eyeballs.",1138924800,6,17122,4.881461061337009

74934,1,0788600931,"The A&E documentary series ""The Men Who Killed Kennedy"" is a very popular multi-part program, with many people boldly proclaiming that it ""proves a conspiracy existed to kill President Kennedy in 1963"". But, in my personal opinion, such conspiracy-""proving"" declarations are misplaced when it comes to ""TMWKK"" or any of the other ""Pro-CT"" books, videos, or TV shows that have been showered upon the public since the day JFK was slain on a Dallas street on November 22nd, 1963.

Virtually everything within the 9-part mini-series TMWKK (the first six of which were released on home video in both VHS and DVD formats) that the program's producers tout as evidence of conspiracy has been explained in non-conspiratorial ways both before and since these episodes originally aired.

I'm a ""Lone-Nutter"" and am not the least bit bashful in admitting to that less-than-widely-popular assassination stance. I firmly believe that Lee Harvey Oswald, acting all by himself, took his $21 mail-order Mannlicher-Carcano rifle with him to work at the Texas School Book Depository on the morning of 11/22/63, and got extremely lucky when he found he had the whole sixth floor of that building to himself at precisely the time when JFK's motorcade slowly drove through Dealey Plaza at 12:30 PM on that Friday afternoon. Oswald then squeezed off three shots from his bolt-action military rifle in approximately 8.2 seconds, killing the President and severely wounding Texas Governor John Connally.

Every last bit of the physical evidence (and a whole bunch of circumstantial evidence as well) leads to the above ""LN"" scenario involving only Lee Oswald being the true scenario with respect to who killed John Kennedy.

There is so much evidence to show that Oswald was the lone killer of JFK that lawyer and author Vincent T. Bugliosi was prompted to make the following gutsy statement in 1986:

""Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in the assassination of President Kennedy. The evidence is absolutely overwhelming that he carried out the tragic shooting all by himself. In fact, you could throw 80 percent of the evidence against him out the window and there would still be more than enough left to convince any reasonable person of his sole role in the crime."" -- V. Bugliosi

I, for one, find it difficult to disagree with anything Mr. Bugliosi has to say with respect to the JFK assassination, mainly because he knows the case like the back of his hand and possesses a level of built-in ""common sense"" that seems to gush forth in every book he's ever written or in any case he ever brought to trial in a court of law. And VB's common sense and logical thinking (plus his vast knowledge of the evidence in the JFK case) are hard things for conspiracy theorists to combat.

Vincent even once ""prosecuted"" Lee Oswald for JFK's murder....albeit just in a ""simulated"" sense. It was in 1986 when Mr. Bugliosi secured a ""Guilty"" verdict out of a sworn-in jury from Dallas during the 21-hour televised docu-trial, ""On Trial: Lee Harvey Oswald"".

Below I've re-printed another unambiguous comment made a few years ago by Mr. Bugliosi, leaving no doubt as to who Vince thinks is solely responsible for JFK's death:

""There was no plot, no conspiracy. JFK wasn't murdered by anti-Castro Cubans, the mob, or rogue CIA agents. In almost 40 years, there has not been one scintilla of proof tying the assassination to anyone but Oswald. There have been theories, but no evidence. Oswald had the motive, the opportunity, and the skill to kill President Kennedy."" -- V. Bugliosi

Part #4 of ""The Men Who Killed Kennedy"" (titled ""The Patsy"") is the portion of this cable-TV mini-series which boils my blood more than any other single installment. Mainly because it's just so downright silly! And the contemptible comments that came from the lips of former New Orleans D.A. Jim Garrison at the end of the program are just beyond belief (and beyond ludicrous as well). Garrison made the following statement as Part 4 of TMWKK drew to a close (a quote which was even accompanied by a few crocodile tears, no less, making these comments even more laughable):

""Lee Oswald was totally, unequivocally, completely innocent of the assassination .... and the fact that history, or in the re-writing of history, disinformation has made a villain out of this young man who wanted nothing more than to be a fine Marine .... is in some ways the greatest injustice of all."" -- J. Garrison

Now, for a conspiracy believer to say that Lee Oswald might have been part of some kind of a conspiracy on 11/22 is one thing -- but to elevate this obvious murderer (just by using the J.D. Tippit killing as one example, without even factoring in the Kennedy slaying) to the stature of a fallen martyr, as Garrison did via that quote, just reeks with disingenuousness. Such hollow glorification and unjustifiable praise of Oswald is just sickening, in my view.

Keep in mind that the above quote came out of the mouth of the same Earling Carothers (""Jim"") Garrison who stated in a 1967 ""Playboy"" Magazine interview that he was still (as of late 1967) of the opinion that Lee Oswald might very well have been standing on the Depository's front steps at the time Kennedy was being killed.......

""The Altgens photograph indicates the very real possibility that at the moment Oswald was supposed to have been crouching in the sixth-floor window of the Depository shooting Kennedy, he may actually have been standing outside the front door watching the Presidential motorcade."" -- J. Garrison; Via October 1967 issue of ""Playboy""

Now, that Garrison quote above was uttered three full years after Billy Lovelady testified to the Warren Commission that it was Lovelady, and not Oswald, who is seen in the Altgens photo. And still Garrison had the gall to cast doubts about the identity of the man in the doorway in that interview. Disgraceful.

A very rarely-seen video clip of Marguerite Oswald, LHO's mother, is also part of ""The Patsy"" installment of TMWKK. It shows Marguerite visiting her son's grave shortly after Lee's death at the hands of Jack Ruby, and is a clip that is both sad and hysterically-funny at the same time. Although, unlike Garrison's similar teary-eyed eulogy in this same program, at least Marguerite Oswald has the excuse of being the assassin's mother, and therefore a built-in flesh-and-blood bias is obviously seeping into her hilarious cemetery statement, which follows:

""Lee Harvey Oswald, my son, even after his death, has done more for his country than any other living human being."" -- Marguerite Oswald

I'm afraid I cannot hold back the boisterous laughter each time I replay that news clip showing Mrs. Oswald making the above statement. I know she was mourning the loss of her 24-year-old son -- but, given the evidence that says Marguerite's boy was unquestionably guilty of killing multiple human beings in 1963, such an inaccurate and off-the-wall statement can only elicit laughter from anyone who has studied the Kennedy and Tippit murder cases.

One of the main reasons I find Part 4 (""The Patsy"") so silly is because the ""plotters"" (per this program and according to just about every CTer I've ever encountered) evidently couldn't have cared less that their ""Frame The Lone Patsy"" plan was almost certain to fail right from the get-go due to the fact they (the proverbial and always-unknown and unidentified ""plotters/assassins/evil-doers"") had assigned MULTIPLE gunmen to fire bullets into John Kennedy's body on November 22. Which means that a whole bunch of stuff was going to need to be ""fixed"" and ""planted"" and re-arranged after the shooting in order for ALL of the evidence to shine back on JUST Lee Oswald and his one rifle in the Book Depository.

Therefore, via such an illogical ""Multi-Gun"" Patsy Plot, unless every frontal shot totally misses everybody and everything on Elm Street, there was bound to be lots of evidence of conspiracy to ""cover up"" immediately after the shooting stopped.

How could any band of conspirators, needing just Lee Oswald blamed for the assassination, possibly have been so brazen and reckless (and brainless) to have thought (on November 21st) that it was a good idea to frame their one fall guy by shooting the President with many different guns, from several different angles?

To put it bluntly -- There is simply no way in the world that anyone wanting to frame one man in the Depository would have placed multiple shooters (front and rear) in Dealey Plaza to kill the one target, when the job could just as easily have been carried out by placing a single shooter in the ""Sniper's Nest"" of the Book Depository (thereby eliminating the need for any after-the-fact ""planting"" and/or ""body alterations"", etc.). And, per my own beliefs, the job WAS, indeed, accomplished by just one person (Oswald) firing from that one window.

Another ridiculous portion of one of the most commonly-believed ""Patsy"" plots (as depicted in Oliver Stone's movie, 'JFK') is the part where these ace ""plotters"" evidently couldn't care less where their ""Patsy"" was located at the exact time of JFK's murder. Because, per Stone's film, Oswald is free to roam around on the lower floors of the Depository at his leisure. Which means, if he's seen by anybody at 12:30, Oswald has an airtight alibi that gets him off the hook for killing JFK, and thusly the entire pre-arranged ""Frame Oswald As The Lone Patsy"" plan goes up in a puff of smoke -- all because the plotters were too stupid to keep the Patsy where they needed him during the shooting.

Quite predictably, nobody involved with TMWKK programs believes that the ""Single-Bullet Theory"" is the correct version of the way Kennedy and Connally were wounded. But, again, when some common sense is applied to this aspect of the assassination, the ""SBT"" becomes the only possible and logical way the victims could have been injured. Believing otherwise opens up the floodgates for a wide array of nonsensical theories and sheer guesswork as to how it ""really"" happened. With such unsupported theories featuring multiple bullets that enter Kennedy's upper body and never exit at all.

Then the CTers have to explain away the disappearance of all the various bullets that pelted JFK and JBC. All of the missiles within any ""conspiracy""-slanted version of the event just simply vanish off the planet without a trace. Plus there's the ""sideways-entering"" bullet that went into Connally's back, which obviously hit something (or someone) before striking the Governor.

In short -- ANY theory that CTers are forced to ""substitute"" for the SBT lacks any common sense whatsoever and certainly lacks any hard evidence of ever having occurred. And, moreover, any alternative conspiracy scenario to the Warren Commission's very-logical Single-Bullet Conclusion is just flat-out stupid-sounding when compared to the SBT version of events.

The Single-Bullet Theory is a theory declared to be true by both the WC and the HSCA, and is a scenario that involves absolutely ZERO ""loose ends"" whatsoever. It's a reasonable conclusion based on the evidence in the case. Evidence such as:

JFK and JBC being aligned in the car to ""receive"" the Single Bullet (CE399) from Oswald's gun being fired from the TSBD. .... The downward angle of the wounds in both victims is consistent with one bullet going through both men. .... The ""oblong""-shaped back wound on JBC is consistent with the SBT. .... The Zapruder Film shows JFK and JBC reacting at very nearly an identical point in time to first being hit by gunfire. .... Not a single bullet was found inside JFK's back or neck. .... No whole bullets were found in the back-seat areas of the limo. .... And -- Bullet CE399, found near Connally's stretcher in Parkland Hospital, was definitively linked to Oswald's rifle.

So, once you can get past the silly notion that a conspirator ""planted"" Bullet CE399, or would have even WANTED to ""plant"" CE399 in the hospital (AT A TIME BEFORE SAID CONSPIRATOR COULD HAVE POSSIBLY KNOWN IF SUCH A PLANTED BULLET WOULD TURN OUT TO BE AN EXTRA, UNNEEDED BULLET IN THE CASE THAT MIGHT BLOW THE WHOLE PLOT WIDE OPEN), it then becomes fairly clear that the ONE and ONLY bullet found anywhere near the two victims, a bullet that came out of a gun that was found in a building overlooking the location of the assassination, is the one and only bullet that caused all of Governor Connally's wounds and JFK's non-fatal wounds.

What I'd really like to have happen is for some crackerjack CTer to provide a reasonable and believable conspiracy-based alternative to the SBT that uses logic and, above all, the known evidence in the case (or at least a percentage of it) and the two victims' known wound locations.

I've yet to hear such a reasonable-sounding alternative. Because in order to postulate such an anti-SBT ""alternative"", a conspiracy theorist has to actually purport that TWO bullets (from high-powered rifles no doubt--because WHY would some idiotic plotters use just a couple of BB guns to kill the President with?) -- TWO bullets -- just STOP inside JFK's soft flesh in his neck and back...without striking a single bone or solid object in his body. Why? And, more importantly, HOW could this have possibly occurred? Two ""misfires""? Come now!

And that CTer has to also purport that THREE different gunmen did the damage to TWO different victims at the EXACT same time (per the Z-Film timeframe....and if not ""exactly"" the same time, then certainly within well under 1.5 seconds of one another, which eliminates the idea that just a mere two shooters could have accomplished this ""alternate"" version of the 2-victim wounding).

And that same CTer has to postulate that the THREE wounds on TWO men, occurring virtually at the same instant and being caused by THREE separate guns....ALL somehow, some way, by some act of the Almighty, just happened to align themselves into a triple-wound pattern that would FOOL all of the official Government investigative panels that would be poring over the case in the months and years after 11/22/63 into thinking (falsely, mind you!) that these THREE bullet wounds from THREE guns were all probably caused by just ONE single bullet found at Parkland Memorial Hospital.

Some great ""alternative"", huh? Anybody want to take it to Vegas and see if anyone bites?

Or --- The only other ""alternative"" is to say that a bullet did go all the way through JFK, but somehow (via some weird Kreskin-like magically-swerving bullet) missed John Connally seated directly in front of JFK's neck.

And then that CT alternative has to incorporate yet another ""disappearing bullet"" (among several in this case that were never seen by any non-plotters) that struck the limo someplace.....and the hole(s) in the limo were somehow stitched up by the ever-efficient ""Conspiracy Cover-Up"" branch of Martha Stewart & Associates, Inc. in a brief timespan between Dallas and the time Robert Frazier examined the limo for damage (and found NONE in the back-seat and jump-seat areas) on the night of November 22nd at the White House garage.

Each of the above ""alternatives"" totally ignores all of the known evidence in the case...plus they both totally ignore ordinary garden-variety common sense as well.

I think I'd rather stick with the known facts in evidence -- which is physical evidence that I have no reason at all to think was (or even could have been) ALL faked and/or manipulated by an impeccably-perfect ""Let's Frame Oswald"" team of cover-up agents.

And once a person who has looked at the physical evidence in the JFK case gets to the ""This Stuff Couldn't Possibly Have ALL Been Faked"" point (including the wealth of evidence showing Oswald to be guilty of killing Officer J.D. Tippit too), then only three obvious words remain to be uttered aloud -- OSWALD DID IT!

74935,5,0788600931,"The first six chapters of The Men Who Killed Kennedy is a must read before viewing chapters seven , eight and nine.  I do agree with another reviewer in respect to this series lacking cohesion.  However, I consider this ""brainstorming"" in a way and a chance to see how complex this operation was. Who participated in it and who covered it up will be explained in the remaining three chapters. The Zapruder film sets the stage for everything to follow.  From the Zapruder film,  we know that Kennedy was shot from the front.  Since the Parkland Doctors also confirm this , we are sure there was a cover up since the autopsy photos show no rear exit wound. The Love Field Secret Service Standown confirms it was an inside job.  These facts are enough to conclude we were not told the truth and one could just stop there. I guess what many people are asking is the government to finally admit the aformentioned obvious facts, but they continue to deny it, bringing from OJ Simpson fame,  Michael Boden to try to convice us one moves in the opposite direction of the force of a bullet! You will see in the final chapters two doctors clearly stating both the neck and head wound are wounds from the front. You cant tell from Zapruder where the neck wound comes from. But it is clear to anyone where the head shot came from.  My roomate,  who is an ex-Marine, stated he never saw the Zapruder film beyond the sign before.  I am sure this is the case for most people. When he did see it ,  he couldn't believe the whole film was kept from him all this time ( he is 40) and that it is so obvious that the shot is from the front.  Also, he pointed out the light reflecting on the bullet as it comes from the front. This is obvious to a soldier. Ironically,  just like Nostradamus predicted.  "" A lighting bolt will kill a great leader during daylight and the assasin will never be found""  You would have thought they would have thrown in the towel when the Zapruder film came out but not these people. Finally, forget the less credible people and concentrate on the ones who are stating facts, like Cyril Wecht and Fletcher Prouty.  They know what they are talking about, and are very credible people. Enjoy this series and prepare yourself for the final chapters, which will knock you off your feet when you see the now infamous Love Field video where during the start of the fatal motorcade Secret Service Agent Henry J Rybka begins to jog alongside the presidential limousine. He is immediately called back by his shift leader and commander of the follow-up car detail, Emory P. Roberts. Rybka's dismay and confusion is made manifest by his unambiguous body language: He throws up his arms several times before, during and after the follow-up car passes him. He was not being allowed to do his job. Incredibly , the frustrated and patriotic Rybka did not enter the follow up car and was left behind at the airport! This video is available on the banned last episodes and is detailed online in a grimly narrated version ( the music is from the funeral , with the President riding to his death) .

74936,5,0788600931,"I've read soooo many books on the assassination that I figured this purchase would be redundant. It certainly wasn't; I missed so much... it now takes center stage as my prized possession.

The film clip of Jack Ruby admitting LBJ was behind it, the body count of witnesses and the interviews of people who were there I've found nowhere else, and are absolutely priceless.

It's so pathetic that even in this forum we're still seeing CIA plants trying to steer us away from the truth and towards other CIA-financed authors such as Posner and McMillan: ""Rather than waste your precious time viewing someone's immaginary theory, why not invest yourself in the facts of the case by reading ""Case Closed"", by Gerald Posner, or ""Marina and Lee"", by Prisilla McMillian? These books will ground you in the facts, not unsupported fairy tales.""

These are a couple of abominable frauds with proven connections to the Agency (see the book ""The Assassinations""). These two rats will write anything the Agency wants; for money, and to vent their hatred of decent human beings. Your day of reckoning is coming.

Posner presumes guilt and ""loads"" his statements, saying things like, ""When Oswald shot Kennedy"", to make up your mind for you in advance, perhaps imagining readers won't notice. Honest people don't do that. As a lawyer, he should know that there was never enough evidence to convict Lee Harvey Oswald, had he lived.

""Innocent until proven guilty"" means nothing to a Spirit Murdering fascist who attempts to convince himself of his own power by decieving the minds of others, but only ends up confessing his subordinate position through chronic fear, an utter lack of self-worth and a wasted life. Look in the mirror Posner. Do you like what you see?

It's rather common to hear of wrongdoing by the CIA. I saw a graph recently that showed American citizen's belief in their government plummetting after the Kennedy Assassination. Almost no one accepted the Warren Commission Report and such a cover up has casted doubt on our government ever since.

This ""High Cabal"" as Churchill called them obviously doesn't start with the CIA, or the Federal Reserve. It predates Christianity, but it's quite simple. There are bums who seek handouts and never try to rise, and there are bums who gain a position over others but still yearn for that same handout, taking it by force, by skimming, whatever is neccessary to defeat justice, honor and civility. These are not great men and they will not be remembered like an Edison or a Ford. They are the most creative parasites on the planet, and the most deeply engrained.

Currency control has changed EIGHT times since America's inception. The most vocal fighter against irrational banking was Andrew Jackson; not Kennedy or Lincoln (google ""Jackson Bank Veto""). He fought and defeated in his time what has morphed into the Federal Reserve Bank. Before the Civil War, such bankers were buying politicians, planting press stories, steering elections, stealing freedoms, killing people--anything to assure a fascist cushion between themselves and existence.

Do we ever hear anything bad about the Federal Reserve? In Jackson's time, they were entrenched 16 years deep and it was difficult to rout them out then. They did try to kill him. Now they are ninety years deep. They have owned many Presidents, they control the Justice and State Departments, and the CIA secretly furthers their agenda.

Nothing happens at the ""assassination level"" without their approval. In today's world, America is struggling in recession (bankruptcy) mostly due to the $360 Billion we now pay to the Fed for their generous ""Debt-Money"" System, and that is an exponentially increasing burden. EVERY dollar in our country has interest being paid on it as if it were borrowed! Due to this, bankruptcy for America is a mathematical certainty. (Imagine if you had to pay interest not just on every dollar you owed, but on every dollar you made! America IS!)

With changes in the laws, soon none of us will be permitted to walk away from our debts and start over--as if our hard economic times is our own personal fault. That's right. YOU'RE the target now.

We are all about to become debt slaves, as they intend. If you want to have a chance at recovery, if you want your kids to have a chance at a decent future, join me and I'll give you the Moral Armor neccessary to beat down these parasites and restore America to what it was meant to be. They CAN be defeated, but not without YOUR empowerment. If you can't stand up or are afraid to, I'll show you how.

74937,1,0788600931,"""The Men that Killed Kennedy"" is a ponderous 9-part series that details a huge intricate conspiracy to kill President John Kennedy.  Like so many other JFK conspiracy theories, this production does not let the facts of the assassination get in the way of telling a good story.  And to anyone who has any knowledge of the facts of the case, (the hard physical evidence), ""The Men that Killed Kennedy"" is nothing more than sheer speculation and immaginary happenings. The ""proof"" of the conspiracy comes from very questionable and unreliable sources, sources that cannot be trusted to gain the truth. There is no hard provable evidence here; rather, its speculation and imagination.

Completely at odds with the Warren Commission's findings that Lee Oswald acted alone in killing JFK, this production posits a grand conspiracy involving hundreds of people, many in the uppermost levels of our government.  Clearly, to anyone who has a working knowledge of the Kennedy assassination, this ""conspiracy"" is another in a long line of unprovable theories.  There is absolutely no documentation or hard evidence that there was a grand conspiracy to kill JFK, and this film does nothing to further the case.

Rather than waste your precious time viewing an immaginary theory, why not invest yourself in the facts of the case by reading ""Case Closed"", by Gerald Posner, or ""Marina and Lee"", by Prisilla McMillian?  These books will ground you in the facts about the case and the assassin, not unsupported fairy tales. You must also view the computer analysis of the Zapruder film produced by Meyers and Vaughan, which proves beyond all reasonable doubt that the two bullets which killed Kennedy and injured Connally came from the 6th floor SE window of the Texas Schoolbook Depository (and not the grassy knoll, or a storm sewer, the overpass, etc., etc.).

Two thumbs down for this long-winded (yawn) convoluted presentation.

By a strange twist of fate I happened to be recording these episodes when they originally aired back in 2003 in case anyone wants copies.  They still contain the commercials but they play ok.  People ask me for them sometimes.

The Documetary series was shown annually on A&E & The History Channel from 1991-2004, after the allegations of LBJ's Involvement in the final segment became heated , the series hasn't been seen since, which is certainly a shame because 8 of the 9 parts have nothing to do with Johnson whatsoever. Part 7 on the Medical cover up, and a lengthy overview of possible tampering with the Presidential limo may be the most explosive revelations in the entire series. Many of the Researchers/Authors/Witnesses are no longer around such as Col. Fletcher Prouty, Gov. John Connally who makes some very moving comments as does Sen. Ralph Yarborough,,Witness and Photographer Maj. Phil Willis, Author Harold Weisberg, 2 alleged Eyewitnesses to a grassy knoll gunman Gordon Arnold, & Ed Hoffman, Author Larry Ray Harris,Author Seth Kantor who wrote a litte known, but excellent book on Jack Ruby,& many former Police Officers in Dallas to name some. The afforementioned Turner does a very good job of inserting archival footage, with contempraneous interviews, that are succinct, and quite revealing. Nothing boring here, only drawback is a few witnessess may be embellishing or fabricating, but all in all it's highly provocative and important, say in a few years you wanna hear what a particular person has to say that's gone, it's a good historical documetary to have. Also, this is better than when it was shown on TV in the 90's as there is about 5 extra minutes of footage per episode till the fifth one, longer interviews,& a couple new ones that were originally edited due to time constraints.  .",1113868800,11,1767,4.946127946127946

74947,4,0788600931,"In 1988, British ITV did a 5-part documentary called the ""Men Who Killed Kennedy"". It was a scattershot effort (of course, the subject is as rococo as rococo gets) and it wasn't perfect, but it had many, many worthwhile pieces of material and interviews, all mixed in together, to be dismissed.

In 1995, the History Channel commissioned the same producer to do a chapter 6, ""The Truth Shall Make You Free"". Also some good data, though this time it made the Kennedys look a bit slimier than I appreciate, but that seems to be the media-view today: (Insisting that Bobby maintained ""Operation Mongoose"" against Castro singlehandedly, even after the Cuban Missile Crisis, the poor CIA a hapless pawn in Bobby's evil plans.... yeah, right. Richard Helms would be thrilled). Although Lt. Dan Marvin's interview may have been the most chilling of the entire series.

But the real interesting thing is what happened in 2003 when the History Channel, on the 40th anniversary of JFK's assassination, aired 3 additional, new chapters: 7, 8 and 9...

I've seen them. These new chapters present mostly old but not-unsubstantially backed-up material about Oswald, as well as ""rumor"" about a certain ex-president's alleged complicity in the assassination.

In some circles, it caused an uproar, with Lady Bird, President Carter and Bill Moyers (whom I like very much) reportedly leading the charge to eradicate the Final Chapters from the airwaves and from the market [which is why it's ""out of stock"" now]. The MWKK version still available only includes chapters 1 thru 6.

But I wonder: what's the big deal? Students of this subject aren't going to be shocked by the content... But others (at the most benign end of the spectrum) are still in denial about certain issues -- and certain figures in our collective past.",1097798400,27,1806,4.98671096345515

74950,5,0788600931,"This DVD is a good overview of the assassination of Kennedy.  True, it does focus on the conspiracy theories and it is not an unbiased look at the evidence; however, the interviews with people who have a lot to say are engrossing and the ""evidence"" produced is thought provoking.
There is no doubt that evidence exists to dispute the findings of the Warren Commission report on the assassination of President Kennedy.  This DVD presents a lot of that evidence in a organized fashion.  It is good to actually see the people interviewed who say the shots were coming from the grassy knoll.  I liked looking at the photographic evidence that critics claim show a person (badge man) shooting from the knoll (I don't see anything).  The DVD at least allows you to see the people and the evidence and make a lot of judgments for yourself.
A lot of the witnesses are not convincing to me, and a lot of the so called evidence just looks like junk.  I have a natural tendency to distrust testimony from strippers (or former strippers) and I don't see what others say is clearly present in certain photographs.  I am a lawyer (not a trial lawyer) so I suppose I look at evidence a little differently than most and probably take a more skeptical view, but I still like to see it myself and not let someone else tell me what something shows or who to believe.
I think the DVD does raise significant questions about the killing of the President as presented by the Warren Report on the assassination.  I have read portions of the Warren Report and I have read a few books on this subject authored by both the critics and those who support the Commission's conclusions.  While I would say this DVD does contain some speculation that is impossible for the viewer to make an independent decision on, and it contains a lot of language that is less than clinical, it does present a lot of solid evidence.  Actual interviews with the Dallas police officers who were there and who talked with Oswald and Ruby are just invaluable.  So are a lot of the other interviews.  Just a list of those who have been sent to an early grave that had facts to support a shot being fired from the grassy knoll is unnerving.  To see some of those same people on screen telling their story near in time to the killing of the President is compelling.  If you believe what they have to say a lot of the Warren Commission's findings are not accurate.
If you are not interested in mysteries this isn't for you.  In the end there are a lot of theories that can be supported depending on which set of facts you find to be most important.  The assassination of President Kennedy is a mystery because so much is left unexplained.  For example, there is no doubt the evidence in the National Archives has been corrupted.  The brain is missing and at least some other evidence has disappeared.  Once evidence has been tampered with a person is allowed to believe it is all under suspicion.  The evidence is the foundation of analysis, and when that is gone mystery remains.
So the viewer will not get a solid ""we have it all figured out"" explanation at the end.  No murderer jumps up to confess in the last scene and reveal all.  The mystery remains and the uncomfortable feeling that comes with mystery - real mystery - is there.  We will probably never figure it out because the list of ""oops"" or whatever is almost endless.  Criminal incompetence on the part of the Secret Service, incompetent medical examiners, missing evidence, incompetent police procedures, consistent failures to follow even the most elemental criminal evidence protection steps, failures to tape or record critical interrogations, failure to follow up important information, investigators ignoring certain aspects of the case (who were the men who displayed Secret Service credentials to the police on the day of the murder), inconsistent statements from important witnesses etc.  This is a real mystery.
A lot of people are murdered every year without explanation.  The real world can be a messy and inhospitable place.  We tend to want to think that the murder of the President of the United States would be different.  With some of the best police agencies in the world working on the case we could figure it out and close the file and be at least comfortable with the idea that we know what happened.  This film will not allow you to think that way.  This was a messy event with a lot going wrong - as it usually does - and this DVD lets you know that.  No nice world tied up in a nice package with a bow on it.  No...this is reality.  And a lot of it.
A very good DVD and well worth the price.",1079481600,130,4627,4.569696969696969
74951,2,0788600931,"When you get down to it, sadly, the objective investigations (whether in video or on paper) into the JFK murder are few and far between. Too many of them have one bias or another, and the results are usually a collection of half-truths and tantalizing but ultimately unusable evidence. These types of slanted investigations hold true for the Oswald-did-it-alone camp, as well as for the everybody-except-for-Walter-Cronkite-did-it school. The Men Who Killed Kennedy is no exception.
To the newly arrived investigator into the events of 11/22/63, there is a lot of intriguing speculation here, some of which has not been disputed. Still, there is a lot of shaky goings-on here. The ""computer enhancement"" that proves that David Ferrie was one of the shooters is an embarrassing case of ""computer manipulation"". And the guy shooting from the sewer? How did I ever miss that!?!?! Of course! That explains everything! (Shheeeesh!)

74952,5,0788600931,"This is the best video series ever on the JFK assassination.  I can't understand how anyone could believe the Warren Commission Report after seeing this series.  The Zapruder film clearly shows a large chunk of Kennedy's head being blown backwards.  How could one shot fired from the rear do this?  Any fool can see he had to be shot from the front. The doctors who treated Kennedy at Parkland Hospital said that he was shot in the right temple area.  People who handled the body said that Kennedy had a large hole in the back of his head.  Are they all lying?  Peter Jennings conveniently left these questions out of his whitewashed account, ""Beyond Conspiracy,"" and his documentary didn't even show the end of the Zapruder film until the end of the program; and then they didn't bother to comment on the shot from the front.
  I'm not a conspiracy nut; I just want the truth.  On jury duty you're asked to decide what is true or not true based on the evidence and your experiences in life.  Those of us old enough to remember the Kennedy assassination will probably never learn the absolute truth, but this video series offers the most plausible theory yet on what probably happened.",1072742400,16,1185,4.62200956937799

And while some effort is made to identify certain key assassination figures, a lot of the pieces of the puzzle are left for the viewer to put together - not all of it is spelled out for the audience.
The interviews alone make this tape worth the buying price, and the footage of Dealey Plaza. This type of information just doesn't come across the same in the pages of a book. I first saw this presented as a 5-part series on the A&E History Channel, and it was then being offered in a 5-tape set for significantly more than this set, which our daughter's school purchased for historical education. Which makes this 2-video set a real deal, and a worthwhile investment.",997574400,10,1295,4.785714285714286
74967,5,0788600931,"The Men Who Killed Kennedy is an amazing and thoughtfully detailed investigation series into the Assisination of President Kennedy.

I was lucky to catch one of the very best parts of the Men Who Killed Kenendy series, the LBJ video.

In this video, which aired ONCE on the History Channel back in 2003, LBJ was shown how he was directly involved in the JFK Assisination and how his friends knew and even assisted in some ways.

This video was so amazing and damaging, that LBJ's daughters sued The History Channel from ever re-showing the video again, and as of November 2003, the LBJ tape has NEVER been shown to the public.

This speaks volumes to the power of this series and of this one video itself. Not even leaches like Gerald Posner could ever have the type of impact that this series has had.

You will NOT be disappointed in The Men Who Killed Kennedy Series. Unlike other pro-Warren Commission books and programs, this series doesn't force feed you the single bullet theory.",989452800,,986,4.676300578034682
74968,5,0788600931,"It is all here in 4 hours! There is plenty of interviews by key figures who were there(Connelly, Mary Moorman, Beverly (Babushka Lady) Oliver, Helen Markham, Wesley Buell Frazier, Ruth Paine, even funeral director Paul Groody who prepared Oswald body). This film does not seem to try to focus on anyone theory, which I found refreshing. This documentary, rather, attempts to look at the events in Dallas and events afterwards as seen through the eyes of many different people.  There are, for example, interviews with the doctors at Parkland that inform the viewer of their valiant attempts to resucitate the President, funeral director Paul Groody who explains what happened when agents approached him about scars on Oswald's body, and how an exhumation was done in 1981 to confirm the identity of the body. There are interviews with Dallas policeman who recount the arrest of Oswald, and the televised murder of Oswald. The New Orlean's connection is also included with interviews of Jim Garrison who explains his theory about the role that Guy Bannister was suppposed to have played in the assasssination.  One of the most interesting theories is toward the beginning in which the viewer is told of an elaborate plot involving the Corsicans! The new photographic evidence supplied here by Gary Mack has probably caused some to rethink the events in Dallas. This is the definitive documentary of that terrible day in Dallas for the conspiracy minded and lone gunmen theorists alike.

See what most people don't know about this particular film documentary is that famous film director Oliver Stone got the idea to use part of this research film to do the 1991 movie called JFK which is really based upon years of Assassination research, two book authors known as Jim Garrison&Jim Marrs the trial of Jim Garrison written by Jim Garrison himself,and best selling book novel titled The plot that killed Kennedy written by Jim Marrs.

7790874,5,0788600931,"This is a must watch for any American interested in the truth surrounding the Coup de'tat which took place that day in Dallas.
Sadly, the original production was 9 episodes long, not 6. Due to threats of lawsuits from 2 very powerful, connected insiders and the network caving to pressures and threats, the final 3 episodes are no longer available. They were the most explosive, revealing parts of this excellent work of incredible investigative journalism. Since 2003, the last 3 episodes have been unavailable to the public.
I had a recording of all 9 parts myself. Unfortunately, my wife accidentally erased the final 4 episodes of the series. I am now without the all important final 3 parts of this crucial historical production of the reality behind an American Coup.
IF you can ever find the full 9 part series on ebay or Amazon, do yourself a favor and buy it immediately!
Still, the 6 parts still available are worth getting and watching with anyone interested in JFK or the truth about our government.",1509235200,2,1011,4.816091954022989

Fingers ARE POINTED, names are named. However, the latter doesn't mention JFK's June '63 Executive Order 11110, to restore the issuance of US currency to the US Treasury, or its implications for The Federal Reserve's control of US monetary system.",1509062400,4,527,5.285714285714286
7790876,5,0788600931,"We follow several theories including the Warren Commission and just passers by; each in reenacted so we can see that it was possible or not. In this case you start to think everyone is guilty except Oswald.

""The Men Who Killed Kennedy"", a six-part series; It is quite a bit to take in at one sitting. It looks like everyone is coming out of the woodwork. Where were these people when you could do something about it? And everyone had a gun or a camera. There were pictures of the people taking pictures and pictures of people with guns. There were shots from buildings, knolls, and even sewers. Everyone that ever had a grudge and even a group put together by Bobby Kennedy.

I do not want to tell too much, as that is why you are buying the film. You will finally be convinced it happened this way then they will convince you it happened that way. But you will be glued to the set the whole time.",1502668800,3,898,4.3076923076923075
