I can't wait for the DVD to see if it has some out takes and bonus tracks.

I would love to just hang out with these guys and Meaty for a day. How much fun woould that be.

Great show... can't get enough and looking forward to season two.",1179705600,,300,3.806451612903226
2751478,5,B000MX7V7A,"This is one of the funniest shows I have ever seen.  My husband and I are anxiously awaiting the DVD release.  We are constantly searching for re-runs on MTV2!  No matter how many times we watch the episodes, we laugh so hard tears come to our eyes!",1175212800,10,249,4.25531914893617
2751479,5,B000MX7V7A,"As a watcher of the show from day 1, I must say that this is one of the only recent shows on television that has made me laugh. Both Rob and Big are interesting and amusing people to watch, and the way Rob clowns his cousin Drama is almost worth the price of admission alone.

It's kind of tough to describe the show too much, because it's basically just two guys going around their regular lives doing crazy things and adding their own touches to everything. A staple of the show would have to be Big Black's motto ""DO WORK,"" which kind of summarizes the show just as well.

Genuine humor is the name of the game, whether it's seeing Big Black's friend Bam Bam smash one of those modern hanging chairs through the ceiling, or shooting up Drama with a paintball gun, it's all very funny.

Do yourself a favor and get this DVD if you think you can appreciate this ""Buddy comedy"" for what it's worth.",1172102400,9,898,4.333333333333333

Since then, of course, Rob has moved further into hours career and now has a show called Ridiculousness. Our 8 year old doesn't recall meeting Rob, but he was in love with his new show.

2751540,5,B000MX7V7A,Hilarious. I thoroughly enjoyed this show when it first aired and have continued to love it in the 8 years since. This show was already great but the fact that it's uncensored brings it to a whole new level.  It makes you see both Rob and Big Black in a totally different and even funnier way.

They can make an adventure and a laugh out of any situation that they're in along with a few friends and a loyal bullbog. They believe in life's what you make it and personally, I think that they have to the perfect recipe to dying knowing that you've lived it up right. You'll laugh.

2751614,4,B000MX7V7A,"I'm pretty sure that MTV wasn't targeting this show or DVD series to suburban housewives, but that's what I am  - in addition to being a huge Rob & Big fan. The DVD interviews and extras really support what I already suspected - that Rob and Chris have a deep friendship that goes beyond roomates or employer/employee. I espcially love the ""Meaty Reel"" that just shows highlights of his growth from little pup to full-grown Meat Bag. Skaters may enjoy Rob's tutorials at the end of each disc, but my favorite feature is finally being able to hear the full dialogue without all the annoying FCC beeps. These guys are just fun and funny to watch, and the episodes don't get old after multiple viewings. This DVD set is a great deal for the money, so Do Work and get to it.",1207440000,,770,4.422535211267606

Also, the gold in this set is the Dirty Girl video.  I would buy the set just for the video itself. I could watch it over and over and still laugh each time.  Uncle Jerry's visit is priceless.  He is so funny just being himself.  You could not script the things he says and does.  Once he gets into that Bud Light, there is no stopping him from repeating himself 50 times and touching Rob any chance he gets.  There is also a commentary option where they narrate the episode and that is funny also.  I love Rob and Big, they can do whatever they want and not care about how much it costs or how much time it wastes.  Do work son.",1204502400,,771,4.046357615894039

2751640,4,B000MX7V7A,"This show is awesome and both Rob and Big Black are hilarious!  Before this show started airing, I had never even heard of Rob Dyrdek but now I know that he and his bodyguard are excellent material for a TV show:)  Season 3 just started and I'm already loving every episode.  I wish I could get a pool painted by the same muralist that did theirs.  He is an amazing artist!",1200441600,,373,4.211267605633803
2751641,5,B000MX7V7A,"Rob and Big is a reality show that tweaks The Odd Couple set-up with pro-skate boarder Rob Dyrdek, a scrawny white guy, and his best friend and bodyguard Christopher ""Big Black"" Boykin, a 300+lb black man, who share a house in the Hollywood Hills. Despite wildly contrasting physical attributes and backgrounds, Rob and Big's personalities compliment each other well: Rob is chatty and full of goofy energy while Big is more laid back and plays it cool.

""Mississippi"" marks the first appearance of Big's beloved Uncle Jerry as the boys attend Big's family reunion deep in the ""Dirty South."" How does one begin to describe Uncle Jerry? He looks to be in his 60s and is barely intelligible but is funny as hell. He lets Rob borrow one of his suits for church and shows genuine compassion for the boys that is endearing as he is funny.

Hands down and without a doubt, the best episode of either season is ""Bobby Light"" where Rob tries his hand at music by creating a persona known as Bobby Light, a one-hit wonder R&B sensation. He records a song called, ""Dirty Girl"" along with filming an accompanying music video. He enlists the help of Big, his buddy Bam Bam and Uncle Jerry returns to play a prominent role. How does one do justice to Uncle Jerry and his unique take on life? Highlights include a Rob and Uncle Jerry dance-off, Rob assembling his Bobby Light outfit (including wig!) and the shooting of the ""Dirty Girl"" video.

Every episode features an audio commentary by Rob, Big, executive producers Jeff Tremaine and Ruben Fleischer. They have a lot of fun reliving these moments from their lives, laughing at some of their exploits. Your enjoyment of these commentaries really depends on the episode and which ones you like the most.

Disc Two features extras for the first season, including ""Special Meaty Puppy Footage,"" 15 additional scenes of Meaty as an adorable puppy back when Rob and Big first got him.

""Rob & Big - `The Real Deal'"" takes a behind the scenes look at Rob & Big. They talk about how they met, their relationship and how they became roommates. Of course, they talk about Meaty and what he means to them. Rob & Big also talk about some of the highlights of Season 1 with clips.

Also included are 23 deleted scenes including the installation of an ATM machine in their house. We also see Meaty and Big learning how to swim. The Chunky Boys perform live and Rob goes shopping for jewelry in order to go for that ""'80s football star"" look. We also see Rob and Big face off in a hot dog eating contest. Also included is Drama learning how to drive only to get in an accident.

""Skate Tutorials"" features Rob teaching the fundamentals of skateboarding in these brief tutorials. He really makes it look easy but as anyone quickly realizes, to pull these moves off well you have to practice them a helluva lot.

""Interviews"" are the extended versions of the soundbites in ""The Real Deal"" extra.

Disc Four contains all of the extras for Season 2. The ""Dirty Girl"" music video that was shown being made during the ""Bobby Light"" episode is included in all of its cheesy glory. It has to be seen to be truly believed.

Arguably the best extra in the entire set is the ""Special Uncle Jerry Footage"" featuring more hilarious scenes of Uncle Jerry in action: drinking beer, yelling ""Dirty Girl"" randomly and just being his usual awesome, original self.

""MTV Cribs Appearance"" features Rob and Big giving us the tour of their pad and, of course, their vehicles. They even have their own ATM machine.

Also included are 12 deleted scenes from the various episodes from Season 2.

""The Best of Season 2"" is a highlight reel of the best moments from this season.

Finally, there is ""Special Mini Footage"" of the miniature horse in action doing its thing.",1200441600,18,3770,4.641141141141141
2751642,5,B000MX7V7A,"Ok, well let me start off by saying that this is a great show.  I could watch every episode dozens of times.  The commentary is a big plus for me, as I love watching the commentaries on shows like this.  Also, the bonus features are great.  I would do a pro/con review on this, but there are no cons, so it would be useless.  Anyway, here are some of the pluses you might enjoy yourself.

-Commentaries (One of my personal favorites)
-Season 1 Bonus Features are aplenty, totaling just under two hours!
-Season 2 Bonus Features are very enjoyable, with a runtime of just over an hour.
-All 16 episodes of Seasons 1 and 2.

Overall this is a great buy for people who have been fans from day 1, and for people who just got into the show.  I look forward to seeing new episodes on MTV, and can't wait until the release of Season 3 on DVD, or Season 3/Season 4, if they are released in the same set as Seasons 1 and 2 were.",1200268800,2,919,4.1525423728813555
2751643,5,B000MX7V7A,"This DVD set is great. It contains all 15 episodes, and a lot of bonus features. The best part is the added commentaries of Big Black, Rob, Jeff Tremaine, and a producer named Ruben something. They shed a lot light on what was scripted and what wasn't. A lot of the show has genuine emotion and real life comedy, although some is scripted and played for laughs. The commentaries are also funny, so it makes watching the episode all the more hilarious. I never buy TV shows on DVD and never listen to commentaries, but this show changed that. If you are a fan of the show, I highly recommend picking up this DVD set.",1200268800,2,615,4.356521739130435
2751644,5,B000MX7V7A,Rob and Big is a funny show with all of the characters and its not scripted. I hate shows that are scripted and that you know whats coming. Rob and Big don't let you know whats coming and it isn't very sexual content prone like many of MTV's shows are...Definately Buying!!!,1199491200,2,274,4.392156862745098
2751645,5,B000MX7V7A,"I always thought MTV was worthless until I caught an episode of Rob & Big at a friend's house.  Now, I am hooked!

2751648,5,B000MX7V7A,My husband and I LOVE this show...we are always looking for re-runs on MTV. It's so nice to see a show like this on a channel who's programming is usually so offensive to anyone with morals. Finally a show on MTV without lots of bad language and sexual content!! This show kept us sane during the 2am feedings after our daughter was born. The second season is looking to be just as great as the first...we can't wait to get the first season on DVD to watch over and over.,1180310400,,471,4.2444444444444445
