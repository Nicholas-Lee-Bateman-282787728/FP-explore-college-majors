I have only spend a few hour on it so it could get better.",1368403200,,145,3.6774193548387095
3650327,1,B001IZHXOC,"The voices on this are all wrong, I mean they are supposed to be in school.  The voices sound like older people.  The acting is terrible.  This was recommended to me by a friend several years ago and I really really regret getting it.  It is just blah and pointless.  The acting is so bad, I mean it is worse than any other hentai I have ever seen.  Don't waste your money.",1362182400,,373,4.111111111111111

8311587,5,B001IZHXOC,"I watched the Anime/Hentai movies and enjoyed them a great deal.  The story and characters have a lot of depth, compelling, erotic, and sexy.  Each character clearly has their own psyche with their own wants that play out against each other.  Playing the video game's interactive dynamic story allows the participant to understand this more.

The English subtitles can sometimes lack in quality of translation;  However they absolutely allow English natives to experience the erotica abundantly.  The more profit the company makes the greater the compulsion to make more.

I believe this game is abundantly and overwhelmingly enjoyed by potential customers who also favor reading paranormal romance novels, erotica, or erotic stories.  I mention preternatural because it is an essential element to Bible Black's story.",1414886400,,818,5.488

8311589,5,B001IZHXOC,"I decided to do a quick review for those interested in the Bible Black Game. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

Bible Black was actually the very first Anime (not counting Pokemon) that I ever saw. I've seen all the Bible Black Anime episodes, so I thought I'd finally play the game. It's a simple choose your own destiny-type visual novel. All the audio is in Japanese, but there are English subtitles to get you through the game. Some of the subtitles seem a bit messed up, but I guess the original translator was a bit lazy.

You can play this game in windowed mode or full screen. It doesn't take much to run it since it's such an old game, and a visual novel at that. You have the options to fast forward, fast forward only what you've already read, screen capture, and more. The game itself is great. If you liked the anime, you'll like the game. The anime was basically a combination of all the endings in the game mixed together. There are a total of 12 endings, but only one is considered the true ending. All others are either bad, evil, or neutral.",1376438400,10,1070,4.345
