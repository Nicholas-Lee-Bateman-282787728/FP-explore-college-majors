6892997,5,B00R041CT2,"Anne Hathaway is Amazing in this very poignant film! I have a Very Personal connection to the story as I was in a similar situation regarding being in a Coma following a Near-Fatal brush with death after a bicycle accident a few years ago. This film made me appreciate the support I was given and the LOVE those who know me have and Song One Captured this feeling and the LOVE Perfectly!
PLUS...
The music was made by Jenny Lewis and Johnny!!
Can't go wrong with that whatsoever!!
See It and have a Wonderful journey!

6892998,5,B00R041CT2,"You may not be pulled in by the trailer, but make no mistake, the story, the music and the actors will create a strong connection to an event you hope you never have to go through. Bring a box of tissue, you may need it.",1423785600,2,220,3.911111111111111
6892999,2,B00R041CT2,"My bad that I didn't like this romance. Wanna-be song writer Henry (Ben Rosenfield) gets hit by a cab and in Brooklyn and goes into a coma. His sister Franny (Anne Hathaway) travels back from across the world to be with him. Apparently they had some minor falling out. She retraces his foot steps and meets James Forester (Johnny Flynn) an old indie singer/writer whose best days were past. Henry idolized this guy and now his sister is dating him, going around the cities' diverse music scene. Henry becomes secondary as our wondering boring couple make eyes at each other.

There is one thing that women want. If someone writes a song for her, they love it no matter how bad it may be. The same is true for poetry. Women will carry a poem you wrote for them through an infinite amount of lovers and husbands. It is simple romance that appears to be dying in the electronic age and that may be the appeal of the film. As for me, I was bored to tears.

6893002,5,B00R041CT2,"This beautiful, quiet and moving film hits just the right note.  Hathaway shines as a sister concerned for her brother's health and real-life musician, Johnny Flynn's understated, James, is riveting.  I could not take my eyes off either of them and the story they told with their faces and their eyes.

6893087,3,B00R041CT2,"I'm not a fan of Ann Hathaway. That said, this was a pleasant movie to watch, although none of the music 'stayed' or seemed memorable. For a movie that features a main character who is a performer, this seems like a wasted opportunity.

'The Devil Wears Prada'  had a good story line and then there was Meryl Streep with HER acting chops. You need something like that to pull a film together when it verges on being fluff. I love the way Hathaway wears clothes - she's cute and coy and always looks like a model prepping for a shoot.

6893093,5,B00R041CT2,"even though the movie was left open ended, i'm okay with that. we find franny and james at a time where they need what the other has.

james shows franny the world her brother loves. she starts to understand henry and his love of music on a deeper level. james helped her navigate the uncertainty of her brother's fate and not just wallow in fear or guilt. she got to do a different kind of anthropology, by reading her brother's journal and experiencing his world first hand.

franny shows james that just because his ex-girlfriend and muse left him, doesn't mean he'll never write again. she doesn't push or pressure him. franny listens and makes playful suggestions for song topics. james needed to forget about 'what's next'. he needed to be seen not as james forester the musician, but as a person.

in the end, they gave each other a memory to keep forever in the form of a song (his the first he's written since his ex left, and her's the silly one they made together). after meeting during a chaotic time for both of them, it felt right not to force a finality between them. their relationship was always a little awkward and understated. a grand gesture or big goodbye would have been out of character.

maybe they will see each other again, but franny has to be there for her brother and james is ready to write/perform more music. neither of them would ask or expect the other to drop everything to follow/stay with the other. but based on how big of a fan henry is, it's hard for me to imagine james and franny's paths won't cross again. maybe then they will have better timing or maybe not, either way, what they had was special and no one can take that.

also as someone who had a loved one in a coma for many months before regaining consciousness, it was touching on a personal level to see franny put so much thought & effort into surrounding her brother with a large variety of familiar sounds and smells.",1497139200,4,1922,4.464387464387465

6893147,2,B00R041CT2,"**Review contains spoilers**
I'd rate it higher if it hadn't ended so abruptly and without some type of closure. I was left frustrated, disappointed, and wondering what happened to their budding relationship. After sharing such a connection, did they just walk away and leave each others' lives so easily? Without even a conversation or a goodbye? They had seemed good together & for each other; at least, it seemed they had the potential for a good relationship. But because she left him waiting at the hospital (due to her brother waking from a coma), he left without a word...and that was it? I know he had somewhere he had to be, but it's unbelievable that neither of them bothered to call or text, or otherwise get up with each other before he left to go back home. From this, we're led to believe they each moved on with their lives separately, which is unacceptable without some kind of real communication or at least a goodbye. I just can't deal with miscommunications like thisnot in real life, nor in books I read, or movies I watch.

On the up side, the music throughout the film was wonderful: poignant and beautiful, adding to the emotions and feel of the story. I'll definitely check out the soundtrack. Johnny Flynn was lovely and fascinating to watch, and hearing him sing is always a pleasure. I do wish he'd have acted the role more deeply; he seemed to not be able to do much more than stammer about self-consciously (but his accent was lovely even so). I'm not a fan of Anne Hathaway, but she was tolerable enough throughout. The story itself was weak, but believable enough. Except for the way it left off. I just can't let that go; despite all the positives, the way it ended tarnished the entire film, in my opinion.",1492041600,2,1739,4.609677419354838

6893183,5,B00R041CT2,"This movie would be an excellent choice if you are hosting a DVD & wine party with friends. Mostly, because the ending will allow you to debate the age old question of will their relationship continue or not.

A good choice if you are looking for a feel good movie.  Anne Hathaway does a great job as Franny and where has Johnny Flynn been?  What a great choice to play the role of James Forester. This movie particularly resonated with me because I once received the same call Franny did "" Your brother has been in an accident. You've got to come home"".  So I can understand why Franny seeks to find out more about her brother and hopes that familiar items may bring him out of the coma. Franny & James develop an unexpected but perfectly understandable relationship. They come from two different worlds and would have likely never met except for the accident.  Love Mary Steenburgen as Franny & Henry's mother. Loved the original music",1474934400,4,937,4.586826347305389

My wife was having a conversation with me about our travel plans and I said to her I have a brain freeze so lets talk about this later. I left the living room and came to my bedroom and switched this film on. I thought three times and 25 minutes into the film, I implored her to join me in viewing this film. I rewound it to the 12th minute and the film began again, I noticed it before, switched my phone off, started watching the film. It just ended and what can I say? I absolutely loved it. It was one of those films where I felt although  I was watching this film with my wife, I felt so connected to the film. It felt like one long song, one long song with a delicate plot but subtleties and extremities roped in with powerful editing. I say powerful editing because there were 20 second take-outs and there were 2 minute long songs sung to the most gravest entity which would end leaving you back into your world, wondering where youve heard better music before.

6893647,4,B00R041CT2,"If you need a strong solidified ending to fully enjoy the movie you won't get one here. Though, it is a common theme in indie films to just leave the viewer in suspense at the end at let them decide how the characters progressed through life. I think that is why this movie doesn't rate so well, because an American audience needs closure in the right form for them to accept a movie, they don't like being left with mystery.
The whole move felt real, especially during the first few times they met. The sheer awkwardness of first encounters truly shined through. I honestly haven't truly enjoyed a Hathaway film for years, but this is what she should be doing. small movies that can really show her range as an actress; we need more female's in the industry like her. Johnny Flynn, is incredible the way he subtlety depicts the awkward musician type just trying to figure it all out... although I feel that might not be his acting ability and more a depiction of his true nature, but I don't know his life. It took me half the movie to figure out where I had previously seen him. It was Scrotal Recall, which is clever and funny so long as you can handle  ""clap"" jokes. If you already like indie films and are looking for a emotionally driven, but not ""over-the-top-grab-the-tissues"" movie you will enjoy it.",1447027200,,1309,4.523206751054852

6893663,3,B00R041CT2,"I rented Song One thinking it had possibilities. Since I've worked in the medical field, I find it hard to watch movies with hospital rooms, and conversations about illnesses or care. My impression is that mostly movie makers get facts messed up--they don't research carefully enough, or use the correct consultants. It's hard for me to get past things. I know it is a small detail, but a neurologist would likely say, ""As a result of his head injury, he has a hematoma."" Or, ""We are concerned about hematoma."" In the story, a diagnostician is looking at a brain scan and says, ""his brain has a hematoma to it. "" ARGH. Right then, I start losing commitment. The story moves slowly, and I find my attention wandering. I'll give the movie a couple more minutes. If the first scenes did not grab me, then for sure I'm going to have trouble as I go, I'm thinking. I'd add, I am not the correct demographic for this story--too old! Kids who are a lot younger, likely will find the story relevant.",1446854400,,991,4.511111111111111

6894102,2,B00R041CT2,"There's a reason you've probably never heard of this movie.  While the movie has a decent acting cast, the acting comes across as painfully awkward and dialogue is slow.  I get that it's supposed to be real and raw, but nobody talks that slow and monotone.  This movie was a bore almost the entire way through.

The music was ok.  Some songs better than others.  It really depends on your musical preference.  When you have finished the movie you probably won't feel any desire to find any of the singers you heard in this movie.

The plot is what really kills this movie.  The very simple plot they have going just never really develops.  Anne Hathaway does the best job carrying on the plot, but there is so little development beyond her wishing she had spent more time with her brother.  Overall the movie moves really slowly and doesn't tie up any of the plot ends.

Overall this movie is quite a disappointment compared to Perks of being a Wallflower, or other movies you might consider in a similar genre.",1442448000,,1011,4.555555555555555

6894277,5,B00R041CT2,"Subtle and artsy with a need between two characters who meet through sound and song. Loved the romance and music! If you're looking for fast paced or a traditional romance, this might be a great surprise or a snooze fest. I was looking for that moment between two characters where they find each other at the exact right moment in their lives. I will say the lack of closed captioning was disappointing enough I almost knocked off a star but then I looked up how much it cost for indie films to include CC. The cost to profit ratio is not a good one, but indie film people, this has to be included in your budget somewhere.",1441497600,,623,4.333333333333333

It's definitely a movie focused more on the brother. Everything Phryne does is pretty much for her brother, and the idol, James, is pretty much just along for the ride as he observes the grief she and her mother go through as they wait for him to wakeup. This movie isn't really a chick flick, as the relationship doesn't have a happy ending where they stay together forever and ever, but its not a sad ending either. It's less than an hour and a half in runtime, so its still worth a watch.",1440806400,,692,4.3307692307692305

6894550,4,B00R041CT2,"For some reason, I liked this movie much more the second time I watched it.  It's a beautiful story and I thought the actors were wonderful in their roles. Anne Hathaway's grief was written all over her face.  Johnny Flynn played the quiet, shy musician suffering with his own problem beautifully.  And what's not to love about Mary Steenburgen!  To me, a big part of this movie was how music affects you and your life and the theme is reinforced throughout the film. The reason I watched a second time was the music - I wanted to hear it again.  And, since then I have discovered just what an awesomely talented singer, songwriter and musician Johnny Flynn is - just ""you tube"" him and you'll see!  I guess I'm so happy with this movie because it introduced me to him and his music. And that's not a bad reason at all!",1440460800,5,819,4.3907284768211925

6894553,3,B00R041CT2,"This was a very subtle film, reminiscent of Once (Markta Irglov and Glen Hansard), which is a favorite film of mine. The dialog was not over-crafted and I liked that. The music was clever in that sophomoric Indy style, easy to listen to. The storyline is built around a tragic story that is resolved but the denouement is rushed and I thought it took from the film but I didn't really care.

Regardless, though, if you like Indy music, Johnny Flynn and/or Anne Hathaway you will find this to be perfectly acceptable entertainment.",1440374400,,530,4.698924731182796

That is unrealistic.  These two characters converse and build a friendship/relationship first.  They are also two people who have busy careers/educational pursuits when an unexpected event brings them together.  A romance can actually happen for a period in time without it being ""forever"" as I see much whining that they were not given the forever and ever together Hollywood fantasy ending (even though the movie leaves that completely open).  My only complaint about the film is the unrealistic portrayal of the medical care/treatment of the injured character.  Either they did not get a medical consult on how to portray medicine accurately or they picked a doctor who should not be practicing and/or advising how to portray medicine on film.",1437436800,2,906,5.122448979591836

6895467,1,B00R041CT2,"This was a very predictable movie, with little drama. As soon as the ""favorite musician"" of the person in a coma came into the hospital room, with the patient's sister nervously awaiting the attempt to bring him out of his coma by playing his favorite music, you knew the ending. The music would do the trick, but we had to suffer through the endless meetings between the musician and the sister, with furtive glances, interspersed with a nice smile from her, mostly rather shy looks from him, culminated with the obligatory sex scene, I assume to get a rating.

In between the start and the ending, we endured endless shots of her walking alone thru the darkest streets at night, oblivious to any danger, while searching for where her brother used to live, and where ""favorite musician"" now lived and performed.

Sorry if I can't remember the names.

In comparison to the Keira Knightly travesty that was ""Begin Again"", fake acting at playing guitar and trying to be a musician; ""Song One"" achieved a connection with understated brilliance.

There were things about the movie that I enjoyed like the slow developing relationship, the actors, some of the music... but the slow storyline, the ending, some of the music and then how abruptly they would cut from one scene and have you smack in the middle of another. ....It  was JUST ok for me.",1436745600,,561,4.146788990825688

The guy who plays the brother was great when he was singing and actually doing anything. Hathaway cannot carry a tune and the stuff between her and the mom character bored me into forwarding. After a while I just forwarded to hear Flynn perform and to see if the brother woke up. Not enough happening here to bring it all together and hold my attention.  Also the sound quality in the spoken scenes was very uneven to the point where I was constantly having to turn up the sound only to have to turn it down in the next scene. Me personally- If I was trying my hardest to apologize to someone in a coma and bring them around I would be a whole lot louder than a choked whisper.

I honestly thought he had died when one of the very next scenes is the sister arriving at home and the Mom is there.  What the hell are they doing at home when their comatose family member was now awake at the hospital?  Not to mention how the sister leaves to go find the musician just minutes after the brother awakens.  I didn't care much at all for any of the rest of the movie,  as it veered off into a rather selfish focus on the romance and made ONE brief mention of the awakened brother (""He's going to be OK"".  Oh, thanks for at least giving us an update.  Sheesh. )  Seems there was practically no consciousness for what the audience might care about in this movie.

6895844,5,B00R041CT2,"Song One

Democracy is not a particularly good way to grade art, books, and movies.  It always surprises me how mediocre many five-star movies are and how great some 3-star movies are.  Song One is a movie that has a story that tugs hard on your heart strings, had superb acting that showed the depth of anguish and love of a young woman for her head-injured brother, and a remarkably authentic depiction of the indie music scene in Brooklyn.  It is almost everything a good movie should be, a love story that felt real and not maudlin, a view of a life and culture of a vibrant Indie music scene in Brooklyn, and three actors who gave probably the best performances of their lives.

Anne Hathaway plays Franny, a young 20-something anthropologist in training, who learns that her musician brother had suffered head injury and rushes back to New York to find him comatose and unresponsive in hospital.  She had a fight with him 6 months previously over his dropping out of college to play music and did not listen to his music and CDs that he sent to her. In my opinion, it was Anne Hathaways best performance in a move to date, done with great sensitivity, passion, and authenticity.

Johnny Flynn, who played musician James Forester, is not only a very good guitar player and singer but fit so perfectly into the role of a singer/writer that it is hard to imagine him as something else.  His British accent came through and it is not surprising to find that he is actually a South African born English musician and actor who is the frontman of the folk-rock band Johnny Flynn & The Sussex Wit and has a role in the TV series Scrotal Wit.  He and Anne Hathaway pulled off several difficult scenes that were combination conversations and songs. She has a sweet voice.

Ben Rosen played brother Henry before and after becoming comatose is a very believable starting musician playing in the subway.  The whole issue of head injury, the fact that comatose people often can hear, and the timing of the awakening is very consistent with head injuries.  The only thing that did not work well is the presence of the oral tracheal tube for respiration.  More important, a person with a tracheal tube would be unable to talk, would have show more respiratory movement, and probably would have been fighting the ventilator.

The music scenes in Brooklyn appeared to be real.  The music varied in quality but this is the way Indie music is.  When James Forester told Franny that he was playing several shows in New York, a wedding, and a final show in Philadelphia, Franny did not understand and asked who was getting married and Forester said that he did not know because he was just the entertainment and he earned $10,000 to play three songs.  There was a dancing scene was well done and captured both the feeling and sound well.

In the end, this was not a love story between Franny and James although they may eventually love each other. This is really the story of the non-romantic love of a sister for a brother.  Franny sought to capture those sounds and smells that would be meaningful to her comatose brother.  She read through his notes, found out that James Forester was Henrys favorite singer, and used internet to find and play music from James Forester to her brother.  Of course, James played at Henrys bedside.  The movie could have descended into something less than credible if it had tried to portray the relationship between Franny and James as love.

The movie was well-written with realistic dialog that tied the details of the story together. The music was enjoyable, the acting was superb, and the action well-paced so that I did not get bored at any time during the 1 hours 26 minute movie.  It deserves more than 3 stars, which is what many critics gave.  In my opinion, this was one of the best movies of 2014 and I am glad that I watched it. I decided to buy a copy so that I can watch it again on my iPad when in a place without Internet.  Given the limited storage of an iPad, I keep no more than 20 movies on it.

She then seeks musicians and artist that Henry loved and in the process meets Jeremy Forester,his music idol. She was able to convince him to perform at her brother's bedside and later forms a romantic relationship with him. In the end,Henry wakes up from coma.

The story was slow that it became boring. Added to that,the screenplay was absolutely formulaic and predictable that there was nothing really surprising in the events that are about to happen.

6895901,3,B00R041CT2,"Many actors and actresses trade off big movies for small in their careers. The bigger movies make them money they can live on while the smaller ones give them the chance to be more creative and stretch their abilities. In the end fans can enjoy both types of films and the artists can work on their craft. Anne Hathaway seems to be taking this on for her career. Having made LES MISERABLE and increasing her fame, she now can be seen in the smaller film SONG ONE.

The movie opens with a young street musician name Henry playing in the subway. While walking home he fails to notice where hes walking and is hit by a car. Were then whisked away to Africa where Franny (Hathaway) is working on her PHD as an anthropologist. She receives a phone call from her mother (Mary Steenburgen) and is soon on her way home to sit alongside her, waiting for Henry to come out of the coma he is now in, if at all.

Having left on bad terms with Henry and not speaking to him for months, Frannie looks through his things in his room trying to piece together who her brother was and what he had become. She always felt that his career choice was simple and shallow and beneath him. Now as she reads through the book of notes he took with him everywhere, she follows his footsteps through the city of New York capturing the sounds that he listened to and visiting the music spots where he was developing his craft in the indie music scene.

Among the many things she finds her brother fond of she discovers his adulation of a performer named James Forester (Johnny Flynn). His room is not only covered with posters for the performer but in the middle of the book of notes is a ticket to his next performance that night. Frannie takes the ticket and heads out to hear this man and to find out what held her brothers interest in him.

As she listens to his words and music, Frannie discovers that James offers a solid base in folk music that she never understood before. She meets with him after the show and tells him about her brothers condition. Where most movies would take this moment to have the two main characters fall madly in love this movie instead lets that develop slowly at a more natural pace. James comes to visit Frannie and Henry in the hospital though Henry remains in his coma. James and Frannie slowly strike up a friendship and he goes with her on the journey through the pages of Henrys book, knowing some of the locations well.

As days pass the pair grow fond of one another and, as I said, slowly begin to find themselves attracted towards one another. James finds himself drawn to a woman in need and her family, Frannie finds a link to her brother that continues to provide her hope he will recover. While she may not realize it, Frannie is also discovering another world just outside of her doorstep using the same technics she would employ as an anthropologist looking into other cultures. It keeps her busy while she helps with her mother, waits on her brother and slowly finds herself drawn to a man she never knew before in James.

The movie works well in the structure it uses relying less on the spoken word and more on those sung. With each location Frannie visits she is exposed to various musicians singing songs and carrying on a long tradition of telling stories through them. The best part is that here the songs aren't all written to move the story forward but as their own songs and stories. A bad movie would have made each song relate to what was happening next to Frannie or Henry, but here they are just songs that each different performer has created. The same hold true with the songs that James performs.

The pacing of the film is slow and steady, never rushing anything and letting the plot develop at a more natural flow than most movies would allow. And by the end everything isn't tied up in a nice, neat bow either, giving it a more realistic approach that is both realistic and satisfying at the same time. The performances are all low key and each actor makes their character as believable as possible. When put together this results in a movie that holds your interest, entertains and enlightens all at the same time.

While SONG ONE is a smaller movie than many being released these days it does what a good movie should do. It allows you to feel emotions in different ways. It tells a story that holds your interest. And it captures your attention for 86 minutes. What more could you ask for in a movie?",1428537600,5,4445,4.438725490196078

Not that the film is devoid of charm. Its music is well worth listening, but the rest of the film, especially its drama part, needs some originality.

Anne Hathaway plays Franny, a young anthropologist flying back from Morocco to New York City when her long-estranged brother Henry (Ben Rosenfield) gets severely injured and falls into a coma. In Henrys notebook Franny finds a concert ticket of his favorite musician James Forester (Johnny Flynn).

Will Franny and James meet and be romantically attracted to each other? Why have not the sister and brother seen one another for a long time? What will Frannys mother (Mary Steenburgen) talk about Frannys childhood? Every relationship between characters is somehow linked to music. It is not a bad idea and the music you hear is very nice.

6896004,4,B00R041CT2,"Franny (Anne Hathaway) is called to come home quickly while working in Morocco on her Ph. D. Her brother, Henry (Ben Rosenfield) is hit by a car right away as the film opens.  He is a street musician that idolizes the Brooklyn, New York indie circuit and one singer, in particular. Their mother, Karen (Mary Steenburgen), is distraught and knows the two of them have not spoken to each other in half a year. An argument separated the once-close siblings and now there are no words for Franny to say - or are there?

Writer and director, Kate Barker-Froyland puts together a way of communication between a family with the son in a coma. They together fill the room with sounds. Franny while filled with remorse over having her last words to her brother be that of discontent arranges ways of almost constant talking through different venues. I thought she was very clever and astute finding ways to get through to her brother in various ways besides just her own voice. While first going to his loft, she finds a book of different writings he has done; songs, thoughts, favorites, etc. She immediately begins to collect the things he loves and brings them to him. One, in particular, that handed me a smile was when she simply ripped open a bag of his favorite candy (M & Ms) and poured them into her hand while putting it up to his ear and nose. This because of a birthday that he would remember as a child. There are many things along these lines that she does for him to bring the sounds and smells of the things he loves. But most of all, she tracks down his favorite musician, James Forester (Johnny Flynn). He adores his talent and his music.

As James enters the story, Franny is eager for him to sing so she might record and play him back to Henry. If he is his favorite, then Franny is going to go up and beyond the call. These two begin a friendship which quickly sparks their romantic chemistry. The ways of communicating in this romance between Hathaway and Flynn, then with Hathaway engaging with her brother, were so heartfelt. Anne Hathaway has the ability in this film, and with many of her other projects, to speak volumes with her eyes in lieu of the most detailed of wording. Here is no exception, Hathaway beams her emotions and they are easily read and felt. I felt she portrayed her part as Franny, the loving sister, so well with slight conversation and it certainly did pull at me also while with James. The cast was convincing in this film. Mary Steenburgen being a little less constrained as some of her other roles. I definitely could feel a mother's deep grief and also a different way of carrying herself with the part of the mother who had known the music scene in her day too. Anne Hathaway was perfect for a role that didn't need fluid verbal conversation constantly, she divulges so much with her eyes. James Flynn carried himself as a musician still well known but possibly struggling for more.

The song choices (Jenny Lewis, Jonathan Rice, Nate Walcott) were interesting and well thought out for such a family dilemma and for a performance artist in his venues and all of the other musicians also. I listened to all of them through the end credits. It is also shot throughout the late night clubs of New York which gives a balance to the hospital's sadness and then to the hopeful feel of the nightlife. This is more of a gently nuanced film full of subtleties and soft-spoken feelings. If this is not the kind of portrayal that you may be seeking, you may be split on how you enjoy the film. It can be seen where this film could polarize an audience depending on what you are expecting.  Much of the film is nonverbal along with its intention except for the songs that seem, at times, to happily fill in this film's storyline.",1424304000,25,3762,4.518355359765051

8693590,3,B00R041CT2,"I loved Begin Again and thought this would be something similar.  The story is sweet - Franny's brother, a musician, has been hit by a car and is in a coma and she comes home to be by his side. In the process, she goes through his diary and starts bringing in things he loved to the hospital. She attends a concert performed by his guitar idol and the guy winds up being very decent, stops by the hospital room to see her brother  and the two wind up friends. A bit more, perhaps.  It's a really lovely story and  the chemistry between Hathaway and Flynn (Ithinkth at's the male star) is engaging.  No, there is not a HEA but the door is open and they clearly have a terrific connection. and the effort/care Hathaway puts towards getting her brother to regain his life is really sweet.

The one thing that sucks--i'm sorry, it's likely just taste--is the music. It's NOT like Begin Again (where the music was really fun) I like folk music fine,  Lynne's voice is great, his guitar playing is quite nice but the songs are just terrible. I would definitely listen to Flynn perform more but these songs do NOT do his talent justice at all. The only viable, interesting music is the goofy piece they  concoct about the top of the Empire State Building.

So, that said, the movie is still  okay, but it would have been really, really good with some decent songs.",1523836800,,1357,4.413654618473895
