4989323,5,B006HAJ2ZQ,This is probably one of the best shows MTV ever had. I wish they wouldn't have cancelled it! Its entertaining and fun to watch.,1354320000,,127,4.333333333333333
4989324,5,B006HAJ2ZQ,"I loved Good Vibes when it previewed on MTV. I was disappointed to find out it wasn't renewed. I was glad to find this DVD. It has some fun extras, but the gold is in the show itself. Great characters & just a fun show to watch. It will be missed...",1350345600,,249,3.9019607843137254
4989325,4,B006HAJ2ZQ,"This show was amazing and had alot of potential, and I really wanted to see at least a season 2, but of course it had to be on MTV so no one watched it. If it was on Fox this show would have easily been on for at least another season. Anyways I am not entirely happy with the DVD for a couple reasons: first, the music in alot of  was changed or in some cases replaced with silence (weird) and takes away from the hilarity of the scenes they were in when it was on MTV.
The second thing is that usually when a show comes out on DVD it is unedited. although the back of the DVD case states it is not rated, it still has bleeps over the few cuss words in some scenes (eg tech rehab episode where Miss Teets falls out of her power chair and there's a donut on the ground she can't reach, and her response is ""oh F### my life"" -I really wanted that part to be unedited.

Other then that no other real complaints, it was a great show and I wish there was a way to petition MTV to approve another season or move it to another network.

Great show, and the only gripes I have are with the DVD content, none whatsoever about the shipper (shipped extremely fast, thank you!)",1331856000,,1165,4.034632034632034
4989326,5,B006HAJ2ZQ,"This is a great DVD with all 12 episodes of the series. It ran from October 27, 2011 to December 29, 2011. I hate to tell everyone this but the series has officially been cancelled due to low ratings.",1330128000,3,200,4.153846153846154
4989327,5,B006HAJ2ZQ,"For sure the BEST show on MTV!!!!!!! When is the next season going to start!?!?!!!!!
LOVE  all the characters, great great show!!!!!!!",1329955200,,134,5.090909090909091
4989328,5,B006HAJ2ZQ,this is without doubt the most halarious show ever.  no show even comes close to this i hope this show goes on for several seasons.,1329091200,,131,4.24
4989329,5,B006HAJ2ZQ,does any body know when the 2nd season good vibes will be in feburary or march ? cause on mtv.com said that it will be in the next 3 days,1328659200,,137,3.6
4989330,5,B006HAJ2ZQ,"I was greatly surprised by this show when it came out. I was expecting just another goofy, raunchy comedy with teenagers and surfing. And while it does have those things it's also a very touching series with a good deal of heart. Montgomery ""Mondo"" Brando (voiced by Josh Gad) moves with his single mom, Barbara ""Babs"" Brando (voiced by Debi Mazar) from New Jersey to the beach community of Playa del Toro in Southern California. Mondo is overweight and self concious and very shy at first because of his fears of fitting in. Then he meets local surfer teen, Woodford ""Woodie"" Stone (voiced by Adam Brody) and the two become immediate best friends. With Woodie's help, Mondo slowly comes out of his shell and gets a taste for surfing as well. He also befriends hyperactive, paranoid, horny, and semi psychotic Winthrop Aguilera Wadska (voiced by Tony Hale) and his sister Jeena (voiced by Olivia Thirlby) whom Mondo developes romantic feelings for. Other characters include Jeena's on again off again boyfriend Dirk Kirk ""Turk"" Turkpatrick (voiced by Jake Busey), who at times is your typical meat head jock; Milan (voiced by Kari Whalgren) who's Woodie's self centered popular sister; sex-ed teacher Verneeta Teets (voiced by Danny McBride) who's over 400 pounds, gets around on a motorized scooter, is bi sexual, and despite her size is proud of her body and has amazing luck with men; and finally Lonnie (voiced by Alan Tudyk), a hippie and Gulf War vet who lives in a van and often gives Mondo and Woodie advice.

Despite all the craziness of most of the characters, this show does have a great deal of heart. Mondo is a sweet guy who just wants to fit in and be accepted for who he is. Woodie is a great best friend who despite coming from money wants to live a humble life. Despite a wild past, Babs is a good mother and is doing her best to make sure Mondo has a good future. Jeena is an attractive but intellegent young woman and even Turk and Milan has moments of empathy. Ms. Teets and Wadska are just hilarious. I really hope this show gets picked up for a second season as it's one of the few good shows on MTV in a very long time. Check it out if you can. ^_^",1326931200,10,2172,4.540816326530612

4989333,5,B006HAJ2ZQ,Make more!,1471737600,,10,4.5
4989334,5,B006HAJ2ZQ,"This is definitely one of the greatest and most comedic animated series I have seen. It's pretty raunchy humor, so don't get offended. The only thing I wish they could've done is kept the original soundtrack in the episodes and possibly made it uncensored. It kind of takes away the humor when I hear bleeps everywhere. Other than that, it's a fantastic show and I would most DEFINITELY recommend it for anyone.",1467676800,,411,4.722222222222222

4989343,1,B006HAJ2ZQ,"I've never had problems with Amazon and DVD-R formats before this, so I thought I'd try ordering the set again. On both copies of Disk 1 (2 separate orders) at the 3:34 mark into the pilot episode, the disk skips, and cannot play any further. Disk 2 works fine, but after the 3:34 mark, the first disk is done, as it can't even play any of the 7 remaining episodes on the disk.",1401235200,2,377,4.178082191780822

Great show and great purchase on my part.",1391385600,,340,4.044776119402985

BUY ANOTHER ONE FOR A FRIEND!!!

Maybe then MTV will see the $$$$$$$ and start on Season 2!!!",1389744000,,110,4.190476190476191
4989348,4,B006HAJ2ZQ,"One of the best MTV cartoons ever. Too bad it was pulled when Beavis and Butthead stopped airing. I used to watch both, and thought Good Vibes was far more entertaining than Beavis and Butthead. Oh well, maybe it will be back one day.

The DVD's were good quality, but the clear vinyl covering on the case was separated at the top right corner as soon as I opened it. Could have been a better quality case, but no big deal. Everything else was just fine, and I was glad to just get all episodes on disc.",1369094400,,503,4.185567010309279
4989349,4,B006HAJ2ZQ,"This has been one of my favorite shows ever since I saw its season finale. It's a real shame that the show only lasted one season, but I do hope more people get into seeing the show and remembering it. I would rate the show five stars, but this is based on the DVD. The cover design and the labels are pretty nice, along with the special features and putting the episodes in the production order like they were supposed to be, but my problem is that the DVD box was slightly damaged at the top right corner in the front, puncturing the cover of the DVD. Along with that, the shrink wrap on the side got stuck and left tiny pieces which are an annoyance, so both those problems deserve a half-star for it.

If you haven't seen the show, watch all twelve episodes. Trust me. This is a great show that too many have missed out on.",1366934400,,827,4.20125786163522
4989350,5,B006HAJ2ZQ,"the story,and characters are great,  should have left it on tv MTV was stupid for canceling it. Would be on for 10 years",1356048000,,120,4.217391304347826
8498279,4,B006HAJ2ZQ,"This show is hilarious. MTVs last animated series. My only problem with this is that the songs in the show have been edited from when they originally aired, so all of the songs are now generic soundalikes. That was very disorienting, as I had basically memorized the show.",1525046400,,272,4.6875
