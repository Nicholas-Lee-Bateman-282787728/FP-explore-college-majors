Hall of Fame  April 5, 2014

Overall: Does anyone remember those little surveys that would come with WWE DVDs back in 2002/2003 that would ask questions like what superstar you wanted to see a DVD released on? Scott Hall would be one of the ones on my list and FINALLY more than a decade later, my wish is finally coming true! Scott Hall's gimmick as Razor Ramon was seriously one of the best gimmicks to come out of the New Generation Era. A rich, street smart, Scarface-esque, Cuban thug who oozed machismo. It was a refreshing gimmick during a time where you had clowns, garbage men, race car drivers, an evil dentist, a pirate, and countless other dreadful gimmicks running amok in the WWF. In addition to an awesome gimmick, Scott Hall is also terribly underrated as a competitor. Hall has put on some spectacular matches throughout his wrestling career, whether he was in AWA, WWE, or WCW and you'll have a chance to first-hand see some of his greatest bouts on this 3 disc set. In this set, you'll see some Hall's greatest matches such as his infamous Wrestlemania 10 Ladder Match against Shawn Michaels, his WWE Championship match against Bret Hart at the 1993 Royal Rumble, his tag team match with Kevin Nash against Harlem Heat from the 1997 Halloween Havoc PPV (really great match), and numerous others. The only match that really has no business being on here is his final Wrestlemania match where he had perhaps the most abysmal match of his career against Stone Cold Steve Austin. Despite that one negative, this is a set you need to get. Whether you're a WWE fan, WCW fan, AWA fan, or Scott Hall fan--or all 4, this is a DVD set you need to have in your collection. Pull out your old Razor Ramon shirt, slick your hair back, stick a toothpick in your mouth, put a gold chain around your neck (something happen to this, something gonna happen to you), kick back, relax, and enjoy this 3 disc set on ""Da bad guy"" Razor Ramon, chico!",1458604800,16,5174,4.840413318025258
7664400,5,B01BN52ZWG,"Scott Hall is truly one of the biggest professional wrestling icons without a shadow of a doubt
and his Razor Ramon gimmick is easily one of the very best gimmicks that there's ever been in professional wrestling history.
I'm so very glad that the WWE has finally gotten around to manufacturing a DVD and Blu-Ray set that's totally focused on Scott Hall.
The content listing for the Blu-Ray version of this upcoming WWE release looks absolutely marvelous from start to finish.
I'm so very glad that the famous WWE Debut Vignettes from 1992 for Razor Ramon were all included on this upcoming WWE release.
It would have been such an atrocious decision by WWE to have left those vignettes off of this upcoming DVD/Blu-Ray release.

Here's the full content listing for the Blu-Ray version of ""Living on a Razor's Edge: The Scott Hall Story"".

I loved this documentary on him simply because while he wrestled for WWF/WWE I do not think he was given enough of a push to be the guy. In my humble opinion, he should have been WWF/WWE Champion many times over. I am glad the he is now more widely acknowledged for his many wonderful contributions to wrestling, and that he is more than willing to bestow his wisdom to the young, aspiring wrestlers. I really enjoyed this video. Thank you for such a great documentary on such a great man!!!",1477008000,,612,4.194915254237288

7664436,5,B01BN52ZWG,"I was never all that big of a Razor Ramon fan as a kid.. but that means very little, honestly. That is to say, I appreciate just about all of these guys more now as an adult and looking back.
But regardless, Hall has a fantastic story laid out here. His humbleness and generosity were amazing to hear about. And the last few chapters... man.. those really got me. I haven't seen that footage of him at that indy show in '11 since...... probably '11, so seeing it again was very sad.
It doesn't end there though, and goes into his recovery and HOF induction.

I own a few of these DVDs/BluRays about wrestlers from my youth, and I like them all to a certain degree.. but this one, man. This one was fantastic to watch.

The matches are ok, but as I said.. I wasn't really much of a Razor Ramon fan. That also kinda translates into his pre-Razor career as well, and also his nWo run. They're still good to watch though, so don't get me wrong.
His match against Rick Martel is probably one of the best I've ever seen, and I'm so glad to finally see at least something from Martel on one of these.. guy's seriously underrated.
I also remember hearing an interview somewhere with Hall about getting in trouble for his match against Chris Jericho in WCW. So it was amusing to see that match with that in mind. :)

Anyway, yea.. definitely worth the purchase!",1471046400,,1352,4.357142857142857

Normally I save my summary towards the end but I'll give it now in that this was one of my favorite documentaries they've done on a superstar as it was truly a ""feel good"" story of not only someone overcoming their demons that everyone in & outside of the wrestling business has been a witness with WWE once again going outside of their ""universe"" to use footage to add to the story (DDP Yoga & Jake Roberts' ""Resurrection"" movie, The Jerry Springer Show, ect.) along with rare footage of their own (his dark match debut & legal deposition from WWE's lawsuit against WCW). The only real negatives I have is towards the match selection as the WrestleMania X Ladder Match is the most overused match in WWE Home Video's history (this is the seventh time) while their SummerSlam rematch hasn't been released in almost a decade & a match from his initial feud with Randy Savage would have been nice to have here. Overall this is a story either through this DVD or waiting to eventually watch on their network, this is a story I recommend to see.

The documentary begins talking about Hall's early life being the son of a military pilot moving all around to the point where he graduated high school in another country before going into his passion for professional wrestling as far as who was the one person that he idolized & what souvenir he still had from his first event to this day leading into the one incident that forever changed his life from his memories of what happened to the point where he tried but couldn't discuss it at the beginning of the presentation. The steps he took around his hometown to get into the wrestling business was discussed next from his popular ""look"" to a story about his first pair of boots leading into his time in the AWA & what he learned from his partner Curt Hennig before going into what happened in his personal life that lead to his career as the Diamond Studd in WCW from how his iconic look came together & how one of his long term brotherhoods began. How he came into WWE after trying for a year was discussed next leading up to how his Razor Ramon character was created & a funny story behind Al Pachino's reaction to the character but also how the character was getting so popular that they decided to turn him babyface in a way that hadn't been done before going into the formation of The Kliq & how it was ""bittersweet"" for him to become the Intercontinental Champion but worked out in the end followed by going into how he remained humble despite his popularity in his personal life & also with the fans including a touching story of his visit to The Jerry Springer Show. His reasons for going to WCW & his impact with the New World Order in not only WCW but also how he ""felt like Elvis"" with how WWE responded to it along with a funny story behind the origins of his famous ""Hey Yo!"" How his career took a turn for the worse was discussed next from his personal life effecting his wrestling life, how it was taken advantage of on camera to the point & effected him in his return in 2002 to where he openly admitted he was the ""poster boy for everything you could do wrong in wrestling"" followed by his various legal issues & the source of his constant downward spiral including the infamous footage of his drunken appearance on an independent show. Diamond Dallas Page & Jake Roberts reaching out to him was shown next from how he was worse than expected when they met up with him, how the fans showed their support for him, and how he was able to get back on track both mentally & physically & the steps leading to his eventual Hall Of Fame induction including his reunion of the Kliq for the first time in over a decade before ending on his legacy today passing on his knowledge on to the younger generation of superstars & his legacy through his own son.

Matches Include:
American Starship vs. Inferno #1 and Inferno #2 - This was a quick squash match showcasing the team of Hall & his partner Danny Spivey.
""Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling"" Dec. '84

vs. Michael Hayes - Hall was known as ""Coyote"" during this time as he kept easily overpowering & showing him up focusing on different parts of the body causing Hayes to keep using different tactics to stop Hall's momentum from using the referee to bending the rules to his advantage while Buddy Roberts on the outside made his presence known in a solid contest.
""AWA Championship Wrestling"" Nov. '85

$100,000 Battle Royal - It should be noted that not only would the winner win the money but also the ""Wrestle Wagon"" vehicle as some of the participants included Road Warriors, Leon White before he became Big Van Vader, Jimmy Garvin, Greg Gagne, Larry & Curt Hennig, Ray Stevens & Larry Zbyszko in your typical battle royal with the highlight being when it came down to the final four.
""AWA Championship Wrestling"" Nov. '85

AWA Tag Team Championship Match w/Curt Hennig vs. Long Riders - It should be noted that there was a special presentation for Hall before the match started as both him & Hennig were working over their opponents via different parts of the body while playing to their strengths of Hennig's athleticism along with Hall's power always staying a step ahead of their opponents before Long Riders singling out an opponent from his partner & other dirty tactics such as double teaming & taking advantage of distractions.
AWA WrestleRock '86

Diamond Studd vs. Tommy Rich - This was the debut of Hall under the gimmick ""The Diamond Studd"" with Diamond Dallas Page as his manager in what was a quick dominate match showcasing his power.
""WCW Clash of the Champions XV"" June '91

The Diamond Exchange vs. Brian Lee & Chris Sullivan - This was nothing more than an enhancement match with Studd & DDP showcasing both themselves as a team along with their individual offense & personalities.
""World Championship Wrestling"" Dec. 7, 1991

vs. Paul Van Dale - This was the debut of Hall as ""Razor Ramon"" in a quick match showcasing his power but also showcasing his gimmick by completely slapping & humiliating his opponent in the process.
""Superstars"" Aug. '92

vs. WWE Champion Bret Hart - Bret had his parents in the front row while Razor had previously attacked his brother Owen & even threw his toothpick at the fan Bret gave his sunglasses to as both men were evenly matched trading punches & heavily worked a specific parts of the body throughout the match using whatever tactics they could from stretching the rules & using their environment as Razor used his power & size while Bret relied on his speed & wrestling skills in a really good match with Bret being more physical than he previous had been as a champion up to this point since this was his most personal title match to date.
Royal Rumble '93

vs. The Kid - All I can say is don't take a bathroom break here as you'll miss what is still considered to be one of the biggest upsets in not just RAW but probably WRESTLING history here.
""RAW"" May '93
[Best Of RAW: 15th Anniversary; RAW ""The Beginning"": Best Of Seasons 1 & 2; The Kliq Rules]

vs. Intercontinental Champion Shawn Michaels - Diesel was at ringside for this as they were evenly matched early playing to each other's strengths before Shawn was able to get an advantage working over an area of the body before Razor was able to use Shawn's own momentum against him & being able to keep catching Shawn in what was a solid contest but more of a preview of what was to come in their most memorable & classic encounters.
Sept. '93

Intercontinental Championship Match vs. Rick Martel - With Shawn Michaels being suspended & stripped of the Intercontinental Championship in the process, this was the vacancy match to declare a new champion after both men were the last two standing in a battle royal a week earlier. Razor worked over Martel's arm early with a bunch of wrenching & twisting early along with various armbars. Martel countered by punishing Razor's back with stomps, kneedrops, and even doing his signature Boston Crab. They weren't back & forth getting very competitive over time before Razor Ramon went on to win his first of many then-record breaking Intercontinental Title reigns.
""RAW"" Oct. '93
[RAW ""The Beginning"": Best Of Seasons 1 & 2]

Ladder Match: Intercontinental Champion Razor Ramon vs. Shawn Michaels - This was the first ladder match to be seen on WWE television. Both men started off wrestling early before Diesel got involved & ended up paying for it before Razor removed the outside mat & exposed the concrete that didn't end up working in his favor. The ladder came into play from here as Shawn started to use it as a weapon to attack Razor's ribs starting with a baseball slide into the ladder right into Razor's ribs & later doing a big splash off the top of it while later Razor used it to his advantage by whipping Shawn into it & using it squish Shawn into the ring post. There were times when both men launched an attack while one was on the ladder much as Razor slamming Shawn off of it & him ""making an ass"" of Shawn to prevent him from winning the match. This ladder match was the one that set the standard for what WWE would do this match for years to come as it was definitely a match where both men came out stronger than they went in with Jerry Lawler to the point said about one competitor, ""He Is Superman!""
WrestleMania X
[From The Vault: Shawn Michaels; History Of Intercontinental Championship; Ladder Match 2: Crash & Burn; Best Of WWE At Madison Square Garden; True Story Of WrestleMania; The Kliq Rules]

vs. Intercontinental Champion Diesel - It should be noted that Razor had NFL star Walter Peyton in his corner while Diesel had Shawn Michaels in his along with the fact that Diesel was coming into this match a double champion as him & Shawn had won the Tag Team Championships the night before. Razor was able to keep knocking Diesel off his feet either through his punches or leaving his feet himself while Diesel relied on his power & targeting an area of the body with Shawn getting involved various times either physically or causing a distraction with Peyton on the outside that didn't always work in his favor in a competitive match.
SummerSlam '94

Intercontinental Championship Match vs. Jeff Jarrett - Razor came into this match defending the Intercontinental Championship for the second year in a row as both men traded momentum back & forth throughout the contest with one man not getting a heavy advantage over the over for very long until a freak landing opened the door for one man to heavily target a body part non-stop with his opponent fighting back from behind. This was a good match that was competitive between the two men & told a good story in regards to working over the injury.
Royal Rumble '95
[History Of Intercontinental Championship]

Intercontinental Championship Match vs. Goldust - It should be noted that Marlena made her debut here as Goldust's director at ringside as Goldust kept attempted to play mind games with touching him & reacting to being touched by Razor in ways that he's not used to while constantly going to the outside whenever Razor was starting to build momentum before eventually targeting an area of the body while Razor fought using his trademark offense using his power along with taking some shortcuts of his own in a back & forth contest.
Royal Rumble '96

Outsiders vs. Sting & Lex Luger - Outsiders attempted to embarrass their opponents early only for Sting & Luger to respond with power & using a ""hit & move"" offense causing the Outsiders to take shortcuts such as manipulating the referee & double teaming in a back & forth tag match that made everyone start to question if the nWo's power & influence was effecting more than just the wrestlers but also pay attention to the commentary as Bobby Heenan being the entertaining heel commentator kept accidentally cheering Hall & Nash.
WCW Hog Wild '96

The Outsiders vs. WCW Tag Team Champions Harlem Heat - These teams were almost mirror images of each other as they had the combination of the in-ring worker (Hall & Booker) having a bigger & stronger partner (Stevie & Nash) as Hall & Booker started out as Hall was hip tossed over the top rope at one point before Stevie Ray took a shot on the outside that caused Hall to spit at Stevie before tagging in Nash only for Stevie to take down Nash & give Hall a receipt. Both teams showed that they had no problems bending the rules to their advantage as they used the same tactics against each other such as taking shots being the referee's back & double teaming with Sister Sherri even getting involved from time to time before she got caught by Hall & got a taste of ""machismo"" for her troubles. This was the only time I recall these teams facing each other (which is a crime) as they worked well together & had a very good match.
WCW Halloween Havoc '96
[Allied Powers: Wresting's Greatest Tag Teams; nWo: The Revolution]

vs. Scott Steiner - Hall was looking for revenge for the Steiners winning the tag titles the previous week with him trying to intimidate & embarrass Steiner while working him over only Steiner only for him to give Hall a taste of his own medicine & dominating with his power to the point where he almost took out a cameraman from throwing Hall so hard in the corner only for Hall to start taking shortcuts & sending direct messages to other people Hall had an issue with in a solid back & forth contest.
""WCW Monday Nitro"" Oct. '97

vs. Chris Jericho - This was a very quick match that saw Hall showing that he wasn't taking Jericho as seriously as he should have allowing Jericho to capitalize & keep catching Hall off guard on more than one occasion as this match was more of the story behind the scenes that Jericho has talked about in his book with Hall recognizing & attempting to help a young talent.
""WCW Monday Nitro"" Nov. '97

vs. WCW Champion Sting - Hall, with Dusty Rhodes in his corner, won the World War 3 Battle Royal back in November to earn this title shot. Sting was in control early as Hall had a moment to gain momentum but lost it quickly when he decided to showboat instead of go for the win. This match went back & forth with Dusty had to keep getting involved various time in order for Hall to get an advantage, including dropping his bionic elbow at one point, but he payed for on the third attempt allowing Sting to get the win in what was a nice match.
WCW Uncensored '98

Outsiders vs. Goldberg & Sid Vicious - It should be noted that Hall walked into this match a double champion holding both the United States & Television titles while Sid was Goldberg's mystery partner after facing each other the night before as they dominated with power easily tossing the Outsiders around & overpowering them causing Outsiders to ""divide & conquer"" singling out one opponent & using whatever tactics possible to keep their advantage & neutralize their power in a solid tag team match.
""WCW Monday Nitro"" Nov. '99

vs. The Rock - The Rock came into this match looking for revenge to the point where he ran directly to the ring & applied the sharpshooter in the opening minute but had his injured ribs taped that Hall directly targeted while Hogan & Nash were on the outside making their presence known whenever possible in what was a quick match.
""SmackDown!"" Mar. '02

vs. Steve Austin - Kevin Nash was in Hall's corner as Austin took the fight right to him both in & outside to where Hall wasn't able to get his vest off & took at shot at Nash too causing both Outsiders to resort to dirty tactics to have the advantage for Hall in a good back & forth match with stunners being delivered many times but Austin wasn't the only one delivering them.
WrestleMania X-8

(Blu-Ray) Diamond Studd & Oz vs. Z-Man & Big Josh - Both Oz & Studd used their power only for Josh to match that power while Zenk showcased athleticism in a match that went back & forth between both teams but more significant for this being the first time that Hall & Nash teamed together close to 5 years before they became ""The Outsiders.""
""WCW Power Hour: Sept. '91

(Blu-Ray) Razor Ramon vs. Ted DiBiase - Dibiase attempted to start by attacking from behind only for Razor to fight right back as they traded momentum in the early half before Dibiase was able to heavily work over an area of the body that neutralized Razor's power & size advantage including taking shortcuts when possible only for them to eventually come back to haunt him in a solid back & forth match that was his first major match since becoming a fan favorite but more significant for it being Dibiase's last match in WWE.
SummerSlam '93

(Blu-Ray) Razor Ramon vs. Jeff Jarrett & The Roadie - This was originally set to be Razor teaming with 1-2-3 Kid but became the first handicap match on WWE PPV due to injury as Razor was able to take the fight to both men working them over individually or as a team taking advantage of their mistiming before they were able to capitalize on their numbers advantage with such tactics as illegal double teaming or one man causing a distraction allowing his partner to take advantage in what was a solid match with the bigger story being who showed up afterwords to save Razor from a 2 on 1 attack.
""In Your House"" May '95

(Blu-Ray) Ladder Match vs. Bam Bam Bigelow - Bigelow was looking for revenge for being the victim of Scott Hall's tazer while you saw just how out of control the nWo had gotten at that time with Disco Infernio accompanying Hall to the ring. Bigelow easily overpowered Hall with Hall responding with his punches & top rope bulldog to take Bigelow down before Disco being thrown out from ringside distracted Bigelow allowing Hall to attack him on the outside. The ladder came into play from here with both men using it on each other in the isleway, the ladder having a tweeter totter effect on both men, Hall riding the ladder down off the top rope, Bigelow's headbutt off the ladder, Hall's elbow drop off the ladder, a belly to back suplex off the suplex, Bigelow pulling the ladder from underneath Hall, a tazer fight, and appearance of a man who had his issues with both men. This wasn't a classic ladder match but definitely a match where both men delivered some big punishment to each other.

That is what happens with the Scott Hall story...Living on a Razor's Edge.  This man is a guy that you keep rooting for because when he is sober, he just oozes all kinds of magic and wisdom.  The documentary is a hard watch if you are a fan of Scott's because you feel the pain of him, all of his friends and family telling their horror stories of this man's troubles in life.  You get it all with this documentary...his beginning, his ups and definitely all of his downs.  You get the story of his frightening encounter with a man that Scott ended up killing.  You truly feel his pain, suffering and his overwhelming guilt that this fight ended up with someone losing their life.  But, the documentary ends up on a high note that any fan will feel inspired.  Tons of matches on here as a bonus.  The Blu-ray has more extras than the DVD.  Another knock out of the park with WWE and their documentary series!
