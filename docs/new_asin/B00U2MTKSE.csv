8704034,3,B00U2MTKSE,"Hmm, I guess I'm missing something the other reviewers saw. The story was too slow for me. I don't need ""action"" but it just didn't keep me interested. FYI - I loved ""Get Out"" which was also kind of slow but compelling.

Other reviewers say they loved seeing the art. Well, it is true that I looked up Vermeer's art - something I wouldn't have done had it not been for the movie; so there is that. But as far as the actual movie.... it was just ""OK"".",1505001600,,450,4.113636363636363

8704036,5,B00U2MTKSE,Loved this. A great way to see art in detail that you may never get to see in person. Well worth $2.99. I hope they make all of their films available for streaming!,1489968000,,164,4.0

8704040,4,B00U2MTKSE,Would give it 5 stars if it didn't have English subtitles. The narration is in English but I found no way of turning off the subtitles. I found this feature annoying and unattractive to an otherwise beautiful dvd.,1454371200,3,213,4.631578947368421
