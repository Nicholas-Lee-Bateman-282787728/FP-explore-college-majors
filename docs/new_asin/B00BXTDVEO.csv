No way of telling if the USPS damaged the bubble pack or if DVD case was damaged before packed.
The DVD;s them self where not damage, And I like the movie",1373846400,,341,4.074626865671642
5681054,5,B00BXTDVEO,"Those of you who are old enough to remember when this series came out are already familiar with the quality with which ""How the West Was Won"" was crafted.  This DVD product is made along those lines.  I agree with two other reviewers when they say that the first ""season"" is complete, because the first installment of this series, as it aired on TV, consisted of the ""Macahans"" pilot (1976), and a three-part ""miniseries"" that began airing in 1977. This was followed by a final installment of episodes that continued the saga up to the series' conclusion in 1979.  This last portion is notable because Fionnaula Flanagan took over the main female lead from Eva Marie Saint; Kate Macahan's character was supplanted by that of her sister, Molly Culhane.

The DVD's in this set are sharp and clear, a fitting tribute to Mr. Arness and the actors who worked with him.  This series has been called the last of the great ""made for TV"" Westerns and is superb family entertainment that parents can watch with their kids without concern.  In the late 1970's after ""Gunsmoke,"" Zeb Macahan became as iconic a character as Matt Dillon.  Strong and firm, yet gentle when he needed to be, the elder Macahan kept his family together in a realistic portrayal of many of the issues that arose in the early West.  Bruce Boxleitner also deserves a thumbs-up for his portrayal of the eldest nephew, Luke Macahan.  The main women characters of the series, (especially Eva Marie Saint and Fionnaula Flanagan,) gave, in my opinion, a realistic portrayal of how crucial the pioneer woman was to the development of the West.  There were excellent supporting characters aplenty, too, such as Jack Elam, Morgan Woodward,
Brian Keith, and Ken Curtis (Festus in ""Gunsmoke."")  Ricardo Montalban's portrayal of the Sioux chief Satangkai was nothing short of genius!

I had a very slight acquaintance with Mr. Arness in his later years, and I know Jim would be very proud to see this set finally out on DVD.  I believe that Zeb Macahan was more fun for him to play than Matt Dillon was.  Zeb did not have the restraints that come with a badge, but if you really watch the series, you will see definite similarities between the two characters.  I only hope that the other seasons receive appropriate treatment by the manufacturers and doesn't get ""cut off"" without having all of the seasons appear.  This series is every bit as good as ""Gunsmoke"" was and aptly deserves its niche in the long history of quality American TV Western series.",1373673600,45,2505,4.763888888888889
5681055,5,B00BXTDVEO,"Just finished watching both DVDs that make up Season One. Quality was standard for an old 70s show - not great but not bad. Sound and pic were fine. If you liked the show, you won't be disappointed by the presentation. CAN'T WAIT for Season Two - Guest stars galore appeared that year! All fans of the show please buy this - so they speed up the Season 2 release!",1373414400,2,363,4.2
5681056,5,B00BXTDVEO,"I CAN'T WAIT TILL THE RELEASE DATE. I WATCHED THIS SHOW YEARS AGO AND LOVED IT. I AM SO GLAD WE CAN WATCH THESE PAST SHOWS NOW ON DVD. I AM SOOOO TIRED OF REALITY SHOWS THAT HAVE NO VALUE TO THEM. I JUST HOPE WE DON'T HAVE TO WAIT TOO LONG FOR THE OTHER SEASONS TO BE RELEASED. NOW, IF ONLY THEY WOULD RELEASE GUNS OF PARADISE WITH LEE HORSLEY, THIS WAS A GREAT SHOW ALSO!!!",1370995200,2,374,3.8701298701298703
5681057,5,B00BXTDVEO,"I watched all these shows when they initially were broadcast,then the re runs on TNT. The Movie ""The Macahans"" was broadcast on ABC in 1976 a 2 hour movie which includes commercial time. You could call this the Pilot show, because it started it all.  Then in 1977 there were three two hour segments (Mini Series) Titled ""How the West was won"" with a slight recap of the Macahans movie, then continuing the story where the Macahans movie left off.  This is what they are now calling Season One for the purpose of this first DVD release. Sure glad it's out, sure took long enough.",1367280000,22,578,4.495238095238095
5681058,3,B00BXTDVEO,"I have bought all the European releases of How The West Was Won.

The series itself is as good as I remembered.  The story telling and acting is first rate and although I have the last season still to watch, it is really worth seeing and I would recommend it to anyone apart from one thing.....

The picture quality on the European release is really poor; the image is very faded and colors washed out.

I hope for this release that some restoration has been done.  If it has, I would buy it again - it is that good.

This series really calls out for a BluRay release.",1365724800,,568,4.212962962962963
5681059,4,B00BXTDVEO,"i have read the last review about the coming up release of how the west was won season 1 mini series and i like to make a commet to the last review there is something wrong here about the running time as other dvds released in europe in this series the macahans is 4 discs and running time is 398 mins so the up comming of the region 1 release is only 279 so there over a 100 mins missing so why the difference has the up comming release been edited dose anyone know the answer to this as if its been edited your not reciving the compleat season 1 then,",1365638400,,553,3.990990990990991
5681060,4,B00BXTDVEO,"How the West Was Won was a terrific series.  There is some confusion regarding the release of the ""First Season"".  According to TVShowsOnDvd.com, this release consists of the TV Movie ""The Macahans"" from 1976, and the 3 episode mini-series ""How the West Was Won"" from 1977. Usually the 13 episodes of the TV series that aired in 1978 is considered the first season.",1364947200,37,365,4.777777777777778
5681061,2,B00BXTDVEO,The first season had 13 hr long episodes-so the complete first season would last around 600 minutes-not the 279 minutes that is stated. You would also need more than 2 disks unless tou double side them. There is something very definately amiss here and I'm not sure what it is. The show is worth watching if I remember correctly-but I would have to know what they are giving me before I would consider purchasing.,1364947200,18,413,4.594594594594595

5681088,5,B00BXTDVEO,"I loved this series when it first aired, and I was baffled that it took so long for it to come out on DVD. This is a classic Western. One thing I really liked was the attempt to portray the Indians as they really were, not merely cardboard cut-outs for the cowboys to shoot at. I also liked the honesty of how horribly America treated them.

The Season1 set has a weird quirk. Episode One does not start at the beginning of the series. I was a bit annoyed at this until I found the Pilot under Special Features. This makes no sense. The Pilot should be with the following episodes, not hidden away. That said, the video quality was a bit off for Season 1, but not the Pilot. I also have Season 2, which I am still enjoying my way through. The video quality is excellent. I should receive Season 3 this week.

If you like Westerns or just quality viewing, you will like this series. it is realistic with quality writing and quality acting, James Arness is great as Zeb, the darn near legendary all round hero.

Five stars all the way!",1475366400,,1033,4.287179487179487

5681173,5,B00BXTDVEO,I have been looking for a US version of this series for years.  I loved the show back in the 70's when it first aired. What made the movie so important is that my wife's late mother was one of the extras in the movie.  When James Arness asks for direction at the Indian camp my wife's mom points him in the right direction.  A great show and a great memory,1432339200,,356,3.9859154929577465

5681187,5,B00BXTDVEO,"Excellent pioneer type of show of a family heading west. You do need to watch it in the correct order so here's the trick. Disk one has episodes 1 and 2, disk two has episode 3 and under bonus material there resides the original ""pilot"" movie. Put in disk two first and watch the pilot movie, then take it out, put in disk one and watch episodes 1,2 then put in disk two and watch episode 3. If you forget this, there is an episode guide inside and it shows air dates, watch them in air date order- oldest first, simple enough. Each of these episodes including the pilot are movie length shows of 90 minutes or more so you are getting several hours of great acting and western scenes. The quality of the video is very good and season two is even better. They often recommend these with another series ""The Chisolms"" which is also good (perhaps a 4) but not as good as watching Zeb and Luke. By the way Zeb is the guy who played Matt Dillon on Gunsmoke for 100 years or so, then a few years later began this character and Luke is the guy who was on many shows since this (good in every role)and plays on Cedar Cove today. My wife and I both started on a show called ""Hawkeye"" which was very good score 4.5, then a mini-series called ""the Chisholms"", (not as good score 4,but worth watching) and we enjoyed both of them with some good acting too, then we really loved this show score 5, and are now in the middle of season two of The Family Macahans (or how the west was won)score 5 also. Well worth the money and hoping for the third and final season soon.",1422057600,4,1555,4.2040133779264215

5681216,3,B00BXTDVEO,"Excellent JAMES ARNESS series. Funny, for being the HUGE GUNSMOKE fan that I am (just ordered Season 9 of the original series) I had NO IDEA this series existed - I thought it was a limited mini-series for television. I ordered this first volume (containing the first PILOT FEATURE and first episode) and overall, found it to be quite entertaining. The performances are all excellent (especially from classic stars like Eva Marie Saint, Jack Elam and Anthony Zerbie. The young, largely unknown cast is also attractive and a joy to watch. James Arness shines in a role that while in many ways is like his Matt Dillon role, but this part allows him to expand a bit and be more reckless and colorful. Beautiful location photography really highlights this series as well. My only complaint is that the audio suffers throughout much of this production -- often it sounds 'muffled' or cloaked, and less than professional. Maybe the upcoming first season release will go back and correct the audio portion of this series, which is really inferior. Otherwise, the content is EXCELLENT and this is a series that really deserves to be seen and preserved.",1407628800,,1144,4.871794871794871

5681219,4,B00BXTDVEO,"Great show , one of TV last best Westerns , not to get confused with the film  of the same name . James Arness  plays Zeb  Macahans, He along with His kin venture the frontier . Many famous names guest stars appear  in this great series .  Its a little confusing because it started as a mini series  an that's on disc 2 , then as a TV series as How the West was Won , so the best way  to began to watch this show  is pick up disc 2 an go to special features to watch the mini -series , The Show also stars Eva  Marie Saint and Bruce Boxleitner , it explores in  separate stories on the Characters of the family . The DVD itself is ok . The transfer isn't the best , the colors and picture isn't crisp ,  it  has closed captions the price is good  . The Season 2 just came out an has 6 discs to season one 2 discs . The Macahans is 118 minutes , and How the West was Won is 280 minutes . So try an watch the mini series on disc 2 before You watch the TV series to follow the storyline best .",1406332800,,990,3.7246376811594204

It's just a shame that they were not given in order. However, the viewing experience is fantastic. How the west was won once again proves that James Arness is a phenomenal actor who fits into any role with ease. He plays Jed McCahan in this, as a former mountain man who comes to stay with family who is homesteading moving west to avoid the cavil war. Unfortunately some of them do get caught up in it. Watch the original story on the second disk first, then go back to the first disk and watch the mini-series that led to the series. You'll be glad you did.",1402704000,3,696,4.488188976377953

Luke is played by Bruce Boxleitner who was really perfect for the part.  Sort of the John Crichton (Farscape) of the American West.

This DVD set contains 2 discs with four episodes (about 90 minutes each, except the pilot episode which runs about two hours).  How the West Was Won is similar to Centennial in terms of entertainment value.  It's not perfect (sometimes the parts with Native Americans are a little silly) but it's great fun and, overall, plenty good.  Be sure to watch the pilot episode first which is located on the second disc (please note that two of the characters in the pilot episode had different names from their characters when the series actually started one year later: Seth becomes Luke and Jed becomes Josh).

Hopefully it won't be long until the remaining episodes are released on DVD.  I'm also hoping for some extras, such as interviews with the cast and/or some commentaries.  In closing, this was one of the more intelligent (even if not perfect) Western TV series.  Long live Zeb and Luke.  4.5 stars.",1382140800,,1258,4.647058823529412

James Arness plays Zebulon McCahan, the leader of the clan who leads them across the country.

It Turns out I was. On the second disk in the extras is the FIRST TV movie that starts the story. I was annoyed but it is something I can live with now.

5681277,5,B00BXTDVEO,"This DVD set includes the complete (but short) 1977 season of ""How the West Was Won"". As a bonus, on Disc #2, this set also includes the original TV-Movie pilot from 1976.

Some critics are complaining that this DVD Release shouldn't be called ""Season One"",  because it doesn't include any episodes from 1978 (when the series settled into a regular weekly slot on ABC's Sunday night schedule for several months).

But ""How the West Was Won"" did not start out as a traditional weekly series.  The original pilot TV-movie aired in January 1976, and was titled ""The Macahans.""  The following year, in February of 1977, a short first season, consisting of three 2-hour episodes was aired.  This DVD set includes the complete 1977 season (all three 2-hour episodes), and also includes as a bonus the original pilot movie from 1976.

Picture quality is quite decent for a show from this era.  And the performances are mostly very good, holding up much better and feeling far less dated than the majority of 1970's television.  In particular, Eva Marie Saint shines in her role as the matriarch of the family.

The 1978 season of the series did air weekly (from February to May of that year), and episodes from the 1978 season varied in length.  Some episodes, including the season opener and the season finale, ran upwards of 3 hours in length.  The bulk of the season, however, aired as 1 hour episodes.

None of the episodes from 1978 are included on this ""Season One"" DVD set.

The 1978 season is scheduled for Release on July 15, 2014, according to Amazon, and is being labeled as ""Season Two"".

The 1979 season (which originally aired as weekly 2-hour episodes from February to  April of 1979) will probably be called ""Season Three"" or ""the Final Season"", when released on DVD.",1374796800,120,1776,4.754901960784314
5681278,3,B00BXTDVEO,"This is in no way, shape or form the complete first season of How The West Was Won.  I watched this series back in 1976-77 and have the entire series on bootleg DVDs.  How The West Was Won started as a movie pilot in 1976 (The Macahans), followed by a 3-part mini series in February 1977.  The first season started in the fall of 1977. (13 episodes).

The only 2 things on this DVD are the movie pilot (inexplicably shown out of order on the 2nd disc as a bonus feature) and the 3-part mini series from 1977 shown first on disc 1 and completed on disc 2.  If someone had never seen this series, they'd be pretty confused watching the programs in the order they are presented.

I've given this 3 stars simply because the series was magnificent as was James Arness as Zeb Macahan as well as the breathtaking scenery, musical score and story-lines.  Truly one of the last, great westerns for television.  But if you're looking for the complete first season, you won't find it on this DVD set.

I'll be holding on to my bootlegs.  At least they're complete.",1374278400,4,1053,4.409326424870466
