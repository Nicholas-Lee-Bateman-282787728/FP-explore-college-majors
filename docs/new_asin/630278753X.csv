7831356,3,630278753X,"This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen with a great cast.  It's a ton of fun, it's super colorful, great characters, and has a beautiful musical score so if you can handle a stinker of a movie, it's a must-see.  Straight out of the '50's Hollywood classic adventures and I love every minute of it.  It would be great on Blue Ray.
A movie that's truly worth watching... just watch it with a sense of humor and enjoy the color, music, and the fun of watching a kinda funky movie.
BTW, there's one shot of Rex Harrison's stand-in riding one of the most beautiful chestnut horses I've ever seen.  A beautiful, shiny copper coat with four white sox.",1287273600,5,659,4.333333333333333
7831357,5,630278753X,King Richard and the Crusaders is a good tall tale with lots of action and adventure with a good dose of comedy.,1255305600,,112,4.136363636363637
7831358,3,630278753X,"A pretty good movie considering the fact that it was made in 1954, years before Ben Hur, Spartacus, The 300 Spartans, Cleopatra, the Fall of the Roman Empire, El Cid and other classics.  The story unfolds during the Third Crusade a.k.a. the Kings' Crusade (1189-1192), in the Holy Land with the combined armies of the English, French and Germans preparing for a showdown with Saladin's Saracens.  The hero is a Scottish knight, who is an enemy of England, but loyal to King Richard (no explanation given/do not ask why or how).
On the positive side: a) some very nice desert shots and a beautiful looking castle, b) excellent costumes of Crusaders and Saracens, and c) a wonderful feel of History and the Crusades (accurate description of conditions found within the two camps i.e. Complete loyalty in Saladin's encampment and severe disunity in the Crusaders').
On the negative side: a) it is an old movie by modern standards with the battle scenes/tactics very much outdated, b) the acting is not as much ""natural"" as it is staged, one could say it is way too ""theatrical"" (the poses and all...), c) the Lady's accent is 100% American, definitely not the way the English King's cousin should sound like (do I hear Kevin Costner in Robin Hood?), while the Scott sounds nothing of the Highlands (King Richard at times does give off a little of Sean Connery though).
Strongly recommended to those who love History and the Crusades in particular.  One should seriously start thinking about re-doing the movie or a similar Crusade-related one with today's technology...",1087430400,8,1566,4.924242424242424
7831359,2,630278753X,"Well, the film didn't follow the book but that's not surprising. This was an obvious B- movie for the masses. I did enjoy watching Rex Harrison ham it up as Saladin, he obbviously had a good time with the part. Virginia Mayo was gorgeous, Laurence Harvey was stiff/predictable, and George Sanders was a disappointing King Richard. Although acting like the real King Richard would be tough for most hollywood actors in the 50's. The close-up horse-riding scenes were silly (moving background - static horse) and the battle scenes were lame. The jousts were OK and the desert dune scene was fun. All-in-all it was what I expected from a low budget 50's flick.

I nearly collapsed from laughter.  Don't watch it for history,
great acting, costumes, or sets.  And lose the popcorn.  You
don't want to choke between giggles!",1027209600,3,225,5.027027027027027
7831361,2,630278753X,"Oh, this is a really bad movie! Having joined the film in medias res, when it was rewound for viewing again, I was surprised to find that  Rex Harrison actually has top billing--the reason for my surprise was that at every turn, one had to be confronted with the untalented preening of Lawrence Harvey as an ersatz Errol Flynn ""dashing"" hero, offering self-satisfied King Richard (George Sanders) advice he really doesn't want to hear, and proferring love to Richard's cousin Edith (Virginia Mayo) even though she is too high born to be courted by a Scotsman like himself. He's a very bad Scotsman too; if George Sanders didn't keep repeating ad nauseum, ""Never trust a Scot"", one would quickly lose that thread.  And there leering away whenever the limelight hits him, is our old favorite, Rex Harrison as the Saracen leader Saladin, though he first masquerades as an Arab physician who must save the life of King Richard, laid low by a poisoned arrow. That shooting part had  also happened before I joined the film, so I was mystified as to why George Sanders was playing all his scenes from a bed, since he didn't convey mortal illness at all, just indolence. I usually enjoy Rex tremendously, but his shameless mugging, with rolling eyes and stilted speech is a tad too much to be borne. Evidently young Rex was often employed as an exotic foreigner, as in ""Anna and the King of Siam"", and his accent is pretty much the same here, so this might have been titled,  ""King Richard and the King of Siam"" .  If you want to see a  better Hollywood movie about the Crusades, check out Cecil B. de Mille's ""The Crusades""--less preposterous, and much better acted.",995241600,4,1659,4.683848797250859
7831362,4,630278753X,"Having stolen the story idea from Robert Scott's THE TALISMAN, Warner Bros. of the 50's uses plenty of smaltz & zippered costumes along with desert daring-do.  Yeah, it's very VERY dated & absolutely unauthentic,  but Rex Harrison's portrayal of Saladin is NOT TO BE MISSED!  Ah, sigh, to  be in his harem...and Lawrence Harvey, bleached hair & all, does the  best an Englishman can to impersonate a Scot.  It's fun. It's flashy.  You'll enjoy it over & over.",934588800,17,459,4.8076923076923075
