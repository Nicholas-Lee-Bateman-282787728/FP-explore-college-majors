4485971,3,B004WBAAXA,"I expected to tune in to just a horse movie and was surprised to find out this movie was about a young man's struggle to deal with his own pain. His compassion for a  tormented horse seems to mirror his own as he seeks out to find the answers on how to heal it's problems and hopefully his own. The movie is set in Africa's Kalahari desert and has strong Chrsitian themes. It is a good family movie, but a bit slow which may make it hard for young children to sit through.  I thoroughly enjoyed the message and theme of the movie. This is one horse whisperer movie I will watch again.",1317254400,12,584,4.15929203539823
8444828,4,B004WBAAXA,A slow moving but wonderfully themed movie.  The previous reviews explain well the main plot but I also enjoyed the red sands and beautiful desert sunrises and sunsets.  I highly recommend this to anyone wrestling with self-doubt or self-destructive tendencies.,1513382400,,261,5.5

8444832,1,B004WBAAXA,"I am a horse owner and will sit through a bad movie just to watch the horse scenes. But this one was so extremely slow moving, almost nothing happened for about 45 minutes. we finally gave up on it and did not finish the movie.",1447977600,,227,4.066666666666666
8444833,4,B004WBAAXA,I purchased this for my wife who really liked it very much.,1442448000,,59,4.0
8444834,5,B004WBAAXA,"This is not be an action packed Hollywood production filled with wonderous computer generated effects. It is, however, a lovely, peaceful story of a young man with physical and emotional problems, who is trying to help a beautiful Arabian stallion with his own physical and emotional problems, lest the stallion be put to death. The young man employs the services of a horse whisper in the Kalahari Desert with some most unusual methods. I am not one to be moved or touched emotionally by a movie, but this one did exactly that to me, especially since it was based upon a true story.",1439856000,5,583,4.669902912621359
8444835,5,B004WBAAXA,This is a great movie.  A drama based on a true life story about a young man who sets out to help a horse be healed by a horse whisperer and finds himself becoming the healer and the healed.  He then turns around and opens a ranch to help heal troubled youths using horses.  He becomes a pastor and whisperer of sorts like the man who trained him to help Tornado.,1402272000,2,363,4.084507042253521
8444836,4,B004WBAAXA,"I purchased this through Amazon.com because I have always been pleased in dealing with them.  I really have enjoyed watching ""Riding Tornado"" as it portrays how a young man is dealing with his own demons, and found a horse that displays the same self-loathing by self-mutilation, which he wants to help so he won't be destroyed.  By helping Tornado, he also helps himself get well.  He had lost his faith, but through loving this horse, his faith is restored.  Loving has a way of working magic; which brings along forgiveness for yourself and others.  Unconditional love is healing and this movie displays this through a man and this man's family which takes him under their wings.",1358899200,3,682,4.844827586206897
