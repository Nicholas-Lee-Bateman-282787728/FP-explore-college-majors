8518888,4,B007K7ICLK,"For a first real role for Ladd this was great.  Baby stood out in the cast in looks and in just the energy level he
kept throught the whole movie till his death.  Again, he showed what he could do, in roles after this one he seemed
to keep a lid on his emotions.",1410220800,3,262,3.8333333333333335
8518889,4,B007K7ICLK,"The trowel is used on occasions in this wartime (1942) film to lay on the patriotism, but a strong cast, a steady directorial hand and a decent (if familiar) plot manage to survive the intruded propaganda. Michele Morgan is particularly effective; she is a glowing on-screen presence, worth the price of admission. Paul Henreid leads the band of downed flyers, and turns in a typically reliable performance. Alan Ladd is another of the flyers but his performance crashes in the film's one truly awful scene. Thomas Mitchell, as the priest, is excellent, as usual, and the supporting cast generally do well. Nothing outstanding here (apart perhaps from Morgan) but worth a look.",1390348800,4,677,5.053571428571429
