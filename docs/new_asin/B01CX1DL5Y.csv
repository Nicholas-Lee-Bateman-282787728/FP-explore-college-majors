7694654,4,B01CX1DL5Y,"By turns, fascinating and disgusting. Our Princess close up - an emerging adult - but panning back - the body of a child.  While living with Mom and Mom's sleazy boyfriend, a brief encounter with her actual father points to the long painful road ahead - for everyone. In the end, the teenage houseguest got it right - dropping a virtual bomb on the story.  And our Princess now cuts her sandwich with a switchblade - symbolizing a giant step to becoming her own person.",1467158400,2,469,4.5058823529411764

7694657,4,B01CX1DL5Y,"This complex film is really a brilliant study of a dysfunctional family unit. The mother, while having real affection for her young daughter, is troubled. She lacks the basic tools to parent properly, including an inability to establish healthy boundaries in her home, whether it's not behaving sexually in front of a child, setting boundaries with her live-in boyfriend, or setting boundaries of conduct for the daughter.  She is alternately extremely loving and bitterly cruel to her lover and her child, and struggles with jealousy toward the girl, occasionally viewing her as a sexual rival. When all the fuzzy boundaries result in the boyfriend's gradual sexual conquest of the child (resulting in her rape), relationship crisis comes to a head.

Reviews will be mixed for this, because people won't understand that the teen-aged boy in the film doesn't exist except in the young girl's head. Like many a victim of severe childhood abuse, the girl develops a rich imaginary world where she can be emotionally safe; such alter-egos are not uncommon. (I worked with sexual assault victims for over a dozen years.)  As a teen boy, in her mind, she can be strong, invincible, and free. The boyfriend feeds this fantasy by addressing her as a boy. She eventually learns that even boys get hurt.

Someone here said there was no ending. I don't agree at all. The mother evolves, as does the girl, and in her own way takes control of the situation in a dramatic way. The only character that evades evolution is the boyfriend pedophile.

I found so much in this film that was very realistic in terms of these situations: in real life the endings and resolutions are not as neatly tied up as people imagine or would like to believe.  These families are severely damaged before sexual abuse sets in, and rarely find the intervention they need. What does happen is that they find ways to cope in the best ways they can.  This film is ultimately terribly touching, as a troubled, mentally ill mother has to reach inside herself to find some sense of morality and motherhood, and a young child has to find a way to stand on her own two feet against a world that should have done better by her.",1465430400,29,2184,4.746701846965699
7694658,1,B01CX1DL5Y,This movie is an awful yet accurate case of Mother blaming underage daughter for Stepfather molesting her.  No only does the mother see the signs of abuse she does nothing.  Once mother acknowledges that she knows something is going on she blames daughter and still stays with the lowlife pedophile.,1465257600,6,299,4.96
7694659,4,B01CX1DL5Y,"This is a brilliant film. Beautifully acted - newcomer Shira Haas as Adar is amazing - and it's a powerful script.  This is the first non-exploitative film about a sexual relationship between a parent and child that I've seen that was told through the child's eyes. Her incredible coping mechanism - the creation of an imaginary male alter-ego, Alan, is exquisite. This is wonderful film making, brave and compelling.",1464566400,10,417,5.043478260869565
8754320,1,B01CX1DL5Y,Disgusting the way our feminists society gives custody always to women and than they live with men who molest their children,1526428800,,124,4.9523809523809526
8754321,3,B01CX1DL5Y,"What you get here is a very strange family. Mom turns a blind eye. Boyfriend is molesting the daughter. Daughter is doing bad in school, smoking, etc. Trying to get attention from the Mother for help but it never really comes. Mix that in with a weird story line of a boy who kind of looks like her who comes to live with them for a while. I think the director was trying to get a point of it being split personalities with the kid and 2 actual people. It became muddled and unnecessary throughout the movie. The main girl does look like Chloe Grace Moretz if you like her work.",1523404800,,578,4.216216216216216

8754323,3,B01CX1DL5Y,"WARNING: SPOILERS. This film was very hard to watch, and not just because the story line isn't clear. It's obvious that a child was being abused. I believe it was a girl, and in order to protect herself from the emotional and physical pain of the abuse, she creates a male alter ego. The problem with this is there are a number of scenes where the mother and the mother's boyfriend seem to be interacting with the male alter ego while the girl looks on. That could simply indicate that the male is the dominant personality at that time.

Almost as difficult as watching the abuse was seeing the mother's reaction and her jealousy that her daughter was playing ""those filthy games with MY boyfriend."" Yet the mother at other times says she loves her daughter more than anyone else in the world. I wish the girl had told her real father about what was happening so he could sue for custody, not to mention having the pervert boyfriend arrested.

I assume the fact that the girl goes back to school indicates that she has realized that she must protect herself and at this point the best way to do that is not to be alone with her mother's boyfriend any more than necessary. It is also a positive step toward the girl's future. The mother's response to the situation is somewhat ambiguous - she obviously does something to hurt the boyfriend's genitalia but she does not kick him out of the house or have him arrested. I think both the mother and the boyfriend should be arrested. Unfortunately this is an extremely common situation. I used to watch newscasts every day as part of my job. I would say at least ninety percent of the child abuse cases that were reported were committed by the mother's boyfriend who was not the child's biological father. I cannot fathom how any mother could put a boyfriend or husband ahead of her child. But it happens every day.",1508889600,4,1859,4.529761904761905
8754324,4,B01CX1DL5Y,"Was a sad depiction of sexual abuse and a child trying to make sense of it all. The adults do not show any boundaries.
The mother is openly sexual  around her young daughter. And then pretends she doesn't know that her boyfriend
Is having sexual play with her daughter. The girl creates  an outlet by having another self...Who is a male. Hoping to feel safe.
So sad but was a true  depiction of situations every day.",1502064000,,416,4.447368421052632

8754327,3,B01CX1DL5Y,This movie was disturbing to say the least.  I am disappointed that my comprehension is not a little more clear.  I felt that the story line could have gone two ways.  First either the main character was a young woman who was sexually abused by her mother's lover.  The mother felt threatened by her daughters coming of age.  I think that at this point she knew that was the wrong attitude to have and maybe realized that this was because she knew that what was happening between her daughter and her lover was wrong and no longer innocent play.  Secondly the main character could have been a young boy who was being sexually abused by his mother's lover.  Either way the main character created the alter ego in order to cope with the traumatic things happening to her/him.  In the end nothing was really resolved but I felt that some headway was made.  The mother started to realize that she shouldn't be blaming her child who was being molested and that she should put the blame rightfully on her lovers head.  I felt that the movie was well done but not really worth buying or watching again though I don't feel that my time was completely wasted.  I just wish that the ending would have been more conclusive.  Perhaps the dad almost beating the lover to within an inch of his life to gratify my need for violence.  The abuse did make me very angry.  Also perhaps the mother could have given her child much needed consistent affection rather than the bipolar version that the movie seemed stuck on.,1497225600,3,1501,4.5315985130111525
8754328,4,B01CX1DL5Y,"I thought this was extremely well done. I'm not sure but I think that its actually about a boy being abused and his starting to identify as female in order to cope, with the final casting off of the male personality in the end, or I saw one reviewer who felt that the boy is just an imaginary friend in order to cope. I personally thought it was boy who begins to identify as female due to the abuse. Either way it makes you think, and I will probably have to watch this again to try and figure it out lol.",1494979200,,506,4.01980198019802
