2414744,5,B000BDH6DU,"This is one of the best westerns of its time--Great cast with Randoph Scott--one of the best western actors around, and Lee Marvin (a young Lee Marvin I might say) The color is great and the canyons and rocks they film in are shot better than alot of newer westerns.  The plot is great and the picture is crystal clear.  If you love westerns of the fifties and sixties and love Scott and Marvin--do not miss this one--don't rent-just buy now!!!!!!!!!!",1136764800,5,451,4.555555555555555
2414745,5,B000BDH6DU,"I've read about this film for years but had never seen it. Because it was tied up in the John Wayne estate and BATJAC holdings, it hadn't made it to video (at least DVD) until now. Wayne was off doing oher things so it was never planned that he star in it, and reprotedly he suggested Scott for the part, but it's also related that once he saw the finished product, he wished he had done it.
Well it's here and the reputation is born out. A well drawn story, with interesting characters, great scenery, good cast and generally a first class film all around. Scott is the ramrod straight hero who is out to right a wrong and Lee Marvin is the intersting, semi likeable, principal villan. Gail Russel is the female lead who along with her screen husband are befriended by Scott on the trail. The spare script and good though not extravegant production values add to the tone and feel of the film. The special features indicate it's been restored, and I don't know from that, but the picture and colors are first rate. It's presented in widescreen format and I don't think it was  orginally shot that way, but it comes across great in that aspect. Hard to imagine it looking any better on the big screen. This is the first of the Scott-Boetticher collaborations and it's time to bring The Tall T, Ride Lonesome and Comanche Station to DVD. These are all classic westerns and worth the trouble to bring them to the genre starved market today. Interstingly, the villians in these particular films are actually more fully drawn than the hero who's a bit on the stoic side. Richard Boone had that role in The Tall T, Pernell Roberts in Ride Lonesome, and Claude Akins in Comanche Station. A formula of a type, I'm sure, but well done as you build a little sympathy, or at least tolerance, for the bad guy.
Highly recommend!",1135209600,60,1816,4.503030303030303
2414746,5,B000BDH6DU,"I, too, saw this last night on TCM, along with the very welcome documentary about Budd Boetticher's life.  Some years ago I became a big fan of the Boetticher/Scott cycle of westerns when a local repertory movie house showed a double feature of The Tall T and Ride Lonesome.  That last image of the burning tree which ended Ride Lonesome really stayed with me.  Ever since then I've searched in vain for any of the Boetticher/Scotts on VHS and later DVD.  I certainly hope this release heralds the methodical release of all six others on DVD.  The film itself was a perfect start to the series, with Lee Marvin in fine form as an arrogant, insinuating presence.  I find it hard, ultimately, to put into words just WHY these films are so damn good.  Yes, there's fine cinematography of the western landscape, but many genre flicks have that.  Perhaps it's the sure, confident handling of well-worn conventions, the charm of Scott, the more ""felt"" quality of the violence.  In any case, having grown up a movie lover but a Western skeptic, Boetticher showed me that westerns can be truly involving films.

Release them all!!!",1135209600,7,1123,4.742268041237113
2414747,5,B000BDH6DU,"If not for television's greatest station, Turner Classic Movies, I would probably have never seen this film.  It was shown last evening as part of a tribute to the film's director and a terrific documentary with Clint Eastwood and Quention Tarantino, of all people, weighing in on the merits of the film and the careers of the director and the fine actor, Randolph Scott. This is a superb, beautifully done western in every aspect: from the spare, yet stunning, cinematography; a terrific score; a lively, intelligent script; and first rate performances from Scott, Lee Marvin, and the unheralded Gail Russell, who has a naturalness and an authentic way about her that few actresses of her era seemed to possess.  But it may be Scott who is the revelation here.  His director said he had what many actors lack: CLASS. And here it is: a subtle way of delivering a line; a look of reproach that is never pushed; a way of handling himself and being a man - and a gentleman - that is not as appreciated as it should be.  His performance - and the quality of the film - make this a MUST SEE for film fans, even if westerns are not your style.  The quality of the production will be a revelation to many.  It certainly was to me.  I'm now going to watch - and probably purchase - them all.  This colloboration of actor and director ranks with the finest of all time.  And Randolph Scott, a true movie hero by any definition, should now get the kudos he deserves for being a most unusual man by modern standards: strong, polite, literate, and gentle.  We should be so lucky to have more film actors like him.  And Gail Russell matches him word for word, emotion for emotion.  A FIVE STAR TREAT!",1135209600,21,1687,4.495081967213115
2414748,5,B000BDH6DU,"Randolph Scott and director Budd Boetticher enjoyed a great partnership making some of the best westerns of the late 50s and early 60s, and Seven Men From Now was their first and greatest collaboration.

In the film Scott plays an embittered ex-sheriff who is searching for the seven men who murdered his wife during a Wells Fargo holdup. On the trail of the killers, Scott runs into a Eastern couple heading west. Recognizing their inexperience with life on the trail, he reluctantly tags along. At the same time, Scott crosses paths with Lee Marvin, playing a outlaw that Scott had arrested while a lawman.

The film sets up the pattern that would be a successful archetype for Scott and Boetticher - a likable, but morally desperate and revenge minded hero, a woman who is beautiful, and who Scott can't afford to love, villains that are particularly despicable, and other villains who are not nice people, but who are strangely engaging, if not sympathetic.

It is great news that this film has finally be restored and released on DVD. One can only hope that other great Scott/Boetticher films such as The Tall T, Comanche Station, Westbound, and Ride Lonesome are also released soon.",1135209600,5,1188,4.871287128712871
2414749,4,B000BDH6DU,"Ben Stride (Randolph Scott) is a former sheriff who's now obsessed with getting revenge on the seven men who murdered his wife after stealing money from the Wells Fargo company. On the way he meets up with a married couple, John and Annie Greer, from the East who're on their way to California to start a new life. He can easily see that these helpess city slickers haven't got a chance without his help, so he rides alongside their wagon and helps them out of several dangerous situations. Of course, he can't help but realize how beautiful Annie Greer (Gail Russell) is, and he finds himself falling for her.

Over time, Stride realizes that Annie is attracted to him, and Annie's husband John is a wimp. While heading for California, the trio meet up with two riders, one being Bill Masters (Lee Marvin), a gunman who's been put behind bars twice already by Stride in the past. After a few tense days of riding together, Stride sends Bill and the other guy away and continues on alone with Mr. and Mrs. Greer. But when he finds out what John Greer's been hired to do, it forces Stride to confront the men who murdered his wife, as well as have a showdown with Bill Masters. Only one man will survive the carnage that results...

Beautifully filmed in ""Warnercolor"", this formulaic Randolph Scott western is greatly aided by the casting of beautiful Gail Russell, whose career was unfortunately fizzling out at the time due to alcoholism, as well as Lee Marvin, who always played the cool villian to perfection. Sadly, Gail Russell died only five years after this movie was released, from an alcohol induced heart attack. She was only 36 years old. This obscure western was ""lost"" for many years until it was restored by UCLA in 2000. Now available in a superb special edition DVD that's loaded with bonus features, it'll make a great addittion to anyone's western collection. Highly recommended.",1135123200,17,1898,4.731117824773414
2414750,5,B000BDH6DU,I was fortunate enough to watch this at a special screening with Budd Boetticher in attendance.  It's a moment I will remember for the rest of my life.  If the intro to the film doesn't get you excited I don't know what will.  This along with The Tall T are his greatest movies.  Please if you get a chance to see a Boetticher film do so.

2414752,5,B000BDH6DU,"I'm giving this film 5 stars and I've never even seen it! Everything I've ever read about it indicates  that it is one of Randolph's & Boetticher's best. I really hope a quality DVD is released for this movie and I hope it happens before I die! I also agree with the other review about ""The Tall T"", ""Comanche Station"", ""Ride Lonesome"", ""Westbound"",""Ride The High Country"" and all the rest of the westerns that Randolph & Joel McCrea & Audie Murphy did, need to be released on DVD, with the quality & widescreen format of the original technicolor they were filmed with. Even though I've seen most of their movies, I've never seen them the way they're supposed to be seen and I often wonder if I ever will. Now that I've got one of these big, widescreen T.V.s, it would just be fantastic to see Randolph or Joel or Audie ridin' across one end of my living room, oh man, I can just smell the horse sweat now!

2414753,5,B000BDH6DU,"SEVEN MEN FROM NOW is a remarkable Randolph Scott Western, and this announced release is equally remarkable---for a number of reasons. Randy Scott, by the mid-1950s, had pretty much---at least so the critics thought---reached the end of what was a respectable career in acting (mostly in action dramas and largely, since 1946, in ""super B"" Westerns). This Batjac production, directed superbly by Budd Boetticher (Andrew McLaglen was the producer), signaled an incredible ""Indian summer"" for Scott, the high point in his career. Over the next 5 or 6 years, from 1956 until his final, Sam Peckinpah-directed classic RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY (co-starring with Joel McCrea), Scott would star in a series of absolutely first-rate little Westerns that would prove the critics wrong, and firmly establish Randolph Scott as one of the finest Western actors of all time.

SEVEN MEN FROM NOW has never been released on commercial video; a few ""private"" releases have circulated, but never in really good picture quality and never widely available. This announced release, then, is of great importance well beyond the Western genre: it will offer not just Western movie fans and Scott fans a good opportunity to actually ""see"" the movie as it was released, but it will enable all moviegoers a chance to see, in the comfort of their own homes, a real classic in moviemaking for the first time in almost forty years.

Within this past year Scott's earlier vehicle, ALBUQUERQUE, was released on DVD. It was thought by many, including some film historians, that that film had been lost. Instead, it turned up on a fine DVD issue, in its original (and good-looking) Cinecolor release. Now SEVEN MEN FROM NOW will be appearing, and there is additional reason for joy.

There should be no hesitation by anyone: SEVEN MEN FROM NOW is a classic, and should be in everyone's collection.",1123977600,144,1862,5.019417475728155

It's a western and it stars a whole slew of folks - for example Gail Russell, Lee Marvin, Walter Reed, and of course Randolph Scott. Directed by Budd Boetticher and produced by John Wayne (Batjac Productions). Somehow it wound up in Batjac Productions archives and sat there. I am glad it was finally released and cleaned up. Also it is in widescreen (great for 16:9 TVs) and most important - English subtitles for those of us with poor hearing. Region 1 NTSC.  1956, 78 mins long.  The storyline is typical for a western. Ex-lawman Ben Striker (Randolph Scott)  is on the hunt for 7 men, who robbed a Wells Fargo freight station of $20,000, killing a clerk in the process. The clerk was Striker's wife. Well, that's enough of that. For the price of this movie, you can't go wrong. Heck, it is worth 3 times as much. It is a great movie, the country side where it is film is beautiful, Gail Russell is glamorous as always, the picture is pristine, One can't go wrong even when ordering twice.

I've seen this movie twice and, both times, I was captivated; it has several twists and turns which make it unpredictable, but it's the characters that make this movie stellar. My favorite scenes were the ones with Ben Stride (Randolph Scott) and Annie Greer (Gail Russell), especially the tender love scene where Ben is lying under the wagon and under Annie as well. Also, there's a moment when you expect Ben to take Annie into his arms and kiss her (that would have been predictable!), but he changes his mind at the last second. Even the brief look between Annie and Ben when they first meet was electric.

I also thought it was a wonderful piece of characterization that Ben Stride hated violence. Watch the way he's so relieved when the Chiricahua take the horse instead of fighting, or the way he finds it disgraceful how the U.S. Calvary is treating them. Or, when he kills Masters (Lee Marvin) and sits on the rock so dejectedly.

Finally, the score is really good; it makes the movie feel operatic.",1453852800,,1020,4.687150837988827

Well, here he is along with Lee Marvin in a sensational western adventure filmed originally as a 'B' movie by Batjac Productions, John Wayne's company.  Many thought that 58 year old Scott was finished until this movie was made.  Scott plays a sheriff whose wife is killed by seven robbers.  He sets out to find them.  Sounds like something you have seen before.  Not like this one. The story twists and turns on each character's thoughts and deeds, never to what you expect.

I love all things Gail Russell, but unlike some of her other flicks, this is actually a good movie. There is a coherent plot, good continuity through out, decent acting skills displayed, interesting desert scenery, and believable ""cowboy skills"" exhibited by Randolph Scott. I especially liked Lee Marvin in his role as the main antagonist to Scott's laconic hero. Granted, this one of his early efforts and his skill as an actor  would be honed sharper in later offerings. In this character he managed to elicit feeling of both disappointment in his evil ways and some regret when his character is killed in a gun fight with Scott's character. I would have like to see Gail Russell in ALL the scenes but she is believable in her role as an eastern lady burdened by a loser husband and the challenges of her westward migration.

2414816,5,B000BDH6DU,"The 1950s was a golden decade for the Western. Aside from seminal `A' list works from the likes of Fred Zinnemann (High Noon), George Stevens (Shane), John Ford (The Searchers) and Howard Hawks (Rio Bravo), two cycles of `B' list Westerns stand out in terms of quality and importance in developing the genre. The first was the cycle of five made by Anthony Mann with Jimmy Stewart while the second was a cycle of seven made by Budd Boetticher with Randolph Scott. Taken together these two cycles span an exact decade. Mann's first Stewart Western was Winchester '73 made in 1950, his last The Man from Laramie made in 1955. Boetticher's first Scott Western was 7 Men from Now made in 1956 and his last Comanche Station made in 1960. 7 Men from Now is often described as part of the `Ranown Cycle' of Westerns (the products of a company set up by Randolph Scott and producer Harry Joe Brown). This is incorrect however, the film emanating from Batjac, a company part-owned by John Wayne. The Ranown Cycle didn't begin until Decision at Sundown the following year. In terms of contributing to the Western as an art form however, it is best to remember 7 Men from Now as the first of four marvelous Boetticher/Scott films scripted by Burt Kennedy. Along with The Tall T (1957), Ride Lonesome (1959), and Comanche Station (1960) the four films mark a true high point in the genre, the intelligent scripting and the unfussy, no-nonsense direction making for a series of well-acted, fast-moving and exciting narratives (none more than 80 minutes long) which develop the revisionist thinking in the Western which had been announced so clearly in High Noon back in 1952 and which would lead eventually into the Vietnam War era bloodbaths of Robert Aldrich (Ulzana's Raid) and Sam Peckinpah (The Wild Bunch).

High Noon is often spoken of as a `classic' Western, but its riposte to the McCarthy witch-hunts and its possible allegory on the Korean War paints a picture of a divided America where the people run scared and desert their man and their town (their country) in his (in America's) hour of need. This is a negative picture of the nation very different from the one painted by traditional `classic' Westerns (My Darling Clementine, Red River, Wagon Master and Shane) where creation mythology is celebrated (commemorated even) as an overwhelming positive as a `great' nation is forged. The rise of fascism in Europe and the resulting world war necessitated a perpetuation of this positive image, but in the 50s the American Dream began to sour as the country fell under the grip of anti-communist paranoia, McCarthyist witch-hunting, the fear of nuclear apocalypse and the first stirrings of civil rights-related social unrest. People became unsure of their country and their fellow countrymen, a pessimism reflected in many Westerns of the time. Mann established the pattern of the dark revenge Western with Stewart playing lead characters who are all morally ambiguous, outwardly honorable but driven by inner demons created by the frustrations of frontier life (re life in 50s America?). Even Gary Cooper's squeaky clean morally unimpeachable Will Kane image was dragged through the mud by Mann in 1958 in the wonderful Man of the West where he plays an ex-outlaw reverting back to old ways. Burt Kennedy caught this revisionist zeitgeist and all his Boetticher scripts feature virtually the same revenge story, but with Randolph Scott being much older than Stewart, he was invariably cast as a widower hunting down the dastardly villains who killed his wife. Scott is never cast as the villain, but his vigilante taking of the law into his own hands poses obvious moral ambiguities and he is never the happy hero. Grim and determined with never a smile on his face, he exacts his revenge, but is never left completely satisfied. According to Kennedy/Boetticher life is an endless struggle with no happiness existing without clouds, mushroom-shaped ones of course, in the context of the 50s. When the positive (arguably McCarthyist) Rio Bravo came out in 1959 it was seen as right wing reactionary, especially as the country was then sliding further and further into the quagmire that was Vietnam. Perhaps the real mood of the times had been caught most acutely of all in 1956 by John Ford's searing depiction of racism on the frontier in the greatest revenge Western of them all, The Searchers. Made in the same year, Boetticher and Kennedy's 7 Men from Now may seem simpler, possessing as it does little of that film's racist fury, but it nevertheless paints an equally grim image of an unstable, divided America albeit on a smaller scale and with a single covered wagon serving as a metaphor for a nation ridden with doubt.

7 Men from Now's main text is the simple revenge story of Ben Stride (Scott) whose wife had been shot dead during a $20,000 gold robbery at a Wells Fargo railway depot in a place called Silver Springs, New Mexico. Stride picks up the tracks of the seven robbers which lead due south to the Mexican border and a place called Flora Vista. The film starts off with two of them being picked off in a thunderstorm and finishes all very predictably in a canyon gunfight just outside the border town. The beauty of the film lies not so much in the repetition of a formula which even by 1956 was pretty well-worn, as in the journey Stride takes and the people he meets on the way. The morning following his first killings, Stride happens across a covered wagon stuck in the mud. Western lovers will know the symbolic significance of covered wagons, Ford having commemorated the wagon train part of creation mythology back in Wagon Master (1950). America was created by covered wagons migrating westwards so that people could create new lives and form new communities. Central to this mythology were the plucky migrants, the practical worldly-wise patriarchs protecting their wives, the proverbial domestic hearths at the center of all civilization. Their strong partnership created the safe environment for their children (for a new America) to grow up and prosper. Boetticher/Kennedy parody this myth in true revisionist style in this film. They give us a wagon train consisting of one wagon which is first seen stuck in the mud! The ""worldly-wise patriarch"" turns out to be a half-man greenhorn from the east named John Greer (a fine study in male impotence by Walter Reed) who can't protect his wife Annie (a very refined Gail Russell) who is left exposed and vulnerable to all takers. Children (any promise for the future) are noted by their absence. Stride helps them out of their mud hole, but having been introduced to us as a killer with his motive yet to be explained, he is at first a threat to the Greers every bit as much as a help. They happen to all be going south and Stride reluctantly escorts his two would-be settlers as far as a stagecoach relay station where they meet two shady outlaw characters, Bill Masters (Lee Marvin) and Clete (Don Barry) who are also south-bound. This is Chiricahua Apache territory and Annie plays mother (cooking and pouring coffee) to a mysterious gunman out for revenge, a dead beat useless husband and two scary outlaw figures while the Indians call to each other in the surrounding rocky desert with the threat of instant annihilation - Such is the nature of ""the hearth at the center of civilization"" (the state of America) according to Boetticher/Kennedy!

The film's muscle comes from Kennedy's marvelous tersely economic script with barely a word without pertinent meaning which contrasts the members of his group to terrific psychological effect. He is helped by some mighty fine acting, Marvin especially reveling in insolent sarcasm as he cuts ""half man"" Greer down mainly by pointing out to all the obvious love chemistry simmering between Stride (Scott all bottled-up indignity at his imputance) and Annie (Russell, embarrassed but determined to remain in control of herself). The night scene in the rain which ends with Stride punching Masters out is the focal point, the very center of the film. Masters rides off and Annie is safe. But is she? Just how honorable is Ben Stride? Sure, this is still the 50s and the hero can't commit adultery with the husband still around especially if he's played by Randolph Scott who carries the image of 'respectibility' with him. But the scene where he goes to sleep under the wagon immediately beneath where Annie is sleeping and where they get to whisper sweet good nothings to each other while husband John is presumably within earshot, all suggest radical things are a'stirring there on the frontier and that Annie's domestic hearth isn't so innocent and Stride isn't so 'honorable' after all. Boetticher/Kennedy don't parody Scott's image as much as Mann does Cooper's in Man of the West, but the initimations are undeniably there all the same.

The film plays out in a small area of the south west (actually California) which Boetticher would make his own over the next seven films and the journey from comparative greenery where Stride meets the Greers to the final rocky canyon is comparable in style and effect to a similar journey at the center of Mann's Man of the West. Fine cinematography from William H. Clothier (who shot Westerns for Ford and Hawks and was Wayne's choice for The Alamo) charts the gradual shift in psychological tensions as all the characters (Stride, Masters and Bodeen, the head of the robber band finely played by John Larch who they finally catch up with) converge on the gold. Combine this with the Mexican edge of Robert Aldrich's Vera Cruz (another chase for gold made in the same year) and we have the ingredients for a spaghetti Western - Sergio Leone's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) springing to mind most obviously. The action scenes are very well-handled, potent with a tangible edge of excitement, largely because we have been so skillfully introduced to the characters. Randolph Scott and Lee Marvin in particular seize their roles with aplomb and help Boetticher towards making what is in total a very fine revisionist revenge Western. A 'B' list Western this may be, but it merits an 'A' as a beautiful work of art. Highly recommended.

This Paramount DVD is very well presented, the pictures (aspect ratio 16:9) firm and beautiful and the sound fine enough. I notice that a splendid Boetticher box set used to be available in the US (but not in the UK) with all the Kennedy films offered together. That would have been the best way to buy this film, but alas, the set looks like it has been deleted. The films are all available individually and are mandatory for inclusion in any Western collection.",1424649600,,10678,4.877753303964758

2414827,5,B000BDH6DU,"This is a great Western! Of course, I'm a life-long Randy Scott fan. This quick-paced romp through the American southwest turns into a thriller presenting a retired Sheriff chasing down seven outlaws who killed his wife during a robbery. Scott, Russell, Marvin, and the whole cast give stellar performances. One of the most interesting aspect of this gripping drama is the cinematography (no telephoto lenses are use here). There are breath-taking panorama views, up-close cameos, and cool stunt angles. Watch, from below, for bad guys coming after the Sheriff jumping from high rocks to high rocks, (hands full of Winchesters and colts to balance leaps) with the sky-above background, a horse-dragging a cowboy across the long far away prairie, and Marvin taking Scott's faster-than-the-eye gun-draw. There's lots of gun-smoke, dust, mud, sweat, wind, torrential rains, and silent dialogue like one would expect to see on the Frontier. Just Great! And, as usual, Randolph Scott doesn't kiss the girl (too sissy lip-locking is, I guess). The extras on this DVD are also very interesting. ""7 Men"" is a great flick and worth a watch.",1411171200,,1131,5.185792349726776

2414831,5,B000BDH6DU,"What a joy to see the most abused classic western when shown on TV in color or black-and-white 50 years later! Television always chopped this modest story into a 2 hour slot but by doing so did a tremendous disservice to the artistry of Budd Boetticher in directing this superb western, written by Burt Kennedy and his team of western connoisseurs of horse handlers to cinematographers of the western landscape who make it look un-trampled, sparsely inhabited so much that it sticks in your mind long after the story reaches its climax.  Randolph Scott stars as a stoic, simmering-to-boil, almost inhuman loner in a cast of western characters, soon-to-be stars like Lee Marvin, Stewart Whitman, Don ""Red"" Barry,(had his own show) John Larch and the eye-pleasing Gail Russell. The restoration of this film is exceptional enhancing the purples and blues against the stony, adobe marbled landscape to such appeal that the action never seems to lag while you thrill to the scenery. The on-location cinematography in the final shoot-out is so remarkable you feel at times beside Randolph Scott as he scurries like a snake to avoid the bullets. Then you realize at the finish when you check your watch and realize you were not slumbering close to 2 hours, you are seeing a classic that ranks with ""Shane."" Next to the vivid photography, the spare script sparkles and bristles with such authenticity you catch all the subtleties of derision, insult or vulgar insinuation by the characters. Until the end you wonder who the villains are and the innocent which adds to the tension. I would say the script rivals those written by Elmore Leonard, which is high praise. Although made in 1956, there are elements of feminism,(the saloon girls are diverse) role-changing due to loss of job and gender expectations that are subtly woven into the script. When one of the characters has his masculinity questioned, he leaves no doubt by paying the ultimate price. This film will rise in fame when those, like me, see this uncut gem and realize what a diamond it is.",1405900800,,2048,4.902017291066282

2414842,5,B000BDH6DU,"...for not making this Western with himself in the lead.
Now it seems there was some sort of ""friendly?"" rivalry between Wayne & Scott when they made THE SPOILERS and PITTSBURGH and since this (7 MEN...) was a Wayne BATJAC property, the Duke, involved with THE SEARCHERS and other projects letting this one fly to Scott (because he was washed up) was a BIG!!!!!! mistake.
Audiences loved the preview showing, and the Duke always regretted not making this one starring himself. 7 MEN FROM NOW raked in the big bucks for a minimal investment and $$$ savy Scott tied in director Boetticher and screen writer Kennedy to a multi-film deal which resulted in a series of the best made Westerns ever (THE TALL T, COMMANCHE STATION, RIDE LONESOME, etc...),collectively.

...and 7 MEN FROM NOW may be the best of the lot.
Rugged, realistic, graphic. Upon release it must have seemed something special with it's clever, witty throw-a-away dialogue and scenes of harsh brutality, pushing the Western envelope to new standards.
Lee Marvin steals the show, and Scott lets him. Marvin has all the best lines and scenes, even in the gunfight climax. We, the viewer, along with Scott, agonize over the outcome.

Splendid, minimalist plotting and set design...Lone Pine, that's pretty much it. It's all in the dialogue (especially a couple great scenes with Marvin & Scott) and in the action set amid visual splendor. And all in beautiful Technicolor!

It DOES NOT get any better than this for Western action fans of the 1950s. And the Paramount dvd looks just fantastic!!!
Great color, great audio, a dream come true for a Western that could easily slip into anyone's TOP 10 Westerns ever made.

2414865,4,B000BDH6DU,"But two of them come close to magnificence - one is the Sheriff and one is a varmint.  It's an old movie, obviously, but one that is entertaining,  has an interesting story line, and spectacular photography of the Arizona landscapes.

Stuart Whitman makes a cameo appearance as the young Cavalry officer, and surely was one of his first parts.

Randolph Scott rides again as the laconic ex-Sheriff from Silver Springs in search of a gang of renegades that are now on the run after holding up the Wells Fargo there.  One person was killed during the heist.  This person is an important part of the plot, but we never get to see the face and it won't do to tell all at this point.  Suffice it to say all of the characters are connected by an invisible thread, and few of them know exactly how or why.  The Sheriff is on a man hunt, but has the misfortune to run afoul of a lone Conestoga wagon that is having trouble in a creek fording with an exhausted team and a pitifully inexperienced driver.  Fate or misfortune aside, he decides he can't leave these two helpless people, a man and a woman, alone in Apache country so he agrees reluctantly to ride along with them until the wagon trail forks to the West.  He doesn't stop to try to understand tenderfoot foolishness; so the wagon being far afield and all alone doesn't concern him as much as it should have.

Lee Marvin is splendid as usual in his role as Masters, a real rogue who possesses a measure of tarnished integrity, but with an axe to grind with someone he respects as well as dislikes.  Marvin possessed the true ability to elevate a movie even though he was seldom the leading man;  he added a measure of star power to everything he did.  It is apparent that he and Randolph know each other, and little clues as to just how they do emerge periodically.  They are all enroute to the ""fork in the trails"" with different destinations (and agendas) in mind - the South Fork leads to the Border Town and either an escape to Mexico or a showdown over the Wells Fargo strong box;  the West Fork would lead the immigrant family to California and a steady life if they manage to evade Indian trouble.

While it didn't win any Academy awards, it's a good evening's entertainment if you appreciate Western themes but want a solid plot without too much unbelievable hokey thrown in sideways to ruin it.",1330214400,,2355,4.464953271028038

2414874,5,B000BDH6DU,"In a brief span of four years, from 1956 to 1960, Director Budd Boetticher, writer Burt Kennedy and actor Randolph Scott collaborated on a series of seven ""chamber westerns"" which rank as one of the most rewarding achievements in the art of American Cinema.

While a number of prominent film critics, historians and luminaries have rightly praised the ""Ranown"" series (named after Boetticher's production company), attention is often paid to the fact that Boetticher produced the series on a shoestring budget.  Thus, despite praise, the series and Boetticher himself are relegated to a second tier, ""B"" level, as if the monies poured into these films somehow affect and dictate their intrinsic value.

To the contrary, the Boetticher/Kennedy/Scott westerns are in every way equal to the larger budgeted collaborations of Ford and Wayne, Daves and Ford, Leone and Eastwood.

With these sparse, psychologically complex works, Boetticher did as much for the American western as Val Lewton did for the American Horror film in the 40's.

The breakthrough Seven Men From Now (1956) was a long way from Ken Maynard's white hat and bottle of milk atop a horse named Tarzan. It's also far more aesthetically modernist, more taut, more complexly developed in character than the later, ultra-stylish westerns of Peckinpah and Leone (the exception being Peckinpah's slightly overrated Ride the High Country, also starring Randolph Scott with Joel McCrea). Very few films in the genre can boast as richly developed characterizations. The Delmer Daves/Glenn Ford films along with the Anthony Mann/James Stewart cannon can arguably be mentioned in the same breath.

Seven Men From Now establishes Boetticher's Ranown canvas. Randolph Scott was an actor of beautiful limitations and the director utilized Scott's mere presence to compositional advantage.  The actor's weathered face parallels the expressionistic, Cezanne-like rocky terrains.  Boetticher takes equal advantage of his hero's range to etch a morally ambiguous personification.

Scott, out for revenge, seems, at first, to personify the mythological old west code of right and wrong.  He is ancient, laconic, sips coffee, and projects a virtuous nobility with a mere shifting of the eyes.  That is until his foil, Lee Marvin (superb here) astutely recalls how Scott had no qualms about stealing a friend's wife.  Even Walter Reed, as Gail Russell's weak, cowardly husband, surprises in an act of redemption. The power in the Boetticher films lies in the riveting conversations and in a shrewd slicing of viewer expectations.  There is a disconcerting, hushed quality throughout the film, even in those conversations, which project a tense, quiescent air of revelation.

I am a pretty big fan of Westerns, but was not familiar with Budd Boetticher's movies. He directs in a different style than other Westerns (slow build up of the plot, sparse dialog, and understated hero), but it really works well. I think the cast is what really makes the difference. Randolph Scott is strong as the rather stoic hero, and Lee Marvin is excellent in his role. You are not sure if you like him or not, until the very end of the film.

2414878,5,B000BDH6DU,"This first teaming of star Randolph Scott & director Budd Boetticher also finds them working from a script by Burt Kennedy - his very first screenplay, and impressive enough that he worked with this team three more times, eventually moving on to a prolific - if not quite exciting - directorial career himself.

All the elements are in place: the lone, upright and indomitable man, with the tragic past and a taste for vengeance that keeps him going against all odds...a woman, no freer than he but just as determined, in her own way....her weak husband, prey to the villains that made off with the gold....a charismatic nemesis who may or may not be one of the killers that the hero has vowed vengeance on....seven bad men who must be brought to justice - his kind of justice.

OK that makes it sound hokey, but let's face it an awful lot of westerns sound that way if you reduce them to basics. What makes this one stand out? The terrific widescreen color photography (by William Clothier) and Boetticher's exquisite framing and graceful camera movements -- little rapid cutting here, no scenes that don't play out as long as they need to, and yet the whole comes in at a perfect 78 minutes. The subtle sexual nuances between ex-sheriff Ben Stride (Scott) and strong-willed Annie Greer (Gail Russell) who Stride has joined with and is helping out - despite the presence of her weak husband John (Walter Reed)...the fabulous performance of Lee Marvin as Bill Masters, a likable rogue who may or may not be involved in the crime that took Stride's wife, the participants in which he will hunt down unto death.

Boetticher does a lot with a smallish budget and the 50s standards of what you could show; his first action sequence is a tense little moment under a rock with Stride coming upon two men in the rain and stopping for coffee with them, until he finds out....and then we cut away as the shots ring out. The tension is built and released, and we really don't need to see the same standard gun play in every scene - so he doesn't give it to us. We have off-screen shots, quick cutaways between shooters, a reaction shot or two of victims without seeing the shots fired, a dynamic use of space in the many canyon sequences leads to odd angles and unpredictable shots -- really he does more with the few gunfights in this film than many directors did in whole careers.

The characters, too, are beautifully developed from small nuances. Scott, typically, is the strong and stoic type, but the sexual tension expressed in all the early scenes between him and Russell is extraordinarily powerful with just an eyebrow, a smile communicating all we need. Marvin, too, is attracted to the sole female in this male world (apart from a very brief bar scene) but his is a predatory view, albeit couched in a touch of civility. His flamboyant dress, flip attitude, and egotism pretty much steal the show and make his final standoff with our hero all the more memorable, because we actually care at least a little about him.

In the end, the hero must go it alone, and whether he prevails or not, and whether the woman he has come to love will be free - and willing - to meet him if he does survive the last showdown -- all that I will not reveal. See it for yourself, it's easily one of the best westerns of the 50s and a great start to a series of films that continued on a remarkably high level.",1259971200,2,3392,4.5359477124183005

He is somewhat of the same stoic cowboy style as Clint Eastwood.  Scott has some great one liners through out the movie, like when the young cavalry comander recomends Scott move on as the indians are on the warpath, Scott says, ""Its worse than that-they are hungry.""  One different effect among many is that you see Scott go for his gun but you never see him shoot someone.  In this movie Scott plays a X-lawman who hunts down bandits who killed his wife.

2414882,3,B000BDH6DU,"Like McCrea, Scott did not become exclusively a Westerner until the mid-forties, but once established he became a Western star of distinction, achieving his best and most interesting roles as his career matured...

Scott was a great gentleman... It was simple for him to do the part because it was indeed the prime quality he brought to his many roles as lawman or lone rider... Scott's best work was the group of seven movies he made with director Budd Boetticher in the fifties...In these he obtained a new stature as the lone figure on a mission of vengeance or similar private quest, becoming a tougher, more forceful character, the archetype of the much-parodied image... As we all know, a man's actions are what make the man, and over and over again, Scott believed in courage... He believed in conspicuous displays of courage... And finally he rounded off this splendid climax to a long career by starring with Joel McCrea in ""Ride the High Country.""

Boetticher's style was marvelously simple and economical, sticking closely to the same plots, locations and character types in each of his Westerns and stressing movement and action rather than ideas...

Budd Boetticher's ""Seven Men From Now"" is 78 minutes... And as concise as this great Western is, it has four really well-developed characters traveling through Apache country; beautiful storytelling; takes full advantage of the location; and there are a lot of narrative incidents...

Ben Stride (Scott) represents a man whose wife has been killed and he's going to go out and seek revenge... But his style is ramrod straight and not very interesting... The killers that Stride is after are all opportunists... They are men who had broken the law... Boetticher introduces a sympathetic bad man, Bill Masters (Lee Marvin) who had been put in jail twice by the ex-Sheriff... But you get the sense that Masters wouldn't kill a woman... That's not what he has in mind... But, surely, he wants the $20,000 in gold from the strongbox... Ultimately, he had to test himself up against Ben Stride in the final confrontation: the stronger villain against the stronger hero...

Lee Marvin stole the show... He had all the little tricks, and twitches, and schemes... He is magnetic, especially in one key scene on that stormy night, when he gets inside the covered wagon, asking for a cup of hot black coffee...Tension mounts when he tells John Greer (Walter Reed) that his wife is beautiful... He wanted to get on Stride's nerves... And some tension grew between the three characters...

Annie Greer (Gail Russell) was the object of desire... She was wonderful foil, essential, torn between two men... Obviously her character quite quickly falls for Scott's character... Her husband--who seems weak--turns out to be stronger than we thought... Stride let his own life down because he was too proud... We hear him says: ""A man ought to be able to take care of his woman."" This is the line that's submitted to a test by the whole action and script and direction of the movie...

One last note: Without sacrificing any of the traditional action elements, there was somehow an extra dimension to the Boetticher Westerns; they had a biting, underplayed quality, the kind of films one would have expected had John Huston (in his prime) suddenly decided to become a director of Westerns...",1234224000,17,3334,4.96415770609319

If you don't like westerns, this probably won't change your mind but if you're at all interested, this is worth watching for the complexity of the characters as well as some beautiful western background. Lee Marvin is a cool, cold blooded character like the kind he became known for. Randolph Scott is the somewhat detached ex-sheriff hunting for the seven men who held up Wells Fargo and killed his wife, an innocent bystander. Along the way he helps Gail Russell and Walter Reed, a married couple trying to get to California. Everything is not as it seems with them, also. When Lee Marvin and his sidekick join the trio, the tension mounts as you discover there was a past relationship between Marvin and Scott that still smolders.

2414884,5,B000BDH6DU,"Back in the 1950s and early 1960s, Randolph Scott and director Budd Boetticher made a series of low budget westerns that are now considered classics of the genre.  This 1956 release was the first of them.

The screenplay by Burt Kennedy has Scott playing a former sheriff who is hunting down the seven Wells Fargo bandits who killed his wife during a robbery.  Following their trail, he encounters a struggling, California-bound pioneering couple (Gail Russell, Walter Reed) who he helps, and also ruffians Lee Marvin and Donald Barry.

Lee and Donald join the group, hoping to help Scott catch the outlaws, then they plan to keep the stolen money for themselves.

Shot in Lone Pine, California, this gem contains some good action sequences, strong characters, terse dialogue and a surprise story twist.

The Paramount release is part of the Batjac catalogue and, as such, it contains plenty of extras, including a beautifully restored print, a lengthy and quite fascinating documentary about Boetticher and the films he made with Scott, a featurette about Lone Pine and also one on Ms. Russell.

2414885,3,B000BDH6DU,"In August 2001 I had the great pleasure of attending a theater screening of ""Seven Men From Now"" at the Nickelodeon Theater in Santa Cruz, CA.  Long-time supporting actor Walter Reed, the hapless husband making an ill-advised wagon train trek in this film, was the guest of honor.  Mr. Reed, not in the best of health, was conveyed to the theater by horse and wagon and attended by the P.E. teacher and friend who had taken charge of his physical rehabilitation in recent years after WR had suffered the loss of his wife and some physical problems.  Director Bud Boetticher was also invited but was too unwell to attend; he did sit for an interview about ""Seven Men"" at his home and this was recorded and played for the audience.

Special effort had been made to borrow the only projector in the county that could screen one of the original prints, and the color held up beautifully - I have to wonder if this print was used to make this DVD, given the favorable comments about the way it looks by those who've seen it in that format.  Certainly everyone who attended this screening wanted to know when a DVD would be available, but at that time no one had an answer.

This is not only a good western of it period, its an interesting instance where Scott played a man almost unbalanced by his guilt and desire for bloody revenge.  This is not the reflexively heroic Randolph Scott of so many of his films; its a more adult story altogether, and you really do feel its possible Scott will simply mow down all the men who've ruined his life without a thought for his own survival.  He is a force of nature, an aging good man who sees only sorrow, grief, and loneliness in store for his remaining years.

It was, and will probably remain, my only instance of seeing Scott on the big screen, and it illustrated for me why my grandparents loved him so; he was an iconic figure in grand, beautiful landscapes, a sight burned into my memory.  Well-mounted and a graceful horseman, he emanated a quiet but steely resolve that seemed to soften and bend to a woman in trouble but could quickly whiplash into vicious cruelty at the first sight of one of his intended targets.

The Q and A session with Mr. Reed after the film ended was a delight.  He told stories about this particular movie, gave an overview of his career as a character actor under the old studio system, and related a story about a time when he and his wife and the Boettichers were all strapped for cash and work.  Deciding to have a rare fling to lift their spirits by going out for a dinner they really couldn't afford, they made a night of it and spotted John Wayne in the same restaurant.  He stopped by for a few polite greetings but it was Reed's opinion that Wayne knew they'd been out of work for too long; he left before they did and when they asked for their bill they were informed that Mr. Wayne had paid for all.

On arriving for this showing I was a little concerned that the crowd would be all people a couple of generations younger than Mr. Reed.  And that it would seem to him looking out at the audience that he had outlived his own best movie fans.  Instead arrangements had been made at a local retirement community to transport anyone who wanted to attend to the theater, and at least 1/3 of the audience were of Mr. Reed's generation.  And they knew their movies too!  Some great questions and comments came from that bunch, who certainly had far more in-depth things to say about his other film work than someone my age would have ever known to put forth.  Topping off the ceremonies Walter Reed put his handprints in wet concrete outside of the Nickelodeon theater and wrote his name, the date, and, ""Boy actor"" beside it.

Its still there, but he's gone.  Walter Reed died just 13 days after he attended this screening in his honor.  His old friend and director Bud Boetticher died just three months later.  Belated kudos to all who worked so hard to arrange this screening, and this last hurrah for a working actor and regular guy.  For a few hours he was young again, he had an audience again, and that's not a bad way to go out.

2414891,5,B000BDH6DU,"Last night I sat and watched SEVEN MEN FROM NOW.  Just been released after a long absence. Randolph Scott, always good. Very stoic hero, with little to say but a good screen presence. Lee Marvin, playing his usual tricky character. Other bad guy was John Larch. The female character was played by Gail Russell. Very understated performance by a very attractive actress. Scott played his usual character of a man on a quest for vengeance against the men who killed his wife during a robbery.

Script was by Burt Kennedy. A good, literate script with some telling lines. Directed by Budd Boetticher. Some fabulous scenery. Desert and semi-mountain backgrounds. By contrast some lush locations too. Flawless photography.

Made in 1956. It runs for 78 minutes, but every one of those short minutes is worth it.

I'd spent a busy afternoon at the keyboard, so mug of coffee in hand I settled down and thoroughly enjoyed the movie. A great way to unwind. Highly recommended. This is how a Western should be made.

2414892,4,B000BDH6DU,"There's something to be said for tweaking the formula jest a tad. This Western has the usual characters, the usual settings and motives. But the writer Burt Kennedy changed things around so I could not manage to predict anything but the ultimate outcome. Then director Budd Boetticher and crew packaged it with fine visuals.

Randolph Scott takes John Wayne's place in this Wayne production and I much prefer him. While limited in range, he's a better actor. He just doesn't have Wayne's outsized persona. Wayne would win in the end because that's what Wayne the Icon was 'posed to do. Scott would win because that's what his character would do.

Gail Russell was an affecting presence in a couple ways. It was sad to see how much she aged (she was only about 32 years old), and to realize that in about 5 years she would be gone. She retained some of her prettiness and gained as an actress, giving her character warmth, intelligence and grace.

And there was a gen-nu-wine thief in the cast -- a stealer of scenes. He was the young Lee Marvin. Without Wayne's potbelly to contend with, Marvin's deep voice, cocky manner and looming size pretty much let him have his way with the film. It wouldn't have been as good without him.

Of course, Boetticher's direction deserves credit, but Lee Marvin's persistence, Randolph Scott's stoic nervousness, and Gail Russell's absolutely incredible body language combine to take Boetticher's best western film to another level in a quick four minutes.  In the same scene shot inside the wagon train, while Marvin continues his useless pursuit of Russell by goading Scott about his past, Scott also delivers one of his single best lines ever in a sharp retort to Marvin: ""Seems there aint' nobody don't remind you of somebody tonight"".

Special footnote, George Randolph Scott better known as Randolph Scott, was an American film actor whose career spanned the sound era from the late 1920s to the early 1960s ... his popularity grew in the 1940s and 1950s, appearing in such films as ""Gung Ho""! (1943) and ""Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm"" (1938); but he was especially famous for his numerous Westerns including ""Virginia City"" (1940) with Errol Flynn and Humphrey Bogart, ""Western Union"" (1941) with Robert Young and ""Ride the High Country"" (1962) with Joel McCrea (a coin was flipped to see whether Scott or McCrea would receive top billing, and Scott won despite having a slightly smaller role) ... his long fistfight with John Wayne in ""The Spoilers"" (1942) was frequently cited by critics and the press as the most thrilling ever filmed; they were fighting over Marlene Dietrich ... another smash hit film together that same year called ""Pittsburgh"" (1942) once again with Dietrich, Scott and Wayne --- Daniel Webster defines ""Legend"", as being a notable person, or the stories told about that person exploits --- well by the time Randolph Scott made his best films he had long established himself as a legend in the film industry --- they say practice makes perfect, if that is true by 1958 at 60 years of age he was the master with these oaters from the 50s ...

2414899,5,B000BDH6DU,"This is a superb movie - it takes the B Western format and gives it high production values and an intelligent adult theme.

Picture quality is excellent, presented in its correct aspect ratio (1.85:1) - enhanced for widescreen TVs.

Randolph Scott plays a former sheriff who blames himself for the death of his wife.  He had been too proud to accept a demotion to deputy sheriff, and therefore hadn't been there to protect his wife when she was killed by thugs robbing the town's bank.  He is now on a mission to kill the men responsible, while - at the same time - refusing to forgive himself.

Add a married woman, trying hard to deny the desire she feels for Scott.  Add her husband, driven by his own fears to side with the killers.  And you've got an explosive mix of emotions.

But that's not all.  There's also Lee Marvin in a superb performance as a badman willing, for the moment, to accompany Scott on his cold search for revenge.  But only until the time is right for the final showdown.

This is a film you must see.",1174694400,4,1028,4.414893617021277

2414902,5,B000BDH6DU,"In sum, a brilliant gem of a film. Yes, Randolph Scott starred in numerous so-called ""B-westerns"". But this one is several notches above that work. In fact, a case could be made that this is one of Scott's best -- rivaled only by Peckinpah's ""Ride the High Country"" and Boetticher's ""Ride Lonesome"". This is the first Scott/Boetticher film and I recommend them all!

This minimalist drama has an appeal that goes beyond the western genre. The story and characters ring true. The actors, particularly Scott and Russel, give credible performances that draw the viewer into the story.

The Technicolor print looks great and the sound is clear. The film commentary is actually interesting. And the extra features worth watching. Unfortunately, this release is NOT enhanced for 16x9. Other than that, this is really a top notch DVD release and well worth viewing. This is an excellent film! Randolph Scott rides again!

PS -- The image needs to be remastered from the original camera negative. This is a *brilliant* film which merits a Blu-ray upgrade. Remaster the sound to stereo if possible and port over the DVD extras to make a stellar release.",1166054400,11,1144,4.947916666666667

2414904,5,B000BDH6DU,"Budd Boetticher's classic 1956 western SEVEN MEN FROM NOW (Paramount) finally arrives on DVD in a clean, restored transfer with significant extras.  There's not a wasted frame or line in this wonderfully told and visualized tale.  Clean and spare, it lingers long in the mind after the final fade out.

Boetticher, a cult figure, makes the most of his simple story.  Randolph Scott, a sheriff haunted by the death of his wife in a robbery, hunts for the seven men responsible. Along the way, he helps a couple from Kansas heading west and is forced to deal with another former outlaw he had once sent to prison.  But it's not really the story that matters for Boetticher but the characters and dialogue and landscape.  In other words, it's a meditation on how we live while we travel on our paths of fate through vistas of light and shadow.  For me, it's a Zen western at its heart.

For movie buffs and film scholars alike, the late Budd Boetticher is a giant, widely praised for the seven simple westerns he made starring Randolph Scott between 1956 and 1960.

While working at Columbia Pictures, I got to know Boetticher quite well.  He liked a script I wrote and invited me to ride one of his fine horses, Peropo, a spirited, unscarred veteran from the Spanish bullring.  I apparently passed my test and this led to trips to Mexico where we scouted locations and Boetticher put on astonishing displays of how to fight bulls from horseback. During this time, I understood how much of Boetticher the man was in his westerns. Always the outsider who won't compromise, Boetticher was the real deal.  Enthusiastic, witty, optimistic, artistic and a great horseman -- he relished being alive -- as he bravely fought the demons that haunted him.

The underdog nature of his bare-bones westerns usually had a lone, mostly silent, alienated hero on a journey through a hostile landscape.  He crosses paths with a self-serving villain.  There are tight places and grand vistas, lyrical and pastoral surprises.  Existential and ambiguously emotional, there remains a moral emotional tone that somehow revolves around integrity itself. Integrity, grace and fate were Boetticher's cinematic trinity.  Burt Kennedy's ironic, poignant screenplays were a perfect fit for Boetticher's mindset.

Seven Men From Now is a masterpiece that takes us to a point of stillness, the moment of truth where righteousness of character is all that's left because ""there are some things you can't ride around.""

The esoteric commentary's by James Kitses, author of ""Horizons West: Anthony Mann, Budd Boetticher, Sam Peckinpah"" and there's a new documentary ""Budd Boetticher: An American Original.""",1158451200,5,2670,5.027272727272727

The typical 1950's theme of the tenderfoot being rescued by the seasoned gunfighter is portrayed once again--it must have appealed to the zeitgeist of the time.

Despite wrinkles and a slightly stiff gait, Scott manages to exude the charisma which he is famous for.  The wife of the tenderfoot, who is intruiged by Scott's charisma, is played by the gorgeous Gail Russell.  Lee Marvin is excellent as the smirking criminal who lurks around wanting to make time with the tenderfoot's wife and receives a well deserved punch in the jaw from Scott.

2414909,5,B000BDH6DU,"I recently saw this movie on the AMC channel. Even though I've been a fan of Westerns for nearly 40 years, I believe this was the first time I've seen it.

Until around 1995, I was never a big fan of Randolph Scott.  I think that's because I was too busy watching Clint Eastwood, John Wayne, Kirk Douglas and Jimmy Stewart. But, after watching ""Ride The High Country"" back in the mid 90's, I realized how much screen presence and talent Randolph Scott possessed. Watch the subtle expressions on his face as he's conversing with Gail Russell. The twitch of an eyebrow says a lot.

In the opening scene, it's obviouus that there is a shootout.  But, you don't know who ""won"" until you see that person riding a horse in the next scene.  So for a few moments, you're kept in suspense. I've pointed this out to exemplify the skill of the director.

""7 Men from Now"" is a terrific Western. It has been restored perfectly. Watching it on DVD widesceen is thrilling. The colors are magnificent. The camera angles, scene locations, storyline and acting are superb.  On a more grisley note:  when some of the men are ""shot"", watch how their bodies and arms twist and contort in pain as they fall. There's something about the way they react after being shot. And the silent moments in the saloon, when the men don't know each other and they don't know how to react to each other. It's the little things like that that make the movie all the more realistic.

Lee Marvin is excellent as always. The scene between he and Randolph Scott toward the end of the movie is classic (more twisting and contorting). This Western is now in my ""Top 10"". If you love Westerns like I do, you need to get this DVD. Watch this movie and then watch it again. It's very, very good in all aspects of movie-making.

2414910,5,B000BDH6DU,"The picture was almost never made. Warner Brothers objected to Gail Russell, who had not made a picture in five years, and they considered Randolph Scott too old. Only after threats by John Wayne to leave the studio was approval granted.

  The beginning is abrupt and not expected. The ending with the fate of the travelers to California seems to have been written by a different hand and does not match the rest of the picture either in content or style. Lee Marvin was not the usual western bad man, nor was his patience in pursuing the gold part of the expected story line.

  Altogether it is a picture that holds interest throughout. A modern audience might ask why the Marvin character was so polite to the Gail Russell character and why there was no obvious love interest between the Russell character and Scott, and if there really were seven men to find, and how the Russell character and her husband expected to get to California by themselves. And they might well ask why the picture disappeared for fifty years and was then released by Paramount instead of Warner Brothers. Questions to ask; answers to find. Along with Shane it remains a reminder of what westerns were before television changed the movies and the Italians changed them even more.

1. John Ford and John Wayne (From Stagecoach 1939 to The Man who Shot Liberty Valance 1962 Including many peoples favourite The Searchers 1956)
2. Anthony Mann and James Stewart (From Winchester 73 1950 to The Man from Laramie 1956), including my favourite Bend Of The River (USA) aka Where The River Bends (UK) 1953.
3. Bud Boettcher and Randolph Scott (From Seven Men From Now 1956 to Comanche Station 1960 including the marvellous Ride Lonesome)
In marked contrast to the first two partnerships, the seven Boettcher, Scott films were all together more modest affairs, built round its ageing star they had a running time of around one and a quarter hours give or take a minute or two. All seven films had strong supporting casts but four of them (see below) had the added benefit of a cracking script by Burt Kennedy making them mini-masterpieces with a cult following! These films would usually be found as a co-feature or as a so-called second feature or dare I say a B-Western.

Seven Men From Now 1956, leading players Randolph Scott, Gail Russell, Lee Marvin, Walter Reed, John Larch & Donald Barry. Running Time 78 minutes.

The Tall T 1957, leading players Randolph Scott, Maureen O'Sullivan, Richard Boone, Skip Homeier, Henry Silva & Arthur Hunnicutt. Running Time 77 minutes

Ride Lonesome 1959, leading players Randolph Scott, Pernell (Bonanza) Roberts Karen Steele (Mrs. Bud Boettcher), James Best, Lee Van Cleef & James Coburn (First film). Running Time 74 minutes

Comanche Station 1960, leading players Randolph Scott, Nancy Gates, Claude Akins, Skip Homeier, Richard Rust & Rand Brooks. Running Time 73 minutes.

Two year later (1962) Scott came out of retirement to make one final much acclaimed western Sam Peckinpah's Ride the High country aka Guns in the Afternoon with that other western stalwart Joel McCrea, a fitting final tribute to these Western Stars.

Seven Men From Now Has now been restored and released by John Wayne's Batjac Company. On a first class Special Collector's Edition DVD, which I excitedly received early in January 2006.

What is amazing me the most for a film dating from 50 year is its sheer modernity and the masterful work done by all involved, whether director Budd Boetticher or actors Randolph Scott, Lee Marvin or Gail Russell.
