8208187,1,B000T9D6EE,"Having lived and traveled in Hawaii I can assure you that this is the WORST possible representation of what Hawaii is about.  There is nearly NO footage of the stunning beauty of the islands.  Only some shots of crowded beaches and other tourist spots like golf courses, hotels, and luaus. Waste of money, waste of time.  He doesn't even know how to pronounce the names of the towns he's in.",1453766400,,391,4.557142857142857

8208191,1,B000T9D6EE,"Two 25 minute shows of the four main islands: Oahu & Kauai and Maui & Big Island.  After watching the two episodes plus the half hour of DVD Extras, I realized I had acquired practically zero travel and tourism information about the Islands.  Instead we watch Rudy play golf, eat lunch, attend a few night shows and interview the entertainers, crack open a nut, peek inside a hotel room, take a boat ride, attend a couple luaus, and if there's time left only then do we get to see a few of the real sights. This feels more like an Infomercial for some very specific minor parts of Hawaii and is nowhere near the ""spectacular tour"" info video guide that it claims to be.  I'm embarrassed at how little value there is on this DVD.  This should have been Rudy's Home Video and viewed only by his friends and family.",1397520000,,812,4.3933333333333335
8208192,5,B000T9D6EE,"Good viewing for those who can no longer travel on their own, that was why I purchased this as a gift. Or cannot travel at all...",1386028800,,129,4.0
8208193,4,B000T9D6EE,"Since I had never been to Hawaii before, I really wanted to see video footage (of greater quality that YouTube) prior to the trip.  The scenes were great and the narration was informative.  I loved that there were actually scenes of the hotel where we were booked to stay...the Ritz-Carlton.  It also showed part of the drive to Hana.

The only minus that I would give this was that it didn't expound a little more on Maui's places of interest.  I would have shown the parts of the road to Hana that are just little one way dirt roads that are very trecherous, explaining the best way to see that part of the island is by booking a tour van (like we did...and it still scared the bageebies out of us!) Also a view of the Ioa Needle/State Park from the central section of Maui would have been nice.",1286496000,,797,4.322147651006712
8208194,2,B000T9D6EE,"Having been to Maui twice, my husband and I are planning an extended trip to Hawaii next year, this time to take in the other islands as well.  We hoped to get a good overview of what to do and see and what to not miss...well, based on the (lack of) helpful info given on Maui, we wonder about what might be missing from the info on the other islands.  There has to be a better guide and I guess I will keep looking for it...",1225584000,10,425,3.9302325581395348
