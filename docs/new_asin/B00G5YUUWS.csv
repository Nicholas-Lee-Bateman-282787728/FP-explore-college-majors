8621005,4,B00G5YUUWS,"Do you live and die with the success of the Dodgers? Do you catch every Dodger's game you can and even take a transistor radio to Dodger Stadium to listen to Vin? Do you consider Kirk Gibson's home run in the first game of the 1988 World Series the holiest of holy events ever to occur at Dodger Stadium, even including the visit by the Pope? If the answer is yes to any or all of the above questions, than you are a die hard Dodgers fan and this film is for you. It is a love letter to the baseball fans of Los Angeles, as told through the eyes of several fans during the roller coaster season of 2008. For everyone else, this film is fun, but a bit disjointed. In fact like the Dodgers 2008 season, which saw the Boys in Blue sweep the Cubs in the NLDS but ultimately go quietly into the night against the Phills in the NLCS and miss out on the Fall Classic, this film gets close to great, but ultimately doesn't deliver the goods and falls a bit short.

So what is good? The scenic shots of Dodger Stadium and some exciting shots of baseball action frame this film well. The boys at the True Blue Tattoo parlor provide some of the films most loyal fan festivities, and the visit by Matt Kemp is particularly fun. The time spent on some of the players like the very classy Russ Martin, the youthful entrance of the goofy Clayton Kershaw, and the antics of Joe Beimel are a lot of fun, and make me wish they had spent more time with these guys. Beimel in particular, has some great character moments and really made me wish the Dodgers had held on to this talent, he is such a fun guy, and its no secret our bullpen could use his arm this season. The final scenes of the wild celebrations following the entry to the playoffs and the improbable sweep of the Cubs are mirrored by the bittersweet loss to the Phills, which provide some good drama. However, again, these scenes serve only to remind us how dramatic the 2008 storyline was, and how much is missing in this film. There is the intro of Manny, the run to catch Arizona in the standings, and as mentioned the success in the playoffs, but that is pretty much it. Where is Kent's dismal attitude and controversial calling out of Vin, in fact where is Kent at all for that matter? Where is Nomar, Lowe, Maddux or Juan Pierre, and what about all those injuries that plagued the team with disappointments like Schmidt, Penny, and Andruw Jones? As good as some of the focus on the team is, it mostly serves to remind us of how much is not on screen, and that is too bad.

So what is bad? Unfortunately this movie feels like a documentary that didn't quite know what it wanted to be. We have a lot of stories from fans, some interesting and unique, others not so much. However if this was to be a story all about the fans, then the stories seem to be woefully light in capturing who these people actually are, other than they really like their Dodgers. In addition the film leaves a lot of these fan stories unresolved. For example we never find out what happened with the courageous mother with cancer? I worry that she may have lost her long battle with that horrible disease, but the film makers may have left that piece out for fear of depressing the audience.

For baseball fans, this movie is a fun little tribute to a team that probably gets forgotten by a lot of fans who think the only true fans live in New York, Boston, Chicago or St. Louis. I so tire of the sports media's overindulgent attention on their east coast baseball, and this movie deftly showcases the fact that there are incredible fans out here in La La land too!

In fact, Russell Martin has a great line to this point. When Manny first joins the team, Martin gleefully tells him that now for the first time they'll actually get some coverage on Sports Center. Judging by the start of this 2009 season, and ESPN's shocking decision to actually spotlight Manny and the Dodgers, it turns out Martin was right!

Ultimately I think this was an ambitious project, and being the Dodger fan that I am, I recommend it because it is fun to watch and recount one of the best Dodger seasons in twenty years. The film makers do their best, but I think they didn't quite meet the challenge that every documentarian must face, which is to take hundreds or even thousands of hours of footage, find the most interesting elements, and then tell a cohesive and entertaining story.",1240531200,6,4389,4.373774509803922
