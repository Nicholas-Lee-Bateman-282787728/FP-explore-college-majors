4831316,5,B005LZW80E,Ok,1409875200,,2,2.0
4831317,5,B005LZW80E,"This is a captivating video that will hold your attention all throughout the movie.  The lead actor, Ryan  McIntyre, does an excellent job in his role as Trent.  I enjoyed this movie because it was entertaining, kept me in suspense, and the acting was excellent.",1402531200,,262,4.777777777777778
4831318,1,B005LZW80E,"A more appropriate title would be ""Moderately Attractive Guy and His Extended Dream Sequences."" In his dream sequences, he just walks around the mansion, for what seems like most of the movie. Without the dream sequences, this is a glorified short film that provides the barest minimum content. The guys are attractive, but it's easier to find more attractive guys, for free, somewhere else on the internet. The only thing vampire about this film is the incessant growling when there's a close-up.

Don't waste your time or money.",1402185600,5,530,5.0227272727272725
4831319,4,B005LZW80E,"I gave this four stars simply because Michael Hudson is in it. But seriously, the main guy is not that hot and the entire film seemed to revolve around him and his weird dream-like states (often reusing the same footage over and over and over....) I fast forward to the good parts...which are mainly the ones with Michael, LOL.",1393372800,,327,4.559322033898305
4831320,5,B005LZW80E,"If 10 stars were a possibility I would give this movie 20. There is rarely a seminal piece of work that crosses boundaries like 1313: Boy Crazies. In the great history of Laurence Olivier, Morgan Freeman, and Justin Timberlake, Boy Crazies is a bioepic pic that tells the tale of 1313 Pope, Pope Clement V.... only he's been possessed as a vampire, and it's based in 2012, and there are no fangs or blood. But otherwise, it is a true tale of what it took to be Pope in 1313. On Friday, 13 October 1307, hundreds of the Knights Templar were arrested in France, an action apparently motivated financially and undertaken by the efficient royal bureaucracy to increase the prestige of the crown. Philip IV was the force behind this move, but it has also embellished the historical reputation of Clement V. From the very day of Clement V's coronation, the king charged the Templars with usury, credit inflation, fraud, heresy, sodomy, immorality and abuses, and the scruples of the Pope were heightened by a growing sense that the burgeoning French State might not wait for the Church, but would proceed independently. Most of the film is true to the time, as everyone in 1313 was shirtless and showered without soap or wash clothes. Overall, this is one of the most important pieces every performed on camera. MUST SEE!",1391558400,3,1315,4.746724890829694
4831321,1,B005LZW80E,"If the main character walked throughout the house one more time I was ready to break the DVD.
The acting is not terrible, but...
There is no sex, no nudity, just posing and more posing and even more posing.
There is no real story.  No purpose. Just a huge waste of money and time.",1341100800,14,280,4.185185185185185
4831322,5,B005LZW80E,"This is a typical David Decoteau movie.  Silly, but pretty well produced.  Lots of boys clad in their underwear only. I loved it!!",1333152000,5,130,4.608695652173913
4831323,1,B005LZW80E,Terrible movie. Bad acting. Could not finish watching it.,1478217600,,57,5.444444444444445
4831324,1,B005LZW80E,What a waste of time.,1470700800,,21,3.4
4831325,3,B005LZW80E,All the movies in this series appear to have the same slow moving sequences and plot. Only good for seeing well-built guys in a movie.,1469145600,,134,4.4
4831326,2,B005LZW80E,"Horrible dialogue, multiple scenes reused, wooden acting",1468713600,,56,7.142857142857143
4831327,2,B005LZW80E,"Really, has David Coteau had an original idea in the last decade? Boys in tight white underware walking up and down the halls over and over. Taking entirely to much time to do so.  And then repeating the same scene in the same movie over and over. The tormented dreams that come to not much of anything. Filmed in the same house time and time again.  And then there is the shower in which one or more actors have water running on them in a sensual way rubbing their chests and arms for a ridiculous amount of time and suggesting a sexuality that never comes to fruition.  The voice overs using the same effects ad nauseam.  He cant even adhere to the mythology of vampirism.  Thank goodness I was watching paint dry while I was watching this . . .

The acting was a little better in this movie than in some of Davids previous ones.",1468627200,5,831,4.294871794871795
4831328,1,B005LZW80E,This can't even be called a movie.  Its bad acting at its finest which is the norm for videos on amazon and Netflix,1468540800,,115,4.0
4831329,1,B005LZW80E,"My biggest complaint is that it was so padded, with endless scenes of a guy just walking very slowly from place to place in his briefs. The guy in question was certainly no dog, but he wasn't hot enough to make me forget the nonsensical story, endless slow-cooking, etc.",1468454400,,270,4.530612244897959
4831330,1,B005LZW80E,I am super grateful that I was able to watch this movie on prime and did not have to rent or purchase. I swear to god all that walking around the house was complete bulls***; I did not see the point in it. the story has a good synopsis unfortunately the writer and the director fell completely flat on this. This movie had no problematic issue to be resolved. This movie is suppose to be vampiric but there was nothing indicating of vampires. The suppose drinking of the victims which were about 2 or 3 was ridiculous. All in all this movie was a waste of time and money to even make it. there was as before mentioned a good synopsis; the movie had a chance of actually being good. Unfortunately the people who came up with the writing as well as the film development had no real imagination of how to make this movie better. It's like that maybe the director plagiarized a couple of previous vampire movies where the main character walks around in a daze and try to make it his or hers movie. At any rate this was a very s***ty movie and if the directors other movie are just as bad then maybe the director should quit his or her job and look into another profession. No one wants to watch a s***ty movie as this.,1468108800,,1214,4.259740259740259

4831333,1,B005LZW80E,Crazies is right. Whoever financed this film was crazy.,1467072000,,55,5.222222222222222
4831334,1,B005LZW80E,Figured it was going to be bad. Wow I was right...:),1466899200,,52,3.8181818181818183
4831335,1,B005LZW80E,Could not watch it until bed. They should have used some name brand underwear. It might have given them a bigger budget for a few more written lines.,1466640000,,149,4.357142857142857

4831337,1,B005LZW80E,"Extremely slow and weird rather than scary.  Instead of renting the spectacular modern house where all the ""action"" takes place, the money would have been better spent on a script.",1466380800,,180,5.0

4831345,1,B005LZW80E,"You know what it is--you already looked at the cover...  An excuse to parade hot dudes around in underwear.  Dialog?  Not really.  Nudity?  None.  Bad camera shots with an annoying blue filter for 50% of the movie?  Yep.

No.  They're not good at making movies or basic soft core porn unfortunately.  Seek elsewhere.

I fast forwarded through the blue parts and watched the dialog parts laughs and didn't find much--mostly so that I could claim to have watched enough of it to reliably review it.  The dude in the front spends most of his time walking around the house looking wistful.",1465344000,,585,4.683168316831683

4831347,1,B005LZW80E,"A waste of celluloid. Another example of just because it's gay doesn't mean it's good. A thin plot, community college actors with badly written dialogue and gratuitous, albeit good looking gym bod eye candy. I give the one star for that!",1465084800,,237,4.804878048780488
