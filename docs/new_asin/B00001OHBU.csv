7914616,2,B00001OHBU,"I would have given this dvd the highest rating possible, IF it included the footage of Cece Winans performing ""I Am"" and ""Everlasting Love""... BUT IT DOESN'T. Huge disappointment!!!!! Seeing her perform those two songs was my favorite part of this concert dvd - can't possible think of a good reason why they would not include those songs on here, but it was a foolish decision (imo). So if you're buying this disk with the hopes of seeing Cece sing ""I Am"" and ""Everlasting Love""... keep your money because they're not on here.",1457913600,,527,4.67741935483871

7914618,1,B00001OHBU,"The sound quality on this ""Live Video"" is very, very bad.  It  seems to me that the video was recorded live and the sound added  afterwards.  I would not recommend this video to anyone",965606400,6,184,4.323529411764706
