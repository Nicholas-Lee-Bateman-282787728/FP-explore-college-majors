2754503,5,B000N3STVQ,"I bought the ""first"" season a few weeks ago and found that it was not the first season I remembered. No Cort, no craig and Hobie was played by Brandon Call. These were the best shows in the entire series. They focused on Baywatch and babes, not just babes.....

This is the one to buy if you want to watch the real first series!!",1198972800,3,329,4.140625
2754504,4,B000N3STVQ,"I watched this show from the second episode on when it aired on NBC.  I'd missed the pilot for a reason I can't recall, but I enjoyed the show.  It was fun with a pretty good cast.  Then, because it had ranked 50th in the Nielsen ratings, NBC pulled the plug.  Almost two years later, it was finally announced that the show was picked up by another network.  It was never the same after that.  Only Mitch, Eddie, Shaunie, and Garner came back from the original cast.  You could tell immediately that the show just didn't have a quality feel to it that it had in its pilot season.  I watched the show on and off until I'd given up.  After that, the show went ""playmate crazy.""

To me, this is the only season of Baywatch that is worth watching. The
acting and stories are much better than what you'd find in the subsequent seasons. While it's true, that the show flaunted female parts, it did focus, to some degree, on the lives and jobs of lifeguards of L.A. County. Granted, they took some liberties with these roles, as you often found Mitch and his friend, Craig Pomeroy (Parker Stevenson) employing themselves as crime-stoppers as well as lifeguards, but you generally gave for a bit of leeway there, because the show was entertaining.  You also have to remember that back then, dramas were not going for a lot of realism.

Another advantage this season had were veteran actors such as Monte Markham playing the authoritarian Captain Don Thorpe, who always took his job as a lifeguard captain very seriously, and usually at the expense of all junior lifeguards around him.

I think in some regards, the reason the show was so much better, was that they had a bigger budget to work with, being initially with NBC. NBC was also interested in making sure that along with the ""extra skin"" that the show might be used to inspire saftey-consciousness as well.

First season sees Mitch battling his ex-wife for custody of Hobe (who was then played by Brandon Call). Call was brilliant in the role, and I felt that Jeremy Jackson wasn't as good in the seasons that followed.

Also, Mitch was NOT revealed to be an ex-Navy Seal. While buddy, Cort (John Allen Nelson) was later added to the cast, he was the only one who was considered a former SEAL. As the personal history suggests from this season, Mitch has been a lifeguard for a long time, perhaps going back to high school, along-side best friend, Craig Pomeroy.

Eddie Kramer (Billy Warlock) was a rookie lifeguard, alongside Shaunie McClane (Erika Eleniak). Eddie was the hot-headed kid from the wrong side of Philadelphia who loved to spend his free hours boxing. The writers of the show quickly saw that the ""meat"" of their storyline was the relationship between Eddie and Shaunie. Several episodes had storylines surrounding the romance. Warlock and Eleniak eventually became engaged in real life.

The cast also included Peter Phelps (Trevor) who played a rogue, Australian lifeguard. He left the show halfway in. Parker Stevenson played Craig Pomeroy, a veteran lifeguard who is torn between being a lifeguard and being a lawyer. His wife, Gina, was played by Holly Gagnier. Finally, there was also Shawn Weatherly (Jill Riley) who was another veteran lifeguard who was famously killed off by a shark attack in the middle of the season.

NBC cancelled the show after the first season. The final episode included a marriage proposal by Eddie to Shaunie. Obviously after the show was given the ""go ahead"" by a new network, many of the storylines and origins were either removed altogether or altered in some way.

For example, Mitch's budding teenage son, Hobe, was reverted back to a young boy of about 10 or 11. Eddie's propsal to Shaunie was pretty much ditched. Eddie would propose at the end of the next season.

Craig Pomeroy would be written out of the show altogether. One can assume that he quit.

For me, Baywatch began and ended after its first season, and this is the only season worth owning.

Note*  The original theme song (sung by Peter Cetera ""Save Me"") is not used before each episode.  Also, some of the songs used during the episodes have also been changed unfortunately.  It's too bad because the original music and songs were good and went well with the show.",1196121600,27,4237,4.708672086720867
2754505,3,B000N3STVQ,"Unlike the earlier mis-titled ""Season 1"" DVD that was released in the US a couple of years ago, this Australian import actually contains all the episodes from the real first season of Baywatch when it was an NBC network series.  There's no Pamela Anderson or Alexandra Paul.  Instead we have former Miss USA Shawn Weatherly, the beautiful Holly Gagnier, and the show's original Playboy playmate, Erica Eleniak.  Long-time viewers who miss the flamboyant characters of the later syndicated seasons will have to console themselves with David Hasselhoff's extremely gay hairdo, which was in full bloom even at this early stage.  The six-disk set offers absolutely no extras (the episode titles appear in an unnumbered list on the case, and the only way to tell which disk each one is on is to count them off in groups of four), but the hard-case package is good. The quality of the 4x3 video is adequate, but this collection will be a welcome addition to anyone who was interested in the first season of the show.",1179187200,27,1010,4.820809248554913
2754516,5,B000N3STVQ,"I Used to watch Baywatch all the time on TV. I really enjoyed it. So, I Have been trying to get as many seasons as possible.",1353715200,,124,3.8076923076923075
2754517,4,B000N3STVQ,"I am happy that I bought the Australian Import of the show. This is the 1st season of the series (before it was syndicated). I am upset that the music is changed, but I fast forward through the opening credits after I've seen them once anyway. The opening song being different is the main thing that bothers me about the music. Songs changed within the episodes don't really bother me. If you want this season as a US release, you have to wait til all of the other seasons are released in the US. They include a couple episodes from this season in each of the other seasons til you collect them all. Also, I've read that some people are upset about the quality of picture, but this was a 90's TV show (not a show in HD), so I think the quality is just fine. I do wish there were extras and I also wish the music was what was original to the series. If you want this season now and don't want to have to wait for all of the other seasons to be released in the US, and you want a version that will play on US DVD players, the Australian release is definitely the way to go. I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 because of the music being different and because there are no extras.",1315440000,2,1182,4.099137931034483
2754518,5,B000N3STVQ,I have really enjoyed watching Baywatch Season 1 it really bring back the good days when it was on televison. You are the only site that I can find most of my televison show back in the 60's and 70's; also you have the best music that is hard to find. Thank you Amazon for such a great website.,1301011200,,294,4.0
2754519,5,B000N3STVQ,Good quality. Nice to watch thin beautiful people on the beach during our cold snowy winters. Subject not rocket science but none the less entertaining.,1295395200,,152,5.12
2754520,1,B000N3STVQ,"The adjective ""bad"" is not nearly strong enough to describe this TV series.  Horrible, insulting, stupid, inept...  Nope, I just can't come up with the perfect description.  I didn't watch the series when it was on TV and thought I'd give it a shot on DVD.  Big mistake.

First of all, I've been on a good many resort beaches, and they are not inhabited by such bevvies of giggly gaggles of young women in mini-bikinis as we see here.  Rather, there are a great many middle-aged and old people wearing bathing suits that make one want to look elsewhere.  I know because I am one of the latter.

The plots of ""Baywatch,"" what there is of them in the individual episodes, are silly.  They consist of showing nubile, would-be starlets romping around on sunny California beaches for no particular reason and body building lifeguards rushing into the surf with red floats to save some poor fool who only addition to the story is drowning.  Most of the females have no speaking lines or mercifully few lines, which is just as well.  When the girls were hired, at the urging of Playboy Magazine, I suspect, learning lines wasn't part of the talents on their resume.  Giggling, yes, speaking, no.

The acting of those with speaking roles is laughable.  Of course, given the dialogue written for them, it is somewhat understandable.  The cast does not include one person who could act. Not one.  I managed to sit through four episodes, and in the immortal words of Popeye, ""I can't stands no more.""

I realize that some viewers liked this show, and that it was a world-wide phenomonon.  I also realize that I'll probably get some nasty comments for this, but so be it.",1266278400,4,1659,4.642611683848798
2754521,5,B000N3STVQ,"This 1989-90 Season of BAYWATCH was the original BAYWATCH series that ran on NBC from the Fall of 1989 to the Spring of 1990, but had tanked after only 8 months when a tidal wave struck in the ratings after Jill Reilly(Shawn Weatherly's)departure, which resulted in this shows cancellation in the Summer of 1990 before BAYWATCH was revived in syndication in the Fall of 1991 with better ratings than before.

Unfortunately, this BAYWATCH DVD was not what I had expected or hoped for since the introduction credits didn't have the original BAYWATCH theme song of ""Save Me"" by Peter Cetera that was originally played at the beginning of each of these episodes when they were on NBC, plus they deleted the previews of most of these episodes and they even deleted and replaced the original songs of each episodes with other songs in every episode, plus this DVD didn't even provide Closed Captioned on top of that either.

Therefore this BAYWATCH DVD was totally not worth it and almost nothing like it was shown on NBC.",1249603200,3,1016,4.767045454545454
2754522,4,B000N3STVQ,"I was a fan of Baywatch from the begininng.  The only thing different is the music, which is not a big deal.  The show is good, and the quality of this set is good.

2754523,5,B000N3STVQ,"Like almost everyone I was slighly upset when I found out the other first season was really season 2. This season has some of the episodes that made it a classic. Plus it had some of my all time favorite characters; Craig, Gina, Jill, Trevor and Cort. It doesn't have any extras and the episode title is not listed on the DVDs.  This does make it kind of hard if you are looking for a specific episode. But that all aside this is a must have for any Baywatch fan.",1219017600,6,463,4.144444444444445

8174453,5,B000N3STVQ,Baywatch Season 1 which includes Shawn Weatherly (jill Riley)..This is the reason I bought this dvd .  This also includes the original TV Movie opening credit song.  Very good story lines and true to form .  Great original casting...,1475625600,,233,4.923076923076923
8174454,5,B000N3STVQ,"This is the true first season of Baywatch and this is especially the truly greatest season of Baywatch. There are only two seasons for me which are the seasons with Shauni and Eddie but their debut season which is season 1 is the greatest. It's a fabulous season because it captures the true essence of being an L.A. County Lifegaurd. Another reason why this is such a fab season is because it is really the only one that is realistic because a lot of the episodes have very dark themes and aren't sugar coated like the other seasons. I've noticed that unlike the other seasons of this show--this particular one has many deaths; in fact it has the most drownings and deaths out of all the seasons. It has a killer cast too, I love Jill, Shauni, Eddie, Craig, and Gina and Hobie as Brandon Call. I like Jeremy Jackson too but Brandon was best at playing Hobie. This season was so great because it combined heroism, action, mystery, passion and romance beautifully. This season was going real great until the episode before the season finale when the writers horribly decided to kill of Shawn Weatherly's character, Jill from a shark attack!!!!! To make things worse--in the following episode the surviving cast members just acted like everything was fine; as if nothing major happened (except Shauni, her best friend who was the only one who mourned and took Jill's death the hardest) they made her death like it was some minor thing which in truth the opposite--no funeral, no memorial service for her from Baywatch-NOTHING!!!!!! It was as you know from other reviewers cancelled by NBC because of this but picked up again in Fall 1991 but as others have said and I strongly exactly agree with them; never the same again. The second season was just okay for me--it still had Mitch, Hobie(made younger and played by Jeremy Jackson from that point on), and my faves, Shauni and Eddie but no more Craig and Gina which pisses me off infinitely. I like Harvey played by Tom McTigue (he brought humor) and Ben (brought sweetness and wisdom of heroism) played by Richard Jaekel but their characters didn't even have a chance to grow because the producers only let them stay on for one season. What really pisses me off is they only invited Eddie and Shauni back to make this their farewell season and this was only their second season on the show. Sad and disappointing how they allowed Pamela (who absolutely brought no meaning whatsoever to the show except her boobies and derrier) stay on for 5 years and only allowed Erika and Billy (who's characters brought a lot of meaning and beauty on the show) stay on for 2 years. Yes, season 1 and 2 are the only real and true Baywatch for me--the rest of the others are really and truly Bikiniwatch!!!!",1453161600,6,2741,4.653608247422681

8174457,5,B000N3STVQ,"This season that was broadcast on NB, ShawnieC before it later went into syndication, This season had all the bikinis and beachs but was more about the male lifeguards. This is the season with Parker Stevenson, who got the job because a few years earlier made  a theatrical movie with Sam Elliott called ""Lifeguard."" Also halfway thru they cast the male lifeguard ""Cort"" who bonded with Hasselhoff's character, Billy Warlock's character, and Stevenson's. The season started with beauty contestant winner Shawn Weatherly but halfway thru the season they decided to go in another direction so she was killed off by a shark. This was also the season that introduced us to Eddie's (Billy Warlock) favorite lifeguard and love interest Shawnie (Erika Eleniak). I remember when after the show ended its NBC run and came back 2 years later that most of the guys were gone,, Shawnie got bustier, Hobie looked different, and the male storylines were gone and they started bringing in sexy Playboy playmates and other sexy women to carry out the storylines. Toward the end of its run they did bring back Parker Stevenson and the ""Cort"" character back for some great storylines.",1371254400,2,1166,4.97948717948718
