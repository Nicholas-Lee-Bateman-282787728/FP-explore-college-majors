5942971,5,B00ET6LPRI,"I absolutely love DM.  You can just sit back and enjoy the show, no worry about anything splattering across the screen or gross behavior.  Like most I had waited a long time for the series to be released.  I debated ordering the rest of the series individually or go ahead and buy the complete collection.  I opted for number 2, and glad I did.  Not only do you get the rest of the series, 4-8, but also you get the three DM movies.  Good bonus.",1385596800,22,445,4.176470588235294
5942972,5,B00ET6LPRI,this is ne of the best show on the planet. I love diagnosis murder. It is not the same because he is not funny like in dick van dyke but I still love it. If you love murder she wrote you will like this,1384992000,,201,3.590909090909091
5942973,5,B00ET6LPRI,"I bought seasons 1-3 of Diagnosis murder when they were first released and kept waiting and waiting for the rest of the seasons to be released. Finally all 8 seasons are available! I really didn't want to pay $299 (MSRP) for the set, but I was willing to do so, if it meant having a complete collection. However, I was able to find the set on the Visual Entertainment Incorporated website for $149.95! True, the s&h from Canada to the U.S. was about $20, but it arrived in two days! And each season is packaged separately, so there is no worry of scratched disks. I am now in the middle of a Diagnosis Murder marathon. I love this set!",1384732800,38,635,4.34453781512605
5942974,4,B00ET6LPRI,"I have to admit that I never watched this show  starring Dick Van Dyke, his son, and even his grandson!  which aired on CBS from 1993-2001  until I received the press screener from VEI (the company releasing this huge box set). So I went in sort of blind and did like what I saw. For some unknown reason, VEI provided journalists with just one single disc  Disc 3  from the set  that included four full 47-minute episodes (commercials have been excised). Though the huge box includes the three  TV pilot episodes and the two reunion shows  plus  strangely  a sample episode of the totally unrelated series, Mannix, none of these were available to sample or screen. So I cant comment on more than the four episodes (all from one of the eight seasons.

I do have to say that the clothing on some of the actors sure looks outdated so quickly but the thing I found most interesting in the time warp was the advancement in technology. When one character needs to be contacted by his office, he receives an alert on his beeping pager (remember those?) and has to ask the folks in the office he is in if he can use their land-line phone! My we have advanced! None of this will affect the enjoyment of the series; just sharing my observation.

Based on the four episodes I was able to see (again, all in one season) the images are sharp and crisp. (Im guessing these are same from the CBS Home Video releases, which VEI acquired).

Im also surprised  as apparently other reviewers here are  that the price on Amazon is significantly different from VEIs direct sale price. But Ive learned over the years that Amazons price does fluctuate, and the units they are selling do come from VEI.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful (well, as much as I had to work with)

5943016,4,B00ET6LPRI,"For a long time I have been wanting the complete series of ""Diagnosis, Murder,"" but the only thing I could find was individual seasons, so I was very glad when I saw the whole set advertised.  I have been watching it every night for almost 4 weeks, since I first got it, and I really enjoy it.  I would probably give it a 5 star rating, but the way it is boxed makes it difficult to take out individual discs that are placed together and also to return them to their cases.  Also,  there have been a few times when the picture freezes for a number of minutes and then skips to something else.  I don't know how much of the episodes I have missed.  Fortunately such episodes are the minority, but I cannot give it a 5 star.  If this was on a scale of 1 to 10, I would call it a 9.",1473724800,2,779,3.9870967741935486

Also there is a Volume 2 of the Made for TV Movies set which contains 4 Made for TV movies. All four of them are included in the complete set also, but in the form of two part TV episodes.

5943023,5,B00ET6LPRI,"This is a complete set that includes the Jake and the Fatman episode (S04,E18) ""It Never Entered My Mind"" that features ""Dr. Mark Sloan"", presumably the episode that triggered the Diagnosis Murder movies. The first 3 movies are included with the characters played by other people, as are the last two movies which follow the last season nicely. The last movie ties up some loose ends nicely. It's too bad that series couldn't have gone on a few more years.

I had issues with 5 discs and it's usually the disks on the inside covers where one is over the other and perhaps in handling one disk scratched the other. It's in the area's of the scratches that the show freezes. Other than that I had no issues playing the enter collection.

It was also nice to see Mannix, and Mission Impossible as well as other series tie into this one. Apparently many of Dicks and Barry's kids made it into the show playing several rolls.

The show is one of the last good clean family oriented (no foul language) shows that were made. My only complaint was that the music where you make the show selections was much louder than it had to be. I found myself lowering the volume at that point and once the show was selected, increasing the volume.",1468368000,,1228,4.497757847533633

5943035,4,B00ET6LPRI,"Without a doubt a great treat for fans - and overall a wonderful collection. As stated, all 8 TV series and 5 movies are present, as well as the bonus episodes of Jake and the Fatman and Mannix etc.

The video quality is generally as good as it can be, 720x480, although everything is interlaced which is a bit nasty. A good deinterlace will do wonders though and this will look pretty great - especially the later series'.

The discs are clearly made to a budget like other reviews have noted, as they have some dud areas fresh out the box which make playback freeze up. Maybe I'm lucky but I've experienced this on 3 of the 48ish discs I've tried so far and skipping forward 30 seconds has resumed playback fine, so I'm not too bothered about it. I'm not sure how a standalone DVD/BD player would handle it, but playing in a computer with VLC these bad areas of the disc are easily jumped over.

The cases are similarly a bit cheap. I had this shipped internationally which is maybe my own fault, but several of the cases had loose discs upon opening them up. Luckily only one seemed to have sustained real damage and I think it'll buff out just fine, but be a little cautious. I also have one or two disc trays whose center clips won't hold a disc securely, and the folding central parts that hold the additional discs feel like they wouldn't stand up to much punishment - although mine are all intact and fine.

Lastly, the one real actual issue I had was when I got to the end of season 7 and put the last disc in. It was episodes I'd already seen, and upon closer inspection, I had a duplicate of the last disc in season 5. VEI happily sent me a replacement disc after I emailed them, which arrived promptly and works fine, so well done them!

In the end if you really want to see this show again this is kinda the only way to do it, so if it's worth it to you you should buy it, it's ace!",1459900800,8,1895,4.223756906077348
5943036,5,B00ET6LPRI,These shows grow on you... at first I was not sure but believe me I'm looking forward to one episode each day... they are very good stories.

5943042,2,B00ET6LPRI,"Wonderful show but so far 2 discs are defective - I'm only on season 7.  Of course I didn't have time to watch each and every episode in less than 30 days when the return policy runs out.  Now a month later I'm discovering that some disks are defective... stop playing middle of episode. No apparent defects or scratches on the disk themselves.  Must be the recording that is defective. For the price they charge, each disc should be 100% playable.

Love the set of diagnosis murder, and the quality of playback isn't bad provided the disk isn't defective.  But I'm upset that disks have defects and are unplayable... seller should offer a special return policy were any defective disc should be replaced within 90 days instead of less than 30 because shipping takes time from date of order..

Also the case with the disks came broken and shattered inside so the DVDs were bouncing in the cases while shipping.  Horrible flimsy brittle cases with broken inserts that hold the DVDs.  It's obvious that this company is too busy with the bottom line but not customer service.  Very disappointed. I will not order from this company again.  Beware.... the price they charge is not worth the defective product.
Added:
I finished the complete set and in total 5 disks were defective.  If they used a simple program called disc compare to compare data with the master disk when they burn them, maybe they would have less duds.  the disks were not damaged but the data stream was missing so they either copy them way to fast, or their copy burner machine was not clean or defective.  What could be a fantastic product is not so because the company doesn't listen to their customers nor tries to rectify the situation.",1456876800,2,1708,4.672240802675585

Didn't anyone test these before shipping or packaging???  My movies set from Amazon was good quality so I expected these DVDs to be the same.  My first three Season DVDs of the series were good quality DVDs but this Complete Collection is not anywhere near the same quality.  I do not understand what happened to cause the difference.

In the middle of the show they stop takes forever to get them going again and once you do it's moved ahead so you lose a lot of the show. This happens repeatedly on the number of DVDs.

5943062,4,B00ET6LPRI,"I love this series and I'm glad this set has been created. The only reasons I'm not giving it a 5 star review are 1. Many of my discs had light scratching. 2. Season 3 Disc 5 the episodes are obviously out of order as Amanda is pregnant, gives birth, and then in the next episode, is 9 months pregnant again. 3. Season 6 disc 3, Season 7 discs 3 & 6, and Season 8 Disc 6 all have episodes that cut in and out. The pixels clearly show. One episode was so bad, I skipped through most of it. All in all I was pleased as none or the damaged episodes were my favorites.

My favorite thing about this show is the obvious bond and respect between father and son. Both with two different professions. I love the interaction and love between all of the main characters. I did find it difficult to keep all the part time Van Dyke characters separate. Two of them played three different people each throughout the series.",1442620800,3,910,4.2298850574712645

5943070,4,B00ET6LPRI,"Diagnosis Murder is a wonder departure from what passes as entertainment in crime shows these days.  The stories are compelling; allow one to enjoy trying to figure out ""who done it"" and why, without being subjected to down-right gross scenes of murder and the crimes depicted in other shows. ---  It even provides nice touches of comedy, along with a good moral to the story.  It was always one of my favorite shows from the past and it remains a solid and relevant series today. The cast in wonderful and their chemistry together is perfection.---  I would have given it 5 stars, except for the disc problem described below:

The only con... I am experiencing the occasional freezing up, during some of the episodes.  I have just finished season 5.  I had difficulties with one disc in Seasons 3 & 4.  It is something others complained about, so I was prepared for the possibility.  The price of the set was just too good to pass up and I took a chance. ---  When a freeze has happened, I found that shutting the DVD player power off and back on is a quick solution for me.  It begins where I left off and the freeze has passed.  It's a bit annoying, but so far it's only happened a couple of times.  The shows are so good, I can overlook the minor inconvenience.",1435017600,5,1265,4.424242424242424

If there was to be a part of this Complete Set I would have to say was a slight let down; it would have to been the pact that two or three of the Seasons were split up into [Part One + Part 2 Sets], other than that - I would monumentally recommend this to anyone who loves this show.

UPDATE (12/4/2015):
The reason Im taking two stars off is because of the quality of the discs.  I tried to review the seller in a different place, but the ""Leave Seller Feedback"" button is not available for this company.  Thus, I am going to leave it here:

I bought this DVD set (for the record, I bought it through my father's account before I had an account of my own; this is why my review isn't marked as a ""Verified Purchase"") from the seller VEI.  Season 1 was fine, but ALL of seasons 2 and 3 are unwatchable due to damaged/defective discs.  Much of seasons 5, 6, and 8 are were also unable to be watched.  I saved up for months to order the entire 8-seasons, so this was very disappointing.  What is further disappointing is that although VEI said they would send me replacements for the damaged discs, they NEVER did, despite the fact that I sent them at least 4 e-mails.  It's been almost a year, and still nothing ... I have given up on them.  So, if you can get a good copy, this series is awesome and worthy of 5 stars ... but I'm taking 2 off for such a lousy company.",1426636800,,1217,4.293859649122807

5943106,4,B00ET6LPRI,"This is one of my favorite shows.  I WOULD give it 5 stars except that I ended up getting a very bad batch of DVDs from VEI and had to contact them several times to get the bad discs replaced.  After 3 months I FINALLY received the discs and cannot leave feedback for the company, but some of the new discs are not very good.  I can only hope that I have a legal version of this set!  It's a wonderful show!

This set also comes with the movies which I was a little disappointed with.  I sort of wish I had watched the movies first, except that I believe two of the movies were originally aired as part of the last series so watching those first would have thrown me off with the story line.  The ONLY other downfall with this show is that for some reason they really liked to make episodes that were ""To be continued"".  I think there was a series of them that continued on through several episodes.  (I'm so glad I didn't have to wait until the following week to find out what happened!)  I don't always get to sit down for several hours straight to watch the show so I didn't like the continuous episodes if I was trying to find out what happened before going to bed.

Overall, this is a great show but if you get bad discs I would try to contact the people you purchased it from as soon as possible to get replacement discs.  After how long it took VEI to finally get me the replacement discs I wish I had returned the entire series and just purchased it from Amazon now that the price has dropped so much.  Between the bad discs and the newer discs that are not very good, I was able to watch all of the episodes all the way through so I guess I cannot complain too much.

This program dealt with healing and finding the guilty person when a murder was committed.  I especially like that a doctor takes on the role of being a consultant for the police and helping them solve crimes.  Also present day issues where dealt with in the plot and brought the characters closer together.  I really liked watching Dick Van Dyke and his son Barry Van Dyke as well as all four of Barry's children making appearances in several episodes which were also written by Barry Van Dyke.,1411948800,3,605,4.626168224299065

5943137,5,B00ET6LPRI,"When I 1st saw the complete series was available I was estastic, I'd found a cable station that carried it, but not in the order it was shown. I didn't care but when I saw this I didn't think twice about buying it, the TV shows today are hard to find a really good one - then when I find a new one tha I really like it's not around for long. Thanks Amazon for bringing some of the good older series in complete sets back so they are easy to find, this is the 1st place I look.

5943141,1,B00ET6LPRI,"This was the worst crime show of the 90's . A bunch of wooden acting , bland cases and doctors doing homicide detectives job for them . I don't see what the appeal was to this and it made Hargroves Matlock series look realistic .",1396483200,,229,4.111111111111111

5943148,2,B00ET6LPRI,"This is a great mystery series and at less than $1 per episode, it really isn't that expensive.  I also thought the quality of the videos were very good, given that the original material was videotaped rather than film. Packaging (cases and shelfbox) was actually quite good for safe long-term storage and use -- a world better than the old brittle-case packaging of a couple years ago.

My PROBLEM was that several discs froze up at specific points of playback in just the first several discs.  I checked ahead and found a few more duds.  That irritates me since brand-new, spotless DVD's are usually very reliable stuff.  I should mention that I have 3 Blu-Ray/DVD players (2 Panasonics and a Sony) bought within the last year and all have up-to-date software, and each player had the same problems with the same dud discs.  A bit more than 10% of my shows are, consequently, unwatchable.

I'd have given the whole set 5 STARS but for the dud discs.",1392854400,30,951,4.658682634730539

5943150,5,B00ET6LPRI,"The set arrived 1 day ahead  of schedule and was in excellent condition from VIE entertainment. Box wasn't damaged. Can't wait to start watching them as they just returned them to TV, but in the middle of the night(pacific time).Would recommend to anyone who likes Dick Van Dyke. All the characters are great, but don't care for Scott Baio. Think his personality isn't right for the show. He's just NOT funny at all. Glad they got Charlie Schlatter(Jessie Travis)- in the show starting with part  of season 3!I Don't get tired of watching the same episode over and over.",1392249600,,570,4.747474747474747
5943151,4,B00ET6LPRI,"The shows are a bit more fuzzy at first than I expect despite the age but as you go through the seasons, it gets better. I don't enjoy how they put the disc sets together-each panel or side has two disc slots where half of a disc goes on top of another. To me, that increases the chance of scratches to the discs.
However, over all I am extremely glad I got this set since I can now see all the episodes I love and also see ones that I missed in TV. The movies are a great bonuses as well and they have bonus episodes from another show that introduced Dr. Mark Sloan. That is very awesome.",1391644800,24,589,4.0

We started getting these for my Dad when he was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer. He was eating very little dinner at the time. However, when he watched one of these shows, his interest was so piqued that he didn't notice he was eating more. All these older shows have really been a Godsend!

5943155,4,B00ET6LPRI,"I bought this collection for all the seasons except the first and second when Scott Baio was on the show. The cast really came together after Charlie Schlatter replaced Baio in season three. From then on, the episodes were a lot of fun. The camaraderie of the cast is obvious, especially between Dick and his real-life son, Barry, who plays a detective. For those who would like subtitles, they are only available on the first two seasons. I would have preferred that option be available for the entire series.  Also, the opening music on each disc is much too loud until you select the episode you wish to watch so it's best to use the mute button before hand. Over all, it's an entertaining series and enjoyable to watch.",1390521600,3,723,4.604651162790698

5943164,5,B00ET6LPRI,Who can go wrong with Dick Van Dyke?  He can do anything well. Especially enjoyed his son as the Police.  I really lked the first season best. I liked When Scott Bao was in it. I thought his Character was very interesting and the group of friends at the hospital including Dr Sloane's Assistance (who also changed in following seasons) and the head of Hospital (who left after 2 season) was the tightest chemistry group in comparing to other seasons. But they had wonderful guest stars and some really fun plots.,1387497600,,512,4.615384615384615
