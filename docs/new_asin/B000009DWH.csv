8188899,5,B000009DWH,"I really love this film. Not only do Cheung and Chow work well as a comic double act, fans of 80's style bloodshed and Canto-English madness will  really enjoy this ragbag of a film. You should really try to get the  original subtitled version - some of them are real corkers - ""wow..  really big breasts.. She kills me!.."". There is also a lot of english  in the original canto version, mostly the F word. My favourite line has to  be Chow - ""F***.. F*** you Up!""..  Much gwailo bashing and  unnecessary tumbling and fliping. This film also features the Police Chief  from Fight Back To School 1+2 and God Of Gamblers 3, the notorious  ""scissor-legs"" who sends Chow to find his wallet this time. Eric  Tsang makes a fletting appearance as a dodgy watch sales man and Blacky Ko,  who also directs, plays the demented killer.",968025600,2,824,4.537414965986395
