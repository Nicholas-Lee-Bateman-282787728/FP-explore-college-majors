458257,5,6302413850,"There's really no way for me to not give this five stars. None of the movies would come close to qualifying for a five star rating on their own, but given the consumer who is investigating this collection, it gets five stars because it delivers all the way.

The movies are comically bad and everyone knows it, especially Dean who nods and winks and deadpans his way through the lot of 'em. Thankfully we are given his ""promo"" spots for the film, promo in name only because Dean rolls his eyes and sarcastically recommends these exercises in farce with as much enthusiasm and droll humor as he executes his lines throughout the quartet of films. In the same cheesy category (and sharing the same musical director in Nelson Riddle) as the Batman movie and series from roughly the same time period, these movies are campy fun from one horribly bad scene to the next. There are plenty of outrageously hilarious moments, at times unintentional such as the special effects of a nuclear missle launch or other attempts at high-tech movie making, and others just plain pandering to the stereotype of Dean Martin - swinger, like the pop-up bar in a car as Dean and Stella Stevens get crushed tooling down the highway.

These movies are great fun and would go over well as a social event as well. It's just a shame that movies aren't made like this anymore. Certainly our culture needs lampooned with such endearing charm as Dean and co. did with these classics.",1137456000,10,1453,4.671875
458258,5,6302413850,Dino was the original hipster spy.  His dialogue is just as khitchy today as it was when it first hit the screen.  He captures the essence of being cool and yet never taking yourself too seriously.,1137024000,6,197,4.444444444444445
458259,5,6302413850,"Okay I grew up on James Bond, Derek Flint, and Matt Helm. So I say it is about time they put all the Matt Helm out together for a decent price. When ""The Silencers"" came out last year for $21.99 I thought that was a bit pricey and I am glad I waited. Don't get me wrong I love the movie, it was just overpriced. Anyone that likes campy movies or Sixties movies should enjoy this set. Fans of Austin Power's movies should get a kick out of it too. If for no other reason buy it to get a snapshot of the 1960s fashion and cars. Dean Martin was a fairly funny comedian and even if your not a fan you have to appreciate the tongue-in-cheek of these movies. These offset the serious tone of the early James Bond movies. If you enjoy these you will probably like James Coburn in ""Our Man Flint"" and ""In Like Flint"". I'm sure the gadgetry and comedy of the Helm and Flint movies influenced the later Bond movies for the better.",1136937600,14,920,4.145251396648045
458260,5,6302413850,"the matt helm movies are conected to don hamilton books by name only. i have read many of them and they were grim little thrillers more in tune with the bond books than anything else. that being said when i was growing up if a bond , a flint , or a matt helm movie came on i was there. none of the helms were what you would call top flight movies as dean martin was the whole show here. if you like him you will love these great , funny , time capsles from the sixtys, if not then you will find them hard to sit through. the silencers is by far the best with the wreaking crew being a close second murderers row is ok but is helped by having ann-margret as the female lead and the ambushers be the worst of the lot. plots and all that really make no matter as i have said dino is the entire show here and him charm carries these films the whole way.",1136505600,6,849,3.913294797687861
458261,5,6302413850,I read the reviews before purchasing and they were right on.  I've enjoyed this set as I new I would.  They're classic.  The set is thin in packaging too.  It fits well into the shelves.  @ $27 bucks this is a very fare deal. You may get it even lower eventually if you're patient like me.  If you're not then don't hesitate!,1135641600,,325,4.161290322580645
458262,5,6302413850,"I admit to having a great affinity for Dean Martin.  To me he was the essence of cool in the 1960's.  Considering he was 49 years old when he did the first Matt Helm movie, The Silencers, that's really saying a lot about his popularity and influence back during that period.  I Just loved watching these films on TV as a kid.  My brother always preferred the Bond films, but even as a youngster I appreciated the humor and charm that martin brought to his role as Super Spy Matt Helm.  The plots of the four films are almost secondary to Martin's scenery chewing, and that's just how I like it.

In ""The Silencers"" Helm, an agent for ICE (Intelligence and Counter Espionage) is out to stop the usual baddies The Big O from detonating a nuclear bomb and starting world war III.  The gorgeous Stella Stevens is along for the ride as is dancer Cyd Charisse.  Victor Buono best know as Batman villian King Tut, plays a Chinese baddie!

""Murderer's Row"" is the second Matt Helm film and this time Karl Malden plays the villian role as Julian Wall who has kidnapped a scientist with the intention of using his new device to blow up Washington D.C.  This time Dean is joined by the lovely Ann-Margaret who plays the scientist's daughter, Suzie.

""The Ambushers"" is up next and there's a lot of debate on if this film is better or worse than Murderer's Row.  I rate them this one a bit below the previous one due to there being no real top name female co-star this time.  An experimental U.s. space ship has been stolen and it's up to Matt to get it back...in-between drinking and lusting after the ladies!

The ""Wrecking Crew"" is the last Matt Helm film and I think one of the best.  It contains a bevy of 1960's beauties including Gilligan's Island's Tina Louise, along with Elke Sommer, and the late Sharon Tate.  As usual the plot of Helm trying to recover a fortune in stolen gold, is secondary to the hi-jinks of martin's character.  Bruce lee choreographed the fight scenes.

Anyone who goes into the Matt Helm films trying to take them seriously is in for trouble.  These were pure, tongue-in-cheek spoofs of spy films and a vehicle for Dino to romp with a lot of beautiful women.  Expect anything more and you will be disappointed.  But if you love Dean's 60's cool then this is a great set to have.",1124841600,158,2300,4.467625899280575
458263,4,6302413850,"It wasn't until 1971's DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER that the James Bond films decided to cut loose and have some fun, but Dean Martin had already started the Sixties spy party four times with the Matt Helm series.  The OUR MAN FLINT movies (2 of them) with James Coburn seemed hipper, partly because of Coburn's serious convinction as he went through the spy motions, but Dino's spoofs mixed the spy film with the party atmosphere of a Rat Pack show and the casual cool comedy of his TV show.

The films go from best (first) to worst (last)--but who's squawling, baby?

One of my favorite moments happens in MURDERER'S ROW, when Dean wanders into an apartment, plays a record (where he sings ""I'm Not the Marryin' Kind""), and helps himself to the bar--until a dead girl falls out of a refrigerator.  Not a big deal, but there was something incredibly hip about it.

And another review points out the purely Sixties moment when Dean, driving a wood-paneled station wagon, pushes a button to pop out a fully-stocked bar--while he's driving!

The only part of these films that rises to the level of the Bond films--hear me out--is the ladies.

Stella Stevens, already a stunning Playboy model and the incredibly sexy actress who appeared in THE NUTTY PROFESSOR, THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, and a couple of other Dino flicks, SHOULD have been a Bond girl.  Daliah Lavi and Beverly Adams (as Lovey Kravezit).  Ann Margaret and Senta Berger.  Wow.

In the least film of all, THE WRECKING CREW, you have Elke Sommer, Tina Louise, Nancy Kwan, and Sharon Tate.

A Sixties Babe-a-thon Hall of Fame right there.

If you're brand new to these films, you'll probably be a little disappointed: they're really not that good.  You'll either be mystified as Dino pulls a bag out of his trunk and builds a helicopter out of it in WRECKING CREW--or you'll laugh out loud.

But for pure Swingin' Sixties nostalgia, put on one of these DVDs, shake or stir your martini, and take a trip back to the crazy, hip universe of the super-spy Austin Powers wishes he was.",1124150400,45,2030,4.694915254237288
458264,5,6302413850,"Dean Martin's Matt Helm was a superspy who never let a good case get in the way of a drink, smoke or lady. My favorite moment in the films is when he's in his superspy car (a stationwagon) and he has a secret bar so he can drink and drive. Where else can you see a character get boozed up on the road and not have to pay the price.

This boxset was supposed to come out on August 2, and then Sony did something weird. Hopefully this will be out at the end of August so I can put it in the collection next to Our Man Flint, Danger Diabolik and Modesty Blaise.",1121990400,41,558,3.8947368421052633
458265,4,6302413850,"Murderers Row is the second installment in the Matt Helm (starring Dear Martin as Matt) series ... but probably the best out of all of them.

Dean does the tongue and cheek spy routine in this James Bond spin off from the sixties, and even entertains us with a song segment or two.

The late sixties was a era of spy spoofs/thrillers based on the phenominal success of Sean Connery as James Bond. The Helm series is a light-hearted look at the 'super spy' world. Matt's only known photo is one of his back holding a drink (It's Martin .. go figure)

If you don't expect to take the movies seriously, they can be fun. If you expect a 'Goldfinger' here, you'll be greatly disappointed.

Matt has the whimsical gadget in each movie too. This time its a gun that delays firing for a few seconds (the Silencers had the gun that shot backward). Matt/Dean uses this to great effect while battling his evil opponent's henchmen which are about one step above the 'moron' level. Still, its fun to watch.

This isn't released in DVD yet, but should be soon. When it is, it's probably the only one of the series I'll buy (The others are just too gamey for my tastes).

Gave it four stars because it was the most well done, though you may feel it doesn't rate them. Also, Dean Martin gives this particular episode a special shine. As an alternate series which is a little better done (but still a spoof) try 'In Like Flint' and 'Our Man Flint' with James Coburn.

458394,1,6302413850,"Worst adaptation of a book series ever.  Donald Hamilton's Matt Helm is a serious bad ass in the books, not in any way a clown.  Only the first film, The Silencers, was done half-way seriously, and even it did not live up to the book.  The rest of the films were simply farces and makes The Silencers look good by comparison, when it really isn't.  Believe me, each film gets progressively worse after The Silencers.  Read the books instead, starting with Death of a Citizen, and you will see what I mean. I saw all of the films in the theater when they came out, so would not waste 10 cents on this set, much less the outrageous asking price for some of the worst films ever made.  (The Matt Helm book series deserves a real adaptation of the books, done with a serious Director and leading actor, remaining true to the books.  If done right, they would make very good films, more in the nature of the Parker films.)

It's a great light hearted 'sploitation of Bondmania, with the objectification of the female curves as part and parcel of it all.  The Boob/Butt shots are typical late 1960's casting-couch, drinking-smoking Hollywood sensibilities, but they become less offensive due to a perspective given by Mike Myers' campy send up 25 years later.  You just want to yell out ""Dino, do behave!""

The four movies have a strong cast of popular late 1960's Hollywood faces.  The Wrecking Crew was the final movie of the Matt Helm series and was plagued by budget restraints, but the cast pulled it off.  The Wrecking Crew is notable for featuring Sharon Tate in her final role, and fights choreographed by Bruce Lee.  Tate's ability as a comedic actress is impressive, a nice mix of sexy and goofy.  Had she been allowed to grow old she probably would've dumped the pedophile gnome and gone on to have a career similar to, or surpassing, the likes of Goldie Hawn or Carmen Diaz.",1432857600,,1226,4.713615023474178

Good companion movie to watch before watching Austin Powers, as you can see where he borrowed a lot of ideas.

458820,4,6302413850,"I only gave these movies a four star rating based solely upon the special effects. Irving R. Levine must not have had much financing for these flicks, because the EFX were 'b"" at best. But, remember, they were spoofing the James Bond films, so I guess the special effects were also spoofing them.
  That being said, I thought the movies were enjoyable, with veteran actors throughout. I know Martin never went to rehearsals on his t.v. show, and at times I wondered if he rehearsed for the movies, Never-the-less, his impeccable timing and superb sense of humor do carry the plot along very well.
  I watched these movies in the theatre, and had to have them on dvd. The price is for all four at once so it is very reasonable,and after considering that, I didn't feel slighted. As always, I thought the service from Amazon was excellent.",1378598400,4,837,4.635135135135135

458873,5,6302413850,"The time is the sixties and spies were everywhere on the big screen,tv,books even aftershaves were spy influence (anyone remember the ads or high karate).
This series of movies were made at the height of the craze. They were tailored with Dean Martin's persona up front and in command. The stories are really comedies with Dean and some of the most beautiful actresses back then. The stories may be trite but Dean's performance carries these films.
There were four movies made and this box set has them all. The transfers are good and the audio is not up to todays standard but is still good.
I grew up around these times and recommend these films to anyone from that era and to anyone who is into sixties spy films. The craze started by the Bond films was really huge even bigger than Star Wars' influence. Cars, lighters, luggage and fashion all came to be spy influenced. There were dozens of spy movies and shows back then.
This series captures those times. The other actors around Dean were some of the best character actors around such as Victor Bouno who did a myraid of roles on film and tv Karl Malden who would be in the long running series Streets of San Francisco. The actresses were all good and did many tv and film roles. Stella Stevens,Ann Margret and Senta Berger.

There is a law of diminishing returns, but overall the movies are good escapist fare with a Dino twist.  My wife and I watched the movies over a 6 month period, rather than having a Helmathon.  They play much better that way.  Yes, by the last movie Dean Martin was getting a little old for the character, but to Dean fans, that actually added to the tongue in cheek charm.  And as a bonus, watching these movies made the Austin Powers movies seem even funnier (not because the Helms movies were bad, but because you get two different generational takes on spy spoofs.)  Maybe the package deserves four stars, but the price was right, and the set came in a convenient pack, so what's not to like?",1364342400,,792,4.4206896551724135

We all know that the Austin Powers movies were inspired by the James Bond and spy movies of the 1960's, but it's truly the Matt Helm series of the 60's that got in there first. The Matt Helm series (four in all) starring singer Dean Martin were the first movies to spoof James Bond, and spoof they dId. My hat goes off to Dean Martin who was doing his weekly television variety show at the time, as well as appearing in Las Vegas and doing these films. Unlike today's so-called stars, guys like Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra actually worked for a living. ""The Ambushers"" was Deans third movie and it's filled with lots of fun - starting with the catchy title song by Boyce and Hart - action and tons of hot curvy women. Watching this movie it became obvious where so much of the Austin Powers style was borrowed. An Oatmeal cookie probably has more smarts than the plot here, but it doesn't matter. This movie was made for fun... does anyone remember when movies had a sense of humor? I enjoyed the movie so much that I actually rented and watched it in High Def on Amazon.com.",1357257600,,1173,4.385321100917431

It has the car chases, the line of pretty girls, special gadgets, alter identities and a round bed that moves along the room and raises up so they slide into an indoor swimming pool as a wake up. It has entertainment value just hearing the Dean Martin music and watching him try to dance with Ann Margaret. Karl Malden being like a doctor Evil is okay but he looses his accent or is there an accent?",1354752000,,513,4.244897959183674

I then found out about the Matt Helm movies with Dean Martin. The complete pack is such a great value I had no issues purchasing it right away. I liked all the movies except the Wrecking Crew. The British agent that Matt gets paired up with is a clumsy spy and the gag gets old fast. Thoughout all the movies there are beautiful women and some great cars.

459258,4,6302413850,"If you weren't around in the 1960s, you may not understand the appeal of Dean Martin, who, in his day, was the most popular entertainer in America; the guy who knocked the Beatles' song ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" out of the #1 spot on the charts (with ""Everybody Loves Somebody""), star of the most watched variety show on TV, a surprisingly gifted actor, in the right film roles...for nearly a decade, no other performer could match his appeal, not Elvis, not Sinatra, no one...for a guy pushing 50, who never got past tenth grade, and was declared 'washed up' when he broke up with partner Jerry Lewis in 1956, Dino's string of successes were astonishing!

Columbia Pictures decided to capitalize on Martin's popularity, and the 'James Bond' spy craze, as well, with a series of films based on the ""Matt Helm"" espionage novels of Donald Hamilton. While Hamilton's books were gritty and realistic, however, the movies would be light-hearted spoofs, with Martin playing his screen and TV 'persona', an amiable boozer who saved the world while tossing off drinks and one-liners, and beautiful women swooned. In accepting the role, in addition to some very nice paydays, Dino had specific demands; the very short shooting schedule could not interfere with his nightclub work, TV show, or golf; and he would never have to go on location (the ""Helm"" films would highlight some of the finest second unit film work of the 60s, with glorious views of Monte Carlo, the Riviera, Acapulco, and Copenhagen...while Dino toiled away in the Burbank back lot!).

Needless to say, the ""Matt Helm"" films were never an Oscar threat, but as entertainment, they were far better than some of the schlock of the era, with some first-rate actors, hamming it up!

""The Silencers"" (1966): First of the series, introducing Martin as Helm, James Gregory as MacDonald, his boss at I.C.E., and Beverly Adams as his 'Girl Friday', Lovey Kravezit (uh-huh). A convoluted, hare-brained plot to explode a missile over an underground nuclear test site (releasing the radiation and thus initiating WWIII), offers rotund, blue-eyed Victor Buono chewing up scenery as Oriental villain Tung-Tze, sexy Daliah Lavi as a double agent, Cyd Charisse (her singing dubbed by Vicki Carr) as a doomed entertainer, and, best of all, Stella Stevens as a beautiful, if VERY clutzy innocent, drawn into the action. Martin is obviously having fun, and Stevens shows why she was as 'in demand' as a comedienne as she was as a serious actress... (3 1/2 stars, out of 5)

""Murderer's Row"" (1966): Lifting a plot element of ""You Only Live Twice"" (where 007 is 'killed'), Helm 'dies', so he can go incognito to Monte Carlo, and search for the creator of a dangerous laser beam weapon, capable of destroying Washington. He teams up with the inventor's daughter (jiggly Ann-Margret, at the peak of her 'sex kitten' phase), and the pair face off against uber-hammy villain Karl Malden, sporting a bogus accent from SOMEWHERE in Europe! Camilla Sparv is Malden's sexy henchwoman, and there's a rousing action finale aboard an out-of-control hovercraft... (4 stars, out of 5)

""The Ambushers"" (1967): A silly premise, as Helm and the female pilot of an experimental USAF 'flying saucer' (Janice Rule), search for her missing Top Secret aircraft, after she stumbles out of a Mexican jungle with amnesia, but without her ride. The film works better than you might expect, as Rule is both attractive, and a very good actress. Senta Berger is the sexy villainess, and slimy Albert Salmi is about as kinky and distasteful a bad guy as you'd ever see in a ""Helm"" film... (3 1/2 stars, out of 5)

""The Wrecking Crew"" (1969): A billion in gold is stolen, threatening to topple the economies of the free world, if Helm can't recover it! British character actor Nigel Green is a suave, if shallow villain, but it's the women who truly light up the screen; Elke Sommer, as a ruthless blonde assassin, Nancy Kwan as a calculating Chinese beauty, Tina (""Gilligan's Island"") Louise as a doomed gypsy, and, in her next-to-last film, Sharon Tate as Helm's very annoying British(!) ally. John Larch replaces James Gregory as MacDonald, and there is a bittersweet quality to the film, watching the beautiful 26-year-old Tate, who would by murdered by Charles Manson and his followers, barely six months after the film's release. (3 1/2 stars, out of 5).

Although another ""Matt Helm"" film is announced at the conclusion of ""The Wrecking Crew"" (""The Ravagers""), it was never made. The spy craze had ended, and the ""Matt Helm"" movies were losing money. After four films in three years, Martin felt it was about time to move on, and Sharon Tate's murder so upset him, he 'pulled the plug' on the series.

While Martin's later life would be tragic, ""The Matt Helm Lounge"" serves as a reminder of a happier time when Dino truly was the 'King'!",1274313600,15,4854,4.889428918590522

459328,3,6302413850,"The 4 movies in this set all feature excellent performances by Dean Martin and his lovely leading ladies, including Stella Stevens, Ann-Margret, Janice Rule and Sharon Tate. Each movie also features at least one ""exotic"" villain, played with an excruciatingly bad fake accent. In ""The Silencers"", it's Victor Buono as Tung-Tze, a total failure of acting, make-up, etc. --  he is meant to be Asian but doesn't look or sound even remotely Asian, and his acting is lousy all round. In ""Murderer's Row"", it is Karl Malden's turn and he doesn't seem to be quite sure what nationality his character is meant to be. ""The Ambushers"" has three equally unconvincing foreign villains, an Indian and two Latin Americans. The final movie in the set is ""The Wrecking Crew"", in which Nigel Green plays an Italian Count with an accent right out of a castle in the south of England. Mind you, the accent aside, his acting is of a much higher standard than that of the others mentioned. The villains also get some very poorly-written dialogue, which makes their poor acting and fake accents seem even worse.  Apart from those weaknesses, though, the movies aren't too bad. They are a lot of fun and Dean Martin is always good value, especially when surrounded by beautiful women. I would have liked to have heard more singing from the great crooner, though  --  all we get are a few snippets here and there, mostly brief fragments of well-known songs, usually with the words altered to fit the action in the film.

459329,1,6302413850,"If my memory serves me right, I seem to remember seeing bits and pieces of these films on television as I was growing up.  By the time, though, that I finally saw enough of one to really understand, I had made the wonderful discovery of Donald Hamilton's Matt Helm novels.  After reading only two of Hamilton's tough, spare writing style about the cynical counterintelligence agent pulled back reluctantly back into service when things get too close to his family, I could never again watch these movies without wincing in pain every moment.

I guess Irwin Allen thought he couldn't create an American counterpart to Fleming's James Bond, so he decided to spoof him. Even as a parody it's painful.  (Humorist P.J. O'Rourke, explains parody this way:  ""Good parody is where pull something a part completely, and then reassemble it backwards and it still works.)

And yet even in the books Hamilton displays a self-awareness of the comparisons to Bond and the films.  This is especially evdident in the Ravagers, with a very dry, tongue-in-cheek humor that runs all through the story, and yet never overwhelms the grit and danger that were Hamilton's hallmark.

If you can completely turn off your brain, maybe these movies will be funny, but even for most intelligent people, it's too tough to suspend that much disbelief.",1231459200,,1321,4.9457013574660635
459330,2,6302413850,"Hollywood producer Irving Allen must rank as second only to the executive at Decca records who turned down The Beatles as one of the entertainment industry's great heroic failures. In 1958, while in partnership with Harry Saltzman, he turned down a chance to buy the screen rights to James Bond, informing Ian Fleming his novels would not make good films. Saltzman later teamed with Albert R. Broccolli, re approached Fleming and the rest is history, while Mr. Allen undoubtedly gritted his teeth at the success he so misguidedly let slip by.

Determined to grab a consolation prize, Allen subsequently obtained the rights to Donald Hamilton's Matt Helm novels with a view to a film franchise to rival that of 007. Hamilton's books are gritty cynical thrillers about a CIA operative turned private detective, far removed from the colourful world of the Bond films. Allen wanted an American James Bond with glamour, gadgets and women, with a greater emphasis on spoof/comedy thrills to compete with Bond's more sophisticated tongue in cheek humour. Matt Helm was made over accordingly.

The Silencers (1966) borrowed the title and little else from the Hamilton novel (as would be the case with the later films) though material from another Helm novel , Death of a Citizen, was also utilised. Rather than cast a serious actor in the lead, Allen turned to crooner turned movie star, Dean Martin to fill the criteria of super suave agent. A former second banana to Jerry Lewis, Dino was very much nearing the end of his movie career and appears to daydream through most of the film, usually to one of his own songs of the soundtrack. The CIA became the fictional ICE, while Helm is initially a semi retired agent turned photographer. Helm reluctantly returns to ICE after the enemy organisation, BIGO, attempts to kill him. Victor Buono played the main villain as a Doctor No type complete with Asian makeover. The main gadget of the film is a gun that fires backwards - no kidding!

Murder's Row followed in 1967, retaining the main premise of the novel (kidnapped scientist) and moving the action from Chesapeake Bay to Monte Carlo. It borrowed a plot device from that year's Bond (You Only Live Twice) in which Helm fakes his own death at the opening of the film. It also featured a steel headed villain who Helm eventually defeats with a giant industrial magnet ... just as 007 would do with Jaws ten years later. Well he is entitled to borrow from his imitators once in a while.

The Ambushers (1968) was also modelled on You Only Live Twice with a plot involving hijacked spacecraft and Helm faking his own assassination. The resultant film is probably the least of the bunch with dull, plodding direction and the weakest visual gags including a cigarette that produces laughing gas!

The Wrecking Crew (1969) is the last and least remembered of the four, which is a pity in some ways as the series seemed to be getting its act into some sort of order. The tighter paced script took itself a little more seriously and boasted a classier villain in Nigel Greene, almost reprising his role from Deadlier Than The Male. Confident, perhaps, that they were finally getting it right, Allen had the closing titles proclaim Helm's impending return in The Ravagers. It proved a misplaced confidence. Dean Martin decided to quit the role and while actors James Franciscus and Adam West (TV's Batman) were briefly considered as replacements, the backing studio, Columbia, felt that the super spy bubble had now burst. The latest 007, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, was just scraping in a profit and being perceived as a failure. Of course, this situation would quickly turn around.

Six years later, Allen attempted reviving his Matt Helm franchise as a possible TV series with Tony Francisco. A pilot, simply titled Matt Helm, relocated the character back into a more realistic crime thriller as a former CIA agent turned private eye. With a low budget and the other usual restrictions on 1970s TV films, it proved an unmemorable comeback and no more were made.

For the record, Warner Bros have been talking about resurrecting Matt Helm to follow the success of the Bourne films. So far, it remains just talk.",1229558400,3,4204,4.863128491620111

The gorgeous giggly girls were fun. Based on Donald Hamilton's MATT HELM books. This was Columbia attempt to cash in on the 60's spy genre. These films follow the basic BOND recipe: hedonistic agent, luscious ladies, gadgets, goons, and world shattering dilemmas.

Previous to ordering this collection I had seen all these films in my youth since I suffer from terminal BONDage. They are interesting fare with loads of fun moments, girls, and goofy gadgets. The films are carried by Dean with his laid-back delivery and boozing and womanizing ways.

This set of four films is precisely what I expected! Good old-fashion fun with Deano. Great for any movie collection. I do not like the Austin Powers movies, I find them absurd and vulgar.

459494,4,6302413850,"This is a great collection of movies for both Matt Helm and Dean Martin fans.  Most viewers will find Dean Martins' slightly comedic approach to the Matt Helm character very entertaining.  In addition to some pretty funny moments, the movies are also full of clever songs, such as ""When Your Sweetheart Puts A Pistol in her Pillow.""

 These movies provide a fascinating look at American culture of the 1960s.  They contain old cars, scantily clad women, and a surplus of sexual innuendo.  The behavior exhibited by Dean Martin is also rather interesting.  In a scene from ""The Silencers"", he rips the dress off of Stella Stevens as an incentive for her to start talking.  Today, such behavior would be called ""assault.""  In another movie, Dean is drinking from a flask while driving his car and receiving instructions from Headquarters.  Obviously, drinking and driving was not an issue in the 1960s.  These films contain some of the big name actresses of the day, such as Stella Stevens, Ann Margaret, and Sharon Tate.  Sharon Tate, unfortunately, is better known for being murdered by Charles Manson and his family.

The quality of the movies is excellent and there were no problems with the DVDs.  All four DVDs fit into two slim containers.  The entire collection fits into one box the size of a normal DVD case.  Unfortunately, the set has the appearance of a rental from the local video store, vice something that was intended for sale.  ""The Silencers"" contain several movie trailers for unrelated films such as ""Fun with Dick and Jane.""  There is no trailer for ""The Silencers.""  The other movies do contain Matt Helm movie trailers, but not on the disk of that movie.  The set also contains multiple trailers for ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"" and an upcoming release of the Seinfeld DVDs.  Finally, one DVD came with a small anti theft tag used to prevent shoplifting.

Despite these minor anomalies, this is a very entertaining set of movies.  Dean Martin is as enjoyable now as he was in the 1960s.  The viewer can certainly see how these films were a likely source of inspiration for the Austin Powers movies.",1176681600,11,2125,4.838888888888889

Dean Martin did four Matt Helm films. These films were all tongue and cheek, all done for laughes..always poking the spy genre in the eye. These four films in this collection have action with so much comedy twists. If you want humor with a 60's bent, this is it.

Martin slick Helm is fun to watch. He essays the Helm role with a girl in his bed, a martini and satire humor (One film the girl is listening to Frank Sinatra-Martin deadpans ""You like Perry Como?""). These are cute thrillers will no real substance, but you don't  go to an Austin Powers movies for a real mystery either.

459671,3,6302413850,"Solidly anchored in the superficial, non psychedelic part of the 60s, the perfectly named MATT HELM LOUNGE (Sony) is a four DVD set (The Silences, Murderers' Row, The Ambushers and The Wrecking Crew) that features Dean Martin as Matt Helm, the wise-cracking, boozing, smoking, singing, swinging, fighting, seducing secret agent who never gets his well-oiled hair mussed.

Cool, urbane and loaded with an arsenal of handy double-entendres, Martin's Helm is a James Bond parody who fights evil geniuses with world dominating schemes all the while sorting through a bevy of good and bad beauties wearing exotic, often skimpy attire. That's the formula for these sexy, silly spy romps, replete with generous samplings of Martin's trademark crooning.

The best of the lot is 1966's The Silencers. The first title in the series has Helm up against a villain who wants to take over the world by starting World War III.  Stella Stevens is his klutzy, knock-out cohort.

It's interesting that these films with their then preposterous plots are now issues we have already faced or fears for which we are on alert.  For instance, in Murderers' Row, a diabolical mastermind threatens to incinerate the heart of Washington, D.C.  Remember the diverted 9/11 plane?

As someone else mentioned, the Station Wagon spy car has a hidden bar with several bottles so Dean doesn't need to worry about running out of ammunition.  The joke they missed was calling the hidden bottles of booze his ""seat belts"".

In another movie he's got a more sporty car, and in a chase scene you see one of that cars unique gadgets - he picks up a microphone and says ""If you can read this, you're too close"" and the message scrolls across the tail lights...

I do see where these movies were an inspiration for the Austin Powers series.

My guess is these movies will be appreciated most by folks who remember Dean Martin, and I think they wouldn't be a bad choice for kids because while there's some suggestive stuff, it's tame by todays standards - though obviously the ""don't drink and drive"" message should be discussed.",1154304000,3,1041,4.429319371727749

More money to be made!  This Matt Helm set is a perfect example: four discs in two ""slim line"" cases, together only slightly thicker than a single regular DVD case!  It is great to get so much product in such a small amount of space. Now if they could just re-package the previous several hundred DVD's I've bought which are housed in cases perhaps eight times bigger than necessary.  I have had to stop buying DVd's due to space limitations; if everything had come in this type of packaging I'd have plenty of room for hundreds more.

Look, if you like the 60's, the women, the styles, the music, the overall feel....you're going to love these beautiful movies. Lots of Dean Martin here at his most likeable and lots of amazingly beautiful women (from an era when beautiful women were natural entities and not products of surgery and science). My wife and I both liked the fashions and the cars as well. Many exotic locales and elaborate sets.  (These are not low budget movies by any means.) There are substantial samplings of Dean's music and lots of playful jabs at Sinatra.  Picture quality is excellent. The colors are super vibrant. The sound on the first disc sounded a little muted for a few minutes, but then the rest sounded great.

These movies are just totally fun.  Pour yourself a cocktail and join Deano on one of his hammy adventures.

459738,4,6302413850,"Overall, 4 stars. Great value and great campy entertainment.

It is common knowledge to film geeks that Matt Helm was the number one inspiration for Austin Powers. Why is the boozy, greasy, aging Dean Martin a chick magnet? Why doesn't he appear to do anything but bumble around looking for chicks and drinky's yet somehow always manage to save the world? Why are the film's sexist attitudes so wonderfully abomidable?

The productions for the films range from pretty darn good to nearly inept, but that doesn't stop them from being mighty entertaining. These are pure, beautiful cheese. Sometimes the makers know it, and sometimes they don't.

1. The Silencers. 3 stars The first one. Worst(best?) villain of the lot, care of Victor Buono (King Tut from the 1960's Batman series). Buono plays Tung Tze, apparently a blond, blue eyed chinese fella with a full beard who drinks canned egg foo young.

2. Murderers Row. 3 stars. Pretty good followup...this time Matt goes to europe and gets involved in dames, murder and the destruction of the planet. It's good to see the great Karl Malden get work, but he's a terrible villain. There's a brain-meltingly screechy laser beam at the end that melts rock but moves at a snails pace. I must go back in time and KILL that foley artist.

3. The Ambushers. 5 STARS!!! Wha--? Are you kidding me, reviewers? This is definately the best of the bunch! Dean finally feels really comfortable in the part and the production team knows exactly what they're doing. James Gregory's last gravely appearance as McDonald. As the villian, Albert Salmi is easily the best in the series...the only one who actually conveys a sense of danger. The score is the best, too - twangy-surf-spy throughout, courtesy of early Hugo Montenegro..and Dean only sings once. There's a breezy sense of fun and campiness througout that seems to have reached its apex in this third movie.

I said 5 stars, dammit!

4. The Wrecking Crew. TWO STARS. Just watched this last night, the capper on the wonderful world of Matt Helm. Unfortunately, the thrill is gone in the last of series. The script and overall production is the weakest of the bunch (yeah - tricky how they manage that). Dean sleep walks through the picture even more than usual...you can tell he just wanted the cameras to stop rolling and get the hell outta there. After only a few years since the last one, Dean has visiably aged and visibly slowed.  Montenegro's score is terrible and irritating...it's the saccharine ""bah bah bah bah"" chorus era of pop music and it's frequently a feeble mismatch for the action on screen. Nigel Green is not a particularly great villain either. However, the film IS notable for the co-stars: Sharon Tate, Nancy Kwan, Chuck Norris (one of the henchmen at the restaurant)...and fight choreography by Bruce Lee. As one of the reviewers noted above, it's hardly something Bruce would like included on his resume, since the fighting is just inept. Watching Dean (and his co-stars) try to high kick is either very funny or just embarrassing...possibly the worst fight scenes I've ever seen in a major motion picture.

Scenes of interest:

---I liked the revolving Chinese restaurant booth. Wonderfully pointless and silly.

---Best part: where Dean puts together the complicated portable helicopter in about 30 seconds. He IS amazing!

---I liked that whenever an explosion goes off inside, a tangle of smoky grey rubble falls down all over the place. Brilliant.

---no attempt whatsoever in trying to make the rear projection train chase realistic.

---most use of gratuitous Dean singing in the series. Like 6 instances of singing where least appropiate.

---no jokes at the expense of Frank Sinatra this time.",1147824000,9,4350,5.063113604488079

For now, I can only speak of my experience watching ""The Wrecking Crew"" and, although a somewhat cheesy spy spoof, I enjoyed the comedy contained within.  (Friendly tidbit: ""The Wrecking Crew"" was not Sharon Tate's final film.

The box set is a must-have for anyone who remembers these films fondly or wants to complete their collection of 60's spy memorobilia. While I wish there could have been lots of extras and behind the scenes, these films come from an era where Hollywood was not quite as ready to let you glimpse behind the curtain so there is little archival material available, and all of the principle actors are deceased making commentary impossible. They are represented well, however, in these excellent transfers. The clear sound and precise letterbox picture with fantastic color and clarity leave behind any previous broadcast. While The Silencers and Murderer's Row are unquestionably the strongest entries, there are great momements to be found in The Ambushers and particularly the little-scene Wrecking Crew, which was Sharon Tate's last film. Get this collection and dissappear for a few hours into the world of Comic Book spies where everything is in Brilliant Color, the girls are always elegantly coiffed, the cars had chrome and Dean Martin as gadget toting, hard drinking and smoking Matt Helm suavely saves the day.",1143331200,7,1348,5.044843049327354
459742,4,6302413850,One of the best tongue in cheek spy series made with Martin just seeming to be having alot of fun doing the pictures. Seemingly primitive special effects compared to todays offerings but if you just go with the story and pay attention for the subtle humor makes for a very entertaining movie.,1142985600,,292,4.634615384615385
459743,5,6302413850,"I was very pleased with the expediancy in delivery and I love the DVD's.  Have only watched the first two so far but they are exactly what I wanted and I was really pleased to have them.  They are real sixties nostalgia stuff with heaps of exciting action and cool ""James Bond"" type gadgets.  Lots of fun!!",1142726400,,306,4.333333333333333
459744,5,6302413850,"This is a great set of movies. You get four for the price of just the ""Silencers"" if you buy it seperately. And with each movie Dean Martin gets drunker...You can't beat that!

Each movie has a super hip popculture theme. The ""Silencer's"" is Burlesque and starts out with a classic Strip Tease scene. The movie is full of cheese and puns and Matt Helm a.k.a. Dean Martin getting some... My favorite rewindable scene is the oversized round bed that rises up and dumps him into his lavish pool/bath, to be scrubbed up by his sexy secretary...

Hilarious!

Also, this movie has a great ""Secret Spy"" gun that fires backwards, and a girl who uses that to her advantage, much to the surprise of her pursuing foes.

The second movie ""Murderers Row"" has a Go-Go Mod theme, with an opening segment of dancing, sexy, brightly colored, and psychedelic silhouttes. This movie holds another bed rising up moment, and even more great puns. Matt spends a lot of time drinking and driving in his fancy suped up station wagon, complete with a fully stocked bar. And there are plenty of great Go-Go dancing scenes.

The third movie ""The Ambushers"" has a tropical feel, with Matt being sent to Acapulco. Great Monkee's-like pop music, (the song was actually written by the Monkee's song-writers), on the opening scene. There are some pretty intese scenes, especially at the end when the Flying Saucer is sent speeding down a train track at top speed, and Matt has to save the girl who is in it!!

The fourth movie ""The Wrecking Crew"" has a cool pop art opening, and cheesy 60's pop music. Matt's unhelpful and clumsy side kick adds a great element of hilarity and frustration. There's a great ""karate?"" scene in this one with two cute vixens. Oh, and by this point, Dean Martin has many moments of unitelligble dialogue, due to his being totally plastered during the filming of these movies. Or so it seems he was.....

If you like great Spy Satire movies like ""In Like Flint"", Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine"", and ""Fathom"", you'll love this set.

Be sure to have your favorite cocktail makings on hand though... You can't watch these movies without one!",1142380800,7,2140,4.688
459745,5,6302413850,"in most of dean's later movies he seemed to just be going thru the motions of making a movie and didn't try to act very much and some of his films are hurt because of it. not so the matt helm movies. some how his non acting fits right into the wild far out stories of the 60's super spys. these films are great fun if you like dean ,because he's the whole show here if you don't like him you'll hate these movies.

  i read the matt helm books as well as the bond books growing up and these helm movies are not even close to the grim tough little thrillers of don hamilton. like bond the movies go for gagets guns women and far out plots. still i like dean and i like the movies.

  the silencers-the first and maybe the best of the helm movies  with great help from stella stevens as his woman of choise.

  murderers row- great cast but not as good as the first film. saved by having ann-margret as helms woman of choise here.

  the ambushers-the worst of the series with no big name co-stars and dean looks and acts tired of the role.

  the wrecking crew- the last film of the series is a return to some of the best bits of the silencers and has the late sharon tate as helms girl friday in this one. this one has a strange feel about it as mrs. tate would soon become more famous in death at the hands of the mansion family. still this showed that she was a good actor and had a nice future in movies had she lived.

  all in all this collection is just great and should make super spy fans happy",1142380800,2,1502,4.0476190476190474

459747,4,6302413850,"After Austin Powers was released a few years ago, the 60's superspy movies became all the rage with the Our Man Flint series leading the way.  Unfortunately this brilliant series starring Dean Martin went virtually unnoticed, for reasons I will never understand.  This series was amazing and in my opinion was superior to all of the other swinger agent movies.  Austin Powers ripped off so many things from Matt Helm they probably didn't want this series known about so they might have seemed original.  MAtt Helm's cover is a photographer just like Austin Powers, The second Matt Helm Movie features the machine gun bra, and there are a number of other ""similarities"". Dean Martin is great as secret agent Matt Helm, basically playing himself, except of course that he's a superspy.  Instead of guns in his superspy car he has a wet bar.

  The women of Matt Helm are beautiful, sexy and everything you would want from your spy movie.  Stella Stevens, Tina Louis, Ann Margret, Else Sommer, Sharon Tate, Nancy Kwan just to name a few.

  The plotlines are outlandish, and the villians are cut in the mold of Goldfinger and Dr. No...but funny.

  Pour yourself a gin and tonic or a whiskey on the rocks and ride along with Matt Helm.",1140652800,2,1232,4.71830985915493
