8152661,5,B000JQVAL8,"My children love learning the ASL signing with Rachel, Alex and Leah.  Not only does it encourage acceptance of those who have disabilities being it hearing or otherwise but helps reinforce our ability to excel and learn for fun and to benefit others if the opportunity exists.  My children are blessed with hearing but we frequently play in a public playground close to a school for the deaf and blind and when the children see the deaf children signing they try to talk with them by signing and the deaf children smile with delight and return the signing.  It's heartwarming for all and hopeful for me as a parent that one or all of my children will continue to develop the signing as a second language and be able to use it throughout their life.",1388707200,,749,4.533333333333333

8152663,4,B000JQVAL8,"This DVD is a great way for your child to learn how to finger spell. It would have been nice if they would have included some of the songs like they do in all the other DVD's to make it a little more appealing and a fun and entertaining way to learn. Otherwise, good DVD.",1214784000,2,271,3.9454545454545453
