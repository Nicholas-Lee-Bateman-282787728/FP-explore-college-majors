5145956,1,B008AY5FDK,"It starts out with the belly dancing.  No introduction or explanation of how to do anything,  Not for beginners.",1431043200,,112,4.842105263157895
5145957,4,B008AY5FDK,"As always Neon delivers a great dance experience. I don't think I've been able to find a teacher as good as she is. She always says that every dancer has there own strength and teaching is her's. Although I don't care much for her dance style when she isn't teaching. I wouldn't say this DVD is ""a Piece of Cake"" but it is fun.

The pros:
Neon talks you through the moves and gives good technique reminders throughout. I personally love this because i'm not always sure what to do with my head or my hands. I'm not usually into a one teacher experience if there are three people pictured, but this time it seemed okay. I really enjoyed the music the mix of fast and slow was a good change of pace. I didn't mind the black background actually. Neon is always wearing pink and since she's the only ""teacher"" I didn't pay much attention to the other two, so seeing them or not wasn't a big deal to me. Pink wearing Neon is always easy to see.

The Cons:
Ouch, my legs and arms hurt after doing the workout, this may change as I get more used to the workout and the dance experience. Right now though it hurts to hold my arms in neutral position for as long as I have to and occasionally I just have to move them even when she isn't. I walk up and down stairs a lot so all the lunges etc hurt my legs after awhile. Again this may change as I get more used to the workout.

I really missed the practice flow section she has on both Hard Candy and Love Potion, I felt like simply jumping into the workout was detrimental to me. I'm still not sure how to do a few moves and I've been working with the DVD for a bit now. The Tutorial was a bit too short and didn't cover everything, that I could see I haven't watched all of it, but I was looking for the cross steps and a few other moves and couldn't find them.

Overall the music and the moves are all here it gives a great dance experience even if you are already taking classes. If you are looking for a ""teacher"" give her a shot she is very good.",1398470400,4,1993,4.089514066496164
5145958,5,B008AY5FDK,"As promised, Neon and her associates always deliver beautiful performances. She not only teaches you belly dance movements but the way to make your body glide, increasing your feelings of health and wellbeing. Arrived quickly, safely and was well affordable.",1377388800,2,258,5.475
5145959,5,B008AY5FDK,"Have enjoyed all the ""flow dance"" videos from Neon and her team. The costumeing is fun to watch and dancing beautiful",1361750400,,117,4.619047619047619
5145960,5,B008AY5FDK,"Piece of Cake is an enjoyable way to wind down and get some movement in after sitting at work all day!  It is a great beginner dvd. After work I often don't feel like a strenuous workout, but I do want to get some movement in..... this is great for that!  So if you don't want a meat and potatoes work out, get a Piece of Cake.  Have fun!  Belly dance!
I like to rotate my dvds so that it is not repetitive.  I use beginner dvds on days that I just don't have enough ""oomph"" to put into the others.  Shimmy on!",1353456000,8,510,3.9029126213592233
5145961,5,B008AY5FDK,"Neon leads a 50 minute workout of beginner belly dance moves using short, easy to follow combinations to build sequences. Viewers have the option of watching the workout with voice cues from Neon or with just the music and dancing. There is also 25 minutes of technique breakdown at the end.

WHAT I LOVED ABOUT THIS DVD

This is a great resource for beginner dancers because it teaches while moving. The majority of DVDs break down technique first before offering real practice to music. While this can be one of the best ways to learn the dance I think it's beneficial to include different approaches too, and there really aren't many DVDs that can offer this alternative. A well balanced student should have experience learning movements on the fly, and be comfortable trying steps they might not have seen before. Neon does an excellent job of building combinations to give viewers a chance of working up to the full range of movement. For beginners the level of challenge should be well balanced. And, if there's something you don't understand during the workout, you can always review the technique section at the end.

OTHER FEATURES I LIKED

- The music. World Dance New York generally does a great job of using real, high quality music and this DVD is no exception. There's no elevator music happening here- experienced fans will find artists they recognize. There's also a great variety of pop, fusion, and more traditional pieces. You'll dance to slow and sensual pieces from Egypt and fast and flirty songs from Turkey.
- The instruction. I always like Neon's explanation of movements because she's a technical dancer. She breaks down everything into step by steps and then builds it up to a whole. Yes, I'm a little biased because this is how I tend to teach, too.
- And it's pretty. I like the costumes that Neon, Jenna Rey, and Elisheva wear during the workout. The imagery of cake and other delicious food items is carried through to the DVD menus. Yum!

A NOTE OF CAUTION

The label and description on this DVD were a little confusing. It's probably just because this program offers something very different that doesn't fit well into common categories and labels. I found the word ""workout"" didn't really fit for me. This isn't really your typical workout DVD. Someone who is looking for serious calorie burning and muscle toning using belly dance moves might be disappointed. However, someone who is looking for belly dance moves that help them tone and burn calories will be much happier. This is genuine belly dancing, not the zumba-fied stuff you often find on belly dance workout DVDs. I think this is a good thing- I just think the cover might not communicate it very well.

SUMMARY: I would recommend this DVD to beginner level students who are looking to become more well rounded dancers. This DVD will teach you movements by building them into combinations. You'll work on your musicality and transitions in context. It will also help you tone the muscles you need to execute these movements effectively.

Full Disclaimer: I received a free copy of this DVD from World Dance New York. The choice to review this DVD is my own. The opinions above are an honest reflection of my experience with this DVD.",1349654400,9,3228,4.793165467625899
5145962,5,B008AY5FDK,"I have been working out to Piece of Cake Belly Dance Workout for beginners for several weeks. This program has been effective in toning and strengthening my body. Best yet, the lovely belly dance movement with its varied range of motion is mixed into fun, delightful choreographies.
Topping off the six dance workout sections is a lyrical cool down section that is all about beautiful flowing movements that stretch the arms, shoulders, and spine while deep lunges strengthen lower body extremities.  It's easy to be lured in by the music, which makes the workout appear so subtle, yet the impact is soon felt as the toning begins to set in.

A tutorial section is included and eases anyone from basic foundations into choreographies that build gradually with enough repetition to create a very enjoyable work out for the entire body.",1348099200,3,834,4.95
5145963,5,B008AY5FDK,"Belly dancing is the loveliest form of exercise I know of, and it is also a beautiful art form; it is so graceful, and tones and strengthens your muscles while also gently stretching your body and giving you agility. It is perfect for all ages, and this DVD is a great start for beginners. If you've never danced a step in your life, or if you're a once active senior who wants to get rejuvenated and moving again, this DVD won't overwhelm you with complicated choreography and difficult workouts. It's also terrific conditioning for someone who is further along in their studies.

The workout is excellent, set to a variety of rhythmic music, and with Neon's detailed instruction to help you with each step. Once you learn the instructions, there is the option of practicing the steps with just the music. The steps are basic and can easily be followed, and Neon is assisted by Teena Ray and Elisheva in this portion.

For learning all the basic positions and techniques, Neon teaches a long tutorial, which gives everything from correct posture to doing those dazzling shimmies. Neon is an exquisite dancer, and you simply can't do better than learn from her. Production is good with a simple black background for the workout and pastel colors for the tutorial. Music includes pieces by DJ Zen, Drumspyder, Doug Adamz, Adham Shaikh, and Phil Thornton.",1347148800,7,1353,4.827586206896552
5145964,3,B008AY5FDK,"Unfortunately, I received a dvd that skipped on section 2. However, from what I was able to see, compared to the quality of Love Potion, Hard Candy, and Luscious, this workout (although for beginners ) was not done with the same finesse.
The black background made it difficult to see, and the same moves from the dvds are used over and over again. Unless something new was added in the section that skipped, Love Potion is your best bet.",1346976000,,437,4.544303797468355

5145972,5,B008AY5FDK,"The title of this is a little misleading.  I took some bellydancing lessons over 20 years ago so I know the difference between a hip lift and a hip drop.  This will be difficult if you've never had a lesson and are unfamiliar with the moves, but for a natural dancer or someone who picks up choreography quickly it really will be a piece of cake.
The main dancer and narrator is beautiful and graceful, she's really interesting to watch.
The nice thing about this is you don't need any special zumba sneaker slide thingys or even sneakers for that matter.  I did this in bare feet and no sports bra.  It is a good workout for your arms; I had to drop mine frequently.  There are some deep bends and lunges, but I just did what was comfortable and still worked up a sweat.  I will try this again.  It's fun, give it a try!",1462233600,2,821,4.2243589743589745
5145973,2,B008AY5FDK,"This was a bit of a tutorial, but not one for someone who either has never done these moves with a trainer before, nor for someone who was actually looking for a workout.  There was not much step-by-step instruction in this, just a whole lot of ""move like this, then this, then this..."".  I guess it would be a good refresher video for someone who had already done this type of thing.  But it was also kind of unenthusiastic.  Really, I got more of a workout laughing at myself and the ridiculousness of the situation than I did trying to do the motions.",1462060800,,554,4.349514563106796
5145974,3,B008AY5FDK,"It goes very fast and builds upon itself. I'm in shape and coordinated and it was tough (just keeping the arms out was exhausting after 20m). I thought it was too long and didn't allow enough time to explore the movement, it seemed more like a performance than a how-to. Though I'm sure she'd do much harder things if it were a performance.",1461196800,,340,4.412698412698413

Of course, learning the moves are hard at the beginning, but so is everything else when learning something new.  The moves are fun and flirtatious! Plus, the video is a great workout. I didn't even think about how much I moved my body until I stopped. My muscles reminded me of the amount of exercise I got from feeling sore, especially in my arms- wow!",1457654400,,444,4.525
5145978,5,B008AY5FDK,"I tend to jump into the deep end of the pool first and figure out how to swim afterward. This dvd facilitates that habit of mine while simultaneously keeping me from drowning. I learn some basic moves and poses and it has a feeling of dancing to it even though it's not performance choreography.  It's whipping my muscles into shape and although I don't know if I've lost weight, I see my body shape changing in a very good way. This dvd is wonderful when you just want to move instead of drilling basic moves in isolstion. And of course, I'm sure I look just as fantastic as the dancers do in their beautiful costumes. As long as there's not a mirror around to disprove me, I know I must look fantastic. I feel fantastic. Great fun and great training for impatient people like me.",1451952000,6,781,4.386206896551724
