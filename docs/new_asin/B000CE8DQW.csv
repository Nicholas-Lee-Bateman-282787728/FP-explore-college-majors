8098035,3,B000CE8DQW,"PRO: I've forgotten how great Tony Little's workouts are, especially for those who are seriously out of shape, which I am. It's more quality than quantity. Most videos today can run from 30hr. to an hr. With Tony Little's workouts I'm done in half that time, and I don't feel like a failure because I can't get through the workout, because I'm not a former back up dancer- -which I'm sure most of the people you see working in the background are.

CON: I thought this was a new DVD series. If you have the BODY EXPRESS series, don't bother, essentially they're the same. Among my favorites in his series are FAT FREE and PRIVATE SESSIONS.",1366156800,,638,4.5
8098036,5,B000CE8DQW,"I have worked out to Tony Little's strength-training DVDs for years and he's one of the best trainers out there.  Strenght-training is his specialty as he's been training and competing for years.  After 3 months of working out to one of his DVDs you will notice tight, hard muscles everywhere.  It's something you'll notice without even trying.  That's proof that he incorporates effective exercises into his DVDs and does them correctly.  The full length of the workout is 33 mins and the actual strengh-training (minus the warm-up and cool-down) is 25 mins.  His ""Rock the Circuit"" DVD takes the training portion up to 31 mins.  After you finish the first 3 months, he says you can alternate amoung him many DVDs to maintain your muscles and tone.  This is a hard workout, but it's not a really long workout like some others.  However, if you want a lot of tone on all you muscles and then want to maintain it, this will definitely do the job.

His personality is also a huge plus, because it makes it enjoyable.  He's upbeat, jokes around and is just one of those rare charismatic people.  Top DVD for strength-training without a doubt.",1324166400,,1139,4.696969696969697
8098037,3,B000CE8DQW,"Ignore the Frank up there. I am a woman talking here.

I have a pretty draconian exercise regime and was wanting to add circuit training to it. This is a good workout for when you have little time (it takes about 1/2 hour). Tony is very personable and motivating.

The problem was that it became TOO easy after about 3 weeks. I went from beginner to advanced in about two weeks and from 5lb dumbells to 10lbs dumbells. He hints at a third level DVD, but I haven't been able to find it.

I recommend doing this on alternate days and doing something like ""The Firm""  (Which is killer hard) on other days.",1146182400,2,602,4.300884955752212
