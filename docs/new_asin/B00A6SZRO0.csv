5384592,5,B00A6SZRO0,"This is the breath of fresh air the horror genre needed.  I didn't expect to like this movie so much when I saw the local screening, but I absolutely loved it.  I thought, how could a movie that is so grounded to original horror routes actually keep me entertained and entranced without a big movie budget?  Between the beautiful well thought out shots and gore, it was pretty easy.  Never mind if you're a horror nut, I recommend picking this up to see a really good movie all around.

5 out of 5 stars for this one.",1358035200,3,517,4.288659793814433
5384593,5,B00A6SZRO0,"Finally a horror movie that actually delivers!!! This movie scared the s*** out of me, almost literally. A great movie that does pay homage to old school horror flicks. Jason Christopher really hit the nail on the head with this one. Blood, gore, guts, and just a great time had while watching this movie. I can not wait to own this and add it to my collection. This directer is a star on the rise. Kudos indeed for such a great and enjoyable horror ride. I can't wait to see what he lets out next.",1357689600,2,498,4.252631578947368
5384594,5,B00A6SZRO0,"I wasn't really sure what I expected to see when I went to a local screening of this, but I must say I was blown away!!!!! I give this two thumbs up! I used to suggest this movie to people all the time, and say wait till there is another screening you have to go and see it. I'm excited to now be able to suggest people now buy it on DVD, and I can't wait to own it and watch again. A must see, you won't be disappointed!!!",1357430400,3,423,3.764044943820225
5384595,5,B00A6SZRO0,"Guys- on a date night, bring over this movie. You gonna get laid. ;) girls be screamin' and s***! This ain't no Snoop Dogg feature like ""bones"" this is the real deal son! I never lie on the Internet. This movie is legit! I'm a grown man and it frightens me.",1356912000,2,257,4.0588235294117645
5384596,5,B00A6SZRO0,"Saw it about a year ago and it totally blew my mind.  I went in thinking it was going to be a crappy c-rated slasher and ended up on the edge of my seat. Very well shot, very creative story with great twists.  I highly recommend this movie to any slasher fan!",1356566400,2,259,3.9615384615384617
5384597,4,B00A6SZRO0,"I have been seeing some great retro-horror indie films lately.  With ""The Sleeper"", ""The Victim"", ""Hobo with a Shotgun"", it seems that indie filmmakers are finding a way to bring back some classic styles without doing remakes!  BRAVA!  The latest in this list is Jason Christopher's ""Nobody Gets Out Alive"".  In the great tradition of the early ""Friday the 13th films"", a group of over-sexed twenty-somethings head on a camping trip in spite of the local legend of a killer in the woods.  Christopher puts a fresh face on the killer-in-the-woods subgenre without forgetting its roots. ""I think the horror community will really like this flick. It's an homage film!"" (Christopher).  That it is ... and, very well done on top of that.

While homage films are not striving to be original, ""Nobody Gets Out Alive"" gives us a few things indie-slasher fans haven't seen yet.  Yea, a bunch of drunk people in the woods ... the first few disappear ... leading quickly to all out, run for your life killing.  Ok ... seen it.  But, first of all, this film does it well.  Christopher did his homework.  ""I'm a horror fan, my favorites are oldies like, ""Black Christmas"" (`74), ""Friday The 13th Part 3"", ""Halloween"" (`78), ""The Prowler"". And I think that shows in the flick"" (Christopher).  Don't worry ... it does!  Plus, Christopher gives us something that is very rare ... a killer who speaks ... and actually has something to say!

Gorehounds are not going to be disappointed.  Great use of a long-handled sledge hammer ... and ... finally, something done with a nail I have always wanted to see in a film.  (Don't think ""Serpent and the Rainbow"" ... much more simple and brutal than that.)  Like the cherry on top of a sundae, the infinitely cool Clint Howard makes a great cameo in this deliciously decadent morsel of slasher cuisine.",1355788800,3,1828,4.749206349206349
5384598,5,B00A6SZRO0,"I saw this movie at the premier last year and I must say until this day I still talk about it.  I have been looking for a scary movie for a long time and this def. did it for me.  I was screaming, covering my eyes and clinging to my sister the whole time.  Can't wait to see it again!",1355702400,3,284,3.7
5384599,4,B00A6SZRO0,caught this movie under a different title when it was at a film festival. Excited to finally own it. reminded me of the older horror movies,1355356800,,139,4.384615384615385
5384600,2,B00A6SZRO0,"If there's one thing I can't stand it's when I watch a movie, hate it, and then view the ""making of"" featurette and gain respect and a different perspective on it. That's how I felt after watching the special features for ""Nobody Gets Out Alive."" Can a bad film be saved by the pure motivations and sincerity of the filmmakers? I say no, but you can definitely feel for them and try to give them credit where credit is due.

It's the same set-up we always get with any of the countless ""Friday the 13th"" or ""Sleepaway Camp"" movies we've all seen over the years. A group of young adults head out into the woods for a weekend of camping, partying, revelry, and debauchery. You know, ""What happens in the woods stays in the woods."" Unfortunately, that's all too true thanks to a killer who takes his tragic loss out on any and everyone who dares enter his territory.

""Nobody Gets Out Alive"" is an hour and seventeen minutes long. That's exactly one hour too long in my opinion. There's absolutely nothing original about this movie. Sure, the killing scenes are a bit more graphic than what we get with the standard ""Scream"" or ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" fare. I'll admit that I did find a couple of them painful to watch. However, it doesn't make up for the tedious retread we suffer through here.

Producer Deven Lobascio and writer / director / producer Jason Christopher set out to make an homage to the movies they grew up watching, and if you look at it strictly from that point of view, they were successful. It mimics everything from those movies. We've got the crazy killer; the sexually promiscuous couple who both die horrific deaths; the handicapped kid who you feel sorry for when he gets axed; and the virgin who survives at the end. The carnage never really ends, does it?

One of the elements about slasher films that I love is the mystery of who the killer is. Movies like ""Scream,"" ""Urban Legend,"" ""Prom Night,"" and even the newer ""Sorority Row"" come to mind. I probably would've given ""Nobody Gets Out Alive"" another star if the filmmakers kept this element a surprise here. Instead, they reveal who the killer is about 30 minutes into the film. To add insult to injury, it's exactly who you would think it is. I would warn this is a spoiler, but it isn't considering how the movie was made.

In the usual fashion of these types of indie horror films, we get a five-minute cameo from a familiar face in the genre. This time we get Clint Howard playing a doctor at the beginning of the movie before disappearing completely.

Special features for the DVD release include audio commentary, a ""Making of"" retrospective, and outtakes. Like I said earlier, the retrospective includes interviews with the filmmakers which show you their sincerity and make you wish the final product was better so you could offer them congratulations.

As it stands, ""Nobody Gets Out Alive"" is an hour and seventeen minutes of your life you'll never get back. You would've been better served re-watching any of the great slashers you were introduced to in your youth. All we get here is a carbon copy of everything done before that will leave you wanting the real deal.",1362700800,3,3168,4.6063829787234045
5384601,3,B00A6SZRO0,"First of all, this movie is not as good as the 5 star reviews are saying. And it's not as bad as the one star reviews either. The theme is a familiar one; a bunch of partygoers venture out into an area of the woods where an unspeakable tragedy occurred years earlier. The man who lost his daughter has gone crazy and kills anyone who enters the woods. So naturally, the young people ignore the warnings and camp there anyway and are picked off one by one. There's a fair amount of gore, the kill scenes aren't bad, and the acting is bad but not terrible. If you're in the mood for this type of film, it serves its purpose. But beyond that, it's an indie slasher flick and nothing more.",1362441600,3,685,4.236641221374046

5384603,1,B00A6SZRO0,"This was hands down the worst movie I have ever seen. Poor acting and a truly lame killer. Amazon is selling this classic for almost $25, please don't waste your money!

5384604,1,B00A6SZRO0,I got fooled by the good reviews on this movie. Trust me this movie is not worth watching. Not worth your time or money.,1362009600,4,120,4.041666666666667
5384605,1,B00A6SZRO0,"I have been debating on keeping this movie.  It seems lately I keep bombing out on bad movies.  This is one I decided not to keep.  I have wasted my money on two films, so far.  This movie is lame and it has no real suspense to keep you interested.  I agree with the other negative reviews.  I think the good ones were put in to fool people.  I hope I won't continue to get fooled by these horrible movies.  I always go by good reviews.  I can't trust them anymore on some of these low-budget horror flicks.",1362009600,2,507,4.091836734693878
5384606,1,B00A6SZRO0,"I'm with the Young and Thebooksbrother. The 5 star reviewers on here sound like they were involved with the movie and are trying to fake their way to success. It's sad and pathetic. DON'T BE FOOLED!

It should be obvious from the synopsis alone, ""A group of partying teenagers out in the woods..."" that this movie is going to suck. And it does. Aside from some ridiculously bloody deaths, there is nothing intriguing about this movie. The acting is horrible. The script is worse. Even the camera angles and the way the movie is put together seem amateurish. This strikes me as something some college students might have made for an end-of-class film school project, but as far as entertainment value... it has none. I've seen more entertaining horror on the sci-fi channel--""Sharktopus"" anyone?",1361836800,15,794,4.925373134328358
5384607,1,B00A6SZRO0,"Odd (and downright sad) that all these amazing 5 star reviews here are done by people who never reviewed anything else ever. Not one thing. Hmm, can you say a desperate attempt by people connected to this turkey of a film to pad their review score and fool people into buying this Z-grade movie? I knew you could! This movie is horrible. Bad acting, bad direction, bad story, characters you could not give a damn about, and a weak and unmemorable villain. Is this the worst movie I've ever seen? No, but it is so bland and insipid that it is a chore to sit through. It might give this one 2 our of 5 stars if I was feeling kind, but here I give it only 1 to help balance out all the obviously planted reviews. Do yourself a favor and pass on this one.",1360454400,15,751,4.1506849315068495
5384608,1,B00A6SZRO0,"All of these highly rated reviews are fake! they're totally made up by the people who probably were in this crappy movie just to make cheap bucks. so sad. low budget, made in some woodland/forest so you know it's going to be budget friendly movie. lol.",1360108800,19,252,4.5
5384609,5,B00A6SZRO0,"Very well written and directed movie.  I am not a big fan of horror films but this movie kept me on the edge of my seat.  Alot of action, surprises and scares!  Will definitely add this to my movie collection.",1358726400,2,209,4.175
8547089,1,B00A6SZRO0,Wow...This Movie is Really bad.......The first indication this movie would SUX..would be that this movie was only an hour and seventeen minutes and believe me in this case that was way 2 long. Not sure is the characters in this movie were meant to portray college kid or what...but way 2 old looking anyway...I am mad at myself for watching this turkey in it's entirety,1409011200,,369,4.6923076923076925
8547090,1,B00A6SZRO0,"This movie hinges on its villian avenging the death of his young daughter after being struck by a car full of happy go lucky teens.. Ok, so far so good. However, at the owning when we see doomed daughter playing hopscotch IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HIGHWAY with her dad watching and smiling, immediately I am amazed that this isn't s comedy. Because that... was moronic.

Things don't get better. Obnoxious, poorly acted teens meet poorly executed demises in the woods. The only people that seem to care less about that fact than me were the other characters. Dead friends seem more an inconvenience.

I was at the premiere of this movie at Horrorhound Weekend,  and the filmmakers' drunken behavior both before and during the screening was an embarrassment, ruining the experience for those of us trying to give this movie a chance.  If they had so little respect for their own work as well as the audience,  then I highly advise that you respect yourself by not watching this piece of garbage.",1391731200,,989,4.69364161849711
8547091,1,B00A6SZRO0,"No, no, no, just don't do it to yourself or anyone you might care for. However if you do have a few unpleasant acquaintances, might I suggest you recommend this ""thing"" to them for their viewing pleasure. ;-)",1367884800,,208,4.5
8547092,3,B00A6SZRO0,"Not the worst slasher ever. But definitely cliche, unscary and too long. I actually loved the performance of the killer and how realistic the cast was. Just wish it had some scares, some better kills, some new twist or something. But a decent way to waste time and see annoying characters die.",1364515200,,293,4.653846153846154
8547093,1,B00A6SZRO0,"I had high hopes for this movie when I purchased it at Walmart because the blurb sounded good. It sounded like I was going to have some B-movieish, shoestring budget fun (I'm . . . really not that difficult to please when it comes to horror movies.)

Jeez, such potential wasted on an idiot plot.

Possible SPOILERS ahead!

The story opens up with a man's daughter being killed by a drunk driver. Later, we learn that the father went ""crazy"" after she was killed and reportedly spends his days in the woods now. Those who go into the woods don't make it out.

Cut to a group of friends going out for a party in the woods. The woods the psycho lives in. Yeah, that one.

From there, the plot devolves into an idiot plot. These characters had multiple chances to get the heck out of the woods to go get help. Instead, they stagger around until it's too late. At one point, most of them are together in their vehicle when the psycho-murderer-slasher dude throws a corpse on the hood of the vehicle. Now, if you were the driver in this movie, would you

A. hit the gas and get the heck out of there?

or

B. exit the car with everybody else?

If you answered B, then you probably got killed by the psycho-murderer-slasher dude.

Okay, so maybe they panicked. But at one point, one of the girls hitches a ride with a guy. The psycho dude steps out of the woods and the driver stops until the psycho bashes in the window and murders him. I laughed out loud at this point. Who's going to sit there in a working vehicle while someone bashes their window in? Not me. Maybe I have a better sense of self-preservation?

At the end (MAJOR SPOILER ALERT), the last of the girls hitches a ride with a kindly-looking dude who has the same weapons in the back of his car as the psycho owned. As in, he was apparently in on it. Or something? There was no foreshadowing of this that I could see, so the ending fell flat. Way flat.

Nobody Gets Out Alive could have been a decent movie. The premise wasn't that bad, and all the elements of a good slasher were there. But when the characters have to act like idiots to keep the plot going, then it's not fun to watch anymore. (They could have at least been more convincing idiots!) The disappointing ending was just another jab in the ribs.",1364083200,4,2270,4.315294117647059
8547094,2,B00A6SZRO0,"Flat out - this movie sucks.

Absolutely terrible acting and an absurd story.  The psycho killer sucks - he isn't scary whatsoever.  He has no method behind his madness.  Just stupid and deranged.  The lighting is the only redeeming quality of this ludicrous movie.  If this is a college film project (which is what it looks like) - I'd give it a D.

Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time with this flick.",1363564800,2,413,4.426666666666667
8547095,1,B00A6SZRO0,"I believe that Jason Christopher picked the perfect title for his ""flick;"" nobody that watches this piece of garbage gets out alive.

In a genre where bad movies are more common than not, Christopher's flick is up there with some of the worst. There is no story whatsoever, poor camera work, poor lighting, and abysmal acting. It's rare that I watch a bad horror movie and don't enjoy it for the laughs, but Christopher's film managed to both bore and offend me. Not offend me because something even remotely offensive happens in the film, but offended because it was allowed to be released to the public. Not only were there zero scares, but the killer may have been the least intimidating murderer to ever exist. Do yourself a favor and skip this one; there isn't a single redeeming quality to be found.",1363478400,,805,4.669014084507042
8547096,1,B00A6SZRO0,"As I was sitting through this ""flick"", as Jason Christopher likes to call it, I couldn't help but notice something: this movie is bad.  I have seen my fair share of bad horror movies, and this is right up there with the worst of them.

In the horror genre, there is a line that a movie can cross over where bad becomes funny, and when this happens the movie becomes somewhat enjoyable.  Unfortunately for Jason Christopher, his flick sits just behind this line, causing it to be completely unwatchable.  Everything from acting to camera work to lighting was terrible.  Multiple shots, excuse me, most shots, in this movie were either under or over exposed, making it hard to see what was going on.  The score was almost non-existent, but when it was, it hardly fit the mood of the scene.  It seems that Mr. Christopher spent the majority of the budget on Clint Howard's paycheck, which was a complete waste of a role.  The screenplay itself was horrible, so I can't blame Jason Christopher for making a bad flick.  But actually, he is to blame because he wrote it.  With characters that are completely generic, a killer that wears size 7 boots (very intimidating), and dialogue that doesn't make any sense, do yourself a favor and spend your night looking at a wall, it will be more enjoyable.",1363478400,,1293,4.631578947368421
8547097,3,B00A6SZRO0,"I hear tell about this movie being made for around $36,000.00 and all these foolish critics are treating it as if it had a big budget. Now believe me, I personally don't put out money for old school slasher films, but when I heard the young filmmakers sold this product to companies like Image Entertainment (United States) and Entertainment One (Canada)...I had to check it out. I'll be the first one to tell you that the acting wasn't very good, there was absolutely no experience when it came to location scouting and more than half of the shots were lousy due to inexperienced directing...but in order to get all of those things utterly correct you need way more than just $36,000.00. I give this film credit simply because of where it has been able to go for how little it cost. And if you're mad about spending $25.00 on Amazon, then maybe you should just go to your local Wal-Mart and buy it for $10.00 like I did.",1363392000,5,921,4.488095238095238

That's because NOBODY GETS OUT ALIVE uses every tired clich on film and brings absolutely nothing new to the table.  Writer/director Jason Christopher credits vintage 80s slasher films as his inspiration----problem is this film fails to generate any of those films' effectiveness.  Fans of slasher films can do much better.",1363219200,2,629,5.292929292929293
