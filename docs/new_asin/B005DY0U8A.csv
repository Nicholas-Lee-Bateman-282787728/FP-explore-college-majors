8467745,3,B005DY0U8A,"Amazing band but this is a DVD-R. Not too happy about that. Its all professionally made but still, its a DVD-R. Should be mentioned in the listing that its not a silver bottom REAL dvd. This is throw away media and has a much shorter shelf life than standard silver bottom DVD-Rs. But the band is incredible, everything they do is incredible and this performance is definitely worth the money. The media its printed on however, isn't. I felt a little cheated. If it was based on the band and content alone, then 5 stars all the way. 3 stars though because I'm rating a product, and the product here is a DVD-R. That part is weak.",1431648000,,629,4.384615384615385
8467746,5,B005DY0U8A,"incredible performance captured here, quality of video was excellent.  Sweet drum cam, everyone was spotlighted well throughout the concert.  The disc was burned onto a dvd-r disc which is a bit of a bug-a-boo of mine, paying full price on ""possibly"" pirated material.",1385424000,,268,5.209302325581396
