8066397,5,B0009SXC6M,I've had this tape since the early 1990's. Sadly I haven't seen it in years since we switched to dvd's- but if you want to paint using Bob Ross's methods- and still have a VHS player- this is for you. This is the single best item in the Bob Ross teaching arsenal. If you learn best by seeing then skip the books entirely. Wonderful up-close demo's for all his techniques. Have fun and don't forget to beat the devil out of that brush Ha.,1299283200,2,437,4.214285714285714
8066398,2,B0009SXC6M,"This review is not about the subject of the tape.  It is about the quality of the tape.  I purchased a used tape that was listed as ""near new""  The video is bad and the audio is worse.  I have several tapes purchased from the Bob Ross website that are professional grade.  I cannot tell if this tape has been played too many times or if it is a duplicate made on a poor quality machine.  I reccomend buying a new tape or CD.  The savings of buying a used one does not compensate for the disappointment.",1294704000,,502,4.11340206185567
8066399,5,B0009SXC6M,"I have been working hard to learn this style of painting. He goes over stuff that he can't get in on the series but also a lot of stuff you may already know. By far the best part of this video is the last segment it's about fixing mistakes. He paints a painting and fixes mistakes made and it's absolutely wonderful. I duplicated it and produced my first decent painting. I actually put it on facebook and 2 of my friends (I only have 50 on there and I'm not sure how many people saw it) offered to buy it within 2 hours. So yeah I quadrupled my money back with this DVD, Thanks Bob. But I didn't have the heart to sell my first decent painting. Hope this helps",1265673600,5,661,4.092307692307692
