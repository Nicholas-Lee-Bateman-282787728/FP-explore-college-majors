8210610,1,B000TSIZYG,"I had high hopes for this one.  But, it just did not deliver, in my opinion.  The story is a familiar one for the horror genre, but the sub-par script and storyline really killed it (pun intended).  I must say, the torture scenes were rather unique and the gore factor seemed on par with other similar movies...that's really the only plus.  Since I purchased it, I may give it another watch before trading/selling it.  If you're considering seeing this, rent it first.",1207008000,,468,4.658536585365853
8210611,4,B000TSIZYG,"This is a good (and hopefully) one of a kind Texas style barbeque!  It's a thrill ride with some good realistic gory effects and convincing acting.  No, it's not stereotyped by being loaded with toothless rednecks.  I gave it four stars because ""jane"" got on my nerves with her reaction several times, and I must say, when you are away from home and discover you are hungry, go to a legit restaurant, hellOooo.
Overall though I really liked this movie.",1204675200,,452,4.625

8210613,3,B000TSIZYG,"And that may steer more than a few viewers directly to the eject button.  Within moments of the opening scene it's glaringly obvious that the budget for See Jane Run may be less than what any of us make in a week of work (the first really weak CGI death scene will completely confirm it!)but the film does have enough going for it to warrant a watch IF you can forgive the monetary constraints.  The story is far from original (although it does feature some semi-new twists to keep the movie from being completely stale)and starts with four teens on a roadtrip (stop me if you've heard this one before...)who pick up a hitchhiker (gotta up that victim count somehow right?)and then make the mistake of stopping at the wrong town for a bite of the ""self-proclaimed finest BBQ in Texas!""  Fellow horror fans can probably put together the rest of the proceedings, but like I said before, there are a few moments of well done madness and grue that should make you sit up and take notice (for instance a nicely macabre scene featuring an unconscious victim waking up tied to a chair with a clothes iron strapped to his face... then having it plugged in and slowing heating up to it's flesh sizzling max, and then unplugged only to be plugged back in against the pleading wishes of the poor shlub!).  Add in some good (to nearly inspired)performances from the solid cast, more than adept camera work (this guy went on to work on HBO's The Wire), and some nice moody music (fairly stock quality but still fitting), and you end up with a nice little (clocks in at 86 minutes)independent film that's well above most of the other ultra-low budget direct-to-DVD trash littering most rental store shelfs.  Fans of other recent and well done low budget horror like The Roost, (Fangoria presents)Joshua, and The Convent should be entertained, while newer fright fans (unfamiliar to many of the cliches and less jaded... man I miss those days LOL!)should find something to like here too.  Anyone on the hunt for a polished and original hidden gem of horror to add to the collection should drop me a positive vote and look elsewhere.",1198627200,9,2117,4.662198391420912
8210614,5,B000TSIZYG,"A new horror movie that manages to be both traditional and innovative. I found the build up to be the best part, with an interesting depiction of South Texas roads and towns and a disturbed, unbalanced feeling among the main characters that kept you on edge as you moved towards the mayhem you knew was coming. The gore comes at last, but in unusual ways that are unique enough to be quite memorable. The ending both satisfies and yet leaves enough loose ends for further contemplation, with a haunting visual. I look forward to the maker's next effort.",1196035200,,553,4.653061224489796

8210616,5,B000TSIZYG,"I got to see this movie at the Sacramento International Film and Music Festival last month and I thought it was great. From the opening scene with Joe Estevez to the extensive torture sequences towards the end of the movie I was on the edge of my seat. It seems like this movie borrowed a lot of age old devices from classic horror films and pays tribute to its predecessors. The story revolves around a group of kids traveling through Texas to get to Brownsville for a ""romantic weekend getaway"". This is a joke in itself if you have ever been to Brownsville. They do all of the things that kids should do in a horror movie: pick up a hitchhiker, trust a scary auto mechanic, and decide to stay the night at a stranger's house who seems to be straight out of a Norman Rockwell painting. While I won't ruin any surprises by saying who lives or dies, I will say that when someone does get tortured and die it is in a unique and gruesome way every time. From darts to an iron on the face this is a great horror flick that fits well into the torture sub-genre with movies like Hostel and Saw.",1190505600,11,1089,4.265700483091788
