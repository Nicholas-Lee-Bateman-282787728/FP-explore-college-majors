8518002,5,B007IV19S6,"Having visited the Normandy beaches and (lived in Germany from 1941-1950) I enjoyed Megans' pictorial of the action areas going on during the war. Reading accounts by Eisenhower,Patton and Bradley this documentary  plays out the various battle scenes. However GT can never show the carnage that occurred at each battle site. Good job done by GT. Love Megan and all her exploits.",1449100800,,378,5.096774193548387
8518003,4,B007IV19S6,"Nice product but too ambitious for one CD especially the European tour could be subdivided into England, Italy and France in part 1, Belgium, Luxembourg, Holland, and Germany in part two. I would include the following sites as must sees: The D-Day Museum and Overlord Embroidery in Portsmouth England, Churchill's War Room and HMS Belfast in London, RAF Hendon Museum Battle of Britain Hall (near London); Pointe Du Hoc and Normandy American Cemetery France, D-Day Museum Arromanches France; Fortress Schoenenbourg (Maginot Line) France; Bastogne War Museum Belgium; Luxembourg American Cemetery, National Museum of Military History in Diekirch Luxembourg; Airborne Museum Hartenstein Hotel (near Arnhem) Holland; Polish War Cemetery Monte Cassino Italy; Laboe Naval Memorial U-995 Kiel Germany, and Kehlsteinhaus the Eagles Nest Berchtesgarten Germany. The Pacific tour is better though War in the Pacific National Park on Guam should be included; Although Iwo Jima is closed to tourist it still should be in the video especially since the most memorable photograph of World War Two was taken there.",1436572800,,1100,5.553571428571429
