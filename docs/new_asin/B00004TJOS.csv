7922809,1,B00004TJOS,"I purchased this DVD because my favorite star, Loretta Devine, was in the cast.  It was a poor production with great stars but a horrible storyline.  Don't waste your money.",1383609600,,173,4.733333333333333
7922810,4,B00004TJOS,"The name doesn't really describe it.  It's a dark comedy from Mario Van Peebles.  Kind of unexpected - part farce, and irreverent.",1356048000,,130,4.863636363636363
7922811,3,B00004TJOS,"I enjoyed this film because of the interesting cast of characters, and constant plot twists. If you have ever played the game ""Clue"" and enjoy ""who done it"" mysteries, then you will enjoy this film. However, often times the attempts at crude humor can be a turn off. I still would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good movie.",986083200,9,337,4.540983606557377
