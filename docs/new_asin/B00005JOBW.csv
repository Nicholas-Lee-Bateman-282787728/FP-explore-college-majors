1564908,1,B00005JOBW,"It wasn't the worst show ever on television, but that's about the nicest thing I can say about AfterMASH.  As a M*A*S*H afficionado, I was curious about this show, so I googled it and actually found it on youtube.  If you're interested, then check it out over there.  I doubt you'll be able to get past the first episode.  There's a reason they cancelled it in season 2. It reminds me of Joey, the not-quite-awful, but not-quite-good spin-off of Friends.  It's not terrible, but it leaves you wondering why they bothered.  You'll wonder why you bothered if you actually buy this show--that is if it ever comes out on DVD.",1233360000,2,621,4.6
1564909,5,B00005JOBW,"Here's another vote for bringing After MASH to DVD.  I just finished all 11 seasons and I want more.  Someone mentioned W*A*L*T*E*R that was about Radar, did not know they made on of him as well.  Maybe bring both out together.  That would be awesome.",1226966400,4,251,4.511111111111111
1564910,4,B00005JOBW,"I would love to see a dvd be produced for this show.  With all the junk that is floating around out there; it would be refreshing to revisit this spinoff of the greatest TV show ever produced.  I only remember a couple of episodes.  I was 18 yrs old at the time, and just started college so I had a lot going on.  Sure, this show was never going to match up to its ""parent"", but I am sure there are plenty of fans out there that would make a production of this dvd well worth while.  If the ""all knowing"" network heads hadn't moved this show up against ""A Team"" on Tuesday nights at a different time, the show might have stood a chance to develop.",1204416000,7,647,4.062992125984252
1564911,5,B00005JOBW,"I watched ""AfterMASH"" for the short time it was on, and I enjoyed just as much as I did ""M*A*S*H"". I was also lucky enough to have recorded all the episodes. It took ""M*A*S*H"" quite a while to find a core audience, but it eventually did. Unfortunately, CBS never gave ""AfterM*A*S*H"" the same chance, even though it was consistently in the top 30.

It might have aired for a only a season and a 1/2, but it deserves to be released on DVD.",1167782400,42,437,4.265060240963855
1564912,4,B00005JOBW,"I hope aftermash will be released on dvd to complete the mash story . Is aftermash as good as mash ? No but its still entertaining to see some of the mash characters back home after the war . We now have all the mash episodes on dvd , please release all the aftermash episodes and complete the mash story.",1164240000,16,305,4.1
1564913,5,B00005JOBW,"Like it or hate it, this is a MUST for us M*A*S*H Completists.  As far as I know, this series hasn't been seen since the Mid-80s when it originally aired.  I personally have nothing but fond memories of it.  (Although I hated it when they switched actresses playing Mildred Potter and made the character an idiot.)

There is a whole generation of M*A*S*H fans who have NEVER seen the show & would probably LOVE to judge for themselves.  NOTHING could ever follow-up the greatest TV series ever.....  But ....I found this show a nice attempt.

PLEASE FOX,  FOLLOW UP THE FINAL M*A*S*H DVD RELEASE WITH THIS SINGLE ""COMPLETE SERIES"" BOX SET !!!!!!!!!

And don't forget to include the RARELY seen RADAR TV pilot.... W*A*L*T*E*R !!!!!!!",1160006400,60,732,4.792
1564914,1,B00005JOBW,"Man, this show was bad. While it was nice to see Harry Morgan, William Christopher, and Jamie Farr continue on in their roles, (e.g. how do they all adapt to civilian life, Mulcahy's deafness, Klinger and his Korean War bride Soon-Lee, Colonel Potter and his wife Mildred reconnecting after his retirement, etc., etc.)  the potential to explore the lives of these characters was absolutely ignored in favor of too much emphasis on the supporting characters, (a butinsky hospital administrator and a female character who were always sort of conniving to thwart various efforts.) These were obviously intended as the ""substitutes"" for Margaret Houlihan and Frank Burns/C.E. Winchester, but they were so badly written and poorly performed that they just wound up being extremly annoying and very unwelcome additions to the story.

It also turned out to be a very painful show to watch because it was so poorly written and the stories were pointless. All the character conflict (both external and internal) that could have been continued was very quickly abandoned. (Mulcahy's deafness was quickly dismissed in a breakthrough medical procedure, Soon-Lee became an ordinary 1950's housewife, and so on.)

Another problem was the genesis of the show itself. In the last season of MASH, a vote was taken by the cast on whether to continue or ""go out with a bang."" The only cast members to vote to continue were Morgan, Farr, and Christopher. MASH had been a huge success for CBS and so they developed AfterMASH around these three actors as sort of a consolation prize. What could have been an interesting ""dramedy"" concept quickly became a sub-standard and, in fact, greatly inferior TV sitcom.

One of the best parts of the show however, was the theme music and that wonderful trombone solo by Bill Watrous. That was worth tuning into for the first 5 minutes or so.",1156291200,6,1859,4.987096774193549
1564915,5,B00005JOBW,"I think it is interesting to see a Prime Time Spin-Off of the popular TV Series M*A*S*H come out on DVD. AfterMASH was number 15 out of the 30 best TV Shows and getting 20.1% of viewers, according to the Nielsen rating (The Nielsen Rating is the percent of all TV-equipped homes tuned to the program on an average night, as measured by Nielsen Media Research).

AfterMASH first telecasted on September 26th, 1983 until December 18th, 1984. Some of the original cast were on the show such as Harry Morgan (as Dr. Sherman Potter), Jamie Farr (as Max Klinger) & William Christopher (as Father Francis Mulcahy). It is just fun to see those actors return to civilian life.

The show lasted for 2 Seasons (First season 21 episodes and the Second season 9 episodes for a total of 30 episodes) or a season and a half to be precise.

I Also would like to see another Spin-Off of M*A*S*H on DVD which is the ""Trapper John, M.D."" , first telecasted on September 23rd, 1979 until September 4th, 1986 for a total of Seven seasons and a total of 151 episodes.

Thank you for reading my review :)",1144800000,61,2300,4.5011990407673865
1564916,3,B00005JOBW,"This was a series that aired one year after M*A*S*H ended.  At the start of the last season of M*A*S*H, Harry Morgan (who played Col. Potter), Jamie Farr (who played Klinger), and William Christopher (who played the priest) voted for another season to happen.  So, a spin-off was made.

This show takes place in Potter's hometown.  He works at a hospital with Klinger and the priest, Father Mulchay.

The show lasted for one, one and a half seasons.  It featured two guest appearances by Gary Burghoff (who played Radar).",1122768000,39,521,4.797752808988764

7941704,4,B00005JOBW,"I was pleasantly surprised to discover that this program is much better than I had been told. It was described as being one of the worst things ever put on television but that was unfair, even by the standards of the time (today, when every other show seems to be a reality show, After Mash is positively marvelous by comparison). Of course, it can't compare to the original MASH but it doesn't try to. Much.

Colonel Potter, Klinger and Father Mulcahy all pick up where they left off after the Armistice at General Pershing General Hospital in Missouri, a VA facility where veterans are taken care off after the war. Dealing with the bureaucracy and the human drama of our veterans makes for good television in its own right. Unfortunately by the 2nd Season the program puts Kilinger back in a dress, provides two episodes with Radar and even brings back Colonel Flagg, who thinks Klinger is a red. Too much of an ongoing soap opera for my tastes at one point. Still, a good show.",1435536000,6,981,4.573863636363637
7941705,4,B00005JOBW,"Why is After MASH not available?  It is a part of my history... I grew up on M*A*S*H*, and this was the followup.  Please release it on DVD!",1369612800,8,140,3.9642857142857144
7941706,3,B00005JOBW,"If Paramount owns it, everyone should stop panting... yes, I would be interested too... witness my appearance searching this site... but look what stingy creeps they are about controlling Star Trek for maximum $, refusing to allow fans to make respectful non-monetary tributes... and changing their own version till it is hardly recognizable.  As noted by one reviewer, that's what they did to season 2 of AfterMASH... Yes, how would it hurt them to release it... but will they?",1323475200,,478,5.050632911392405
7941707,5,B00005JOBW,"I was skeptical about this, thinking it was another poorly made sequal or spinoff like so many (See Three's A Crowd, the spinoff of Three's Company).  I watched the pilot episode on Youtube in 5 ten minute intervals.  I liked the characters of COL Potter and Klinger.  This is not M*A*S*H, but I do like the perspective of the VA Hospital.  There is the unnecessay conflict of the lady that has to approve the paperwork for Klinger, but it also shows how some veterans survive war and cannot leave the war after returning home.  It is also hard to find shows with that early and mid 80's feeling.  I greatly enjoyed this show and it is nice to see the familiar characters again.

  The characters from the original show do not include anyone, but it seems fitting to only have COL Potter, Klinger and Father Mulcahy.  Hawkeye does not belong in this show as he was so politically antiwar that he would probably spend many years in a VA Hospital after returning for PTSD.  Klinger would obviously have problems since he tried so hard to be evicted from the Army, then conformed and when he had finally had acheived his goal of being able to leave Korea, he chose to stay and brought his wife to Toledo.  Not gaining any desirable job skills, he chose to earn a living illegally.  A sympathetic judge allows him to start a new life with his old Commander.  COL Potter, realizes his war years left him enjoying leadership and responsibility and he finds retirement boring so he chooses to help veterans as a doctor and take care of his old clerk, Klinger.  Father Francis Mulcahy returns from war and turns to alcohol when his hadicap won't allow him to hear confessions.  A new surgery returns much of his hearing and he chooses to be the spiritual guide for the veterans in the VA Hospital.

  I greatly enjoyed the pilot episode and will order the whole series.  It may be cheesy, but that is how mid 80's shows should be.  The familiar characters are a nice welcome and the perspective of a VA Hospital after a war is new and interesting.  It may not be great, but it is better than a lot of shows on today.",1322611200,7,2108,4.463350785340314
7941708,3,B00005JOBW,"As a longtime MASH fan I hope to see After MASH on DVD soon!  It wasn't MASH, but it was entertaining and got better as it went on.  I know the premise is a stretch, getting three of the old cast-mates together in the same hospital, but there were actually quite a few good episodes.

I think as a Bonus they should include the Pilot for another spin off that aired around the same time, called W*A*L*T*E*R starring Gary Burghoff. Suicide may be painless, but W*A*L*T*E*R is not!!!  It was pretty bad. Radar becomes a small town police officer?! His partner was Ray Buktenica of TV's House calls.  The only interesting thing was Clete Roberts was on the TV set they were watching in a diner and he was talking about his weekly interviews he was doing as follow ups on the MASH 4077th team now that they are home..I believe he said something at the start like ... ""Last week I interviewed Dr. Hawkeye Pierce..."" So, if you're a true fan you'll want to see it. It only aired one-time,I know I'd like to see it once more.

Paramount please release AFTERMASH!!  (And include the pilot for W*A*L*T*E*R, even though it is as Col. Potter would say ""Horse Hockey"")!!

THANK YOU!",1316476800,6,1170,4.485849056603773
7941709,2,B00005JOBW,"Some people weren't ready to say goodbye when MASH finally took itself off the air after eleven years.  Thus the reason for Aftermash which gives diehard fans another year and a half with the remaining supporting characters working in a stateside hospital.  The idea might have worked, but something just did not connect with me.  I didn't really like the deaf Father Mulcahy subplot or the fact that I could now see Mrs. Potter. Also, I felt the interaction between the characters was different since they were no longer confined to a MASH unit far away from home.  I liked MASH, and I liked these characters but overall this show was a disappointment to me.",1290729600,,659,4.7043478260869565
7941710,5,B00005JOBW,"Once again, I find myself giving a good review to a product that is often given a bad one. I think people had too high of expectations for this show or the problem is they haven't seen it in a long time. I just watched most of the series for the second time in my life. The previous time I watched it was in the 80s, on CBS. It's a great show especially if you enjoy the more serious tone of the last seasons of M*A*S*H. The comedy / drama does show Potter, Klinger and Mulcahy dealing with even more government stupidity than they had in Korea. That issue, along with their interactions with their families and their patients are the basic plotline for the show. Plenty of funny moments as well and the secondary actors are quite good and recognizable. I even enjoy the theme song better than the original M*A*S*H theme. All this was true until the second season. Then they tried hard to change everything. Time slot, cast members, theme song. It crashed and burned in the middle of Season 2 trying to go against the A-Team. Overall, a main reason to write this review is to ask for the complete series to be released on DVD, ASAP! I know I am not the only fan out there and many people who liked the earlier series may check it out. Probably a four disc set and don't forget to include the pilot for W*A*L*T*E*R! The fact that TV Guide called it the worst spinoff ever is ridiculous, but could serve as a selling point to people would have never seen it.",1273449600,13,1456,4.317518248175182
7941711,4,B00005JOBW,"One small correction. ""Trapper John M.D. was not a sequel to the show-It was a sequel to the Robert Altman movie. MASH the t.v show was an acquired taste, though it was a dark comedy people remember the comical moments. AfterMash was kind of dark, it took place in a depressing place(A VA hospital) and the Hawkeye type doctor with the prosthetic leg was a little hard to get used too. I rememeber that there were problems with the timeslot , but had it been given enough time it would have worked itself out. They were well written characters they just needed more time to develop outside of Korea.",1236729600,2,599,4.504587155963303
