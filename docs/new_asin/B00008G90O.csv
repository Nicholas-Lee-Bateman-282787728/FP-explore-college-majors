1845232,4,B00008G90O,"This DVD is great for learning funk/slap base. I just plug some headphones into my amp, put the DVD in my computer, and I can practice all the base lines without disturbing my roommates. Ed Friedland is a very well spoken and patient teacher. In the excercises he first plays them and then plays them again at half or quarter-speed so you can catch on. I'm having a blast learning some of these techniques. The DVD is very easy to navigate. My only gripe would be that he only plays grooves that are kind of old-sounding funk lines, which is fine, but it would be nice if he strayed a little from the formulaic stuff. It's realy not much of a gripe though. Love the DVD.",1231632000,2,670,4.325396825396825
1845233,5,B00008G90O,"If all instruction material was as solid as this, I would have 50-100 books/DVDs in all (for bass, guitar, mandolin), not a 1000 or more.

There is enough easily usable information here to build your technique from scratch to as serviceable as any normal contemporary bass player's slap technique needs to be in typical playing situations. Only if you play in a solo or a bass-dominant musical context, would you need anything more.

Of course, once you fall in love with the possibilities of playing slap & pop (and tap etc.), you WILL need more. At that point you should get Stuart Clayton's ULTIMATE SLAP BASS, which actually is as complete a guide on any style on any instrument ever written (I otter know, coz I've invested more money in instruction material than any other human). Still, Clayton's book might be overwhelming because of its thoroughness; Ed's DVD has the essentials and intermediate stuff, but there's a load of them in here and the booklet is generous by DVD standards.

The only 3rd slap instruction you will perhaps need is the Hal Leonard book FUNK BASS by Chris Kringel as that gives you some real famous songs to learn. Of course, you can later progress to Victor Wooten's and Primus's transcriptions. In any case, for less than 20 buckaroos, this DVD provides the maximum wham for the whampum!

Not considered: Double thumbing, chord playing, and strumming. Of course, no tapping either; although in performance at a high level, tapping is often interspersed into slap technique.",1216771200,21,1508,4.901960784313726
1845234,4,B00008G90O,"If you wan't to quickly improve your slap technique, this is for you!

This DVD will help you master basic techniques like slapping and popping as well as more advanced techniques like left hand slap and other cool funk techniques.

The DVD is well done, easy of use, you can jump from exercise to exercise quickly and follow the ''teacher'' with your booklet.

This is truly a great buy for anyone who wants to improve his slap bass techniques.",1169942400,2,445,4.6075949367088604
1845235,4,B00008G90O,"This DVD cleared up alot of problems I was having trying to learn this style.  After viewing this DVD many times, I feel I have a solid foundation in which to build on.  I am by no means a super slap funk player, but I do have mucho more confidence going into grooves that require this style as a result of studying this DVD.  I highly recommend it.",1156982400,11,349,4.102941176470588
1845236,4,B00008G90O,"It is useful for beginners. It is not intended for experienced players, but I think it describes the basic techniques for beginers very well. Do not expect it will rocet your slap playing, but if you are just starting, it will give you very solid basic knowledge.",1125532800,7,263,4.617021276595745
1845237,5,B00008G90O,"This is a solid well rounded guide to slap bass. It helped me in more than a few places that I was bogging down on. If you want to be a poser then concern yourself with looks. Take it at face value: study some examples, learn some technique, get some insight, and then move on from there.",1113264000,2,288,4.0701754385964914
1845238,5,B00008G90O,"Ed Friedlin is a monthly writer for bass player magazine.  He covers in an excellent way how to slap, pop, mute, develop a groove, how to play with drum machines, ghost notes, and does some licks in larry graham, louis johnson, and marcus miller style and it is laid out in a very good manner.  very good instructional video.",1091059200,13,325,4.491525423728813

DVD for your money. I wish there was a VOL II",1396656000,,163,3.6857142857142855
1845261,5,B00008G90O,"Ed Friedlands' DVD and booklet are an excellent guide to learning slap bass!  He not only covers the basics in a way that is easy to understand, but then gives simple, practical, and most importantly, musical exercises to help you master the lesson.  As he progressively teaches the contents, he prepares you to develop your own lines in a musical way.
Of the six or eight books/DVDs I have on slap bass, which are all good in their own way,  if I had to choose only one, it would definitely be Mr. Friedlands.",1391644800,,510,4.462365591397849
1845262,5,B00008G90O,For years I have been trying to find  a course as good as this one to  solve some technical problems I have been having when I slap.  great course,1390780800,,146,3.9655172413793105
1845263,5,B00008G90O,Ed Friedland has many books out that I have studied. This is the first DVD I bought of his and it is great. Good for the beginner to the advanced. Great camera shots of technique and style.,1355270400,,189,4.135135135135135

1845265,4,B00008G90O,I found this video to be very helpful. I wish it had gone further but it takes the slap beginer through the steps to get started.,1326585600,,129,4.0
1845266,5,B00008G90O,"Ed Friedland is one of those rare musicians who can both play and teach. Of my collection of instructional videos for bass and other instruments, this is among my top picks (I also own Ed's excellent DVD for jazz upright bass). The content is logically organized and progresses to more complex riffs. Each technique is demonstrated and then the movement is slowed down and analyzed so the viewer can duplicate the line.

Before buying a teaching video, I first check out a sample clip on youtube.com if it's available. In this case, I found the content most appropriate for intermediate musicians. The presentation moves at a lively pace and Ed offers solid information and many valuable tips gained from his years of experience as a performer and recording artist.

After a few hours of practice, I became quite comfortable with many of the slap and pop techniques presented in this video. Some of the more complex moves will take additional time to master. This is the kind of ""stretch"" I hope for in a teaching video... but rarely get. If you're serious about learning slap bass technique, this DVD is highly recommended.",1324512000,3,1124,4.848958333333333
1845267,5,B00008G90O,"Ed Friedland provides easy steps to follow for the beginner to slap. He gives you guidance on the best finger positions for slap and pop, and provides some good exercises. If you are looking for a relatively short period in which to master slapping, this dvd with some dedication will surely help you get there quick.",1287964800,,317,4.678571428571429
1845268,5,B00008G90O,"I am a good bass player.  Primarily rock, but play a little bit of other styles.  I bought this just as a tune up, mostly because I had a coupon and couldn't find another use for it.

This DVD is excellent.  It starts out VERY simple.  It may be boring for many at first, it was for me at first, but it gets better quickly.  Ed Freidland gives excellent, easily understood instructions.  I enjoy his style of instruction.

If you start in the beginning, actually do the drills & only move on after you 'master' the section, you will truely gain a lot from this DVD.  Even an experienced bass player, like me, enjoyed it.  Sure, the early parts were easy & relatively boring, but I breezed through them quickly.  You will see that some of these skills & drills are much harder than you think if you force yourself to master them before moving on.

Overall, it took me about 3 weeks to work through this DVD this way.  Most of which was the last few sections, they are much harder than they seem.  I knew how to  play ""slap bass"" prior to this DVD, but using this DVD properly truely made an improvement on my skill.

This is 1 item I can truely recomend to anyone who plays bass.  I enjoyed it.",1248134400,7,1193,4.254464285714286

7983357,1,B00008G90O,"Extremely rudimentary, with boringly obvious exercises and no in-depth technique advice or rhythmic analysis. Beginner and early intermediate bass players would be far better served by free online options. My personal online favorite is TalkingBass.net. Alternatively, Scott's Bass Lessons also has some good slap bass lessons, although it aggressively pursues a paid membership - which may be well worth it for some players.

A DVD on slap bass that I did find very useful was The Slap Bass Program by Alexis Sklarevski.",1474761600,3,521,5.353658536585366
