8061884,5,B0009J6JNO,This Columbia House tape of A Fury Slinging Flame is the only complete version of this episode available.  The DVDs from Shout Factory and Infinity use an edited version which has 5 minutes cut out of it.,1370822400,,204,4.513513513513513
8061885,2,B0009J6JNO,"I bought this, despite the VHS format, simply because I'd always seen stills from this episode featuring Karloff, Lorre and Chaney, and I was intrigued to see what it was all about. Karloff, Lorre and Chaney are delightful. The rest of the show sucks. I'd never seen an episode of ROUTE 66 (though I do like the song of that title by Nat ""King"" Cole). And if the rest of my life holds up, I will never see another episode.",1281744000,,422,4.2875
8061886,5,B0009J6JNO,"Two kinds of beginnings here. This 2 episode set features what I believe is the very first episode of the series entitled Black November. It sets the tone for some of the ""deep"" episodes that Route 66 would feature. The second episode on this tape features a young Robert Redford early in his career, another kind of beginning. What was also appealing was the banter back and forth between Tod and Buz, the two main characters, as they drove in their car, a Corvette, the only other continuing  ""character"" in the series. The premisee for Route 66 is among the best of any television series. It was also extremely well made with top talent in writing, directing, and acting, plus the theme song by Nelson Riddle that captured the very essence of the appeal of the road. Get some Route 66 tapes, if not this one then one of the others. You will experience one of the best television series ever done.",1153872000,8,899,4.549382716049383
