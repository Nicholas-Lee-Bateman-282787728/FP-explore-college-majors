8660413,5,B002DNDMQG,"As an Englishman abroad I waited patiently for this second series. The resulting DVD did not disappoint.  Incredibly well drawn characters, a plausible plot and the original Jack Sugden as played by Andrew Burt. With all due respect to Clive Hornby, Burt is in a different class with this sharp portrayal of the autodidact eldest son of the Sugden clan.",1362960000,,353,4.883333333333334
