7875822,5,6304597819,"This video shows a score of live performance bits, including the seven words in 3 or 4 of the performance bits.  It shows him at various ages from young to balding and greying  where you can see him performing live.  It tops his CD's because you see him live and see and hear the auduence's break-up reactions. Carlin is unique and unsurpassed.  I could not recommend this video more highly.",1026259200,28,391,4.542857142857143
7875823,4,6304597819,"Well now, it appears we've hit the mother lode with this gem of a comdy video! the reason for me stating so is that it, fortunatly and mercifully contains only classic pre '90's standup material for the absolute pleasure  and enjoyment of Mr. Carlin's formerly devoted audience. I especially  appreciate the presence of the '77 and '78 routines (blue and black shirts,  respectively) that really stand out in the selection of ""stuff""  from times past that this video showcases. The material from '82,'84, and  '86 is not legendary but still not too bad. However, the '88 and '90 parts  are strictly mediocre and forgettable, I truly feel. Anyway, I am extremely  glad that this, as well as the recent release of the ""Little David  Years"" box set exists on the comedy album market today, in order to  inspire up-and-comers and to remind us that the ""Former Great""  really did use to deliver memorable monologues that did more than make us  laugh, they made us think as well. The most important thing for comedy fans  to remember is: Classic Carlin is Cool!",948412800,29,1055,4.767955801104972
