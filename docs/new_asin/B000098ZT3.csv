The film begins with a view of Lower Manhattan and the ferry slip (as seen when coming from Staten Island). [How many of those buildings are still there?] We see the shops on the street. [Anyone recognize the streets? In the 1960s the Washington Street Market was demolished.] Teenagers play dice on the sidewalk. [No other games because of costly equipment?] One boy tries to take a cut. A prisoner ""Knuckles"" is taken out of his cell, but he won't talk. What will happen to his young brother Danny? Can the kids be saved by a club? Can the counterfeiters be caught? Will the boys break into a railroad boxcar? [In lower Manhattan?] ""Wanna join our gang?"" Most parents don't know what their kids are doing. Why do those kids have ""idle time""? No chores at home? Parental neglect?

The boys will learn boxing, wrestling, gymnastics, etc. in an environment under their control. [No mention of a proper diet?] The old Pledge of Allegiance is recited. Schmidt is right. The Commissioner is afraid the boy's club may become a political club! The police find a California car with a plate for counterfeit money! We learn about this gang. Note the switch of the package! Mile-Away has a plan to spread a lot of counterfeit money. The boys get a ""Junior Police"" badge, they are to look out for strangers and the phony money. One man wants the boys to deliver advertising notices ($1 for every 300 notices). What happened to that missing $5 plate? Pat is under suspicion.

The counterfeiters have a clever way to spread their phoney money around. The police all hear the same excuse: it came in a circular in the mailbox. The counterfeiters plan to pass phony $20 bills now that everyone is looking for phoney $5 bills! Suspicion falls on Pat again. The gang is getting ready to run out of state. The detective follows the delivery of the bag to 126th street, then runs into the flat and finds the goods. Harris shoots him, and they escape. (Harris is called Mile-Away because of his alibis). Pat investigates Schmidt's store. The action picks up. An amateur radio set is used for communications. The gang leaves, can they be caught? Will Danny use a big wrench? Can the boys use a portable radio in their pursuit? There is a struggle on the roof top, who will fall? The bullet in Harris' gun are traced to the murder blamed on ""Knuckles"", who is released. So there is a happy ending.

This drama must have been popular enough to create a series of ""East Side Kids"" movies in the 1940s. Was it just the youth audience? This series used to be a filler on week-end television in the early days.",1471046400,,2611,4.584582441113491

7990183,1,B000098ZT3,"I got these DVDs for my brother for Christmas. He was so excited, was talking about watching episodes of The Bowery Boys when he was little. The quality of sound and picture was so bad these DVDs were unwatchable. Looks like someone recorded these standing in front of a bad tv set, then burned them to DVD. Hate to say it, but these are just not worth the money. If someone made the jump to digital and did it the correct way, the collection would be a treasure.",1232496000,5,463,4.2727272727272725

If you are expecting the comedy series you will be disappointed.

If you are expecting heavy city drama this is for you.",1109203200,27,212,4.275
