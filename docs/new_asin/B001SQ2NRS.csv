8340056,5,B001SQ2NRS,This is my second time ordering this item. I had original bought the first many years ago at a random store.  When the original was no longer playable I was happy to find it on Amazon!  I play it at night in my TV.  It gives a soothing back ground while my family settled into their night time routine. I will order it again should my current DVD becomes unusable!,1449014400,,364,4.171428571428572

8340059,5,B001SQ2NRS,"This aquarium has 8 different aquariums you can choose from, and audio options (you can choose between waves, gentle music, or bubbles). My son has autism and this has proven to be a nice video before bedtime. Definitely a recommended buy!",1353628800,3,239,4.853658536585366
8340060,5,B001SQ2NRS,The picture is so realistic and the sound options is a big plus.  I have this playing at work on a HD t.v. on my desk and have a bamboo plant behind it.  Makes it look like a real fish tank.  Well buy other relection DVDs,1353196800,3,221,3.760869565217391
