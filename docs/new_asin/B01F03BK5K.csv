I have not listened to much Powerwolf in the past but I love live concerts.  From what I have seen so far, I will be watching this over and over.",1470268800,6,322,4.316666666666666

8759889,4,B01F03BK5K,"I really like Powerwolf and the songs included are the best. One thing though that bothers me when I watch is the apparent little lag between video and audio. So Attila's mouth is always off the audio. It doesn't compromise the overall experience, but it annoys me.",1474934400,,265,4.659574468085107
8759890,5,B01F03BK5K,"Amazing shows of an awesome band. The DVDs are region-free (thank goodness), and quality is amazing. Wellworthy purchase for any Powerwolf fan!",1474416000,,143,5.545454545454546
8759891,4,B01F03BK5K,"If you are into what some call EuroMetal and Powerwolf, a live recording containing all their best, and if you understand German (which I do), other than one song where the crowd  overwhelmed the song, it was an excellent  Live ""Best Hits"".
Big fave now of my 15 year old son who also is into FFDP, so relevant to those so inclined.",1473552000,,332,4.338709677419355
8759892,5,B01F03BK5K,"I bought the dvd version because I wasn't sure about region locking, but the quality is still great on dvd (though now I regret not getting bluray since it's region free)!

All of the live recordings have been produced well, the sound quality is superb. It is great that they not only include footage of the band during the concerts, but also the fans. Powerwolf is such a high energy band and seeing crowd interactions is very fun. The setlist they play is great, though there isn't much variation between shows. I love all of Powerwolf's stuff so it isn't really a problem, cause they kill it every time! I get chills even just watching these shows on dvd.
The tour documentation has subs, but unfortunately the festival one doesn't (nor subs for crowd interaction at Oberhausen but it seems to be mostly the same as the other shows).

If you're a huge fan of Powerwolf like me, this is an absolute must buy for you. I will be watching these dvds over and over...hopefully some time Powerwolf will come tour in America.",1473033600,3,1021,4.573770491803279
8759893,5,B01F03BK5K,"Amazing. Great quality, sound and picture. Comes with 3 disc. Two blurays (also has a documentary). And a live cd. Also has a bunch of pictures of their live performances.",1471996800,,171,4.733333333333333
8759894,5,B01F03BK5K,"First of all: Let me clarify that this Blu-Ray set does play on my North American Xbox One and PS4.

This is comprised of two Blu-Ray discs. The first disc has two different shows (with slightly different setlists). Second disc has one additional show with a slightly longer set (there's also a supplementary cd of this show). The band performance in all 3 shows was great. Great sound, energy, attitude and good production. Each disc has its own complementary documentary which are very informative and entertaining. The setlists includes songs off each Powerwolf (except off their 'Return in Bloodred' debut). I must admit that I'm a little disappointed that they drew too little off their sophomore album 'Lupus Dei' only the title track was played on all 3 shows. I really missed tracks like 'Saturday Satan' (first Powerwolf song I've heard and made me a fan). The setlists heavily drew off their last 3 records. No complaints there. I love all their albums.

I think this 3 disc set is a must for any true metal fan. Enjoy!

LET THERE BE NIGHT.",1471996800,3,1050,4.758241758241758
