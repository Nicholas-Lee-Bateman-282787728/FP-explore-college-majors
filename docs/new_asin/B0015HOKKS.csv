3144759,5,B0015HOKKS,Beautifully crafted movie depicting the difficult and multi-layered relationship between father and son.

I really cannot answer this question.  But pondering the question the movie puts forth, with the amazing actors in this movie, is worth the viewing.  For days after I watch this movie, memories surface.

3144770,4,B0015HOKKS,"This movie is shockingly honest in its plea to cherish those closest to you no matter their failings.  Based on a true story, this movie explores the spectrum of emotions author, Blake Morrison processes throughout his childhood and adulthood as he reflects on various incidents between he and his father, the weeks preceding his father death.

Blake realizes at an early age that his father and a family friend are having a long-term affair.  His feelings of betrayal and for the devastation it causes his mother, runs deep with anger.  He wants to understand, believing that if he can understand why each person in his family ignores the elephant in the room, that healing can take place particularly for him.  Yet, no one is willing to be honest.  This leads him to act out in various ways he later regrets.  However, he attains new appreciation for each person involved and finally accepts that we are all imperfect and have our frailties.  We must love despite of the pain and choose to forgive.

The movie is subtle and the messages are not blatant just as you would expect of the British.  In addition, to well written dialogue, the movie had some beautiful scenery.  You feel as though you are along with Blake during his journey of exploration into his unprocessed feelings of rejection, distrust and betrayal.  At the same time, you realize that sometimes the hardest people to love are those you love the most.

This movie is for anyone, who feels they could never live up to the expectations their parents have for them, and those who feel their parent's failed live up to their expectations, as well.  If you ever pondered how they (parents) could see things so differently and yet in spite of this you want nothing more than their approval, this will offer some catharsis.

It is not all bleak, there are even a few laugh out loud scenes.  Though not at all maudlin, you may just want to have a tissue handy.",1408147200,,1922,4.675595238095238

The fact that there are 1 and 2-star reviews here at Amazon simply proves once again that some folks aren't emotionally or intellectually equipped to appreciate a good drama. And that's why Hollywood pumps out so much pure trash; for those that are incapable of detecting the stench.",1407801600,,522,4.931818181818182
3144773,4,B0015HOKKS,"His father, Dr. Arthur Morrison, was the town physician; an outrageous character who was at once fun yet cruel, unpredictable, a control freak, unfaithful, and with whom Blake never attained a warm communication.

3144780,4,B0015HOKKS,"Great Seller...~not as great pick on MY part for obscure movies~After I watched this movie, I realized that Colin Firth plays kind of dark-ish roles and if he's supposedly the primary character, it's a little skewed that you don't realize hes the lead, and seems more of a supporting role. Some things are implied and sometimes I was left in question whether the event occurred or not. I didn't like the portrayal that he is loyal to his family-wife and young kids--only to go to his family home and daydream about re-living some lust that he shared with this family's young housekeeper.~I didn't see the point--maybe he's drawing a parallel to his father's life...to show a devoted cheating father? Though...I wouldn't have minded him getting up from the tub :) haha~ I hated the stand-by-your cheating man version of his mother and the disrespect his father showed his wife...even when she was equivalent in education, as I resume she was also a doctor in her own right--by having his mistress (AUNT BEATY) always in HER home, flaunting this affair and exposing his children to all that... and was Josie truly the product of his father and Aunt Beaty? It would've been nice if Colin Firth's character manned up and confronted his childhood fears and these questions toward his father. It would've been nice if this continued frontal level of disrespect toward his mother would've been due to her own indiscretions or devotion to her own work/occupations. But in the end it only showed she stayed because she loved him...that was a little lame. Too bad Firth's character didn't have the passion to devote to his own present circumstance over the memories of his past. It would've been nice to see the young character charm better than his dad that young girl during their vacation. I actually thought his dad was going to bed the young girl and I would've been bummed for the teenage boy. I know...too much to include in a film, but story development seem to depend on the viewer's intuition to keep from spelling things out clearly. Without enough, as was this film, it was more unsatisfying than thought provoking~",1341878400,,2117,4.8347107438016526
3144781,3,B0015HOKKS,"Jim Broadbent, Colin Firth, and Juliet Stevenson were the stars in this little known movie.  I don't know if the theme is all that unusual as there have been many of these father/son films where the son never quite measures up to the expectations of the father and when the latter is confronted with a fatal illness there is all of these unfulfilled emotions, guilt, and a desire for some sort of resolution.  In the end the son is trying to come to terms with who his father really was, hence, the title ""When Did You Last See Your Father"" or ""How Did You Last See Your Father.""",1339977600,,579,4.351851851851852

3144783,4,B0015HOKKS,"This film delves into the intricate topic of a complex father-son relationship. Jim Broadbent is terrific as the larger-than-life father, who becomes very human and vulnerable due to illness. Colin Firth is incredible as the conflicted, successful son who is nevertheless haunted by his rocky relationship with his father. He is such a subtle actor- whose face and body language convey so much emotion. The scene at the end where he finally confronts his loss and grief is heart-wrenching. Juliet Stevenson gives a strong performance as the stoic, strong English housewife. Cinematography of the English countryside is beautiful and touching.",1332028800,,642,5.43
3144784,5,B0015HOKKS,"Humourous, poignant, this account of a father-son relationship is well-crafted cinematographically, well acted, and realistic. Dad Broadbent is convincingly dislikable, a man who never knocks, and is never wrong.  The young Blake Morrison is utterly charming.  The scenery is beautiful. By the closing scenes I too was recollecting those last times and moments I saw my father as he was in his last years, and wishing I knew more about him in his younger days.

I love Colin Firth, but this movie was quite depressing, and his performance was not up to ""Pride and Prejudice"" standards..",1276992000,,138,5.043478260869565
3144790,5,B0015HOKKS,"This was a movie that gave so much.  The way Anand Tucker filmed this movie was captivating - using mirror image for the grown Blake,the teenage Blake gave such emotional looks - you could almost read his thoughts.  Colin Firth and Jim B - gave outstanding performances.  Someone on here compared Colin Firth to Hugh Grant or said he was trying to act like him .... never will there be a day in his life that Hugh Grant could act any of the roles Colin Firth portrays beautifully.  I always buy movies that Colin Firth is in - because I know without question, he will take me inside the characters head - and make every scene believable.

I must say again how incredible the director was - the way he filmed this movie was very unique and added so much to the story, it helped show the mood of all the people involved in this stressful period of life.  As a person who has lost both mother and father - it is a good thing to see, you are not the only one who had unresolved questions and many unsaid things you would have liked to express before you had to let a parent go.

Great job to all involved in this great ride.",1268697600,,1120,4.205607476635514
3144791,4,B0015HOKKS,"""When Did You Last See Your Father?""
(2008)
----------------------------------------------
This is a thoughtful, multi-layered drama about a middle-aged man coming to terms with his father's death, and the termination of their rocky father-son relationship.  Jim Broadbent is brilliant as the father, an irascible, self-centered (but often charming) curmudgeon who uses his strong personality and social skills to dominate and belittle his son, constantly criticizing him and discounting his accomplishments. The story is told in flashbacks, with Colin Firth as the adult son, and well-matched by the other actors who play him in younger years.

The son's memories are painful and sharp, but as the film goes on, we see that his perceptions are not always to be trusted, and indeed, on reexamining the childhood incidents that helped shape his life, he realizes with adult hindsight that perhaps all is not what it seems. The emotional core of this nuanced film is made all the more powerful by the closing scenes in which the father dies at home -- the scenes of homecare and dealing with the sick and the dying are not images often explored in our culture, and may be uncomfortable for some, cathartic for others.  A fine film, with excellent performances throughout.  (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Film Reviews)",1259625600,,1306,5.23444976076555
3144792,5,B0015HOKKS,"Having recently lost my father, I hoped that this film would help me to look into our relationship, to grieve, to let my feelings come to the fore in private, for myself beyond the (very helpful) rituals we have of letting go.  Although the film relationship was of course very different from the one I had with my father, it brilliantly addresses the universal issues between fathers and sons:  there are so many memories - of fun, perceived slights, love, and anger - that swirl in the mind for the rest of the son's life.  The son, Blake,  has questions he wants to resolve, yet they can't really talk about them, even as his father lies on his deathbed.  Blake struggles with disappointment in his charming and manipulative father, whose flaws and strengths, whose caring and occasional carelessness, remain present in his imagination every single day, with the specificity of recall you would expect of a poet.  It is so primal in love, so raw in striving and competition, as the son takes his own path and the father is left behind yet still living within him.

The father's last days are also portrayed with painful intimacy.  Unless one has experienced it, it is hard to comprehend what it is like to watch a parent slip away as the body fails, yet this film portrays it with realism and empathy, with fabulously nuanced acting.

You see the father as a great spirit, as a selfish jerk, as a charmer of ""other"" women, as a joker indulgent of his son's desires, as the only  person who can give certain things, as full of his own needs yet caring.  It is funny, sad, enraging, and loving all at the same time.  These emotions washed over me as I watched this film, truly a cathartic experience that reduced me at times to tears.

This is a mature film, a masterpiece that approaches the complexity of life.  Blake too is a flawed character, though his life is more or less on track.  THe film ends with a wonderfully ambiguous optimism, summing up the exasperation and love all at the same moment.  The mother is also subtly present, though not at the center of the story.  In my view, the balance was right.

Warmly recommended.  But do not expect a comedy - it is painful and uplifting realism at its best.",1258243200,,2215,4.547979797979798
3144793,3,B0015HOKKS,"Jim Broadbent is one of our greatest living actors and he is incapable of giving a bad performance.  This is a difficult role for him, since the character he plays is radically flawed and not particularly likeable.  The story concerns his son's attempts to reconnect with him as he approaches death.  It is told in flashbacks and it is touching in moments and beautifully filmed throughout.  The problem is that it lacks a clear structure, a plot arc that successfully shapes the action and effects an emotional and intellectual response.  With such an arc, each scene advances the action and multiplies its impact.  Here the story meanders and the emotional interplay of the characters fails to reach a satisfactory, layered conclusion.  As some of the Amazon reviewers have noted, the film will not lack an audience because many would watch Colin Firth reading the phone book.  I don't think one should miss any performance by Broadbent, but to see him at the absolute top of his form, see Topsy-Turvy.  Firth is an actor with more range than some give him credit for; see him in the very interesting film, The Advocate.",1233964800,,1122,4.832460732984293
3144794,4,B0015HOKKS,"Very touching film about complex father son relationship.  When father is diagnosed with cancer, his son goes through a flashback of the events from his early adolescence that explains the strained relationship between father and son.  Father had a greater than life personality, while son was more introverted and emotional.  Long time ago indiscretions commited by the father seem irreconcilable to the son.  His attempt to get answers is impeded by the terrible sickness that seems to take over the situation.

It is a touching story about parent child relationship.  It is also a story about grief and the fact that sometimes we would rather have our parents around so we can hate them then loose them to death and life long sorrow for not being able to have them around ourselves except in our memories.

Wonderful cast of very fine British actors.  Fantastic story about one very special father one would love to have around no matter what.",1232236800,,946,4.90566037735849
3144795,4,B0015HOKKS,"Colin Furth and Jim Broadbent are wonderful actors.  This movie is painful as relations between child and parents frequently are.  Question is whether the good times outweigh the bad.  Blake's father was abusive.  Not physically but verbally and that can be almost as bad.  I think he was more forgiving of his father at the end than I would have been.

While watching this film I was reminded of a film from the seventies with Gene Hackman and Melvyn Douglas which was based on a stage play of the same name, ""I Never Sang for My Father,"" about a son coming to care for his miserable, abusive elderly father whose wife had just died.  Another heartbreaking film about sons and fathers and the responsibilities of children to their sometimes abusive parents.

Both pictures leave food for thought.",1229472000,,797,4.766423357664234

3144797,5,B0015HOKKS,"What a wonderful movie! Seeing it, many of us will remember how we just hated our fathers for no good reasons, to find out that we miss them so much after they passed away. The performance of Colin Firth and Jim Broadbent is so genuine, that one will easiliy forget that they are just actors rendering to screen Blake Morrison's contradicting feelings about his father.",1229385600,,369,4.6923076923076925
3144798,4,B0015HOKKS,"I see that a reviewer believed that Colin Firth was trying to be Hugh Grant.  I can almost detect why they would feel that way.  This is a complex film with multiple time frames, and sometimes it seems that Firth is grasping to get just the right emotion, whereas Jim Broadbent, who plays his not so faithful dad, pulls it off effortlessly.  The  best supporting actor, however, goes to Matthew Beard who plays Firth's character as a teen.  Look for him in the future.
As for the film, it is one of those movies that will touch you if you had a father that you always wanted to talk to but never had the opportunity, for whatever reason.  Tear jerker for some, blank stares from others, depending on who you are.  It's just one of those movies.",1228089600,,744,4.386861313868613
3144799,5,B0015HOKKS,"Like FIELD OF DREAMS, this is a movie that is going to make grown men cry, because it is a universal story about things left unresolved between fathers and sons.

Colin Firth plays an accomplished writer and poet, who comes to his parents' home to spend a few days with his dying father (Jim Broadbent).  A country doctor, Broadbent has never openly approved of his son's course in life.  There has been an emotional barrier between the two men since Firth was a teenager.

Much of the movie, exquisitely directed by Anand Tucker, is a flashback, as Firth recalls how Broadbent often exhibited boorish behavior.  He also suspected that Broadbent may have had a romantic liaison with his wife's sister.

In the end, as in all relationships between parent and child, some questions do remain unanswered.

Juliet Stevenson and Gina McKee co-star in this rich,  beautifully photographed drama, adapted from the autobiographical book by Blake Morrison.

DVD extras include audio commentary by Tucker and deleted scenes.",1227225600,,1014,5.0602409638554215
3144800,4,B0015HOKKS,"Based on an autobiographical memoir by Blake Morrison WHEN DID YOU LAST SEE YOUR FATHER? is a finely wrought exploration into the delicate issues that both separate and bind fathers and sons.  It is difficult for viewers whose fathers are gone not to relate to the profound tenderness and at times difficult reminiscences of their own relationships that remain as both warm and haunting dreams.  David Nicholls' adaptation of Morrison's book stresses the character development of both father and son (and the rest of this British family) allowing us to understand the dilemma that faces the main character as he is asked the question that forms the title of this film.

Blake Morrison (Colin Firth) is happily married to Kathy (Gina McKee) and is a successful writer/poet who is preparing to receive an award for his contributions to literature. Present at his ceremony is his father Dr. Arthur Morrison (Jim Broadbent) who is a unique egomaniac whose personality traits affect everyone around him - both positively and negatively. After Blake's acceptance speech his father cannot even manage to say 'well done', instead  furthers his comments about Blake's silly decision not to go into medicine and strive instead for the poor life of a writer.  A medical emergency tosses Arthur into the hospital, he is diagnosed with terminal cancer: the remainder of the film is a series of vignettes of Blake at his father's bedside accompanied by his mother Kim (Juliet Stephenson) coupled with flashbacks to Blake's childhood (Matthew Beard plays Blake as a teenager) memories that contain moments of confusing father/son incidents as well as Blake's long standing loathing of his fathers affairs with other women such as 'Aunt Beaty' (Sarah Lancashire) and others.  As Arthur falls more deeply toward dying, Blake attempts to confront his father with his lifelong perceptions and grievances and the manner in which Blake comes to grips with his feelings for his father completes this film.

Director Anand Tucker orchestrates this story beautifully, blending the gorgeous English countryside with just the right timing between momentary flashbacks and flash forwards to make this film flow and glow with nostalgia.  The musical score by Barrington Pheloung  wisely incorporates a lovely rendition of Bellini's 'Casta diva' from 'Norma', Bach's G Minor Piano Concerto, and a Schubert trio, which add a timeless dimension to the mood of the film.  Jim Broadbent brings off this challenging role with great artistry, as does Colin Firth with his role as Blake.  But then the entire cast is well selected from some of England's finest actors.  This is an emotional film, a film  that will touch men especially, but will also bring resonance with women.  Grady Harp, November 08",1226793600,,2767,5.174887892376682

3144802,3,B0015HOKKS,"Based on a true story from Blake Morrison's autobiographical account of his relationship with his father, When Did You Last See Your Father? becomes a near-tear jerker in the final act. It's a gorgeously shot film that never calls itself out, as the film is subdued and restrained in its approach. Even with rain and mist, the English country sides have never looked prettier.

Colin Firth and Jim Broadbent are superb as the film's anchors. Broadbent's playfulness as the father is offset by Firth's turn as the son, who is introvert and a bit stuffy. The film balances scenes with them, with scenes of Blake as a by growing up. Blake's misunderstanding of his father is played out in a kaleidoscope of memories.

I like the film a lot; with the way it handles how the son never fully understands his father. Through his eyes, he is bold and silly, forcing him into situations he'd rather not be in, like camping or embarrassing him when he's with a girl. The film feels too much like a series of scenes that are only strung together by the appearance of Blake and his father. It isn't until the middle section when it starts to come together in a sad but intelligent way.

His father is quickly dying from cancer and seeing him weak and immobile, Blake asks if he can have one good talk with him soon. He agrees. Will Blake ever have it and settle the issues he has with his father? The film tackles haunting subjects and re-examines the film's title in an interesting way. When was the last time Blake (or us) really seen our father? Was it at the funeral or his sick bed? These questions are answered and are quite emotionally charged.

Even memories are examined again as the director uses some interesting angles captured within mirrors, crafting subtle ways in which to view things from different points of view. When Did You Last See Your Father? is a gripping, soft, subdued film, worthy of your time if you are looking for a well-made drama that isn't afraid of exposing truths within its characters or even perhaps within yourself.

3144803,2,B0015HOKKS,"I watched this film simply because Jim Broadbent is in it.  He is one of those actors who could not give a bad performance in his sleep.  Colin Firth is a bit too ""Hugh Grant"" for me, but I was willing to endure him simply for Mr. Broadbent.  However, I don't 'get' the film.  Supposedly, it is an exploration of a father/son relationship.  In the film, Mr. Broadbent's character (the father) has a lifelong affair with another woman, occasionally calls his son 'fat-head' and exposes other human flaws, but other than that appears to be an involved and caring father.  It leaves you thinking that Mr. Firth's character (the son) is just a selfish whiner who spent his life alienating himself from his father for no reason.  Perhaps the book explored the potholes of their relationship more fully; the film sure doesn't.",1226102400,,820,4.732394366197183

3379267,4,B0015HOKKS,"This movie is shockingly honest in its plea to cherish those closest to you no matter their failings.  Based on a true story, this movie explores the spectrum of emotions author, Blake Morrison processes throughout his childhood and adulthood as he reflects on various incidents between he and his father, the weeks preceding his father death.

Blake realizes at an early age that his father and a family friend are having a long-term affair.  His feelings of betrayal and for the devastation it causes his mother, runs deep with anger.  He wants to understand, believing that if he can understand why each person in his family ignores the elephant in the room, that healing can take place particularly for him.  Yet, no one is willing to be honest.  This leads him to act out in various ways he later regrets.  However, he attains new appreciation for each person involved and finally accepts that we are all imperfect and have our frailties.  We must love despite of the pain and choose to forgive.

The movie is subtle and the messages are not blatant just as you would expect of the British.  In addition, to well written dialogue, the movie had some beautiful scenery.  You feel as though you are along with Blake during his journey of exploration into his unprocessed feelings of rejection, distrust and betrayal.  At the same time, you realize that sometimes the hardest people to love are those you love the most.

This movie is for anyone, who feels they could never live up to the expectations their parents have for them, and those who feel their parent's failed live up to their expectations, as well.  If you ever pondered how they (parents) could see things so differently and yet in spite of this you want nothing more than their approval, this will offer some catharsis.

It is not all bleak, there are even a few laugh out loud scenes.  Though not at all maudlin, you may just want to have a tissue handy.",1408147200,,1922,4.675595238095238

3379277,4,B0015HOKKS,"Great Seller...~not as great pick on MY part for obscure movies~After I watched this movie, I realized that Colin Firth plays kind of dark-ish roles and if he's supposedly the primary character, it's a little skewed that you don't realize hes the lead, and seems more of a supporting role. Some things are implied and sometimes I was left in question whether the event occurred or not. I didn't like the portrayal that he is loyal to his family-wife and young kids--only to go to his family home and daydream about re-living some lust that he shared with this family's young housekeeper.~I didn't see the point--maybe he's drawing a parallel to his father's life...to show a devoted cheating father? Though...I wouldn't have minded him getting up from the tub :) haha~ I hated the stand-by-your cheating man version of his mother and the disrespect his father showed his wife...even when she was equivalent in education, as I resume she was also a doctor in her own right--by having his mistress (AUNT BEATY) always in HER home, flaunting this affair and exposing his children to all that... and was Josie truly the product of his father and Aunt Beaty? It would've been nice if Colin Firth's character manned up and confronted his childhood fears and these questions toward his father. It would've been nice if this continued frontal level of disrespect toward his mother would've been due to her own indiscretions or devotion to her own work/occupations. But in the end it only showed she stayed because she loved him...that was a little lame. Too bad Firth's character didn't have the passion to devote to his own present circumstance over the memories of his past. It would've been nice to see the young character charm better than his dad that young girl during their vacation. I actually thought his dad was going to bed the young girl and I would've been bummed for the teenage boy. I know...too much to include in a film, but story development seem to depend on the viewer's intuition to keep from spelling things out clearly.

3379288,4,B0015HOKKS,"""When Did You Last See Your Father?""
(2008)
----------------------------------------------
This is a thoughtful, multi-layered drama about a middle-aged man coming to terms with his father's death, and the termination of their rocky father-son relationship.  Jim Broadbent is brilliant as the father, an irascible, self-centered (but often charming) curmudgeon who uses his strong personality and social skills to dominate and belittle his son, constantly criticizing him and discounting his accomplishments. The story is told in flashbacks, with Colin Firth as the adult son, and well-matched by the other actors who play him in younger years.

The son's memories are painful and sharp, but as the film goes on, we see that his perceptions are not always to be trusted, and indeed, on reexamining the childhood incidents that helped shape his life, he realizes with adult hindsight that perhaps all is not what it seems. The emotional core of this nuanced film is made all the more powerful by the closing scenes in which the father dies at home -- the scenes of homecare and dealing with the sick and the dying are not images often explored in our culture, and may be uncomfortable for some, cathartic for others.  A fine film, with excellent performances throughout.  (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Film Reviews)",1259625600,,1306,5.23444976076555
3379289,5,B0015HOKKS,"Having recently lost my father, I hoped that this film would help me to look into our relationship, to grieve, to let my feelings come to the fore in private, for myself beyond the (very helpful) rituals we have of letting go.  Although the film relationship was of course very different from the one I had with my father, it brilliantly addresses the universal issues between fathers and sons:  there are so many memories - of fun, perceived slights, love, and anger - that swirl in the mind for the rest of the son's life.  The son, Blake,  has questions he wants to resolve, yet they can't really talk about them, even as his father lies on his deathbed.  Blake struggles with disappointment in his charming and manipulative father, whose flaws and strengths, whose caring and occasional carelessness, remain present in his imagination every single day, with the specificity of recall you would expect of a poet.  It is so primal in love, so raw in striving and competition, as the son takes his own path and the father is left behind yet still living within him.

The father's last days are also portrayed with painful intimacy.  Unless one has experienced it, it is hard to comprehend what it is like to watch a parent slip away as the body fails, yet this film portrays it with realism and empathy, with fabulously nuanced acting.

You see the father as a great spirit, as a selfish jerk, as a charmer of ""other"" women, as a joker indulgent of his son's desires, as the only  person who can give certain things, as full of his own needs yet caring.  It is funny, sad, enraging, and loving all at the same time.  These emotions washed over me as I watched this film, truly a cathartic experience that reduced me at times to tears.

This is a mature film, a masterpiece that approaches the complexity of life.  Blake too is a flawed character, though his life is more or less on track.  THe film ends with a wonderfully ambiguous optimism, summing up the exasperation and love all at the same moment.  The mother is also subtly present, though not at the center of the story.  In my view, the balance was right.

Warmly recommended.  But do not expect a comedy - it is painful and uplifting realism at its best.",1258243200,,2215,4.547979797979798
3379290,3,B0015HOKKS,"Jim Broadbent is one of our greatest living actors and he is incapable of giving a bad performance.  This is a difficult role for him, since the character he plays is radically flawed and not particularly likeable.  The story concerns his son's attempts to reconnect with him as he approaches death.  It is told in flashbacks and it is touching in moments and beautifully filmed throughout.  The problem is that it lacks a clear structure, a plot arc that successfully shapes the action and effects an emotional and intellectual response.  With such an arc, each scene advances the action and multiplies its impact.  Here the story meanders and the emotional interplay of the characters fails to reach a satisfactory, layered conclusion.  As some of the Amazon reviewers have noted, the film will not lack an audience because many would watch Colin Firth reading the phone book.  I don't think one should miss any performance by Broadbent, but to see him at the absolute top of his form, see Topsy-Turvy.  Firth is an actor with more range than some give him credit for; see him in the very interesting film, The Advocate.",1233964800,,1122,4.832460732984293
3379291,4,B0015HOKKS,"Very touching film about complex father son relationship.  When father is diagnosed with cancer, his son goes through a flashback of the events from his early adolescence that explains the strained relationship between father and son.  Father had a greater than life personality, while son was more introverted and emotional.  Long time ago indiscretions commited by the father seem irreconcilable to the son.  His attempt to get answers is impeded by the terrible sickness that seems to take over the situation.

It is a touching story about parent child relationship.  It is also a story about grief and the fact that sometimes we would rather have our parents around so we can hate them then loose them to death and life long sorrow for not being able to have them around ourselves except in our memories.

Wonderful cast of very fine British actors.  Fantastic story about one very special father one would love to have around no matter what.",1232236800,,946,4.90566037735849
3379292,4,B0015HOKKS,"Colin Furth and Jim Broadbent are wonderful actors.  This movie is painful as relations between child and parents frequently are.  Question is whether the good times outweigh the bad.  Blake's father was abusive.  Not physically but verbally and that can be almost as bad.  I think he was more forgiving of his father at the end than I would have been.

While watching this film I was reminded of a film from the seventies with Gene Hackman and Melvyn Douglas which was based on a stage play of the same name, ""I Never Sang for My Father,"" about a son coming to care for his miserable, abusive elderly father whose wife had just died.  Another heartbreaking film about sons and fathers and the responsibilities of children to their sometimes abusive parents.

This is a complex film with multiple time frames, and sometimes it seems that Firth is grasping to get just the right emotion, whereas Jim Broadbent, who plays his not so faithful dad, pulls it off effortlessly.  The  best supporting actor, however, goes to Matthew Beard who plays Firth's character as a teen.  Look for him in the future.
As for the film, it is one of those movies that will touch you if you had a father that you always wanted to talk to but never had the opportunity, for whatever reason.  Tear jerker for some, blank stares from others, depending on who you are.  It's just one of those movies.",1228089600,,744,4.386861313868613
3379296,5,B0015HOKKS,"Like FIELD OF DREAMS, this is a movie that is going to make grown men cry, because it is a universal story about things left unresolved between fathers and sons.

Colin Firth plays an accomplished writer and poet, who comes to his parents' home to spend a few days with his dying father (Jim Broadbent).  A country doctor, Broadbent has never openly approved of his son's course in life.  There has been an emotional barrier between the two men since Firth was a teenager.

Much of the movie, exquisitely directed by Anand Tucker, is a flashback, as Firth recalls how Broadbent often exhibited boorish behavior.  He also suspected that Broadbent may have had a romantic liaison with his wife's sister.

In the end, as in all relationships between parent and child, some questions do remain unanswered.

David Nicholls' adaptation of Morrison's book stresses the character development of both father and son (and the rest of this British family) allowing us to understand the dilemma that faces the main character as he is asked the question that forms the title of this film.

Blake Morrison (Colin Firth) is happily married to Kathy (Gina McKee) and is a successful writer/poet who is preparing to receive an award for his contributions to literature. Present at his ceremony is his father Dr. Arthur Morrison (Jim Broadbent) who is a unique egomaniac whose personality traits affect everyone around him - both positively and negatively. After Blake's acceptance speech his father cannot even manage to say 'well done', instead  furthers his comments about Blake's silly decision not to go into medicine and strive instead for the poor life of a writer.  A medical emergency tosses Arthur into the hospital, he is diagnosed with terminal cancer: the remainder of the film is a series of vignettes of Blake at his father's bedside accompanied by his mother Kim (Juliet Stephenson) coupled with flashbacks to Blake's childhood (Matthew Beard plays Blake as a teenager) memories that contain moments of confusing father/son incidents as well as Blake's long standing loathing of his fathers affairs with other women such as 'Aunt Beaty' (Sarah Lancashire) and others.  As Arthur falls more deeply toward dying, Blake attempts to confront his father with his lifelong perceptions and grievances and the manner in which Blake comes to grips with his feelings for his father completes this film.

Director Anand Tucker orchestrates this story beautifully, blending the gorgeous English countryside with just the right timing between momentary flashbacks and flash forwards to make this film flow and glow with nostalgia.  The musical score by Barrington Pheloung  wisely incorporates a lovely rendition of Bellini's 'Casta diva' from 'Norma', Bach's G Minor Piano Concerto, and a Schubert trio, which add a timeless dimension to the mood of the film.  Jim Broadbent brings off this challenging role with great artistry, as does Colin Firth with his role as Blake.  But then the entire cast is well selected from some of England's finest actors.  This is an emotional film, a film  that will touch men especially, but will also bring resonance with women.  Grady Harp, November 08",1226793600,,2767,5.174887892376682

3379299,3,B0015HOKKS,"Based on a true story from Blake Morrison's autobiographical account of his relationship with his father, When Did You Last See Your Father? becomes a near-tear jerker in the final act. It's a gorgeously shot film that never calls itself out, as the film is subdued and restrained in its approach. Even with rain and mist, the English country sides have never looked prettier.

Colin Firth and Jim Broadbent are superb as the film's anchors. Broadbent's playfulness as the father is offset by Firth's turn as the son, who is introvert and a bit stuffy. The film balances scenes with them, with scenes of Blake as a by growing up. Blake's misunderstanding of his father is played out in a kaleidoscope of memories.

I like the film a lot; with the way it handles how the son never fully understands his father. Through his eyes, he is bold and silly, forcing him into situations he'd rather not be in, like camping or embarrassing him when he's with a girl. The film feels too much like a series of scenes that are only strung together by the appearance of Blake and his father. It isn't until the middle section when it starts to come together in a sad but intelligent way.

His father is quickly dying from cancer and seeing him weak and immobile, Blake asks if he can have one good talk with him soon. He agrees. Will Blake ever have it and settle the issues he has with his father? The film tackles haunting subjects and re-examines the film's title in an interesting way. When was the last time Blake (or us) really seen our father? Was it at the funeral or his sick bed? These questions are answered and are quite emotionally charged.

Even memories are examined again as the director uses some interesting angles captured within mirrors, crafting subtle ways in which to view things from different points of view. When Did You Last See Your Father? is a gripping, soft, subdued film, worthy of your time if you are looking for a well-made drama that isn't afraid of exposing truths within its characters or even perhaps within yourself.

3379300,2,B0015HOKKS,"I watched this film simply because Jim Broadbent is in it.  He is one of those actors who could not give a bad performance in his sleep.  Colin Firth is a bit too ""Hugh Grant"" for me, but I was willing to endure him simply for Mr. Broadbent.  However, I don't 'get' the film.  Supposedly, it is an exploration of a father/son relationship.  In the film, Mr. Broadbent's character (the father) has a lifelong affair with another woman, occasionally calls his son 'fat-head' and exposes other human flaws, but other than that appears to be an involved and caring father.  It leaves you thinking that Mr. Firth's character (the son) is just a selfish whiner who spent his life alienating himself from his father for no reason.  Perhaps the book explored the potholes of their relationship more fully; the film sure doesn't.",1226102400,,820,4.732394366197183
