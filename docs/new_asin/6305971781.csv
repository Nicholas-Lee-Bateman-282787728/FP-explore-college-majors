7898408,5,6305971781,"The comedy is too broad, but the overall representation of the real NYC in 1974 is dead on. This film captures the frustrations of working class city dwellers as the city was falling apart before their eyes.  These were the people that fought WWII and felt totally forgotten by the politicians and officials that ran NYC as muggers mugged and flashers flashed in the decades that followed the '40s and '50s.  When Borgnine smashes his son's bicycle (a great sequence) it captures the blind rage that drove so many people out of the city at that time.  To be honest, as important as 'Serpico' and 'Taxi Driver' are in the NYC '70s movie genre, they romanticize the city compared to 'Law and Disorder'. (And on a technical level, the continuity in this movie is amazing - watch for scenes in the police car where characters or objects are seen through the windshield and are shown in their proper field of vision as the car moves on. That stuff is not easy). The interior of the coffee shop that Carol O'Connor wants to buy is just perfect - the run down city of the 1970s - a city that has long ceased to be. If you want an idea at the frustration that living in the city was back then, without melodrama or where the dramatic elements are more important, this is the movie to see. It is truly a lost gem.",1356739200,4,1304,4.402489626556017

7898411,4,6305971781,"I saw this film in the bargain bin, and couldn't resist. Two of my favorites, Carroll O'Connor and Ernest Borgnine, both in a film from 1974. The clothes, hairstyles and attitudes of the day shine through beautifully, and do not disappoint.
However, all is not quite as it seems.
The film starts out very strongly as a mild comedy, but somewhere along the way it transforms into something else, taking unexpected side-trips into dark, gritty, even ocassionally violent scenes. The effect is interesting and memorable, but not altogether effective in my opinion. The film could have easily been either a comedy, or a serious drama, but  Czech born director Ivan Passer tried to do both, and with mixed results.
In short, the film is not what you will expect it to be based on the first half. While somewhat disturbing when venturing into serious, gritty drama, this should not dissuade the viewer from watching the film. These moments are handled with great skill, and even a kind of flair that forces you to keep watching. And by the time some of the darker elements begin popping up, you care so much about these characters that you wouldn't turn away even if you could.
You can tell that the studio really didn't know what to make of this one. As the included trailer and TV spots attest, the studio promoted the film as a pure comedy, something that the film really isn't. At least, not entirely.
Great moments abound, both comedicly and dramaticly. One serious bit I especially liked was O'Connor, when his character discovers his daughter in a darkened kitchen. Lit only by a candle flame, we see the character's dawning realization that his daughter is high. Putting this in context with the death of the late actor's son, and O'Connor's subsequent efforts to inform youngsters about the danger and tragedy that drugs can cause, the moment is all the more poignant.
The ending is tough (and I felt, somewhat unnecessary), but excellently handled by all involved. The epilogue that follows is perfection, and of a kind never seen in Hollywood anymore.
It really is too bad that the film is somewhat deceptive; starting as a comedy, winding up as more of a drama. Perhaps this is why the film is not as well-known as it could have been, or should be today.
This film is definitely a must-see for fans of Carroll O'Connor, or fans of early-70's movies. The DVD transfer is pretty good, too.
Try this one out.",1035072000,16,2411,4.7404761904761905
7898412,4,6305971781,"After being out of print for many years, Law & Disorder is back and better than ever!  Set in the lower east side of Manhattan, this film  perfectly captures the mid 70's.  Willie (Carroll O'Connor) and Cy (Ernest  Borgnine) are regular working guys who join an auxiliary police force in  order to curtail crime in their neighborhood.  Although a spoof in many  aspects, there are many dramatic vignettes -- including a tear-jerker  ending!  The film was shot on-location -- Grand Street, Canal Street, the  FDR Drive -- it's lower Manhattan at it's finest.  If you want to see what  it was like to be involved in a volunteer police group before PC's and  cellular phones modernized the force, here it is!  I've been waiting for  years to see this movie again and I am thankful to have it in anamorphic  DVD quality.",968284800,19,816,4.640845070422535
