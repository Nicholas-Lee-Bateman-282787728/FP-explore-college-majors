8472907,5,B005HF19NA,You must love comedy to like this movie.  The bantering between the two main characters might at times seemed forced but the chemistry of them is great.  I love both actor and actress and very beautifully done. I have not seen Song Seung Hun in such a comedic role so it was hard to adjust to compared to his other works like East of Eden and Autumn In My Heart.,1340150400,4,362,4.1571428571428575
