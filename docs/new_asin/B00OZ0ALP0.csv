6777320,3,B00OZ0ALP0,"The quality is great,but having seen this previously on Youtube,I know for fact it is not uncut and unedited because it completely skips the intros too,and the actual clips of the show that David and Gillian brought,as well as their awesome responses after them so that does take away from some of the interview for sure. Especially after the clip from The Unnatural which is a true shame to miss out on that,I am disappointed over that for sure,but aside from that it is a wonderful DVD to own.",1417392000,11,495,4.573033707865169
6777321,2,B00OZ0ALP0,"great quality but they cut all the best parts, like the introduction when David & Gillian comes in, the clips and some of their best interactions! good to keep if you want it to watch it in a good quality other than that don't buy it, cause you will be disappointed",1469577600,,265,4.215686274509804
6777322,5,B00OZ0ALP0,"I would of liked to have seen the press interviews from that event.
As always GA & DD were great a lot of laughs and information .",1463443200,,130,3.8518518518518516
6777323,4,B00OZ0ALP0,Very interesting,1461024000,,16,7.5
6777324,5,B00OZ0ALP0,"They were amazing then & they still are !!!
I watched the whole series at least three times...
Each time I rewatch an episode I find new things that I missed in the past. They were and still are a compliment to each other. The show was great as was the host...!",1458259200,,261,4.038461538461538

6777326,3,B00OZ0ALP0,"Definitely not uncut. Unfortunately, the interview has been pulled from YouTube, but I know they left out the introductions and the discussions of the clips from the show. I was disappointed in that, but it's in the collection now...",1451606400,,233,5.0
6777327,5,B00OZ0ALP0,So lovely,1449014400,,9,4.0
6777328,3,B00OZ0ALP0,"Ah! Love these two!... What can I say? Well it was fun to see ""off-screen"" interaction because they are just too funny. I learned a few things about some episodes that were fun to hear.
Love the Paley Conventions!",1446076800,,213,4.487179487179487
6777329,5,B00OZ0ALP0,"This is a fun and revealing interview session with the X Files stars. Both are very charming throughout the session and are honest about their memories, or lack of, about specific episodes and plotlines.  This would definitely be a must see choice for die hard fans of the series. This was filmed prior to announcement of the 2016 X Files  series, so if one is wanting new info about that, this is not a promotion vehicle and does not even mention the possibility. Being a fan of Duchovny, and always entertained by his irreverent remarks, I was not dissapointed with this film, he was his usual smart-ass self. Anderson was warm and genuine, some of the questions and her answers got her blushing violently which I'm sure her devotees found endearing.",1439078400,,752,4.732824427480916
6777330,5,B00OZ0ALP0,"What a hoot ! The most candid interview I've seen !  They still play off each other ! But with years of ""private life "" between them. A must-see for fandom !",1438214400,,157,3.90625
6777331,5,B00OZ0ALP0,Everything arrived in good shape!,1428537600,,33,5.8
6777332,2,B00OZ0ALP0,It's a shame they didn't do this earlier.  It's seemed as if David and Gillian didn't remember a lot of the episodes. Still fun to watch them together again.,1426204800,,157,4.413793103448276
6777333,5,B00OZ0ALP0,Fun DVD. Great to see them together again and answering a lot of questions. They are all open to doing another XFiles movie or other related project. They say Fox is holding up any negotiations. Well worth the money.,1426032000,,216,4.564102564102564

6777338,5,B00OZ0ALP0,"As someone who actually attended this INCREDIBLE event I have to give my two cents regarding the DVD. You have to remember, we're dealing with 20th Century Fox a company not known for giving the rights to their product to anyone else. It's their right to do so, but when it comes to events like this where clips from the show are shown, there's a good chance if it's even on DVD that they won't be included in the final product. Yes, I was lucky enough to actually be there and even spotted myself in the audience, but clips missing doesn't take away what these two people have when they're together. When you've loved a tv show for over 20 years, and seeing the stars of it just...banter...like these two do it's just magic and yes there's something missing without them talking about their favorite clips, but I was very happy to rewatch this and relive the memories.

Note: Unedited as in these two have the mouths of sailors and they didn't edit it for Network TV

Also, those referring to the ""You Tube version"" please know that that version was an illegal rip of the broadcast which was streamed as it actually aired. If you even find a YT version it will likely be removed due to FOX AND The Paley Center imposing Copyright Infringement.",1420588800,5,1244,4.5
6777339,2,B00OZ0ALP0,"It's actually a bit of a disappointment. It's suppose to be unedited/uncut full but they cut out the intros, skipped the episode clips, and had very annoying fade outs during the bits they've skipped. Thought a DVD release would give a bit more extras and not take away from it.

If you're lucky enough to have already seen the live streamed version or just the ripped ones on YouTube there is no need to purchase this unless you're a huge fan and want to add to your collection.",1419811200,5,479,4.443181818181818
6777340,3,B00OZ0ALP0,I added it to the collection but they cut out all the good parts and left in a lot of the unnecessary ramblings. The Youtube version is way better but it's added to the collection so that's all I can say about that.,1419638400,6,215,4.023255813953488
8685649,5,B00OZ0ALP0,This was very entertaining. David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson shine during this interview.,1527984000,,92,6.153846153846154

8685651,1,B00OZ0ALP0,This review is for the DVD itself. The first DVD skipped badly. Tried it on 3 DVD players and it skipped on all of them. I was sent a replacement DVD. It skips in the same spot. :(,1516752000,,180,3.763157894736842
8685652,5,B00OZ0ALP0,You can watch this one over and over and still see or hear something new.  Great couple..,1493424000,,89,4.235294117647059
8685653,1,B00OZ0ALP0,"The DVD only plays for a few seconds, freezes and then stops all together.  The error message indicates unable to read disk, content not found. I have requested two DVD and both freeze at the same moment and does not play. I've tried it in several players and the same issues occurs.  Disappointed fan!",1482969600,,302,4.574074074074074

8685655,3,B00OZ0ALP0,"This skips over the moments of the panel where they watch clips from the show, an essential part of the whole day, if you ask me.  But it still has all Gillian Anderson/David Duchovny interaction you could ask for.",1476144000,,214,4.487179487179487
