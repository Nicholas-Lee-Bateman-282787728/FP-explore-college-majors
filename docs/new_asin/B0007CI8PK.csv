Wish Lyle Alzado, Cleveland Browns football player, wasn't already dead from taking drugs that caused brain problems, would love to have seen another video from him..",1410566400,2,317,5.428571428571429
8220544,5,B0007CI8PK,Lyle Alzado is really good and even funny at times in this video.  It is a really good workout and don't let his stare intimidate you.  Only wish it was in DVD.  Was hard to find even on the internet.,1387411200,,200,3.95
8220545,5,B0007CI8PK,This is an awesome workout.  I got this tape when I was 14 in 1984.  I used it 3 times a week and it helped me to get ripped and very fit.  I continue to do this workout every so often. I will do it for a few months out of the year.  I usually cycle and lift weights but every time I come back to this work out I challenge my body to adapt in different ways.  It is a little dated of course but it delivers.,1379635200,3,407,3.5795454545454546
8220546,5,B0007CI8PK,"This is one of the best exercise tapes,I've ever done. It starts out with stretching, about 20 minutes of hard core aerobics,then and a section with different kinds of push ups and then a weight lifting section. Oh yea,the music in this exercise tape is very up beat and makes you want to workout.",1196208000,4,297,4.518518518518518
