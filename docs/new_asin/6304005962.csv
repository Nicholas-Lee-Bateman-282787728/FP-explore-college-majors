751419,5,6304005962,"This is an excellent film about realistic adult relationships and the compromises we have to make to make relationships work. When the film was released in 1971 however the homosexuality certainly could overshadow the underlying complex but brutally honest story.

I think the best way to review the film is to concentrate on the 3 main characters, all played so very well by a super cast.

Alex, played by Glenda Jackson, is a business woman in her 40's having an affair with a bisexual artist, Bob, who is in his late 20's or early 30's. Bob leaves her at the first hint of conflict or trouble or confrontation to join his Jewish physician lover, Daniel, played by Peter Finch. Daniel asks for relatively little and offers an oasis of thought and tenderness for Bob.

This seems to torture Alex so much that she can't stop from allowing her feelings of rejection and fear of abandonment from driving Bob off the next time they meet. Most telling is her conversation with her mother where she challenges her mother and father's relationship. The father is a cold multi-millionaire that long ago ceased to be involved in a passionate relationship with his wife. Alex's mother confronts her back that she expects to have ""it all' in a relationship and defends her marriage with 'you don't think it is anything but you are wrong."" Alex is extremely bright and verbal but in many ways a spoiled woman. Yet to be fair, how many people can share a lover?  It is possibly one of the most difficult tasks in the world for most and can be so traumatic that the constant worry destroys the relationship.

Bob, the bi-sexual artists, does not have to commit to either Alex or Daniel or to anyone. He is handsome, young, talented, intelligent, and articulate. He is ambitious and sees clearly what he gets from both relationships. He doesn't have to commit so he doesn't.  Both lovers, Alex and Daniel, indulge him and adore him. From his perspective he realizes he does not have to choose between them and he enjoys various aspect of both of the relationships. Why should he make a choice? Does he stop seeing Daniel so that Alex will stop obsessing and fretting? I sympathized with Bob. He was indulged and pampered and knew it.

Daniel, the Jewish physician, was superbly played by Peter Finch. This portrayal of a man living multiple identities was extra special. Daniel is the talented and dedicated physican who takes calls from patients night and day. He is wise and learned and compassionate. He listens to opera in a sophisticated garden home - serene and reflective. Yet he is fully engaged in the Jewish community in which he was reared. The scenes of his nephew's Bra Mitzvah convey his strong heritage and roots to the Jewish community. Daniel, more so that with Alex or Bob, conveys the concept of living different identities. Daniel recognizes he is part of the Jewish community, part of the medical community and the patients they see, and part of a same-gender loving community which exists more behind doors that in the open in 1971. Whereas Alex remains tortured most of the film, Daniel ends the film with a speech directly to the camera about the limitations of all relationships,the compromises we have to make in all relationships, and the responsibility to extract from each human experience as much joy and meaning as is possible.

We have a choice in life, we can accept or reject compromise. Both paths have rewards and hardships. This is really the theme of the film.

After 34 years, this film has retained its power, since its power resides in depiction of honest lives and honest situations.",1126396800,14,3611,4.7648
751420,4,6304005962,"""Sunday, Bloody Sunday"" was one of the most acclaimed adult dramas of the early 70s, and one of the first major films to address gay relationships.  Murray Head stars as a young hippie in simultaneous relationships with physician Peter Finch and businesswoman Glenda Jackson.  Finch and Jackson know about each other, and they even share some mutual acquaintances.  Needless to say, even though Finch and Jackson are completely enamored of the young man, they're also both frustrated with his inability to give more or commit himself.  The film explores these relationships over a tumultuous week.

The film was directed by John Schlesinger as his follow-up to the Oscar-winning ""Midnight Cowboy.""  It's a solid drama of obvious interest for its early, relatively non-judgmental depiction of a gay relationship.  Of note, the relationships are handled with sensitivity but are also interesting and complex.  The Penelope Gilliatt-penned script (her only film) is top-notch and received numerous awards (National Society of Film Critics, Writers Guild of America) as well as an Oscar nomination.

Finch and Jackson turn in very good performances, which were rewarded with Oscar nominations.  Although Murray Head's performance is often criticized for being bland, I think that his cipher-like qualities works well here; you're not supposed to fully understand exactly what Jackson or Finch see in him.  Although it's reflective of its era, the film holds up fairly well.  Overall, ""Sunday, Bloody Sunday"" is an interesting exploration of adult relationships - straight or gay.",1099785600,3,1575,5.436213991769547
751421,5,6304005962,"This civilized movie, of autumnal sadness, is such an actors' film.
Especially when those actors are Peter Finch and Glenda Jackson.
It is a pleasure to watch them at their craft. John Schlesinger has
directed Penelope Gilliatt's script with an eye for rich detail, and
such seemingly minimal emotions of the leads that comes through
the performances so perfectly, as delicately formed and precise as
snowflakes. They feel deeply, do Daniel (Finch) and Alex
(Jackson). Though they must not let on. It would be bad form to.
That they both love Bob (Murray Head) seems a conundrum.  But
Daniel and Alex are of an age when there might be no one else,
save Bob, who is one of those curious,  mercurial people who can
go from person to person, without caring one bit, beginning,
during, after. He literally feels nothing, save the rudimentary ( the
word is full of them) but he is perhaps seen by Daniel and Alex  as
what they want him to be. Such is love. They recreate him from his
vagueness. And of course they must not be jealous of Bob's other
lovers. Such as Bob always require that, and consider otherwise to
be so bloody selfish.
He doesn't  intentionally hurt anyone. He uses people as things, so,
to him, they are replaceable. When he is the replaceable one, if only
they could see it. He is not worth their integrity, and intelligence
and complexity of heart. Yet, when one loves,  one cannot think of
him or her without making them, perhaps, mythic. To someone
else, they would be just another person, for others see them as
ordinary. This, the film explores with such finesse and grace.
Daniel has a monologue, told to us personally, the words of which
are beautiful and touching, that just about rips your heart out. Finch
adds to the words, so seemingly somewhat matter of factly saying
them, ( a person has to comport themselves properly after all)
though from deep inside, with such thought and honesty, and
searching still in these later years, and with no apology. You see the
worth and goodness of the man most especially then. You want to
put your arms around Daniel and Alex and hug them, for their love
is doomed, as they know too well. They are having to deal with the
loss, the void, to reconcile themselves to it, even during Bob, and
learning how to get through the day, routinely, like everyone else
pretends to.
""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" is a  film that one feels honored to see. Its
ad line-- ""This is a story about three decent people. They will break
your heart."" Indeed.",1077321600,12,2495,4.6207674943566595
751422,5,6304005962,"While I concur with many of the reviews posted here, there is not enough praise bestowed on the sublime Glenda Jackson, who remains the great lost actress of her generation.  Though the recipient of two Oscars (""Women In Love"", ""A Touch of Class"") and two other nominations (""Sunday.."" and ""Hedda""), as well as a criminal snub for the landmark ""Stevie"", Ms. Jackson seems to be little remembered today.  It seems inconceivable now, since in the early Seventies, only Jane Fonda and Vanessa Redgrave could be considered her equals.  For me, her Alex in ""Sunday, Bloody Sunday"" is my favorite of her rich performances.  She is conflicted with her obviously unsatisfying affair with her bisexual (and, more importantly, shallow) lover, unfulfilled at her job, and basically adrift, just marking time in her life.  The simple, yet powerfully suggestive emotions Jackson offers do much to help us identify strongly with her character.  Who hasn't felt that, at times, their life is merely counting days, waiting for weekends which ironically do little to feed our spiritual or emotional needs?  And the pattern continues, which to me is what the somewhat cryptic title implies.  So much pressure is put on ""the weekends"" to make us happy that we can easily just wish our lives away, as Alex seems to.  Its hard to find the final straw which Alex finds to salvage her life and begin again without this crippling relationship, but Jackson's brilliantly layered performance is a wonder throughout.  Mr. Finch received many plaudits and is very respectable, but seems to be playing it safe here.  His Dr. Hirsch is supposed to be the emotional, reasonable center of the movie, but Finch is a bit too reserved; the events don't seem to really happen to him at all.  He stands curiously to the side, which may have been the author/director/actor's intent, but we don't have enough of the character's back-life for this to register.  Murray Head is simply a cipher, which is all that is required, but a pleasant one.  And any chance to see the divine Peggy Ashcroft and Bessie Love again is welcome.
When this movie first came out, it had that wonderful aura that many of the pictures of that era did:  the essence of the forbidden--the promise that new and undiscovered worlds and situations would be examined that had never been dealt with in film before.  I remember the same feeling accompanying ""Cries and Whispers"", ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller"", and ""Women in Love"", movies which have stood the test of time.  ""Sunday, Bloody Sunday"", though not without its flaws, has also held up.  Its a perfect time capsule of a certain period of time and change for working-class Londoners still woozy from the Sixties and not anywhere near ready for what would be the Eighties.  Its also a remarkable document of a brilliant actress at the height of her estimable powers.  Highly recommended.",1064188800,69,2871,4.904761904761905
751423,5,6304005962,"For over thirty years SUNDAY BLOODY SUNDAY has remained one of my favorite movies. John Schlesinger may be my favorite director. I believe I own all his movies save one. So I probably cannot be objective about  either this movie or Mr. Schlesinger's greatness.
I understood how my black students felt when they saw SOUNDER for the first time when I saw this movie on its release in 197l. ""At last here is a decent movie about us."" Not only was the movie about bisexual and gay relationships, but the characters were richly and complexly developed. In a word, believable. The plot is rather straight-forward-- the screen play is by Penelope Gilliatt--Alex played by Glenda Jackson is having an affair with Bob who is played by Murray Head who is having an affair also with Dr. Daniel Hirsch played by Peter Finch. Rod Steiger may have preempted Peter Finch and Murray Head with a  kiss on the lips between males in THE SERGEANT, but the kiss between Finch and Head here was certainly well ahead of its time.
The movie is visually very beautiful and well put together. The film opens with a closeup of the hands of Dr. Finch who is examining an older male patient. We see similar scenes throughout the movie of closeups of both Jackson's hands as she makes love to Head and Finch's hands as well. Much is made of answering services and phone messages since Alex and Dr. Hirsch have to share Bob and often have to be satisfied with phone messages rather than him in the flesh. (We can all be thankful this movie was made years before the advent of mobile phones.)
I had never heard before the otherwordly trio from Mozart's COSI FAN TUTTE, this beautiful aria that soars throughout the movie in the way much of Mozart does: just below the surface of joy there is the pain of human suffering, so appropriate for these two individuals who have to share someone they love with someone else.
In 197l Schlesinger was so brave to make this movie, which holds up well after 30 years. His honesty and courage to speak the truth have meant so much to so many. At the end of SUNDAY BLOODY SUNDAY as Peter Finch muses over his less than satisfactory relationship with his friend and discusses whether half a loaf is better than nothing, he says something to the effect that ""I miss him."" Those of us who loved Schlesinger who just died on this day can say in all sincerity, we will miss this great artist.",1059091200,40,2391,4.532407407407407
751424,3,6304005962,"This film follows the fascinating relationship between three Londoners--a 50 plus homosexual man, a 40ish straight woman, and the 20 something young man they are both in love with.  The idea is a fascinating one, and the screenplay examines and analyses the nature and limitations of this kind of love.
It all sounds great, but there are definate problems in the execution.  Firstly, the film is long and somewhat slow-moving, which is a fairly minor complaint.  More importantly, the character with whom we are supposed to identify the most, and certainly the one with the most screen time, is Glenda Jackson's Alex, and she proves to be the most frustrating of the three.  Her possessive need to have Bob to herself is understandable as a concept, but Jackson fails to make it seem reasonable, and the character comes accross as selfish, especially as Peter Finch's Daniel seems to pose very little threat, and to be able to subsist on only occasional visits from the beloved Bob.  It's easy to see why Bob loves the older doctor, it is less apparant what he sees in Alex, who never seems to be much fun.  She should be a little more likable if we are to be caught up in the film.",1023667200,8,1182,4.631578947368421
751425,5,6304005962,"This tale of an unconventional love triangle looks better and better three decades after its release. John Schlesinger's filming of Penelope Gilliatt's screenplay preserves the brilliant performances of Peter Finch and Glenda Jackson, as a man and a woman reluctantly sharing the affections of a another, younger man, Murray Head (whatever happened to him?). What continues to surprise and delight is, most of all, the quiet acknowledgment that different kinds of love can co-exist, each having its own validity, without angst, guilt or retribution. If anything, general cinema has moved backwards since this film in terms of portraying homosexuality and bisexuality in a mature, non-exploitive manner. Ultimately, it's the acting of Finch and Jackson that makes this film, making one regret more than ever their respective death and retirement--in particular, Finch's moving closing speech, made directly to the camera, remains a masterpiece of understated delivery.",1007683200,21,967,5.675862068965517

London has never been seen in such a miserable light. Peter Finch is absolutely wonderful in this, and certainly the most sympathetic character in it, but Glenda Jackson, who was a brilliant actress and Murray Head who was an average actor, are both a bit charmless. You do wonder at times what it is exactly that the two leads see in him. But maybe that's the point. He's the person they can both project all their dreams on. And I'd forgotten how little there actually is to the plot. It's very well written, but the grainy brown look of the DVD image, which was a popular way of filming adult dramas back then, is pretty grim.

751708,5,6304005962,"Sunday Bloody Sunday (John Schlesinger, 1971, 110')

Produced by Joseph Janni and Edward Joseph, Written by Penelope Gilliatt, Starring Murray Head, Glenda Jackson, Peter Finch, Peggy Ashcroft, Music by Ron Geesin, Cinematography by Billy Williams, Editing by Richard Marden, Distributed by United Artists.

John Schlesinger had already directed A Kind of Loving (1962), Billy Liar (1963), Darling (1965)  all British New Cinema topics, plus Far From the Madding Crowd (1967) after Thomas Hardy and the delicate, but excellent New York homosexual milieu film Midnight Cowboy (1969) with Dustin Hoffman and John Voight (the latter later also famous as father of Angelina Jolie (born 1975)).

While Midnight Cowboy had portrayed its gay characters as alienated and self-loathing, Sunday Bloody Sunday is still what non-British would call un film trs Anglais - written by Penelope Gilliatt, directed and starring Murray Head, Glenda Jackson and Peter Finch. It tells the story of a free-spirited young bisexual artist (played by Head) and his simultaneous relationships with a female recruitment consultant (Jackson) and a male Jewish doctor (Finch).

The film is significant for its time in that Finch's homosexual character is depicted as successful and relatively well-adjusted, and not particularly upset by his sexuality. In this sense, Sunday Bloody Sunday was a considerable departure from Schlesinger's previous film Midnight Cowboy. Glenda Jackson, as usual,

751710,5,6304005962,"Wow! As a fan of this film, I had heard the Criterion Collection Blu Ray was beautiful, and couldn't wait to get one for myself.  When I got mine and viewed it, I was NOT disappointed!

Well, the picture is simply OUTSTANDING--just beautiful. Sharpness, pretty colors--color hue and strength, overall ""newness"" to the look . . . this is how this movie should always have been.  You can see every bit of detail on each actor's face, and the fleshtones (and other colors) are exactly accurate.  It's incredible that this is a 1971 film; from the amazing blu ray picture quality, one wouldn't have guessed it (but perhaps for the clothing worn by the actors and Murray Head's hair length).  It has simply amazing picture quality and audio quality.  The audio is crystal-clear.

In regards to the film/story/acting/script itself, I love it, always have, and frankly, I DON'T think it is ""dated."" On the contrary, it is quite fresh, to me. The dialog holds up perfectly today; let me correct that, it's far BETTER dialog than in today's films. The messages are still as relevant, the characters as compelling, the photography beautiful, the Mozart music playing at times just so melodic and pretty.  The three leads in the film do an outstanding job-- Glenda Jackson in an appropriately understated way, Peter Finch and Murray Head in their own ways (the latter two not overstated, but just right).

A great story, it was very contemporary then AND now, and still completely relevant . . . this film has it all, to me, for a story of a love triangle involving a bi-sexual man (the ""good-looking"" one in the group, though all three are quite attractive). ""Dated""-- sorry, I just can't see it.

Truly, if they made better movies than this today, I'd be so glad to watch them. Where are they?

Perfectly mastered on Blu Ray?  YES!!

751711,5,6304005962,"""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" (1971) is one of the best adult films in the truest sense of the term: a film for grownups. Peter Finch, who would win a posthumous make-up Oscar for ""Network (1976) and Glenda Jackson, in between her Academy Awards for ""Women in Love"" (1970) and ""A Touch of Class"" (1973), play the two feet of a romantic triangle whose apex is the bland beauty/conceptual artist played by Murray Head.
Working from a brilliantly textured screenplay by Penelope Gilliatt, herself a film critic, this British film interweaves every scene and character into a commentary on contemporary relationships, especially marriage, or the lack thereof. Glenda Jackson's character is Alex Greville, a divorcee who is the only child of very comfortable but deeply unhappy parents.(Peggy Ashcroft brings a lifetime's worth of experience and skill to the small but telling role of the mother who has accepted her husband's indifference and financial preoccupations.) Alex works as a jobs counselor, in particular for a hard-to-place 50+ year old man with whom she has a one night stand. How she met the decade younger self absorbed artist whose ""affections"" and sexuality she shares with the middle-aged family doctor, Daniel Hirsh, played by Peter Finch, we never learn. Nor do we learn how the good doctor met the young man, although they have friends in common: the decidedly progressive parents of a brood of 5 children, the first 4 of whom have ready access to their parents' stash of pot and are spectators to their parents' bathing. It says everything that the chief family pet is a mastiff named Kenyatta.
Director John Schlesinger came to prominence in the British cinema with such witty and penetrating portraits of the 1960's as ""Billy Liar""(1963) and ""Darling""(1965) and ""went Hollywood"" with his 1969 initially X-rated Oscar winner ""Midnight Cowboy"". Here in the London of the new decade, Schlesinger is working well within his comfort zone. A gay artist who was the son of a doctor and a musician, one who knew from experience the world of aspirational upper middle class Jewish life, Schlesinger employs the music of Mozart very effectively to comment on his central triangular relationship and renders perhaps the perhaps the most realistic Bar Mitzvah ceremony and reception ever presented in an apolitical context. Every movement, gesture, line of dialogue and character helps to establish both Dr. Hirsh's family and cultural life and the fact that, while loving, he is a perennial outsider in his own world. Bob Elkin, the object of Daniel's misplaced affection, plays both his older lovers. While ostensibly loving freedom, he's off to America to pursue his career at the end of the film. Alex is left with his toucan, Daniel with Italian language records for a trip never taken.
""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" swept the BAFTA awards for Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress and Editing, yet in spite of 4 major nominations, was kept at arm's length by the deeply conservative (American) Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. While I can't quarrel with the choice of Jane Fonda as Best Actress for ""Klute"", Peter Finch's deeply felt, extraordinarily intelligent and observant performance was both a landmark in a career that stretches back to ""The Nun's Story"" (1959) and the most sympathetic and genuine representation of a gay character on screen before Heath Ledger's tortured sheepherder (he's not a cowboy for the bulk of the movie, although he rides a horse) in ""Brokeback Mountain"" (2005). Why then didn't Finch win? One guess is that Academy members weren't willing to accept a man on man kiss rendered with (seeming) affection and conviction. Thirty four years later, some of the same Academy members weren't ready to accept a highly suggestive if darkened rendering of gay sex in a tent involving Ledger and co-star Jake Gyllenhaal.
 With the wisdom of hindsight, ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" and ""Brokeback Mountain"" are much more worthy of re-viewing and re-consideration than either  ""The French Connection"" (1971) or ""Crash"".(2005) The Schlesinger film is the one receiving the consummate care that comes with being a Criterion Blu-ray selection. The accompanying booklet satisfies both the casual viewer and the film scholar. The cinematography of Billy Williams and the mostly Mozartean score appeal to our eyes and ears. The authenticity of the performances and the continued relevance of the subject matter make ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" as much a part of 2013 as it was of 1971.
The one dated aspect of the film is technological. The characters rely on dial phones and an answering service, personified by silent screen star Bessie Love (1928 Best Actress nominee for ""Broadway Melody"") in their attempts to communicate with each other. In today's smart phone/texting world, this seems laughable, but in 1971 such was the reality and the heightened frustrations of the three main characters caused by missed calls seem entirely apt.",1370476800,3,4956,5.15527950310559

Perhaps two scenes near the end might have been handled differently, for they transgressed the objective-camera point-of-view of the rest of the movie:  (1) Glenda Jackson's character Alex Greville delivers brief, interior-monologue voice-over about her boyfriend, Bob Elkin; and (2) Peter Finch's character Dr. Daniel Hirsch recalls/imagines his own bar mitzvah and the viewer sees what he imagines.  Yet, oddly enough, the final scene in which Peter Finch's character directly addresses the camera and viewers does not seem wrong, even though it does transgress the overall point-of-view in a way.

A fine movie:  expressive of its place and time but not trapped in the amber of its time.  John Schlesinger's direction and Penelope Gilliatt's screenplay stand up.  (Why do people swoon over Kael's review, but never even mention of Gilliatt's, which though less breezy and flashy, are just as informed?)",1356998400,2,1146,5.252747252747253
751716,5,6304005962,"Difficult to believe that this brilliant little film is 41 years old because it still feels fresh and vibrant the way his other films remain (Midnight Cowboy, Billy Liar, Darling, etc).  It is as mature an examination of love in all its aspects as any film that has been placed on the screen since.  The acting by an impeccable cast and the cinematography are first rate, but it is Schlesinger's sure hand that carved this story into our memories.

Divorced workingwoman Alex (Glenda Jackson) and well-to-do Jewish family doctor Daniel Hirsh (Peter Finch) share not only the same answering service but also the sexual favors of the young handsome artist Bob Elkin (Murray Head) who bed-hops between them as the mood takes him. Both Alex and Dr Hirsh are aware of the other's existence but prefer to live with the situation rather than risk losing Elkin completely. But a wet winter weekend in London can be difficult. Exceptional cameo roles are filled by Peggy Ashcroft as the doctor's mother and by Richard Loncraine as Bob's partner and Jon Finch who manages to epitomize the London street hustler.

There have been several films that have attempted to take on the matter of m&eacute;nage a trois tales but none has approached the subject of the complexities of romantic relationships with the style and aplomb achieved here.  It is a masterwork.  Grady Harp, August 12",1345420800,5,1372,4.892241379310345

This quiet, clear-eyed portrait of two lonely, middle-aged Londoners reaching out for companionship--with the same beautiful but callous young man--is one of the most moving films I've ever seen.

Academy Award winners Jackson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Women-in-Love/dp/B00007KQA1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Women in Love</a>) and Finch (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Network/dp/B0045HCJIA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Network</a>) have never been better than they are here. Both of them simply command the screen, especially in their difficult monologues and in the brutal close-ups of their sad, stricken faces. The film's sense of time and place is vivid--the bleak residential streets of London, where solitude is an ordeal to be endured and unrequited love makes every day seem like ""bloody"" Sunday, the loneliest day of the week.

Schlesinger carefully kept the tone realistic and unsensational, yet the film caused a bit of a sensation, anyway. I saw it in a theater when it was first released, and I can still recall the gasps and nervous fidgeting of my fellow moviegoers, particularly during the more intimate scenes between the two men. Quite a few people got up and walked out, too. It may be difficult for young people of today to understand, but such things simply weren't discussed in public in those days, not in a major film with major stars. This was a groundbreaking event, and it was rewarded for its daring with 4 Oscar nominations and a slew of international awards.

I'm glad the Criterion Collection has decided to give SUNDAY BLOODY SUNDAY the deluxe treatment. The 2003 MGM DVD release was okay, but the new Criterion package has a remastered print; interviews with Schlesinger, Murray Head, and others; and a booklet with essays by Ms. Gilliatt and cultural historian Ian Buruma. It's a suitable tribute to one of the finest films of the 1970s. Highly recommended.",1344988800,10,3201,6.9975

The subject is engaging, the screenplay and acting are outstanding, and the camera work is excellent. The performances by Glenda Jackson and Peter Finch keep one's attention throughout. If you watch this film more than once, and you will want to, you'll notice many wonderful details. The only weakness is probably the character of the young man (Murray Head). It's hard to understand what Jackson and Finch see in him, other than youth and a certain attractiveness. The secondary roles are well played - the telephone message service operator, Dr. Hirsh's patients, and the left-liberal parents who are overly permissive with their brood of precocious, loud, and obstreperous children. The atmosphere of the early 1970s gives this film character but does not make it out of date. The soundtrack in this DVD release has not been restored; you'll need to turn up the volume or lose some of the dialogue. Highly recommended.",1291161600,3,1007,5.0359281437125745

751818,4,6304005962,"What does true love really feel like? Is it a way to share one's true emotions with someone special? Is it the best solution to the emptiness that life in this world provides? And if it definitely fulfills one's existence, would it be worthwhile sharing it with more than one person, mainly if that person were of the same sex?
That's just the challenging subject the movie SUNDAY BLOODY SUNDAY depicts so brilliantly. Two years after showing how bitter loneliness in a big city can feel in the also excellent MIDNIGHT COWBOY, John Schlesinger shows us the uncertainty 'double love' can bring mainly to the people who have someone they love in common. Bob, who is the object of love of both Dr.  Hirsch and Alex Greville, seems to go through such an experience quite naturally and without the slightest sense of guilt. However, both the man and the woman who love him seem to have their emotions over a barrel and fear to lose him, although they seem to accept or 'bear' each other reasonably well.
The final scene of the movie discloses the doctor's emotional fragility at the awareness of being left alone by the man he loves. When he states that he 'was there for the cough' - a brilliant set of words in a context that depicts his fight to be happy, he sums up what living is all about. In a nutshell, besides the wonderful performances of Glenda Jackson, Peter Finch. and Murray Head, SUNDAY BLOODY SUNDAY is a bitter essay on human fight for love and happiness in spite of the world's environment, which grows more and more hostile.",1256688000,,1538,4.592727272727273
751819,5,6304005962,"I have loved this film since it was first released in Canada. I saw it at a theatre on Yonge Street in Toronto at a Saturday matinee where the kiss between the two men started a mini-riot sparked by some teen-aged boys in the audience. They were probably expecting a gangster movie !
I have over the years recommended the film, and loaned my VHS and DVD copies  to people younger than myself who universally seem to have the same reaction, ""It is so Seventies !"" Never mind that it is one of the best acted films of its decade, and that it unflinchingly examines complex relationships with an honesty and integrity that would not be equaled for many years. (Possibly until BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN.)
Essentially it is the tale of a complex triangle, one part straight, one part gay, where both relationships are going down the tubes simultaneously. The young man (Murray Head) at the center of both relationships is unaware of, or indifferent to, the hurt that he is causing his two lovers.
The acting of Glenda Jackson and Peter Finch is superb. Jackson is subtle and fascinating throughout, and Finch reaches a heartbreaking integrity in his final little speech spoken directly to the audience. Murray Head is better as the young artist who ignites the passions of the two others than he was generally given credit for. You need to see both his allure and his indifference, and he handles this tricky dichotomy very well.
Although it is very dark in mood much of the time, there are some sparks of humor, some of them provided by Bessie Love as a nosy operator at an answering service shared by the three protagonists. The children that are being babysat by Jackson and Head on the ""bloody"" weekend alluded to in the title, are a very smart observation of bright over-indulged children of the well educated upper-middle class. Jon Finch puts in a brief and disturbing appearance as a hustler that Finch has known sometime in his past.
I seem to remember reading that the ""bar mitzvah"" reception scene in the film was the most expensive food scene ever in film up to that time because they had to keep re-shooting it. It too provides some humor when Finch is sat  down next to a recently divorced woman by his well intentioned and unaware family.
The gorgeous terzetto from Mozart's opera COSI FAN TUTTE that provides the frequently repeated ""theme"" for the film is an ideal choice. An operatic scene with a gorgeous melody which is about benevolent farewells
provides a moving sonic envelope for some of the most moving moments.
Is the film 'too seventies !' I think not. That the seventies were a time of overly casual sexual relationships is a media commonplace that doesn't really hold up to close scrutiny. There is nothing casual about the relationships ending in this film. At least two of the protagonists will be affected by their breakups for the rest of their lives.",1217203200,4,2872,4.719123505976095

751821,4,6304005962,"that it deals with two attractivre, middle-aged people, a man and a woman, deeply in love with the same young man, who returns both their loves (in fact, seems to be the most sexually agressive of the three), but who will not choose between the other two, and generally refuses to be crowded in any way. It seems that before the movie starts, both Alex (Glenda Jackson) and Daniel (Peter Finch) have agreed to this arrangement, no matter how uncomfortable it makes both of them. This makes for a superficially sophisticated, easy situation which is actually seething with emotion and frustration. Both of these people are rich in understanding, and seem as complete as a love-torn individual could be-- though Daniel easily has the more fulilling life (Alex is about to quit her job, and Daniel is an extremely competent doctor, whose feelings never interfere with his giving all his attention to his patients).

When Bob, the young man, decides to leave for New York anyway (to further his own career, an because he IS feeling too much pressure from both of them), Daniel says ""it was better than nothing,"" while Alex says ""sometimes, nothing is better than something."" Is this a function of their belonging to two different sexes, or is one of them wrong, and the other one right?

Also, it occurs to me that a person's being unable to commit himself to you might have nothing to do with you; it might simply be that it is the wrong time for him to commit himself to anyone. Perhaps that time is yet to come, or past, or perhaps even--it will never come. Is this the case with Bob, the younger man?

That's what I meant by ""thinky.""

As I said, the relationship between the characters seems calm, but is in reality anything but. However, one of the striking features of this beautifully filmed and acted  film is  its faithful lack of message, and ITS acceptance of all its characters as a natural, if perhaps somewhat unusual,  part of life.

We see two middle aged, upper class intellectuals (Alex and Daniel) both deeply in love with the same person.  The object of their love is young, handsome and talented young man who is also unintentionally cruel to them both.  By sharing his love with male and female lover(s) he is torturing them with uncertainty of his commitment to either one of them.  His doe like eyes and agreeable demeanor is so sweet that neither one of his lovers can truly get angry with him since he seems, in his undecisiveness, to float amongst them almost as air.  While both of his lovers know about each other's existence they seem to tolerate it in some naive form of belief that their patience, love and tolerance will tip the young man in one way or the other.  Both are wise and middle aged and they know that their amorous choices at this point of their lives are limited.  They are fortunate with a little bit of happiness in their life that is brought by this carefree individual. But life is not a sum of happy parts -- it is far more complicated that that.  And any time complications seem to surround them:  large family with lots of children, responsibilities both professional and personal, friend's arguments, young Bob (Murray Head)  seems to withdraw himself from either one of them as if there is a world somewhere far, far away (like America for example) where everything is simpler, or bigger, or better, or easier.  And as their young lover leaves them both - his female companion with his pet parrot and her realization that she will remain alone, eternally free and unattached from the quarters of a safe marriage; and his male lover alone with his tapes of italian language practice excercises, and coming to terms of his own homosexuality and aloneness that comes with it, we start to fully appreciate the complications of our lives and compromises we are willing to make as human beings to fulfill our basic need for love and acceptance by people we care for the most, no matter what the (emotional) price we have to pay.  Truly artistic movie with all of its complexity.  Probably one of the best performances I have seen.  Also a trip thru time when all of our communications were carefully managed by impossibly patient female telephone operators who served as confidants, secretaries and quiet observers of long distance social interactions.",1192579200,2,2475,4.738927738927739

It is directedly sensitively and beautifully by John Schlesinger, one of the finest British directors.  This is his follow up film to his incredible Midnight Cowboy, and he doesn't disappoint.  Peter Finch and Glenda Jackson are both in love (or so they think) with Murray Head.  This film depicts this love triangle not in a sleazy, comical way (like it would today), but as a deep, thoughtful, painful, and NORMAL thing, just like all relationships.  The film, as other reviewers have noted, depicted homosexuality as normal and not a big deal, which it is.  The relationships are sensitively handled, and Finch and Jackson give great performances.  Head gives a good performance, but some have questioned why his character inspires such passion in Jackson and Finch.  He's a rather bland character, but who knows the ways of love and/or desire.

 Ironically, it is missed signals that are the glue that binds the characters together. Calls are made, and calls are dropped. Schlesinger's forte, aside from the deftly crafted cinematography and directing of the actors, is the psychological background of the characters. Past and present are beautifully linked together to provide unsurpasssed richness of character.

7858252,5,6304005962,"Set amidst Britain's national economic crisis of the early '70s, when Carnaby St. Was fast loosing its allure, this movie is a stern warning to anyone middle-aged and in the hopeless trap loving someone young and self-centered. There is no way your love will be reciprocated. More and more you will define your life by your young lover's terms. Never will you be the only one, and not for long will you be anyone to this emerging but not-quite-there adult.

While the audience tends to sympathize with the middle-aged characters, played to perfection by Finch and Jackson, they at least are capable of love and so for them is hope. The barely-20 Murray Head character is completely self absorbed and thus incapable of a deep, grown-up relationship. Therefore he has little hope of happiness beyond the pleasures of the flesh, and even they are hard to come by past the mid 20s.

Oh yes, and Murray Head the actor also knows loneliness of a sort. In every on-camera moment he shares with veteran thespians Peter Finch and Glenda Jackson, those old pros ensure the scene belongs to them and them alone.

If like me you were in London during this era, this movie will snap you right back.

7858257,4,6304005962,"***Review Contains Some Plot Details***

A pretty interesting film. This isn't one of those movies that's especially thrilling to watch (although there is some very nice camerawork and editing to enjoy). Rather, it's the kind of film that tends to linger in the mind specifically because of its restraint: the lack of overt drama or punchy climax forces you to think back on the moments and scenes that may have seemed insignificant while you were watching them but, in fact, were the lifeblood of the story.

A lot of reactions to this film paint it as being very ""grown-up"" - with mature adults that, in the end, make mature decisions about their relationships. I definitely agree that it is quite ""grown-up"" in its very frank, non-dramatized depiction of sexuality and its fluidity (especially impressive given how long ago it was made). However, the characters themselves and their actions in the film are a different story. To me, the movie seems to be more about emotionally damaged/compromised individuals and their clinging to an awful relationship simply because they're desperate for some love. Any love.

This is easy to see with Alex's character. She's a divorcee and throughout the film it is quite clear that she is pained by the separation. She often comes off as being troubled and outwardly unsure of herself - she openly cries, gazes at old photos of her and her ex-husband, absently knocks things over in her house etc. It's easy to understand why she so desperately clings to her relationship with Bob - she's lonely and yearns for closeness and romance.

So much so, in fact, that she is willing to share Bob with his other lover, Dr. Daniel Hirsh. The brilliant key of the film is that all three individuals know they are in a love triangle. There's no secret affairs that culminate in an explosive finale where all is revealed - everyone involved knows exactly what is going on and run with it anyway. Bob is no mystery; he's a young, free-spirited and fickle guy who refuses to be tied down and is having fun exploring his sexuality. He doesn't seem to deeply care about either Daniel or Alex, and is ready to up and leave them for a move to NYC without so much as a second thought. Alex, however, is so desperate for love that she clings to this young, immature boy and is even willing to accept the fact that she has to share him with someone else.

Daniel's disposition is much more subtle and potentially more difficult to pin down. However, it seems to me like the emotional turmoil that Alex outwardly expresses is the same turmoil that plagues Daniel as well - he's just better at concealing it. Perhaps being gay myself gives me a bit of an advantage as I can more easily understand and relate to Daniel (and how the director, who is also gay, wanted to portray his character and the complex emotions that go along with having an atypical sexuality or gender identity).

He is outwardly a very well put-together man. He is a successful doctor, well-dressed and well-spoken. However, evidence of his less-than-healthy emotional state appears throughout the film. Simply the fact that a successful and respected doctor would entertain a relationship with an immature young man who is, at best, half-interested in him is proof enough that something is wrong. Like Alex, he too is clinging to this relationship, desperate for closeness and love. The complex emotions that come along with being gay are also portrayed very well and subtly. Daniel seems to be ""out"" and comfortable around his friends and seems at ease with himself when he is around Bob. But there are other moments in the film that suggest another side; he becomes very embarrassed when he is noticed in public by a former hookup, and during a Bar Mitzvah towards the end the film it becomes clear that he has not come out to his extended family, awkwardly skirting their attempts at setting him up with women. The film really nails the conflicting and confusing emotions that can come along with being gay, and how they manifest themselves in different situations. The end result is a man who is emotionally strained just like Alex, and who clings to this farce of a relationship in the same way she does.

I appreciated too that the film doesn't take a side or judge these characters for their actions. Alex ultimately decides that this is not right and she needs to move on with her life and find a true partner. Daniel, on the other hand (and in a surprising, fourth-wall breaking final scene) insists on staying in the relationship because it does bring him some happiness - and he would rather have something than nothing at all. The film doesn't cast either of their decisions in a negative or positive light, smartly leaving it to the viewer to decide for themselves.",1463097600,6,4769,4.745476477683956
