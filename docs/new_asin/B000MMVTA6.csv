8170205,5,B000MMVTA6,"The Magic of Ordinary Days is a wonderful family story that incorporates a little WWII era history as well.  Skeet Ulrich and Mare Winningham lend their superb acting to this love story, and Keri Russell is very believable too.  I have watched this movie multiple times and recommend it highly to anyone who likes G Rated love stories.  It exemplifies the quality we have come to associate with Hallmark.",1274486400,,404,4.826086956521739
