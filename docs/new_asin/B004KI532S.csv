8432946,2,B004KI532S,"This is a crude high school comedy with lots of bathroom humor, really old teenagers & inappropriate teachers, however it does feature a young Yoon Eun Hye.  She is always interesting to watch & here you see her creating a tough cookie character.  SO while this dvd won't be in heavy rotation, I will keep it for Eun Hye's presence.  If you are a Porgy kind of fan, this is right up your alley though.",1366156800,,401,4.32
