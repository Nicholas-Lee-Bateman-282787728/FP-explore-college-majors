2056462,2,B00022LIMA,very happy that i received my box set so fast. but was extremely disappointed that multiple disk holders were broken and one of the DVDs skips due to scratches.,1305936000,,160,4.551724137931035
2056463,4,B00022LIMA,"First, before anybody gets offended, remember when watching this show you have to suspend disbelief. It's so full of it and over the top it's hilarious. At times it can be a little brief, a few episodes are just a couple of skits and some boring filler, but for the most part there was at least one or two really good laughs per episode and at this price, that's pretty darn good.

The short description of the series is a guy's fantasy land where the hosts get to do pranks and tell jokes while chugging drinks. There is also their ""Juggy Dance Squad"" of attractive women who put on a show between commercials and sometimes appear in segments.  It's just a genuinely fun program. Seasons 1-4 were just lighthearted fun; season 5 tanked.

If you ever thought&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Benny-Hill/dp/B000T28PGA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Benny Hill</a>&nbsp;was funny, then I'd highly recommend this set. You even get all the incredibly entertaining credits done while women jump on a trampoline.  You perverts.  Ha ha ha.",1277683200,,1070,5.345238095238095
2056464,4,B00022LIMA,"One thing I respect about the Man Show is probably the very thing that would drive some people crazy.  The show is nothing more than sophomoric humor with an emphasis on showing lots of T&A and it makes no pretensions of being anything else.  While I wouldn't want every show on TV to be like this, it is a refreshing change from the bland garbage that is currently served up by the networks as ""comedy.""

Certain bits, like the Man Show Boy selling beer, are hysterically funny.  Other skits use gross out humor but there is always an irreverant and juvenile tone that will either endear the show to you or make you hate it with a passion depending on your outlook.

Perhaps the shows greatest contribution to Television as an art form comes in the form of ""Girls jumping on trampolines!"" which I confess I could probably watch for hours on end.

Are there faults with the show?  Yes, even as a fan I must admit that the quality of shows is uneven.  Some of the bits really work and are very funny but others fall flat.  But that's a given on a show of this type and overall Adam and Jimmy do a good job of keeping things entertaining.

If you want thoughtful, intelligent entertainment I highly encourage you to look elsewhere.  If you want dumb, sexist, silly humor then you should give the Man Show a try.",1151539200,10,1309,4.4125
2056465,4,B00022LIMA,"First off, thank you Comedy Central for putting out the 2nd season in one set, not in two installments like the first season. Next, like the others said before me, major packaging goofs on which show is on what disc. too many discs for the amount of material they had, and I wish the unblurred the censored parts, but I'm sure there's some legal reason they won't. Other than that.. it was one of the funniest shows on Comedy Central. I say was, because the new hosts are not funny, mean and worthless. I can't wait for the rest of the seasons with Jimmy and Adam.. I'll buy them for sure!",1087948800,19,589,4.315315315315315
2056466,4,B00022LIMA,"I'm not even sure that the folks who made the DVDs and the folks who desinged the ""contents"" part of the packaging have ever communicated with each other.
The details of the goofs are available in previous reviews of this item.
Despite the fact that the best parts didn't get ""unblurred"" (not that I reasonably expected it anyway), this is still a great buy.  The show is still funny and irreverent and gloriously shallow.
Each episode runs about 22 minutes, so why they chose to only fit 4-6 episodes on each disc is beyond me.  They could have easily fit all the episodes AND bonus features on 3 discs instead of 6.  But, they can charge more for a 6 disc set, so....
No matter the price (the extra, needless $$ spent on this would have been lost to the sands of time eventually anyway), The Man Show DVD sets remain my favorite DVD purchases of the year!
Looking forward to Seasons 3 and 4.
Season Five with the new hosts?  Skip it.",1087516800,26,935,4.38728323699422
2056467,5,B00022LIMA,"Thank the Beer Gods for bestowing such an awesome gift upon us! Just buy, stit back, and have a few and have a good time.  Adam and Jimmy have left the show but they will live on in the DVD.  And now, with no commercials i can enjoyone of the best shows of all time without any commercial interruptions.  Thanks Man Show! for making my life a lot better!",1085184000,7,354,4.101449275362318
2056468,5,B00022LIMA,"Thanks to everybody related to the Man Show this is the last Place were men Can come together and just have a good time. Long are the days were men can tell a dirty joke and just do manly stuff. Now a days people get offended to easily and the man show is the place were men can come and just be guys, So If your a real man there is no doubt you will love this second season of The Man Show, and don't forget Season 1 is now available. The Man Show Hosted by two great manly men Adam & Jimmy, true man.",1082419200,,502,3.7904761904761903
