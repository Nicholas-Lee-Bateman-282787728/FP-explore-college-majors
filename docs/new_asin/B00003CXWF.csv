1315181,1,B00003CXWF,"I am not exaggerating when I write that this movie was unquestionably the worst movie that I have ever seen. I found it unbelievable that it could possibly be so bad with the cast that it contained. I felt somewhat vindicated, however, about twenty minutes into it when people started filing out of the theater. The cinema was filled to capacity at the beginning, and by the end of the film less than half remained. I spoke with the theater manager about it afterwards and he said that he's never witnessed so many people leave early and ask for refunds than with the Tailor of Panama. That is the level of garbage that this movie is.
Where to start... 1) The dialogue was what I would expect from a novice screenwriter. Every line was attempting to be satirical - rarely funny but always trying to be. (...) When you can actually understand what is going on you realize that the events themselves are not believable at all. (The British agents living in Panama have never even *heard* of the ""silent opposition""? Right...) 3) This movie is very graphic, lewd, and overall disturbing. If I'm going to watch sick rape/torture scenes then there better be an actual movie worth watching to go along with it. This movie did not ""earn"" the right to show the sick events it portrays, which are obviously thrown in as gratuitous shock value.
Lastly, I can only imagine how the people of Panama must feel about this disgusting portrayal of their country. Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie at all costs.

1315182,1,B00003CXWF,"At the beginning of the movie we can see somebody telling Pierce Brosman that he must go to the hell .... eh, I mean, Panama because of his sins, well, I think that becuase Brosman's expression was very ""sad"".
Well, if Panama is hell, then I'm a devil, because I've lived here my whole life.
We were thinking we were going to see nice parts of Panam, like beaches and islands but they showed the ugliest and poorest part of the Country. That was like filming the mud of a nice rose plant.
We see people begging everywhere, according to the movie, Panama is the land of beggars and trafficants. That's interesting.... ""look at me! I'm a billingual beggar with Internet! I will be gratuated of college soon, woohoo!"" Or maybe I should steal my diploma.
Pierce and Jamie Lee Curtis were swimming at the Gamboa Lake. That's interensting too, where went the gators? That lake has a lot of them. Perhaps they went to beg for money of drugs.",993427200,10,934,4.5
1315183,3,B00003CXWF,"Half way through The Tailor of Panama, Jamie Lee Curtis tells Pierce Brosnan that he is ""The wickedest person she's ever met, "" and that trait is what drives this snappy film. Part satire, part horror (?), Tailor is the story of two men with separate but equal agendas. Brosnan portrays a British spy who has been waylaid to Panama because of his indiscretions as a rascal. He is extremely annoyed by his circumstances and seeks out an easy victim to be on the receiving end of his vengeance. Geoffry Rush is the Tailor with a secret who easily becomes Brosnan's target. Brosnan is convinced that the tailor to the prominent men in Panama must have some good information and goes after Rush with damaging knowledge. Rush, desperate for a reprieve, constructs an exaggerated tale of the Silent Rebellion (sorry, that's not the right word, but I lost it!) that stirs up the British, Americans, and Panamanians in an expensive plot of deceit. This film is entertaining. Brosnan was a kick as the rascal spy. Rush plays his Tailor with great style. John Boorman  was pitiful, and it was fun to see 2 women past 40 in the supporting cast who demonstrate that sexiness isn't just for young women.",992476800,,1190,4.69377990430622

The movie is based on a novel that is already outdated, so some of the story seems more implausible to us now than it would have a few years ago.

1315186,4,B00003CXWF,"1. It is a good movie, but it is not an entertaining movie.
2. Brosnan turns in surprisingly good performance, but audiences  drawn in by him ends up hating his character and left the theater feeling empty, cheated or dissatisfied.( This is not a Brosnan that most audiences like to see)
Bottom line: A mixed bag, when there is a good thing happens to this movie, there is a bad thing that counteract it.

1315187,4,B00003CXWF,"THE TAILOR OF PANAMA is the film adaptation of one of John le Carre's more recent literary spy thrillers - though perhaps thriller is a bit of an overstatement. Because the author also served as the executive producer of the screen rendition, the two versions bear a reasonable likeness to one another, a Hollywood curiosity in itself.

At the film's outset, MI6 bad boy spook Andy Osnard, played by Pierce Brosnan, is being bundled off to the British embassy in post-Noriega Panama. It's no secret that this backwater posting is punishment for Andy's penchant for gambling and diplomats' wives, all of which have left the Service seriously unamused. Nevertheless, once established in the embassy and the bed of a sexy embassy staffer, Andy proceeds to report back on the country's political buzz, based on insider knowledge coaxed from a haberdasher to the ruling elite named Harry Pendel, played by Geoffrey Rush. Furthermore, as luck would have it, Harry's American-born wife, Louisa (Jamie Lee Curtis), is conveniently employed as an advisor to the Director of the recently nationalized Panama Canal Company. Taking advantage of such contacts, Andy's suitably embellished intelligence summaries sent back to his London controller soon take on a life of their own, and arouse the concerned attention of Her Majesty's Government and that of Uncle Sam. After all, we can't allow The Ditch to become inaccessible to the English-speaking superpowers, can we? And what are those inscrutable Japanese up to?

One of the more delicious elements of this movie is watching Pierce personate the devious and unprincipled Osnard. He's positively reptilian in a charming sort of way. (One has to believe that the casting for Andy's role was done tongue-in-cheek, considering Brosnan's previous appearances as the sexually irresistible, but always upright and noble, 007, James Bond.) Rush is splendid as the equally opportunistic and conniving Pendel. There's no protagonist here, and the viewers' sympathies will naturally gravitate to the misused women in the story, both Louisa and Harry's receptionist/secretary, the tragically scarred Marta.

THE TAILOR OF PANAMA was filmed on location, so the ambience and ""look"" are lush and tropical. Consistent with a le Carre creation, the action is low key, and there's no high tech gadgetry to divert attention from the nuances of character and plot development.  (Well, there is one scene with a coin-fed vibrating bed that's worth the price of admission.) This isn't a great film by any stretch, but its dark humor and the viewer's philosophical acceptance of government machinations may cause him/her to reflect on its plausibility and ask, ""Well, why not?""",990403200,14,2696,5.277389277389277
1315188,1,B00003CXWF,"Tailor of Panama as a novel is much better than the half hearted attempt to bring it to the screen. The film isn't so much confusing and vague, as it is just poorly acted. Pierce Brosnan is extremely shallow in this role and just plain seems to act like he wishes the movie were over. The viewer doesn't build empathy with the characters, and ends up watching a poorly produced film that can't decide if it is a drama, a spy film, or a action movie.",990144000,3,449,4.232558139534884
1315189,3,B00003CXWF,"With ""The Tailor of Panama,"" John Le Carre and John Boorman serve up a heaping portion of Graham Greene Lite--moderately tasty, undeniably cynical and worldly-wise, and pretty much forgettable. As Andy Osnard, Pierce Brosnan plays a character who could be James Bond's evil twin (or Thomas Crown's, for that matter). He strong-arms Harry Pendel (Geoffrey Rush), a poor cash-strapped schmuck whose life as a society tailor in Panama City is built on a tissue of lies, into providing him information about the current Panamanian government and the disposition of the Panama Canal. Since there isn't enough information to keep Andy happy, Harry starts inventing outrageous lies which Andy cynically exploits, knowing their falsity. The predictable chaos ensues, with the innocent bystanders including Jamie Lee Curtis as Harry's suspicious wife and Brendan Gleeson as a drunken former freedom fighter. The story and acting are just entertaining enough to keep you watching, and the plot builds up some excitement at the end, if not quite enough. The end also asks you to swallow a few yawning gaps (i.e. how did Andy get from one place to another so handily?). The movie efficiently does its job of proving the corollary of Vince Lombardi's maxim (i.e. if nice guys finish last, nasty guys must logically finish first), but it doesn't quite enlist your emotional involvement in the proof.",989712000,8,1385,5.1875
1315190,3,B00003CXWF,"""The Tailor of Panama"" is a brooding, mysterious, slow paced, and malicious film. It's not really a noir film, but it carries that spirit. It's a dark film with interesting characters, and carefully planned twist and turns. The Panama in this movie is a place we are told that is like ""Casablanca, without heroes."" Pierce Brosnan is cast as Andy Osnard a secret agent who is sent to Panama for his sins. He gambles, he drinks too much, and he's a womanizer. Does this sound like the traits of another secret agent Brosnan played? If you answered yes, then you'll be able to get more ""fun"" out of this movie than thoughs who are not familiar with the James Bond series. The directing by John Boreman really sets the mood that makes this movie so enjoyable. You never really know which way this movie is going to go. Something just doesn't add up you might think to yourself. Why is this character doing this or that? But, right when you think you got it all figured out, that's when you see just how wrong you are. Geoffrey Rush is a tailor (Harry Pendel) who Osnard (Brosnan) meets while in Panama. They have a special relationship which deals with secrets. The movie is about the Panama canal and how the U.S wants to get it back from Panama. That is all the information I will give away concerning the story. Jamie Lee Curtis plays Louisa Pendel, who happens to be invloved with the activities relating to the canal. The screenplay by John Le Carre (Who's novel this is based on), Andrew Davies and the director himself is a very smart, sharp, witty, and intelligent. I really can't understand why so many people have decided to stay away from this movie. The only reason I can think of is people may feel it's too smart for them. This is not meant as an insult, and is not intended to offend anyone. I've heard many people say they like to go see a movie where they don't have to think. I think that's what happened here. But people just don't know what they're missing. This is a great movie, with characters that really impressed me. I enjoyed watvhing these people on screen. If anything go see this movie for the acting.",987811200,2,2127,4.484536082474227

the country, making clothes for the rich and politically powerful. Into his world comes Osnard, played by Pierce Brosnan. A morally
corrupt, self-serving MI6 spy, sent to Panama as a last chance after seducing a European diplomat's wife.

Many were bowled over by the irony of casting Brosnan, so associated with James Bond, as this much realer, creepier Bond alter ego. A
man who is handsome, and self-confident, but whose endless seduction of women seems smarmy not sexy, and who delights in
screwing other people while profiting himself.

For me the casting was actually problematic. Brosnan's terrific, but the irony is so distractingly obvious, that it pulled me out of the
story, and made me think too much about film and our hero images instead of simply accepting the character. Beyond that, Osnard
is drawn a little too broadly for my taste. He's so transparent, I have a hard time he gets anyone to trust him even for a moment.
If his inner self-serving pig were a bit better hidden, it might have given the audience more to unravel, and make other characters'
willingness to do his bidding a bit easier to buy.

The mix of tones also was a bit of a misfire for me. Never quite darkly funny enough to ascend into true satire, but certainly never
edgy enough to be taken seriously, there's a lack of danger here. Unlike 'Dr. Strangelove', we never really think Harry and Osnard's
games will reduce Panama to a pile of rubble, and the intimation of it seems false and a bit silly.

1315797,5,B00003CXWF,"I've watched and enjoyed ""The Taylor of Panama"" several times now. It seems to represent co-producer John Le Carr's homage to Graham Greene, Ian Fleming, and a spoof on the spy genre-film in general (It even includes a humorous pot-shot at ""Casablanca."").

Geoffrey Rush turns in a moving performance as Harry Pendel, the tailor, whose fantasy life makes him all too vulnerable for the enticements and blackmail of the seedy would-be, but never-actually-was, James Bond--Andrew Osnard, a burnt-out MI-Sixer, banished to Panama as punishment for peccadilloes in foreign postings [Pierce Brosnan does an engaging satire on his cinematic Bond aplomb.]. Between the fantasies of Pendel (whose dead but not-so-silent partner is portrayed by Harold Pinter) the situation soon gets out of hand and almost ruins Pendel's marriage (His wife is played by Jamie Lee Curtis.); it destroys his loyal Panamanian friends, and almost starts a war. And while Osnard and most of his colleagues prove to be as corruptible as they are mendacious, the tailor finally comes clean with his wife and mends his marriage.

Behind the satire is one of Le Carr's favorite topics, the willingness of Intelligence services to believe what they want (in this case the presence of a ""silent opposition"" to the local government), and, in the name of expediency, to spin the most tenuous threads into colorful yarns that they then weave into plausible fabrics and preposterous fabrications.

1315800,3,B00003CXWF,"The Tailor of Panama, 2001 film

Panama is important for its wide-open banking system (money laundering) and as a way station for drug shipments. An agent from MI-6 in London is sent there to do what they do. (Don't ask if you don't have a need to know.) There is a Savile Row tailor who business is shaky; he needs money quickly. [Could higher-ups be squeezing Harry Pintel to turn him into a source of information?] Harry's custom includes the ruling class of Panama. Andrew Osnard pays 5,000$US for a tour of Panama. This includes a man whose tongue is loosened by liquor.

The poor people are fed up with their oppression by their corrupt rulers, but can do nothing but complain. [As in other countries?] Osnard gathers information on the ""silent opposition"" in Panama. CIA Director George Bush made Noriega the ruler of Panama. President George Bush ended Noriega's reign with an invasion by US military forces. There is a flashback to show how Noriega's police kept law and order. [They don't tell what is going on now.] The information that Pintel provides is startling, the higher-ups want confirmation in writing. [The conspirators must put something in writing.] The film shows the odd locales used for meetings (a hotel for young women, a dance hall for men). A strange travelogue indeed! When Harry thinks about quitting Andy threatens to expose and ruin his life.

The film shows how this misinformation rises to the top in an American-British conference. [Do you see the satire here?] The plan is to back the opposition to put a new class in power in Panama. The truth seems to be that any excuse will do as a reason to invade Panama and seize the canal. [An echo of Suez?] Would Ronald Reagan approve? There is a car chase like in other spy stories, but this ends in the weeds. Andy Osnard catches a private jet to Switzerland, he is aided by the British Ambassador. Is this the start of a beautiful friendship? There is a happy ending (which contradicts the main part of this story). Does satire do well at the box office?

I never read the novel by John Le Care so I can't say how accurate this adaption is. It seems like a parody of imperialist policies in a small but important country. Could the servants of a government take advantage of their position to enrich themselves? Yes, especially if there is no auditing of expenditures. [Accountants are like an economic police.] It is certainly possible that a government could support an opposition to use it as an excuse to intervene in a country. The book ""The Double-Cross System"" said the weakness in the German spy system was having their spy-masters profit from their agent's work; this made them overlook any questions about their reliability. The British used these double agents to misinform the enemy and learn what the enemy wanted to know.",1186704000,,2819,4.735234215885947

1315884,4,B00003CXWF,"The story opens as British secret agent Andy Osnard (Pierce Brosnan) is sent to Panama in disgrace.  The cynical agent is determined to profit from his exile and enlists tailor Harry Pendel into his scheme.  Pendel runs the highly sucessful Panama branch of the old Saville Row tailoring firm of Braithwaite's.  Unfortunately for Pendel Osnard knows that there is no British firm of that name, and that Harry learned his tailor skills while in prison, serving time for a scheme planned by Pendel's shady uncle.  Pendel has managed to lie his way into respectable society in Panama, he is tailor to many members of the government, including the President, and has managed to marry well and raise a family.  In order to protect all he has Harry lies to Osnard, but this only compounds the problems.

This is an intriguing story, showing not the glamorous or James Bond adventure type of spy story, but more of the gritty Harry Palmer - Ipcress File sort of tale.  Neither Pendel nor Osnard is particularly sympathetic, each has led the way to their destruction by their own misdeeds.  The women in their lives are using the men for their own purposes, the government officals, Panamanian, British and American are all either corrupt or stupid or both.

The dvd includes some extras, including a director's commentary, an alternate ending and a short featurette that are interesting.

Jamie Lee Curtis turns in an excellent performance as Pendel's wife and fans of Daniel Radcliffe are treated to a brief, but well done pre Harry Potter performance.

Geoffrey Rush steals the show as a bumbling, Joe-nobody tailor who wants nothing more than to live a quiet life with his family and be left alone.

The humor in this movie is very subtle.  It is a dry comedy that is the opposite of slapstick.  What we end up laughing at is how it makes fun of the so-called ""adventerous"" life of a spy.  Instead of the glamour of James Bond, we get the ""ho-hum"" reality of just how banal the life of a spy can be.

Working for the government myself, I could especially relate to the bit about the bureaucracy shoveling millions of $$ down the drain for the most frivolous of causes.  I can state for the record that this sort of thing DOES happen.

A word of caution is in order about this film.  The author spent time in the spy business as his profession.  He ends up pulling no punches in mocking the Intel biz.  People who work for the CIA, NSA, FBI and Pentagon are sure to be offended by this DVD.  Just remember - it's all in good fun!",1138060800,4,1109,4.199052132701421

One can only assume therefore that he was happy with the film, but it is two hours I'll never have again.

The basic premise is ridiculous. The motivation of the cynical, semi-disgraced British spy Andy Osnard in stealing millions in American funds destined to support a bogus rebellion in Panama is never established, and the wholesale and gullible buy-in by the American intelligence community and military to the fanciful presentation of events by Osnards's middle-management boss is utterly unbelievable, even with the hindsight of the real-life Iraq WMD intelligence debacle. That director John Boorman shot two endings, the unused of which is included in the DVD extras, and both of which are unsatisfactory, betrays the fact that no one had any idea how to end this train-wreck, and the whole lack of coherence and excitement in the piece seems hard to fathom given the talent involved.

Brosnan, as Osnard, and Geoffrey Rush as Harry Pendel, the gullible and tall story-telling tailor press-ganged into serving Her Majesty's government, work well together, and at least breathe some life into the generally insipid dialog. Unfortunately however, Jamie Lee Curtis, despite her fine acting credentials, is hopelessly miscast as Harry's all-American-girl wife. 1 out of 5 for Brosnan and Rush giving it a pretty good shot, but that's about it - otherwise, a complete waste of time.",1113264000,3,1589,5.084291187739463
1315953,4,B00003CXWF,"Based on the novel by John LeCarre, this action-packed screenplay by Andrew Davies and LeCarre showcases Panama City in the heady times immediately before the Canal was turned over to Panamanian control. Andrew Osnard (Pierce Brosnan), a free-wheeling British intelligence officer in the doghouse with his superiors, is assigned to Panama to be sure that ""the world's biggest trade gate does not fall into the wrong hands."" Meeting tailor Harry Pendel (Geoffrey Rush) in his shop, Osnard observes that Pendel has contact with all the important members of the Panamanian government, the opposition, the press, and the diplomatic corps, and, using blackmail, recruits Pendel as a spy for Britain.

When the tailor does not discover any information and is squeezed for it (because he has debts due), he makes it up stories about a ""silent opposition,"" the machinations of the French and Chinese to acquire the Canal, and the negotiations of a corrupt government for its sale. Soon American and British diplomats are arming and preparing for war to ensure that the Canal stays in ""friendly"" hands.

The plot is nearly identical to that of Graham Greene's famous novel and 1959 film of Our Man in Havana, and the viewer will find few, if any, surprises as the meddling by Osnard and Pendel unfolds. Lacking a strong plot, Director John Boorman has ensured that interest remains high, however, by filming on location in Panama City with its night life, festivals, and parties and by giving Osnard (Brosnan) a libido that controls his life. Attractive women, such as Francesca (Catherine McCormack) at the British Embassy and even Pendel's wife (Jamie Lee Curtis) fall under his spell, and more than a few ""Janet Jackson moments"" keep the viewer tantalized.

A glitzy film which offers plenty of exotic atmosphere, violence, sex, and intrigue, the film lacks only the chase scene which would have converted Brosnan from Osnard to James Bond. Rush, as always, gives a sterling performance as the bumbling tailor, frantic to keep his wife from knowing of his debts and his years in prison. Curtis does a fine job of acting, but it feels like acting, and it is almost impossible to imagine her married to someone like Pendel.

Another thing that bothered me is WHY everytime somebody makes a movie in another country other than USA always shows the ""poor side"" or the b side of that particular place, hey i know my country has its highs and lows but for some reason they always showed the low ones, we are more than just a little village  or in this movie's case a lost city!!. but anyway the movie could have been way better than it did, the only fun thing about it is that you actually see the buildings and landscape that we are used to.",1072224000,2,1322,4.180392156862745

He is loathsome, untrustworthy and completely immoral. I really enjoyed his scenes with Rush as he plays a cut-rate Mephisto and gets Rush to sell his soul. Jamie Lee Curtis is solid as Rush's wife, but it is Brosnan who really steals the show.
LeCarre's inversion of the glamour world of espionage has a ring of authenticity. No one in their right mind would enter into it. Everyone is either corrupt or a fool or both. It is dangerous and vile. Panama exudes the atmosphere of many film noir cities of decadence and decline - as Rush - the Tailor - makes his moral descent.
Also interesting is the scathing satire of British and American spies as they bid to outdo each other and look like fools as Brosnan's crazed plan takes shape.",1046044800,3,968,4.601156069364162

In this movie, we get to see a James Bond-esque character played by Pierce Brosnan screw up a tailor in Panama's life. Rather humorous is the fact that the British agent's character has all the elements of a James Bond: A British, womanizing, MI6 secret agent... except that he has an unhealthy thirst for cash and retiring.
Banished to Panama for landing in the British tabloids, he locates a local tailor (Geoffrey Rushe) who sends him on a wild goose chase, ending with rather tragic circumstances.
What seperates this from a James Bond film, though, is the lack of action, or gadgets. The only gunshot that goes off in this movie takes place off screen, and dialogue is what carries the movie.
Perhaps what best sums up the movie is a quote by the tailor himself: ""It's like Casablanca, except without heroes.""

Geoffrey Rush plays an ex-convict who has moved to Panama to start his life over again as a tailor.  He is down on his luck but refuses to accept this.  He lies to his wife, Jamie Lee Curtis, by not telling her how bad their investment is doing.  His banker lies to him by not telling him that the banker himself knows more about the property than he is letting on.

1316050,3,B00003CXWF,"The Tailor of Panama is an old-fashioned thriller. It is high on character delineation, plot and well written, often witty dialog. It is low on action, which perhaps makes it a poor choice for those viewers who are addicted to the adrenaline rushes found in most current thrillers. For those who believe that adventure doesn't always have to be linked with action, it should make for a perfect evening's entertainment.
Pierce Brosnan plays Andy Osnard, an intelligence agent for the British government. Don't expect to see him reprise his James Bond character. Andy is a sleazy, devious, self-obsessed guy, and the actor obviously delights in this change of pace. Perhaps one day they should make a Bond movie in which Brosnan also play's the hero's evil twin. That would be fun.
Osnard has recently been caught having an embarrassing affair with someone's mistress in Spain. As punishment, the agency banishes him to Panama, where the Brits are keeping a close eye on the Panamanian government's controlling of the canal, that vital, strategic link between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Our spy soon is going over a list of locals who might be able to give him information on the dealings of officials there. He settles on Harry Pendel [Geoffrey Rush], an exclusive tailor who advertises himself as being of London and Panama City. What Osnard knows is that Harry has no London connection. The man is a convicted felon who learned his trade in a British prison. He's the perfect stool pigeon. He dresses all the important men in the city, and Osnard has the information that could destroy his career. Better yet, Harry's wife, Louisa [Jamie Lee Curtis], happens to be the top aide to the man in charge of running the canal. Harry becomes a reluctant spy. As Osnard puts increasing pressure on him, the poor guy attempts to satisfy him by given him false information. Osnard realizes this but quickly sees that he can use these false claims for his own benefit. Everyone becomes trapped in a potentially lethal game.
As in the best thrillers made twenty to thirty years ago, there is a lot of humor in The Tailor of Panama. Spying for a living is fertile ground for a few jokes because it is so contradictory. It is a profession in which deception is the primary tool for finding the truth. Brosnan, Rush and Curtis have a talent for comedy, and it's a pleasure watching them. it helps a great deal that the script provides them with some memorable lines to work with.
Appropriately, director John Boorman was a major director in the 70s and was at the helm of such memorable hits as Deliverance and Excalibur. A decade later, he tired of Hollywood and returned to his native England where he concentrated on small, independent films and on theater. The Tailor of Panama is his return to bigger projects, and it's a welcome return. His style hasn't changed much in the last thirty years, but that's okay. One of the great things about the movies is that they are made by all sorts of people with all sorts visions and points of views. There's something for everyone, and Tailor of Panama may be something for you.",1016064000,3,3116,4.750922509225092
1316051,3,B00003CXWF,"Based on the John LeCarre novel, THE TAILOR OF PANAMA is a quick sprint through the essentials of that rather slow-moving book.

Geoffrey Rush plays The Tailor of Panama AKA Harry Pendel, bespoke haberdasher to the power elite of that small but crucial Central American country. Harry has some deep, dark secrets of his own, but he has built himself into a seemingly successful businessman.

Pierce Brosnan plays British spy Andy Osnard, who recruits Harry as a ""source"" regarding Panamanian politics. Harry's customers all seem to confide state secrets in their tailor, and what they don't confide, Harry invents out of whole cloth, as it were.

Harry's imaginative embellishments of slight truths fuel Osnard's ambitions (both positive and negative), and ultimately lead to a major international incident, based on Harry's tall tales and Osnard's scheming.

Although everyone from the President of the United States on down to Harry's shopgirl suspects the whole ""Panama problem"" doesn't really exist, nobody wants to be the one who backs down and risks 'losing' Panama.

Rush is likeable as Harry, a nebbish of a man who just wants to seem important to somebody, anybody. He's a storyteller whose inventive fibbing turns deep black courtesy of Osnard, a pathological liar.

Jaime Lee Curtis is miscast as Pendel's wife, Louisa. Curtis behaves far too intelligently to be taken in by either Pendel or Osnard, yet Louisa only catches on to the truth at the end. And amazingly forgives Harry, although he is primarily responsible for a major superpower crisis.

Pierce Brosnan is excellent as the amoral and underhanded Osnard. A washed up civil servant with selfish motives, Osnard is an inverted James Bond. His superiors are all embittered at being assigned to Panama, a backwater posting in the American sphere of influence. This motivates them to keep the tall tales growing. The fact that Osnard is successful at his spy games is no reassurance. ""The truth will out""? Not in Panama, apparently.

The atmosphere of the movie is reminiscent of 1940s-era productions like NOW, VOYAGER, spiced with ironic humor and dark wit. As Pendel says to Osnard at one point, tipping his hat to Bogart, ""Welcome to Panama! Casablanca without heroes!"" which is the best one line description of this movie anywhere.

This film is neither great nor particularly memorable, but it's a fun couple of hours on a Sunday afternoon before the Director yells ""Cut!"" Or was that my tailor? Hmmmmmm...",1015113600,,2480,5.103703703703704

1316100,2,B00003CXWF,"Sassy as its cast may be, despite their often-ludicrous characters and the ridiculous situations they encounter, ""The Tailor of Panama"" isn't a very remarkable movie, nor does it leave a lasting impression once the final, ending surprise rolls around. The movie itself is tailored around the notion that a simple lie can lead to catastrophic results, and I could live with this lesson, if not for its baffling turn of events once things start getting out of hand.
British MI-6 agent Andy Osnart (Pierce Brosnan), demoted from his usual dealings in London for bedding a higher-up's mistress, is assigned to Panama to keep tabs on the balance of power over the canal. Seeking out vital information, he befriends the local tailor, Harry Pendel (Geoffrey Rush), who is only to eager to contrive stories and fabrications about a plan to hand over the Panama Canal to one of three possible purchasers, unaware that while he thinks he's leading Andy on, he's really the one being played for a fool.
With a plot as detailed as this, vital clues are important; unfortunately, the movie has little of them. Much of these so-called ""clues"" are merely Harry's wildly imaginative stories, which include subplots that involve one of his best friends and his own secretary. He even uses his own wife, who works for those in control of the canal, taking pictures of her confidential yet useless documents as a ploy to try and buy time from Andy, who keeps up the pretense of impatience while in Harry's company, but sees fit to kick back and relax, confident that his own plans will carry through.
For the most part, the first two acts of the movie are fashioned somewhat impressively, beginning in a tedious manner and then elevating the interest as Harry gets himself in deeper. As the mysteries and subplots begin to unfold and reveal themselves, we get a grasp on the situation, only to have it all thrown out the window with a third act that is neither impressive nor eye-opening.
As if this weren't enough, the characters themselves are completely repulsive. Brosnan plays his 007-ish Andy with great gusto, but his character is such a lewd, unnecessarily disgusting character that it's hard not to wince. Rush is reduced to little more than a whining, bumbling idiot as Harry the motor-mouthed tailor, while actresses Jamie Lee Curtis and Catherine McCormack are wasted as Harry's faithful, suspicious wife, and Andy's bed buddy, respectively.
""The Tailor of Panama"" doesn't go down very easily, given the fact that it wants to be comical and serious simultaneously. This identity crisis between serio-comedy and action thriller prevents it from being little more than a messy, uneven attempt, with a population of characters who spend the entire movie acting like fools rather than spies and tailors.",1011657600,,2792,4.967948717948718
1316101,3,B00003CXWF,"In ""The Tailor of Panama,"" Pierce Brosnan plays a sort of evil version of his James Bond persona, a womanizing British spy more concerned with his own personal aggrandizement than with duty to queen and crown and all those virtues we, parochially, tend to think of as uniquely ""Western"" - virtues like liberty, freedom and democracy.
Based on John Le Carre's novel of the same name, ""The Tailor of Panama"" is not quite so positive in its assessment of the West's innate benevolence.  It is, in fact, an attack on the evils of the modern nation-building process, wherein developed countries like the United States and Great Britain engage in all sorts of covert skullduggery in an effort to protect their own strategic interests in the Third World community. If this involves propping up or installing immoral regimes - or toppling potentially moral ones - that, as Le Carre sees it, is all part of the game we naively call ""international diplomacy.""
The setting of the film is Panama City right after the takeover of the canal by the Panamanians.  Fearful that its interests might soon be threatened, the British government sends one of its own secret agents, Andy Osnard, to ferret out some British citizen who may have contacts with the authorities in the city and may, therefore, be privy to information pertinent to their concerns.  Andy alights on Harry Pendel, a good-natured, idealistic tailor who does, indeed, seem to have some entree with the higher-ups in the local government.  Harry also happens to be married to Louisa (Jamie Lee Curtis), who actually works supervising the canal, so, of course, Harry can be quite an informative source of information if he happens to put his mind to it.  Andy, knowing that Harry has a few major debts to pay off, moves in for the kill and engages Harry's efforts.  The only problem is that Harry, beyond being impeccably moral, also loves to spin a fantastic yarn or two, and Andy has to figure out whether the information Harry is feeding him is really the truth or just the product of an overactive imagination.
The complexity of the plotting works both for and against the film.  On the one hand, the audience has a fun time following the narrative along its complicated mazelike path, meeting interesting people and visiting unusual sites along the way.  Moreover, we are afforded a fascinating glimpse into the sleazy world of backstage nation-building in a so-called ""Banana Republic.""  On the other hand, we often find ourselves a bit confused as to the why and wherefore of many of the actions, and, far worse, the movie never establishes enough of a quality of credibility to make us believe it all.  This is certainly the case in the film's final stretches when the too-easily duped U.S. and British governments launch an all-out attack on the city based on only the flimsiest of evidence.  Yet, perhaps, that is Le Carre (and director John Boorman's) thesis:  that such takeovers are often rooted in causes that are circumstantial, prefabricated or totally beside the point.  If this is the case, both the writer and the director have failed to create the tone necessary to pull off such a sophisticated idea.  For, although there are flashes of sharp humor shot throughout the entire film, the general ambience is never far-out and witty enough for us to classify the work as satirical.  As a result, the final scenes seem somehow more silly than provocative.
This is not, however, to suggest that ""The Tailor of Panama"" is not a worthwhile and interesting film.  In fact, it succeeds almost on the strength of its performances alone.  Brosnan does a superb job poking fun at his signature spy persona, as he utilizes his trademark suavity to get exactly what he wants - be it information, a load of cash, or a roll in the hay with a gorgeous female companion.  As the title character, Geoffrey Rush delivers yet another outstanding performance, somehow managing to make Harry seem both incredibly weak and amazingly strong at the same time.  In fact, Rush, quite literally, carries this film, earning the audience's sympathy from beginning to end.  Curtis turns in her usual fine performance, although her role seems a bit undernourished compared to those of the two male leads.
""The Tailor of Panama,"" although ultimately unsatisfying, comes pretty damn close to being a worthwhile success.",1011139200,,4354,4.905994550408719

A good movie.  Great cinematography, good cohesive script, good story, good editing, Directors Commentary was good, not great.  Additional DVD features interesting and worthwhile spending the extra money for (verses video).
Story:
Brosnan plays secret agent Andy Osnard (something like Bond's lesser brother) who is exiled to Panama for the remainder of his career.  He then meets and uses a tailor, Harry Pendel (Geoffrey Rush - who is excellent).  Osnard squeezes Pendel for information on his clients and gets interesting stories to present to his superiors and compels events forward.
Negative:
Andy Osnard is too low a character to create audience sympathy and carry the movie.  Certainly it shows Brosnan can act and break his mold.  But, Osnard was too base a character to make this a hit.

The movie is a neat little anti-Bond story in that Brosnan arrives in Panama, shortly after Noriega and before the canal was turned over. Brosnan, as a member of the Brit secret service need to make contact with a Brit ex-patriate to help him move around the city and get enough truth into his scam to rip off both the Brit and the US goverment for milions in bribes. The scam is to convince everyone that there is a 'silent opposition' that is left wing leaning and ready to overthrow the government of Panama and turn the canal over to the Chinese.....

The sense of decay, both of the country and in characters' amoral cynicism is well-presented. One reviewer likened it to Graham Greene's work, which is a good point.
All in all, this is a charming and mellow movie with an interesting premise. It's not formulaic --which is a plus-- and the black humor and little jokes appeal to me.

Geoffrey Rush is the innocent tailor whom he befriends and recruits for high-profile contacts, and Curtis is Rush's wife who basically does nothing much more than flash her breasts for two hours. Don't ask me what McCormack's role is all about because I never quite figured it out.

Movie:
Perhaps John Le Carre books do not translate smoothly into movie, because Le Carre's characters are neither good nor evil, they merely are.  Unfortunately, in this manifestation of Tailor of Panama, Brosnan's character, Andy Osnard, is made to be more evil than neutral.
The movie does feature the obscure dialogue you would expect from Le Carre, but not the action one might expect from a purported ""spy thriller"".
Jamie Lee Curtis is underutilized, but good.
Geoffrey Rush's character is a bumbling ex-con who aspires to importance.  Those aspirations lead to his almost downfall.
I have read the many other reviews of this film, most disparaging.  I found it pleasant to the eye, with interesting dialogue, even with a  predictable plot.  The direction by Boorman is predictably understated, with a dialogue driven story, and action merely implied.

The alternate ending is [not good].
The interview with Rush and Brosnan quite honestly adds nothing to the film.
The cast filmography is helpful to identify several familiar if not well known character actors.
The commentary by Boorman is somewhat enlightening.
This film would have benefited from the Infinifilm treatment, as the backstory from the book and the history of Panama could have been more fully developed.  These extras don't go beyond one's minimal expectations.

1316177,2,B00003CXWF,"Well, sometimes a director's pitiful inability to establish an appropriate pace is mistaken for the thoughtfulness, unhurriedness and other ingredients of a quality film made to last. In The Tailor Of Panama John Boorman is his old self, the man who made Arthurian lore look infinitely boring in his amorphous and pseudo-meaningful Excalibur, the man who had told the story of the Dublin's most celebrated criminal, the General, in a line of semi-disjointed episodes, showing the basic rudiments of cinematographer's skill only in starting and ending the film with the same finishing scene.
He obviously prefers to have a well-known material, rich in colorful collisions and characters - they have to carry the weight of a film, make it interesting.
In The Tailor Of Panama the director treads the waters that are very much familiar to anyone who is not a stranger to the British tradition of mocking the antics of the big bosses from the frightfully named agencies responsible for the national security. An underdog gets into the grind, cons the surprisingly foolish and vain hierarchs with his endearingly unbelievable inventions - and more often than not gets away with it. A humble man vs. The State, a soothing fable for us common Joes. Graham Greene's Our Man In Havana is the most immediate example, the tip of the iceberg. As if that's not enough John Boorman takes on the motives from the most popular tale of surviving - with dignity - the troubled times in ultimately corrupted place, The Casablanca.
The catch phrase about the absence of heroes made it to every review, meaningless as it is. The more direct quotation from the same source - "" Maybe that's the beginning of a great friendship"" - is less lucky. It looks like a pure commercial speculation, a hasty indulgence, something extra for a viewer's pleasure.
There is not a drop of fresh blood in the whole film. Everything is so limp and obvious. The character's actions, motivations, emotions just hint on something we have read or seen before, in all the eagerness to please with utterly recognizable ingredients originality was shooed from the set - or maybe they had nothing to lure it with.
Pierce Brosnan looks his usual self, a perfect, cynical, omnipotent male no one can resist, a model more than an actor. Geoffrey Rush portrays confusion, painful loyalty and vague greed with the grimaces you can forecast well in advance. To make their interactions livelier the director puts the actors on the electro-bed in bordello, makes them hug each other tenderly on the gay club's dance floor but these well-meaning gags fail to produce the belly laughs - it's a ""quality film"" after all, not a Jim Carey vehicle.
The other actors also look as if they spend on the set the court-imposed hours for some minor misdemeanor. No stars are born, no career highlights for anyone.
Everything is known from the beginning, it's all boringly predictable, unnecessarily detailed, explained when everything is evident without explanations.
If you are looking for the perfect investment of these couple hours you've allotted for the pure entertainment - skip that film. It's plain boring.
If you possess the patience and understanding to appreciate an original, meaningful and coherent cinematic piece - take them somewhere else.",1001980800,2,3288,5.012797074954296
1316178,4,B00003CXWF,"The Tailor of Panama is a smart, talky, clever character-based spy thriller.  It's not a film loaded with action however. It is based on John le Carre's 1996 novel which was very much inspired and somewhat derivative of Graham Greene's satric spy novel: Our Man in Havana (which became a 1960 film starring Alec Guinness).  The tone of Tailor fluctuates between an almost straight spy thriller and black comedy in sometimes unexpected and less than seamless ways.  This will probably baffle some viewers who won't be able to shift quickly enough or accept that at times.
Andy Osnard (Brosnan) is a British ( MI6 ) spy who has just about ruined his career by getting caught having scandalous affairs and not quite having the panache', charm, skill or charisma of James Bond.  (Yes, the film if very aware and plays with the casting coup it enjoys by having the new 007 play this anti-Bond character in several ways--there's even a reference to Sean Connery if you're particularly observant).
Andy is sent to Panama to lay low.  Andy doesn't know how to lay low and is itching to prove himself and become an important agent--at least at first.  Andy finds a local tailor named Harry Pendel (Rush) who has a secret past that Andy knows about and before long, Harry is telling Andy some spy stories.
Harry has carved out a nice niche' for himself in Panama and has a pretty wife (Jaimie Lee Curtis) and two young children.  He is a very able and skilled tailor and has gotten himself into too much debt by using his mistresses inheritance to buy a farm. Hobnobbing with all of the power brokers and older land-owners gives Harry some degree of prestige, but first and foremost he's a skilled tailor who can be trusted by his customers.
Andy soon realizes Harry's stories aren't completely true...but Andyh can still broker the information and improve his stature..  Then, almost by accident, Harry begins to spin a yarn so good, that Andy knows just how to leverage the information so that he can in essence extort at least 15 million from the Americans. And maybe he'll just take the money and run
There are lot of complications to the extortion plot. And things become riskier and more dangerous.
Geoffrey Rush  is very good here.  He has less bravura in this role but is just as effective in his characterization here as he has been when he is expected to chew the scenery.  Brosnan plays a character that has some similarities to his James Bond but has far less class, skill and ethics than Bond does.  It's fun to watch particularly since as the film progresses we come to realize he is not the flawed good guy we are basically introduced at the beginning of the film.  It works a little better than it would have because he is Pierce Brosnan who is known to audiences as 007. Brosnan isn't nearly the actor Rush is but most of the time he does very well.  Jamie Lee Curtis is excellent and you believe that Rush and Curtis have been comfortably married for several years.  A difficult to recognize Brendan Gleeson plays his role with the kind of gusto and energy we saw Al Pacino bring to Tony  (Scarface) Montano.  It doesn't quite become parody, but it's a performance that jumps too far out at you and is un-balanced.  Another nice touch is having playwright/ occasional actor Harold Pinter turn up in a small role.
The film eventually portrays the spy and diplomat business as pretty much a big farce in which con-men and seasoned opportunist can manipulate some degree of power and wealth by playing at espionage.  The plot itself is really just one elaborate joke.  It's not the kind of joke you laugh out loud at, and it doesn't quite pay-off in the way you might think it will.
In the end, The Tailor of Panama is  too derivative of Graham Greene and a bit too slight of a film to be considered one of the best of its genre. . . but it's actually something very worthwhile.  It's surprisingly well-made and offers several layers to enjoy.  Most will probably find themselves enjoying it more on their second of third viewing.
The DVD quality is very good but not quite top-notch.  When a disc is called special edition you expect to see a presentation that is way above average and a disc that is loaded with extras. This is dissapointing in that regard.  It's a good package and not over-priced however.
Among the extras is An alternate ending. Some will probably like the alternate ending more than varies in tone and spirit a great deal from the way the film currently ends is included.  It's very interesting how drastically different this ending of the film is from the one that was ultimately decided upon.  I like the ending used in the film much better than this one, but neither are complete audience pleasers.
The Disc also included a 25 minute conversation with the lead actors called: The Perfect Fit: A Conversation with Pierce Brosnan and Geoffrey Rush. Writer-Director John Boorman's feature length commentary is very dry, but informative and contains very detailed information about the production of the film and many details about why certain decisions were made regarding the source novel.
Put this one on your list to see if you like smart, clever, films with richly drawn characters.  While it may not deliver exactly the kind of excitement you are expecting, it does deliver wit, and good performances.

The heavy dialogue drowns itself and its actors, who don't seem to try to tread water. Rush and Brosnan are broad charicatures which might work in another film, but not here. The films jokes and attempts at wit are labored and artificial. What the heck does ""Casablanca without the heroes"" mean? The beauty of Casablanca was that there were no perfect heroes in that movie, everyone had their dark side. Watching this film made me flinch far too many times.",1000944000,2,618,4.576576576576577

1316267,3,B00003CXWF,"The Tailor of Panama is not a Boorman film on the same level as Deliverance, Point Blank or the more recent The General, but it is far superior to most studio fare. The film has much to recommend it even if LeCarre's labyrinthian plotting is played here for comic effect. Philippe Rousselot's cinematography brings the exotic seediness of Panama to vivid life. Brosnan and Rush play off each other brilliantly (there is a strange homoerotic frisson to their relationship). The smaller parts filled in by John Fortune and Harold Pinter add to the charm of this meta-spy story. Boorman is one of the old breed of 60s/70s directors, whose ambitions have been stifled by the sheer awfulness of American studio decision making of the last decade. It is nice to see him working even if one senses his wilder impulses are being held in check. The transfer is excellent and Boorman is as articulate as always on the commentary track.",1000339200,,925,4.7875

Not a worthwhile effort from everyone invovled.

1316271,5,B00003CXWF,"Composure is key to Andy Osnard (Pierce Brosnan), an unscrupulous spy who realizes that the best gadgets an agent undercover uses are his cunning, his intellect, his grandeur, and his libido.  All of these qualities must mold into a singular force, and the genuine spy never allows the weight of these qualities or his difficulties to come through physically, for without composure, what is a spy to be?
""The Tailor of Panama,"" a comeback film for ""Deliverance"" mastermind John Boorman, answers this question as it pits the ruthless Osnard, who can always keep his cool, with Harry Pendel (Geoffrey Rush), who cannot balance the many out-of-order elements of his life with the same crispness.
Both of these characters - richly textured, ingeniously conceived, totally idiosyncratic - play a game of wits that headlines a deftly rendered Hollywood thriller that ranks as one of the finest spy thrillers in years.
Attribute the film's considerable success not only to its sterling direction by Boorman, but in the picture's graceful ability to derive its story solely from its characters.  ""Tailor"" is bereft of the boundless cliches and storytelling conventions that ultimately dictate the narrative arcs of nearly all major action pictures.  It instead weaves its web and inflicts intrigue, tragedy, betrayal and sex upon its characters without ever feeling as if the writers are plunging through the Hollywood gamut.
There's hardly a chase scene in this effort, yet there's rarely a dull moment, either.
Credit must be paid to all of the performers, who inhabit their roles rather than occupying. Brosnan does a melicious variation on his James Bond persona, a risky idea that works brilliantly. Rush continues to be a superb character actor, and makes Harry into the film's heart and center, always exuding multiple dimensions and providing rich emotional facets that grace the picture with an uncommon complexity. Curtis is quite good, in a low-key manner, as Harry's intelligent and loving wife, and Brendan Gleason is outstanding as Harry's alcoholic best friend.
Boorman continues to have a nearly unmatched skill at incorporating locations and settings as to make them entirely central to the storyline, exploiting their natural beauty and local color in a manner that defies traditional ""postcard views"" that would be at home, say, in James Bond.  The screenplay is tireless in its abundance of wit and clever turns for the story to take.
If at times improbable and perhaps too pat upon resolution, ""The Tailor of Panama"" is still a richly composed, exceptionally realized contemporary thriller, willing to take chances in an uncommonly simplistic era of major studio pictures.",994809600,4,2685,5.2372093023255815

Both Rush and Brosnan are superb for these roles and the differences of their personalities work to create something more than merely the sum of their efforts. Brosnan is my favorite in this film and he embraced the slightly over the top, morally flexible, full of himself and all too handsome diplomat. For me, this was a fun and fascinating film that I will watch at least several more times.

The one character that I did not feel that the correct actor was chosen was the role that Jamie Lee Curtis fulfilled. For whatever reason, she did not seem like she was feeling the role. She tries hard, but her persona just doesn't seem to fit in what the director was trying to accomplish. It seemed forced or something, just not right. I love her as an actress but just not in this one.

On the other hand, Leonor Varela who plays the role of political war scared Marta was ideal in her role. The tough friend and assistant in Jeffery Rush's shop was believable and created interest. For a time, I thought Brosnan's character would go after her too and I am glad they did not do that. She would have been cheapened and it would have been unnecessary for the film.

An enjoyable, interesting, fun and gritty film about the business and politics of the Panama Canal.",1487289600,,1320,4.491666666666666
