7946426,5,B00005N8A2,"THE SID CAESAR COLLECTION is a series of DVDs and videotapes issued in 2001.

Transfers of the six sketches featured on ""The Professor & Other Clowns"" are remarkably clean. Although dubbed from antique kinescopes, there's no flicker here of picture tube raster, no film breaks or scratch lines. Surely this all was achieved with digital restoration.

Commentary from Sid, Carl, Howie and Nan, plus Woody Allen, Mel Brooks, Neil Simon and Larry Gelbart.

In ""Small Apartment,"" Nan and Sid invite two couples for dinner at their impossibly cramped NYC flat. ""Professor on Magic"" features real legerdemain, plus a giant uncooperative disappearing cabinet. ""Newspaper Movie"" should star Bogey. ""1812 Overture"" has Imogene and Sid as competitive percussionists. Sid's a schlamazel stuck at a corner table by the kitchen door in ""20 Minutes for Lunch."" In the operatic finale ""Gallipoli,"" Sid improvises when the point breaks off of a make-up pencil he's supposed to use for drawing a teardrop on his cheek.

To work on Your Show of Shows or Caesar's Hour was to attend ""the Harvard of Comedy,"" so it is fitting that one of Sid Caesar's signature characters is the Professor. These six vintage sketches are like a graduate class in comedy writing and ensemble performance. Three couples jockey for space during a close quarters dinner party in the hilarious ""Small Apartment."" Caesar and Imogene Coca are a classical gas as two musicians in ""1812 Overture."" Caesar's versatility is on display as a hapless diner in ""20 Minutes for Lunch"" and in the opera spoof ""Gallipacci."" Cast members and writers--including Caesar, Carl Reiner, Nanette Fabray, Larry Gelbart, Neil Simon, Mel Brooks, and Woody Allen--reminiscence about favorite sketches and working on the show. --Donald Liebenson
