8536880,5,B0096Q8XC6,I bought this on Oznoz and not on amazon but I want to support the producers so I am also going to write a review here for amazon. Mixed Nutz is a great and funny TV series and we watch it in Persian so my kids can learn Farsi. The DVD now comes in English but also Arabic and hindi I believe which is great for kids who are learning those languages. We really liked the food episode and the song was great - we also loved Bollywood dreams - with Sanjay and the teacher! Very funny stuff and thank u big bad boo producers!,1346889600,,522,3.980952380952381
