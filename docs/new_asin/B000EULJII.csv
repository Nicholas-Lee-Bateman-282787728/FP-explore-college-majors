8114551,5,B000EULJII,My older 3  kids grew up watching this show.  Since it was no longer on the air I thought I would get it on DVD for my 3 younger children.  All 6 of my kids love this series.  They range in age from 11 to 25 now.  Oldie but goodie,1471996800,,230,3.52
8114552,5,B000EULJII,"I have kids & grandkids 9,10 & 13 who love these video... I did too! I hope they will make more like them for the other bible stories. Love the music. My 10 year old said that she didn't understand these stores before and this video series gave her the understanding she needed. She liked the acting and there was nothing she didn't like about them. When they were running these on TV they couldn't wait until the next one came out.",1280016000,2,432,4.280487804878049
