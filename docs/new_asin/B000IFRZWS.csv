8145356,5,B000IFRZWS,"I bought this to spark up my creativity and bit, and Danny Gill did that.  Danny puts together a lot of material in this DVD and it is definitely worth having if you are in a slump playing the same old runs all the time.  While I don't think that I'm using any of his runs exactly as he plays them, he gave me the inspiration to branch out and come up with some new runs on my own.  A great DVD for any guitarists collection.",1373587200,,425,3.9186046511627906
8145357,5,B000IFRZWS,"If you are blues player with any time on your guitar, you know that finding other peoples tasty licks and making them your own by changing them to your style is the fun part of the journey.  I highly recommend this instruction.  I have a wider variety of my own licks because of it.  Comfortable positions and explanations made this product cool for me.  Thanks!",1303171200,,362,4.523076923076923
8145358,4,B000IFRZWS,"not bad, actually found a bunch of licks thats useable all over and any time.. less structured (in a good way) than other tutorials in this range..",1247184000,2,147,4.481481481481482
