8345439,1,B000LV6OCQ,"Don't waste your money on this DVD.  All the characters get killed off one by one by a sniper. I reviewed the first episode ""When Paradise is Lost"" with more detail.  In the first episode, half the main characters gets killed off.  In this episode, the rest get shot.  There isn't any pleasant ending to this video.  The only victor is the sniper which you hardly see or no nothing about.  This DVD went from my DVD player to the trash can.",1344211200,3,440,4.304878048780488
