8156250,5,B000KF0NGQ,"This movie has a somewhat familiar story line, a kindly woodcutter and Zombie bites a plain Jane nurse causing her to metamorphose into a real knock-out. Our zombie-ized nurse takes on her rival, and pursues the handsome Dr. Dox. She is nearly thwarted when the charmingly suspicious old world custodian discovers the real truth about her. There are some hysterical scenes in the film and I find myself replaying it over and over gain. The black-and-white really added to the overall effect in my view. I am keeping my fingers crossed for a Graveyard Alive 2! This is a really fun movie and definitely worth all 5 stars!!",1181001600,,621,4.7592592592592595
8156251,5,B000KF0NGQ,"I have seen this director's films over the years at various indy film fesitvals. Elza Kephart is one of a kind. Her films have a very unique and refreshing style - pure artistic genius. Anything directed or written by Kephart is a must for dark humor/kitschy horror film fans. On a whim, I typed her name into Amazon to see if anything was available on DVD - so glad to add Graveyard Alive to my collection!",1178841600,,407,4.368421052631579
