2100001,4,B0002KPI3M,"""Decline of the American Empire"" is a difficult movie to define, mainly because it straddles both European and New World cinematographic tendencies (i.e., ponderous and talky on the one hand, ponderous and talky about sex on the other).  Briefly, it's the story of four or five friends who, with one exception, discover that their relationships are in decline -- disintegrating because they come to know more and more about themselves and their lovers.  Is it supposed to be some complex metaphor that somehow ties back in to the movie's title?  That's never really clarified.  But the dialogue is fun (Quebecois French, English subtitles), and the characters aren't sympathetic enough to make you feel sorry for them, so you can, in a detached way, enjoy their suffering in this offbeat comedy drama farce.",1197244800,,807,5.090909090909091
2100002,5,B0002KPI3M,"Although this film came out over two decades ago, it is still fresh and funny and right on target with the observations on the nature of human relations.  The sequel (""The Barbarian Invasions"") is more plangent in that we see the other side of that humor, but equally fabulous, and not without its own quirky humor.  Get both films, some good bread, wine, and cheese, and have a fabulous evening.",1168300800,,396,4.642857142857143
2100003,4,B0002KPI3M,"...which by itself is not a bad foundation for a movie, the thing is these are French-Canadian academics, with a strong emphasis on the ""French"" part.  That is, they are supremely narcissistic, enlessly self-obsessed, preening and cloying drama queens who are entertaining and stimulating in equal measure to being annoying and exasperating.

Like other reviewers, I came upon this film after seeing its sequal, ""The Barbarian Invasions"" which while also very talky in a five-miles-wide-and-one-inch-deep manner, has more of an actual plot to speak of and therefore is a much more effective film that doesn't test your patience quite as much.

The sexual dialogue is often very witty, amusing, refreshingly candid and non-PC, at times even insightful.  French-Canadian academics seem to have far richer sex lives than their American counterparts, that's for sure.  Surprising because I thought the whole PC crapola was equally if not more pervasive up north...it must be the European influence and lack of puritannical Christianity that we still suffer from.

One sidenote: are all French-Canadian men THIS hopelessly dorky-looking?  Why are all the characters so badly dressed, is this film supposed to be set in the 1970s?  Weird, I always thought French people were supposedly good-looking and stylish, or is that French-French only, not the Canadian variety?  I've met and known quite a few Canadians but none were such total Waldos.",1118793600,,1437,5.351111111111111
2100004,4,B0002KPI3M,"Four middle-aged successful couples examine the sexual revolution. The men all meet and talk (they are preparing a dinner), and the women all meet, too (in a gym). The movie is almost all talk as each person reveals his or her own story and feelings. They then all meet and talk some more, and some illusions are destroyed via certain betrayals. It's rare to see such a sophisticated film, though it's very stagey and not very dramatic. (At one point a man, not part of the group, says, ""All they do is talk about sex and then sit down to a fish dinner."") An interesting picture, though, for the most part. In French.",1110585600,,617,4.469026548672566
2100005,4,B0002KPI3M,"Oswld Spengler wrote ""The Decline of the West"" before world War I and the title of this movie suggests a parallel cultural history or documemtary of the present. Far from it . A very frank sexual discussion ,among men, casually mentions that female dominance is a characteric of the decline of a civilization. The female viewpoint is equally well formulated and expounded in an interview. The subtitles lack the elegance of the French- Quebecois,20 years have passed and the subject has lost nothing of his luster. I loved it.",1108857600,,526,4.921348314606742
2100006,4,B0002KPI3M,"I guess like a lot of other viewers, I hadn't watched ""The Decline of the American Empire"" until after I had watched its sequel.  Four men and four women get together in a house by the lakeside in Quebec and what follows will keep you engrossed till the end.  Director Denys Arcand has the characters play out how they would spend a normal holiday, but ""normal"" for them has a slightly different meaning than for us ordinary folks.

There's a much younger Remy, the professor at the University of Laval, womanizer par excellence, alongside his (comparatively) straightlaced wife Louise.  Pierre, the host, is seeing Danielle, a history student at the university, who was his masseur at a parlor where he is a regular.  Their gay friend Claude lives alone because of his compulsive urges to cruise.  Then there's the naive and innocent Alain, both Remy and Pierre's ex-mistress Dominique and finally Diane, who's in a BDSM relationship with a guy who scoffs at Claude's Russian trout dish, wine and pilsner but still turns him on as he resembles one of his ex-lovers.  The movie follows their conversations over the course of the day, the night and the next morning, interspersed with flashbacks.  As Louise says to the BDSM guy, intellectuals love to talk ... and boy, do they talk!  Constantly trading barbs, reeling off historical accounts, offering informed opinions on issues (though not as engaging as those in the sequel) and above all, discussing their sex lives (which are nothing short of spectacular) ... the interchanges won't feel dull for a moment.  Remy, as usual, is utterly lovable in his depravity.

On a personal note, I like ""The Barbarian Invasions"" better as I feel that Arcand has refined his style even more over the years so that he is at his peak by this time, but nevertheless this is an enjoyable (if a bit uneven) watch ... not to mention the deja vu that fills you the entire time as you recognize the characters and relate to them as scenes from the other movie come back to you.",1099180800,,2009,4.744252873563219
2100007,2,B0002KPI3M,"Well, I have to confess I didn't actually make it all the way through this film -- it just wasn't worth it.  I rented it because I'd heard such high praise for its sequel, ""The Barbarian Invasions,"" and thought it might be nice to have some background on the characters that continue on through that new film, which had just come out on video.  Gawd.  What a waste of time.  This is a tedious film, one that replies on the bluntest of ""arch"" dialog and most banal shock tactics, outlining the profoundly uninvolving sexual escapades of eight French-Canadian intellectuals, academic buddies and married couples who sleep with everything that moves and cheerfully cheat on one another, then kiss-and-tell about nearly every detail.  I'm sure that their unlikeability is intentional, but their cheaply outlined raffishness is not compelling enough to balance things out: they simply aren't interesting characters, and their affairs are tawdry and implausible.  It's just boring.  Plus, the token gay character is poorly realized and unfairly stereotyped -- he's as much of a skeeze as the hets, but portrayed with an extra gloss of condemnation, as if non-straight promiscuity were in and of itself more dangerous than the mindless, voracious immorality of the straight characters. (At the time, I guess, AIDS was still seen as a ""gay"" disease...)  Anyway, my wife walked away from this film after about forty minutes, a half-hour later, I joined her.  I doubt I'll follow up with watching the new film as well.",1094256000,,1508,5.024096385542169

8028343,1,B0002KPI3M,"Four men are at a lodge preparing a meal for their female partners who are at a gym working out. They all get together later to discuss, mostly, their sexual relations and problems. Pretentious intellectuals discuss (lots of talk, talk, talk) sex and brag about their affairs. Awkward entanglements. Canadian movie in French with really bad, mismatched English dubbing. Boring, silly dialogue, amateurish acting. I know theres a deeper psychological meaning to this film, but its not worth the agony of having to watch this film to fully understand the point this film is trying to make. If you want an example of an artistically terrible movie, watch this. (Please dont.)",1470614400,,672,5.063063063063063

8028346,5,B0002KPI3M,"This is an old movie. The action takes place in the rarified atmosphere of the French-Canadian academia. Starting with a great shot of a roller scater in Montreal Metro, it continues to follow the protagonists, either University teachers or the their partners, mainly through a voyeristic glimpses into their petty infidelities, mostly fueled by the well-to-do intellectuals' ennui. The men cooking in the kitchen and talking about their hetero and homo affairs, while the women share their insecurities in the gym, lifting weights. It is modern Rome, towards the end of the empire, transplanted onto the North american soil. It becomes inevitably clear that this generation is the blase and hedonistic yet bittersweet hallmark of the decline. Great directing, great acting. The sequel (The Barbarian Invasions), made 17 years later with the same actors, is excellent, but not as good. Buy both!",1393804800,,895,5.309859154929577

8028348,1,B0002KPI3M,"I keep being surprised at the praises this film has been getting.  This film is the epitome of talky.  I kept listening to their conversations and asking, ""Okay, when is something actually going to happen?""  I got an hour into it before I couldn't stand it anymore.  It's limp, stagnant, and boring, one of the worst films I've seen in a long time.  I didn't find their talking of their sexual escapades interesting.  I didn't find the characters interesting.  The film offers nothing but sheer boredom.  The only value this film had at all for me was the fact that it's in French, which is a language I'm learning.  However, that's not enough.  I could only take so much tedious babble before I had to just shut it off.  It's not worth it when there are so many high quality French language films out there.",1355184000,,808,4.503448275862069
8028349,4,B0002KPI3M,"Sort of a French-Canadian 'Big Chill', but smarter, if less emotional.

There really isn't a plot. For the first half of the film four upscale,
yuppie male friends (one gay) prepare a meal and talk about sex, while
their female counterparts do the same at a gym. The 2nd half is the two
groups sharing dinner, where the talk is more muted, but the personal
stakes much higher.

Probably over-hyped as a masterpiece when it first came out, now
it's often treated too harshly.

The acting is strong throughout, and the satiric point that all the
characters believe themselves self-knowing, but are really all living
in denial and delusion is perhaps a little obvious, but interesting in it's
effect and execution.",1300665600,,711,4.859504132231405

8028351,3,B0002KPI3M,"I glanced at some of the reviews before I watched this film.  I found them helpful and they almost made me skip the movie.  However, I make it a habit to watch as many of the Best Foreign Language Oscar nominees as I can and this is one of them.  I was also put off by a French movie with such a title until I realized that this is a French Canadian movie.  Well, THEY certainly have a right to their opinion on the subject.

It didn't take long before I was seeing (and hearing and reading) what the reviewers were talking about.  The movie goes back and forth between the women at the gym and the men at the house.  (That was an interesting touch; the women were working out and the men were home preparing the meal).  With each segment we hear the men and women talking about their sexual escapades; past and present.  The bragging, and laughing, and more lets us know that these are friends who enjoy each other's company.  It gives us a sense of being in a comfort zone of often uncomfortable converation.  In time, after we already know who did what with whom, the groups get together at their planned get together.  The subject remains the same but the tone is a bit different.  Eventually, after too much bold talk fueled, in part, by too much alcohol, someone goes a step too far and the cameraderie is altered.

There comes a point when the movie's title is discussed.  By that time, we have seen enough of what should be the real underlying  meaning of the title.  The joke is on the participants who fancy themselves as intellectuals because they are college professors.  The lack of any real commitment shows the fragility of the relationship involved; the long-term ones, the recent romances, and the possibilities that are just coming to light.  One senses that, after a night of encountering their shallowness, they'll readily return to their definition of normal.",1295049600,,1880,4.558208955223881
