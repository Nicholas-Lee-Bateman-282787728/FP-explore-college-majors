7687805,5,B01COYWK2K,"My husband and I view an episode nearly nightly. We find them INCREDIBLY inspiring and very spiritually uplifting. We recommend them often. I do wish the last episode did not end so abruptly with no clear conclusion. We are hoping this means there will be another DVD set to fully complete the series. We know that the actress playing Parvati was replaced, twice, yet it is Mohit Raina and the actor playing Nandi that are the real glue that holds the series together. Also the actors playing Vishnu and Brahma (and their consorts) are very worthy as well.  This is a life-changing series and we deeply hope that it will be resurrected and continued with new episodes in the future. It is so impactful and has inspired millions to live a more spiritually-focused, directed life.  If anyone knows how to contact those whose decisions determine whether a show can be brought back, please let me know. I am willing to call India, or even go to Bombay when I am able, to work that out. This endeavor deserves that kind of committment and passion!",1476921600,,1042,4.657608695652174

8753648,5,B01COYWK2K,"Planet Bollywood, thank you so much! I had an issue where one of the disks was loose in the case and had scratches all over. Some parts of the DVD skipped and eventually froze. After telling the seller of my issue, they immediately sent out a disk that had no scratches on it. I sent the defective one back. I have to say, this is one seller that knows how to take care of their customer! Thanks again Planet Bollywood!

Pros: excellent customer service, loving Season 2, cannot wait to finish it!
Cons: none whatsoever",1492473600,,519,4.463157894736842
