495924,5,6302717310,"After The Fox is one of Sellers lesser known 60's film comedies -sadly overlooked at the Box Office during it's day, many now adore this film when then watch it for the first time on TV.
Sellers, in my opinion, (and many millions of others), the greatest film comedian of all time, displays his usual brilliance of comedic timing and caricature; the film has an almost dreamy atmosphere and makes one lust for a visit to the land the film is portrayed in!
Balsam is brilliant, Victor Mature is a revelation, ...indeed the supporting cast with the possible exception of Ms Ekland is quite superb.
It's a well known fact the Peter Sellers did not altogether see eye to eye with the film's legendary director De Sica, and there were script changes aplenty, so it's somewhat surprising the end result is so very, very funny.  It could not be duplicated today in any shape or form! Watch it, and laugh & smile!

495925,5,6302717310,"This is one of the best movies that I have ever seen.  I am a fan of 1960's style comedies.  I would rate this as superior to Peter Seller's work in the Pink Panther series.
Every aspect of this movie is good.  This film had a most unusual co-writing team: Neil Simon, one of America's foremost playwrights and Cesare Zavattini, a major Italian comic screenwriter. Also note that Peter Sellers sings the title song, ""After the Fox,"" written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David, along with the 1960's rock group The Hollies. Vittorio De Sica, the film's director, is better known as one of the pioneers of Italian Neorealist filmmaking.
Peter Sellers is at his best as an ingenius thief who is constantly in and out of jail, who undertakes a job to smuggle stolen gold in order to earn enough money to provide for his Mother and Sister.
The supporting cast was superb.  From the aging famous actor, to the Fox's sister, the Fox's two henchmen, the Fox's mother, the town mayor, the chief of police, the famous actor's agent.  Everyone was well selected.
All scenes were EXTREMELY memorable & HILARIOUSLY funny:  the italian restaurant scene where Sellers talks to a beautiful woman with a man's voice, the 1st prison escape scene where Sellers tricks the guards, the 2nd escape scene where Sellers tricks the guards, the interpol scene where they go through the list of suspected criminals (most of whom are at retirement age), the scene where he ad libs fake movie scenes to keep people busy while waiting for the gold shipment to arrive  (And now you are sitting...but not talking to each other...no talking!...and ACTION!)
The film is also noted for it's catchphrases:  ""Good Morning!"" will forever bring a smile to your face.
For me there was also a personal connection:  I felt like I was walking the streets of Italy in the 1960's (roughly a little after the time that my Grandparents had emigrated from Italy to Canada)",985824000,27,1921,4.744744744744745

Starring Peter Sellers and a wonderful supporting cast led by Victor Mature and Martin Balsam, with a score by Burt Bacharach, and a script by Neal Simon, this is a comedy to measure other comedies by.  Every scene is memorable.  You'll be quoting dialogue forever.  I don't know why this film is overlooked by the experts, even in compiling Peter Sellers' best work, but, some people don't get it and never will.  You will never regret seeing this film, and I don't know too many people who have been able to resist seeing it more than once.  You will purchase this film.  You will enjoy it again and again.

I can't say that about every film-some that you cherished as a kid don't hold up on a repeat viewing years later.

Many of you may not realize that the video copies of this film have gone in and out of print many times. Each time I see it go out of print, I get scared that this film might become lost to new audiences.

And yet, it all manages to come together to spectacular effect.  In fact, this is actually my very favorite Peter Sellers movie - beating out even The Pink Panther.  It's certainly a screwball adventure - with Victor Mature probably also giving the best (and certainly funniest) performance of his career.  This blu-ray edition has some very nice special features, as we'll.  I'm going to recount the plot here - because you'll find it in other places.

However, I find the movie entertaining but the humor often isn't readily apparent unless you think about some of the scenes after watching them.  When Peter Sellers films a movie starring his sister and Victor Mature, it is hilarious that no one has lines.  I won't ruin it here but it is humorous what Sellers does when Mature keeps asking for direction.  I guess in retrospect the humor and direction are more complex than some of the mindless comedies of today, but I found that more demanding and worthy of my attention.  Not many comedies make you think but you are rewarded for your efforts in this film.",1469145600,3,717,4.6141732283464565

Peter Sellers as Vanucci and Victor Mature as Tony Powell are great, with lots of funny lines and outrageous events. Britt Ekland is beautiful, though Maria Grazia Buccella as Okra's assistant is as close as one can get to Sophia Loren gorgeousness. There are many great lines, including the last one in the film.

496263,5,6302717310,"If you loved Peter Sellers in any of his American hits(Dr. Strangelove, Inspector Clousseau) then this is the Euro side of him.  After the Fox starred Sellers, Britt Eklund, Victor Mature and Martin Balsam.  In a way, it's a pre-quel to 'A Shot in the Dark' in the music and overall tone.
The plot is complex but still funny: Sellers is a high-profile convict who claims he's ill and has a doctor come visit.  He escapes disguised as that doctor.  He goes to a depressed Italian seaside village, claiming to want to make a film about unloading illegal gold from N.Africa(Egypt).  Oddly enough, he was also hired by the local mob to do just that in reality.  So, while he has the gullible villagers scrambling to get into a movie, he was using them to offload an illegal commodity.  He carries it off until the policia catch up and put him on trial.
The trial is brilliant, the filming of the town is clever, and the interplay of a washed-up Hollywood refugee(Victor Mature), with his nasty agent in tow(Martin Balsam) is an interesting counterpoint.  Throw in Sellers' future wife in real-life(Britt Eklund) as his sister and you have the making of a zany and brilliant film.  Vittoria deSica did the honors behind the camera.  I cannot recommend this highly enough for those who like a thoughtful and well-made comedy.

I saw it so many times and never got tired of it. Oddly I had not had a chance to see it ever since then until I got this dvd.
Sellers vocal in the song is still spine tingling (or chilling). As the master thief/master of disguise he is a thriller. These are the things I remembered I loved so much about it the film. He seems to know much more about human nature than anyone should. That too. All the stuff in the middle of the escapes from prison does not seem to matter so much.

My anecdote. I had seen this a few times before I went to a festival to see a famous film I had never watched namely Antonioni's ""L'Aventura"" which was hailed as ground-breaking in treatment and cinematography. In ""After The Fox"" Peter Sellers uses the cover of making a movie to conceal gold smuggling operations.

While watching the minimalist and serious Antonioni film in a theater I suddenly realized that it had been lampooned by a scene in ""After The Fox"" and I fell out of my seat laughing. I wonder what the others were thinking.

After the Fox pokes fun at actors, directors, the movie industry in general, overly-vain idiots and sweet everyday Italian folks.  The scenery is wonderful, definitely a character in itself. The other actors are so-so, but Sellers and Vic Mature steal the movie.  Mature came out of retirement as a respected actor to lampoon aging actors and poke fun at himself- he is TOP NOTCH.  Sellers is perfect as the FOX, with all his plots, outfits, disguises and fake Italian accent.  Brilliant.
I have watched it 6 times, and there are still things I missed when I re-watch.  It is another of my ""smart"" movies, you either get it or you don't.

496378,4,6302717310,"When I wrote my first review of this film, I was the only reviewer.  I wrote it in the hope that it would be ""rediscovered"" by Peter Sellers fans especially.  Now there are 39 reviews!  I am glad that so many people are enjoying this film.  Many of the other reviews are excellent and I cannot improve on them so I want to say some different things.

If you had seen Victor Mature in other films, none were comedies.  He was in Biblical epics; Samson and Delilah, Demetrius and the Gladiators, The Robe, and The Egyptian.  He was Tumak in One Million B.C.(1940) and Doc Holliday in My Darling Clementine. He's played a romantic lead, a gangster, a cowboy, a caveman, a secret agent, and a cop.  However; when he is cast in a comedy as an ageing matinee idol, the theatrical impact is tremendous.  The fact that he fully embraces the part makes it the slam-dunk winner of the most perfectly casted part of all time!  (His sense of humor off the screen was well known in Southern California:  ""I'm not an actor and I have 64 films to prove it."")  To contradict his self-deprecating remarks, in this film Mature proves that he can act.

Vittorio De Sica must be credited with bringing this Neil Simon comedy to life with his talented direction.  De Sica's experience making comedies went back to when he was a young man and still an actor.  He and his wife, Giuditta Rissone, along with Sergio Tofano, formed an acting company in 1933 which performed mostly light comedies.  In ""After the Fox"", De Sica had a field day poking fun at Federico Fellini and Ingmar Bergman.  There is one more thing of note.  He was notorious for gambling.  This caused him to work on some films that he wouldn't have otherwise.  Sometimes he projected his own fantasies into his films -- The Gold of Cairo(?). In any case, I'm sure he won his bet on this film.

By the way, does the reader know that Gina Romantica (Britt Ekland) was Mrs. Peter Sellers during the time when this film was made.",1311897600,,1970,4.477528089887641
496379,5,6302717310,"After The Fox rates as one of the all-time GREAT comedies. When this movie was first released in theatres, I went to see it with some school friends. We made references to it for years. Now, as an adult, there are people at work who can quote it! For people with a particularly twisted sense of humor, After The Fox is the Holy Grail of comedies.

I can't believe that this movie is 44 years old. If After The Fox was re-released to theatres today,  it would be box office gold! And, after all, it is a film within a film about a master-criminal smuggling gold into Italy!

It is also supposed to be a parody of film-making, but it is a very old hat. When one impovises and does not focus ones film that makes it a new wave film, the writers and Vittorio de Sica seem to be thinking. Shame on you, Vittorio! I give one star to Victor Mature who is great as old, egomanic film star. There is a car chase in the end, but it is among smoke clouds and one cannot see anything. That is funny, of course.

496424,5,6302717310,"After the Fox is by far the greatest of the Peter Sellers comedys, making the Pink Panther films quite dull by comparison. There is not a weak link in the entire film, the parodies, the lines, it is all funny, and a good funny at that. There are a lot of visual jokes, too. For instance, as they flee from the police after the daring jail break, the driver wants to drive the car faster but Aldo says, ""Drive slower, the police will be looking for a fast car."" The police take the bait, pass the slow car and then rush off in search for a fast car. The funny thing is that this is about 1966 and the get away car is an early 1930s red convertable which has been seen by half a dozen prison guards, so the entire obvious description of the car itself is ignored.

Another interesting thing is the way the film was made to look like it had been dubbed, except that you can lip read and see the speaker is obviously speaking the words. The music that accompanies the undercover police is so ""foreign"" that it is laughable itself (really). The undercover police have a certain bogus look, however, in WW2 United States Army medical histories of the occupation of Italy, there can be seen a dozen or more civil servants who dress and look almost exactly the same as the undercover police in the movie. So I think what may seem funny to an American or British audience might seem quite real to an Italian of the period.

As the film progresses, other visual weirdness comes along. The old crook, the fat crook and the dumb crook are all seen in the background doing the most amazing physical feats such as climbing up to balconies using drain pipes only, and then throwing the heavy movie equipment from the ground to the balcony which must be 25 feet or more up. Other stuff like this happens, but no reference is ever made to it being unusual or noteworth.

But the big thing for my family is that the entire situation, while being supposedly a parody of Italian families, is really quite accurate for my wife's family and we have made this our ""family movie"" since the late 80s. When one of us would borrow this line from the movie, ""I cried, I cried like a baby"" we all laugh and want to watch it again. And after seeing this movie scores of times, literally, we are still finding new things to laugh at.

It is quite clear where Blake Edwards got his idea for the fine Pink Panther cartoons, the After the Fox cartoon fox is the model! Even the words to the opening are funny. Who are you, I am me, who is me, I am the fox...",1267056000,,2524,4.296218487394958

Everyone wants their moment of fame, and that means everyone.  So what, you never heard of him.  This man is a genius. Aldo Vanucci, alias The Fox, counts on this to carry out his plan to recover stolen gold.  With the help of The Fox's gang and his sister who wants to be an actress, two confederates arrange for delivery of the stolen gold during the filming.  Of course nothing goes as planned, or so we're led to believe.  Peter Sellers is the thief with a tender heart for his family. Martin Balsam, Akim Tamiroff and Britt Eklund pull off great performances.  Lydia Brazzi is gorgeous.

It features several running gags in Sellers previous movies and the multiple personalities with amazing transformations created by Sellers.

Victor Mature plays the over the hill Hollywood actor with brilliant self parody, Britt Eklund plays Seller's star struck younger sister who ""never misses"" with the thrown crockery during their spats.  Martin Balsam plays the hard boiled Hollywood agent.

He's doing his time until his friends show up and share with him that things are not going too good at home. Furious, he vows to escape and even tells the precise time he plans to leave the heavily guarded prison. The day comes, and sure enough, ""The Fox"" as he is known as by his countrymen, makes a sophisticated (did I spell that right?) escape right under the noses of the prison guards. Free, he makes his way home, only to find his mother running a bingo parlor for her income. So Aldo devises a plan, a plan to steal a large shipment of gold known as THE GOLD OF CAIRO. He, along with his crooked buddies, steal motion picture equipment, and head to a small village where they plan on having the gold shipped in and then load it onto a truck. But, a huge ship coming into a small port will of course raise eyebrows, so Aldo disquises himself as a famous director, and goes throughout the village promising all of the citizens a part in his picture. Soon hordes of villagers show up and even the town's police chief gets in on the act. Aldo even finds a famous Italian actor (played superbly by Victor Mature), and lures him into believing the scam. But will he succeed? I'm not telling, you'll have to see the movie yourself. But I will tell you that if you enjoy a decent comedy, one with action, suspense, and superb cinematography, you'll want to own this fine movie.

496504,5,6302717310,"There is so much to brag about in this movie it is hard to know where to start.

First, Peter Sellers, probably the most talented film comedian of his generation, gives a bravura performance as a professional crook, Aldo Venucci, trying to make one last big score, The Gold of Cairo.  His performance is so nuanced, hysterical (with the Italian accent) and real, that he really IS the movie.  I say that not to disparage the rest of the cast, who are all wonderful.

Second, the totally whacky script by Neil Simon is original, and so full of funny lines that come at you so fast, that you are in serious danger of your sides splitting if you don't pause the video in places!!!

Victor Mature, playing an over the hill actor who doesn't think he is, and Marty Balsam, his suspicious and totally exasperated agent, who tries to convince him that he is not as young as he thinks, are a terrific team and have their own comic chemistry.

Seller's wife at the time, Britt Eckland, plays Sellers' sister, a star struck young woman who dreams of being an actress.  She is very good in her part.

Akim Tamiroff, whose character stole the Gold of Cairo originally, adds a touch of Middle Eastern flavor and mystery to the movie.  (Men ... dig his sister.  What a babe!)

There are some nicely placed barbs at the movies of Antonioni,

(there is one scene where they just chase each other, Eckland and Mature).  When the agent (Balsam) asks the meaning of the whole thing,the director, Sellers, replies ""No matter how fast you run, you can't run away from yourself.""  The Mature character throws a kiss at him and responds, ""Brilliant!""  If you've seen some Antonioni movies, you'll understand the satire.

It is impossible to pick out one best scene, but one of my favorites is when Mature, Balsam, and Sellers meet in his hotel room to discuss to proposed movie, and Sellers receives a phone call. ""Oh hello Sophia.  My darling I told you there is no part in my new picture for you ... Sophia please, you are getting hysterical ...""  At this point, he hands the phone to Marty Balsam and asks him to calm her down.  He gets on the phone, and the next shot is in a phone booth, where one of Sellers' cohorts is on the phone.  When Balsam, comes on he hurriedly hangs up.  Well, you have to see it.  But the whole scene is hilarious.

And what better way to do this than convince an entire town that they are going to be extras in your movie about a shipment of gold? Master thief Sellers hatches the plan while watching an old Tony Powell (Victor Mature) movie while in disguise as a cavalliere--he has to be in disguise, since his daring prison break at the picture's outset. So of the course, the logical step is to get a movie star in the ersatz picture, one like Tony Powell, who is such a has-been that he'll be in anything that allows him to flash his ivories and wear his trademark trenchcoat.

Coming from the heyday of international co-productions (many of them tax dodges, but that's a rant for another forum), what's surprising about FOX is that it's not an outright disaster - that it happens to be a very funny spoof of, among other things, De Sica-styled neorealism constitutes icing on a cake you never expected would be as tasty as it is . For me, the key name here is Neil Simon. Rather than the semi-autobiographical schmaltz he's acclaimed for, this has the flavor of his early TV work for SGT BILKO - in fact, a younger Phil Silvers could have played the Vanucci/Fabrizi part as energetically as Sellers (great here as the flamboyant thief and con man Aldo Vanucci). A brief precis: Italian criminal genius Vanucci breaks jail to rescue the honor of his movie-mad sister; while out, he decides to pull one last big job, requiring his adopting the fictional identity of neorealist filmmaker Federico Fabrizi -shooting his new epic on location in the little town of Saverio- to provide a cover to transport the loot. The beautifully-shot locations throughout AFTER THE FOX add a dimension -satirizing the fanatical Italian love for movies and moviemaking- to the very funny con-man plot that propels the movie forwards. This could easily have been a dubbed mess: instead it's amazingly coherent and clever, and Sellers' scenes with aging matinee idol Victor Mature & his wary agent Martin Balsam are priceless. Both the Vanucci & Fabrizi parts of the narrative work well and are full of terrific camerawork that capture witty visual detail while rendering the flavor of Italy in the 1960s with palpable life.

Answer: Perhaps it could be, with so many irons in the fire, but it isn't.

There is a subtlety to the film I guess which might be missed, but I think that would as likely come with the viewer trying too hard and over-thinking it, as not. On the one hand, I got it when I was a kid. Some have criticized it as inconsistent, but if you ask me, it is consistent beginning to end. On the other hand, while some films which I liked as a kid I've outgrown, this one, isn't among them.

Who is the fox? It is not about real cops and robbers, so you might say the film is two dimensional; but literally, of course, the latter might be said about any movie. The opening lyrics explain: 'I am the fox?'...'Who are you?'...'I am me'...'Who is me?'...'Me is a thief'...'All little crooks wind up in jail'--! Even before the opening lyrics we are given a synopsis: We are shown (according to the narrator) master thieves, stealing some gold by creating a distraction which, in lesser hands, might simply wind up with the coveted armored car getting into an accident; yet by the plan of these thieves, it winds up rolling straight up into the back of a larger truck, for its convenient capture. I won't spoil the ensuing humor by more details, or with saying by who, when or under what circumstances a girl is referred to as unimportant (I'll only say that she is also someone's sister and can so well anticipate the actions of others she can flawlessly lip sync spontaneous conversation). But from this early beginning the stage is already set. On the one hand, what can foil the plans of such expert criminals as these? On the other hand, what chance does a fox stand in a fox hunt? (As the film proceeds, it soon offers a few examples of master criminals expressly said to be of the fox's caliber, and of their encounters with police.) In other words, what happens when a master thief, the fox, collides with the impossible odds stemming from the narrative requirement that crime never pays? It is a bit like asking what happens when an irresistible force meets an immovable object. In this case: a very funny movie.

The bungling Inspector Clouseau of the overarching Pink Panther series, pales by comparison, as an unnecessary extra. The premise of the Pink Panther is perhaps a bit too simple: because crime never pays, even Clouseau always gets his man. The fox, played by Sellers in this film, after going through a series of gags about stereotypical Italian families, eventually has the brainstorm of straightforwardly fighting fire with fire: he decides to create the distraction of hiding his latest crime (retrieving the stolen gold) behind the making (mostly a pretense) of a movie. What else? Isn't it only logical that the 'ultimate criminal' be armed with the 'ultimate weapon?' By the very premise of, 'After the Fox,' the anti-hero's criminal mastermind can play human nature like a cheap violin; assuming only his plausible if necessary defeat, aren't movie makers presumed capable of doing the same thing? It is just taking things to their logical conclusion (or reduction to absurdity), when the lead character enlists cinema and the presumably attendant human foibles, as an ally. Not a little crook but a big crook. So the question now becomes: Can he lose?

Plenty of near misses, but definitively only when the film concludes: 'the wrong man has escaped!' (I guess that's the problem of believing you are Napoleon; other people in the asylum might believe the same thing.) In the meantime, between a rock and a hard place, he can't lose, and he can't win (also depicted by the animation in the opening credits): 'After the fox, after the fox...Somebody's always chasing...after the fox,' with Sellers landing on his feet a bit like a cat, along with the penultimate praise by a film critic, who near the end of the story is shown exuberantly proclaiming him at his trial, a cinematic genius...

The movie runs the risk of being self-referential, like holding up a mirror in front of a mirror, but not demanding too much of itself, it also manages to land on its feet.  The fox, you see, expressly adopted the 'neo realism' of De Sica. The fox's movie actually gets filmed only because the arrival of the gold was delayed (could it be otherwise?), whereupon, among other improvised 'reality shots,' he simply tells Mature and Ekland to run, explaining its 'symbolism' as conveying the truth: 'No matter how far you run, you can't run from yourself.' And true enough, in this scene, we do see Mature and Ekland...despite the cinematic layers...really running (and around beautiful Sant' Angelo, a small village off the coast of Naples, on the island of Ischia, where villagers are depicted as also wanting 'to be in a movie')...an example of an indisputable if trivial touch of neo realism in 'After the Fox' that is no less truly...funny.

De Sica was not pretending to know more than he really knows and the script doesn't ask him to. When the fox tells the driver of a getaway car to drive slowly, because the police will be looking for a fast car, its funny; thinking about it with reference to 'cinema car chases,' makes it more funny.

I actually like De Sica's movie 'The Bicycle Thief;' I also like other neo realism films, such as the 'Apu Trilogy' by Satyajit Ray or the 'Flowers of St. Francis' by Roberto Rossellini.

I just like this one too--and which happens to be the first in the genre I ever saw.",1508284800,,6177,4.753731343283582
