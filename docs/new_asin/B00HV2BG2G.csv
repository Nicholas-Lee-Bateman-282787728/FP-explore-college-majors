8636214,5,B00HV2BG2G,Extremely well put together documentaries! I particularly enjoyed the one on butterflies. Every home with children should own these videos because children will not be taught every aspect of science in the way these documentaries do - parents are required to fill in the gaps. Adults will enjoy them as well - you are never too old to learn!,1470528000,,341,4.796610169491525

8636216,5,B00HV2BG2G,"I love these presentations. They clearly show the wisdom and design built into these creations of God.
Contains deep research into the science behind the design of these creators. For me I was surprised that
I received a three DVD set. I don't know if that was intended or a bonus.",1468713600,,281,4.529411764705882
8636217,5,B00HV2BG2G,"Fabulous presentation of design in creation.  Awesome pictures -- understandable by the young, but rich in detail for every age.",1458086400,,128,5.4
8636218,5,B00HV2BG2G,"There videos area amazing!  I have been a supporter of the ID movement for a while, but I definitely learned some new things.  After watching these videos, there is no doubt in my mind that there is intelligence behind life.  The examples are presented in a way that is entertaining yet persuasive and easy to understand. Some of the highlights:  dolphins have an echolocation system that is similar to the way a radar might work on a battleship.  There are sea turtles with practically a built-in GPS system that uses the Earth's magnetic field.",1458000000,,546,4.76595744680851

8636220,5,B00HV2BG2G,Absolutely wonderful. These dvds can be watched again and again without ever tiring of them. If someone wants to pick holes in them they will but to see the glory and wonder of the creator in them is a delight to behold. I cannot recommended them highly enough....a thousand stars  from me :),1442275200,4,292,4.509433962264151
8636221,5,B00HV2BG2G,Stunning portrayal of the intricate design in God's creation.  I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who cares to think beyond the simplistic explanations offered to us by naturalistic evolution.,1422835200,5,195,5.5
