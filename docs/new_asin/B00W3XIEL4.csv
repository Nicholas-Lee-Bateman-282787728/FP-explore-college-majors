8712051,4,B00W3XIEL4,Very entertaining film.  Great family film that's well presented and informative.  Highly recommended for those curious but maybe a little fearful of reptiles.  You will walk away with a much greater understanding of how these creatures interact with humans in the wild or as pets..,1437004800,,282,5.222222222222222
