8701822,5,B00THX0SOO,"I love the quality and price of these new collections.
I have them all, and love them all. Even with as many
compilations as they HAVE, I don't have any repeated
episodes. I highly recomend them all... from Halloween,
to Christmas, back to Heroes and Heroines, there IS a
collection worthy of your shelf-space!
Here's the other three NEW ones:

* There ARE a few things I didn't like about THIS, particular, collection though.
There are NO problems with the seven [copyrighted] episodes, and the second
[public domain] episode. However, I am VERY surprised that the 1958 ""OZZIE
and HARRIET"" episode b-e-g-a-n with a c-l-o-s-i-n-g credits mentioning Kris
Nelson [married Rick in 1963]. There's NO closing credits, and, the 16mm source
print had two jump-splices. The picture actually ROLLED once. (Remember that?)

* The PETTICOAT JUNCTION episode is, also, in the public domain, and suffers
from video quality, and the opening/closing theme song has been replaced by
some cheesy bluegrass music WITHOUT that familiar singing. Now, THAT sucked!
