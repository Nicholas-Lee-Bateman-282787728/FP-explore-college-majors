8225411,5,B000WSKZDC,"Unfortunately this splendid documentary of the life and art of Marian Anderson is not available in the DVD format, only on VHS tape, and even that is hard to find. Some years ago I requested Public Television (producer of this product) to make it available on DVD, but they have not done so. Included in the documentary are not only interviews with Miss Anderson, but also part of her debut at New York's Town Hall and her famous Easter Sunday concert on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial after the DAR refused to allow her to sing at their Constitution Hall. Among the other of Miss Anderson's associates who are interview are her long-time accompanist Franz Rupp.",1404777600,,665,4.6923076923076925
