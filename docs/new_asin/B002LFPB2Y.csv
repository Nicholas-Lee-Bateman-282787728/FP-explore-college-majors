3945929,1,B002LFPB2Y,A RIP OFF AS A DVD--i COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE DISAPPOINTED.. It should be considered an audio not a dvd,1383782400,,104,4.0
3945930,5,B002LFPB2Y,Have listened to Mathis since 1958-Fantastic voice and showman. ........I think too many words are required to submit a rating.....Why?,1360454400,,135,5.8
3945931,3,B002LFPB2Y,"The music on this video is as usual for Johnny Mathis very good.  My only problem is I did not realize you don't see him, you just see the scene you picked.",1331510400,2,156,3.875
3945932,5,B002LFPB2Y,Johnny is always wonderful to listen to and watching the peaceful visuals that go along with his music makes a great way to just relax and enjoy the season.  Also great to put on as background for a party or intimate get together.,1295481600,3,230,4.348837209302325
8372735,3,B002LFPB2Y,"This is really just a digital sound recording of some excellent Christmas songs by Mathis. It is not a live performance. Video part is just your choice of three holiday scenes. The fireplace and the snowy cabin are nice to look at, but you won't see Mathis perform.",1514246400,,265,4.541666666666667
8372736,5,B002LFPB2Y,"I adore Johnny Mathis...awesome combination of his beloved Christmas hits and a ""warm"" fireplace.  You need this for the Holidays or whenever you need it!!!",1485993600,,156,5.24
8372737,1,B002LFPB2Y,"It was more like a CD and not what we were looking for, we though it was a DVD of his Christmas shows.",1482883200,,102,3.4782608695652173
8372738,5,B002LFPB2Y,looking forward  to viewing it all the way so far so good!,1476662400,,58,3.8333333333333335
8372739,3,B002LFPB2Y,"Not as good as I would hoped, kind of dull.",1459209600,,43,3.4
8372740,3,B002LFPB2Y,"Love Johnny Mathis Christmas songs, you get a digital choice of 3 scenes but again not too realistic for me! If you are having a Christmas party and don't watching tv but listening to Christmas music instead, this is perfect. Just wish there was a mix of artists on one DVD!",1448582400,,274,4.392156862745098
8372741,5,B002LFPB2Y,Johnny Mathis Christmas favorite,1444867200,,32,7.25
8372742,1,B002LFPB2Y,"This was my fault. I didn't lead the description closely enough. I thought I had found a Johhny Mathis Christmas DVD - perhaps a PBS special concert, or some old TV specials from the 60s or something. Instead - yep, the stereotypical video of a fireplace burning, with the Mathis Christmas album soundtracks laid over it. I already have those albums, and I've got a real fireplace, so this was a total waste of money. So, be sure you know what you're getting before you hit the Add to Cart button.",1425600000,2,497,4.472527472527473
8372743,1,B002LFPB2Y,This would have been ok as a CD but Johhny should be ashamed of himself marketing this as a DVD. Who wants to watch fireplace while he sings? I expected to see Johnny Mathis performing.  I agree with another review that is a ripoff!,1422662400,,232,4.2727272727272725
8372744,1,B002LFPB2Y,This should not be up for sale.,1420502400,,31,3.5714285714285716
