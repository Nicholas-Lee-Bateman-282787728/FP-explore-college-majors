366302,4,630180113X,"I will not tell you what the ""something special"" is, but it was a delightful surprise to me.  The plot is good, not the best of all the other Basil Rathbone-Nigel Bruce Sherlock Holmes' movies, but it has the surprises and excellent supporting cast that these movies all have in common.  I enjoyed it very much, and think that the ""something special"" toward the end of the movie is worth the wait.  Hint it has to do with Dr. Watson!!!",1142985600,3,435,4.4125
366303,5,630180113X,Another entertaining Sherlock Holmes movie. Rathbone and Bruce are by far and away the best Holmes and Watson there is. Thoroughly enjoyed the movie and it completed the series for me.,1123459200,3,184,4.967741935483871
366304,4,630180113X,"Were it not for ""Sherlock Holmes in Washington,"" ""Pursuit to Algiers"" would no doubt be considered the very strangest of the Universal Holmes series. The initial mystery at the start of the film is completely obliterated by a plot that is little more than a thriller set on a cruise liner. Ever seen Sherlock Holmes play bodyguard for a foreign dignitary? No? How about his clever defeat of not one, not two, but three expert assassins? Never seen that, either? Well, now's your chance!

In all fairness, it's not that bad - it just doesn't feel like a Sherlock Holmes story. For better or worse, with this film the Universal series is heading into its final decline, and the writers have abandoned all hope of making the films so much as resemble a real Conan Doyle story. As a result, they're resorting to things like cruise liners to liven up what's becoming a somewhat flat formula. It's not a bad idea, but unfortunately, it does away with most of the fog-and-darkness mystique that everyone loves about Sherlock Holmes.

Basil Rathbone himself is, by now, starting to seem very tired. For most of the plot, he stays rooted in a sort of bored, dour mode, only occasionally shifted by a moment such as his (unusually amused) appraisal of Watson's choice in women. Nigel Bruce, on the other hand, is having a ball. Thankfully, he's less embarassingly inept than in the previous film, ""The Woman in Green,"" and more bizarre still, he's actually the focus for much of this picture. Watson is genuinely concerned for Holmes early on, grieves for him when he's believed dead, has a couple of nice comic moments, and - best of all - gets to sing ""Loch Lomond."" (I'm fairly sure that's Nigel Bruce's actual singing voice, too. Great timbre.) All in all, it's probably Bruce's best outing since ""The Scarlet Claw.""

There may not be much mystery here, but the thriller aspect is not done poorly; there are some very fun scenes of Holmes matching wits and banter with the villains. There's also a real surprise at the end - a shocker for one of these Holmes pictures, actually - that helps to raise the film up from the rather lacklustre story.

This picture has, with its eleven fellow films, been painstakingly restored by the UCLA Film and TV Archive for the DVD release. It has a few quality problems, and is singled out for that in the ""Sherlock Holmes Collection: Volume Two"" restoration featurette, but most of the trouble comes at the very beginning and (quite abrupt) ending of the film. For the majority of its length, it looks fine, albeit with the occasional flicker, and I found it far less distracting than the variable picture on ""The House of Fear.""

All told, this is a fun and watchable entry in the Universal Holmes series, but not one of the essentials. If you're going to buy it for completeness' sake, go with MPI's ""Sherlock Holmes Collection: Volume Three"" set; otherwise, casual fans should stick with a rental.",1109203200,7,2931,4.716796875
366305,5,630180113X,"This is a good movie. Just got it in the mail the other day, and my son and I loved it. Basil Rathbone was wonderful in his role as Sherlock Holmes. I'm glad we ordered it.",1091318400,4,172,3.8055555555555554
366306,2,630180113X,"This is one of the poorer examples of the long running series with some less than adequate production values .Holmes and Watson are assigned the task of escorting an imperilled prince ,sympathetic to the British cause ,back to his native land .The journey is being made by ocean liner and the bad guys are on hand to seek to kill not only the young ruler but the great man himself
Cue attempts on their lives by amongst others knife throwing midgets and senior German agents .
Rathbone is marginally under his best as if slighly contemptuous of the material and the shabby production but it does have an admirable economy that makes it just about passable if not representative of the series at its best",1088121600,2,703,4.632
366307,5,630180113X,"This film is really great, for as much as any other reason...the spooky noir-ish atmosphere that permeates every frame.
The story works pretty well although it does not have quite the energy of some of the earlier Bruce/Rathbone collaborations.
The description on the Box of the plot sort of makes it a collector's item.
As with a certain metered degree of the captioning done on these films, the plot description is terribly inaccurate.
Just for the record the King of a Ravenia has been assassinated and his son Nikolas is now a potential target of assassination.
Holmes fools the on-board assassins by having the Future King pose as a Ship Steward.
It is Dr. Watson's Nephew who poses as the Future King.
Nikolas, the Future King never poses as Dr. Watson's Nephew as the box description says.
This glaring inaccuracy is no big deal other than it sort of makes it even more collectable.
I am thinking of compiling a complete list of all the captioning mistakes and omissions and Box Sleeve inaccuracies.
Frustrating only in that it is pure slackness on the part of MPI.
The quality (long believed lost forever) of the films is the over riding redeeming feature overall though.
It is important to remember... that Rathbone and Bruce were a lot like Lennon and McCartney....even when they were not at their absolute best together...they were still 100 times better than anyone else.",1081468800,5,1383,4.864406779661017
366308,3,630180113X,"""Pursuit to Algiers,"" the tenth film in Universal's Sherlock Holmes series, is fairly routine overall, but it does have a novel twist in that it sends the Great Detective and Dr. Watson off to sea.
In some ways, its plot is similar to the next film, ""Terror by Night,"" in that Holmes is once again renting out his services as a bodyguard of sorts, this time protecting the son of the assassinated King of Ravenia as he sails home to claim his throne. The future monarch is disguised as Watson's nephew! Aside from Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, what gives this entry its kick are the other passengers, the most eccentric and suspicious bunch ever booked onto a voyage.
Coming at the tail-end of a series whose finest moments were now behind it, ""Pursuit to Algiers"" is far from the best, but possessing enough suspense and atmosphere to recommend it.

366309,4,630180113X,"This is one of twelve movies of Rathbone as Holmes put out during the war and shortly thereafter by Universal.  All twelve stories are newly written and not contained in the originally published series.  Holmes is played in the traditional was as a talented person who is always willing to help others while interjecting some humor in the process.  This Holmes is very humble and does not suffer from the mental illness of egomania.  This is in stark contrast to the Brett version where Holmes displayed arrogance and airs of secret knowledge which is almost exclusively done in real life by people who are marginal performers.
This particular story plot is somewhat less imaginative and realistic compared to the other eleven, but it is still entertaining to watch.
The digital remastering makes the quality like a recently made movie without any visual or audio flaws.",1075939200,17,870,4.979310344827586

The plot is that Holmes and Watson need to transport a king from England to his own country. The problem is that there are people who want to kill the king. They travel by ship. There are several characters who could be the person or persons who seek to kill the king  they are red herrings.

What is unusual in this old film is that three men try several times to kill the king and Holmes. Holmes knows the identity of the three men and they know that he knows, but Holmes does nothing to them until the end of the film. No one in todays films would allow several men who are trying to kill them and the person they are protecting go around freely.",1416787200,,778,4.105263157894737

366348,4,630180113X,"Universal's Sherlock Holmes series brought the characters into the 20th Century. Many of the were related to World War II, stories in which Holmes went in pursuit of spies and counterspies; others tried to mimic the original Arthur Conan Doyle stories with a presentation of mental puzzles.  Released in 1945, IN PURSUIT TO ALGIERS is the twelfth film in Basil Rathbone's Sherlock Holmes series.  It is unusual in the series for it is less a mystery than a suspense film and because it tends to feature Nigel Bruce as Dr. Watson above Rathbone's Holmes.

The story finds Holmes and Watson preparing for a vacation when they are manouvered into a meeting with representatives of Rovinia.  The King of Rovinia has been killed and assasins are preparing to kill the prince, who has been brought up and educated in England.  Holmes agrees to undertake the task of getting the prince safely to contacts in Algiers--but before he can do so, he must contend with a mysterious airplane crash, a jewel theft, a number of suspicious characters, and a particularly nasty boobytrap.  Fortunately, Watson distracts the assasins--and the viewers!--from seeing an unexpected but extremely effective plot twist near the film's end.

The quality of films in the Rathbone series varies a good deal, with some ho-hum and formula and some well-made and quite clever.  IN PURSUIT TO ALGIERS falls among the latter, with strong performances, a solid script, and a particularly memorable turn by Nigel Bruce.  The DVD offers nothing in the way of bonus material, but the film elements are very good and the movie is lots of fun.  Recommended.

366401,5,630180113X,"It's easy to pick at the flaws in PTA, but the virtues are many, perhaps the most important of which is the dress worn by Marjorie Riordan as the pianist drawn to the man she thinks is Dr. Watson's ""nephew.""  Of course I'm talking about the very final dress we see her in, when she's unmasked by gallant, noble Sherlock Holmes, who helps out a lady in distress by demanding to see the leather case she keeps her sheet music in.

Wow, have you checked it out yet?  It's hard to describe for a layman, but suffice it to say that it's a dress down which, from the shoulder seam to the bottom of her right breast, Marjorie Riordan sports a big, pop looking arrow as if Roy Lichtenstein had drawn her.  It is an astonishing fashion statement for wartime.  Down her other shoulder is a similar tripe but one that does not end in an arrow-head, but rather just keeps going out past the edge of the frame; at one shot I thought I saw it end in an arrowhead identical to the first one, but way lower down, say on her thigh.  All I'm asking is, how many times do you see women's costumes in the 1940s in which arrows point to different parts of the actress's anatomy?  And she's supposed to be a refined pianist and cabaret singer, but she looks like she's ready for Barbarella!

Nothing else in the film is as great as that one gown, but I also liked Martin Kosleck's brave attempt to squelch Holmes by flinging a knife at him through the porthole (I mean, placing his wrist actually in the porthole radius to make his thrust).  Where did he learn that maneuver?  Ouch!  Rosalind Ivan (from SCARLET STREET and ELEPHANT WALK) is her usual faux-Bea Lillie self in the part of an eccentric millionairess, all attitude, fresh air, and oversized monocle seemingly sliced into her eye like a Bunuel-Dali film.  And Nigel Bruce, of course, gets to sing ""Loch Lomond"" in a very appealing barrelhouse baritone.  He is adorable, like a teddy bear in evening clothes.  The mystery elements of PTA are dull and ordinary, but Roy William Neill pulls one enormous surprise out of his hat at the end, and I for one was floored.",1273708800,,2103,4.428571428571429

366407,5,630180113X,"This 1942 Rathbone/Bruce Sherlock Holmes entry is one of my favorites, Number 3 of the entire series, in fact. I cannot explain why but I have observed that Holmseian fans (I know many!) tend to not watch this one as much as they do ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" or ""Terror by Night"", abeit those are two excellent selections as well.

Here, we have Watson running decoy as Holmes conducts an international intrigue to get a Prince back to his Mediterranean country to be crowned, all in the face of repeated attempted assasinations by swarthy characters, (all superbly cast!) aboard a ship. In this entry, it's Watson who ultimately comes to Holmes rescue.

Also, this particular DVD is beautifully restored and digitized from a 35mm print by UCLA -- clear as a crystal. You'll see very few old films which have been this nicely restored. The aspect ratio is 4:3 Full Screen if you're interested in such details. This is true of all the MPI/UCLA restored Rathbone/Bruce Sherlock Holmes films -- these are the ones to get and you can forget about the three or four entries which are available at the local Dollar Store for a buck (but not ""Pursuit to Algiers""). They aren't 1/3 the quality of these fine restorations.

Holmes and Watson plan a vacation to Scotland. They read about stolen emeralds. They stop for fish and chips at the Soho Oyster House. Holmes deduces an invitation from chance events, they walk there. The Prime Minister of Ravenia asks for Holmes help. Their king was assassinated, they want the prince safeguarded. An airplane will carry Holmes and the prince, Watson will travel by ship. Watson learns the airplane carrying Holmes and the prince crashed in the mountains! But that trip was a ruse, Holmes and the prince are on the ship. A young woman asks the prince for a walk; Watson follows in the fog. There are songs for entertainment. Then the ship stops to take three passengers aboard.

The next morning they are served coffee for breakfast; the cream gives a sign! The ship passes the Rock of Gibraltar. Mirko and Gregor plot against the prince. Theres no hurry. Mirkos hand is damaged in an accident! Holmes talks to Sheila about her music case. Later Sheila sings Flow Gently Sweet Afton for Watson. Then Watson sings Loch Lomond. Watson talks about the Giant Rat of Sumatra to the people at his table. Later Gregor uses a ruse to capture the prince and immobilize Holmes! Has Holmes failed? No, there is a surprise that kept the prince hidden in plain sight. At the end the three villains are caught ashore, the prince is saved. Holmes explains why he kept the secret hidden from Watson - he is too honest. Never think about becoming an actor says Holmes. [This is an inside joke.]

The shipboard location results in a static setting, like a stage play. The plot has a surprise at the end that redeems this average story. Using bungling assassins detracts from this story. Was there no picture of the prince available? Overall, this is like a parody or satire.
