7910885,5,B00000INCP,"Analogous to Expect The Unexpected (1998) and The Odd One Dies (1998) Patrick Yau is the nominal director but did not do the vast majority of directing for this movie (Johnnie To has stated he directed about half before To ultimately took over; I do not know how much To reshot).  It is interesting to see reviews of its time praising Yau, though unfortunately he directed only one more film The Losers Club in 2001. Yau was even nominated for Best Director for the Hong Kong Film Awards.  He has no film credits since though he has directed some Mainland TV according to To.  One wonders how much emotionally draining it was being pulled from three productions.  Hindsight is 20/20 and you can see many of Johnnie Tos trademarks and auteuristic touches here that were not as recognizable then, especially when many thought it was done by another director.

 The Chinese title of this film is  which translates to dark flower(s) which means the bounty offered (the successful hit price.)  The noirish The Longest Nite takes place in Macau* and covers a maze and a morass of one day and night (reminding me a little of Run All Night (2015)) of a hit man Tony (Lau Ching-wan: Expect the Unexpected, Mad Detective) and a cop Sam (Tony Leung Chiu-wai: Happy Together).  Johnnie To brings out a quite familiar thematic element of the Doppelganger (and Lam Suet) though uses it to an extreme here.  The narration** starts by explaining that there are two factions led by Mr. K and Lung in Macau mirroring the real life 14 K and Shui Fong triads.  Sam is a corrupt cop whose allegiance is to Mr. K. but is in the unenviable position of trying to prevent a 5 Million dollar hit on Mr. Lung.  While this might seem advantageous to Sam there is a puppet master, a true Godfather, in Mr. Hung, who seems to be the only one who is actually in charge (it reminds me of that great Bela Lugosi quote in Glen or Glenda Pull the string) though he has not been in Macau in over a decade.

 Tony (Lau Ching-wan) is a phlegmatic and sometimes suicidal hired hitman with a bald head, a tattoo and calm demeanor.  He is so enigmatic that he sometimes seems more like an archetype than an actual human analogous to a Jef Costello of Le samoura without the sartorial skill.  He comes off not as evil as Sam, but there are no heroes here.  Lau Ching-wans acting performance is superb though.  Tony clashes pretty quickly with Sam because of Tonys aura and is given a suggestion to get out of town.  Of course we know Tony will not follow this sagacious advice.  But are there ulterior motives behind Tony being there?  And what role will Sam play in the scheme of things?

 I am avoiding going into too much detail with the plot, but one might want to avoid the rest, except for the paragraph on the DVD discussion, if one has not seen this as there might be a couple of spoilers ahead.

 It is amazing how much information you might miss when only watching it one time.  Subsequent rewatches make you realize there are clues planted throughout, but one has to be careful of Tos magician like misdirection.  So much is given away with the phone calls of Tony early on but we might be paying more attention to the beatings from Sam.  A casino worker throwing up was another example of carefully planned misdirection.  At first you see an overabundance of coincidences, but some of them are actually carefully planned, though it does make a few seemed overly lucky like Sam finding Maggie so quickly.

 There are brilliant moments throughout.  I loved the look ma no hands driving scene. One of the better scenes of intimidation deals with Tony on an elevator when he politely answers a question Did you come here to cause trouble? with a serene yes.  Would you have entered the lift with him?  Contrast this with Tommy DeVitos What do you mean I'm funny?  The cinematography is superlative with the highlights being the early moment in the dinner, another brilliant use of light with the jail scene and floating dust and of course the aforementioned mirror scene inspired by Orson Welles.  This film might have even looked better in black-and-white.

 There are allusions to other films throughout both past and future.  According to Johnnie To the theme was inspired by the score in Midnight Express (1978). The jail scene reminds me and many other writers of Steve McQueen bouncing the ball in The Great Escape.** The warehouse scene is a homage to The Lady From Shanghai and was used earlier in Enter the Dragon and would later be used in another superb variation in Tos Mad Detective.  The torture scenes would take new heights in his Election series though the digit manipulation is reminiscent of The Odd One Dies and prolonged abuse like the slapping scene in PTU.

 Because of the doleful nature of this and several other Milkway films To decided to be a little lighter with both The Mission and Running Out of Time.  But I find it interesting to note that this film was the highest grossing Milkway film until Running Out of Time the following year. This is a brilliant modern-day noir with a byzantine plot that may be difficult to understand especially if you are not paying enough attention.  While this did not have Tos name on it, his touch is.  Like most of his earlier films I feel this is vastly underrated and is a good watch for any fans of crime movies though you might have to watch it twice.  You probably should watch it at least twice.

 I watched this with a non-anamorphic letterbox Universe Laser R0/NTSC DVD.  It is OOP.  It has a Cantonese (preferred) and Mandarin audios.  It has two Chinese subtitles (Traditional and Simplified) and an English one.  For extras it has Stars Files text (Chinese, English), a trailer, footage of the premiere (2m21s; Cantonese with no subtitles), Making of video (10m01s; Cantonese with no subtitles), NG Footage (2m58s; these are outtakes, no dialogue) and a Press Conference (6m16s; no subs though you can see Johnnie To buzz cut Lau Ching-wans hair). While the video is decent a better release of this in either DVD and/or BD would be quite welcomed with translated extras and hopefully new ones.  I do wonder why Criterion has not done a Johnnie To release.

 * According to Stephen Teo in his wonderful book Director in Action: Johnnie To and the Hong Kong Action Films (2007), To had thought about shooting this movie in Cuba then in Buenos Aires but settled for Macau for both budget reasons and in retaining a Latin American influenced setting.  It is also important to note that Macau would not be handed over to China until 1999 in which Hong Kong was handed over the year before this films release.

 ** There was a preview version that did not have the initial narration, but was included afterwards because the audience found the plot confusing.  Narration is relatively rare in Johnnie Tos films with some exceptions like this and Fulltime Killer.

 *** To is brilliant at filming little scenes of ennui analogous to Michelangelo Antonioni and passing time like the paper football match in The Mission.  Look at how many films he can incorporate a cooking scene including Breaking News or Vengeance.",1454371200,,7150,4.65311004784689
7910886,4,B00000INCP,amazing film. one of the best team up/versus films in the history of Hong Kong cinema. A must watch for any real film fans.,1385856000,,123,4.166666666666667
7910887,4,B00000INCP,"""The Longest Nite"" is a dark, moody movie with a minimum of gunplay at first, but no lack of violence, that builds to a tense (but sadly unrealistic) climax. Lau Ching Wan, a Milkyway regular, plays the deadly calm Tony, a mysterious figure in disco denim who crosses paths in Macau with self-professed ""bad cop"" Sam, played by Tony Leung Chiu Wai. Lau is the baddest of the bad. I'm tempted to call him ""the Asian Benicio Del Toro,"" and not just because there's a physical resemblance. Lau is the coolest guy to walk Portland Street since Chow Yun Fat left for Hollywood. And in many ways, LCW even surpasses CYF's coolness.

Leung's rumpled Sam--quite a departure from the suave Tony/Alan in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hard-Boiled/dp/B000N4SHNK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hard-Boiled</a>""--is not just a bad cop, but cruel, too. He spends the movie crushing the hands of hit men and sticking ice picks under their fingernails. Sam is trying to keep the peace between Mr. K and Mr. Lung, a couple of adversarial triad bosses trying to break out from under the thumb of Mr. Hung, the Biggest Boss. Only thing is, everybody starts turning up dead, and fingers (and guns) start pointing at Sam.

In staging the final confrontation between Sam and Tony, director Patrick Yau Tat Chi pulls out all the stops with the gunplay, but also throws out all the logic: apparently in HK there are abandoned warehouses with hundreds of mirrors strategically arranged in an upright position? Instead of the over-the-top firearms action that steps decisively into ""enough already"" territory, ""TLN"" would have been much more satisfying with a short, brutal hand-to-hand fight between the two bad guys, followed by the nifty little twist at the end that makes you go ""hmm."" Maggie Shiu gives both the strangest and the most fascinating performance in the film, as a neurotic club hostess who is not what she seems.

The DVD transfer is above average, but it's too bad it wasn't better--the picture is somewhat diffuse, and there is noticeable ghosting, particularly in night shot--because ""TLN"" boasts excellent cinematography and editing, with some funky and innovative scene transitions, quirky establishing shots, and visual flourishes. The music, however, is another story: the major musical piece is Giorgio Moroder's theme from ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midnight-Express/dp/B000ZM1MGE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midnight Express</a>"" (if memory serves). Which is not a bad piece of music, but why not make some of your own? ""Composer"" Raymond Wong answers that question by starting the flick with a light, happy 12-bar synth blues piece that not only doesn't fit the mood of the movie, but returns to suck every last bit of tension from what should have been a very dramatic confrontation between Lau and Leung. It's a shame, because cheesy music is one of my major peeves about HK flicks, and some of Wong's other original music is pretty damn good. Of course, the ripping of the ""Midnight Express"" (or was it ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scarface/dp/B000GGSMB2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scarface</a>""?) music calls into question the originality of the rest of the score, but Wong shows promise. Too bad he couldn't (or wasn't allowed to) write something a little more fitting.

While the movie's sound is not great, and the voice and effects sync is noticeably off, the Universe DVD includes the most extras I've seen on an HK disc, including star files and a movie trailer; a short ""premiere show"" with comments from Leung, Lau, and To, and an appearance by Simon Yam; a ""making of"" featurette; NG footage; and a press conference (Cantonese, no subs).

I have a great deal of respect for Johnnie To Kei Fung and Wai Ka Fai's Milkyway Image Productions. Milkyway is committed to making interesting movies with style, and their efforts put them head and shoulders above the usual profiteering hacks that dominate the HK movie industry. ""The Longest Nite"" is a solid and noteworthy bit of originality in the middle of a sea of hasty rip-offs and sequels. Now if they would only pay as much attention to the music as they do to the cinematography, they'd have, hands down, the best product on the market.",1223769600,,4323,5.314327485380117
7910888,4,B00000INCP,"The Longest Nite is a very, VERY dark Hong Kong thriller starring Tony Leung as an extremely bad cop having an extremely bad night - you know, the usual round of smashing hoodlums' gun hands, torturing suspects and witnesses alike, finding a headless body in his apartment with a locker number written on its hand, being set up to kill the crimelord he works for: probably all in day's work in Macau.

While the first 20 minutes or so are very grim and exceptionally merciless, when the plot kicks in and the wheels start turning and the fingers start pointing, it actually becomes a gripping little number, with one quite superb sequence at a ferry station as the walls start to come crashing down on our anti-hero. Sadly the last 20 minutes are average shoot-em-up stuff that lacks the ingenuity of the central sting, but if you can stomach the violence it's well worth a look. Leung in particular is ideally cast - he has the perfect hangdog face for this kind of character, conveying world-weariness, confusion and desperation without seeming to need to make any effort.",1119052800,8,1074,4.74331550802139
7910889,5,B00000INCP,"I've know about Tont Leung for awhile now and know that he is a superb chinese actor.  He was the undercover cop in the movie ""Hardboiled"" with Chow Yun Fat.  In this movie he is cool, as other reviewers have noted, he plays a corrupt cop.  You really have to pay attention watching this movie.  The little details such as phone numbers of a restaurant and the number written on a hand of a headless corpse.  My favorite part is where the assasin tells Sam that he'll know what will happen in an hour, talk about suspense.  This movie was made in 1998 is I'am not mistaken.  The languages that are only available for this movie are cantonese and mandarin.  The pace that the subtitles appear is a bit fast, becomes even more important because there is no wasted dialog in this movie.  Longest nite is a bit violent, Sam likes to snap off fingernails as a form of torture and he is generally sadistic.",1094688000,5,900,4.406060606060606
7910890,5,B00000INCP,"Tony Leung is Sam, a bad cop who's caught in a gang war in Macao. he works for Brother K, who's in negotiations with rival triad boss Lung to join forces after a long-running feud. And then there's a word on the street that Lung's life is equal to five million. And the bold stranger( Lau Ching Wan) comes in thepicture then it gets worse....
Disturbingly violent, perfect pace, and very involving plot. There are more twist in this movie than L.A. Confidential, etc.",1029196800,,467,4.571428571428571
7910891,4,B00000INCP,"This is Lau Ching Wan at his best.  This film is another reason why he has proclaimed the acting crown of Chow Yun Fat once he left Hong Kong to do movies in the US.  Many of Lau Ching Wan's movies have him characterized as the cool cop you would wanna hang with or the lovable hard-on-his-luck guy that girls can't help [but]feel something for.  In the Longest Nite, he is just a pure bad-ass with a bald head.  The taxi scene and his conversation in his holding cell with Tony Leung are worth the purchase of this movie alone!  DO buy it!",1008806400,6,540,4.203883495145631
7910892,5,B00000INCP,"The Longest Nite is by far one of my faviouite action films for it shear use of story, actors, characters, and shoot outs.
In the film Lau Ching Wan plays a cunning hitman that is hired as plan to destroy Tony Leung's career, Leung plays a ruthless and corrupt police officer who's helping the local Triad gangs in their turf war with other Triad criminals.
Lau Ching Wan and Tony Leung are superb in this film and oppose each other with an entertaining and riviting excellance of acting. Fans of films like 'Heroes Never Die' and 'Running Out of Time' will love this film. This is a well made film that excells against anything that the Americans could make as it gives great proformances through out the entire cast. A good film to add to an action collection as it as smart as it is action packed.
This film is for people with a fully loaded mind rather than an empy shell for a head that gets filled up with useless and mundane films. This is cinema at it's best.",1005091200,3,967,4.377777777777778
7910893,5,B00000INCP,"This is a must see DVD! This movie is Hong Kong action at it's best, and it is almost perfectly made. The movie never slows down and you must pay attention to detail. As I said befor this is a must see DVD.",992476800,3,206,3.813953488372093
7910894,5,B00000INCP,"This film boasts an incredible first hour as Tony Leung Chui-Wai's corrupt cop attempts to keep rival gangs from breaking a truce on the night of an important triad meeting.  He's also trying to keep at bay a wave of two-bit  hitmen who have come into town in response to a contract on one mob boss's  head.  Oh, yeah, and if all this wasn't enough, a decapitated body is  discovered in his apartment and a bald Lau Ching-Wan is popping up  mysteriously like Clint Eastwood in one of his Westerns.  What develops is  one of the more inventive and devious chess matches on film.
I remember  seeing this film for the first time and finding myself just smiling over  its intricate plot and images.  There's a dimly lit scene in a holding cell  that's magical despite being somewhat brutal, and Tong Leung and Lau  Ching-Wan are excellent.
The film does unravel a bit in its final act.  The  final showdown is a bit over-the-top and noisy, but the filmmakers  (Milkyway Productions) have built up so much goodwill during the previous  hour or so that it doesn't matter.  Until ""The Mission"" came out,  I considered this Milkyway's finest effort.
Highly recommended.
For the  record, the DVD contains some unsubtitled footage of a press conference and  initial showing with the cast.  There's an excellent trailer (though it is  incorrectly preceded by a scene from the actual film) and some unused  footage (without sound).  Unlike the VCD, the subtitles are not small and  can be removed.  One may select either Cantonese or Mandarin (oddly enough,  there is a line or two of Mandarin which is subtitled in English while  there is no accompanying Cantonese dialog).",958089600,4,1662,4.794326241134752
