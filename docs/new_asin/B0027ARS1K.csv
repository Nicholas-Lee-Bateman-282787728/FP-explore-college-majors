8354370,2,B0027ARS1K,Two of the DVD's  were not recorded properly and the audio could not be heard.  I do not recommend this package.,1385683200,3,112,4.285714285714286
8354371,1,B0027ARS1K,"The subject matter is very important, interesting and sadly not well known. The quality of the production was about what you expect from a pair of eight year olds with an old camera. Whenever a subject speaks in another language, the English dub is no louder than the original, making it impossible to understand what the subject is saying in either language. The DVDs themselves are cheaply made (I have the same burner at home), and it shows with the video suddenly freezing periodically throughout each of the DVDs. Finally, most of the material could have been combined in one DVD--each DVD is about 50 minutes in length and contains long stretches of material common to all DVDs.

I am looking forward to seeing a remake of the material here by the History Channel or something similar--it is a piece of history too important to consign to a third rate production.",1263600000,17,869,4.754966887417218
