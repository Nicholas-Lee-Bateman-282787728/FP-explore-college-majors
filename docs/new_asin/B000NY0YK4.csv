2788189,4,B000NY0YK4,"There is no excuse for the actions of the troops during the Abu Ghraib incidents. However, before people feel the need to judge others understand that these men and women were untrained in their guard duties, they were supposed to 'care' for people that had, in their eyes, murdered their comrades, were literally living in Sadams old torture chambers where they had to clean off the blood before they could lay down cots and were often at a lack of food and water themselves. They may not get new shipments of basic necessities for long periods of time. I highly recommend this movie and ask that you hold your opinions till the end. These troops were literally living in HELL.  Again, no excuse and they needed to be punished, but who hasn't ever been tired, hungry and snapped at a friend or family member? Multiply that by 1,000 and you BEGIN to understand what these men and women had to deal with.",1259712000,,903,4.574074074074074
2788190,5,B000NY0YK4,"""Continue!"" commanded the experimenter. The volunteer did as he was told even though he thought he was providing extraordinarily painful levels of shock to the actor in the next room. All the volunteers did as they were told with the majority administering ""lethal"" levels at 450 volts. A psychologist named Dr. Stanley Milgram conducted this experiment at Yale in 1961. This is how Rory Kennedy's film begins.

Forty-two years later the United States is taking Taliban and al Qaeda prisoners in Afghanistan and Iraq. But how should they be classified, as prisoners of war? John Yoo, counsel at the Department of Justice explains that these ""detainees"" do not fit the description of prisoners of war, and therefore, are not afforded the protections the Convention provides. Furthermore, it is believed that these detainees have information vital to the war on terror, and it must be gotten from them. But, once again, John Yoo is perplexed by the wording of the Geneva Convention which forbids ""severe"" treatment of prisoners. ""What does that mean,"" Yoo asks the camera. He suggests that it should only describe loss of bodily functions, organ failure, or death. Yoo does not note for us that the last two are usually too late to reverse the technique. By this standard, Japanese officers executed after World War II for torturing allies did not commit torture at all--not even Saddam Hussein! The White House agrees with Yoo's assessment and decides that those in their custody will not be given protection under the Geneva Convention.

Now, it's a question of how to get information. Major General Geoffrey Miller (USA) is transferred from Guantanamo to Iraq. He believes that information must be obtained at all costs. Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld approves techniques called sensory deprivation, dietary manipulation, stress positions, presence of military dogs, and sleep management.

The 372nd Military Police Company is under the command of Brigadier General Janis Karpinski. When the company arrives in Iraq, they find that they are assigned as correction officers at Abu Ghraib, something they are not trained to do. With the arrival of MG Miller, they are put under the command of Military Intelligence, the C.I.A., and a variety of contractors hired by the military. They follow orders to carry out all of the above.

Some of them will follow orders in the belief that they are moral orders; some will carry them out even if they feel what they are doing is questionable. A very few will complain to their chain of command. All of these military police personnel, to a soldier believe that if the pictures of Abu-Ghraib had not become public that there would not have been an investigation.

But then, Specialist Granger, an experienced correction officer who seems to enjoy the power from the misery he can inflict on others, gives Specialist Darby diskettes of photographs for him to copy as a keepsake of his tour in Iraq. When Darby gets to the second one he is appalled at what he sees. He follows his conscience and his training, and leaves the disk under the door of army detectives known as the Criminal Investigative Division, or CID. Darby's identity is safe, that is, until Secdef Rumsfeld mentions him by name on national television. Darby is whisked out of country and lives under federal protection, under an alias to this day.

Eleven members of the Abu-Ghraib prison were court-martialed with Granger being found guilty and given ten years at hard labor, even though a colonel officially commended Granger for his performance at the prison. The others, all enlisted personnel, were given far lighter sentences. No officers were found guilty other than BG Karpinski who was demoted in rank and forced to retire,  MG Miller is awarded the Distinguished Service Medal.

Many of these enlisted men and women at Abu-Ghraib were interviewed for this film. We never hear questions given to them, but their doubts, their confusion, their apologies, their excuses, their remorse about their mission, their responsibilities, and their questions about why where they were the only ones tried, come through loud and clear.

The simple answer is that there were so many investigations, that none of them had any teeth.  None were given carte blanche to investigate the highest levels of decision-making where these abuses originated. Many of these MP's employed abusive techniques that they never would have known about without having been told how to execute them.

All of these prisoners in Tier 1 were supposed to be hard-core al-Qaeda supporters with actionable intelligence. All were released without charge. No intelligence was ever gained from any one of them under torture. To this date the military has yet to publicize how many died in custody.

The film ends where it started, with the experiments. Dr. Milgram poses the question: If we can get people to do immoral or criminal acts because they believe it is coming from authority figures, think how easy it will be if it is done in the name of a country with all its prestige and legitimacy behind it.

Milgram asks us to consider the unthinkable:

Perhaps there is a little bit of Nazi in all of us.

2788192,4,B000NY0YK4,"Another film I saw at Sundance in 2007 before its release on HBO.  Provocative and hard hitting film with more access than you'd think possible.  I already knew a lot about the Abu Ghraib situation -- but knowing and seeing it up close are two different things.

One quibble is that the glossy interview style which HBO seems to require for its documentaries is somewhat at odds stylistically with the gritty subject matter.

I also feel the film could have been tougher on US military prison policy in the region -- but given what must have been a very difficult situation, I'm amazed filmmaker Rory Kennedy was able to get as much access to the individual soldiers and show as much as she did.",1199923200,,695,4.580645161290323

While the film does not concentrate enough on the government cover-up it shows enough that should alarm any 'true' GOD fearing (and patriotic American citizen) that the government is out of control and cannot be trusted. Escapegoats and patsies are a real part of US history. It sickens me everytime I see a Bush/Cheney sticker as they should be replaced with impeachment stickers for the LYING-self proclaimed believer-in-GOD man.

2788194,2,B000NY0YK4,"This is a potentially good movie that could have greatly furthered the worldwide debate on policies of torture by the United States government. In the end, though, the film falls victim to its own sort of narrow, self-limiting vision of America.

One appropriate subtitle for this movie might well have been: ""What happens to good people who are caught up in bad situations"". Filmmaker Rory Kennedy makes the point, in the movie and her audio commentary, that the low-level U.S. military guards at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq who were caught in those embarrassing torture photos seen round the world were basically ""sweet"" and ""likable"" young people who were scapegoated by the Pentagon and the Bush administration.

But what is most disturbing with that story line is that not one of those former American guards, neither men nor women -- and Kennedy admittedly scores a filmmaking coup in getting them to talk on camera about their experiences at Abu Ghraib -- ever shows anything resembling remorse about participating in torture against innocent Iraqi people. The closest they get to that in this film is when one male U.S. soldier cries over the death of an Iraqi man in his custody, though that death was only marginally related to Abu Ghraib. It is left up to one Iraqi torture victim at Abu Ghraib, who openly weeps at the memory of the torture-induced death of his elderly father at Abu Ghraib, to give this movie any real emotional depth.

Or if that subtitle doesn't grab you, another suitable subtitle for this film might well be: ""Made of the American people, by the American people, for the American people"". The former Iraqi detainees of Abu Ghraib are the only ""non-Americans"" featured in interviewees throughout this film. It's all ""us, we, our"" among the U.S. soldiers, academics and others interviewed for this film. The DVD packaging itself labels the Abu Ghraib torture photos as ""photographs that are etched in our national consciousness"". Our national consciousness? Those photos outraged the consciousness of the whole world, not just people living in the USA or in the Arab world.

The real ghosts of Abu Ghraib prison are not to be found in the dank, dark halls of Saddam Hussein's notorious gulag, now taken over by the Americans. No, the real ghosts of Abu Ghraib are to be found in the well-documented cases of prisons and jails all across the USA, where brown-skinned men and women have been routinely tortured physically and psychologically for many decades. The ghosts of Abu Ghraib have long roamed and wandered through the violence of U.S. society, especially in the cells and hallways of its vast prison system.

I suppose one shouldn't be so hard on filmmaker Rory Kennedy; after all, she is the youngest child of the late Robert F. Kennedy (assassinated in 1968) and the niece of former U.S. president John F. Kennedy (assassinated in 1963). And we all know that the Kennedy family stands as a liberal American voice of moral concern at times. One could also fairly argue that it is Americans who most need to see such a movie and reflect yet one more time on what their ""national consciousness"" is doing to all the other people on this planet.

Still, this movie could have been so much more. The full story of Abu Ghraib has never really been told and may never be, given that the U.S. government is, if some U.S. news media are to be believed, fighting tooth and nail today to prevent other photos and videos of Abu Ghraib prison from publicly surfacing -- images and sounds that are reported to be even more shocking than what the world has already seen. Why did this movie skirt all around that issue, while devoting much time to issues of ""good people caught up in bad situations""? Is that really the way most Americans look at their own military's torture of innocent people overseas?

I give ""Ghosts of Abu Ghraib"" a perfect 5 stars for its potential -- minus 3 stars for once again letting the American people off the hook when it comes to telling the full truth and taking full moral responsibility for their actions before the people of the world.",1185840000,14,4097,4.778248587570621
2788195,1,B000NY0YK4,"I am not sure what is more disgraceful: the soldier's behavior at Abu Ghraib or Rory Kennedy's attempts to rationalize and frame their actions. They knew the law as all soldiers do. The Law of Land Warfare and basic Geneva are taught to every soldier in Basic Training. MPs receive even more training in the subject. I am tired of hearing excuses for their abuses and I am not exactly sure what Kennedy wants to achieve by putting the soldiers on camera. In doing so, they look like the victims of ""policy"" rather than the prisoners (who largely remain nameless and faceless).

A far better film is the recently released ""The Prisoner or: How I Planned to Kill Tony Blair"" which tells the story of man wrongly sent to Abu Ghraib  and that of his guards (who knew right from wrong).

Kennedy would be well served to go to Iraq to see the day to day stresses that soldiers face and how the majority correctly and morally deal with those stresses.

2788196,4,B000NY0YK4,"Just looking at video footage of Abu Ghraib prison is enough to set you on edge due to its eerie environment and knowing the sinister past it played under Saddam Hussein's regime.  This is how `Ghosts of Abu Ghraib' begins and it sets a tone for the revealing and disturbing information to follow

Using a collection of interviews from military personnel, former prisoners, and selected other authorities, the scandal at this infamous Iraqi prison comes full circle and attempts to explain what actually occurred there, who the players were, and consequences of these events.

First and foremost, the operative word for what happened to prisoners would be `torture'.  It's no stretch to realize that methods used in Abu Ghraib were a clear violation of Geneva Convention Accords.  To circumvent `official policy', it is interesting how the U.S. Justice Department and other government entities interpreted the status of the prisoners and reworked policy definitions on how to conduct interrogation and torture.  One certain area looked at is Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  Somewhere down the line, the questionable methods used here were eventually adapted for use in Abu Ghraib.  After looking at all the sordid photographs of the prisoners in this program, what is seen looks less like torture methods and more like concentrated acts of humiliation and degradation brought about by the military police guards.

Knowing that U.S. military guards were not properly trained in corrections duties and that somewhere in the scheme of things the Military Intelligence section ending up calling the shots, it makes you wonder if there was anything organized occurring at all at Abu Ghraib.  Discretion never seemed to be a foremost concern either due to so many damaging and disgusting photographs being taken and eventually given to the Army Criminal Investigation Division.  Once the secret was out, damage control went into full swing.  The U.S. government began a campaign of disinformation and deception to protect those at the top and to make scapegoats of many at the bottom.  The official explanations of ignorance of these events and then blaming a `few bad soldiers' who did this all on their own are just ridiculous.

`Ghosts of Abu Ghraib', while a really good documentary in my opinion, is also one that is bound to spark disgust, anger, disbelief, and a host of other emotions in viewers.  Despite this program showing a very dark and graphic chapter in our military's history and one that is bound to haunt us for a long time to come, I would recommend this program to everyone as a more thorough dissection of the Abu Ghraib scandal rather than what the media revealed.",1181606400,5,2672,5.068493150684931
2788197,5,B000NY0YK4,"In a political science class of mine the other day, my professor popped in this film and gave no intro, except to say the title.  After the film was over I realized why, because this documentary goes into greater detail then my professor ever could, in way far more telling.

First off, as you can see by the title, the documentary is about the prison camp Abu Ghraib.  At first you get an introduction, through soldiers stationed there about the prison, and it's dreary past.  This was a former prison used by Saddam after all; however, the focus wasn't on phantasms.  In fact, the ghosts are perhaps a forewarning of the abuses we now know of; abuses that, as you find out throughout the film, are even more disturbing then you might have imagined, and once again show how humans can lose themselves in the situation, as these soldiers, who are actually narrating this themselves, did during their time in Abu Ghraib.

What most impressed me was the fact that this documentary was able to gather as many soldiers that worked there, along with a couple of the former prisoners.  See at first, I didn't realize the people I was watching talk about the prison, the soldiers, were indeed the one's that were a part of the egregious acts, and you'd never imagine that till the end.  Even more disturbing, is how these soldiers, clearly not jailers, were hung up to dry as ""a few bad soldiers"" when, as the movie shows, torture was a policy from above, not a spontaneous action from below.

Clearly, this film may shake peoples ideas differently based on their political viewpoints; however, I believe that no matter the party, or persuasion, you should watch this film.  My only warning is that this film is graphic, so be forewarned.  Otherwise, hopefully this excellent documentary will open your eyes, as it did mine, to the situation in Abu Ghraib that we only thought we knew...",1177804800,12,1880,4.683890577507599
2788198,4,B000NY0YK4,"I feel a bit disconnected to a rating of 4 stars....only because, in the very furthest reaches of my mind do I connect the USA Armed Forces, any branch... and the UNITED STATES, via (unfortunately) the hopes, prayers and dreams of our forefathers, now so swiftly and stealthily circumvented, twisted and evil- ,  (but however it must be, so it is).  I loved my military career, and I love my country- and willingly would have given my life to defend & protect,  both- DOS: 10-69-1970-1990/ETS-  and yet, my eyes do not deceive me. Rating this film @ 4, does that mean I enjoyed and appreciated the full effect this film BEGS people to view and understand...being Americans does not make us impervious to physical and psychological tenets of soldier-ship, which are in all ways and means, disgusting and filthy to the rest of the world.  Huh. Excuse me, but one wants to know truth.  Is that perception of million, reality? DO we have a country and citizens we protect?  To those who may have been on my right or left flanks....those whom I would lay down my life to preserve theirs, I am offended.  I just can't bring myself to imagine how these few, in the film,  did not question orders, these who could have borne combat right next to me; borrowed my poncho when necessary; marched shoulder to shoulder with me...I am absolutely boggled at the thought.
So this film explores, mayhap for the first time, what it means to follow orders or obey your own conscience and what you feel is right.  Your soul is summoned.  Time to decide....crunch time, in a heartbeat.  Is this thing I am about to do going to harm me, my loyalties, my family, my country, my soul....(?)
I would say most definitely.  As a retired Army nurse, I am appalled.  Everything in me screams out that I should make certain everyone I know gets the chance to see this film. To know of its existence.  What prevents me from that type of act? Shame.  And great sorrow.  Underneath, lies fear of judgment.
I would still defend and protect, but I am old now.  In my place, I would ask any and all latter generations, (militarily-bent or not) but young, citizens,  no matter where you live and work, to pay attention.  Wake up from complacency and get involved.  If we are, as this film suggests , immured to these horrific images, let us take pause and examine once and forever, what we are supposed to do:  Defend and Protect.  ALL of us.  Crossing all the usual and (IMO) unnecessary,  divisiveness .  If only everyone's eyes were not shuttered.
Sadly, regretfully, and abominably eternally, they appear to remain so.  Politicions lie.  Corporations, the same. Maybe your neighbor.  But why should YOU?

Sheep (who should have known better) have been fed to wolves, here.  That's the cost of doing business in the world, 13 years post 9-11-2001.  NOW, we need to be aware.  This film goes to that dark place. .. the ultimate choice will always come back to rest upon our  fellow man's weary shoulders.

2788217,5,B000NY0YK4,"Beginning with an overview of Milgram's 1961 ""Obedience"" experiment, this film documents the way in which military policies set by Rumsfeld and General Miller percolated downwards to the low-level military personnel, resulting in the atrocities which came to light thanks to Joseph Darby's courageous act of reporting the abuses he learned about through Charles Grainer's photographs of prisoners being abused.

The documentary is superb for its mixture of interviews with the victims and the perpetrators of these atrocities.  It becomes manifestly clear that the military personnel who were ultimately prosecuted for the abuses were encouraged, albeit indirectly, by their superiors.  It is equally clear that the whistleblowers (such as Darby) were ruthlessly exposed and punished for bringing these heinous acts to light.  Furthermore, it gives the victims a voice, though a fleeting one.

I use this documentary in conjunction with Orwell's 1984 (Book 3, chapter 2) which details torture techniques.  It is an effective film which educates my students on events of which they have little knowledge (being too young, generally to remember events from which they were probably rightly shielded by their parents).

I WAS THERE. As someone who came into Abu Ghraib after the scandal as part of another Command that took over, I can attest that this is NOT the whole story. WHY the U.S. doesn't come clean on exactly who the prisoners WERE? Dunno. Still doesn't make it OK but you have to realize this place is 388 ACRES of prison, 18 guard towers facing IN, surrounded by high walls. Iraqis told us they estimated at LEAST 50k people were EXECUTED there. Ghosts? LITERALLY. This is the darkest most EVIL place I have EVER lived, and I was there for over 6 months as part of a rotating deployment to Iraq in 2004-5. This PLACE was EVIL incarnate and I watched it hammer the troops with nightmares, and darkness every single day. We got hammered with mortar attacks EVERY DAY. Because of 'the scandal' none of what those who did their jobs there --namely Detainee Ops--were ever in the news. We were IGNORED, hammered with mortars and gunfire every day, one battle continuous for nearly 1.5 hours of non stop guns and mortars...let me tell you it WAS Hell.

And Iraqis? THEY LIE THRU THEIR TEETH. IF they say ANYTHING god about America the Taliban/Isis etc etc will KILL them and their entire family. SO NO ONE EVER SAYS ANYTHING GOOD AND THEY LIE LIE LIE. Americans are totally gullible and newspeople SEE the military as ENEMY and love biased reporting. The pictures WERE horrible but was not the whole story--though it as no excuse either. But you must TRY to understand what these military personnel went thru BEING THERE in order to even begin to comprehend what happened. And those that did the atrocities? Were NOT the majority--they were a TINY bunch of low-life's that the place got to and they went over the dark side...while I was there no one was tortured in ANY way. NO ONE. But they loved tthe press and WOULD lie every chance they got. when they complained we didn't give them beds? The Red Cross got uppity and because of the scandal? They got METAL frame beds (they customarily sleep in mattresses on the floor!)..guess what happened. Dead Americans. THEN we could dismantle the murderous beds and get them the hell out of there! Politics put Americans at risk because no one understood what we were dealing with.

The 'Detainees' that the Soldiers tortured (those in the pics) were NOT DETAINEES. They were in a place we called 'the hard site' where CAREER MURDERERS AND RAPISTS AND CAREER REALLY BAD BAD BAD CRIMINALS GO, PLACED THERE BY SADDAM--not the USA. They killed their physician--they were ANIMALS, in Human bodies but so dangerous and demented from years of prison under SADDAM. After this scandal happened, for no matter WHAT reasons (I have theories about incarnate evil influencing people too that you'd think crazed...)..The USA gave all the prisoners BACK to Iraq to deal with. They disappeared one day, let back into wherever they went with the Iraqis who took them to another facility.

You have to see, American PUBLIC, that Iraq is TRIBAL. One village will attack and kill another. sunni Muslims HATE Shia Muslims. They will KILL aShia at a Sunni Hospital and vise versa. ONLY SADDAM COULD CONTROL IRAQ BECAUSE OF THIS--HE WAS SUCH A BAD-ASS THEY FEARED HIM ENOUGH TO STAY IN LINE.  They have NO understanding of democracy; they are hundreds of years BEHIND us. We can never force our ways on them! Get real! ONLY THOSE WHO SEE AND HAVE BEEN THERE UNDERSTAND THIS. (Our politicians sure do not!)

But Wolfowitz and his gang made MILLIONS with Halliburton stock...etc etc yada yada.

So--I got wounded in 2007 so now I'm retired and can SPEAK OUT.

Maltreatment of detainees in 2003-2004 during the time of war is not the same as actual torture that took place during the old Iraqi regime: detainees were not whipped, electrocuted, tied to a fan, cut, blow-torched or thrown down on concrete from upper floors and were not paralyzed from waist down. This is compared to crawling nude on a leash as a humiliation interrogation tactic. No ghosts here...",1481932800,,569,4.876288659793815

Low-ranking soldiers were punished, and high-ranking ones were promoted.  And the criminal politicians walk away unscathed, even after they re-write the laws on torture.
