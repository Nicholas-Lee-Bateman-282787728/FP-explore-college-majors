8031761,5,B0002TT02I,"I really enjoyed this movie. I thought it was pretty good. It's probably not for everybody,but Stephen Chow was funny. Sort of like a J. Chan movie. Transported back in time because he used powerful kung-fu he finds himself in early 1900's Shanghai. He gets job with good guy gambler and falls in love. I won't say any more because I don't want to ruin it,however it was a pretty good movie. Also,Gong Li as twins adds something special.",1154217600,2,437,4.544303797468355
