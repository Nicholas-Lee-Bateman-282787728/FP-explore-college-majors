6517068,4,B00LZS8YA4,"Beginning was a little slow, but once it got going, it was quite intense.  Another reviewer mentioned that this was like a remake of ""Right at your Door"", while I will agree the plots are somewhat similar, the films couldn't be more different.  I enjoyed both, but something about this felt more organic.",1413244800,8,304,4.716981132075472
6517069,5,B00LZS8YA4,"So I heard about this movie from a horror site I follow and figured I'd give it a try. It sounded like a less tongue-in-cheek ""Cabin Fever,"" so why not? It definitely didn't disappoint. Its a little slow for the first 10mins or so, but once it gets going it's very intense. Won't give much away, but these girls slowly start dying off in rather gruesome ways. The gore is pretty awesome considering this is a smaller indie film. The only real comparison I can think of is Cabin Fever, and I thought this story was just as clever. My only real complaint is that some of the acting and dialogue was a little stilted, but otherwise this was well-executed isolation horror (especially for a small indie). Definitely recommend!

6517070,3,B00LZS8YA4,"Basically a remake of Right At Your Door, which was a very good movie. This is ok at best. The writing is kind of sloppy the acting is of junior grade quality and the story has already been done once in the past 5 years.

6517072,1,B00LZS8YA4,"I was not expecting a 4 start movie, but I was hoping for something mildly passable and something to kill sometime.  This movie had a good premise.  The bad were many like poor editing.  It dragged with nothing of interest to add to the story.  I found myself skipping forward to see where ""something"" might seem to be happening, but no.  Without noticing I had skipped to the middle. BUT the worst part was the acting.  It was painful to watch.  Painful. Very painful.",1422057600,,469,4.511904761904762
6517073,2,B00LZS8YA4,"While there were some good effects and okay acting, I didn't like this movie at all.  I seriously wanted everyone to get chemically peeled already so we could be done with it, especially on obnoxious character.  It was just so damned unrealistic.

6517074,3,B00LZS8YA4,Pretty clever writing if you can get through the whole movie. Lots of gore but still seemed to bore. Not bad and not great just a bit to run of the mill with a decent story. Not sure why I don't like this movie more. Cabin Fever just seemed so fun and this movie was long winded for my tastes I guess. Worth watching and hope the creators improve and make more cause I see talent for sure. Ok movie for the small budget.,1421193600,3,420,4.011904761904762

6517076,5,B00LZS8YA4,"I give this unexpected treat 5 stars....it makes a formidable opponent for a favorite movie of mine, Eli Roth's ""Cabin Fever"". If you enjoyed that movie, you will certainly enjoy this one.  This brings a female cast together for some GREAT believable gore scenes, and when compared to Cabin Fever, this movie may even top that overall.  My husband and I, both horror movie fanatics, thought this one was definitely above most recent horror movies released.  Decent plot, and although the female leads are pretty much unlikable characters throughout the movie, there are a few genuine moments of sympathy.  The ""shower scene"" was really over-the-top, and gore lovers will fall in love fast with this one.  Though there are a few obvious but very minor plot holes or moments when you wonder why *exactly* a character would act in such a manner, overall there is a genuine plot that makes this movie cohesive and is entirely feasible in many ways.  If you are a horror film buff, by all means watch this and enjoy a rarely found unknown gem.  If you are squeamish, or sensitive to horror or gore, then you should probably stay far, far away.  I enjoyed it, and recommend it to other horror movie lovers!",1420329600,5,1200,4.735576923076923

6517083,4,B00LZS8YA4,"An enjoyable movie that has a pretty good all-female cast (through the majority of the movie). Some of the characters are unlikable but they are mostly realistic. In a somewhat dysfunctional way. The plot is original in that it covers the attempted survival of a group in a cabin retreat when a nearby chemical spill occurs.

The gore FX are very good, the acting is good and the atmosphere is strong. It is low budget, but most of the movie takes place in one house, which adds to the claustrophobic feel, common to this sort of movie. Well worth the watch if you enjoyed movies like, or the just the concept, Cabin Fever or Right At your Door.",1417910400,4,645,4.466101694915254

6517099,5,B00LZS8YA4,"I can't get over how good this movie is. BTW, the spoilers are about to come hot and heavy.
Horror is so saturated with the sexploitation of slasher movies that when you see a bunch of young women going out to party hard in a secluded house where there's no cellphone reception, you think you know what to expect. A lot of nudity for one thing. Not that I'm complaining about that as a healthy heterosensitive fellow, but I am a feminist at heart and that's why it's so encouraging to see this movie which is about the real people suffering a real calamity, depicted with the sort of realism seen in the nuclear holocaust movies of the 1980s. And there's even a political bent to it. The last scene, which I did NOT see coming, was a barely metaphorical stab at BP executives who just want their lives back.
There's also a great sexual betrayal plotline, a wonderful scene of the meanest girl character getting her just deserts (I know, nobody deserves to die, but it's a movie) out in the miasma of industrial chemical gas that surrounds the safe house.
And my favorite part was when Jordin (Stephanie Greco) went berserk after spending two thirds of the movie sullen and indrawn. So awesome!",1414627200,6,1193,4.553488372093023
6517100,4,B00LZS8YA4,"Just finished watching this as a rental and wanted to get my review in while it was still very fresh. First, I think the reviews that draw parallels to Cabin Fever are spot-on. I think it's important, though, to note that CF was much funnier and a step above this one in the acting department, as well as in the compelling tension (isolation, growing distrust of ""friends"", etc.) - the fact that Eli Roth was at the helm as director didn't hurt. Now, I'll leave the comparisons there, and review this on it's own.

On that latter basis, I found this movie to be part of a recent trend I've noticed in the improving quality of b-movie, low budget horror. After a 2-3 year relatively disappointing span of essentially nothing but a glut of c-movie/-b-movie micro budget wastes of time, it's been great to see a revitalization of the genre. This one definitely provides yet another pleasant surprise. ** Strangely enough, the cover art - while cool - actually doesn't really convey the content of the film and makes it seem more like a slasher flick, which it certainly is not. ** I highlight that because I passed by this film numerous times in my quick looks for new horror. Anyway, the film provides decent acting, and an interesting, slow-build plot I found moved just at the right pace. There was gore enough for those seeking that component of a horror film, and the believable makeup work was - on which this film could eaaily have foundered - an important and solid addition to the overall experience.",1414454400,10,1506,4.640449438202247
6517101,2,B00LZS8YA4,"Another movie about  a group of twenty-something people in a cabin in the woods that  you have no interest in except to hope that they all get what they deserve.  A group of women decide to have a bachelorette party for a self-obsessed friend.  One woman strangely brings her infant to this gathering.  Another can't figure out why people don't want her smoking in the house and blows smoke on people as they enter.  Oh hell, they're all self-obsessed.  The fiancee shows up with an obnoxious friend and both get sent packing.  Which is the best thing for both of them.  There's a loud noise, but no one thinks much of it.  The next morning two of the women are outside in what appears to be fog, but one notices a weird smell and decides to go back in.  They listen to the news to discover that there's been a train wreck and a chemical spill is causing the fog.  The first girl that went outside has been affected by the chemical gas and starts bleeding.  She then decides that the A/C unit should be shut off to prevent the gas from entering the house and goes outside to shut it down.  Unfortunately for her, the bride sees her outside and things she's contagious and refuses to let her back in the house. By the time the others notice her and drag her into the house, it's too late.  One by one, they begin to become affected by the gas.  One goes to take a shower only to be killed as the chemicals have entered the water supply and made it acid-like.  There's some made up drama between the bride and the owner of the house having to do with stealing a boyfriend, but you really won't care.  There's a funny scene when one of the affected women breaks a window and lets the gas in.  The two remaining women run to the basement to escape the gas which curiously appears to be chasing them.  You'd think this was John Carpenter's Fog.  Mayhem ensues and an attempt to escape is made. Do any of them survive?  You will be rooting for the gas.  Hell, you'll probably hope the gas gets to you to end this nightmare of a movie.  If you want to see a movie about a chemical spill, go rent the original version of ""The Crazies"".  Even the remake is better than this dreck.",1414454400,,2171,4.288177339901478
6517102,4,B00LZS8YA4,"Was done very well, with a similar reference to the latest installment of the ""Cabin Fever"" .... which was wonderful.  It had all the making of a great horror and ""Right at your front door"" look and feel.  My particularly favorite genre', the type I always hope to locate and relish while watching. Might have been better, with more fleshed out (no pun intended) characters, and a bit more on the gore factor, but it fulfilled my basic need for a tight, scary, little horror gem, with a slightly dark humoresque feel as a bonus.  If you enjoy this type of genre', my take is you won't be disappointed, but if severe horror porn is more your style, you  might feel slighted.",1413936000,3,673,4.491803278688525

The lead actress is good, as well as the girl who plays the character Elise, but the other characters are very poorly acted.  There's no momentum whatsoever to the impotent plot and the ""effects"" are so obvious that they wouldn't even pass for an art film school film project.

Reading the other glowing reviews, I'm struck by how obviously fake they are - the crews' friends and family maybe?

I don't like to post negative opinions about somebody's hard work but I'm compelled by the thought that somebody else might waste their money on this.  There are plenty of other good low-budget horror films that you could watch.  Stay away from this one!",1413763200,3,720,4.72

6517105,3,B00LZS8YA4,"Clearly the 5-star reviews are biased (as this is the only film reviewed by each of them).  That aside, I did watch this film (albeit painful to sit through) and believe the flow of the story would've been best served by editing out about 30 minutes of monotony, specifically coughing and more coughing.....geez.  I found myself bored stiff, hoping against all hope that the whole lot of them would just die already.  There were no scares and not much gore.  Some of the actresses were downright annoying and lacked the skills needed to be in this film (any film).

I recommend that you spend your $$ on a film worthy of your time and money.  Sadly, this ain't it!

6517107,5,B00LZS8YA4,"Call me a freak, but I absolutely love good, gory movies.  I just cant help myself.  The more splatter, the better.  Films like Peter Jacksons DEAD ALIVE or Eli Roths CABIN FEVER are some of my favorite splat-fests.  So when I saw the summary for CHEMICAL PEEL, I knew it was a must-see.  Chemical spills are always a great way to initiate some good gory action.  And let me tell you:  this film does not disappoint!  Chocked full of intensity and plenty of splatter, this horror flick is one you must see!

I am very impressed with how much I enjoyed this film.  It is good on so many levels.  Great acting, intriguing premise, and excellent special effects (i.e. gore).  You just cant ask for much more from a horror film.

CHEMICAL PEEL starts off with a bang and it never lets up.  The tension is in the air from the get go, and its thick enough to feel on your skin.  I love this aspect of the film, as it puts the viewer in the midst of things right off.

The acting is great, with a whole cast of unknowns (to me) giving top-notch performances.  I have to give particular note to Natalie Victoria, who portrays the main character, Rae.  Victoria does a stellar job as the role of the downtrodden heroine, and I hope to see more of her work in the future.  I also have to mention Arielle Brachfeld, who plays Raes sister, Angela.  Brachfeld does such a great job with her role, its almost scary.  She makes Angela into a Grade A bitch.  I can honestly say I have not wanted a character to die so badly in a long time.

The special effects in CHEMICAL PEEL win the blue ribbon here, though.  There are several very nice gore scenes, and they don't leave much to the imagination.  One of my favorites occurs when one of the girls decides to take a shower and wash off some of the muck in the air.  Little does she know that water is a trigger for the chemical reaction.  As a result, the girl melts (literally) in the tub.  This scene is very well done, and it will haunt my memory for a long time!

CHEMICAL PEEL is a big win for me, and fans of horror as well as gore-hounds alike will enjoy this one.  Make sure you watch this on an empty stomach, thougheven if you're not very squeamish, some of these scenes will make you look away.

The pace of the film is perfect with effective visuals, good dialogue and suspenseful build up. None of the acting was bad and that's hard to achieve in a lower budget film.

Poorly written, and just possibly the worst acting I've seen in long time. There was some 'overacting' when emotions seemed not to ""line-up"" or rather just inappropriate for the situation... or worse yet, delayed reactions that where somewhat comical. Ridiculous. It was just so bad that I couldn't force myself to watch it. Rarely are there every movies so bad that I don't even want to keep watching just to find out what happened, how it ended. It felt like a production put on by a bunch of high school kinds, despite the actors (if you can call then that) being young twenty-something. Terrible acting by the whole cast, convoluted and weak plot, at times just plan stupid: characters doing things that make little to no sense, a LOT of over or underacting. Even the lighting in was terrible, often too harsh, or possible just not taken into consideration. The plotline was loose, sloppily thrown together, and even had they been an A-list, all star cast this movie would have been a flop. I could have been more specific if I'd done the review just after my attempt to watch it, or try to re-watch it... but with that said, I won't go through that again. Now, whomever did the preview for this just terrible movie managed to really pull something off, if you know what I mean.
