8520891,5,0977139638,"Cache Girl Saves the World covers all the bases: the format is new and innovative, the photographs and the narrative are beautiful, and the theme is inspiring. Cache Girl follows the story of Ta'li, portrayed by Thirza Defoe, as she attempts to make an understanding dust. The story begins with her as a young runaway, and it follows her as she communicates with nature to make the understanding dust. The photographs fantastically encapsulate each moment, while Stone's words are both lyrical and striking. You will be impressed while watching this novel in visions, by both the story and the story's format, and you will walk away feeling the urge to save the world.",1290384000,,668,4.920353982300885
8520892,4,0977139638,"This dvd is like nothing I've ever seen before. The slow moving images help you get into an almost meditative state to take in the story of Cache Girl. The theme of interconnectedness, the imagery from beautiful S.Illinois & the author's narrative really won me over!
I hope to see more from Adam Stone in the future.",1290211200,,317,4.578947368421052
8520893,5,0977139638,"In a truly original format, Adam Stone takes you on a magical and thought-provoking journey in his ""novel in visions"".

Not quite an audio-book, not quite a film, the DVD offers still photographic images along with the narration, but in its subtlety and pacing, your own imagination can still fill in the spaces.

The collaboration of the various talented people involved in Stone's project mesh to make this cooperative work really come alive.

I'm left with the hope-inspiring message that although you might not be able to make a difference--it is of utmost importance that you try.",1290211200,,585,5.010309278350515
8520894,5,0977139638,"This ""novel in visions"" is a stunning narrative about a young woman's transformational journey to save not only herself, but the natural world and humanity. Ta'li's true nature and mission appear ""hidden"" at first glance when the narrator picks her up in his truck. Stone's narrator is soulful and reflective, as if exploring Ta'li's journey along with her as she becomes aware of her strengths and solidifies her mission to bring understanding and empathy to the world. Both the photographs and music leave impressions of a story beyond the narration. Photographs linger on-screen during the story, adding a unique dimension to the project, as if combining oral tradition with movie stills, inviting the viewer to participate more fully in the creation of imagery. I was already familiar with Thirza Defoe's extraordinary work as a writer, artist, and educator. Her facial  expressions and body gestures propel the story forward. I thoroughly enjoyed listening to Adam Stone's complex and woven storyline as it moved through several visions including contemplations of historical events, social and environmental responsibilities, and global interconnectedness. Sarah Dalby's photographs are phenomenal and evocative of both emotion and spirit. ""Cache Girl Saves the World"" is a remarkable cross-genre experience that is charged with energy and purpose.",1285891200,2,1354,5.572815533980583
8520895,5,0977139638,"As a fan of Adam Stone's previous written work, I was both curious and excited to see what he had in store with this bold new concept:  the video novel (or novel in visions).  Stone's excellent character development skills had always captivated me...in this ""novel in visions,"" Adam provides both pictures and audio to accompany his skill in this area and really nails it.  The pictures are perfectly chosen and beautifully well done, the narration flawless, and the audio quality superb.
Each element could stand on it's own; but Stone's brilliant writing remains at center stage throughout.",1285891200,,592,5.082474226804123
8520896,5,0977139638,"""Cache Girl Saves The World"" is a spiritual journey for both the heroine of the story and the listener.  Beautiful words combined with beautiful pictures and music tell the story of a young woman's journey from abuse to power.  It is a mystical tale that is quite ""other-worldly"", taking the listener into the life and thoughts of someone who sees the reality of this world and decides to take matters into her own hands to try to change it.  I highly recommend this experience for anyone who enjoys tales of  self-realization and actualization.  The spoken word/visual image mode of Cache Girl is a new concept in entertainment and perfectly suited to the story.  Enjoy it!",1285891200,,674,4.817391304347826
