8164167,5,B000JLTS6C,"Second time viewing this movie and I still loved it. A very sweet story of a single mother of a boy and girl who works as a 911 operator. She has a long standing radio dispatch relationship with a fireman she calls Cowboy, to him, she is 23. When her hours are cut she decides to rent her guest room and bath. Meanwhile Cowboy gets hurt after a call out goes bad. His doctor tells him, no stairs. He lives in a 3 flight up apartment. After 23 goes to the hospital to give him a sweet treat,(they had never seen each other in person) he asks her where should he return the container. She gives him a copy of the flyer, with her phone number and address, advertising a need for a roommate. Perfect right? He shows up at her home with a coworker and charms her daughter. The mother agrees to let him have the room. After that, you will just have to watch. This is a very interesting and sweet movie with all kinds of twists. This is a good family movie. Very clean and realistic. Grab the ice cream mom and dad and Enjoy!!!!",1516233600,,1021,4.161616161616162
