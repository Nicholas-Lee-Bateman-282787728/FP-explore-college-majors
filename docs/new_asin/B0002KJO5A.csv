Walden Pond was saved because it had to be. It's a part of American history. Henry David Thoreau is one of the most well-known American authors, poets, writers, and philosophers. He is better known for living simply without frills and fancy things like indoor plumbing. He bathed in the pond where he fished his meals. He was self-reliant, independent, and would loathe us today for making our lives so complicated by being unable to entertain ourselves. We need computers, music, ipods, internet, telephones, televisions, and radio. He didn't need that because he didn't have that but he still became an American original and part of our country's history and culture.
