4252106,5,B0042U9B3Q,"As a journalist, I spent time covering Allen Ginsberg during a tour he made in the early 1980s, a time when he almost seemed to have turned himself into a popular little lawn gnome in American culture. Ginsberg always loved to celebrate and poke fun at himself and the culture that both rejected and eventually enjoyed him. He loved to dance, play his little harmonium as he performed and when I encountered him, he drew a big crowd of university students mostly curious to see the '60s celebrity who had managed to survive.

But Ginsberg, years before Harvey Milk, was a subversive genius and ""Howl"" finally puts the howl back in Ginsberg's work.

I agree with most of the other reviews on the Amazon page, but would stress a few helpful things: First, you get to experience the entire performance of ""Howl"" in the course of this film. That's a rare experience these days. James Franco performs it in scenes that recreate that first explosive reading in San Francisco in 1955. In the Extras, Ginsberg himself reads it. Plus, this is the entire version of ""Howl,"" including the ""Footnote to Howl,"" which I think and most literary scholars think is an essential part of the poem. It's amazing that sometimes ""Howl"" is read or assigned in classes without that Footnote.

The truly subversive choice in ""Howl"" was casting two of the hottest heartthrobs in America as the leading characters. The courageous defense lawyer at the ""Howl"" trial is played by Jon Hamm, better known to millions as Don Draper in the hit ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mad-Men/dp/B000YABIQ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mad Men</a>"" TV series. The defense lawyer Hamm plays in ""Howl""---from his looks to his prophetic message to the court about American values---is almost a twin to the character of Don Draper. Then, to portray Ginsberg, the producers chose Franco. While Franco may not rank with Brad Pitt on tabloid covers, he's certainly hot today. For example, he appears as one of the hunkiest heartthrobs in Julia Roberts' new movie version of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eat-Pray-Love/dp/B0042816YK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eat Pray Love</a>."" Trying to place Franco in ""Eat Pray Love""? He's the knock-em-dead young actor who tells a girlfriend: ""When I look at you, I can hear dolphins clapping."" Obviously, that sappy line wasn't penned by Ginsberg. Watching those two actors at the helm of ""Howl""---that casting choice alone---drives home the film's plea for diversity. Two of the coolest hearthrobs in America right now see the enduring value in what Ginsberg achieved more than half a century ago.

Ginsberg certainly was as much a self-styled clown as a prophet. But, he realized years before many others of his generation that--even from the margins of our society--words are a perpetual source of power. He shouted out this truth at the very end of Howl. Even the language of the Footnote is R-rated, but those final lines should echo on for years to come. The passage includes:
Holy! Holy! Holy! Holy! Holy! Holy!
The world is holy! The soul is holy! The skin is holy!
Everything is holy! everybody's holy! everywhere is holy! everyday is in eternity! Everyman's an angel!
The bum's as holy as the seraphim! the madman is holy as you my soul are holy!
...
Holy forgiveness! mercy! charity! faith! Holy! Ours! bodies! suffering! magnanimity!
Holy the supernatural extra brilliant intelligent kindness of the soul!

This is a great film. And those are great words to remember as the credits roll.",1294358400,10,3567,5.218150087260035
4252107,5,B0042U9B3Q,"HOWL is a well-chosen name for this excellent movie.  Yes, it indeed is a study of the creator of that significant poem - Allen Ginsberg - but the film seems to be more focused on bringing the audience to a level of appreciation of the impact that particular poem had on the world  - of censorship, of bringing to the attention the parameters of varieties of sexuality and emotions, of the so called concept and rise of the Beat Generation - than it  is in portraying the life history of the poet himself.  Writers/directors Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman  have combined archival footage of the real Allen Ginsberg and  moments in the cafs where Howl was read along with very fine animation to relate the grotesque feelings of the poem in a way that enhances our understanding of this important work, and with that they have gathered an exemplary cast of actors to recreate the people that surrounded Ginsberg's life and experience with the courts.

The film begin with the 1957 obscenity trial held for the 1955 creation of the poem Howl: the Judge Clayton Horn (Bob Balaban) hears the prosecutor Ralph McIntosh (David Strathairn) bring testimony from a variety of 'experts' - Gail Potter (Mary-Louise Parker), Professor David Kirk (Jeff Daniels), Luther Nichols (Alessandro Nivola), and Mark Shorer (Treat Williams), and then hears rebuttal from Ginsberg's attorney Jake Ehrlich (Jon Hamm) who is also defending Ginsberg's publisher Lawrence Ferlinghetti (Andrew Rogers).  And while the trial proceeds the audience is taken back to the year of the poem's creation with Allen Ginsberg portrayed with exceptionally fine acting by James Franco.  Ginsberg relates his mother's insanity and the effect of  him, his own hospitalization for insanity, and his coming out with lovers Neal Cassady (Jon Prescott), Jack Kerouac (Todd Rotondi), and  Peter Orlovsky (Aaron Tveit). Each of these actors offer polished portrayals and truly give a sense of the meaning of a counterculture that emerged as a result of Ginsberg's masterpiece poem.

One of the beauties of this film is that it offers the audience  all the information  about this period and this event and this poet with astute brevity (the film lasts only 84 minutes), making the impact all the more personal.  James Franco as Ginsberg, whether reading Howl or responding to an off camera interviewer, is a completely realized performance.  Time will prove what an important film this is.

4252108,5,B0042U9B3Q,"Sure, James Franco gives a terrific performance as Allen Ginsberg, but let's not forget great acting from David Strathairn, Jeff Daniels, Treat Williams and the rest of the standout cast!

The animation was a little weird, but it worked to make the film a bit more interesting. Very surreal.

As usual, the tobacco drug use could and should have been left out. No film needs that.

If ""Howl"" is nominated for several Academy Awards, I wouldn't be surprised!",1293494400,,457,4.833333333333333
4252109,5,B0042U9B3Q,James Franco delivers a wonderful performance as Allen Ginsberg. He is particularly amazing in the interview scenes.  Supported by a great cast and fascinating story.,1290988800,2,166,5.64
4252110,3,B0042U9B3Q,"This is a shorter length feature film in the style of a documentary drama.  Essentially it is Allen Ginsberg (James Franco) telling the story of writing his book of poems 'Howl', and the court case that decided whether or not it was considered obscene material.  The film cuts between interviews with Ginsberg, scenes from his memory, scenes of the court case, and is broken throughout with scenes of his first reading of 'Howl'.  The poetry reading is also interpreted through animation.

James Franco plays Ginsberg very well and at times his imitation of Ginsberg's vocal cadence and delivery are spot on.  He refrains from a caricature of Allen Ginsberg and portrays a real, endearing and human man.  The court scenes can be dry and prime to be over dramatic or cliche.  They serve mostly to show the conservative and censored backdrop on which 'Howl' was published.  The film doesn't have a strict chronology and doesn't need one.  It is generally structured by the beginning and end of the poetry reading and a brief biography of Ginsberg's life.  I thought the animation was aesthetic and interesting and I really liked the piano score that accompanied it.

There are really beautiful moments in this film.  Ginsberg reading the letter of love and rejection from Neal Cassady.  Gingsberg relating his revelation that he would always be loved and that he could live life happily as himself, even as a gay man in the 1950's.  At the end of the film it is touching and almost thrilling as the voice over of a man singing sweetly transitions to footage of the real Allen Ginsberg.

I was inspired to write a poem while watching this film!  It was a very enjoyable and satisfying experience to see 'Howl'.  The best aspect of the film is that it brings to your attention the wisdom and poignancy of Ginsberg's story, and the simple beauty of living honestly and free.",1289779200,15,1869,4.7725856697819315
4252111,4,B0042U9B3Q,"""Howl"" is the story of the obscenity trial surrounding Lawrence Ferlinghetti publishing Allen Ginsburg's Howl. Told from Ginsberg's perspective it isn't formatted like a usual movie, but more like a poem with different alternating stanzas.

The stanzas breakdown into an interview with Ginsberg circa 1957, an animated rendition of Howl, the trial, the Six Gallery reading that brought the beats and Howl to mass public awareness, Ginsberg writing Howl, and his meeting and falling in love with Peter Orlovsky.

James Franco plays Ginsberg and while not a nuanced or fiery performance you do get the feeling of what it would be like at the time of the obscenity trial to sit down with Ginsberg and talk about Howl, from how it got started to what it meant to him to write it, and the literary merits of it.

The stanzas mesh seamlessly, and intricately. For instance, the animated Howl that is interspersed with the live action works very well on its own but also in the context of the movie. If you're not familiar with the poem it provides a reference point as to what the controversy was in the first place. The trial scenes with Jon Hamm as Ferlinghetti's defense lawyer, and David Strathairn as the prosecutor provide comic relief, especially more so because the dialog was taken right from the trial transcripts. If obscenity trials are good for anything it's getting straitlaced attorneys to say things that in a different context would be considered obscene.

The movie also doesn't avoid or ignore Ginsberg's homosexuality. As a matter of fact, it's an intricate part of the movie since Howl was Ginsberg's first flash of accepting that within himself as being a part of himself, and normal.

All the performances in ""Howl"" are good. Everyone delivers even if they aren't asked to do much except ""be"" the characters they`re supposed to be. Most of the attention is focused on Franco as Ginsberg and he proves that there's more to his acting than what's seen in franchise movies such as ""Spiderman.""",1285977600,22,2007,4.891176470588236
4252112,4,B0042U9B3Q,"Needless to say this little cinematic effort to put the sense of Allen Ginsberg's seminal modernist poem, Howl, on the screen is more than welcome. As I have repeatedly emphasized on previous occasions any poem that starts of like this one is going to get my attention and keep it every time. I would have given a lot, if only I had been old enough, to be in that gallery seated next to Jack Keroauc in that beat, heat San Francisco night to hear this start:

""I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked, dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn, looking for an angry fix, angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night . . .''

I have also of late made note of the influence of the ""beats"" in my own youthful political and social development in reviewing books and films about Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, Neal Cassady and the gang. A prima facie case can be made by me, and has recently in this space, that Ginsberg's Howl is his search for the blue-pink great American West night that animated my youth, and the youth of my generation of the 1960s.  Who would have thought that a poem (and the legal tangle involved in its publication and distribution), with help from an excellent cast starting with James Franco, could carry a whole film. Kudos.",1285977600,9,1372,4.637860082304527
4252113,4,B0042U9B3Q,"Put together an impressive all-star cast with the writer/director team responsible for ""The Times of Harvey Milk"" and ""The Celluloid Closet,"" and you have an excellent effort in ""Howl,"" a biographical drama centered on the obscenity trial of the landmark poem by Allen Ginsberg.

Much as Sean Penn became ""Milk"" in that biopic, James Franco captures the personality and spirit of the talented poet.  The film interleaves scenes of the 1957 obscenity trial (The defendant was the publisher of the book, not Ginsberg himself), with snippets of the openly-gay Ginsberg's life and loves, some public readings of his works, as well as an ongoing interview he is taping. The film also includes incredible animation that brings the poem to life on the screen.

Already acclaimed at Sundance and the Berlin festivals, this is certain to get some attention at Oscar time, likely for Franco's performance and the previously mentioned animation. True disclosure time:  I am not a fan of Ginsberg's work, or poetry at all, and was expecting this to be a snoozer.  The animation made it much more enjoyable for me and likely will do the same for other viewers.  Still, I'd recommend this film primarily to those who are fans of Ginsberg's or fancy themselves as an honorary member of the ""beat generation"" which he championed.",1285718400,8,1313,5.0

4252117,5,B0042U9B3Q,Definitely an art film.  James Franco as Ginsburg and he does it really well.  Animations accompany a lot of the poetry and the film gives you some good insight into that period and I think what Ginsburg was about.,1460505600,,214,4.461538461538462

4252119,5,B0042U9B3Q,"Very good, in my opinion.  I loaned it to a friend and he wanted to keep it for a few days so he could watch it twice.  I was thinking about how the prosecution in the courtroom had such a hard time ""getting"" the poetic style of Howl.  Later I remembered my first reaction hearing Patti Smith's song Horses for the first time on the radio.  It was 1986 or 7 and I was driving , listening to Brave New Waves from a Canadian station, when the song came on.  Her delivery was much like Franco's in this movie.  I stopped the car and turned the song up to listen.  Although I'd read that the early NY punks were influenced by the Beats,  I'd never heard Beat poetry at the time.  ""Horses"" is closer to Burroughs' Naked Lunch than Howl yet still similar.  I had a strong reaction to the vocal delivery and my curiosity was was triggered  30 years after Howl was published.  The reactions in the 50's would have been even stronger.

 The animation, acting, story, and Ginsberg's self reflection make it one of my favorite movies.  I'm glad I watched it.",1459296000,3,1047,4.324742268041237

Maybe I just don't like animation, but this movie had much greater potential which was I feel was lost in the pursuit of a ""greater creativity"" perspective which seems to be the case with more movies emulating multiple primary plots with many subplots which is not so much creative as greater diversionary tactics to make you feel it was a very complex story.  This was my observation of the movie ""Cloud Atlas"" which simply jumped from story to story back and forth and is a presentation concept which actually attempts to boggle the mind and cheats the consumer - I do not appreciate this.

I quickly worked out that I had to listen to the poem as though it were music, and allow my subconcious to take in the words and make of them what it willed.  The animation of the poem was excellent, but obviously not definitive.  Many other drawings could have done just as well if not better, but what was used was good and acceptable.

Ginzburg's homosexuality takes a prominent place in the movie, and it may well be that the poem was motivated by the social exclusion he felt because of his homosexuality.  If that is the case then his poem worked as therapy for him in accepting himself.  In fact, the poem's message is to ""be yourself"".

4252187,5,B0042U9B3Q,"I'm glad this movie brought several subjects within reach of the average person who may not of heard of Ginsberg; how deeply a man can care for and express his feelings for another, the seemingly reasonable but fear based groundless perspectives used to oppress other people they don't understand, society's expectation of conformity above true and natural individual expression in much of American culture (at least at the time), and what practically the whole country used to do to gay folks if they caught them (an entire movie needs to be done on that point alone).

I have watched this movie several times and own a copy.
Unless people understand the loneliness and weariness of being constantly in a sea of those who were taught to fear, hate, harm, or kill you, you will likely find this movie boring and of ""no merit"". To such people I say; Apply yourself as though you respected the subjects and the kinds of people portrayed who endured injustice (to put it mildly) and put yourself in their place for at least 5 min in the various situations portrayed, and realize what's missing in your perspective and how good you've got it by comparison.

I've been reading complaints here about this movie.
The movie ain't perfect but it opens up humane and sorely needed subjects most people seem ignorant about, whether you're gay or not, if only to learn from history about a cultures' entrenched inhumanity and enforced sexuality.  Also, it's easy to make ugly accusations about Ginsberg himself. Quite another to back them up in a valid way.

4252252,4,B0042U9B3Q,"I am giving this four stars because it is a movie based on Allen Ginsberg.  I met Ginsberg three times in my life.  The first time I heard his poem was at the University of Georgia.  He read Howl.  He spoke in a jerky, yet lyrical quality that mimicked jazz.  He used bongo drums to punctuate the rhythm.  James Franco is no Allen Ginsberg.  His rendition of the iconic poem was juvenile and not very well researched.  I believe that Ginsberg would have been flattered that Franco portrayed him but personally, I would have preferred an actor that was more gruff and understood how to perform poetry.
The entire movie is the poem Howl read by Franco within various art venues that have various Beat artists in the audience.  Interspersed within the readings are interviews with Franco as Ginsberg and expert witnesses who testified during the obscenity trial for the book Howl and other stories.  Animations and archival footage fill in visually for the reading of the poem by Franco.
The trial and interview gave more insight into the poem Howl, and why the poem is still significant 60 years after it was written. I especially enjoyed the style compared to Whitman's Leaves of Grass in the trial and the explanation of theme by one of the expert witnesses.
At the end credits the poem sung/read is done by Ginsberg.
Anyone who is interested in the Beat poets, anyone assigned Howl for required reading, anyone who does not understand what poetry is or why people like to go to poetry readings should check this movie out.  It is not a perfect movie, but it was a valiant effort that I can only hope will one day be remade with an actor who can bring the energy of the poem to life.",1419897600,,1683,4.558139534883721

James Franco does a masterful turn as the young Allen Ginsberg, nailing his voice, and mannerisms as if Ginsberg snuck in there. My opinion is that HOWL is the most important poem of the 20th century, and so far, the most important of the 21st. I'm chuckling here - HOWL is the Moby Dick of poetry, and this movie is as good an exposition as imaginable, using animation, archival footage, and recreated scenes with every line either from the poem, the obscenity trial transcript, or interviews.

Franco's characterization isn't particularly appealing, although it may be accurate, and Ginsberg seems both puerile and stuffy, a contradiction rarely to be found in other films. I don't know if this film proves that it's impossible to do a film about a poem (many have tried, sometimes with reasonable success, to film the Odyssey and the Iliad), but it does seem to show that even the most extreme efforts can make the famous Alan Ginsberg boring.",1419638400,,759,5.129032258064516

The fact is that Ginsberg's work was inextricably linked to his sexual attraction to and pursuit of underage boys and that, aside from one poem, he was a mediocre writer. This film glorifies Ginsberg, as expected, particulary given that Franco - who is undeniably one of the ""hippest"" actors working today - further makes is inherently uncool to say anything bad about this quasi-biographical film and its subject.
Nonetheless, the film - on its own merits - is, while decently acted, simply uninteresting and unremarkable. I know this goes against the grain of the flood of four and five star reviews, which were expected no matter how good or bad the film itself turned out, but having rented this one and watched it all the way through, I was disappointed, even setting aside Ginsberg's open and active defense of pedophila (which was, of course, little discussed in the film - also, as expected).",1419638400,6,1208,4.868932038834951

No evidence of appreciation for the greater society, but only a constant attack on it by losers.u

4252315,5,B0042U9B3Q,"This is a film about a poem, a very famous poem. It is an ambitious film since it must relate the poem, give the context of the poem, portray the biography of the poet, and use the obscenity trail around this poem to highlight its features and to acquaint the viewer with the significance of the finding of the court in that obscenity trial. Does this sound overly ambitious and complex? Well yes, but this is a fairly complex poem, expressing the counter-culture movement of the late 1950s and early 1960s. It is a poem, inspired by Walt Whitmans Leaves of Grass, that celebrates the life forces pushing against the constraints of social demands and conformity. Well how do the directors convey all of this?  In this film they use several techniques, all of which added together conveyed a powerful story. Allen Ginsberg, the poet, gives an interview to an unseen person and during that interview the viewer sees, in black and white, much of the personal context of the film. These black and white segments include a dramatic reading of the poem by Ginsberg in a nightclub and this reading of the poem is enhanced by animation depicting key passages of the poem. These scenes are integrated with scenes from the obscenity trial around the publishing and sale of this poem in book form, which allows the directors to convey a commentary of the strengths and challenges that surround this poem. I would not say that this film is a general audience film. It is a film for a specific audience of persons who would appreciate the creativity, the freedom, the sexual liberation, and the joy of life that are features of this long four part poem. I came away from the film with a much more enhanced understanding of how the beat culture of the 1950s was the foundations upon which the free love culture of the 1970s and the gay liberation movement of the 1980s were built. I also came away from the film with more understanding of Ginsbergs ground breaking efforts to reflect the youth culture in which he lived and loved.

4252318,4,B0042U9B3Q,"Inspired by the Allan Ginsberg poem of the same name, HOWL shows the eponymous hero (James Franco) reading the work out lout to a group of fellow-poets in San Francisco.  The work obviously inspired extreme passions: the audience listen in rapt attention to a work that depicts the poet's feelings through an earthy yet compelling idiom.  In an attempt to show how the poem might work, directors Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman introduce a series of animated sequences; none of them try to 'explain' the work, but rather show how Ginsberg's language works associatively, inspiring moods rather than following any logical sequence.  When the work was first published in the mid-Fifities, it was the subject of a famous obscenity trial: Epstein and Friedman restage that trial, showing how the poem was criticized for its apparent earthiness of language, and then cleared on the grounds that Ginsberg was only following the principle of free speech.  HOWL is an enthralling piece, encouraging viewers not to 'understand' the significance of the poem in terms of meaning, but to see it as symptomatic of a particular moment in American history, when old taboos and/or standards of moral or civilized behavior were subject to intense scrutiny.  The conservatism of the early Fifties had been superseded by a new spirit of adventure, encapsulated in Ginsberg's work, that looked forward to the spirit of the Sixties.  James Franco offers a convincing characterization of Ginsberg, supported by memorable cameos from David Strathairn, Jon Hamm, and Bob Balaban as the main protagonists in the court case.",1391731200,,1599,5.202334630350195

I enjoyed the blending of the censorship trial in to the mix, again it set the poem into its time period.  I know some people loved the animation and while I thought it was well done I really do feel it detracted from the movie as a work.  In a way it was too much like one of those Bollywood movies in which in the midst of a dramatic scene the characters suddenly break out into a song and dance routine.  The song and dance routine is great but it just clashes with the drama.  It feels like it was added in to the movie to make it a bit longer when in fact the back and forth between the Ginsberg's recitation, the interview and the trial could have been expanded just a bit and in addition would have matched the tripartite form of the actual poem.

But lest you think I did not like the film, I did.  If you have any interest in the characters of the ""Beat Generation"" as Herb Caen named them way back when, then this is good movie to view.",1390953600,,1033,4.084158415841584

James Franco does a really terrific job of a young Ginsberg. The directors have nicely interwoven the famous first performance of the poem itself in a NYC club against the trial, the interview after he has achieved a measure of infamy and the snippets of 1960's life through clips and animation.",1385078400,,570,4.71
4252322,3,B0042U9B3Q,"HOWL is definately a film for a certain acquired taste.

Aspiring to be authentic to the tone and mood of much of the poetry of the BEAT generation, the film is long, and has a dry, montotone delivery. The non-linear film has a poetic feel as it seems to move at a pace and the rhythm that is in synch with Ginsberg's paradigm-changing poem.

James Franco is Allen Ginsberg with nervous passion that is bold and amused at his own bravado and wit. His portrays Ginsberg to be an  unorthodox thinker who is uncomfortable with the time he lives in. The film does not shy away from depicting Ginsberg's sexually charged friendships with Jack Kerouac (Todd Rotondi) and Neal Cassady (Jon Prescott), and his union with Peter Orlovsky (Aaron Tveit).

HOWL is an exercise in literary criticism on film. Academics and critics show up in the courtroom drama with Jon Hamm and David Strathairn arguing to defend or discredit the frank discussion of drugs and homosexuality, blasphemous in apocalyptic visions expressed in ""Howl"". Mr. Strathairn's prosecutor confesses that he can't understand what ""Howl"" is about, and the film does not dumb its material down to be more digestable to the taste of an audience that may not be into this form of prose.",1382572800,,1239,4.802816901408451

Initially, I found the direction style rather annoying (Neo-surrealist artwork interwoven with action shots, and then Franco's non-stop monotonous reading of Howl throughout/as a background to the plot), not to mention the frequent time jumping from past to future to present. But, once you get used to it, the result is really a pretty fine piece of film work. Franco, of course, is superb, and in particular John Hamm and David Strathairn provide a Scopes-trial-like bit of acting that really shows their dramatic chops. And, here's a great chance to see the upcoming rise to fame of Aaron Tveit. A really good watch, especially if you appreciate the art behind filmmaking. If you have ever seen the Salvador Dali / Disney collaboration ""Destino,"" this film is very reminiscent of that. I tip my hat to the producers who had the brass to put this together; a good watch for those wanting to develop a little appreciation of post-WWII cultural change in America.  (As long as I mention Strathairn, be sure and check him out in his Oscar-nominated performance in ""Good Night and Good Luck,"" as it bears similar sentiments to Howl, though they are admittedly different genres.)",1378771200,,1352,4.878260869565217

4252330,4,B0042U9B3Q,"HOWL is a movie that primarily revolves around an obscenity trial in 1957 concerning the beat poetry of Allen Ginsberg who defied the conventionalism and established mores of the time to become one of the most touted poets of the 20th century. Like his poetry, this movie will not be to everyone's taste. The language and the way it was employed by Ginsberg is certainly not nearly as jarring (if at all) to an early 21st century audience as it was to a mid-1950s one.

The poetry aside, what was so important about Ginsberg's trial was what should and should not be considered obscene. The outcome was possibly as significant as the earlier Scopes Monkey trial of 30+ years earlier. What constitutes ""free speech"" in a free society? - a question that is still hauntingly relevant today. The old adage: ""What is one man's meat is another man's poison"" is applicable. What is one person's obscenity maybe another one's pleasure. You don't have to like or even understand Ginsberg's poetry but you have to allow its right to exist.

James Franco channels Ginsberg to considerable effect. However, the real stars of the film are those who participate in the trial as judge, prosecutor, defender, or witness.  All the actors who portray these particular roles are outstanding, from Bob Balaban's judge, John Hamm's defence lawyer, David Strathairn as prosecutor, and Jeff Daniels, Treat Williams, and Mary-Louise Parker as witnesses.
Aaron Tveit (currently of GRACELAND) plays Ginsberg's lifetime partner in a brief and non-speaking role.

The film combines actual footage and dialogue, with its reenactment counterparts, along with striking
and overt animation (perhaps the best part of the movie). In the end, HOWL basically channels its literary namesake and gives us a key slice of Americana (pro and con) in the mid and late 1950s. The reaction to Ginsberg's poetry could easily find its counterpart in the contemporary reaction to the abstract art of the time. The latter was never put on trial for obscenity though many an obscenity was hurled at it. And who today wouldn't wish to own a Jackson Pollock, et al.?

Neither the poetry nor this movie will be everyone's ""cup of tea"" but it is worthwile to see in order to better understand the workings and attitudes of our own society and as a mirror of ourselves. My only negative criticism has to do with how the film was put together. It conveys a somewhat disjointed and confusing story by the way it moves back and forth in time, shifts from black & white to color and back, and from live action to animation and back. Other than that, I highly recommend the movie for what it is.",1371168000,3,2636,4.835920177383592
4252331,5,B0042U9B3Q,"I have never seen a movie like this one. Any work of art that is all about giving praise to another work of art and that deeply explores the process of its creation is, to say the least, rare.  Moreover, to succeed, as HOWL does, in becoming a fully formed act of creation itself -- well, I'm amazed they pulled it off.  I usually don't like films that bend the boundaries of documentary and dramatic/fictional movie-making (unless they're mockumentaries).  But the directors, actors, writers -- the whole team -- manged to walk that tightrope with grace and wit. Franco is great as Ginsberg. He nailed Ginsberg's speech patterns which, considering he was our greatest spoken word poet for many years, is central to the character.  Many important characters -- Peter Orlovsky, played beautifully by Aaron Tveit, for example -- have no dialogue. Yet, their impact is clear.  The filmmakers took a huge risk in further genre-hopping by including animated sequences designed by the artist (often in the New Yorker) Eric Drooker, who also did a graphic book project with Ginsberg. The risk paid off in a huge way The animate images bring a hallucinatory intensity to the screen that supports the narrative and illuminates Ginsberg's vision.

4252332,5,B0042U9B3Q,"Allen Ginsberg's 'Howl' is here to stay as part of the canon of great poetry, even if it becomes the only one the poet will be remembered by in the future, & the film Howl does an excellent job of showing why. A retelling of the history of a counter-cultural poem's dramatic effect on censorship over 50 years ago, the film keeps that drama in check, appropriately refining it to give us insight into an event that resonated loudly with those who recognised that it mattered in the contexts of both freedom of expression & literary aesthetics, while meaning little or nothing to those who weren't interested. In the main, the same goes for the film. Admirers of Ginsberg's poem & historical achievement will probably get the most immediate pleasure from it.
However, this doesn't limit its appeal. This film also deserves to attract anyone who is aware of James Franco's trajectory as one of the most interesting & watchable actors around. Most roles he chooses have depth, often because he brings that depth to them, & he refuses to allow himself to become typecast. What type would that be, anyway? Like the real-life characters he's played - Ginsberg, Hart Crane, Aron Ralston & James Dean among others - he's a charismatic original. Even Harry Olston in the Spiderman films transcends the stereotypical 'is he a goodie or baddie?' pulp comic figure, in Franco's portrayal becoming someone whose motives we care about & a recipient of our compassion.
The aspect of the film Howl that lifts it out of the celluloid biography genre altogether is the fabulous visual interpretation of the poem itself. Anyone who appreciates fine animation will find it unforgettable. Although I knew of the historical significance of Ginsberg's poem before seeing the film, I didn't know the poem itself. The film Howl has been a marvelous introduction to it, fulfilling my hopes that it would be, & being a fine entertainment into the bargain.

4252340,3,B0042U9B3Q,"The actual poem HOWL by Allen Ginsberg is a genuine work of art.  James Franco's portrayal of Allen Ginsberg is a genuine work of art. Even the slipcase for this DVD is a genuine work of art.

Unfortunately, the film is nowheres near to being a genuine work of art.  If a viewer knew absolutely nothing about Ginsberg or Kerouac or Neal Cassady or the Beat Generation or the repressive climate of the '50s or a whole host of other matters vital to what HOWL - both the poem and the movie - is about, they would leave this film just a tiny tad more knowledgeable than before having seen it. And to those who do know much about the topics at hand, the feeling might be more one of loss for all of the missing ingredients to what makes the story of HOWL and its times so trenchant for today.

Whilst the poem ""Howl"" is being read beautifully by Franco as Ginsberg in voice-over, the long and silly cartoon sequences only serve to distract from the poem's text.  For one thing, the cartoons are much too modern and slick.  Even if one argues that they are supposed to be modern so that the visionary nature of the poem can be further emphasized, the truth is the cartoon clashes with the climate of the times to the detriment of the live action sequences. Worse, the cartoon vies for artistic predominance - and given that our world today is much more visual than literary, the cartoon more than likely wins attention the majority of times.  What would have worked better as visuals for the reading of the poem, would have been actual newsreel footage of the time, even if simulated.

But no matter what was used as visual aid to the poem, the movie itself is primarily surface.  Giants such as Kerouac and Cassady come and go in the blink of an eye - and Lawrence Ferlinghetti, the man who published HOWL and was taken to trial for it - just sits in the courtroom without any illuminative back-story whatsoever.  One of the segments of the ""Making of HOWL"" documentary tells the story of the publication and the trial much better than the main event.  The courtroom drama in this film is minimalist.  Sticking too closely to actual trial transcripts, the full import and impact of the trial in American history is lost on the viewer.  The film actually needed a scriptwriter to evoke and imagine what isn't strictly on the record.  Show us Ferlinghetti publishing the poem and getting arrested for it.  Show us Ginsberg's reactions to the trial, both before and after verdict. Show us more of what the Beat Generation was really like.  And, in the epilogue, don't be willfully mysterious about how Neal Cassady actually died.  Much more is known about his end than is hinted at in the closing caption over his photograph.

The Beat Generation is a fascinating period in history. HOWL, sadly, is a miss in capturing its ultimate essence.  Now I can hardly wait to see the soon-to-be-released ON THE ROAD!  Let us hope this one is...on-the-money.",1348185600,4,2941,4.576335877862595

The only part that doesn't work - and fails miserably - are the animated sequences that attempt to visualize ""Howl,"" which come across as a clumsy and overly literal gross on the text.

Howl and William Burroughs' ""Naked Lunch"" both went on obscenity trials. Both trials did more for the works than the author's own words.

more than a cursory knowledge about. He did lead a very interesting life though,
and yes, I would call his work revolutionary.
This film takes place during his indecency trial (Yes, they actually took him to court over it!),
regarding the controversy around his career-defining 4-part poem...""HOWL"", which shook up the
establishment of 1950's America pretty good! (-:
(I just love people who upset the established order of things!)
During the course of this trial, James Franco, musing as Ginsberg, recants the story
of his life up until that point. Franco really INHABITS young Allen Ginsberg in this!
It's very impressive and completely haunting to see.
The film maker uses multiple mediums; color, black and white, animation,
interesting editing, etc., to co-sign along with the acting performances, and Franco's narrative,
enhancing the viewing experience even further.
James Franco has really established himself in modern times, as an actor of amazing range,
depth, and versatility....and, may I also add, fearlessness to that equasion as well.
There is nothing that this guy can't do, and do well, it seems!
I have a lot of his more popular works, as well as many of his indie performances.

of the writers and producers of that show than anything! (-:

It is a work of mystery and passion, compelling and beguiling in its intensity and hidden history. This film lifts some of the veil, and presents the poem in its historical and personal contexts, alternating between four settings - Ginsberg (as dramatized by actor James Franco) creating his poem at home and reading it in a fabled '50s Beat gathering; Ginsberg speaking to an interviewer in 1957, as the poem was put on trial in a San Francisco courtroom; the courtroom where an all-star cast digs with glee into their roles -- prosecutor, defender, experts and judge; and finally in a series of animated sequences based on the works of cartoonist Eric Drooker.

The context is welcome: Ginsberg always presented himself as a profoundly human figure, but having some of the signposts of his life made plain greatly enhances one's appreciation of a poem that may have seemed fully formed from the head of postwar America - the personal meaning of the poem, as opposed to its political and literary meaning, is illuminating.

There is no dialog, only Allen's (James Franco's) voiceover.

(2) In b&w. In a narrow brick-walled venue, Allen reads aloud his breakthru long poem to a small clustered rapt audience. Even with his stentorian no-acting-future delivery, his rhythmic patterns, we realize, come naturally to him, the sign of a poet-born. When he introduces ""Moloch,"" there's a noticeable slip into over-dramatization. In the course of the film, the whole poem is read, even the so-called Footnote sequence.

One just KNOWS this Fantasia outtake never unreeled in Allen's mind.

(4) In color. At the obscenity trial, Allen is absent, for publisher Lawrence Ferlinghetti is the accused. In this ""landmark"" proceeding, neither the prosecutor (David Strathairn) nor the defense lawyer (John Hamm) has much on the ball; the same may be said of the ""expert"" witnesses. Undoubtedly as directed, all restrict themselves to ho-hum delivery. (Well, how can anyone rev up in 1957 for that legal rarity: an Obscenity Trial! I'm sure Lady Chatterley's was much better.)

(5) In color. In some later year, Allen is interviewed in his unspecial apartment by a man who remains off-camera. Allen recalls, in lackadaisical voice, the process of writing Howl. (Frankly, I found much of the speaking in this film to be so limp, with swallowed syllables, that I turned on the English subtitles.)

This ""different"" film production leaves me indifferent. Blame it on co-writers and co-directors Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman. There are five Special Features, but I attended only to ""The Making of...""",1295654400,3,2337,5.237967914438503
4252362,5,B0042U9B3Q,"Never boring, ""Howl"" intersperses a famous obscenity trial with a discussion of the nature of literature, readings, interviews with Franco as Ginsberg, and incredible computer animations of the poem's lines.  The movie manages to be visually rich throughout, while articulately dealing with ideas!

One of the ""expert"" witnesses in the trial is a pompous professor who prides herself on rewriting ""Faust.""  And later a bigoted lawyer asks an English Professor from California to explain the meaning of some obscure lines from Howl. The professor replies, ""Sir, you can't translate poetry into prose.  That is why it is called poetry.""

The ways that the editing and  transitions express multiple layers of meaning are breathtaking.  While the bio and court scenes are definitely engaging, the sophisticated animation illustrating Ginsberg's words (and this is the best use of animation I have ever seen) supports the words in a way that is a synthesis of both.

There are few movies that make such an incredible use of the cinema than 'Howl.""  This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.",1295308800,2,1092,5.089887640449438
4252363,3,B0042U9B3Q,"I admit upfront that I am not a fan of Ginsberg's work.  I've read numerous books both by and about him and the other ""Beat"" writers, and have always thought they were the literary equivalent of Jackson Pollack and the modern painters championed by the likes of Frank O'Hara; artists who belong to the ""Emperor's New Clothes"" School, whose art is all too often much ado about nothing.

  Co-writer/directors Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman are Oscar winning documentary filmmakers, and perhaps that has gotten in their way.  One could easily imagine a brilliant satire based on the actual testimony of the obscenity trials surrounding the publication and distribution of Ginsberg's slim poetry collection ""Howl""; instead what we get is lots of cross cutting back and forth between courtroom scenes, simulated interviews, poetry readings, and flashbacks from Ginsberg's life and relationships with Jack Kerouac, Neal Cassidy and longtime companion Peter Orlovksy.  As a result ""Howl"" lacks dramatic tension and suspense; even the verdict's rendering, which should be the film's crowd pleasing climax, is rather devoid of passion.

  This is by no means a wholly negative review, for the subject matter alone commands our interest and many of the film's component parts are exceptional, especially the cinematography of Edward Lachman, the film editing of Jake Pushinsky and the truly inspired and often stunning animation of Eric Drooker (based largely on his equally brilliant illustrations for Ginsberg's ""Illuminated Poems"").  Epstein and Friedman have adroitly populated their film with great character actors like Bob Balaban, David Strathairn, Treat Williams, Mary Louise Parker and Jeff Daniels, who deliver sterling performances in roles that range from small to mere cameos.  As Ginsberg, James Franco does a fine job of reproducing the poet's look, speech patterns and mannerisms; and yet the film doesn't truly present him with an opportunity to bring the character alive emotionally.

  This is rich material.  However, this viewer felt as though the filmmaker's settled for golden nuggets when El Dorado was within their reach.  Whether you call this film a docudrama or simply a curio, what is ironic is that, like Ginsberg's poem, I respect it more than I liked it.",1295136000,3,2280,5.326815642458101
8413958,4,B0042U9B3Q,This movie is really centered around about the poem Howl rather than the people. It has a documentary style with different sections. We get a good sense about Ginsberg and his inspirations for Howl. James Franco as Ginsberg is very likable and carries the movie with a subtle performance. The courtroom scenes were interesting to watch. The animation on the other hand is not very good and its the movies biggest flaw.,1522540800,,418,4.819444444444445
8413959,4,B0042U9B3Q,"James Franco played American Jewish beat poet, Allen Ginsberg (1927 to 1997) in this biography drama about his life with an interview and the obscenity trial in California. The film was shot largely in New York City even the San Francisco apartment and courtroom scenes. This independent film is also a love story between Allen Ginsberg and Peter Orlovsky who were life partners until Allen's death in 1997. Peter died in 2010 and he is interviewed in the special features.

For those of us who aren't into poetry of any kind, the film might not appeal to your tastes. The movie has the courtroom scenes; Allen being interviewed; Allen reading ""Howl"" at a club; Allen's relationship with Peter and his work as a poet in the East Village during the golden period of artistry and life. The 90 minutes film also starred Jon Hamm; David Straitharn; Mary Louise Wilson; Jeff Daniels; Bob Balaban; and others. The film is rich with visuals in color; black and white and animation. I loved the special feature where they go to San Francisco, California and visit City Light Bookstore and interview Lawrence Ferlinghetti, the bookseller and publisher.

If you are a literary fan and enthusiast especially about Allen Ginsberg, you will definitely enjoy the film and the special features including interviews with Lawrence Ferlinghetti; Al Benedich; Peter Orlovsky; and others.",1520294400,,1368,5.048672566371682
