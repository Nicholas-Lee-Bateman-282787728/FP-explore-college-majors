8210313,5,B000TQBF72,"This was a series of six vignettes that were in essence self-contained spooky paranormal events.

The series was commissioned by ATV (part of the ITV network) and the writer was Nigel Kneale of Quatermass fame. Kneale has been called ""one of the most influential writers of the 20th century,"" his speculative chiller fiction rated as some of best written, and his concepts were always very original. The show initially aired on Saturday nights in 1976. Each episode was a different character-based tale of horror and the ghoulish. For me the teleplays all had an insignificant feel to them, with the stories taking place in ordinary locations such as a farm house, a supermarket or a front room. Therefore, making the resulting ending and with its macabre theme - even more poignant when it is revealed.

One of teleplays that had a profound impact on me, as a youth, was ""Buddyboy"" It featured a rather young Martin Shaw. The setting was primarily around a derelict aquarium haunted by the life-force of a deceased dolphin. The one common thread that linked each show was the theme of an animal. One or two of the episodes may seem dated by today's viewing audience, never the less this a good series that is really worth watching.",1410912000,,1232,4.806603773584905
