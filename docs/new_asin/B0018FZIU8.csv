8364831,1,B0018FZIU8,Hatsumi and Hayes are both from questionable lineage and are not considered trustworthy in portrayi g truth about the ancient Shinoobi. Beware anyone claiming to know true shinobi-no-jutsu (ninutsu) and says its a martial art. It is not a martial art. Dont e2aste money on frauds.,1514937600,,280,5.108695652173913
8364832,5,B0018FZIU8,Excellent documentary.  Well researched and well presented.,1473552000,,59,7.428571428571429
8364833,5,B0018FZIU8,"This is an excellent historical documentary about the Shinobi (aka Ninja). This is not a hokey mall Ninja joke but a high quality full length film about this mysterious warrior cult. Anyone interested about the history of Ninpo, Ninjutsu, Bujinkan, and Jinenkan will find this a very interesting DVD. Also this is not an instructional DVD but strictly a documentary. This DVD listed is the original single DVD disk release, the director re-released a two disk directors cut titled ""Shinobi - Winds of the 34 Generations (Limited Jitsuden Edition)"" that is essentially makes corrections to various historical mistakes put into the first release and adds numerous extended scenes with more detailed information. Highly recommend it to the martial arts practitioner and military historian or anyone wanting to understand the truth behind this misunderstood warrior class of feudal Japan.",1295913600,7,884,5.413043478260869
8364834,4,B0018FZIU8,"This is a must have in the DVD library of those interested in ninjutsu/Bujinkan/Jinenkan/etc. The production was really good & they put a lot of effort into interviewing a lot of the top names in the art. The DVD is a documentary, not a how-to video.",1230681600,4,250,4.456521739130435
