Couldn't remember the title of the movie, but finally input a good combination of words in a google search and found a site with the top cult classic movies from the 70's.  When I saw this title, I knew that I had finally found it!
This is one of the best ""Drive-In"" horror classics that I remember from when I was a kid.",1394236800,,376,4.0675675675675675
1347697,3,B00004SPFH,"This is about an insane Dr. who was in a car accident with his daughter leaving her blind.  He performs many eye transplants in the hope that his daughter might once again see, even against her wishes.

The vhs transfer to dvd is poor adding to the dreamy, creepy feel of the film.  I won't give away any key elements here but the film is disturbing and at times stomach turning.  If you are squeamish at all you'll want to avoid this.
The film is hard to shake.  After I saw it I thought about it for a couple of days.  It leaves an aftertaste.  I found myself wincing while watching it too.

I love good horror and this would not qualify however, if you are searching for something truly different and creepy then this will satisfy your quench.  Be forewarned though-it is nauseating.",1300579200,4,786,4.402777777777778
1347698,1,B00004SPFH,"Mansion of the Doomed (Michael Pataki, 1976)

Mansion of the Doomed is a truly, truly awful film, a remake/ripoff of Les Yeux Sans Visage without any of that film's style or atmosphere (Pataki directed only two films in the midst of his long and distinguished acting career; the other was the 1977 softcore musical Cinderella. Interestingly, writer Frank Ray Perilli, who is best remembered now for being the guy who bet John Sayles he couldn't write a full screenplay on a plane trip from LA to New York City; the result, of course, was Alligator). It would have faded into obscurity years ago were it not for two small details. One is that the film was produced by Albert and Charles Band, whose names will be instantly familiar to bad movie fans (Charles Band would go on to form Full Moon Entertainment). The other is that the film contains the third screen appearance of an actor who will also be very familiar to bad movie fans: Lance Henriksen.

As I intimated in the first paragraph, the plot should sound familiar if you've seen a certain better-known French flick of the fifties. A doctor (Richard Basehart) is trying to perfect a radical eye transplant procedure in order to save the sight of his daughter (Trish Stewart, a TV actress who never appeared in another feature film). This requires the procurement of experimental subjects. As his daughter's eyesight worsens, the doctor gets more and more desperate. (Henriksen plays a young intern assisting the doctor and enamored of the daughter.)

I will admit right up front that I thought Les Yeux Sans Visage was one of the most overrated films I'd ever seen, and I'm willing to allow that it's entirely possible that someone who liked that movie a lot more will like this one a lot more than I did as well. As that was considered extreme for its time, this was as well, but where Les Yeux Sans Visage shows mastery of pacing and some really good acting, this shows nothing but a flick churned out to make a quick buck. (This has become one of the hallmarks of Full Moon.) Worth seeing only for Henriksen's small part. *",1245974400,,2084,4.657608695652174
1347699,3,B00004SPFH,"I was pretty impressed with this. Well the film has a lot to live up
to, being a carbon copy of so many other films in the small horror
sub-genre that might be known as ""brilliant surgeon kidnaps victims and
operates on them in an attempt to restore his disfigured daughter to
her former glory"". It's been done before, most notably in the beautiful
""Les Yeux Sans Visage"", but let's not forget ""Mill of the Stone Women"",
""Corruption"", ""Faceless"" and I'm sure I've missed a few.

But there are two quite good differences here: in this plot all the
duaghter needs is a new pai of eyeballs, and secondly, none of the
unwilling ""donors"" in this movie actually die after their surgery, they
are collected, caged and left to go mad!. Which makes for some of the
best parts of the story.

There are weak spots, however. Richard Basehart is pretty flat as the
twisted eye surgeon Dr Chaney (oh please...!) who has no thought but
for restoring his daughter's sight. He plays the role on a single note,
and give the character no sense at all of anything going beneath the
surface. At times I wondered of he had been studying the William
Shatner school of acting, as his mumbling and lack of impact got quite
annoying after a while. Also - the impossibility of the eye transplants
working is obvious very early on. Right at the start, Gloria Grahame
(as the doctors assistant/partner) cries ""But it's impossible, it would
mean destroying the optic nerve"" or somesuch agrument. The doctor never
manages to come back to her on that. And later on, in a scene that
actually made me groan out loud, a colleage sees a successful eye
transplant and gasps: ""But how...?"" Dr Chaney just smirks and says ""The
real question is...why?"" No - the real question really IS ""how""?!! OK
those things aside, the movie does a good job. For all the poor
victims, it's a gruesome fate. Being drugged and then waking up in
a cage with both your eyeballs missing is a horrific idea and they all
manage to portray the right level of hysteria. There's even a great
close up of one victim's twitching empty eye sockets near the start.
Shame that later on the heavy browed ""eyeless"" prosthetics make them
look like a bit like they are wearing the ""Scream"" movie killer's
mask!! But the plight of these blind, caged victims is what makes the
movie. The fact that none of the actors could see through their eyeless
make-up probably contributes to their believable portrayals of panic.
In fact the character of the daughter almost disappears from the script
in the second half of the story, so small is her importance to the
tale.

The tension is well maintained though, and things move pretty snappily
-Dr Chaney seems to go through victims at an incredible rate. And if
you have any fears about losing your eyesight, I think this film will
definitely give you nightmares. Mind you so would the cover of this new Trinity DVD release - it's awful. Is it that hard to get the original promotional imagery on here, guys? This photo-shopped rubbish is just plain insulting.",1194048000,3,3028,4.635009310986964
1347700,1,B00004SPFH,"In all seriousness, this is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen.  It was on sale at FYE for $4.99, so my girlfriend and I thought we'd give it a try.  We did so based on the DVD cover, which depicted a creepy surgeon's face with red eyes in the background and a huge, scary looking castle in the foreground.  There was no original copyright date visable on the box; the reason for this was clear as soon as the film began.  Because the movie was made in 1977, the visual quality is fairly poor.  This wouldn't have been so bad if the advertisement wasn't so obviously intended to decieve the unsuspecting shopper.  Another thing is the ""interactive"" menu mentioned on the back of the box.  By interactive they mean you can choose to start the film at one of four scenes, depending on how much theatrical monkey vomit you can handle.  The movie itself was beyong obsurd, even by '70's horror standards.  The reviewer before me described Richard Basehart's acting as ""straight"".  It was straight alright, straight crap.  In summary, I think I'd rather have my [...] slammed in a car trunk than to be forced to sit through this garbage again.",1160784000,,1151,4.565853658536585
1347701,2,B00004SPFH,"A rarely seen movie from 1976, MANSION OF THE DOOMED suffers from a poor video transfer, but even state of the art technology can't compensate for the overall quality of this film.  The late Richard Basehart (TV'S VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA) portrays Dr. Chaney, an eye surgeon whose daughter is blinded in an auto accident.  He decides a total eye transplant will cure her blindness so he tricks her boyfriend (Lance Henriksen's screen debut) and removes his eyes, gives them to daughter Nancy and imprisons the now blind Lance in his basement.  He is aided by his current wife, the late Gloria Grahame (a screen siren of the 40s and 50s).  Nancy regains her sight, but it's only temporarily, so Basehart starts acquiring eyes from strangers, imprisoning them all in his basement prison.

The story's been told many times and this movie did mark the debut of makeup great Stan Winston and future director Andrew Davis (THE FUGITIVE).  But the chills are few, although the scenes of the blinded prisoners is quite disturbing.",1144195200,6,1030,4.823863636363637
1347702,4,B00004SPFH,"This movie is prety gruesome but almost has no gore

or blood, instead by using some really gruesome

topics (eyeball transplants),a good music score

(though rather short and repetitive), and good

acting (Basehart plays it straight) this is a good

horror movie.

Gloria Grahame, the late Grahame who was a big

movie star at one point (like Basehart) is his

helper as the good old Dr. Chaney (Basehart) looks

for hapless victims to give their eyes for his

daughter who went blind after an accident.

His an accredited scientist who keeps misdoings

a secret, and lures people he knows including

another doctor (played by a young Lance Henriksen

early in his movie career), a real estate agent

and a prostitute to name a few.

He is only trying to blow his ego by proclaiming

new improvements in eye research which take a big

nosedive when his daughter starts rejecting

the eye donor transplants. Of course this doesn't

stop the doctor from getting more victims.

Of course that's another gruesome area as he doesn't

kill them, after plucking out their eyes he ""stores""

them in his underground lab with other lab animals.

These scenes were the most chilling and most

effective as you see these people trying to get

out but not having their eyes provides a big

obstacle.

The ending is pretty satisfying though, and the

movie overally is good. I would check it out.",1133654400,9,1383,4.76595744680851
7921856,1,B00004SPFH,"I love Full Moon Features. This company puts out some really wonderful old horror films and, for that, I am grateful. However, I have to be honest about this, in spite of the impression it might give to those who read it, and warn buyers of this item that there is a terrible stock issue on this item, from multiple vendors including the Full Moon Features store itself. This item is horribly scratched, all copies I have seen as of April 2018. I have ordered three copies here, from two vendors, and have two friends who ordered here and from another site from three other vendors in total. The discs are all the same, scratched up all over the back, in new cases with new inserts. The discs skip at various points, pretty much in keeping with how deep the scratches are. I can't recommend this product because the printing is defective. Full Moon Features should recall the current batch and the last batch from six months ago. They are all damaged and being sold as new when they are scratched more than a used copy would be. This is not up to the standards of a typical Full Moon Features release. Good luck finding what you are looking for.",1522627200,2,1145,4.457142857142857

7921862,3,B00004SPFH,"To me and countless other fans, Charles Band is a film icon.  Much like Lloyd Kaufman, Band had a vision back in the day and worked hard his whole life to bring it to fruition.  As a result, we have a huge library of his works to enjoy.  MANSION OF THE DOOMED is an older title in this vault, however its still a lot of fun.  And while it is not perfect, its a film that will linger in your mind long after its over.

Now, before you watch this film (and I recommend you give it a shot), keep in mind it is very dated.  Many of the set pieces, including clothing styles, vehicles, and home decor, are definitive 70s-genre cliches.  But this can be overlooked, as long as the focus is kept on the story.  I didn't have a problem at all looking past these, and in turn, I had a good movie experience.

The look of MANSION OF THE DOOMED is pretty good overall, however the cinematography does not necessarily stand out, nor does the film style itself.  The acting is really good, however, with screen vets Richard Basehart and Gloria Grahame giving Grade A performances.  I also have to point out this is one of Lance Henriksens first films, an actor who I always enjoy onscreen.

The special effects deserve a lot of merit as well.  Legendary effects man Stan Winston did the effects, and they are certainly worthy of note.  Gruesome in a minimalistic way, every scene involving them makes you cringe and recoil.  I might go so far as to call them ghastly.

The story is not terribly original, even for that time period, although its nothing that detracts too much from the movie.  I like how it focuses on the eyes, yet the plausibility of keeping the subjects alive in the basement almost seems far-fetched.  Still, if you look past that, the film is fun overall.

MANSION OF THE DOOMED is a nice, nostalgic horror trip back to yesterday, and I have to give it a thumbs-up despite its shortcomings.  I recommend giving it a look, if anything to check out Stan Winstons handiwork.  The film is available now in a variety of formats.",1419206400,,2031,4.420485175202156
7921863,3,B00004SPFH,"When the beloved daughter of Dr. Chaney (the late, great Richard Basehart) loses her eyesight in a car accident, he will do anything to restore her to her former glory. He removes the eyes from living victims to transplant into his daughter. The first victim is Dan (a young Lance Henriksen in an early starring role). At first the operation seems a success, but soon her body rejects the eyes. This leads to the good doctor kidnapping more people for his experiments, locking their still-alive, but eyeless, bodies downstairs in the basement. The bodies begin to pile up and they are not a happy lot. Not only can they not see, but they are kept starving prisoners in an electrified cage. While Dr. Chaney goes about his gruesome business (he even attempts to steal a young girl from a park but she escapes), Dan and his visionless pals devise a way to free themselves and get their retribution. Basically a remake of THE HORROR CHAMBER OF DR. FAUSTUS (1959; a.k.a. EYES WITHOUT A FACE), this Charles Band production has real-life footage of actual eye surgery and some gross makeup effects (supplied by Stan [billed here as ""Stanley""] Winston) but not much else. Directed by veteran character actor Michael Pataki (GRAVE OF THE VAMPIRE - 1972) and written by Frank Ray Parelli (DRACULAS DOG - 1977). Future director Andrew Davis (THE FINAL TERROR - 1981; UNDER SIEGE - 1992) was Director of Photography here. Also starring Trish Stewart and an alcohol-induced Gloria Grahame with a cameo by Vic Tayback. MANSION OF THE DOOMED is also known as THE EYES OF DR. CHANEY and MASSACRE MANSION. Available on full screen DVD from Full Moon Direct, which look miles better than the scratchy print on VHS from Bingo Video. Rated R.",1418947200,2,1723,4.785234899328859
