2672848,5,B000JJSJPA,this was a very funny movie. a classic by doris day. the story line was very easy to follow and any fan of comedies would enjoy this movie.,1174435200,2,139,4.0
2672849,4,B000JJSJPA,"I've always felt that the pairing of Doris Day and Rod Taylor was as equally as good as that with James Garner or Rock Hudson, and much undervalued by the 'critics'! Somehow rugged Aussie He-Man Rod, and girl next door Doris, seemed like a perfect match, and they both had an appealing chemistry between them, you got the feeling they enjoyed each others company. 'Do Not Disturb' may not have been quite as good as their other film together [Glass Bottom Boat], but it was a lot better than most 'critics' paint it. A harmless piece of nonsense with some good laughs, and nice photography, it's what I'd class as a good 'no brainer' that you can sit back and watch after a hard day at work, and it's sure to relax you and put a smile on your dial! It's not a screen 'classic', but does what it intends to do, gives some good lighthearted entertainment, just by watching two pros strut their stuff. Rod, more remembered for his tough no nonsense action roles, has a suprisingly good flair for light comedy, and watching these two together, only makes me wish they'd teamed up for a couple more films.",1174348800,22,1100,4.505
2672850,4,B000JJSJPA,"Good to be able to watch a movie with your kids and not have to worry about the language. I started my daughter on Doris Day movies when she was young, and now at 14 we can enjoy them together.  Not quite as many laughs, but still classic Doris Day.",1174262400,5,249,3.98
2672851,5,B000JJSJPA,"I love Doris Day movies. I am trying to collect them all. I have most on VHS and I am excited that they are putting them onto DVD.

This is one of her typical Day movies, very funny, very cute!",1174176000,,193,3.825
2672852,5,B000JJSJPA,I was very pleased to find Do Not Disturb.  It is one of Doris Day's funniest movies and is not easy to find. Great family entertainment.,1173484800,,137,4.269230769230769
2672853,5,B000JJSJPA,I love this movie. I use to see this movie went I was young and I was hoping this movie was going to be on DVD.,1173312000,,111,3.3076923076923075
2672854,4,B000JJSJPA,"It's wonderful to see, finally, this Doris Day comedy on DVD. The formula plays much like the 1963 ""Move Over, Darling"", but that formula works, and changing it up with new plot incidents, locales, stars and designs makes ""Do Not Disturb"" a vintage piece of delightful entertainemt. Day is so winning and acts with such effortless ease, that we go right along with the silly sitcom plot devices. In fact, we enjoy them because she brings reality to even the most hackneyed gags. As usual, Day is surrounded by acting and production pros who make the proceedings all the more enjoyable because we don't worry that any element of the film is going to fall apart. ""Do Not Disturb"" takes us to the far-off lands of England and France via 20th Century Fox's backlot, and wraps everything visual with great style. The costumes for Day are particularly lavish here, including a spectacular floor length, backless, sequined tangerine gown - which she fills with utterly delightful femininity.  Rod Taylor is a fine co-star (he's even better with her in 1966's ""Glass Bottom Boat""), Hermione Baddeley gets to glam it up as a genteel British countrywoman, and Sergio Fantoni makes a terrific romantic foil. Lots of fizzy fun, great cast and production make this a film that can be viewed repeatedly as the type of romantic comedy that simply could not be made any longer.",1171411200,42,1361,4.8412017167381975
2672855,5,B000JJSJPA,Being a Doris Day fan all my life this is also excellent stuff.  Can still recall this movie to this day.  Still remember the title song Do not Disturb.  For great escapism and good entertainment you cant go wrong.,1168387200,19,214,4.435897435897436
2672856,4,B000JJSJPA,"Right before the Christmas, 1965 release of ""Do Not Disturb"", Fox executive Richard Zanuck noted that the film's star, Doris Day was the only surefire actress at the box-office in Hollywood. Doris Day movies made money and the public flocked to see Miss Day whenever a new film was released. ""Disturb"" continued that pattern, earning 20th Century Fox a nice profit although not quite in the league of earlier and some latter Day films. Nevertheless, it kept Miss Day in the box-office top ten. The 1965 list, released right after this film's release, showed her the top female star at the box-office, placing third on the list.

""Do Not Disturb"" is lightweight, harmless, amusing fluff. It is saved by some great production values including the cinematography of Oscar winner, Leon Shamroy, Miss Day's energetic performance and some of the most beautiful outfits the star has ever worn including a drop-dead gorgeous evening gown that clearly indicates that Miss Day was one of the silver screen's sexiest actresses.

Unfortunately the writing material given the gifted star doesn't give her the opportunities she deserves to shine as the skilled comic she has proven to be repeatedly. However, she makes the most of what is available.

The film represents her first on-screen teaming with Rod Taylor. They work well together although the chemistry they display the following year in MGM's hilarious ""Glass Bottom Boat"" isn't evidenced.

The opening credits are cute, the title song is catchy and rendered expertly by Miss Day. The supporting cast are all capable and features some of Hollywood's best veterans.

The plot about a American couple adjusting to life in London has been done to death previously. A couple of sequences are very funny, however Director Ralph Levy whose greatest fame was helming the hit Burns and Allen series on television in the 50's, is not skillful enough to milk all the laughs from the situation. A Norman Jewison would probably have made it seem funnier.

All this aside, Miss Day is enjoyable and there are some laughs, guffaws and chuckles throughout and the whole thing is pretty to look at.

Time Magazine in reviewing the film referred to it as ""Day's Hard Night"". It's better than they would lead you to believe.

If your expectations are not for another ""Thrill of It All"" or ""Pillow Talk"", ""Do Not Disturb"" will be a pleasant way to pass a couple of hours.",1162771200,105,2399,4.935483870967742

I think coming later in the 1960's, the little woman making a home by spending lots of hardworking husband's money thread isn't really that funny by this time period. In addition, the fake English signposts and a few token sheep set on an obvious California studio back lot rings false for a movie with big stars.

2672971,4,B000JJSJPA,"This is classic Doris Day--sweet, charming, kind, slightly muddled, lovely and very talented.  True--these movies are not deep.  They won't make you think deeply about life or stay with you for weeks to come--but for a cozy afternoon--perfect.  The story line is this--Rod Taylor, ever handsome, is a top executive and has just moved to London with his wife, Doris.  She purchases an out of the way country house and of course there the story begins with misunderstandings, confusion and funny moments.  There is even a trip to Paris to add to the misunderstandings.  Doris, who barely sings in the film, wears some stunning gowns and of course really lights up the screen--what a sunny personality!  I don't think this is the best of the Doris Day films because the plot is very light--I rather prefer some of the ones she made with Rock Hudson.  But is it charming?  Yes.  Nostalgic for those who grew up in that era? Certainly.  Just enjoy it.",1454198400,5,946,4.742331288343558

Mike Harper (Rod Taylor) an American has a job as the new head of a wool company in London trying to win a contract. Janet Harper (Doris Day) American, the wife is making a home in the country and learning all things English.

Each suspects the other of hanky-panky. They must maintain their positions. The question is will they ever trust each other? We watch as they banter and position (that is where the comedy comes in.)

Producers, writers, directors, SOMEONE had the great idea that Day make ""Pillow Talk""-like films for the remainder of her career.

2673165,5,B000JJSJPA,"I grew up watching Doris Day movies and was delighted when ""Do Not Disturb"" was released to DVD.  I enjoyed the chemistry between Rod and Doris on screen in this movie and ""The Glass bottom Boat"".  Rod always appeared to be a macho but uptight character, while Doris remained bubbly and likeable, clearly controlling the relationship in the passive-aggressive style of the American girlfriend/housewife of the 50s and 60s.

When I first saw ""Do Not Disturb"" as a child, I thought it was perfectly normal for a pretty housewife to be married to a man whose company transferred him to a place like London and have all of the money in the world they needed.  Watching it now, I was amused at how easily she spends his hard earned money that he seems to be so stressed about making.  Let's take some examples; Doris buys a large country house complete with servants in the English countryside, goes on a shopping spree for antiques in Paris, travels to Scotland to explain things to her husband after he ""catches"" her in the arms of the handsome Parisian antique dealer, buys an evening gown and matching coat (and of course had her hair and makeup done) at the hotel gift shop in time to attend a party that same evening.  Wow!  The wool business must be profitable.

While I enjoy the entire movie, my favorite scene is the ""discovery"" of Doris's character in what appears to be the morning after a champagne/wine induced passionate night in Paris.  I love the slow burn evident in Rod's body language and the sheer horror displayed on Doris's face, when she realizes she isn't exactly sure what happened.

Of course, Rod's character comes to his senses, gets worried about her because she hasn't arrived home, blows it one more time when his attractive ""assistant"" shows up at the party, has to worry all over again until, through of another series of mishaps, spots Doris running around between hotel rooms in a night gown.

2673197,3,B000JJSJPA,"Doris Day was among Hollywood's few truly bankable stars during the late 1950s and early 1960s, particularly noted for her comic talents in such frothy farces as PILLOW TALK, PLEASE DON'T EAT THE DAISIES, and THAT TOUCH OF MINK.  Unfortunately, as the 1960s progressed her films did not, and although her films remained popular they were seen as increasingly out of touch with the tone of the times.  The situation was not helped by Day's husband-manager Martin Melcher, who developed the habit of signing Day to film projects Day herself found uninspired.  Such was the case with the 1965 flyweight comedy DO NOT DISTURB.

The play seems to be a grab-bag of ideas from previous Day films, the story of a pretty but slightly klutzy wife (Day) and a neglectful husband (Rod Taylor) who find themselves at romantic cross purposes courtesy of their landlady Vanessa (Hermione Baddeley), a sexy secretary (Maura McGiveney), and a handsome antiques dealer(Sergio Fantoni.)  The roles are one-dimensional, the plot turns are predictable, and the dialogue trivial.  Both Day and Taylor respond by overplaying, sometimes to the point of shrillness.  Even so, they do manage to inject enough life into the film to make it mildly amusing--and the supporting cast is quite charming.  When all is said and done, the film is most memorable for the sight of Doris Day in a brilliantly orange evening gown as she struggles on the dance floor to shake away an olive dropped down her back.

The DVD includes several bonus features, including an account of Day's early life and career, a brief biography of Michael Romanoff (who plays a cameo in the film), and a brief biography of composer Mort Garson (who is perhaps best remembered for the song ""Our Day Will Come.)  It offers a nice transfer and is present in its original widescreen format.  Most Doris Day fans will find it amusing, but even so most will admit that DO NOT DISTURB is hardly among the first tier of her films: not bad, but in no way memorable.

2673198,4,B000JJSJPA,"For the longest time, DO NOT DISTURB was one of the most hard-to-find Doris Day movies.  This long-awaited DVD release corrects that problem, but watching the film for the first time the other night, it became all-too-clear why this comedy caper took it's time getting to home video.

It's just not that funny.

The charm of Doris Day could save even the most turgid movie (""Julie"", ""It's a Great Feeling""), so DO NOT DISTURB is watchable if only for her delightful screen presence.  The plot reads as follows: Janet Harper (Day) suspects her business-minded husband Mike (Rod Taylor) of fooling around with his female assistant.  In order to make him jealous, Janet's landlady Vanessa (Hermione Baddeley) invents a ""lover"" for Janet, but the plan spirals into farce when Janet is whisked off to Paris by handsome antique dealer Paul (Sergio Fantoni).  When Mike learns of Janet's disappearance, he follows and later discovers Janet and Paul in a very compromising position!

Just your average sex farce storyline, that was played far more stylishly in ""Lover Come Back"" with Day and Rock Hudson 4 years earlier.  Day and Rod Taylor share a solid chemistry, though, and would be paired again the following year in ""The Glass Bottom Boat"".

A highlight of the Doris Day romantic comedies from this period are Day's trendy wardrobe of clothes, but even those are very ordinary in DO NOT DISTURB.  Day was dressed here by Ray Aghayan for the very first time (he later did her clothes for both ""Move Over, Darling"" and ""Caprice""), but he costumes Day in some dreadful tweedy coats and a tangerine-coloured evening dress which is cut in a most unflattering way for Day's figure.

The DVD of DO NOT DISTURB is packaged very nicely with a smart assortment of bonus features.  ""The Rise of Doris Day"" briefly touches on Day's rise in showbusiness and her early singing background; ""Doris Day's Best Friends"" explores the various animal awareness organizations in which Day still actively works.  ""The Extra Prince: Michael Romanoff"" gives a fascinating look at the Hollywood bit-player and royal imposter who later founded Romanoff's Restaurant.  ""The Music Man: Mort Garson"" explores the life and career of the composer who later broke new ground with Moog music.  There are also restoration comparisons, trailers and photo galleries for DO NOT DISTURB plus ones for ""Move Over, Darling"" and ""Caprice"" (both sold separately).

2673199,2,B000JJSJPA,"Do Not Disturb is a frothy and light romance starring the lovely Doris Day and the charming Rod Taylor.  There was one thing about this movie that prevented me from fully enjoying it, however, and it took me a while to pinpoint what is was.  Surprisingly enough, it was Miss Day herself.  She seems to be taking the dizzy blonde American character to an extreme here, and comes across as trying too hard (almost frenetic in the last half) throughout the entire film.  Rod Taylor, on the other hand, appears as relaxed and effortless as ever.  The chemistry the two demonstrate in The Glass Bottom Boat is sadly not in play here, and the movie suffers for it.  Great Sixties fashion and snappy dialogue still need well-rounded characters to provide that special interplay that can draw in repeat viewers.  Only for hard-core Day or Taylor fans, although perfect for a lazy Sunday afternoon while flipping through magazines.",1188518400,3,922,4.834394904458598
2673200,4,B000JJSJPA,"a charming, pleasant sentimental comedy. not a bad film after all (unreleased in France)that seems to be not such a good souvenir in Doris' opinion. 40 years after remains an entertaining movie, with a je-ne-sais-quoi from the good old days...sorry, Day, of course!
beeing French, why do US directors see Paris that way, I will never understand! anyway, have fun with this movie! DD charming as ever.

2673202,1,B000JJSJPA,"There is little positive to say about this bad script, miscasting of actors and poor acting in general. I stopped the movie after about an Half Hour of viewing. This was a Birthday gift for my wife, who is a fan of Doris Day, Rock Hudson and Paul Lynne. None of who are on my favorite lists.

The Best part is probably where it says, ""The End.""",1183334400,3,344,4.134328358208955
2673203,2,B000JJSJPA,"Sometimes, directors are dazzled by the star they are directing. I think this was the case with ""Do Not Disturb.""  Ralph Levy seems to have sat back and NOT directed Doris Day!  Forget that this was a lame and utterly silly story and the Day character was just too silly for words (getting angry because her husband was at WORK and not available to help her pick out drapes for their living room, etc.).

In the midst of tremendous social criticism regarding Miss Day's ""being out of touch,"" her husband, Martin Melcher came up with this sub-standard script.  This was one of the scripts he brought to Miss Day and her eyes rolled back inside her head.  HE'D ALREADY SIGNED FOR HER TO MAKE THE FILM.

Doris is overly ""cutesy"" and ""muggy"" throughout. Don't get me wrong, she has her moments here.  (1) When she realizes that the children were drinking wine and not coke (2) The fun kickball on the street (3) The charming scene inside the Paris pub where she gets drunk and then lost in the fog.  The rest was just junk.  In the '60s in party scenes, there was always a dumb blond who starts laughing very loudly; there is some very BAD disco dancing and in true Day tradition, there is a chase scene near the end of the movie with Day running from SOMEone.  Rod Taylor looked angry and embarrassed throughout (with good reason) and Doris over-acted all over the place.  Thankfully, the two stars redeemed themselves in the funny and well done, ""Glass Bottom Boat"" the following year.

8151141,5,B000JJSJPA,"Doris Day saves what otherwise would be a mediocre film.  She shines as the wife of an executive, transferred to England (especially in two scenes.)
1.  Drunk on wine in Paris, she gets lost in a heavy fog and is singing and stumbling around.
2.  Charging in on her husbands clothing convention, of course wrongly assuming he is having an affair, she is thrust into a party full of executives and their assistants. Of course everyone thinks that she is an assistant too.  She makes things more fun by looking better than the other freinds wearing a hugging, tight, gold, sequence evening gown. (Doris has a great figure.)  One of the execs throws a grape down the back of her gown and she starts to shimmy to try to get it to drop out.  Of course the band thinks she wants to dance and a lot of fun follows.

Rod Taylor is kind of stiff, not nearly as much fun as in their other film together, The Glass Bottom Boat.(A much better film).
