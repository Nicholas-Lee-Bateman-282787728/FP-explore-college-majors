4495476,4,B004XEEM9Y,"I've read about various aspects of Grindhouse Cinema in books, and I lived through more of it than I care to admit, so seeing this insightful overview really put the capper on things for me.

This documentary takes you through the history of the genre (if you can call it that) with input from various directors and film historians. It starts at the very beginning (which might have been minutes after the first movie camera was invented) and on through all the factions, decades, directors, subject matter and what-not up into the 80s. You get trailers and scenes from some of the high(?) points along with a bit of behind-the-scenes input from the stars and directors. It's a wild ride in all its sordid glory.

As a true movie whore I loved every minute of this. It was great getting such a comprehensive overview of something that I knew only in bits and pieces. At a mere 80 minutes I could have used a bit more. For instance: They note Russ Meyer only for his having been one of the first (if not THE first) film maker to infuse 'nudie cuties' with plotlines, when he actually had a huge impact on developing the entire soft core porn genre. But this is a minor quibble. For anyone interested in Grindhouse Cinema, or if you lived through some portion of it, this will bring back fond memories and give you a good dose of film history to boot.",1311897600,10,1349,4.479674796747967

You may know about or be familiar with the term grindhouse. Film directors Robert Rodrguez and Quentin Tarantino have been releasing or promoting movies helmed by other moviemakers that fall under this category, movies that clearly influenced them. But what is a grindhouse film? That is precisely what the very informative and highly engaging ""American Grindhouse"" tries to answer for us, and it delightfully succeeds in doing so.

The documentary rightly begins from the beginning, where several film historians and directors try to give us a definition of ""grindhouse movie."" However, perhaps the easiest one -- and my favorite --, would be that these are films that are shown in inner city movie theaters, which are better referred to as exploitation films, in which there is one element that you can exploit, namely nudity, sex, violence, monsters, etc.

""American Grindhouse"" then moves on to the history of the grindhouse films, and we learn that they have been around since the birth of movies, and that ""Traffic in Souls,"" released on November 24, 1913, which grossed over $450,00, and which placed Universal Pictures as a major contender, has been described as the first exploitation film. Through those early years, other films released under this umbrella are The Wolf Woman (1916), Night Nurse (1931), Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931), The Sign of the Cross (1932), Baby Face (1933), and others. From then on, director Elijah Drenner takes us, step by step, through the history of these films, including the Will Hays censure code on Hollywood; the effect of Tod Browning's riveting ""Freaks"" (1932), as well as Dwain Esper's Maniac (1934) and Narcotic (1933); the ""educational"" sex films; the appearance of the film noir movies (e.g. The Maltese Falcon, Double Indemnity, The Killers); the so-called ""Paramount decision,"" in which the code was removed; the Burlesque films explosion; the teenager rebellion (e.g. Rebel without a cause, The Wild One) and teen beach parties movies; Russ Meyer; Blaxploitation films; Women in prison; and much more. In the end, we are told - not to our surprise - that all this evolution, all these roads, seemed to end in pornography.

Much of the valuable information provided in ""American Grindhouse"" was provided by directors John Landis, William Lustig, Joe Dante, Jack Hill, Larry Cohen, Fred Olen Ray, Hershell Gordon Lewis, and others. Film historians, such as Eddie Muller, Eric Schaefer, and Kim Morgan also assist in the narration, which was magnificently glued together by director Drenner.

""American Grindhouse"" is must for any fan of these types of movies, as well as film historians. It truly has a lot of well-researched information, and it will probably ignite in you the desire of trying to find and get some of the films mentioned in this awesome documentary. The DVD is loaded with extras, including a making-of documentary, extended interviews, a gallery of trailers, and much more. (USA, 2010, color and B&W, 82 min plus additional materials)

4495478,4,B004XEEM9Y,"To fans of exploitation cinema, the term ""Grindhouse"" is a household term that's frequently used.  Recently the term has been unleashed on the general public, thanks in no small part to the Tarantino/Rodriguez project.  But be that as it may, most folks still have no idea what the term means.  I've been asked about it a time or two, and most fans would agree that it does take some explaining to define it.
Well, this documentary more or less does that.  It's basically Grindhouse For Beginners.  Lots of history, name dropping, movie clips and interviews.  It moves at a very frantic pace, never staying on one particular film or topic for very long, but runs through tons of brief film clips throughout.  It covers the very beginnings with some of Thomas Edison's first films, all the way through the classic years of 42nd Street.
Some fans are gonna be disappointed at the lack of specific films and directors being mentioned, and this is understandable, but this isn't meant to be an in depth history, but more of an intro.  The director said in an interview I read that this film was to be kind of a glorified DVD extra.  In the same interview he said that certain names and films were left out intentionally, though he gave no concrete reason why.  Personally I think it's a flat out crime to have not mentioned Roger Corman once.  But this documentary originally started out as a documentary on director Jack Hill, and then just kinda grew from there, which might explain the rushed and incomplete feel.
So why the four stars?  Well, I enjoyed it.  We Grindhouse weirdos are the type to have already obsessively researched the films, directors and history, so there isn't much information here we didn't know already(though some of the very early history of the 20s and 30s was enlightening for me).  But watching this film is kinda like watching that season finale episode of a sitcom where they go back over the highlights of the season-It's a fun trip down memory lane.  Plus, I love watching John Landis in interviews.
So, while exploitation fans may be split down the middle on the quality and/or entertainment value of American Grindhouse, those unfamiliar with the term and curious to find out just what it's all about, can definitely start here.",1304985600,18,2262,4.749360613810742

No matter what you are into it's very interesting
Narrated by the one and only Robert Forster this is one of the best non horror documentaries I've seen
It's the history of the exploitation genre from the beginning silent era into the  death in the late 1970's
It's super interesting and very entertaining
All the people interviewed through-out have a real love and understanding for this sub-genre  that changed everything
Even if you are not into any of the exploitation films  it's still a interesting and fun watch

The only major gripe i have with it three  films that are never mentioned are Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Night of the Living Dead (Both these two  films made lots of money in all night theaters) and Thriller: A Cruel Picture was a real sleazy grindhouse style film  but, that's the only negative
It runs 80 minutes it's the fastest 80 minutes I ever wasted

4495502,3,B004XEEM9Y,"First of all let me just say that as a fan of the grindhouse genre what is presented in this documentary is solid and informative. With extensive coverage of grindhouse filmmaking starting with practically the genesis of film up through the 1970s with a brief mention of modern day films like Planet Terror, Death Proof, Black Dynamite and Machete. Genres covered included pre code cautionary films from the early 1900s through the 30s and 40s, Blaxploitation, biker films, nazisploitation, nudist films, sexploitation, hippiesploitation, prison films, the porn industry and some gore flicks. But having said that...there could have been more. They barely scratched the surface when it came to horror and monster films. No mention of classic grindhouse horror flicks like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Dawn Of Dead, The Hills Have Eyes, I Spit On Your Grave and the list goes on and on. They also completely ignored the carsploitation genre entirely, no Vanishing Point, no Dirty Mary Crazy Larry, no Death Race 2000 and so on and so on.

The actual documentary itself before the credits start to roll barely clocks in at 75 minutes. I personally think that if they had chosen to cover the omitted material that I had mentioned above they could have easily filled a two hour timeslot and made a more complete documentary for American grindhouse films.

Granted, the filmmakers had not set out to do that initially, they had planned on just focusing on certain film makers from the genre and a select list of films, but later decided to try and do a history of Grindhouse cinema instead. That is mentioned in the special features on the DVD itself.

Again, it wasn't a bad documentary, there just could have been more to it.

Perhaps if someone else tries their hand at a Grindhouse documentary again in the future they can include more facets of it and even go beyond just American Grindhouse and also include material for foreign grindhouse style films as well.

My advice, just rent this one.",1367020800,2,1993,4.902077151335312
4495503,4,B004XEEM9Y,"As long as film has existed, filmmakers have found a way to exploit it, as Elijah Drenner shows us in this shocking look at the cinematic underground, AMERICAN GRINDHOUSE. Drenner presents a complete and fully informed history of the Exploitation genre, from its early beginnings in films like Thomas Edison's TRAFFIC IN SOULS to the more recent trend in so-called ""Torture-Porn"" pictures like HOSTEL. Few realize just how outrageous and scandalous the films of the pre-Code era truly were, with a proliferation of sex and violence that Drenner brings back to the surface for a startling effect. The evolution of Exploitation is then documented in great detail, traveling through the stages of the early sex films, educational pictures, horror and the grand guignol, Film Noir, burlesque, teenage delinquency, Sexploitation, and gore (and that's just in the first half!). However debatable the content of these films may be, the cultural impact that filmmakers like Russ Meyer, Samuel Arkoff, and Herschell Gordon Lewis had on cinema is unmistakable. Robert Forster's dry narration often seems out of place given the sensational subject matter, but the colorful commentary of the Exploitation genre's most knowledgeable historians and filmmakers help to liven things up. An excellent ensemble of classic film trailers and vintage posters also accompany this informative look into filth, with key editing attributed to Andy Goldenberg, Dan Greene, and Drenner, himself.

4495505,5,B004XEEM9Y,"s review is from: American Grindhouse (DVD)

These movies are pure schlock. They feed the most base instincts. And this movie tells the history of the Grindhouse genre in very well researched detail, and how it evolved and changed through time. It even points out that the first person who ever made a movie, Thomas Edison, made a couple of exploitation films.

A few of the films talked about are Freaks, Last House, Blood Feast, Jaws, and Shewolf of the SS.

We see some of the directors of these films, such as H.G. Lewis, and Don Edmonds, talking candidly about making these movies, and the importance of making money out of any movie made. They point out that the public decides what movies it wants to see, and movies are made accordingly. And exploitation movies have usually been very financially rewarding.
