8143573,5,B000I2J7EU,"What would happen if we put Les Claypool on stage with Phil Lesh and Mike Gordon? Aside from needing more cowbell, how would it sound if moe. played 'Don't Fear the Reaper' with Blue yster Cult? Would Perry Farrell ever play with The String Cheese Incident? The responses to such questions are not just hypothetical curiosities but the fabric of the Jammys experience. Indeed, ""Best of the Jammys"" is an epic trip into live improvisational music. The DVD bridges the gap between jambands and classic rock, Blues, alternative rock and Country. No intact bands perform. Instead, the event features dream bands or 'frankenstein groups' that unite under the flag of jam. Could there be a more unlikely combination than the Disco Biscuits and Travis Tritt? As unlikely as it may be, their music is some of the most rewarding. That written, every song is a five star experience. If there's a drawback to ""Best of the Jammys,"" it's the noticeable absence of jazz. Hopefully volume 2 will portray a more balanced view of the event. In terms of the production, the camera work is excellent and the video editing is superb. Uninterrupted by interviews, songs are allowed to play in their entirety. The audio editing fulfills the greatest potential of the surround sound experience. Hats off to Relix for such a fantastic production. ""Best of the Jammys - volume 1"" will strongly resonate with anyone who loves live improvisational music.",1195776000,8,1427,4.95
