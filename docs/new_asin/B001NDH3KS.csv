3712491,5,B001NDH3KS,"Baby Signing Time is the best series that I have seen for teaching sign language and interacting with my child.  My daughter's vocabulary and communication skills have increased since using the videos.  This video is very well done and uses words demonstrated within the same program.  For example, the word ""day"" is introduced in one segment and then used again to in conjunction with ""sunny day.""  The music and graphics are catchy for the children and shouldn't wear on the parent.  I cant wait to get my copy of Volume 4.",1253664000,,525,4.725274725274725
3712492,5,B001NDH3KS,"My infant grandson starts kicking and smiling when he hears this video start up.  My toddler grandson, has learned lots of signs and is heard singing the songs during the day when he's not watching the video.  Great fun and educational too! We have the first 2 volumes and plan to get the 4th one too.",1250208000,,301,4.357142857142857
3712493,5,B001NDH3KS,"Baby Signing time is my son's (16 months) favorite dvds. If we ever say baby signing time, he gets way excited and heads towards the tv. There hasn't been another dvd I've been able to find that will keep his full attention. It has really helped with communication and understanding what he wants before he starts talking.",1246838400,,322,4.666666666666667
3712494,5,B001NDH3KS,"This is a great follow-up to Baby Signing Time 1 & 2!  Our 19-month-old absolutely ADORES these DVDs, and they have been her favorites since she was four or five months old.  She loves the songs, and has learned so many signs.  And we love being able to communicate with her well before her speech kicks in - imagine the tantrums we've bypassed by knowing exactly what she wants when she wants it.  She's happier, and we're happier.

The songs on Baby Signing Time 3 are a little more repetitive in tone than on volumes 1 & 2, but our baby doesn't seem to notice.  We recommend these to all our friends.",1243814400,8,603,4.339285714285714
3712495,5,B001NDH3KS,"My daughter absolutely loves these videos! She is 18mos and really getting into signing now. Every time I ask if she wants to watch ""baby sign"" she jumps up and down. The songs are pretty good on this DVD. Many of the signs are a little more advanced and require to hand gestures put together, not just one. So this may be better for a child that is pretty proficient at single gesture signs. Some of the signs are relevant such as trees, grass, stars. Some of the signs are not such as day. It all depends on how far you want to take their signing. And if you're not even interested in signing the video itself is entertaining for a child because of all the children on the video.",1463011200,,681,4.246153846153846

3712503,5,B001NDH3KS,"Baby signing time is awesome! We've been using since our youngest was 10 months. At 13 months how she's using a handful of signs regularly, and trying out others all the time. I don' want to encourage my baby to watch T.V. so baby signing time are the only videos we'll watch together at this point. The songs are really cute, Rachel's enthusiasm is wonderful, and it's nice to have all the different babies and children showing you how they do the signs. Even when our baby is done watching, our other kids will often still sit and watch. ;) Episode 3 is great because it teaches things that we are ready for now like ""wait"".",1442620800,,626,4.405172413793103
3712504,5,B001NDH3KS,I bought 1 and 2 and my first daughter loved them.  Bought number video 3 with baby number 2.  At a year old (maybe a bit younger) both my girls caught on fast with these videos they loved them and even now my 4 almost 5 year old will watch them with her little sister and use the signs and still enjoys them.  I highly recommend these!  Personally I still always make them say the word as well as doing the sign when they want something so that their speech isn't slowed from not having to verbalize requests.  These have been awesome!,1439424000,,536,4.215686274509804
3712505,5,B001NDH3KS,"Love this video.  Sadly, I let a few negative reviews dictate my NOT purchasing of this video earlier.  Our son LOVES this one.  The songs are really fun and catchy.  Literally the same day he started using some of the signs from video.  He actually LOVES all of them.  I try rotating them....but this one is great.  I find myself singing these songs quite a bit.",1435104000,,363,4.409090909090909
3712506,2,B001NDH3KS,"For some reason, my toddler just doesn't like this volume. He loves 1 and 2 but this one loses his attention shortly after the intro. I'm trying to make it through the entire show so I can learn the signs to teach him, but even I have a difficult time staying focused on it. I don't want to 1 star the review since it has good signs to learn. Back to watching 1 & 2 until volume 4 arrives.",1433635200,,389,3.9367088607594938
3712507,4,B001NDH3KS,"My 14 month old has loved these videos...except this one. This one she walks away from and ignores it entirely. I give it 4 stars because I've enjoyed learning with this video series, not so much for this one particular video. The signs on this video are on the older kids' signing time which you can buy from iTunes for the same cost as renting here or watch on netflix.
We love BABY signing time.",1432857600,,398,4.32

These videos are awesome to help babies communicate before their words catch up.  Absolutely recommend all of them.  (though the second volume grated on me at first).  1, 3, and 4 are our favorites.",1431043200,,336,4.426229508196721

3712515,5,B001NDH3KS,"Fantastic. I can't sing the praises of this entire series enough!  We started using the at 4 months old and at 6 months my daughter started signing milk, eat, and quickly followed by dozens of other signs over the next several months. My husband I Have learned righ along side her!  Her language development and vocabulary are well above average.  At just 24 months she speaks in full complex sentences with varied vocabulary. She sings full fledged songs like God Bless America, Let it Go, part of your world, and many many more. She knows her letters, colors, shapes, zoo animals, bugs, sea animals, farm animals, recognizes numbers 1-20, recites numbers 1-20. Counts objects 1-10, spells her name, knows her address, knows the other states our family members live in...the list just goes on.  Now I know these videos aren't the only reasons she is flourishing so well, but I do attribute these as the start to it all.  I love that I can sign instructions to her without having to say a thing out loud. It prevents frustration and humiliation for her.  Other parents are amazed and immediately want to know what I'm doing with her!  As a baby she was super happy and content because she could always make her wants and needs known. Now as a toddler, I can sign for her to sit down during library story time, she can sign to me when she needs to go potty. Mind you,  she uses her verbal language most of the time, but this is her second language and she is better at it then me!  These videos are engaging, have catchy songs, and the repitivite ness seals the deal for the learning!

This would make a fantastic baby shower gift! You will be thanked over and over again!",1423612800,,1671,4.5215946843853825

3712519,5,B001NDH3KS,"My daughter absolutely loves these videos.  It is the only tv/movies I let her watch because I don't feel that young children should watch too much of any ""screen time"".  But these videos are different. Not only will the child start signing, but also speaking sooner. She loves the children and animals in the videos. She will dance and laugh when she watches them.
The music might be a little obnoxious, but she loves it.",1417392000,,422,4.613333333333333

Buy or rent this for your littles under one years old and you will see the difference in their communication skills! I noticed that the more we watched together and practiced the signs, the less frustrated he was with me and expressing his needs. My son is now two and talks a lot, and he still uses some of the signs in combination with his words.",1414022400,,410,4.269230769230769

3712528,5,B001NDH3KS,"We initially purchased the Baby Signing Time series so we could better communicate with a young family member. This series has blessed our lives ten fold. At the time, we didn't know our oldest wouldn't learn to speak until he was three. I credit the Baby Signing Time series with giving us the ability to communicate, especially through the frustrating moments, with ASL. The music is fantastic, the explanations and visuals are so clear. When we watch, our senses aren't assaulted like with so many other kids' ""educational"" programs. I gift this series to every new Mom and we continue to enjoy these shows along with other programs from Two Little Hands Productions (Rachel and the Treeschoolers & Potty Time specifically). You won't regret the time or money spent on this wonderful program. So sit back and enjoy learning ASL with your family!",1398470400,,848,4.937062937062937
3712529,5,B001NDH3KS,"We bought this because our daughter had already started our granddaughter on the 1st one and really liked it.  It was nice to be able to really communicate with her when she was only a few months old and not talking yet.  She is not hearing impaired, but before about age two, most children don't really speak many words.  At just over a year old she could clearly ask for milk, cereal or an apple (and many more) without just making sounds and pointing or getting frustrated wen we didn't get what she asked for.",1397088000,,513,4.378947368421053

3712531,5,B001NDH3KS,My daughter loved these and was able to pick up several signs that really helped us communicate better before she could talk and I think maybe helped her to catch onto words faster too.,1394582400,,185,4.470588235294118
3712532,5,B001NDH3KS,"Hard as it is to imagine, this really works in helping a child learn to communicate prior to the development of their verbal skills.  It's fun and a wonderful way to avoid the frustration a child experiences when no one understands what they want.",1394236800,,247,4.613636363636363
3712533,5,B001NDH3KS,I have enjoyed all four baby signing time videos. This one is my favorite.  Thank you to  Rachel Coleman and team for bringing this fun series into our lives.  It truly is joyful to communicate in sign with my one year old.,1392508800,,223,4.261904761904762
3712534,4,B001NDH3KS,"We started our daughter out on the My Baby Can Talk series and have probably watched each DVD no less than a hundred times each.  This program excels at teaching signs.  It differs somewhat from Baby Signing Time in that, except for a few interludes, there is no singing.  There is music throughout, however.

We decided to try Baby Signing Time and have watched them in order up to number 3.  Our daughter is very entertained by these programs, however, I do think they are a little less effective at teaching signs.  The songs are very catchy and will get stuck in your head all day, despite your best efforts.  There are also animations and a greater variety of children than in the My Baby Can Talk series.

My chief complaint is that when the sign is given my Rachel, the presenter, her expressions are distracting and cause my daughter (and me as well) to look at her face rather than her hands.  They can also be confusing.  For example, in this volume there is a segment called ""Can You Feel It?"" which covers signs such as happy, sad, and cry.  Rachel gives the sign for sad and has a sad face but then ends the sign with a big smile.  She does tend to play to the camera a bit.

For parents deciding between the two, My Baby Can Talk and Baby Signing Time both have a lot to offer.  My Baby Can Talk has a sort of homemade feel to it, which some people might find cheap but we found endearing.  Our daughter learned all of the signs in My Baby Can Talk and she is starting to catch onto Baby Signing Time.  Sometimes the signs feel like less of a focus than Rachel's singing, so I would have patience if you start with this series.  Now that my daughter is a toddler she seems to prefer the movement and singing in this series.  You can't go wrong with either series, though parents new to signing might want to start with My Baby Can Talk before moving onto Baby Signing Time.",1390089600,4,1887,4.2974504249291785

3712536,5,B001NDH3KS,"Rachel Coleman is brilliant!  The songs are catchy, the kiddos are adorable, and the signs are memorable.  It took a while for my kiddos to get it, but they were interested and wanted to watch it all the time.  After that it was only a matter of time before they started to sign as well.  The whole set is the best signing DVD's out there.  I agree that some of the signs are a bit difficult for kiddos to learn, but as a parent/ guardian/ caregiver you will learn what their sign is for that particular word.  It won't be exact, but it will be close enough.  Great videos!",1389657600,,573,4.201834862385321

3712538,5,B001NDH3KS,I heard about 10 moms raving over these DVDs at  a Consignment sale once and ordered the first 2 for my then 2 year old son. He is now 3.5 and still lOVES watching them so Santa brought him this 3rd one and he has watched it 100 times! He loves it and the songs are catchy an fun just like the first 2.

3712539,5,B001NDH3KS,My husband and I rave at the ability to sign with our daughter.  It helps to be able to communicate with our 16 month old.  She's been signing for over 6 months!  Takes a lot of guesswork out of what she needs or wants.  A lot less frustration for everyone.,1388620800,,257,4.08

I purchased the baby signing time series when he was about 10 months old because he loved them and tried communicating.  He loves the outdoors and this particular video teaches many of those signs.  His first sentence was ""wind-tree-outside"" because the wind was blowing the trees outside the kitchen window.  It's really cool to have your little one communicate their ideas so early.",1373068800,,464,4.8354430379746836

3712546,5,B001NDH3KS,"My toddler loves Baby Signing Time.  It is fun and educational.  The important thing to remember is this DVD by itself will not teach your baby very much.  It provides a platform to introduce the signs, but ultimately you will have to regularly practice the signs together.

3712548,5,B001NDH3KS,"In the beginning, we weren't so sure about these Baby Signing Time DVDs so we borrowed a couple of them from the library and then finally decided to purchase them since our little guy loved them so much.  We started teaching our son sign language when he was six months old.  It has been a wonderful resource for him to learn new signs by watching the DVDs.  The music and clips of other babies signing definitely makes it more interesting for him.  He is now 20 months old and uses his signs to communicate to us everyday.  I would say that we love the songs in the third DVD more than the first and the second (even though they are all very good).  I would recommend these DVDs to all parents who are interested in teaching their babies sign language.  However, I believe that the most important and helpful thing in teaching your baby sign language is your constant reinforcement of what he has learned in the DVD by actually using the signs and by practicing them with him on a regular basis.",1367107200,,996,4.409836065573771

3712551,5,B001NDH3KS,Another great BST DVD!  Ignore the reviews that say this one is more boring than the first and last in the series.  My babe loves this one too! These have been perfect for my little one from about 6 months up until now at almost 14 months.  She loves the songs and has learned almost all of the signs and uses them all day long.

3712556,5,B001NDH3KS,"Besides showering our baby with love, teaching her to sign was one of the greatest things we have done for ourselves and our daughter! No joke!

I had always wanted to teach my child how to sign long before it was the new, cool thing to do. I had taken a course in college about signing and it just ingrained into me the need to do this with children.

When my baby was born we waited until about 10 months old to start teaching sign language. I realized that me teaching her was great but it took longer then I thought for her to catch on to it. My sister bought me this DVD for my daughter's 1st birthday and I was so excited! I was going to have a helper on this journey!

Within the first week my daughter was signing 12 signs!!! We have since purchased I think just about every Baby Signing Time & Signing Time there is! My daughter could communicate with us so early on and was so much more happy because of it. She is also crazy smart which I attribute somewhat to helping her sign early.

This is the best thing around when it comes to signing. Rachel, the kids, the characters, the songs are all done right. My daughter is now 5 and speaking up a storm, but we still use signs to communicate in a quiet place, or if we are trying to communicate without drawing attention.

Since my daughter has mastered this DVD, I have not had it on my DVD shelf because everyone seems to want to borrow it! Please, please invest in these DVDs....its beyond worth it!",1356480000,,1461,4.222222222222222

Really love all these videos!!",1355356800,,274,3.963636363636364
3712558,5,B001NDH3KS,All the videos are excellent. We started showing our daughter right after she turned 1 and it has helped so much. My husband and I realize that she is learning and understanding a lot because she uses the signs to communicate with us. I think it would be a lot more difficult to gauge her abilities without it. Signing has been a wonderful tool to communicate before she can form all words,1351209600,,389,4.416666666666667

She said that they started playing the videos when he was around 4-6 months, and didn't think he was really paying attention.  Lo and behold, at around 9 months old, he started doing the signs!  We had the same experience with our daughter, who is now 12 months old.  We have Volumes 1-3.  She really enjoys watching the children signing to fun music that she can also dance to.  It's amazing that over the last month, her signing vocabulary has increased significantly.  It's great that we can communicate with her before she can speak and that she can communicate right back!

The songs are catchy, upbeat and Rachel isn't as annoying in this one as some of the others. My son seems to like it the best, as well! Words learned are perfect during this stage of his life, too: outdoor things, nature, some of the greatest things of a toddler boy's life! Well done.",1343347200,,374,4.136986301369863

3712566,5,B001NDH3KS,My son was a late talker and at 15 months wasn't saying anything yet. Not even Mama and Dada. Within a week of beginning this series he had already picked up 10+ signs. At 2 years he is still a little behind on speaking but has played tremendous catch up and we think its because of the signing. He still loves to sign while he talks and will ask for these videos. Great option if you don't want your child to just sit in front of the TV and watch uneducational programming. Would highly recommend the whole series!,1328745600,,515,4.26530612244898

3712568,5,B001NDH3KS,"This is our third Baby Signing Time video purchase. My 2-year old toddler has really enjoyed each one. I was pretty skeptical before buying our first (I'm a fairly frugal guy). Even though these videos are not expensive, the idea of a bad purchase is less than settling. The great reviews on Amazon finally did convince me, though, and I couldn't be happier with the decision.

My daughter asks to watch ""Signing Time"" nearly every day. The signs are taught in a way that she's able to pick them up quickly. Has it helped with our communication? ...immensely. Her enunciation is still not great and sometimes she gets quite frustrated with me for not understanding what she's saying. If she can sign the word(s), however, all becomes quickly clear and her smiling satisfied look of relief is quick to follow as I successfully confirm what she's saying.

This video in particular (of the three we own) is packed with lots of signs that we use everyday. Driving has become good signing practice as we pass trees, flowers, leaves, etc. and we see the sun and clouds or the moon and stars in the sky. It's great and she seems to really enjoy being able to sign the words as she speaks them.",1326326400,,1186,4.589622641509434

My son loves them but he is growing bored of the same videos and isn't interested in any other movies or TV shows. We bought 3 (and 4) and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE vol. 3. The songs are super catchy. The pace is a tad faster than vol. 1 and 2 and the concepts are a tad older (it is weather related) but nothing too advanced. I definitely recommend if your child/children love the other volumes.",1325116800,9,586,3.9745762711864407

3712571,3,B001NDH3KS,"This just isn't as good as Baby Signing Time one or two. The lyrics are more repetitive and the tunes more irritating. The signs are useful, but you could probably teach them to your child without the DVD and save yourself some cash and disappointment. Most hated lyrics include: ""a new day for you day, a new day for me day, a can't wait to see day, a da da li do day"" also ""I'm creepy crawly and very small - ee"". Maybe the first two just set the bar really high, but if you have any musical sensibilities and are into these DVD's I would skip this one and stick to 1,2, and 4.",1315785600,5,579,4.043478260869565

She doesn't understand the signs yet, but because i have learned them, i sign with her anytime i can.  I believe in the developmental process of signing with a baby and i believe these DVD's are a fantastic product for learning.  I am not always sure how they pick the words they decide to teach - but they cover a wide variety of topics and concepts, in volume 4 it's friendship, playing nicely and sharing, and emotions.  Volume 3 includes weather, moon and stars, grass and trees.  I love these DVD's!",1309996800,4,675,4.419354838709677
3712574,4,B001NDH3KS,"My daughter loves these videos so I had to get her this third one for her birthday. She likes it ok, her favorite part of any of the movies is the first song, she gets so excited and starts dancing around and hollering and smiling when she hears it come on. The first two videos have more catchy fun songs that hold her attention a little better than this one. They are all great for learning the signs with repetition and fun, she hasn't picked up on many signs yet, she is just over a year old and signs ""more"", ""sign/signing"" and ""please"" but has shown little interest in expanding her signing vocabulary right now, but she enjoys the songs and animations of the videos. I recommend this video and the others in the series for anyone wanting to do baby sign language with their child. These are great because they are ASL but they are shown in a way that children can understand, and I love that they show toddlers doing the signs because you can see and understand that they aren't going to sign it perfectly and that's ok as long as they have the concept and general movement of the sign they can be understood and signing is a great way for them to communicate their needs and desires before they can do so verbally.",1306368000,5,1222,4.364035087719298

At first we were signing to him and although he was picking up on it, he didn't seem to have much interest in it... if that makes sense. Then we found these videos and he started signing up a storm! It seems like the videos really reinforced what we were teaching him while making it super fun and engaging. As he has gotten older he still loves the DVDs, and uses them not just to learn how to sign, but for language development and fun as well. I'm shocked on all of the signs, words/phrases, and songs my 1 year old has under his belt from these DVDs. Absolutely amazing!",1303084800,,814,4.191082802547771

Plus it gives me 20 minutes to fold laundry, do the dishes and other minor house work while in the same room.  These are great DVDs.

3712582,5,B001NDH3KS,"I love the Signing Time series and own a half-a-dozen videos. I appreciate Rachel's (and her large family's) work on these. My child really learns from them, and why not learn sign language, rather than just watch little bear or Elmo?

This is one of my child's favorite videos.  The animation is simple but adequate. Rachel is very upbeat and energetic. As some other reviewers noted, this DVD is more repetitive than others, but children don't mind, and in fact, like it.  My 1 1/2 y.o. child signs 'bug' or 'sun' when she wants to watch this video.  I find the signs in this DVD useful, and they are distinct from the others (some of which overlap). I recommend all 4 of the Baby Signing Time and Signing Time's Playtime Signs (which has a nice song about please/thank you, manners).

UPDATE:
For what it is worth, the use of all these videos (we now own almost all of them) plus signing on my part, has given my child such a good sign language vocabulary that at 3 yrs of age, she has been able to attend the local Deaf School (she is neither deaf nor HH). This has given her the opportunity to make D/HH friends and learn another language, as well as giving those children the chance to befriend and communicate with a mainstream child. In addition, when we are in a public locale that is intimidating, my child will often not speak out of shyness, but she will sign to me. So it has become our 'secret' communication tool in public. She also know the signs for all the letters, and the fact that so many signs involved shaking the first letter of the word (i.e., 'blue' 'water' 'dessert' 'fruit' 'toilet') has helped her pre-reading. Signing has turned out to be more advantageous to our family than I would have expected. Nice!",1293840000,,1734,4.509554140127388
