227851,4,6300185885,"Boris Karloff ,after toiling in the cinematic vineyards for years without much success ,achieved fame as Frankenstein's Monster -the creation of a mad scientist .In this movie he gets promoted to playing the crazed scientist himself ,one Dr Janos Rukh ,a man who when in Africa finds a strange meteorite .When he touches the glowing rock he is contaminated by a substance he labels Radium X which renders him lethal to the touch ,once the daily doses of antidote wear off .He deploys his new found killing power on his unfaithful wife (Freances Drake),her lover and indeed most of the cast before the movie reaches its climaz

Karloff in his first horror movie outing without heavy makeup is moving and dignified as ever and Lugosi as ever complements him admirably .The acting elsewhere is less compelling but overall this works well. Lambert Hillyer -who made the wonderful Dracula's Daaughter in the same year-directs with brio ;the efefcts are for their day admirable ,and this is a good minor shocker .It may well be the first movie to echo those grand old horror sentiments ""There are somethings that man is not meant to know""- a line spoken in the movie

This is a good little movie and I recommend it to your notice",1193702400,5,1223,4.764150943396227
227852,4,6300185885,"The Invisible Ray was yet another teaming between Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi coming off their successful 1934's The Black Cat and 1935's The Raven.  While the Invisible Ray is not as good as these films, it is very underrated and stands up quite well as a horror/sci-fi film.  Karloff gets more screen time but Lugosi at least has more to do in this film than he would in 1940's Black Friday where his role was minimal.

Karloff is eccentric scientist Janos Rukh and his much younger wife Diana is played by Frances Drake.  Rukh is visited at his castle in the Carpathian Mountains by scientists Sir Francis Stevens and Dr. Felix Benet (Lugosi) along with Lady Stevens and her nephew Ronald.  I sure would like to know how scientists can afford these big castles in all these old horror films. Ronald and Diana have an immediate attraction to each other who are much closer in age than she and her husband Janos.  Benet is skeptical of Rukh's ability but is soon proven wrong.  Rukh has invented a kind or Ray/Time machine projector that allows them to see back into Earth's long past and see a meteor striking Africa millions of years ago.

The entire group is off to Africa to locate the meteor and the mysterious element known as Radium X.  Rukh leaves his wife and the rest of the group behind in the sweltering jungles while he is off with the native guides to try and find the meteor.  While he's gone the attraction between Diana and Ronald develops into a full-blown romance.  Janos finds the element and soon fashions an invisible ray that can literally melt solid rock but can be used for good if its power can be harnessed and remains in the jungle for further testing.  But the Radium X has poisoned Rukh.  In the dark his face and hands begin to glow and he soon finds his touch can kill within seconds.  Benet creates a temporary antidote but Rukh will have to take it for the rest of his life and Benet warns it could have negative effects on the mind.

When Rukh's wife runs off with Drake and Benet and Stevens take their own samples of Radium X., Rukh condemns them all as thieves and vows revenge.  He follows the entire group to Paris and then fakes his own death.  He then tracks them down and kills them one by one until the last few decide and set a trap for him.

While not a classic, The Invisible Ray, one of the last horror films of the initial horror cycle in the 30's, as a lot of strong elements.  The opening segments and Rukh's castle and the dark, story night are reminiscent of Frankenstein with plenty of gadgets and electricity machines.  Jack Pierce is the uncredited make-up man as well.  The film was directed by Lambert Hillyer who would also direct Dracula's Daughter, also released in 1936.  Karloff is a bit hammy as the mad scientist but that's what makes these films so fun.  Lugosi gets to actually play the good guy here as Dr. Benet who uses Radium X to cure blindness and other maladies and tries to help Rukh to no avail.  Solid Horror film.

227854,4,6300185885,"Universal Studios took time off from Frankenstein flicks and vampires long enough to produce this early sci-fi thriller.  Dr. Janos Rukh (Karloff) theorizes that a meteor of the nebula Andromeda crashed into the Earth eons ago.  After finding the meteor in Africa, Rukh suffers a fiendish transformation caused by contact with Radium X, a powerful element from outer space.  His body glowing with eerie special effects, and his mind frazzled by chemical poisons, Rukh sets out to destroy his enemies.  His very touch is deadly.  He is a grim angel of death in a slouch hat and a dark coat.  He leaves day-glow handprints on his victims.  He uses his ray gun (powered by Radium X) to melt a statue at a nearby church after each murder.  The complicated plot goes off in all directions, but holds the interest.  Karloff and Lugosi collaborated on many films, and this is one of their best.  Bela's three-dimensional portrayal of a brilliant but ambitious scientist blends the light and dark of the human soul.  He develops a counter-active drug for Rukh but warns him it is not a cure, only a temporary measure to ease the symptoms.  He warns that failure to administer the drug carefully will cause Rukh to crumble to ash.  Lugosi's slicked-back hair and pointed goatee makes him appear especially demonic, even as he heals children.  Viewers that recall Bela starring in an endless string of low-budget turkeys, looking old and tired, will appreciate him in his prime.  Karloff's frizzy hair symbolizes the scrambled brains of his character.  His trademark scowl hi-lighted by his tortured eyes effectively round out his portrayal.  Classic horror fun for kids of all ages. ;-)",1004486400,4,1677,4.932142857142857
227855,5,6300185885,"This is my favorite Boris Karloff - Bela Lugosi movie. Rukh (Karloff) learns to capture and project light rays from the past, not bad effects for 1936. He proves to Benet (Lugosi) that radium-x, 1000 times more powerful than uranium, is in Africa from a meteor that crash there years ago. Going to Africa, Rukh becomes poisoned by radium-x and everything he touches dies. Benet discovers an antidote but not a cure and eventually Rukh becomes a killer out for revenge, believing Benet and the party that went to Africa has stolen his discovery.

227856,4,6300185885,"Though it doesn't reach the heights of ""The Black Cat,"" director Lambert Hillyer's ""The Invisible Ray"" (1936) remains an intriguing Karloff-Lugosi vehicle with its offbeat mixture of horror and science-fiction. For both actors, it's a definite change of pace. Boris chews the scenery as the radiation-poisoned scientist, while Bela effectively underplays his part as the sympathetic colleague. The film might have been stronger if Karloff and Lugosi had switched roles. Nevertheless, ""The Invisible Ray"" survives as a memorable chiller and John Fulton's special effects are excellent.",970185600,14,584,5.8023255813953485

227891,3,6300185885,"The Invisible Ray, 1936 film

A scientist has a theory about an Invisible Ray. It is a dark and stormy night, Janos sits behind his telescope. Visitors from Europe arrive to this laboratory on top of the Carpathian mountains. They look at the Andromeda Nebulae (clouds). What effect will this have? The experiment begins. Can they see into the past? A meteorite crashes into earth! This happened millions of years ago. Can they recover this mineral from Africa? Janos mother tells him not to go. Victor Benet leads an expedition to Africa. A hand-held detector starts buzzing. News is sent back by a runner. Antelope stew again complains one man. Rukh demonstrates the power of his machine by destroying a boulder. But at night he discovers a side-effect from radium!

Will the others notice this? What happened to you? Diane will leave at daybreak. Rukh travels to tell Benet what happened; he now has a poisonous touch. What can Benet do? An antidote for radium poisoning is prescribed. It must be given every day to survive. Diana is told of Drakes love for her. Dr. Benet tells Rukh to stay out of the sunlight. This power can destroy a city. Can it be also used for healing? Rukh uses his ray to cure his mothers blindness. Rukh is awarded a Nobel Prize. He travels and finds a body double. The newspapers report on Rukhs death, a mutilated body only identifiable by his papers. Diana is married, Rukh watches from the background. Then he rents a room in Paris. Later people start dying, they were connected to that radium X-ray.

The killer left a mark on the neck, it only seen in the dark. Dr. Benet explains why he believes Rukh is alive and in Paris. The newspapers tell how a sacred image was melted! The group plans a ruse to attract Rukh to a lecture, then darken the room to make Rukh glow in the dark. Can Rukh find a way to enter a closed lecture? Does he plan to kill again? Can he be stopped? Madame Rukh attends. Then the lights go out! Rukh plans his revenge. Can his mother stop his plans? Will he make a misstep? Will there be a happy ending?

This morality play shows how power corrupts a good man and turns him into a badman. It is also a story about a womans love for a man who is not worthy of her (a mismatch in age). One interesting part is the mention of mining radium in the Congo. Later references to radium would be censored during WW II due to the development of nuclear warfare. This movie has scenes staged in Africa, unusual then. Does this refer to the hard way they discovered the dangers in radioactive substances? Didnt the Curies die of cancer from their experiments with radium?",1433030400,,2620,4.4978991596638656
227892,5,6300185885,"Karloff and Lugosi should have been given more opportunities to make movies together. This is not a typical universal horror movie more of a
scientist gone mad thriller. I collect all of the classic horror sci fi mystery movies so I will say this is a good not great movie. It starts off good
but slows down a bit when they go to the jungle and the annoying love affair between Francis Drake and the completely dull boring man she
falls in love with while being married to Karloff. Lugosi is restrained in his role as the 'good' doctor but gives a solid performance. He looks good
with his beard and slim frame. The middle and ending of picture pick up when Karloff starts knocking off those he feels betrayed him and the
ending is pretty good. It's a movie for all Karloff/Lugosi and classic Universal movies and anyone who's a classic movie fan.",1427068800,,847,4.5064935064935066
227893,4,6300185885,"On the one hand, this is a pretty creaky horror melodrama by any standards. It's certainly not the best pairing of Karloff and Lugosi, particularly in Bela's case. He's completely wasted in the role he's given, which could have been handled just as well by any number of character actors of the day. On the other hand, as well as some genuinely sinister moments, it's got a certain uniquely goofy charm to its 1930s-pulp-SF-meets-gothic ambiance. In fact, certain plot elements are distinctly reminiscent of H. P. Lovecraft's ""The Colour Out of Space"".",1425254400,,552,5.010869565217392

227896,4,6300185885,"Boris and Bela appeared in the same movie only six times. In one of them (Black Friday), they did not share a single scene, Bela ludicrously played a mobster, and Stanley Ridges, as the dual ghoul, stole the show from Boris. In another (The Body Snatcher), Boris dominated the picture while Bela again had a small, lousy part simply so they could put his name on the marquee. In yet another (The Raven) the roles were reversed, with Bela the main character and Boris thrown in to boost attendance. In ""Son of Frankenstein,"" Boris played a rather uninteresting, one-dimensional monster while Bela created an immortal character as the crazed Igor.

But in two movies, they each succeeded in substantial roles: the ultra-baroque ""Black Cat"" and the underrated ""Invisible Ray.""

I'm a bit puzzled by this release, though. ""The Invisible Ray"" has been and is available in a studio-produced multidisc set of 1930s flicks that costs about the same and includes the aforementioned Raven, Black Cat, and Black Friday, as well as Bela's ""Murders in the Rue Morgue.""",1363910400,,1055,4.954802259887006

7805217,4,6300185885,"Bela Lugosi can act! With restraint, flair, gentlemanly appeal (he sure does cut a fine figure in an evening suit) and intelligent wit!

KARLOFF as Janos Rukh almost steals the show. He does receive top billing and more screen time than Lugosi's Dr. Felix Benet. But I certainly enjoyed the glimpses of what could have been Bela's true potential as a dramatic actor. Sorrily Lugosi was pigeonholed and typecast despite his best pleading efforts else wise. Much is blamed on his thick (luscious) Hungarian accent, and his horror film persona that began with his legendary portrayal as Dracula - that, coupled with his addiction to pain killers - but I believe marketing / name appeal had a huge hand in that, stringing Bela along mercilessly to the bitter end.

Why cut off a cash cow simply to indulge the talented artist that may lurk within?

A ray is discovered and perfected by Janos Rukh. Dr. Felix Benet steals it and uses it for his own purposes. Janos' wife (Francis Drake) marries another (Frank Lawton) after thinking Janos is dead. Then all revengeful heck breaks loose. The film is a tad bit uneven, in some places unintentionally funny, but it does deliver in entertainment value.

Karloff is super cute in his perm and lisps profundities throughout. Bela imbues a dashing, melancholy air. The rest of the cast does what they're supposed to do.

One of the very best KARLOFF / Lugosi efforts out there.",1506988800,,1415,4.806584362139918
