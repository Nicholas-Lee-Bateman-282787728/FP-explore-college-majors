8284054,3,B001BP14E4,"I honestly watched this anime first before playing the video game and I hated it. When I first saw this anime, I WASN'T interested in the story. I heard of it before. A kid his his hometown gets invaded by bad guys, so he has to leave now or there will be more trouble. He has to go off with a band of people to find the one that is causing all the trouble. Sounds a lot like Dragon ball (NOT DBZ, just DB). Okay, boring.

The ignoring little kid like behavior is here. I really hate it. The boy, Shu, just doesn't like to listen to reasoning. He just goes off into a tantrum. Then, he gets mad at others without a good reason because he just stupid and immature. But, it is in some many animes. I guess, somehow, it just caught on and people just like to see it now or the writers really want to piss off the viewers. I don't know, I hate it.

I would had original give it two stars if I wrote this review the first time I saw it. But, since then, I played the video game and kind of liked it a bit. I liked to see the differences in the video game compared to the anime. There are many changes actually and it's refreshing to learn about them. I would prefer the video game's story line over the anime though. But since I beat the game, I guess I just sit back and watch the show now.

Update:

I should tell you all that this series actually never finished for the DVD collection. There is only vol. 3 and ends at ep. 13. This let's you basically feel out the series and see if you like it or not to continue.

I watched the whole series a different way because overseas the show actually did finish till the end. And, I watched it all. The story does get somewhat more interesting but nothing too great. Shu is as always very ignoring and won't grow up much.

At the end, I actually preferred the video game story much more. Both stories are good, but the video game story just seems more complete and made more sense. The game pretty good if you can get passed the first 2 discs and play hard mode because normal mode is wayyy tooooo EASY!",1333238400,,2090,4.197007481296758
8284055,1,B001BP14E4,"I don't mean to deter people from an Akira Toriyama anime such as ""Blue Dragon."" However, with awful dubs which could have been ripped off of a Pokemon anime, ""Blue Dragon"" just didn't cut it for me.

And even if the anime was good in its original subtitle format, the ""Blue Dragon"" looks like just another Dragonball clone.

Like I said, I really don't mean to deter anymore from watching this, but the 4Kids-style dubs are TERRIBLE. If anyone wants some good family-friendly anime from Akira Toriyama, just watch the original ""Dragonball"" series.

Not ""Dragonball Z."" Just ""Dragonball."" Just anything except for this.",1231632000,2,619,4.990291262135922
8284056,4,B001BP14E4,"If you are a fan of the animation style of Akira Toriyama, you really need to see this series.  Toriyama, of course, gained worldwide fame for his Dragon Ball manga and anime series, but his creations go far beyond that, creating such manga as Dr. Slump, and being the character designer for the Dragon Quest and Chrono Trigger video game series.  Toriyama is something of a national treasure in Japan, and anything he puts his name on is sure to sell millions.  So it's with this preface that the anime series for Blue Dragon hits these shores.  Based on the Xbox 360 game of the same name, and developed by the ""holy trinity"" of director Hironobu Sakaguchi, designer Akira Toriyama, and musical composer Nobuo Uematsu (all of Squaresoft fame) this anime retells the basic storyline of the game, but with added exposition.  For example, the beginning of the game starts with a land shark attack, and quickly moves into the main storyline, whereas this series sets up the characters more, then shows their hometown being attacked by the evil armada, before the lead discovers his ability to summon his dragon.  Overall, an excellent series from Japan that retains the game's light atmosphere while displaying the beautiful designs of Sensei Toriyama.  A definite must buy for fans of his manga, anime and game designs.

EDIT: I had to deduct one star because this English release from Viz Video has chopped the anamorphic widescreen format of the original Japanese broadcast, to a lame fullscreen edition (to save money I'm sure) which sucks for hardcore fans.",1218931200,6,1560,4.904942965779468
