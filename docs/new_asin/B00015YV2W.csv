8006925,5,B00015YV2W,"Ed Ratke thinks outside of the box but he isn't unrealistic. The film keeps normalcy while also taking us on an adventure. Maurice Compte put a lot of emotion into Freddie. When his Uncle asks for money we can see how hurt our broke the young man is. Freddie comes off as a nice person who is overwhelmed with a future baby coming. We can tell that he will come home but he shouldn't be running either. I never thought he was a dead beat, he just needed to clear his head.

Paddy O'Connor was very natural as Albert. They were both young kids but the character has a darker side. He is a kleptomaniac, which may come from abandonment issues with his Mom. He is too trusting. Freddie is an ok mentor but Albert could of ended up picking a pervert to go with.

Spoilers: Freddie and Albert form a brotherhood but its not a fairy tale. At first Freddie tries to avoid Albert but they bond in time. The ending heals Freddie at least.",1376438400,,929,4.2727272727272725
8006926,1,B00015YV2W,"Putting it simply ... I was BORED STIFF by this movie. I had trouble staying awake. I had to keep rewinding it to view the scenes I missed. It was stupid, pointless, and the end just did not justify the means. The younger dude had no redeeming qualities and the older one --- well, he had none either. All they did for the entire movie was TAKE and RUN. Literally!

They took advantage of nice people; I especially felt sorry for the (possibly) mentally impaired guy whom they forced their way into his car. He was on his way to a peaceful day of fishing. He was very nice to them. These idiots pushed their way into his car and the nice man drove them to his fishing spot. Then they stole the man's car and left him standing alone at the fishing spot wondering what just happened. I was hurt for him.

Also, the older convict dude is obviously too old to play a juvenile delinquent.

I hated this movie and I'm kicking myself for watching it.",1286755200,3,943,4.286516853932584
8006927,5,B00015YV2W,"Anyone that takes a chance on this little known independent film will be transformed even if only for a short time. It is difficult to not relate in at least small measure to this story and the characters, who despite their flaws, are endearing. The previous reviewers did an excellent job summarizing the plot of this film that I can add nothing more than to encourage a viewing of The Dream Catcher. The acting and directing are superb. You will not be disappointed. I own the DVD and have watch it multiple times.",1260057600,,516,4.559139784946237
8006928,5,B00015YV2W,"The Dream Catcher is an excellent film.  It is the story of two young men; each in a desparate search for family.  There is really no hope for these two characters except for what little they can create for themselves.  Freddy is on a father quest, he's essentially seeking out his own nature.  His journey is motivated by the upcoming birth of his own child.  Freddy is quiet and reflective, removed from the world.  On the road, he meets Albert,  who is younger, hyperactive and looking for his mother.  Headed in the same direction, they become travelmates.  Albert can't help his bad behavior and tests Freddy's nerves around every corner.  Freddy spends his time brooding and trying to keep Albert in line.

Watching this movie, my feelings grew quickly for these characters and as much as I wanted a positive resolution grown out of friendship, it was clear somewhere in the middle of the film that my best case scenario had lost all footing.  This is an emotional story that lends a voice to the profound importance of parents and family in the lives of young people.  Formally this film is very strong and I would recommend it to anyone.",1133136000,6,1145,4.665
8006929,5,B00015YV2W,"In the past week, I have seen ""Man on Fire,"" ""The Punisher,"" ""Mean Girls,"" ""Laws of Attraction"" and ""The Godsend""
in the theaters.  I then caught the totally unknown independent feature ""The Dream Catcher"" on DVD, after I picked it up at the local Fry's without knowing anything about it, except the description on the box.  Who would have thought the best movie I have seen this week, and probably since ""Mystic River,"" would be this thoroughly entertaining and profoundly moving road movie featuring two young, unknown actors and a no-name director.  In short, ""The Dream Catcher"" (not to be confused with the awful Lawrence Kasdan-Stephen King horror film of the same name) is one of the best films I have seen in a long, long time.
The plot is simple: two teens, one running from a pregnant girlfriend and one from juvenile authorities, meet on the road and forge a tentative and gradually deeper friendship while they travel to Reno in search of a better life.  They couldn't be more different:  Freddy (Maurice Compte) is a quiet introvert and the much younger Albert (Paddy Connor) is a loud, hyperactive motormouth who obviously suffers from ADD.  They hop trains, they steal cars, they hitch rides, but mostly they fight and irritate each other until they fall into a predictable and comfortable rhythm with each other.  I won't give anything else away except to say it is all incredibly moving and at times funny--all the way up to the rather predictable, though appropriate, ending.
This is an absolute triumph for director Ed Radtke, who, based on the great visual look of the film and the excellent use of locations between Philadelphia and Reno, deserves a chance at a big budget studio project.  And the acting is uniformly excellent, including every well-cast supporting role, and especially the leads: Compte, who is touching and compelling, and the incredible Connor, who is absolutely sensational as a boy whose hyperactive manner masks a deep and profound inner sadness that at the end just may break your heart.
The best thing about DVD (aside from introducing the widescreen format to mass audiences) is that hard-to-distribute festival winners like ""The Dream Catcher"" can find an audience and quite possibly gain the respect that they deserve.  And hopefully we'll be seeing much more of these actors and this director in the future.  They certainly deserve it.",1083974400,16,2385,4.969849246231155
8006930,5,B00015YV2W,"The Dream Catcher is a movie about two runaways both on the run for different reasons. Freddy ,played by maurice compte ,has a pregnant girlfriend and decides to run away and see his father who he has not seen in years. albert, played by paddy connor, is a juvenile deliquent who runs off to go to veags to find his mom. the two meet and strike up a friendship going together on the road. and as it is a road trip, they meet many different people from a guy in the military to a christian couple. the end of this movie is truly heartbreaking because you feel for these characters, even though you know how it will end. Ed radtke did a good job at directing this movie. the music is also well done as is the acting by maurice compte and paddy connor. it was neat watching this movie because i grew up in dayton where most of this film was shot. and seeing the locations like the dayton library reminded me of my hometown. i hope this movie gets the attention it deserves.
P.s. I am the guy at the end of the movie who is pushing the carts in the store which albert steals from.",1079308800,4,1076,4.177884615384615
8006931,5,B00015YV2W,"The Dream Catcher, directed by Edward A. Radtke, tells the story of two young men (boys really) who feel a pressing need to stay on the move. Freddy (Maurice Compte) is running from his pregnant girlfriend in Philadelphia with a vague hope of connecting up with an until recently incarcerated father he has not seen in a decade. Albert (Paddy Connor), an escapee from a juvenile home in Ohio, is heading toward Reno where his estranged mother supposedly owns a restaurant in which he believes he can get work and come in out from the cold. Neither has any money, nor any real family to speak of, and both are living by their wits as they cross America's vast midlands by whatever means they can manage. Although they hitchhike, jump aboard freight trains, and steal a ride or two, at times it almost seems as if they propel themselves forward by dint of highly elaborated fantasy about the future and a desperate desire to be rescued from the gnawing alienation they experience in relation to just about everything except each other. Freddy gets through the days on the road by assuaging his limitless reservoir of emptiness and rage with the help of a good deal of marijuana while Albert relies on a manic defense against his intolerable feelings of worthlessness and despair. He is also an inveterate kleptomaniac. Thus the pair provide an interesting counterbalance to the river of desolation which flows through them and which is mirrored relentlessly by the disconnected physical and human landscape through which they travel. After a number of entertaining, at times devastating, adventures en route to the 'promised land' of the American West, the boys finally reach Utah which Albert describes as being like another planet. But rather than having reached their collectively desired destination of longed for parental protection and love, another fate awaits them entirely. The only fate they could have actually expected to encounter given the emotional undertow established early on in lives characterized by severe trauma, loss and deprivation. I had the opportunity to screen The Dream Catcher as part of Sundance Channel's New Voices series which showcases first time film makers of exceptional promise. As with all the other entries in this splendid set of psychological dramas, I was thoroughly engaged by Radtke's disturbing, utterly revealing film from its auspicious beginning right through to its sad, poignant close.",1071964800,9,2435,5.105263157894737
