THE STORY--
A scientific expedition is sent to Cambodia. Their mission: find and destroy an ancient formula that instantly changes men into mindless zombies. Armand Louque translates an inscription and realizes he's located the formula. Experimentation on an unwitting subject turns him into a human automaton, so Louque declares to an empty room that he is now the most powerful man in the world!

(3.1) Revolt of the Zombies (1936) - Dorothy Stone/Dean Jagger/Roy D'Arcy/Robert Noland/George Cleveland (archive footage: Bela Lugosi)",1255996800,2,1625,6.012987012987013
1901129,3,B0000A0DVI,"The word `zombie' is thrown around a lot in this film titled Revolt of the Zombies (1936), and it made me question if the term was being used properly, as I always associated it with regards to reviving and maintaining power over the dead, perhaps through a ritual, or some such manner...well, there were a few definitions (including one for a tall drink made of rum, liqueur, and fruit juice), and one did specify `One who looks or behaves like an automaton'...which is pretty much how the word is used this film (zombification by means of hypnosis), as opposed to reanimation of corpses through that voodoo that you do so very well...co-written and directed by Victor Halperin (White Zombie), the film stars Dean Jagger (X the Unknown), Dorothy Stone (Savage Fury), and Robert Noland, in his only big, or small, screen appearance.  Also appearing is Roy D'Arcy (El Capitan Tormenta), George Cleveland (The Devil and Daniel Webster), and E. Alyn Warren (Tarzan the Fearless).

The beginning of the film is a little confusing, but the gist is during the first world war there was a regiment of French Cambodians, hailing from the lost city called Angkor (or somewhere there abouts), that appeared on the Franco-Austrian front and proved to be impervious to death by conventional means, fighting like they were robots.  The allies learn of this, and also of the existence of a priest, the last in a long line of those familiar with the ancient art of turning men into zombies, or mindless automatons who will do their masters bidding.  Seeing as how the priest won't give up the ghost, they decided to imprison him, as the secret is too dangerous to fall into enemy hands, but someone has a more permanent solution, if you get my drift...upon learning the secret of the process may be located in the lost city of Angkor (which seemed awful easy to find, being a `lost' city and all), the allies form a international expedition featuring General Duval (Cleveland), his daughter Claire (Stone), Armand Louque (Jagger), Clifford Grayson (Noland), and a Colonel Mazovia (D'Arcy), among others.  They manage to find the not-so-lot city, but locating the secret is a bit more difficult...and dangerous.  During this time Armand falls in love with Claire, but she only has eyes for Cliff.  She agrees to marry Armand, but only as a means to provoke Cliff into action as it turns out Cliff loves Claire, but Armand had gotten to her first, or some such thing...anyway, Claire gives Armand the old dumparoo, which leaves him a shell of his former self, that is until Armand accidentally stumbles upon the secret of making zombies, something he then puts to use in order to obtain that which he desires most, the backstabbing Claire, by creating a virtual army of zombies to do his bidding (seriously, he goes on a hypnotizin' jag, giving the whammy to everyone in sight)...soon Claire and Cliff become suspicious, but it may be too late, as those around them are under Armand's fiendish control...

I was a little disappointed with this movie, primarily because I was hoping for a little of that old black magic that made the Halprin's Brothers 1932 release titled White Zombie, starring Bela Lugosi, one of my favorite non-Universal horror films from the classic age of horror films, but it's missing...replaced by a huge, honking hunk of melodrama...bah...an admirable effort, but one that missed the mark, for me at least.  What really annoyed me was the one halfway interesting character of Colonel Mazovia had so little screen time, and not a whole lot to do with the story, which sort of went against the impression of importance I got from the story early on...oh sure, he was so sinister as to be a cartoonish caricature of evil (leering eyes, pencil-thin mustache forming into a goatee, always dressed in black, and constantly slinking about) but he was, at the very least, more interesting than most of the other characters presented.  You see, he, too desired the secret, and had quite the convoluted plan to achieve his goal, one that relied a little too much on uncontrolled factors, in my opinion...and I'll tell you what, the lead characters weren't all that likable, especially Armand who becomes a real egotistical a-hole once he learns the power to control men's minds, driven by an obsession to obtain something he can never have...I suppose one could make the argument that he was ultimately a sympathetic character, caught up in delusions of grandeur, a puppet to his own desires, but that'd be a tough sell, from where I sat.  And then there's Claire...what a peach she is, using her engagement to Armand solely as a ploy to get with Cliff...oh yeah, she's a keeper...dames...can't live with `em, can't kill `em (legally, at least)...and I didn't understand why she was along in the first place.  Yeah, she was General Duval's daughter, and he seemed in charge of the expedition, but she had no real purpose other than being a pretty plot point...the story is fairly straightforward, but tends to jump forward in a startling and confusing manner at times...a perfect example is near the beginning when Armand meets Claire and we see his almost immediately infatuated with her...while, in the same scene, we see her drawn to Cliff.  Right after this there is a scene with Armand and Claire celebrating their engagement...how in the heck did we get here from there?  Ah well...the performances were adequate, possibly (but unlikely) hampered by an overly talkative script...check out how proper and erudite Armand becomes after imbibing in the intoxicating juices of his newfound knowledge.  And if this was the best Ms. Stone had, I'm really not surprised her career petered out after only two more films.  One aspect I liked a lot was the sets, which were much better than the story deserved in that they created a creepy and spooky atmosphere just waiting for the appropriate material.

The full screen print on this Alpha DVD release looks really decent, and comes across clear, despite obvious signs of age (missing frames, lines, etc.).  The audio is decent, and I had no problems making out the dialog.  There are no special features, but there is a visual depiction of other Alpha DVDs.

By the way, if you're wondering about my title for my review, whenever Armand would use his new power, a large set of eyes, meant to be Armand's, but really belonging to Lugosi, was superimposed on the screen.  This effect was taken from Halprin's previous film White Zombie (1932), which is really worth checking out, if you're a fan of early horror classics, as this was how Bela Lugosi's character created zombies...",1120694400,2,6639,4.887900355871886
1901130,3,B0000A0DVI,"Dean Jagger (yep, the loveable old colonel from White Christmas) plays a man who loses his fiancee to his best friend. Does he just roll over and give her up? No way! He does what any red-blooded american guy would do, he goes to Angkor, discovers an ancient hoodoo secret, and builds an army of killer zombies (these are mesmerized, living folks, NOT living dead flesh-eaters)! Roy D'Arcy tries to stop him and steal the secret, but is dispatched rather quickly by one of the zombie horde. Remember, ROTZ is mostly a love story with some ""zombies"" sprinkled in here and there. Don't expect WHITE ZOMBIE 2 (even though Halperin directed it as such). It's more of a love story than a horror movie. Just when our zombie meister gets his zombies together, he lets them all go free! All due to his love for the gal who dumped him in the first place! Sheesh! Well, at least the de-zombified (ex-zombified??) minions come after Jagger's character during the climax. So, it's not a total loss, but don't expect a masterpiece...",1112227200,2,1020,4.6722222222222225

7995496,5,B0000A0DVI,"This is an MST laugher that would make Ed Wood proud. Long before there were WWII Nazi zombies, there were WWI evil Buddhist zombies. These aren't the raise from the dead, foot dragging zombies, but rather simple mind controlled zombies impervious to bullets.

In Cambodia and expedition is under way to find the secret to the zombies and destroy it. Filmed in a studio with terrible backdrops, the scenery was as bad as the over dramatic acting with exaggerated gestures, and door slams/openings left over from silent films. Col. Mazovia (Roy D'Arcy) plays a French Rasputin who wears his ribbons on his civilian attire. In fact the ribbons were kind of light on all the military men considering they were at war. On the trip, Armand (Dean Jagger) gets dumped by his fiancee (Dorothy Stone) for Clifford Grayson (Robert Noland) who has a more manly name. He also gets fired.

The scary aspect is when they impose Bela Lugosi's eyes on the screen from ""White Zombie."" Ooooohhhh Scarrrrry. The native Khmer dancer was comical in that her moves as clearly the music and motions were not Cambodian. The local tongue speaks 3 words which gets translated into 2 long sentences.

I laughed through much of the film, for all the wrong reasons, especially the death scene at the end where Dorothy Stone takes her clenched fist and dramatically lifts it to her forehead. How can you not laugh?",1368921600,2,1384,4.80672268907563
7995497,4,B0000A0DVI,"A lot of viewers dislike this film, and although it's rather slow and confusing I still find it enjoyable on several levels.
1) The setting, WW1 Cambodia and the lost city of Angkor which holds the secret of Zombification. The sets look impressive being both creepy and appropriately mystifying.
2) The love triangle. Usually I hate this plot device in which the hero wins back his girl after some cad has led her astray. But there are no heroes here. The shy hero-type becomes an egotistical power hungry maniac once he discovers the Zombie Secret. And his backstabbing, dirty, double-dealing girlfriend and best pal rightfully deserve whatever they get dished out. Sadly, it's not enough.
3) The acting is pretty good all-round for such a low budget quickie, Dean Jagger being exceptionally good as the confused and betrayed Armond Lougue. You actually begin to feel sorry for the poor sap, until he snaps and becomes a control freak with his newly formed Zombie horde.
4) The Zombies are not the living dead type that populated Victor Halperin's previous hit WHITE ZOMBIE(1932), but a sort of mesmerized lot that do one's bidding by mental suggestion via Bela Lugosi's superimposed eyes left over from the previous film. This leads to some tacky cheapness, but it's precisely that quality which makes these low/no budget gems so enduring. So, in a goofy sense, I actually found the film's many faults working in it's favor, enjoying a chuckle here and there, yet all too aware of what this could have been if just handled with a little more care and production value.

All said, I enjoyed REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES. It was a pleasing hour or so of neat sets and Zombie nonsense. Just don't compare it to WHITE ZOMBIE or take it too seriously and you'll be ok with it.

And the ALPHA DVD print is very good, nice and clear, one of their better offerings, a bargain at such a low price.",1358380800,4,1883,4.720364741641338
7995498,2,B0000A0DVI,"is sort of a sequel to White Zombie. The director is the same for both movies and he reuses Bela Lugosi's eyes to show when the zombies are under control. The eyes float over the image of who is being controlled.

That's where the similarities end. This story begins in World War I. An Asian priest offers them a secret formula to turn men into zombies, who would be the perfect soldiers. After a demonstration, the Allies decide this is too horrible and imprison the priest for life to prevent him from using it. The French representative decides he wants the formula, so he sneaks into the prison, kills the priest, and takes the partially burned cloth showing where the formula can be found in Cambodia.

After the war ends, a group of Allies (including the French bad guy) heads to Cambodia to find and destroy the formula. One fellow brings his daughter who instantly sets up a love triangle. Most of the film is focused on this triangle. One of the guys discovers the formula before everyone else and uses it to get the girl.

I found the film a bit disappointing. The atmosphere was all over the place (sometime it was light drama, sometimes it was a romantic drama, sometimes it was eerie, but hardly enough for a movie about zombies) and the zombies are basically hypnotized living people and not very scary. The story meanders around and a lot of stuff seems just thrown in to make the movie longer (like the native Cambodian woman dancing for the group).

The video transfer is not too great and the audio was very muffled, which seems typical for less famous movies from that era.",1343779200,,1592,4.575438596491228
