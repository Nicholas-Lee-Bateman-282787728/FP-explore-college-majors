3046326,5,B00104AYKG,"I give this movie 5 stars because I am a sword and sorcery and ancient history nut. I would say that the gold standard for Viking movies is probably "" The Vikings"" starring Kirk Douglas and Tony Curtis. Using that as a top notch Viking Movie to judge others by ""The Last of the Viking's"" pales by comparison. But I have recently discovered the Cameron Mitchell trilogy and love Them. But I love it for what it is Good B-rate movie entertainment, meant mostly for those like myself that must have all things sword and sorcery or historical action oriented ei. lots of violence and sword play with a descent story line. If your looking for a big budget block buster you will not find it here. What you will find is a hour or so of fun escapist fantasy to fill your time on some crappie winters day or stormy summer afternoon. If purchased for the right price you might want too give it a go. If your wanting another 50's 60's epic film with big name stars and glorious cinematography with hundreds of extras all in Technicolor then stay away. If your looking to bulk up your sword and sandal collection and can excuse some over acting and a low budget by all means pick it up. At the price I got this DVD it was worth the cover art alone. Beware the transfer is sad but watchable.",1372636800,6,1278,4.329166666666667

Transfer was made in zoom mode, i.e. Images are cut off on edge of screen so heads are sometimes out of picture edge on tight close up shots.  Was hard to watch and I really wanted to see this film.

8236989,4,B00104AYKG,"The original wide screen is cropped and the action scenes have more pulled punches then saltwater taffy.

The audio is terribly muffled, the video blurry (like watching a bad video under water), but nothing can hide one of the most remarkable, over the top, performances that one man has ever put to celluloid.

The poster child for chewing up the scenery must go to Edmond Perdom in the role of bad King Sveno

His spineless, sadistic, prissy, mincing, snarling, highly stylized characterization is  like a  cross between Caligula and Richard the III projecting to the nose bleed seats in Yankee Stadium.  Or maybe it's  a Richard the III swagger with a Lady Macbeth hand rub accompaniment.  Or maybe its ancient silent film villain acting.  Did Edmond not get the message that sound had been added to film by the time this was made? Curious. .

As I watched, I kept trying to figure out who this character reminded me of?  it suddenly hit me. Rowan Atkinson!!! Could Edmond's performance and appearance be the source point for many of Rowan's characterizations.  See for yourself.

Five powerful stars for Edmond Purdom's very unusual and absolutely entertaining performance minus 3 ordinary stars for the everything else thats wrong with the film, equals 4 stars.

The movie is free on Amazon Prime Video and looks awful",1456790400,,1323,4.900900900900901

8236994,1,B00104AYKG,"Production values = awful. Lousy acting, even the cliches are cliche. British captain sees Vikings and calmly enunciates ""They are Vikings, m'Lord""... almost in slow motion. The crew calmly walk to their battle stations, the captain calmly enunciates ""prepare for battle""... ""pre PAY ure for BAT tel."" Um... nobody seems afraid of Vikings, or maybe the actors were hungry and it was almost time for their lunch break. This is as far as I made it into the film.
STREAMING: an unknown amount of the film was cropped away. The film is streamed in 4:3 aspect. The colors were terrible, the audio was ridiculous. Ugh.",1424390400,,612,4.838095238095238
