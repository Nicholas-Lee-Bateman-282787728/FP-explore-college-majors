5132686,3,B0085A9JPO,"I had heard a lot about this movie and being a Robert Donat fan, was looking forward to it.  However, in finally viewing it, the story line seems a bit rushed, disjointed and not as well developed as it could have been had the running time been about half an hour longer.  Deborah Kerr and Glynis Johns, in an early role, also have featured parts.  Still, all in all, I'm glad to have seen it.  The print quality is acceptable for a post WW II movie that has not been remastered and cleaned up.",1313452800,6,494,4.223404255319149

5132698,4,B0085A9JPO,"An entertaining WWII movie. I wonder if it served as effective propaganda at the time. The Clemence Dane script definitely attempts to convince viewers of the wonderful benefits associated with enlistment. Glynis Johns is fun, and Robert Donat and Deborah Kerr shine.

5132699,5,B0085A9JPO,I caught this on t.v. a few weeks ago and realized I had never seen it before. I just loved the story and the two stars looked so young I knew I wanted to see it again so was very happy to see it listed on Amazon.

5132704,2,B0085A9JPO,"I gave this movie to my sister because,  it was too boring in my opinion to keep my interest; and she likes this movie.  This movie is an old black and white film with a married couple who part for a number of years during the war.  They are dull in their looks and their life together, before they part. Then, they reunite to talk about divorce and are pleasantly surprised to see how each other has changed.  I thought this sounds really good, but found myself too bored watching it, even when they meet again later.",1434585600,,518,4.309278350515464

5132707,5,B0085A9JPO,"This film is a delightful blend of comedy, romance and drama.  It is smart and as relevant today as it was in 1945.  Robert Donat was such a great actor and Deborah Kerr is very believable as Donat's wife Cathy. Glynis Johns plays Cathy's best friend, Dizzy.  I am not going to reveal the plot so as not to spoil things.  It is a wonderful movie.  I bought it after I viewed it on Amazon Prime.",1427328000,,394,4.131578947368421
5132708,4,B0085A9JPO,"I viewed a documentary of Robert Donat and was curious about his other work. This is a little gem of a movie. The kind that use to play on the Late, Late Show.

5132712,5,B0085A9JPO,"Wonderful...A Real Gem.  I loved this film. It is a simple story set during WWII, but so well acted with a great cast, Robert Donat, Deborah Kerr and Glynis Johns.  I rented it and immediately watched it three times.  The dialogue is clever and fun and it is definitely a romantic movie without being corny. I love old British films.  This one is as much fun as the Powell/Pressburger film, ""I Know Where I'm Going"".  Another gem to see!",1414713600,2,437,4.481012658227848
5132713,4,B0085A9JPO,"A flick about WWII that features a very young Deborah Kerr. Not a bunch of gore or mayhem, this film is focused on the people involved in service and the challenges and opportunities war brings to their marriage. The 'vacation' is not a release from vows as much as it is a release from stifling habits so it does not offend the intention of marriage in the course of its story. It's one of a number of films I've discovered that attempts to engage the effects of separation on couples in the context of WWII. This one has a positive spin yet is obviously an effort to engage a subject that was affecting many couples at the time it was made.",1413158400,2,642,4.31404958677686

5132715,5,B0085A9JPO,"A terribly beautiful and profound film about the nature of love and also, life.  Why this gem is not given more attention and credit is
beyond me.  Mr. Donat's  mastery of phrasing, vocal tone and facial expressions is a joy to watch - perhaps the greatest British
actor of his generation.  We loved him as the justice seeking Count of Monte Cristo, the life affirming Mr. Chips, the clever Tartu
and then as Peter Oronoff/Fothergill who perseveres in rescuing the Russian Countess from the hell of war.  But here we see him as an ordinary ""common man""  (and Deborah Kerr as the  ""common woman""), who must learn an extraordinary lesson - the value of love.

 (It is unfortunate that the American title does not use the British title - Perfect Strangers.)",1407369600,6,754,4.694656488549619
5132716,5,B0085A9JPO,"I loved this movie when I saw it the first time over 50 years ago.  I still love it and am happy I own it so I can watch it again once in a while, even though now I know it was a ""rally-round-the-war"".film",1405814400,,205,3.659090909090909
5132717,4,B0085A9JPO,"This is a superb movie, something touching and very funny.  I do not know what more one might want from such fine craftsman as Korda, Donat, and Deborah Kerr. And, Glynis Johns too, in what might be her debut?

This is a movie with a real story, beginning with a married couple just going through the motions.  Then both join up for duty in WWII and each becomes a different person.  They do not meet for 3 years and each has decided they no longer want to go back to their old marriage.  What they don't know is that their spouse has also changed.  Does it work?

5132719,4,B0085A9JPO,"Silly title, good story of a husband and wife who have been afraid to say what they really feel, or even do small things beyond what they think the other expects, for fear of hurting the other, or being embarrassed, so both lead stifling lives.  I suppose that is old fashioned, but it probably still happens.  They are separated for three years by WW2, he in the British Navy, and she in the WRENs, so they have challenges to face, which changes what they expect from life.  They don't really know what the other has been doing, and assume the other is still the same boring person.  It does a good job with their physical transformation, and the confusion of their friends upon meeting each spouse for the first time is fun.  The ending is pat, but meant to be hopeful.  It's not necessarily original, but deals with what many couples must face after a long separation, and, the counterpoint of voicing their expectations followed by what actually happens is enjoyable.",1394323200,2,971,4.649122807017544
5132720,5,B0085A9JPO,"It starts out as an old married couple, or that's what it looked like in the beginning.

She becomes a military aid and works seending message while under fire so she grows up fast and while hanging out with all he soldier girlfriends that tought her how to dance and wear mack-up(oooo-My) After 3 Years when the meet again they are both suprised to see each other again and after some fighting about thing about the past they fell in love again

5132721,5,B0085A9JPO,"There are a great many delights in this movie.

Set in mid-WWII the story follows a very mousy English couple who both go off to the Navy and to war, and come out of their shells as a result.  After 3 years away, and much personal growth, they both finally get leave back home for the first time.  Each has decided that divorce is the only way to escape the humdrum of the spouse they remember.  When they finally set eyes on each other in a pub, each is surprised and shocked at the (pleasant) changes in the other.  But by this time they have painted themselves into the corner of getting a divorce, and it takes some doing to get to the final and inevitable clinch, the last scene in the movie.

The main characters Robert and Cathy Wilson are played by Robert Donat and Deborah Kerr.  Donat had had previous success in ""Goodbye Mr. Chips"" and ""The 39 Steps.""  Kerr was just starting her career, and went on to many roles including in ""From Here to Eternity.""  At the time the movie was filmed (1944), Donat was 39 and Kerr was only 23, but the characters were presumably in their mid to late 20s.  Kerr pulls it off, but Donat is a bit too wrinkled.  Oh, well, there was a war on!  A fine supporting role was given by Glynnis Johns, playing Cathy's best friend Dizzy Clayton.  Johns went on to roles in ""A Little Night Music"" and ""Mary Poppins.""

As I started off, many delights in this movie.  All the details advance the plot or give background, without seeming to.  The naval details were spot-on, including the boat drill on Cathy's launch, the battle scene on Robert's cruiser, and the (over) crowding of English trains at the time, among many other details.

The dialog is uniformly witty and well-conceived, with classic British understatement.  For example, when the reunited Robert and Cathy hear music in the pub, he leads her into a dance.  The surprised Cathy days: ""Where did YOU learn to dance?""  Robert:  ""Around and about.  One picks it up, you know....  Say, where did YOU learn to dance ??""  Cathy:  ""Oh, around and about.  One picks it up, you know!""  Delightful.

My only disappointment with the movie is that this version was cut to 93 minutes for US distribution.  The original release in the UK was called ""Perfect Strangers,"" and ran 102 minutes.  I wonder what was cut?  Alas, the British version does not seem to be available in any modern format.  However, the British Film Institute will let you view the original 35 mm film movie, if you show up in person!  Well, maybe someday...",1369094400,7,2513,4.513333333333334
5132722,3,B0085A9JPO,"From the standpoint of see Kerr's early acting, it was interesting to compare it with films such as From Here to Eternity.  You definitely see that special quality of being able to ""draw"" the viewer into her characteriztion.  I'm not a Donat fan, but admit that he does a good acting performance here.",1357603200,,301,4.660377358490566
5132723,3,B0085A9JPO,"This is quite an enjoyable movie, though I have to say that I expected it to be considerably better.  The promise of the plot did not quite materialise, and I did not think that Robert Donat, an actor I much admire, was ideally cast.  I shall watch it again, but if I do not consider it better on a second viewing, I fear it will be discarded.",1348790400,,343,4.104477611940299
5132724,5,B0085A9JPO,"Once upon a time MGM British Studios and Alexander Korda's London Films hooked up on what was assumed to be a multi-picture co-production partnership. But the partnership was done after one film, with Korda grabbing his toys and heading back to his back yard. That one film was VACATION FROM MARRIAGE, a 1945 romantic comedy that launched Deborah Kerr into bigger and better things. For years now I had been looking under every rock for this film. I keep missing it on the TCM network. So happy now that it's available on DVD.

Robert Donat and Deborah Kerr are fantastic! They play Robert and Cathy Wilson, a tepid English couple going thru the motions of marriage. Robert is a meek, punctual bookkeeper of delicate constitution. Cathy is plain and submissive and can't sseem to ever rid herself of the sniffles. In the spring of 1940, the war conspires to separate the two, with Robert off to the British Navy and Cathy unexpectedly enlisting in the Wrens (or WRNS, for Women's Royal Naval Service).

Nothing like a war to test one's mettle and to build up character. Robert and Deborah both undergo a startling metamorphosis. Freed from a listless marriage, the Wilsons separately blossom. During their three years spent apart, Robert becomes a war hero and, thanks to them impeccable British naval tailors, now cuts a dashing figure. Cathy, for her part, has asserted herself, having to make do on her own and having stumbled on the empowering attributes of lipstick and a stylish 'do and a wardrobe of undowdy dresses. She's even referred to nowadays as pin-up girl material. After a night out on the town, Cathy is heard to wistfully remark: ""...wonderful sensation to dance with the right man..."" You'll agree that she's not talking about her husband.

So three years elapse. Confidence immeasurably boosted, worldview expanded, and having even engaged in respective (and, I think, platonic) dalliances, Robert and Cathy at last manage to coordinate simultaneous leaves. And yet both dread the impending reunion. Not having seen each other for all this time, Robert and Cathy each believe that one had outgrown the other, that they have become strangers. They're in for a startlement when they finally catch up with each other and each notes the drastic changes in the other. I love the sequence in the pub when they finally glimpse each other in proper lighting and are astonished. But are they still compatible? Will they rekindle their romance? Is a Brit's upper lip stiff?

If you've a yen for an intelligent and skillful romantic comedy, look no further than VACATION FROM MARRIAGE. The sheer talent of cast and crew, a screenplay that won an Academy Award, and the timeliness of the film - which was shot during terrifying wartime conditions - made it a commercial success and a boost for British moral. There's weight to this movie. It's a thoughtful study of British resolve under extreme duress. It spotlights the Wrens and the contributions made by these dedicated service women. Kerr and Donat play off each other so well, especially in the squabbling third act. Husky-voiced Glynis Johns is adorable and very sympathetic as Cathy's best friend Dizzy. Johns actually upstages Kerr in that one street scene in which Dizzy's poignant reveal serves to quietly chastise a dithering Cathy. VACATION FROM MARRIAGE isn't bawdy or much of a screwball. The humor is more observational and understated. But there's a whiff of salaciousness to counteract that whiff of sentimentality. Mostly, the narrative is believable and the issues handled with delicacy. Those nighttime scenes wherein Donat wanders the bombed-out streets of London are so evocative. I think I love this movie. I even like the rather subdued ending (no impassioned reconciliation here). And where else can you hear someone use phrases like ""blonde g0lliwog"" and ""I don't give a hoot in Hades!"" as colorful expletives?",1344816000,19,3895,5.015455950540958
5132725,5,B0085A9JPO,"I have been waiting for decades to have this film available again.  The transfer to DVD is not stellar, but certainly watchable and the audio is passable.
I refer to this film often in my work with couples beginning marriage therapy.  The film displays three great myths about marriage:
1) When people marry, they pick a partner who is perfectly suited to them.
2) As people grow and change, their partner will simultaneously grow and change - in the same direction, and to the same extent.
3) When people have finished growing and changing, their partner will again be perfectly suited to them!
This is what everyone hopes for, and sometimes it actually happens, but it is certainly not guaranteed.  It's a nice cautionary tale at the beginning of a therapy.
The movie also explores the power of perceptions and presents this so well in the friends of the protagonists shocked reactions when they meet the people about whom they THINK they have heard so much.
A surprise for me watching it now after so many years, is the movie's displaying the seeds for change that were always present in the couple, but had never been mentioned by either for fear of rejection or hurt.  Again, so common in relationships.
But what about the movie as a movie?  I have to talk about the two stars, Robert Donat and Deborah Kerr.  Robert Donat was always one of my favorites - his good looks, the sound of his voice, his keen intelligence and his underlying decency and honesty.  But Deborah Kerr is more of a revelation.  Her combination of beauty, intelligence, class and vulnerability makes for a stage presence so powerful, it's like looking at a sculpture of Michaelangelo.  Kathryn Hepburn may have been the pioneer in beautiful, intelligent women that foretold women's liberation, but Deborah Kerr in her quieter way, has to be right up there.  What a delight!",1318896000,18,1851,4.774294670846395
5132726,5,B0085A9JPO,"This is one of my favorite WWII films. It's a story of a rather drab, boring married couple in England, who, at the onset of the war are separated as the husband goes into the service and the wife (Deborah Kerr) decides to do the same. Their war-time experiences transform each of them. To say more would be to spoil the enjoyment of this film. Do not miss seeing this fine movie.",1317772800,8,380,4.291666666666667
