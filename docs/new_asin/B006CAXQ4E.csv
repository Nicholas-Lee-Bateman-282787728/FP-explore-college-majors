8496396,5,B006CAXQ4E,"I was actually looking for a film version of this great play by Lope da Vega, but since there was nothing to be had with English subtitles, I came upon this danced version of the story created by the great Antonio Gades dance company.  If you simply look up the plot synopsis of the play, you can understand the story through this ballet that uses a lot of Spanish folk music and flamenco style.  It is simply breath-taking!  The ballet leaves out the scenes from the play that take place at the court of Ferdinand and Isabella in favor of focusing on the love story and the conflict between the evil Commander and the town of FuenteOvejuna.  This is a true story, by the way.  If you do know the play, then by all means, get this film and be astonished!",1431734400,2,754,4.319148936170213

8496398,5,B006CAXQ4E,"This has been something of a second, very exciting, adventure for me and follows on from my first purchase of this series of three - that of Carmen. That production was so gripping that I immediately ordered this - and I have not been disappointed. If anything, I would rate this as even finer still.

This was the last story that Gades choreographed/produced and dates from 1994. It is based on a play written by Lope de Vega nearly 400 years ago which tells of a true event in Spanish history and from which this creation takes its name. The story is about the abusive misuse of power and privilege of a commander to take advantage of the vassals in his `care' during feudal times. Finally the abuses become so intolerable that the villagers rise up and kill him with their farming implements. At the following enquiry all the villagers, despite the use of torture to extract confessions, stick to the explanation that the village killed him. As it was not possible to apportion blame on a whole village, the village was pardoned and spared further persecution. Gades chooses to end it at the point when the commander is killed and natural justice is served.

Despite my misgivings about 'enjoying' what is both obviously and fundamentally a very unpleasant story, I need not have worried. This is because the over-riding nature of the villagers is shown to be that of a happy supportive community and this situation informs by far the majority of the stage time. That, of course, makes the scenes featuring the commander even more darkly threatening by contrast and highly effective.

As in the Carmen production what strikes one is the extraordinary degree to which this example of the flamenco art is able to extend the rawness of the emotional impact. This encompasses a wide range of emotions including love, tenderness, happiness, pride, anger, hatred etc. I cannot think of a relevant parallel experience with which to compare it in terms of danced drama.

Some background may be of help at this stage: Gades, as a young man, studied classical dance as well as all the Spanish popular dance idioms. This dual interest and skill enabled him, uniquely, to fuse together the two art forms of ballet and flamenco. He believed that flamenco must also be shorn of all extraneous distractions in order to bring the essence of the dance to light. At this early stage he was also providing the choreography for classical ballet such as Bolero, Carmen and El Amor Brujo for companies such as La Scala. From 1981 he formed the collaboration with Carlos Saura, the film director, which resulted in some of his flamenco-based creations being filmed. These films had an enormous effect on ballet companies around the world and Gades became very influential in this way while continuing as a ballet dancer in Giselle for example.

The majority of the music is pure flamenco in style and is a compilation of the work of several collaborating contributors who worked closely with Gades who was very meticulous in his demands in every way. Guitars, solo singers and clapping plus a range of strident medieval trumpets add startling authenticity to the sound. Precision dance to group multi-rhythmic clapping has to be seen to be believed!

Although the story is very easy to follow in general terms, I am sure that I have failed to pick up or begin to understand many of the more subtle underlying meanings in the flamenco choreography - also, subtitles would have been invaluable in the frequent sung parts. However, I cannot see any reason to deny this the full 5 stars. Anything less would be my fault for failing to comprehend fully or properly. The recording is all you could wish for and there is a bonus in the form of interviews with members of the team. The sleeve notes are particularly informative. I personally would highly recommend this issue as an unforgettable experience and essential guide to a dramatic art form.",1341878400,7,3922,4.820208023774145
8496399,5,B006CAXQ4E,"Had it been any other production, I would have berated this blu ray for the lack of subtitles. I thought I had made a mistake and would be disappointed... but NO! In fact, the production is so beautifully done that you really understand whatever they are singing - and I do not know a word of Spanish. The dances bring those words that are not understood by me totally alive. What is more, the continuity is simply superb. That is what Brilliance is all about. In fact, I am almost glad that there are no subtitles.

The video recording is as good as a blu ray should be. About the sound recording, I will comment later in this review.

The disc comes with a well written booklet and description of the whole story, a true story on which Lope de Vega based a play on, around 400 years ago about abuse of Power by a Commander in Spain during those dark feudal ages and about a community rising up against him, led surprisingly, by women of a village wherein the villager folk are abused and women molested.

Antonio Gades brought this story to life in the theater, wherein the whole is played out in mostly various hues of Flamenco encompassing different styles in Spain, sewn into a seamless beautiful production in 1994. This was his last spark before he died. He also incorporated the music of Mussorgsky (Catacombs from the 'Pictures at an Exhibition') for the description of the Commander's authority and character.

I would like to add here, a couple of flaws that may amount to nit-picking, but are fairly noticeable.

1. The sound is badly balanced as a sequence. Although the recording per se is quite good, You can easily 'feel' the fade-outs in many sequences that is a bit irritating. To add to this, the orchestra playing the Mussorgsky Catacombs 'seems' to come out of hidden speakers behind the settings and sounds very truncated when compared to the rest of the audio in the production. I wonder why they had to resort to this. It is like the old 'normalization' or 'auto-level' kind of a thing from piece to piece, although each piece is left alone to its own levels.

2. Although, as I mentioned earlier, lack of subtitling does not really matter, I feel that there could have been a small bonus piece for even around 10 minutes that may have given a little more insight into the production, which I repeat, is brilliant. The whole work is only 1 hour 40 minutes, and there was ample space for this little piece about the performers, production and some interviews as well (with subtitles of course).

All the same, I would DEFINITELY RECOMMEND this disc to just about anyone. The beauty of the world of Flamenco has never been so wonderfully brought forth...",1332115200,10,2676,4.609243697478991
