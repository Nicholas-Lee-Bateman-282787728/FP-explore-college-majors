8067949,5,B0009W84AC,"Outstanding documentary footage, interesting interviews, and an addition to our knowledge and understanding of this element of the sad tale of Russians out of Russia.",1454803200,,166,5.68
8067950,5,B0009W84AC,"Produced through a joint project between a well known Russian actor/director (Nikita Mikhalkov) and a French emigre group, it is a narrative history about the final days of the White anti-Bolshevik forces in the Russian revolution and the evacuation by General Wrangel of the white forces and many civilians from the Crimea.  The second part covers the Cossack forces and families and the Eastern exile of many through Siberia as well as the subsequent Russian cultural settlements in  Harbin (China), France and  Yugoslavia --three places where a large Russian community was reestablished and Russian cultural traditions were maintained.  Through film fragments and interviews with a number of &eacute;migr&eacute;s in France, the United States and other countries, the video covers the tragic fate of thousands who were forced to leave Russia in the revolution and were dispersed to countries all over the world. The descendants of a number of key figures who were at the center of the maelstrom are brought in to tell their stories of exile and settlement in a foreign land. Although the commentary is in Russian, the English subtitles allow those who do not know the language to see into this tragic story of revolution.",1452470400,,1224,5.166666666666667
8067951,5,B0009W84AC,Great history of the post-revolutionary Russian diaspora.  This film attempts to address for the Russian audience what it has lost.,1449273600,,131,5.55
8067952,5,B0009W84AC,Given as a gift to a friend who loves Russian history.  The DVD was a hit with our friend.  The documentary material was well done and accurate.,1322179200,3,144,4.296296296296297
8067953,5,B0009W84AC,"It is indeed refreshing to see a balanced view of a little known subject of Russian History.  This documentary fills a very big void in that arena.  I wish that more documentarys like this could or would be done in the future of the unlimited stories held in Russian History which is so very rich and deep. The need to learn and see the correct versions shown to the world of Russian History as it truly happened are severely lacking. I absolutely loved watching this DVD set and will recommend it to anyone interested in Russian History. It was hard to see at times, but also very enthralling. It brings the viewer into the lives of these people who sacrificed so much and lost so much for generations. Not having lived through it or walked in such shoes I know I cannot fully appreciate the depth of this historical drama of the 20th Century.",1299888000,6,844,4.474025974025974
8067954,5,B0009W84AC,"My grandmother and grandfather were among those who were evacuated from Crimea under Gen. Baron Wrangell. I heard her stories all my childhood. How he saved thousands of Russians and how she escaped the Red Terror that followed when the Reds swept into Crimea under Bela Kuhn (Moritz Cohen). Seeing the brief newsreel footage of the evacuation of Crimea brought tears to my eyes. I keep looking through the crowds trying to get on board the ships-maybe I'll glimpse my grandparents. Very powerful stuff.

I also remember her mentioning how Greeks would take rowboats to the quarantined Russian naval vessels in Constantinople and offer bread and food for a diamond ring to the starving White Russians on board. In this video, exactly this story is told by a survivor-only they got two cups of water and an orange for a precious ring! So much for Christian charity.

Another very powerful story is about the sale/disposal/theft of Russian naval vessels that sailed to Tunisia. Two brothers on opposite sides of the Russian Civil War. Neither one wanting to see the other. Very sad. One was the last White naval commander, the other was a Red naval specialist sent to inventory the Russian vessels in the early 1920s by the Soviet Union.

I would highly recommend this series.",1259107200,12,1274,4.888888888888889
8067955,5,B0009W84AC,"It's an excellent documentary about Russian white army officers in exile.  It will bring you to tears (if you're Russian) to see their strength of character, dignity, and pride for and love of their country.  Seeing examples of such strength and spiritual development is very uplifting.  I highly recommend it.",1255910400,14,310,5.16
8067956,5,B0009W84AC,"Mikhalkov does a great job, however, he is ignorant in his conclusion of Ike supporting sending Russian soldiers captured back to USSR.

1 - Really not Ike's power to decide, but even if were,

2 - I believe he tried to prevent returning them to Stalin.

3 - I'd be glad to look at any evidence contrary to my positon, but have NEVER seen any such.",1204502400,2,348,4.242424242424242
8067957,5,B0009W84AC,"This is very hard to watch, but it finally says the truth about the white russians, their love for Russia, their sufferings, and their hopes. Many original news clips. This is a must see.",1154908800,12,187,4.529411764705882
