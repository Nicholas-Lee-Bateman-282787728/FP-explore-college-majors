531073,5,6302970423,"This version of a great novel has a straight-forward screenplay, and is much easier to follow than the many circumlucations of the book's narrative. The story of Pym's father's childhood is dropped and the first of three chronolgoically presented Pyms, the child, is a bit too strange though clearly manipulative. The second Pym is a good actor without rating a wow. But the actor playing the mature Pym is great, and the second half of the filming is something very special indeed.

  The movie covers many years, and a viewer should realize this is for the most part a slowly paced internal drama, and not a Bond-like adventure film.

  It is also NOT a film for children or teenagers.

  The film is very tough emotionally - life in this film is definitely not sugar-coated: women are especially badly treated. The main subject is human betrayal of friends, family and finally oneself.

531176,1,6302970423,"My husband and I really enjoy British films. This series, however, was very taxing on our ability to sit through it. Hubby kept falling asleep and I poked him into consciousness to stay tuned. We could go for days without looking at the next episode because there wasn't much to compel us to keep watching. I just wanted to see where it would go and hoped it would get better.

There was absolutely no action; instead the focus was on disjointed vinettes that left us guessing that something must have happened behind the scenes to bring us to this moment. The characters were not well developed and their interactions were feeble as well. I

It was so poorly written and directed that we never learned to care about any of the characters; even the bad guys in well written and well acted films can engage our sympathies if the actors are given the opportunity to develop the characters into something substantive. Instead, there are great jumps in time and place and ""events"" that leave you wondering about the story and the message.

It wasn't even a Spy story. I can only think that this was more about the psychology of parenting and what happens to an individual brought up in the wrong environment from an early age and whose very survival is learned from the adults around him. Early betrayals as a child developed our main character into accepting betrayal as an artful way to achieve success; although he was not fully conscious of this acting out until much later when he becomes obsessed with the excitement of getting away with his betrayals? That's my take on it, anyway!

A Perfect Spy really fell flat and was very anti-climactic. We didn't care in the least about what happened to our protagonist or his ""wife"" and supposed ""friends"". John Le Carre's character did not even win our sympathies as his world was unraveling. Oh, well, back to a script re-write? Hated it!",1368921600,4,1884,4.682779456193353

having to ally himself to his father who is an incorrigible con man and feeling bad for but ultimately having to hate the ones who his father had victimized;

having to hide and shun his father to rise in the eyes of society;

having to betray a friend to get a job;

betraying a job to re-ally himself with the friend he had betrayed;

531221,5,6302970423,"I'm pretty sure that ""A Perfect Spy"" was the first John le Carr&eacute; novel I ever bought and read.  It had to have been at least twenty years ago, so my memory is a bit fuzzy; but I believe that this was my introduction to le Carr&eacute; in written form.  (I had previously seen at least a couple of movies and a TV miniseries based on some of le Carr&eacute;'s other novels; but this was the first one of his books that I actually read.)  Since then I have read most of John le Carr&eacute;'s other spy novels; and I consider myself a fan of his work.  But it's been a long, long time since I've read ""A Perfect Spy""; and I had forgotten most of the details of the story.  So, to be perfectly honest, I can't really say how closely this miniseries follows the plot of the book.  As I was watching it this past weekend, the characters and storyline seemed familiar, but only vaguely so.  Oddly enough, I never saw this miniseries when it aired on TV back in the early 1990s.  (It was a BBC production; but it was rebroadcast in the US as part of the PBS series ""Masterpiece Theatre"".)  In fact, I didn't even know that this miniseries existed until I came across the DVDs here on Amazon.  I'm glad I finally got to watch it.  (Better late than never, I suppose.)  As I said, I don't recall how closely it follows the book, but it definitely has the ""feel"" of a John le Carr&eacute; story; and, as a fan of le Carr&eacute;'s work, I found it quite satisfying.

This seven-part miniseries tells the life story of Magnus Pym, the son of a con man who grows up to become a spy.  Beginning in Pym's early childhood, we see how his unusual upbringing shapes his character, turning him into a charming liar with no moral compass and a gift for getting people to trust him.  This is what ultimately makes Pym the perfect spy.  We watch Pym grow up and see how his unique life experiences ultimately lead him into espionage.  But we also see how the ghosts of his past affect the choices he makes in the present.  John le Carr&eacute; writes realistic spy stories that are complex, layered, and deep.  His stories are really about people, and why they do the things they do.  It just so happens that the people he writes about are spies.  They make interesting characters because they inhabit a shadowy world of secrets and lies, where the normal rules of moral behavior in a civilized society don't apply, and it's often hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys.  The thing that sets le Carr&eacute; apart from other writers of spy fiction is the way he captures, and subtly critiques, the moral ambiguity of the world of espionage.  He doesn't give us noble heroes and dastardly villains.  He simply gives us people -- realistically imperfect human beings -- all of whom are morally compromised in one way or another.  This is what we see in this miniseries.  If you're looking for mindless action in the style of James Bond or Jason Bourne, look elsewhere.  This miniseries is slow-paced and cerebral, with very little violence or action of any kind.  It's simply not that sort of spy story.  It's really not about the art of espionage at all.  Instead, it's an in-depth character study of Magnus Pym and why he did the things he did.  It's fascinating from a psychological standpoint; but anyone who watches this expecting it to be some sort of fast-paced thriller is likely to be bored to tears.  I should also point out that it does contain some brief nudity and strong language (though not a lot of it), which some viewers might not be comfortable with.

If you're already a John le Carr&eacute; fan you should definitely get this.  If you're not already familiar with le Carr&eacute;'s works, several of which have been made into movies (including ""The Spy Who Came in from the Cold"", ""The Russia House"", and ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy""), then the only thing I can say is that I think it's a great story that's worth watching; but it's definitely not for everyone, especially those with short attention spans.",1335139200,4,4016,4.516620498614959
531222,5,6302970423,"This was my favorite of all the John Le Carre DVD's.

It was exciting and kept my attention every minute.

531223,4,6302970423,"It took me a while to warm up to this series and get it.  Up to nearly the end, I thought it was too slow and convoluted.  It takes a deep look at the spy's psychology:  his father was a charming con man, either in the money or broke, even in jail; yet he always resurfaces, even to run for parliament.  The boy is ashamed of him, loves him, feels guilt and responsibility towards him and never free.  It is pathetic, yet his recruiters for ""the firm"" think a little crime in the family is a fine thing.

The young man inherits the charm of his father and is apparently talented, at least if admission to Oxford means anything.  He proves adept at gathering information discreetly, rarely regrets his betrayals, to the point that it is clear he is the same kind of sociopath his father is = he marries women he doesn't love for ""cover"" and eventually compromises himself because there is a need inside him that cannot be fulfilled.  (I reveal nothing here, for his journey to this is what is important.  It is subtle and complex, as we expect from Le Carre, and it is not spelled but must be interpreted, which is one thing I love about European film.)  He is seduced and makes a career that makes a mockery of his colleagues and indeed the entire intelligence service.  Of course, it works itself to a terrible crisis, not at all what one would expect.  The spy, Pym, disappears, but the look of nervous exhaustion is unmistakeable and, I thought, believable.

Though I found it difficult to understand what exactly the spy was supposed to be doing and what he did, it is revealed slowly.  Perhaps too slowly.  It does work very well in the end as a drama, but it may lose many viewers before the climax.  Recommended.  This is not as good as Smiley's People.",1334620800,,1760,4.433021806853582
531224,4,6302970423,"This John Le Carre story of A Perfect Spy is more about the man, Magnus Pym than spying. Set in Europe shortly after World War II, Magnus manages through school and into the British army as an officer. While executing a covert task he meets Axel, an old European acquaintance from his boyhood. Magnus is taken more by the friendship than by Axel's purpose or character. After the army, off to Cambridge law college, and then into the British foreign service. Axel becomes a regular in Magnus' life and begins running him for the purpose of acquiring government secrets for the Czechs.

Magnus grew up in the absence of a mother or a paternal image. What was worse his father is a well-liked confidence trickster, always talking his way into and out of situations. Magnus develops this trait into his own personality, but clearly, Magnus is always weakened in father's presence.

Three DVD discs contain seven episodes. It is generous entertainment, but by no means the quality stories as Tinker Tailor or Smiley's People.",1326412800,3,1021,4.862068965517241
531225,2,6302970423,"I chose this series because I wanted to see how the Le Carre novels were filmed -- starting with Tinker, Tailor (a masterpiece of acting and direction).  But Perfect Spy doesn't work well.  Ray McNally is excellent and more nuanced than one might expect.  But the two actors at the center of the story -- Peter Egan and Rudiger Weigang, both solid actors -- don't work at all.  They're awkward at best.

It's not their fault.  The direction seems pretty poor.  The framing of the shots is often lazy.  The story edges along gracelessly. To carry off a character study of this kind, a director needs to be very creative and able to work closely with the actors.  No sense of that here.

Too bad! It's a great story that deserves a great film or -- as in this case -- series.",1319846400,2,773,4.380281690140845
531226,5,6302970423,"Very well acted, makes your brain spin and whirr, a good adventure. This is a original series, unlike any other movie I have seen",1315353600,,129,4.416666666666667
531227,5,6302970423,"I can't say that I loved this series as much as the Smiley series, especially the ones with Alec Guiness.  This is different, as others have mentioned.  It is not as much about the intrigues of the spy business as it is the internal workings of one man who is caught up in the business.

I hadn't realized that Le Carre had had a background similar to that of the main character, Magnus Pym, until I read it here.  That gives another dimension of pathos to the story.  It would be interesting to me to know just how much of Pym's story was similar to LeCarre's.  Of course we'd all like to know if LC actually passed information to the Communists but we'll probably never know that.  Mostly I wonder how deeply the pattern of deceipt and betrayal that did-in Pym was operative in LC's life.  At any rate LC survived and did very well with his life---that's a happy ending.

I thought the whole production lived up to the usual excellent BBC standards.  I loved the choice of Peter Egan as Pym.  His very good looks and natural charm made a terribly touching contrast to his inner life.  He has an almost childlike ability to be affectionate, as seen most strikingly in the last scenes with the landlady, that just break your heart.  The relationship to Poppy is very remarkable too.  This story will stay with me for a long time....probably more than the Smiley stories.",1261526400,3,1370,4.493927125506073
531228,1,6302970423,"I like old films, and I don't like the frantic pace of many modern films. However, this television series is extremely slow. It is a psychological portrait of a spy, so the actual ""spy elements"" of the story are totally secondary. As such this film will not really appeal to friends of (realistic or unrealistic) spy stories. The topic is bleak but the whole direction is bleak as well. I would say one-sided bleakness, i.e. no captivating spy subplots, not uplifting sidestories, no jokes. Just bleakness. If you want something along these lines, go ahead and buy the set. The other reviewers can attest that the adaptation has some qualities.",1254528000,7,644,4.863636363636363
531249,5,6302970423,"As a fan of author John le Carre I've slowly been working my way through both his books and the adaptations of them. I found this 1987 adaptation of le Carre's masterwork originaly at my local library before I eventually bought this DVD and sat down to watch it thinking I would know what to expect. I was surprised to discover that my expectations were exceeded in this miniseries, a fine cross between a spy thriller and a human drama.

Peter Egan gives a great performance as Magnus Pym, the perfect spy of the title. Carrying on in the long tradition of le Carre's strong main characters, Pym is also quite possibly the best. Egan plays Pym (who in fact contains many shades of author le Carre) as a man forced to spend his entire life lying and betraying sometimes out of circumstance and other times just to survive with the consequence of him becoming ""a perfect spy"". Egan plays Pym to perfection as a man always on the run, if not from others then from himself. Egan alone makes the six or so hours of this miniseries worth seeing from his performance alone.

Surronding Egan is a fantastic supporting cast. Ray McAnally gives one of his finest performances as Pym's con man father Rick who (as le Carre has said) is based strongly on the author's own father. McAnally plays a man who comes in and out of Pym's life and is one of the those responsible for Pym becoming ""a perfect spy"". In fact if it wasn't for McAnally's performance a year after this in A Very British Coup this would the finest performance of his sadly too short career.

The rest of the supporting is excellent as well. From Caroline John as Pym's mother to Alan Howard as his spy mentor to Rdiger Weigang as the young Pym's friend turned controller to Jane Booker as Pym's wife the supporting cast is fantastic. Special mention should be made of the three young actors who played the younger Pym (Jonathan Haley, Nicholas Haley and Benedict Taylor) who establish the young man who would become the man played so well By Peter Egan.

The production values of the miniseries are strong as well. As the miniseries adaptations of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy and Smiley's People proved these stories can only be told in miniseries format. The locations are excellent from the English locations to the those scattered across Eastern Europe and the USA as are the sets by Chris Edwards. The cinematography of Elmer Cossey adds an extra layer of realism to the world of the miniseries. Yet the highlight of the miniseries is really the script.

Screenwrtier Arthur Hopcraft tackled the job of adapting the six hundred or so page novel excellently. The novel was largely (at least in its early parts) autobiographical in that Pym's early life echoed much of John le Carre's life. The script for this miniseries is no exception as it traces the development of Magnus Pym from young boy to ""a perfect spy"". Never once does the miniseries deviate from its purpose of telling a fine human drama in the context of the world of espionage. If one ever wants proof that a spy thriller can be tense and fascinating without ever having one gun fight, fist fight, or James Bond style car chase this would be the proof. While the miniseries is six plus hours long it never wastes a moment and it all the better for it.

Though it might be overlong for some for those who don't have very short attention spans here is a must see. From the performances of Peter Egan and Ray McAnally to fine production values and a fine literary script A Perfect Spy is one of the finest miniseries who can expect to see. It is a fascinating trip down the history of the Cold War yet it is more then that. It is also a trip down what John le Carre has called ""the secret path"": the path of the spy the man who must lie and betray to survive. As much a human drama as a spy thriller A Perfect Spy isn't to be missed.",1241049600,9,3857,4.4950071326676175

531251,4,6302970423,"'A  Perfect Spy' is quite simply one of the most captivating literary works I have read in my 51 years. The Machiavellian and cruel deceit and opportunism exercised by Ricky Pym is traced with such a masterly pen that his characteristics and mannerisms remain indelibly imprinted on my mind these many years. Hardly surprising maybe, as this is one of those rare treasures I continue to read again and again. But even the colossal corruption of Ricky cannot dominate this work: every character is fleshed out and impelled with Shakespearean or Dickensian skill into the mind of the reader; every character fascinates, and repels or delights. One feels in many respects that the world of Ricky Pym, his  family and Faginesque entourage is indeed the corrupted offal on which the intelligence community feeds and thrives. So much for the book...

The TV series could never live up to this without capturing every scene and line from the book, for no line or scene can be omitted without damage to the exquisite tapestry of interrelationships and sub plots that is its essence. So yes, sterling performances from all players, but Oh! To see the whole thing.  Nevertheless, this series is highly recommended.",1231718400,7,1204,4.975124378109452

  Why this movie costs us $50+ in the U.S. when it's maybe $20 in the UK, however, is beyond me.

531254,3,6302970423,"""A Perfect Spy"" was the third of Britisher John LeCarre's cold war spy novels to be filmed for television by the British Broadcasting Company.  As they generally did at that time, they threw money at the screen: script by the talented Arthur Hopcraft, who'd previously done the honors for the same author's ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy,"" and ""Smiley's People;"" location filming in glamorous places, extras and cars galore.  Yet it's just not the same ""must-see tv"" as its stablemates.

Magnus Pym, played by Peter Egan, is here the perfect spy, double-dealing with zest.  We are apparently supposed to think he's like this because his father Rik(Ray McAnally, who died soon after filming was completed) was an outside-the-law confidence trickster who enjoyed his work, and maybe that is enough to explain the son's behavior, who knows.  It's certainly noticeable that most viewers will not find either main character particularly likeable;whereas Rik and his troops seem at least always to be having a good time, Magnus is portrayed as being a nasty little boy from the beginning.  Interestingly enough, we must assume this material is intensely personal to its author.  He's described his own father as a conman, and both author and his character Magnus have studied and worked in the German-speaking world.  In fact, he's repeated these elements in several books, as he's repeated the seaside hideout, even the nickname ""Tiger,"" here, used by father to son; in ""Single and Single,"" the conman father is called ""Tiger"" himself.

So why doesn't it work?  To begin with, it's seven episodes, the riveting ""Tinker"" and ""Smiley"" are only six.  And the other two series have many sharply-drawn, memorable characters, plus attention-grabbing plots.  There are many fewer characters here, they're not nearly as flavorful, and the plot, especially as it's a downer, doesn't really seem to need so many episodes.  Furthermore, aside from McAnally, and Dame Peggy Ashcroft in an important supporting role, the Beeb seems to have stinted on the leading and supporting roles.  Many of these actors are just not as expressive as they could be.  A lot of viewers might find they are tempted to forget that third disk.",1172534400,13,2202,5.111731843575419
531255,5,6302970423,"This mini-series is based on one of the most complex books I have read - dealing extensively with the inner demons of a man on an inexorable path to self-annihilation.  I am happy to note that this mini-series does a superb job of translating the story from the book to film.

Yes, allowances have been taken - I don't think one could have made a film of this book without taking such allowances.  Purists will object, and I'm sure each of us can find fault in some of the choices made, but these choices, by definition, are very subjective.  As a whole, on its own the mini-series stand as a brilliant achievement - a great character study of a man's loss of his own character as he descends into dark abysses of continuous duplicity.

Peter Egan, a surprising choice for the role, does an outstanding job in the title role.  A number of users have commented on how inappropriate he is for the role.  I disagree, and again, I think the problem is the subjectivity of the subject.  So much of the movie is based on his inner feelings and it is hard to convey that to the viewer.  Some might prefer a more robust expression of his inner turmoil, but that does not really fit well with the character.  I think, his more subtle approach is much more engaging and truer to what I imagined in the book - of course, others may have imagined differently and for them this may become a problem with his portrayal.

Overall an outstanding adaptation of the Le Carre book. Be forewarned that, just like the book, it is long and deliberately slow moving and may not be for everyone. Very little 'action' as such, but an exceptional character study of what makes a 'Perfect' Spy. There is a certain sadness which permeates the film, and becomes quite powerful at the end. Highly, highly recommended for those who prefer thoughtful, deliberately paced movies.

a guy came from a con artist parent, at first looked smart when he was young, then after he completely became a grown man, he seemed to lose all the wits and merits and turned out to be a stupid and naive so-called spy. well, le carre's novels were all like this, all the english intelligence organizations were nothing but wimpy, dim-wit in the game of the cold war. the worst of this mini series was that only the guy who played the perfect spy aging from volumne one to volume 2, but all the years his father, his father's peers, his superior, his controller, none of them ever looked older. nothing changed actually. this was very bad adaptation from a very bad novel. i just don't and can't understand what in the world that any sane reader would have found le carre's spy novels intriguing, nor could i understand how and why in the world his novels would inspire the movie producers to adapt his novels into lame, bore-to-death, dreary and long movies one after another, again and again. espionage like this, in this way? by god, indeed was nothing just child play, don't you think?",1158278400,7,1152,4.511961722488039
531257,2,6302970423,"The Good: Ray McAnally's brilliant performance as Rick Pym, the main character's conman father.

The Bad: the miniseries oversimplifies the narrative by giving us Magnus Pym's story along a single time line, from boyhood to adulthood. The novel works on two time lines; the first one follows the search for Magnus Pym who has disappeared and the second one follows his reminiscences of his life as he hides in a seaside hotel. The book jumps back and forth, and while the US, UK, and Czech secret services are all looking for him, we are wondering why Pym went into hiding and why he seems scared and relaxed all at once. In the miniseries, we don't much care about Magnus at all. The only thing I cared about was when would Pym senior reappear.

The Ugly: Peter Egan as Magnus Pym. Completely wrong. In the book Magnus Pym was very much like his father, seductive and charming, which is why he was such a successful spy. In the mini series, Pym is unimposing and weak. It's difficult to believe he can convince anyone to trust him.

Very disappointing. Apart from McAnally, Rudiger Weigang as Pym's college friend and Czech contact gives a hammy but good performance. For diehard LeCarr fan only.

Trivia: McAnally played the Pope's envoy in ""The Mission"".

531258,5,6302970423,"This John Le Carre adaptation is almost as good as Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, there's no legendary performances here but the screen play by Arthur Hopcraft and a strong cast make it a pleasurable viewing experience. The suspense and understanding the psychology of a spy builds through each episode and for such a slow paced film at times it really is surprising edge of the seat stuff. Just a quick note on Peter Egen, at first i had trouble not picturing him standing next to Richard Briers (Everdecreasing Circles) but once you get over this initial shock by the end you realise what good job he does for the part and that he is actually a rather splendid actor.",1141257600,19,665,4.5966386554621845

7833564,3,6302970423,"I bought the Region 2 DVDs from an overseas Amazon, just for reference. I found the series (7 episodes of a bit less than an hour each) slightly tedious. One cannot help comparing it to the astoundingly good Tinker, Tailor and Smiley's People with Alec Guinness.

Peter Egan is no Alec Guinness. I think the problem lies more in the script, though. It is a spy movie, or one would think it is a spy movie, but there's hardly any actual spying in it. Just a lot of jibber-jabber about spies and spying. I can recall one scene where the main character Pym enters an office surreptitiously and photographs some documents. Anticlimactic.

The aforementioned Smiley miniseries were more like mystery stories, gradually unraveling as Smiley collects evidence and connects the dots. Perfect Spy trudges along, from one era of the man's life to the next, one deception to the next, until it reaches its ignoble end.

Perfect Spy plays more like a biopic, about a spy who's not terribly interesting. He's devious, of course, which we are to presume comes from his background. Does he have any redeeming qualities? Not so much. It was hard to find any character in this menagerie to root for, especially. No major characters that were endearing at all.

Not much mystery. Not much suspense. Few if any likable characters. Maybe three stars is generous.",1506816000,,1342,4.821739130434783

7833567,4,6302970423,"This review is for a NEW ""PAL, Region 2 (Europe)"" version purchased from Movie Mars.  CAUTION:  your DVD player must be able to play Region 2 DVDs (the US is Region 1) AND must be able to support the PAL format.  As for the story line:  other reviewers have thoroughly covered it but let me emphasize: in the DVD, the story line is straightforward, from earliest date to the end date, essentially taking the viewer through the life history of the perfect spy.  It is pretty easy to follow the story, except, as others have noted, the occasional sudden jumps forward in time.  The book is written differently, jumping back and forth between the ""life history"" and events that are happening now.  It is often difficult to tie everything together.  Before you watch this DVD, go to Wikipedia and print the 7-episode synopsis for this DVD; it will help a lot!  OK, the technical details.  I have read the book (first), watched the US (NTSC, Region 1) DVD (second) and now the European (PAL, Region 2) DVD.  (I have equipment that can play PAL/Region 2 DVDs.)  The picture quality is better on this European version but, because of the age of issue, is nowhere what we expect from DVD.  It shows more like a VHS tape recording!  (Most likely, the US version was made by re-encoding the European version; picture quality suffered in the process.)  Reading the book was a very tough slug for me; difficult to follow.  Le Carre, the author, is often praised and admired but can be difficult to read.  I found that watching the DVD cleared up many details I could not figure out from the book read.  Now, like the rest of those difficult-to-read books, I need to go back and read the book again!",1503273600,,1686,4.5633333333333335

7833570,4,6302970423,"There are some novels, especially American best-sellers, that are quite cinematographic, written as movie pitch. I cannot think of a book less cinematographic than any JLC's. Nevertheless, almost all his books made to the big screen and some became BBC miniseries. His books are not easy. They are not scene by scene. They are multilayered, multidimensional, not up-close, hard to digest. So I like to watch these movies to see the characters in flesh and bone and the locations. It is ironic that despite enormous challenges, JLC''s books adaptations are highly successful.

I saw this series just after finishing the book. I am now od'd of Pym and co. My first reaction was the same as when I saw the two other BBC series from the Karla trilogy with Alec Guinness: It is truly amazing that they even tried. Just for that, they got my respect. And the fact that they actually nailed it, made me respect them even more. This is really unbelievable.

Having said that, they were most successful on the Karla trilogy than the Pym one. Maybe because those stories were better. Maybe because they had Alec Guinness. Or maybe the Karla trilogy was more epic, so more dramatic. ""A Perfect Spy"" is slower, full of nuances and open questions. Almost like a sad fable in a sense.

Ray McAnally (Ricky): He steals the show. It all moved around him.

Rdiger Weigang (Axel): An annoying Axel. Boring, uncharismatic, secretive. When I read the book, I didn't understand what Pym saw on him. The series reinforced that.

Alan Howard (Jack Brotherhood): Also an annoying character (not an annoying performance). I met a few Brits in real life that talked just like him. Jack was a RAF pilot in the war. Alan's Jack had this peculiar British military hardline personality. John Wayne speaking like Prince Charles. Alan probably had fun with this character. He was quite compelling.

Peter Egan (Magnus Pym): A boar. But maybe that's how Pym was. A great match to Axel. I don't think it was an accident. It is probably quite a challenge for an actor to portray someone that could be dismissed.

Jane Booker (Mary): The character was just convenience. Jane's performance was very subtle. We could hear Mary's inner-voice.

They captured the spirit of the novel. The director also helped. There are plenty of close-ups. We became intimate.
Seven episodes with roughly 50 minutes each, give us almost 6 hours to tell the story. They shifted things around a little bit, but they gave us 85 to 90% of the book. A big loss worth calling out: There is no Lippsie. Some dialogs were copied from the book. The book was so over the edge that the dialogs were just one more element of that global haze. When they moved that to the series, it sounded contrived.

Read the book and watch the series. Don't do the other way around. I am glad I watched. But I don't think I would have gotten any value from it, if I haven't read the book.",1438128000,,2906,4.682352941176471
