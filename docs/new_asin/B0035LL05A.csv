After about a year of practice Im ready to take on challenges this DVD offers.  Theres a range of difficulty within so I can attempt at least the easier challenges at this time, and its nice that these are the songs I remember back when.  This DVD will help the beginner move on to another level of enjoyment and it does a nice job of demonstrating the requirements. Im excited about learning Bar Chords, (ouch!) and yes Im tackling the easier Wild Thing first. Five Stars Again for Hal Leonard",1508025600,,661,4.483333333333333

8389122,5,B0035LL05A,"I have been playing guitar for about 8 months now and have been learning from dvds at home (Keith Wyatt ""Getting Started on Electric Guitar"" and John McCarthy's Rock House dvd's). So I know some techniques now, and with this Guitar Play Along: 60's classics I can now use those beginning/intermediate techniques in real songs. I have tried some of the other Play Along dvds and books, but the songs are too hard to play all the way through (specifically the solos). This is one is a good fit for someone at my level.
Song by song, here are the skills that you need and will practice:
Cissy Strut: single notes groove in c pentatonic and a few chords
The House of the Rising Sun: arpeggios of open chords, strumming in 6/8 time
Proud Mary: open chord and barre chord rhythm, solos in d pentatonic contain slides, hammer ons,and chicken pickin'
Surfin' U.S.A. - rhythm using 10 bar blues structure
My Girl - Bar chords, (you also learn how they use a key change in the middle of the song; that was new for me)
Wild Thing - power chords, very simple
Pipeline - (surf guitar) palm muting, single note melody in e minor
No Particular Place to Go - probably the most challenging piece on this dvd. Augmented chords, Chuck Berry blues/rock licks in g pentatonic, the solo is pretty fast for a beginner/intermediate player. Lots of bends and slides.",1333584000,5,1341,4.568464730290456
8389123,5,B0035LL05A,"I bought this product for my dad because A) this is the kind of music he listens to and B) I'm tired of hearing him play the same songs over and over (and over!). He enjoys the song selections on it, but says you have to be more than a beginner to use it.",1308700800,3,255,3.740740740740741
