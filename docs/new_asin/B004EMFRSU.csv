8427222,4,B004EMFRSU,"I have used everything in this kit except the VCR tape.  My mistake but I just assumed that it would be a DVD.  It is the 21st century.  So I will need to get the VCR tape recorded to a DVD.  I am sure there are people that can do this.  The paint brushes are nice, the watercolors okay not top quality and I am a beginner but my paints are better, have not used the paper, illustration book small and great to pack up with art supplies and the palette was a nice surprise.  Gave 4 stars because of paint quality and a 20th century VCR when most homes do not have a VCR.",1349308800,,570,3.9130434782608696
8427223,3,B004EMFRSU,i had read the other review prior to my purchase and would have been less impressed paying the higher price. but the lower price with the paint and video and brushes i am not feeling bad about it. the brushes are very nice . love watching frank clarke on pbs . having fun is important .,1335571200,,286,4.125
8427224,3,B004EMFRSU,"The video was ok, thought it would be more involved than it was as I paid quite a bit more than the current asking price last year, but this kit is worth it just for those ""obedient"" brushes alone! Shoulda waited but needed the obedience then. Gonna stock up now 4 future:) Have Some More Fun!
Peace",1326326400,,299,4.2631578947368425
