5358275,5,B009OD8XQC,This was such a great show! Levin bacon and James purefoy are pure gold together and their scenes together are totally enthralling! As for the violence. I was expecting a lot more the way people were complaining about it. It wasn't that bad at all just as much as csi or law and order. Thrilling and entertaining a recommended watch!,1358812800,4,333,4.566666666666666
5358276,1,B009OD8XQC,"No matter how many glowing reviews you may read from desperate television viewers grasping at straws in search of a decent new series to latch onto and watch every week, trust me, if you've already seen the Gerard Butler film, ""Law Abiding Citizen"" you've already seen this done before. You've already seen it done better. You've already seen it done without so many glaring plot holes and loose ends. And you've already seen it done without having to spend fifteen hours of your life over the course of three plus months just to eventually see the bad guy get what's coming to him. Thanks, Fox, but no thanks. The whole thing reeks way too much of been-there-done-that but if you want to waste fifteen hours of your life, hey, knock yourself out. I just wasted one hour watching the premiere. That was enough for me.",1358812800,17,817,4.641379310344828
5358277,4,B009OD8XQC,"Liam Neeson has finally given up on his daughter, handing over the reigns to Kevin Bacon.  But this time, the European actor trying to kill Maggie Grace is much more charming and methodical.  You might even say we were all a little ""Taken"" by James Purefoy.

OK, OK  enough with the jokes.  The Following premiered last night on the Fox Network and was pretty darn solid for a network pilot.  I'd also almost say it's surprising that the show gets away with the amount of gore and scares that it does, but then I remember the schlock out there like Law and Order: SVU and Criminal Minds that do this every week, bereft of compelling plots.  Kevin Bacon stars as Ryan Hardy, a semi-retired/on medical leave FBI agent brought back into the fold when the serial killer he put death row escapes weeks before his scheduled execution.

James Purefoy was the highlight of the premiere, taking some of the thunder away from Kevin Bacon.  I find that to be a positive in the show's favor because we're all meant to believe that Joe Carroll (a rather bland serial killer name) is an absolute charmer and charismatic cult (but don't call it that) leader.  Without that, there is no way to ground the show in some believable reality.

The Following drops us in just as the action begins with Carroll's escape from prison and it doesn't let up from there.  It's a bit reminiscent of a middle of the season episode of 24, where we'd have a convergence of events culminating in big shoot outs and brawls.  All of the action sacrifices some back story though, at least in the pilot.  We do get flash backs to brief moments in Hardy's investigation into Carroll but all we learn really is that Hardy gets lucky in breaking the case, although not so lucky with his health.
The one issue that I think I might have going forward is that the show has the potential to stay very dark, which could create an atmosphere absent of fun. That's not to say the show should be funny and optimistic, but the show can't focus only on murder and terror.  There needs to be some heroics as well. Again I will compare this to 24.  In nearly every season, 24 went to some very dark corners of humanity and that defined the show, for better or for worse.  But Jack Bauer would always come through and remind us of the hero he is (even at the cost of his own well being).  Our hope as an audience is that Ryan Hardy racks up some wins and makes you feel like he's making progress in taking down Carroll's followers.

Although I can't say I'll be in the mood for such a dark show week to week (thank goodness for DVR), I'll definitely follow The Following through to season's end and hopefully beyond.  I hope they can prolong the same fast pace through the remaining 14 episodes.

4.5 out of 5!  Just one warning: if you love dogs, be ready to fast forward about 20 minutes into the pilot.  There are some things you just don't want to see.",1358812800,37,2903,4.415413533834586

5358306,5,B009OD8XQC,"Season 1 of The Following premiered on January 21, 2013 on Fox. The pilot episode is by far the best... watch it and you'll be hooked! This psychological thriller centers on Ryan Hardy, a former FBI agent called out of retirement to help catch an escaped serial killer, Joe Carroll. Hardy helped put Carroll in prison years earlier in a case that nearly killed him. Their long standing history has not been forgotten and is ever present as this serial killer's case resurfaces. In fact, the mayhem that Joe Carroll goes on to orchestrate is intended specifically to torment Hardy. And this time, Carroll has a cult of followers that participate, making it practically impossible for Hardy to put an end to it.

""Maps"" by Maroon 5 would make a perfect theme song for this show:
""Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following...""

5358307,1,B009OD8XQC,I can only comment on the pilot since that is the only episode to which I subjected myself.  The visuals are very gruesome.  I love a good mystery and have watched many police shows.  The premise sounded interesting but the pictures of the  victims were disturbing.  I sometimes wonder if writers are running out of story lines so fill in with blood and gore.  It was shocking but not entertaining.,1474848000,,398,4.614285714285714

5358353,1,B009OD8XQC,This is a show that had me hooked on the first episode because even though the writing was decent the performance of Bacon and Purfoy was great for the pilot. But that was it the shows quality took a massive nose dive. If the FBI of this show existed in real life not only would I be horrified by there immense stupidity I think they would be disbanded. The season finale was far too predictable the only think that shocked me was that the audience that loved this garbage show were shocked by it and loved it. I'm sorry but I cannot recommend this show to anyone it was just a very poorly written show with very good actors in it. Even they deserve better than what they got when they were duped to doing the show.,1460592000,,715,4.226277372262774

Every time the FBI/ATF/Police try to trace a call they know is scrambled, encrypted or bounced around the world, drink. Any time one of the good guys enters a room alone, refill. Every time one of Joe Carroll's followers kill someone, sip. (Trust me.) Every time Joe Carroll mentions or pines for his wife, Claire, drink. Every time Claire does something stupid, sip.

5358376,4,B009OD8XQC,"The book follows Kevin Bacon's fallen FBI agent as he tries to deal with the machinations of a mass murderer.

The twist in this series is that mass murderer is in prison for most of the series.

Instead of committing crimes himself, the villain works through a mass following that is willing to go to any lengths to venerate their cult leader.

It is an interesting premise, and the stories are well written.

It is a little bloody, and the level of cult following seems a little ""over the top,"" but if you don't mind gore then this might be a good series for you.",1455580800,,565,4.352380952380952

5358521,3,B009OD8XQC,"If you want a summary of the premise for 'The Following', try this:

An FBI agent hunting a vicious serial killer seeks the aid of a brilliant university professor for his insight into the murderer's motivations. As it happens, the prof IS the serial killer. When the truth is revealed, a brutal life or death struggle ensues, except... neither man dies. The killer is fast, striking first and striking hard, but the agent hangs on to consciousness long enough to stop him from finishing the job. The psychopathic professor is badly wounded, but is patched up and sent to prison. The hero is more seriously injured, and bears emotional as well as physical scars. Years later, the now-retired agent is called upon to help with another series of killings that his maniacal nemesis is the key to stopping.

That's actually a summary of the premise for 'Red Dragon', but it also sums up the back-story for 'The Following' perfectly well, and comes pretty close to quite a few other serial killer movies and TV shows, of varying quality and limited originality, that have appeared since 'Silence of the Lambs'. The show's writer and creator, Kevin Williamson, knows all about clichs, making a name for himself with 'Scream'; it was a clever satire that played with the comically repetitive tropes of the horror genre, and a fairly suspenseful horror film in its own right. He also created 'Dawson's Creek', and some truly mediocre movies like 'I Know What You Did Last Summer'. There's no real excuse, then, for the criminally derivative aspects of 'The Following', especially coming from a writer as attuned to pop culture precedent as Williamson; actually, there's never any excuse for the recycled garbage that ends up as 'cop show 5267B', but...

'The Following' manages to rise above the mire from which it sprang, to some extent. The idea of a serial killer who becomes the leader of a cult devoted enough to carry out his nefarious, convoluted schemes, isn't THAT hard to accept, after the Manson family, and the Patty Hearst case, and Jonestown, etc. Memories of the Heaven's Gate cult, the corpses neatly arrayed in bunk-beds, with their identical track-suits and running shoes, provide a vivid example of the power a disturbed but magnetic guru can exert over followers; murder seems like it's just a couple stops past drinking the poisoned kool-aid on the weirdo-cult crazy train. The Manson family's brief rampage, however, has remained an isolated event in the annals of American crime. What's more, the power a cult leader exerts over his followers is based almost entirely on a freakishly powerful charisma, and once removed from that strange gravity, critical thought processes begin to function in whatever diminished capacity passes for normal amongst cult members, and loyalty wanes. Nevertheless, if the guru was charismatic enough, he might be able to pair his will with a pseudo-religion or philosophy compelling enough to start his own holy war.

The idea of using Edgar Allan Poe as a sacred text, however, is pretty uninspired. It's not as whacky as using the lyrics to a Beatles song as a divine manuscript, like Manson did, but 'truth is stranger than fiction', and fiction writers -- unfortunately -- have to try harder than Manson did for something believable; oftentimes motives are a mystery in the real world, but never in fiction. Williamson's use of Poe is pretty lazy. Once again, he stole the idea from 'Red Dragon', in which a serial killer has formulated his own hermetic philosophy based on the art and poetry of William Blake. Blake is a far more interesting inspiration than Poe, who is seemingly the writer of choice for every crappy horror movie and TV show. For all aspiring writers: you might think Poe, Dickens, and Twain are fascinating, and you might believe you have a profound connection to their literature, but dig a little deeper. Williamson, I think, just pulled the name closest to hand and easiest.

Everyone else involved tries harder than Williamson did, which isn't that unusual, in network television. James Purefoy is one of my favorite actors. I had a fairly well-defined image of Mark Antony in my mind before watching the HBO series 'Rome', but by the time the series was done, his performance as one of history's most fascinating characters had made Purefoy indistinguishable from the real figure. He was one of the many reasons that series stands out as one of the best ever made -- top 5, unquestionably. In fact, if you haven't seen it yet, forget 'The Following' for now, and watch both seasons of 'Rome'. The same goes for 'The Wire'. If you haven't seen 'The Wire', WTF are you doing here? If, however, you've already gone through the 'best of' list, and have now worked your way down to 'The Following' (waaay down), its got enough story and suspense to hold your interest, and the cast is excellent. The writers have their moments as well, suffering occasional fits of creativity that save the story from drowning in a swamp of deja view.

Compared to the inexcusable crap that passes for crime drama on network TV -- like CSI: Miami, Law & Order: SVU, NCIS and Criminal Minds (profilers are only marginally more useful than psychics to any serious investigation -- 'We need an APB on a middle-aged Caucasian male, who may or may not be a bed-wetter, and who probably molested woodchucks as a boy... judging by the pattern of the stab wounds and the butterfly-like shape of the blood-splatters, it is believed this unsub might be dangerous...'), 'The Following' represents a sharp improvement. Compared to the one series whose creators, producers and writers paid for the privilege of ransacking Dr. Lecter's storage locker, however, 'The Following' is far inferior. 'Hannibal' reinterprets the mythos created by author Thomas Harris in ways that are very clever and unexpected. Ironically, it's also the rare show about serial killers and FBI agents that actively avoids falling into the deep ruts previous incarnations of the Hannibal saga have cut into the trail. If it's a question of finding the best take on ingenious psychopathic killers, it's 'Hannibal'. If you can't get enough of this sort of thing, 'The Following' is a distant-but-decent second-place finisher (or third place, if you put 'Bates Motel' in the same category).

The inexplicable stupidity really does run rampant: Bacon's character is just a 'consulting agent' (Ugh. How many times...), but every episode finds him rushing to the scene ahead of everyone with just one agent for back-up. Every time this happens, instead of waiting for back-up, he decides to 'go in', but not before sending his partner off to 'cover' the back of the warehouse/farm house/crack house, and face off against multiple armed and dangerous suspects alone. No agent would allow another one to enter a situation like that alone -- and especially not when they're the ones giving the orders. Nevertheless, when the agent in charge of the case allows him to run into the abandoned factory without her in episode 08, she proves completely useless -- the three or four surviving 'followers' come rushing out the door she's been left to cover (they're all armed, but flee when Bacon surprises them and kills the extras without speaking parts, despite the fact that he's alone with a close-to-spent clip), pile into the vehicle she should have rendered inoperable by pulling a spark-plug, or cutting the tires, and escape before the backup that should of accompanied them from the start. Bacon gets held at gunpoint by Joe and his followers over and over again, at which point the gunman always looks smug, says he can't die yet, then makes vague, grandiose threats. He usually manages to get the upper hand before long, and chase his captors before they ultimately escape, capture one of them, or kill them. Hollywood gives the average FBI agent way too much credit for intelligence, imagination, and common sense, and 'The Following' is no different. But the stupidity they display in every crucial situation almost seems like Williamson's anti-authoritarian, passive-aggressive way of giving the feds a narrative b***h-slap.

So... the Feds in this series are brain-dead, and they're also way better at killing people than the actual serial killers, and... less bothered by it. The bad guys let them live, then get murdered by Kevin Bacon. Maybe the worst thing, however, the clich that has it's roots in Greek mythology and drama, is the nemesis. The killer is always the dark reflection of the hero cop. In 'Hannibal', they get back to the myth, in which your nemesis is a doppelganger wearing the antlers of a stag. Will Graham is haunted by stag imagery throughout the series, often in surprising and creepy ways, symbolic of his powerful connection to Hannibal Lecter. So far, Hannibal has avoided uttering some pathetic variation of the line that makes me ill - 'We're not so different, you and I'. It has popped up in hundreds, and possibly thousands, of films and TV episodes since Belloche popularized it in 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', freeing it from its pulp fiction and comic-book origins. Purefoy is a great Nemesis, but the idea is just exhausted. Played out. Done. End it.",1426464000,7,9202,4.951456310679611

I can understand why there are a lot of 1-star reviews because, I was leaning that way too. The 3 main protagonists seem always lacking manpower and often ambushed by the more organized cult/criminals and it does seem implausible. Perhaps in season 2 they can correct a lack of manpower and the lack of tactical competence shown by the SWAT members, as they too are often ambushed and quickly executed.

I think this Hannibal-&- Edgar Allan Poe like criminal as more realistic, since Joe Carroll shows a lot of monomaniacal impulses and weaknesses of  a typical sociopath. He is not perfect like Hannibal Lecter nor as brilliant, but he is often several steps ahead of the FBI...I thought it might have had potential but it doesn't...Season 2 was a failure.

The series can be maddeningly predictable with bad guys outwitting good guys 9 times out of 10.  This makes for a frustrating watch and evidences a certain lack of originality in screenwriting, as Bacon and cohorts lag behind Joe Carroll's flock at almost every turn.  However, there are enough twists and turns and sufficient grisly violence to satisfy the strong stomachs amongst us.  Strangely enough, The Following succeeds most when they take the time to develop the psychological motivations behind both Bacon's and Purefoy's followers.

5358561,3,B009OD8XQC,"Given the Americans almost reverential obsession with their serial killers, it was only a matter of time before the standard cat-and-mouse tussle between the killer and the FBI became the basis for a TV series.

James Purefoy plays Joe Carroll the urbane, intelligent, Hannibal Lecterish professor of English serial killer while Kevin Bacon is the somewhat dishevelled ex-FBI agent Ryan Hardy called back as a consultant following Carrolls escape from prison. It all looks to conform to the standard formula but the presence of Carrolls eponymous cult following  is a unique twist. Although the main plot thread is the hunt for Carroll, the gradual revealing of cultists drives the narrative while the relationship between Carroll, his ex-wife, son and Hardy adds a human dimension and allows some character development.

It is a well put together, violent, sometimes creepy & disturbing TV series which bowls along at a cracking pace but there are, unfortunately, some incredibly contrived plot devices which stretch the necessary suspension of disbelief more than a little. By the season finale it all seemed a bit improbable and silly but remained entertaining throughout.

When he's given crummy material--and he often is--he soldiers through, at worst, and at best his performance will hypnotize you into thinking the material isn't stupid. There's a reason Kevin Bacon has had so much work for so many years. In spite of his success, he's underrated as an actor. And, there are a number of other excellent actors working in this series, notably Shawn Ashmore, who could have been Kevin's 2nd fiddle, but brings a lot more to the show. Also, on the good side of things, there are a lot of really scary moments in this series, and I say that as someone who rarely finds TV shows & movies scary. (I find LIFE scary, but that's another story.) There are some really interesting twists and turns along the way, buried in among a bunch of implausible and fully telegraphed ""surprises."" The premise of the show is super-creepy, but just implausible in its execution. The main villain, Joe Carroll starts off as a Hannibal Lector knock-off, then later the character just becomes a kind of confused mess, then back around to pure wickedness again. So many of these monstrous villains, particular the ones who are pretending to have normal lives while secretly are prepared to slaughter strangers for Big Joe, just don't work. And the cops on this show...including Bacon's character, are so often so monumentally dumb that you'll find yourself screaming  at the TV: ""Look behind you, idiot!"" ""No, no, DO NOT PUT YOUR GUN DOWN,"" and so on.  With all that said, I'll sum up by saying show works, overall, in the same way that will cause a smart person to get hooked on a soap opera.

5358630,4,B009OD8XQC,"James Purefoy stars as Joe Carol, a serial killer and Kevin Bacon is Ryan Hardy, a burned out retired, alcoholic detective trying to catch him. I know that seems like a pretty simple plot idea, but this show takes some twists and turns and is actually just really twisted. Some of the scenes even disturbed me and thats saying a lot. I don't get disturbed to easily. At the beginning of the show Joe is incarcerated, but by the end of the season he is on the run and on a rampage. What makes him different from other serial killers is that e has a following, hence the title. These people will do anything for him, kill other people, kill themselves and just do some crazy things. I know it sounds crazy, but you actually kind of start to like him or at least root for him because other people he encounters end up being even worse than him, believe it or not. He meets up with a crazy chick that wants to be his serial killer bride in the second season and even gets involved in a cult lead by a bigger kook than him. Im not sure if the show has sustaining power though. The writers are going to have to work overtime to keep it interesting because I think it would be difficult to build a whole show on just Ryan chasing Joe everywhere. I think, unless the writers can pull out some cool stuff, this concept may get old.",1410134400,,1322,4.229249011857707

5358633,4,B009OD8XQC,"This is a very funny though quite gory series. A serial killer has built behind him a whole underground social network which works like a cult: it recruits people who have problems with life, who have already killed one or more people, who have had the intention of doing so or who are just asocial, sociopaths or psychopaths who consider the world has to be destroyed, the human beings in it have to be killed and who are ready to die if their death can achieve that aim. In other words they work like a terrorist cult.

The first objective is to get the serial killer, Joe Carroll, out of death row to take the lead of the crusade, vendetta, purification of whatever he has in mind. He sees his adventure as a novel that follows the stories by Edgar Allan Poe. I must say that literary reference as the basis of a criminal adventure has already been used and Poe is maybe not the best since he contains no religious or mystical or even mythical references like Dante or other esoteric or apocryphal Christian texts. Whats more such a reference in a series is not easy to follow from one week to the next. But that must be the fun of the audience memorizing the various and successive references, or just taking them blindly.

On the other side the FBI and all other agencies and a conflict between an ex-agent who has already arrested that killer some years before and the standard bureaucrats of these agencies who cannot accept a non-agent having any leading position, especially since this non-agent is not limited really by any ethics he has not sworn to respect, though he was deputized once in this season for a short while.

The first season is extremely dense in action, violence and emotional situation, with a small six year old boy in the midst of the action of his own father against society and against his own mother and fathers ex-wife. There are some sloppy moments when they let anyone in a crisis situation penetrate in some kind of safe area without checking her or him or them out properly. They also forget that cars have GPSs, though they think of it from time to time.

The series is cruel and the end of the first season gives us only waste lands for the next season. How are they going to grow any kind of a story in the devastated landscape they abandon behind them, on both sides, the serial killers and the FBIs?

And I'll say it's one of the best series ever done on television, period. It is incredibly dark, following the attempts of former FBI agent Ryan Hardy (Kevin Bacon) to capture a serial killer/writer, Joe Carroll (James Purefoy), who now leads a cult, which seems to be ever-growing, that loves, loves, loves that serial killing stuff. Every episode is suspenseful, and full of I-can't-believe-this-but-it's-awesomely-evil moments. I binge-watched to prepare myself for Season 2, which was also excellent.

At some points in the show your probably going to be wondering ""Is the FBI really this stupid?""

5358697,3,B009OD8XQC,"I really try not to write a critique because I always feel they are subjective to mood, experience, and education.  I must admit I am not in anyway a professional critic.  However....
I am also not a stupid viewer.
Seems almost tragic for the two leading stars to be dunked in Ken and Barbie tryouts.  This series has such an excellent story, plot and situation that it would be impossible for it not to fulfill a viewer's need for suspense.  Yet, there are too many incidents that just are not plausible. Firstly, why anyone would follow Joe, the professor of literature---with an obsession on Poe---is beyond comprehension; especially women, since Joe is a serial killer of women.  I could not find depth enough to satisfy my question of why these Barbie and Ken people would be so malleable that they turned Joe into a god.  But that is not the largest concern, for there are far too many occurrences that make no sense whatsoever to me, as a viewer.  One of them is the follower swallowing gauze and committing suicide on his hospitable wraps. The man was tied to a bed and monitored. Am I to believe in the surreal incident that no hospital staff would be unaware of what he was doing?  And in such a short time frame could it be done?  Through the episodes there were too many ""darling"" scenes that made no sense. How charismatic Joe could be such a manipulator just by showing us a few back flashes, didn't make sense. Most glaring was when he kidnapped the warden's daughter, Dana, and forced the warden's hands to be complicit in his escape. There wasn't one mention of Joe the Poe having to remain in the state he was incarcerated in to face charges for killing not only 5 guards, but another woman.  This was ignored.  As a viewer I was outraged the writers should think I would gloss over that along with them. When Joe escaped in a helicopter in a city, off a rooftop and vanished, I was equally repulsed.  There are a lot of scenes that snap suddenly with irony, but most don't make sense at all.  Why would a chief of police allow an unbalanced man and one agent go to investigate three criminals who were obviously quite dangerous and clever?  A lot of the writing and directing moved quickly but was quite aloof in maintaining detail vital to the credibility of this great story and plot.  I honestly felt placated, pacified and treated as if I should just be as much of a loon as Joe the Poe's followers.  But what really gets to me is why these people would follow Joe the Poe.  I would think money would be a major influence----and by the way whose purchasing those large mansions and estates? Joe, whose book was a flop?  The followers all had this pod people look about them, which might be characteristic of some cults, but the man was behind bars for 9 years. And the idea that this group gathered from over the Internet just didn't wash with me.  Still, due to the two lead characters and the snapping of irony I continue to watch Season One, but I don't feel the writers and director have gained my respect because no respect is given to my intelligence.  Most happenings just doesn't make any kind of sense whatsoever.  When Pixie girl, Emma, is treacherous and manipulative, she then turns into mush.  Many of those Ken and Barbie characters---none of the characters echo real people to me at all---just suit themselves in a role to file round the two main actors, who must carry the show.  I was more sorry for me in my disappointment then sorry for the series.  When I wish to see more I will have to sit on kindergarten chairs with a blank pod people look on my face so that I don't question the scenes as they unfold before me.  Honesty, Joe the Poe is not that charismatic to cause so much havoc in the world. But the acting is great!",1402358400,,3767,4.464233576642336

I mean, c'mon, the plot line borders on ridiculous -- a cult led by a professor who uses his interpretation of Edgar Allen Poe to glorify serial killing and gains legions of adoring, brainwashed, vapid followers who continuously outsmart the FBI? ...and an FBI that can't figure out even the most obvious of the cult's schemes? WTH? I kept  watching hoping it would get less stupid. I even tried to watch the first two episodes of Season 2 but the plot just continues to be more and more ridiculous. I honestly don't understand why this show remains so popular.

5358722,2,B009OD8XQC,"My coworkers were raving about this show and I like Kevin Bacon, so I borrowed it from the county library and tried watching it before buying. Man am I ever glad that I did. The show is so incredibly silly with a huge number of FBI and police mistakes that I could not even finish the second desk. I am not blind to the fact that our police and FBI can make many blunders but this show goes way to far. One thing that we can never accuse the police or FBI of is being under zealous when it comes to pulling that gun and going into action. In one show they surround a home a child is being held captive in and they stand around and stand around and around, discussing and discussing and discussing. I was yelling, get in that house and save that child for gosh sake. The straw that broke the camels back for me was when Kevin Bacon sneaks into a home that same child is being held up in and downstairs he discovers a woman tied up alive with a stab wound. He says to her that he is going to save her, he then puts the duct tape back over her mouth and leaves her alone all tied up in that chair. What the hay? Yes she did get out but she should have gone over to Bacon and slapped him squire in the face for leaving her there and then sued the FBI.

This is just a small amount of the insane bad writing in this show. There is that poor lawyer at the mersey of the bad guy because he has one of his cult members cut off two her left fingers and this never gets reported to the police? Then there are the stupid female followers who are not bothered by the fact that all fifteen of the bad guys victims where woman. All the killing that goes on in the show that should get someone caught but the followers most of the time get away. I can go on and on but I am sure by now you get my point. Buy the way, I do not care if I remember the bad guys name.

What I do not understand is how are people entertained and give four and five stars to a show with all this blatant stupidly? How can one follow a show where the authorities are so mindless, stupid and making choices anyone in these positions would never do? How can someone watch these followers always meet their goals when the police are standing by giving these followers the directions?

Sure you do have to suspend some reality regarding some of the police/FBI actions, some of the character's actions, and actually some of the characters.  You just need to remind yourself that this isn't a documentary and if everyone was totally believable this TV show would wrap itself up in about 3 episodes.  So just let it go and you will enjoy the ride.  We were yelling at the TV saying things like, ""Look behind you!"" and ""Run you idiot, RUN!!!!""  That was a big part of the fun.

5358726,2,B009OD8XQC,"Watched it for FREE on Netflix. I usually look for a show there before I buy on Amazon. Netflix NEVER has all seasons of ANY show & never current episodes. Amazon does, however, have ALL episodes of every series they sell the day after they air  on TV. Well anyway.... I watched season 1 there,if it were any good I would have bought season 2 on Amazon but this show was NOT good. I gave it 2-Stars because it DID keep me from being bored to death while I was working. So 2-Satrs is me being ""nice"".

Too much in this series annoyed me. Like how useless law enforcement was. So many idiotic mistakes & unrealistic behavior. Several FBI agents were kidnapped. How does this happen? One of them KNEW something was up (right before they snatched him up) and didn't respond the way someone with FBI TRAINING should have. He just scurried on up to his hotel room like a scared civilian frantically trying to open his hotel room door. I said ""They're gonna be in his room. Watch!"", then *BAM* soon as he walks in the cult members are in his room waiting. Too predictable. The ""bad guys"" kept getting away! Even in situations where there's no way in hell they should have. In a hostage situation, since WHEN does FBI, SWAT, Local law enforcement leave (or pretend to leave) when the bad guys demand them to do so? How do 3 guys take out 3 dozen FBI agents with ease? Why do the ""bad guys"" ALWAYS get away by sneaking out the back door when the house/building is supposedly surrounded by cops? Even with a police officer RIGHT THERE in the hallway outside of Clair's bedroom (while her door was open) a FAT cult member slowly drops out of the ceiling (like Spider Man) kills the cop with out making a peep then takes her hostage..... Really!?

Joe Carrol & Clair's son, was a smart-DUMB kid. One minute the kids does something extremely clever, the next minute he does something extremely dumb (even for a kid).

The main thing that irked me is..... No one behaved as if an infinite number of anonymous serial-killer-cult-members were running around killing random innocent people,blowing up stuff, kidnapping kids/women, and kidnapping & torturing FBI. No one was taking this seriously enough for me. Like when Ryan & Claire were held up at his FBI friend's cabin. Soon as they found that a GPS tracking device was planted on Claire (by a cult member) they should have LEFT IMMEDIATELY. Instead they stay and plan on leaving in the next day (WTF!?) in the meantime Ryan's friend finds ONE shot gun and a half-empty box of shells. Mind you, they know that they're being hunted by select cult members with extreme military/C.I.A training (and military grade fire power) that just murdered 3 dozen FBI agents an hour ago. Of course, soon as night falls here comes the bad guys AGAIN.

The one victim that survived being attacked by Joe Carrol (forgot her name) didn't act like someone who just found out the serial killer that almost stabbed her to death just broke out of prison. This girl (and her friends) acted like she just lost her cat/dog and was a little bummed out over it. If that were me...After the attack, I would've already had an arsenal in my home. After being notified Joe Carrol escaped, I wouldn't take a piss without a 9mm (loaded with hollow-points) sitting on the vanity. I would've purchased two highly trained German Shepard dogs, that would've slept in bedroom every night. I also would've spent the last 7 yrs doing some type of NavySeals/C.I.A/JasonBorne combat training, and at the riffle range 5 days a week. This is the type of behavior you'd expect from someone that had gone through such a tragic ordeal.

Police protection or ""Protective Custody"" is a JOKE in every low budget movie/series. Am I supposed to be surprised that the 50 cops outside & inside of the victim's home wasn't going to stop the ""bad guys"" from getting to them? Hasn't this scenario been done to death in movies?

F_ _ _ YOU in advance to anyone that feels the need to criticize my review, as well other peoples review.

The charters are very realistic; Ryan, the good cop, has his demons to deal with and he isn't completely good. He struggles with moral issues when it comes to pursuing the bad guys. Joe Carrol, the murderous cult leader, is not completely unlikable or a sympathetic character. He manages to show traces of humanity and weakness.

The whole premise is a bit ludicrous from professor joe carroll to his legion of yuppie looking edgar allan poe quoting followers. most of them look like they never had a fight but they go around killing for joe. ryan hardy played by kevin bacon must have used david caruso from csi as a role model as he intensely plays the lead investigator.as for claire, joes wife and ryans love interest, the moment i met you i swear.

5358813,5,B009OD8XQC,Very good television for mature audiences. Gripping story line. Kevin Bacon is excellent as is the supporting cast. I purchased it to view prior to the second season airing on TV.  It was well worth the second viewing (having watched it when it originally aired). I highly recommend this DVD.,1398038400,2,292,4.84
5358814,5,B009OD8XQC,"This is one of those series that I was hesitant to buy at first, based largely on some of the reviews here on Amazon.  But it's that time of year when DVD pickins are slim - not enough new stuff coming out - so I picked it up at the local Walmart and gave it a go.  And... wow!  This is an impressive series with so many twists and turns that it's hard to keep track of the players without a scorecard - and that's what I LOVED about it!  So many tv shows are so predictable as to be mind-numbing, but this one had me guessing from the first episode to the last.

The performances by Kevin Bacon and James Purefoy are exemplary.  I first learned to love Purefoy when I saw A KNIGHT'S TALE several years ago, and I've never seen him do anything that wasn't perfection.  Maybe it's partially that lovely British accent, but he was perfect in this role, and ultimately more menacing as a serial killer than even the renowned Hannibal Lecter.  His on screen charisma is such that I had no trouble believing he could gather such a ""following"" - though I was very glad the writers alluded to a website set up by some of the followers to attract even more followers.  It seemed so very real in that creepy manner which flourishes in certain grim corners of the internet - those sites where darkness breeds and psychological perversion is nourished by that dangerous gram of madness which lurks in far too many unstable people who are ultimately LOOKING for a charismatic leader to guide them to their bleak destiny.

As the series progresses, we see the instability of some of those characters as they begin to turn on one another, as they compete for the attentions and affections of Joe Carroll (Purefoy).

(Spoiler alert)  I was sorry to see the female FBI agent killed.  I often have a hard time with strong female characters - not in general, but because of how they are often written.  The character of Debra Parker was a great exception - written realistically and sympathetically, and with a strength that was admirable and genuine.  Just seemed unnecessary to kill off that character - except as a further impetus to Ryan Hardy to go after Carroll.

(End spoiler alert)

Overall, this series is top-notch - largely because the actors have the ability to pull it off.  I honestly think that the same scripts in the hands of less competent cast members could have resulted in an unbelievable drama, but as it stands the actors brought these characters to life in a way that is usually reserved for motion pictures as opposed to television.

Sure, there were some flaws - such as bad decisions on the parts of the characters that often resulted in their demise - but sometimes the only way to advance the plot is to have characters behave exactly as they would in ""the real world"".  In other words... people make bad decisions all the time, so I didn't have too much of a problem with those little foibles in some of the scripts.  Of course, the words, ""Let's split up so we can cover more ground,"" always end up being lethal to one or more of the characters, so maybe those words should never appear in ANY script... just a thought.

Overall, THE FOLLOWING was an amazing look at cults and killers and those who are compelled to bring them to justice.  I'm looking forward to season two when it comes out on DVD in the fall.",1397952000,2,3324,4.485049833887043

5358819,3,B009OD8XQC,"Hoping SO much that I would like this show, I was completely blown away by the first episode. It was amazing! The suspense was outrageous. The second episode had good points but each succeding episode seemed to get worse until the final episode Hardy and Carroll argue about the ""predictable"" ending the chapter was going to have...and ironically,  the season ended quite predictably. I got so tired of the ""I need to do this alone"" theme with no back-up,  no coverage, and very often no gun. It just seemed to lack realism by the end which was not so with the first episode. I get bored when shows portray FBI as being always dropping the ball, always ten seconds late, and never seeming to make any headway. Kevin Bacon is an awesome actor, as is James Purefoy, but the later episodes did not do justice to the battling intellects apparent at the beginning of the show. I am glad I finished the season and will probably watch the first episode again, but that is all.",1397520000,,969,4.531428571428571

5358839,4,B009OD8XQC,"The Following is a suspenseful and complex thriller. The television series, which airs on Fox, is about FBI agent Hardy (Kevin Bacon) and a cult born from a notorious serial killer.

Joe Carroll was arrested, and convicted, of several murders. Brought to justice by one Agent Hardy. Joe loved Edgar Allen Poe and thought of death as an art. After a smart prison break, he sets out to finish off his work and utilizes the help of his ever-growing psycho fan base. Hardy and other law enforcement are hit from all sides.

New victims are popping up. One even turns out to be a crazed self-inflicting groupie! Some folks of the Carroll family come up missing. With so many potential targets and more players it is hard for officials to stay ahead.

I love Kevin Bacon in this show. He plays a great agent. All of the actors really portray their roles well. The shows flashes back and forth so you can see the present and the past. I like seeing the history explain the present. The Following just didn't grab me though so I gave it 4 stars.",1396828800,,1037,4.476190476190476

5358860,1,B009OD8XQC,"Truly shocking.

The attempts to produce suspense derive from a lack of any meaningful plot development and as a result are gimmicky, puerile and insulting. The creators of this show must lack any critical faculty. Either that or they have simply closed their eyes to its awfulness and are just counting the money. Well, good luck to them, but if you enjoy being challenged and love identifying the subtler aspects to be found in shows like Boardwalk and Breaking Bad, then I believe you will want to keep this at arm's length. Toxic stuff.

It is the kind of TV show that makes you want to read a book.",1396224000,2,603,4.522935779816514

It's like Kevin Bacon and his buddy are out there alone and unafraid,,,,no communications to speak of, no technology,,,I mean if the NSA can do what we are led to believe they can do, this story is blown...anyway, I can't wait to watch Season 2, maybe Kevin can catch up with the bad guy and rip off Poe pages and shove them ....well, wherever.....",1396137600,,884,4.6050955414012735

5358873,3,B009OD8XQC,"If the real life FBI were this inept, we would all be in big trouble. Somehow the villains manage to have moles everywhere but the FBI has never infiltrated anything.

I really wanted to like this show, but it's more like junk food for the brain. It's one of those serials where you get 45 minutes of bumbling cops and lascivious killers and then a cliff hanger that brings you back to the trough yet again.

The investigative work is formulaic, somehow Kevin Bacon always figures it out 2 steps ahead and so he has to race to save someone with only 1 or 2 other agents for backup so OF COURSE they are outnumbered, a good guy gets it and the bad guys get away. I think this is one of those shows that gets dressed up with high school literary material (EA Poe) to give it a veneer of intellectualism, gets way better acting than it deserves (Bacon and James Purefoy), and tries to push the limit on how much gore and violence can be shown on network TV.

End of the day I keep watching it, but I also keep eating cheetos and I don't think either one is very good for me.",1395705600,,1071,4.189320388349515

NEVER...THE..LESS...

The actors are good, the two leading men. There is something about that Kevin Bacon. I don't know what the hell it is... seriously!... but he's got IT.

This show is CRAZY. Basically, it's just killers... cold bloodied killers, psychos. And their leader is... wow!... what a character and James Purefoy, what an engaging actor. He pulls me into this freaking show. And on the flip side... that damn Kevin Bacon.

There are many episodes... if not all of them... where I'm like... WTF!
I laugh out loud cause I cannot believe what they're doing. And season 2... OMG! I thought... ""what could they possibly do in season 2""... well... just make crazy crazier... it's crazy.

I'm going to watch season 1 again. I need to start it over cause... I don't know why I like this show...

Perhaps, the writing makes the story good? Can you have a not-so-good story but writers who can make it happen? ... and that damn Kevin Bacon! I am NOT Kevin Bacon fan... am I????!!!!

I hung in there the entire time and saw the whole first season, but once concluded, I deleted the DVR series recording and didn't look back. Season 2 is now airing, and I am content to not be watching it.

My main criticism for the series is summed up in my title. Without spoiling anything, the bad guys are really, really lucky. They are too lucky. The series tries to pass it off that they are just super smart with a great plan addressing every contingency. I call B.S. They are thrown for loops every now and then, obviously NOT according to their plan, but somehow land on their feet. It's so ridiculous, that a shift in tone would easily make this material a farcical comedy with minimal effort.

This happens so often, the series devolves into a question of, ""How do the bad guys escape this time?"" Don't get me wrong. Occasionally, a bad guy does get busted or killed, but the bad guys' agenda continues without a hitch. Even the way the season concludes, you can say to yourself, ""Well, that's done.""

5358936,5,B009OD8XQC,"A word of caution up front, this will contain some spolierish material from season one, although nothing major will be given away.

The Following is a show about a serial killer that focuses not only on the killer himself (played wonderfully by James Purefoy), but the cult of followers that assist him. He kills based on literary references, and has set up a religious cult based on the works of Edgar Allen Poe. The show starts with him breaking out of prison and sets in motion a plan to kill the agent that arrested him (played by Kevin Bacon), and be reunited with his ex wife (Natalie Zea) and young son.

The first half of the season consisted of many twists and turns mainly focused around who was a cult member and who was not. Some of that got kind of ridiculous because there were cult members insulated almost everywhere. The cult ended up being very large, although the story tended to focus mainly on just a few of the ""main"" members. Like any dramatized cop show they had the agents making very stupid decisions in order to put them in more danger when trying to catch the cult members. Some of those things did die down by the end of the season however.

The story is told both in present day and in a series of flashbacks to tell the back stories of the characters and reveal how Joe was originally caught. The show is very violent but not ultra gory. Yes there is blood, killing and some gory moments, but if you compare the level of gore to a show like Hannibal it is very tame. What I think the show does best is make all the characters flawed in some way. The good guys are not always good, and the bad guys are written in a way that they are not always just pure evil so you can find some compassion for some of them. It is also a show where no character is safe. All of the main characters are point in death defying situations, and not all make it alive.

If you get the blu rays, the season will come not only on blu ray, but for some reason on DVD. It does give you more options for when and where you can watch the show, but I would rather just have the blu rays and keep the set a little less expensive. Like is the case with most new shows, it looks and sounds great on blu ray. And given some of the wonderful visuals that the show gives on location shots you can really enjoy the picture quality. Like many of the dramas are doing the season was shorter, 16 episodes in all covering 4 discs.

As far as the bonus material goes, there are commentary and deleted scenes on selected episodes. There are also ""in movie"" experience mode on some where you get video pop ups where something about a scene will be explained. Along with that there is just over an hour of behind the scenes and making of features included. So if you are one who likes to go through that material it will be enough to make you happy. The only real drawback to the blu rays is that there is no true season play mode. The episodes will play back-to-back, however if you stop in the middle of an episode it will not start playing from where you left off when you turn the player back on. It reloads to the main menu (which thankfully is pretty quick if you have a newer player and have updated your firmware) but you have to go back to the episode you were on and either do chapter selections or forward through it to get back to where you left off.

Overall it is a well written (for the most part) well acted drama. As I said above some of the twists early in the season are a bit silly, but once those let up, and it becomes more of a chase/manhunt thriller it works well. If you generally like those kinds of shows and movies then this one is worth checking out.",1393718400,,3667,4.216524216524217

Bacon, Purefoy and ensemble do a great job acting. They do their parts well.

The reason for deducting two stars is the story line. The writers have gone way overboard. The plot is so far fetched it really detracts from the show. Most shows dare to be brave but ""The Following"" takes it to the extreme. Added to the extremism are these flashes of alternate reality that don't quite make sense. This makes becoming totally engrossed in the show almost impossible. As a viewer, these frequent, and I do mean frequent, interruptions of implausibility and confusion are bitters among the sweet.

5358982,5,B009OD8XQC,"'The Following' is one of the most brilliantly produced TV shows ever
made for primetime television. I was surprised to read the negative
reviews, and if anything, they prove a point--this show hits a nerve.

Which is *exactly* why I like ""The Following"" so much--unlike your
typical cut 'em up slasher TV show, this show actually pulls us back,
and makes us think--why do we watch these shows? What is it that
compels us to study violence--is it healthy or harmful to society? (Can
it be both?)

'The Following' raises these questions while it entertains us at the
same time--the best kind of medicine.

People who slam this show for being 'absurd' are missing the point
(isn't most 'entertainment' absurd by its very nature? Do you really
think that Mary Poppins can fly with her umbrella?)

If you're looking for a TV show of mindless entertainment, look
elsewhere. If you're looking for a TV show that is brilliantly acted,
directly, edited, lit (the cinematography alone is a reason to tune
in), with multiple layers of meaning, then watch ""The Following"".

It is a masterpiece of television.",1392076800,,1097,4.876344086021505

Instead of serious and threatening, it comes across as repetitive and annoying after awhile.
What is ""off"" with the show ?

We think we have identified what keeps us from liking it more .......... it seems the show just ""churns"" without going anywhere.
By that I mean every episode is basically the same .

1) Crazed Killers commit a crime then taunt Kevin Bacon's character
2) Kevin Bacon avoids back up and goes alone to investigate
3) The bad guys get the upper hand on Bacon, but don't kill him just to prove they are superior.
4) Police show up and threaten to kick Bacon off case for being a lone wolf.
5) Jim Carroll (main bad guy) pops up again (his superhuman invincibility makes for an annoying and borderline over the top unbelievable bad guy in this series)
6) Episode ends with Bacon unable to give successful pursuit.

Next episode  = go to step 1 above and repeat pattern
Next episode = go to step 1 and repeat pattern again
etc...
etc...
etc....

When you stop and think about the whole series, you realize the whole show was simply an endless repetitive loop of ...

Good guy chases bad guy ------- Good guy corners bad guy ---- Bad Guy Escapes -------Good guy chases bad guy ------- Good guy corners bad guy ---- Bad Guy Escapes-----Good guy chases bad guy ------- Good guy corners bad guy ---- Bad Guy Escapes-----Good guy chases bad guy ------- Good guy corners bad guy ---- Bad Guy Escapes --- etc ....

5359061,1,B009OD8XQC,"""The Following"" marks an appalling new low for television, even for Fox TV.  Kevin Bacon is an FBI agent tracking Joe Carroll, a cult leader, who encourages depraved murder, stabbing, torture of the most grisly ilk among his followers, and who has based his cult on -- God forgive me -- the writings of Edgar Allan Poe.  But Edgar Allan Poe actually had talent, unlike Kevin Williamson and the other writers of this show -- and use of his name is simply a pretext to showcase an unrelenting stream of sadistic torture and murder.  Indeed, after the first few episodes, they drop any mention of Poe and just proceed with an endless string of gory stabbings, kidnappings, torture, and murder.  It is sick, depraved, revolting, and monstrously sadistic.  It seems to delight in torture and cruelty.  It is extremely gory, with people being stabbed to death repeatedly episode after bloody episode.  In a word, it is profoundly SICK.  How any network could air such a show is beyond human comprehension, especially given the fact that it will undoubtedly foster more of the horrific serial murders we are witness to on the nightly news.  If Rupert Murdoch had an ounce of morality, he would yank this trash from the airways.  And Kevin Bacon must have reached complete desperation to have attached himself to something like this.  Does he have family? children?  What does he tell them?  Indeed, he compared the violence of ""The Following"" with Shakespeare on Tavis Smiley.  Shakespeare!",1390780800,7,1483,4.903614457831325

5359073,1,B009OD8XQC,"I want to thank all my confreres who share the one-star rating for one of the most poorly written and amateurly plotted series to ever get a green light for another season.

First, the plot lines.  No, make it the inane writing that permits stone cold killers to live, not being shot dead on sight but instead given opportunities to kill again, multiple times, by apparently incorrigible liberals who do not see the danger to society of allowing those killers to live. Or who may see it, but just don't give a damn about the living.  This show should have been a one off movie with the killer in prison severely put down, with extreme prejudice. Ironically, I have never seen a series that has confirmed for me the wisdom of making the Death Penalty mandatory in all 51 states.  One of them, Israel, as least knows justice when it sees it.

The first premise upon which this series is built:  Allowing a monstrous serial killer to have any contact outside the confines of solitary.

The only way the ""followers"" could do anything to ingratiate themselves with their beloved, convicted serial killer, to try and impress him, is to kill who he tells them to.

In a rational world, a serial killer or any killer of another human bean, just for the sake of the thrill of it, for kicks, that killer would be put down by someone in the law enforcement system who could get to him to prevent further communication, and therefore more killings after the first one, let alone dozens more.

The number of times in the first 6 episodes that I had to shake my head in disgust at the writers and producers has given me a permanent crick in the neck, which I now treat with damp heating pads.

I am going to wrap up the first season tonight, the last 2 episodes, to conclude the wasting of any more of my time on 5th rate thrillers, that do not deserve to ever have seen the light of day.

When this series first aired, I watched the first episode half way thru last year. And simply deleted it from my TIVO series manager.

It was only after hearing from some others that the season was a good one that I took another chance and to my regret.

Please, you who give this a 2-3-4-5 star rating, get some perspective, think about what these producers are foisting upon you, otherwise the continual dumbing down of these of genre will only get worse.",1390608000,5,2333,4.448356807511737

5359100,4,B009OD8XQC,"okay..so we've all obviously seen a member of law enforcement hunt a really bad guy before right?
can you get past that> great!

the show is a wonderful journey of macabre,with moments of brilliance and yet also has moments of people needing to do the dumb thing-so the plot can move conventionally. it happens..but when it happens around a strong cast and captivating story-it can be forgiven

the acting-nobody hams it up or phones it in. there are no cracks in the performances that say ""we know its just a tv show,what ghoulish glee were having,whoo hoo:."" its played straight,at times with romance and also with a devilish twinkle in the mad mens eyes.

the story-again,weve seen the good guy chase the bad guy before. what makes this show exciting is having two likeable leads and a plotline that offers some twists

the 'ghoulish glee'- if your a fan of Silence Of The Lambs,or Saw,this might be a nice light fare for you. It certainly doesnt have the excess gore of the latter series,but doesnt skimp on a chance to make with the bloodletting either.there may not be too many moments youll have to look away in disgust,but you might cringe with a slight smile-revering the dark fun of it all.

Many reviewers have blasted the show for being weak or predictable,and ill admit after a strong debut and 2nd show,there was a slow week or 2. After that,every episode drew you in,and left you cakcling as you rub your feet together in anticipation of whatever gruesome moment or surprise turn comes next.

The rest are clueless and are too ridiculous to be believed.... i can see how some pple might go 3 stars or even 4, but this is not a 5 star show- thats truly comical.

5359135,4,B009OD8XQC,"The Following is the Spring sensation that took Fox viewers by storm and led to some of the highest ratings for a mid-season debut in network history. After watching one episode, I could see why this show was so popular, it really is right up my ally, and is easily one of the best written shows on network television.

10 years ago, College professor, Joe Carroll (James Purefoy), was convicted of the murders of 14 young women. He sits on death row, waiting to be executed, when he launches a daring escape. Completely stunned, the F.B.I. brings in the now retired agent who originally caught him to track him down. Ryan Hardy (Kevin Bacon) is a troubled, lonely man, who just wants to move on with his life and leave all the horrors he's known behind him. Reluctantly, he agrees to find Carroll and to everyone's surprise, does it with ease. As it turns out, getting caught again was all part of Carroll's plan. While in prison, Carroll had spoken with and gotten to know many different people who admire what he did. The charismatic killer has tricked these people into believing that they need to give their lives meaning by being a part of something special, his resurrection. Carroll's getting easily captured by the F.B.I. was nothing more than a signal to his many followers to begin reeking havoc all over the eastern seaboard. The targets are seemingly anyone Carroll ever interacted with and the acts all meant to torment the man who caught him, Ryan Hardy. With no other choice, Hardy agrees to stay on and try to stop whatever was set in motion, before Carroll's plan can come to fruition.

I know what you're thinking, because I was thinking the same thing. It's a great story for one season, but how in the world can they continue this show after that, without it becoming old and repetitive. It was something I thought a lot about while watching this show, however my doubts may have been premature. The more this show continued, the better the writing got, and if anyone can keep this show interesting and fresh it's this talented cast and crew.

Kevin Bacon has always been a tremendously underrated actor, because for 30 years, he's simply been known as that guy from Footloose. I've seen many of his films and now his new TV show, and I have to tell you this guy is phenomenal. It wasn't just being able to pull of the character of Ryan Hardy, but also the chemistry he had with James Purefoy. Joe Carroll is one of the best villains I've seen since Hannibal Lechter and the chemistry Purefoy has with Bacon, easily rivals that of Hopkins and Foster.

The show is made even stronger by a tremendous support cast of complicated characters, all of whom have their own hidden past and issues that are brought to the table. Movie actor, Shawn Ashmore is terrific as the young agent who wants nothing more than the praise of his idol, Ryan Hardy. The boss is played by Annie Parisse, perhaps best known as A.D.A. Alex Borgia on Law & Order.

This show really has deep, well developed characters, that you get quickly attached to, and every time you think you know what's coming they throw a curve ball at you. The Following is such a strong story, that is so well written, that it really has the chance of being on the air for years.

Season one is now streaming on Netflix and season two debuts on Fox in January. I really can't wait to get there. Rarely do I watch shows on the air, I prefer to wait for the DVD to avoid the commercials and watch as much or as a little as I want. The Following is different though, because this show was just so amazing to me, that I honestly can't wait to see what season two has in store for me. I am more than willing to sit through the commercials in order to get there that much faster, and I think once you've seen this show, you'll feel the exact same way.",1384214400,47,3815,4.474137931034483
5359136,3,B009OD8XQC,"An average crime drama about a (surprise!) serial-killer mastermind who manages to create a following of other (not particularly brainy) individuals willing to kill for his cause and kill in general. At least part of his cause seems to be to lock horns against tough guy FGI agent (Kevin Bacon) who helped to put him in jail in the first place.  Pure formula and not necessarily a bad idea.  If you like your crime dramas to be mostly action: chase scenes, multiple who-is-going-to- kill-or-be-killed predicaments, graphic violence--you might enjoy this.  Nothing is held back from the audience--we have all the answers to who and why.  It's a matter of if, when and how the FBI--will bring down the cult of killers.  However, if you prefer more mental sparring between characters, intrigue and a more brainy story in general, you will find this to be clunky entertainment at best.  It is tiresome to watch the FBI always several steps behind making one dumb compromising decision after another.  The following itself seems to be a collection of dimwits and misfits who somehow are always in the right place at the right time to carry out the Mastermind's bidding--often having the uncanny ability to openly kill someone in a public place and then simply walk away from the crowd with no one doing anything to stop them (not one US citizen exercising his/her right to own a gun?).  Then there is the Mastermind himself for whom, other than a smarmy accent and smirk, there is no explanation as to exactly how he is a mastermind and how he is able to seduce such a well-organized legion while in jail without anyone who matters (like maybe the FBI?) suspecting anything. What seems to be his overriding purpose is to write a worthy book and win his wife back but it all seems so half-baked by the time he easily starts mentally unraveling.  Oh, and then there's the nod to his intellectualism--his love of Edgar Allen Poe and his imagery. A bit obvious.",1384128000,2,1952,4.7514792899408285
5359137,2,B009OD8XQC,"I was happy to find this series because I really like Kevin Bacon and the genre was right up my alley. I enjoyed the first episode with only a few instances of lazy writing. Where you think, for a split second or longer, that it defies common sense for what just happened to have happened. As each episode progressed those glaring, shattering leaps from point A to point Z derailed the good acting and a passable concept. I am really getting tired of them making a serial killer into some super Machiavelli but I could have tolerated that. I finally gave up when they showed a woman scrambling to unlock a deadbolted door to escape her captor who was running down the hall towards her and she left it standing wide open so he could run through it without even slowing down.",1383868800,3,773,4.450704225352113
5359138,3,B009OD8XQC,"When you take a step back and look at the premise of this series, it's more than a bit insane. Given that, once you drink that Kool-Aid it works. They play it pretty well.

Here's the scoop. Ryan Hardy (Kevin Bacon), ex-FBI, is asked by the bureau to help in murder investigations that seem to be related to Joe Carroll (James Purefoy) a serial killer that Hardy collared years earlier. The investigation points to a large group of acolytes under Carroll's spell. Can Hardy round these people up.

On the bad side is the premise. It's difficult to maintain a cult if the chief dude is in prison, even with the tight network these folks have in place. It simply isn't believable. Also, Carroll's plan is so far reaching, and so detailed, it has to fail because you're dealing with human beings, and even the slightest miscalculation can throw things off. I also had a problem with this many people being so bloodthirsty. The body count is way too high.

On the good side you have some good characters and some good actors playing them. And the paranoia machine is cranked up because you don't know who is and who isn't in the cult. This leads to some nifty plot turns.

It's written well enough and directed well enough. But, when you put it next to series such as ""The Killing"" and ""The Bridge"" it looks a little silly. Due to a minor injury, I watched all 15 episodes over a three day period. Had I watched it in weekly installments the goofiness might not have been quite so apparent, but as it stands, this shouldn't go to the top of anyone's 'to watch' list.",1383177600,3,1562,4.470175438596491

Shockingly superficial developments, lack of the slightest resemblance of rationality and unbelievable/unrelatable characters, no patience with the writing. It seems more like theatre than TV, everything is exaggerated to a point of hilarity. No subtlety, it's all very quickly done with little appreciation of human nature. Tries to live off its shock value, both in the gratuitous violence and the ridiculously simplistic unrealistic developments and characters.

To me the acting is also poor, especially of the followers, they are so theatrical, doesn't suit motion picture. Kevin Bacon is also unimpressive but there's not much he could have done with the lousy script. It's all very lifeless.

Very disappointing, spend your time watching some insightful documentaries instead.

5359184,3,B009OD8XQC,"Oh, man. This was a show I really wanted to love. It has two of my favorite actors, Kevin Bacon and James Purefoy. It has a solid supporting cast with the likes of Natalie Zea, Annie Parrise and Shawn Ashmore. It seemed to have a solid plot.

However, in THE FOLLOWING, Fox's latest attempt to get more ""edgy"", it bludgeons the viewer with every single possible cliche in almost every episode. It's a veritable clown car of character tropes, red herrings, laughably bad dialogue, abysmal plotting, and narcoleptic performances.

Here's the plot: Ryan Hardy (Bacon) is a former FBI profiler who was once involved with the chase, and ultimately the capture, of charismatic college professor and failed writer (and co-ed serial killer) Joe Carroll (Purefoy), whose killings have the shared theme of Edgar Allan Poe-style murders. Hardy is wounded badly in the capture and now has a pacemaker. Since the capture, he's drowned himself in alcohol and wrote a book about the Carroll case. Suddenly, Carroll escapes his maximum-facility incarceration and intends to continue his murder spree with his ""following""; a cult of various murderous misanthropes who have all been bitten by the crazy bug. Hardy is brought back into the fray, so that Carroll can continue his game of cat and mouse with Hardy, but with Carroll's followers, all who have impossibly played out various roles of importance to Hardy and the people around him, remain one step ahead. It's SILENCE OF THE LAMBS meets The Manson Family.

Showrunner Kevin Williamson, who rightly made a name for himself with the SCREAM films, has very little faith in the target audience for a show of this type. It's a consistent insult to the intelligence of those who watch the show as the FBI and Hardy stumble around like the Keystone Kops, feebly attempting to quell the murders, but also to save Carroll's ex-wife (Zea) who Ryan is in love with, and Carroll's son. It's as if none of the pursuing forces have more than three or four brain cells functioning at any given time, EXCEPT when the plot requires them to suddenly become brilliant.

With maybe the exception of Purefoy, every cast member, especially Bacon, seems to just be cashing a check here. Bacon has never EVER been as dull as his performance is in this show. Even he seems to be asking himself, ""Why am I in this idiotic show?"" as he lumbers from plot point to plot point. Purefoy at least seems like he's having some fun here playing Hannibal Lec... ahem... I mean, Joe Carroll as he chews his way through most of the scenery in the show.

So why three stars? Because at the end of every episode, after I've been screaming at the television about how stupid the FBI are, I find myself taken with the idea that the series in and of itself is a long-form parody of these types of stories. Williamson was all about playing against the stereotypes while playing with them in SCREAM, and for whatever reason, I believe that this show is somehow totally aware of how bad it is, and is willing to keep making itself more and more idiotic and implausible as the season went on.

Either that, or THE FOLLOWING is really one of the worst shows in recent memory. It's probably the latter, but I kind of hope it's the former.",1379548800,4,3230,4.707964601769912

We set our TiVo to tape the entire season, but one episode failed...Amazon Instant made it easy to get the single episode and watch it commercial free quickly to keep us up to speed.

I was somewhat disappointed that after watching the first 5 episodes (continuously) it started crashing on me. Amazon Tech support were not helpful. In the end a good old fashioned computer re-start sorted the situation.,1376179200,,312,4.90566037735849

But still, as I said, not bad. Haven't finished season one yet, but have watched 4 episodes. Luckily, I'm at the age (63) where no matter how gruesome something is, it just doesn't stay with me.

5359268,5,B009OD8XQC,I saw a few episodes of the following when it first aired and couldn't wait to see what happened next.

Also, the police work was stupid in some places - we were yelling at the TV at the bad choices. I had high hopes, but no. I won't be watching a second season.",1373673600,5,280,3.9298245614035086
5359298,5,B009OD8XQC,Kevin Bacon is great- Natalie Zea is great. I think the feloow who played the srial killer-guru was totally miscast and irt through off the balance in the story. He was neither hypnotic nor rea;;y threatening. Glad he's gone. Last episode was huge.,1373587200,2,248,4.790697674418604

Kevin Bacon is awesome as not soo perfect hero but definitely his heart in the right place. One likes him due to his genuine human nature.  Joe is very believable as the bad guy in a Manson kind of way, he make us hate him and the blinding influence over the others. This show kept me entertained at the edge if my seat as I kept watching I wanted more.",1373328000,,475,4.096774193548387

5359325,1,B009OD8XQC,This was pretty horrible.  I couldn't make it through the first half of the pilot.  Graphically violent and not even well made.  The acting was so-so.  Female characters were not compelling or believable.,1372896000,2,204,5.090909090909091
5359326,1,B009OD8XQC,"The pilot was promising but the show went downhill very fast, with dumb and implausible plot lines, boring talky dialogue, and excessive and gratuitous violence. The whole premise seemed to revolve around the killer's obsession with the detective - but who cares? Not I. No real motivation was presented. Kevin Bacon's role in every single episode consists of shooting dead all the likely suspects who could provide any useful information. Head of talking to them first? Every single story line consists of Bacon killing a suspect on the scene and the police backup and swot team for this supposedly deadly major plot arriving hours later, like the Keystone cops. Every-time any major break in the plot was announced to the police, they sent Bacon and an expendable partner detective who could conveniently get shot/beaten/captured. The so-called villain was also utterly implausible and also pretty boring after too long. There was no plot development. Having paid for the thing, I eventually fast forwarded through the final episodes simply to get to the end. In short, don't waste your time or money. Go for some decent Nordic Noir instead of this mainstream American trash.",1372636800,8,1177,5.135416666666667

If you like suspense, action and plot twists/turns, you will love ""The Following.""  Every episode was built on the one before it and there were no dull moments.  I recommend this if you are a fan of ""Criminal Minds,"" ""Bones"" and other such programs.

The cast, the storyline (and the pacing of that storyline), the music, every aspect of this show just really had me hooked. I love anything with dark themes and disturbed/disturbing characters and jaw-dropping plot twists. You always think you know what's going to happen in this series, but then suddenly the story takes a turn you didn't see coming. I get that many feel that some of the pieces of the story are not super realistic, but personally I watch television for one reason: to be entertained, and that's just what this show is, pure entertainment.

5359375,1,B009OD8XQC,"Warning: some minor spoilers here but hopefully I can convince you to not waste time and money on this show. While the plot sounds like something I should be very interested in, this show was painful to watch. Every episode left me angry over how stupid they make every protagonist out to be. I understand they have to keep the plot running and if the good guys are too good, the bad guys would be caught and the show would be over. But instead, they've made the bad guys seem like they can predict the future and the good guys not know their a** from a hole in the ground. They want you to believe that a large group of random strangers on the internet suddenly became obsessed with this one serial killer in prison and are able to coordinate an intricate plan among everyone that infiltrates and outsmarts every level of law enforcement. Meanwhile, the FBI ""experts"" are the dumbest, most incompetent people on the planet. I think what it comes down to is lazy writing.  Let's put one cop on surveillance detail so that person you thought was innocent can show their true evil colors and get away. Need backup? Let's send Kevin Bacon and one other FBI agent to make sure that everybody gets away. Have the house surrounded? Someone on the SWAT team is a follower. The main bad guy breaks out of jail TWICE FFS!!!",1370822400,40,1314,4.475

5359377,4,B009OD8XQC,"I think the Following is a great new addition to television. The dynamics of the acting and storyline are great. First, to collect some of the best actors around for a TV season is fantastic! Each brings a sense of professionalism and character to the roles they portray.

The one criticism I have of the series though is the sometime preposterous situations that the characters get into. Stupidity abounds at times, and realism suffers when the directors decide to put the characters into tense situations without help. For instance, Kevin Bacon's character is often at the center of the gun-play or fight sequences, despite him not being an active FBI agent. Where is the backup? Often times, there are only a few FBI agents around (or one/none is some ridiculous sequences) and Bacon's character is leading the way and frankly, he has more kills then the entire force we have seen so far. I understand the leading character thing, but come on!

Other than that though, the pacing is excellent most of the time, the characters strong (with good back-story representation with flashbacks - too many sometimes, but it definitely adds to the story richness), and the story keeps you engaged.

I highly recommend the series, but you will need to leave your realism hat at the door with some frequency.",1370736000,,1299,4.868778280542986
5359378,4,B009OD8XQC,"In my opinion Kevin Bacon is a terrific actor, as is his wife. He can portray both sides of good/evil very effectively and his being in a movie or series entices me to watch it. The Following was no exception and I did try to stay with it for 5 episodes, however it is way too dark for me. I don't really enjoy watching movies or series about psychopathic serial killers; I'd rather see a scary creature movie (less reality since I don't expect to encounter those types of monsters in daily life). Even still, I was reluctant to stop watching because of the quality of the show and the actors.",1370736000,,593,4.351351351351352
5359379,5,B009OD8XQC,"This is one of the best TV shows right now, if not the best. At first, Ryan Hardy's character seams to be very unorganized and not well positioned into the show as a whole. I mean would you really run after a killer, whom almost killed you, into a house at night without a gun? Probably not, but Ryan's character really does mold into a beautiful craft of art. This show will keep you on your toes trying to figure out what's going on, and the plot twist are transformed flawlessly throughout the series. It's really a very neat and engaging experience as a viewer that leaves you in the end very unsettled yet well anticipated for what's to come next in the life of Ryan Hardy.",1370649600,,678,4.346456692913386

5359510,1,B009OD8XQC,"This TV series must be the WORST on TV at the moment.

The plot - too ridiculous to say the least. This psycho is so 'clever' that he has managed to make a bunch of fools to do his dirty work. What's more, the FBI are even more STUPID than this psycho's apprentice. With all the resources at their disposal, the FBI just keep messing things up.

There are countless 'unreasonable' and 'ridiculous' plots...one just stands out the most so far is the psycho's lawyer. After having two of her fingers chopped off by one of his henchmen, she continues to help Joe because she is 'scare'??? Ah... she is a lawyer, right? She is supposed to be smart, right? And, has she even called the police? No...And in any case, she goes to the prison, shaking with fears I might add, and does as Joe asks. Seriously?

The plot is just too 'perfect'...It is almost like knowing what is going to happen and then go backwards to complete the gaps.

The writer is a complete moron and I don't even want to comment why there are so many people who give this show 5 stars... If it was up to me (and had a choice), I would give this stupid show zero star!

Check out some of the comments from other like-minded individuals - they have all already said what I wanted to say.

The first episode is kind of intense, but it deteriorates preciptiously thereafter. Being open-minded, we watched a couple more. Well, yesterday my wife and I watched this utterly idiotic TV series for the last time.",1368489600,8,1467,4.4148148148148145

I saw the whole series because a friend liked it, and I wanted to be able to discuss it with her. Most stories require some leap of faith, but once I accept a premise, I like it to be subject to the laws of physics and the real world in some partly recognizable way.  This series stretched incredulity too far, past the breaking point. The cult couldn't always be so lucky, the FBI so stupid and unlucky, and where was all the huge amounts of money coming from that bought the helicopter, paid the pilots, bought the compound, etc.?  I love The Walking Dead, Breaking Bad, Justify, etc., so it's not like I don't have an imagination but this just underestimated its audience.  I won't watch an episode of season 2.

Was preparing to give this 5 stars up until the final 3 minutes. In the final minutes they did the predictable thing and resorted to the tired and way over used ""Cliff Hanger"" ending. Really disappointing. This was a great 15 episode story. Like a great book, it should have had a great ending with some finality to it. Instead, leaving both Hardy and Claire stabbed and bleeding on the floor was nothing more than an unimaginative hook to get people to tune in for season 2.
There is no rule that says that all stories have to have a happy ending. The series 24 proved that for 7 of their 8 seasonS. Just wish that the writers and producers of The Following had more confidence in their own abilities and NOT have to resort to this type of cheap theatrics.

Kevin Bacon is a retired FBI agent who is reactivated due to his expertise in nabbing the cult leader in the first place (not super original at this part, but still fun).  The show excels in myriad ways mostly revolving around a not-so-difficult-to-understand plot as well as the excitement inevitably born from a story line invested in what the cult and its leader are going to plan to do next and how Ryan Hardy (Bacon) is going to stop them.

5359668,4,B009OD8XQC,"I waited until I had view all the episodes before setting out to write a review. I did love the entire series. I will say though some of the plot turns were crazy and the FBI sometimes behaved as would the keystone cops. The most interesting thing in this show is the characters. The story line can be way out their but like Joe Carrol says ""we need Charactors the audience can invest in"" and love and hate for a story to be well liked. This show did that more than any other I have watched on TV in a long time. Kevin Bacon is an incredible actor and was before this show came along so that was not surprising he was the best in this show. James Purfoy's acting was quite surprising and I would gauge he should be up for many awards come award time. I would recommend this show to anyone who likes criminal minds, CSI, or law and order. It is an emotional ride that doesn't end til the last show and then when you think alls well that ends well- they get'cha again. I do hope that they will bring this show back next season.",1367366400,,1025,4.13

Not to mention the FBI continuing to use a former agent who refuses to not follow orders.  Give me a break.  If we totally eliminated all the foolishness of the law enforcement and wrote the major portion of the script around the cult and their leaders, the show would move quicker.  Kevin Bacon makes a better villain than hero, so I would have cast him in the role of the cult leader/professor/serial killer.  So far, the writing does keep your attention but if this story does not start showing law enforcement in a better light, it may go the way of the TV shows Alcatraz and Hotel 666.

5359690,5,B009OD8XQC,The Following has a plot full of suspense and great actors to deliver it. Throughout the entire series I have been constantly wondering what will happen next and pleasantly surprised at how it manages to keep me on the edge of my seat with every episode. Kevin Bacon plays a hero that you almost hate to root for and James Purefoy plays a villain you almost hate to root against. Both give you a sense that no one is purely good or purely evil. I recommend  this series to anyone who is a fan of crime thrillers as it will hook you right away.,1367107200,2,543,4.221153846153846
5359691,5,B009OD8XQC,"I'm not a person who watches much tv but I have seen all the episodes of the Following. I love this tv show because it's action packed and exciting plus the acting is amazing (especially Kevin Bacon and James Purefoy). If you're looking for a realistic show though, this is not it. On the other hand, if you think ""realistic"" police procedural shows are boring like I do, you'll enjoy this one. Yes, there are a lot of killings but they keep the action going. That said, if gore and violence disturb you, again, it's not for you. By the way, if the FBI was as ""smart"" as some people think they should be in this show and figured things out quickly, there wouldn't be enough content for a full season, as the killer would have already been captured. The FBI's failures keep the show going and honestly, officials are human and make mistakes in real life situations too.",1367107200,3,868,4.465408805031447

5359713,3,B009OD8XQC,"This is a good nail biter kind of show with twists and turns, but they make the FBI, and all law enforcement, seem like idiots.  They are always splitting up when searching places where the suspects are supposedly hiding.  And shocker, some of them always end up getting killed or kidnapped.  Somehow, the suspects always seem to escape, typically due to a lack of manpower.  Seriously, if there was a cult of serial killers, do you think the Feds would send less than 100 agents to take them down?  Of course not, they'd send hundreds, if not thousands.

My wife and I find ourselves often guessing the plot before it happens whenever someone splits up or the suspects start running away.  So I guess you could say it's predictable given the way the plot has gone so far.  However, they do throw some good twists and turns in every now and again to throw you off.

Whoever said that they thought it was dull is an idiot. Before the show even aired I was excited to see it. I get a little nervous when the promos for a t.v. series look so good that you can't wait to watch it. I am usually let down because they show all the good parts/everything that is interesting about the sitcom in the 90 second previews before it even starts. That was definitely not the case with The Following. I was excited to see it and let me tell you, it did not disappoint. Kevin Bacon plays his role spectacularly well as does James Purefoy. The cast members of Joe Carroll's ""cult"" are eerily accurate in their roles of playing psychopaths. I especially love Jacob. His very well acted transformation from a follower to a hard core bad ass psycho was brilliant. He is definitely one of my favorite characters along with Shawn Ashmore who plays FBI Agent Mike Weston. Mike's character starts out in what you assume will be a small role and then he becomes a royal bad ass. Beyond those specifically mentioned, the show is well cast and the acting is spot on. So far, this season is amazing. I'm having a little trouble figuring out what they will do for a second one but I am excited to see. It is definitely a show that you have to watch from beginning to end. You cannot just jump in at say episode 6 because you would be completely lost. If you haven't seen it I highly recommended you giving it a shot. You can watch it from the beginning on Hulu. And even if you think it starts out a little slow give it a chance. You won't be disappointed. It is the best show on t.v. right now.",1366761600,2,1733,4.207207207207207

However, it has become predictable and a little bit excessive.  They've strayed away from the Edgar Allan Poe theme in the last half of the series, and focused more on how stupid the FBI is... If the FBI is this ignorant, everyone should own a semi-automatic because we are screwed (hence only 4 stars).  I like dark shows, and this one provides twists and turns that the viewer can't always imagine, so I respect the need to create a good amount of AH HA moments.

The serial killer was interesting for awhile, but I just couldn't take his foil, Kevin Bacon, seriously after a few episodes.

Twisted individuals joining a cult where they learn how to kill and feel no remorse. I have become a bit paranoid watching this. You never know who the killer is. Basically it is sick and twisted and mesmerizing. The leader is extremely charismatic and handsome. I can't stop watching even though I realize this can not be healthy or normal veiwing material for a mother of seven to watch. Addicted and waiting for more.,1366588800,2,590,4.5233644859813085

5359745,5,B009OD8XQC,"This show has some gruesome imagery, and may lack depth in some of its characterizations, but it is a weirdly engrossing thriller, and it succeeds for those with the stomach for such things.  The writers try hard to provide some of the motivation for the unspeakable crimes committed by the Followers, but most of the emotional impact comes from the interplay between Kevin Bacon's damaged FBI ex-agent Ryan Hardy, Natalie Zea's Claire Carroll, the show's only well-balanced character, and James Purefoy's Joe, who is characterized as a serial killer, but who is so much more.  I enjoy that the FBI team tracking Joe is composed of such baggage-laden individuals, each with a propensity to act impulsively in their pursuit, giving the plot an edge of unpredictability.  One ploy that's getting a bit tired, though, are repeated approaches by supposedly sympathetic Followers, who then turn to lethally attack the FBI team when they have let their guard down.  But it's Joe's character and actions that provide the show's greatest strength and its greatest weakness.  His apparent charisma as a teacher is mirrored by his diabolic power and mind-control as recruiter of murderous followers.  His use of pre-existing fringe networks as talent pools and their organization as an instrument of his unfolding master plan is ingeniously shown, as well as all the tech-gimickry of secret websites, untraceable sat phones,etc.  The weakness, for me at least, is the simple question, ""who's paying for all this?""  Joe is a college professor, failed novelist, and a cult leader.  His organization appears to have the military armament, tech resources, and funding of a sponsored terror network, just like on 24 (which would have had oil money, blood diamonds, or a drug smuggling cartel behind it).
His Followers are many, but no one has been shown to be his financial ""Angel"".  But if you can set your rational skepticism aside you can enjoy a weekly occurrence of white knuckles gripping your sofa arm or that of anyone you're with.",1366243200,2,2024,5.069277108433735

5359751,1,B009OD8XQC,"There is so much to say about this television show and I'm not sure I can cover it all, none of which is good. The only good thing about the show is that they managed to cast Kevin Bacon in it and he is usually a guaranteed sign of quality. I take that back, there is something else that is good about the show; the premise of it. The first two episodes of ""The Following"" are promising in the sheer sense that the show COULD have great promise. A serial killer. A back story. A detective with a history and a relationship with the serial killer's wife. A serial killer who can commit crimes from prison due to a cult following of psychos. All of these great ideas are squandered.

The reasons why these ideas are squandered is, in my opinion, for one simple reason: ""The Following"" is trying to be ""24"". In an effort to be relentless, non-stop, intense action and thrills, ""The Following"" throws an event at you every five minutes. Therefore, instead of being intelligently fleshed out, it is hastily fleshed out. Every five minutes the show opens itself up for continuous ridicule for stupid teenage criminals, stupid FBI agents who should have known better, criminals who aren't tracked or followed, or just plain illogical assumption story archs. Instead of the creators doing some research and giving us a reason to think that Joe Carroll (the serial killer) is brilliant, we are left to just assume so.

Instead of being intelligently thought out, the show relies upon gimmicks; murderers who don't murder but talk, murderers who have no reason to leave someone alive but do because that person isn't supposed to die yet, victims explaining why the murderer didn't kill them, ""He said he didn't kill me because a live hostage would slow you down more than a dead one.""  Oh, he did huh? Well that was nice of him.... thanks for the info. A detective held by three teenage murderers whittling through his ropes with a hidden knife and they don't see it despite all of them standing ten feet away. Then you have a serial killer who just calls the detective pretty much every episode and has a nice chat and tells him how screwed he is.

Mainly though, the ""24""ish format to the show asks the creators to explain escapes and FBI blunders every five minutes and after about 10 of those, or two episodes, the gimmick is over. Then when it continues, the show becomes eye-roll boring and has absolutely zero tension. The tension has no intelligence to it. There is zero tact to the show. Where a show like ""CSI"" would take the time to explain some of the reasoning or how things happened or worked, ""The Following"" doesn't have time for that, and when it does, the explanation is ridiculous.

Nobody should be giving this show 5-stars in my opinion. NOBODY. This is not a great show. Nowhere close. Is it a terrible show, like my 1-star suggests? I think so. Maybe that is too harsh. Yet when I see a show that has so much promise and lucky people are making MILLIONS OF DOLLARS to entertain us and they give us something that absolutely ANYBODY with basic writing skills could write, you can't be too harsh. When the writers and directors have zero TACT or make no attempt to be intelligent in their tact, but just give you every horror/thriller cliche in the book and expect you to drool and return every week.  No thanks. 1-star baby. That's what you get for your lack of effort.",1366156800,26,3381,4.570957095709571

5359757,2,B009OD8XQC,"I really like the TV show ""Dark Minds.""  It's one of those rare shows that I really look forward to the next episode, kind of like ""The X Files"" a long time ago, at least before that show went off the rails in its last couple of seasons.  I really like the interplay between M. William Phelps and John Kelly; I always get a really good chuckle when 13, or Raven, makes some mysterious comment and either the author or profiler looks up at the other in dismay.

I just read part of a review, written by Raven, of the show ""The Following.""  Now, for those of you who haven't seen ""Dark Minds,"" Raven is the pseudonym of the real-life serial killer who helps Mr. Phelps and Mr. Kelly during profiling sessions.  Raven is now behind bars, but he is allowed 15 minutes a call, to give an opinion on some unsolved crime.  Now, if anyone knows what he's talking about when it comes to serial killers, it would be Raven.  After all, practice makes perfect.  And evidently, he's had a lot of practice.  And I was very happy to see that Raven hates ""The Following"" nearly as much as I.

I watched the first episode of ""The Following"" and only made it through the first half.  Raven turned it off after 40 minutes.  To me, the biggest problem with this faade-of-a-serial-killer-show:  everyone is in constant crisis mode.  The real world doesn't work this way.  People have down time; they drink coffee every once in a while!  But watching Kevin Bacon -- and his coworkers here -- you'd think they're all on speed.  Man, I say:  kick it down a notch every once in a while!  There are other issues, but this issue alone is sufficient to make me change the channel.

One issue that I had with Raven's analysis:  he said that serial killers don't engage the police.  Now, that is usually the case; most serial killers are smart enough to avoid attention.  However, what about killers such as Zodiac?  He is one of quite a few that seemed to enjoy toying with the police.  But otherwise, I liked Ravens critique of ""The Following,"" a show that I won't be following at all, just like Raven.

But I will be following ""Dark Minds.""  I guess the season ends this week.  Bummer.  Well, I can watch one more show and then I'll have to wait until fall for the next episode.  I'd recommend following ""Dark Minds,"" and dumping ""The Following"" from your queue.  You won't be following unwatchable TV that way.",1366070400,2,2384,4.461716937354988

And I'm not opposed to things being ridiculous or violent, but the combination of the two in a show that takes itself sooooooo seriously is just incongruous.

But of course it totally sucks you in and once you start, you cannot stop.  Every episode ends with a decent cliff-hanger (and a quick montage on a bed of goth rock, which makes it even harder to figure out if the whole show is a joke) and the concept of the show is compelling.

I mean, they monitored George Zimmerman's phone calls and found out he had more money than he claimed, but they won't monitor a convicted serial killer???

5359776,2,B009OD8XQC,"I think this series is the main cause of why my blood pressure is escalating whenever I pay attention to it. I was never fond of Police/Investigation/Crime shows except for a few here and there. My friend insisted this was a good show to watch and don't get me wrong for the first 5 or so episodes it was thrilling and engaging but it doesn't take long for the viewer to realize that the plots just keep dragging on and on and are quite repetitive. In short the fault doesn't lie with the actors but with the plot itself, it's ridiculous even for a TV show.

Joe Carrol a former college professor, is well the villain the title ""The Following"" is based on his ability to reach out for those unloved/unwanted/outcast civilians who also suffer from a disease called psychopathy or otherwise known in today's pop culture Psycho. He more or less uses these people to form an organization that's going to follow his lead of serial murders, kidnappings, torture and all the inhuman activities ever invented to help him write the greatest novel alive which will be based on the real life of these murders. Not Only that he also chooses Ryan Hardy the former FBI agent who had an affair with Joe Carrol's ex wife and was the reason behind his capture a couple of years ago to be the patroness of this great work of literature that he's preparing. But that's not the point. The Point is the bad people are all intellects, sophisticated, dominating, sneaky and have a good strategy. While the good guys on the other hand, are hopeless and by hopeless I mean they can't do anything to save their lives and as a ramification of that the bad guys keep winning over and over while the good once lose everything.

I just got bored, the endless killings of civilians in the name of this literally work while no one's able to catch them in the act is a tad unbelievable. The ability of Joe Carrol to brain wash as many people to join him in his little killing spree is just unrealistic and strange especially when we come to realize he was doing it while he was behind bars through the internet? Seriously! Come Join me in my quest of criminal activties and you'll get a chapter in my upcoming book! Yeah, no one will buy that!

The minions are pathetic, losers who killed their (-------) and ran away with it cause the authorities are so dumb to catch them especially when they're already suspects entering a freaking Jail to visit a death row criminal who's responsible for the killing of 14 young girls. Did You get that? He's a mass murder and still gets unlimited jail visit times to interview his minions.

Just, don't let me go any further I could go on and on and on about how stupid and impossible this situation would be in real life but I don't think my ramblings will end.

Not to mention, he escapes prison again! and his followers fly him through a helicopter don't ask me how they afforded it unless they killed it's passengers to a huge mansion where he'll be crowned as their King. If this was happening in some medieval legend I might have bought that but in the real world in modern times with all this technology?

I don't really know what the writers of this show are trying to portray by doing all of this? Is it for the sake of entertainment alone? Cause if it is let me tell you it's quite repetitive. Unless the writers have this hate for the FBI and just want to portray them as useless then fine. Whatever!

They constantly go wandering separated and alone into dark corridors when they have the experience of the last 5 times they did it and some of their people got killed every time. I guess the lazy writers have to do this to keep this ridiculous story line of the uncatchable cult moving forward. It's a joke.

5359797,1,B009OD8XQC,"I was excited to start watching this new Kevin Bacon show. The topic seemed to be up my alley.
Couldn't even make it through 1 episode. Too violent in an unnecessary way. I am shocked that was even allowed on Fox. Just a few years ago The X-Files was the most risque thing on that channel. I would take their black ooze any day over this. This was a level violence that you can only enjoy if perhaps you like watching movies with torture scenes.

So, first episode, the main character is so unhappy, he is drinking all day. I probably would be pretty unhappy too, if I had to look at tortured dogs, and see a woman strip down and stab herself through the eye into her brain - only on the first episode, people! So, we decided to turn the TV off.

Later on, out of boredom we tried to watch part of an episode where the woman Kevin Bacon saved a while back, suddenly gets murdered because her gay neighbors are members of this murderous cult. Riiight. So, we will not even watch it out of boredom anymore. A show where there are murderous cult followers is just going to go on forever, and it has been done before. Have you heard of The Mentalist? Except The Mentalist often lends a comedic balance to the gore and sad situations. The Mentalist keeps going on season after season because everyone is a secret member of Red John's cult. So, I feel like The Following was a sorry, dark rip off of The Mentalist, which is a show I actually like. I am surprised The Following has been renewed. I hope to see Kevin Bacon in some better shows or movies more worthy of his calibur in the future.",1365033600,9,1587,4.286666666666667
5359798,2,B009OD8XQC,"For the first few episodes, my wife and I were really enjoying it. Then, well, it dawned on us that the FBI was more stupid about things than we would have been, or any cops on any TV show we've ever seen would've been, or even Barney Fife would've been. They don't screen people to see who has visited the villain, which would sort of be an easy thing to do. It would give them a short list of suspects, wouldn't it?

They have a never-ending string of folks to serve the same purpose as the red shirts on away teams for the original Star Trek series. Hanging out with Ryan is certain death for any character you've never seen before. Bad guys show up everywhere. 90% of the people Ryan has ever spoken to seems to be a part of this cult... yet they won't just scour the prison visitor logs? Half of the law enforcement community seems to be in the cult. It didn't take long for this to get to be a bit silly.

Finally, some members of the cult itself are portrayed as ""Constitutional Radicals"". There is a ""Don't Tread on Me"" flag on the wall of the cult's training camp. Seriously? This show is about people who love the US Constitution who happen to really like to kill people? Where did that come from? It's nonsense, and it is the straw that broke the camel's back for me.

I love the acting and the casting is awesome. Too bad the writers haven't the brains to make the story credible and to keep their socialistic bias in check.",1364947200,13,1436,4.272058823529412

I was barely able to get through the first episode of THE FOLLOWING, at which point I decided I would not be able to bear the agony of continuing to watch -- and vicariously experience -- the gut-wrenching terror of one person after another being so realistically tortured, then brutally murdered.

It jumped the shark for me right there and it will for you once they reveal the new lead special agent is part if the cult following, not the lead FBI female agent who was raped and whose parents were in a commune.

5359818,3,B009OD8XQC,"This show could be amazing, we love the basic plot.  To the people who think there are no serial killers with followers - please google The Manson Family.  For those who think that there are no highly intelligent psychos, Ted Bundy was a very intelligent man, and he like most male serial killers had a bunch of women who were obsessed with him after his final capture.  The psycho in this case has a relatively small group of followers and the point of the show is it is a cult - not a superstar serial killer.  I truly wish that these things were true in real life that there were not any super sharp psychos and that serial killers didn't have followers...it sickens me to know how many women spend time communicating their ""love"" to convicted killers they have never met and wouldn't know exist had they never killed.

The FBI being so idiotic and behind the ball is what makes this show so hard to watch.  As we watched the first couple of episodes both my husband and I said we loved the idea behind it but we felt they were going to continue to make the FBI look so dumb that it was going to be hard to watch in the future...if something doesn't change with this show we will stop watching.

It gets even more unbelievable when they have this group of supposedly ""sophisticated"" individuals up against the FBI, but their ""ops"" are sloppy at best yet they always easily defeat the FBI no matter how big their force is.  HIGHLY UNBELIEVABLE! Come on, an FBI agent that watches his 2 partners get gunned down in a hallway blocks off a door so you can't open it then stands in front of it!!?  What for, was he waiting to get shot, because other than that I suppose the bad guys could have taken the door off the hinges and come in that way without shooting through the door.  When Ryan and Claire left into that courtyard in the back of the hotel any ""sophisticated"" organization running that type of operation would have had some bad guys waiting outside in case anyone came out the back door of a hotel room.

Bottom line the show could be amazing but lacks any realistic action.  PLEASE hire someone to write your scenes that find the FBI and the cult going up against each other in a physically combative situation.  Get a writer that understands how the FBI actually works and make this show more feasible or you will lose out on viewers, people will put up with a certain amount of stupidity on tv but this is becoming one of those shows where the characters make so many bad decisions it is hard to watch.",1364428800,,2515,4.382795698924731

This show works best when one can suspend that nagging thought re: how a serial killer, while behind bars could have built up such an extensive network of recruits via seemingly unlimited visitors and unfettered Internet access (being escorted by the same guard/convert).

The production values are good, the actual ""followers"" are sufficiently creepy and there are suspenseful moments.  However, this may be one of the weakest network TV seasons in memory.  I don't believe that ""The Followers"" would rate *4 1/2 in a more superior network TV environment.

He seems to be struggling to be serious, pained and concerned.
Something is missing with his portrayal and believability, that he
actually feels his character to his heart and soul. Anger doesn't always
substitute for true fear, terror, anxiety, crazy-making conflicts and frustration.
This is my first episode, so I felt that perhaps he needs more time and experience
with the character to make it, Bacon's own.  Some one else commented that the script
needs to allow the mischievous and bright eye magic of Bacon to come out periodically.

It insults my intelligence. And , as cute I find Purefoy, I'm not buying what they're selling here. I have an easier time believing in demons and ghosts, than homicidal Lit. Majors ! I feel angry after I've watched. I can't believe it's been renewed. Further proof that all things FOX are suspect.",1363132800,24,644,4.512820512820513
5359864,5,B009OD8XQC,Loved this show right from the start.  There is no bad Kevin Bacon show. Story is incredible. Recommend strongly- you ont regret it.,1363132800,2,132,4.739130434782608
5359865,5,B009OD8XQC,"First and foremost I must confess that I adore James Purefoy. It has been ages since I've seen him on the small screen and I'm thrilled that others are able to discover what a brilliant actor he is. That being said, this is one of those shows that require patience and a good amount of devotion. This show isn't for the faint of heart. It is about a group of serial killers, not bunnies and children frolicking in the meadow! Simply put, it is violent, and contains disturbing and macabre scenes. Without the violence it would be another crime drama like 24 and Hawaii 50. If you continue to watch the episodes you will realize that the characters are developed gradually throughout the course of the series. Obviously the writers won't explain every single character's frame of reference/biography in a few episodes. It is set up like ""Lost"" in which every single episode reveals something else and you learn about the background of another character. Some may not appreciate that fact but I do. Everything is not explained and spelled out in one episode. The bad guys have more wins than the good guys. This may make it more difficult for a viewer that's used to happy endings but once you've become invested in the characters it ensures that the wins are far more thrilling, emotional, and meaningful. The rest of the cast is decent. Normally, I'm not an avid fan of Kevin Bacon, but he is excellent as a tortured former federal agent. The cat and mouse games between the two leads are thrilling, and clever. Does this show have flaws? Of course! Some of the actions on the part of the police and FBI are questionable and frankly stupid. However, I for one don't care. I don't watch this show for realism, I watch it for entertainment, and in that sense it succeeds. In short, this is definitely worth watching.",1363132800,2,1814,4.636645962732919
5359866,2,B009OD8XQC,"I am finally moving on. I wanted this to be really great, but very disappointing. Too much violence, over and over again. Most is predictable and stupid. I sure like Kevin Bacon, but not in this one. The writing is bad. I like cult stories, but this one is silly. Oh, well there are still good series to watch. Most of them are European though. Try the English, Swedish and Danish crime dramas. Class act writing, acting and directing.",1363132800,3,435,4.518987341772152

I think they do a good job after the 3rd episode of building out the characters.  Each show leaves with such a cliff-hanger I can hardly wait for the next episode.  Interesting story line although I'll be very curious how they can keep it going after 1 season... seems to be the trend lately where shows fizzle out after one season of a strong plot.  Stringing plots along season to season is key and many shows can't seem to succeed with that lately.

5359871,5,B009OD8XQC,"""The Following"" has me hooked!  I've been trying to catch this show on FOX, but for one reason or another haven't been able to so far.  Thank goodness for Amazon Instant Video and TV Pass I can now catch up on all the episodes I've missed and be sure to catch the rest of the season.  The pilot was fantastic; with Kevin Bacon, as Agent Ryan Hardy, who is called back to active duty when the serial killer he put on death row, Joe Carroll (James Purefoy) escapes.  The action is non-stop as we learn that Joe Carroll has managed to gain access to the internet and amass a ""following"" of sociopaths that will kill themselves and/or others at the whim of Carroll (Purefoy.) Kevin Bacon gives an excellent performance as a damaged hero, damaged physically at the hands of Joe Carroll from a stab wound that leaves Agent Hardy with a pacemaker to keep his heart beating; damaged psychologically from having dealt with the horrific ""art of a serial killer.""

Can't wait to watch the other episodes ...

5359884,3,B009OD8XQC,"I watch because of Kevin Bacon. Kevin is not his usual excellence. Why? I suspect because of his inexperience in acting in TV series. I understand though. It take time to prepare and Kevin does not have time enough to get into the acting. And the character Clair has the good fortune to have kissed Kevin and Timothy of Justified. Three stars because I know it will be better Season Two. I hope then a believable plot will be offered.

No, I will not pay for a Season Two, if there is one, which I say there will not be a Second season.

Kevin Bacon: Kevin needed easy money. He signed a contract for easy money. Kevin walks a thin line here. If I did not know Kevin, I would never watch a movie with him as a primary player - based on his performance in this series. And the story.  Way too predictable, way too easy devices to creat fear, for instance, the buried alive female character.

Value of each episode: $.75, yes, I mean to say 75 cents.

I just watched Episode 15.  The Joe Carrol character's accent is silly. The missed sniper shot of  the Ryan character hit another officer. Too obviously illogical to the plot. And so unbelievable. The final scenes are a mish-mash of several films and TV shows childishly done. Every scene is easily predictable. This series is silly. I assure you that I will not waste my money on a second season. Watch Justified for excellent acting by all, the viewer cannot predict what will occur. Justified is an hour long show that goes by so quickly because of the suspense that I think that I just watched a 10 second show.",1362528000,,1565,4.3944636678200695

And i am not going to compare it to novels or as in one review that actually got four stars,  talk about how much carnage there is, and how long it will take for some sick person to copy what they see on tv?  This is what everyone is giving 4 stars for?  The story is about a guy who is a genius.  He has a cult.  ""The Following""......Kevin Bacon a once, I think FBI agent, left the force, and was called back to help catch this guy and bring him in. But just cause he is in jail, doesn't mean his cult is not fully planned and doing as instructed. The force with Bacon's help is trying to solve all these bad things that keep coming up all through great planning of this psychopath.....In short Im sure we all have seen something like this in a movie at some point. But as for tv?  I think it's fresh, and Bacon and im sorry i don't remember his real name (the bad guy in jail), he is just amazing and perfect for this role. could not get any better than him. All the acting in this is First class all the way.  Very entertaining. This show will last as long as Bacon stays on. It's a six year contract. So if you like action, police shows, a little bit of cult thrown at you, then i think you will love this show. It's actually a rush. It moves fast when it needs to, and slows up for really intense moments. You really get to enjoy each scene. Great writing i think.  It is certainly worth at least watching the first two episodes to see if you like it.  My only complaint, is i wish they allowed Bacon a little more room to act.  Meaning to open up just a little. I understand he has a rough past, but allow him character to let one of the agents closer to him even a little. It will also allow Bacon to use more of his acting skills.  Great show.

5359935,3,B009OD8XQC,"First season for this, basic premise;  Bacon was involved in helping to capture a serial killer.  Serial Killer has some sort of bizarre hooks back to Edgar Allen Poe (eyes window to the soul, so pluck the eyes out and get creative, making death some sort of ""tribute to beauty"".  I don't think it's giving it away that the serial killer manages to escape (at least once from the prison...  Not much of a series if he just sits at the table?)  He moves out and about, and you find that by hook or crook this serial killer has been able to chat up a bunch of people via the internet;  Gather a bunch of creative killer wannabes (the following) and is setting out to punish Kevin for sleeping with his wife.  So, at this point, looks like each week is going to be some sort of killer trying to push Bacon in a specific direction.  Direction in this case appears to be getting him out of his personal funk and back on the stick (for whatever reason).

Not really my cup of tea, but then again Kevin Bacon over the years has supplied me with a lot of entertainment so I'm giving it a shot.

First couple of episodes, a few years ago would have been completely over the top with the staging of the corpses, today...  Well, sad to say it's pretty much par for the course.  Some of the character interactions... Well, not homophobic by any stretch, but then again I don't go out of my way to find TV series with male homological (Is that a word?) relationships in it.

Bacon's performance?  Considering he's a disgraced FBI agent of some type that has a pacemaker and a drinking problem.  He does a decent job, just not really the sort of character that you'd want to follow along with week by week, if they kept it that way.  The repressed anger, lack of trust / not playing well with others have given it some moments that are entertaining.

My take?  They've just started, barely out the gate, I have hopes that we're going to go along on a journey of redemption for Bacon's character.  But this is more where I'd like it to go as opposed to where I -know- it's going to go, we will all have to wait and see just where it heads.

So, sticking with it for season 1.",1361145600,3,2160,4.273399014778325

5359948,3,B009OD8XQC,"I've watched the first three episodes and I'm not hooked yet. This is being said as I'm a huge Bacon and Purefoy fan. I find most of the characters bland and uninteresting on the FBI side. Bacon is  decent, Purefoy is well - his normal charming self and as I've always said - is probably one of the better actors who can pull off a convincing villain. The rest of the cast? The killers are interesting. Their sub-plot makes you wonder how they got where the are and so you keep watching. But the FBI team? Are just ho-hum. I couldn't care less about them and glaring plot-holes aside? It's an 'ok' show. I'm hoping that it's a slow start and turns good at some point in the future. Cause right now? It's just a mediocre rehash of so many different serial killer genres crushed into one point.

5359949,3,B009OD8XQC,"I hate to say it because Kevin Bacon is such a skilled actor, but... I'm disappointed. Most murder movies are unrealistic in that real serial killers, albeit horrible, are not interesting enough to make good movies about. So of course fictional films and series have to be colorfully inventive. BUT: This particular plot is quite unrealistic and even after two episodes I started to get bored. And after three (you might ask why I keep watching!), it really is quite predictable. The villain himself has warned Kevin Bacon that he has quite a bit in store for him, and the viewers have already been startled by ""trustworthy"" people who turned out to be evil cult members. I am already predicting who will turn out to be part of the cult, and expecting someone to jump out of the closet at any moment. I have continued to watch it out of curiosity, but I don't think I will make it to the end of the series. I gave it three stars because the acting is good.",1360454400,3,956,4.468571428571429

The FBI sends one Agent to protect a woman from her estranged husband who has killed twice in one day?

Kevin Bacon goes into an empty house through the back door and spends five minutes before being attacked by a killer while two dozen FBI Agents and Police Officers mill around the front door?

A house the wife of a master mind mass murderer is surrounded by police to protect her from him and yet they have one Agent check out the house as she is going upstairs with him?

5359966,3,B009OD8XQC,"I really liked the basic concept -- a brilliant but deranged serial killer has developed an army of sleepers who continue to execute his plan despite being caught. When you think about the potential of how warped it can get, it's a clever formula that pushes the boundaries of procedural cop TV drama.

Unfortunately, rather than the main bad guy building a cult through religion or some political point of view, it centers around the writings of Edgar Allen Poe. Actually, it really centers around The Raven since the writers were too lazy to read anything else he wrote and have kept the references to what the average Fox viewer might have seen from a Simpsons Halloween special. And we're really suspending our disbelief here since our English-teacher-slash-killer has brainwashed his followers into very complicated crimes based upon some lectures on some arcane analysis of Poe's literature. Seriously? I'll buy into Homeland's brainwashed military hero turning to terrorism just because it's great television but this is like suggesting that readers of The Oatmeal are going to start murdering badgers.

That aside, the show has quickly descended into ""nutjob of the week"" territory and the overarching story line of the season isn't going anywhere fast. Bacon's tormented brilliant-but-alcoholic-investigator character gets less interesting with every episode. The writers seem to have forgotten the alcoholism problem completely and now it's simply a cat and mouse game between the hero and villain who are essentially opposite parts of the same person. If Homeland became ridiculous when Carrie discovered she was crazy, The Following jumps straight into absurdity with the main character's supposed weakness.

The crimes each week are really, really unbelievable. The followers show a near-telepathic level of prediction when it comes to breaking into people's houses and being able to act on highly detailed maniacal plans despite the main architect operating from a prison cell. It also reruns every horror movie cliche to the point where you know there's going to be a killer behind someone when they close the bathroom mirror. Although the extreme gore is there to make all this look very serious, I find myself laughing at each plot twist since I have as much luck convincing you to steal a pack of gum with this review as the killer has of making any of this happen through his Poe obsession.

Basically, The Following just reminds me how mediocre network programming is compared with cable shows like Dexter and Homeland. There was a great idea at the core of this series that has been wasted and given the laziness of the plot, I'm not confident that I'll be watching many more episodes.",1360108800,7,2706,5.115384615384615

Even the marvelous Kevin Bacon can't save the show. I wish he could because it's been too long since we've seen him on the screen.  This role is too one dimensional for him.

Yet, by the time the hour was up and next week's previews came on, I knew I wouldn't be able to stop watching.

One thing I hope the producers are careful about are who the ""followers"" turn out to be. A serial killer is in jail, and has a cult-like following on the outside (""the Followers"") doing his bidding. It has been shocking, during the last couple of shows, to find out that someone who you thought was perfectly nice, turns out to be a murderous follower. If they employ this tactic too often and too ""conveniently"", it will begin to lose its power.

Overall, I'm didn't like it enough to make it 'appointment' TV.",1359158400,3,366,4.397058823529412

5359996,1,B009OD8XQC,"The best thing about this new series is the cast. I was drawn to the series by K Bake, J Purfoy and Maggie Grace.  Whoever made this show needs to put them in something good. The concept of the ultra genius serial killer with a following has been done to death.  We have the same nutty professor and flawed but brilliant agent who must catch him.  Buckets of blood but not not fun blood like ""Dexter"".  The end of the first episode is  predictable.  I cannot see spending any time with this show unless I get drunk and pass out.  Plus POE?  Give me a break....if you are a smarty pants professor pick someone less obvious like Proust, or Joyce or Norman Mailer (who would have made a really interesting serial killer).  Please Canadians release the New Primeval!",1358812800,10,762,4.463768115942029
8543318,1,B009OD8XQC,"The Following is an easy premise to understand: serial killer, professor, and Edgar Allen Poe expert Joe Carroll escapes to initiate his overly complicated cat-and-mouse game against former FBI Agent Ryan Hardy. Hardy, having suffered life-alerting repercussions from that investigation, has been hitting the bottle hard and in a morose state when he's asked to track Carroll and put him back in bars. However, the escape is just the beginning. Once Carroll is back, it's revealed that Carroll has been busy creating a following, a cult that worships Carroll as his god and Poe as its religion. Hardy is forced to play in Carroll's elaborate chess match in which the enemy is everywhere, and the real purpose behind all of it is the true mystery.

Ugh. Good concept. In theory. The Following is supposed to be this slick, 'realistic' psychological crime show but it's riddled with so many issues that it about drives you nuts just 2-3 episodes in. The main problem is that every clich imaginable is in this show and glorified to the nth degree: From the inept police in general (this show does not paint a very good picture of LE at all), to the 'damaged but good-hearted-tragically tragic' FBI Agent Ryan Hardy to the novice, young, and puppy-eyed Agent Mike Weston, to the troubled but brilliant lead agent to the fragile and weak-minded lover to both the criminal mastermind and...on and on.

All these episodes are about bad people killing other people, which just masks a very weak plot that got more unbelievable and directionless with each episode. The killings and killers are all so convoluted and take up so much of what you see that it just gets boring after a while because that's all you watch in every episode with very little movement on anything else. Is there a point to all of this? I don't know. The writer's seem to be keeping that totally under wraps and you never really get an answer on anything. They tried so hard to create 'deep' characters and ended up presenting card-board caricatures that aren't appealing at all. It got so silly with all the stupidity going on and nothing actually going on... I get that part of the show is to demonstrate just how brilliant James Purefoy's character is and that he's completely fooled everybody but that in turn makes our 'heroes' hard to root for since they never make a right decision and continue to make the most asinine and overly dramatic choices. Maybe the writers are trying to portray a realistic and raw sort of lead hero and the human frailty in Hardy--and maybe he gets better in later seasons--but I had very little faith in Hardy or anyone on the show. The acting is okay, the production is fine, it's the writing and crappy character development of every character. The 'evil' guy is so over done in every possible way it's cringe-worthy; the British accent to the Poe religion to making his entire 'game' about Hardy and that he's ticked off he slept with is wife is just ridiculous. NONE of these characters are interesting, compelling, or even likable. In face, I could have cared less if Hardy himself was killed off, and he's the star of the show.

I only made it just past the hallway mark and I realized I was wasting my time with all the predictability and cheese clichs. And since Carroll's character is still in Season 2--guess he and his followers get away, like they *always* do and outsmarts everyone so I know I'm not missing out on much. It's just the same episode on repeat. I can't believe this show got 4 seasons but maybe it gets better--but this fist season is a definite miss and I don't care if it does get better. I won't be following, that's for sure.",1528588800,,3656,4.673913043478261

8543322,1,B009OD8XQC,"The first episode was rough. they got too emotional to fast with characters no one was attached to. gave it a chance and kept watching but its just too predictable. and the most unnerving part is how incompetent and downright stupid they make the FBI out to be it's ridiculous. I gave up at the point where the FBI called in new leadership and was concerned with one of the protagonists being too emotionally involved. so when one of the agents is abducted by a team of at least 4 people the FBI sends 2 frigging agents one of which being the emotional moron, with nothing more than Glocks, to an abandoned shipyard and no intel on the location. like really? and really it's sad because I really liked the concept I think it had a lot of potential. I liked the serial killer perspective but the execution of it was just bad. also what I'm assuming is a 9mm hollow point out of the Glocks they were using apparently make more sparks on concrete than a fire starter on steroids.",1514160000,2,976,4.397790055248619
