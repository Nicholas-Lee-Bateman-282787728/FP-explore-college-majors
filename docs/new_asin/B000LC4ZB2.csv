2703068,5,B000LC4ZB2,"-I think they did a good job with this one.  Sure its not the classics some of us grew up with but they're trying to attract new blood with their veiw on the world.  They managed to put some great stories down.  ""Puny Rock-man made fun of Hulks MaMa!""  My only problem was they fooled me into thinking this was a whole season.  If I had known more I would have waited for the box set.  I guess thats what i get for not having cable.",1175040000,6,432,3.9651162790697674
2703069,5,B000LC4ZB2,"OK, I saw a few months back that this was going to be released. I thought to myself, the character design looks cool, I can hope for the best in the story and overall look of the show. From the first 5 minutes. I knew I was gonna like this new version of Fantastic Four. It brought back memories of the CGI animated SPIDERMAN that was on MTV. I like this version much more then the 94-95 animated series.

I loved the look of that show and I REALLY like the look of this new show. I personally embrace new looks and forms of animation. The mix of 2d & 3d animations looks amazing. I'm not a fan of anime, but I like the anime character design with an american animated style.

I know the fantastic four purist don't like this NEW version. But I love it, I just wish it was a full season not and chopped up into a four episode DVD. with two more volumes to come. Sorry that it didn't find and audience, if I had know about it I sure would have watched it on cartoon network.

Two BIG THUMBS up for me!",1174953600,2,1000,4.040404040404041
2703070,2,B000LC4ZB2,"I was just watching the box-set of the last animated series, and it's important to note that it was the latter half.  Why?  Because the first half was unspeakably bad.  Bad enough that it's almost worth watching with company, just so you can feel the room react when Doctor Doom smiles bashfully at a touch from Sue's hand.

The second season of the old series was re-worked to fall in line with the FF books people were buying at the time -- characters were more layered, the costumes were updated, and it felt a lot less shoe-strung.  I'm hoping that's why Cartoon Network pulled it for now -- the process has so much promise, but if they're looking to dazzle anything but the anime fans who have no contextual knowledge of the FF, they're gonna need to step up the plots.",1173571200,4,774,4.460992907801418
2703071,4,B000LC4ZB2,"Let's get one thing straight, this is not a FF series for old-school Marvel fanboys; the kind who complain that an adaptation is cheesy if it is 100% faithful to the original material but go ballistic if they change anything from the comic.  I know you know what I'm talking about.  This series is a fresh reinvention of the superheroes we know and love and personally I enjoyed it. The animation is certainly above average for a cartoon; it's not exactly Pixar, but it's far superior to the more traditional 90's series with that horrible theme song.  The look is a uniquely modern mix of eastern and western styles that may be off-putting to those who just want an animated version of a forty year-old comic book (that's already been done...twice) but it works nonetheless.  But the series' best attribute by far is it's sharp sense of humor.  For example, in one episode Dr. Doom manages to switch bodies with Reed Richards while he is imprisoned.  Reed, in Doom's fully armored body, escapes and hails a cab.  As he sits down in the back of the taxi, the driver eyes him for a second before commenting, ""Hey, aren't you that Iron Man guy?"".  Reed/Doom simply looks at him and responds, ""Yes.  Yes I am."".  Great stuff, but if the notion of poking fun at classic comic characters is sacrilegious to you, skip this show.  As with all Marvel animated series, this one's got it's share of guest stars including Ant Man and the Hulk (note to self: don't make fun of his momma) so three cheers for that, too.  The series is episodic so there are no continuous arcs to follow, each show is a twenty minute story full of humorous situations, cool action scenes, and new interpretations of classic villains (the episode where the Skrulls disguise themselves as the FF's neighbors and ask them bizarre questions about their powers/weaknesses is another fun one).  Are all of these episodes I mentioned on this disc?  I don't know yet, but I'm gonna guess no, so I'll tell you to give this disc a rental.  If you like what you see, you can catch the series Saturday afternoons on Cartoon Network this summer and then you should wait for a full season set to come out before you buy.  That is, assuming Marvel will release this season in a boxed set as every other normal company would.  But with Marvel series', you never really know.

[edit: The entire first season of this show is available now and highly recommended so don't waste your money on these one-discers.]",1172793600,30,2461,4.618390804597701
2703072,2,B000LC4ZB2,"I wanted to like this show so much but it totally was a let-down.  The voices were all wrong for the characters and I really never warmed up to the anime style of the entire show.  Plus, Johnny Storm had a weird Rod Stewart mullet that was just off-putting.  I swear it was about as popular as a fart in church.  Terrible terrible terrible.  And yet, if I could get it used at a game store or something for under ten bucks, I might take a flier.  The lesson is, as always, that I am a moron.",1168387200,7,491,4.010309278350515
2703073,1,B000LC4ZB2,"This cartoon was just God Awful. I know it's franch animation but it looked like Anime/Manga and it's just bad. From the first episode alone Thing looked so out of place and not because of his apperance. It looked like they wree in Japan thanks to the animation yet Thing had NY sports stuff all over his room. Johnny Storm just looked ridiculous and sounded like a geek going through puberty (That sort of slurping sound). Now outside of the animation the cartoon seemed good, but unfortunately it's a cartoon and the animation was horrid.

I also fell asleep through each episode and finally stopped watching it.",1168128000,5,614,4.738317757009346
8161127,2,B000LC4ZB2,"I feel dissatisfied with this purchase, as in the description said that language was English and Spanish (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo) and only has the English language.",1425513600,,166,5.185185185185185

8161129,4,B000LC4ZB2,Very well done.  I just wish they would have put the entire season together.,1237939200,,76,4.428571428571429
8161130,2,B000LC4ZB2,"I had high hopes for this toon when it debuted on CN, but I was disappointed.  However, this particular DVD was worthwhile for one reason...the ""HARD KNOCKS"" episode featuring The Incredible Hulk.  This one episode is the only bright star in a series of badly written episodes.  Hard Knocks is a 5 star eppy...I don't what happened to the rest.  The Human Torch is very irritating, Reed Richards is an intellectual wishy washy nerd, Sue is ok, and Ben Grimm is a good character.  The animation is well done, the writing stinks with Hard Knocks being the only exception.

Buyer beware.",1203638400,,584,4.732673267326732
8161131,4,B000LC4ZB2,"The content on the DVD was great...It would have been nice to see a few special features and/or language/subtitles options included.  Kudos to the marketing and creative team that developed this DVD.  I was under the impression that more episodes would be included on the DVD (all episodes of season 1).  Volume 1 is a rather vague term, and you don't realize what you're getting until you tear open the packaging and look inside. If there was more information regarding the contents of this DVD, I would have waited until every episode was available in one package.  Clever, clever, marketing guys.",1183420800,,599,4.900990099009901
8161132,3,B000LC4ZB2,I was not a Fantastic Four fan until Marvel released the Ultimate Fantastic Four comics. I think they are more interesting when written for an older audience. These cartoons are fun but are for kids.,1182988800,,199,4.714285714285714
8161133,4,B000LC4ZB2,"I am a comic book fan and have been my entire life, and I really like alternate comic reality stories such as marvel's What if? or DC's Elsworlds and to me this is where this rendition falls into. It is cool to see another version of the characters, but they are not the F.F.I Know. The animation is good with a little animae feel to it, but the episodes were too short and the theme song wasn't catchy-cool to me. They should have tied the episodes together into a full length feature. Like I said, I didn't hate it",1181347200,,516,4.222222222222222
8161134,5,B000LC4ZB2,The animation is nice and the stories are written well. It's better than the old one!,1181001600,,85,4.375
8161135,4,B000LC4ZB2,"I have no idea why some reviewers here hate this cartoon so much. I have been an FF fan for about 20 years, and this is the bext FF cartoon ever made. It's funny, action-packed, and the animation is crisp and enjoyable. While the character of Human Torch is rather annoying and self-centered, the other three heroes are fun to watch. Invisible Woman is actually shown to be powerful, finally, just like in the comics! Just check out the episode where she pretty much single-handedly defeats Mole man and his monsters -- great stuff with imaginative uses of her powers! And Thing is reallly likeable in this cartoon, instead of just being a depressing, moping strong guy. Also, making Mr. Fantastic funny was a great idea. He's pretty goofy, but in a good way. And, for once, his powers seem cool.

The only thing I am not crazy about is how the series is being released one disk at a time rather than the whole season at once. Still, it's a great cartoon and is definitely worth owning. I am looking forward to the next two disks!!!",1176595200,11,1032,4.518716577540107
8161136,5,B000LC4ZB2,"Being an 'old school' Marvel comics fan, I was quite pleased with this new look, new style of the FF.  Everything was top notch and I will definitely buy the next volumes.",1175299200,2,171,4.34375
