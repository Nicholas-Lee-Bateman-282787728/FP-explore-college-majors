7210904,5,B00YCY46VO,"Rare is the movie that entertains children, makes them laugh and makes them think at the same time. Rare as well is the movie with such an amazing concept that is likewise delivered with amazing writing and production. ""Inside Out"" is that movie. The writing team of Pete Docter, Ronaldo Del Carmen, Meg LaFauve and Josh Cooley have taken a brilliant concept and put it together so masterfully, it'll have you thinking for days about the smallest of nuances in the movie, much less the big impact ones that are in your face.

The concept of the movie involves a little girl named Riley who's family is having to pack up and move to San Francisco from Minnesota, leaving all of her friends and memories behind. Inside her head and pretty much everybody else's heads as well are 5 entities: Joy, Anger, Fear, Sadness and Disgust. As Riley goes through this life changing ordeal, the entities wrestle with each other over the emotions of the day and the memories of the past.  I won't say anymore and like me, you'll be itching to talk to people who have actually seen the thing so that you can talk to them about it. So far, I've yet to meet that someone in person.

What I will say though, is that the movie, not unlike ""UP"" and ""Toy Story 2-3"", will challenge your composure in the presence of others. If you don't want your date, friend or child to see you crying, then you should avoid. Although, if you are one of these people, maybe you should see the movie and think about the message that it delivers.

After watching the movie you will want to watch it again and think about everything that goes on in the movie and how cool the writers have made this thing. It would be fun to talk to an actual psychologist and see how accurate everything seems to be. As sadness just willy-nilly runs her hands along all the little golden memory balls, turning happy memories into sad ones or those same memories lose their color and two little workers come along and suck them up into a memory dump vacuum. Brilliant. Just brilliant. This is just scratching the surface. I can't wait to watch this movie again. I can't wait to own this 3D bluray and cry in the privacy of my own home.",1434931200,21,2178,4.451127819548872
7210905,5,B00YCY46VO,"Inside Out is probably the biggest gamble that Pixar ever made trying to tell an animated story. It's more geared to adults than any other film they have ever made. It's complicated, with a lot of very complex metaphors. It attempts to tell a story far more related to the real world than any they have ever told as far as I can tell. There's no witches, magic, space-rangers, talking inanimate objects, or the like. And yet...

I knew from the trailers and reading a book about Pixar that this film was going to be different from the other ones that Pixar has released. I knew it was a gamble. But it also struck me as being more intelligent, more thoughtful, and perhaps more from the heart and soul than some of their other films (and that takes some doing). I was not wrong and I am glad I ventured out to a theater to see this film.

It's an ambitious undertaking to try to tell a story about the emotions in control of a person's mind, and even moreso when you dive into the other parts of their brain like the subconscious, dreams, and memories. On the surface this is a story of creatures trying to do their job who run into problems (two of the emotions get lost and have to find their way back), and the little girl who's life is undergoing changes that make her inability to express said emotions somewhat heart-breaking. But there is so much more going on here.

You can looks at this film and think that the people in it are being pushed around by the emotions in their head. You can see it as people being at the mercy of these emotions and other forces. Or...you can look deeper and see the introverted message of this film. That everything that happens inside of this young girl represents her reactions to events in her life. Have you ever felt that your dreams were really bizarre? Did you ever feel like you were out of touch with your emotions? Did your train of thought ever derail? In this film all of those events literally happen. And to me, there's a strong message about accepting yourself, and the different parts of yourself, and no telling them to just go away when times get tough. In my mind, as everything that happens to the girl in the real world is very much plausible for just about every kid growing up, the adventure inside of her head is actually happening in a similar way to every kid growing up (whoa!).

The entire journey is more consistently funny than any other Pixar film I've seen, as the dialog is extremely witty, the adventures more clever (a film studio that literally is ""Dream Productions"", maintenance workers sending commercial jingles up to a person's conscious mind because they think it's catchy, etc), but the true brilliance came in the mastery of the ordinary. All of us know what's it's like to be sad and embarrassed, or to lose part of ourselves, but those simple moments captured in this film had me tearing up like I was watching a Frank Capra film.

Very early in the film the child has a sad reaction that hit me very hard, but at the end of the film I felt an entire stream of tears falling off my face. It wasn't anything that everyone on Earth hasn't experienced in real life (family love when you are deeply sad) but the honesty of it got to me. My wife wasn't touched by any of that, but when a cherished memory is sacrificed to save the girl, she was crying too.

This isn't a sad movie, or a depressing one, but it a deeply touching one. It is also very much an adult, intelligent, introverted movie. Some kids may enjoy it, but others may not (the kid behind us in the theater said quite loudly that he was bored). As for me, I wanted to own this one. I'm not a Pixar fan in general, but I am a fan of this film. If you enjoy intelligent and heartfelt films go see it. You will probably deeply enjoy it, and might even feel yourself changed for the better.",1434844800,615,3833,4.368863955119215
7210906,5,B00YCY46VO,"Pixar has made so many great movies over the last decade, and as a fan, it is hard to really say which one is my favorite. From Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, A Bug's Life, and UP, the company responsible for the Toy Story phenomenon has yet again delivered audiences a highly unique movie in Inside Out.

Inside Out centers primarily on 11 year old Riley. Riley's emotions: Joy, Anger, Fear, Sadness, and Disgust, are shown to play a crucial part in how Riley responds, interacts, and feels in certain situations.  Joy, is shown to be her source of happiness, Fear to provide her safety, Anger to keep her life fair, Disgust to keep her from being stressed, and/or her likes/dislikes, and  Sadness a loner who doesn't feel she is actually needed for Riley to function. Soon Riley's family moves to San Francisco due to her father getting a new job, and Riley and her emotions are in for an unforgettable journey.

Inside Out achieves so much in such a relatively short time frame which is impressive in its own right. And Pixar is clever in that way, they can tell a story with unique characters in a short period of time. Many have argued that the plot for Inside Out maybe to difficult for younger kids to follow, but I personally do not believe that should stop parents from taking kids to see Inside Out. As I enjoyed the animation, I enjoyed how Inside Out's story began to unfold. When the movie was over, Inside Out left me with a deep reminder of how Pixar can make you care about their characters, and Inside Out itself left me in thought of just how exactly my own emotions all work. Joy, lovable and always beaming Joy,  does everything she can to keep Riley happy, Anger the little red pyro is responsible for Inside Out's humor-as is Disgust. And though Sadness is a loner, Inside Out shows how all these little emotions are necessary in a humorous and touching way. Don't be surprised if you start to have tears in a few scenes because I certainly did. Pixar actually has two releases this year-one being Inside Out, and later in November The Good Dinosaur. Personally, I'd say Inside Out is not only this year's best animated movie, its one of the best movies of 2015.

I encourage anyone young and old to GO SEE this new masterpiece that Pixar has on its hands. Inside Out is smart, its funny, its touching, and above all else, Inside Out is:

A GREAT EXPERIENCE

Rated PG",1434844800,60,2389,4.526682134570765
7210907,5,B00YCY46VO,"Wonderfully creative, thought-provoking and funny. Numerous poignant parts. The middle seemed to drag a bit, but I could have just been distracted from the story by all the people-noise in the theater.

This is a rare movie that is worth seeing more than once - probably many times for me in the future. I didn't want the movie to end, and I'm immediately hoping for a sequel that picks up where this one ends.

[Update]

I saw this movie a second time in the theater, just my wife and I this time. I enjoyed more than the first time - it didn't drag at all this time.

But my wife and I are thinking this movie is better for adults than for kids, if you are talking sheer entertainment value. We think maybe a lot of the psychology/brain science is lost on kids. My two daughters ages 12 and 9 enjoyed it the first time but didn't particularly care to see it again - this despite that we have moved in the last year, so the movie is very relevant to their lives. I think this might be a movie that parents buy and have their kids watch to try to teach them about their minds and emotions. Personally, I still love it.",1434758400,6,1118,4.234741784037559
7210908,5,B00YCY46VO,"I'll automatically give this 5 stars if it actually comes out in the US this time. Disney's past few 3D titles have only been issued in the US in 2D, with 3D editions available via import. This being from Pixar may have something to do with it, but hopefully Disney will start releasing 3D Blu-Rays in the US again. I'll pre-order it just to show my support.",1434758400,17,358,4.358208955223881
7210909,5,B00YCY46VO,"While I have continued to enjoy Pixars movies, its been a couple of years since they had one that really stood out and was something unique and special.  Im happy to say thats just what we get with Inside Out.  This is a film that youll be talking about and enjoying for a long time to come.

We spend most of this movie inside the brain of Riley (voiced by Kaitlyn Dias).  Our guide to her brain is Joy (Amy Poehler), Rileys lead emotion.  Joy makes sure that Riley is always feeling upbeat no matter what is happening in her life.  Okay, so there are some other emotions in Rileys brain, but Joy is the dominant one.

All that changes when Rileys family moves from Minnesota to San Francisco.  Suddenly, Riley is at a loss in this new town where she knows no one.  And, to complicate matters, Sadness (Phyllis Smith) is taking over memories without even trying.  When Joy and Sadness accidentally get stuck outside the master control center, they have to find their way back.  Meanwhile, Rileys other emotions try to fill in for Joy.  Will Joy make it home in time to keep Riley from doing something really bad?

As you might have guessed from that description, this movie isn't all laughs.  There are some pretty serious moments, too, so be prepared for that going into the film.  But actually, that fits into the theme of the film nicely.  Im not going to get into that any more so I don't spoil anything, but I really did like the point the film was ultimately making.

Parents will want to know that Riley does make some bad choices in the film.  But, they are all treated as such by the story.  Just know that going in, and be prepared to talk to your kids afterwards.  The film is rated PG, and its a very mild PG film, so there is nothing too bad in it.

Boy, this is sounding like a downer.  Lets fix that because this really is a funny movie.  There are lots of laughs at situations that Joy finds herself in or how Riley is reacting to what is going on inside her head.  No, we don't see too much of the other characters thoughts, although when we do, that is hysterical as well.  Speaking of which, watch the scenes as the credits begin for some more great laughs.

And the creativity that Pixar has always been known for is in full display here.  The places that Joy and Sadness go on their journey home are absolutely brilliant and so much fun.  No, Im not spoiling anything here either, but trust me, youll love it.

Everything builds to one of Pixars patented climaxes that will no quit.  Okay, so its not as full blown as Toy Story, for example, but there are plenty of complications along the way as everything begins to come together.  And yes, they do a wonderful job of setting things up early in the film.  This is storytelling at its best.  Writer/director Pete Docter and his team deserve full credit for that.  (Pete has always directed my two favorite Pixar films, Monsters, Inc., and Up.)

Complementing the story perfectly is the voice talent.  Im not super familiar with anyone in the cast, but they are all perfect at bringing their characters to life.  Heck, Sadness gets some wonderful laughs, and you know that comes from great acting.

The animation is wonderful as well.  Obviously, most of it is stylized, but the style always fits what is happening to the characters or where they are perfectly.  And the few glamour shots they have in the film are breath taking as always.

Opening with this film in the theater is the short Lava.  The animation here is stunning, and the story and song are great fun.  Youll love it.

Pixar truly has knocked it out of the park with Inside Out.  You will laugh, you might shed a tear or two, and youll appreciate your emotions that much more.  It truly is a winner all the way around.",1434672000,5,3757,4.418978102189781
7210910,5,B00YCY46VO,"The merging of beloved animation studio Pixar with Disney had the expected effect: more sequels, more spinoffs, less of that creative ingenuity that gave us Up, Wall-E, and the Toy Story movies. That's not to say Pixar forgot how to touch our hearts in the meantime; far from it, actually. When it comes to the joyous and fearful touchstones that mark the passage of childhood, themes visited in everything from Toy Story to Monsters, Inc., Pixar has proven themselves uniquely attuned. When Inside Out was announced with some great fanfare a few years ago, it seemed like the kind of wildly ambitious idea the studio hadn't attempted in quite a while. That was reason enough to be excited, but that it would center largely on the emotions of a single adolescent girl put it right in their emotional wheelhouse.

Everyone wanted Inside Out to be another Pixar classic, but it more than exceeds our lofty expectations. In the same way director Pete Docter's Toy Story took a goofy concept (living toys!) and made us look at our childhoods differently, Inside Out forces us to reexamine the way our emotions shape who we are. Equal parts sympathetic and nutty, the story takes us inside the amusement park mind of 11-year-old Riley (Kaitlyn Dias), a happy Minnesota girl who loves hockey, her close friends, and her parents. But when the father's job forces them to uproot and move to San Francisco, everything changes in ways she's not prepared for. While following Riley's not-so-smooth transition would probably be interesting enough in Docter's capable hands, we're instead taken into the control center of her brain where her emotions are personified by Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Fear (Bill Hader). Joy, who literally glows with fairy-like glee, has known Riley the longest and is sort of the de facto leader. With her in charge, all five emotions work like a well-oiled machine; controlling her moods as well as keeping track of Riley's memories, and it's in dealing with her memories that things start to spin out of control. Most of her emotions do as we would expect them to. Fear is naturally a big wuss; Disgust looks at everything skeptically; Anger is always hot-headed (literally), and Joy can be counted on to be optimistic about everything. But the ever-morose Sadness has no real place, and Joy certainly doesn't want her around tainting happy memories. It's in trying to keep Sadness away that things begin to go haywire, with Joy and Sadness trapped in the deeper recesses of Riley's mind.

Inside Out is perhaps Pixar's most complicated narrative, and Docter's screenplay (co-written with Ronnie del Carmen) isn't so smooth is setting up this vibrant but intricate world. Riley's memories are represented by glowing marbles, but her ""core memories"" are special and power key facets of her personality. These are represented by floating islands (such as Hockey, Family, and Goofball) that look like theme parks, and we haven't even begun to talk about her long-term memory, subconscious, and other parts of Riley's mental framework. When these core memories get lost, it's up to Joy and Sadness to wander her Long Term Memory, retrieve them and return to Headquarters, and while all of this is going on Riley is trying and failing to deal with multiple changes out in the real world. When Disgust tries to emulate Joy, the result is an uncharacteristically sarcastic Riley

Once Joy and Sadness' quest begins, there is scarcely a moment when Inside Out stops amazing you on just about every level.  Each new land is as imaginative as the last, and we see them venturing through Dreamland, which is naturally a giant movie studio; the two hop on the constantly-moving Train of Thought, and pass through Abstract Thought where they temporarily become 2D constructs. Meanwhile, there are tons of clever gags that will only become funnier the more one thinks about them. An annoying ""double mint gum"" jingle constantly emerges from the long term memory when least expected. Blame the brain's hardhat-wearing workers for why you can't remember phone numbers anymore, ""They're in her phone"", they say while erasing them completely from Riley's memory. Going deep into the subconscious, Joy and Sadness also encounter Riley's long-forgotten imaginary friend, Bing Bong (Richard Kind), who cries tears of candy and rides a magical rocket powered by song. If Bing Bong's story, one that has echoes of Toy Story coursing through it, doesn't melt your heart then nothing else will.

Pixar, and specifically Docter, know how to tug at our heartstrings and fill us with recollections of our own childhoods. Inside Out forces us to feel these things while taking us on a deliriously bizarre adventure inside Riley's mind, while on the outside the story is decidedly more serious, and presented in a way kids can understand. That's not to say Riley's situation is treated with kid gloves, though. Those who are Riley's age will understand her isolated feelings as the new girl in school, her hesitation about joining a new hockey team, and the anger she feels when an old friend appears to have moved on. With her emotions literally steering her every move, though, Riley does begin to come across for a while like a robot being controlled rather than a human making real decisions.

Fortunately, the film keeps getting better and better, and while it may literally be about our emotions never does it feel emotionally manipulative. Incredibly funny and remarkably moving, Inside Out is easily Pixar's best film since Toy Story 3. Not only can it make you laugh but it will tickle your brain.",1434672000,102,5660,5.003184713375796
7210911,4,B00YCY46VO,"Fun, quirky film that will entertain both kids and adults. See how the network of thoughts, feelings, and memories work inside Riley's 11-year old mind.  A very unusual story premise that sometimes seems like an instructional video for how the brain works, it's still a delightful film.  Watch carefully for the last 2 minutes of the movie as they are the most hilarious of the whole show.  Get a quick peek inside the mind of another kid that Riley bumps into, plus the mind of stylish classmate from school, a hungry dog, and a spastic cat.  The result is hilarious and the highlight of the entire film.  And, Phyllis Smith (from ""The Office"") as Sadness in the movie is a scene stealer and my favorite character.

7210947,5,B00YCY46VO,"""Inside Out"" is a wholly original and fantastic story with flawless animation, a strong plot, and surprising emotional resonance. Five stars simply isn't enough when rating this deeply affecting film. In my eyes, it was an instant classic after the first viewing. The scene where Bing Bong dies, Riley's imaginary friend, is especially poignant. Not because you're watching a silly pink elephant creature vanish. It's because you understand that it represents the end of innocence. The fading of one's imagination and childlike wonder. It's almost too much to watch.

As far as characters go, the five emotions are spot on and will teach kids quite a bit about psychology, sociology, and biology. What it means to be a perfectly balanced human being, both inside and out...pun intended!

7210976,4,B00YCY46VO,"Have you ever wanted to see what physically goes on inside a human mind ? yeah of course, who doesn't. Fasten your seat belts as we shall observe how 6 emotions interact in a human mind.
  As pixar animation studio continues to produce award winning movies, we get to take a ride with ""Inside Out"". Director Pete Docter, opens up another world within the human mind by showing us how a child functions on a week to week basis.
  The story is based around the mindset and thought process of an 11 year old girl named Riley (Kaitlyn Dias). Riley is going through a lot of things such as moving from Minnesota to San Francisco, getting used to a new school and trying to make friends. Throughout the movie, we observe typical teenage actions like, an argument with mom and dad that leads to her being on punishment, a bad day at school, and a hard time making friends.
  The audience gets to observe the climax in a first person state of mind all because of the emotions in Riley's mind. The rising action, which is quite easy to find is when Riley is really going through it, and she doesn't talk to her parents and mentally her mind is deteriorating and falling apart. This all leads up to Riley physically boarding a bus and planning to go back to Minnesota.
  As the movie progresses, the mood shifts from happy and joyful to sad and pitiful. The mood and tone is aided by the characters in the film and their facial expressions/body language. In the beginning of the movie, the use of colors is loud,colorful, and bright. It lets the audience know that everything is peaceful and Riley is happy. However, when the climax is reached and we start to see conflict, the colors are grey-ish and lifeless. It goes along with the mood of the film.
  The overall concept of the movie is very clear and visual to the audience. The filmmaker did a very amazing job by putting this movie together. Everything falls into place. The visual and animation team did a great job as well. Not one part of the film is going against or fighting with the animation and special effects. Very good movie.",1525910400,,2083,4.4867724867724865

The first time: the disc wouldn't play past one point, and I had to skip the chapter to continue. The 1/2 time, the disc stopped in multiple places and even when I skipped chapters, the disc continued to stop playing to the point where I finally had to just eject it and throw it away. What a waste of money. Must have been a library copy or something similar, or just a bad disc in general.

I saw Up a couple nights ago, laughed my head off and adored the whole thing from beginning to end. This ... was actually a little scary. No, I'm not kidding. It's an animated depiction of how emotions hijack your brain and are capable of destroying islands of security and happiness you've developed over years, within a few hours. Yes, naturally there's this great happy ending. It's a Disney movie after all. But it does make you wonder ... for instance ... how many kids leave home and never make it back? They never have that light bulb come on and they never turn around? Or they do turn around instead are met with hostility or lack of support? And if that happens to them repeatedly, then there are scars that never heal and consign them to a life of depression and poor management of their emotions. It's pretty creepy giving emotions personal animus and allowing them to act out what goes on inside all our heads. It wasn't the emotional lift I was looking for.

7211054,4,B00YCY46VO,"Not my favorite Pixar film, but it is revolutionary in its own way. It helps kids see emotions in a whole different light and that at times it is okay to not be happy and just feel what is going on around them. The actors cast for the emotions couldn't be more perfect with Amy Poehler as Joy, Lewis Black as Anger, Phylis Smith as Sadness, Mindy Kaling as Disgust, and Richard Kind as the imaginary friend Bing Bong. I have always respected Pixar's ability to help the audience appreciate the spectrum of human emotion, but this takes it on in a whole new light. I will never cease to love having disney and pixar at my finger tips at all times with amazon video.",1515369600,,664,4.32

7211056,5,B00YCY46VO,"I first watched this film in a bus with no preconceptions of the plot and initially didn't pay much attention. However, the increasing complexity of Joy's little control panel as the human body she controls ages made me lift my head and watch the film to the very end. The film veers away from the tired cartoony talking animal comedy and uses a rather original plot concept of a team of 5 emotions taking turns on controlling the feelings (and actions) of their human pet/master. Joy is hyperactive but overbearing, Disgust seems to be sort of there, Anger is funny, Fear sort of slips in and out of the screen and Sadness is the most complex character in the plot who inadvertedly moves the plot forward as their human's body reaches puberty.

Tossing Riley's favorite memories into a vaccumm cleaner that reaches the maze of her life's memory, Joy and Sadness are forced to team up and put things in order before Riley ends up as a sort of moping robot forever.

Disney surprises us all with a fascinating new world where childhood memories come to life and a strong cast of characters that put their differences aside to save Riley's sanity. The memory maze is highly creative and you feel the urgency in putting things back in order while there are still a lot of laughter during the entire film.

One thing that really surprised me was the care that Disney put towards making Riley's early attempts at practicing figure ice skating before she switched to hockey. Not only did they opt to make her perform left-handed figures, they recreated her Waltz Jump (a figure that is 1/3 rotation of an Axel Jump that every beginner learns fairly quickly) with utter realism. There is no nonsense of the stereotypical ice skating princess flicks where the character is instantly dazzling us with perfect Triple Axels and Quad Salchows. Riley performs the most basic figures of the sport like in real life. I cannot say about the realism of the hockey, but the animators surely did a great job.

A rather unusual film with an unexpected premise, I enjoyed watching it a lot.",1514937600,,2069,4.707182320441989

While we all agree that this is a great motion picture in its own right, what sets it apart from all of the other Disney & Pixar films surrounding it is the magnificent, moving soundtrack. Michael Giacchino has crafted not only a perfect ""Disney"" soundtrack, but a perfect audio journey that needs no picture to convey us through the entire arc of the film without the benefit of seeing it. Just a few words prefacing each track can and do give the listener enough information to complete the journey with his or her eyes closed. Not only are the timeless chords and progressions found in of all of the Disney films preceding it present, but the composer manages to bring a 21st century sound to these classic themes utilizing saxophones, the tuba, harmonicas, the Hammond organ, a rock and roll drum kit, and yes, even modern electronic keyboards in unique ways that harken back to the classic ""Disney"" sound of all of the features past.

7211140,5,B00YCY46VO,"We purchased this movie recently to add it to the cycle of movies for the toddlers.  We didn't do it for them so much as we did it for us.  Anyone with a toddler knows that you are very likely to watch the same movie 100 times in a row.  I used to like Despicable Me... now I don't, and I blame my kids.  That said, we thought this would be a good addition...

As a parent, I found this movie to be incredibly sad on my first viewing.  My kids loved it as there is plenty of bright, fast(ish) moving things on the screen to keep them occupied.  Be prepared, though, to wipe a tear away and also explain why running away is not an acceptable answer to unchecked sadness.  Our toddler has already mentioned running away (parroting the movie) when she was upset.  We understand that this is not a concept she truly understands and is just repeating something she has seen/heard, but this was not a topic I ever figured would need to be addressed with a child at her age.

Speaking from the perspective of a child forced to move to a new state, and told by her emotions from the safety of her noggin, it is very relatable for kids while having plenty of complexity to keep adults entertained. It's also adorable to see the emotions vie with each other, and get over the bias against emotions like sadness and anger to understand why being in touch with your emotions is so important. The animation is beautiful, and so many of the scenes were unique to the story. This is the personification of the indecision and turmoil that we often feel and can't express. Of course, emotions bared, it was a real tear-jerker as well.",1502928000,,680,4.491935483870968

I try to imagine what kind of insanity is running through her head and how scarred she is for life.

7211255,3,B00YCY46VO,"Seeing the trailer for Inside Out made me want to watch this movie. I didn't however read anything about the movie before delving in. It was therefore a surprise to me that 48 minutes into the cartoon I was feeling slightly depressed. The main character Riley is a little girl who goes through more emotional breakdowns than you expect in a ""Disney"" movie. I started to wonder where the happily ever after was. So I stopped watching this movie at 48 minutes and went to get something to eat.

When I felt better I decided to watch the rest later that night. The thing I noticed was that the two emotional characters sadness and joy basically ran the whole show. Sure there was anger, disgust and fear but they played a more minor role. The joy character is extremely positive but even she gets discouraged at some points. Sadness however seems to become a bit happier as things go along at the end and I really ended up liking her the most.

So I'm glad I didn't totally give up on this movie as it gets better. But you have to ask yourself if the happy ending is worth all the suffering. I suppose it is in some ways. The people I thought would enjoy this movie the best however are those with an interest in psychology. This cartoon seems more made for adults than children. I think there are some really scary parts and depressing parts that will affect children emotionally.

This movie teaches kids about emotions and how to handle them and it shows parents what kids are feeling and how they are trying to deal with changes. It's hard to remember what being a kid was like, but this movie helps show what's going on in that brain while being funny and cute, too.",1488067200,,428,4.168674698795181

7211291,5,B00YCY46VO,"Be warned...I worked in a daycare and played this and numerous children told me the nightmare sequence in this movie scared them, and they would cry and not want to watch this movie. BUT if your kids can get past that point, this is a thoughtful, informative, entertaining movie that both boys and girls will watch and like. More importantly it has a psychological narrative that adults can appreciate. It was a movie made in part by consulting with child psychologists so the detail put into this movie and delicacy it has to the child mind is great. It has a positive message, is not overly blasted with music, and doesn't have any scenes that are iffy on the appropriateness level for children movies. It is not out to make you just laugh, it has a message- growing up and change is hard, but this movie helps the protagonist, and hopefully your child, figure out how to deal with their emotions. Basically the modern day Mr. Rogers level of helpfulness. I watch this movie sometimes on my own with no kids around...highly recommended.",1487376000,,1038,4.6775956284153

Believe or not, I came to so many closures of what I have been missing mentally and emotionally as I grew up, and we will not let our kids go through the same things. This movie changed me.

7211357,5,B00YCY46VO,"On the surface, this is a cute animated movie.  Underneath are representations of how memory and emotion work in the brain.  This movie was an ""assignment"" to our daughter by her  psychologist/therapist.  (Our daughter was recently diagnosed with schizophrenia.)  She was supposed to watch it and take notes.  I watched it with her the first time, and wrote quite a few notes myself.  I then watched it again later, and took many more notes.  Very helpful to a family that is brand new to the experience of mental illness.  I think it would be just generally helpful to anyone trying to understand emotions in others that can be baffling, especially in children and young adults.

I laughed out loud so many times, my husband gave me some strange looks! This is a great teaching tool for children not adjusting well to ANY situation (in the case of Riley; the child in the movie, the family moved to a new city/state & everything that could wrong did). I can see where it can help kids deal w/any life changing situation (divorce of parents, trouble in school, social situations/issues, etc). It shows that a child(ren) can come to their parent(s) & talk about what's going on, & we ALL have these thoughts in our heads we don't understand some times as kids, we cannot express or are afraid to. Society has placed too much emphasis on an image of perfection, lack of emotions, disconnection from human contact via overuse of  social media, & just plain common sense when it comes to picking up on  when someone is having issues.

I have admit the one part of the movie my husband laughed out loud, was when a boy bumps into the main character & his brain flashes ""Girl, girl, girl""!",1482624000,5,1203,4.61214953271028

It's a combination of thrilling adventure, wondrous inventiveness, tearfully emotional moments, laugh-out-loud humor, and deeply profound subject matter that you'll be mulling over for a long, long time. I first saw it well over a year ago and I still get chills just from hearing the first few notes of the soundtrack. I'm continually searching for people who have not yet seen it so I can experience it anew vicariously through them. And what's more, my 2 yr old absolutely loves it. I can't recommend it enough.

7211595,3,B00YCY46VO,"I laughed; I cried -- no really, I did. I like the new approach that Disney is taking from their unicorn philosophy phase. At least they're trying to teach children more than just silly fantasies, like how you're hair is going to be gorgeous and you'll marry a handsome prince, but that things are going to get hard but that's OK. Turning emotions into literal characters was a smart move.
The overall lesson is that sadness is how one feels joy. Joy was being a bit of a jerk throughout, which compares to an unwillingness to feel grief, sadness, despair, and pain. This led to incredible destruction in the girl's life. Depression is considered to be a disease in our culture, and Disney was right to step gently over that, but that's what the girl was facing. She was depressed (and rightly so, moving to San Francisco, and I've been there, I wanted to run away too).
Through depression old things were destroyed but new things were created. Without depression (not clinical depression, which is in fact a disease that requires treatment), one may not learn, grow, or heal.
I thought however that while the idea was good, I could have done a better job. It's not like Disney's Enchanted, which I couldn't imagine anything better. That movie I entirely loved. It's just that so much more could be done. Put fear during the performance and watch that puck fly; put Disgust during training and watch the perfection; and where was Anger when the family's truck didn't arrive or when the father had to vanish? It's not so much she has a right to throw tantrums but that we learn more from our negative emotions than do our positive ones (which makes Joy into a real jerk). Anger is a powerful emotion, and what did Anger do throughout the movie? Just make the girl look stupid. Literally speaking, the emotions could have been so much more awesome. They could have demonstrated how emotions really move people.
I'll admit that Joy got on my nerves, although I think that was the purpose. She was such a jerk to Sadness (which is rebellion).
The sexism was a tad blatant. The father was seen as an idiot who doesn't get emotion, and the mother apparently was more intuitive (yet she couldn't even figure out her husband, so there). Also, why is the mother holding on to dreams of another man? So much for the fairer sex. I doubt the movie would have similar impact if the main character was a boy. Think about it, it wouldn't be a ""toughen up"" message (and we now know why the father was a goof -- that's all he's allowed to feel). However, that's just a pet peeve and I probably shouldn't dwell on it. The hockey aspect seems a little contrived and I was finding a small amount of friction believing that.
I also would like to point out that had the family moved to something other than a coastal city, we really wouldn't have had a plot. When I visited San Francisco, I realized just how much better my life has always been. Fortunately, my stay was only a few days, but it was enough. How much worse for an 11 year old girl!
Still, not bad for a Disney movie, I guess. I wouldn't watch it again.",1481846400,,3095,4.49911190053286

7211645,5,B00YCY46VO,"You need to watch this movie, especially if you are a parent. It made me rethink how I parent my children, and that I need to be careful with labeling them. It's too easy to put someone in a box, such as ""she's the smart one,"" ""he's the athletic one,"" etc. We're all individuals, made up of a vast array of good and bad, emotions and feelings. Our children deserve to be treated with that respect.

From a creative side, this is one of the most interesting movies I've seenfantastic use of animation on what is really a complicated subject (emotions, the human mind). Just so well done. Don't miss this one.",1481241600,,607,4.419642857142857

7211688,2,B00YCY46VO,"I really disliked this movie, and realize I'm in the minority.

I think the biggest problem is that the movie doesn't know if it wants to appeal to kids or adults.  Unlike other Disney movies that have something for everyone, I found the themes in this movie to be way too far over the heads of kids younger than twelve or thirteen.  ""Abstract thought""?  ""Deja Vu""?  ""Imaginary Subconscious""?  Are you kidding me?  Except for enjoying the fun colors, I don't think kids would have any idea what the movie is talking about.

I appreciate the effort and thought that went into this, and the attempt to make something a little more meaningful than the usual kids fare.  However, I thought it went way too far, and would be more suited to a high school psychology course.  Between the colors for the kids and the subject for adults, I found it schizophrenic.",1480636800,,854,4.596026490066225

7211691,5,B00YCY46VO,"This is a delightful addition to our family DVD collection.  PIXAR more often than not really comes through with animated movies that work for viewers of all ages.

This imaginative film looks at the interplay of different emotions in a child as she develops and navigates life's challenges.  The main players are joy, sadness, anger, disgust and fear.  It's fun not only to see how the little girls and her emotions change as she grows, but also how each emotion learns about her/himself and the others.  I also LOVED the glimpses into other characters' brains - the mother, father, and other kids.

As always the animation is absolutely top-notch, as is the cast and script.

A gem.

7211779,5,B00YCY46VO,"I am a middle school teacher with five kids of my own. I am delighted that the movie industry put time and energy into acknowledging that emotions play a huge role in our moment to moment activities in our daily lives. As an adult it leaves some holes, for example, we need to acknowledge and use our emotions as signals to address issues but they should not actually be in control and/or run our lives. As one of my kids says, ""So, I can be the mad, but I shouldn't do the mad."" He understands it is okay to be angry, but it is not okay to lash out verbally or physically. Use the emotion as a signal to figure out why you are angry and deal with it. This movie has served us so well both facilitating conversations and teachable moments as well as a great source of entertainment. I also use it as a theme for writing a compare and contrast essay in my classroom. All in all I give it a A+ rating!",1478390400,,899,4.113636363636363

7211840,5,B00YCY46VO,"Inside Out is a truly unique animated feature. It depicts the workings of the human mind, personifying five emotions and giving them the power to control a character's behavior. The way that a personality builds and evolves over time is cleverly explained through ""core Memories"" and islands of personal focus, like ""Family Island"" or ""Hockey Island."" This film is actually ominous and even frightening as a series of experiences lead the main character's emotions to lose control of her behavior. It has a beautiful climax that brings tears to my eyes every time I see it, which is exactly the point of the climax..and that's is all I can say about it without giving away too many spoilers.",1477612800,,691,4.864406779661017

7211851,5,B00YCY46VO,"For a ""cartoon"", Inside Out is a fairly perceptive interpretation of how mood, intellect, and personality interact in the human psyche. Ostensibly offered as eye candy for younger viewers, adults will find some familiar psychological themes artfully woven into the plot. The animation will appeal to kids and adults alike, but the message behind the sight gags and colorful action is fairly sophisticated. The very creative factory-like workings of the conscious mind, which is depicted as a control room (""Headquarters"") managed by conflicting emotions, personified as Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness, are an interesting caricature of how the mind processes memories and life's experiences. Quality fare like this is why Pixar's products standout in the world of CG animation.",1477353600,,783,5.533333333333333
7211852,5,B00YCY46VO,"One of the best movies I've ever seen. As a therapist, I can truly say that this film has been super helpful with children and learning about their emotions.

7211927,1,B00YCY46VO,"""Inside Out"" is undoubtedly the greatest crime against humanity ever perpetrated.  And that's saying something, considering it comes from the waste cases at Pixar Animation Studios, who have spent the last 20 years subjecting audiences and critics to such atrocities of computer animation as ""Finding Nemo,"" ""A Bug's Life,"" ""The Incredibles (more like "" The Not-So-Incredibles),"" and the dreaded ""Toy Story"" saga.  I only watched this as a rental from my local library, so at least I can't say it ripped me off (save perhaps for the 2+-hours it irretrievably sucked out of my life), but that's about it.  The story, dialogue, characters, voice acting, music, and of course the animation were all sub-par.  Although it was only feature-length, many scenes fell so painfully flat that they just kept dragging them out for what felt like hours.  All the idiots who claim this is appropriate for kids are either lying or on drugs.  There was so much inappropriate content that I couldn't possibly do it justice here.  Save yourself the time and money and go buy ""Norm of the North"" or ""Delgo,"" anything but this garbage.  As with all Pixar's works, it's probably best to pretend this one just doesn't exist at all.

7211996,5,B00YCY46VO,"Ever wonder what goes on in your head?  This isn't a new concept by any means but this movie is clever with it

Riley is a 11-year old that moved to San Francisco with her family.....and yes it's a complete family with a mother and a father.  Who would've thought? A Disney movie that features a full family because name me ten Disney movies that has a mother AND a father.

Riley's head contains five characters that embody emotions: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger and Disgust.  Joy looks like Marge Simpson with a short haircut.

Sadness keeps playing with Riley's memories which makes any memory she touches sad....this prompts the adventure that Joy and Sadness go on trying to return to headquarters.  This means Riley can't be happy or sad because Joy and Sadness aren't in headquarters anymore.  Which also makes sense because the family just moved to San Francisco from Minnesota.....which is the one gripe I have with this movie: stealing the moving story from Toy Story.....and many other movies

This movie is genuinely funny and clever....but why the PG rating? There's nothing in this movie that warrants such a rating.  Or is the G rated movie suddenly taboo these days?",1475107200,,1179,4.82089552238806

Overall, nice story, dragged a little in a couple of spots. I wonder if a child would wander out of the room during those times.
I love Pixar, I have almost all of their movies. They rarely disappoint but I don't think this was a five star offering because of ... let's call them burp moments. Bits that could have been cut.
The Lava short was nice but I couldn't see it appealing to children. Even though I'm a almost 60 person, I love these features. This was a little heavier themed than most of the stories they have done.",1474243200,2,594,4.219298245614035

7212074,5,B00YCY46VO,"Wow! What an amazing movie. The way Disney/Pixar represented how the brain works was simply genius. It was funny, happy, sad, and entertaining all at the same time. The characters are so lovable! Joy and Sadness are the main focus, and Disgust, Anger, and Fear take on a lesser role. Bing Bong, who represented imagination, also played an important role. My only complaint is that the mood was too sad at times, and I wish a bit more of the movie was focused on happiness. Still, this is one of Disney/Pixar's best films in my opinion. My 5-year-old daughter can watch this movie over and over again!",1474156800,,600,4.616822429906542

7212094,5,B00YCY46VO,My daughter loves this movie she has honestly asked for this movie about 30-40 times. The characters are so relatable to life and how we all live and it is a great way to teach your children about emotions that we all go through without having a too depressing sort of talk.

Yeah, I remember seeing cartoons about kids (no actually they were cartoon animals) running away when I was a kid but did you have to show kids HOW to do it too?
I never would have thought of doing that when I was a kid.  But when a kid sees a character that they love do something, they want to do it too.
It is a bad example.  Now I won't be purchasing this.

7212312,3,B00YCY46VO,"I guess I'm in the minority here, but I would have to say this animated film is only for kids.

I'm a senior, and I found this film dull, utesy-cutesy, and completely devoid of humor, as hard as it tried to make me laugh.

And no, I'm not a grumpy senior who hates animation.  I have quite a number of Disney, Pixar, and Shrek films in my collection, and in recent years, I liked ""Frozen"" and loved the Peanuts movie and ""Zootopia.""

But ""Inside Out"" didn't get to me at all.  The lead character Joy even annoyed me like some strident Reese Witherspoon booster character.

In addition, because of the fanciful nature of the film's construct -- the cartoon workings of the brain -- problems and solutions arise willy-nilly to serve the sentimental story.

This DVD also has a short film, ""Lava,"" which I guess played before the feature in theaters.  It too makes little sense but tugs at the heartstrings owing primarily to a lovely song that plays throughout.

So I would have to say that both ""Inside Out"" and ""Lava"" suffer from the same problem -- emotions alone don't make a successful film.  Sense and sensibility are required as well.

My advice?  Rent this title first.  If you like it, buy it.  Otherwise wait for another Pixar or Disney classic like ""Toy Story"" or ""Zootopia.""",1471046400,,1284,4.599118942731278

7212386,5,B00YCY46VO,"A Disney/Pixar flick that feels like the best of both worlds: loads of future Disney ride potential with great Pixar inner metaphoric meaning and laughs to splash around in.  It's hard not to love a film that makes you find the good in what can feel so bad. (Plus, Amy Pohler is in it and it's a little bit like an animated version of PARKS AND REC set inside a child's mind that's grappling with growing up and all the confusion that goes with it.)",1470355200,,449,4.2823529411764705

7212394,5,B00YCY46VO,"This is one of the best Pixar movies I've seen in quite some time. It's not often that a movie can accurately portray the incredibly complex process of both moving away and growing up, while also making it simple enough for children to understand and enjoy, but Inside Out did a phenomenal job. The story is excellent, the characters well written, and both kids and adults can take something away from it. If you haven't seen it yet, I absolutely, 100% recommend it.",1470182400,,466,4.626506024096385

The accuracy of how different events in life change and mold us to be the people that we are called to be.  I think anyone watching it should go back and reflect how different events in their life have affected who they are.  The cast who played the emotions in Riley's head are amazing and definitely add some extra humor.  Definitely would suggest watching.,1469059200,,488,4.574712643678161

It's a love story between a parent and their child, an homage to the innocence of childhood, and a helping hand to the difficult process of growing up. I have cried every time I have watched this movie and laughed without abandon at its moments of true joy. Basically: there aren't enough stars for this flick.",1468540800,,597,4.339285714285714

It was cute, the story line was easy to follow, some parts were funny, and it does make you wonder if people are really thinking the way they portray in the movie; but it was still not the best Disney movie. I love some Disney movies, and I will ALWAYS buy them when I do, like Finding Nemo; but this won't be part of my Disney collection. It's a watch one time, and be done.

7212644,3,B00YCY46VO,"3.5 Stars. [Spoiler Alert!] Pixar once again brings their stunning and immaculate animation to the screen, but this time with emotions. The movie ultimately falls short with a droll and sad tail that doesnt seem intended for the target audience, children. Pixar has previously dealt with mature subjects, like in the Toy Story series (1995, 1999, 2010). It was most prevalent in Up (2009), where the opening showed a couple growing old until the woman dies and leaves the man alone. Nominated for the Academy Award for Best Writing, Inside Outs script is very original. A young girl, Riley, is at the edge of puberty. She is uprooted from her Midwestern home and moved to San Francisco, where she must adjust to the new life. Her parents (Kyle MacLachlan and Diane Lane) try to help, but its her emotions that run the show. Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), and Disgust (Mindy Kaling) are her inner workings and shuffle memories around, including her core memories. When Joy, the leader of the bunch, and Sadness get lost in the library of memories, Riley goes into a funk. Joy and Sadness make an epic journey to get back to the command center, while the rest of the emotions try to handle Riley. With such an all-star cast of comedians, there was little humor. Most that was overplayed like the gum commercial or Angers rage, which was typical Lewis Black. What the story really lacked was a compelling overall arc. Theres nothing exciting about watching a girl adjust to a new life. Anger, Fear, and Disgust eventually have her attempt to runaway to the Midwest, but the overall arc should maybe have started there. The core story was of Joy and Sadness coming to terms with how they work together and getting back to the command center. On their travels they meet a variety of unrememberable characters and go through various parts of the brain. In comparison, WALL-E (2008) had the core story of the romance between EVE and WALL-E, but the overall story arc was to save the human population. The Incredibles (2004) core story was about family, while the overall story was about saving the world from an evil villain. Even Up had a more adventurous story, but the core story of a man coping with life had a lot of heart. While it did have its moments, where the ending was the most fun, the movie fails to amusing the way other Pixar movies have in the past. Its worth checking out for fans, but its nothing to jump through hoops for.",1468454400,,2488,4.6826484018264845

7212702,5,B00YCY46VO,"This combo pack of DVD Blu-Ray and digital was a nice set. I have watched each, and they are of good quality and I had no issues with compatibility or anything else.

The movie is a litlte bit unusual, and I have noticed that the more recent Discney movies have beena little intense for my 4 year-old. This particular film deals with the emerging identity of a young (pre-teen?) girl that has moved to a new city and new school. The story is told predomionantly through the eyes of the various personified parts of her identity. It was a little hard to explain the pain of losing friends and the kind of sadness conveyed in the film to my little girl, but despite her lack of understanding the whole of what was going on (she tends to focus on the ""sad"" expressed in the movie without appreciating it as a necessary precondition for the happiness and resolution of the plot later), she does enjoy this movie.

I am sure that there will be comments about how this film promotes some sort of ""liberal, politically correct agenda."" I don't think that is true at all. I think this movie tries to identify with some of the painful emotions everyone feels as they try to figure out their place in the world. I think that this movie does a pretty good job of expressing the helplessness, loneliness and difficulty that kids can feel when they are subjected to lerge changes (like moving to a new city) and I was happy to see taht the movie is resolved largely througha reinforcement of the bonds of her family and her gaining of a litlte bit of perspective that helps her adjust to her new situation and to understand the world around her al ittle better.

Really, this movie has parts that are a bit of a bummer, but I think it introduces some important concepts for kids in a fun and interesting way. I might even say it does so in an artistic fashion that is imaginative and beautiful.",1467676800,4,1881,4.446376811594203

While I thought this movie was brilliant, my kids just thought it was okay.  It entertained them for the first viewing, but neither my daughter or son demonstrate any interest in seeing it again.  Very unlike our Pixar experiences with Cars, Finding Nemo, or the Incredibles.

As odd as it sounds, I think this Pixar movie appeals more to parents than the kids.",1466553600,,606,4.513761467889908

7212901,2,B00YCY46VO,"I love disney and have been waiting to see this. With all the hype around it I must say it was horrible. This was not animated with a child in mind. A ten year old would be able to start grasping it but your average 5-9 year old wouldn't get this at all. This movie was clearly intended for the Pixar crowd of college age, young adults that wanted to watch cartoons- which is fine because who doesn't love a cartoon? However, the entire movie could have been put into a ten minute short. It's important to be sad sometimes. There, thats the entire movie.

Cons for children: Boring, long winded, the emotions control the girl and not the other way around.

In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!

7212925,5,B00YCY46VO,"Another enjoyable Pixar movie with an interesting conceit, that various emotions work as a committee to keep you moving.  Without giving any plot points away, Riley, a young girl, is caught up in a move that leaves all her friends and old life behind.  The course of the movie is how she copes with the move, a rocky road for most of the movie.  Her committee, headed by Joy (including Sadness, Disgust, Anger, and Fear), tries to help her navigate the tough times with all the problems and advantages that a committee suggests, of course.  Riley's ""imaginary friend"" shows up in the movie and plays a pivotal role.  Lots of little jokes about how the brain works (why that tune stays stuck in your head, how dreams work, how you manage to forget things like those piano lessons you didn't want to take, etc.).  The obligatory moral is that working together is the best (it's a committee, did you expect a different moral?)  The best part IMO is the ending where you get to see into other minds, not just people but a dog and a cat, too.  Best explanation of a cat's behavior that I've ever seen.  That said, there are some retro elements in the movie that try to take us back to the 50s - the family moves due to the father's work (apparently), and the mother tells the protagonist that it's their job to look happy to help Dad out.  Overall, though, an enjoyable movie worth watching again to catch up all the side jokes that you missed the first time.",1465948800,,1454,4.452830188679245

7212960,5,B00YCY46VO,"We have yet to be disappointed in a Pixar movie and this is another amazing addition to any movie library. While many people judge digital animation based on the quality of CGI integration in live action movies, Pixar continually reminds us of the awe-inspiring possibilities of exploring some of the most complex issues of our lives through vivid animated story telling. The characterization of emotional dynamics and their neurological landscape, as realized by the writers and animators of Inside Out, will forever provide one of the best representations of the nuance and drama of growing up. The way personified internal conflict between Joy and Sadness and their external stimulus is wonderfully well-done and gives the audience a lovable metaphor for the balance we must achieve as we struggle through difficult changes. The humor is spot-on and well-delivered and the transition between internal and external plot details are seamless, it would take effort to miss how Riley's adventures directly affect and are affected by the emotions within her struggling to keep up.",1465776000,,1078,5.309941520467836

7212971,5,B00YCY46VO,"Inside Out was another one of those movies that is aimed at kids and their parents. The kids obviously like the little cutesy characters, while adults find themselves perhaps identifying with the emotional things that they confront in day to day life. I prefer to take another tact though as I was most affected by the loss of Rileys imaginary friend because I am by nature sentimental and highly resistant to change and that I think is part of the lesson of this film that life is change and we have to adapt to move forward.

Of course, it is entirely possible that I take my little kids movies entirely too seriously. But I like the way that people can look at the same movie and see entirely different things and I also give the animators and studio credit for capturing just how emotions can feel sometimesI mean who hasn't found themselves boiling over in anger or overcome with sadness, so much that it feels like theres a little person inside of us pulling the switch.",1465689600,,976,4.545454545454546

7212990,5,B00YCY46VO,"What a great movie for kids of all ages. This movie shows that we need all our emotions; not just joy and happy things to have a well rounded life. There are times when we need to be angry, or afraid, or sad, etc. My grandsons (8 and 11) learned that it's okay to be afraid, or cry or be angry, that they didn't only have to be happy all the time. This movie follows the life of a little girl through all the emotions in her head and how the one emotion, Joy, felt that she needed to be happy all the time. Joy comes to realize that we need all our emotions; not just joy. Highly recommend this movie.",1465516800,,601,3.975206611570248

7213022,3,B00YCY46VO,This is an interesting movie not sure I would have ever wanted to explain to my kids if they had seen it why they have little people lost and living in their heads. This is an unusual movie. As a mom I would not have shown it to my kids until they were older. Nor would I let my grandchild watch this movie just for the reason that we don't have people lost in our heads nor are emotions little people. The characters are great and the story line needed more work less little people. The fact that Joy did figure out that all emotions are valid and have their uses was the one saving grace of the movie. I will not buy.,1465257600,,619,4.040650406504065

7213059,4,B00YCY46VO,"I really liked the concept of this movie because it was fresh and original but I was a bit disappointed with the outcome. Like many Pixar movies, it looked amazing and the attention to detail was great but the storyline dried up after a while and I personally thought that it was a bit confusing for little kids. It's about a young girl called Riley, voiced by Kaitlyn Dias, who moves to San Francisco from Minnesota with her parents and finds it hard to fit in. Whilst going through her transitions, we get to look at her Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness emotions which are going through turmoil after her Joy and Sadness emotions lose some of her core memories. After retrieving the memories, they struggle to get back to there headquarters which means that Riley is stuck with her Fear, Anger and Disgust emotions.

When Joy and Sadness manage to get back to there headquarters, Riley is able to lead a normal life in her new house but as she gets older, the headquarters becomes bigger because of her many new emotions, including puberty. Its a clever storyline with some funny moments but I would have liked to see the other emotions a bit more, especially Anger, who made me laugh. The bonus material on the DVD should have been used in the film because it was brilliant. It showed the different emotions of her dad and mother while Riley was going out with a boy, so if you get your hands on the DVD/Blu- ray, you really have to give it a watch. Anyway, there isn't much adult material, like in other Pixar movies but it's fun for the whole family. I did miss the catchy songs and the usual mean villain but there is enough material to keep it interesting. My expectations are always high when it comes to Pixar animation movies so I did feel a bit let down with the outcome. It's not the type of film that I can watch time and time again like Toy Story or the Incredibles but if you want to keep the kids quiet, it's worth a purchase. Average!",1465171200,3,1956,4.418282548476454

7213073,5,B00YCY46VO,"Such a deep, moving film! Mucho worthy of the esteemed Pixar film canon! I felt I learned something as an adult watching this and wish it had been made when I was a kid (or teen). I can tell this movie was made in a similar vein to ""Drop Dead Fred"" which I also loved, encouraging free expression of children's emotion and feelings (inconvenient or not to their parent's lifestyle) instead of just popping them on Ritalin or ""Dyziplen"" as explored/parodied in The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. Definitely recommend if you love deep, meaningful films and since it's Pixar naturally chalk full of humor worthy of both adults and younger, shorter adults! :)",1465084800,,651,4.821428571428571

In a girls mind they tend to remember everything and it is all connected.  In a mans mind everything is distinct and intermixing of subjects is bad.  Plus men like the nothing box, no girls are invited to the nothing box.  This was very entertaining and a fun visual but it should be noted with much more definition that mens minds and womens minds are very very different.

7213092,2,B00YCY46VO,"It truly pains me to say this but I gave up on a Pixar film about 20 minutes in. Although I thought it was a creative idea it just did zip for me. I wasn't enamoured of the little girl's life . . . and I bleed hockey as a Canadian! I also liked the whole Brandon Walsh from Minnesota to California idea redone in a child's form.

Given Pixar's excellent track record and I dug Wall-E which was a big leap of faith for storyline as far as Pixcar goes, I don't know why this failed to register with me. Maybe it's just I found each of these ""emotions"" a bit too formulaic. Joy herself I just found beyond annoying. It was like being stuck in a room during a nuclear holocaust with the one person who would say, ""Well, at least we have a fresh slate to start our new and exciting lives with from today.""

Anyway, I leave it to others to check the extras out on the DVD. I'm sorry I gave up but I just couldn't take this latest from Pixar and went back to watching Season 2 of ""Silicon Valley.""",1464912000,,990,4.045918367346939

7213108,5,B00YCY46VO,"In the movie Inside Out., a young girl's brain is occupied by emotions portrayed by cartoon characters: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger. These emotions run the Control Panel in the Headquarters of the girl's brain. Of course, there are conflicts among the cartoon emotions that we expect to be resolved by the end of the movie. After all, it is a Disney film.

The movie does bring up the question of free will.  Are we our own actors or are we responding to beings that live in our heads pushing buttons?  This is a question which is difficult to answer.

I really enjoyed the view of the Headquarters and Control Panel inside a cat, which we see only briefly at the end of the film.  I think that it is as good a representation as any other for what goes on inside a cat's head.",1464825600,4,787,4.363013698630137
