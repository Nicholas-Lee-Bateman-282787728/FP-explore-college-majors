5346244,4,B009L63QHI,"It may look as just another TV movie, but the fact is that there is some Nietzsche philosophy hidden on it. The book was good. The books are always better. But the choice to keep the ethical issues of the kids instead of the monster side of the story was not such a bad one.",1361232000,2,274,4.0
5346245,3,B009L63QHI,This movie is alright and it's enjoyed to watch it but the book is better. So if you like movies that's not all that scary than this a movie for you and you're family. Lois Banks,1360713600,,178,3.9722222222222223
5346246,1,B009L63QHI,"As a stand alone movie, not comparing it to the book, it might have been okay if it weren't for the poor dialogue and horrible acting but when you throw the book into the equation it was just awful. (SPOILERS) Not only did they cut out some key elements of the book but completely cut out the title character. Aside for some quick flashbacks there is no ghoul in the movie. The missing girls and the murders are not done by a mythological character but some dude that went crazy. That was not the case in the book, in the book it was a ghoul like the title sugests. I don't know why they even used Brian Keene's name in the title this was not Brian Keene's Ghoul, this was absolute crap. Not worth my $3.99 to rent it and not worth the hour and a half I spent watching it. If you want a good movie from the same director I suggest watching The Girl Next Door - that movie was disturbing and at some points hard to watch due to the subject matter but that movie was done well, unlike some movies like this one. I do hope that one day Brian Keene gets a movie done based on his work that is actually good because his novels are spectacular. Maybe if he had written the script it would have been better but then we still would have had to put up with the horrible acting.",1360627200,5,1268,4.116935483870968
5346247,2,B009L63QHI,"A small town's secrets have been kept buried beneath Golgotha Cemetery, but three young boys mistakingly unleash it when digging a nearby fort in the coming-of-age Horror film, GHOUL. Adapted from the novel by Brian Keene, GHOUL focuses far more heavily on the inner struggles of its three male protagonists than the subterranean terror lurking beneath the cemetery. In many ways, the ghoul is more of a physical manifestation of the horrors experienced at home than anything else, and in defeating it, the boys learn to free themselves from their inner demons as they progress in to manhood. Unfortunately, the stronger story elements are overshadowed by a lackluster production. Let alone the continuing struggle with pacing, GHOUL is incredibly uneven, pairing the light mood of a childhood drama with the gory trappings of an adult monster movie. GHOUL becomes less accessible to younger audiences due to its darker themes as well, with child abuse and molestation being the true ""monsters"" of the picture. There is no discernible hero to be found either, and none of the performances stand out enough to elicit an emotional attachment to the characters. Try as it may, GHOUL is unable to dig up any interest in audiences young or old.

5346248,2,B009L63QHI,"As I read the synopsis for ""Ghoul,"" my expectations for a great film that would make me feel nostalgic about my childhood love for monster and action movies began to build up. High expectations aren't always a good thing when going into a film. Unfortunately, that was the case here. I wanted to like it, but something got lost along the way.

Timmy, Doug, and Barry are the best of friends. As if life for three 12-year old boys at the edge of puberty isn't hard enough, things get very tough when they are forced by circumstances to confront the urban legend of a creature which lives underneath their local cemetery. Are there supernatural forces at work or are the disappearances of several local teenagers tied to someone in the town with unknown motives?

I have to hand it to director Gregory M. Wilson and writer William M. Miller. This was made as a low-budget TV-movie for Chiller TV. As far as that goes, it looks great. The creature makeup is genuinely creepy and the sets look good.

They never quite convinced me that I was watching something happening in 1984. The lack of a soundtrack effectively reflecting the era and misplaced pop-culture references were definite hindrances in the process. It didn't help when characters exclaimed, ""Eat my shorts"" and ""Don't have a cow!"" These two catchphrases were coined by Bart Simpson in ""The Simpsons,"" which didn't even gain real popularity until late 1989.

""Ghoul"" boasts at least two veteran actors which are familiar to children of the 1980s. Barry Corbin portrays Timmy's grandfather. He was a supporting actor in several movies and TV shows from the decade like ""WarGames,"" ""Dallas,"" and ""Critters 2."" I'm sure tons of boys who were teenagers at the time will identify with my crush on Catherine Mary Stewart. I was captivated by her in such films as ""The Last Starfighter,"" ""Weekend at Bernie's,"" and ""Night of the Comet."" She plays Timmy's mother and adds a bit more legitimacy to the movie.

One thing that gave me a sense of appreciation for ""Ghoul"" was the Behind-the-Scenes featurette. It did a great job of highlighting the hard work and conviction poured into the movie. It's hard to completely hate on something that someone put so much effort into. I have a deep respect for the set builders and makeup artists.

""Ghoul"" tries very hard to capture the magic of films like ""Super 8,"" ""The Goonies,"" and ""The Monster Squad."" It's a shame it didn't accomplish what it set out to do successfully. Viewers who aren't looking for a walk down memory lane may enjoy this, but filmmakers missed their target market in my opinion.",1359072000,3,2596,4.783482142857143
5346249,1,B009L63QHI,"I've been looking forward to this movie for a good while now. The book was a favorite of mine, I felt it perfectly combined horror and elements from the movies The Sandlot and Monster Squad. Unfortunately, the movie simply begins to ignore its source material and even ignores its own scenes. The acting is a bit rough around the edges but I can live with that.

This movie simply lost the magic from the book. Even without comparing it to the book there's so many things wrong with the movie it's just a huge let down. As I said before, the main monster, the main plot point, the TITLE CHARACTER is nowhere to be found. It's hinted upon and even shown briefly but in the end, it simply does not exist the and the writer/director must have forgotten all about it. That right there is the ultimate slap in the face for someone watching the movie.

It's like being promised a cookie to sit through some boring meeting. You see the cookie plate sitting there but once the meeting concludes the cookies are gone, only to be replaced with rice cakes.",1358985600,23,1045,4.465968586387435
5346250,2,B009L63QHI,"I won't say it sucked but, IT SUCKED! The DVD cover is scarier! These boys had issues that were a bit too deep to have me focus on a creepy creature terrorizing the town. In the first place the acting could have been better. Second, the plot about the ghoul was disjointed. Last, the attempt to wind a young male bonding theme around a horror theme was done only once with Stand By Me (King). This should have been either about how these boys helped each other get thru their personal nightmares OR about some kids out to catch a real ghoul. The ending was a let down and predictable but kinda like the end of a Scooby Doo mystery (""if it weren't for those meddling kids!""). Plus I was hoping a better message would have been sent about how the abuse issues could be handled. If I were a kid in similar situation I'd be left not knowing what I might be empowered to do. This has its place on the Sci Fi Channel.",1358726400,3,911,4.211428571428572
5346251,5,B009L63QHI,"This film has it all.... Drama, comedy, suspense, action. Loved it, I'm glad I purchased on DVD.  This film also touched on few subjects that aren't that surprised me, yet I think need to be addressed.",1358380800,,201,4.583333333333333
5346252,1,B009L63QHI,Brian Keene Finaly gets movie made based on one of his better books I cant believe he let them put his name on this piece of garbage,1358294400,10,132,3.925925925925926
5346253,1,B009L63QHI,"I can't believe I spent money renting this. People often say they want their money back, I actually really do want my money back.

Okay, first we have a cast filled with completely unlikable people. I wanted pretty much ALL of them to die. The only people I wanted to live were the ones that died. So that was annoying. The acting was NOT good. Not even almost good.

They put pounds of dirt and make up on people who were just shoveling and doing minor tasks. Pretty much all the parents were abusive in disturbing ways and this is supposed to be a made for TV movie. The abuse was also stupid because they tried to make it WAY overly dramatic and when you couple that with horrible acting it just does not work. The abuse story lines don't even really have a resolution to it. And for some reason when 3 girls are trapped by the ghoul they just have to mention that he ""Did things"". All 3 of those girls were trapped together under ground and never bothered to try slipping through the giant holes they could have used to get out. And they never bothered kicking out the two thin boards nailed into the dirt keeping them there. They had to wait for a tiny kid to come by and pry the boards lose. The fake decor of the underground was worse than what you'd see in a soap opera.

Things wrong with this movie:
1. The plot
2. The script
3. The cast
4. The acting
5. The directing
6. Being overly dramatic
7. Having situation that don't even play out. Why put them there?
8. Wimpy females
9. Bad costumes and make up
10. Bad sets
11. Killing off the wrong people
12. The ending

Things good with this movie:
1. It eventually ends.

I like campy and cheesy movies. This is not that type. This is just really bad. It's like somebody in college put it together or something. Don't waste your money!",1358035200,18,1793,4.261764705882353
8542753,4,B009L63QHI,"Ghoul is one of those horror movies that's passable enough to get the job done, but it could've been more frightening.  The problem is that we're teased to see the ghoul for such a long time but instead all we hear are unusual growls while the kids are walking around, teens getting slaughtered with no build-up whatsoever (gotta love the rapid slapping tree branches in the car scene with the two teenagers making out, what?) and the camera moving underground imitating the ghoul's point of view.  I'd rather we actually see the ghoul instead of the underground area from the ghoul's point of view.  These elements make Ghoul more like a horror films for kids.  Just scary enough to give it a pass, but nothing that'll blow adults away.

However one thing I love are the three boys. While one of the friends comes from a normal family (Nolan Gould's character, despite having a strict father) we can't say the same for his other two friends.  The chubby kid has an alcoholic mother who's so desperate for a man, she actually places her son in the shower to give him a back rub and other times smears his face with a glass liquor bottle while he's eating food on the floor.

Basically the mother hits on her own son.  Really REALLY creepy and I hope this kind of dysfunction doesn't happen in real life.  Anyway the kid does the smart thing and tries to ignore it the best he can.  He even locks the bedroom door by pushing a chair under the handle in one scene so his mother can't get in.  The way she screams to be let in while he leaves through the window to ride his bike around is pretty startling.

The other friend has a scumbag wife beater/son beater of a father.  He too is an alcoholic.  He hangs around the house all day complaining and demanding his wife and kid do what he says.  If not they get slapped.  Knowing about the ghoul he threatens the boys to stay away from the cemetery.  Oddly I never noticed both friends are dealing with alcoholic parents until now- just for one friend it's the mother, the other the father.  This man especially hates Nolan's character since he likes to point out how messed up the man is with his alcohol drinking.

Since we're only ever teased by the ghoul, the movie has to rely on atmosphere.  But there's not much in the way of that.  Instead what makes Ghoul decent is the storytelling among the three boys.  There's also older teens that spy on the boys because they want to know about their little hideout away from their dysfunctional parents, however they never show intimidation towards the kids like you'd expect and eventually become fresh meat for the ghoul.

You know what's weird about Ghoul?  While the soundtrack's excellent, many of the songs begin with a sequence of notes that remind me of popular songs from the 60's through 80's!  Such as the middle part from Genesis ""Stagnation"", Creedence Clearwater Revival's ""Bad Moon Rising"", the intro from Cream's ""Anyone For Tennis"", the intro to ""We Got the Beat"" by the Go Go's, ""Hey Mickey"" by Toni Basil (the very first song that plays in the movie in fact, and I was convinced *this* song was going to start up!), Love and Rocket's ""I'm Alive"" and ""Stuck In the Middle With You"" by Stealers Wheel.  I guess the 80's songs are fitting considering the story takes place in 1984, but it's strange how many of the songs borrow from the classics.

Overall Ghoul is good enough for the story, but not scary by any means.  I'll give it 4 stars but barely.",1481673600,,3465,4.509615384615385
8542754,3,B009L63QHI,"The story-line and writing in regards to the kids is fantastic. However, the writing for the adult characters, not to mention the appearance of the creature itself, leaves something to be desired. The deviation from Brian Keene's stellar ending from the novel is appalling. All in all, the movie is worth seeing, but if you've read the book, well, the movie doesn't compare.",1454544000,,374,4.9523809523809526
8542755,1,B009L63QHI,"Im a fan of Brian Keene although I have never read the novel upon which this made-for-TV film was based.  Somehow I bet Keene thinks that the director and screenwriter also didn't read his novel.  Keenes novel of a supernatural monsters that lives beneath a small town cemetery is turned into a repellent film about child abuse with not one, but two children abused by their parents, one physically and one sexually.

The film plays like an extended episode of Goosebumps and were it not for the sexual abuse angle it would probably rate no worse in terms of its content.  Three friends, Timmy, Barry, and Doug have built an underground fort in the local cemetery.  The town has an urban myth about a creature called the ghoul that was seen by several men during a mining accident years earlier.  When several local teenagers are killed or disappear, the boys begin to investigate the old tunnels beneath the cemetery.  And would that were what the film was all about.  Even it was tame at least it might be entertaining.

Instead we get far more of the child abuse angle as Barry is constantly slapped around by his dad, the cemeterys drunken caretaker, and Doug is sexually abused by his mother because she desperately needs affection after his father left them.  And the clueless adults do nothing.  Thats the real horror and its hardly entertaining.

The film pulls a total bait and switch compared to the book turning a supernatural monster into little more than the average Scooby Doo villain.  The acting on the part of the kids who have to carry the film is atrocious.  In particular, Nolan Gould (of Modern Family) who plays the lead kid role of Timmy is as wooden as they come which is strange because the kid has an extensive resume.  Not even worth a watch on free TV.",1438387200,,1780,4.624203821656051

8542760,1,B009L63QHI,"This was just awful.
This is not a horror movie, this is a movie about child abuse, and it's a pitiful attempt at that.

""It's set in 1984"", yeah, they don't have cell phones if that's what you mean.
It feels like anything but the 80's, and references nothing to the era, even the clothing and the general way everyone talked; it was just too modern.

Also, the monster was laaaaaame! :P",1361750400,4,387,4.361111111111111
