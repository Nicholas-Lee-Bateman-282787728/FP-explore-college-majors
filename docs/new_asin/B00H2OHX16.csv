6129572,4,B00H2OHX16,"As a big time old school pro wrestling fan I love it a lot. The only problem is that on the first disc of 1987, I am unable to watch the tag team Survivor series match. It freezes at the end of the ladies match and does not go forward. Even from the menu it is not able to be chosen.",1514764800,,283,3.6557377049180326

6129574,5,B00H2OHX16,"I watched them all, it's very good. Back in those days the wwe enjoyed putting on elimination matches, they really focused on it, except 1991 they didn't as much. It put on a great pay-per-view, but now the wwe lost its mojo of how to put on a great survivor series ppv. This two volumes of survivor series is recommended to get & hopefully sometime the wwe will have volume 3 & 4 released",1439164800,3,389,4.27027027027027

8629277,1,B00H2OHX16,"All the matches are awesome and it's great to see the heyday of some of wrestling's best, BUT the DVDs are horrible. All of them stop playing @ hour and twenty minute mark. Just get stuck. The DVD is not scratched and I've cleaned my machine multiple times. I can only conclude it's a terrible copy or formatting problem. I also returned the first set I had because of this problem and the second set has the same issue.",1518998400,,420,4.329113924050633

8629280,5,B00H2OHX16,"Great Buy. This old school WWF DVD set brings back memories !!! ( Yes I said WWF not WWE, because Wrestling was better before 2001 when Vince took over the world and created WWE. ) This Survivor Series set is Vol. 1 & 2, which is 1987-1996. I paid 20 $ $ $ for ten years of nostalgia. You get Macho Man, Bret Hart, Ultimate Warrior and many other WWF greats and Legends. From a huge WCW and WWF fan this 10 disc DVD set is a fantastic buy.",1516838400,2,439,3.943820224719101
