Edmond Purdom is so, so handsome, (loved him in The Student Prince)
and Alizia Gur is not only beautiful, her  performance terrific
was not too crazy over Janet Scott yet there are so many stars in the film who
 play cameo parts, that makes this
picture rather entertaining",1438473600,,289,4.647058823529412
8644811,3,B00IRMOD92,"More interesting in portaying Britain in the sixies still slowly recovering from WWII austerity....the acting is rather stilted...the print I had had muted ""muddy"" colour...as a moral parable it was weak...the efforts of the heroine prepared to sacrifice her virtue to win and the result was rather lame...still if you have some time to fritter away it's entertaining enough and harks back to an era that just predates the swinging sixties,Carnaby street and the Beatles",1355961600,,470,5.28
8644812,4,B00IRMOD92,"This has been something of a 'lost' film for us Brits who first saw it in cinemas back in the 60s, so its release on DVD, at long last, is to be welcomed.  However, all is not as it should be.  This Australian Region 4 edition has been mastered in a non-anamorphic format, so that the CinemaScope image - for it was filmed under licence from Fox in 'Scope - appears as a tiny image in the middle of a 16:9 screen, surrounded by black bars (The measured aspect ratio is approximately 2.2:1).  This is a massive step back to the early days of DVD. You will have to adjust your player or TV settings to get it anywhere near the full width of the screen without stretching the image.
That said, the print used is beautiful, with terrific colour and sharpness, and sound is good, too.  Included in the package is an excellent repro of the publicity campaign press book,which is a nice touch and goes someway towards making up for the 4:3 letteboxed transfer. Additionally there some extras on the disc which include some behind the scenes stills, original trailer and image gallery. The shipping from Australia probably makes it more expensive than it should be.
THE BEAUTY JUNGLE is a great little film, with an excellent cast under the assured direction of writer/director Val Guest, and would be a welcome addition to the collection of any fan of 60s British Cinema.  The film is well worth five stars but I've knocked one off for the 4:3 letterboxing!",1351382400,,1450,4.561538461538461
