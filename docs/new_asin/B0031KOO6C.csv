8387021,5,B0031KOO6C,"The stifling oppression of poverty and the tragedy born from it is the subject of this mature film from King Vidor. Based on Elmer Rice's Pulitzer Prize-winning play this Samuel Goldwyn produced film starring a young Sylvia Sidney is full of insight and maturity.

Though the entire film takes place on the steps of a tenament in New York where getting out is only a deam, only the first 15 minutes or so give evidence of its stage origins. Director Vidor, always innovative, uses photographer George Barnes' camera and a fine early score from Alfred Newman to give the viewer a real feel for lives being led in sometimes quiet, and sometimes not so quiet, desperation. Soon you are lost in their world and begin to understand that much of what happens is simply born of poverty and having nowhere else to turn.

Much of the film is made up of dialog between neigbors living in cramped and hot quarters. There are Jews and Germans and Irish, Rice's words and Vidor's direction letting their lives unfold through the street scene in front of their building during the summer heat. A fire hydrant may offer some relief to the small children in the street but it will take more than water for some.

At the center of everything is Mrs. Murrant (Estelle Taylor) and her daughter Rose (Sylvia Sidney). Taylor gives an excellent performance as a woman reaching out for any happiness she can find in the slums. Her husband and Rose's father provides food and shelter but is so caught up in his own unhappiness there is no love or tenderness left to give.

Only trying to get more from life than just looking after someone else will lead the lonely mother of Rose into the arms of the milk collector. Their looks and actions are not lost on the other women in the building, especially the snide Mrs. Jones. Neither is it lost on her son Willie's friends. When Rose's father begins to suspect, tragedy is not far behind.

Sylvia underplays her Rose with sincerity and maturity. She sees both sides and understands that it is their environment which is at the heart of all their problems. She herself is loved by a young Jewish boy whose mother likes Rose but knows his focus on getting out falters whenever she is near. Rose will grow up in an instant, when her life and that of her brother Willie's will change forever.

There are some quietly powerful scenes in this talky but rewarding drama from the early days of sound. Rose attempting to cross the street while a young newsboy tries to get her to purchase his last paper, not knowing the sensational headline touches her personally, is quite moving. It is still a powerful scene as an ambulance pulls away from Rose, taking with it her youth in these slums.

There is a rich and mature ending with Vidor's camera following Rose toward the unknown, the New York skyline of the time offering hope, perhaps, for a future born from tragedy. What has begun as a somewhat dated early talkie has become a moving and touching film of real substance.

King Vidor has been neglected when the subject of great directors comes up, possibly due to the fact that some of his best work, most notably ""The Stranger's Return,"" is not available. ""Street Scene"" is one of his best and, while slightly dated, is well worth a look for film buffs.",1279843200,2,3272,4.609965635738831
