8158476,5,B000KP62I4,"this is a very insightful film of how child abuse can still effect the lives of people who are now adults, how some stay in total denial, while others defend the offender. each of the four sister are all effected differently, some have become abusers themselves, while others cant hold down a job or hold relationships together

its a great movie for people who want to understand someone who has been abused, its also good for a person who has been abused to see that there is hope for a victim.",1377129600,,496,4.450549450549451
