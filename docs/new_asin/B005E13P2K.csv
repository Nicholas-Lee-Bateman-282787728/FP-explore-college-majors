8467818,5,B005E13P2K,This DVD has all eight episodes of the miniseries that was shown on The Third Eye on Nickelodeon in the eighties. My copy is labelled tvnz classics and is region free. It played fine on my non-modded region one Sony blu-ray player. The video quality is decent Vhs level. I turned the block filter up a little and the picture improved somewhat. It isn't perfect but it was fun to watch  again after 30 or so years.,1466899200,2,413,4.363636363636363
