Being somewhat aquainted with his philosophical (?) output in works such as Eye to Eye, A Brief Theory of Everything; A Brief History of Everything; Sex, Ecology and Spirituality; etc., I purchased this introduction to contemporary Buddhism to obtain some impression of the personability of Ken Wilber. People are encouraged to extend spiritual experience though a disciplined approach to mediation, study of psychology, etc.",1193443200,3,498,5.48051948051948
8163992,5,B000LSBMTO,"This beautifully filmed and edited dialogue between Traleg Rinpoche and Ken Wilber is a very valuable contact between eastern practice and western philosophy and ideas. One learns much about the role of eastern techniques of spirituality within a western context in the postmodern world. It is lengthy and deep, allowing both participants to express the core ideas of their respective traditions. The editing allows one to skip around and see the enriching material both presenters brought to the Center for Ethical Culture in New York in 2006. I highly recommend others to see this DVD.",1170460800,13,587,5.189473684210526
