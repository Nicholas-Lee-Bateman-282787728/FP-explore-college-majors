1648589,3,B00005QJK2,"This film gets 2.5 out of 5 stars (note: Amazon does not have 'half star' ratings) for accurately portraying the American point of view on the Vietnam War from a right wing, hawkish perspective.  There is absolutely no counter argument made, and any and all contradictory facts (of which any historian worth his salt could find an overwhelming number) are deliberately omitted. If you're unfamiliar with the extreme right-wing take on Vietnam, then there is value in seeing this film.  But don't expect to walk away from it knowing the truth of what happened, or what went wrong in Vietnam during America's campaign in Southeast Asia.

Sadly, the well worn points made in this film about the military ""having to  fight with one hand, or both hands, tied behind its back"", the fingers pointed at the traitorous liberal media and politicians inexplicably siding with communists, have been taken as articles of faith by vast numbers of people today.  The actual facts are far more subtle.

In truth, America had many successes in Vietnam - both political and military, but failed to properly understand and capitalize on them or see the bigger picture until too late.  Ironically, the positions taken in ""No Substitute for Victory"" in support of the war, are among the main reasons why the Communists prevailed.  American impatience with the pace of victory and frustration in coping with an enemy using asymmetrical battle tactics led to a widening of the war, including carpet bombing and the resulting 'collateral damage', which in turn lost us the very 'hearts and minds' that we needed to win in order to take popular support away from the Communists.  At the same time, propaganda (like this film) and outright lies by the military (inflated body counts, deliberately under reporting enemy numbers) led to wide scale disillusionment and loss of credibility with the American people.

Rather than own up to America's tactical and political blunders - which would make America a more powerful and effective champion of the freedom it stands for, movies like this put the blame on easy targets (hippies, traitors in the media and government) and in doing so, miss the point of history entirely and worse, perpetuates a culture war that continues to divide us as a people today.",1308096000,,2277,4.984168865435357
1648590,3,B00005QJK2,"For those old enough to remember, no matter which side of the issue you were on during America's Vietnam decade, the Hawks and Doves all had legitimate points to make about the conduct of this war and our country's presence in Indochina. John Wayne and an impressive group of authorities make a strong pro-war case in NO SUBSTITUTE FOR VICTORY (1970) that's based on the series of 20th Century events which culminated in the sending of U.S. personnel to Vietnam, first as advisors and then an active military force. They also present evidence that our government was unwilling to commit to total victory.

The all-important (and controversial) Tonkin Gulf incident that provided LBJ a basis for dispatching troops to South Vietnam is mentioned but not explored in depth. Regardless, years of guerilla attacks in the south perpetrated by Ho Chi Mihn's forces upon villagers, police and individual members of local governments needed to be addressed. The debate will always be whether Americans had to take up this burden. If you accept the premise in JFK's 1961 inaugural ""...that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe..."" then the answer is yes.

Things get heavy when Duke berates anti-war protesters who ""burn the American flag, stamp it into the ground while waving the flag of the Viet Cong..."" He labels them ""members of the enemy's forces."" In hindsight, such inflammatory language may have caused the concerned youth this film was in part addressing to tune out its entire message.

This mostly temperate and well presented 73 minute argument for a vigorous prosecution of the war is outstanding in its use of now rare film clips, plus the comments and reminiscences of newsman Lowell Thomas, Gen. Mark Clark, Gen. Albert Weidermeyer, Gen. Paul Harkins, Sgt. Barry Sadler, Adm. U.S. Grant Sharp, Wayne himself and others. Sharp's strategic analysis of a military hamstrung by government policy rings true, yet with both Red China and the USSR interested in the struggle's outcome, was victory in Vietnam ever really possible? We'll of course never know.

1648592,5,B00005QJK2,"Are we doomed to repeat the past?  This docudrama hosted by John Wayne was originally released 37 years ago.  Its participants, among them Mark W. Clark, Martha Raye, and Lowell Thomas, desperately tried to warn Americans that the leftist establishment was trying to hand victory over to the Communists in Vietnam.  Sadly, they failed.  Left wing agitators and their comrades in the media brought our country down to its knees.  They insulted our troops and glorified the ""freedom fighters"" of North Vietnam.  Our soldiers were forced to fight with one hand tied behind their back.  Please pay particular attention to the words of General Clark.  He personally witnessed how the United States previously snatched defeat out of the jaws of victory in both China and North Korea.  Doesn't this sound familiar?

Stop whatever you are doing and immediately order a copy of ""No Substitute for Victory.""  There is no doubt whatsoever that you will notice the disturbing parallels with our present conflict in Iraq.

1648593,3,B00005QJK2,"John Wayne narrates the lion's share of this documentary released in 1970 that has a specific purpose, i.e., to shift the opinion of the public to favour support of the U. S. war against North Vietnam and the Viet Cong during a time when America's cultural atmosphere was strongly antagonistic towards this country's involvement; unhappily for the individuals selected to offer their viewpoints, such as Generals Mark Clark and Albert Wedemeyer, journalist Lowell Thomas, and others, they stare straight into the camera's eye as they haltingly read their lines, detracting from their shared message, one that certainly includes salient points relative to politician interference with and control of our armed forces' efforts and the subsequent demoralization of servicemen; a yet greater reason for the production's eventual failure to persuade is its twisted view of historical events, replete with inaccuracy despite inclusion of captivating footage; in sum, an interesting cinematic document of a dramatic period in our nation's history.",1122681600,4,1040,5.5886075949367084
1648594,1,B00005QJK2,"This is a vietnam film made by rabid anti-communist hawks.

The kind of guys who were all about putting on a tough show

without thinking anything through.

In it Wayne gathers up a bunch of the failed higher leadership

of the Army with strong anti-communist points of view to tell

everyone how anything less than winning in vietnam is not an

option.  And how America lacks the will/courage to fight a real

war on communism.

Its starts with the traditional idiotic cold-war views of the

extreme right.  What these guys wanted was total war with the

communist world regardless of the consequences.  At the peak

of their influence in the 1950s, they were pushing for putting

the US on a permenant war economy basis and drafting almost

everyone.  And that was still their real goal when this film

was made.  They never understood that nuclear war was the

ultimate result of what they were pushing or else they knew

and didn't care.

Wayne gives a series of dumb history lessons.  He first tells

us that somehow the US let the russians have eastern europe

and Berlin.  He doesn't seem to know that the russians conqured

those territories on their own and *they* gave *us* part of

Berlin, not the other way around.  I guess Wayne wanted to

continue World War 2 with an attack in 1945 on Russia.

The second dumb history lesson is China.  Wayne apparently

thought that the US fighting a super-vietnam war in China

in support of a failed unpopular government was a great idea.

As in Vietnam, Wayne can't quite explain why these evil

communist governments can get so many people to fight for

them while our ""good"" allies can't gather together much of

anyone to fight back.

He then moves on to Korea.  He seems not to understand that

if the US widened the war in Korea or took it deeper into

China, the only result would have been the Chinese expanding

the war themselves and moving their bases back further.  Again,

Wayne's solution is to turn a regional war into an all-out

war with China and presumably Russia.

In Vietnam, Wayne repeats the foolish arguments that expanding

the war would have led to victory.  But as responsible people

in the army and elsewhere knew at the time, those ideas would

do nothing but expand the scope of the war.  Mine Haiphong

Harbor and the supplies would come overland from Chinese ports.

No amount of bombing of the Ho Chi Minh Trail was able to

seriously disrupt the movement of supplies and NVA south.  And

if you attack into North Vietnam, China probably comes in and you

have Korea all over again.  Wayne's answer would of course have

been to ignore all the dangers and push forward to total

all-out war with China and Russia.  Thats the whole theme here.

Wayne digs out other guys to suggest the old idea that bombing

could win the vietnam war or force North Vietnam to make peace

on american terms.  That was never going to happen.  Even in

1972-73, the only way the US got ""peace"" was making it on

the terms of the north vietnamese (which led to the end of

south vietnam).  Area bombing or city bombing has never driven

any country to the peace table.  Not in WWII, not in Vietnam.

The documentary makes all sorts of warnings about what will

happen if we lose.  But what it doesn't say is that the two

other dominos (Laos and Cambodia) that fell were both involved

in the vietnam war for years.  The US had been fighting a proxy

war in Laos since before 1960 in order to pressure North Vietnam.

And Nixon encouraged an army coup in cambodia that switched

cambodia from neutral to the US side.  Obviously bloodbaths

followed the victory of the other side in the war, but what

was the alternative?  Would fighting the vietnam war for

twenty more years have been worth it?  Was Wayne's idea of

turning vietnam into a new world war against China and Russia

a sane thing to propose?  Sure, it was terrible what the KRs

and Vietnamese did, but the choices for the US in order to

stop it would have led to worse things happening.

And the dumbest predictions (Red Guards ready to attack Australia

) didn't happen.  The war only spread in southeast asia to the

countries around vietnam.  And the immediate aftermath of

the war was the communists turning on each other.  Vietnam

invades Cambodia and China attacks vietnam.  There was no

domino effect and there was no unified communist conspiracy.

As far as Wayne goes, it doesn't take much to make a case

for communists having blood on their hands, the problem is

what he (or anyone else) proposes to do about it.

And all Wayne can come up with is stupid ideas that lead

America either into an all-out war with Russia and China

or build the american army up to the strength of Russia/China.

The idiots that came up with that last idea in the 1950s never

quite understood that drafting and financing an american

peacetime army of 3 million men would have destroyed capitalism

and the vitality of the country.

We clearly know now in the light of history that communism

would eventually destroy itself without the need for a world

war or turning america into a permenant war economy country.

We also know that losing in vietnam wasn't the end of the world.

In fact, getting out of vietnam saved the american army from

total disintegration.

The russians proved by their experiences in Afghanistan that

getting out of vietnam was the right decision for the US.

The worse thing about Wayne is that his whole image was a

con job.  He was a draft-dodger who never put himself (WWII) or

as far I know any of his children out on the line in any

war.  His first deferment was for family reasons.  His second

was because his studio went to washington and got a special

excemption for him.

If you want to call yourself a patriot, talk up driving the

country into a world (or nuclear) war and talk about how

the country lacks guts, you better have done something more

yourself than make a bunch of movies.

The world and the US can be glad that nobody listened to

these maniacs.  I don't endorse the lefties of the 1960s

(thats for sure), but we had to get out of Vietnam when

we did to save the army and the country.  And if nutcases

like Wayne had been listed to, we would either all be dead

as the result of his global war on communism or you would

be living in ""wartime"" america which would not look that

much different than the soviet union.",1109116800,8,6410,4.5215859030837
1648595,4,B00005QJK2,"For some curious reason, the Vietnam War was largely absent from US cultural outlets like cinema, comic books, television shows, etc. even though it was one of the most important issues of the time.  In the movies, only two films actually dealt with Vietnam as a primary focus when the war was still raging.  The two were To the Shores of Hell (1964) and The Green Berets (1968).  Both films were pro-US and pro-US involvement in Vietnam.  Perhaps it was fitting that the fellow (John Wayne) involved with bringing to the silver screen the most well-known of the two Vietnam films (The Green Berets) was also responsible for the documentary that argued not only for the US effort in Vietnam but also for victory.  In this film, Wayne calls upon several military veterans of the Vietnam War as well as generals who had experience with communist countries and communist enemies to make the point that the US has dealt with communist lands with kid gloves and hasn't had the political will to win in hot wars with them.  To make this case, Wayne goes from the aftermath of WWII in showing how the US slowed down in taking territory and let the Soviets go into Berlin and Eastern Europe.  (Incidentally, it is here where Wayne is on his weakest ground.)  Admittedly, the US slow down allowed Stalin's USSR to plant the Red Banner further in the West.  The US could've marched further east to make sure more people didn't fall under the communist banner.  However, the US would have likely taken many more casualties, certainly more in taking Berlin which cost the Soviets about 500,000.  Wayne makes a stronger case against the mistake of not supporting Chiang Kai-Shek in China against the communists as well as the insanity of bombing restrictions in the Korean War such as not bombing the Yalu River bridges, not hitting targets in China, etc.  In Vietnam, Wayne makes a compelling argument that the ""fighting with one hand tied behind the back"" approach to was being used by the US.  Many areas were placed off limits to US airpower and naval might such as Haiphong Harbor.  On top of this, it is pointed out that the war was micromanaged from Washington and that targets had to be approved.  (LBJ famously opined that the US couldn't ""bomb an outhouse"" without his approval.)  This took time and sometimes the approval never came.  Wayne further makes the overwhelming case that bringing the other side to the peace table cannot be done with bombing halts, only through massive strength.  He has a former Korean War general to make this case and also points out that bombing halts didn't spur the North Vietnamese efforts for peace.  (Indeed, Nixon in 1972 used city bombing to bring the North Vietnamese back to the peace table.)  Overall, quite a bit of what the documentary warned about came to pass.  After the US pull-out, Laos, South Vietnam, and Cambodia fell to the communists, and bloodbaths did result, especially in Cambodia with the deaths of 2 million people.  Other predictions, though, (communist insugency in Australia, for example) did not.  Far from Wayne having ""blood on his hands"" as some would say, Wayne accurately depicted communist aggression throughout the world and demanded from the US a will to win against it.  Even with the technical problems that the film has, it still is an important piece of Cold War history.",1089072000,25,3345,4.797556719022688

The Vietnam war helped no one - not the United States, or the Vietnamese people, because it was not intended to be won. Had the full power and might of the Untied States been brought to bear on Hanoi from the beginning, the war would have been won in 90 days instead of a deadly, lingering series of conflicts that decimated the people and countryside.
Henry Kissinger said in 1968, ""Victory in Vietnam is neither possible, or desirable."" That begs the question, ""Why were we there?"" Wayne skillfully exposes the traitorous intrigue that operated behind the scenes to make the war a humiliating defeat for America. When history and common sense is lost to the American populace, we will be led into more and more of such fruitless debacles.
