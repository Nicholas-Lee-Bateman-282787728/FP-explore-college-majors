8606959,5,B00EN71TH4,"I love Bollywood and I love this workout. All of the Bollywood dance DVDs that I've purchased in the past were slow-paced and geared toward instruction. This is not a bad thing but what I've really longed for is a Bollywood workout that burns calories. And this is it.

The workout is broken into approx. 4-minute sections that consist of the instructor silo'd on a special effects background. Each section is nonstop and most of the dance moves are total body which makes for a great cardio workout. There is minimal instruction and you just follow along by watching the instructor. That may sound daunting but I was easily able to keep up, hitting only a few minor speed bumps. The DVD is nicely broken into two 20-minute sets with the option to play them separately for shorter workouts or together for a longer 40-minute workout. I found Set 1 very easy to follow; Set 2 had slightly more complicated footwork but it's nice to have something to work toward. As for the music, I don't know what others are referring to because this is the Bollywood I love. My current fave ""Sadi Gali"" is even used for one segment. What a treat!

Yes, Bollywood Groove Cardio is an ""indie"" production. Personally, I have no problem with the lower quality video--I'm interested in the workout--but apparently this is important to some consumers so it's worth a mention. The only issue I had was that the DVD case was damaged when it arrived, and the DVD was rattling around inside. When I first played it, the cool down section stuttered and skipped; I cleaned the DVD with alcohol and a lint-free cloth and it played through this morning. Testament to how much I love this workout is the fact that I did not want to return it for another one because I didn't want to be without it for any length of time. As a matter of fact, I'll probably buy another DVD just to have a back-up. (Yes, I'm that much of a video fitness nut that I keep spares of my favorite DVDs.)

Thank you Bollywood Groove for making one of my workout dreams come true. And here's hoping they release more workouts in the near future.",1397692800,2,2089,4.521164021164021

8606962,5,B00EN71TH4,I have danced to this DVD many times and still continue to enjoy it!  Ajanta (the dance choreographer) is full of vibrant energy whose verbal cues support and encourage the viewer.  The Bollywood music is upbeat and fun to dance to.  The movements are easy to follow and yet challenging to keep up for a number of minutes.  This is a great video to have in your collection for home workouts!,1390003200,,391,4.464788732394366
