2663103,5,B000ISNETI,"DVD - Dating Fossils And Rocks - Mike Riddle

In this DVD, Mr. Riddle shares the results of his much reading and research in the area of Carbon 14 dating, and explains the importance of Carbon 12 in conjunction with C-14.
He explains in simple terms the molecular breakdown process. He also discusses other dating methods and the underlying assumptions the methods are based on, the correctness of which are brought into question.

Mike is an interesting and dynamic speaker. His visual aids are excellent.

Mike Riddle has degrees in mathematics and education. He's a former Marine, national decathlon champion, former technical specialist and manager for Microsoft, and teacher at ICR's graduate school.

I recommend this DVD for ages 12 and older.",1199577600,7,750,5.122950819672131

8147300,5,B000ISNETI,What a wonderful DVD!! Very technical yet easy for a layman like me to understand! I have already shared this with non-believers and they were extremely impressed. We need more DVDs like this where professional scientists in the field can share their vast knowledge of a creationist proofs to those of us who are non-scientists.,1463011200,,328,4.9818181818181815
8147301,5,B000ISNETI,"Along with another video by Mike Riddle, we watched this together as a family, ages four to 46. The Astronomy video is longer than his other videos, but necessary to thoroughly cover the topic, which he does. I recommend watching in two sittings. We would pause along the way to discuss and ask questions. Since this adds time to the length of the video, we usually watch in two sittings. We were able to download a free study guide & outline good for all ages. We found it on the Answers in Genesis website. It is kind of hard to find at first. Go to the ""education"" tab and then click on ""study guides"" and then choose ""The Riddle of Origins Series"". It was helpful for me, as a parent to follow along with the study guide during the video and for review before and after watching. We have been using this video as a break from a more traditional text book approach. This can serve as a stand alone or as a supplement to a formal science curriculum. You can use the video and study guide as a spring board to further research and develop the topic. We also like the Institute for Creation Research (ICR), Apologia, Apologetics Press, Jobe Martin, & Buddy Davis, and some of the other products they carry.",1402790400,,1206,4.4125560538116595

8147303,5,B000ISNETI,"The speaker covers three main areas: radiocarbon dating; radioisotope dating and scientific evidences for a 'young' earth.

After some elementary atomic physics, the theory of carbon dating is explained in simple terms and the viewer is educated about assumptions the public is unaware of, i.e., that C-14 environmental rates of production and decay are in equilibrium and the C-14/C-12 ratio has been constant throughout history.

The impact of solar radiation, earth's magnetic field, global catastrophism and nuclear activity on the veracity of the method is mentioned.

Similarly, faulty radioisotope dating assumptions are exposed: zero initial 'daughter' decay products; complete rock isolation from its surroundings over 'millions' of years and constant decay rates. Real-life cases of known ages are provided where the method totally fails. The dangers of experimental bias are also explained.

Mr. Riddle remains objective and scientific in his approach. While he praises the measurement precision of quantities, the folly of converting these into reliable ages is laid open as is the position of those basing their world-view on them.

A concise and engaging educational presentation.",1367366400,5,1194,5.72316384180791

8147305,5,B000ISNETI,"Due to the advance in technology and methods, conclusions drawn with scientific methods in the past can be wrong and subject to corrections. Sometimes, it is very hard to challenge them because of political, culture, or economical reasons. Mike Riddle put up this wonderful dvd with 'scientific' and 'logic' evidences to point out the flaws of popular beliefs regarding carbon 14 dating that have been misled us for decades.

8147306,5,B000ISNETI,"I had some trepidation about how approachable this would be in teaching dating methods, but it turned out to be quite good.  I can't understand the problem the one reviewer had, because the teacher never deviates from established scientific principles, such as that we cannot date non-living things with carbon dating.  There is no twisting or denying anything in order to support a ""christian' view.  Each principle he demonstrates can be verified in science text books, such as carbon dating, lead dating, etc.

Since the theory of evolution cannot be proven by any witnesses of the process (a requirement of scientific method) evolution should be categorized for what it is - a philosphy.  When the curator of the world's largest fossil museum admits that in the millions of fossils he has there is not ONE missing link, then we need to realize that evolution must be taken on faith - that makes it religion, not science.  And don't bother with posts and comments, I have heard the other side most of my life and am just not interested in being lied to anymore.

Yes I was taught and believed nothing but evolution for most of my life, but I have to agree now with the likes of Professor Michael Behe and Dean H. Kenyon, Professor Emeritus of Biology at San Francisco State University (who wrote the major evolution textboks for colleges!) that science does not prove evolution.  Get Unlocking the Mystery of Life with this DVD.  Neither repeats the other's material, but they support each other well.",1241395200,6,1504,4.821011673151751
8147307,5,B000ISNETI,"JBURGENSEN,

I appreciate your deference to Christianity, Jesus wants us all but only a few make it. I'm a former evolutionist (educated in science at the university) and for the life of me I could never provide any viable evidence. Please share with me ""all the evidence"" that points in your direction.",1228176000,3,303,4.826923076923077
