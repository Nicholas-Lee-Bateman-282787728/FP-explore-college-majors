5926915,5,B00EL6ACRA,"I've been a fan and collector of music for many decades, but it's amazing how many artists slip through the cracks.  Then years later we discover how they influenced so many artists and had a unique fan base.  I was interested in seeing this documentary after having seen ""Searching For Sugar Man"" a couple years ago.  That film featured Detroit's Sixto Rodriguez whose career went nowhere in the 1970's but whose music was discovered years later by fans in South Africa.

Big Star is a similar story about a band formed in Memphis in the early `70's.  It consisted of guitarist/vocalist Alex Chilton, guitarist/vocalist Chris Bell, bass player Andy Hummel and drummer Jody Stephens.  Early on, the songs were co-written by Chilton and Bell.  After Bell's departure, Hummel takes a larger writing role.  Documentarians Drew DeNicola and Olivia Mori do a credible job showing the evolution of the band which led to an initial 3 year and 3 album lifespan.  Chilton and Bell became antagonistic, each searching for something different.  Friends became enemies.  Sound familiar?  Yet they inspired numerous musicians including R.E.M., The Replacements, The Posies and others.

The best interviews come from those closest to the band, including Stephens.  Based on the musical glimpses featured in the film, the band seems to be a mixture of The Beatles and the Eagles.  Frankly I had never heard of the band at the time although they enjoyed some radio play in some cities.  I am familiar with a big hit from the late 60's called ""The Letter"" which was made popular by a group called The Box Tops which featured the gravely-voiced Chilton.  In any case, the pieces I heard are enough to get me searching for their first two albums.  The third album excludes Bell as did most of the second and it wasn't release until years after the band broke up.  In any case, if you're interested, the first two (#1 Record and Radio City) are available on the same SACD.  Such a deal.  The documentary is well researched and nicely presented.

The Blu ray transfer has a 1080p video resolution and a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  The interviews are sparklingly clear.  Much of the material is archive material so the video does the best that can be expected.  The audio comes in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  As you might expect, the vast amount of the material is coming from the center channel, certainly the interviews.  Some ambient sound comes from the surrounds, but it's minimal.  In a couple cases, audio excerpts are enhanced digitally and contain subtitles for clarity.  Extras include 3 deleted scenes totaling about 10 minutes, individual outtakes of founders Bell and Chilton, a short called Big Star in the Studio, a trailer and some Magnolia Home Entertainment promos.  Subtitles are available in French, Spanish and English SDH.  Region A.",1397347200,3,2825,4.909090909090909

5926918,1,B00EL6ACRA,"I watched Big Star: Nothing Can Hurt Me recently and was left feeling disappointed. I was very excited a film about Big Star was being made, but this wasn't the film I pictured at all. I wanted to hear the stories behind the songs and the recording sessions, but you barely hear anything about that. Instead you're treated to mostly rock journalists, music industry people and musicians rave about them and talk about how they should have been a more popular act. We can all agree on that, but it's a point that doesn't need to be repeated monotonously. They left behind great music which is foremost in importance. I was also disappointed to see Alex Chilton's years in the Box Tops weren't touched on much.

Even with my disappointment, I do understand that almost the entire band is deceased now and there's very little film out there of them. Alex Chilton didn't want to be involved when he was alive. These are definitely big setbacks. I still think they could have done a whole lot better and made a much more interesting film. It drags on for nearly 2 hours. I was zoning out and losing interest after the first hour. The real substance of this band was never explored. If you never heard their music, I feel like after seeing this film you wouldn't even have much of an idea of what it sounds like.",1391126400,7,1306,4.510548523206751

(2013)
. . .

Power-pop progenitors Big Star cut a wide swath through the college station I worked at in the 1980s (KALX, Berkeley), with various reissues over the years, Alex Chilton's earnest solo career and covers of Big Star (such as This Mortal Coil's haunting take on ""Kangaroo"") and all those old Box Tops albums laying around the studio... quite a legacy! ""September Gurls"" is surely one of the most playable, high volume-worthy pop songs ever, and each reissue, reunion and rarities package that came our way revealed new nuggets to relish.

This documentary, adoring but honest, paints the picture of the Memphis pop and blues scene that nurtured the talents of Alex Chilton and Chris Bell, the giddy rise of the Ardent studios and record label, the sad inability of the band and the label to capitalize on their sheer genius, and their crushing commercial failure on the national stage. There were a lot of factors, but the main problem seems to have been that their local label was a big fish in a small pond, utterly unable to keep up with the big boys in New York and LA, and their naivety doomed them almost before they even began. Nonetheless, the group recorded three brilliant albums, leaving a bright legacy that survived the psychological breakdown (and untimely death, in 1978) of co-founder Chris Bell, with Big Star influencing numerous '80s bands and igniting new fans steadily over the decades.  Chilton passed away in 2010, and this movie was made without either Bell or Chilton's direct participation (though archival footage of both artists in their dreamy, magnetic youth is quite compelling...) Instead, we are treated to interviews of friends, former bandmates and various upper-echelon rock critics who rooted for the band years ago, and still love their music today.  This is a film any Big Star fan will want to check out -- the story is sad, but emblematic, and the picture painted here is human and true. Recommended!

5926921,5,B00EL6ACRA,Loved it ! I knew of Alex Chilton from a replacements song . Then found out about Big Star. What a find,1388188800,,103,3.727272727272727
5926922,5,B00EL6ACRA,"Having been a fan of Big Star for well over 20 years and having read anything and everything I can get my hands on about this band, I went into viewing this movie with some skepticism, thinking that any film would fall short telling the details of a complicated story...a story that really involves the journey of the two principal songwriters, plus numerous others who all played a role in crafting the sound and image of the band. Thankfully, I can say that the filmmakers have succeeded admirably in getting the job done. They follow both the careers of Alex Chilton and Chris Bell, showing up the paths each took before Big Star...and after Big Star. And just as importantly, they included many others who were involved in the story...John Fry, Carol Manning, John Dando, Steve Rhea, Jim Dickinson, etc. Perhaps even more importantly, the filmmakers had perfect timing, being able to capture the words of several key players before they passed away...including interviews with bassist Andy Hummel. (Nobody really expected Alex Chilton to participate, but his voice is still present throughout the movie.)

Some may complain that certain aspects of the story weren't covered in greater detail (including some of Chris Bell's personal struggles), but I think they managed to strike the right balance between telling a good story and celebrating the legacy of the band (and, most importantly, the music).

The Blu-Ray included a few nice extras, including some deleted scenes about Big Stars 1972 and 1974 tours, an extended series of scenes about Chris Bell (18 minutes) and Alex Chilton (24 minutes) that didn't make the final cut, and footage detailing Big Star's studio recording techniques with John Fry (15 minutes). For a long time fan like myself, this extra material is just as essential as the film and provides further depth to the overall story.

Whether you're a long time fan of the band or are just discovering their music, this film is highly recommended.",1387670400,11,1972,4.9878419452887535
5926923,5,B00EL6ACRA,"If you're not a Big Star fan, you should be.

If you already are, this documentary film hits all the right notes.

Equally marvelous and tragic, the career span of Big Star was wrought with brilliance and promise yet undermined by record label amateurism and inadequate marketing efforts.  The band were darlings of the music critics and fans of their infrequent live shows, but ""getting the word out"" proved too difficult and complicated for the local record label that didn't have the necessary reach or resources.

One band member quit partially out of frustration, and yet the band continued on and still churned out some of the best Seventies pop songs you've never heard.

But you'll learn all this from watching the film.

""Nothing Can Hurt Me"" is a loving tribute to the bittersweet success of a remarkable band.  Even for the uninitiated, this film is a must-see.",1386028800,10,872,4.851351351351352

8606533,3,B00EL6ACRA,"BIG STAR: Nothing Can Hurt Me is a 2012 documentary about the eponymous 1970s pop-rock band from Memphis that saw few sales in spite of enormous critical acclaim, but went on to become a cult phenomenon and inspire some great bands in the decades that followed. The documentary was made without the participation of Big Star's surly frontman Alex Chilton (and it was completed following Chilton's untimely death), but it does feature interviews with bassist Andy Hummel, drummer Jody Stephens, and the musicians brought on when Chilton announced a new Big Star in the 1990s. Furthermore, producer John Fry appears throughout the documentary and appears to have had a bigger role in the Big Star story than many listeners might have imagined.

The film begins with the Memphis context of the late 1960s/early 1970s. Chilton, who had already had a chart hit with the band The Box Top and toured the country, comes home and starts a new band with Chris Bell. The process of recording Big Star's first album ""#1 Record"" is explained in some depth, from how the band used the available studio resources to where the iconic cover art came from.

We learn how Bell splits after the first album, has a nervous breakdown and flirts with evangelical Christianity, tries to make it as a musician in England and cuts the legendary single ""You and Your Sister/I am the Cosmos"", and finally dies in 1978 of a car crash at only 27 years old. There are poignant interviews with Bells older brother and sister-in-law, but part of Bell's angst was his homosexuality, and everyone is uncomfortable even approaching this subject.

The documentary continues through the recording of Big Star's second (""Radio City"") and third (""Third/Sister Lovers"") records, followed by the ultimate breakdown of relations between Jody Stephens and Alex Chilton and the end of Big Star. There's some brief coverage of Chilton's solo career through the 1980s and the reformed Big Star in the 1990s and early millennium. There are some brief comments from later, perhaps more famous musicians that express an eternal debt to Big Star, like Teenage Fanclub and Mike Mills of R.E.M.

This is one of those documentaries that, to a degree, expects viewers to already know quite a bit about the band in question, making it somewhat frustrating for those who know Big Star's name and legacy but not so much the band's career and arc. It is mentioned that #1 Record sold poorly through label problems, but it's as if the viewer is already supposed to know that it was poorly distributed. It is mentioned briefly that Chris Bell died in a car crash, but with little detail. And there are some aspects of the production that seem mystery. For example, why does Jody Stephens have such a bad attitude throughout his interviews?

Still, I enjoyed BIG STAR: Nothing Can Hurt Me overall. So many rock documentaries interview people who exploded into stardom, moved to la-la-land like California and seem to live on another planet compared to non-celebrities. Here, on the other hand, it's amazing just what ordinary southern Americans these people are, who clearly have some good memories of their youth but never really went for celebrity culture. They could be one's neighbours or the people you pass in the supermarket. That's not to say that they aren't interesting, as they include some quirky characters like the affably campy John King and producer Jim Dickinson's elderly but eternally young widow.

The Blu-ray has over a half-hour of extra footage that talks about Big Star's early tours and studio techniques, as well as a bit more narration that helps fill in the story.",1483142400,,3630,4.932896890343699
8606534,2,B00EL6ACRA,"I watched this and tried to like it but I just couldn't recommend this to anyone.  I thought this documentary was about Big Star.  The first part of the documentary is decent but the last hour or so strays way too far away from Big Star and focuses far too long on non-important producers, engineers and Alex Chilton's punk era and further career as a solo artist.  Very little focus on Chris Bell or the other members.  Some tasteful editing or scene cuts should have been made.  Very generic and not worthy of being the definitive historical document of an amazing band.",1448928000,,572,4.568627450980392
