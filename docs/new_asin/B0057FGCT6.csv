4595205,5,B0057FGCT6,"I watched this movie with my grandmother and she died laughing.  Seriously.  We just buried her last Tuesday.  Now all my grandpa does is mope around his house looking at old pictures of her.  It's soooo annoying.  I've been stopping by his house to check in on him and he just sits there crying about how he misses her so much and how he can't live without her. Okay grandpa, I get it. You really liked her. Enough already.",1314835200,4,424,4.3164556962025316
4595206,5,B0057FGCT6,"Laid Off is definitely a movie we can all relate to, love to watch and will laugh from beginning to end. Most trailers just give only the funny parts of the movie, Laid Off's trailer didn't even begin to show you how hysterical this movie gets. It's definitely filled with stuff you and your friends will be quoting and joking about forever. It's the most fun I've had at a movie in a really long time!",1314835200,5,402,4.302631578947368
4595207,5,B0057FGCT6,"This movie is pure awesomeness.  It had me cracking up beyond belief.  To even fathom that they shot this film on a 3k dollar budget is an insane thought.  Co-star Michael Ryan did an incredible job.  He is hilarious. He just has pure, natural, raw talent.  You need to see this movie.  It will have you rolling.",1314835200,4,312,4.385964912280702

4595210,4,B0057FGCT6,Isn't everybody sick of watching the same old movie remade over and over again starring the same people over and over again? Here is a funny original movie that will... simply... make you laugh.  Remember when movies used to do that? Here's one you should see.,1316131200,,260,4.6521739130434785
4595211,5,B0057FGCT6,"I love comedies, but lately a lot that have been released in the theaters haven't quite been that rewarding. Laid Off, on the other hand, was hilarious through and through.  The performances and timing by the actors were dead on, and the over all craftsmanship of the film was outstanding! Definitely a must see for all! It's available both on Amazon, and I've also seen it available on on demand and on the ps3 store. Bottom line, you need to see this movie!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Laid-Off/dp/B0057FGCT6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Laid Off</a>",1316131200,,597,5.862068965517241
4595212,4,B0057FGCT6,"This flick has some pretty funny scenes, my favorite involves 40oz bottles of beer and a 10 year old boy.  Check it out!",1316131200,,120,4.217391304347826
4595213,5,B0057FGCT6,"This movie was awesome, start to finish. I haven't laughed as hard as I did at the ending since Wedding Crashers. You would be a fool not to check this flick out.",1316131200,,162,4.09375
4595214,5,B0057FGCT6,I could put this movie on repeat and never grow tired of the countless hilarious scenes and one-liners. This is a fantastic movie that will surely remain in my top picks for years to come!,1316131200,,188,4.4
4595215,5,B0057FGCT6,"This film is amazing! What I love most about the movie is that it is so relative to what is going on right now in our Country. Yes, the movie is funny. Yes, the acting is great. And yes, the writing and directing is top notch.  But what I enjoy most about the film is that it applies to America's real life struggles while having some fun with it!  People can and will relate to this film.  If you have not seen it yet check it out.  You will not be dissapointed.",1316131200,,463,4.0
4595216,5,B0057FGCT6,I would recommend if you are into indie comedy. The movie was hillarious and for less than $15 you really can't go wrong.,1316131200,,121,4.304347826086956
4595217,5,B0057FGCT6,"Down to earth comedy that will keep you laughing throughout. The two characters play well off each other. Perfect for younger kids who like partying, or older people who can look back on their glory days. Gotta check out this flick out!",1316131200,,236,4.642857142857143
4595218,5,B0057FGCT6,"I personally thought this film was outstanding.  I watch a lot of independent films, and I haven't seen one like this in a long time.  I think what separates Laid Off from other indies is the acting.  Both the male and female leads were tremendously believable and funny.  The two guys have great chemistry and you really get the feeling that they have been best friends there entire lives.  After watching the trailer I thought it was going to be the same old stupid comedy about guys in their mid-20's smoking pot and boozing, however, I was pleasantly surprised that this film had substance; a relateable  story, great characters, and laugh-out-loud-jokes.  I would definitely recommend a indie/comedy lover to buy this film.",1316044800,,728,4.918032786885246
4595219,5,B0057FGCT6,"This movie was hilarious. I haven't purchased a DVD in a long time, but this movie was so funny that I had no choice.  I haven't laughed that hard in a long time.

4595220,5,B0057FGCT6,"This has to be one of the better movies I have seen in a long time.  That son of a gun CJ Moebius has done it again, straight killing the little big screen with his freestyles, spitting game, and cracking so many damn jokes.  This is a great movie for just about any crowd and will have you walking away straight laughing like no other.  Big Ups to the whole crew for an outstanding job and I give this movie 5 big ol fat stars.",1316044800,,428,4.011764705882353
4595221,5,B0057FGCT6,"Entertaining movie that is quite timely given the current economic conditions. About two guys who get laid off and take their time to party before they start taking their job hunt seriously. There are some pretty funny scenes, definitely worth watching!",1316044800,,253,5.195121951219512
4595222,5,B0057FGCT6,"Laid Off is truly comic genius! I watched this movie on a whim and was blown away with how much was done with the film on such a low budget. Each actor delivers their lines with great comic timing, especially the two leads CJ and Mike. This movie is so relatable and will definitely have anyone who watches it laughing hysterically!!",1316044800,,333,4.475409836065574
4595223,5,B0057FGCT6,"i didn't know what to expect when I watched this movie off video on demand one night and man, i was laughing my ass off. The humor is real and refreshing. It reminded me of early Kevin Smith movies with natural raw talent. That C.J. Moebius is hysterical, looking forward to more from this guy.",1316044800,,294,4.363636363636363

4595228,5,B0057FGCT6,BEST. MOVIE. EVER. A definite must see. It was great watching a movie that I can relate to and laugh so hard that I was in tears. Michael and CJ are GREAT together!,1315958400,,164,4.0

4595267,5,B0057FGCT6,"Laid Off is a funny, well written, well directed and acted out by a group of very talented actors who make light of today's current economic conditions and open the bright light of humor, to cast down upon bad news.

CJ Moebius, aka Mike La Gante, is great! I bought several copies for friends who've been, Laid Off and they agree...it's ""Hysterical""
Refreshing humor is the greatest gift to all who are suffering during these terrible economic times.
Laughter may just be the new, ""Opiate of the people"".",1315958400,,505,4.738636363636363
4595268,5,B0057FGCT6,"Michael Ryan has got some talent, this one is definately worth the buy.  Patrick Murray is a very under rated actor and deserves some recognition here...Nuff Said..",1315958400,,164,5.074074074074074
4595269,5,B0057FGCT6,"Not many comedies out there succeed.  Some try and many fail.  Yet, this one delivers...bigtime!  One of those comedies that leave an impression and leave you walking away quoting some of the many great parts of the movie, like I did with Wedding Crashers, Pineapple Express, Superbad and other great ones -always a tell tale sign of a memorable movie.",1315872000,,352,4.833333333333333
4595270,5,B0057FGCT6,"I saw this at the State College screening and was very impressed.  Consistently funny throughout, with witty writing and good acting.

Glad to see this getting released on DVD, I will definitely be adding it to my collection.",1315872000,3,318,4.543859649122807
4595271,5,B0057FGCT6,"If you liked Office Space, you'll like Laid Off; it's funny from start to end. Dug is the funniest character even though everyone is hilarious. Never thought that losing your job could be so entertaining.",1315872000,,204,4.857142857142857
4595272,5,B0057FGCT6,Cannot believe this was made with such little funding. I will definitely be watching this many times over. The flow of the movie allows you to be consumed by the two leads. Lots of funny moments. You must give it a view!,1315872000,,220,4.261904761904762
4595273,5,B0057FGCT6,"Amazing indie film!  Never expected to laugh so much from beginning to end!  The actors are hysterical and so natural!  Done with class, not all that ridiculous, stupid humor I've seen time and time again with Jim Carrey and other big name actors.  This film has heart.  Can't wait to see what these guys come up with next!",1315872000,,323,4.5
4595294,5,B0057FGCT6,"If you liked Wedding Crashers, Old School, and other movies of that ilk, you'll love this movie; it's raunchy, funny, and, yes, at some junctures, a classy friend-story. Although you would never know it from the quality of the score, dialogue, video, and audio, it's amazing to think that these guys made this movie on a shoe-string budget.

Buy it. Watch it. You will not regret it.

If you want--and you're a hot 20 something--you can watch it with me...",1315872000,2,456,4.6875

4595296,4,B0057FGCT6,"I want expecting much, but I was surprised how funny this film is. There is some hilarious dialogue throughout and solid acting.

4595300,5,B0057FGCT6,"One of the funniest movies I have seen in the past 5 years! A great low budget comedy, went in with low expectations, and laughed my @ss off. Then I watched it again and laughed even harder. I think it may be available on-demand from comcast but I just bought it on here. I would much rather pay the few extra dollars to own it.",1315872000,,328,4.061538461538461

8460543,5,B0057FGCT6,"Being a female, and not really a big fan of raunchy comedies, I was a bit skeptical in the quality of the flick.  To my surprise, I ended up truly enjoying this flick.  The two female characters in the movie are hilarious, and have big careers ahead of them.  You can tell this movie was shot on a budget at times, but the acting makes up for anything lacking!",1316908800,,360,4.188405797101449
8460544,5,B0057FGCT6,"What an awesome flick.  This movie is definitely worth checking out.  Can't believe this team did such an unbelievable job with so few resources.  The cast was really great, especially this CJ Moebius character - unreal, the guy's got the demeanor on screen to be the next Vince Vaughn.  You heard it from me first.",1316822400,,315,4.672727272727273
8460545,5,B0057FGCT6,In this indie film you can feel the friendship and drive of the cast and crew. The chemistry of the cast makes you feel like you know them. Best of all the adult humor is mixed with creative humor--yes I watched Saved By the Bell too!,1316736000,,234,4.108695652173913
8460546,5,B0057FGCT6,This movie delivers!!! I was laughing nearly through the entire thing. Made me want to jump in the main characters shoes and just enjoy for a while. Well Done!!!!,1316649600,,162,4.620689655172414
