Will any of us ever forget exactly where we were when the news came that President Kennedy died?  Classes at my school were dismissed in order for the students to be home with family.  So many questions with no answers. I distinctly remember the incredible quietness all around me as the nation mourned his death.

6500142,2,B00LSVIY26,"Mildly interesting ""history"" of the 1960's era (why does TV have to be one of the most prominent themes going into this series?) The background of JFK was interesting if slanted (his infidelity was definitely sanitized. No mention of his affairs, including Marilyn Monroe?)  Also, the careful viewer will notice that this CNN-produced documentary includes no mention of ""Hanoi Jane""... wonder why that was?
Another thing I found irksome was how Tom Hanks was interviewed about the Apollo space missions, like he's some sort of credible source (other than being in a movie about a space mission.) Seriously, I'd rather hear from more credible NASA researchers, not the star of ""Bosom Buddies""...",1470268800,5,694,5.196428571428571

I personally preferred the same documentary series on the seventies, though, which I felt was somehow more adept at addressing the most important issues of the decade in question.

Either way, I personally love this project and hope that it will continue so I can look forward to the Eighties and Nineties.",1467072000,,512,4.953488372093023
6500146,1,B00LSVIY26,"I watched this on Netflix and thought it was an decent documentary (a bit too much focus on TV, but still), until it came to the part on the Cuban missile crisis. There the narrative came down to ""the Russians placed the nukes on Cuba, the US threatened with a blockade and then the Russians withdrew"". That's... So far from the truth as to be expected in a piece of Chinese propaganda (just go to the Wikipedia page on the Cuban missile crisis and read the ""crisis ends"" part to find out what really happened if you don't know what I'm referring to).

From Haight-Ashbury to the Moon, a huge portion of the decade was about getting high, one way or another.  From Woodstock to San Francisco, Liverpool to New York, music was as much part of the scene as it was the culture.  Everything went through radical changes in the Sixties.

Being a youngster in California in the 60s was probably the coolest thing ever.  Luckily that's how it was for me.  My wife, both younger and from a different part of the country, couldn't quite understand my childhood.  This series of programs helped.  It stretches from one end of the decade to the other.

6500154,5,B00LSVIY26,"FINALLY a documentary that effectively TEACHES the 1960s!!!  This documentary is the BEST anaylsis of the 1960s I've seen in thirty years of teaching American History.  EVERY segment is top-notch.  The space race, civil rights, women's liberation movement, United Farm Workers' Union, the British invasion, and the assassination of President Kennedy by Lee Harvey Oswald (plus more) topics are superbly presented--BOTH sides of each issue is analyzed; key participants from the time period are interviewed, and articulate historians add analysis to make sense of the 1960s.  All film clips are clearly labeled with names of key individuals, dates, and locations (where relevant.)  One topic that is rarely handled in a scholarly fashion is the Kennedy assassination but this documentary gets it RIGHT.  The conspiracy cultists, such as Mark Lane, are given their moment in the sun, but in the final analysis common sense and solid historical research wins out and a factual presentation of Oswald's sole guilt is presented.  The women's liberation movement and gay rights movements are brilliantly presented, analyzed, and debated.  I will add to my current body of lecture notes the analysis and background information this documentary offers and will pepper my in-class lectures with video clips and entire episodes for students to learn from.  This is a MUST have for any serious student of the 1960s.  I have also seen the Seventies and can't wait for ITS release also.  Great Work!!!!!!!",1460678400,3,1492,5.306382978723405

6500160,4,B00LSVIY26,"The Sixties was such a complex reality that it will never be completely and adequately captured in any ""history"" -- print, video, or otherwise. But the CNN video series ""The Sixties"" is decent enough to give the average reader or viewer a sense of some of the major themes of the ""decade."" Of course a great deal has to be left out, but that's the nature of any historical selectivity. The strengths of this series include the fact that the producers work with as much archival historical footage as possible. A downside is that they do not recognize a great deal of what was taking place -- underground, but not in ""The Underground"" so to speak -- that had a major impact on future history. For example, the ""G.I. Movement"" (which took place within all four branches of the ""service"") was a prime reason why the government of the United States abandoned the draft, apparently forever. Anyone who argues from a ""liberal"" position today that the USA should revitalize a military (or even public service) draft has to thank those of us who organized to end the ""draft"" by aiding and abetting the soldiers (sailors, airmen, Marines, and even Coast Guardsmen) who ultimately resisted the war at the wars' points of production (from Guam's B-52 bases and the Navy's aircraft carriers, to the grunts on the ground).

I note that because I worked for six years with that movement, just as others worked in the movements of ""The Sixties.""

Ultimately, the challenge is to figure out how to confront a ""historical"" period that faces oversimplification. When I was a public high school teacher in Chicago, I developed a course for seniors about the era. I called it ""The Sixties from the Mongomery Bus Boycott to the 'Fall' of Saigon."" Looking at the ways the decade(s) is viewed, it was clear, to me at least, that the ""Sixties"" was really an era that encompassed the span of the Civil Rights Movement, the ""anti-war"" movement(s), and so much else.

What ""The Sixties"" does as well as any history is to put to rest the silly notion about ""The Greatest Generation."" How anyone (other than a propagandist who wants to denigrate the contribution of us ""Boomers"") can refer to the generation that returned (as both my parents did, both in the Army and both in combat zones) from their ""service"" in The War as ""Greatest"" is just dishonest. Racism, imperialism, homophobia, male supremacy -- all returned from ""the service"" firmly in place in the USA. That was one of the realities in American society that this so-called ""Greatest Generation"" kept in place, and had to be forced to relinquish. Jackie Robinson and Martin Luther King personified one aspect of all that, but equally important to remember were the CIA coups d'etat on several continents that undermined progressive governments (and ultimately USA credibility) across the globe.

""The Sixties"" was worth my investment.",1453507200,,2867,4.868852459016393

6500164,5,B00LSVIY26,"Released in February of 2015, The Sixties DVD set by CNN is a great way to experience the most historically relevant moments of the decade captured on film. Executive produced by Emmy Award-winning producers Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman (HBO's ""John Adams"" and ""The Pacific""), and Emmy(R) Award-winning producer Mark Herzog (History's ""Gettysburg""), The Sixties is 510 minutes (10 part series) of immersive history and insight into America's past. Events and personalities interwoven into a mesmerizing story that unfolds in chapters. Cultural, political and technological changes are touched upon with some explored in depth. The hippies, the Cold War, space exploration, feminism, gay rights, civil rights and more!

My daughter and I started watching this series on CNN and as lovers of history, we became instantly enthralled. She received this DVD set as a gift for Christmas and we look forward to purchasing The Seventies when it is released on DVD. I highly recommend this one for all to see, and it would be an excellent addition to a home or school DVD library.

Comments from an article regarding 'The Sixties' - from the Visalia Times-Delta:

 "" The so-called talking heads that populate most documentaries are, in this series, the cream of the crop. Historians, journalists, former soldiers, eye witnesses to and participants in events  all offer pointed insight and / or first-hand knowledge. These voices, combined with rare and rarely seen film footage, a thoughtful soundtrack and perfectly orchestrated editing are able to give the series (I have screened the first four episodes available at press time) an impactful relevance.""

""... I was grabbed with surprising effectiveness. Those of a younger vintage should find The Sixties a rewarding time trip. This is history told in a most intelligent, visceral and effective fashion.""

""...Generals and politicians are heard lying, LBJ is seen tormented, mothers weep. Much of what happens in this hour echoes in our countrys current conflicts: Do we never learn from the past?""

6500181,5,B00LSVIY26,Excellent review of the 60's.  Good for anyone that lived it or wants to know what it was like living it.,1432857600,,105,4.0
6500182,5,B00LSVIY26,"There is no doubt that the 1960's is probably the most historical, and turbulent, decade in the history of the United States since the 1860's. For those of us who lived through those years from 1960 to 1969 it almost seemed like every time you turned around something else was going on that was making news. Wars, assassinations and protests, it was all happening and at many times all at once. The decade started out with hope and inspiration with the presidential election in November of 1960 of John Kennedy. His youth and dashing looks along with his wife Jackie gave a feeling that all was going to be alright. That the future promised unlimited potential and all of the fightings and injustice and ignorance that the country had gone through during the previous decades of the 20th century would fade away to a bright tomorrow.

Of course that wouldn't happen. It would all come apart on that fateful day in Dallas in November 1963. Things would spiral it seemed out of control from there. Politically and culturally the country, as well as the rest of the world, would scatter off in different directions. Factions were formed and lines were drawn between conservatives and liberals. The establishment and hippies. Blacks and whites. Hawks and doves. Sometimes for the good, sometimes for the bad. But through it all the 1960's was certainly not a decade that could be described as boring or uneventful in American and world history. And those of us old enough to remember all that was taking place witnessed history in the making.

The CNN series ""The Sixties"" was an excellent look back at that ten years and those infamous moments that would occur and the events that caused those moments to occur. Co-produced by Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman it is a 10 part series with a complete look at the most major events that took place. Each one of those episodes looks at a specific point during that decade. There is one episode that looks at the assassination on President Kennedy. Another looks at the Cuban Missile Crisis and just how close we came to having a World War III. Of course no look back at the 1960's would be complete without covering the Vietnam War and the Civil Rights Movement. Both of those issues have their own episode dealing with that subject and both are very well told.

But not all of these episodes deal with such heavy subject matter. ""The Sixties"" along with looking at the political moments shines the spotlight on the more cultural situations that would take place that would also play an important part in defining the 1960's as well. There is one program that deals with the British invasion that began when four lads from Liverpool came to America and appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show. It put in motion a change in popular music that wouldn't just change the music we would listen to but would effect our fashion and appearance and social behavior. Another program looks at television in the '60s and how the events that were occurring during that time was effecting what we watched starting with the first ever televised presidential debates to how television news would change after that fateful day in Dallas in 1963 to how shows like comedies and drama would greatly change from the kind of TV shows America watched in the 1950's to shows that captured the times and attitudes of the '60s. Another is titled ""Sex, Drugs, and Rock n Roll"" which goes into detail about the changing moods of people as they tried to break from what they thought were the constraining rules of the 1950's to a more open lifestyle that would give birth to the hippies and the counter-culture movement. There is one episode in ""The Sixties"" that deals just with the year 1968, certainly the most tumultuous year within the 1960's starting with the Tet Offensive during the Vietnam war that would bring the end to President Lyndon Johnson's presidency to the murders of both Dr. Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy to the presidential election that year that would include the Chicago riots during the Democratic convention to Apollo 8 that would circle the Moon on Christmas Eve sending back to Earth live video of the surface of the Moon while Frank Borman read from the book of Genesis.

If there is one shining moment to that decade however that displayed all that was right in the world it would have to be on July 20, 1969 when man walked on the Moon. One episode from the series deals just with the space race. Born out of the cold war that existed between the United States and the Soviet Union the Soviets fired the first shots that started back in the late 1950's with the launching of Sputnik, the first man made satellite to sending the first man into outer space. The United States would catch up with their own space program that would include a speech made by President Kennedy in 1962 proposing the U.S. send a man to the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth before the decade was out. This episode looks at that space race with all the tragedy and heartbreak as well as the triumph and glory while for one brief moment the entire world stood as one looking up to the sky in wonder.

This is an excellent series that anyone will enjoy watching.  I am certainly glad to see that they released this series on DVD. I have stated in other reviews in the past that I am sort of a history nerd and anyone else who loves learning about history will like this as much as I do. But really anyone who is old enough to have lived through the nineteen sixties will enjoy watching this. There is no doubt in the slightest the viewer will be flooded in memories as they watch all these famous events are retold. For those who were too young or not even born yet this will provide an excellent look back at the history of one of the most important decades of the world. For the young don't look back on all this as ancient history and meaningless to you. This is important for you to know. What took place during this time way back when is still effecting the world today and that includes you! I highly recommend getting this DVD set.",1432684800,13,6062,4.587638376383764

6500200,5,B00LSVIY26,"This is a 3 disc set that runs for about a total of 8  hours. It does have English subtitles but no extras.
There are 10 episodes: Television comes of age, The world on the brink, The assassination of President Kennedy, The war in Vietnam, The British invasion, The space race, 1968, The times they are a-changin', and Sex drugs and rock n roll.

For anyone who lived through this time period these will be a definite true to life and accurate reminder and of course for those who are too young they will give a taste of what life was like then.

What it shows especially when one looks at the beginning and then end was how much life and attitudes had changed. Television affected many of those changes and that is what is shown through film clips, interviews and news reports.
There are good reports showing the conflicting reports regarding Kennedy's assassination, both on that day and afterwards. Also included are tapes of Lyndon Johnson ""persuading"" others to be part of the Warren Commission.

One can see and even relive so many events of the 60's. It is all there from family and social life, political problems and unrest to the TV shows we watched and the clothes we wore.",1425772800,17,1184,4.570754716981132
6500201,5,B00LSVIY26,"This DVD consists of the 10 episode series that was a CNN Original Series in 2014. I don't have cable so I never saw it before but - honestly - this is the way to see it. CNN has commercials and - based on the 45 minutes that each episode runs on the DVD - that means there were 15 minutes of commercials when aired! They did leave in the ""go to commercial break "" section but that's no problem.

There have been MANY documentary series on the 1960s - and PBS (which is distributing this DVD) did one called ""1968"" last year. That was the most important year of the decade and one of the ten episodes of THE SIXTIES is titled just that: ""1968"". Other episodes concentrate on the space program, women's liberation, the assassination of JFK, and the Hippie culture and San Francisco.

What makes this series unique is the choice of clips and commentators. Lots of new interviews with News Anchors are here. (Anyone else wonder what happened to NBC's Sandor Vanocur? He's here). An an example of unique clips is the ""Sex, Drugs and Rock n Roll"" episode that closes the set. There is great footage of Jack Kerouac reading his poetry on the Steve Allen Show with Allen playing piano to accompany him. Then actor Peter Coyote (who narrates many of Ken Burns' documentaries) gets a lot of face time discussing Haight Ashbury and we learn that he was a co-founder of the Free Store in San Francisco and very involved in the ""hippie"" movement. (Who knew?)

The series was co-executive produced by actor Tom Hanks which gave it a lot of cred. It was produced by his Playtone studio.

This is the kind of DVD that every person who lived through the 1960s will want to see and it should be in every school video library. It's that good!

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
