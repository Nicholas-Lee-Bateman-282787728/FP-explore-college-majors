I just came across this DVD at a store used and decided to get it since I like Max B. it is one of those Hoodz type video magazine things so why not, I have bought some of those before like the Scarface one about Lil Troy. I noticed it came out in 2006 after I bought it so I was sure I knew about most of the stuff that would be on here. Luckily I had not heard about this Boston Troy aka Sammy the Bull who turned on a childhood friend who was a crooked cop in order to avoid jail time. That of course was an interesting story on this DVD. I also enjoyed the interview with Max B, this was during his time with Jim Jones before all their beef. There is also a thing about Slick Pulla, a rapper put on by Young Jeezy and a few other things. Over all it is a decent hood video, a straight documentary on Boston Troy and his involvement in the takedown of some crooked cops in Boston would be excellent, maybe there is one, I need to find out.",1463011200,,955,3.8974358974358974
