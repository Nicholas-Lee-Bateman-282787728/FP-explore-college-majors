752023,4,6303920152,"This is a delightful Christmas special. Not only is Freddy full of comical wit, but he also emphasizes thinking of others at Christmas. There is something very poetic in how he ends up giving all of his Christmas dinner money away to benefit others, and then someone not only buys a Christmas dinner for him, but for his friends as well. Vincent Price does not enter until the 2nd half, but once he does, we are exposed to twice as much comedy. These two make a memorable team. The photography is well done, and the music is clever. Even characters like the drunk Santa who only have minor roles seem to make the most of them. If you have an hour to spare between Christmas preperations, this is one of the nicest ways to spend it.",974505600,27,731,4.382352941176471

752025,5,6303920152,"I remember watching this show every Christmas  as a child. It teaches many important lessons in a way that only Red Skeleton can do. I recommend this show to anyone who wants a funny, yet heart-rendering show that will please  audiences of all ages.",944438400,16,249,4.636363636363637
752117,5,6303920152,It arrived in a timely manner and was in perfect condition.  I've already watched it several times.  I watched the original when it aired many years ago.  I only wish it was on dvd.  Very satisified in all ways,1352332800,,210,4.3076923076923075
752118,5,6303920152,I wish this was available on DVD. I've had a tradition of watching this video every New Year's Eve since I was a 9 and I'm 23 now. The video is getting pretty old but the laughs keep going!!! I LOVE Red Skelton and plan on playing this video (VHS!) until it dies. Then I'll buy another one.,1345248000,,290,4.017241379310345
752119,3,6303920152,"There are a few scenes that are hysterical. The drunkin santa selling Christmas trees and the rich old bastard calling Freddie and his crew riff-raff at the restaurant. Outside of that, it's more or less unwatchable.",1325289600,,216,5.027777777777778
752120,5,6303920152,This Red Skeleton video was purchased as a Christmas gift for my 90 year old step-father.  He loved it!  Thanks Amazon for a great gift idea.,1294185600,,141,4.384615384615385
752121,5,6303920152,"Three ten-minute episodes of a half-hour show. Freddy the Freeloader is a very touching scene, that makes you cry. The other two episods are very funny. Zippo Marx is Red Skelton's guest star and him and Skelton are in the trenches of World War I. Both comedians are at their best.",1290038400,,281,4.529411764705882
752122,4,6303920152,"I have this show, and a couple other Red Skelton tapes; but, I have so many more stored in my heart.  I lost the one grandfather that I knew, when I was very young, and thought Red would have filled that void in my life very nicely.  Our family never missed his weekly show (on Tuesday nights as I recall.)  I will never forget the sweet twinkle in his manner as he closed each show with, ""Good Night, and may God bless.""

I saw a rerun of this episode on TV a few years ago, and just had to order it for my collection. Another reviewer said it was low-key, and that's true; but it is so sweet and reflects the best of Christmas spirit. Red Skelton was a true ""gentle"" man.",1272672000,3,673,4.075757575757576
752123,4,6303920152,"I recall my dad loved Red Skelton back in the day, but even when I was a little kid I remember being somewhat put off by the cute sign-offs for his weekly show (the high pitched, overly sincere ""Good-bye for now and may God bless."").  These days I'm a bit more patient--or maybe just plain old nostalgic.  But I did enjoy taking an hour or so this past Christmas Day to watch this old chestnut.

Yes, Skelton traded in whimsical charm, but there's a place for that.  His Freddy the Freeloader was more less of a down-and-outer than a survivor, in that feisty, cartoonish Bugs Bunny kind of way.  An outsider, who's really not hurting all that badly; in fact, he's almost thriving in his ""outsiderness.""

Interestingly, Skelton doesn't totally ignore the seamier sides of homelessness.  Freddy remains something of an innocent throughout, but he does encounter a sweet-natured pickpocket (Imogene Coca) and a surly, drunken Santa whom he gently takes to task.  And he heads off to a Christmas dinner he cannot afford with a down on his luck would-be intellectual nicknamed the Professor (well played by Vincent Price) who he has to bail out of jail before they can proceed to the fancy restaurant where he has (somehow) succeeding in making reservations.

Along the way, there's the almost obligatory stop at a children's ward in the regional hospital, where Freddy is mistaken for a clown (hmm. wonder why!) and does some low key entertaining for the kids.  Actually, ""low key"" is not a bad term for the whole affair.  And therein lies its charm--for some anyway.  I'm not sure if this video, or Red Skelton in general would have much appeal for a generation brough up on brash, off-color and self-consciously ironic comedy.  After all, recall that I was a little skeptical of it even in the 60s.

But I find it a bit refreshing now.  Or maybe it just makes me think of my dad.  Whatever.  It worked for me, this time out.  So, uh, ""Goodbye for now and may God bless.""",1230940800,2,1968,4.655072463768116
752124,5,6303920152,"This is a fabulous film.

I saw it as a child and loved it.

I have just purchased it and I know that my children will love it as much as I did, and will again.

These are the kinds of Christmas classics, that SHOULD be played year after year.",1105574400,6,243,3.82
752125,1,6303920152,"What does Ed Sullivan, a cowboy skit, the 3 Stooges and Red giving out movie awards have to do with Christmas? NOTHING, so why are they included in a DVD called Red Skelton's Christmas Classics?!! The ONLY Christmas in this DVD is the first scene called Freddy and the Yuletide doll from the 1960's. About 20 minutes long. This scene was the heart touching Christmas story that I saw when I was 9. It is about Red as Freddy the Freeloader finding a raggedy ann doll that came to life temporarily after he wished upon a star. It brought back many memories because I hadn't seen it in 40 years. It has a few short Christmas songs in it along with Red's brand of humor and facial expressions; (No dialogue). It really took me back to my childhood when Christmas was about snow, warm holiday music and family. If you want this one particular yuletide skit, buy it because I don't know where else you can get it. Otherwise, 80% of this DVD is NOT Christmas!",1097452800,16,952,4.4147727272727275
