8401611,1,B003ODKZS2,"Father Galeazzo (Franco Aloisi) takes over a small town parish and his attitude upsets his caretaker who quits. The young girls in town swoon over this young priest to the dismay of the men folk. This is supposed to be a sex romp comedy, but fails on all accounts. You have to watch the film with subtitles, plus the transfer was poor. The film not only has lines going through it but is subject to magenta tinting. Save your money.

8401612,1,B003ODKZS2,"This movie actually has the potential to be fun and entertaining, there is just one problem.  It has been badly butchered.  I never saw the original but you can tell scenes have been cut out of the movie and sadly those are the ones you buy a movie like this for.  What are these rocket scientist thinking when they transfer a film from VHS to DVD that they need to do surgery on it?  The word ""idiots"" comes to mind.  Do not waste your money on this product.  It is of a very poor quality and badly chopped.",1292284800,11,508,4.13265306122449
