8155935,4,B000KEP6ZK,"An acquaintance of mine recommended this film when we were trying to define 'Beat' as in beatnik type beat (ie. not as authentic as Kerouac type Beat but still fun...)he said:  ""But don't get fooled by Beat - a very un-Beat movie starring Keifer the reefer and Courtney the Love chile.  My suggestion is you check out Surf 2, instead (there is no Surf 1) - one of the most Beat movies ever made.""  So is there any chance of releasing this cult film on DVD so that I can afford it and see?",1283731200,,488,4.170212765957447
8155936,4,B000KEP6ZK,"I saw this about 15 years ago, I think, but my head is full of saltwater.
Eddie Deezen's best role.  Some suprisingly experimental shots.  Lots of T&A, gratuitously thrown in your face (literally, bouncing boobs.)  This odd jiggle comedy has a lot going for it for a jiggle comedy.",1191628800,7,281,4.6938775510204085
