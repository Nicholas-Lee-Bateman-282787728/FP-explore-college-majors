8304842,5,B001GBZEDA,"This is the best Miles Davis DVD I've seen. Miles plays cool stuff and gives his band plenty of room to stretch out. The sound is very good and the video editing is well done too. This is a period of Miles' music I really like--simple grooves and quirky melodies.

It's great to see a young Daryl Jones and Al Foster playing so tight. John Scofield is amazing. What a confident band!

This disc is a must-have for any Miles Davis fan.",1339718400,2,434,4.280487804878049
8304843,5,B001GBZEDA,"this is one of miles davis best 80s touring bands giving one a chance to hear him before the pop influences of his later 80s bands .the band features john scofield , darryl jones, minu cinelu, bill evans , al foster and bobby irving. the centerpiece of this set are 3 potent distillations of the blues, played with a conviction not always heard in davis, later 80s bands. it has been said that in order to end up in one of davis,s
touring bands, one had better be able to defend themselves musically on a blues track. the tracks , ""star people"", it gets better"" and ""thats right"" stay in your head long after being heard. set also includes an excellent version onf hopscotch with great minu cinelu solo and excellent versions of ""star on cicely"", ""speak"", and ""code md"". this tour was recorded during davis' ""bad hair"" period when it seemed like the music was more important than perfect hair curls.. possibly due cicely tysons influence to lead a healthier lifestyle. this is a 27year old concert that ranks with davis' best electric recordings",1317427200,4,1045,4.654054054054054
8304844,5,B001GBZEDA,"Great concert filmed by Polish National TV in Warsaw, Poland on October 23rd, 1983 (Sunday) in Congress Hall and also transmitted live via Polish Radio, which I tapped!
It was a Jazz Jamboree's 25th Anniversary and Miles Davis was the biggest star invited to celebrate this occasion.
There is a mistake with the date of the concert.  I bought CD & now DVD from this concert and on both is October 13, 1983 listed, but should be October 23rd.  Announcement was done by Andrzej Jaroszewski - a long time music journalist and a member of Polish Jazz Society.
Music played by Miles & band was from ""Star People"", ""Decoy"" and ""We Want Miles!""
The Band: Bill Evans, John Scofield, Robert Irving III, Darryl Jones, Al Foster, Mino Cinelu.
Highly recommended! Enjoy!",1277683200,14,758,4.778625954198473
