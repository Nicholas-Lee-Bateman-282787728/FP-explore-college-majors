This film is different from the average B Western in its complex plot. It does not have the shooting and crimes in most westerns. It has a message about gambling and the harm it can cause. What if that roulette wheel was rigged by Scoville? Most gambling games are designed to benefit the house on average. Generally speaking, the longer the legs the faster the animal can run. A dromedary camel should be faster than any horse; but few things are guaranteed in life. In the real world the use of horses in agriculture and to power wagons began their decline after WW II ended.",1510531200,,2757,4.410609037328094
