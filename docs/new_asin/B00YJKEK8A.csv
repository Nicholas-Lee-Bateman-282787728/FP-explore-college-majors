7222978,5,B00YJKEK8A,Surprised my kids with this movie. They we so excited and loved it. I loved that it came with a ultraviolet code so my boys can also watch it on their iPads.. PERFECT!!!,1440979200,,169,4.151515151515151

7222980,4,B00YJKEK8A,"This is a wonderful movie for the youngest of the Lego fan.

I loved the Lego movie and some of the DC and Star Wars shorts that Lego has done.

All the movies share a certain charm and cheesy quality that appeals to both kids and adults.

This one though is really just a movie for kids.  The scene where Luthor and gang are picking out the members of the Doom squad was aimed squarely at the 5-6 year old crowd.

There were no plot surprises.

Great movie for the kids, but you might want to balance the checkbook or make dinner while this one is playing.",1440892800,2,557,4.158878504672897
7222981,1,B00YJKEK8A,This whole movie is a dumbed down version of dc comics great characters. It's a slap in the face to true dc comics fans. This is the reason comic books are not taken seriously by most people. The story has been done before. Also why does anyone like Martian manhunter? He's boring,1440720000,,280,4.403846153846154
7222982,5,B00YJKEK8A,"Another wonderful Justice League adventure, featuring our most favorite heroes.  While the movie starts with the exploits of numerous Justice League members, the main movie centers around Batman, Superman, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, Flash, and Cyborg, who is trying to establish is roe in the team.  (I must say, I'm sad not to much or any action out of Aquaman or Green Arrow).  The team squares off against the Legion of Doom (quickly distilled down to only a handful of villains via a creative selection process)

The movie plot is straight-forward, without being too boring.  The introduction of Martian Manhunter is interesting, and how he interacts with the League in the beginning.

Because this being a LEGO-theme movie, you will see  numerous vehicles from the Lego DC Hero kits that are already on the store shelves (even the inexplicable Batman robot).  But at least my son was excited when he saw the JL ship (Javelin) on screen, ""Daddy, I have that plane! Look!)

Its a great, safe film that has plenty of the classic Lego humor we have come to expect from the movies and games.",1440633600,5,1093,4.833333333333333
7222983,5,B00YJKEK8A,My 5 year old super hero  lego lover loves this movie!  He was cackling during several parts.  Thank you for making movies that kids and adults can enjoy together!!!  There are too few superhero shows/movies that I can let my son watch without worrying about what he will see or hear.,1440547200,6,284,4.509803921568627
7222984,3,B00YJKEK8A,"I was hoping for some of the genius that went into the LEGO Movie, but this is more like a well-animated Saturday morning cartoon.",1440460800,,130,4.458333333333333
7222985,5,B00YJKEK8A,"Its been a few months since we last saw the Justice League in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LEGO-DC-Comics-Super-Heroes-Justice-League-vs-Bizarro-League-Blu-ray-DVD-Digital-HD-UltraViolet-Combo-Pack/dp/B00OQRUB70/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LEGO: DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League vs. Bizarro League (Blu-ray+DVD+Digital HD UltraViolet Combo Pack)</a>&nbsp;and things are going well.  Our heroes are continually embarrassing the villains.  Thats when Lex Luthor hatches his plan to form a legion, a legion of DOOM (cue maniacal laughing.)  Its soon revealed that this is not Luthors plan, but Darkseids.  He intends to conquer the earth and needs the villains to do his dirty work.  There are a few twists and turns and a surprise character introduction in the second act which was fun and crucial to the plot.
We get many of the same characters weve seen before and this time Cyborg takes center stage, hungry for acceptance and the only one who can see through the mind tricks pulled on the League later in the film.  The Trickster makes a welcome appearance early in the movie with Mark Hamill returning to the role he first played on the 1990 Flash tv show.  This is really one of the shining moments of the movie and I wished that character had been in it more or at least returned at the end.
As with other Lego movies there are in jokes for the grown ups and enough humor for the kids as well.  Watch for a Batusi and a few new 52 jokes.  The voices are solid and the animation extremely well done.  At 77 minutes its not too long, but I did feel the pace drag at times.  The Bizarro release was a brisk 49 minutes by comparison.
There are just a few extras on the disc.  Two trailers, one for Batman Unlimited and another for Lego DC Comics Superheroes: Justice League vs. Bizarro League, and Click, Zap, Boom! Creating the Sound Design.  If you're curious about how all those noises are made to fill every moment, then this is 20 minutes well spent.  Additionally there are the usual subtitles, language choices, and scene selections.
Bonus points for the very cool Trickster mini figure included in this edition.",1440460800,9,2171,5.1833810888252145

7222987,3,B00YJKEK8A,"After the previous LEGO DC Comics films, this one is a bit of a disappointment. It's not as funny and the characters are a bit annoying. Most of the characters are jerks and thus bad role models for kids- especially Flash (I get that Hal Jordan is a jerk, but this Flash acts more like Wally West than Barry Allen). The movie does have some cute moments and LEGO Deathstroke is pretty awesome though and probably deserves his own film. Sadly his appearance is all too brief to satisfy his growing fan base.

The big star of the movie? CYBORG! It's cool to Cyborg in such a large role while retaining his Teen Titans personality (unlike Flashpoint where he is definitely a Grown Up Titan- also a great story, but very different from LEGO Justice League: Attack of the Legion of Doom)

If you like Superman, this movie might even offend you. For some reason, Superman can't grasp the concept of a 'high five' in this movie. Seriously? The dude grew up in Kansas. I haven't spent much time in Kansas, but I'm pretty sure that its residents are as familiar with the high five as anyone else in the world. Overall, Superman is portrayed as an out-of-his-element idiot like a caveman waking up from a coma frost.",1440374400,2,1206,4.527522935779817

7223024,3,B00YJKEK8A,"This made-for-video movie was intended to be a follow-up to the Justice League Vs. Bizarro League animated movie, but a prelude to the Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham video game. It is a little unique as at is a full-length production as opposed to be the length of a TV special or standard OVA.

 The Justice League elects Batman as the temporary leader of the League(similar to the Justice Society having a rotating chairperson), and for some reason Hal Jordan is back as Green Lantern instead of Guy Gardner. After Trickster manages to hit Metropolis with a huge stink bomb, the League get some new duds since their old one stank. Meanwhile, Lex Luthor, Sinestro, and Black Manta decide to put together their own anti-Justice League group of villains called the Legion of Doom, although Luthor is secretly working with Darkseid to take over the planet. They hold Legion auditions, but knock out most of Batman's enemies since they get shown enough in the Lego games, plus Deathstroke is passed since he makes everyone else look like losers. Along with a few other baddies like Capt. Cold, Grodd, and Cheetah, the full Legion raids Area 52(the one after Area 51)for a Martian being kept there, and convince the Martian Manhunter that they're the good guys. They use MM's mental powers to make it look like the League wrecked a power plant, and get exiled from Earth. Cyborg however stays behind and deduces that they were all duped by Martian Manhunter, and convinces him to take over Sinestro's mind to bring the League back. The Legion meanwhile have launched their headquarters into attacking Metropolis, but Cyborg reveals that the Hall of Justice is also a flying fortress(because you really want your local superhero team to have a mobile sky building that shoots missiles!), and defeat the Legion by clearing their names. Darkseid then refuses to bust Luthor out of jail, and realizes he has to team up with Brainiac to get the job done.

Attack Of The Legion Of Doom made for a fair outing in the ""Legoverse"" established in the Lego Batman video games. The most impressive part in it is the recurring voice cast. Mark Hamill replays both Joker and Trickster as well as Sinestro, Troy Baker switches roles as Joker for Batman, John DiMaggio who also played Joker once is Lex Luthor, and former Joker from The Batman: Kevin Michael Richardson replays Black Manta plus Grodd and Captain Cold. It's enjoyable at least for fans of the old Super Friends show, and makes a good watch for kids.",1450483200,,2493,4.793023255813954

7223061,4,B00YJKEK8A,"I love anything LEGOLEGO sets, LEGO video games, and now of course we have LEGO movies, the latest of which is Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League: Attack of the Legion of Doom.  And yes, that is quite a mouthful!  Like the videogames, LEGO animated are always filled with wit and lively characters that put many live action films to shame.attack 3

Justice League: Attack of the Legion of Doom is set in the early days of the Justice League, just after the team is formed.  The JLAs villains, knowing that none of them can individually take on the league, decide to start their own team.  Led by Lex Luthor, they hold tryouts for other villains, challenging them to complete a wickedly fun and slapstick obstacle course.  Now, Luthor, Black Manta, Cheeta, Sinestro, Gorilla Grodd, and Captain Cold join forces to form the Legion of Doom.  However, little does the rest of the team know that behind the scenes Darkseid is actually in control and pulling the strings of Luthor.

The attack a secret government installation known as Area 51 because it is not the old 51 but the New 52, get it?  The film is filled with little inside jokes like that which makes it perfect not only for kids but for adult comic book fans as well.  They steal a capsule containing the imprisoned Martian Jonn Jonzz.  Luthor convinces Jonn that the JLA is evil and enlists his aid to defeat them.  In their darkest hour the League finds themselves branded as outlaws and has to save the Earth and their reputations and stop The Legion of Doom.

If youve played the LEGO videogames, particularly those featuring the DC Comics superheroes, there is simply no way you are not going to enjoy this movie.  It is part animated feature and part videogame come to life.  It features many of the elements that make the games so fun such as the block building action and crazy gadgets that would make any mad scientist drool with envy.  And the many sound effects that you are familiar with from the games are incorporated into the action.  The action is wild as hero battles villain throughout the government facility, power plant, and on the city streets with dazzling and often side-splitting special effects.

But all of this would be mere window dressing if it were not for the fabulous characters.  The LEGO versions are tongue-in-cheek caricatures of their comic book versions.  Superman is extra goody two-shoes Batman is especially grumpy; The Flash is obnoxiously enthusiastic; and Green Lantern is extra, ummdouche baggy.  The interplay between the characters keeps things humming along in spirited fashion.  Green Lantern and the Flash engage in a juvenile game of trying to outdo each other, all to try and impress Wonder Woman.

attack 2

The voice-acting is provided by some of the stalwarts of the animation and videogame industries including Nolan North (Batman), John DiMaggio (Lex Luthor),  Troy Baker (Batman), Nolan North (Superman), and Josh Keaton (Green Lantern).  They are joined by Mark Hamill (Trickster and Sinestro) and Tony Todd (Darkseid).

Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League: Attack of the Legion of Doom has a long title but it is also long on laughs and fun.  The Blu-Ray even comes packed with an exclusive LEGO collectible figure.
