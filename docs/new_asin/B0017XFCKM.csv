8267701,5,B0017XFCKM,"""The Usual Suspects"" Korean style, and Agatha Christie must be cheering from heaven!  Slick storytelling, but simple to follow with flashbacks & subtitles.  I saw this 3x to see who they dunnit, & the mystery of who ""X"" is is solvable (the filmmakers ""play fair,"" as Agatha Christie always did).  If you're a sharp-eyed viewer who's been paying attention, you'll figure it out.  I figured it out, then dismissed it, but was right.  Will you be better...?  You'll love this if you liked ""The Usual Suspects.""  See it!!  :-)",1427500800,,522,4.786516853932584
8267702,4,B0017XFCKM,"Puzzle is the latest in a series of Korean films I've been watching. I'm still getting used to the aesthetic of Korean storytelling and and learning to like it in itself instead of in comparison to American film making, which I'm certainly more familiar with.

Puzzle is an interesting film. It uses non-linear storytelling to push the story further. Like the name on the outside it gives you a picture, then inside it gives you smaller pictures that you must fit together to make the larger picture. It's ambitious in it's presentation if reminiscent of other films that use the same format. The first movie that comes to mind, and is an honest comparison, is The Usual Suspects. At first it wasn't clear to me that the additional scenes were indeed flashbacks. After I deciphered what was going on it made the movie a lot easier to understand. All the pieces fit into the greater tapestry of the story well enough and the ending should come as a surprise to most. I figured it out, then dismissed it, the reconsidered and it turned out I was right. A fair amount of guess work, misdirection and some solid acting and you have a solid caper film.",1313193600,3,1147,4.595121951219512
