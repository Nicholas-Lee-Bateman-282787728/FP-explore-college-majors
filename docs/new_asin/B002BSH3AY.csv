4690640,5,B002BSH3AY,"When this originally aired, my mom would walk in the room, roll her eyes, say, ""Oh, it's the blonde show,"" and walk out. Different generations, different tastes. I accept your judgement Mother and still feel I lead a full life. Lest you worry, dear reader, my mother and I have a perfectly harmonious relationship, so long as I keep this ""blonde show"" and Gilmore Girls off the screens when I visit.

This show is pure, substance free fun full of lots of laughs, deserved and not so much.",1428019200,,488,4.545454545454546

4690644,5,B002BSH3AY,"This would be great for Prime instant video. This really would be my deal breaker for continuing the subscription. I do get better shows here on Prime than Netflix, and would love to stay. But I'm dying for this show. It's fun, sweet, cheesy and I grew up watching it right after school. Bring it to instant video please!!!",1372291200,9,323,4.491525423728813
