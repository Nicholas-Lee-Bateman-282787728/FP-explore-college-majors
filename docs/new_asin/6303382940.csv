638416,5,6303382940,"An excellent film! This takes place at Fort Pitt(when Pittsburgh was a frontier town)in 1763 during Pontiac's War(a by-product of The French & Indian War).With a budget of 5 million dollars,DeMille puts a very good story together that is based on Neil Swanson's book ""The Judas Tree"".It is also the first time that I've seen the subject of indentured servitude addressed on film. The viewer also gets to see an appearance of the 42nd Royal Highland Regiment(BlackWatch)and how they saved Fort Pitt. I would have liked to have seen more action,but the fighting scenes are adequate enough.",1066953600,32,587,5.061855670103093
638417,4,6303382940,"Abby Hale (Paulette Goddard), a pretty English convict girl, is ordered deported as a potential slave to the American Colonies.  Captain Holden (Gary Cooper) saves her from being auctioned off into slavery, and when she's captured by Indians and subjected to a slow and tortuous death, Holden appears in a flash of gunpowder smoke convincing the Indians that he's a god, so they relinquish Abby to him................THE UNCONQUERED was DeMille's 5 million dollar Technicolored celebration of Cooper's virility and Goddard's femininity and the American Frontier Spirit.  Spectacularly stirring and full of fine action scenes, DeMille again screen-vitalised a chapter out of American history.  One may say that he supplied both a boistrous and sensational delineation of the frontiersman's era with the full complement of DeMille devices, even to the famed bath sequence, a dip into the serial thrillers when the hero and heroine shoot the rapids to the the edge of a waterfall, and the staging of the battle of Fort Pitt that far outdoes any conflict that was ever dreamt up for a World's Fair carnival!",1006128000,62,1103,5.220338983050848
638418,1,6303382940,"and shut this movie off, even though I probably was THIS close to the end, because I just couldn't stand it anymore! Totally bad.
Paulette Goddard is having a hard time as an indentured servant in a frontiersy New World, even with Gary Cooper around. But how can this be in any way exciting when the villain is....Howard Da Silva??? Oh, c'mon, who was he, the understudy to the real star cast?
Some things are best left alone, and ""Unconquered"" is one of them.",999216000,7,460,4.488095238095238
638419,5,6303382940,"This was a mammoth production from director Cecil B. De Mille set in colonial America. The colonists confront Indians with a lot of gimmickry and daring-do. It is all based on the novel ""The Judas Tree"" by Neil H. Swanson and scripted by Charles Bennett, Fredric M. Frank and Jesse Lasky Jr. Gary Cooper as Capt. Christopher Holden once again gives a solid performance as the stoic yet homespun hero. Boris Karloff is over-the-top as the Indian Guyasuta. The amiable Paulette Goddard is good as Abigail Martha ""Abby"" Hale. Great action fight scenes punctuate this film. The moody woodland color images are the product of Technicolor pioneer Cinematographer Ray Rennahan. Composer Victor Young composed a rousing yet lyrical score. This film is pure entertainment and good old-fashioned moviemaking. It also starred Howard da Silva, Ward Bond, Cecil Kellaway, Henry Wilcoxon, Alan Napier, Marc Lawrence, Lloyd Bridges, Lex Barker, and Jeff Corey. The first-rate special effects were nominated for an Oscar.",991872000,135,1005,5.2875
638420,4,6303382940,"Made during the golden age of Hollywood, this is an excellent historical drama that takes place during the French-Indian War with Gary Cooper in the lead role as a plantation owner/explorer who falls for an enduntured servant portrayed by Paulette Goddard.
While the story-plot is ficticious, it blends well with the historical saga of the French-Indian War.  The relationship between the French and their Indian allies and the British and the American Colonialists.  The only exception that is kind of far fetched is having Boris Karloff as the evil indian chief, but that can be overlooked since it is the immortal Boris Karloff and his superb acting.
Overall the action, the plot and the technicolor, which was new when this was filmed, makes this a movie that fans of historical drama and action would enjoy.",981763200,15,812,5.007407407407407
638421,5,6303382940,"Unconquered is two-and-a-half hours of non-stop adventure set during the French-and-Indian War. It is also a wonderful love story. Gary Cooper and Paulette Goddard provide the fun with their on-again/off-again romance. It  also has several spectacular set pieces, one of which is now a classic --  when Cooper and Goddard go over the waterfalls in a canoe. What's  interesting about this is that DeMille doesn't simply toss this sequence  in; rather, he sets it up with an earlier sequence in which Cooper stands  under a rock outcrop by the waterfalls and studies an overhanging branch.  The scene seems out of place and without purpose at the moment. But then  comes the canoe and the falls and it all makes sense. This is prime DeMille  hokum. Check it out.",954806400,10,760,4.8828125
638422,5,6303382940,"UNCONQUERED is old-fashined romantic adventure at its best. Yes, it is absurd at times, the plot bordering on the cartoon-like, but it is also ripe old fun. Hair-breadth escapes, a genuine romance, and a surprisingly  close reading of history during the French-and-Indian war in 1763. Gary  Cooper, Paulette Goddard, Cecil B. DeMille, gorgeous technicolor, how can  you go wrong?",953510400,5,379,5.389830508474576

638674,5,6303382940,"Unconquered is an absolute delight to watch and the cast can't get any better than it is.  Each of the players in this gorgeous Technicolor period piece, are at the top of their game in every way and there is one huge surprise that awaits you...Boris Karloff is cast as, Guyasuta - Chief of the Senecas!  Whatever role Karloff plays, you can be certain you won't soon forget him! Gary Cooper plays the handsome Capt. Christopher Holden, the beautiful Paulette Goddard is cast as Abby, the Captain's eventual love interest, and the dastardly Howard da Silva is cast as Garth, a filthy, double dealing businessman who holds nothing sacred save money and power.  Character actors are aplenty in this film and we have time in which to enjoy the abilities of the always wonderful Ward Bond, C. Aubrey Smith, Cecil Kellaway, Virginia  Grey, Henry Wilcoxen, Katherine DeMille and others we know.  After the French & Indian wars the Ohio territory is still a wide open and wild space filled with Indians, frontiersmen and settlers.  Abby is an indentured, bonded slave, who has been shipped from England to serve her time.  She is to be sold at auction but is saved from that fate by Capt. Holden who forces an auction on board ship.  Unbeknownst to Abby, Capt. Holden is off to be married as soon as the ship docks and he leaves her paperwork in the hands of the slave master there!  All is quickly re-arranged by Garth, who lost her to Holden at auction since he hadn't enough cash to pay for her on board ship.  He pays off the slave master and instructs him to lose her Freedom papers upon arrival in the New World, after Holden goes ashore.  He is to hand her over to his man, Bone, played by Mike Mazurki, another thoroughly unagreeable and dislikeable character who runs a tavern in the territory!  Garth covets Abby, wants her for his own and will have her no matter what and he tells her that Holden sold her to him without telling her and his promise to free her has been dashed by the sale!  Cecil Kellaway has all but adopted her while on board ship and stays with her, posing as her father and also working t Bones' tavern. Garth is intent on capturing all the Indian fur trade and is married to Chief Guyasuta's daughter, thereby having a huge advantage over any other white man. He fans the flames of hatred and pushes the Indians toward an uprising with the settlers.  Watch as the real adventures begin and Holden discovers the treachery of Garth in his dealings with Abby and Guyasuta. Unfortunately he is hampered by his orders as a soldier but must find a way to uncover the truth and unmask this villain so he can prove to his superiors what is really afoot there.  This film is well worth including in your classic film library so pick up the DVD...you won't be sorry you did!",1421539200,6,2790,4.52988047808765

Cooper is the hero, trying to make peace with the Indians, before the West goes up in fire and smoke.  He's thwarted by both the bad guys and the British.

639074,3,6303382940,"If Cecil B. DeMille didn't invent cornball rubbish, he certainly became the most accomplished impresario of pure bunkum!  I love this movie.  Gorgeous technicolor, some beautiful location scenery, wonderful production values, and dialogue that makes your teeth ache it is so bad, and an acting style that falls just short of Snidley Whiplash style, mustache twirling melodrama.  Howard DeSilva is delicious.  Paulette Goddard beautiful and looking somewhat lost and miscast.  It's absolutely deprecating and condescending toward the Native Americans with Boris Karloff as the villainous Indian chief for God's Sake!  Priceless.

Somehow the great Gary Cooper manages to survive this by playing it with a straight face.  And oh the wonderful cliches.  The Indians are dumb and dumber, easily tricked by a compass and gunpowder flashes (despite the fact they are toting muskets). The British are all honorable dunderheads.  Thick as bricks.  There seems to be an endless supply of lipstick and eye shadow on the frontier, both for bond slaves and Indian princesses.  The anachronisms in this film, and the flinchingly arcane notions about race and sex and everything else are absolutely blatant and presented with unabashed directness.  This is whitebread history served up to a fare thee well with unconscious, oblivious honesty.

At this point you might assume I am for political correctness and detest this movie.  Far from it, I thoroughly enjoyed this flick in all it's P.T. Barnum over-the-top, crackpot glory.  It is pure nonsense, but it is a lot of fun.  However, if the notions embedded in this film don't strike you as wincingly awkward with their archaic precepts, which were already outdated in 1947 and hark back to the simplistic biases of the pre-Depression, pre-WWII mindset, of an obtuse old showman, than you are able to ignore the elephant in the living room as it were.  Whatever.

Demille's team gets a lot of the details of clothes and equipment right.  And, as always, some of DeMille's set pieces look like glorious paintings in motion.  And again, there was nothing quite like Technicolor.  So, if you can get past the groaningly trite dialogue, the ham acting, and the sometimes contemptible concepts underlying the picture, you can enjoy it for the epic production values and as a quaint product from a different time and place.

DeMille was a crowd pleaser and his productions were lavish for the time, so there is cinematic value in the film, and it can be enjoyed simply on that level.  But that it was the product of a man and a director losing touch with his times was impossible for me to ignore.  If the old boy had made this in the 20's and 30's it would have been more understandable, though no less disconcerting.  At any rate, it is a hoot (on many levels)!  And I haven't even mentioned the waterfall stunt, which apparently caused even 1947 audiences to howl!  It is marvelous kitsch.",1300320000,6,2923,4.983471074380165
639075,5,6303382940,"Like his earlier movie 'The Plainsman' De Mille was able in 'The Unconquered' to magnificently bring us back to the American frontier, this time to colonial America.

I saw this movie first 50 years ago and to this day I remember a voice over towards the end of the movie saying something like this: 'They were unconquered because they were pioneers', what a patriotic statement.

If you are Abby, you look up at the judge.  He dryly pronounces sentence for your crime: death!  But then, as you are about to be led off, he adds: or, you may go to the colonies as an indentured servant ... you choose slavery.

In the spring of 1763, your voyage to the Virginia colony is almost over when an ogre of a man, named Garth, lustily demands the slave master sell you to him before you arrive at Norfolk.  But rules-are-rules, indentured slaves must be sold at auction.  Garth opens with an extremely low bid - assuming no one will bid against him; he is wrong.

A man, playing a game of darts, begins topping each of Garth's bids by a paltry six pence.  With each new bid, Garth becomes more and more agitated.  So much so, that Garth throws a tomahawk into their dartboard.  Undeterred, Captain Holden outbids Garth; Holden has bought you.  You hope he isn't married!

At the landing, you are packed and ready to go, but then Captain Holden tells you, you are free; suddenly, you don't want to be free.  He did it only to thwart Garth, calling him a snake; later, Garth calls Holden a joker.  Garth gloats that you are not free; Mr. Bone has bought you!

Garth and Bone take you west of the Allegheny Mountains to Pittsburgh.  Nearby, Fort Pitt overlooks the joining of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers to form the Ohio river.  The soldiers are preparing to celebrate King George the Third's 25th birthday; the indians are preparing to bring down a rain of red arrows ...

639140,5,6303382940,"Unconquered is set in colonial America several years before the American Revolution. Directed by Cecil B. DeMille, it's one of his many epic, spectacular films. DeMille had a knack of creating films that felt grandiose & were major events. Unconquered still stands as one of the best photographed movies in Hollywood history.

The film opens with Abigail Hale (Paulette Goddard in her third DeMille film) on trial in England. She's sentenced to death for murder but is given a choice of accepting 14 years servitude in America. She accepts (duh) the offer. While crossing the Atlantic the other two main characters are introduced: Capt. Chris Holden (Gary Cooper in his fourth DeMille film) & Martin Garth (Howard Da Silva). The conflict is set early as Holden & Garth get in a bidding war over Abigail. Every time Garth makes a bid Holden says, ""... And sixpence."" Holden wins out & sets Abigail free but Garth destroys her papers & buys her, keeping her in slavery.

Garth is friendly with many Indians west of the Appalachians. It's not so much friendship as it is the weapons that he's selling to them. He has secretly created an alliance with them to carve out a territory for himself.

There's a bit of name dropping for historical buffs. There's much that centers on the village/fort of Pittsburgh. There's debate on whether Pittsburgh belongs to Virginia or to Pennsylvania. In order to resolve this dispute we get two surveyors: Mason & Dixon, though their roles are limited to one scene. Another name dropped is that of a young Colonel George Washington (Richard Gaines).

John Fraser (Ward Bond) is Holden's good friend &, once again, Bond gives an excellent performance. Hannah (Katherine DeMille) is the Indian wife of Garth & daughter of Guyasuta (Boris Karloff). Guyasuta is the chief of the Senecas, one of the principal tribes involved in Garth's plot. Pontiac is the main chief in this plot though there's no screen appearance.
Note: Katherine DeMille was the daughter of Cecil DeMille & at the time was Mrs. Anthony Quinn.

There's a lot of action in the film with the inevitable confrontation between Holden & Garth. The Indians are treacherous & want to eliminate the white man from their lands. Part of this film is near ludicrous & yet enjoyable. Karloff is credible as Guyasuta yet is hard to take in this role.

There are a lot of actors in this movie that were young & had futures of varying degrees. There are Lloyd Bridges (Lt. Hutchins), Lex Barker, Jay Silverheels (Tonto from the Lone Ranger) & Jeff York. There are some others that were reasonably established: Mike Mazurki (Dave Bone), Garth's main henchman, Cecil Kellaway (Jeremy Love), Alan Napier (Sir William Johnson) & C. Aubrey Smith (Lord Chief Justice). There are many Native Americans with roles in this film also that include Iron Eyes Cody in a non-speaking role ( also was responsible for the Native American dialog in the film), Chief Thundercloud along with Silverheels.

Another interesting tidbit is the film has Noble Johnson in a small part. Noble was, perhaps, most famous for his portrayal of a zombie in The Ghost Breakers (Bob Hope & Paulette Goddard).

The only bonus feature is an introduction by Robert Osborne. There are subtitles in English & French; & the movie is presented in the full screen format (1:33 to 1). Unconquered is a highly enjoyable & entertaining movie that just misses being an essential film.",1228608000,4,3422,4.887931034482759

Peronally, I love movies, especially the ones from the 30's and 40's  when the studio system was in full swing. This movie has one of the great directors of all time C.B. De Mille and and some of the Great screen personalities of all time. Action, adventure, patriotism, a great story, a great director, Gary Cooper, Paulette Goddard AND Boris Karloff as the indian villan .... a great movie..... what more could you ask for ?",1201392000,,584,4.561904761904762

He made them in BW or in color for almost every imaginable historical period from Biblical times through era of the emerging USA...with plotlines and characters that were almost interchangable, nothwithstanding the era...and everyone of them is about as entertaing a 2-3 hours as you could ask for.

Unconquered is a particularly entertaining entry in his oeuvre.  It covers a period not often visited by Hollywood, pre-Revolutionary War America, and is loaded with a colorful cast of characters played by actors famous (Gary Cooper, Boris Karloff) and familiar but not so famous (Cecil Kellaway, Henry Wilcoxon, Mike Mazurki and the ever oily and improbable main villain, Howard de Silva).  Best of all,  Paulette Goddard, one of the most beautiful women ever to walk onto a movie set, and she is never lovelier than here.

You get all these great and near great actors, DeMille's always breathtaking color photography and an interesting and exciting story.

The characters are, of course, complretely stereotyped and the ending never in doubt, but with DeMille, that's never the point...it's the journey, not the arrival.

639200,5,6303382940,"This is an old-fashioned Western (although the West was a lot further East than in the classic genre!).  The cast includes some stars near the end of their careers--Paulette Goddard (as the indentured servant Abby Hale) and Gary Cooper (as Captain Chris Holden), and others of varying degrees of fame (Boris Karloff as an Indian Chief, Howard DaSilva as the villain Garth, Catherine DeMille as Karloff's daughter--married to Garth, and so on.  Many solid character actors show up throughout.  It's fun to watch out for them and recognize them.

The story begins with Holden freeing Hale after having bought her from Garth (who, upon arriving in western Pennsylvania, returns her to servitude; something of a churl, one might say!).  Later, Captain Holden heads west on a mission of peace, to try to stop the violence between Indians and settlers.

He and Hale come together again, go through a series of adventures, and recognize the valor of the settlers.  In a well constructed rescue mission, Holden saves the fort from certain destruction at the hands of the Indians by a ruse that is clever--and emotionally touching.

And, of course, the dnouement where Garth and cronies get theirs.

Cecil B. DeMille made this movie for a lot of money for the time--$5 million. It's a rollicking adventure story and still fun to watch.  Obviously, cinematic values have changed, and this has an old-fashioned look to it. It also features stereotypical views of native Americans.  All in all, though, an enjoyable experience.",1185667200,4,1515,5.044176706827309
639211,5,6303382940,This Gary Cooper movie has been one of my favorites for years. Everytime it would show up on TV I would try to be home to see it.

I have watched it three time in the past month with three of my friends who had never seen it. It is a great fav with all of them.,1184198400,3,383,3.6265060240963853
639212,4,6303382940,"I love this film.  This one had an impact on me when I was just a boy and saw it in B&W on TV.  I used recreate the after-math of the masacre at the fort with my toy soldiers.  Sure the story line stretches plausibility a bit (Catching the limb while going over the falls with Paulette Goddard hanging on your neck is a bit much even for Coop!) but not nearly so much as the things I am asked to accept as reality in modern CGI movies (as in any sequence in the latest remake of King Kong.)

I have to love Boris Karloff as an Indian chief and Miss Goddard as the indentured slave as well as Gary Cooper as an early American freedom fighter.  The DeMille touches in the battle scenes and the ""almost historical"" feel of the film are pleasures as well.

Put this one on the shelf with ""Last of the Mohicans,"" (when will we get the version from the 30's?)""Drums Along the Mohawk"" and ""Allegheny Uprising"" for entertaining films of pre-revolutionary American ""almost history"" and enjoy.",1183420800,7,983,4.373626373626373

Paulette Goddard is delicious.,1182297600,6,340,4.928571428571429
639214,5,6303382940,"""Unconquered"" is a great historical epic set in pre-Revolutionary America with a ""fight the enemy and never surrender"" message. Gary Cooper owns the film. When he is on the screen, as is usually the case with his flicks, all the other characters revolve around him.

Cooper plays Captain Holden who is sent on a doomed mission to make peace with Indian tribes that have already decided on war. Holden's main nemesis is a traitor named ""Garth"" (played by Howard DaSilva) who has not only provided arms to the natives, but who is also secretly in league with them.

The romantic sub-plot involves an indentured servant, Abby Hale (played by Paulette Goddard), who is bought and freed by Holden only to be illegally re-enslaved by Garth. Both Holden and Garth are enamoured of Miss Hale, but you can easily guess which one of the two she loves back.

""Unconquered"" exudes good old fashioned conservative American values and, partly for that reason, they don't make movies like this today.

Another reason you won't see a film like this today is because of it's politically incorrect portrayal of Native Americans. American Indians did torture, murder and sometimes even cannibalize settlers, including women, children and infants, but, today, Hollywood is unwilling to portray them as having been anything other than noble, peace-loving ecologists.

This DVD even has an ""Introduction"" warning the viewer that the White people are all portrayed as ""good"" and the Indians as ""bloodthirsty."" This is a pretty stupid thing to say given that the main villain in the film, Garth, is White. Why isn't there an introduction to the ""Dancing with Wolves"" DVD warning us about how, in that film, Indians are all portrayed as ""good"" and Whites are portrayed as ""bloodthirsty""?",1182038400,28,1762,5.041237113402062

It is really two movies using the same characters and the same lousy overdubs. Some of the scenes are used in both movies so you get to see them over again with a different story and plot. Neither of the movies make any sense at all. How could you possibly get interrested in a character named Kung Fu Wong. The action sequences are incomprehensible. The acting is horrible. As previously stated, the overdubbed english speaking voices are probably the worst part. I really wish I could somehow get the time I spent watching it back.

Goddard is owned by da Silva and Cooper buys her freedom. De Silva reneges on the sale and takes Goddard westward with him as he delivers the guns to the Indians. Cooper finds out about Goddard and the guns and goes off to find the guns and Goddard. On the way he deals with hostile Indians, da Silvas henchmen and survival on the frontier. He eventually saves the day, gets the girl and the bad guys and defeats the Indians. One of Coopers best with lots of action and romance.
