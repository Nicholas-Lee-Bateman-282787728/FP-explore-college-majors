8193720,5,B0002A7QAK,"Nice array of different bellydance performances. I liked most of them, there were just a couple I didn't really care for, but that is pretty common with performance DVDs. Good production quality, easy to see what's happening. It does have camera shots cutting away for some close-ups but it doesn't deter from the performance.

I really enjoyed Karim Nagi (Saidi Cane Dance), Claudia (lots of energy, beautiful and exciting to watch), Paulina (Fan Veil-really cool have never seen it done with one super-large fan like that, interesting), Ansuya, Princess Farhana (very feminine and fun. To add some camp, had a cute admirer in a Fez to add to the performance)....just to name a few.

It has a variety of dancers, styles, and music.  The video alternated between full body shots and partial, but long enough to really get the feel of the dances and enjoy the movement, with no sense that I was missing something essential in the dance.  The images are sharp enough, even on a larger screen TV (I've noticed some DVDs are too grainy to enjoy on a larger screen.)  The packaging is a skinny cardboard box with plastic insert.

About half of these dancers were new names to me.  All of the dances were excellent.  I particularly enjoyed the two dance troupes, Bohemia Dance Co (around the world in dance styles and costuming) and Layla & the Lotus Dancers (I love Isis wings and veil work, so elegant).  Karim was a real change of pace, both as male dancer and working with sticks; he came across as so obviously having fun and he was fun to watch.  Paulina and Guzel are also favorites on this DVD.

I would happily see any of these dancers live.",1309737600,,1035,4.371727748691099
