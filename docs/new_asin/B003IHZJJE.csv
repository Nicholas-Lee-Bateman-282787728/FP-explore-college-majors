8397397,2,B003IHZJJE,"David Clayton-Thomas, the former lead singer of Blood, Sweat and Tears, possesses one of the greatest singing voices I've ever heard. Unfortunately, this is one of the worst videos I have ever seen. The audio quality is poor, and the video looks like a mediocre bootleg. At the time of this concert, Blood Sweat and Tears was touring to promote their 1980 album ""Nuclear Blues,"" which turned out to be the band's last studio album. The classic Blood, Sweat and Tears songs, ""God Bless The Child,"" ""Hi-De-Ho,"" ""Spinning Wheel"" and ""You've Made Me So Very Happy,"" were all done in the form of a medley. The latter two songs got the worst treatment, with each clocking in at less than a minute and a half. To quote a line from the song ""Manic Depression,"" this concert is ""a frustrating mess."" The only reason I didn't give it a one-star rating is the fact that it's the only Blood, Sweat and Tears concert released on DVD, as far as I know. Fans of the group would be much better served by buying the David Clayton-Thomas concert DVD, recorded at the 2006 Montreal Jazz Festival.",1441065600,,1077,4.585492227979275
