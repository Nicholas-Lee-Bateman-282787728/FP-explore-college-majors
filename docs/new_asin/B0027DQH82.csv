8354593,5,B0027DQH82,"I read all of the previous postings on this dance and many of them aree written far more adept at reviewing a dance performance than I am. But I so love this choreography and the committed dancers who bring it life (that's right! L-I-F-E) that I must make my sincere appreciation public so that others can also experience its wonders. First, what this dance is NOT. It is not a biography of the artist, even though the stage notes imply that. It is best to view dance as abstract patterns of human movement through space over time. If that sounds dry, it's because you're reading just the words and not SEEING a dancer make those patterns the very essence of being human. Secondly, although titles of paintings are given for the first part, and huge reproductions of several dominate the back stage in the second half, this dance does not describe or illustrate or interpret paintings. What, then, is this dance? It is an intense exploration of the artistic personality, his interior life with his muse, and his exterior life, with the character H.C.E. from Joyce's FINNEGANS WAKE, that is, HERE COMES EVERYBODY. And this stage comes alive with people going about all of the events and feelings that make up our common humanity. And through all of this frolic and folly wanders the tormented genius, probably as much misunderstood by himself as by other people. Vladimir Malakhov is an outstanding dancer, never for a moment did I not believe I was in the presence of this genius, this flawed but gifted human being, this Caravaggio.",1421798400,,1533,4.7669172932330826

""This could have been beautiful .... seen it live on stage. But the DVD is ruined by someone's bright idea that the editing should be as rapid-fire as possible.

8354595,5,B0027DQH82,"The choreography by Bigonzetti and music of Monteverdi arranged by Moretti provide an extremely rich vehicle for an outstanding ballet performance by Vladimir Malakhov, Polina Semionova, and the Staatballett Berlin.  I discovered it by chance on YouTube and watched that twice.  The result was buying this DVD of the same performance.  Yes, I have watched the DVD several times too.  The pas de deux work by Semionova and Malakhov is mesmerizing.  The whole company is extremely talented, and the performance hangs together well.

The staging imitates the style of Caravaggio in its use of very harsh cross-lighting of the subjects to emphasize the texture and shapes.  This too pulls in the viewer, isolating the surroundings.  The video work is outstandingly good too, giving the DVD viewer more than anyone in the audience could have received.  There are long shots for context, close shots for personal connections, and extreme close ups to show the movements of very expressive hands.

The story is dark from the beginning, and act II becomes even darker as it unfolds various events in Caravaggio's life with connections to his paintings.  However, this is not a historical narrative; there is a lot of imagination mixed in, as if, perhaps, the nightmares of Caravaggio.

This is a modern piece of work, but it is fine classical ballet, with a few modern elements mixed in occasionally.  If you like ballet, this is something you must see.",1416355200,3,1445,5.046413502109704
8354596,5,B0027DQH82,"Bigonzetti's ""Caravaggio"" is a beautiful production of the life of the painter Caravaggio.  I admit, I had to read about Caravaggio, but once I did, the story does come through in the Ballet.

This is very well danced by a talented group of dancers.  The music is appropriate and fits the moods of the production.  The costumes show off the dancers bodies well, and do justice to the topic.  The camera work is modern, fast and good.  There are lots of close up views, and overhead shots that add to the mood.  Yes, the switching of scenes is much different that an individual sitting in an audience at a theatre would experience, but it makes a good dvd.

The subject of the life of Caravaggio leads the  production into ballet recreations of many early modern paintings.  But also into a life of brawling, fighting, murder, and even homosexuality.  These themes come through loud and clear, in magnificent dancing. Thus, this is suggested for mature audiences only.

Excellent production, well done.",1371600000,,1001,4.823529411764706
8354597,5,B0027DQH82,"This is an amazing piece of art. The overwhelming feeling you get is that of the gorgeous renaissance paintings and sculptures (Classical) come to life. It is a celebration of the human body bathed in light. It is the tension of art as described by Ayn Rand when she talks of the texture and skin color of John Galt, it is the treatment of light by Caravaggio, Titian, and Vermeer, it is the sculptures of Praxiteles and Rodin made dynamic....

This is a must have video.

Please see the making of the dance before the main feature. See the vision and passion and then experience the work.

It may take 2 to 4 viewings for the appreciation to mature, The ballet grows on you. Give it air, time, don't rush to be critical.

Perhaps I should give it 4.0 stars and not quite 5 because even though they are on to something they did not take it all the way up. Whats missing? I think the music. It does not soar it stays very horizontal. This was done deliberately and to understand this see the making of the ballet. I think if we had even Haydn's creation or Mozart's' mass etc., this ballet would have soared to dizzy heights.",1361750400,,1124,4.363636363636363
8354598,5,B0027DQH82,"I have seen twice this DVD and the quality of movie is great, the director follows the body language of Vladimir Malakhov (his character is Caravaggio) in a highly convincing way. The other male and female soloists know very well how to suggest desires of the flesh in pas a deux or trois on stage, almost naked to the light and darkness of typical Caravaggio paintings. The tempo is the right one for the observer at home, and it is easy to follow movements and virtuosismo when couples interact, about 18 are active on stage. The coregrapher generated a climate of naturalness. My only point of concern is music: Monterverdi has become a 20th century composer of a symphonic poem and so unusual.",1267833600,,697,4.67479674796748
8354599,5,B0027DQH82,"Step  1: Get over the misinformation and pedantry. The disc booklet, listing the 17 sections of the ballet, includes the titles Journey to Rome, The Tooth Extraction (ye gods!), Young Musicians, The Cardsharps, Dispute and Duel, and the three titles of the Saint Matthew Triptych. All that is absolute rubbish, and a stumbling block for the viewer. Below, I outline the progression of Acts I and II. But first, let's riffle through my little notebook:

Posted on the backstage bulletin board: ""Caravaggio (1571-1610) was a leading practitioner of chiaroscuro, sidelight dramatically bringing his figures out of the enveloping gloom. He plunged right into his canvas, without preliminary sketches, and absolutely needed models, maybe low commoners right off the street. Temperamental, argumentative, and belligerent, he was a brawler and a terror. As a 'killer,' he stayed away from the Eternal City in his last four years, dying of malaria in Porto Ercole 90 miles away.""

Thanks to TV director Andreas Morrell, assisted by a director of photography and six cameramen, the ballet was filmed and edited as a movie (ever refreshing your vision) where the faces, the upper torsos, the hands do make a difference. You will see ten times what the premiere audience saw from the orchestra and three horseshoe tiers. An inspiration is the overhead camera(s) which gives you the wings of an angel.

Amauro Bigonzetti, choreographer, born 1960 in one of the rougher sections of Rome, danced professionally for ten years, then switched to choreography because he believes a ballet company should develop from within rather than depend on guest stars. He's fond of his corps of young dancers, and spreads them throughout Act I and they jump and spin for joy. Though he is not given to talking about himself, you can find some interesting facts by googling ""bigonzetti macau culture centre"".

Composer Bruno Moretti, a favorite collaborator of Bigonzetti, has symphonized extracts from Monteverdi's L'Orfeo, Poppea, madrigals, and religious works into 90 minutes of eminently listenable music, vivacious, emotional, militaristic, that infuses the dancers. It deserves its own CD.

Conductor Paul Connelley takes the traditional bow at curtain call and spreads his bracket over the pit, but it's inky black. My surmise is that the music was pre-recorded, as indeed heard in the rehearsals.

As Caravaggio, the renowned Russian dancer Malakhov is 40 on this DVD. He has the well tuned lean body of a 20 year old and is caramel blond. He will not at all be capable of conveying the black haired cocky terror we consider the painter to have been. But surprisingly the ballet characterizes the painter as an outsider, self doubting, teased, bullied, seeking affection and affiliation, agonized that death will cut him short. Malakhov is clad only in a wrapped brief throughout the production, such vulnerability! So let us define Malakhov as the homunculus of the man, the sensitive inner being lodged in the brain that must be protected by a bristling exterior.

The beautiful long legged Semionova says in the Supplement that her character is Light in Act I, but in Act II she has to do terrible things. Well, that's why a Total Eclipse so frightened the populace in centuries past. She's bandaged into a brief costume with a RED RIBBON twining her right arm. Remember that, because the Messenger of Death is a virtual twin but WITHOUT THE RIBBON.

Seemingly the only German among the principals, Knop is a phenomenal dancer, as is Semionova. As the Messenger of Death, she must maintain a dour expression. She is a (forget the Belle) Dame sans Merci.

Handsome Kaniskin and Semionov play the two mischievous Athletes from ancient Rome. Carrillo is the rather haughty Fortune Teller. Nakamura and Banzhaf are the True Lovers, already in sacramental bond.

But Leo!!! Of Croatian lineage (?), a graduate of the Munich ballet academy, Leonard Jakovina is an explosion of masculinity reserved for Act II. As Caravaggio's significant other, he is love, flesh, brother, defender, triumph. Call him the Warrior.

THE PERFORMANCE

The Sinfonia is played under the opening credits, backed by images of Bigonzetti and dancers in rehearsal.

Act I: (1) At centerstage, young Caravaggio in Milan, an arc of seated figures about him, expresses his uncertainty and longing and reaches skyward. Beautiful Light enters and bonds with him. (2) Rome. The corps fills the stage, pairing off into couples on this festive day. The two Athletes rush on, each with a bunch of grapes. Suddenly, several youths carry on Caravaggio teasingly. The Athletes dump wine down his throat and he staggers about. (3) A hush falls as the Messenger of Death enters, seizing him, attacking him, dominating him. (4) The exuberant corps returns, and the Athletes wine them. (5) Caravaggio enters, tries to join in. (6) The Fortune Teller solicits palms. In Caravaggio's hand she sees blood and doom, and abandons him for the Athletes. (7) Caravaggio and the True Lovers join hands. He leads her aside for himself, but she returns to her Lover for an exquisite pas de deux. (8) The corps returns with the Athletes and Fortune Teller. Their grande finale is punctuated by pings from a little silver anvil. (9) All are repulsed as Caravaggio drags on a red silk swath like a bloody tongue. He sinks down but determinedly rises as Light returns to embrace him. He lifts her as behind them appears the great golden frame, with a portal draped in reddish purple.

Act II: (1)The great frame shows cropped versions of The Musicians ca. 1595, Judith and Holofernes 1597-1600, The Entombment 1600-1604. (2) Caravaggio is seated at centerstage, and in the frame's black interior is the miniaturizaton of the True Lover male, moving in unison with him. (3) The Warrior appears and he and Caravaggio dance together lovingly, sensuously. (4) The True Lovers dance and finally take Caravaggio in. (5) He's alone. Light enters, and she seems changed, ominous. (6) The Messenger and the Warrior enter, she is different, enamored by his tenderness. Finally, she slashes at his spine, tries to dominate him, but it's a draw. (7) Light forces hand to hand bond of the True Lovers, Caravaggio, Messenger, and Warrior. (8) A servant girl brings on a tray with a trough of blood. Light dips Caravaggio's hand in it and makes him slash three of the principals, and she slashes the fourth. Light drags away the writhing file of five, but Caravaggio breaks away, smeared with blood, weakening. (9) The shades of the True Lovers and the Messenger dance about his fallen form. (10) The Warrior lowers himself out of the frame, dances militaristically around the fallen artist, telling us This Man Will Triumph. (11) Light and Caravaggio dance, the pact fulfilled. She lies prone, and he dances alone reprising gestures from the outset of the ballet. As he falls dying across her body, he grasps her hand. Blood rains down on his breathless chest.

[This is my fourth Bravo! for this ballet. You can hear my first three on the DVD. Several nights after the premiere, at McQueen's Next Whiskey Bar, I asked the bartender, ""Why does Light have a red ribbon around her arm?"" He answered, ""Because Mauro dedicates the ballet to all the AIDS people in the world."" I reached for another pretzel and believed him.]",1254528000,21,7326,5.017283950617284
8354600,2,B0027DQH82,"The elements of the artist Caravaggio's tumultuous life, his artistic achievement, and historical perspective, are all reflected in the DVD of the Berlin State Ballet's DVD production of Caravaggio, choreographed by Mauro Bigonzetti, with a new score by Bruno Moretti drawn from the early Baroque music of Claudio Monteverdi.

Michelangelo Merisi (1571-1610) was the innovative, famous, notorious Renaissance painter known as Caravaggio, taken from the Italian village in which his family lived. Though he lived only a brief life, art history points to Caravaggio as having a profound influence on the new Baroque style of art that exploded in the early 17th century after his death. This Italian master of ""darkness and light,"" or chiaroscuro painting, frequently depicted vivid, real images of intense emotion, bathed in light against dark backdrops. Such elements are to be found reflected within Berlin State Ballet's production based on Caravaggio's life and art, but with intentional modern twists. Caravaggio's influential impact on the development of Western art was only rediscovered 300 years later, in the 20th century, and the ballet's creators wanted this rediscovery to be incorporated, and it is, perhaps too much. I approached the ballet with high expectations based on the facts: that it featured an important subject figure from Italian Renaissance art, musical material drawn from an important Italian composer, but within a one-decade shadow of the 20th century in which the artist was rediscovered.  I expected an interpretive ballet that reflected Caravaggio's life and aesthetic, in modern language full of curiosity, implied dramatic threads, and stunning imagery.  In Caravaggio's supporting elements, its score and creative designs, it delivered. Yet it fell short due to important flaws in the overarching unbalanced structure of the ballet, and rather melodramatic, uber-modern choreographic style.

Bruno Moretti's score admirably demonstrates the company's creative intent. The composer utilizes modern musical language and full orchestral scoring, frequently drawn from spare themes by Monteverdi, but interspersed with entirely new sounds. Caravaggio's creative designs are also major highlights, with Carlo Cerri's outstanding chiaroscuro lighting and Kristopher Millar and Lois Swandale's beautifully rendered, spare, shroud-like costumes that reflected Caravaggesque imagery with a fluid modernism.  But even with such strong supporting elements to its credit, the overarching structure of the ballet demonstrated a lack of larger scenes for the strong Berlin corps de ballet, and far too many solos and pas de deux's.  Also, Mr. Bigonzetti's choreography was far skewed with modern, taut, angular movement and rather melodramatic, if occasionally impressive, athletic prowess. Melodrama abounds particularly in the lengthy Martyrdom of St. Matthew in the second act.  The principal role of Caravaggio is overexposed in this piece, with frequent interruptions in scenes, and emotional gestural motifs that became repetitive. Caravaggio moves fluently from darkness into light, ripped by emotional angst, we get it! There are a few gorgeous dances, especially in the first act of mostly small ensembles intended to interpret several of Caravaggio's most famous paintings, especially ones performed against dramatic, direct Monteverdi quotes in the score. However, the few full corps dances that are seen seem to lack the creativity and polish that went into the heavier principal sections. The historically strong corps of the Berlin State Ballet appears so infrequently that I felt they were truly relegated to backdrop. Demonstrated by the camera direction consisting of mostly close-up shots and rapid editing, Mr. Bigonzetti's work also appeared too focused on the upper body. Thus, the camera did not capture as much broader ensemble, beautiful silhouettes and patterns, or thrilling footwork that the score might have allowed the film to achieve.

Overall, this DVD is worth seeing once to hear Mr. Moretti's interesting orchestrations, and the gorgeous production values. As for the dancing, it tends to venture a little too far into the dark.",1252713600,11,4184,5.693910256410256
