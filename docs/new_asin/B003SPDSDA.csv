4189318,5,B003SPDSDA,"This series is VERY good. It is about a young boy who lives an apathetic life and is suddenly thrust into the secret world of ninjas. He finds out that he is the holder of a jitsu that has the power to change the world as he wishes. But others have found out as well and covet that power to the extent that they are willing to kill all who get in their way. He makes new and talented friends and friends out of enemies. How he grows and develops to rise to these challenges is surprising as well as heart wrenching. A wonderful, action-packed series. For ages over 14 yrs. Great entertainment.",1296604800,13,593,4.256637168141593
4189319,3,B003SPDSDA,"The title of this should've been...""Daddy, can you please hold my hand? or Daddy, make the bad people go away!"" Nabari No Ou was okay when it first started off but around the seventh episode the series started turning gay. Not gay in the sense of sex but more in the Lord Of The Rings sense. That ""special bond"" shared between Frodo and Sam was being recreated many times during this series! The special friendship/bond between Mikaru and the assassin Yoite is often times distracting! There is still action at times during this anime but the series will often have you asking ""Are the creators serious?"" This should only be purchased by women that wanna prove that they can watch an anime without being grossed out. It's an ok series if you're trying impress a guy or show a girl that you can be sensitive. My advice definitely rent or preview one to two episodes before buying this!",1290729600,4,884,4.60126582278481
4189320,5,B003SPDSDA,"ever since i say it on tv i love the concept that if ninja can continue in the modern age it naruto for the real world i love storyline and the action,action, and the music with is a rare and a plus",1290297600,3,198,3.738095238095238
4189321,5,B003SPDSDA,"This series may have a familiar sounding premise... ninjas in a modern-day world. But it is VERY different than any anime out there, in terms of details and execution. In this story, everyone has a reason for what they do. It becomes hard to tag anyone specifically as good or bad guys. Sides shift as ideologies evolve. Mysteries unfold. Bonds are formed and broken and changed forever and strengthened powerfully.

A bond with no name, stronger than friendship, closer than brotherhood, and more desperate than romance, forms between the two main characters. They are all alone, yet are together in that loneliness. It truly has no simple category. It's beautiful and tragic at the same time.

The pacing is earthy. It takes its time, yet is not boring. Characters take time to do things, both significant and seemingly trivial, just as they would in real life. But it moves along enough so that it doesn't drag out. There's plenty of awesome battles and action scenes, as well as suspense and even silliness, to keep things on the move, as well as a cohesive and forward-moving plot.

The tone is mostly sombre, wrought with quiet desperation. But it isn't dragged down by it; it's well carried by action and even comedy. The three elements accentuate one another, providing a rich, multi-layered experience.

The animation is quite good in quality, with a lot of detail and a good balance between flair and realism. The color palette is almost water-color in its soft, subdued hues, accentuated by much stronger contrasts in scenes of horror or action.

The music is gorgeous, very fitting for the moods of each scene, with several pieces standing out as memorable and gripping.

The characters are also memorable, with their own endearing quirks and human flaws. They don't rely on archetypes, but are instead characters who would remind you of real people you've met. This anime breaks a LOT of stereotypes and does things differently. For example, despite being a shounen production (for teen boys), the main character is the total opposite of the typical shounen action hero. XD

It's an amazing piece of art, requiring a bit of patience but it becomes truly rewarding once you realize the motivations of the characters. The fact that they're all just standing up for what they believe in, with their own strong reasons, makes it a deeper experience than typical good-vs-evil fare.

Many claim it's a YAOI anime, but don't let that scare you off; there's not even a kiss in this (Edit: Other than between a heterosexual couple, I forgot about that. XD). And as I mentioned above, the bonds displayed are far more complex than any category can define. There IS a one-sided crush between a couple side characters, but it doesn't go into detail and is mostly played for laughs. Though of course fan-girls will ship, and that's fine. But there's a lot more to ALL the characters than meets the eye.

Don't miss this wonderful story due to misconceptions or hesitance about the main character. At least give it a try for a few episodes. It'll pull you in, and won't let go even long after the final credits roll.",1286841600,42,3115,4.829268292682927
4189322,5,B003SPDSDA,"I actually find it odd that there are no reviews for this ninja anime. Nabari's interesting characters and plotline make it a worthwhile purchase. It does have greater depth than ninja anime like Naruto, and, perhaps due to the smaller cast, delves more deeply into the characters themselves. The hidden world of Nabari, similarly, is smaller, but just as intense. Naruto fans will find a common theme in Nabari, regarding the twisted relations of the Shimizu family. The main characters are very successful in this anime. Yoite, for all his heart stopping command of forbidden ninja arts, can be very innocent about life outside of his ninja clan. Similarly, Miharu, an outsider to the hidden world, can be stunningly innocent of the ways of the assassins within it. It is very engaging watching the strange kinship that grows between these characters as the quest for ultimate supremacy in the hidden world -- and the direction that world of ninjas will take -- comes to a head.",1282953600,6,980,4.909638554216867
4189323,5,B003SPDSDA,"I picked up watching Nabari no Ou with a good friend of mine who had watched it 4 times prior to my arrival. She and I made fun of it in the beginning; however, at episode 5 (when she crashed on the couch) it began to get really serious, rather than Miharu being the epic grape grower (the juice of which he is seen drinking in episode 2 (which was the only thing he ate/drank until episode 16) which labeled him the anorexic diabedic (red) grape juice drinker) he became an insiteful character that had a past, and a reason for being apathetic to EVERYONE (and we mean everyone!).

The 650 (nearly straight) minutes that I spent sitting in that lumpy, electric blue saucer chair were the best 650 (almost straight) minutes of my sad lonely life.

I love this anime because it DEEPLY supports homosexuality.",1282089600,11,807,4.52054794520548

4189341,2,B003SPDSDA,"Nabari No Ou has a slogan, ""The ninja world is at war.  Whatever.""  I have to agree, but cautiously.  There is a lot to admire in Nabari.

It's modern times and the ninja world is alive and well, but hidden in the shadows, more accurately, hidden in broad daylight, but disguised in trendy trench coats, hoodies, and smashing scarves.  It's anime though, so you've got to love it.  Miharu is an apethetic kid whos been blessed/cursed with an ancient ninja scroll that lies dormant in his body.  Its powers are more Godlike than having anything to do with ninjutsu, but that's ok.  Two different ninja factions are locked in competition for Miharu's loyalty.

The nice group befriends him first, but can't seem to make him care.  Me and Miharu both.  The fact that Miharu suffers from a constant gas leak in the room is one of the best and most original parts of the show.  Yotei shows up from the bad clan, and is even more apathetic, depressed, but uses a ninja technique that is just as destructive to him as it is to opponents, making him the cool guy.  A man-crush and coupling of spirits takes place and the rest of the show is spent discovering character backgrounds and watching an emotional tug of war match with Miharu and Yotei and their daddy clans.  It's like Romeo and Romeo with the air let out.

Please don't get me wrong.  That's just my cynical way of describing the show (which considering its theme, would greatly appreciate my choice of tone).  Nabari is a good show.  The animation isn't the best, but it's clean.  The fights are animated admirably with no gimmicks.  The character designs resemble Code Geass (body frames are thin like bamboo reeds).  The story is different from standard ninja anime and has some worthwhile depth to it.

The problem with Nabari is the pacing and the depth they try to force.  This show has some good, human questions posed and a somber, sobering point to make.  Its just that Nabari makes that point in the first 5 episodes and doesnt really offer a different one.  Characters paths change with the seasons and loyalties shift with winds, but they ultimately end up right where they started, minus some bad guys.

*SPOILER*

{Miharu starts off not using his power and not caring, and ends up not using his power but caring.
Yotei starts off regretting his life and the use of his self-destructive power, and seeking to be erased from existence, and ends up accepting his fate simply dying when hes supposed to.}

*END SPOILER*

All in all, I applaud Nabari for its unique theme, consistent quality of animation, and endearing characters.  However, there are so many animes out there that suffer from a rushed narrative and deserve 26 episodes to tell their story.  Nabari can tell its story in 6 episodes, but do to its emphasis on character sorrow and exploration deserves 13 to feel complete.
If you become truly ensnared by its characters then I think youll enjoy Nabari to the fullest.  But if you stand back and look at the story as a whole, there is almost no character development or plot progression.  If you're turned off by a crawling narrative, repetitive declarations, and obvious filler in place of depth, then this will feel taxing to watch.  Its a shame that a tighter storyline, more character growth, and pointless side quests being removed is all that keep this from 3 stars and a solid anime viewing experience.

In the realm of S.A.V.E. titles, this one ranks up there with the better ones, so don't let this dissuade you if you're restricted in cash and looking for value.  Im a picky S.O.B., writer, and animator so this is just my opinion of it when compared to the ocean of great anime out there.  Almost 3 stars, almost.",1387843200,4,3702,4.648690292758089

It is very interesting plot, storyline...all that, but again manga is way better than anime however anime is still cool. Im glad that I bought the SAVE edition, saved a lot money on it, it is worthy to buy.

4189354,4,B003SPDSDA,"So, a kind of spoof with a weird plot and too many subplots.  Changing sides, changing minds, mystery, 1/2 truths, disguises, and epic battle scenes.  An interesting storyline with a middle school kid that's apathetic to the impending war of the ninja clans.  Almost with sociopathic demeanor, and definitely dark undertones, but has its viewing value.  The maneuvering and the changing sides just added to the mayhem, but its all about the moment.  There was no real good team/bad team.  Its a bunch of individuals that pick the side for each battle.

Minus a star for confusing me in the later episodes.",1366329600,2,605,4.872549019607843

They had the usual anime cliches: closing their eyes when they speak and bad guys who wear awkward clothing (the emo samurai). Most of the voice dubbing was good. I didn't like the chick who played the blonde haired samurai girl. Her voice sometimes grated on my patience. Still, the show was emotional engaging. Key themes include: responsibility, moral conscience, honor, sacrifice, forgiveness, and apathy. The violence isn't bad by any means.

The story was more important to me than the actual fighting and there is a fantastic bro-mance going on here which I absolutely loved. This is a very gentle anime which has it's rough parts but overall the connection between the main character and his new best friend is really something.",1338422400,4,506,4.696629213483146
4189360,4,B003SPDSDA,"As the title of this review says, it's not the typical 'Naruto' ninja type of anime. There is a manga that goes with it but I am not sure if it's longer than the Anime. The series has more drama than fighting, even though the fighting is well played. There are no goofy outfits and the series in a whole has a modern feel to it as in the ninja not only use knives, they also use automatic guns. Some characters give some 'what the heck are you doing?' vibes like Tobari who is a ninja almost worse than even Naruto (what I mean is even Naruto could do a better job than him) and Koichi, the classmate of the main hero, who is not as innocent as he seems. A lot characters appear to be bad but there is only one true villain but even that is very vague on some parts. There is a slight shonen Ai (boy love) to this series as well so if you don't like that type of stuff, I suggest watching it at your own risk. Of course a favorite character of mine dies but I am not going to spoil it (hint it's a relation to Raimei). Adding the samurai almost hurt this series since it was about ninjas but they really didn't become too important. The voicing acting was okay in this dub, meaning it wasn't bad but it wasn't excellent either. I couldn't judge some voice actors because I have never heard them voice other characters before like Yoite and Yukimi. I was surprised to get 2 commentaries on this as Funimation usually doesn't add special features to SAVE editions but I was really glad they did since I love listening to commentaries. The story went a little too fast in the beginning but gradually slowed down in my opinion something I didn't care for. The animation for the show was fantastic especially how the Japanese animators did every characters eyes. For saving some money, I definitely recommend this to your Anime collection.

I give this a 4 out of 5 stars simply because the storyline could have had some work done to it (and they fact that characters I like died).",1335657600,4,1976,4.311827956989247
4189361,3,B003SPDSDA,"Well, this is another series that I had a litle trouble getting into. The idea behind it seems sound but it just didn't seem to carry thru for me. The hero is a pretty good guy but some of the people with who he interacts with are really sort of shallow. There is one group that's really evil, but then there is the other group in which the leader seems more interested it gaining power for himself rather than doing what might be best. In fact, it seems that, in his own way, he almost comes across as bad as the villian. Makes you wonder. There wasn't a good resolution of this situation from my point of view. This and the lack of a clear ending was my reason for the 3 stars. I still think the series is worth watching as there are some good stuff in here. I was just left a bit flat by it.",1335484800,4,794,4.031645569620253
4189362,5,B003SPDSDA,"This was a very engaging and beautiful show right from the first episode. I absolutely loved it! I'm not going to go into too much details because others have certainly done that enough, and I'm just going to praise some of my favorite aspects. The character designs were extremely original and very well developed! I found myself caring greatly for many of them, and their personal ambitions. Characters that are portrayed as menacing and to be hated transform very often when new light is shed on them, making them more than what they first appeared. I grew to love each of them. Likewise some of the ""good"" guys turn around as well!

The animation was gorgeous! I definitely don't watch a lot of anime because it just seems too geared to teenage girls or with boring and cliche action plots (and of course there's those gross ""adult"" animes at FYE). Not so with this AT ALL! VERY original and VERY worth paying attention to every detail to get the whole thing! Back to what I was saying, this incorporates very complex and seamless animation with outrageously high and meticulous attention to detail. As a car drives by, the shadows of leaves are gorgeously moving on the surface with it. Atmospheres are developed lusciously with great fields, forests, cities, and mountains, tiles on roofs, people's reactions in the background, food design, etc. etc. Such beauty in details flashes by for such a short amount of time that you'd have to wonder why anyone even bothered! It's visually captivating! As I said, I don't watch much anime so I was impressed as a first timer, especially since my only previous anime interest was Pokemon, being a little too cartoony, predictable, and cliche (notice how in every Pokemon movie that Ash just so happens to have to save the world and meet a legendary Pokemon that speaks English, blah, blah, blah. How much can a 12 year old do, man? And he always succeeds). But when looking at other anime shows, they don't seem to even remotely compare to the high amount of visual beauty in this show. Each second can be in an art show. Seriously! I also love how the people are drawn as well in a very different way- very skinny and sickly at times (some legs look like twigs!). I'm just...blown away. How could others not see how carefully detailed everything is?

Not just the animation, but the story is a well developed work of art, considering just about everything. In many animes, people just kill people and that's that, and just leave them on the streets with no worries of the police. In this, all deaths have to be covered up in a believable way so the outside world (our world) doesn't get suspicious or incorporated into the affairs of the Nabari world. Miharu always has to cover up with excuses to his grandma on why he's gone with friends all the time, which is very realistic! Many themes reoccur with nice symbolization, such as, just as a small example, Yoite's drink of choice- lemon cider. Or perhaps the subtle mystery of Miharu's cat. And there's so many details in the story that I just can't type them all, but you get the point. This was not a lazily produced show!

All in all, a 5/5 star anime that got me excited each time it presented each episode with drama, immediately jumping into the kick-butt theme song, showcasing epic awesomeness throughout the episode, and ending each time with another very great song. I watched the whole thing in 2 days and don't regret the approximately 13 hours I spent watching it! No spoilers here, but the ending is very unexpected and I was very glad it ended the way it did. Now if there was only a new season! Now I REALLY want to read the manga!

I HIGHLY recommend this show, so much more than many others! Thank you, FUNimation, for bringing this high-quality entertainment to the USA!",1308096000,9,3790,4.64381520119225
