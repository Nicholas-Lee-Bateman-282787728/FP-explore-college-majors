8523582,5,B00807HU4O,"PLOT: Reporter Peter Bergen and NatGeo follow the trail and story of the demise of Bin Laden.

Reporter Peter Bergen heads to Pakistan and interviews the people who came in contact with Osama Bin Laden before the final raid on his compound. Why I liked this one ....is that Bergen follows a human trail to a jewelry store where Ben Laden's courier pawned / sold Jewelry and his level of absolute poverty they were living in the massive compound. This kind of reporting shows a close up look at the life style of his family and guards. This is an excellent docudrama. It goes with the actual CIA personal who helped using both 1. Analysts 2. Human intelligence which merge and help locate the massive compound in Pakistan where Ben Laden was living his life since 2005. It also gives the mind set of Ben Laden and how he functioned. The death of 14 CIA and US military personal when a inside connection to Bin Laden turns into a living bomber. Excellent look in to the trail of Bin Laden and how the 9/11 attack helped seal Bin Ladens Fate and increased the CIA's drive to find him. 5 STARS~",1497657600,,1090,4.45
