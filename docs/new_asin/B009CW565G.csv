5316125,5,B009CW565G,"Really enjoyed this movie...it touches so many types of relationships within a family core and could serve as a great learning tool on how to communicate, step back and try to understand people's conceptions of things, and find the importance of family and taking care of each other.",1365897600,,283,4.916666666666667
5316126,4,B009CW565G,This product was very well done.  It showed that controversy in a family can be overcome. I would recommend it.,1365724800,3,111,4.55

5316128,5,B009CW565G,The movie is well done and supports family. Something harder and harder to find in movies anymore. I know my grand kids can put it on and be safe. It's in my library as my tv is going off more and more.,1360627200,30,202,3.8333333333333335
5316129,4,B009CW565G,"A clean family drama with a bit of humor, romance, scenery and decent enough acting and directing to keep one's interest.

The story's familiar: successful, big city son returns to beautiful, country home at news of ill father.  The family needs help with their flailing B&B as a ruthless, competitor, Daphne Zuniga, pressures them to sell out.  There's also internal strife between brothers, and a girlfriend urging the son to return to the city.  Will he do the right thing?  Can the family and the B&B be saved?  Is there a love with the right person blossoming?  Stay tuned.

We pretty much know the outcomes, and it's a pleasant enough journey.  There's no earth shattering revelations or shocking discoveries.

SunWorld Pictures puts out these films, Scents and Sensibility, Civil Love, Christmas Angel.  They offer the same premise of romance, a light moral message and a Dove approved film.  They interchange the actors; same crew and directors, Brian Brough directed this one and several others.  They're not high budget films, and this one has it's slow parts, but I think, overall, they do a good job putting it all together.

We enjoy family films, best of all, if not overly corny or pretentious, and I think for the most part they're reaching that here. I applaud the effort, and hope for more.  3 1/2 stars.",1355270400,37,1322,4.839285714285714
5316130,5,B009CW565G,Family is very important to me! I didn't like that the main character started out with some kind of problem with his family. I loved that he changed and family relations were mended!,1354579200,17,182,4.545454545454546

5316134,1,B009CW565G,"Painful to watch! I couldn't even watch to the end. The wrong message was sent. This family convinces themselves that their children should not have the freedom to leave the nest and pursue their own dreams. Saving 50 acres for 4 people to live on & run a failing bed & breakfast somehow becomes a charitable cause. Hometown girl is seemingly portrayed as noble for staying home to play nursemaid to her alcoholic mother because they ""can't afford rehab & she's not even sure her mom would go"".

Without even seeing the end, I know the 'prodigal' son who was enjoying his career in California realizes that the simple life and the companionship of the addict enabling hometown girl is what he really craves. Holy crapoli! Don't believe this in anyway resembles the Biblical story of the prodigal son.",1494720000,,800,4.755395683453237
5316135,1,B009CW565G,"I'm getting much better at spotting the ""waste of time"" movies and gave this one almost 4 minutes.

Not sure who would enjoy this one?",1494633600,2,134,4.36
5316136,2,B009CW565G,"From the start this film has the look and feel of a made for TV, after school special, oh, and it has No correlation whatsoever with the scriptural story of the prodigal son, none.  The fact that they even use that in the title is offensive as it seems to simply be pandering to a Christian audience.  Five minutes into the film you also know everything that is going to happen;  Son will return home to help out the family, he'll wind up staying and then save the failing family business.  He'll also fall in love with the pretty maid who's been there for years but somehow is unrecognizable to him after his two year absence.  Seriously?  Who writes this nonsense?  The best part though has to be the scene during the big benefit concert when a famous music star is performing in order to raise money to save the B&B from their evil competitor (also somehow completely unknown to the son who spent his life there).  Somehow this rockstar's entire sound system is being controlled from a tiny, un-manned sound board just sitting by it's lonesome backstage allowing the evil B&B competitor from down the street to walk up and not only pull out the various cords but then cut them all with a wire cutter.  Suddenly, the younger brother who's never done ANYTHING but work at the B&B runs back stage (the band members meanwhile have no clue what to do!) and is miraculously able to splice all the sound cables back together AND get them plugged back in to just the right spots BEFORE THE FIRST SONG IS OVER!!!!  Wow, simply amazing!  Tune in next week for more great adventures with B&B Guy!  ""He may be a mild mannered bed maker and pancake flipper but as fast as you can turn down bed linens he becomes B&B Guy!""  Yeah, I know that's stupid, but it fits.",1492646400,4,1753,4.4576802507836994
5316137,5,B009CW565G,Loved the Family value on this movie. Sometimes we loose track as to what is the most important in our lives. Always reaching for the stars when all we really need is right in front of us all along.,1491436800,,198,4.102564102564102

5316139,3,B009CW565G,"I watched another movie on Amazon Prime about a son returning to save the family farm and held a benefit concert.

Turns out that the actor in this movie was the actual family member who bought the B&B from his family to save it. Watch the movie and look up their info online to see what the real status of this B&B is now. Very touching. Family dynamics during stressful times. Life changing choices to make.

The 3 people pictured on the dvd are not all main characters, indeed, Daphne Zuniga, who is pictured on the Dvd is NOT the love interest, nor even a main character.
Brian McNamara,(also pictured on the dvd),plays the father & is not in most of the movie.
You might want to note that he was 52 when this movie came out....and he looks alot younger than Brad Johnson who plays his oldest son !
  The predictable plot gets more difficult to enjoy as the characters have no chemistry at all with each other. Some jarring performances are cringe worthy & there's a person mentioned that's key to the story but she never surfaces & needs much more explanation.

Jimmy has zero character arc or development. He just changes his heart with no introspection, soul searching, or anything that shows the change.

The antagonist is over-the-top evil, making her more of a caricature than a character.

The concert at the end that was supposed to save the mill at the last possible second seemed more of a fairy-tale ending that a God given miracle. If this were really a ""faith-based"" film as it was billed, God should have been given the credit here. But there's no mention of God at all, anywhere in this film.

To give an idea of how vacant this product was of entertainment value an unusual amount of time is spent showing characters driving on the highway, as if this was an unusual activity. In other words if a character left one place to go somewhere there would be a long shot of that person driving on the ten lane highways of California as if it was important to know how that character got from one place to the other or that driving on a super highway in California was extremely entertaining. The story was typical, the successful son has to come home when his father has a stroke and no one else on earth can take the place of the successful son not even his brother in running a bed and breakfast. The brother for some reason hates the successful brother . The chemistry between these two characters is non existent and uninteresting.

Daphne was great to watch, playing the self-serving competitor of the B&B - you loved to hate her, but found it difficult to connect with any of the other characters. The mother didn't even look sad when her husband passed away. The housekeeper/maid did not deliver - nor did her alcoholic mother who really only had a few weak lines.

Will the oldest son return home and help his family in their time of crisis? Will the youngest son ever forgive him for past hurts? Will the nasty lady competitor succeed in stealing their family's Bed & Breakfast away from them? Questions like that keep you watching.
