1057539,1,630568524X,"I watched this and I thought - ""Wow, What a great documentary about UFOs"". The UFO footage of a crashed saucer did look very real and very convincing. Even if it was all a hoax the documentary interviews with Russian scientists is still very good and is a very valuable lesson for us all. However when I learned the truth this production went from being the real thing, to being a Blair Witch Project with some real elements to being very dangerous filmmaking with some questionable exploitation of real people that is borderline criminal.
The filmmakers interviewed REAL Russian scientists but did not tell them that they where making this documentary. Then they re-arranged their interviews and edited them to suite their agenda. The Russian scientists believed that these people where authentic American filmmakers, but these guys where out to cheat, deceive and exploit. They even hired actors to play Russian scientists who did not exist. The books and newspaper clippings in this DVD do not exist either. Then the American filmmakers paid a bunch of local villagers peanuts to dress up as KGB agents for an advertisement they said they where making. That is the KGB UFO footage that headlines this DVD.
The Russian scientists in this DVD are all over the web and have condemned this DVD to the last. It was pure exploitation through and through.
Keep your bucks in your pockets. Don't support this gutter that is a sham in the fields of science, documentary filmmaking and UFOology.",1075075200,23,1488,4.908730158730159
1057540,1,630568524X,"Some years ago, FOX did good business with ""Alien Autopsy"" a disinfotainment show masquerading as a documentary.  The whole time, the narrator maintained a disingenuous ""look, we don't know whether this footage is real or a hoax, you be the judge"" posture.  Now, SciFi channel has followed suit, and even upped the ante with ""Secret KGB UFO Files.""  I'm not sure whether the producers put out a call for anyone to submit any footage they could come up with, no questions asked, or whether they actually produced in their studios some of the clips we see.  They look fishy, they smell fishy, and, well, you get the picture.  I expected to see coverage of well-known, documented Soviet cases.  Instead, we are shown supposed gun-camera footage that has somehow never appeared anywhere else (exclusive!), and which looks amazingly like cheap, computer-generated special effects of the kind that abound in SciFi channel's original programs.  Three examples especially stand out for sheer audacity: one shows a cylindric object outpacing the aircraft it is filmed from, another shows a saucer dipping from high to low altitude through clouds in the distance behind a flying jet (with its shadow looking artfully drawn in for ""realism"" on one of the clouds), and yet another shows two unidentified objects merging into one.  Over the years we have all seen many authentic UFO clips, we know what they look like.  The footage in this show has an unmistakably phoney look to it.  The only question is whether the producers themselves are the ones who hoaxed it, or whether they were just looking the other way, nudge nudge wink wink. This show seems to be a sad reflection of a contemporary viewing audience that doesn't care whether a documentary is authentic or imitation, and perhaps doesn't have the intelligence to recognize the difference.  Isn't it hard enough to sort fact from fiction in a subject like this?  Must we have counterfeit documentaries like this now also?  Shame on you, SciFi, they should pull your licensing.  For the most undiscriminating viewers only.",1066089600,2,2069,5.011695906432749
1057541,1,630568524X,"For entertainment value this documentary should get a ten. Full marks! For reality value it now earns a big 0 in more ways than one. This video, purports what it claims to be KGB footage of a crashed UFO. That is probably why you want to watch it right? Well that part of the video is wow! Again, full marks to the makers of this documentary for putting something like this together. I would highly recommend viewing this video, even if the Video was a hoax, but it turns out that there is much more going on that just this and this is what makes the story very sad.
The miserable truth is that much has been exposed since the videos release including what appears to be the exploitation of real people, real doctors and real investigators who thought they where participating in something else other than a KGB UFO video analysis. They had been duped and according to the very quick work of Russian investigator - Boris Shurinov - are quite annoyed at the way they have been treated by what they thought where serious American film makers. The newspapers that appear in this documentary are not Russian nor do they exist. Some of the Russian UFO researchers in this video are not real nor has anyone since located them. The books in the video written by these non-existent researchers do not exist in Russia. Further more there are Russians who worked on the production of an American advertisement which has since turned out to be this very same KGB UFO video. Where Blair Witch and Fargo get off is in the fact that these films starred actors and not real people who where paid to do a job and received the acclaim for their work. However there are real Russian professionals in this video who are totally 'boiling' at being abused for profit in this manner. It all goes to show the actual mind set of the documentary film makers who thought that if they did this video in Russia staring real Russians that no one would notice a thing. In my opinion this is why this documentary should be treated as a work of extreme prejudice. If you like exploitation material like Bum Fight, Jerry Springer or Cannibal Holocaust then this video is for you. If are interested in UFO footage then go elsewhere. There are plenty of other videos on the UFO phenomena that you will enjoy much more and are done by better film makers with much much higher ethical film making standards.
Roger Moore should have more sense than to present these film maker's garbage.",1048982400,2,2449,4.555555555555555
1057542,1,630568524X,"Why on earth did Moore decide to take part in this special ?. -He was probably paid well, otherwise I see no reason. I have never witnessed a programme so obviously faked from start to finish. The scientists and  authors interviewed come across as being instructed what to say. (Apart  from Stanton Friedman I've never heard of any of them.) Don't believe any  of it is to be taken seriously just because some of them apparently are  russian. One of these ""specialists"" even wears a rather false  looking beard. (-They have actors in Russia too, you know !.) The footage  supposedly showing a 1968 crashed u.f.o. somewhere in the Soviet Union, and  the subsequent autopsy of a green (!) alien is in my view NOT authentic.  -This is in all likelihood someone shaking the camera about, trying to make  it look like an old piece of film. They've shot it in color, having learned  from that other infamous fake alien autopsy film (the Ray Santoni one), not  to do it in b/w. But all to no avail. A so-called film-expert claims it  could not have been made in the 80's or 90's - rubbish; it's extremely  recent. Several others naturally agree with him, even Friedman think it's  ""worth looking into"". -Trust me, it's not. For all I know, the  ""secret"" documents shown might also be falsified; we just have no  way of knowing. Everything brought forward is treated in such a positive  manner, making it all look highly suspect. Moore circles around the same  questions time and again, only presenting them differently through-out the  90 minutes. -Way too long, the whole subject matter could've been dealt  with in 45 minutes and you wouldn't have missed a thing.

1057698,5,630568524X,"The only real problem with this piece is that it fails to draw the parallels that more recent documentaries and series have to other Megalithic civilizations of the same time period, 10,500 years BPE, and before.  Unfortunately, none of the newer documentaries reference some of the information revealed here.

The two primary pieces of UFOlogy presented in this documentary are the crashed UFO, which I have seen elsewhere, and I believe is the Russian Roswell.  The film-clip they showed was only a part of what has become available, and there is more that shows the excavation of the UFO and its removal...of course, to parts unknown.  Just as the US has Dulce and it's nearly unfathomable network of connections, I'm sure Russia has the equivalent, as does China, and possibly, India.  If the object in the video is fake, it is so true to every filmed saucer image that it is amazing, and there would be no point in hoaxing to that extent.  This appears to be about the size of the Roswell crash(es), and, although larger saucers have been seen and photographed, is absolutely classic.  I photogrphed one over Denver without knowing it in 2005.  In one frame, you can see a passenger jet in its vicinity, and it appeared larger than this, but slightly smaller than the jet.

The other really intriguing part was the excavation of the ""tomb of Osiris.""  If there is still a ""Chamber of Knowledge"" beneath it, in this lifetime, at least, in Zahi Hawass', we will never see it.  Unfortunately, alternate archaeology destroys the myths and incongruities of the official Egyptian archeological lies.  The Cold War did nothing for the general dissemination of knowledge on many levels, and if only a fraction of the evidence we have now is true, we have all been mislead incredibly over the past 60-70 years.  Bits and pieces such as this come out, and several very logical scientists such as Carmen Boulter, Robert Schock, Philip Coppens, Giorgio Tsoukalos, Robert Boval, even Erich von Daniken, Jonathan Young, David Childress, and many highly competent and credentialed engineers and stone masons, as well as investigators such as Bill Birnes have ripped traditional archaeological theories to shreds.  This may be a small, but important part of an emerging truth.

Just the fact that the human brain-size has tripled in less than 200,000 years, the larynx is unique in the animal world, partly due to a unique part of human DNA called VOX-something (Sorry. CRS!) and the simple opposable thumb make humans unlike any other animal, the first two attributes not seen in hominids until modern humans appeared.  Once these creatures had evolved, it would have been time to teach them...the Megalithic period.  That makes the alien mummy and the time-structure in this piece just about perfect.

I do have some issues with the ""alien abduction"" segment, simply because it actually does seem as if it was at least partially staged, and some of the video shows better resolution than I believe was available to consumers in 1985.  If it is a verifiable historical event that a bus-load of people completely disappeared without signs of struggle or violence, I wouldn't be overly surprised, but I'm not completely convinced.

Since I first saw the video of the crashed saucer, I have tried to find it again, and even a fragment, such as this shows is still very impressive.  It's too bad other parallels weren't drawn, but the documentary is consistent on many levels with more recent pieces and research.  There is so much that is suppressed.

As an aside, Season 3 of UFO Hunters was not released in the US, but it was in Europe and elsewhere.  I had to purchase it and a region-free DVD player to watch it.  The reason it was not released here was the fact that episode 2, I believe, exposed some of what goes on at Duce, NM.  Guess what?  It was missing from the European version as well!  I finally found it on You Tube, but that gives you an idea of how far Illuminati or other powers that be will go to divert attention and subvert knowledge which might edify the average person as to the depth of what we have missed and what we are missing.",1362873600,,4143,4.780898876404494

Disc one even includes a supposed crashed disc some where in the former soviet union in the late sixties. The film and the acting look like the bogus alien autopsy film. Speaking of autopsy, there is an autopsy on one of the discs. I think disc one. Also staged, also phoney and there are so called black market merchants depicted selling ""kgb ufo files"".

The worst of them is disc two, A poor take off on the ancient astronaut hypothesis.

There are people with no names and credentials making comments

and offering fake testimony. I can only conclude they were actors with fake beards, mustaches and an actress whose parents who were ""abducted"". One ""film expert"" had nearly no russian acccent at all. I could go on and on but I have wasted enough time on these discs already. They lack any credibility.
