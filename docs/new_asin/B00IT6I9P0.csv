6292532,1,B00IT6I9P0,This is an ultra low budget by Asylum Films that deserved to be in a 4 pack or even a ten pack offering. This is not feature material. Asylum gets 5 stars for effort but Cowboys vs. Zombies is one of their poorest products. The script is bad there is a lot of non-zombie violence that is not entertaining. Zombies show up way late. There are a couple good zombie effects later in the movie but nothing special. They can do better than this and have in their other movies.,1421107200,2,471,4.2444444444444445

6292535,1,B00IT6I9P0,"OMG! People!!! Please listen to me.  For the love of God, don't buy this movie.  I haven't been robbed like this since the IRS got me on April 15th.

To be perfectly clear, there are no cowboys in this movie.  I thought there was going to be cowboys.  You know, like from the old west back in the 1800s.  But there wasn't.  What you get are some freaks from what looks like a town in West Virginia where you're too afraid to stop for gas for the fear of hearing banjos.

The dialogue was harsh.  I felt embarrassed for the actors.  The zombies (if you could call them that) took forever to show up.  And when they did show up they looked more like escaped mental patients.

I'm moving this movie to the top of my list...  The Worst Movies Ever!",1402617600,3,744,4.191489361702128
6292536,1,B00IT6I9P0,"Shadroch (Michael Sharpe) is a death collector in what appears to be an anachronistic western society. He survived the nuclear holocaust by making a deal with the devil. At the Wail of the Banshee saloon, in the town of Celestial, he waits for the man he is ordered to take. When he refuses, hordes of zombies are released upon the town.

I haven't seen a really good western zombie film to date. This one is no exception. The film has a lot of scenes where guys with dirty faces talk tough. There were plenty of zombies, but nothing overly special. At one point he is on top of a vehicle shooting at the zombies below trying to get up at him. His shots seemed useless as the director couldn't co-ordinate the gun fire with someone falling down.

This one doesn't past the smell test.

6292537,1,B00IT6I9P0,"Hard to pick one reason.  Not guilty of bad acting, but over acting all over the place.  The supposed anti-hero looks angry all the time.  No redeeming qualities -- drinks milk??  They way over do a bully scene at the beginning and really over play the scene, we get it he's a bad guy.  The plot is that a man has sold his soul to the devil and now he must travel the west killing evil doers from a list provided him by one of the devil's collectors who collects their souls.  The collector rides a pale horse and is followed by slow moving, twitching zombies.  When he fails to kill the evil bully at the beginning, the collector sets the zombies loose on the town or rather the saloon folk.  He is not doing so to save the town people but rather just to go against the collector.  He does a good job of getting most of the town people killed. In the ensuing battle he does head butt a giant zombie again and again until he crushes its head.  Yeah I know!  Cowboys vs Zombies The Devil's Crossing -- just let them cross and go away.  Park a few old trucks around a old ghost town, turn on the fog machines, hire people to play zombies, and film in the saloon - you've got the set.",1401494400,3,1181,4.131578947368421

8645233,3,B00IT6I9P0,"Maybe its because I lived in the town where and when this was filmed. So its kinda special to me. Now does NOT take place in the""old west"". Rather that AFTER the end of the world people had to go back to the old west ways. Hence the more modern clothes. Is it a great movie.....no. But it aint that bad. Its a different take on zombie movies for sure.",1517356800,,351,4.0285714285714285
