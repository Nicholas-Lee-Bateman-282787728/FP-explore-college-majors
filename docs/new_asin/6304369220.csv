855944,4,6304369220,"Well, our friends at Troma have done it again.  ""Combat Shock"" is a grimy, unflinching look at the effects of war that left me feeling unclean.  In a word, I loved it!  Definitely not for the faint of heart, this depressing little gem is like a wart on the rear end of the movie industry which, when you think of it, is really saying something.  The entire cast looks like they were found standing on line waiting for unemployment checks back in 1974.  I found it much more enjoyable than dreck like ""Saving Private Ryan.""  Loses one star for depressing the hell out of me.",987724800,3,573,4.40952380952381
855945,5,6304369220,"Forget Henry Winkler in HEROES, Jon Voight in COMING HOME, or Stallone in FIRST BLOOD. If any film released by the notorious schlock distributor  Troma has a claim to art, this is it. I'm not kidding. This  Vietnam-flashback psychodrama, probably the most savagely depressing film  ever made, brings you inside the splintered mind of a 'Nam vet and never  lets you out. (In the few scenes having nothing to do with him, we see guys  even worse off than he is.) The film is best described as a cross between  ERASERHEAD and the last two hours of THE DEER HUNTER. Frank Dunlan (Ricky  Giovinazzo) has blocked out his painful memories of combat - captivity,  torture, atrocity, the works - but they keep creeping up on him. Unskilled  and unwashed, he can't hold a job. This annoys his wife Kathy (Veronica  Stork), who must take care of their baby - which has been mutated by his  exposure to Agent Orange. Frank spends his days standing on unemployment  lines, avoiding loan sharks, and hanging out with heroin addicts. This is  the best Harvey Keitel/Abel Ferrara movie they never made; if you  appreciated BAD LIEUTENANT, you've got to see this. The last reel (if  you're still with it by then) will leave you in a sickened stupor.  Sometimes low-rent and amateurish, but it gets under your skin in ways that  a more polished movie never could. The DVD includes often amusing  commentary by director Buddy Giovinazzo, always eager to goof on his own  movie; he's not one of those gasbags who go on and on about how brilliant  their film is and what every scene signifies. NOT FOR EVERYONE! - but an  unforgettable ride for those who feel that movies should be more than Tom  Hanks acting cute.",964396800,14,1694,4.671186440677966
855946,5,6304369220,"Boy, is this a downbeat movie. If you're looking for something redemptive, look elsewhere. From the opening Vietnam sequence full of gore to the sorrowful conclusion, Combat Shock is a nightmarish trip through a warren  of haunting images and sounds.
Frankie came back from  Vietnam and has  had nothing but trouble. He has a deformed baby, a nagging woman, and no  job. He is also in dutch with a loanshark. Frankie walks the desolate  streets of the slums, wondering what he's going to do. He eventually  explodes in a fit of despair and rage, resulting in some bloody and gory  scenes.
What makes this movie so effective is the voiceovers and the  flashbacks of Frankie. They are truly haunting and they give the film great  atmosphere. So do the settings, especially Frankie's apartment, which is so  gritty and sleazy looking that I felt like taking a shower after watching  the movie. It's that sleazy!
This movie will bring you down, so don't  watch it on a rainy day or if you're depressed. If you aren't exhausted at  the end of the film, there might be something wrong with you. This is  distributed by Troma, so look for some nifty trailers. Also, pay a little  more and avoid the Extended Play tape.",959126400,10,1211,4.672985781990521
855947,4,6304369220,"Combat Shock is a very low budget Vietnam Vet revenge flick in the Death Wish mold. It is both insightful in its presentation of a man bordering on madness and relentless once the madness takes control. The film has many  disturbing images of violence as well as an agent orange infected baby, all  graphically displayed. The DVD presentation is excellent and includes audio  commentary by the director. This is the best feature of the DVD as it  explores the intricacies of producing a decent film on virtually no budget.  While I recommend this film, I am not sure if most will need to view it  more than once, if at all. Buy at your own risk but try to see it once.",958867200,,668,4.434426229508197

Just because it associates the main character with the Vietnam War doesn't make this sorry excuse for a film worth considering.  Troma movies were never meant to be anything more than sheer, mindless junk to ridicule and make fun of, and saying COMBAT SHOCK is the studio's masterpiece is like saying DEEP INSIDE JENNA LYNN is the CITIZEN KANE of porn.

856183,5,6304369220,"This is not a polished big budget film with wonderful acting so do not expect it to be. That aside, it was like watching an extreme dramatization of my transition from the US Army Paratroops to the civilian nightmare I had returned to on the north shore of Staten Island during the 1970's. Way too close for comfort! I walked the same Port Richmond streets, the same fields, the same train stations. Avoided unsavory people like the nasty ones in the movie. I stood in the line at the same unemployment office, the clerk told me about the same lines in real life that the clerk character spoke. Obviously I didn't do up the same finale as the main character did. But the thought......and I knew other vets back then and there who didn't make it....this movie is entirely disturbing. I cannot say I think this is a great film. However, I lived a good part of it, and it reminded me how bad it was then and how fortunate I am today for surviving and thriving.",1394928000,,957,4.4124293785310735
856277,4,6304369220,"One of the strongest post-Vietnam movies I have ever seen. Like an unofficial sequel to Coppola's Apocalypse Now, the movie starts off with a nightmarish dream sequence that eventually passes over into a real nightmare. This is a slow-paced journey into poverty, misery and the psychological scars that mark the survivors of the horrors of war. With every frame, the situation grows worse for the people in the movie. And up until the ""grand finale"", you find yourself wondering when hell will break loose.

It must be pointed out that this is a low budget production. But with every dollar missing, the crew have managed to add feeling. This is a strong movie, and you'll either love it or hate it.",1386201600,,699,4.776859504132231

Would not recommend this to anyone that is easily offended or suicidal. A true low budget masterpiece.",1374019200,,405,4.139240506329114
856279,5,6304369220,"There are a few 1980's cult movies everyone has seen or knows about i.e.,Street Trash,Slime City,Basket Case and Combat Shock is at the top of the list. What was essentially a student film over time became a masterpiece and the greatest movie Troma ever distributed! The story of Frankie Dunlan is a depressing and ultimately shocking one involving the everyday routines of a damaged veteran living in a reality that is hell. Join Frankie as he navigates the streets of Staten Island desperately seeking employment to feed his wife and Agent Orange infected son. Filmed in beautiful 16mm Buddy Giovinazzo's Combat Shock is a favorite among fans of cult movies during the Reagan era. This is a disturbing movie with an ending that still gives people nightmares!

856280,3,6304369220,"Combat Shock is the second Buddy Giovinazzo film I have watched and it reminds me alot of Eraserhead, as well as Jacob's Ladder and Taxi Driver, along with the other Buddy G film I have watched, Life is Hot in Cracktown. In fact, the phrase ""Life is Hot"" originated in this film! Anyway, the film itself is incredibly dark, depressing, and downright disturbing, but certainly not the most disturbing film I have ever watched. It clearly was inspired by Eraserhead, although the Taxi Driver similarities could possibly be coincidental. Anyway, I didn't particularly enjoy it, mostly because of how bleak it was, I feel that the world we live in is off two polar opposites, it can incredibly light, euphoric, and joyful, and it can be incredibly dark, hellish, and painful. Combat Shock only showed the darkness and never the light and because of that, I can't appreciate it. You could argue that the main character, an oddly likable character who despite being surrounded by lowlifes and scumbags is that light, as he tries to lead a decent life, at least at first anyway, eventually towards the end he starts to succumb to a life of crime as he begins to lose all hope. However, if it is a light, it's a dim one, and one that flickers out completely towards the end. I honestly enjoyed Eraserhead more, as well as Jacob's Ladder and what little I have seen of Taxi Driver, as they all were far more interesting, creative, and original than this film. Although I will admit I did enjoy some scenes, as well as some characters, like the wife, and that gangster guy with the oriental looking bandanna. As for the deformed baby, which is clearly a cheap parody of the baby in Eraserhead, I'm not sure whether it was supposed to be darkly funny or scary but it seemed like a bit of both. Anyway, I don't suggest buying it, although it's good for a rental I suppose, if you're into films like this.",1370476800,,1892,4.600591715976331
856281,1,6304369220,"No, I am not sure why most reviews praise this flick. Mental cases are nothing new and if you connected them to war its nothing new either. What should be new is who is responsible, who was punished and how to avoid this in future and all of this is missing. 30 years after Vietnam history is repeated and I never seen anybody to protest or give us way out. And it means nothing changed. Lousy. We behave like everything is allright.",1367020800,4,433,4.2926829268292686
856282,5,6304369220,"The history of this film is a bit confusing and despite the fact that other reviewers have already discussed this I feel it deserves repeating. For the past 25 years fans of underground horror films, disturbing indie films, cult classics, etc. have referred to this film as both AMERICAN NIGHTMARES(those of us who saw grainy bootleg VHS copies in the 80s often saw it under this title) and its eventual domestic release title COMBAT SHOCK. The two versions ARE different. Quite substantially different actually. Which is why when Troma released this 25th Anniversary 2-DVD Edition it literally made me jump for joy! Finally, both versions (Buddy Giovinazzo's Director's Cut: AMERICAN NIGHTMARES and the theatrical cut: COMBAT SHOCK)can be viewed and examined side by side, something which only enhances my belief that this film(despite which version you view) is easily one of the Top 10 underground/indie films of the 80s and is arguably the blackest, bleakest, most disturbing indictment of Reaganomics-era America ever made. Despite its low budget, AMERICAN NIGHTMARES is an artistic masterpiece, albeit horrifying beyond belief. This is one instance where a film TRULY lives up to its reputation! The story of a poverty-stricken Vietnam veteran with severe PTSD(Post Traumatic Stress Disorder), his wife and deformed, mutated Agent Orange effected child trying to survive in the wastelands of urban America is unrelenting and unforgettable. This is NOT an exploitation film! Director Buddy Giovinazzo(who also wrote the legendary book ""Life Is Hot In Cracktown"" which he eventually made a successful film version of) had a lot to say about 80s American society. In many ways this film was SO ahead of its time in regards to dealing with the issue of AMERICA's post-Vietnam PTSD and the joke and distraction which was Reagan's vision for America. Unfortunately, this film will NEVER receive the respect it deserves because it is just too shocking. This is the ONLY film I have WARNED a person about before viewing. Once you view it, you will NOT be able to forget it. It is NOT just some FUN gore movie...which is exactly why I feel it stands so tall as an artistic achievement. In its stark realism and unrelenting horror this film has a similar vibe to HENRY:PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER or Jim VanBebber's short film MY SWEET SATAN as well as moments of his classic DEADBEAT AT DAWN. COMBAT SHOCK's unrelenting realism is also very similar in tone to VanBebber's THE MANSON FAMILY. Also, Lustig's 1980 classic MANIAC comes to mind particularly in its visual tone(both MANIAC and COMBAT SHOCK being shot in NYC or New Jersey slum districts). But NO DOUBT, COMBAT SHOCK/AMERICAN NIGHTMARES is its own film and highly original! From the editing to the creepy narration to the amazing urban landscapes, to the unforgettably disturbing conclusion, this film is truly an AMERICAN NIGHTMARE! Thankfully, it is finally available with tons of additional material including an excellent documentary and several other Giovinazzo short films, remastered, and through this release may inch closer towards gaining a long-lasting respect as a classic underground film.",1337990400,,3159,5.196078431372549

The film is the only Troma team film that has been released that I actually liked. Most Troma films are goooofy but this one is no nonesense psychologicaly terrible. The film is about a scout in vietnam that ends up becoming a P.O.W. and is addicted to heroin while he is overseas. When he finally makes it home everything is going wrong in his life. Such as bitching pregnant with second child wife in which their first son is a mongoloid, and theres no food in the apartment they live in, in Staten Island N.Y. Plus the toilets broke and no running water. So the main character goes on the street trying to find work and food or anything to make ends meet, but he cannot get a break. Finally he snaps and after the breakdown everything goes to hell. He completely loses it and a bloody onslaught ensues. But the last 10 to 15 minutes is as morbid and vile as you can imagine. Lets just say its better not talked about on here, so you will just have to watch. The ending is somewhat like Taxi Driver with De Niro but about four times as worse. Rick Giovanzzo really gives a gr8 performance as the maddening war vet. Actually this is my favorite horror slash war film slash suspense pic I have ever seen. Oh yeah its pretty grotesque and macabre.",1314316800,,1550,5.011627906976744

Shambling through a desolate urban wasteland (NYC), Frankie searches for a means of survival, while trying to fool himself that he has a reason to keep living. At ""home"" is a pregnant wife and a mutant baby (agent orange?), whose incessant, synthesized crying is both haunting and utterly annoying (think ERASERHEAD)! Frankie tries everything, finding nothing. No help. No hope. COMBAT SHOCK is not for anyone who insists on happy endings. You will not find one here! However, you will see a tremendously bleak, dire portrayal of a man taken past his breaking point, and into oblivion...",1281484800,3,813,5.2615384615384615
856286,4,6304369220,"A returning Vietnam Vet approaches mental collapse as he tries to readjust to a jobless post-war America. He is faced with haunting memories, squalid living conditions, a nagging wife, and extreme poverty, when he finds it impossible to keep it together. Like Bob Clark's DEATHDREAM, COMBAT SHOCK is a biting critical response to the way America discarded its Veterans following the withdrawal from Vietnam. While the production values and acting may not be as polished or professional as Clark's film, the dark tone and disturbing realism have an immediate impact on the viewer. Giovinazzo's gritty filming and dilapidated cityscape are both reflective of Frankie's debilitating mental state, creating an external mirror to his inner anguish. It is impossible to avoid making comparisons to THE DEER HUNTER or TAXI DRIVER, since the film draws heavy influence from both, but it still manages to establish its own unique voice through Frankie's depressing performance. The horrors depicted in COMBAT SHOCK are inescapable. It is a brutal portrayal of one of America's darkest moments in history, and it is as shocking as the title entails.

856358,5,6304369220,"This is another movie that did not get the budget it deserved. Impressive details about it's makers can be found elsewhere, including the disk extras.

Another sociological study that uncovers and exposes one of those hidden truths that have yet to be understood by the population that these great soldiers fight and die for.

It aptly demonstrates that in too many cases, the real destruction and defeat of the fighters for freedom is the loss of their own. It then goes on to unearth the question of the public's true loyalty to the men and women that sacrifice their lives for a cause they hardly have a chance to understand.

These men and women never had a chance to choose their enemies, much less to know why (if for any reason at all) they must, in the minds of those with no conscience forfeit their chance of a normally integrated life. I would argue that honor should be upheld, and enforced if necessary.

856359,5,6304369220,"Combat Shock is a no-budget film directed by Buddy Giovinazzo released under the Troma label. I've never watched a film by Troma, but I know what films they're associated with. When titles from their company include The Toxic Avenger and Tromeo & Juliet, I didn't expect much from Combat Shock and it took me a while to get around to watching it. It's a surprisingly well-made film that is both bleak and effective...Think of Taxi Driver without a budget and with even less optimism.

Ricky Giovinazzo (who also did the score and went on to be involved with the scores of just about every film you can name) stars as Frankie Dunlan, a Vietnam veteran and former P.O.W. living in squalor in New York. The film opens in Vietnam as Frankie talks of the nightmares that haunt him every night. He lives with his wife and child, who is hideously deformed due to the chemicals he was exposed to in Vietnam; he has no job and can't afford to feed himself or his family and he owes money around town.

The film works quite well in it's strange, low-budget way. Frankie's baby doesn't look human (it conjures up memories of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eraserhead/dp/B00003CWPL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eraserhead</a>), but it doesn't look laughable either. I found the film's score to be too '80s, but it actually fits the tone of the film. Obviously, Hollywood was fond of Giovinazzo's musical skill.

The film has the grainy, gritty look of a cult film but Combat Shock actually has a relative impact. It's a dark story with a few scenes (most occurring at the end) hat are incredibly unsettling. Certain aspects of the film aside, there is a certain amount of realism in the film too...Combat Shock is a film that will surprise you. It looks and feels like an exploitation film, but works as a gritty, violent, and disturbing look at post-traumatic stress disorder. It's an uncompromising film that you won't easily forget.

His pleas for help consistently fall on deaf ears.

It's a gut-wrenching experience to watch this movie. It explores the psychological aftermath of war in ways that other films don't.  There's nothing upbeat in it.

I have never been a Troma fan.  So for those of you that are in the same camp - you are safe with this in regards to this being Tromaesque.

Gore hounds steer clear as there really is none in this.

I will start off with the one negative note which is based on my personal opinion.  The music at times was 8-bit video game fluff which I found distracting at times.  But for the most part the synth score remained ominous and droning.

Combat Shock is cold, gritty and depressing.  The no budget adds to the realism as they worked with everything they could muster up.  The cries of the baby are still ringing in my ears.

Just like Kids was important viewing for the 90's, Combat Shock tells a tale of Urban slums in the 80's through out America.  It still bears relevance today.

If you want a movie that will make you pause and think of where we were, where we are and whats ahead without glitz and glammer, this is a dark trip that will leave you feeling empty yet somewhat satisfied.

856366,4,6304369220,"COMBAT SHOCK (1986)
directed by Buddy Giovinazzo
approx. 1 hour 30 minutes

At the beginning of Combat Shock, we see the main character Frankie as he scuttles through the wilderness in Southeast Asia.  He is being tracked by locals with weapons and has to watch his every move.  The young soldier Frankie is so paranoid that he sees an unarmed woman as a potential threat and empties his bullets into her torso.  This horrifying act leads to his downfall and will haunt him for the rest of his life.

Things don't improve for Frankie when he comes back to the States.  He's married to a nagging woman who caused him to be estranged from his father.  Due to Agent Orange, Frankie's son was born resembling a strange alien.  His home in Staten Island is dirty looking and the neighborhood is rampant with prostitution and junkies.  The man behind these ills is a local thug named ""Paco"" and unfortunately Frankie owes him more money than he can repay. Nobody is hiring and he doesn't have any idea how to get the cash, so he ""walks the streets like a zombie"", seeing the horrible conditions around him.  Every now and then, his mind flashes back to his experience in the Vietnam war.  Piece by piece he recalls what happened over there, and eventually it begins to affect his mental well being.

This is not the usual Troma style of movie with slapstick puke and blonde T & A.  Even the graphic violence is uncharacteristically restrained, excepting one sequence which I won't give away.  It is low budget, but it is well made.  It has been compared to 'TAXI DRIVER' due to the totally misanthropic themes and loner main character.  It is NOT a movie that I would watch with anybody you care about.  It is bitter and depressing and it is easy to imagine something like this happening in real life.

The scenes with the baby seem like pretty direct references to 'Eraserhead'.  One piece of trivia: the music is composed by the actor who plays Frankie (he is also the director's brother).  Also, avant-garde musician Phill Niblock was a consultant for the movie.

If you really wanna bum yourself out, Troma recently released a 2DVD set which includes alternate cuts of the movie along with interviews with the director.",1245283200,2,2217,4.662371134020619

Like an unofficial sequel to Coppola's Apocalypse Now, the movie starts off with a nightmarish dream sequence that eventually passes over into a real nightmare. This is a slow-paced journey into poverty, misery and the psychological scars that mark the survivors of the horrors of war. With every frame, the situation grows worse for the people in the movie. And up until the ""grand finale"", you find yourself wondering when hell will break loose.

It must be pointed out that this is a low budget production. But with every dollar missing, the crew have managed to add feeling. This is a strong movie, and you'll either love it or hate it.",1243296000,,699,4.776859504132231

Anyways, to top it all off, they have a deformed little mutant baby(Eraserhead-esque?)  Frankie tries to get a job, gets mixed up with drug dealers, and his lifereally goes spiraling out of control.
Along the way there are some pretty horrific moments of murder, torture, drug use, pre-teen prostitution...quite a lovely little jaunt.  It's pretty high up on the disturbia scale, if that's your thing.

That is, a film portraying the lowest, most bereft state of humanity. Seemingly, this work is done as well as humanly possible with the funds at hand. In it's basic from, it portrays an ex-VietNam vet who loses his marbles, goes bananas and does something really bad. Certain scenes made me squirm in hideous disgust. That's good. It worked. Right up there with ""Plan 9"" but 10 times more violent and depraved, this one is a classic.",1184198400,,598,4.546296296296297

He searches for a job to support his family as he starts to work as a drug dealer with a gang if he can get the money that he owes them and one day he goes insane.

A disturbing, bleak and interesting action horror drama that mixes three genres into one strange yet very good movie and it's also a character study. It's truly one of Troma's most serious movies, the film does center around the tragic character and contains quite a dose of drug use and gore with shocking moments, this cult flick is one of the most underappreciated films of the three genres that i recommend.

The DVD has good picture with slight grain sometimes and good sound quality with fine extras like the theatrical trailer and trailers to other Troma flicks, audio commentary, an interactive tour of the Troma building, Troma intelligence test and Troma comic samples.

It's an hour and a half of some skanky dude that can't act walking around New York. WOW! Then in the last 3 min's of the movie he kills his whole family and then himself. This movie has no point.

856495,4,6304369220,"""Combat Shock"" is one of the most depressive movies I've seen. It's so pitch-dark and hopeless you physically begin to feel sick. The main character Frankie is a Vietnam vet who lives in a small flat near a railroad with his always-nagging wife and a mutant baby - because the troops in Vietnam were exposed to some chemical weapons. Frankie has no job, every day he just idly wanders the neighbourhood. His family lives in extreme poverty, they are about to be evicted, they have nothing to eat, and the mutant baby is crying all the way. God... When I was looking at that baby I wanted to turn off the film and watch some comedy instead. My mood was rotten for the next few days. But I was truly amazed by the movie in general. Shot on a very tight budget, it impresses like nothing else I've seen. I didn't have a chance to see other works of Buddy Giovinazzo, but he demonstrated immense talent in this feature. After such films you start to value your simple ordinary life and realise you're utterly happy.

""Combat Shock"" is a one day in life of Frankie, and during this day he descends deeper and deeper morally and emotionally right before our eyes. The climax would be just insane, I nearly had a desire to take a bottle and get drunk - to forget the last hour and a half of my life. Now, looking at the movie with a fresh eye I understand it's one of those hidden gems everyone should get acquainted with - it's really different. And don't look it's a Troma team release - this is not a usual Troma presentation. I guess it's their best edition ever.",1139270400,5,1560,4.379310344827586

856618,5,6304369220,"When you buy a movie from Troma,  you would expect the usual ingredients (T&A, gross-out humor, explicit violence, bad acting).  If you're expecting that out of Combat Shock, you will be disappointed.  Combat Shock is a surprisingly great film despite its low budget.  Like other films before it, it deals with life after Vietnam.

The story centers a day in the life around Frankie, a Vietnam vet living in poverty in New York City.  He returned after being a POW for a number of years.  He has a wife, who always nags him about their living conditions and him being unemployed, and a son who is deformed due to Agent Orange.  They basically live in the slums.  To make matters worse, Frankie owes a local thug and his cronies money.  After an argument with his wife, he goes out walking around New York, disgusted with what he sees.  His journey in Vietnam will result in tragedy for him and his family.

Combat Shock was made by Buddy Giovinazzo on a low (extremely low) shoe-string budget.  The opening sequences were stock footage from Vietnam.  Even the ""battlefield"" was filmed basically in someone's backyard.  Buddy's brother Ricky starred in the leading role as Frankie and even was behind the film's score, which can grow on you in a bad or good way.  Basically, everyone who was from New York was in the film(the director himself, students from a local college in New York, people who worked behind the camera, family members, friends, etc.).

One thing that distinguishes Combat Shock from other Troma films is the film itself.  Like I said earlier, it doesn't contain the usual stuff that an average Troma fan like myself would expect from other films (The Toxic Avenger flims, Sgt. Kabukiman, NYPD, Class of Nuke 'Em High films, etc.).  It is more of a psychological film focusing on a man who is soul searching as to how he got himself into the mess he is in now.

Eveything around him is decaying (childhood friend of his is on drugs, local thug running the city, young girls prostituting).  Even the scene when he calls his father is sad as to how his life has been after returning from Vietnam.  Buddy G did a great job with this and basically created a gem that was heavily censored (and rightfully so) due to its content, particularly with the ending.  It is unfortunate that he doesn't direct films like this anymore.

Another great thing with this DVD release is the interesting commentary with Buddy G and fellow director Jrg Buttgereit.  It is very amazing that he can still remember the film being made (remember, he is a New Yorker).  After you finish watching the movie, you can just start over and select the commentary and believe me, you will not be bored.

The first time I watched Combat Shock, I felt cheated and was ready to put it on amazon.com for sale.  But looking at it again, I was amazed.  Either you like it or don't.  If you can get past some of the loopholes, you will be OK.  Just give this film a view.",1103414400,6,2949,4.581261950286807
856619,5,6304369220,"""Combat Shock"" is more raw in terms of the emotional impact it has than other films in the same vein: ""Platoon"", ""Jacob's Ladder"".  Which isn't to say it is better or even equals either of those films, but with a bit more of a budget and some of the cheesier aspects cut out, it very well could have.

The acting isn't exactly Oscar material but the mood the film creates is undeniable.  Frankie, a Vietnam Veteran down on his luck in a major way, suffers from almost hourly flashbacks to his time in the war when he was tortured after his squad was killed (or did he kill them?  this question is never answered definitively).  Frankie wakes up from these nightmares to a living one: he is completely destitute of money, he has what seems to be a mutant baby (this element of the move is so whacked out--the baby looks like a miscarried ET--that you wonder if it's supposed to be funny or sickening; it's both), and a wife who constantly nags at him to call his father who he had a falling out with in order to obtain some money at least to feed his family.

Frankie is essentially a good guy, but this does not last very long.  Constantly muscled by the neighborhood toughs who dress like they watched ""The Karate Kid"" one too many times, trying to help his deathly looking junkie friend Mike, and trying with no success to get a job, his mind slowly comes apart.

The thing is, it is never explained how Frankie all the sudden goes from being a solid guy (Rick Giovinazzo does turn in a fantastic performance here) to a homicidal maniac.  The timing simply isn't right.  He mugs a woman after an extremely rough day, massacres the thugs who have been tormenting him, kills his wife and bakes the baby/thing in the oven, treating himself to some rotten milk before blowing his head off.  The movie is so believable up to this point that it is actually hard to watch.

There is not an ounce of hope in this film.  Frankie is on a downward spiral from the time he wakes up till the time the movie ends and catches no breaks whatsoever.

This is not standard Troma fare, fortunately.  This is undoubtedly the best movie they ever made, which wouldn't be saying much normally, but ""Combat Shock"" stands on it's own.  If you're in the mood for an ""Apocalypse Now"" type film with a Grade Bish flavor, this is a must.",1101600000,7,2311,4.415094339622642
856620,3,6304369220,"Really dissappointed.  From all that I had read about it, I thought I was in for some harrowing naturalism.  What I got was impossible to take seriously, and therefore, not the disturbing pleasure I was anticipating.
I did get a few laughs out of it.  The opening scenes look far more like North Carolina than Vietnam. I know its a low budget, but I can only forgive so much.  The location, especially the folliage, and lack there of, was really distracting.  The performances were just horrible.  The soundtrack, evidently composed by the directors brother, is cluncky and goofy, kind of like Devo if they really sucked, and it detracts further from the intended downbeat feel of the film.
The film is not without its redeeming qualities, but if you are expecting anything transgressive, look elsewhere.  You want downbeat?  Watch Gaspar Noe's I Stand Alone.  If you want a film that is like Combat Shock, but doesn't take itself so damned seriously, watch Deadbeat at Dawn.",1081382400,4,975,4.86060606060606

856622,4,6304369220,"Despite some glaring flaws, Combat Shock is an unforgettable experience and possibly the best Troma product.  Take Scorsese, Ferrara, Bunuel(in his 'realist' phase), stir them up in a sewer and you might get something like this suicide inducer.  Shot on a used car budget in the wilds of New Jersey, this toxic little gem is widely considered the most depressing film ever made.  I might not agree, but it's pretty damn bleak and uncompromising.  The story concerns twin american bugaboos, poverty and the maltreatment of combat vets.  The almost absurdly downbeat script pulls no punches.  Considering half of all americans are three paychecks away from the protagonist's world, this will strike too close to home for some.  Most won't enjoy this grimy, gory, spin down life's drain, but Combat Shock is the type of film that Hollywood could never produce.  I, for one, wish Buddy Giovinazzo would make more movies.",1070496000,3,916,5.06

The storys about a guy who was in the veitnam war and was captured and tortured for a few mounths but later rescued. When he comes home he finds out that his life has gone bad. His wife is always nagging,His rent is due and if he doen't get the money he and his family get kicked out,His  baby is deformed and thats just some of his problems.

856626,5,6304369220,"""Combat Shock"" is one of those rare microbudget films that has a lasting impact on its viewers. Originally titled, ""American Nightmares"", ""Combat Shock"" plays like a really grimy, amateurish version of ""Eraserhead"" with a little bit of ""First Blood"" and ""Taxi Driver"" thrown in. The commentary is extremely helpful, and Buddy went on to direct ""No Way Home"" with Tim Roth. If you're expecting an over-the-top satire Troma style, you're in for a surprise. The last 15 minutes of the movie may very well blow your mind. Also, the plotline predates ""Jacob's Ladder"", which is an almost exact word-for-word descendant of this sometimes cheesy, but mostly honest film of urban decay and psychopathy in the mind of a Vietnam vet.
