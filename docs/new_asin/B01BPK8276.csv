7665169,4,B01BPK8276,"I was so excited to have some new Hammer Horror movies - well new to me. You just don't see them on TV at all. I had only seen one of these movies before I bought this set.

Some of the films are a bit outrageously awkward and funny, but you really don't want to miss them!",1462924800,4,273,3.789473684210526
7665170,3,B01BPK8276,"The films are not as strong as the previous collection (with ""The Gorgon""), but fans of Hammer will be okay with it, and the price. Surprisingly, ""Candy from Strangers"" is the best in the set. The Frankenstein film is rather tepid, but ""Creatures"" has a surprise or two, and DO NOT miss the bear scene!",1462406400,6,302,4.509090909090909

7665172,1,B01BPK8276,"BEWARE! I just received my copy of Hammer Film Collection-- Volume Two and found inside the WRONG discs. The discs are six westerns ""The Desperadoes"", ""The Nevadan"", ""Santa Fe"", ""Man in the Saddle"", ""Hangman's Knot"" and ""The Stranger Wore a Gun"" Maybe if I order the Westerns Collection I'll get the Hammer films!",1461196800,16,313,4.9245283018867925
7665173,2,B01BPK8276,"Five films not worth watching and one was, just barely.  I threw the videos away after watching.",1460764800,2,96,4.647058823529412
7665174,5,B01BPK8276,"Talk about a bargain! Six near-classic Hammer Films on two DVDs (three films on each one-sided DVD) for less than $10.

First off, the prints are clean and the sound is sharp. The trio of films shot in color (DIE! DIE! MY DARLING!; CREATURES THE WORLD FORGOT and THE REVENGE OF FRANKENSTEIN) are bright have very minimal dust or spotting, considering than none of the six films were remastered. The three B&W thrillers (MANIAC; THE SNORKEL and NEVER TAKE CANDY FROM A STRANGER) are beautifully shot and in pristine condition. These three B&W films were previously released on the Sony 3-DVD collection ""HAMMER FILMS: The Icons of Suspense Collection.""

There are no extras. Just a menu page on each disc that allows you to choose one of the three films. These are really Hammer's B movies, but they're all diverting fun--even if some of them run out of steam before the film's conclusion. Best of the lot is THE SNORKEL, which begins with a COLUMBO-like opening showing the elaborate way a man has devised to murder his wife and make it look like a suicide. Once the wife is out of the way, he has to contend with a nosey step-daughter who is sure he killed her mother. There are few twists and turns like those found in the more enjoyable Hammer thrillers SCREAM OF FEAR or NIGHTMARE  or PARANOIAC, but its a servicable, tidy, well-shot cat-and-mouse thriller.

MANIAC starts off with a bang with a young village girl getting molested and the culprit is captured by her father who uses a blow-torch for a living. Then we jump ahead four years and the movie begins in earnest. The problem with MANIAC is the opposite of THE SNORKEL--there are far too many twists thrown into MANIAC--and when its over, you have to wonder if the screenwriters actually realized that the final twist pretty much negated the reason for a big part of the film. Still, it's well-shot and Kerwin Matthews and Nadia Gray are attractive and easy to watch.

REVENGE OF FRANKENSTEIN is a direct sequel to THE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN and offers another excellent performance by Peter Cushing as Dr. F. in good period costumes and sets.

NEVER TAKE CANDY FROM A STRANGER (British title: NEVER TAKE SWEETS FROM A STRANGER) sounds like its going to be lurid but it's actually pretty thoughtful and examines a new family in a small community who call the police when their young daughter has an encounter with a pedophile (who is also the patriarch of the town's most prominent family--who employ most of the townies).  Part social issues, part courtroom drama and part thriller. Freddie Francis's cinematography is outstanding.

CREATURES THE WORLD FORGOT is a dinosaur movie without dinosaurs and without dialog.

DIE! DIE! MY DARLING! (yes, three exclaimation pouints in one title!) sounds like its going to be camp along the lines of WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE, HUSH HUSH SWEET CHARLOTTE and WHATS THE MATTER WITH HELEN? but  it's actually pretty restrained and Tallulah Bankhead (in her film film appearance) gives an excellent, modulated and convincing performance as a devoutly religious woman who invites her late son's former girlfriend to her secluded house and then traps her there. Bankhead and Stefanie Powers make a good pair who are trying to get the upper hand from the other.

You get your money's worth with this purcjase!",1460419200,33,3310,4.84070796460177

7665176,5,B01BPK8276,"Even more essential to me is this second double disc set of features from Mill Creek . I'd purchased two copies of the previous set containing The Gorgon , The Two Faces Of Dr. Jekyll , Scream Of Fear , Stop Me Before I Kill and Curse Of The Mummy's Tomb even though I own all those films culled from two collections . All but Stop Me Before I Kill I owned owing to having the wonderful Icons Of Horror Collection Hammer Films . Stop Me Before I kill was a film from the superb Icons Of Suspense Collection Hammer Films .
One purchase was for myself as I'm a Hammerhead and enjoyed having the artwork of the Mill Creek Collection as well to have additional , beautiful prints of the films (albeit sans English subtitles) as well as the brilliant price . The second set I acquired for my nephews .
The new collection promises to be just as retro delicious I'd imagine and actually contains two films I don't yet own . In Die! Die! My Darling! I'll be coming by a film I streamed but failed to obtain . Additionally , with Creatures The World Forgot , I'll be getting a Hammer prehistoric picture I don't yet own . Perhaps the last remaining of that Hammer sub category ? (I'll have to check and see) .
The other features here are all excellent and all but The Revenge Of Frankenstein can be found on that superior Icons Of Suspense Hammer Films Collection I wrote of earlier .
Whatever your reasons/reasoning , check out that cool and inviting art work in the interim",1459382400,15,1466,4.334545454545455
