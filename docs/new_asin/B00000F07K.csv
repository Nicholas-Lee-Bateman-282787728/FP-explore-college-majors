1199430,2,B00000F07K,"It's no great move movie, and for what it is gratuitous nudity would have helped, but I thought it was fun hour with judicious use of fast forward and the neighbor annoying sub-woofers.",1446163200,,185,4.636363636363637
1199431,5,B00000F07K,"This film was really fun from start to finish.  They had a great cast...very talented.  LOVED the opening scenes.  Also, it had a few unexpected twists and turns, and a very unexpected but intriguing ending.  I'd love to see a sequel to this.",1435276800,,242,4.558139534883721

Add in Zombies known as Night Runners and Day Walkers. One guy appears to be immune and human factions in conflict. Occasional grindhouse soundtrack, cardboard characters. People with various accents. A lot of talking and riding in a car. Spend the money and watch ""Mad Max..."" instead.

1199434,3,B00000F07K,"Its not a horrible flick,Yes,Derivative of a 70s genre and playing those Mockbuster games with a aussie  sounding doppelganger of a lead actor.

The cars are very cool and for not being cgi OR in a video game,They do awesome things on screen.

Liked the other lead John Freeman, He has a Robert Rusler look and was a rodeo cowboy so comes with that rugged look of Post Apocalypse naturally.

Wish they didn't use The Zombie cheat/cheap shot,Because then you sprinkle your screen with Walking Dead almost cast.

One accolade to Mark Atkins, You did it all buddy,And that is a impressive feat,No matter the results.",1432166400,3,613,4.745283018867925
1199435,2,B00000F07K,"What......did I just watch? Kind of a low budget, Mad Max with an underlying violent blood virus thing. It's not that acting or the action was intolerable but the whole thing was hobbled together so loosely that you ended up feeling like you watched parts of a movie without out an end. I've seen worse but there's nothing here for you that you haven't seen before and better..
I'm gonna recommend a pass on this one..

Other than that, I highly recommend this product to any history buff interested in WW II history, or anyone wondering why we live the way we do today.

1199438,4,B00000F07K,"This Korean War combat veteran finished the eighth grade in 1945, the year WW2 ended, but now lives with men and a few women who fought or otherwise served during that war. What stands out for me in a personal way is that though these people made possible the world in which I came to maturity, they did not grow up with the freedoms I take for granted. Some of them seem puzzled that I insist on these freedoms; a few even seem impatient.
This realization is part of what has moved me to learn about the world ""Between the Wars."" This video (in just under five hours) gave me information I had seen elsewhere but also information I hadn't seen, perhaps because historians get bored writing about events that happen too frequently--such as the diplomatic errors that led to WW2.
I say that with some confidence. I've read many histories of England covering the growth and demise of its monarchy. Only one such history said there were so many rebellions against monarchical power that historians don't bother to describe them.
Frankly, I'm happy that nuclear weapons exist. For the first time in history, those who profit from war are also at risk. They will not so easily send ordinary folk off to die.
PS. Only one history of Norman England was forthright enough to say the barons ruled by force and the bishops ruled by fraud. In how many history books have you seen that kind of honesty?",1004832000,,1390,4.586345381526105

Non existent or changing plot, no water, now no ammo no wait let's make a vaccine.......
The best part of the movie was when I was looking at the credits to see where the movie was made.
Poor acting, lack of the expected action (0 road wars), poor scripting, just another ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE SURVIVAL movie.
And really, you think they may make a sequel????",1476662400,,423,4.5064935064935066
1199531,3,B00000F07K,"...you get something like this. Not saying the movie is altogether bad, honestly, it's a worthy effort. But It's obvious that every character in the movie is very new to this ""fight to survive"" mentality and knows very little about tactics and have never handled weapons before. lets just say that the characters make a lot of mistakes and it's a wonder that they've survived for as long as they have. And that goes for the ""bad guys"", too. Other than that, it's a great looking movie. Wardrobe, vehicles, actors and actresses all looked great and the acting was good. Cinematography was excellent. A bit excessive with some choppy cut scenes here and there but little if no shaky, wobbly ""nausea cam"" (intentionally unsteady handheld camera). The rest of Hollywood could take a lesson from the camera operators of this movie.",1475452800,,826,4.865248226950355

1199655,5,B00000F07K,"This is clearly a rip off of the Mad Max series of films with Mel Gibson. However, now add in Resident Evil or Walking Dead style horror and you get this movie. Earth is now a wasteland with little water and food is scarce. Humans are forced to gang up on each other just to eat and drink! However, now a new global threat ensues. Resident Evil and Walking Dead fans will love this! Vampire/zombies and not the slow moving types either! Finding gas, oil, and food/drink now are the least of humanity's concerns! Fast paced Mad Max style chases with Resident Evil/Walking Dead style horror is what this movie CLEARLY delivers! ACTION personified! This film is unrated but I would give it a rated PG-13.

Mad Max was not the first of its kind either, but one of the first, so a movie like this made almost 40 years later can't be expected to be innovative.

Ended up not being as basic as I expected and was a good run and the production was good as well.  Not every film needs to be a AAA production to be enjoyable and people need to remember that.  I do not say that as an excuse however but that films should be taken as the scope they are produced within and this one does just fine.

Chase scenes and any combat take up about 5% of the movie. while slow walking and talking takes up the other 95%. all car chases and even any driving at all is done at a maximum speed of a blistering 25mph. As for the acting, it is horrid. The budget is so low they likely just grabbed anyone who was willing to work for "" Exposure"". As a huge fan of the Apocalyptic Road Warrior genre I liked the vehicles. Its likely these weren't built by the producers but on load from the people who built them for wasteland weekend out in Nevada.
