Announcement of 2007 A&E Premiere:

THE A&E NETWORK SPECIAL PRESENTATION 9/11'S TOXIC DUST PREMIERES THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 6 AT 10PM ET/PT
NEW YORK, AUGUST 23, 2007 -- While millions watched the events of 9/11 unfold on television, 40,000 people -- rescue workers, carpenters, ironworkers, volunteers -- rushed to the scene to do what they could to rescue victims and, in the months that followed, to find the remains of those who had died. Still others worked to clean the buildings or provide utilities to the surrounding areas. And even more lived and worked in the area. Now, some of these people are getting sick, some with life-threatening illnesses, and people are wondering whether there might be a connection.

The A&E special presentation 9/11's TOXIC DUST, premiering Thursday, September 6 at 10:00pm ET/PT, explores the questions around this human tragedy through the stories of four people who worked at and around Ground Zero and who are now sick as they fight their personal battles. Some are fighting illnesses that threaten to end their lives, others fight for health insurance benefits or federal funds needed to continue treatments, and still others fight for better health monitoring and treatment for those affected by 9/11.

9/11's TOXIC DUST features interviews with scientific and medical experts who discuss how the toxins in the air at ""the pile"" and in lower Manhattan could have affected the body. The program also includes an interview with David Worby, a lawyer who has taken on the case of thousands of people who believe they are sick due to the exposure to the toxins in the air after 9/11. He says he represents 10,000 sick clients, but the list of sick people may grow to the tens of thousands over the next 20 years.

Encore presentations of 9/11's TOXIC DUST will air on Saturday, September 8 at 10pm ET/PT, and Sunday, September 9 at 7pm ET/PT on A&E.",1266537600,,2086,4.878531073446328
