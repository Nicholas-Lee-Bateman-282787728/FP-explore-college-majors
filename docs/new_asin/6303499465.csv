664311,4,6303499465,"It's so unusual to see a film's hero who stutters. I've stuttered most of my life and the portrayal of film's hero, Hubie, with a stutter was refreshing. Children will love this movie. The music while not memorable was pleasant enough. But to see Hubie's determination to win the love of  Marina is a good lesson to all children that persistence pays off in the  end. I hope that as a result of the film children will be more accepting of  children who stutter as a result of this film...",948412800,3,488,4.4

664415,4,6303499465,"This is a fun little romance movie by Don Bluth, from a time when a cartoon movie about Penguins was actually something unique. Apparently there were some production problems and the animation is a bit wonky at certain points (for example characters in the background will sometimes be stuck in a certain position where it looks like they should be moving.) and the story is pretty simple, but I enjoyed it as a child, and I enjoy it now as an adult.

664649,1,6303499465,"In the Family fun edition version of this the video was cropped ALOT. They cut tons off of the top and bottom of the image and some off of the sides as well to force it into widescreen and then transferred it poorly. It looks zoomed in/bigger than the other MGM release and has alot less picture than the other version as well. Alot of the whites glow weirdly in this release unlike in the other release.

The widescreen version is supposed to be the original footage but this was forced widescreen and they just cut it up.

If you want more picture and picture that isn't cut off from all 4 sides then go with the 4:3 release. Its got alot more picture and the video transfer is better.

The only plus about the video is its a bit less blurry and seems to have retained details a little better like on wood for example. Not really a big enough plus to be worth it in my opinion.

664704,5,6303499465,"This is a TRULY AMAZING film for anyone of any age wanting to laugh, shed a few tears, and end up smiling by the end credits.

This rendition of The Pebble and the Penguin was hand-corrected by Don Bluth and Gary Goldman in 2007 to remove gross errors caused by a company that recolored the film at the demand of the distributor, which show up in the original theater film and on the earliest VHS and DVD releases (the distributor also went on to alter the original movie by deleting scenes and characters before it even headed to the Big Screen). These are NOT the faults of Don Bluth and Gary Goldman: they so disapproved of the changes to their movie that they didn't want credit as directors due to the end result. It is a shame we will never get to see the ORIGINAL product that Don Bluth intended to go to the Big Screen in all its glory.

As an ornithologist studying penguins and raising them at our local aquarium, I critically examined the character design in this movie. The characters in The Pebble and the Penguin are anatomically accurate while combining human-like traits, and are probably Don Bluth's most creative cast... even Drake. I have many of the original production celluloids and drawings from The Pebble and the Penguin displayed on the walls of my home and office because of how endearing and personable these characters are.

The music is outstanding, and it is sad none of the tracks ever received airplay in 1995-96. Certainly the song ""Now And Forever"" is every bit as good as ""Beauty and the Beast"" and other love songs from other animated fantasy features. (Take a peek at what the soundtrack for The Pebble and the Penguin is going for - so many people want it that it is now a collector's item).

This film is one of the few hand-drawn, hand-painted animated features released in the last two decades, and is an art form dying out because of computer animation. It is a labor of love to create these types of animated films. The Don Bluth films CANNOT be compared to others (like Avatar) - that's Apples versus Oranges. Every facet of the film is human created with paint, celluloid, and drawings. Play this movie frame-by-frame on some of the scenes, and you're going to find lots of hidden characters and activities you'd never notice just playing straight through.

This is a Must-See film with the mindset that you are watching 15 actual hand-drawn and hand-colored paintings per second whiz by your eyes. Grab someome you love, or your children, and a box of popcorn. You'll enjoy The Pebble and the Penguin over and over for years to come.",1381881600,2,2580,4.6244541484716155
664705,2,6303499465,I found this movie to be very boring when I was a kid. I just couldn't keep my attention on it like other movies. The songs are not great and neither are the characters. I found the characters to be rather annoying.,1378598400,,215,4.142857142857143

664710,2,6303499465,"Although most of the people review the movie, the characters , the story-line. I felt compelled to help some people by deciding if the blu ray version of this movie is right for them. Let start by saying that I collect all of Don Bluth animated classics, but whatever opinion you have about the movie itself, I respect. Not everyone can be pleased by the story-line selected by a director on any of old times classic tales. But as a collector that buys the blu blu ray versions of such tales, I expect that at least some special restoration is done in the video transfer to be worth the upgrade. Well that restoration Sub-standard in most Don Bluth blu ray movies. The only movie that is an exception is Anastasia. Other than that, they all deserve ONE or TWO STARS for video restoration.

All Dogs go to heaven: 1 STAR
All Dogs go to heaven 2: 0 STARS (if Possible)
The secret of Nimh: 1 STAR
Thumbelina: 1 STAR
Fergully: 2 STARS
The pebble and the Pinguin: 2 STARS

664817,4,6303499465,"Seriously, how many times could they say ""Goodness Glaciers!"" in this movie? That pun does not work 4 times in under an hour. That is my main criticism of the film. Other than that it was kind of a cute kids movie. That being said though, all Don Bluth movies are extremely similar (They all have really lamesauce main female characters), and this was not his best one. The music was pretty good - the best being Tim Curry's song and the worst being the long opening sequence. If you can make it through the opening though, the rest of the movie's sweet. Martin Short and Jim Belushi provide pretty awesome voices for the characters. The animation isn't at all impressive by today's standards, but it's still charming in its own way. I remember really liking this movie when I was a kid and it was still enjoyable to watch as an adult.

664818,5,6303499465,"The main song/point of the movie is that the gift doesn't matter in this case like a ring(the pebble is really the penguins equivalent of this), it's the person themselves which is true. How shallow would it be to marry someone and spend the rest of your life with them for just whatever material items they can provide you with?

What really matters is how you both feel, how the other person treats you/you both get along, and if you can honestly with all of your heart agree to spend the rest of your life with them. Of course if you truly love them, you could care less about the other fish in the sea or what they present you. Just the one you choose to be with forever, not the pebble(what worldly they offer you) and just being with them(if your able to by-pass the perls of whatever it takes to get there).

i don't want to admit it but iam a hopeless romantic in secret. This film is a perfect example of true love at it's best!

664824,4,6303499465,"Based on the true-life mating rituals of the Adeli penguins in Antarctica, the G-rated story has the male penguins select a perfect pebble to present to his lady.  If she accepts his gift, they mate for life, much like the parody of a diamond ring for a human lady.  There are 2 discs, the 1st being the widescreen movie.  The 2nd disc includes the ""making of"" featurette, the music featurette, and 5 interactive games. It appears the making of the movie began in 1995 and was completed in 2007. (It does take a long time to do a cartoon production like this.) I give this film a 4 for the visual production and a 5 for the music.

Hubie (Martin Short) is a shy penguin and not exactly a stud-muffin, but he is a really nice pengie and he is in love with beautiful and nice Marina (Annie Golden).  Unfortunately for Hubie, Drake (Tim Curry) also wants Marina and won't take no for an answer.  Drake is the kind of pengie that thinks he is the coolest guy in town.  He is a legend in his own mind.  He is also the kind of guy you want to slap, but it would probably just turn him on.  Not my type, even if it was my week for pengies.  Attribute these emotions to the fantastic job the talented Tim Curry does with his character.

Later in the movie, we meet Rocko (James Belushi), who becomes Hubie's best friend.  The movie is not the pixar type 3 dimensional animation.  It's more like a basic flat figure, but there is excellent color, crystal- clear cartoon images, nice cartoon scenery, a great story line, and an outstanding musical score, comparable to the quality of a Broadway musical.  With original songs by Barry Manilow and Bruce Sussman, I am not surprised at the high musical quality.  Barry was also the Supervising Composer on this film.  Usually we are somewhat oblivious to the musical score of a cartoon or movie, BUT, since I am a big Manilow fan, I remained consciously aware of the entire musical score.  It was extremely well done, from delightful songs to fully orchestrated story enhancement.  It is important to note that a musical background has a direct correlation to the emotions we feel, and how strongly we feel them, in a story.  Don't miss the end-credit version of the lead song ""Now and Forever,"" sung by Barry Manilow and Sheena Easton.

Back to the film, Hubie needs the perfect pebble because the special mating ceremony time is forthcoming and he wishes upon a star.  All of a sudden, the most beautiful green glass stone falls from the sky. (Note to my crystal friends--could this be Moldavite?)  Hubie is so excited and as he rushes back to ask her to be his forever, he encounters nasty old Drake.  Drake knocks Hubie into the sea where he narrowly escapes being an appetizer for a hungry seal. (Seals eat pengies, in case you didn't know.) Exhausted, he wakes up on The Good Ship Misery, on his way to be sold to a zoo with other captive pengies and that's where he meets Rocko.  As Hubie meditates on his special green stone, which he held on to all this time, he sees visions of Marina wanting him, but being anxiously pursued by Drake, (another hint this might be Moldavite).  Hubie has just 10 days to find his way back to Marina.  She must choose a mate before the big mating ceremony.  Those are the rules in pengie land.  Hubie has 3,000 miles to go in 10 days. Can he do it?  Will Marina wait for him?  This is a cute story of love, hope, friendship and determination.  It's about going after your dreams, no matter what the obstacles.

Disc # 2
As stated above, disc 2 provides a featurette on the music (about 20 minutes).  I watched this featurette after the movie and it confirmed what I said about its similarity to a Broadway musical.  The perfectionism and hands-on commitment of Barry Manilow is evident in the end musical product.  70-100 musicians were used on the film and the orchestra from Dublin was superb.

The making of the movie featurette (about 10 minutes) discussed the painstaking process with the actors, sound effects, music.  They also talked about the importance of sound and music and showed you a scene without music and with music, so you could get a feel for how important the right music is to a scene/movie. There was a tremendous team effort on this nice family film.

5 games follow:
Hubie's Journey--teaches you facts about sea critters.

Your Penguin Twin--a personality test-which character are you the most like? (I was like Marina.  Whew!)

Trivial Escape--answer trivia questions about the movie.

Catch the Pebble--is actually a game, where you move an ice slab around and try to catch the falling pebble.

A-MAZE-ING Race--is actually a game where you move Hubie through a maze and past the seals.",1252886400,,4691,4.574340527577938

664918,5,6303499465,I have been fond of this movie since the very first time I saw it. I was really young inbetween 7 and 12 years of age when I first saw this. A word of warning even though this movie is rated g and meant for kids age 5 to ten years of age some parts off it maybe to violent and to intense for kids under the age of ten depending on what there parents or guardians think is appropriate and how easy they get startled. Can the brave penguin hobbie along with his parthner a rock horper named Rocko get back to anatrtica before his love the beautiful Marina is banished from Anartica unless she is forced to marry the handsome branwy but cruel penguin drake played by tim curry. Can hubbie make it back in time before Drake takes Marina for his bribe for his bride. A word of advice uselly I would not recommend getting this used unless it cost less than 25$ dollars our in new condition by since this dvd is very cheap on line if you don't get the family fun edition even its not worth alot infact the most they are charging for one copy with the shipping include in new condition in dvd format is $15.58. If you like this I also recommend you she Thumbalina and ig you are 13 years of age or older all dog go to heaven might be appropriate for you. There is also a two disk version of this but it's somewhat difficult to find and the special features are really little kidish like the kind of stuff you would find on a leo and stictch movie. It also was the most  expensive single movie on dvd they had in the store at the time.

The story, as thin as spring ice, focuses on Hubie, a stuttering penguin overdone by Martin Short, who has fallen for Marina, a doe eyed penguin whom he wants to present with his pebble on mating day.  Of course, Marina is eyed by the loutish brute Drake (Tim Curry) who will do anything to secure her bliss.  Hubie is mistakenly thought dead courtesy of the deadly leopard seal but he has merely been whisked away by penguin hunters who want to sell him to the zoo.  He manages to escape with tough guy penguin Rocko (James Belushi) and begins a sojourn home to save Marina from Drake's paws.  I'm not sure kids will even find themselves able to sit through this hokey and dull cartoon.",1134000000,2,850,4.559210526315789
665018,5,6303499465,"I don't know why everybody is saying how bad this film is. When I watched this as a kid (and I still do, apparently!), I fell in love with this movie as well as all of the other Don Bluth films of the 90s (Thumbelina, Rock-A-Doodle, A Troll in Central Park) that weren't smash hits at the box office like his first films. This story is funny, romantic, musically fun, and a whole lot more.

This story is true on one account, in Antartica, the male penguins would go searching for pebbles to give to the female penguins they love during the mating season. If she accepts it, they mate for life. This is said by the narrator (Shani Wallis, Oliver!) at the beginning of the film. Then, it begins to go into song with ""Now and Forever"", introducing the main characters, Hubie and Marina. Hubie (Martin Short, Treasure Planet, We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story, The Prince of Egypt, Jungle 2 Jungle) is a shy, sort-of-clumsy, hopeless romantic penguin, who is love with a beautiful girl penguin named Marina (Annie Golden). He dreams of talking with her and asking her to be his mate, but as I said earlier, he's really shy and tends to doubt himself too much. Unbeknownest to the both of them, another penguin loves Marina, a strong, provincial, not-to-mention-evil named Drake (Tim Curry, Ferngully: The Last Rainforest, Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas) and will stop at nothing to have her as his mate. The next day, Hubie hopelessly tries to find a pebble before the Full-Moon Mating Ceremony (that's where the penguins present their pebbles to their mates.), but ends up leaving empty-handed at the end of the day. That night, he wishes for a special pebble to present for Marina, and amazingly, his wish comes true! An aquamarine pebble comes flying out of the sky and onto earth. Hubie is very happy when he finds this, and instantly tries to find Marina to present it to her. But admist his running, Drake comes and starts bullying Hubie to give him that pebble. When Hubie refuses, Drake pushes him off a cliff, and into the waters, where a lepord seal is waiting! Hubie swims for his life, and before he knew it, he is thousand of miles away from Antartica, and on a ship, called the Misery, heading to America to be put in a zoo. Hubie is petrified at this, especially after looking inside the pebble and seeing that Drake wants Marina to be his mate. He is determined to get out of there, but not without the help of a strong, robust, and dreams-of-flying penguin named Rocko (Jim Belushi, Something About Jim, Babes in Toyland {1998 version}). Will Hubie make it back to Antartica in time for the ceremony? Who will be Marina's mate? And what about Rocko? Will his dream of flying come true?

This film is fun to watch over and over again, and that music! Wow! Barry Manilow did such a wonderful job writing the music and singing the end title song with Sheena Easton. Even Jim Belushi can sing in this film! Amazing performance with Martin Short in ""Looks Like I Got Me A Friend"".

This film has a lot of morals, two of them being extremely important. One of them is if you really put your heart and soul into something you truly love to do, you can do anything. And, if you're offering someone a gift of affection, it's not the gift, but the person offering it that counts. In other words, that person likes/loves you for being you. So, go on! Don't be afraid! Buy this film today! You'll be glad you did!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1130025600,20,3497,4.592
665019,1,6303499465,"The biggest problem with this movie is the animation.  The evil leopard seals, which eat the penguins, are huge.  The penguins are smaller than their mouths.  Then cut to a scene in the ship Misery where the penguins are one third the size of a human.  Which basically means that compared to humans these sea lions are the size of an 8 story building.  Fast forward to the scene with the submarine and the leopard seals are normal size.  Another stupid thing about this movie is that Rocco the penguin flies.  Yeah it's a kids movie, and yeah it was his dream to want to fly, but when he flies to catch hubey and marina he doesn't move his wings.  He does this quasi-superman move because he catches them with his hands as they fall off a cliff and then ascends into the sky on will alone.  It was very melo-dramatic.  I can't think of a worse movie at this time.  The reason it got one star is because there are a handful of funny one liners from Rocco.",1129161600,2,954,4.273743016759776
665020,5,6303499465,"Why is it that less than buff guys (especially when made over by Carson Kressley) get the girls?  Maybe because the buff penguins regularly threaten to feed the girl, one Marina Penguin, to the sharks or leave her to be ostracized by penguin society (much like we often treat single people) if she doesn't marry one Drake before sunset.  How romantic.  Meanwhile, Hubie, Marina's milquetoast love, goes through fire and ice to bring her a courtship pebble.  Reality check guys: That's romance.  And learning to fight for the girl doesn't hurt.  The allegories to human behavior make us realize how fundamental our most powerful emotions are.  Yes, it's silly, yes, the animation has elements of SECRET OF NIMH (and that's a plus), yes, it wanders, but kids enjoy it and adults can sit through it.  It's a sweet story.  It's all about the story...and the penguin.",1099872000,4,862,4.8493150684931505

The music in this movie is WONDERFUL and the voice acting, particularly Martin Short's Hubie, is great. A cute movie and a cute story.

665023,4,6303499465,"I began to watch this film without expecting much.  Admittedly, it does not feature the best animation, but that is not the most important feature in an animated film.  It's not the 'Lion King' or 'Dinasaur', but I don't think that it was meant to be.  The story is about a love triangle between a good-guy penguin named Hubie, his sweetheart Marina and the egotistical and pompous Drake - this penguin is willing to stoop or bully his way to any level to marry Marina, who is not very interested in him.  Hubie must beat the clock to find the most precious pebble and make it back in time, braving all kinds of weather and challenging situations in order to wed Marina. This love-triangle theme of the film was not too 'grown-up', was handled well, and is suitable for children of all ages.
The film is both sad (without being too over-the-top) and funny. The dialogue between the characters is both original and hilarious, and the film in general is very wacky, as were some of the songs.  Drake's over-the-top rendition of ""Don't make me laugh"" had me splitting my sides.  James Belushi's characterization of Rocko was perfectly fitted to his natural humour and temperament, and Tim Curry did a great job of Drake. This film is the perfect example of not expecting much from a film, but getting everything.  If you like a lot of fun, you will probably love this film.",998092800,14,1370,4.613168724279835
