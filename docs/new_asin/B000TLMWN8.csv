2906815,3,B000TLMWN8,"I liked this movie . It plays like a Raymond Chandler book or one of many movies from his books such as Farewell My Lovely, Big Sleep , Blue Dahlia and even like Basic Instinct. A guy who falls hard for his best buddy's wife. He gets set up by her and her ambition to do away with her husband and cash in on the inheritance... Emmanuelle Chriqui plays an excellent Black Widow....&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bogie-and-Bacall-The-Signature-Collection-The-Big-Sleep-Dark-Passage-Key-Largo-To-Have-and-Have-Not/dp/B000FFL2Q6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bogie and Bacall - The Signature Collection (The Big Sleep / Dark Passage / Key Largo / To Have and Have Not)</a>",1192665600,12,710,6.329896907216495

8210093,1,B000TLMWN8,"After his father's sudden death, Dave Ford returns home with his girlfriend to attend the funeral. There he reunites with former best friends Emily and Brian Nicholson, now married and very wealthy. But when Emily and Brian's unstable relationship turns violent, Emily runs to Dave for protection. Despite warnings from an old friend that Emily may not be who she appears to be, Dave can no longer resist his feelings for her. Where to start to pull this garbage apart. With stars like Luke Mabley and Matt Long this should have been better. So Predictable and if you actually take 2 minutes you have to be able to figure out the juvenile and ludicrous plot/story/ending. Not to be a male chauvinist but the 2 women cops are so awful that if they were paid to appear in this dreck they should give the money back. They were atrocious. Let's hope they never work in film again. The men lead around by their you know what films are getting old and always depict men as stupid pointless creatures as this one does.",1458777600,,1011,4.5911602209944755
8210094,4,B000TLMWN8,"I enjoyed this play. It was hard to separate Matthew Ashford's character of Michael from that of his previous ad most know role, Jack Deveraux. It was almost as if he channeled the 1988 smarmy Jack into creating Michael. Not to say that's a bad thing, it just made it difficult to separate in this longtime Days viewer's mind
There are several twists, but unfortunately, you can kind of see them coming a mile away. I tend to think if I had actually viewed this in its natural theater setting, then I would have given it five stars. Its a good story and I enjoyed it overall I recommend watching it.",1429315200,,599,4.405405405405405
8210095,2,B000TLMWN8,"Hmmm...strangely vacant film, this DECEIT. I had hoped for so much more.  The cinematography is murky and orange.  The characters pulled very little sympathy or empathy from me.  The acting is particularly lackluster, except for a bit of spark from Luke Mably, who should have been cast as the lead male. Timothy Bottoms was 'gone too soon'.  The lead female actress was, well...blah, blah, blah...who in the world would kill for this chick?  Want a good ""bad wife"" flick?  Go rent BODY HEAT.  Two stars, 1 for Luke and 1 because, oh well...they did finish the film.",1405036800,,566,4.77319587628866
8210096,3,B000TLMWN8,"Well, I wanted Luke Mably as the main character.  He is a great actor that goes unnoticed .  He was Mr. Wonderful (and handsome) in the role as Prince playing opposite Julia Styles.  I wish he could be brought backin Prince II and me with Julie Styles. They seem so much in Love in Prince and Me.. For real...",1380067200,,309,4.203389830508475
8210097,5,B000TLMWN8,"This movie maintains interest until the final frame.  Great story and acting.  Only one flaw, the law enforcement  was a stretch but necessary for the climax.",1378512000,,158,5.0
8210098,4,B000TLMWN8,"The movie is not award winning, but the story has value. Her evil ways, is shown, as the movie ends, Don't fall for the cute face or sweet (distressed) personality, you will be sorry! Why does she need to destroy peoples lives?",1259020800,4,227,4.428571428571429
8210099,5,B000TLMWN8,"Have you ever come across something that made you feel like you'd discovered a hidden treasure that no one else knew about? Well that was my feeling when I watched this little gem of a story.

The DVD is a presentation of a live stage production done in LA. The script is smart and witty and charming; the acting is first-rate; the staging is often clever. You'll feel like you have a front row seat to all the action.

The entire production is a wonderful homage to the suspense thrillers of a by-gone era. The pacing and rhythm of speech, as well as the twists and turns in the plot, will keep you entertained.  Matthew Ashford has always had the ability to play the range from cheerful and charming to chilling with ease. And that range is on full and excellent display here.

He joins writer/director Bruce Kimmel in the bonus feature commentary track, which is filled with fun and juicy behind the scenes glimpses that are alone worth the purchase price. This DVD was put together with care and attention to detail, and it shows.

I wish I could have seen the original live production, but the DVD is certainly the next best thing to being there.  Thank goodness it's around and waiting for the rest of us to stumble across and enjoy.",1229385600,2,1239,4.508928571428571
