8296092,1,B001E1J0D2,"I purchased this hoping to have some awesome images of the Hawaiian Islands.  Having been a resident of Hawaii for over three years, I can say that the music is lacking in Hawaiian authenticity.

While some of the video is good, camera person appears to have spent more time focusing on closeup shots of waterfalls and other scenery that could have been shot most anywhere.  The islands have so much more in the visually appealing department.

Watching clouds roll past on blue skies shows nothing of Hawaii.  Alone, they do present a decent image, but this is supposed to be focused on Hawaii as the name indicates.

This DVD could have been so much better.  In addition, the price for a video less than one hour is too high priced.

You may enjoy it if you have never been to the islands, but if you have been, they concentrated on areas that can be difficult to ascertain you are actually viewing a portion of Hawaii.

They did manage to capture the appearance of some of the mountains, but then it looks like they color-enhanced them.  Maybe text showing where in Hawaii you were seeing would have helped?",1239321600,,1109,4.583756345177665

8296094,5,B001E1J0D2,"I use the ""Spinervals"" workouts for interval training, but when I want to do a low-intensity workout (but have to peddle in my basement because of weather or time), this tape is great, with first-rate scenery.
The scenery varies from coastal roads, hilly major roads to quiet residential streets, to canyon-climbing roads. There is a section through a golf course and another through a ranch as well.
The tape has a 25 minute and 30 minute part, with occasional on-screen reminders to take heart rates. I use a heart rate monitor which is probably more effective. There are no voice-overs, as in the Oregon tape. The music is standard synthesizer-exercise video type which helps provide a beat.",1052006400,10,694,4.94017094017094
