He started belting out ""Dreidl dreidl dreidl"" one day and I thought he had learned it from preschool, but no, from the Caillou holiday party segment.  The songs about ""practice makes perfect"" and ""make each day special"" are great-to the point and catchy.  My 19 month-old twins also love Caillou because of this DVD.  I love the fact that there are several individual stories about winter--all nice little narratives, and Caillou is shown imagining all kinds of adventures while going about daily life. It really captures a child's imagination.",1236211200,14,630,4.805555555555555

3155991,5,B0016B6Z9M,"My three kids (ages 3, 2, and 11 mo) all love Caillou, especially my son (the two-year-old). I love that the stories are realistic, but still very, very sweet. Caillou isn't always perfect, but he tries very hard to be a good boy, and my kids are able to see him effectivly resolve the problems that he occasionally encounters. For example, sometimes his sister, Rosie, gets on his nerves, but he deals with it and moves on. One of the things that I really like about the whole Caillou series are the realistic bodies of the adult characters. They aren't drawn like Jessica Rabbit, but rather like most adults who actually have kids (a little lumpy here and there).",1232928000,8,665,4.5966386554621845

3156018,1,B0016B6Z9M,"Until now, I've never had a single complaint about my near-perfect three year old. From sleeping through the night at 6 weeks of, giving up bottles and his crib and moving to his own room - even taking baths and going to bed every night without a single complaint and potty training and reading on his own at 2.

UNTIL CAILLOU.  And I'm not joking. This isn't a joke review. This is a serious complaint.

That obnoxious little brat, Caillou, in just two episodes, has my son WHINING ""I can't!!"" to EVERYTHING he is asked to do. ""Time to get out of the tub, sweetie,"" I tell him. ""I caaaaaaannnn't."" He whines in this horrible squeal. I had NO IDEA where this abhorrent behavior came from until I caught THREE SECONDS of this horrible show on tv.

My won was watching intently and I said ""turn the tv off please."" And to my horror, he dropped to the floor, and started whining over and over ""I can't!  I can't"".

I wanted to throw up.  No shock- this horrible excuse for a television show has been PERMANENTLY banned from our home. I will tell every parent I know of this god -awful excuse for an ""educational program"".

My son has caught glimpses of sponge bob (crude), power rangers (physical fighting) and even half an hour of gremlins (not in my presence, but I found out he saw the most gruesome parts) and had ZERO reaction to these things - he didn't karate chop our house cats, or imitate any of the crude humor on sponge bob....but in a mere TWO MINUTES of ""CAILLOU"" my son immediately picked up that petulant little Bart's HORRIBLE incessant whine and his ""I can't"" crap that he spews every time he is asked or told to do ANYTHING.

BY FAR the worst children's show I've ever seen.  PBS should be paying for a professional to help me fix this behavior (and a trip to the spa to relax my nerves after listening to the whining I'd never had to deal with before ""CAILLOU"". Flat out AWFUL.

3156020,4,B0016B6Z9M,"My daughter LOVES Caillou and we watch it repeatedly OnDemand, which can be a pain when I have to put on a new one every 10 minutes or so. When my husband had to shut off the power to do some electrical work the other night, we popped this DVD (a Christmas gift from my father so I can't comment on shipping) into my charged laptop so she wouldn't throw a fit in the dark.
I was amazed at the amount of PBS commercials for other shows that run BEFORE you even get to Caillou. In fact, the DVD prevented me from skipping them by going straight to the root menu- I had to fast forward through 4-5 minute-long commercials before I got to Caillou. Ridiculous!
Once we got to the actual Caillou episodes, the DVD was fine. No skipping, no distortion of picture or sound, so in that regard, I'm very happy with this DVD because it did what it was supposed to- entertained my daughter with several episodes of her favorite show in a row.
But the commercials were too much! I hated VHS tapes because the previews beforehand were annoying, long-winded and irrelevant. When DVD's became more popular, it was a blessing to be able to skip all of that by just going to the root menu and starting your movie wherever you wanted.
When you have a toddler, commercials can be a huge pain in the butt because of their short attention spans. She originally wants Caillou, sees a commercial for something else and then thinks she wants that. Not fun for a parent.
So that's my only complaint, and I will try to find some other way of obtaining Caillou videos in the future because the PBS ones have way too many plugs for their other shows.",1374019200,,1621,4.370860927152318

The songs about ""practice makes perfect"" and ""make each day special"" are great-to the point and catchy.  My 19 month-old twins also love Caillou because of this DVD.

Caillou isn't always perfect, but he tries very hard to be a good boy, and my kids are able to see him effectivly resolve the problems that he occasionally encounters. For example, sometimes his sister, Rosie, gets on his nerves, but he deals with it and moves on. One of the things that I really like about the whole Caillou series are the realistic bodies of the adult characters. They aren't drawn like Jessica Rabbit, but rather like most adults who actually have kids (a little lumpy here and there).",1232928000,8,665,4.5966386554621845

3390515,1,B0016B6Z9M,"Until now, I've never had a single complaint about my near-perfect three year old. From sleeping through the night at 6 weeks of, giving up bottles and his crib and moving to his own room - even taking baths and going to bed every night without a single complaint and potty training and reading on his own at 2.

UNTIL CAILLOU.  And I'm not joking. This isn't a joke review. This is a serious complaint.

That obnoxious little brat, Caillou, in just two episodes, has my son WHINING ""I can't!!"" to EVERYTHING he is asked to do. ""Time to get out of the tub, sweetie,"" I tell him. ""I caaaaaaannnn't."" He whines in this horrible squeal. I had NO IDEA where this abhorrent behavior came from until I caught THREE SECONDS of this horrible show on tv.

My won was watching intently and I said ""turn the tv off please."" And to my horror, he dropped to the floor, and started whining over and over ""I can't!  I can't"".

I wanted to throw up.  No shock- this horrible excuse for a television show has been PERMANENTLY banned from our home. I will tell every parent I know of this god -awful excuse for an ""educational program"".

My son has caught glimpses of sponge bob (crude), power rangers (physical fighting) and even half an hour of gremlins (not in my presence, but I found out he saw the most gruesome parts) and had ZERO reaction to these things - he didn't karate chop our house cats, or imitate any of the crude humor on sponge bob....but in a mere TWO MINUTES of ""CAILLOU"" my son immediately picked up that petulant little Bart's HORRIBLE incessant whine and his ""I can't"" crap that he spews every time he is asked or told to do ANYTHING.

BY FAR the worst children's show I've ever seen.  PBS should be paying for a professional to help me fix this behavior (and a trip to the spa to relax my nerves after listening to the whining I'd never had to deal with before ""CAILLOU"". Flat out AWFUL.

3390517,4,B0016B6Z9M,"My daughter LOVES Caillou and we watch it repeatedly OnDemand, which can be a pain when I have to put on a new one every 10 minutes or so. When my husband had to shut off the power to do some electrical work the other night, we popped this DVD (a Christmas gift from my father so I can't comment on shipping) into my charged laptop so she wouldn't throw a fit in the dark.
I was amazed at the amount of PBS commercials for other shows that run BEFORE you even get to Caillou. In fact, the DVD prevented me from skipping them by going straight to the root menu- I had to fast forward through 4-5 minute-long commercials before I got to Caillou. Ridiculous!
Once we got to the actual Caillou episodes, the DVD was fine. No skipping, no distortion of picture or sound, so in that regard, I'm very happy with this DVD because it did what it was supposed to- entertained my daughter with several episodes of her favorite show in a row.
But the commercials were too much! I hated VHS tapes because the previews beforehand were annoying, long-winded and irrelevant. When DVD's became more popular, it was a blessing to be able to skip all of that by just going to the root menu and starting your movie wherever you wanted.
When you have a toddler, commercials can be a huge pain in the butt because of their short attention spans. She originally wants Caillou, sees a commercial for something else and then thinks she wants that. Not fun for a parent.
So that's my only complaint, and I will try to find some other way of obtaining Caillou videos in the future because the PBS ones have way too many plugs for their other shows.",1374019200,,1621,4.370860927152318
