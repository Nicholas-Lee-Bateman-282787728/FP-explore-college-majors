I was also very impressed with the look and feel of the film. Nice job Justin!",1358208000,,183,3.972972972972973
5340605,2,B009INAKFA,"Johnny (Will Chavez) is a clean cut boy who works at the fitness center. He starts to date Stephanie (Rebekah Graf) who introduces him to her brother Jesse. Jesse is a dirt biker. He has full body tats and heavy on the turquoise jewelry. He deals drugs, goes to parties, has numerous female conquests, and talks like he is from another planet. Jesse takes Johnny under his wing and introduces him to his world, one that Stephanie wants no part.

While the film has a plot, it is mostly about Johnny destroying his life. I found the film to be rather boring and pointless, especially Jesse, who is so far out of my universe, he lacked any decent frame of reference. I suppose if drug dealing dirt biking is your niche, this could rate 5 stars. Danny Trejo has a couple of scenes in the film, but clearly he is role is hyped.

Parental Guide: F-bombs, sex, nudity. Not worth a Red Box rental.",1357948800,2,890,4.420731707317073
5340606,4,B009INAKFA,"Waited a while for this to come out, was worth watching, the music is good, the acting is decent. The movie is a good representation of a lifestyle, the message is clear in terms of the consquences for poor life decisions that is reflected upon in this film. Great musical artists from kmk,dirtball,swollen members. although it is my opinion that the worst part of the movie was seeing j-king in it, dudes a lame. Thats about it 4/5 stars, watch it.",1356134400,2,449,4.555555555555555
5340607,3,B009INAKFA,"I feel that for a low budget film it was pretty well done. Fairly well written story. The acting was decent. Especially from Danny Trejo, who although has a smaller role, does great and never ceases to amaze me. Motocross superstar Beau Manley was very entertaining and pretty funny which is a surprise being that this is his first featured role in a movie. I say definitely give this movie a try before you make up your mind.",1356048000,2,426,4.4743589743589745
5340608,4,B009INAKFA,Saw it in the theater.  It is Machete meets motocross!!! I give it 4 out of 5 stars.  Might be another cult classic?,1352505600,,116,4.0
5340609,1,B009INAKFA,"This movie is an extremely poor representation of what it terms ""motorcross"". It is no way accurate of the athletes that truly participate in this family oriented atmosphere.  Motorcross athletes,  especially Pro calibur, spend every day training countless hours and eating strict diets
to enable them to endure the toughest sport out there. If you live a life such as the characters represented here you will never be known in the motorcross world because you would not survive. I have been a supporter of the motorcross world for 35 years on every level and i know from experience. Perhaps this represents another group in a similar industry. If this is the case the only thing they have in common is a 2 wheeled, motorized machine. Poorly acted, written and a sad look at drug abuse and immorality.",1452988800,,801,4.839416058394161

5340617,5,B009INAKFA,This movie was probably one if not the best motocross movie to date. It's reality driven and had some expose' qualities which give it a truly authentic feel. This is unlike any Hollywood motocross movie in the sense where the makers of this movie were quite aware of how to paint a lifestyle that has eluded filmmakers for decades.,1390608000,,331,4.627118644067797
