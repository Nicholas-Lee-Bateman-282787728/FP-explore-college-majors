6504918,5,B00LTKTIEE,"I checked this out of the library since I bought her other beginner video and it was TOO beginner -- too much talking and breaking down of the moves -- something you could do only once or twice as an introduction to Tracy.  I did the first mat workout on this one for 5 days a week for two weeks, then the second mat 5 days a week for 2 weeks and I am on the third workout.  After the two weeks I will move onto her precision toning and then plan to start Metamorphosis after.  These 3 workouts are an excellent way to get started with Tracy.  I have started metamorphosis in the past and struggle to keep it going past the first 10 days because  I found some of the moves very challenging.  I am hoping this, along with her new cardio one and then precision toning will help me through meta.  It is nice that she gives instruction, but after a few times you do not need the instruction and could do without some of the pauses and explanation.  That is where you hear a lot of complaints about meta and Tracy in general though -- no counting and no instruction.  However, once you go through it a few times, I like that she doesn't have it.  I am down a few pounds, but my clothes are looser.  Just need to work on what I am eating now!  Highly recommend this to get started with Tracy.",1416528000,20,1286,4.120481927710843

6504920,5,B00LTKTIEE,"this is the best one yet. all the others were too hard (too many reps) and the other beginners were not enough, this one suits me with 3 different to alternate",1416096000,10,159,4.161290322580645
6504921,5,B00LTKTIEE,"This is exactly what it says....a beginner's dvd.  If you're curious about Tracy Anderson or thinking about ordering her metamorphis series I suggest you pick up this dvd first.  That way if you hate it you're only out $10 rather than $50+.  The moves can be complicated but Tracy takes the time to break them down and explain them slowly.  She does not do this in her other videos.  Trust me, I own her abcentric program and it took me a couple of days to figure out the moves.  There are three workouts on this dvd and it will give you an accurate idea of what her more advanced stuff is like and the types of moves and sequences you can expect.  Will your body look like Tracy's when your done with this dvd....NO.  As I said before this is a beginner's dvd, but you will feel the burn and sweat while doing this.  I thought about passing this on to my mom but have decided to keep it for those days I just want a quick half hour workout.",1416009600,56,941,4.183333333333334
6504922,5,B00LTKTIEE,This workout is great. Quality and production were well thought out and done very well! Been doing this workout and alternating it with the new cardio one she put out and I'm loving it and the results!,1414108800,6,201,4.45945945945946
6504923,5,B00LTKTIEE,Love this workout. Found it to be very challenging yet doable. It's more difficult than her other beginner method dvd. Definitely worth the buy.,1413936000,9,144,5.041666666666667
6504924,2,B00LTKTIEE,"The video quality and instructions are the best I have ever seen in TA DVDs. Workouts are really simple and the number of repetitions are not that high. I think one can get a nice burn if one does all of them in a row, but individually, the workouts are really weak. Her voice is weird in here, she sounds as if she was recovering from a cold or so. She is encouraging and wants to explain her motive. Workouts start with some easy arm work, continues with butt, thigh and side body exercises that are totally doable. She ends with some ab work that is very very easy. It gets difficult every now and then, but since your heart rate is low to moderate, you will find it in you to finish. If you are wondering what TAM is, go aheah order and see it for yourself. You do not need to be very coordinated to do her mat workouts (unlike her cardios where your brain should be connected with your toes). I do not think you will find what you are looking for but you will overcome your curiosity...",1413676800,9,991,4.193717277486911
6504925,1,B00LTKTIEE,"This DVD is not for beginners, unless you are 18 years old. I am a 50 year old woman and found this DVD extremely difficult to do and the moves awkward. I would not recommend.",1510704000,,175,4.0285714285714285

6504928,5,B00LTKTIEE,I haven't worked out in a year and I wanted to start out taking it easy. This workout was perfect. Easy to follow and not boring. I would recommend this for beginners or those who want to get back into working out.,1498348800,,214,4.119047619047619
6504929,3,B00LTKTIEE,"I've done the first workout. It's not nearly as hard as the metamorphosis. Beginner is no joke- this is truly for those who are starting at zero. I'm at a level 1 of Jillian Michaels, so I thought this was similar, but it is far easier.",1496793600,2,236,4.1521739130434785
6504930,5,B00LTKTIEE,"I was turned onto Tracy Anderson by my sister who dose Tracy's post pregnancy DVD. These exercises are great if you are a beginner, she explains everything and three exercises broken up into sections makes it seem less overwhelming. I also recommend this dvd if you want to be strong and get some toned definition.",1494201600,,314,4.7272727272727275
6504931,4,B00LTKTIEE,Great workout but the dvd disc no longer works! I thought I bought this NEW!,1493424000,,76,4.133333333333334
6504932,4,B00LTKTIEE,"And I love Tracy Anderson. She's my favorite muscle work lady in the world. To me, she's the best out there. And this is such a wonderful beginner program for me. It's strenuous mat work but totally doable, even for an extremely overweight person, and in the first segment, which is the one I'm on, it targets the hips and side of the thighs, which is where I really need to work my muscle's critically and this program is really hitting it there big time. She doesn't do too many reps and she allows you to get used to that before moving on to the two next segments on the DVD.

Though I had to take away one star because of the arm portion. It's very taxing because it's a tutorial. Tracy does have a problem with leading. Whereas before she was criticized for not leading her routines and you just watch her and follow, and she has addressed that in her latest workouts but she's still missing the mark because now she's talking too much. So the arm portion is very taxing because it's a tutorial instead of a flowing workout. I can do it, but have to drop my arms while she's explaining. So the arm portion is harder than that of any of her other series. She need to put a tutorial in a separate segment because people don't need a tutorial every time they do the workout. I know that my baby girl will get it right, but the workout itself is grand for beginners.

And then too, this workout lacks ab work. So it really hits the arms and legs like a bomb, and it's effective. But for ab strengthening you'll need something else.",1491523200,13,1532,4.29757785467128
6504933,5,B00LTKTIEE,"The workout is great.  You don't even feel like your working out, and the time fly's by.  Lots of on the floor with kicking in this workout.  I wish I had known that when I went to buy it.  I have to practically rearrange my living room to work out.  But then I have a tiny house.  LOL.  I really enjoy the pace an flow of the workout and I would buy other workouts from Tracy Anderson.",1490400000,5,386,3.935064935064935
6504934,5,B00LTKTIEE,It's hard work but it's worth it. The only thing that I have done in the past seven years that actually shows and gives me results. I love Tracy Anderson.,1490140800,2,154,4.166666666666667
6504935,5,B00LTKTIEE,"I love this!! This is an low impact but it will work you out!! This will hit the hips, thighs, butt and ABS.
This is my second DVD from Tracy Anderson and I think she works the ABS in every move. I normally do P-90 X, treadmill, Brazilian Butt Lift and free weights",1486684800,,265,4.018867924528302
6504936,5,B00LTKTIEE,"Tracy Anderson is a remarkably good fitness leader; she does the entire routine with you, is encouraging in an un-cheesy way, and is spot on with saying either 'left' or 'right'. The music is innocuous, the work-out is intense without being impossible.",1480377600,,252,5.023809523809524
6504937,5,B00LTKTIEE,"I'm a huge fan of Tracy. Her workouts are different with any other workouts yet very effective and unique. However, the main strength I found since I've started her workouts is that they are such a time saver. I used to workout like 3 hours a day and my joints and aches were killing me so I couldn't keep up with the workouts I used to do. With her workouts, I only need like an half hour and you'll get a fantastic result. As some people might know that in order to complete total body pilates or yoga or any other workouts, you need at least 1 hour. I love doing Pilates but when I don't feel like doing it everyday, 1 hour just seems to be really long and hard to keep up.

I do 2 workouts from this dvd every night and 30 mins of her other workout that's more intense in daytime. The most noticeable part of my body is my abs. I have a strong sweet tooth and love love carbs so I couldn't get my belly shaped even though I workout hard but ever since I've started her standing abs and overall her workouts (as most of her workouts will attack your abs as well) my abs finally started to have a feminine kind of curvy shape. She's such a genius. I also love the each theme of her workout and music as well. I can see that she put whole a lot of effort to design everything to be one perfect theme. I'll definitely keep up with her workout and hope she'd release more of her dvds often! :)",1477180800,,1392,4.0618181818181816
6504938,5,B00LTKTIEE,"Great beginner's workout that breaks down  and explains all of the moves.  The pace is perfect - not too slow or too rushed.  I also like Tracy's style, she is not too chatty.",1475884800,5,175,4.242424242424242

6504942,4,B00LTKTIEE,If you've done Pilates then this workout is similar in that you have to articulate and be precise in order to perform the moves well. You will be sore in all the right places. The results take time to see BUT you will feel your body moving better. Worth it.,1470700800,8,257,4.16

6504944,5,B00LTKTIEE,"This workout is pretty perfect!!  Ive been doing Tracey on and off for a long time and this definitely one of her best DVD's to date.  Some of her work can be a bit boring (although effective) having you stare at your carpet for 20+ min. Most people I know never could finish Metamorphosis.  Also, her post partum 2 workout was to strenuous for new mother's, I pulled a shoulder muscle and adductor muscle jumping into.  I can only hope she'll make and intermediate this fun.",1465344000,4,475,4.488372093023256

6504949,5,B00LTKTIEE,"I like this video.  I rotate between this and The Method for more strength training.  Easy enough for beginners.  But you need a yoga mat.  You do a lot of floor work and your hips begin to hurt.  I was doing this workout on carpet and once you switch side, your one side is soar from the workout and now you have it pushing in the floor while you work the other leg and it hurts!  Get a yoga mat or something for cushioning!  I always follow this up with the Cardio Dance for Beginners.  Feel like a need some extra cardio with these.",1458518400,7,535,4.076923076923077

6504951,5,B00LTKTIEE,"I like these workouts for when I'm feeling tired but I still want to have done something. I know it says beginner, and I'd say that is accurate. I use ankle weights and only do the second and third workouts, sometimes both if I have the time. The second one uses a chair and is great to do while you're watching TV. The third workout involves a bit of odd positioning on the floor and requires a bit more space. These only made me sore the first time I did them, so if you're looking for something on the higher end of challenging, you may want to skip this set.",1449792000,,562,4.118181818181818

I used to be able to fit in hour long, high intensity workouts, but now I am finding I really enjoy these less intense, beginner work outs, I still get results and am much more prone to do these because I am not dreading it.  I am not drenched in sweat, but i feel like i have exercised my body.  I am 52 and used to really push myself but just dreaded work outs, now I enjoy them.  Will you loose the weight as fast? maybe not but I am happier!",1445212800,13,479,3.9072164948453607

6504956,1,B00LTKTIEE,"I really loved this workout but unfortunately I sprained my knee terribly while doing this at home.  I have been unable to exercise for months with how serious the injury is.  Both my primary care physician and orthopedic specialist said how many people they see really hurt themselves with at home workout DVD's.  The moves in the tape just put too much strain on my knee joints and I really hurt myself.  I am really disappointed because I enjoyed the DVD and the results I was getting.  I should have stuck to the post-pregnancy and avoided the injury.  Please be careful with this and make sure you pay attention to your form to avoid injury.  Especially if you are nursing, I didn't realize that your ligaments are more prone to damage while you are breastfeeding.

Oh my goodness this is just so much fun!! I had my second baby just over a year ago and I have been using Tracy Anderson's Post Pregnancy DVD with amazing results.  It is a very relaxing and quiet program that is amazing for the craziness with a newborn.  However, I am looking for a new challenge and decided to give this workout a try.  I am so glad that I did!  First of all, each of the three segments are only 30 minutes long.  Even with frequent stops to deal with my boys I can always find time in my day to squeeze it in.  I feel so great while I am doing it, I am actually a little disappointed when it is over.  It is extremely effective in creating a long and lean shape to your body.  It is definitely challenging but within reach.  To be honest, I am just not coordinated at all.  Tracy's directions and coaching are so clear that I am even able to follow along with relative ease.  I am so impressed with this video!  It encourages me to stick with it and hopefully be able to complete her metamorphosis series.  I can't recommend this DVD enough.  You need very little space to complete this program, I recommended it to my niece who is in college.  Even in that limited of space you could complete the workouts.",1442275200,5,1998,4.369565217391305
6504957,5,B00LTKTIEE,"I just completed my first beginner's mat workout with Tracy Anderson. Wow! If you are a true beginner, like me, this will turn you to awesome jelly.

6504959,3,B00LTKTIEE,"I felt like I just dropped acid and a blonde, emaciated Kim Kardashian was doing performance art on my tv to an adult movie soundtrack. Also, and I know this is shallow but I'm going to say it anyway, her physique, while lean and trim, lends an additional strangeness to the already peculiar moves. I fully expected someone to burst into my living room and tell me about the hidden camera that's been recording my unorthodox workout. I am not disputing its efficacy, I am not disputing her credentials, I'm just saying, it's hilariously strange and I can't get past it. I'll stick with classic versions of The Firm. They'll about kill you, and they're cheesy, but they work and you only feel reasonably weird doing them.",1438041600,2,720,4.677165354330708
6504960,3,B00LTKTIEE,"As a 60 year old woman with bad knees I would not classify it as a Beginner Workout.  Tracy is great for younger folks -- my niece does her program and looks fabulous, but it was too stressful on my knees for me.",1436918400,6,212,3.9302325581395348
6504961,5,B00LTKTIEE,"For beginners ? I think not !!!

6504962,5,B00LTKTIEE,"This is my favorite TA Mat workout by far. Anyone interested in her method should start with this one, and I highly suggest it even if you are familiar with Tracy already.
Don't let the beginner title fool you, it is a great toning, or muscular structure (Tracy term)workout.
3 separate mat workouts, you need a Mat, 3 pound hand weights, and 1-2 pound ankle weights. I added the ankle weights for all of the workouts just to add on some resistance- two weeks in and I already see a difference in my legs! Woot woot!",1436140800,6,516,4.385416666666667

6504964,5,B00LTKTIEE,"Great for people who want to see what Tracy is all about. Unlike her Method for Beginners DVD, which seemed to be more for people new to fitness in general, this is great for fit women who want to try something new. There is no way you won't get results if you do these workouts regularly! While the three workouts are all about 30 minutes, they are somewhat easier than her Metamorphosis series. Imagine doing Metamorphosis but she actually explains things as she goes.
This DVD is great if you want to prepare for Metamorphosis or if, like me, you are getting back into your workouts after an injury or illness.
The first and third workouts have lower body work on the floor, while the second is using a chair. I think the first and second workouts are about the same level of difficulty.",1432857600,9,790,4.493055555555555

I always wanted something like that from TA. It was too difficult for me to dive into her previous workouts and i always felt that we needed something like that. She's smiling most of the time and seems very relaxed and supportive! Some advice for beginners: Build little by little with these workouts! Do as much as you can and progress bit by bit every day! Personally by following a common sense proper diet i saw results from the first week by doing one 25min sgm followed by as much as i could from her Cardio segments,somedays i would do all 3 of them somedays just the first one! Once you master these series you'll be so glad you started and then you'll be able to follow any TA or other instuctor of your choice!

Oh and i almost forgot! I just love the background and her clothing even the music which i usually tend to hate in most workouts! Its the first workout that i felt producers really took care of all the details.",1428192000,3,1112,4.367149758454106

So far, I really appreciate the difference that Tracy brings - it's calmer, more focused, less berating (she thanks the viewer for working out with her), and still packs a lot of punch.  I can see new muscle definition in my legs after just a few weeks of doing this video, and similarly in butt and hips.  Nothing that the world would notice, but I can see and feel the difference.

Fun, manageable and tolerable. My favorite is still the first Mat DVD though. I'm  not sure why people complain that she doesn't talk much. Some of the DVDs have her counting each rep and that's annoying. Form pointers and switching sides should be what she should put in her workouts and just tell you in advance how many reps for each side, other than that...you don't need a whole lot of talking.",1424390400,10,577,4.548076923076923

It's a quick (30 minute) full body workout that's perfect either for a beginner, or later on for a day where you just can't bring yourself to do a full 1 hour TA workout. I highly recommend this as well as the Dance Cardio for beginners. I hear there will be more 'beginner' level content coming soon - I can't wait!",1420156800,9,346,4.102941176470588
6504983,5,B00LTKTIEE,Great workout on a bad day.  You can do this even if you do 't feel in the mood.,1418860800,5,80,3.210526315789474
6504984,5,B00LTKTIEE,"I would love this workout if I could do it all. I am 75 yrs old and can only do 2/3 of mat sequence one. However, it is doable. I've only had the dvd for 3 days and I've already improved. Little Tracy Anderson is a professional with a philosophy I engage and advocate. Life, not just exercise, is about balance and that's what's she's saying. I just wish I could have a conversation with her and perhaps prompt her to investigate a program for the over 60 group. It only took me 6 sessions to do all of the first part. Tracy Anderson is really for all if you're patient and carefully follow directions. Results shows quickly.",1417737600,51,625,4.305084745762712

8667914,3,B00LTKTIEE,"Very hard for beginners. We are more senior exercisers so this is very intense and hard.  Definitely not a ""For Beginners"" dvds as it says.  It lasts 50 minutes and you will need weights and a mat.  She stays doing the same exercises on same side of your body for long periods of time which is hard and hurts!  For younger people that want a hard intense workout you will get a lot out of it. I think you will get rock hard with it.  Three stars for our group, but probably a 4 or 5 for younger group.",1527465600,,501,4.02020202020202

8667920,4,B00LTKTIEE,"I like the moves and the several shorter segments on this video so you can decide whether you can do one or more at a time. If I am short on time, I have no excuse to skip a workout as I can always squeeze in 15 minutes. It is also easier to motivate yourself when you do not have to ""look forward"" to an hour workout :) And once I start, I quite enjoy it.
I hear there is a lot of controversy about TA's approach. It seems to be working for me although I do not use it exclusively but as a supplement on the days when I don't take a fitness class at my gym.
The biggest problem of this video is Tracy's poor verbal guidance and confusing ques. For example, she may clarify or specify something about a move only when she is already doing the other side, so you realize that you may have not done the first side entirely correctly. That is when she insists that her moves must be precise with attention to detail. I understand that you need to learn her moves as they are quite different, but it would be good if she gave each of them a name (like the ""attitude"" move that she adopted from dance and explained quite well) and would clearly state which side she is using, left or right. Then, once you learn the routine, you would not have to closely watch her and would be able to focus on the exercises themselves.",1514505600,3,1315,4.120622568093385
8667921,5,B00LTKTIEE,Had to return twice because for some reason it wouldnt play in my dvd player(both copies) I think it was my DVD player as I have one you connect to laptop so it probably wasn't compatible.however I bought the video from her website and watch it there. Im impressrd with everything Tracy Anderson. She knows what shes doing,1513209600,,322,4.568965517241379
