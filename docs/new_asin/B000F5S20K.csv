2552762,4,B000F5S20K,"As my title says, I just had to see the sequel to Lost on Mars. I had to see where the story went after watching the first movie.  I must say it slipped into it's groove quite well.  A lot of different actors in Empire of Danger.  A couple of faces from the old movie.  But, that didn't distract from the fact that Empire of Danger was, in itself, a good movie.  It has an intriguing story.  One of the best Mars movies that I have seen to date, although I haven't seen all of them.  The only reason that I am writing these reviews, which I rarely do, is because I am a script writer in Hollywood and came across these films and was quite taken by their complexity.  My hat is off to the writer.  I think you will enjoy both of these movies but don't expect million-dollar special effects.  They are just not there.  If you are looking for a good story, well, that's there.  Directed by Eric Shook.  Cast included:  Traci Alms, Tatum Green, Cindy Tozer, Caleb Howald, Darkeith Lofton, and  Jayson Johnson.",1132790400,,1005,4.2994652406417115
2552763,5,B000F5S20K,"I liked this movie quite well.  I wish the actor Mike Davis, would have had a bigger role in this movie.  He did an excellent job with his performance. He's also quite handsome.  I can't actually recall anything bad in this video.  I enjoyed the sword fights, the dungeon scenes and the entire cast of characters.  This is a pretty well balanced video.",1132531200,4,352,4.523809523809524
2552764,5,B000F5S20K,"This movie has a story, and a very good one at the least. I am personally sick of all the crime, blood and sex movies that are put out for the public to watch. It is very refreshing when a movie such as this one comes along to watch. The characters were very real and believable.  You can definetely tell that the cast held their own while doing this movie.  The performances of the four astronauts played by, Caleb Howald, Tatum Green, Samantha Shook and Traci Alms, stood out in this movie.  The energy and strength of each individual character was refreshing and outstanding.  Darkeith Lofton and Jayson Johnson brought a certain chemistry to life between the two of them.  I would have enjoyed seeing a few more sword fighting scenes.  The two other main actresses Cindy Tozer and Stephanie Hunsicker worked well within their realm.  Going to Mars and going through time in a spaceship, is quite a leap in technology.  Although, I don't know if we will ever have that type of technology, it is still intriguing to watch.  If you like good old fashioned science fiction and have a little imagination left, then you surely will like this movie.",1128988800,5,1146,4.633663366336633
2552765,5,B000F5S20K,"So here is my review of ""Empire of Danger""  I definitely must say that ""Empire"" is better than ""Lost on Mars"".  I can think of only one other science fiction that I have seen where the sequel was as good as the first.  That was ""Aliens"".  That is a hard task to accomplish.  On that note, if you liked ""Lost on Mars"" you will definitely like this one.  The effects & acting surpass the first.  Though ""Lost on Mars"" has its own uniqueness, I still enjoyed the flavor of ""Empire"" better.  I am not going to comment on individual actors in this movie because they all did extremely well.

2552782,5,B000F5S20K,"I first saw this series back around 1980, when they imported it to the US and made it available on PBS. I was only about 21 at the time, and was fascinated by it. Upon rewatching it this many years later, I find it holds up well, although the sound quality is not always great. I am good with accents, but sometimes the modulation makes it difficult to grasp the nuances---especially with the working-class guys. Still, I would say I understood 95% of it, which is pretty good for a Yank, I think.

After loving it all the way through, the last episode ended it with a clunk for me. I recall when I originally watched this, way back in 1979 or 1980, that quite suddenly, after his accident, Anthony Andrews seemed to lose grasp on the character. He was not recognizable as Lt. Ash; he wasn't remotely like him. I think that his wounded persona was not a success---I don't mean as a dramatic idea, but in his actorly execution of it.

A star throughout the series, a marvelous human device to help us ""see"" this aspect of the war, I just think Anthony Andrews totally chewed the scenery in the last episode. That the characterization was above his head. I remember thinking that most decidedly when I first saw it, and regrettably, I think it now more than ever. The Lt. Ash part, in ""With Love from Hitler"", was played by an actor who suddenly didn't know how to play his part as a damaged person. He was not in any way sympathetic, and he wasn't Lt. Ash. I really couldn't find Lt. Ash in it, just a pathetic man I didn't want to know. There was no interior to the man, just impenetrable raw pain. I couldn't find his voice in it anymore.

I know that tragic loss of youth and dreams can destroy people. But this part was just not done justice by Mr Andrews at the last. And yet he was fabulous in all the rest of it, all the nuances.

You can portray pain without becoming pain itself. Portray death without actually dying. It's an actor's job.

Oh well. See what you think. I just haven't been able to shake the impression that he did a bad acting job in the last episode. Not after years and years and also seeing a low-res version on Youtube last year, where I refreshed my memory, and now I've just viewed the whole series again, in high-res. The same impression is there, and I was willing for it not to be.",1438646400,,2314,4.32258064516129

2552805,5,B000F5S20K,"Hey folks,

I just purchased the DVD set which is identified as the A&E version even though it was originally produced by Thames in England.  My version was made for use in the USA.  I did a search for the series on Amazon and found one vendor selling the DVD set for $13 plus about $3.80 for shipping, so I bought it.  Today I searched again, and the best price offered is $14.71 plus $4 shipping, so the best prices can change daily.

The series consists of 13 episodes which run just under 11 hours.  There are four discs, and the picture quality is really quite good.  There are no extra features included with the set like you see on most film DVDs, but it really is the series itself that really matters to me.

The one shortcoming for me is the set does not provide closed captioning, and that is a problem for me and many others.  It is not just because my ears are old; it is also because they are speaking their English in their way, and my ears understand our American English much better.  I turn the volume up a bit, and I am able to understand enough of what is being said to follow the show, but it is a bit difficult, and closed captioning would make it a lot easier.

In spite of my hearing difficulties, it really was and still is a great series, and this particular DVD set has turned out to be a great bargain for me.

Best wishes,
Dave Wile",1408233600,4,1361,4.1923076923076925

2552815,5,B000F5S20K,"In my opinion, this is one of the best films made to date on bomb disposal.  It is a 1978 British docudrama by Euston Films Limited that takes place from September 1940 to February 1944.  I first saw the film in 1979 on PBSs Masterpiece Theater.  I later owned a copy of the film on VHS tape and now I own a copy on DVD.  No other piece of film or book captures the early history of bomb disposal as well as this film does.  It is the most technically correct bomb disposal film I have seen.  It is much better than the 2008 film The Hurt Locker.  The personalities of the Bomb Disposal Section members are what you expect and not extreme as they are portrayed in The Hurt Locker.  The acronym UXO in the films title stands for Unexploded Bomb.

The credit for its technical authenticity goes to the films technical advisor Lieutenant Colonel Ernest Edward E.E. Gooch, Royal Engineers (Army Emergency Reserve) Retired.  The stories are from Major Arthur Bamford ""Bill or A.B. Hartley, GM (George Medal), MBE (Most Excellent Order of the British Empire), Royal Engineers, 1959 book the Unexploded Bomb  A History of Bomb Disposal.  The stories have been adapted for film by John Hawkesworth, Jeremy Paul, Don Shaw, Paul Wheeler, and Kenneth Clark.

The films stars are Anthony Andrews who plays Lieutenant Brian Ash, the sections bomb disposal officer and Maurice Roves, who plays Sergeant James, the sections sergeant.  In the early days of bomb disposal, it was the officer who performed the render safe procedures (RSPs).  Later RSPs were also performed by bomb disposal non-commissioned officers (NCOs).  My favorite character in the film is Sergeant James, who to me epitomizes what a good NCO should be.  The story follows the men of Section 347, of the 97th Bomb Disposal Company, Royal Engineers (previously called the 97th Tunneling Company).

The Germans learn during the Spanish Civil War that an aerial bomb that didn't go off had a greater psychological value then a bomb that went off on impact.  During the Blitz on England, the Germans incorporated delayed action fuzes in their bombs.  The British figured out how to disarm them and when the Germans read of this in the newspapers, they then started to incorporate anti-withdrawal and anti-disturbances in the fuzing.  It became a technological war of wits.  The film depicts the evolution of render safe tools, procedures, and training.  The trucks with red painted fender brought back pleasant memories from my early years in Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD).

The film contains parallel stories of the lives of the men in Section 347 that humanize the dangers jobs of rigging and digging to expose the bomb, so a RSP can be performed.  Today the training of a Bomb Disposal/EOD technician prepares him or her for the job, but much that was learned in the 1940s was done on-the-job without a lot of technical knowledge of the munitions and its fuzing systems.  This film gives the viewer a true sense of what it would be like setting next to a bomb while defuzing it.  I highly recommend this film to the military history buff.

The DVD contains 13 episodes, 50 minutes each, for a total of 10 hours and 50 minutes.

The companion book to the series is Danger UXB, by Michael Booker.  This book is available at Amazon.com.

The reviewer, Mike R. Vining, is a retired U.S. Army Sergeant Major who served in the army from 1968 to 1999 in the Explosive Ordnance Disposal and Special Operations field.",1390003200,3,3466,4.784511784511785

I want to be clear to the people who get puffy about someone having the timerity to give a 3-star ""based on a physical disability"".  It IS the DVD manufacturer's oversight to not include subtitles or closed captioning for the hard of hearing or foreign audience members not lucky enough to be raised in North Carolina or London.  To me, the accents are impenetrable. Since I can't figure out what the characters are saying, all that is left for me is watching unknown men sweat and get all blowed up and wonder if I give a hoot about any of them. This is not disrespecting the brave souls who actually did this work in WW II.

Many BBC productions from the Claudius series to the humor of Good Neighbors were carried not by sets and special effects but by the ability to perform a well written story.

Danger UXB is another case in point. I had never been able to see the entire series when it was in broadcast but remembered it as an entertaining dramatization of a little known if important specialty in WWII. This set solves the viewing problem and proved my memory to be correct.

The plot is driven by Lt Ash, as he learns - by surviving, to be an leading bomb disposal officer. Mostly his learning is conducted in London. In the 1980's this was a virtually unknown specialty and would not be a matter for artistic exploration again until the amazing movie: The Hurt Locker.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hurt-Locker/dp/B0030MKGKY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hurt Locker</a>

In true British ""stiff upper lip"" tradition, this series lacks the high drama and psychology of Hurt Locker and yet in that same tradition Danger UXB lets the bare facts of the job create the drama. This allows us time to get to know a variety of people then watch them react under different aspects of wartime stress.

Leftenant Brian Ash is given charge of the detachment just out of officer's school. He soon finds himself doing the very dangerous job of disarming unexploded bombs dropped by the Germans... and while the enlisted soldiers dig out the bombs, it is the responsibility of the officer to actually disarm the bomb and remove its fuze.

This series follows the men of the detachment from the Blitz to the eve of the invasion at Normandy. The Royal Engineers had little experience at bomb disposal in the beginning and very little in the way of specialized equipment. During the series we see the science of bomb disposal advance further and further, both in technique and with specialized equipment.

I had heard great things about this program for years but I only recently broke down and acquired a copy. I was glad I did! Another plus for the series was its realism... they had good technical expertise, at least partially provided by an EOD unit of the Royal Engineers, which still disposes these WWII bombs when they are occasionally found.",1341100800,4,1198,4.810679611650485

The story is nice and tight in each episode with good continuation between episodes.  Our hero is Lt. Ash who's a dashing you volunteer during the Blitz and has nice appeal for ladies (yes, there is romance in this), my personal favorite was Sgt James (played by Maurice Roves) for his nice presentation of a British sergeant.  My opinion is that Mr. Roves almost stole the show.  Something that is not evident when casually watching the episodes is that our story takes place over multiple years (from 1940 till 1944) which does make the romantic aspect look a little more drawn out.  This is an enjoyable little piece with lots of nice information on a fairly unknown subject, the handling of UXBs in WWII, a worthy 4 star piece.",1340323200,3,1006,4.434782608695652

There was hardly a street where an unexploded bomb was not detected. Very few of the men chosen for these jobs really had anything but a quick crash course of how to identify and disarm these bombs.  These men were true heros with nerves of steel and very little credit is given them.  One can only imagine how many lives were saved because of them.

War may well be hell but apparently it is also a drug when you defuse bombs, be it Iraq or London.

The nerve racking Masterpiece Theatre production has a really brilliant cast headed by Anthony Andrews (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brideshead-Revisited-25th-Anniversary-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000GYI3DG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brideshead Revisited (25th Anniversary Collector's Edition)</a>) as Lt. Brian Ashe. Terrified at first, his character soon develops confidence and is totally calm in the face of probable death. The stories focus on the working class enlisted men, officers and civilians and even has time for star-crossed romances as well.

The low-budget production has a genuine feel to it in its down home location shots, wartime rationed wardrobes and low-tech props. Skinny, sexy Lt. Ashe does drive a very cool MG roadster however! The scripts are written by rotating screenwriters which adds variety and nuance to the various episodes. The suspense is further heightened by the increasingly sophisticated bombs the German scientists kept inventing (remember that expat Germans invented the atomic bomb for the U.S.). Thank God they lost the war.

The criticisms leveled at the dialogue have more to do with the ability to understand a varity of British accents than the script. I found no trouble understand all of the laconic, witty or stressed comments that illustrate the general unpreparedness of the British authorities and public for the fact that not all bombs explode nicely on impact.
