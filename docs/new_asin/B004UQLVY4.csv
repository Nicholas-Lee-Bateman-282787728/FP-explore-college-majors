8441978,1,B004UQLVY4,"Ok, so it wasn't the movie that was bad but the dvd quality. I've seen the movie before so I decided to buy it on dvd....bad mistake. The dvd was so bad I wasn't even able to make out their faces. It was probably pirated. If you buy this dvd buy directly from amazon..yes the dvd is more expensive but its worth it.",1356134400,,315,4.015873015873016
8441979,4,B004UQLVY4,"Siddharth Malhotra, the debutant did a very good job as the director. Performance wise, Kareena and Kajol were equally good, both of them acted very very well... Arjun Rampal was also good, he did complete justice to the character.. In fact, he is one of the very few actors in Indian film industry, who can portray this role... The kids were very good, especially, the eldest girl. Some of her expressions were just WoWWW!!! The youngest girl was so cute, she was like a doll in Bumm Bumm Bole also... The other child, the boy was also good, don't know why, he did not get that much role as of the other two.

A good movie, on the whole..",1304467200,,639,4.369747899159663
8441980,3,B004UQLVY4,"Hindi movies have always stolen ideas from Hollywood as passed them of as their own. So when a filmmaker chooses to remake a Hollywood movie and does not hide his intentions, one must applaud this move. We are a Family or WAAF is a remake of the Hollywood movie Stepmom. Stepmom was a tearjerker and a great film and starred Susan Sarandon, Julia Roberts and Ed Harris. In the Hindi version you have Kajol, Kareena Kapoor and Arjun Rampal essaying those parts. We are a Family is about relationships and family dynamics in our modern world. Kajol and Arjun Rampal have been divorced for three years and share the custody of their three children. Arjun Rampal starts dating Kareena Kapoor and his family retaliates. Their skirmishes with the children and ex wife form the major plot of the movie. The movie changes track when a tragedy happens and ultimately healing the rifts.
Acting by all the major characters was superb. As expected Kajol delivers a top notch performance which is not surprising but she is equally supported and surpassed by Kareena Kapoor. I think this could be the best role we have had Kareena play in recent movies. The role was such that she could have come across as a B****, but she does not. Arjun Rampal is a real revelation because he manages to sustain himself in the midst of seasoned actresses. Simply put he delivers another strong performance after Rock On and Rajneeti.
The emotional scenes have been handled well by debutant Sidharth Malhotra and can even strain the tear duct in some of you folks. He does a good job in adapting it to Indian tastes but gets carried away at the end. The final moments after the family photo session stretch the patience. Music has always been such a strong forte of Dharma Productions but the music by Shankar, Ehsaan and Loy is the weakest score we have had from them in recent times.
I thought the movie was just plain ok but watchable all the same. I gave it three stars. 9/8/10",1297555200,2,1952,4.628242074927954
