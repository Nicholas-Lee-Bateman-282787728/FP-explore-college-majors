4285946,5,B0048ASB0O,"This film is a four alarm fire bell. Every citizen who cares about this nation needs to see The Cartel and tell ten other people. Buy it for your friends, invite people over to watch, set up a road block on your street and force people to watch... whatever it takes. The movie is about education. No - it's really about the massively immoral and criminal activity occurring *instead* of education. Here's a hint: whenever you hear the phrase ""it's for the children"" from elected officials, public bureaucrats and union chiefs, grab your wallets, hide your children and devise Plan B because you and your family are about to be churned into the statistics and trapped without options in hell.

Filmmaker Bob Bowdon focuses on the New Jersey cartel but the facts and methods he illuminates apply nationwide in varying degrees. New Jersey is the most egregious example and astute citizens are aware of the pitched battle underway between Gov. Chris Christie and the NJ teacher's unions. Pay attention to this unfolding tale because Christie's success (God-willing) or failure signals the future for the rest of the country. Gov. Christie deserves all of our support in his groundbreaking endeavor, just as Bob Bowdon deserves our support and the highest praise for making this important and highly effective film. It will be up to citizens to create the buzz because those entrenched in the system will resist at all costs and attempt to keep the information under wraps for yet another half century. While millions more children stagnate and drift aimlessly into society without any basic skills, much less the means to support themselves or become productive citizens.

Please see The Cartel, support it, and then do whatever you can to translate the information into action. I do not have children of my own but I recognize the importance and the grave implications this issue has for all of us and especially for all American children.

There are many marvelous teachers, superintendents, and other brave souls within the system who speak out in this movie, and they deserve our gratitude and praise as well. We cannot leave these dedicated people hanging... they want to teach and they care deeply about the millions of children being severely wronged by an immensely powerful and malevolent machine. They too are trapped, and frightened. We are ALL responsible for the current situation on many levels, and we have to help break up the cartels from coast to coast. There is no time to point fingers, only time to take decisive action.

Note: there are several options for viewing this film. I've purchased a copy on DVD but you can also watch it ""on demand"" for $2.99 or obtain a permanent digital copy for $14.99.",1292544000,21,2717,4.912854030501089

""THE CARTEL"" is THE MUST SEE MOVIE OF 2010!!!

""In case you think this documentary is about New Jersey, it's not. It's about American Education - a multi-billion dollar cartel"" - Bob Bowden

 The amount of research done to produce this documentary is impressive. Even though New Jersey is the poster child for dysfunctional K-12 education systems, this film vividly shows the same problems we have right here in Arizona.

Example: Maryland has a (slightly) larger population than Arizona yet Arizona has nearly 10 times as many school districts!!!

Example: Riverside Elementary School District: 720 students!
Example: Gila Bend Unified School District: 470 students!
Example: Maricopa County Regional District: 310 students!
Example: Morristown Elementary District: 196 students!
Example: Paloma School District: 72 students!
Hackberry School District: 51 students!
Owens-Whitney Elementary District: 47 students!
Yucca Elementary District: 34 students!
Empire Elementary District: 15 students!

The list goes on and on!!!

It's highly likely that in at least some of these school districts there are far more employees and administrators than students!
(Source: The Arizona Superintendent of Public Instruction Report 2008-2009 [...] )

Reforming Education is not about needing more money. It is about using money more responsibly, introducing free market principles and school choice.

$2.2 Million from teachers unions got prop. 100 passed in AZ. which nets the Education Cartel in Arizona a cool $1.8 Billion over the next 3 years!

Tell everyone you know about this movie and expose the crimes taking place right under our very noses.

For ease of argument he uses the combined cost for all that a student has access to, a total cost of approximately $17,500 per student. Typically a student will have 8 classes a year. So the cost per class for a single student is $17,500/8classes = $2187.50. The total cost per class with the avg. 17.9 student is $2187.50*17.9students = $39,156.25 nearly a factor of 10 off of what is claimed in the documentary.

4285953,5,B0048ASB0O,"At my university we had a protest march a few semesters back. A couple teachers joined, most of them were from departments that were getting cut while administrators were getting raises. Sure it seems like everyone is out to protect their own self interest but the fact of the matter is students are the ones that suffer. Limited classes, crowding, old decrepit buildings...etc. Not really much to do with this movie, I just wanted to give it a high rating!",1372204800,,457,4.725
4285954,1,B0048ASB0O,"I work in a district in Arizona that pays its starting teachers 30K per year.  After 15 years teachers make 60K per year.  To receive the 60K per year all teachers must have at least a master's degree.  Compare this to a district beside us that pays their top teachers 44K per year and it seems like an acceptable salary.  Now compare other professional who have master's degrees to teachers.  When you do this it becomes obvious that teachers are making very low salaries.  At least for the level of education they have earned.
In Arizona we have virtually no Unions.  The Unions that exist are puppet organization that do nothing and have very few members.  At the low income, inner city school I work at, I see teachers fired all the time. By law, there is no tenure for anyone.  You had better be a great teacher or you are gone.  In the high school I work at this will happen to at least five teachers a year.  Others will leave because of the low pay and 60 hour work week it takes to be a great teacher.  Our school is ranked in the top 5% of schools in the USA by US News and World Report.  We also received the College Board District of the Year for AP (Advanced Placement - university level classes).  Now the big question is how much does it cost?  Well Arizona is the 3rd lowest in per pupil spending in the US.  We are in the bottom 6% in money spent on education.  The school I work at is the perfect model for what America wants.  It's like shopping at Bloomingdales with Wal-Mart prices.  Unfortunately there is a big problem.  Over the last 15 years I have been in education I have seen a change in teacher's attitudes.  Teachers are expected to be like religious zealots that will work themselves to death for nothing.  We don't ask our attorneys and doctors to do this so why do we ask our teachers to live a life of sub-professional pay?  The problem is the great teachers are getting fed up with the garbage propaganda that films like this spew forth, and they are leaving the profession.  Giving up on Americas children, and giving up on America.  It's a screw it, let Rome burn attitude.
In my life I have owned a trucking company with 40 employees, I worked as an engineer for 11 years, I was a teacher for 15 years, and I am now a school counselor.  The reality is that being a teacher was harder than being a CEO of a company, an engineer and a counselor all rolled together.  If you have never been a teacher, you haven't a clue about how hard a job it is.  Teachers are a society's greatest asset.  Ask the people of Finland who pay their teachers 150K US dollars a year and treat their teachers with respect.  Finland is #1 in the world in education.  Or go north to Canada where teachers are paid between 100k and 150k US dollars per year.  Again Canada beats us in education.  This film talks about the US spending more than anyone and then admits that teachers are receiving only a small percentage of the money.  BINGO!  There is one of the two biggest problems with education in America.  So increase pay to teacher.  Pay them like the professionals they are.  DO IT NOW and you will see results!  The second biggest problem is not Unions, but rather a society in decline; parents working two jobs, disrespectful children, poverty, and the list go on.  Unfortunately the teachers can do nothing about the second biggest problem.  In fact, it is this second problem that means we really need to pay more to get great teachers.  Other things such as manageable class sizes, updating technology, administration, overhead, over powered unions, etc. are all things that must be addressed.  Some will require more funding, others will require less funding.  This is the greatest nation on earth; now let's start acting like it.  We have a complex problem, so let's fix it.  Just remember, the Boston Tea Party was not about getting rid of taxes, it was about taxation without representation.  Bostonians wanted their taxes to stay in America to build roads and schools that would make this country great.  They were not against paying taxes.  Many states may be able to cut taxes while others may have to increase taxes.  In the meantime, pay teacher's professional wages so that while the squabbling over other spending goes on, at least our children will be getting a better education than they are today.  I could surely go on, however if you have read this far you are probably part of the solution and not a person who is part of the problem for whom this was written.

It answers the question in vivid detail, opening the eyes to the bureaucratic mess which spawns fraud, waste, and abuse of power.

It treats nothing as sacred, and calls a spade a spade.

4285962,3,B0048ASB0O,"I worked in a school district and I have tutored students part time.  The reason I wanted to watch this documentary was because I thought I would learn something about the faults of the public schools systems and find methods to improve my tutoring techniques.  The documentary blames the failing of the public school system primarily on teaches and advocates vouchers for private and charter schools.  I am not against the voucher idea and I think students and parents should have a choice regarding education but the idea that private and charter schools are better is not really true.  I receive students from both charter and public schools in my area and the similarities I see between the students is the lack of parent involvement.  I don't think it is the school that makes the individual, it is the parents.  Parents who are more involved with their students have better scoring students.  The students from these parents are more willing to complete the tutoring program and the grades of these students improve at their schools.  I have students that I tutor who get every answer right during the tutoring sessions but they still fail their classes.  They fail not because they don't know the information but because they did not do their assignments or they missed school on the day of the test.  None of this was mentioned in the documentary.

Another issue that occurs in both public and charter schools is cheating.  Teachers give students the answers to the test and have the students memorize the answers before the test day.  The students are not given instructions on how the solve problems, the main focus is on memorization.  This allows a student to pass a grade even though the student is not ready to move on.  Students are not held back when they need to be held back.  Both charter and public schools focus more on standardized testing and having students get passing grades rather than having students learn.  The movie does not mention any of these points instead it focuses on how unions are not focused on students and how unions are bad.  Unions are supposed to be for the employees not for the parents or students.  Unions are supposed to protect the employees from employment problems.  The movie tries to skew the duties of unions to make them seem like they should be student focused when in fact they are employee focused by confusing union duties with school board duties.

Another point the movie misses is that public schools are more willing to take on special education students, students with learning disabilities, or students who are not native English speakers than private and charter schools.  These students are still required to participate in testing.  The test scores from these students are incorporated into the school's average.  The documentary leaves out the fact that more students are being born with learning disabilities and autism.  Most teachers in the public school system are not trained to deal with these students.  The documentary fails to mention a lack of ongoing training for teachers and students.

I can't speak on the quality of the public school system to compare it with charter or public schools but my cousins went to private schools while I went to public school.  I am the only one out of 7 who graduated from a university, although I have another cousin who is close to graduating because I push him towards success.  When I was younger I used to ask my mom why I couldn't go to a nice school like my cousins and she told me it wasn't the school that made you educated, it was your ability and willingness to learn.",1358640000,2,3595,4.781199351701783
4285963,4,B0048ASB0O,"The Cartel gives New Jersey residents a look at why our costs for education are the highest in the nation.

The problems highlighted might be a bit more extreme in New Jersey, but the ""education unions"" are equally as powerful and disinterested in the children in other states. California would provide sufficient data to provide a second volume! Alas, Nepotism and unethical practices are ubiquitous in all ""big"" government.

The focus of the documentary is on what is wrong verses to how to fix what is wrong. However, based on the depth and breath of the corruption; it is sadly clear that parents will have to by-pass the entire government based educational system to ensure their kids can read and write.  In the 1990s many parents we knew had transitioned to homeschooling, this trend has continued. The Church based school systems, as noted in the film, are the best way for parents to provide the necessary foundation for their children: education reading and writing coupled with expectations of moral behavior.  At the end of the day, we voters just have to say ""no"" to all tax increases.  It is clear the money goes everywhere else but to the teacher and the class room.

4285969,3,B0048ASB0O,"First let me say the bad- this video highlights issues not related to most school districts. For example, organized crime and nepotism do not infiltrate most districts. There were a few times in the video in which the roles of the union and the school board were interchanged. (What happened with the editor?) The greatest disservice of this video is the bias on teachers. Teachers are on the frontline. Most are there not for the pay, not to kick back, not for the vacation, or the hours. Bad teachers are few. Principals and other adminstrators that are doing their job model, encourage, and train teachers in continuous improvement; and they seek to remove the incompetent ones. The Cartel fails to mention that even before a tenured bad-teacher IS FIRED by due process, most bad-teachers are smart enough to go somewhere else or quit the profession.

Compliments to the Cartel for reporting how the district spends money, its failed accountability, and its propaganda to the public. Districts are about money, funding, staffing, and numbers. Districts are good at pointing fingers and hiding truths. Whether you agree with vouchers or not, at least this video gives insight to what they mean, and the politics associated with them.

4285977,2,B0048ASB0O,"I think it is really funny how all these documentaries that say they are speaking for the students consistently and brazenly present polemics that argue for their special interest. Its like education and student success is a blank canvas which special interests project their own images. A friend of mine told me I should check out this film because it showed how wasteful public school districts can be. I thought it was going to be an exploration of how schools waste money through canned curricula, subcontracting for cafeteria services, and other corporate connections that do not really enhance or increase student learning. But what this film , in effect, is just another use of kids to further agendas. That is very clear in this film.

I was engaged for about the first 40 minutes, and then the tired, largely conservative, arguments appeared. We must get rid of unions. School choice and vouchers are they way to deal with inefficiency. Charter schools can be our saviors (even though we know that only 1 in 5 charters do better than a traditional school). Now to be sure, there are some important points furthered and illuminated through this film. Nepotism is ridiculous, especially when a person is not qualified for a position. Bloated bureaucracies drain resources and breed inefficiency. But laying the lion's share of blame on teacher's unions is disingenuous.

What the film does not tell you is that tenure is not a UNION decision; it is an administrative decision. The film also does not tell you that extensive studies have been done of cities that utilized a full-blown voucher plan (like Milwaukee) and many of the same problems persisted. It does not tell you how HARD it is to train a teacher. (The film on several occasions compared teachers to doctors but does not really talk about the differences between how doctors and teachers are trained, nor the overwhelming demand for teachers compared to doctors, nor the expected professionalism of doctors compared to teachers, nor the social prestige conferred onto doctors compared to teachers). And most importantly, the film does not really show WHY teaching is such a difficult job. Now I grant that may be a different film, but the pronouncement of bad teachers is old and needs to be rethought considering how much the job has changed over the last 25 years.

The problem with this film is that by the 45th minute it was clear that ONE dogma was being furthered. There was no real dialogue presented. For example, there was one representative to present the teacher's union perspective, but several (teachers, parents, administrators, and policy makers) to argue against teacher's unions. I know for a fact that teachers' unions have a lot of support, once people find out the demands placed onto teachers and how easy it is for them to be scapegoated or taken advantage. Similarly, there were no talking heads that provided more critical perspectives on the issues. For example, Jean Anyon, who wrote the book ""Ghetto Schooling: A Political Economy of Urban Education Reform"" and was a faculty member at Rutgers, points out that until the socioeconomic and political conditions change in communities then nothing will change. We also have to look at the changes in American culture at large to understand why our kids are not doing well. Somewhere along the way hard work was replaced by entitlement-- especially in suburban communities-- or disillusionment-- especially in poorer communities. Its a much more complicated problem that The Cartel (or even films like Waiting for Superman or American Teacher) can illuminate.

The more critically minded educators feel that this new wave of documentaries are part of a general anti union backlash, and a part of the systematic push to crush the middle class, and  the effort to wholly corporatize and privatize education. In all of The Cartel's pronouncements it does not admit that privatizing schools will also establish a heirarchy, and will not dissuade corruption and nepotism, and will not guarantee student success.

There are some interesting points, but once again it is a special interest polemic for particular reform initiatives and not a thoughtful or complex exploration of why schooling is the United States is difficult. View at your own risk.",1321833600,16,4286,5.055162659123055
4285978,5,B0048ASB0O,"This movie correctly points out that the administrators,  and associated people, are essentially robbing the taxpayers blind and screwing over the kids in our educational system.  Unfortunately, teachers are getting the shaft too because not only are they used and abused by the administrators who are raking in all the bucks while the teachers do the work, but the teacher unions who are supposed to be protecting the teachers are also partly to blame for the problem.  I live in GA, however, where there are no unions and teachers are treated like slave labor.  All of the good ones get frustrated and burned out.  The administration is meanwhile bloated and a bunch of fat cats stealing money from their own communities.  I like the index of counting how many expensive cars you see at the county office parking lot as a measure of how bad a school system.  The sad thing is that only a fraction of the money spent on education every makes it to the teachers or kids who are the primary actors in the system.  Just like our country the school system is broken and needs a complete overhaul.

Blame the administrators.  Every failing school is the fault of an incompetent principal and corrupt county office and board of education.",1321488000,2,1233,4.746478873239437
4285979,5,B0048ASB0O,"I think the best way to view The Cartel is to view it with an open mind. Try to leave your political leanings at the door and let the facts speak for themselves. Bowdon does an excellent job of presenting facts, not theories or political statements.

There are couple of things that Bowdon could have addressed more, but I am sure he wanted to keep the film in the reasonable time slot of one hour and thirty minutes. One was the unreasonable amount in property taxes that the residents of the State of New Jersey pay in which about 2/3's of that tax money goes directly to education. Second, was the place of parents.

I remember near the end of the film seeing the students being chosen for the Charter School lottery and not seeing one male parent with their child. If you are born into this world and you do not know who your father is and maybe you do not even know your mother, it is very hard to be born with good, principled habits. Those are learned and they start before you even step foot in a classroom. A teacher and a school district can only be responsible for so much in a child's upbringing.

I am a proud graduate of the public education system in the State of New Jersey and most of my teachers were very good to excellent. Some were not, some should be held more accountable and the fact that the system of tenure makes it nearly impossible to fire someone is criminal. Bowdon does a very good job of not saying that the teacher makes too money. He or she most likely does not. It is the absolute waste of millions and billions of dollars that no one seems to want to admit where that money goes. The corruption is beyond rampant. Some school districts should be subject to the RICO Act. There are people in the Mafia who wish they could get away with one-tenth of what an Abbott District in New Jersey can.

He does a very good job of explaining vouchers and how they are used as a mythological tool to scare parents so their schools that are failing can keep receiving money that will only be used as waste and so the Administration can keep their Mercedes-Benz way of life afloat. When do these people stop defending their luxurious way of life and start defending that maybe the status quo needs to be amended? Our schools keep failing and the dropouts keep coming. This is only leading to a weaker society.

You will find very few students who know the names of their Superintendent or any member of the school's Administration department. I never met any of them until graduation day, and I was an honor student, a varsity athlete and in the school chorus. Most teachers I know will say their safe haven is the classroom, anywhere else is property of the Administration that only makes their job more difficult and curbs good morale. Yet, these Administrators are the people who rake in the most money and are usually the first ones out the door in a crisis that they caused.

4285988,4,B0048ASB0O,"This film does an excellent job of showing the overspending and poor results of public schools in New Jersey. Schools spend $17,000 per student in New Jersey, a vast sum.

There are a couple areas the documentary or web site could improve on.

I object to the idea that there are too many school districts. Local school districts are more amenable to local control. (Of course control is probably impossible, which is the point of the system.)

It doesn't seem to let us know how much a school should cost per classroom. What would a 'well run' school cost? Any organization does require buildings, heat, benefits, etc. which cost more than actual salaries.

The union person does have a point about how does one keep due process for teachers. This is only a problem because the state is employing them. The hidden assumption is that people can't work unless the state hires them. This is true in a communist country, or in the socialized sector of the economy. Public schools are a socialized sector, which is why it is important to create separation of state and school.

I suggest people read John Taylor Gatto and read about Sudbury schools.

It is hard to know what the counter solution might be based on his documentary. The system is working. It is a great jobs program. If the system wasn't working they'd change it.

Removal of 'corruption' would decrease the cost to the taxpayers. Which is helpful and in itself all to the good. But it isn't clear more can be expected.

Sadly the documentary supports vouchers. Not a good move - it will corrupt private schools and put them under state control.

They make the point that bad schools never go out of business. However state subsidies do warp things. It is true that school vouchers will create opportunities for corruption. Just like the current system. A voucher system will divert funds from current recipients to a new set of recipients. This is by definition. However the critics of vouchers are failing to accept that the current system pouring money in to peoples' pockets.

The private CERN in Camden helps kids learn. Run by community and church and costs very little - and is paid for by volunteer labor in part. If local parents revolt in Camden and send all kids to places like CERN and remove money from school system that would be a good solution. Naturally the state would try to prevent the removal of funding from the schools.

The talk about Charter Schools. They make the excellent point that public policy is that
'Bad charter schools get shut down and bad schools get more money.'
This shows how ridiculous they system is and that's it is working from the perspective of those in charge. Which is why everyone should be against 'public policy' on principle. It is a way to force the rest of us to support and pay for the goals of those in power.

Charter schools are cheaper to run than public schools, apparently 50% less expensive, and have the advantage of not corrupting existing private schools but instead creating new schools.

The problem of course is that a charter school is still a school and assessing people based on tests. But what if the tests are worthless? This is a very serious question. Watch the movie Race to Nowhere? The U.S. can continue to be rich and will get richer by any historical measure regardless of how people test - if the people are allowed to grow rich and public policy doesn't interfere.

The first example charter school does better than public schools - but it isn't clear it's results aren't still lame. Robert Treat Academy though does get very high rates but it is still hard to say if the standard of measurement is valid. They also point out that Charter Schools are safer. So even if test results aren't better, parents and kids like safer environments.

It would be great to see him address more of these points. Maybe do another documentary on these additional areas or address them on his site. Competent analysis of budget figures and manuals showing people how to do it would also be helpful. At least make the system less expensive to the long suffering taxpayers.",1314489600,,4098,4.688022284122563

4285992,1,B0048ASB0O,"Bowdon should be ashamed of his ""reporting"", if that's what it's called.  In the beginning he starts off with testing scores. Throughout the movie Bowdon misleads viewers with his data/statistics. Bowdon focuses on the proficient level only. At one point he shows that 39% of NJ students are proficient at reading. The report actually states that 39% are at proficient & ABOVE, which includes the advanced level. The entire truth is that 39% of NJ are reading at a proficient or advanced level-- he's looking at the top 2 tiers of student performance! What he leaves out is that 42% of NJ students are at a basic reading level. He's omits the average student from his report. Basic reading level is still literate and Bowdon does this to mislead the viewer. 81% of NJ students can read at a basic level or above-- it just doesn't help his cause when you see the entire truth.

When we get to charter schools, Bowdon of course overlooks the entire truth. Charter schools performance (according to a CREDO study): 17% of charter schools do better and 37% of charter schools do worse & 46% perform the same as public schools.  Hardly the solution to US education as Bowdon would like you to believe. One could make their own documentary on charter schools with, school board corruption, online charters with no instructors and an educate yourself internet based lessons. Charters are not an institution that's immune to corruption either.

4285996,5,B0048ASB0O,"The year 2010 had several documentaries on public education.  They ranged from being mildly condemning to very harsh against the public education system.  ""The Cartel"" hammered the government schools in New Jersey.  My wife and I watched this awhile back and thought it was well done.

Bob Bowdon, the producer, opens with some scary statistics:  Some 37% of high school seniors are reading at eighth grade level.  A third of high school students drop out.  While the US is tops in spending, we do poorly against much of the rest of the world in how much children learn.

The movie makes the point that tons of money is poured into public schools, but little of it reaches the classroom.  For example when you divide the total amount of money by the number of classrooms you get between $300,000 and $440,000 per classroom, depending on the school district.  But typically only $55,000 is spent on the teacher's salary.  There is little oversight.  Often janitors are making more than the teachers.  One audit showed that almost a third of the money was wasted.  Part of the problem is school boards are very free with taxpayer money.  And even worse than janitors the administrators have high salaries and great benefits.

Recently New Jersey cut the state budget but was still able to increase school budgets.  Unfortunately over a billion dollars got lost in school construction.  It was completely unaccounted for. The movie went on to share more stories of corruption.  For example there where ghost salaries to people who didn't exist.

Because of unions it has become virtually impossible to fire teachers, especially once a teacher has tenure.  Unions always fight for the teachers and the students suffer.

Lots of school boards hold elections on off days because they will get a low turnout and thus have a better chance of influencing who ends up on the school board.

Bob Bowdon concludes with a call for vouchers and charter schools.  By giving parents more options and greater power the government schools will have to improve, or die.

While the movie is a bit depressing with the constant shock of problem after problem with public schools, I felt it was worth watching.  If you get the chance, check out ""The Cartel.""",1301443200,2,2234,4.859416445623342

4286006,4,B0048ASB0O,"There have been other documentaries about the failing public education system. Bob Bowdon is a New Jersey resident, journalist, and investigative reporter in the state. This documentary chronicles and tries to explain a far balance of charter schools, public schools, the money, the politics, and why the education system appears to be failing our kids. Well, he went to the Board of Education in Jersey City (the state's second largest city) and found a lot of nice, brand new cars in the parking lot of the offices. Ironically, Jersey City has some of the best public transportation including the PATH and Light-Rail and a Bus system in the state.

The superintendents are making a fortune off the students who really don't see the money. There is too many districts (over 600 alone in the state) with superintendents earning under $200,000 a year. Of course, they complain that they don't make enough money. People who work in the lowest positions such as secretarial and custodial positions might have steady jobs with benefits but they are lowly paid and expected to work 12 months a year.

Bob's documentary is a worthy effort although it reminds me of a NJN documentary about the state. He talks to the head of the NJEA, Bob Ingle (author of the Soprano State), and countless others including parents, teachers, board members, students, and others.

I think what I remember most is the Camden story. The violence in the 2 Camden High Schools is unbelievable to influence kids to risk their lives to obtain an education. We don't see that story very much on the local stations in central Jersey. Anyway, a group of volunteers worked together to help the Camden students graduate high school in the basement of a church. In fact, Camden is so bad that the freshman high school students account the majority of students because of the high dropout rate.

Now not all Charter Schools are stellar as you are led to believe. Charter Schools are usually not unionized. Because there is no third party, charter schools can fire and hire anybody.

Charter Schools have their own issues to work out particularly those to help students. If you have an environment where teachers come and go, your students will never adjust to a routine and disciplined to learn. Charter Schools have to be unionize as well as the public schools. Teachers and staff at the Charter Schools need support.

Most of the charter school teachers and staff don't aspire to remain in the charter school system. They aspire to the public school system. Almost all of the teachers who left the school I was at went into the public school and never looked back. In fact, the public school system offers a stable environment for students and staff alike.

Remember Charter Schools aren't built, they are leased. They don't always last. In fact, they could shut down tomorrow if the state decides to revoke it's charter. What happens to those students and staff? Where do they go?
The Charter School system has a psychological issue regarding it's survival among faculty and students and their parents.

That's another thing about the education system. At least this documentary doesn't blame the teachers as much for failure as the system itself. That's why the documentary is fair and more balanced than others out there.",1293062400,12,3289,4.8922800718132855

Filmmaker Bob Bowdon focuses on the New Jersey cartel but the facts and methods he illuminates apply nationwide in varying degrees. New Jersey is the most egregious example and astute citizens are aware of the pitched battle underway between Gov. Chris Christie and the NJ teacher's unions. Pay attention to this unfolding tale because Christie's success (God-willing) or failure signals the future for the rest of the country. Gov. Christie deserves all of our support in his groundbreaking endeavor, just as Bob Bowdon deserves our support and the highest praise for making this important and highly effective film. It will be up to citizens to create the buzz because those entrenched in the system will resist at all costs and attempt to keep the information under wraps for yet another half century. While millions more children stagnate and drift aimlessly into society without any basic skills, much less the means to support themselves or become productive citizens.

Please see The Cartel, support it, and then do whatever you can to translate the information into action. I do not have children of my own but I recognize the importance and the grave implications this issue has for all of us and especially for all American children.

There are many marvelous teachers, superintendents, and other brave souls within the system who speak out in this movie, and they deserve our gratitude and praise as well. We cannot leave these dedicated people hanging... they want to teach and they care deeply about the millions of children being severely wronged by an immensely powerful and malevolent machine.
