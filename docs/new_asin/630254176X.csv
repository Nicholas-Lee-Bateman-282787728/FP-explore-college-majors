481074,5,630254176X,"This is one of the best Doctor Who stories ever.  It's spooky and dark, without being really scary.  The music is great, and the characters well made.  I think this is something every Who fan should have.",945388800,,204,4.45945945945946
481075,5,630254176X,"I sat down the other day to watch this story for the first time, all ready to dispute its ""classic"" status.  Once it was over, however, I felt like I might have to amend my all-time top ten list of Doctor Who  stories.  There were some notably poor elements (the ""american""  captain was just begging to be made fun of and the cybermats were used one  too many times), but aside from these relatively small complaints there  weren't very many problems. My favorite scene happened in the last episode  when the Doctor pretends to agree with Klieg's plans, just to determine for  sure that Klieg was mad.  This was a very well realized episode and  definitely deserves it's status as ""classic"" Who.",926985600,5,695,4.622950819672131
481076,5,630254176X,"We really are lucky that this adventure was unearthed and restored. It is classic Who and more importantly, classic Troughton versus his arch enemies, the Cybermen! If can only afford one Who adventure this year or  only one Troughton adventure, THIS IS IT!!!",914716800,,259,5.023255813953488
481077,5,630254176X,"Tomb of the Cybermen, although it looks out  of date, is the classic ""monster"" Doctor Who episode. ( it is after all 30 years old ).

481168,5,630254176X,All I can say is that this story is a classic and a must own story.,1428969600,,67,3.25
481169,4,630254176X,This is a classic old Dr. Who when the Cybermen were still fairly new.  I have many of the Doctors companions in my Dr. Who library but did not have Victoria.  I filled that blank and enjoyed watching the story.  I think that classic Dr. Who is superior to the new Dr. Who that came back in 2005.  This DVD contains many extras that I enjoyed viewing that included Deborah Watling and Frazer Hines.  This is one that I definitely wanted for my Dr. Who library.,1426204800,,460,4.3023255813953485

I'm sorry to say it worked, a group of people looking for the cybermen came and found them. this end up coasting them there lives.",1413244800,,305,4.186440677966102

481174,4,630254176X,"There are very few complete Second Doctor stories in existence, and this is one of those. It features an expedition in the 25th century which seeks to find remains of the Cybermen on the planet Telos. The Doctor, Jamie, and Victoria arrive just as this expedition discovers the titular tomb. This facility turns out to include a cryogenic storage vault where a squad of Cybermen and their Cybercontroler wait for someone to find them and activate the logical puzzles that will revive them. This story line of course parallels the findings of Egyptology, especially the discovery of King Tut's Tomb.

The Cybermen in this episode are quite creepy! Much more disturbing than the new series models. Their buzzing voices and slow deliberate menace are definitely different than the new models. This episode introduced the concept of a different model Cybercontroler, and features lots of little Cybermats which also menace the humans.",1401580800,,930,5.158940397350993
481175,5,630254176X,"Great video ,Loved it ,Would recememed it to everyone ,If you like Dr Who you have to watch the video",1398816000,,101,4.1
481176,5,630254176X,The DVD arrived on time and I was very pleased with it.  Patrick Troughton's doctor is excellent as always.  This is a great story.,1395878400,,131,4.416666666666667
481177,5,630254176X,Classic scenes in this episode.  One of Patrick Troughton's best.  Great episode to introduce current doctor who fans to this part of the show's history.,1395446400,,153,5.08
481208,5,630254176X,"Classic Patrick Troughton, and seminal in Doctor Who history. The clean up is tremendously good, and the additional material is terrific. Interviews, audio and text commentary are great. The history behind the story, parallels to actual history, and how they did the restoration are all included and well worth a look. If you're going to buy any version of this DVD, buy this one.",1390867200,,380,4.953125
481209,4,630254176X,The retro vibe combined with this story's place in the Dr. Who continuity makes it a classic. I just wish it didn't cost almost $30.,1384473600,,132,4.32
481210,5,630254176X,This product is really awesome. I really really like it. I would definitely order another one and probably will soon.,1378771200,,117,4.9
481211,5,630254176X,"The return of the Cybermen, great dynamic with the companions and one of the all time best performances from a consistently great Doctor makes this a must have. If you only buy one Second Doctor story it really needs to be this one. The Cybermen are a great revision from their original incarnation and as scary as always. The cybermats are a little odd, especially since they're sort of cute and it isn't 100% clear why they're dangerous, but that's a quibble. Troughton's performance runs the gammut from manic to contemplative and he has some of the very best lines he's ever spoke, including a gloriously awful pun which he immediately apologizes for.",1377734400,,655,4.8053097345132745
481212,5,630254176X,I am loving Patrick Troughton.  Haven't seen too many of these because there aren't that many.  I really enjoyed the story and the willingness of the actors to believe in what the are doing.  You have to remember that these were filmed using a shoestring budget so the special effects just aren't there.  The whiffle ball wearing cybermen in their zip up silver suits were really hard for me to get over.  Hmmm... guess I am still working on getting over them.  However its a really fantastic story and well worth the bucks.,1376956800,,524,4.580645161290323
481213,3,630254176X,"When I first watched this story, I was so happy because I had heard it was the best Doctor Who story ever and none could compare. So, I watched it, and watched it, and watched it. When it was finished I felt like I had just wasted (what in reality was only an hour and a half) several hours of my life. The Cybermats were ingenious and some of the acting (especially the three leads) was good, but not enough to save this story. It had a slow plot and unrealized potential. Morris Barry, who directed this, has no excuse for what he did, the soundtrack for it was atrocious with either stock music that didn't fit, or new music that was even worse. Design and build were off and under par with what the visual effects department had up to that point and soon do. The script, oh the script, written by Kit Pedler and Gerry Davis, two of the finest writers the show ever had, and they came up with this. It had no amazing revelations that you either didn't know or couldn't already guess, it had so many plot holes I was surprised no one fell through them, and overall was no need to make a big fuss about. And finally, the Cybermen themselves. Admittedly, one of the best cyber-designs they've had ever (still not my favorite, though) and the Cybercontroller was almost mesmerizing. The voice was pretty cool, for someone who hates this story so much, I find it funny that I'm one of the only people who likes and can stand their voices in this. Overall, 'Tomb Of The Cybermen' is a very underdeveloped and frankly bad story with an undeserving title as 'The Best Story Ever'. I gave it a 3-star just for some of the good points I explained, but even that feels to nice for the story. There will people who will say this IS the best story ever, and they're entitled to their opinion, so watch it, and then choose for yourself.",1374451200,,1825,4.354838709677419
481214,5,630254176X,"The Doctor and Jamie show young Victoria Waterfield the TARDIS. In the previous episode, ""The Evil of the Daleks"", Victoria was held hostage by the Daleks and her father killed. So the Doctor has offered her a home on the TARDIS, and they set off on her first time/travel trip.

But where are they going?  We get there first and see a group of archeologists set to blow the face off a cliff. The leader says, ""According to the map reference, that should be the entrance to the City of Telos""; the planet and city of Telos, home of the supposedly extinct Cybermen.

Everybody cheers when giant doors are revealed, framed by the images of Cybermen. But the first man to try to open the doors is electrocuted. That's when the Doctor, Jamie, and Victoria arrive. Expedition member John Viner mutters, ""I think this fellow must be a member of a rival expedition.... Look at him, archeologist written all over him.""

The Doctor shows his worth by deactivating the doors, and everyone troops in, the Doctor fretting about additional booby-traps. But there's not just possible Cybermen traps to worry about. Someone on the expedition is ready to kill people, too. To what purpose, though?

""Tomb of the Cybermen"" is a black & white 4-episode series that first aired September 1967. The plot is very good, even if the acting isn't always. I can't make up my mind whether Captain Hopper is a John Wayne imitator or a graduate of the William Shatner school of acting.

But the sequences with the five-story Cyberman tomb are outstanding. This is an example of how black & white can be effective, evocative and chilling. The long shot of them climbing down the ladders on each side, drums and horns banging in the background, is fantastic.

This is a review of the 2002 one-disc DVD release and the 2012 2-disc Special Edition. Picture and sound were re-remastered for the Special Edition.

First I'll list the extras, on Disc 1 and Disc 2 of the Special Edition, noting which ones are carried forward from the 2002 DVD.  The first three new extras, on disc 2, are great.
At the end, I'll give a short list of the extras that were on the 2002 DVD, but not carried forward to the 2012 Special Edition.

Disc 1 Extras:

1.  Morris Barry Intro (on the 2002 DVD,  2 minutes) Among other reminisces, Barry remembers that just one of the reasons he wanted Mike Kilgarriff for the Cybercontroller was that he is 6'4"". Mike took some convincing, though, as he'd never seen a Doctor Who series before.
2.  Title Sequence Tests (2002, 4 minutes) Samples showing different fonts and electronic patterns
3.  ""Late Night Line-Up: Special Effects""  (2002, 2 minutes) This is a interview with a man in BBC Special Effects, who feels that, compared to other shows, ""Doctor Who is a bit of a romp.""
4.  ""The Final End"" (2002, 2 minutes) During the filming of the previous series  ""The Evil of the Daleks"", Tony Cornell shot a silent 8 mm film behind the scenes.
5.  Audio Options - Two Commentary Tracks
A)  Commentary Track 1 (2002) Commentators are Deborah Watling (plays Victoria) and Frazer Hines (plays Jamie). Of Patrick Troughton, Deborah says, ""He had a wonderful sense of humor. You could see the twinkle in his eye.""
B)  Commentary Track 2 (new) Toby Hadoke moderates with commentators Victor Pemberton (script editor), Bernard Holley (plays Peter Haydon), Shirley Cooklin (plays Kaftan), Deborah Watling, Frazer Hines and Reg Whitehead (plays a Cyberman).
Holley compares these early days of TV with playing on TV today: ""I think when you watch something like this, the difference between ... filming drama then and now - there was much more of that kind of shouting going on.... Not exactly overacting, but bigger and bolder."" This probably has a lot to do with how new TV was - most of the actors already had careers on the stage, where emoting and projecting has to be more outsize.
Hodoke admits to being a super-fan: ""For years it was a lost classic.... People remember where they were when Kennedy was shot. I remember where I was when I got a phone call saying `The Tomb of the Cybermen' had been returned.""
6.  Info Text (2002) Interesting trivia. In one scene, the Doctor tells Victoria he is 450 years old, which is younger than the age William Hartnell's Doctor Who has given. This is because the concept of regeneration, of being the same person with a different face, wasn't really thought out, yet.
7.  Coming Soon (new, 2 minutes) This is a trailer, not the best trailer they've done, for the fabulous Tom Baker series, ""The Face of Evil""

Disc 2 Extras:

8.  ""The Lost Giants: The Making of Tomb of the Cybermen"" (new, 27 minutes) Commentators are Shirley Cooklin, Victor Pemberton, Frazer Hines, Bernard Holley, Deborah Watling, Michael Kilgarriff (plays Cybercontroller) and Peter Day (visual effects designer).
Pemberton remembers: ""The casting was really quite perfect, I thought. For instance, ... George Pastell [plays Klieg]. Now, he was the wonderful arch villain of all time. I'd see him in Hammer Films and he was always a foreign nasty. He had a presence.""
Holley has a laugh remembering that he was in 2 episodes, and he played dead throughout the second: ""It was during that production that I realized that I DID want to be a television actor, because I was paid for being a corpse.""
9.  ""The Curse of the Cybermen's Tomb"" (new, 14 minutes) This is a very fun comparison between the story of the Cybermen's Tomb and the saga of King Tutankhamen. It begins with a great cartouche for Doctor Who. Commentators are Sir Christopher Frayling (Emeritus Professor of Cultural History, Royal College of Art) and Dr. Debbie Challis (The Petrie Museum).
Frayling, tongue in cheek: ""That's where the cybermats came from. Great-great-grandsons of the scarab beetle found in King Tut's tomb.""
Challis ends with: ""  `The Tomb of the Cybermen' is one of the most historical Doctor Whos.""
10. ""Cybermen Extended Edition"" (new, 32 minutes) This is hilarious!  Written and presented by Matthew Sweet, this is a look at the whys and wherefors of Cybermen. It includes many clips from their Doctor Who series.
For ""Revenge of the Cyberman"", Sweet notes: ""This is the worst managerial decision the Cybermen ever make - forming an alliance with the Master.""
I got a kick out of Sweet's take on how baroque the Cybermen's master plans are.  Apparently, the logic of which they are so proud is not simple logic.
11.  Subtitles, are available in Engish
12.  ""The Magic of VidFIRE"" (new, 7 minutes) This is not the same as the 2002 extra, ""Remastering for DVD"", which covers the improvement from VHS to DVD. This new extra is about the processes used to improve on the 2002 DVD for the Special Edition.
VidFIRE = video field interpolation restoration effect
13.  ""Sky Ray Advert"" (new, 30 seconds) A TV advertisement for a frozen treat
14.  Photo Gallery (3 minutes) The 2002 DVD has a Photo Gallery, also, but it was redone for the Special Edition.
15.  PDF files to see on your computer: Radio Times LIstings and a Walls Sky Ray Promotion

Can you hear the TINNY VOICE saying:  ""You belong to us: You shall be like us.""

///////////////////////////

Special Features on the 2002 DVD which are not included in the Special Edition extras:

1.  ""Tombwatch"" (35 minutes) This is excerpts from a panel of Doctor Who veterans speaking before a 1992 London audience at BAFTA (the non-profit British Academy of Film and Television Arts ). The panel was gathered to  accompany the screening of ""The Tomb of the Cybermen"", a copy of which had recently been discovered after BBC thought it was lost for 25 years. Panelists include Michael Kilgariff (plays the Cybercontroller), Deborah Watling (plays Victoria), Peter Bryant (producer), Shirley Cooklin (plays Kaftan), Frazer Hines (plays Jamie), Victor Pemberton (story editor), George Roubicek (plays Captain Hopper), Morris Barry (director) and Clive Merrison (plays Jim Callum)
The director mentions one regret. He wished he'd had more time to dub metallic noises for the steps. It still bothers him that they're supposed to be metal, yet sound distinctly like wood when someone steps on them.
2.  ""Remastering for DVD"" (8 minutes) Thought long-lost, in 1992, BBC recovered an original 35mm film of the series from Hong Kong. This was released pretty much untouched for the 1992 VHS, and restored for the DVD. Split screen comparisons between the VHS and DVD show the improvement.
3. Who's Who. Filmographies of 8 people, including a generic one for the Cybermen. In Classic Doctor Who, they are ""the second most recurring monsters"", featured in 10 stories and cameos in 3 more.

481216,5,630254176X,"Now THIS is what I expect from a Doctor Who story.  It makes for a much better introduction to the 2nd Doctor than Mind Robber.  I liked him much better here.  I can't believe that this calm, compassionate guy will be running around crying ""Zoinks!"" all the time a few stories later.  Anyways, the story was excellent.  It had a mysterious atmosphere to it, and it was especially intriguing when the Cybermen showed up.  They were great enemies as always.  Their voice here is one of the best voices I've ever heard.  My favorite moment was when the Doctor comforted Victoria about the loss of her father.  This is just a darn good story, the best black & white story I've seen yet.  Now I can say I look forward to seeing whatever I can of this Doctor.",1360281600,,753,4.391304347826087
481217,3,630254176X,"This would be season 5.1-5.4 (Story 37). This is the first DVD set currently available to see Doctor 2 in action. I like him better than Doctor 1, but that's just preference. He has a bit of a different acting style and was friendlier than Doctor 1 portrayed the character.",1347753600,,273,4.48
481267,5,630254176X,"I remember watching this on PBS when they just unearthed the tapes for this episode. I really enjoy this episode. The sense of descent deep into an alien crypt/hibernation system is real. There are some real corny lines (""Man, you just blew yourself a pair of doors"") but the feeling of discovery is real. Recommended for fans of the Doctor.",1339113600,,341,4.7
481268,5,630254176X,"I have recently purchased and watched this dvd. Do not be swayed by anyone who suggests this is a ""double-dip"" release from the BBC. I have both versions and have compared them. The original dvd version was released prior to the application of the VIDFIRE computer technology that is used now to restore all of the vintage Doctor Who stories. Therefore, there is a HUGE difference in the video quality between the first dvd version (2001) and this one. The difference is astonishing, all the more so if you could compare it to the unrestored version of this story originally released in VHS. The 2001 dvd does have a couple of bonus features which were not put on the current release, but most of them are there as well as many new ones. If you do not own this story yet, the current remastered dvd is clearly the one to get. If you already own the 2001 dvd, I urge you to get this new version as the improvement is remarkable. I am very glad I bought it, and now having had a chance to compare an original release to a remastered release, I will be buying the new versions of all of the vintage stories as they are issued. I was skeptical whether I should purchase, for example, the upcoming rerelease of THE SEEDS OF DEATH, but now I have no reservations whatsoever. The BBC is doing stellar work with this series. Buy with confidence.",1335571200,4,1337,4.439024390243903
481269,4,630254176X,"The first episode was okkkkk....

but the story picked up much better in the 2nd thru 4th.

This is my 2nd Troughton story as the doctor.....The Mind Robber was my first and was excellent.

He is starting to grow on me and maybe will on you too.",1333584000,2,245,4.170212765957447
481270,4,630254176X,Got this DVD last week. The quality of the remastered picture is amazing. I also think the special features are very entertaining. This is a must have for Doctor Who fans!,1332633600,3,171,4.548387096774194
481271,4,630254176X,"Well here's another mixed bag of nuts for you to consume, and hopefully you won't have an allergic reaction from ingesting this.  I'm not going to summarize these stories since any fan already knows them, and there is already enough redundant information available for those unfamiliar with this release.

I received this as a box set, Revisitation 3, and so I am posting this general review for all three singular releases since all the information is more or less the same for all three.  The Robots of Death and The Three Doctors are the other two in this collection

To be fair, when it comes to picture and sound restoration, these have been significantly improved, and for many people, this alone makes these worth the purchase.  But when it comes down to the specials, I'm a tough nut to crack.  While yes, there has been some new bonus features added, some of the bonus features from the previous releases were omitted.  So if you're getting this new set, and want to have all the bonus material that has been released, DON'T SELL YOUR OLDER RELEASES.  Many of the recent DVD releases have been far short of impressive for bonus features, so not including everything from prior releases with new material is just sad.  Also, if anyone is a geek about the text commentary like I am, these are usually up-dated in the Revisitation sets, but the originals are also omitted.  Personally, I want it all.  Just because the information on these previously released text commentaries are old, it doesn't make them any less interesting.  After all, both new and old audio commentaries are available on the new releases when applicable, so why leave out an older text commentary?  Can we say ""marketing ploy?""

Something else that bothers me is that while it's fantastic to see these restored with better picture and sound, why doesn't 2|entertain first focus on releasing all the other previously unreleased stories, before re-releasing these stories?  I would think that you should crawl, then walk, then fly.  But these releases are more like crawling, then walking, then going back to crawling, but at a faster pace.

And finally, can we PLEASE get rid of Toby Hadoke?  There has to be someone, ANYONE, who was directly part of these stories that can be utilized for commentaries and special features.  I would give my walnuts to never hear or see him on future releases.

My bottom line is, that while the stories get five stars, the few additional extras, and lack of including some previous extras, make brings it down to 2 to 3 three stars, so that's why I'm giving this overall package a 4 star rating.  Perhaps the Re-re-release will have all this, current and previously released material, with some more new bonus material.

Please let me know if this review is helpful to you, and please tell me your opinions on my review so that I can hopefully improve upon my reviews for future reviews.  Thank you for taking the time to read this and consider my opinion.",1330387200,9,2970,4.7578125
481272,5,630254176X,"One of only three complete serials to be recovered since 1978, the Tomb of the Cybermen is a classic story.  The Doctor and companions arrive on Telos, where the mighty Cybemen are rumored to have retreated.  They meet an archeological expedition, inent on learning the Cybermen's secrets.  When the Cyber Controller awakens, it might just become a tomb for everyone involved.

The story is well written and everyone is on top form.  Troughton especially shines here, getting great lines and showing what he can do with the Doctor.  The guest cast all perform well, with the possible exception of Captain Harper, who puts it on a bit thick.  The set design is impressive, and though there are a few bloopers, the story never fails to capture the imagination.  This is the only complete story from either seasons 4 or 5, so it stands alone as what a complete early Troughton tale is like.

Originally released in 2002, this special edition features a complete new restoration of the material,  The VIDFIRE process has been applied to make the recordings looks like they would have on original transmission.  It will also contain a whole disc of new special features:
* Morris Barry Introduction - The director's introduction from the 1993 VHS release.
* Title Sequence - Tests and build-up elements for the Patrick Troughton title sequence.
* Late Night Line-Up - behind the scenes at the BBC Visual Effects department to interview Jack Kine.
* The Final End - The Evil of the Daleks is mostly missing from the BBC archives. A small taste of the climactic battle...
* Abominable Snowmen Audio Trailer
* Coming Soon Trailer
* Production Subtitles
* The Lost Giants - Cast and crew look back on the making of the story.
* The Curse of the Cybermen's Tomb - Sir Christopher Frayling and Dr Debbie Challis examine the ancient Egyptian origins to the story.
* Cybermen - Extended Edition - A history of the Cybermen.
* The Magic of VidFIRE - A look at the technology behind the VidFIRE process.
* Sky Ray Advert - 1960's Doctor Who themed promo for Walls Sky Ray ice lolly.
* Photo Gallery
* Radio Times Listings

With a wealth of features, a new restoration, and a great story, this is a must have.  If you have never seen a Second Doctor story, this is the one to start on.  It's Doctor Who at his best, and well worth the upgrade.",1328227200,9,2327,4.64390243902439
481273,2,630254176X,This is not a review of an excellent Doctor Who story but the fact that this is the third reissue of an earlier Doctor Who DVD by the BBC in 2012. The BBC has released almost all the Doctor Who stories that still exist so now I guess they will just repackage their earlier releases and just add some extra special features. The least they could do is release the final 7 or 8 Doctor Who stories that are left instead of dragging things out with releases of previous material.,1327104000,8,475,4.288888888888889

481275,4,630254176X,"It's unfortunate that so many of the Second Doctor's adventures are now lost to us, possibly forever. It's very fortunate, however, that one of the surviving stories is this one, recovered back in the 1990s. It's got the Second Doctor, Victoria, Jamie and the Cybermen!

The story consists of a team of archaeologists who arrive on Telos, with the Doctor showing up shortly thereafter. They all wind up going into the titular tomb where they find stacks of frozen cybermen, waiting to be revived. That this happens is something of a given, and things get very nasty very fast.

This is a good, simple story with some wonderful scenes, especially one between the Doctor and Victoria where he talks about the loss of family members, and makes the point that they aren't ever really gone as long as he can remember them. Also noteworthy, though not in the most positive way, are the American accents that a couple of the actors try on for size. Imagine having John Wayne trying to sound Cockney and you'll get some idea of what happens.

This disc was released back in the early 2000s, but now it's getting the special treatment. In addition to the previous features, you also get:

* New Commentary
* Tomb and the Magic of VidFIRE documentary
* All four episodes VidFIREd for the first time
* Sky Ray promotional TV spot
* Lost Giants documentary
* Curse of the Cybermen's Tomb documentary
* Cybermen (extended edition of the documentary that appeared on a box-set of more recent episodes)

This is an excellent, if not entirely perfect, story and a great example of what the Second Doctor was like. It's also, if I remember right, the only intact story with Victoria, so for that reason alone, it's a must-have.",1323388800,22,1769,4.70873786407767
481276,2,630254176X,"I've just watched this for the second time in my life, and after doing so, sadly, I have to agree with you, one-star curmudgeon, on all points.

I must say, to the positive---and there is some, and that's why it earned the second star with me---that the Cybermen are scary and enjoyably peculiar in this incarnation, and the suits do the acting for them admirably. The metallic voices are appealingly weird. I dig 'em. And the towering Cyber controller, with his helmet of ""brain"" matter, was close to a bit of genius.

Now, the first time I saw this series of episodes was on YouTube a couple of years ago. The blurriness and lower quality of the offerings there actually made this more interesting...it seemed more like discovered in a barrel, peeled-back, ancient lost footage, rather like the product of an archaeological dig itself. The atmosphere seemed muzzy and ghostly. It captured me with its lost feeling, its black-and-white weirdness.

I was then inspired to purchase the DVD, so I could watch it again and enjoy the story. In this fairly pristine form, it is of course more clear and crisp and cleaned-up and so on...and, I have to say, it also strongly betrays all the inelegant effects and foolishness of the plot. None of the proceedings quite make sense, either for the Doctor or for an archaelogical expedition...the motivations of the individual characters are not believable by any stretch. Even when they quarrel with one another, you wonder why they would care. Nothing connects.

To add to the jumble...perhaps because the other aspects were fruitless and empty, just for the hell of it, they threw in the American rocket pilot who keeps jumping around (apparently this is part of the American style of behavior as the BBC saw it back in 1967, all bump and go and a lot of snappy expostulations), making him absurd rather than authoritative, as a captain should be. He's not one of the bad guys; there's no reason to make him into an idiot, unless it's simply to give him a home with all of the other idiots in the expedition. I do see more Steve McQueen caricature here than John Wayne, but the imprint of the assumed-bravado, take-charge American male stereotype is unmistakable. I'm seeing a bit of James Coburn in that ""mod"" blond haircut and the tall, lean actor as well...

The handsome black guy treated as a muscle-man pet by the school-teacher-run-amok lady with the vast helmet of hair and the kurta and the stretch pants...

The various minor characters who keep getting abruptly executed as an excuse for tensioning-up the plot (and perhaps to keep the BBC from having to pay those actors for being in more than one or two episodes of this story).

On to the regulars. Deborah Watling is very pretty and sweet, her stock-in-trade in Dr Who, although a bit annoying as a general thing; too screamy-girly. However, she is hardly the worst thing here. She's merely mostly irrelevant---good at objecting to things as a way of moving the plot along at times, and getting in the way. Another caricature---the pretty but silly young female that the men enjoy rescuing and placating. Decorative and harmless. A product of its time.

Frazer Hines is fairly teflon here, no egregious nonsense, but he is the exception---only he, among the exploring group, doesn't embarrass himself. Sigh. He did make me smile with the line about ""maybe they're raising caterpillars..."" which leads us to the Cybermat, which did resemble a caterpillar of sorts. This metallic whatsis was both cute and novel (although obviously cheaply made; it looked as if it had parts made up of slided rubber gloves or balloons, with applied eyes like a comic stuffed animal).

The Doctor, the so-called hero of the piece, sadly, seems like a bumbling little man in baggy clothes, watching, watching, and hardly the genius he is supposed to be. He has no range. Why, oh, why, knowing what he knows, would he ever condone or assist (or even just watch, pointlessly) while people risked finding actual Cybermen or unleashing any aspects of their horrid culture? Or even just simply stand by while risky technology is being poked and prodded at by fools? (All those levers to push. And the business of the ""logic sequence""---over and over again, the bit with the levers---even more nonsensical jargon than usual. (Perhaps by peppering us with the words ""logic"" over and over again, they thought they could make this story seem ""logical"", as if my osmosis.)

The story could have been better, no question. More shots of Cybermen stirring in their tombs before awakening, even some close-up shots of them being quite motionless yet still menacing, waiting for their opportunity to awaken, would have built the tension better than all those twits stumbling around in anoraks, vaguely quarreling amongst themselves. Less emphasis on the weak team of explorers (there were literally too many minor characters) and more on the alien tomb creatures would have helped immeasurably. That singular, weird element was the story's strength, after all.

Maybe it was originally meant to be a six-part episode, and the plan fizzled. More transition between scenes, less hurry up and get this scene done, would have improved this story as well. So much of the plot is pushed along by settings that suffer from inadequate setup for the next action. You find yourself thinking, How did that guy get there? Oh. Two minutes ago, he was departing for this room and now he's here...somehow, in that two minutes, I forgot he even existed. (The right pace in editing, if there had been enough material to edit, would've fixed that problem.) A lot of crashing around on the part of the various participants, more than is necessary even for the bumbling, clumsily suited Cybermen (who at least can be excused because of their costumes and helmets, and their general cyber, not-a-human-but-kinda-used-to-be gait).

Unfortunately, from examining this episode, I can really see the attitude of the BBC toward this kid's show. They could not have valued the story lines or the product too much if this is what passed muster for them. No wonder they had no particular desire to hold on to the material, and simply said, who would ever want this (if they ever thought that much about it)---after all, it was black-and-white and they were moving into the imminent color-TV future at that point, and they weren't allowed to rebroadcast it more than a couple of times anyway, due to their agreements with the actors' union---so let's make room in the vaults for some good costume dramas that we're not ashamed of, and while we're at it, recycle these expensive tapes.",1307836800,,6626,4.885231316725979

It is a distracting effect that should have been addressed before offering this to the public, what with all the tech toys around now to combat this kind of sound and video from the dark ages of black and white television.

For the most part, Patrick Troughton shows us why he was chosen to play the doctor through his versatile acting. The story is in and of itself a simple yet enjoyable tale of the doctor landing (accidentally) in a situation not of his making. Then being blamed for something he did not do, only to become the only one with the knowledge of how to deal with the situation. Of course, he saves the day in the end, but not before some fun along the way. I loved this story, and hope you will as well.

481326,5,630254176X,This is by far my favorite story with the Second Doctor. There's a lot of humor in it.,1262995200,,86,3.8333333333333335
481327,1,630254176X,"A Doctor Who fan should be objective and just because it is one of my favorite shows does not mean that every episode deserves at least 4 stars. Therefore, I felt obligated to give this one a relative rating to warn others who might be unfortunate enough to consider making this their first entry into Classic Who.  If so, don't do it.  Begin with any other episode or you might never watch another.

Like many I started with Tom Baker on PBS but I appreciate what all of the actors who play the doctor bring to the table.  Troughton is probably the least known Doctor because many of his episodes are lost but for some reason, the programs that survive are among the cheesiest of all Doctor Who adventures, even more so than the older Hartnell era.  Fortunately, the story and acting is usually good enough to make up for the lack of special effects, however that is not the case with this episode.

For example, why does everyone start randomly pushing levers and then act surprised when someone is killed?  What kind of archaeologist behaves like this?  No one including the Doctor makes decisions based on anything nearing common sense.  One could even argue that the Cybermen could not have been revived without the help of the Doctor!  Of course it wouldn't be much fun if they never awoke but at least make it a bit believable. Next, this must be one of the most simplistic of all Doctor Who plots...push levers, find Cybermen, push levers, revive Cybermen, Oops...they are evil, push levers, freeze them...that's it.  There are no interesting side-plots and the Doctor does nothing clever other than figure out how to operate the various levers...again and again.

Finally, there is the acting, which is among the poorest ever with the guy who plays the spaceship captain taking the prize as the worst performance in the history of Doctor Who.  He sounds like he is trying to mimic John Wayne based purely on hearing a Rich Little impersonation.  He is so bad that it made me cringe and laugh at the same time.  The other side characters aren't much better including a token black performance that contributes nothing to the story. In the first few minutes we get such classic lines as, ""There is too much ground to cover, we should split up"", ""There must be something behind that hatch (really?)"", and ""Doctor, you curiously lack curiosity"" and that is just the beginning.  There is one funny moment where the Doctor mimics Klieg, but it hardly makes up for the rest of the awful dialog.

I suppose many fans consider the Troughton era to be hallowed ground but I am completely baffled as to why so many gave this episode 5 stars.  Yes it is remastered and contains some extras, however these things cannot fix a weak story and poor acting.  Sadly, Tomb of the Cybermen cannot possibly compete with any of the better shows like The Aztecs, Spearhead from Space, Pyramids of Mars, etc.  If you are new to the show, begin with one of these.",1257120000,9,2947,4.641618497109826

481351,4,630254176X,"Patrick Troughton heads up a solid cast in ""The Tomb of the Cybermen.""  In it, the Doctor (Troughton), Jamie (the excellent Frazer Hines) and the strongheaded Victoria (the lovely Deborah Watling) land on Telos, the home of the Cybermen.  They run into an archaelogical crew hoping to find the tomb of the last Cybermen.  The majority of this expedition is hoping to find out why the Cybermen have seemingly vanished from the universe.  Others in the crew are hoping to exploit the Cybermen's secrets.  It's up to the Doctor and his companions to decide who's who and try to stop the revived Cybermen!

This is the third story to feature the Cybermen and the earliest known complete serial in existence that they are a part of.  The story itself is pretty stock, although it is highlighted by the wit of not only Troughton, but Hines and Watling as well.  They play off of each other exceptionally well, but can hold their own when they are broken up.  Watling in particular takes the spotlight whenever she's separated from the Doctor and Jamie.

As every episode of ""Doctor Who"" before and after it, this one is plagued by poor special effects.  Fans of the classic series know what I mean, but fans only familiar with the new ""Doctor Who"" might be taken aback by the effects.  Just know that the story is solid enough to make you forget about them.

This DVD is packed with wonderful special features.  It comes with the standard commentary (provided by Hines and Watling), outtakes, pop-up production notes, Who's Who and a photo gallery.  Of special note are ""Tombwatch,"" a panel discussion of the serial and a wonderful sampling of the episodes before and after they were cleaned up.  If you watch the serial first (which I suggest), you won't really notice the changes made to update the story.  After you watch the clean-up process segment, though, you'll gain a new appreciation of the fine folks who updated the show.  They did an excellent job.

If you're a fan of classic ""Who,"" I highly recommend picking up this DVD.  If you've never watched any of the original series, get this one to see just how far the show has come over the years.",1187136000,3,2150,4.667553191489362
481352,4,630254176X,"My little joke for an alternative title for this story. Both would be appropriate, since Toberman was the first and only human tranformed into the ""new"" race of Cybermen, as was their intention, thus, Toberman of The Cybermen. Plus, considering Toberman bought it at the end, that's where the Toberman Cyberman is entombed, thus, Tomb of the Toberman.  Confused? Good! Considering the second Doctor defeats his enemies using confusion as his weapon of choice, acting silly and lulling them into a false sense of security.

I love 60's Doctor Who, however I couldn't give this story five stars.  For one thing, the villains Kleig and Kaftan have to be crazy to want to revive the Cybermen, thinking they could bargain with them.  Not smart at all.  But perhaps this is totally justifiable because, as the Doctor points out in ep. 4, they are mad. A demented mind causes one to perform acts which are very inadvisable.  There's also a third villain, Toberman, but he shouldn't count.  The most intelligent line this lump of brainless brawn had in the whole serial was, ""ME TOBERMAN"".  Not a very formidable foe.  Also, why exactly did the Doctor manipulate Klieg into dethawing the Cyberman? He even secretly aided him at one point.  He could have left things alone, and they would have been on their way, no harm no foul.  Could it be that the Doctor is so bored that he merely wanted to create a situation to solve and be able to accuse someone else of creating it?  Incidentally, the scene when Jamie picks off Cybermen as they are coming out of the lift would have been crucified had it been in the Colin Baker era, much like when the sixth Doctor shoots that Cyberman in his TARDIS.  However, nary a word is mentioned about this.  This clearly illustrates that the sixth Doctor era does not own a monopoly of violence. All eras are equally violent.

All that stated, Tomb of The Cybermen is a very 60s Doctor Who story, possessing a certain charm. Despite its flaws, it represents an era of Doctor Who that is forgotten by many, and thanks to the BBC's wiping of stories, most of the Troughton era will likely never be seen.  Patrick Troughton was a genius, so enjoy the very little we have of him.",1186963200,,2201,4.634020618556701
481353,5,630254176X,"One of the great tragedies of ""Doctor Who"" is the dearth of Second Doctor episodes caused by the BBC purging their archives back in the 1970's. The Second Doctor was clearly one of the best. His ""comsic tramp"" persona masking a cunning individual who was always willing to use his brains over any brawn. Further he had an amazingly good chemistry with his companions (most notably Jamie and Zoe), as well as having some very good, well-writen stories.

Thankfully, though there are, if I recall, only about six complete stories from the Second Doctor's era, one of those is ""Tomb of the Cybermen"". Yes, boys and girls, before the Cybermen were creatures from another dimension designed in part by Rose's dad, they were aliens from Mondas, here to do nasty things to you.

For reasons unclear to me, the Daleks have always been the popular advesary. I like them fine, but I think they're overrated and, especially with the new series, very overused. The Cybermen were like the Borg precursors. Plus they not only managed to kill one of the Doctor's companions, albiet indirectly, but they were also the cause of death for the First Doctor! Not too shabby.

""Tomb of the Cybermen"" features an archeological team that's attempting to explore... well... a tomb... of Cybermen. Uhm. Anyhow, the Doctor, Jamie and Victoria appear just in time to get involved (interestingly, someone apparently spots the TARDIS ""landing"", which I think is the only time that's happened).

The Doctor, Jamie, Victoria, and the archeologists get into the tomb. By the time the story is over, we've met the Cyber Leader, seen a cybermat, watched a lot of people die (yes, this is one of those ""fun"" stories where, Les Mis-style, just about everyone dies), seen the Doctor advise Jamie to run when he says so, and gotten the impression that our heroes didn't gain any sort of lasting victory; they just got away by the skin of their teeth.

The story is very excellent, and really does stand up well to the test of time, even if the SFX don't (not that they're bad. Actually, they're pretty decent). The acting is decent all around. The music is a little jarring, but not too bad.

Like usual, there's plenty of extras on the DVD, including information about the recovery of the tapes for this episode back in the early 1990's (so long ago... yet I remember seeing PBS up in Seattle broadcast this episode not long after they found the tapes... now I feel old...). Also of note is the wonderfully entertaing commentary.

This is the best of the existing Second Doctor stories, at least of the ones I've seen, which ain't many, and a must-have for any ""Doctor Who"" fan.",1181260800,4,2641,4.7407407407407405
481354,4,630254176X,"Okay, there are times when ""Doctor Who"" is an unabashedly superior science fiction program, and there are times when it's embarrassingly and yet lovably campy. ""Tomb of the Cybermen"" definitely gravitates towards the latter extreme. No, scratch that. It practically defines that extreme, it's the perfect showcase for it. And hence loads of good fun.

Patrick Troughton's performance as the Doctor is the number one saving grace for this episode arc. He's flawlessly convincing as a superhumanly intelligent yet quaintly absent-minded and slightly whimsical cosmic hobo, eccentric and curious as always and incredibly warm-hearted and reassuring in a strangely detached way. The number two saving grace is the overall premise of the plot, which is simply ingenious. It has all the elements of a classic horror film, though here the horror is technological rather than supernatural. An army of Cybermen slumbering for centuries until a hapless band of archaeologists unearth them, awakening a threat the universe had consigned to its history books--the stuff of greatness.

And the whole idea of the Cybermen is chilling as ever: beings who have traded in their biological and emotional vulnerabilities along with their individuality in exchange for cold, impervious mechanical bodies and ruthlessly logical, computerized minds, all of a uniform, mass-produced design--and, by the way, who are thoroughly driven to share these ""blessings"" with the rest of us regardless of any ""irrelevant"" objections we might have. In many ways they, like the Daleks, are perfect foils for an oddball, unique character like the Doctor, and they cast the show's sci-fi humanism in stark relief here as always. Speaking of which, this DVD has quite a bit of historical value, for while this is the Cybermen's third appearance out of many over the decades, this is the first one that's complete and preserved (barely!).

Still, while the Cybermen make for great, techno-creepy villains and while the overall plot premise is excellent, the actual lineaments of the plotline itself are riddled with a host of little implausibilities, meanderings, and assorted incongruities that all kind of add up to make the whole presentation goofier than intended, an effect amplified by the totally hammed-up, B-Movie acting style of much of the supporting cast. And where some of the dialogue, mostly the Doctor's, is inspired, some of it is cliched or, as with an exchange between Vicki and the ""American"" rocket pilots, downright awkward. Still, in most cases I found myself laughing with rather than at the show whenever these and similar infelicities arose. In any case, it's a good old classic from the 1960's that we nearly lost forever, so we might as well enjoy it for what it is, strokes of brilliance and flatfooted gaffs and all.",1170633600,4,2807,5.233333333333333
481355,1,630254176X,"Judging from Amazon reviews, there's nary an episode of Dr. Who that deserves less than 4 stars. If only it were true! If only everything could be a classic. But alas, even with Dr. Who, ""90% of everything is garbage.""

Like much poor quality TV, this one is ""geared towards kids."" Theme song notwithstanding, it bears no resemblance to the better episodes from the Tom Baker era. The central conceit here is a bunch of lackwits who, having stumbled upon a tomb full of computer equipment, can't resist throwing random levers and pushing random buttons while the Doctor stands back saying ""Don't touch that! You shouldn't have touched that!"" Inevitably, one of the levers rejuvenates the cybermen. It just gets worse from there. Abysmal.

481356,3,630254176X,"During all the years that ""Tomb"" was missing, it developed a reputation as one of the best episodes... or at least one of the best Troughton episodes. And, since we don't have most of the Troughton episodes, it way well BE one of the best, for all we know! However, it isn't one of the best Who's, and isn't nearly as good as it's reputation.

On the positive side, the remastering of the DVD is excellent, and, as with all the Who DVD's, there are lots of interesting extras. The acting from the regulars is great, I especially enjoyed Victoria in this one.  There is some good dialogue. The Cybermen themselves, while obviously men in silver suits, are suitably eerie. The special effects, by and large, are fine for the era and the budget.  Oh, and the Cybemats are SOOO cute!

On the negative side, however, there are a LOT of problems.

The acting from the guests is, almost without exception, awful. Everyone hams and mugs for the camera, rather than getting into their roles. Or maybe it's just that the characters, as written, are so shallow and two dimensional that the actors couldn't do anything with them.

And the plot and writing is, frankly ... nonsensical, with the characters running around doing things that make NO sense whatsoever.  I mean ... did they really travel several thousand lightyears, planning to spend only a few hours on the planet before turning around and going home again? These archeologists have, apparently, no supplies or equipment. How do they plan on actually doing any sort of archeological work? Locking the prisoners in the weapon's testing room?  Come on.  And, did the villian (who's name escapes me at the moment) REALLY believe that the Cybermen would instantly agree to work with him? Or rather, work for him?  And then, the moment they refuse and hurt him a bit, he's suddenly babbling about how he had no idea how powerful they would be and that he had 'completly underestimated them!!!' Hardly a logical sequence of actions for a man who claims to be well versed in Logic! Why did Victoria leave the gun behind when she went to fetch the captain?

And so much more ...

Despite all the problems, the story really is quite entertaining. I just wish that the writers of the time would have put a little more thought and effort into their scripts.",1157068800,5,2297,4.672456575682382
481357,5,630254176X,"The second doctor is the least known, since all but 5 of his stories were destroyed or mutilated by a house-cleaning at the BBC in the 1970s (the other intact Troughton stories are: ""The Seeds of Doom,"" ""The War Games,"" ""The Mind Robber,"" and ""The Dominators""). Troughton's doctor is one of the most appealing incarnations of the character. He's smart (of course), but also vaguely vulnerable and child-like. He has a good sense of humor and fun. And he handles all sorts of evil monsters with aplomb. It is a crying shame so many of his stories are gone completely, or mostly gone.

I was only a kid when this aired, and I can't recall it all (but I do remember the Ice Warriors from ""The Seeds of Doom""). Now I have 6-year-old myself,and he *loves* Dr. Who, esp. this doctor, despite the fact that it's in black and white. Also, the title music during this phase of the show was at its very best. My son rocks out to it when it comes on!

Don't listen to the nay-sayers who complain about lack of production values. This is 40 years old, for f**** sake! What matters in Dr. Who is not set-design or the tiny budgets, but the active use of your imagination, great writing, appealing characters, thorougly evil monsters, and solid acting. ""Tomb"" has all of these traits in abundance. I love this version of the Cybermen, with their metallic voices and three fingers. They may be the best yet (though I've not seen the newest version of them yet).

All in all, an unreserved recommendation. I've watched it (with my lad, and a second who is approaching Who-worthy age) at least three times and loved every minute of it.",1151107200,40,1618,4.534246575342466

I will tell you that this is a really well done story.  the writing is very good and the actors do a fair job of not making it too over the top.  Patrick Troughton's portrayal of the Doctor is mischievios and clever.  Special effects are rough due to the low budget and quick shooting schedule of the series when it was made.  Unlike the later Tom Baker onward Cybermen these ones seem more sinister despite the low budget costume ( let's face it a Rubber wetsuit tubing and a construction helmet isn't scary) but the characterization of the controller is very good and the actor is very tall making him tower above not only the Doctor Jamie and Victoria but also the other cybermen.

The extras are terrific as has been the case with all the recent BBC DVD releases we have a 30-45 minute panel discussion with all the surviving cast telling some very funny stories about the filming ( the info text option & commentaries on screen repeats a lot of the same info so watch the extras first).

With a great supporting cast and some fairly decent visual effects, ""The Tomb of the Cybeermen"" is a treasure that belongs in anyone's collection of ""Who"" episodes. The extras on this disc are little, but totally worthwhile!

481446,5,630254176X,"American fans of ""Doctor Who"" were usually introduced to the series through Tom Baker, the ""Doctor with the floppy hat and long scarf"" -- and rarely if ever got to see William Hartnell or Patrick Troughton in their roles as the first and second Doctors. Troughton's Doctor, although he remains one of the most loved actors in the role, has the least amount of surviving episodes, since the BBC thoughtlessly destroyed several stories in the 1970s. Ironically, since Troughton's great portrayal cemented ""Doctor Who"" as a continuing series. If he had failed in his role as the second Doctor, we wouldn't have forty years of the series to look back upon.
Ten years ago, I remember when word first leaked out about the discovery of more Patrick Troughton episodes. ""Tomb"" was considered a treasure, but if you held out for the DVD instead of buying it then, it was well worth the wait. This story has been lovingly restored, looking beautiful and not muddy, as the 1993 VHS release did.
And what a story - opened up tremendously by the restoration. The stop animation of the Tomb manages to be suitably creepy thirty-odd years later, and there's great acting all around, from Troughton to the supporting cast. The spaceship crew is a team of overeager Americans, which is the first time I'd ever seen ""colonists"", so to speak, on ""Doctor Who"". The creature Cybermats are also introduced, which are darling and just a bit menacing - although they didn't manage to storm the UK, and become as popular with children as the Daleks had. (My older brother had his own toy Daleks in the mid 1960s - too bad none of them made it into his adulthood.)
The extras on the DVD are also stellar, namely a short with background music, featuring snippets from lost story ""Evil of the Daleks,"" and a fascinating convention discussion with the surviving cast and crew. Comments from Deborah Watling (Victoria) are particularly interesting - she was one of the companions least seen, as most of her episodes had been destroyed. Watling, nicknamed ""Leatherlungs"" by Troughton and costar Fraser Hines (Jamie), because of all the screaming she did throughout the serial, turns out to be an loyal and fairly smart companion, not the dainty dips*** she had been previously remembered as.
A wonderful scene between her and Troughton show the world-weariness of the renegade Doctor, and how both he and Victoria miss their home and families. Hines, as always, retains his roguish charm both in the story and in the documentary.
Only two teeny drawbacks. One, the Cybermen costumes aren't quite as scary as in future stories, although the white goop coming from a flailing Cyberman in death throes apparently got the Mrs. Mary Whitehead types very upset. Two, this DVD would be even better if it showcased the fab vocal stylings of Frazer Hines, singing a dippy and jangly guitar-ridden ""Who is Doctor Who"", a la William Shatner and ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"".",1070064000,5,2935,4.860279441117765

The DVD is a much clearer version of the video as the restoration feature clearly demonstrates. The extras, such as the Tombwatch documentary (Basically a Q&A with actors and production staff at a Who convention) and the commentary by Frazer Hines and Deborah Watling, are worthwhile.

481531,5,630254176X,"This story was originally broadcast in 1967 and to me draws heavily on the Hammer horror movies that were very popular at the time.
The setting is very up to date scientific with the whole notion of cryogenic suspension being a central part to the plot. This is of course, overlaid with the idea of the Tomb itself and the parallels between Mummies and Cybermen makes for a potentially very scary story. The Cybermen history is twisted yet again as is their appearance such that continuity is very disrupted as it would be further in later episodes.
The Hammer based plot is given further creedence with the followers of the logic of the Cybermen, much like the high priests in the Mummy stories, come along with the intention of restoring their gods to their rightful place in the universe with themselves as their servants but not realising that they will be absorbed in the process. Toberman, the strong silent character is almost genie like in appearance and displays great strngth of character if not of mind, particularly towards the conclusion of the story.
There are some flaws in the story to be sure but generally they are of little significance. Taken together the whole story is a masterful horror/suspense tale with superb acting by Troughton making this one of the best Doctor Who episodes ever. It is odd too, that as this was televised in 1967, almost a year before the screening of 2001 that there are the similarities in the plot concerning the idea of testing the humans for a certain level of intellectual activity before allowing further access or development.
I do not wish to carry that analogy too far as there is not too strong a case but it has a passing interest.
Great performances all round and a wise choice for an early transfer to DVD to be in the shops later on this summer.",1025913600,4,1807,4.667711598746082
481532,4,630254176X,"An Earth archaeological expedition land on Telos, in search of the tombs of the Cybermen.  The Doctor, Jamie, and Victoria arrive in time to help them with a pair of doors leading to the tombs.  By the end of episode 2, the creatures, suspended in cryogenically, are awakened by a member of the expedition, the Brotherhood of Logician alumnus Klieg, who plans to use them to help him rule Earth.  He describes them thus: ""like bees in a giant honeycomb, awaiting for a signal to awake from their winter sleep.""
The expedition is filled with a variety of characters, the well-meaning but indecisive leader Professor Parry, the cold logicians Klieg and Kaftan, strong and silent Toberman, the high-strung and anxious Viner, and the tough-talking American (or maybe Canadian), Captain Hopper and his crew.  The Doctor thinks that, ""some things are better left undone, and I have a feeling that this is one of them.""  As usual, his words are prophetic.
The Doctor manages to gain the animosity of Klieg, whom he shows up in figuring out the logical gates to open doors in the control room.  The Doctor:  ""I used my special technique.""  Klieg, ""And may we know what that is?"" The Doctor:  ""By keeping my eyes open and my mouth shut.""  Ouch!
The Doctor's conversation with Victoria about missing her father is touching.  She'd be completely happy if her father, murdered by the Daleks, was still alive, and feels that her memory of him would always be a sad one.  The Doctor tells her that he can remember his family, ""I have to really want to, to bring them back in front of my eyes.  The rest of the time, they sleep in my mind and I forget, and so will you.""  He puts her present and future in perspective:  ""Our lives our different than anybody else.  That's the exciting thing.  Nobody in the universe can do what we're doing.""
It's interesting that Klieg is German and believes that the logicians are the superbeings, in comparison to Hitler and the Nazis.  For anyone curious, his colleague Kaftan is an Arab, a fact mentioned in the novelization but not the TV program.
Victoria, played by Deborah Watling, has to be one of the most sensitive companions to accompany the Doctor.  This is coupled by her prude, traditional sense of values--she's aptly named, coming from the Victorian era.  She's got the reputation as the loudest screamer of the women, with Mel a close second.  As Captain Hopper tells her, ""You scream real good, Vic.""  Trust her to put a Cybermat in her purse despite being warned by the Doctor!
The special intro by director Morris Barry is insightful, as he talks about Michael Kilgariff, the 6'4"" actor he got to play the Cybercontroller.  The scene where Toberman disembowels a Cybermen got a complaint from Mary Whitehouse, Britain's Tipper Gore of television, and Barry got his knuckles rapped for its explicit nature.  He didn't think it was, and neither do I.
The Cyberman theme from The Moonbase, with its booming drums and sharp brass notes, is repeated here as they emerge from their tombs.
Cyril Shaps (Viner) plays the Archimandrite in The Androids Of Tara.  And Roy Stewart (Toberman) reappears as Tony, Rossini's henchman in Terror Of The Autons.
Tomb Of The Cybermen was presumed lost forever until a copy of it was found in Hong Kong, returned to the BBC vaults, and released on video.  What good fortune!  It emerges as one of the strongest Troughton stories.",1015632000,11,3398,4.7542662116040955

All right, I admit that on seeing these episodes all these years later, the sets wobble, the props are made of washing up liquid bottles and the 'nasty foreigner' baddies are tiresome.
But I was blown away all over again by dear Patrick Troughton - what a beautiful actor he was. I have always regarded every doctor who came after him as an imposter, including Pertwee and Baker.
How I believed him as a child - he was like my Daddy (also a doctor) who knew everything and always knew the right words to say to calm you down.

It's the 25th century.  A group of scientists land on Telos, a cybermen planet.  They wish to learn from what was supposed to be the cybermens' tombs.  They unfortunately learn too late that it is a trap, and  the Cybermen awaken and want to convert them into cybermen to extend the  cyber race.
The basic plot premise is great and the Star Trek people took  from it liberally for the Borg.  problem is, it's badly written out and  made for 3 year olds.
The use of ""logic"" is badly used and  everyone uses it in seemingly every other line.  It's grating and detracts.  That aside, the dialogue is written so a 3 year old could understand it.  ""You will be like us"", ""These must be solved in some logical  order"".  Even Kaftan uses the word ""logic"" when being  arrogant to the Doctor about how great the ""Brotherhood of  Logicians"" is (with one sister, apparently)  Ugh.
Another aspect is  how the Doctor says things like ""I have my own special method of  learning, I keep my mouth shut and my eyes open"".  I wonder what was  open when he cheated behind the scientists' backs and activated the  ""logical"" circuits enabling them to open the entrance to the  tombs' doors!
The Cybermen come out in the end of part 2, and do nothing  at all until the end of part 4 when they go back into their tombs.
The  end of part 1 features what is supposed to be a live Cyberman but obviously  comes across as a mannequin, so much for the cliffhanger.
Kaftan has a  musclebound black servant who doesn't say much apart from a bunch of grunts  and ""duh"" noises.
The feel of the production is closer to  1951 than 1967 because of all this and even if it were filmed in color, it  wouldn't help.
Why not only 1 star?  George Pastel steals the  ""show"" as Erik Klieg.  Klieg himself is the only  three-dimensional character there apart from the Doctor, but it's George's  acting which steals the show and makes it more than a turkey.  Absolutely  brilliant, his acting is.  If it weren't for him, the entire story would be  a puddle of toddleresque mush.  His final scenes in part 4 for example  where he goes mad are completely buyable and really are genuinely  frightening -- he *still* thinks the cybermen are on his side and he  intends to throw his comrades and the Doctor to them:  ""I'm sure the  cybremen have a use for you, or at least parts of you! ""  Klieg is  great and his final moments are truly classic!  The rest is  utter  [blank]!
If you're really into Doctor Who, go for it.  If you're new to  the show, wait a while.  It's got good moments and occasional good acting  but it'll drive most people away from the show.",963532800,5,2622,4.397058823529412

I particularly liked the Doctor's explanation of his 'technique': ""Keeping my eyes open and my mouth shut."" Troughton's Doctor had a magical quality that none of the others had. He had a mischievious twinkle in his eye and was childlike at times, but very wise as well. If you've only experienced Doctor Who with Tom Baker (who was rather overrated, in my opinion) broaden your Doctor Who horizons and pick up this story. Terrific fun from start to finish.
I just picked up the DVD on Tuesday, 8/6/02.  The improvement in picture quality due to the hard work of the Doctor Who Restoration Team is remarkable.

The fabulous production note are here, too, giving us additional behind the scenes info. The documentary 'Tombwatch', which is taken from a panel discussion of the story at an event which had a screening of 'Tomb' shortly after its recovery from Hong Kong, is a nice extra and gives a good amount of insight into the making of the story.  Also, very cool is a little featurette called 'The Final End', which takes film of the model work at the end of 'The Evil of the Daleks' and combines it with sound from the story to give the viewer an idea of what the final battle from that mostly missing story was like.  Only episode 2 of 7 of 'Evil' exists.

And so the Cybermen assume a greater significance in  modern sci-fi than they would as a mere Dr. Who footnote. Tomb of the  Cybermen ranks not just as one of the best Cybermen stories but also one of  the best of the sixties Dr. Who era. The storyline does not meander into  sub-plots and remains focused. The fact that the sets are limited to three  locations, save for some external shots, within a mausoleum does not  detract from the plot. Quite the contrary, the claustraphobic tension adds  to the suspense. as does the twin threat of Cybermen and evil scientists.  Other reviewers have indicated a disaffection with certain aspects of the  show for being amateurish or unconvincing (including the poisonous robotic  mice, Cybermats). One of the most endearing aspects of the show for me and  I would hope most fans is the fact that the minimalistic production values  are a self parody which reflects the minimal budget afforded the show by  the BBC.

The Doctor is very cautious about exploring the tomb and uncovering its secrets. The place has a good, creepy atmosphere and lots of weird gadgets. Cyberman technology is based on symbolic logic so they have to overcome plenty of puzzles to get things to work. It makes for good drama and the fun techno-babble. As things progess, it is clear that the financiers of the expedition have an ulterior motive in searching for the Cybermen.

Troughton as the Doctor is great fun. He has a disheveled look and wry sense of humor that belie his brilliant, calculating mind.  He has wonderful chemistry with his companions, the 17th century Scotsman Jaime and the Victorian-era Victoria.

The visual effects are all over the place. The ""defrosting"" of the Cybermen looks impressive. On the other hand, in a fight scene a wire and harness on one character is blatantly obvious.

Included with the 2-disc edition I'm reviewing are some really interesting extras such as a narrative that explains the story is meant to be a inspired by the discovery and opening of King Tut's tomb.
Along with The Seeds of Death, The Tomb of the Cybermen I believe represent the best of the 2nd Doctor stories.
