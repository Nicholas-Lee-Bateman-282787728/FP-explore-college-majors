6602913,5,B00MWGIEQW,This Matt Smith Collection is absolutely amazing! It came in perfect condition! The discs are easy to get to and hold together nicely. The packaging box is just amazing! They have really outdone themselves with this collection box set. Has all the seasons of Matt Smith (5-7) & all the Specials + a bonus disc. This is everything I could have ever wanted & I am so happy I waited for this to come out. :) A MUST OWN! PERIOD!,1415059200,14,424,4.3125
6602914,5,B00MWGIEQW,"This review is mainly for Matt Smith fans,who I believe has clearly separated himself from all the other doctors. His energy,mental
gymnastics,playfulness,and caring personality hold the viewer hostage through out the episodes,and keep you wanting more. This
is science fiction at a high level, and will also stretch your imagination processes. The complete Matt Smith years will satisfy your
inner desires. The stories and the companions intertwine very well and left me wishing the doctor was still here. This is a great buy,
and costs far less than purchasing the separate segments. ""Go for it"".",1409184000,23,598,5.3052631578947365
6602915,5,B00MWGIEQW,"Matt Smith was a great Doctor!  He brings a great sense of adventure with every episode, and is definitely the best Doctor since the reboot began.  This set comes in a special collectible flat book casing, and includes his complete collection: (Series Five though Series Seven, plus the Christmas Specials).  Christmas Specials include: The Time of the Doctor, plus the 50th Anniversary Special The Day of the Doctor in 3D and 2D, and An Adventure in Space and Time.
New bonus features include the 2013 Doctor Who Proms Concert, Matt Smith's two Sarah Jane Adventures episodes, The Five(ish) Doctors, and more.",1408924800,49,610,5.01980198019802
6602916,1,B00MWGIEQW,"This is the only R1 (Blu-exclusive, no less?) alternative to the 50th Anniversary set that R2 is getting?  No sale!
There should be NO NEED to repurchase three seasons sets I ALREADY OWN to get a few episodes which should have their own separate release anyway!
Cynical in the extreme.  Expect a proper release of the Anniversary Specials!",1408924800,31,339,4.827586206896552
6602917,5,B00MWGIEQW,"Love the show.  Took a while to warm up to Matt Smith and company, but he's my favorite of the four latter-day doctors so far (having watched Seasons 1 through 8).

Great special features.  The packaging is awkward, but OK.",1452038400,,223,4.525

6602919,4,B00MWGIEQW,"Honestly, I haven't watched these yet since I've already seen it.  I do want to collect the series though and this is the cheapest way to do bluray.  Hopefully the Tennant years will do bluray too.  The book is impressive and does securely hold the discs so no fear of falling out.",1448064000,3,281,4.365384615384615

B  Not a lot of reading material. Some extra information would have been nice.",1444521600,,292,4.290909090909091
6602925,5,B00MWGIEQW,This is probably one of the best series compilation packages I have seen. The design is awesome and it provides a lot of protection while at the same time showing off a great display. Would definately recommend.,1444262400,,211,4.72972972972973
6602926,2,B00MWGIEQW,"This review is for the Blu-ray version of the Matt Smith Years.

I returned this set and bought them on DVD.

There is no way to save where you are in an episode. You have to start over again. Plus, unlike other BBC Blu-ray discs, there's no way to skip the previews at the beginning.

This is OK for someone who always watches an episode all the way through without interruption. I don't have that luxury.

Sure I paid more for the same content on DVD, but at least it's user friendly and not user hostile.",1442880000,4,507,4.25
6602927,4,B00MWGIEQW,"This new item is almost as I expected from a new item.  3 of the discs have skipping on them, two of which make an episode unviewable.  The special features, background, and interviews are worth the purchase of this set.",1441238400,2,220,4.475
6602928,5,B00MWGIEQW,"Awesome Product!! I am one happy Whovian!!!!!! I love the extras, the specials. The package the whole nine yards.....",1440288000,,117,5.2105263157894735

6602932,5,B00MWGIEQW,"It actually included more than I had expected, such as Day of the Doctor, and more features.  Blu-ray throughout so the quality has been excellent.  Even the box appears to be quite sturdy.  Someone put time, effort and money into making this collection and it shows.  Unless they come out with a 4K or a 3D version this collection will be extremely hard to beat.  16 disks total makes the price a bargain to boot.",1435449600,,414,4.466666666666667

6602935,5,B00MWGIEQW,great,1430006400,,5,5.0
6602936,5,B00MWGIEQW,Worth it!!! This is more like a children's story book that you might find in Amelia Pond's bedroom than a bluray series. The bluray container is durable card stock that tells the story of the Doctor and his companions. It is as wide as two Bluray cases and thus is difficult to fit on a shelf. It now takes a prominent display space in my media cabinet. The bluray quality is stunning! The colors and sharpness evoke feelings of actual space and time travel. It's much better than streaming from an online rental source!! The Matt Smith years are a wonderful addition to any whovian's home.,1429142400,2,590,4.5754716981132075
6602937,5,B00MWGIEQW,"I just finished watching it all over the course of a month! Up until I got this set for my birthday I hadn't seen all of the Matt Smith episodes. I was pleasantly surprised with the end. He will never be my favorite Doctor,  but he is better than I thought he would be. I will admit there were times in the beginning that I wished he would regenerate, because I didn't like some episodes and I didn't really like where the show was going. But I did feel myself getting more and more attached to this version of the Doctor. His scenes with River were just magical,  and there were points where I would find myself rooting for him. The movies were great, and the minisodes explain alot. I was thankful they filled the disks with special features, as I watched them all. This is a perfect gift for a whovian, everything came together beautifully. I would highly recommend it!",1428796800,,872,4.409937888198757
6602938,5,B00MWGIEQW,Awesome set.,1428537600,,12,5.5
6602939,3,B00MWGIEQW,"This gets 5 stars for the content.  If you're planning on buying this collection, you almost certainly consider the Matt Smith episodes to be the best or among the best Dr. Who. content.  The video and audio are sharp and clear, and the content is amazingly inclusive.  The extras are more extensive than in any other collection of this season.

Why did I give it 3 stars after all this goodness?  I'd forgotten how pernicious the BBC discs are.  They violate the precept that buying a legal copy should leave you better off than pirating a copy.  On these, and other, discs, BBC disables the Top Menu button until after you've been forced to wait through two copyright warning tracks and an advertisement for something else.  If I'd realized BBC was still doing this kind of thing, I'd have held off buying this until BBC finally stopped this practice.",1428278400,2,853,4.677852348993288
6602940,5,B00MWGIEQW,"My favorite show, love all the extras.",1427414400,,38,4.571428571428571
6602941,5,B00MWGIEQW,Our first foray into Blu Ray - new player and an amazing picture quality,1427328000,,72,4.214285714285714
6602942,5,B00MWGIEQW,Great Matt Smith collection.,1427068800,,28,6.25
6602943,4,B00MWGIEQW,"This collection presents NEARLY all of the Doctor Who content produced during Matt Smith's years as the Doctor, with the minor exception of his appearance at ""The End of Time Part 2,"" which is not included on this set, but is readily available elsewhere. There's also one other item missing, but I'll get on that later.

So, basically, this set collects Doctor Who Series 5, Series 6, Series 7, the Christmas specials for 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and ""The Day of the Doctor"" 50th Anniversary special, all in 1080p High Definition. Also included is ""An Adventure in Time and Space,"" the TV movie retelling the creation of Doctor Who which aired during the 50th Anniversary and contains a cameo by Matt Smith.

Most of these discs were also available for sale individually (the solo release of ""An Adventure in Time and Space"" included a DVD copy and a DVD of the first Doctor Who serial, neither of which is in this set), but there's also a set-exclusive bonus disc featuring Matt Smith's guest star story on Doctor Who spinoff ""The Sarah Jane Adventures,"" the 2013 Doctor Who Proms concert, a new feature for ""The Day of the Doctor,"" ""Doctor Who: The Ultimate Guide"" (for anyone who might be new to Doctor Who getting this set), and ""The Five(ish) Doctors Reboot"": a half hour comedy for the 50th Anniversary featuring former Doctors Peter Davison, Colin Baker, and Sylvester McCoy, as well as cameos by many others, including John Barrowman, Paul McGann, and Matt Smith.

For any US-based Doctor Who collector, this can either replace or relieve you of needing to buy the above sets, neatly filling in your collection. However, there was a 50th Anniversary collector's set released in the UK which features a few bonus features not included here. To me, chiefest among these were the cinematic openings for The Day of the Doctor, which audiences who went to see the special in theaters saw before the special started, and ""The Science of Doctor Who,"" with scientist Brian Cox explaining many of the scientific theories suggested by Doctor Who. What makes this specific loss so grievous is that Matt Smith appears in the special, as it was framed by Brian Cox actually entering the TARDIS and talking with the Doctor. The other loss is the minor but still would have been nice addition of deleted scenes for The Day of the Doctor. Rights issues probably would not have been too difficult to sort out and any fan of Doctor Who who would be purchasing this set would be interested in seeing those at least once.

Overall, if you don't have any of Matt Smith's tenure as the Doctor in your collection, this is a nice way to get it on Blu-Ray. (I only owned Series 5 on DVD.) If you already bought them before the set was announced, then you have to decide if you might want to sell your copies and get this for the bonus disc or get this as well.",1426550400,45,2841,4.642147117296223
6602944,5,B00MWGIEQW,it amazing in detail and production. its a work of art to the book layout,1426377600,,73,3.933333333333333
6602945,5,B00MWGIEQW,"Amazing box set. Beautiful packaging and every single little bit of Matt Smith's excellent Doctor (all the prequels and little extras) that you could possibly want.
There some mistakes on the listing inside the blu ray holder book with wrong commentaries that are not there (and I don't think exist anywhere else either) and there are also a bundle of extras not listed on one of the discs but they are all there.
Overall a great buy for Matt Smith fans and for Doctor Who fans.",1426291200,2,478,4.569767441860465
6602946,5,B00MWGIEQW,Matt Smith is my favorite Dr. and so I've really treasured This collection. It's been so nice to be able to watch the development of the show. I think it is lost so much heart since Matt Smith left. There's a lot of love in the shows and I really appreciate the excellent work on everyone's part. The quality of the discs is awfully good and I would not hesitate to recommend this to anyone,1426204800,,390,4.213333333333333

6602954,3,B00MWGIEQW,"From the online picture this looks great . But ! This is a collectors ( only ) item . It is to be placed on a shelf or put away somewhere by a die hard Doctor Who fan . To remove the disc from the book would probably scratch the disc and tear the page holding the disc in .
I would like to have kept this as a collectors item but that is just not practical for me . So I  returned it since I have already purchased the Doctor Who Collectors Gift Set a couple of months ago and each season or (series as they say in England) is individually packed as it was when each series was available for sale . So you chose ! Do you want a very nice collector item or do you want something more practical and easy to use ?",1420675200,7,710,3.7972972972972974

It's the ultimate set.

The packaging is wonderful. The DVD book that comes out of the case looks like a piece of the TARDIS, all worn, covered in Galifreyian. Each DVD fits snug and has wonderful pictures on each page.

Also, Blu-ray. This is my first Blu-ray, so I might not be the best to comment on the quality (I literally just bought a blu-ray player and then saw this on sale). It looks gorgeous, though!

Matt Smith is just perfect as a doctor.
He's exactly how i picture Doctor Who to be--nerdy, innocence about woman, energetic, so adorably handsome, and just brilliant as the 11th doctor.
He actually ruined Doctor Who for me. No one will be as handsome, as brilliant, or as lovable as he can be as Doctor Who.
I fell in love with him instantly but it's his relationship with River Song that made the 11th Doctor unforgettable and irreplaceable.
Way to go Matt Smith, i love Doctor Who before you, but after you... now it's sort of sad to watch because he's not there.",1497916800,,629,4.431034482758621

I have so far as played the first three discs up to the story of ""Vincent And The Doctor"" and there has been intermittent grain problems on (some ?) the stories contained within the first three discs that I have played. That is very annoying I can assure you. I in fact am in the process of going again through each story to see which episodes have the grainy problem and which ones do not. Or they all do. I am currently playing them in a LG Blu-ray/DVD player and viewing them on an LG 55 in. TV.
And the video setting on the TV has been currently adjusted to the highest video quality possible.
Is anyone else in fact having this same problem with these Blu-ray discs as I am. Would appreciate feedback on this matter to know that I am not the only one dealing with this current problem. Thank you very much.",1481587200,,910,4.2057142857142855
