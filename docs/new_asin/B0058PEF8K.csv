speaking people's should be denied this beautiful French charmer about a boy in search of a father and a man in search of himself.

The last movie I saw with a heart like this was ""Second Best"" with William Hurt but this one will have you smiling
as you root for this marvelous little French charmer and his quest for the perfect papa which unbeknownst to
his mother she led him right to!

No matter how improbable you may feel this scenario can be it will pull you along tugging at your heart strings
until you have no choice but to hope that all his dreams come true.

Until someone wises up and makes this available in English pop over to Vudu,(US); (in UK maybe Love Films or alternate?) and rent or buy it; I've done the first,
and I intend to do the second soon as I'm done here.

Oh yes, if you do speak French I envy you....you are so lucky!

Note: Please forgive the way this is printed up but I'm so tired of having to reedit all my Amazon
reviews after typing them up then having them scattered all over hell & back when they go to page  nothing like how I put them together!

I would think after all this time in the buizz they could figure out how to transpose material exactly as written and
not  scatter it to the four winds!",1363910400,,1356,4.168582375478927
