409 - Two Hits and a Miss - Ash comes across a young girl and her Hitmontop, who hopes to one day become shihan of her grandfather's dojo. However, her grandfather disappoves of her battling techniques. Can Ash help out?
410 - A Hot Water Battle - While the trainers spend the day at a hot spring, Totodile, Chikorita and Cyndaquil aren't getting along. But when Team Rocket tries to capture them, they'll need to forget their differences to escape!

412 - Beauty and the Breeder - Brock and Susie are reunited, but it seems like Susie has another man in her life! And does Brock have the courage to give Vulpix back?
413 - A Better Pill To Swallow - A sick Ash meets a medicine man who cures his stomach woes. Old Man Shuckle is his name, and Pokemon medicine is his game! But when Team Rocket steals a special Pokemon attraction potion and drinks it, in a twist similar to ""Love Potion #9"", they find Pokemon may be a bit TOO attracted to them!
414 - Power Play! - Team Rocket wreaks havoc on a small town and it's up to Ash to team up with Gary and is Umbreon to set things right.
Some great episodes here, though you can also get three of these episodes on the High Voltage collection VHS, but you will get a cleaner picture on DVD. ""A Better Pill To Swallow"" is one of the best episodes of the fourth season, and worth the purchasing price of the DVD.",1042070400,25,1861,4.32
