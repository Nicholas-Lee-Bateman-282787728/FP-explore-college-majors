8060257,5,B0009GIFIY,I bought this Workout as a training guide to get myself into better shape since it is in 15 minute sessions.  Unfortunately I have yet to start the program although I got it for Christmas with the intention of hitting it hard in the new year. Now in mid February it is still in the box.  I have a friend who is an active hunter and horseman in his early 70s.  He uses the program and likes it very much. He said it gives him a good workout for building mid body strength.,1423612800,,471,4.043010752688172
8060258,1,B0009GIFIY,"nO ONE LOVES NAVY SEALS MORE THAN I DO; HOWEVER, THIS IS A WORTHLESS WORKOUT ON EVEN WORSE OLD VHS TAPE. I LAUGHED THRU IT; AND IT WAS ONLY VIABLE TO WATCH 3 TIMES DUE TO HORRID TAPE CONDITION.

BOTTOM LINE; LOVE THE MILITARY HEROES, BUT AVOID THIS CANCKER SORE PRODUCT AT ALL COSTS!",1353888000,,283,4.2407407407407405
8060259,5,B0009GIFIY,"This review refers to a different Navy Seals workout version (3 in 1 DVD format) with Scott Helvenston.

These workouts are clear, simple and challenging. While the only equipment that is required is a pull bar, you may use the beginner's modification with free weights (which you will also need).

I am in no way in boot camp shape but still was able to do all the advanced strength exercises except the upper body challenges in their entirety which include a few back-to-back pyramid push ups (regular push ups, dive bomber pushups, and more). Yipes! After using the DVD just a few weeks though I can tell the shape of my body has changed and the inevitable soreness I feel from this hard workout makes me feel strong and alive. I love it more than any other strength workout because afterwards you not only feel physically stronger but mentally stronger as well! You just can't get that from The Firm series.

You don't need much space to do the workout.

The instructor is in unbelievable shape, friendly and motivating.

Two males lead the advanced and intermediate versions while one muscular female presents the beginners' adaptations. There are no fancy choreographies to learn and no women in thongs bouncing around.

As non-military, I cannot address how well this represents or prepares you for Navy Seals boot camp.

I purchased the 3 in 1 set (strength, stamina, and ISO workouts) for half the price by another (Navy Seals) vendor and just love it. Do an internet search for Helvenston's name and Navy Seals and you ought to find the cheaper, DVD version too.",1173312000,,1572,4.77859778597786
