3611784,5,B001GJOL4U,I know dancing is the new craze - but this is no fad. I love anything with dance infusion; this is one of my favorite fitness DVD. Very Flashdance meets DWTS. The biggest perk was how much it improved my posture - no joke.,1231286400,3,222,4.068181818181818
3611785,4,B001GJOL4U,"I Love Love Lisa Rinna!!! This dance body beautiful had me shaking my body in ways I never knew I could!!  This is the most exciting workout video that I,ve ever done.  Afterwards I went out and showed off my new body and my new dance moves.",1231200000,,241,4.1063829787234045
3611786,5,B001GJOL4U,Who doesn't love Lisa Rinna? I still love her from Days of Our Lives and want her body bad! This DVD got me in the mood AND I've already lost SEVEN pounds. I love my new dress size- this is a good one!,1231113600,9,201,3.697674418604651
3611787,5,B001GJOL4U,"I never really used workout DVDs, I didn't really know what to expect, but I absolutely love this workout.  Lisa Rinna makes it so much fun, and easy to follow.  It breaks down into four basic simple dances: Cha Cha, Jive, Salsa, and Disco.  I broke a serious sweat while doing this enjoyable DVD, and helped me practice my dance moves! Lisa Rinna is so adorable and has an amazing body; it just makes you want to move.  I highly recommend this DVD.",1231113600,11,449,4.373493975903615
3611788,5,B001GJOL4U,"This is an ultra-fun routine and is a nice change of pace for me once a week! I love that it is something different and the dance moves are easy to pick up. Believe it or not, you actually work up quite a sweat doing this video! I have one of her other dance videos and love it too! Probably not a great video routine if you are looking for a really intense cardio workout and there is no weight bearing exercise w/ this one at all. But it is alot of fun and nice for ""lighter"" workout days!!",1252368000,,492,3.9797979797979797
3611789,2,B001GJOL4U,"Rinna is likable, has a great body and dances well. But she's not an instructor, and this is not a workout. The slow sections of each segment go on for far too long, and during them, you are not burning any more calories than you would ambling across the room. And the beginning segments are not well taught. Rinna's counts and instruction (or lack of instruction) on ""Fat-Free Hustle,"" for example, actually make what is a rather simple step difficult to learn. I love to dance, and I love cardio dance dvds if they work up a sweat and have clear cueing. For all its bright and shiny production, this DVD was a HUGE disapointment. I'll stick to the 10 Minute Solution cardio dance DVDs for my calorie burn.",1248825600,,707,4.488372093023256
3611790,2,B001GJOL4U,"The concept is great -- the dances, and exercise, would be too, except it is very difficult to follow.  I have probably owned 50 videos over the years, attended numerous exercise classes, and have a gym membership. Lisa, and all the others are facing you, cuing you to use your right when they are using their right.  I have never had instruction where you do not mirror the person who is instructing when they are facing you, and I found it very frustrating to follow.  Maybe it's just me being a creature of habit, but I think not.",1236470400,,533,4.418367346938775
3611791,5,B001GJOL4U,"I loved this DVD. It was fun, challenging, & effective. I have a bodybugg like they wear on the biggest loser. You wear it around your arm & it tracks how many calories you burn. Doing this DVD I always burn 450 calories. I love it. I am 29 years old & I wanted something that would really teach dance moves, be fun, & burn a lot of calories. The hour goes by so quick & nothing else this fun burns that many calories.",1236297600,,418,3.988095238095238
3611792,4,B001GJOL4U,"I enjoy this one as much as the other - great affects from dancing and much more fun than ""exercise""!  Thanks Lisa!",1235779200,,115,4.2272727272727275
3611793,5,B001GJOL4U,"LOVE IT!
I did the workout and I mean I was sweatin'. Lisa breaks all the steps out first then you do it to slow, medium then fast. Each day I cant wait to put it in and do it all over again. WAY TO GO LISA !!!! Great workout. And her body is inspiration to keep doing it!",1234742400,,272,3.6271186440677967
3611794,2,B001GJOL4U,I love Lisa Rinna - I loved her on Dancing with the Stars...but her ability to demonstrate the steps necessary to use this work out effectively is lacking.,1234224000,,155,4.571428571428571
3611795,1,B001GJOL4U,"I really wanted to love this. The cuing is horrible. You get basic instructions to several dance steps, but no workout. Lisa seems unsure about what she is doing.",1232409600,,162,4.620689655172414
3611796,1,B001GJOL4U,"This is the first time I've ever shared my opinion.  This DVD is terrible.  I love Dancing with the Stars and was so excited when I heard Lisa was doing a workout video.  The moves and music don't work together.  Lisa's cues are poor and the simple steps quickly lose their way.
I am sad of the poor quality and returning the DVD today.",1231286400,2,336,4.203125
3611797,5,B001GJOL4U,"Wow, I have to say, I totally love this workout video.  Lisa is a great coach and is easy to follow.  For the first few days, I had to the routines at a slow pace, but because of Lisa's direction and the split screen that shows her feet, I am able to do the workout at regular speed now and it's only been two weeks!  Lisa has an awesome energy level which is inspiring for people like me who are trying to get fit.  I saw Lisa on Regis and Kelly yesterday and she's coming out with more DVD's!  I can't wait to get the next one.",1231286400,3,529,3.9065420560747666

8305647,1,B001GJOL4U,"Someone save me from d-list 'stars' who fancy themselves as teachers of dance !!  This DVD is beyond annoying... her management agency should be tied down and forced to listen to the whole tape for every voice grinding moment!

One season on DWTS and she's a choreographer?...(poor Louie!) ... I guess hubris accompanied by greed knows no bounds!  Her voice is hard to take, her cues, when there, are amateurish... all in all it's pretty much a waste of time.  If you want to dance and get a workout at the same time go to or buy a Zumba tape!!

Once day I'll learn... (sigh) ~",1341446400,,577,4.40566037735849
8305648,4,B001GJOL4U,"There seem to be two main groups of reviewers for the Dance Body Beautiful DVDs.  One group loves the aspect of the entire program, while the other group hates Lisa Rinna's cuing and leadership during the workout.  While I can see both sides of the issue, I've found that it's really quite easy to overlook Lisa's flaws and focus instead on dancing and having fun.

Like the first DVD in Lisa's series (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jive-Jump-Ballroom-Bump/dp/B001GJOL4K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jive, Jump, Ballroom Bump</a>), this workout is divided into a warm up, four different dance styles, a cool down, and a bonus.  The dances are further divided into four different sections: breakdown, slow, medium, and fast.  The breakdown is Lisa alone, teaching the moves slowly.  The slow, medium, and fast are the dances done to different songs at different speeds.  It's a really interesting workout concept that isn't done on many DVDs.  In order to keep up my cardio, I usually skip the breakdown and just do the slow, medium, and fast dances.

Lisa hasn't improved as an instructor from her first DVD, and I doubt she ever will.  She messes up and gets off beat a few times while her background dancers (usually) perfectly dance the routine.  Also, she calls out moves in relation to HER right and left, not the viewers; this can cause a bit of confusion and frustration to any exerciser.  The thing that is so likeable about Lisa is that she admits she's not perfect and turns that around to encourage you to workout even if you're not perfect.  She surprisingly is an inspiring teacher albeit cheesy.  Like I said earlier, if you focus on the dance, you can ignore her flaws pretty easily.

As for the workout...

WARM UP - This is the same as in the first DVD only with the cast in different outfits.  It consists of basic marching, step touching, stretching, and holding a squat for a painful amount of time.  It's sufficient for warming up the body.

RUMBA - Rumba was a zero for me; it felt like an elongated warm up rather than a workout.  My heart rate never went up, and I never broke a sweat.  The moves were a lot of SLOW sensual slides and such.  It's easy, beginner, and not effective.

HUSTLE - Hustle is basically the ballroom form of disco, although you can't really tell from this routine.  Regardless, this section is a blast to do, and it finally gets the heart rate pumping and the legs burning.  There are a lot of directional and rhythm changes in this segment, but most people should get the hang of it after practicing for a while.

PASO DOBLE - I was really worried that this would be another bad section, but I needn't have feared.  The Paso Doble has a lot of appels (raising your arms above your head) with marching before introducing some stomps, triple steps, and one jump step.  It's easier than the Hustle and is just as effective.

QUICKSTEP - Whooo, this workout is a killer.  You are basically jumping for the entire workout.  You start with a Charleston step, move into some pendulums, throw in some kick jacks, and finish with some corner hops.  It's extremely cardio, and your legs should be on fire by the end.  It's highly effective on an advanced level, yet the moves are easy enough for a beginner to master.

COOL DOWN - I didn't like the cool down.  I really wanted my legs stretched out more after the Hustle and Quickstep and my arms stretched out more after the Paso Doble.  I did some extra stretches at the end on my own.

BONUS - Every DVD has a bonus, and this bonus routine is CHA-CHA.  It's twisting, a move done frequently in cha-cha, done to a cha-cha beat.  It's quite fast, and it really works on targeting your obliques (side abs).  It's only 2 minutes, but it is effective.

Overall, this isn't a boot camp workout, but it also isn't a walk in the park.  I liked the first DVD better, but I've rated them both 4/5 stars because they equally bring something different to the table; this one is focused a little more light toning than the first one is.  I'd probably recommend getting the first one first to make sure you like the format and production of the Dance Body Beautiful DVDS, and if you do, I'd then highly recommend buying this title.

8305649,1,B001GJOL4U,"I was extremely disappointed.  As a DWTS performer Lisa should have known to mirror her moves when teaching.  The camera angles showed her hips when what I needed to see were her feet.  I would prefer a constant full frontal or back view so I can follow her.  Also the camera showed side views that made no sense.  I gave up after trying to follow for a full 40 minutes.  Equally discouraging was how the hustle was impossible to learn as presented, as was the Paso.  I wondered where the director and producer were when this was being filmed.  It seemed the camera person had free reign and was bored, so threw in creative shots that made learning the routines impossible.",1305849600,,673,4.5041322314049586
8305650,3,B001GJOL4U,"I had a hard time following a few dances because the camera seemed to move from feet to torso when she was moving the opposite demonstrations (ie, showing her face when she was doing footwork or showing her feet when she was doing arm work)",1298246400,,240,4.355555555555555
8305651,4,B001GJOL4U,"I rented this video from the local library because I was tired of investing my money into workout videos that didn't deliver. The dance moves here are invigorating. Although Lisa is kind and (attempts to) take her time showing us the steps, the choreographer (in the background) is drowning her out and the dancers behind her seem to leave her in the dust. She looks off the camera many times to get a cue as to what to do next. The dances are hard to get at first because she is facing me i have to turn around and look at the tape through a mirror to try and simulate her moves, it's frustrating, but I guess once I get the moves down and continue to do the dances to my own music, it will be an amazing workout..they should release a revised version of this workout using many of the suggestions from the commentators here.",1294790400,,826,4.301282051282051
8305652,1,B001GJOL4U,Boring...very slow moving..will not get the exercise you need as she stops many times and n you never really get started.,1277683200,,121,4.809523809523809
8305653,4,B001GJOL4U,"I broke my leg above the ankle in Jan and I still have the pin.  I have found if I get up and dance, my mobility is better all day long.  And I break a sweat which is even better.  I have noticed my clothes are looser, so all in all, for me, it's a good DVD.",1254355200,,258,3.491228070175439
