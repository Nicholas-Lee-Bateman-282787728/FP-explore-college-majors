3076402,2,B00124SNKM,"I love a good haunted house movie - heck, I love a fair share of bad haunted house movies - but I do not love Fear House.  It's not that the story is all that bad (although it is pretty bad), it's the fact that this film never manages to create any atmosphere whatsoever.  The only thing remotely close to suspense comes in the form of wondering when and if the nerdy executive-type girl will finally get to let her hair down and allow her underlying hot-ness out for all to see - and even that proved disappointing.  Fear House also suffers horribly from non-ending-itis, by which I mean it keeps going well after it should have ended.  It's like the director is a doctor who refuses to admit that his patient is dead; not only is no sign of a pulse ever detected, the corpse is left looking much the worse for wear from all of that wasted manic effort once all is said and done.

After a pretty silly opening scene shot in some kind of weird fuzzy-vision for no apparent reason, we accompany a motley crew of folks heading to a house out in the middle of nowhere in search of answers related to two disappearances.  The one that really matters is Samantha Ballard (Aleece Jones), a young and successful writer who went missing almost a year earlier.  Her brother Anthony (Matthew Stiller) and her agent Morty (Matthew Montgomery) - along with Morty's lovely assistant Fiona (Olivia Price) - have finally tracked her down and plan to bring her home - and to her senses.  For some murky reason, Eva Tinski (Meredith Barnett) thinks she will find her father there, as well.  Then there's Samantha's no-account ex-husband and his new floosie secretly following up from the rear.  Well, they do finally find Samantha, but she seems to have gone more than slightly cuckoo for cocoa puffs.  When she finally speaks, she warns everyone that ""she"" (the ghost of some little girl) won't let any of them leave - in fact, anyone who tries to leave will die a death inspired by their deepest fears.  You can probably guess how things go from this point on.

By and large, the acting in this film isn't all that bad.  Unfortunately, though, Aleece Jones reminds me of Amy Irving, which makes the pivotal character of Samantha about as weird and spooky as, well, Amy Irving.  The CGI and other special effects aren't exactly going to grip you, either, especially toward the end when the director apparently decided on the spur of the moment to try and pull off one spectacular death scene but ended up producing something laughably bad.  Despite all of these problems, though, I still might have given the film three stars - if it had ended when it should have rather than stumbling along for several more minutes.",1232323200,,2701,4.584199584199585

Instead I'll simply talk about how flat the whole thing was to watch.  The idea is pretty hackneyed, but there's nothing wrong with that, themes are used and reused in the horror genre all the time  - from countless Frankenstein themed films to vampires galore.  A haunted house story is always welcome if done right.

Sadly though, the budget here didn't stretch to finding a single decent actor.  They are all of the ""TV Soap Opera"" type, and at various times each of them are pretty annoying.  You certainly don't care about any of them.

The Director isn't doing a much better job, fumbling over creating any real tension or fear.  Take the initial dog scene at the beginning, it's bn edited with garden shears.  It just makes no sense the way it's been presented - but it had all the ingredients, including a bit of gore.  A second example if the opening of the movie - which has a flashback (oddly presented like they've applied a filter from some cheap computer editing software) which leads to what is effectively ANOTHER flashback which is merely a setup to draw others to the house/castle.  Awful.

Taling of gore - there's liberal use of CGI to add some scares, and overall I suppose the FX aren't bad.  However, a little goes a long way - and sans a decent story, direction, and actors - they put too much emphasis on the only thing they have left - the CG.  Pity.  Oh, and it' basically way too dark too, perhaps to hide the wanting se design.

So this is a 3, and that's for serious horror fans only.  Casual viewers might well turn off early given the ""shot on video"" feel (it's not a complete wash though) and the bad everything else.

3076408,5,B00124SNKM,"Relatives and colleagues of reclusive writer Samantha Ballard track her to an isolated home in the California desert where they discover her some nine months later severely traumatized. She greets them with a grim announcement that they will die if they attempt to leave the house.
After Samantha's ex-husband and his girlfriend suffer horrible deaths while trying to escape, the others realize that she was serious. They begin to scheme a safe way out even as the malevolent force that rules the house stirs the worst fears of each of them, causing them to wonder: Can they escape the evil house before their fears kill them all?
When I viewed ""Fear House"", I got the same feeling as when I viewed the film ""Phantasm"" in 1979, that the horror genre may have a new talented director. Of course Don Cosscarelli went on to have a good cult following of his films (Phantasm 5 is in production) and I feel director Michael Morris may have a better future ahead of him.
""Fear House"" doesn't rely on over-the-top gore and blood special effects, but the psychological fear of what really scares us deep inside. While trapped in the house, each person meets their deepest fears head on and it's up to them on how to handle it as to whether they will survive or not. This film is part Phantasm, part Evil Dead and part Black Christmas (the original). It's not what you see that terrorizes you, but your own sub-conscience is your enemy.
This is one of the most original and best films I've seen in quite some time.

Storyline- very predictable and about as UNfrightening as you can imagine, but I'll share what it is with you anyway-

A bunch of young people are trapped inside a house of death. If anyone tries leaving the home, they die outside the house somewhere. That's it.

The actual killings that take place involving the young men and women are really, really bad. A woman tries to leave the house, an animal attacks her in her car, and the next scene shows blood all over her face as she slides down the car window and dies. Not good.

Another guy gets electrocuted, and the scene that shows the actual exectrocution is absolutely laughable.

Another one of the characters bleeds easily, so he has to be extra careful he doesn't cut himself too often. His acting skills are probably better under different circumstances (hint- a better storyline).

A little ghost child appears in front of the people later on, and she's responsible for the only actual scaring you can expect throughout the movie.

Oh, and talk about storyline inconsistency- in one scene the floor carpet catches on fire, but later on when the people were *trying* to burn the house down, they couldn't light a fire to save their lives.

The movie does have some atmosphere in a few spots though, so the movie gets a little bit of credit for that. Still, this is typical generic writing and horror storytelling. Don't bother.",1264464000,2,1625,4.462837837837838
3076463,1,B00124SNKM,"Fear House (Matthew Miller, 2008)

When an early scene in your movie has three different people starting to try and talk a person out of shock with ""Hey Samantha, it's me"", it should tip you off that someone didn't pay quite as much attention to the script as they should have. Sometimes it's an oversight, but in the case of Fear House, it's simply a sign of what you're in for with this intensely stupid, boring piece of tripe. ""Did you think I picked this house on accident?"" Oh, for the love of pete. (And why do we call bad things tripe? Why not, say, sweetbreads?)

Plot: reclusive writer (Aleece Jones) buys old house (after an opening scene that tells you this is a really bad idea, but has no other connection to the script at all), then disappears for nine months. A number of people all descend on the house at the same time (coincidentally!) to find her: her brother (Matthew Stiller), her agent and his assistant (Matthew Montgomery and Elizabeth Price), a woman whose father supposedly disappeared in the house some time ago (Meredith Barnett), and the writer's estranged husband and his new girlfriend (Ryan Caldwell and Kiersten Hall).  When they all get there, the writer explains to them (in a somewhat hysterical manner, of course) that they cannot leave the house; whatever their greatest fear is will kill them before they make it out the gate. Two of the group try and die messy deaths (one of which has, of course, been set up beforehand so we can see the truth of the assertion); the others try to figure out how to get around the curse, while, of course, fighting amongst themselves and setting up stupid romantic subplots. The rest of the movie, not surprisingly, has to do with finding inventive ways to kill people.

To put it succinctly: this movie has not a thing to recommend it, unless you have a thing for really bad acting from really cute women. (Barnett, especially, has some unintentionally hysterical scenes.) You can safely ignore the fact that this movie exists, and you will be the happier for it.

This film is part Phantasm, part Evil Dead and part Black Christmas (the original). It's not what you see that terrorizes you, but your own sub-conscience is your enemy.
This is one of the most original and best films I've seen in quite some time.

If the acting was better, I would have given this four stars, but I can't and I give it three because of the good stuff. Some of the kills looked good. The acting was bad and the lighting was very poor. I could barely make out what was happening half the time. There was a sense of creepy that was evident, but then again there were parts that were supposed to be creepy and failed because of poor acting.

Storyline- very predictable and about as UNfrightening as you can imagine, but I'll share what it is with you anyway-

A bunch of young people are trapped inside a house of death. If anyone tries leaving the home, they die outside the house somewhere. That's it.

The actual killings that take place involving the young men and women are really, really bad. A woman tries to leave the house, an animal attacks her in her car, and the next scene shows blood all over her face as she slides down the car window and dies. Not good.

Another guy gets electrocuted, and the scene that shows the actual exectrocution is absolutely laughable.

Another one of the characters bleeds easily, so he has to be extra careful he doesn't cut himself too often. His acting skills are probably better under different circumstances (hint- a better storyline).

A little ghost child appears in front of the people later on, and she's responsible for the only actual scaring you can expect throughout the movie.

Oh, and talk about storyline inconsistency- in one scene the floor carpet catches on fire, but later on when the people were *trying* to burn the house down, they couldn't light a fire to save their lives.

The movie does have some atmosphere in a few spots though, so the movie gets a little bit of credit for that. Still, this is typical generic writing and horror storytelling. Don't bother.",1264464000,2,1625,4.462837837837838
3310960,1,B00124SNKM,"Fear House (Matthew Miller, 2008)

When an early scene in your movie has three different people starting to try and talk a person out of shock with ""Hey Samantha, it's me"", it should tip you off that someone didn't pay quite as much attention to the script as they should have. Sometimes it's an oversight, but in the case of Fear House, it's simply a sign of what you're in for with this intensely stupid, boring piece of tripe. ""Did you think I picked this house on accident?"" Oh, for the love of pete. (And why do we call bad things tripe? Why not, say, sweetbreads?)

Plot: reclusive writer (Aleece Jones) buys old house (after an opening scene that tells you this is a really bad idea, but has no other connection to the script at all), then disappears for nine months. A number of people all descend on the house at the same time (coincidentally!) to find her: her brother (Matthew Stiller), her agent and his assistant (Matthew Montgomery and Elizabeth Price), a woman whose father supposedly disappeared in the house some time ago (Meredith Barnett), and the writer's estranged husband and his new girlfriend (Ryan Caldwell and Kiersten Hall).  When they all get there, the writer explains to them (in a somewhat hysterical manner, of course) that they cannot leave the house; whatever their greatest fear is will kill them before they make it out the gate. Two of the group try and die messy deaths (one of which has, of course, been set up beforehand so we can see the truth of the assertion); the others try to figure out how to get around the curse, while, of course, fighting amongst themselves and setting up stupid romantic subplots. The rest of the movie, not surprisingly, has to do with finding inventive ways to kill people.

To put it succinctly: this movie has not a thing to recommend it, unless you have a thing for really bad acting from really cute women. (Barnett, especially, has some unintentionally hysterical scenes.) You can safely ignore the fact that this movie exists, and you will be the happier for it.

3310961,3,B00124SNKM,"Pretty good direction and a good idea for a Story. But horrible acting. The sets look good too. But don't expect much else. Short on thrills, long on darkness.",1240358400,,159,4.517241379310345
8243792,1,B00124SNKM,"After reclusive writer Samantha Ballard hasn't gotten in touch with her brother Anthony in months, he along with her publisher, his assistant, and the previous home-owners daughter all decide to go up to the secluded house that she had recently bought. But the house, as always is the case in these type of movies, is haunted and they, along with Sam's husband and his girl whom haven't been invited, appear to be in for one hell of a night.

And the viewer is in for one hell of a night of...of utter boredom. I'm really sorry but this movie just didn't really do it for. Trust me, I've since worse low-budget horror films than this one. A lot worse...by far. But at the same time the story didn't snap or crackle for me (nor did it pop, by the way). The deaths were too quasi-laughable and didn't really fit into the tone the film was trying to have.
