3015333,4,B000Y7U9AU,"I watched a few episodes of the first season of GIRLFRIENDS but had issues with it so stopped watching it.  First of all, I compared it negatively to the then cancelled LIVING SINGLE.  Secondly, I didn't ""get"" the characters and felt that they were way too over the top and fake.  Third, I hated the cut-aways to show viewers ""Joan's thoughts"".  I didn't give the show another chance until the popular ""church episode"" of Season 2 aka, Toni & Joan's reconciliation.  I became intrigued with what their fight had been about and if they could truly put their friendship back together therefore I decided to watch the entire third season & I'm so glad that I did!

As an avid tv fan I should know by now that sometimes the first 2 seasons of shows can be a sort of testing ground and that if you stick with the initial bad storylines, you get to know and love the characters as the storylines get stronger and draw you in.  On a superficial level, I loved the characters' Joan & Toni's wardrobes so in addition to anticipating the stories, I anticipated seeing what they'd be wearing.

During this season the strongest storylines were Toni's relationship with Todd, William's relationship with Monica and Maya's marital struggles & subsequent single status; another hilarious side story were the few episodes when all of the main characters (except Toni) were living in Joan's house.

The negatives about this season: I hated the pairing of Joan & Ellis because the two actors had no chemistry so their relationship was very boring to me and Lynn's entire purpose seemed to be the punchline - the appearance of her birth mother & her adoptive parents appearing to demand that she repay her student loans were sooo random and completely bored me but the strong storylines of the others more than made up for this lapse.

Overall I really enjoy this disc set and loved the two extras regarding the wardrobe & the production of Toni's wedding.",1220140800,,1937,4.704142011834319
3015334,5,B000Y7U9AU,"I love this show!!!  When I have a bad day, I just kick back, get me some real nice vino, and have me a laugh attack!  The one thing I didn't like was that a lot of the music was changed.  For instance, at Toni's wedding, I remember they played Teena Marie's ""Portugese Love"" and Shalimar's ""A Night to Remember"" when the show aired on T.V. On here, it's some different songs (that I didn't like!).  But I still love these girls.  They are my ""girlfriends"" for life!",1217894400,,466,4.25
3015335,4,B000Y7U9AU,"I adore this show so much so that when my husband and I visited the greater-LA area last year, I continually joked about visiting Maya & Darnell in Lancaster...only to be reminded they were moving back to LA for the birth of the baby - LOL!

I have a TiVO full of old Girlfriends episodes and was ultimately disappointed that the show was cancelled.  My only consolation is that I can find solace in purchasing each season that is released.  I was particularly anxious to purchase Season 3 to get the episode where Mya and Darnell share a dance in their little fish spot and my all-time favorite episode - Toni's wedding!  Imagine my disappointment when I noticed the songs in those episodes had been CHANGED!  Small issue...but really changed the sentimental value of the episodes for me.

Nonetheless, I am eagerly awaiting the release of Season 4-(incomplete) 8!  What can I say...I'm a die-hard fan.",1215734400,2,903,4.75
3015336,5,B000Y7U9AU,Girlfriends....wow what an excellent television show.  One I plan to view for many years too come.  I was highly disappointed when the show got the ax.

And I cried during that episode where Mya & Darnell were at the hole in the wall dancing together with such passion and tension...that really had me crying I couldn't hold back the tears and especially the music choice for that scene even the camera angles that they have never used before to capture the love that Darnell and Mya had for each other!!!!  If you want something full of drama,comedy,and a good cry this is your best choice to make...I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did!!",1207008000,2,720,4.365671641791045

3249830,4,B000Y7U9AU,"I watched a few episodes of the first season of GIRLFRIENDS but had issues with it so stopped watching it.  First of all, I compared it negatively to the then cancelled LIVING SINGLE.  Secondly, I didn't ""get"" the characters and felt that they were way too over the top and fake.  Third, I hated the cut-aways to show viewers ""Joan's thoughts"".  I didn't give the show another chance until the popular ""church episode"" of Season 2 aka, Toni & Joan's reconciliation.  I became intrigued with what their fight had been about and if they could truly put their friendship back together therefore I decided to watch the entire third season & I'm so glad that I did!

As an avid tv fan I should know by now that sometimes the first 2 seasons of shows can be a sort of testing ground and that if you stick with the initial bad storylines, you get to know and love the characters as the storylines get stronger and draw you in.  On a superficial level, I loved the characters' Joan & Toni's wardrobes so in addition to anticipating the stories, I anticipated seeing what they'd be wearing.

During this season the strongest storylines were Toni's relationship with Todd, William's relationship with Monica and Maya's marital struggles & subsequent single status; another hilarious side story were the few episodes when all of the main characters (except Toni) were living in Joan's house.

The negatives about this season: I hated the pairing of Joan & Ellis because the two actors had no chemistry so their relationship was very boring to me and Lynn's entire purpose seemed to be the punchline - the appearance of her birth mother & her adoptive parents appearing to demand that she repay her student loans were sooo random and completely bored me but the strong storylines of the others more than made up for this lapse.

Overall I really enjoy this disc set and loved the two extras regarding the wardrobe & the production of Toni's wedding.",1220140800,,1937,4.704142011834319
3249831,5,B000Y7U9AU,"I love this show!!!  When I have a bad day, I just kick back, get me some real nice vino, and have me a laugh attack!  The one thing I didn't like was that a lot of the music was changed.  For instance, at Toni's wedding, I remember they played Teena Marie's ""Portugese Love"" and Shalimar's ""A Night to Remember"" when the show aired on T.V. On here, it's some different songs (that I didn't like!).  But I still love these girls.  They are my ""girlfriends"" for life!",1217894400,,466,4.25
3249832,4,B000Y7U9AU,"I adore this show so much so that when my husband and I visited the greater-LA area last year, I continually joked about visiting Maya & Darnell in Lancaster...only to be reminded they were moving back to LA for the birth of the baby - LOL!

I have a TiVO full of old Girlfriends episodes and was ultimately disappointed that the show was cancelled.  My only consolation is that I can find solace in purchasing each season that is released.  I was particularly anxious to purchase Season 3 to get the episode where Mya and Darnell share a dance in their little fish spot and my all-time favorite episode - Toni's wedding!  Imagine my disappointment when I noticed the songs in those episodes had been CHANGED!  Small issue...but really changed the sentimental value of the episodes for me.

Nonetheless, I am eagerly awaiting the release of Season 4-(incomplete) 8!  What can I say...I'm a die-hard fan.",1215734400,2,903,4.75

And I cried during that episode where Mya & Darnell were at the hole in the wall dancing together with such passion and tension...that really had me crying I couldn't hold back the tears and especially the music choice for that scene even the camera angles that they have never used before to capture the love that Darnell and Mya had for each other!!!!

After viewing seasons 3 & 4 (which are verified DVD purchases and not the fault of Amazon nor their business partners) I can confirm that their disclaimer is true. In fact, NONE of the original music used during the original broadcast was included in these DVD's, except for the opening & closing theme song. The opening theme song (included in the DVD) does have the original singer Angie Stone singing however, it sounds more like she is singing through a long hallway with a terrible echo and this is not the same poor quality found in the original network broadcast. It's a shame that this show was never given a proper series finale and it appears that they put the same lack of consideration to their DVD distribution. For that I can only give it 3 Stars",1433462400,,935,4.672727272727273
