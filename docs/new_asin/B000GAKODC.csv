8129821,5,B000GAKODC,"This DVD lays things out pretty clearly and logically.  Contrary to another reviewer's criticism, I don't find the instructor's manner off -putting in the least. It never occurred to me. At worst--a bit dry. But, if that's what it takes to achieve a clear breakdown of Blind Willies' song types, then I'll take that any day over a bubbly personality that can't get straight to the point.",1406073600,,387,4.776119402985074
8129822,4,B000GAKODC,"Ernie Hawkins presents and instructs well as well as being a v. fine guitar player himself. Perhaps its not strictly necessary to go into all the 12 string detail and retuning - which is difficult to follow anyway as he assumes a lot of the learner who is used to playing six srings - but it illustrates his reverence to the original and one can easily adapt. Not that interested in the bottle neck pieces, but first tunes are great, and as always, one benefits by being able not only to learn these McTell pieces but adapt bits and pieces and techniques to other tunes by MCtell and other artists, which I'm sure Hawkins would expect.",1309046400,,635,4.482758620689655
8129823,5,B000GAKODC,"After reading the book of Michael Gray ""Hand me my travelling shoes - In search of Blind Willie McTell""
and because i just did buy a 12-string guitar, I was very pleased with this Dvd in which Ernie Hawkins
puts his heart in it to reveal the music of Blind Willie",1272499200,2,263,4.176470588235294
8129824,3,B000GAKODC,"As I always say in my reviews, I'll spare you from long verbiage about the exact contents of the item. Amazon does an excellent describing their products. Also, other reviewers tend to relate the content, so why go into it again, right?

So, let me get straight to the point with four thoughts about using and learning from The Guitar of Blind Willie McTell:

1. It contains a decent assortment of tunes, both picking and slide. No complaint there.

2. As often seems to happen with the DVD packages put out by Stephan Grossman's Guitar Workshop, the accompanying booklet doesn't always match what the instructor is doing. In this case it's especially bad: the recommended tunings in the booklet don't always match what the instructor on the DVD is doing. Sure, if you can play, you can work through it, but com'on, this is a really stupid mistake.

3. Ernie Hawkins, the instructor on the DVD, acts really put out to be there. I mean, he's almost unbearable to watch. It's not just that he's a really poor singer (I read a review in which that's mentioned, but this isn't a singing DVD so it doesn't matter), but he seems ill or constipated. I want to learn the tunes, however, so I'm sticking with it. Stephan Grossman owns the company that produced this set, and in his materials he seems interesting and is very engaging. I wish Stephan had grabbed a 12 string and appeared in this DVD; it would have been more entertaining and inspiring.

4. As often happens with white guys who have formal musical training, they like to get into deep discussions of using specific notes and cord progressions that I'm sure would have mystified and amused the (mostly) illiterate Delta blues artists they are interpreting. Hawkins can't resist, and he starts up with things like ""rather than progressing to the five cord, as you would expect, Blind Willie does......."" I'm sure Willie would have just shrugged and said something like, ""What ever you say, man. I just thought it sounded good.""

Conclusion? Enjoy learning the tunes. Ignore the instructor. Experiment with the tunings. Play the blues! (If it sounds good, it IS good.)",1238284800,2,2121,4.76566757493188
8129825,5,B000GAKODC,"I have tried looking at tabs and sheet music (I am a 30+ year trained pianist and musicologist) and I have never been able to get from what's on the page to the sound of these old blues. This DVD works - you can sit there and watch Ernie's fingers as he takes apart the songs, you can rewind and look at each lick as much as you want, and get all the questions that the tab doesn't answer answered. (What chord are you fretting there?  Which finger takes that note?  How do you pick that?)

Hawkins is very calm and mellow on the DVD.  The songs are all the ones you want to play. Only one caveat:  Hawkins plays the songs authentically, on a 12-string tuned down 4 half-steps (low bass note = C), so you can't play along with him on a regular 6-string guitar, unless you get all tuned-down and floppy.  But that's OK - I just watch a section about 25 times, and then try to do it myself.

Highly recommended.",1227657600,6,909,4.16
