8158643,2,B000KQF70C,LOL  The dance scene only brought to mind these words:  Whites with no soul.,1523750400,,76,4.357142857142857
8158644,4,B000KQF70C,"An 40-something couple decide they look old and frumpy and go to extensive lengths to look younger and hipper. Granted, they needed some work, but talk about going way over the top! They don't tell their daughter (who is at college)about the changes and when she comes home on break, she is way beyond shocked at the difference. One big gripe--I'm in my late 40's and I don't look as old and frumpy as this couple is portrayed. They look more like they are in their 60's before their transformation.",1232064000,,499,4.555555555555555
8158645,3,B000KQF70C,"This was not a bad movie, it was sweet and you can watch it with most of the family and not be embarrased. These days that actually means something. I love Perry King and Lauren Hutton. Priscilla Barns is silly and cute. Not a bad message either. There is one scene that may not be good for Kids under 13.",1208131200,,305,4.1
