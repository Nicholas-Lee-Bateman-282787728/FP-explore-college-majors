2846827,5,B000QUUD6A,"Everyone Have No Fear The Set Is In Widescreen, Thank Goodness!  I Am Glad To See The Last Six Movies Finally Out On Dvd, Especially A Widescreen Version Of Charro!  Not A Great Western But Hey It Has Elvis In It.  Girl Happy And Tickle Me Are Great As Well, Kissin' Cousins, Live A Little, Love A Little And Stay Away Joe Not So Much.  But Again They Have Elvis In Them.  Hey Warner Bros. We Want Elvis On Tour On Dvd Too!",1186617600,6,423,4.048192771084337
2846828,5,B000QUUD6A,"I am a big ELVIS fan... The six titles in this set were only on VSH until now. Charro was released on dvd before but quality was poor. This new version of CHARRO is wonderful... I can't find anything on the package that states it is re-mastered But I have just watched it. The color and sound are perfect. This Hollywood Collection dvd of Charro is the very best version I've ever seen!
GIRL HAPPY and KISSIN' COUSINS - On the back of each dvd case it states it is a new digital transfer of complete original theatrical version. But nothing about being re-mastered.
TICKLE ME, STAY AWAY JOE, LIVE A LITTLE LOVE A LITTLE - are all great quality dvd movies.
All dvds are widescreen version and subtitles are English or French *except Tickle Me is English only.  For each movie titled there is a set of 4 movie set pictures & 1 mini movie poster enclosed in each case.  Pictures are approximately 7 inches by 4.5 inches.",1186444800,82,917,4.420118343195266

2846832,5,B000QUUD6A,"This is really not a review of the box set other than saying it's about time they released ""Girl Happy"" on DVD. This is one of my all time favorite movies. Does anyone know if this box set is in widescreen or fullsreen format? Amazon is advertising it as a fullsceen version. I found another site saying it's a widescreen box set. These movies are sold sepately in widescreen format. Does anyone know?",1185148800,3,401,4.506849315068493
2846853,5,B000QUUD6A,"My son collects Elvis movies and I was very excited that this collection contained movies he did not yet have. I got it for him for his birthday.
I have not watched these movies so cannot rate the quality. Thanks for having this product available.",1219795200,,247,4.511111111111111
2846854,3,B000QUUD6A,"What is going on here, Warner Brothers? You guys normally do such great work with DVD releases. You have sixteen Elvis Presley titles; PUT THEM ALL IN ONE BOX SET! You currently offer no less than four box sets, no combination of which would give the consumer all 16 titles! I could get half of the titles if I bought the Blue Suede Collection. But this set overlaps each of the other three, leaving me with eight other individual titles to purchase. Or I could buy the Signature Collection and The Hollywood Collection, which combine to give me 12 of the 16 titles. Unfortunately, the Signature Collection is an older set, and it does not feature the new 2007 re-release versions of the DVDs. And even if I bought all three of those sets, I would STILL have to purchase Double Trouble and The Trouble With Girls separately. MGM has all four of their Elvis films in one box; and Paramount has all eight of their Elvis titles available in one box set. Come on Warner, help a guy out!",1207440000,,982,4.461111111111111

2846856,5,B000QUUD6A,"Being an Elvis fan, I totally enjoy watching this group of his movies.  I am collecting all of his other movies since purchasing this collection.  My favorite is Charro which makes me cringe when I see him getting his neck burned!  Wish his other movies were put together in collections like this as it makes them easier to watch--being together in one box.  Elvis had some talent that was untapped which was too bad.  Worth the money!",1202860800,,435,4.597402597402597

2846858,5,B000QUUD6A,"Great to have these films on DVD now, such good quality. Also arrived with lots of B & W postcard pictures from the films, which was a bonus. I know these films were not his best but if you are an Elvis fan it really doesn't matter.",1191456000,2,232,3.9574468085106385
2846859,5,B000QUUD6A,"Elvis Presley starred in 33 movies. Many of them are real classics. This box set is no exception. The brilliant ones are; STAY AWAY JOE and TICKLE ME. Both are excellent comedies. GIRL HAPPY is a very lovely musical comedy as good as the extremely popular BLUE HAWAII. LIVE A LITTLE,LOVE A LITTLE is also very very good and features some superb songs. CHARRO is a long lost Elvis Western dramatic classic. KISSIN COUSINS is fun,fun,fun all the way. A Superb value-for-money BOX SET. A must for all ELVIS PRESLEY FANS.",1188864000,,517,4.6923076923076925
2846860,4,B000QUUD6A,"It's excellent to finally see these long awaited movies come to DVD and in a great presentation box. The DVD transfers are very clear and each movie comes with it's own set of 5 postcards as a nice little bonus. My only quip is that not much was done with the sound. The Paramount Elvis movies are all in 5.1, whilst Warner only have revamped Jailhouse Rock and Viva Las Vegas (sold separately)with uprated sound.",1188259200,,413,4.52
2846861,3,B000QUUD6A,FINALLY we get the last of Elvis' movies on DVD (except Elvis On Tour)...Charro looks great! The others look OK but several song sequences are OUT OF SNYC! Who's in charge of quality control??,1187740800,,192,4.676470588235294
2846862,4,B000QUUD6A,"This box set of six of the King's less promient films is a long time in coming for his die hard fans-less juicy for your run of the mill Elvis admirers. Yes, all six films are in WIDESECREEN format, digitally remastered etc. The packaging is nice and sleek with all film sleeves containg several large postcard style B&W publicity style photos of Elvis with costars and on the sets. I will not do a critical review of the individual movies pros and cons, but speak to the group of films in this package as a whole as being what I would consider Elvis's secondary films. There is no film prowess of Blue Hawaii or Viva Las Vegas caliber here. As par for the course of Elvis's film career at this point most are of the light romantic comedy genre with his ample singing scenes tossed in. There are no sophisticated plots here-just Elvis, singing and girls watching him sing. Each film has nice menu and navigation graphics with all having the theatical trailer included. Girl Happy has an additional song of Startin' Tonight restored. They all have French subtitles except Tickle Me. All films are in color. Many of these films are out for the first time on DVD as well as in WIDESCREEN. Some of them have not been available at all for quite a number of years such as Live a Little, Love a Little. A good buy for Elvis die hard film fans and collectors at this low price for all six movies in such a nice package. They would cost quite a bit more if bought individually. Lesser fans that have none of Elvis's more promient films may wish to start elsewhere with individual film purchases of the King's classics such as Love Me Tender or the superb Jail House Rock.",1186704000,8,1662,4.452459016393442

look and feel of most shows done in the 60s. The way
people dress and do their hair is very appealing to me.
if you are looking for good Elvis movies you should pass
these up, but if you enjoy the early 60s look and feel
check them out.",1405900800,,296,3.8688524590163933

8197821,2,B000QUUD6A,"I'm an Elvis fan, so I don't enjoy criticizing his work, yet I would rather do that than to have some unsuspecting customer get ripped off. Why is it that so many movie collections like this are NOT among the best films of some actor, yet packaged as though they were? NONE of these movies is among the best of Elvis's career, yet it's given the title ELVIS - THE HOLLYWOOD COLLECTION!! Look these up in a good movie guide and see what I mean. Some of them have some redeeming qualities, but none has a great script, and if you like hearing him sing in his films, most (see exception below) don't have music to recommend them either since most of the songs in these are mediocre.

I do think that ""Girl Happy"" is a fun movie and the best one in this set, with Shelley Fabares going for it too. At least ""Charro"" and ""Stay Away, Joe"" from the late-60s are a departure from the stale ""beach movie"" types of films Elvis was stuck in by the mid-60s, yet ""Stay Away, Joe"" is VERY strange, and Elvis's character in it is an insult to Native Americans. I think the western ""Charro"" is a little better than the usually very negative reviews that it gets, although in it he sings only the title song. Another from the late-60s, ""Live a Little, Love a Little,"" has some decent scenes and songs (such as ""Almost in Love,"" ""A Little Less Conversation,"" and ""The Edge of Reality""), and for his films is unusually frank in dealing with sexual matters. Yet again, the movie is undermined by a poor script.
