8304317,5,B001G7FTGQ,Four movies for the price of one! Comes in a tin. All I wanted was V for Vendetta and the other movies are a great bonus.,1451692800,,121,3.6923076923076925

8304319,4,B001G7FTGQ,"This was exactly what I was looking for on many levels. Inside the metal box were the movies in their own individual package. The DVDs were clean, non scratched and worked perfectly in both my DVD/Blue-Ray and my computer.

Note that these are the widescreen editions of these movies, thus having a wide TV or monitor is recommended.

The metal box came with a sharp depression on the upper right hand side. The damage was hidden below the black 'ACTION' band. That's the only thing that I didn't like about the purchase. Everything else was spot on.",1415404800,,550,4.65979381443299
8304320,5,B001G7FTGQ,"I purchased this for my teenage sons for Christmas.  What a fantastic gift!  The tin is nice and gives the collection a quality feel.  All four DVD's are in tip top shape... great movies and the price was simply unbeatable!  This is the perfect gift giving item and if you like even one of these movies.... the collection is worth the cost!  I paid under $20 for the whole collection and feel as though I got a steal!

I not only recommend this, I would buy it again (and just may) for myself!",1320796800,2,493,4.247311827956989
8304321,5,B001G7FTGQ,"So I took the plunge and bought the tin. And when I got home, I am delighted to report I found all four discs inside in their own super-thin plastic cases with complete full-color covers. No filing problem at all. And the tin itself is actually kinda cool, so I can put it to other uses as well.

I'm really pleased. I can't wait to watch at least three of them. I'm just wondering if I should go back and check out the other Warner Brothers collector tins (""Drama"" and maybe ""Comedy"") that I didn't look at during my first two shopping trips.",1302134400,3,543,4.271844660194175
