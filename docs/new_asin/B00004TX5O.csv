1352943,2,B00004TX5O,"With the annoying elements of the book reduced or removed, ""I Dreamed of Africa"" becomes an okay movie.  Mostly this is the story of an Italian woman who, with her husband, buys a large ranch in Kenya.  I won't give anything away, but she endures various tragedies which provide the movie's drama.  The performances are good, the scenery is pretty, there isn't mush emphasis on plot. The ""Africa"" in the title is mostly scenery.  Not near as good as ""Out of Africa"".  ""Nowhere in Africa"" is the best film in the European-in-East-Africa genre.",975888000,,542,4.78494623655914
1352944,3,B00004TX5O,"Starring Kim Bassinger and Vincent Perez, this film is based on the true story of Kuki Gallmann, a divorced Italian socialite with a young son who marries a man who has a ranch in Kenya.  She loves it, in spite of the storms and the heat and the threat from wild animals and poisonous snakes. Eventually tragedy strikes.
While the cinematography is outstanding, unfortunately the script is weak and confusing.  There's a scene where the husband is injured and then saved, but it took up no more than one minute of the film.  It was so confusing that I rewound the VCR and played it again and still didn't know exactly what it was about.
When I heard that Ms. Bassinger was paid $5 million for this movie I was shocked.  She might be lovely to look at, but this role, which demanded a wide range of emotions, was way over her head.  The child who played the young son at 7, Liam Aiken, was wonderful though as well as the young man who played the son at 17, Garret Strommen.  Cast as Ms. Bassinger's mother was Eva Marie Saint, who did a good job in the role.  Now 76 years old, I can't help but look behind her wrinkled face and see the young woman playing opposite Marlon Brandon  in ""On the Waterfront"" almost 50 years ago.
Perhaps the book is better, but the script never developed several themes it introduced.  The story line, however, did keep me interested enough to keep me awake.  And the ultimate tragedy was so moving that I found myself weeping.
I can't recommend this video.  Just not enough going for it.",973296000,9,1518,4.424460431654676
1352945,1,B00004TX5O,"Please don't waste your time with this movie. It has little story, minimal scenery and average directing. I watched the final third of the movie on fast-fwd, it was that bad. For heavens sake, don't ""buy it"" if you do decide to give it a go.",972691200,6,241,4.260869565217392
1352946,4,B00004TX5O,"This film was a fluff piece that succeeded better as a showcase for Kim Bassinger and Africa's natural beauty than it did at telling this true story.  The first hour of the film was a succession of Kodak moments depicting the romantic splendor of Africa and how idyllic it would be to live there.  Although they showed the occasional storm and threatening wild animal, every effort was made to emphasize the positives.  They glossed over little things like the oppressive heat (Kenya straddles the equator but no one in the film ever broke a sweat), insects (not a mosquito in sight), and the fact that the rainy season is three months long and it often rains nonstop for weeks.  The first hour seemed more like an advertisement by the Kenyan ministry of tourism than a feature film.  It wasn't until the second hour that the story really centered on the characters.
Filming Africa is a cinematographer's dream.  Unfortunately, Director Hugh Hudson seems to have been so enamored with creating beautiful photography (and it was truly magnificent) that he rushed through the dramatic elements to get to the next helicopter shot of wild animals loping across the plains.  Many of the important dramatic scenes were not allowed to fully develop, giving a snippet and then cutting away to a completely unrelated scene.  This took much of the impact out of the film.  One example is the egg hanging over the bed.  A big point was made over the fact that Paolo had put something in the egg.  Yet, we never learn what it is.  Why tease us with this tidbit if he is not going to follow through?
The film had strong conservationist undertones, but they were tastefully done and not overly preachy.  The point was made that poaching to hunt elephants for ivory is illegal and unconscionable, but it was presented in a way that wasn't strident and smug.  The scenes of dead elephants made the statement in a poignant way, much better than any dialogue could have.
Kim Basinger was excellent as Kuki.  She went with a more natural look which was very flattering.  The understated makeup used in the film revealed that even at 47, she is still one of the most beautiful women on the planet.  However, after a three-year hiatus since L.A. Confidential, she delivered her second consecutive acting triumph, proving that she is more than just a pretty face.  Her acting was far more genuine and mature than any role I had seen her play before.  After having read an interview she gave about the film, it is clear that Basinger is a strong conservationist and naturalist and she identified strongly with her role, which imbued her performance with great conviction and believability.
This film was good, but it could have been much better.  I rated it a 7/10.  The locations and photography were marvelous, but the story's power was frayed by inattention to basic filmmaking tenets.  If Hudson had spent more time developing the characters and creating continuity for the story, it would have been an exceptional film.",969753600,14,3001,4.797665369649805
1352947,5,B00004TX5O,"(I dreamed of Africa )  was an amazing movie , very touching and convincing.  The cast was perfect , Kim Basinger should be nominated  for  an Oscar  for her amazing astounding acting . I loved the interview with  the real ( Kuki Gallman)  which (Basinger)  plays her . She's an Italian  women who goes to Africa with her newly husband and her son to forget her  old past and even for a change  , and the funny thing she doesn't know what  she's doing .

1352954,3,B00004TX5O,"Released in 2000 and directed by Hugh Hudson, I Dreamed of Africa stars Kim Basinger as
Kuki, a divorced Italian socialite who moves to Kenya in the early 70s with her son and new husband (Vincent Perez) to start a cattle ranch.  As her adventure-loving hubby leaves for days on end with his pals, Kuki faces great challenges  fierce storms, wild animals, brutal poachers, venomous snakes and worse. Meanwhile she must learn to live with a neighboring tribe while her mother (Eva Marie Saint) implores her to return home. Daniel Craig is on hand in a peripheral role.

Although this movie contains some spectacular African photography, the emphasis is on the hard life of ranching in Kenya during the 70s. The director is known for a couple of great or near-great movies, e.g. Chariots of Fire (1981) and Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes (1984), but here hes let down by a shaky script with characters you don't know or care about, except for the protagonist, Kuki. Some scenes in the first act come off awkwardly staged and unconvincing. The result is a string of events with not enough narrative pull. Still, I Dreamed of Africa is worth checking out as a companion piece to other true cinematic tales of colonial Kenya, like Out of Africa (1985), which takes place during WWI, and Nowhere in Africa (2001), which takes place during WWII.

The film runs 114 minutes and was shot in Kenya, South Africa and Italy.

I really enjoy all the landscapes of Africa that you get to see during the movie.

The story really picks up when this strong, capable, smart woman named Kiki and her family move to Africa. They follow their dreams and endure much, more than most ever will.  Kiki has a respect for life and nature and it shows.  Instead of quitting when things got tough, they dug in and became smarter and tougher.  They lived free and independent and enjoyed life fully.  We all should be so lucky.  Going on a safari would be awesome, living there and experiencing the wilderness they did, a whole other matter.

1353020,5,B00004TX5O,"I have professional friends who were on employment assignments in Nairobi, Kenya, so I had an interest in this DVD production about a true story in a best seller by Kuki Gallmann.  This production is a excellent chronicle not only of a Woman who left a very pampered lifestyle for the wilds of the Kenya countryside.  Here is a magnificent portrayal of what daily living was not only for her
but also her Husband and Son.  They faced the dangers of lions, elephants, very poisonous snakes, storms and even poachers.
HBO producers made an excellent choice for Liam Aiken in the role of the Son.  Liam Aiken's performance reaches such a caliber that I felt like I was actually there to watch an adjustment for a young boy who had to go to boarding school for an education, and mature in such an African lifestyle and environment.  Kim Basinger, Vincent Perez and Eva Marie Saint definitely portray life and loss in the African setting.  Nevertheless, personal triumph prevails.  The landscapes of Africa are superb.  This chronicle is not just about a woman, but also a Mother and Wife, who has completeness by the participation of her family and others who make invaluable contributions to that fullness.",1414368000,5,1203,4.805825242718447

I am fascinated by stories of people who leave the comforts of their existence to forge into a new reality of the unknown. This story did not disappoint me.

1353064,5,B00004TX5O,"First of all, the dingbat that wrote the editorial review should know that the film was NOT based on South Africa it is based on Kenya, and that they are two different countries.
Second, it is based on the autobiographical novel of Gallmann's life and the movie shows how Africa is a country of contrasts: beauty, instability, greed, brutal forces of nature, etc. How much you get out of the film is based on how much knowledge you have of Kenya and life in Africa.
 But even if you just take it at face value, it really is a beautiful portrayal of her life, very poignant and heart-wrenching at times. In other words, this movie will make you feel and is definitely worth watching.
I give it five stars because I am familiar with the novel and know that it stays very true to the story that really happened.",1320192000,,808,4.422818791946309

It was delivered on time. We had not seen the movie before, so we really enjoyed it and feel we will watch it many times in the future.",1316217600,,304,3.9193548387096775
1353067,5,B00004TX5O,"I watched this film mainly because I wanted to know what it would be like to actually live in Africa, a place I'd never been to.  I've seen other movies about Africa and numerous documentaries, but all fall short in one vital area, that is, capturing the emotion of the place.  However this film, I Dream of Africa, does that very well.

After the initial car accident, the film progresses kind of slow, probably too slow for many people.  But after watching the entire film, I can appreciate why that was done.  I believe it was to properly and completely develop the characters, something absolutely necessary in a film of this type.  Some reviewers here have complained that this film has no plot, no storyline, or even any goals for the characters, unless you consider their day-to-day fight for survival in rugged and savage Africa to be a goal.  This is true.  But it must be remembered that many TV shows in the past like, Little House on the Prairie, Bonanza, Gunsmoke, Dallas, and others had little in the way of a plot but were amazing commercial hits and held an audience for years.

The last third of the film moves along at surprisingly rapid pace.  Events happen one after another without much time for contemplation.  I think the reason it worked in the film is because the character development was fairly complete at this point so you, as the observer, pretty much could feel the effect it had on the characters in the movie and didn't need to actually see it.  Speaking of characters, I had my doubts that Kim Bassinger was the right person for the part.  She just seemed to me to be too fragile, too delicate with those baby blue eyes and golden blond hair to survive in a place as brutal as un-tamed Africa.  But she pulled it off brilliantly.  There is no doubt she is an actress of extraodinary talent and draws you right into the character with amazing power.

In my mind the mark of any outstanding movie is the following; Are you still thinking about it several days after watching it?  I was.  Even though it was only a movie, I was profoundly changed in my perception of Africa.  And when a movie can do that, I consider it a success.",1310342400,4,2161,4.5089974293059125

Challenges beset her, not the least of which is Paulo's love of danger and his leaving for days on end to hunt and fish with pals. She must face fierce storms, roving lions, venomous snakes, and murderous poachers, and she must find accommodation with a neighboring tribe. Her mother entreats her to return home.

Moreover, the movie raises awareness with respect to some of the pressing current events and challenges the Kenyan state faces: violence, poaching and lack of personal safety.

Although I did not think Kuki's character as well portrayed by the character in this film, I found her story well portrayed - truth is always more interesting & stranger than fiction, remember. Kuki is an amazing person and the work she has done for the people & animals in the area, without spoiling the natural habitat or trying to change the people's ways, is well told. The death of her son and husband, so tragic, has led her to different levels in life, where so much work has been done for the good of generations to come-I wish the film could have covered this but know that would not be possible.

I personally love everything about this movie, that's my opinion and yours may be different & that's fine. But please stop with the NEGATIVE comments about, ""white people in Africa"" stuff! That shouldn't even be mentioned in a review - it's uncalled for & sounds terrible. The story is about someone's picking up their life & moving to a different yet beautiful land, Where with it came hardships that were in turn followed by more determination. This woman has a lot of love for Africa, it's People & her dedication it preserve some of it's landscape with all it's incredible array of animals should be commended. She's doing her best & even if you don't appreciate her writing skills ... don't judge her because of the color of her skin. It's just wrong!

Personally, I find that this movie is beautifully put together & pulls at your heart strings from the very beginning. You will feel the excitement, uncertainty, love, pain & passion of the character's as they pull you into the story. I have over a few hundred movie's & this one is one of my favorites. As a bonus, some of the music is from the very talented Kenyan musician, Ayub Ogada (His simple & enchanting music will captivate you).

1353088,5,B00004TX5O,"After purchasing and reading Kuki Gallmann's best selling book of the same title and having loved it, I couldn't wait to buy and see this movie. This movie is as good as the book and gives great justice to the book. Kim Basinger gives an extremely heartwarming performance portraying Kuki Gallmann. Vincent Perez delivers a great performance as Paolo, her husband and of course, being filmed on location in Beautiful Africa sure makes this a movie worth seeing!! Excellent casting, excellent filming and breath taking scenery! I Dreamed Of Africa gives us a look  into the life of Kuki Gallmann, which becomes full of trials and tribulations. We witness her personal tragadies, incredible courage and her love for Africa which became her new home. After being involved in a terrible vehicle accident in Italy, Kuki fell in love with Paolo who was the husband of a mutual friend who was killed in the same vehicle accident. Kuki has a son named Emanuele, whom she called Emma. He in turn called Kuki ""Pep"". It had always been a dream of Kuki's to live in Africa and that dream came true after marrying Paolo. The family moved to a ranch in Kenya named Ol Ari Nyiro in Laikipia to start a life together. At first, Kuki realizes that living in Africa will take some getting used to. Having to deal with strong storms, the local wildlife and poachers turned out to be the least of Kuki's problems. We see her first tragedy in losing her husband, Paolo, in an automobile accident shortly before she was due to give birth to their daughter. We see Kuki's bravery in burying her husband knowing that he will never have the chance to see the daughter he was so anxiously awaiting. Kuki does give birth to a daughter she named Sveva. We see Emma grow up as his facination for snakes grew more and more. This worried Kuki very much. Emma would catch very dangerous poisonous snakes and would keep them in an outside shed. Kuki made her son promise to get rid of all poisonous snakes after she discovered them one day. He did not listen to her. The most heartbreaking part of this movie is when Kuki loses her son. That is a scene that is very hard to watch for you can not help but cry seeing what a mother will do in order to save her son's life. When he was 17, Emma decided to milk a puff adder and was bitten on the finger. A friend found him right away and had to go tell Kuki that her son was dying. Kuki ran into the shed where she saw her son sitting on the floor foaming at the mouth, dying quickly from the snake's venom. She immediately called for help but being many miles away from a hospital, there was not enough time. Emma's last words were..... "" I am dying mamma"". That was the first time he had ever called her mama and the last time. As the venom took over his whole body and time being against their side, Emma died. That scene was so heartbreaking and so sad as you saw Basinger give an outstanding grieving performance. I don't think anyone could watch that scene and remain dry eyed. So, yet another burial for Kuki but this time, it was her son. Kuki wrote and recited a lovely poem at Emma's funeral. She buried him next to Paolo at the ranch and planted a tree next to each grave. The movie goes on to show us how Kuki got involved in saving the black rhinos from the ruthless poachers by starting The Gallmann Memorial Foundation which exists to this day. After being told by everyone that she should leave Africa, Kuki was determined to stay... for Africa was her home. For anyone who has not seen this film, I strongly recommend viewing it. It is my dream too to live in Africa one day and I guess that's why this movie is so special to me but for those of you who aren't even interested in Africa, this is still a movie worth seeing because it is a true story and is truly touching as we witness what one brave woman had to go through. Kuki is truly an inspiration.",1140825600,10,3886,4.382271468144045
1353089,5,B00004TX5O,"This film is a must see. ""I Dreamed of Africa"" is based on a true story about Kuki Gallman, her new husband Poalo, and her son. The family makes the bold decision to pick up and move to a run down ranch in beautiful Africa in order to change thier lives for the better. Together as a family they fix up the house and live thier lives in Africa. The story mainly centers around Kuki's view of thier time spent in Africa, therefore you see her pain and her perspective of everything she went through to get there and when they get there. The film has a beautiful setting with a breathtaking soundtrack. This film captures the pain and love that Kuki feels over a series of years. The transitions from year to year are very smooth and the lives of the family are easy to follow. As one watches the family go through the beauties of Africa as well as the dangers of Africa one truley begins to understand the importance of their own life . This film made me want to pick up and move to Africa as well. It is truley inspiring as you see how strong Kuki Gallman was and is and how far she will go to help her family as well as people.

1353090,3,B00004TX5O,"I hate people who criticise any movie that isn't an art house and Oscar worthy experience.  I Tivo! a ton of movies to watch when I'm home during the day (I work at night and like to unwind when there is usually not much on).  This movie was not a waist of time, but I do wish I had gone to the gym instead.  The acting in the movie verges on soap opera worthy at time, the writing to uninspired.  Worse, there is practically no character development or motivation.  A series of tragic events happen and they're sad, but I as the viewer was left not even carring that much.  I don't know why Kuki did a lot of stuff she did, like marrying and moving to Africa, but after a while I just didn't care.  It was a beautiful movie and interesting to see what Africa is like, but there are a lot better movies to do it with.  By the middle of the movie I was ready to shut it off and do something else.  Honestly, the only thing that had kept me watching was I was waiting to see how she developed as a conservationist, but it was never developed.  Interesting and beautiful, but a let down.",1130803200,3,1084,4.119047619047619
1353091,5,B00004TX5O,"I saw this movie last night, and was absolutley blown away by the deep impact the story had on me. Kim Basigner did a winderful job in her part as Kuki (cookie). The movie has two VERY sad parts, and it seems almost unreal that those type of things could happen to someone. The cinematography is beautiful, as well as just Africa itself (the film was shot on location). I reccomend this to anybody who wants to see a pretty good movie with a pretty good actress!",1120608000,15,462,4.32183908045977
1353092,3,B00004TX5O,"Two things drew me to this movie: the lush photography and actor Vincent Perez, a favorite of mine; neither rescued the film from 2 hours of pleasant dullness however.  This true tale about conservationist Kuki Gallman treads dangerously into real-life epic territory. That is the filmmakers have the enormous responsibility of creating an engaging story without betraying the subject.  The movie never manages to do either, treading along in stunted, episodic fashion and never revealing an intimate portrait of Gallman.
Instead of a true character, we only see the milestones of her life. After a car accident causes Kuki (Kim Basinger) to reevaluate her life, she decides to move to Kenya with her son (Liam Aiken) and new husband (Perez). There, they test the limits of love and endurance, encountering every natural and human hostility that would greet an upper class European family.  In spite of her isolation and the tragedies that befall her, Kuki perseveres and in time becomes part of the African landscape she loves.
The movie is not horrible by any means. Few locations have the naked beauty of Africa, and its nature is seeped with such rawness that one marvels at Kuki's strength of survival. Nevertheless, other films have done much more with much less. As Kuki and Paolo constantly remark of Africa, this movie has a different rhythm, more of the stop and go variety. It suffers from a lack of plot and its dependence on disjointed vignettes that, although revealing, never cohere. I kept searching for a theme or two to materialize - a clash between Kuki and her adventurous husband, her battle to tame life, the land, and herself, etc. - and while the filmmakers likely wanted to avoid pigeonholing her life, we are left with even less of a sense of character.
Despite a weak script, superb acting bolstered the film. Kim Basinger impressed me once again. She commands this role with ferocity, especially with scenes between Kuki and her son. Vincent Perez, who has built a solid body of work across the ocean (""Indochine,"" ""Cyrano de Bergerac""), has yet to find a commercial or critical hit in America.  It's too bad because he possesses a unique intensity, not unlike that of Paolo. Charming Liam Aiken is a natural in his role, and Eva Marie Saint embodies every bit the mannerisms of a European elite who otherwise would not set foot in Africa but still loves her daughter for doing so.
This could have been a better DVD. Although there are some good features, including an HBO special, trailers, and score only track, I was disappointed with the lack of information on Kuki Gallman and her conservation efforts. Also, a feature on Kenya would have been nice.",1080604800,8,2682,4.887912087912088
1353093,5,B00004TX5O,"After reading all of the preceding negative reviews one who is perusing the ratings might be turned off by negativity here.  This is a good movie through and through.  What it doesnt contain is a lot of shallow and unbelievable scenes.  Basinger and Perez do an excellent job.  Most importantly it is entertaining and poignant, definitely bring a box of tissues to view it.  Great job - well done, the whole reason to watch a movie is to be entertained, not to try to justify or validate the merits of it based on some less informed know-it-alls.  So, ppplllllgggggghhhhhhhh to those who have nothing better to do than pretend they are paid movie critics.",1039478400,36,655,4.701754385964913
1353094,2,B00004TX5O,"I Dreamed of Africa is based on the nonfiction bestseller by Kuki Gallman, a European woman who settled on a ranch in Kenya with her husband and young son. The movie version seems curiously dated, probably because the idea of white settlers in Africa is so out of fashion. Ironically, it is now politically correct to think of this one great land mass as suitably for segregation forever.
The movie begins in Italy, where Kuki, played by Kim Bassinger, is a member of the partying set. On one night of revelry, she is nearly killed in a horrific car wreck. While recovering, she realizes how vacant her life is. She feels that the only worthwhile thing she has is her young son, Emanuele [Liam Aiken]. She falls in love with Paulo [Vincent Perez], a restless but charming man, and they soon discover that they have a mutual love for Africa. When he decides he wants to take up ranching in Kenya, it doesn't take much to persuade her to go with him, much to the dismay of her powerful socialite mother, Franca [Eva Marie Saint]. When they arrive, they find their work cut out for them. There is barely a road to their land, and the ranch house is a wreck. Kuki learns that chasing lions out of the front yard and elephants out of her vegetable garden is nothing unusual. Paulo enjoys going hunting with his buddies, but in Africa, these trips often last up to ten days. With no telephone, Kuki is often left to manage the place on her own, and this is her most difficult adjustment. It takes her a long while to understand that, in Africa, time has a different rhythm.
Kim Bassinger is totally believable as Kuki. You can see this woman running a vast ranch in real life. There is one scene in particular, a crisis involving her son, where her acting is as good as it gets. The photography is magnificent, although with Kenya and South Africa as backdrops, I imagine it's hard to take a bad shot.
Now for the bad news: The script is below par. The movie is filled with dramatic events, but most of them are disconnected. For example, at one point there is a fierce storm which nearly destroys the house. We see the destruction, but in the next scene we are into another subject, making the storm sequence pointless. The result of the script problems is that, while we witness several events that should be emotionally powerful, we wind up being rather detached from them. The native Africans are always in the background. This makes no sense, because for Kuki and her husband to control 100,000 acres, they would have to had have great interaction with the people. In fact, how did they ever run it at all, since, as the movie would have it, Paulo was always away on a hunting trip? These are just a few of the myriad script problems.
For Bassinger's performance alone, this movie is worth seeing, but don't expect to be swept away by the story. For more accurate information on the real Kuki Gallman, who has turned her land into one of the great wildlife refuge and research centers in Africa, go to her Website...",1016409600,5,3015,4.523809523809524
1353095,3,B00004TX5O,"This is a somewht insipid film, based upon a true story. It tells the tale of Kuki Gallman, a somewhat immature woman in Italy who marrys a man, Paolo, of whom she knows little. She and he, together with her young son, move to Africa, where they buy a large, rundown ranch in Kenya.

Having moved there to make a new life, she finds that her new husband has wanderlust in his soul, as well as a lust for danger and excitement, and is not much of a homebody. She is pretty much left to run the ranch and the household herself, while worrying whether her husband will return home safely from his hunting excursions with his friends. As they adjust to their new life, however, they form a deep love for Africa. Over the years, a series of mishaps and personal tragedies befall her, none of which make her lose her abiding love for Africa, where she chooses to remain, despite entreaties from her mother to return home to Italy.

The cinematography is wonderful. What is wrong with the film is that it is shallow and never fully engages the viewer. As a result, the viewer never really seems to care about the characters, despite the fact that Kim Basinger and Vincent Perez do all they can with the pallid script. Nothing is ever explored or fleshed out. The director touches on a number of themes, but all are passed over as if deemed unimportant. Consequently, the movie just aimlessly moves along, a pleasant, though unimportant, cinematic sojourn.",996969600,21,1448,4.586872586872587
1353096,1,B00004TX5O,"There's really no way that they could make this movie any better.  Seeing as it's based on a true story, I don't think there's any fixing it.  It tries to paint a picture of Kim Basinger's character losing everything but still having a respect for Africa, and tries to put this woman's luxurious turned hard life into a very dramatic light, but ultimately fails.  And there's not and real storyline or climax in the whole film, it's more like you're watching somebody's life, and nearly only the bad parts.  It would have been better as a documentary, I think, rather than a major motion picture.  You're left feeling depressed, and sad that you took the time to watch it.

1353098,2,B00004TX5O,"This is not the kind of film one purchases. This is not even the kind of film one rents. Perhaps the only way to see this is if one happens to catch it on some movie channel one night without anything better to watch. This film is not terrible, for there are many other films far worse than this. This film is simply pointless. Where's the plot? What's the storyline? If one were to sum up the story, it would go like this: Car accident. Sudden move to Africa. Lots of pretty scenes of Africa. Couple performing aimless activities around their hut. Bad things happen to man. Tragedy. Tragedy. Characters start to get hurt or die off when the writer has nothing better to write. The only saving grace is the performance by Kim Basinger and the other actors. The actors obviously tried to save this film, but alas, it was not possible. Strong performances cannot make up for no plot. It's like watching an ant crawl around on the wall. One tries to figure out where it's going until after a while he starts to realise it's going no where.",981244800,4,1036,4.429319371727749
1353099,3,B00004TX5O,"This movie was a true story.  It is the story of an Italian woman, played by Kim Bassinger, who with her husband, buys a large ranch in Kenya.  Unfortunanately, not everyones life is interesting enough to make a movie about it.  I wish director, Hugh Hudson, would have based it on a true story that way he could have added some exciting storyline and made this film a little more interesting.
Just when the movie looks like it might start getting interesting with an exciting event such a storm, the husband getting gored by a wild animal, or a possible conflict with local natives whoare poaching animals for ivory, the event ends and the story goes onto something totally unrelated.
Another big complaint that I had with the movie was that a big point was made over the fact that thehusband had put something in an egg that hung over the couples bed...
