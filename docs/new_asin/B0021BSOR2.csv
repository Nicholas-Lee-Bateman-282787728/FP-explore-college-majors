He also posed for a photo with me and made a great face in it.  My wife also had the pleasure of talking to him.  I hope to see him again in the future.",1427068800,,286,3.7
8348970,5,B0021BSOR2,"Quality video, fun extras and --most importantly-- smart & funny comedy performed by my favorite comedian ever. The audio version is great, too, but lacks the extras as seen on the DVD.",1396224000,,185,4.8125
8348971,4,B0021BSOR2,"I like this guy because he doesn't have to become grotesque, use shock value or profanity to make you laugh.  I watched this with my kids (high school) and no one was embarrassed.  We all thought he was very funny.  Saw him live twice.  Same thing.",1364428800,,248,4.326086956521739

8348973,5,B0021BSOR2,"Laughter is indeed the best medicine: I felt like a new woman after watching ""Au Contraire!"" As a long-time Finnegan fan, this DVD doesn't disappoint and is a fabulous addition to his portfolio. I loved ""Two For Flinching"" and ""Au Contraire!"" is a great follow-up. Don't miss it!",1242691200,3,279,4.833333333333333
8348974,5,B0021BSOR2,One of the funniest comedy specials I have ever seen (and I've seen plenty).  His stuff has the bracing immediacy of stuff that actually happened.  Smart without being obnoxious and funny without being puerile.  Highly recommended!,1242604800,3,231,5.361111111111111
