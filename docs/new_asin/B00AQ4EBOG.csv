8555893,5,B00AQ4EBOG,"Exactly what it says, a helicopter view of the largest city on Earth.  Amazing HD from above of a city that stretches to the horizon.  Hardly any buildings are alike, showing the wonderful art and science and engineering.  The locations below are indicated, but only with writing in English not voice.  So many gardens and libraries and museums and parks!  So many large trees!  What a place.  Some of the highways and railroad stations are indicated, but I hear that many streets--at all angles--are not named on them.  Must be hard on random walkers, easy to get lost?  From the included ad there are about 40 other movies available from the source.  I intend to look into those, since this one is so good.  One con:  you may want to silence the music--rock?  Everything from take off to landing is included.",1456272000,,810,4.659574468085107
