6130162,5,B00H3RT7M0,"An incredibly beautiful film set in Rio de Janero, Brazil with with exquisite performances by Miranda Otto and Gloria Pires.  Lovely score by Marcelo Zarvos.  Based on the true story of Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Elizabeth Bishop who traveled to Brazil for a visit with a college friend and to find inspiration.  There she met visionary architect Lota de Macedo Soares and a long-lasting relationship ensues with plenty of ups and downs.",1392336000,2,438,5.140845070422535
6130163,5,B00H3RT7M0,"I was sad to see this deeply moving, complex and intelligent story of the love between the award winning American poet Elizabeth Bishop and Brazilian architect Lota de Macedo Soares. so overlooked by U.S. audiences and critics. There are two outstanding performances by Miranda Otto as the outwardly shy and repressed alcoholic Bishop, and Gloria Pires as her opposite, an extroverted, highly emotional woman who coaxes Bishop out of her shell.

Very nicely photographed, this reminded me of the best of the Merchant-Ivory films. It's not flashy. Indeed there's a quiet to it
that is needed to off-set the melodramatic (even if based in truths) elements of these women's lives. But that doesn't keep it from packing a hell of an emotional punch, and in being bold enough to create characters we care for, but who are also deeply troubled and capable of making bad choices  just like in the real world of relationships we rarely see on screen.

It was also nice to see a gay love story that both acknowledged how difficult being homosexual was in the 1950s, while not becoming a film about that only. This is a film about a complex relationship between two highly creative and wounded souls who
both save and damage each other. The fact that both are women is only a small part of the larger story. It's also one of the only films I've seen capture at least a taste of the struggle and loneliness of the act of writing.

One of those quiet little gems that deserves to be discovered by more people.",1387670400,52,1497,4.680608365019012
6130164,5,B00H3RT7M0,"Forget for a minute this was a love story that involved two women and you will see it was a beautiful movie about two people, both very flawed, who happen to meet, fall in love, and then separate with tragic results.

In 1951 poet Elizabeth Bishop sails to Brazil on a freighter to see her friend from school, Mary. Mary is living with architect Lota de Soares Macedo outside Rio where they can pursue their relationship without being subjected to prejudice and animosity. Its there Elizabeth and Lota meet and fall involve, pushing Mary to the side. In what becomes a poly household Mary and Elizabeth fight a silent fight for Lota's affections and love.

Elizabeth eventually returns to the US and Lota is placed in a mental institution after suffering a breakdown due both to Elizabeth's leaving and the military taking over her country and her masterpiece, a park she designed and built over time.

the movies shows what difficult times a lesbian couple had in the 1950s in order to just live, hiding, keeping under the radar, and pretty much living in isolation. The scenery is beautiful and the movie, though slow, never causes you to lose interest in the three main characters.",1461024000,,1184,4.765853658536585

6130170,5,B00H3RT7M0,"Superb casting, scripting, and totally into it acting lift this film higher than its reviews.  American poet Elizabeth Bishop, closet lesbian,  travels to Rio and falls in love with brilliant architect Lota de Macedo Soares.  Bishop blossoms, winning a Pulitzer, while Lota plunges into a civic project that freezes out. Bishop, who finally accepts a one-semester teaching job in New York City.  Lota has a breakdown, Bishop's attempts to visit are thwarted by a jealous rival, who also intercepts their mail.  The ending is high tragedy.

Titillating skin scenes, as in the French ""Blue is the Warmest Color,"" are absent in this film; in their place  is the unmistakable tenderness of true love.  This is a masterpiece, told without judgment or prejudice.",1446854400,,756,5.139344262295082

6130176,4,B00H3RT7M0,"Forget labels.  Forget the fame of the principals involved.  This is a love story, albeit a complicated one.  It has its drawbacks -- for one, Otto's performance is slow off the mark.  (Don't get me started on the disastrous wig shots early on -- hello?  Wardrobe?)  And one wishes the story was more developed to reveal why the characters are as they are.  But the reason to watch this film is Gloria Pires.

6130178,4,B00H3RT7M0,"This isn't for folks wanting a happy ending.  It's based on the true life relationship between famous American poet, Elizabeth Bishop, and the bigger than life architect/designer/civic planner Lota de Macedo Soares, and their story did not have a fairytale ending.  But the movie is beautifully filmed, and American audiences will go crazy for the gorgeous and talented and very famous Brazilian actress, Glria Pires, who is brilliant as Lota.  This is her first movie in English, and her command of the language is astounding.  Ultimately, this is a story of a long love affair between two extremely talented yet very different women who lived a very real life together which unfortunately did not the happy ending I'm sure they both wanted.  Great movie although it does veer from the book at times for dramatic purposes.",1437177600,,823,5.022058823529412
6130179,3,B00H3RT7M0,"I had hoped for more from this movie, considering its pedigree: director Bruno Barreto (View from the Top, Four Days in September, Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands); the excellent cast, including Miranda Otto (Lord of the Rings); and the compelling true story that it's based on. I read the book ""Rare and Commonplace Flowers"" in 2005, and my late Brazilian husband, architect Sylvio de Vasconcellos, knew all the main characters personally, so maybe I was expecting more content than could possibly be squeezed into a 2-hour film.
For those who aren't familiar with the story, American poet Elizabeth Bishop arrives in Rio de Janeiro on a freighter in 1951. She has a ticket to travel around the world  and is taking advantage of the stopover in Rio to see her friend from Vassar, Mary Morse. Bishop is 40 years old and already well known for her poetry, having recently completed a stint at the Library of Congress in the position that was later to be called ""Poet Laureate.""
A self-declared lesbian with a string of lovers in her past, she soon discovers that Mary is living with Lota de Soares Macedo at a beautiful inland retreat not far from Rio. The scenery is breathtaking - and how could it not be? The views of the Brazilian landscape are worth the price of admission.
Hours after her arrival, Bishop bites into a caju fruit (the fruit that  bears the cashew nut at its tip) and has a violent allergic reaction that nearly takes her life. She misses her boat and ends up remaining in Brazil for 15 years in a mnage  trois with Lota and Mary. It's worth noting that Bishop gets by on a fairly decent inheritance from her family and Lota is in similar circumstances, only much wealthier. This is a story about rich people who have a lot of time on their hands.
Otto's interpretation of Bishop is delicately nuanced; she does a masterful job of capturing the poet's moods and quirks. Glria Pires is powerful as Lota. From the old photos online, it would appear that they each bear a strong resemblance to the real person they are portraying. Yet somehow I didn't feel the chemistry between them, or with Mary. While the compulsive attraction between and among them is key to the story, it just didn't work for me. Also, I didn't feel the characters age, or the tensions deepen, over or the evolution of the 15-year relationship. Lota ultimately has a nervous breakdown, which is blamed on Bishop. We see her go straight from commander-in-chief of an enormous landfill project (creation of Rio's famous Flamengo Park) to a pathetic shadow in a mental hospital. If Bishop was the cause of Lota's breakdown, as a movie-goer, I want to understand why.
On another level, I was expecting credit where credit was due in the creation of Flamengo Park. Lota is billed as its creator and ""architect,"" but the park was famously designed by architect Affonso Eduardo Reidy and landscape architect Roberto Burle Marx.* Lota had no formal training in architecture. Furthermore, the house where she lived, which in the movie she claims she designed herself, was in fact designed by architect Srgio Bernardes. He won a prize for it in 1953 at the II So Paulo Bienal.**
Still, if you want a movie that takes place in a beautiful setting and celebrates the accomplishments of two very strong, very independent women who broke the cultural mold of their time, you will be rewarded.

6130184,4,B00H3RT7M0,"I watched Reaching for the Moon because I like poetry and have enjoyed some of the poems by Elizabeth Bishop.  Elizabeth Bishop is one of the most highly regarded American poets of the 20th century.  She was also a damaged human being due to the death of her father in her infancy and the loss of her mother to a mental institution when she was a very young child.  She grew up in an emotional desert, Bishop explains in the movie.  The film is essentially about how she is led out of the desert (at least partially) by the female Brazilian architect, Lota de Macedo Soares. who becomes the love of her life.

Miranda Otto does an excellent job in portraying the emotionally restrained and complex  Ms. Bishop.  However, I was much more impressed by the performance of Gloria Pires as Lota.  She is both charismatic and compelling as the strong-willed Lota.  Where the film fails for me is in the chemistry between the two actors.  To put it bluntly, there is none.  Since the movie is basically the story of their relationship, this is a major shortcoming which is why I am only rating it 3.5 stars  (since Amazon doesn't allow half stars I am rounding up.)

The film has other merits--it is almost worth watching for the scenery alone and the story is basically interesting.  I think it will appeal mainly to literature fans and/or to those interested in lesbian relationships. In that regard, I just wish the love story had been more convincing.",1425686400,,1448,4.60546875

The sets and cinematography are beautiful, the acting is amazing, the music great, the story is fascinating and the script intelligent, layered and dimensional. If I had to put my finger on it, I would say things are a bit too matter of fact with little organic evolution of character towards the events that occur, Im not sure. Its a movie I can recommend and say I loved all of the elements of. For me it failed to connect the pieces in a cohesive organic way. I knew nothing of these people and the only reason I can imagine is because they were women.

6130219,4,B00H3RT7M0,"This is not the lez-themed movie to watch for beautiful-hot leads and sexy-graphic lesbian sex (there's nothing graphic).  Don't come here for that.  You won't even get a happy ending.  It's full of dysfunctional relationship dynamics, alcoholism, adultery, depression, one bitter ex, and more... softened by the juxtaposition of a breathtaking Brazilian setting and two brilliant women with respectable celebrity status in each of their own countries... women that, despite everything dark here, kinda gave this a fairy tale kinda romance feel.

Set in 1950s Brazil, this is a film based on the true love story between Pulitzer Prize-winning American poet Elizabeth Bishop and aristocratic Brazilian architect Lota de Macedo Soares (who planned and built Flamengo Park in Rio de Janeiro).  During what was meant to be a short visit to Brazil in 1951, Bishop meets the very domineering and charismatic Lota and stays 15 years.

What the other reviews don't bother to tell you is that Lota is not single when Bishop shows up.  Bishop is actually visiting an old college friend named Mary who is the long-time girlfriend of Lota.  And they never quite break up despite this 15-year romance... they just make other arrangements.  And Mary never moves out.  It's more about three women, in my opinion.  It's a strange dynamic indeed... often sad and awkward.  At its worst, it's a house with one drunk, one mega control freak, and one ex who has no intention of ever going away.  Too true to life for ya??  ha ha.  Enjoy.

The cinematography is lovely.  The acting pretty good.  The plot is interesting enough.  And these older-side leads become appealing in their own way once you get to know them.  Overall, it's a lot better than the majority of lesbian-themed movies out there for sure.  But I was disappointed that the very interesting relationship dynamic these women shared didn't find its way into the bedroom at all.  Totally opposite personalities and I could see the mental attraction of opposites and those control dynamics... but that chemistry didn't carry over into the bits of intimacy portrayed.  They just seemed awkward when they touched.

And... ack.  It's got ALL the most depressing and negative elements of everything media-controlled lesbian we are slowly re-envisioning these last 20 years, especially... and I really wish more lez-positive stories with happy endings would be selected and adapted into film from the explosion of lesfic this past decade.  Even so, because it is a bio of two very real and interesting women in our history... it's definitely worth a watch.",1397779200,,2593,5.056603773584905

6130225,4,B00H3RT7M0,Great deep love triangle between three women. Beautiful Brazil scenes. This is a true life film with a deep ending.,1395705600,,115,4.8
6130226,5,B00H3RT7M0,"After you have watched as many gay films as I have you get use to the same old thing.  Bad plots with good acting, good plots with bad acting, bad plots with bad acting. Pick one and you will have it in most lesbian films. This one really was a great surprise. I took the previous reviews with a grain of salt but I have to agree with the majority.

Excellent movie based on real people. Enjoyed the Brazil scenery and going through the journey with the two women. A good love story that happens to involve two women. Excellent acting. Love scenes were not over done.

Rent it or buy it. Either way you will not go wrong.",1395532800,26,621,4.201680672268908
6130227,5,B00H3RT7M0,"It is cause for celebration that finally someone is acknowledging the very existence of the most important woman poet of the Twentieth Century.
The film was interesting, poetic and even if it was ""based on a true story,"" thought provoking.
I recommend the film and of course Bishop's work.  I believe knowing her work and familiarity of several biographies enhances the film's characters, plot and appeal.
Don't miss it.",1395100800,9,420,5.086956521739131

6130229,5,B00H3RT7M0,"From the Five Element energy perspective, this movie is about an incredible relationship between two very opposite women.

6130230,4,B00H3RT7M0,"Never heard of the poet Elizabeth Bishop or her relationship with her Brazilian partner in the 50's and 60's, so it's always a treat to be educated as well as entertained. You will find this story infuriating and exciting at the same time - what a different time the world was then - in some ways more understanding, in many ways not.  Loved it!  Great performances.",1394755200,4,366,4.53030303030303
6130231,5,B00H3RT7M0,"I was really surprised at the level of acting and overall quality of this film. Let me explain- lesbian films or lesbian themed films that aren't directed by directors with lots of cred (see The Kids Are Alright), usually leave a LOT to be desired. Poor acting, poor dialogue, silly plots, cheap production, and unfortunate endings are only some of the problems facing lesbian cinema. I had no idea that this was based on a true story, and that made it more depressing- but that's okay because it was beautifully shot, acted, casted, produced, written, etc., that I wasn't mad. This was not a cheesy lesbian film. This is quality cinema that just happened to be about a lesbian relationship(s). Thank you, Reaching for the Moon!! Very nice. I wish there were more films like this and less like It's in the Water, Some Prefer Cake, Chutney Popcorn, Go Fish, A Perfect Ending, etc. If The Kids Are Alright hadn't showcased such big names as Annette Bening, Julianne Moore, Mark Ruffalo, and Josh Hutcherson and Mia Waskjkjilhlssalla, and I could get over the hotness that was Annette Bening and Julianne Moore in a lesbian relationship, then I would say that Reaching for the Moon actually did it better. (The fatal flaw in The Kids Are Alright was that someone thought it would be better or more realistic if one of the women had an affair with a man. Come ON!!!) Rent this film, buy it, whatever. Just watch it, because it was a major achievement in lesbian cinema. Just like Blue Is the Warmest Color- another stellar lesbian cinematic achievement.",1394496000,13,1549,4.7407407407407405

6130233,4,B00H3RT7M0,A movie with depth and sensitivity.  Set in Rio De Janeiro a rich landscape and architecture are exquisite delights.  It's rich to witness the poet morph into her authenicity.,1394150400,,175,5.0

8629574,2,B00H3RT7M0,"Before viewing the film I watched the DVD interviews with the main characters.  One of the questions asked was ""How did you prepare for your role?"" The lead actress - Gloria Pires - said she did a role-reversal with a male actor.  He played the woman and she played the man.  I was perplexed by that response.  After watching 3/4 of this movie I turned it off.  The scenery was visually stunning.  That was the best part.  As for the two female leads, their chemistry was close to zero.  But no wonder ... one of them was playing a man.  This movie is not a lesbian love story  A woman playing a man is not a lesbian; it is a woman playing a man.  I was very disappointed with this film. I think it would have been a far better movie had the lead spent some time in conversation with a lesbian in love.  That might have better prepared her for her role as a woman in love with another woman.",1473033600,,891,4.146198830409356
