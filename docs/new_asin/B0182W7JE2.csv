7538698,5,B0182W7JE2,"[Note: This is a review of the film Black Mountain Side (which I saw at the HP Lovecraft Film Festival), as the DVD is not out yet.]

This is one of the best horror films I've seen in years.  It is beautifully shot atmospheric horror interspersed with genuinely terrifying moments.  Archaeologists working on a dig in the remote northern Canadian wilderness unearth a strange structure that seems out of place.  Then odd things begin to happen...

It's basically a love letter to John Carpenter's The Thing, with a dash of Donnie Darko.  If you like The Thing or Alien or The Shining, you'll probably really like this.  It does have some gore (including one particularly memorable scene involving an axe), but this is more of what I would call a mature, intelligent horror film.",1452643200,14,778,4.7611940298507465

I would give a  minus 10 if it were available.",1504915200,,69,3.6
7538701,4,B0182W7JE2,It's kind of like the thing without the effects but that said it's well acted and directed. I kind of liked it and after it was over kept thinking about it. There are some story problems  where things aren't explained but it has a interesting tone.,1504483200,,248,4.391304347826087
7538702,5,B0182W7JE2,"This not a ""hidden gem"" . . . this is the entire diamond mine.

I consider this to be the best movie of any genre in the past 30+ years. Period.

BUT . . .  I personally feel that almost everyone that has reviewed or commented on it anywhere is not quite understanding it's Intellectuality . . .and it's moral, social, environmental and religious implications.  Albeit classified as, this is not a horror movie, and it is the furthest it can be from The Thing which I keep seeing mentioned.

Listen to every word of dialogue - it is ALL important.  This movie is about Mankind - it's perceived domain over Animals and all life forms, it's gross disrespect of nature, lessons on overpopulation and environmental destruction, it's ignorance and lack of respect for ancient cultures and history . . . and finally, the deifying of science over the natural world. . . conveniently packaged and veiled in The Thing's DVD case.  I even pick up vague parallels with novels such as Watership Down, Revolt of the Animals and Animal Kingdom . . . and there is a lot of ancient religion here.

This is a magnitude 10 earthquake of a morality tale that every human being should have to watch before the onset of the formative years. It teaches a lesson that modern cinema has forgone in favor of profit and effects. There are no big names here . . . no exorbitant budget . . . no soundtrack . . .just sheer master movie making with stunning cinematography that is vitally important to the story, superb and believable acting . . . and a lesson that every human should heed - we are only self-imposed at the top of the food chain and beliefs that are much older are much more powerful.  It subtlety begs and pleads with you to open your eyes and see who the real antagonist is.

The final 5 minutes of this movie are probably the most satisfying I have ever seen.

This isn't an art film.  This isn't an Indie film.  This isn't a horror film.  Actually, I don't consider this a film.  I, myself, consider this a work on non-fiction . . . and an absolutely brilliant one at that.",1503619200,3,2064,4.423280423280423
7538703,1,B0182W7JE2,"A slow , ill conceived, messy horror movie that could have been good. I fell for the ancient archeological dig thing right off. Bad portrayal of Docs and Scientists. Gory with no contribution to the movie at all. Misleading write up. Poor drama, it's not a thriller, just useless horror. not worth free.",1503446400,,303,4.735849056603773
7538704,2,B0182W7JE2,"Decent cast, a couple of really good actors, very thin plot and the script might have worked as a 30 min TV episode but was way to thinly stretched for the running time. Very disappointing conclusion.",1502928000,,200,4.583333333333333
7538705,1,B0182W7JE2,"Painfully slow. Ridiculous script. I kept hoping for plot redemption. None. They chop off a guy's arm and stand around. Another guy cuts off his own arm and they stand around talking. The doctor performs an autopsy, and they stand around and talk about the ""octopus"" cells taking over the body...and they stand around the body some more, talking about how it's probably contagious. After the wood starts talking, telling one of the men to kill, I shut it off. Reminded me something middle school students might write and create.",1502755200,,528,4.877777777777778
7538706,4,B0182W7JE2,"This film started out extremely interesting. The archeological dig,the strange artifacts,etc. The terror and mystery built very slowly,starting with the mysterious and brutal killing of the pet cat,belonging to one of the men. I felt that the story-line kind of climaxed with the discovery of the octopus DNA virus that was apparently spreading throughout the men,causing both crazy behavior and amputations.
  This was interesting and would have been great if that idea had been followed to a conclusion. But the story takes an abrupt turn,and that entire aspect is just forgotten; when a few of the men begin to see what can only be explained as a large stuffed deer walking on its hind legs. It speaks to them in a gruff nasty voice and compels them to hurt and or kill each other.
  The only way this could make sense,is if it were some sort of a guardian type spirit. It does not want the men to leave ,because they are all infected?The native tribes in the area,seem to know a bit more about whatever is going on. It is explained that they set bear traps up surrounding the dig site ,many years before. It is one of these traps that gets the last man trying to escape the site,at the very end.
  But we are never really given an explanation as to what exactly it was that they had discovered.
Why the supply drops ,suddenly stopped? Why the tribal workers ,ran off in the middle of the night,and never returned? The film was good,worth a watch,but it could have been perfect if there had not been so many loose ends. It would be great if they made a part 2.",1502668800,2,1563,4.524822695035461
7538707,4,B0182W7JE2,This is a good movie. It's a slow burn movie that has you wondering what it was all about at the end. But in a good way. Somethings are left buried for a reason.,1502150400,,161,3.764705882352941
7538708,2,B0182W7JE2,"It's a stretch to recommend this messy, mostly extremely illogical horror movie. But there is actually a lot going for it. I stopped it 3 times to keep giving it a chance. It was so close to being a good to great film.

But we had the claim of an archaeological science station in the arctic, which this was not, more like some one else mentioned, somebody's cabin in Vermont...and we had an archaeologist pronouncing what I believe was supposed to be ""Katchina"" --sacred figures of the Southwestern Pueblo Peoples  which have huge masks of sometimes animal, sometimes fantastical figures but always representative of forces of nature or the supernatural required to keep the cycles of planting and harvesting going. This ""archaeologist"" pronounced it more like ""cicada"" or ""chicana"", which was a signal the research the writers or somebody did, along with direction was less than useful at ensuring some kind of baseline believability.

There was also spontaneous auto-amputation, and the research station's doctor pretty much ignored the implications.
The premise was great, and some of the horrors believable. Normally, I wouldn't have watched after hearing the lead archaeologist screwing up all kinds of common terminology again and again.

What kept me watching?  Camera work and sound quality.  Both surprisingly good for a C-list low budget horror movie. The absence of background music or manipulative booming soundtrack was so refreshing! That's part of what held my attention.

Hope the filmmakers and writer learned from the obvious problems and try another go at naturalistic horror.",1501977600,,1596,5.25984251968504
7538709,5,B0182W7JE2,"Another reviewer called this ""a great cerebral horror flick"" and I have to agree. I also quite enjoyed the silence in the movie - that is the lack of a music track that ""tells"" you what to feel about what is coming next. The question of how much was real and how much was part of their hallucinations is not answered - that is good. And the ending certainly isn't Hollywood - which may be what turned off so many of the other reviewers. There are some precedents for the situation that they find themselves in, micro-organisms surviving millennia in a frozen state. The use of terms like Clovis culture and Mesoamerica gave it a plausible patina of science - certainly more and better explained than you find in Star Wars. Don't expect eye-dazzling special effects - but they aren't needed here.",1501891200,,795,4.605633802816901

7538715,3,B0182W7JE2,"If this was a first effort at producing and directing psychological horror then it is a fine attempt.  So many little things would have improved the story line and made this an excellent movie. To start with, if the directors had used the professor as the focus of the movie and only showed us the slow decent into madness from his perspective so that some of the actual horror takes place off camera but is alluded too through him coming onto the scene would have given a greater impact upon coming across these scenes.  The movie would thus begin with his arrival and then we are introduced to the other characters playing cards.  Inside jokes that we don't understand, as the professor would not, would help establish that these guys have been here far too long already and know each other really well.  Next, the writer needed to spend more time on the archaeological site and give us the impression that perhaps it was the cause of the madness and not the isolation but the introduction of the deer thing takes away our ability to wonder if they are seeing things or these things are real.  Again by focusing on one character and watching things happen around him would leave it to the viewer to decide if the events that happen are a result of isolation or the thing they dug up.  My last suggestion on here, but not the last little thing I would change, is to have the guys shut up in cabins several times during the events because of weather.  This reinforces the continues statements made by the guys about the terrible weather and helps us view ""hours"" of being cooped up rather than the seeming freedom that all of the characters have to come and go as they want.  Just a few changes like this and the film really would have been good.",1501286400,2,1746,4.485804416403785

7538718,4,B0182W7JE2,"This movie has become one of my new favorites. It isn't a monster movie, it truly isn't even a character study. What is it then? It's a glimpse into the minds of people who would find themselves in that situation. What is real? What is hallucination? Can the situations faced by the characters cause the blurring of reality? The movie doesn't explain what is real, it simply presents a series of events viewed through multiple sets of eyes and lets the viewer decide what really happened. The cinematography is superb, but it suffers from poor special effects (though since they were all practical instead of CG, that can be overlooked), and some lack of good performances by the cast. The ending is a bit abrupt, but I felt that heightened the movie by creating that ""Wait...WHAT??"" moment during the final credits that makes you think about the movie as you walk away. Overall, 4/5 for an indie with great atmosphere that could have benefited from better acting.",1500854400,,964,4.778443113772455
7538719,2,B0182W7JE2,"The real horror in this film is being stuck in a closed cabin with all those boring chain smokers.

I found this to be a real horror movie, even though it wasn't a fast-paced plot, the fact that it took so long to unfold, makes it scarier.

Sadly, it does not quite have the actual drama of either THE THING or THE SHINING, largely because the characters remain to the end essentially interchangeable.  That's too bad, because the setup (before things start going wrong for the characters) had some real promise, and the movie at least did maintain an ambiguity about whether or not anything actually supernatural was happening.",1499904000,2,510,4.9186046511627906

There was never a clear reason why things happened to these people at all. Just vagueness and not enough facts for the viewer to make an informed decision either.

Did the local natives leave or were they killed?  Did they warn anyone else about what was happening?  The ending was way too abrupt.  I was actually really taken aback when the credits rolled.  I thought the film skipped on my end....but nope, it had indeed just ended abruptly.

I give it 3 stars for the cinematography.  It was really well done and quite beautiful in some shots.  The acting, while not the best, was not horrible either.

Where to start?...  The are working out of something that looks like a somebody's cabin in Vermont. The Arctic is an almost uninhabitable place for humans. There is constant talk of volatile weather and the 50 below temperatures, for but most of the film the sky is clear and sunny.  They would most likely freeze in that cabin.

The fellow who flew in to assess the next grant reamed them out because they were unprepared medically for a limb amputation, but they are then suddenly doing complete autopsies.  The doctor is then an expert in animal biology and genetics.  The doctor discusses these octopus animal cells growing in the bodies and give them antibiotics.  The same doctor later gives one of his patients who have shown psychotic sympoms a bottle of Xanax and a bottle of sleeping pills.

Somebody mentioned the bear traps that were placed in the 30's.  When the one researcher stepped in it it was brand new.

I was hoping the film would take more of a direction the the actual archological finds, because this I found interesting, but then it veered towards the parasites and finally some mythological entity.  It is suggested that the infected are communicating with each other telepathically and the mythologic deer is just a hallucination, but it's then suggested that this entity is real.

Besides, even though in rave rating we always run the risk of disappointing the takers, the film, in my book anyway, meets the criteria for top-shelf in its genre.

Having said that: Creature FX-award winning- and Stephen King type fundamentalist-horror fans will be disappointed: The ""Creature"" is an illusion produced by a malignant bacterium activated by exposure to the arctic air by a group of entrepreneurial adventurers. (That's one point of originality - or quasi-originality, that being all that's left to us in this been-there/done-that-everywhere age: bacterium as opposed to the standard virus-villain.) That is the very thing makes this ""creature"" so effective - the producers' energy going into presentation rather than form: its sudden appearance, in the arctic night, under the half-light of (failing) motion-detectors and floodlights - the low, rasping but nonetheless clear, reedlike disembodied voice coming out of the sufferers' heads, goading them into mutilation and murder.

Lastly, women will not be interested: This is an estrogen-free zone in the tradition of John Carpenter's - 1980s - movie ""The Thing"", and that's a good thing - for me and, I believe, for most male fans of the genre. It's too bad but, especially in Horror, too many otherwise good movies go into a nosedive when the opposite sex is introduced. One example would be ""Bad Chemistry"", an above-average Viral-Villain flick that is truly scary and well-scripted - save for the two interludes where men interrupt; in the first instance acting like some feminist cartoon, monkeys-in-heat hypercliche of the Oversexed Sex; the other providing, of course, the white-rich-sociopathic-male Cause of It All, the virus behind the virus.

I do urge men and boys to check out this too-maligned sleeper. It's an increasing-rare instance of subtle art applied to the genre.",1497398400,,2025,5.148936170212766

This movie is directionless, poorly edited, and absolutely unwatchable.

There were FAR too many people in this movie. MAYBE with a core group of 3-4 characters, better writing/editing, and no stupid deer costume/Dr. Claw voice it might have been interesting.

But it's not.

Not even close.

Finally, can we stop filling 90% of the run time of these movies with shots of characters smoking?

This is a slow, SLOW burn. It's like Carpenter's THE THING with several of the action, pulse pounding scenes removed from the first and second acts. Folks sit and talk and you soak in their conversations as the wonderfully shot film spins along crafting it's story. There were a few moments where I wished they went to the ""show, don't tell"" mode of film making - it might have helped the pacing a bit. Actually seeing some of the things that are talked about after they happen when the characters regroup here and there might have boosted the energy of the film a bi

Based on what I've seen from horror fans, this will make many people crazy. They'll bark at their screens yelping, ""THERE'S NOTHING HAAAAAAPPENING!!!!"" and will start tearing at their skin like wild animals.

To them I say, ""Do us all a favor and don't watch this film. I can't take hearing your commentary on it, honestly. Go watch SAW XXI and be happy.""  There IS stuff happening, you just need to listen and work it out without seeing jump scares, things popping out at you, and blood spraying 20 feet in the air.

The only other caveat I have about the film is that things are NOT spelled out for you. If you want that, you won't find it here. There are expanses as wide open as the films bleak and beautiful landscape - again, superbly shot  - in the film. If that makes you crazy, skip it.

And, that's the end of the negatives. Let's move on to why I really loved this film.

This is a very THE THING like tale. But, more along the lines of the original book WHO GOES THERE? by John W. Campbell, Jr.. It's a character and story based movie that has moments of shock and horror, not the other way around.

Archaeologists uncover a massive underground structure in Northern, ""REALLY OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE"" Canada that dates back ten thousand years. The team brings in an expert to bless the find and get them much needed funds to continue their research.  As the find is verified and debated, things start to slowly and steadily break down.

This is another film where it feels like you are reading a book. (In a good way) You're allowed to really sink into the story and character development washes over you as the tale unfolds. There were several moments where I ended up saying things like, ""Well...this is bad,"" out loud to my wife who was next to me on her phone. THAT is another check in the PLUS column for this film.

My wife is NOT a horror fan. She can stand them at times, but more often than not, she stands up and says, ""Enjoy your movie - I'm off to bed,"" and is gone by ten minutes in. However, BLACK MOUNTAIN SIDE had her completely invested by the midway point. She was positing theories and wondering what was happening right along with me. Wen the movie ended, we had a very interesting series of conversations about the plot, scenes, and what we thought happened at the films climax. All around the midnight out, two hours after her usual bedtime. She really enjoyed the movie which is saying A LOT.

Nick Szostakiwskyj nails both the Direction and script. The film looks fantastic and the script is riveting, really. It's one of those film stories that doesn't lay it all out for you, but that you find yourself thinking about long after the film is over. Theories spun through my mind all last night and this morning about the movie.

The cast was fantastic as well. In some of these smaller budget films, the cast stumbles through dialogue as they make an effort to play out an emotional range they are not capable of hitting while choking out lines of memorized dialogue. However, these folks do it effortlessly. They are not only believable as who they are playing, but they manage to deliver some very intricate dialogue to the point where I found myself wondering if they found actual archaeologists that happened to do acting as well. :::grin:::

If you're a fan of remote chillers, story, and tales of madness and the supernatural, you really owe it to yourself to fire up BLACK MOUNTAIN SIDE, settle in with a whiskey or cup of tea, and let this grand tale wash over you like a warm blanket of creepy! :)  I plan to revisit this film again in the winder months...when it's cold...and dark...",1466899200,4,4357,4.475409836065574

7538803,5,B0182W7JE2,"A disclaimer: I watched this film because I recently and unexpectedly connected with the director, Nick Szostakiwskyj, on Twitter. Had I not done so, though, I still would have wanted to write a very enthusiastic review after watching it. Horror films have had a bad time as of late, since there seem to be so few really compelling options. Theres the intelligent, arty kind of horror film (Danny Boyle, Guillermo del Toro), so self-conscious that it makes me queasy. Or theres the torture-porn school (the Saw films, Takashi Miike, the Human Centipede trilogy, Rob Zombie) thats now so predictable the only thing to wait for is how gruesome the new special effects will be. Oh yes, and I forgot the found footage stuff, which occasionally can deliver some scares but more often seems contrived, badly scripted, and amateurishly paced (not to mention acted). I won't bother describing the horror films whose scripts seem hell bent on serving up copious amounts of lame humor and uninteresting sex scenes so as to appeal to the lowest common denominator audience.

In Black Mountain Side, we meet some very interesting characters who are engaged in archeological research in the extreme Canadian north. They discover a structure long buried and various artifacts that are difficult to explain. And then things start going wrong: their communications are cut off, their supplies run lowthe men cant sleep, they hear voices, and they become increasingly distraught. Yes: theyve awakened something.

As others note, the premise is similar to John Carpenters The Thing (a film that certainly had no problem reveling in grossness, occasionally to its detriment)but what they don't seem to register is a distinct echo of H. P. Lovecraft: the enemy is ancient and shrouded in myth, but theres also a possible scientific explanation for whats going on that responds to Lovecrafts certainty that mans place in the cosmos was small and relatively insignificant. As anyone whos read Lovecraft can tell you, his fiction does not lend itself very well to filmic treatments, mostly because its usually told from the standpoint of a first-person narrator. But Szostakiwskyjs brilliant script is probably the best evocation of Lovecraft Ive ever seen. It is elevated but never pretentious: he gives us almost all the information but never enough to answer the question definitively (another hallmark of Lovecrafts work); at the same time, he never litters the script with false leads that have no payoffs. Graphic scenes are absolutely essential for the plot and never gratuitous. (The great animal lover in me is particularly grateful for that.)

The ensemble cast is brilliantI particularly enjoyed Carl Toftfelt as the quietly driven and rather aristocratic Francis Mnro. The film moves slowly, but purposefully and inexorably, to its horrific climax; these days I can seldom watch a film in one sitting, but this one riveted me from one moment to the next as the situation for the men becomes increasingly hopeless and terrifying. Theres no dramatic score, which is a wonderful choice. Cameron Tremblays cinematography is breathtaking and unerringly composed. In short, hereat lastis a horror film worthy of the name: one that is never cheap, one that never shocks simply to shock, one that depends on characters grappling with extraordinary situations with all the complexity that makes human nature so fascinating.

A group of isolated scientists come upon something that has an effect on them that blurs the line between reality and madness, and normal behavior and extremely antisocial behavior. I think the whole production is solid, and what many viewers seem to have missed is the dark humor in this story. The Native American myth of The Wendigo is incorporated in a subtle, cool way. The film does a good job at showing psychological and mysterious horror with the horror of human violence and folly. I would not let people's negative reviews sway you; check it out for yourself.

7538816,2,B0182W7JE2,"I wanted to like this movie. I sat through every second of it, waiting for it to wow me. But that never happened. Now, I don't like to knock other people's creativity. Everyone is inspired and creates in different ways. But the only thing I can figure is that the writer finds something about deer unsettling.

The premise sounded good. But there is WAY too much telling and not half enough showing in this movie. The dialogue seems quite a bit unrealistic. Call me crazy, but if 5 people wrestle a guy to the top of a table and hack is arm off with an ax because it looks like there is a sea monster trying to break free from the skin, don't you think that just ONE of those people might 1. freak out about the monster arm? 2. ask ""what the bleep was that?!"" 3. do anything other than put the guy to bed and go on with life?

So, the idea is that an ancient germ/virus was dormant in this ruin and kept at bay by the cold and ice. Stupid humans doing what they do best, uncover the site and let the gem/virus escape.

BUT the pottery they found depicts a deer-god type creature, which you never actually see depicted in aforementioned pottery and must simply take the actors word for it. So, when various members of the party begin to hear and see this deer-god (a bipedal buck with the voice of Mum Ra) you kind of have to assume that this isn't so much a germ/virus as it is an actual intelligent entity of some sort. Therefore i guess we can surmise that the germ/virus (identified as ""microscopic squids""...I swear I'm not kidding) has some sort of collective awareness OR Mum Ra the Ever Living Bipedal Buck needs the micro squids to make everyone hear/see him.

So...again...I tried to like this film, but when I gave up almost two hours only to watch the last idiot step squarely in the huge honking bear trap he was warned were all over the place and then the scream fade to black, I kind of felt cheated. And annoyed.

You do not get any answers in this movie. You don't even get information. It's a decent into collective madness at the behest of Mum Ra the Bipedal Deer God.

On a positive note, the film quality was nice. It looked good. Acting was also nice. The actors did well with what they had. The dialogue felt stiff, though. There was huge, akward gaps in the dialogue, mostly poor and unrealistic responses to the situations...like nobody talking about the sea monster arm.

7538824,3,B0182W7JE2,"I enjoyed this movie, but I don't think I would have if I'd watched it alone and sober instead of with a friend and intoxicated.
This movie has some good ideas and decent acting, but its pacing is painfully slow, and some of the key FX are hard to take seriously. It feels like a cool short-film that got inflated into a full-length movie because otherwise it wouldn't sell. Ironically, after dragging on for over an hour, it abruptly ends without much satisfaction or closure.
I really wanted to like it, but I suspect I would have found it intolerably slow if I'd not been under the influence. The film has a bad habit of making something dreadful happen, then inter-cutting it with conversations or other other low-energy scenes. I think they were trying to provide contrast, but it meant the story was a really slow boil and the atmosphere kind of suffered.
Another problem was that the movie clearly didn't have a big budget and so had to do a lot of telling - we get many scenes where people talk about stuff instead of just showing it to us, and the structure is neither very large nor very impressive. To the makers' credit, what little budget there is is used well - there's only one time I can think of where an effect looked obviously fake. Unfortunately, this is a key special effect, so it makes the horror a little hard to take seriously.
Now, I also want to say that it felt unfocused, but that could have been the result of watching under the influence. You miss things in that state and that can add up. Having said that, I feel like there were at least two bad things going on that were only loosely connected, possibly three. The movie couldn't seem to decide if it wanted to be a monster film, a psychodrama, or a plague/zombie film, and the mashup did not work out. The two or three different plots sort of petered out, and like I said, the ending comes out of nowhere and leaves nothing really resolved.

This movie sounded like it was going to be so cool, and I really wanted to like it, because the world needs more subtle eldritch horror, but I can't recommend it. It was really funny and amusing to two stoned friends, but that's hardly a glowing recommendation.",1455494400,18,2188,4.47

A short while afterwards, it starts ""speaking"" to each man one at a time causing them to go mad.  Then there's the infection that forces amputations.  What is this thing that's crawling under their skin?  You'll never find out here. Now, you can find a really good X-Files episode that has a similar plot but is more interesting and has a great story.  And you'll only spend about 48 minutes vs. over 90 here.  Nothing is explained in this movie and the ending is just ridiculous. Hell, the whole movie is ridiculous.  If I want to see art, I'll go to the Guggenheim.  I expect a movie to tell a story with a coherent beginning, middle, and end.  This doesn't do it.  And when I said a ridiculous ending?

one small gripe: I could have done without the shoutout to cephalopods, inspired by  the 2015 notion that octopus have alien DNA in them, oddly back in the news again right now: ""Specifically, the (not really respected) researchers propose the idea that alien viruses crashed to Earth in a meteor, infected a population of primitive squid and caused them to evolve into octopuses."" This movie somehow saw that theory coming. Props for that. But the ""alien virus"" element works better for me without dragging cephalopods into it.",1526774400,,989,4.945783132530121
8741184,4,B0182W7JE2,"I really like this movie. It has a bleak, mind screwing Lovecraftian style horror story plot.
It is a slow build, which many people may not like, but I think if they made it any shorter they would lose more character development. And in my opinion it actually could have had more character development. Instead of so many scenes of them playing cards, trudging through the snow, or lopping limbs off, they could have had more interpersonal scenes with the characters talking or interacting in a way that would have revealed more about their life back home and some personal history of why they were working at this particular archaeological site - especially with the three main lead characters: Olsen, Jensen, and Manro.

Some reviewers thought this was not actually a horror movie. I don't understand that outlook considering there can be a whole lot more to horror stories than jump scares and being chased by monsters. This movie did the psychological horror very well and in my opinion could have told the story better (and cheaper) with less gore like limb chopping and bullets to the head, and just focused more on the ""things crawling under the skin"" style body horror which I think is so much more effectively horrifying.

The setting was excellent. The archaeological camp with a few cabins in the isolated arctic wilderness was great for this story.
Some reviewers thought it looked more like it was filmed in and around a cabin in Vermont rather than the ice covered Arctic wilderness. Apparently they were expecting something more akin to Antarctica with snow and ice covering everything and not a tree in sight. They do not seem to realize that the Northern Taiga Cordillera in Arctic Canada is quite literally just north of the Arctic Circle in Yukon province around 67 - 68 degrees latitude. It is still plenty south enough that trees can grow giving it a feel like it could have taken place in the Vermont mountains or even the Canadian Rocky Mountains (which is where it actually was filmed in British Columbia).
The movie script definitely over exaggerated the average low temperatures as being as low as -50. Clearly if it was -50 the characters would have to be dressed much warmer than what they were. In reality the Northern Taiga area in November averages about -15 degrees F for a low and -2 for an average high. No matter if it was -50 or -15 a clear goof in the film is shown when the icicles on the cabin are dripping due to it being unseasonably warm where it was filmed in BC.

A few issues and slightly spoilery plot holes I have with the movie mostly stem from the role of the doctor. I understand the writer felt the need to want to explain some of the technical stuff but considering they kept saying how ill prepared they were medically it was interesting that the doctor managed to perform an autopsy (was he a medical examiner?) and run DNA analysis that determined the two victims genes were mutating into cephalopod DNA. I think if they had made his character a biologist instead of a doctor that would have better explained the DNA screening, lack of medical supplies, and performing an autopsy. Probably would have been a better fit for the story to just have a biologist and maybe his character or another with some EMT training instead of having a doctor at all.  Also, as cool as the genes mutating into cephalopods DNA is, that felt out of place considering the creature/hallucination Deer God manifested as a deer standing upright on hind legs. The cephalopod DNA would have been more at home if the setting was a coastal Arctic location instead of a landlocked mountain and the creature manifested as a Squid or Octopus God.

Speaking of the creature/hallucination. The upright Deer God manifestation was actually pretty cool. It was fairly creepy and the deep bass voice was actually goosebump inducing for me. So, I think that was a big win for the movie.
I think it would have been even better if the movie had kept the Deer God slightly more cloaked in the shadows the few times it was shown. Although it still was plenty creepy (especially with the voice work) even if it looked a bit like a stuffed deer puppet during the couple times it was shown in more light.

Overall the acting and dialogue was nothing spectacular, but decent. I think the standout actor was Carl Toftfelt as Francis Manro. His facial expressions and eyes throughout his building psychosis and when seeing the Deer God creature/hallucination were the most effective of any of the actors.

Overall I give it 4 stars. The story and concept (minus the few plot holes and inconsistencies) really drew me in. I was engrossed throughout the movie. It definitely could have been executed better - especially if it had more interpersonal dialogue and back story development between the characters instead of just the lengthy card playing and limb chopping scenes.

The director really enhances the feelings of the isolation of the researchers with some very keep choices in the telling of this film. As I recall there is only one moment where music is used at all and only then to heighten the tension of the situation. Its almost halfway through the movie before he uses anything like a closeup shot. All the other shots are mediums or longs which serve to in some respects set us in the movie but also to isolate the viewer from the characters. Without closeups we are denied the opportunity to really connect with the researchers in a findamental way. It adds to the paranoia of the piece especially as they begin to be driven mad by the artifacts they have uncovered at the site.
