7880465,5,6304958560,"With all the musical documentaries shown on TV and available on viedocassette you might think that this offer is an historical overview of a Classic ""Side Man"" [alto sax genius Maceo Parker] to a Classic Super Star [James Brown]. But the only on-stage footage is from '94. The fan/historian might expect a few older clips of one of the greatest ""one-two punch"" in Soul - indeed, probably the most exciting bit in show business in the mid-to late '60s was the ""Call and Response"" in-the-funky-groove segment of the James Brown Show, when he would call Maceo so as to share the spotlight in a furious concert finale on ""Mother Popcorn"". Yes, there was a time when JB layed deep in the musical gutbucket and didn't seem to rely so heavily on backup singers and chorus girls. He's still got a great show but back in '69...devastation! And Mr. Parker was a prime contributor to the inspired delirium.
Well, you won't miss nuthin' here. Pee Wee Ellis (tenor sax), Fred Wesley (trombone) and George Clinton (vocals) and several strong newcomers are here to deliver on ""Gimme Some More"", ""House Party"", ""Cold Sweat"" (with its' ""Ride Your Pony"" reminiscence from '68), and the audience digs in. No, it's not the Apollo, but the New York-Louisiana attendees show their enthusiastic appreciation and it's beautifully captured. (Unlike most concert tapes which mostly ignore the fans).
Bassist Jerome Preston brings back the ""feel"" of an old Apollo Show with a powerful vocal of ""Let's Get It On"".
I don't know if this film was originally issued for theatres or received any recognition, but it's Oscar quality all the way through. Guaranteed essential viewing (and re-viewing).
[Fans check out the c. '69 live video performance of ""Mother Popcorn"" with JB and MP on ""Music Scene, Vol. Six"" (MPI Home Video) and a great New Orleans festival performance by Maceo & Roots Revisted"" on ""Let The Good Times Roll"" (Polygram Video)].",1015891200,7,1915,4.91358024691358

This video should be seen by everyone who loves music and ESPECIALLY by every black kid living in this or that project (or anywhere else) who has hopes of a  better life someday.  Maceo Parker is not only a great musician, but a  great guy and excellent role model.  It just drips off him in this film.  Inner City school educators take note:  SHOW THIS FILM TO YOUR  STUDENTS!
If there's one disheartening thing it's that it took the  Germans to bring this man to light in an era when his should be a household  name right here!",949968000,,586,4.452830188679245
7880468,5,6304958560,"Maceo Parker,Fred Wesley,Pee Wee Ellis are awesome. The tone quality,attack,and musicianship are automatic. Fred Wesley is one with his horn,(I even named one of my sons (Wesley) after him..now you gotta be bad  for that. Maceo's influence in music(James Brown, Parliament/Funkadelic)  will be felt for years to come. With Pee Wee Ellis(a household name  too,when you're talking about James Brown),The show is outta sight and  finally gives us a look at the core and roots of rhythm and blues.",930096000,2,493,5.2025316455696204
