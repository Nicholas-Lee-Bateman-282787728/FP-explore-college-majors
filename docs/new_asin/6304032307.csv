7859364,4,6304032307,"Burt Reynolds lives with his crazy, creepy family in the middle of nowhere. Burt kidnaps Mia Sara (and her daughter) and basically forces them to join the household. Meanwhile, Mia's husband frantically searches for his missing wife and daughter... and Detective Wannabe Wayne Knight thinks the husband is responsible for the disappearances. It's a kooky, weirdo drama that's entertaining in a bad Lifetime movie sorta way.",1507852800,,423,5.424242424242424

7859369,3,6304032307,"The Maddening is a psychological thriller starring Burt Reynolds and Angie Dickinson. The story starts out with a mom who decides to ""runaway"" with her young daughter after getting into a disagreement with her husband.

The classic red convertible looks nice, but of course it has engine problems right around where Roy Scudder's(BURT) gas station is located. So this is the spark that leads to the insanity that Burt, Angie, and family dish out to the poor, helpless mom and her young daughter.

The story, of course, lacks depth; but at least you get some ""single-layered"" fun from Burt and Angie's deranged characters. Lightweight, no-depth, quick-frills; don't expect much more from this movie.",1230854400,,698,5.168141592920354
7859370,5,6304032307,"Mia Sara's car breaks down on a lonely, isolated road. Friendly mechanic Burt Reynolds takes her and her young daughtet back to his home where things turn creepy.
Reynolds' wife Angie dickinson is nuts and locks them up in a boarded up bedroom. It soon becomes apparent that Reynolds is just as crazy and will do anything and kill anyone that comes between his wife and her happiness.
Well acted all round with Reynolds in particular giving a great menacing performance.
Loosely based on the Andrew Nierderman novel ""Play Mates"".
Filmed in 1994 but only released on video in 1996, it is well worth tracking down.",1074384000,,612,4.783018867924528
7859371,3,6304032307,"The Maddening is an interesting and violent thriller, based on Andrew Neidderman's  novel (the same author of ""The Devil's Advocate""), about Cassie (Mia Sara, in a good interpretation, she really passes all the  fragility of her character), a woman who runs away with her daughter, and  ends up being the victim of a crazed and dangerous man (Burt reynolds,  terrific and scary as a psycopath).This film has some really tense moments  , like the ending, or the part in which Reynolds' character rapes Cassie,  and the basic idea is entertaining and touching, but the film suffers a lot  by the poor production (this is clearly a B-movie) and the horrible  direction by Danny Huston. Although very predicable, The Maddening turns  out to be a good, but forgetable, thriller.",940464000,3,773,4.9765625
