3922012,4,B002FLZKCA,"One can expect sexually perversion at an all time high on this Comedy Central DVD.  ""Sex"".  Mitch Fatel's comedy revolves 100% around it and he never strays.

Known for his comedic delivery (ie. he sounds like he's mentally challenged), Mitch Fatel is a comedian who loves women, loves breasts and loves sex.  In fact, he'll let you know several times about his love for women and their bodyparts and getting laid.

His comedy is literally uncensored and he spares no one from the audience as he will talk about his love for breasts, big and small.  His love for the vagina, sexual positions, sexual garments, using his popularity to get women, and literally sex this and sex that.  It's literally a sex-driven comedy act and again, for Fatel it has worked successfully for him.  His popularity has led to two comedy albums ""Miniskirts & Muffins"" and ""Super Retardo"" and now, here we are with his comedy special on DVD extended and uncut!

Fatel shows no worries or hesitation about the things he will discuss.  From bestiality, what he finds on the Internet to having sex with a woman having her period.  Fatel is literally not afraid to discuss sexual taboos and not afraid to use himself as the guinea pig for his jokes and the crowd loves it.

The track list for ""Mitch Fatel is Magical"" goes into several topics.  Here is the DVD track listings:

  1. The Pre-Sex Warning
  2. Girls Like Me Now
  3. Sex with Horses
  4. Super Famous
  5. Candycane
  6. The Panty-Pull-Aside Move

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Mitch Fatel is Magical"" is presented in Widescreen.  Camera shots are either typically up front and some focusing on the audience in the front row (who will occasionally be used in Fatel's comedy routine).  Another camera behind the audience but overall, several camera angles and good editing make the comedy fluid and smooth.  No special effects or crazy use of editing during the whole hour.

As for audio, audio is presented in English Stereo and English 5.1 Surround.  For the most part, dialogue is easy to understand and is front and center channel driven.  I preferred to watch the the DVD with my receiver set to stereo on all channels for a better, more immersive sound with the audience.

JUDGMENT CALL:

This is probably the raunchiest Comedy Central DVD that I have seen so far.  But for the most part, I found it hilarious and entertaining.

Rarely do you find comedians who focus on sex only for their comedy act but Mitch Fatel has made it a career and it has worked.  Most of the time, when a comedian gets into discussion about sex, the audience starts feeling a bit timid (especially for those that bring their kids to an adult comedy show) but in this case, this is strictly adult humor at its finest.

Mitch Fatel has no problems discussing his love for women and sex that nothing is left out.  He'll get comedy about everything...the breasts, the vagina, the butt...you name it, his comedy routine has included it.

Needless to say, it all comes down to whether or not you're into this style of comedy.  In a way, I was skeptical before because typically other comedians who have tried to do a comedy routine with more than 15-minutes based on sex, it just seems as if it didn't fit into their routine or that the audience was not feeling it.  But the thing is, with Mitch Fatel...knowing that his comedy is 100% sex-driven, you know what you're going to get and just watch and have a good time.

Overall, ""Mitch Fatel is Magical"" is absolutely perverted...and satisfaction is guaranteed!",1255392000,8,4445,4.670116429495472
3922013,5,B002FLZKCA,Mitch Fatel is hands-down one of THE BEST comics out there. This DVD finally brings Mitch to the mainstream audience that has only been able to hear him on CD and see him on Comedy Central. I have been fortunate enough to see him in person and this DVD does that justice. You WANT this on your wall...you NEED this on your wall!(that was my Jack impression),1255305600,2,357,4.343283582089552
3922014,3,B002FLZKCA,"This show was pretty good, but not nearly as good as SuperRetardo.  His earlier work was much better. Some of the jokes here are a bit too easy and played out.  A few good laughs here and there, but it kinda drags on at times.",1254787200,,226,4.0
3922015,5,B002FLZKCA,Mitch does it again. He delivers a funny set that combines lots of new material with some of the highlights from his previous albums that haven't been seen on tv. A must have for all Mitch Fatel fans. Even Mitch's cat makes a special appearance.,1254096000,,245,4.466666666666667
3922046,5,B002FLZKCA,We love Mitch...he is so funny and we are looking forward to his next show.  This was the first time we got to watch him and it was soooo much better than the CD.  Just getting to see the different facial expressions....priceless.,1392595200,,230,4.4523809523809526

3922049,5,B002FLZKCA,Great dvd; don't watch with kids!  It's all adult here; with a sense of juvenile approach....  Mitch approachs sex like a retard!,1366588800,,129,4.818181818181818
3922050,2,B002FLZKCA,"it's okay. Definitely not as funny as some of his other stand up, but just okay. I would buy it if you're a die hard Mitch Fatel fan.",1364342400,,133,3.7857142857142856
3922051,2,B002FLZKCA,I was not offended by Mitch's humor. I was more offended in that I listened on Youtube and Pandora to him and thought by purchasing the dvd I would be getting some new material. Mitch's deliver makes his humor work. I was bored by the fact that he has the same jokes in all of his materias. Save money and just youtube him.,1355356800,,323,4.142857142857143

3922053,3,B002FLZKCA,"To me, and many other of course, Mitch Fatel is one of the greatest comedians presently on stage.  It's hard to believe the guy is beyond the 40 age mark already.  I've heard all of his stand-ups and I have to say that after purchasing this dvd, I was a little bit disappointed.  I have to say that 40-50% of his material he uses in ""the Magical"" is directly taken from ""Miniskirts and Muffins"" and ""Super Retardo"".  He does add a few twists here and there but it gets old really fast.  So for anyone who never heard of Mitch Fatel and wants a piss-your-pants laugh-out-loud experience, then this dvd is for you!  Otherwise I'd stay away from this one.  To note, his on stage presence or acting if you will, in this dvd is absolutely dreadful.",1289952000,,743,4.37956204379562
3922054,5,B002FLZKCA,"I've always loved Mitch and finding this video in stores wasn't really easy. The DVD was new and very well priced, came within 2 weeks and really was brand spankin' new. DVD is hilarious by the way, so many good one-liners!",1282262400,2,223,4.463414634146342

8369139,4,B002FLZKCA,"Funny but very crude.  I am a Mitch Fatel  (fay tel) fan and have been for some time, but you must know that his comedy is NOT FAMILY FRIENDLY.  Not that he claims to be, just warning you in case you want to catch some of his act with the kids around.
Most of his comedy revolves around a sex obsession, and all he (and almost all men) thinks about.  I can relate to a ton of this which is why I find it funny.",1464048000,,410,3.788235294117647
