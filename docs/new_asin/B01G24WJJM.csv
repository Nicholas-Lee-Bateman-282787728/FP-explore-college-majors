7753471,1,B01G24WJJM,"Amazon must be the graveyard of bad movies.  They should be ashamed of having anyone pay for this total piece of crap.  First, this is a comedy, not a horror film as you'd think on the cover.  And it's not funny.  I could only make myself watch 10 minutes of this dreck before going to Netflix and finding a good Danish flick to watch.  Amazon needs to refund everyone who bought this flick under false advertising.  I can't even give you a decent synopsis as there isn't a plot!  This flim had to be made by drunken middle school students.  From the fake doctor in the initial narration who implores you (a la The Thing from Another World) to watch the stars, to two hillbillies in the woods who find a NASA space capsule, and the horrid dialog, you'll want to go to Judge Judy to force Amazon to not only refund your money, but to pay you for wasted time.  There is nothing redeeming about this movie, so avoid it at all costs.",1485043200,,929,4.293103448275862
7753472,4,B01G24WJJM,"Funny satire of 50's - 70's sci-fi drive-in shlock.  Highly recommended for those who have strong stomachs and a sense of humor.  Stand out scenes - Forest BJ, Martian cave and backwoods bar.",1484956800,2,191,4.757575757575758

7753476,1,B01G24WJJM,"Really low budget. Redstone type rocket to Mars? Get real. Electronic equipment footage from the 70's. Obvious model 'mars rover' bouncing around like a toy. Atrocious dialog. Watched about 15 minutes and gave up, couldn't take anymore.",1483228800,,236,5.405405405405405

7753478,4,B01G24WJJM,"""Every actor executes the swallowing of pride process to extend verbal and physical indirect comedy that purely goes hand-in-hand with this sort of satirical storyline constructed from the certifiable portions of Mike Lyddons brain that might or might not be sizzling on an illegal and dangerous narcotic.""",1478563200,2,306,5.531914893617022
7753479,4,B01G24WJJM,"Not typically my kind of movie, but this one is well worth the watch for lovers of horror comedies and drive-in movies of the 1960's & 70's.  However, if you have no appreciation or understanding of satire or films of that era, you will probably not get it.  Be warned:  it is gory and occasionally downright sick, but its all done so tongue-in-cheek you can't help but laugh at the redneck evisceration or the flute in the eye scene.  I think my soul is damned.",1477612800,,462,4.4
7753480,1,B01G24WJJM,"Wish I could give it 1/2 a star.  A horror comedy, more like a horrible comedy.  I just can not believe I watched to whole thing.  I kept thinking there will be a good part soon, it never happened.  Just another bad B movie make that very bad B movie..",1499644800,,252,3.98

7753483,2,B01G24WJJM,they tried I think. But this was just bad. I hate to say it but it was a waste of time. Sorry I spent money on it. Gave it two stars because it wasn't found footage which is the only way it could have been worse.,1489104000,,212,3.630434782608696

7753486,4,B01G24WJJM,I saw a screener of this last year and it was a riot!  My friends and I did our own little MST3K during the film and we had to watch The Killer Shrews after just to keep the laugh train going.  First Man on Mars is a supreme send up of low low budget exploitation from the 60's through 80's and I suggest a six pack and a bud per person.,1486598400,,337,3.732394366197183

 it was free with Amazon Prime and I still feel ripped off. Obviously low budget, but still, why did they waste any money/time making this movie?? Use the $20 on a pizza for the crew and call it a day.",1500508800,,313,4.048387096774194
