8216033,5,B000V03LR8,"This is one of my favorite korean drama series, next to My Lovely Sam soon and Man of the Vineyard.  If you enjoy romantic comedies,  you'll like this one.  You'll cry a bit, but laugh a lot. the actors/actresses are perfect for the characters they play.  the English subtitle is good.  I highly recommend this light-hearted entertaining series.",1230681600,3,345,4.879310344827586
