8146291,2,B000ILZ8B2,"My rating is for the DVD release I bought, not of the film itself. Amazon compiles all reviews for multiple versions of an item regardless of which specific product you're looking at. This can cause confusion as to what exactly you end up paying for. Just to be clear: despite the claims of other reviews shown on the product page for the region 2 French edition of Gandahar, it does not work on region 1 players, nor does it feature English subtitles. There is however, a region 2 UK release currently for sale on Amazon that does have English subtitles (though claims of a PAL disc working on NTSC players still sounds fishy to to me). In any case, the UK version has basically the same cover as the French release, but can be easily identified by the addition of a red banner at the top showing ""Eureka!"" and ""The Masters of Cinema Series"" logos in white. The film itself is amazing, and both editions look/ sound absolutely fantastic! But if you want to know what characters are actually saying, get the UK release. It's also highly recommended to purchase a cheap region-free DVD player just to be sure your import discs will play fine.",1456790400,9,1141,4.570731707317073

8146295,5,B000ILZ8B2,"Good movie overpriced.  I have the VHS and hoped to get this on DVD, but although I enjoy I can't see paying more than ten to fifteen dollars for it.

8146296,3,B000ILZ8B2,"I have waited for this release in the USA for years.  I remember it as a kid on VHS.  Now, I am in my 40s and I look for stuff like this.  Found it but it is not in English.  It is Region 2.  I can play it on my Computer which is not the problem.  I am not a big fan of subtitles at all and this has them.  I do not want to have to read my movie. On a side note,  The Orb took a creature from this movie  and made a song from it called ""A Huge Ever Growing Pulsating Brain That Rules From The Centre Of The Ultraworld"" along with a little help from The KLF. I am glad to have it, just wish that it was in English!",1388966400,7,613,3.514925373134328
8146297,3,B000ILZ8B2,"if you loved FANTASTIC PLANET so much you wanted to eat up anything else by laloux, you may be a bit disappointed in this movie.  the animation style is more like HE MAN, than FANTASTIC PLANET.  the story and creativity are great though.  the short film included as an extra feature was better than the actual movie i thought.  one gripe;  the subtitles are WAY too intrusive for this particular type of film.  this particular release has a great booklet included as well and although its PAL, it played perfectly fine in my american dvd player.  im glad i bought it, still well worth the money",1260921600,12,594,4.547169811320755
