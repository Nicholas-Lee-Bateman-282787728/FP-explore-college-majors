8325235,1,B000IW87NC,"This dvd consists of two short programs, each of which lasts around ten minutes. The quality of the picture is horrible and it jumps around on the screen to the point that it makes you feel dizzy. It simply shows a fake family having a fake Thanksgiving dinner. You never hear any sound from the dinner - only a narrator reminding the viewer that it is important not to make noise when eating your soup. These are not original candid home movies. The second one is also centered around a family and is partially narrated with the actors speaking breifly. The acting is horrible, the lines are corny and the actors are stiff. The second feature suddenly cuts off mid sentence while the father is talking to the viewer. I was really disappointed with this cheap and awful piece of film, which arrived in a generic plastic dvd case with a generic dvd. Really bad, don't waste your time.",1289520000,5,883,4.559748427672956
