8170368,1,B000MNOX8K,"I love medieval movies of all shapes and sizes, so I tend to put anything even remotely set during the middle ages into my movie pile. Throw in swords and swordfights and usually I'm fairly happy. But I found myself, during the entire watching of The King Maker, asking myself either why in the world I was watching it or when it was going to end.

There were so many things wrong with this. The dialogue was laughably funny. It was as if they took a book of cliches and randomly draw phrases out of it. The acting was incredibly poor (although I admit being fond of John Rhys-Davies). The special effects often looked like they came from an 80s video game. Mix in samurai, ninjas, elephants, and every other style you can imagine battling it out in a river filled with pink paint, and it just got fairly silly.

I'm not sure what I could find to recommend this film to someone. Usually there's at least something I can point to. But the soundtrack was heavyhanded and bland. The costumes had issues. There just wasn't any area that was done well.

8170369,2,B000MNOX8K,"The costumes and setting are good to very good. The music is very good to superb. However, the acting is mostly poor to average with some going into above average to good. Even John Rhys-Davies knows it. The action choreography is dated and sometimes hilarious as you see people rising up with ""invisible lines"" on their backs.

I think there was a lot of love in this project at first but somewhere along the lines it all got lost at the expense of the characters and story/plotting.

OVERALL GRADE: C plus.",1387929600,,508,4.571428571428571
8170370,1,B000MNOX8K,"This is one of the most painful viewing experiences I've had recently (or even not so recently).  Did John Rhys Davies have a loanshark he needed to pay off?  What he's doing in this ridiculous piece of video flotsam is beyond me--but I imagine they waved a pretty big check under his nose. Much cash was expended on this thing, plenty of big sets, locations and sparkly costumes--but no real expenditure of either cash or more importantly thought or creativity on little things like story or direction.  The hero (Gary Stretch--now there's a likely nom de screen), who comes off as a weird mixture of Steven Seagal and Fabio, gives line readings that are reminiscent of the english dubbing in old Godzilla movies--except in this case the dialogue appears to actually be coming out of his mouth (ok a lot of it is probably adr). Yosavadee Hassdeevichit as the queen is particularly over the top (and really makes you wish her character would get killed off quickly) and one rather amazing sequence of dialogue from the actor playing the King of Siam is so laughable it makes you wonder if they didn't cut a lot of his performance.  Where's Yul Brynner when you need him (or more importantly Yimou Zhang)?  Watch only for the camp value.  Lowest rating - bomb - stinkbomb. Kaboom.",1197244800,3,1279,4.713004484304933
8170371,2,B000MNOX8K,"`The King Maker' released in '05 is a Thai film possessing a grandiose vision burdened with an immensely uneven and convoluted delivery. There's definitely a lot of noticeable shortcomings to this movie yet it still works fairly well as an exotic period piece on 16th century Siam.

Negatives:
- The film labors over one of the worst scripts ever written, it's stiff, unnatural and highly predictable.
- The inclusion of flying ninjas, battling samurai, Thai kickboxing and European sword fighting exudes a comic book effect and erodes whatever semblance of realism the movie is trying to maintain.
- The soundtrack is boring and quite forgettable. Most of it sounds like bad opera.
- Yoe Hassadeevichit in the role of the evil Queen Sudachan brings to the screen one of the most laughable, melodramatic, over-the-top performances I've ever witnessed. I'm not sure what was worse, the way she heartlessly ordered the death of countless innocent people to gain sole possession of the throne of Siam, or the manner in which she continuously butchered the English language.

Positives:
- The cinematography is at times alluring and Cindy Burbridge is not only lovely to behold but provides the most honest, heartfelt performance of the film.

If you're looking for a poor man's `The Curse of the Golden Flower' here it is. My rating: 2  Stars.",1176595200,8,1340,5.0225225225225225
8170372,3,B000MNOX8K,"THE KING MAKER will doubtless be a success in Thailand where the similar (but superior) 'The Legend of Suriyothai' set box office records.  The film directed by Lek Kitaparaporn after a screenplay by Sean Casey based on historical fact in 1547 Siam has some amazingly beautiful visual elements but is disarmed by one of the corniest, pedestrian scripts and story development on film.

The event the picture relates is the arrival of the Portuguese soldier of fortune Fernando de Gamma (Gary Stretch) whose vengeance for this father's murderer drives him to shipwrecked, captured and thrown into slavery and put on the bloc in Ayutthaya in the kingdom of Siam where he is purchased by the beautiful Maria (Cindy Burbridge) with the consent of her father Phillipe (John Rhys-Davies), a man with a name and a past that are revealed as the story progresses.  There is a plot to overthrown the King and Fernando and his new Siamese sidekick Tong (Dom Hetrakul), after some gratuitous CGI enhanced choreographed martial arts silliness, are first rewarded by the King to become his bodyguards, only to be imprisoned together once Queen Sudachan (Yoe Hassadeevichit) reveals her plot to kill the king and son to allow her lover Lord Chakkraphat (Oliver Pupart) to take over the rule of Siam. Yet of course Fernando and Tong escape and are condemned to fight each other to save the lives of their families (Tong's wife and children and Fernando's now firm love affair with Maria) with the expected consequences.

The acting (with the exception of John Rhys-Davies) is so weak that the film occasionally seems as though it were meant to be camp.  The predominantly Thai cast struggle with the poorly written dialog, making us wish they had used their native Thai with subtitles.  The musical score by Ian Livingstone sounds as though exhumed form old TV soap operas. But if it is visual splendor you're after there is plenty of that and that alone makes the movie worth watching. It is a film that has obvious high financial backing for all the special effects and masses of cast and sets and shows its good intentions. It is just the basics that are missing.
