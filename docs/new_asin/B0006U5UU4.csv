2196110,2,B0006U5UU4,"This ""comedy mystery"" is superficial, politically correct, and in general barely worth one's time.  Bates, with an incredible hairdo, is supposed to be a witty professor.  Mostly, he's an aging actor, smirking his way through some very weak lines.  Cusak, as a woman police officer, is okay, but the ""romance"" she's attempting to get into is unconvincing and terribly predictable.  The film company had to depend upon glorious British scenery to keep our interest, and even there it is deficient, for we see far less of the countryside than we should.  As for the mystery element, again, it's okay, if predictable.  Two stars tops.",1127520000,7,631,5.019230769230769

2196112,5,B0006U5UU4,"What can one say, but superlatives concerning the performances on Sinead Cusack and Alan Bates in his/their pursuit of Aristotle. His hilarious acceptance of his being made redundent,

the conversion of the wife of the  pompous ass of a petty academic dictator into an anogram/crossword fanatic is equally hilarious.

Then the tour begins along with the subterfuge of Big Business to thwart the will of our heroes. Bill Paterson is wonderfull as the ""bad guy"" who eventually saves the day for our characters.

The heart wrenching scenes concerning the Royal Oak sinking at the begining of World War Two are just one of many memorable scenes on their journey that takes them from the Rhonda Valley to the Orkney Islands on this travologue of some of themore beautiful parts og Great Britain. Also memorable is the musical score, reminiscent of the great Dave Brubeck of the late fifties.

2196113,4,B0006U5UU4,"This is a delightful BBC made-for-television romantic comedy/drama, based on the novel by Alan Plater. Alan Bates is wonderful as the eccentric Oliver who loves cryptic crosswords and sees anagrams everywhere. He also knows something very funny about sex. Sinead Cusack is gorgeous and intelligent as Police Constable Diane Priest. She tries her hand at crosswords, he tries detective work, and together they go in search of Aristotle. A strong supporting cast includes: Molly Sugden (Are You Being Served) as a B&B proprietor; and Charlotte Coleman (Four Weddings and A Funeral) as a computer hacker. It's fun, it's irreverent and you'll never look at the daily paper or headstones in quite the same way again. See it with someone you love. Highly recommended.",1123718400,9,761,5.195121951219512

2196116,4,B0006U5UU4,"OLIVER'S TRAVELS (Acorn) is a beguiling road trip romance across some of the most beautiful British landscapes and historical sites.

Alan Bates (""Women in Love,"" ""Gosford Park"") is Oliver, a word game, crossword puzzle fan and comparative religion professor who's forced into early retirement.  Sinead Cusack (""Stealing Beauty"") is a police officer suspended for voicing suspicions about a superior officer.  Together, through spontaneous circumstances and chance, they end up travelling together by car from Wales in the south to the northernmost Orkney Islands off Scotland in separate quests that merge into single murder investigation.

Strangely, it's not the plot that involved me.  In fact, I almost didn't care about the ""who dunnit"" as much as the colorful characters, the quirky, witty banter, the striking locations and the wonderful, mature romance between Bates and Cusack.

I can think of few films that allow us to so fully experience two characters slowly falling in love.

When Bates and Cusack say spontaneous vows at the isolated, arching ruins of 12th Century Lindisfarne Abbey with the fortress of Iona's Holy Island looming against the ocean horizon, I was swept up on  this journey and didn't care about the destination.",1106870400,47,1244,5.343589743589743

So, learn something very funny about sex (from Alan Bates), the answer to why we ate the frogs, and have the time of your life with this terrific British series.",1388620800,2,438,4.8133333333333335
2196119,5,B0006U5UU4,This has become one of my all time favorite movies. I wish there was more to this series Iwatch it over and over,1386374400,2,112,3.9130434782608696
2196120,4,B0006U5UU4,"In a general sense Oliver's Travels is a mystery, romance, travelogue, with social commentary, although that hardly covers everything it is.

Lord and everyone else knows the screen writer, Alan Plater, was not pleased. He wrote the part of Oliver as a vehicle for Tom Courtenay, but it somehow went to Alan Bates. Certainly there are things to complain about. Bates is pretty arch throughout and his makeup is appallingly distracting from first to last. Plater's plot is built around a love for word games and the script follows suit, occasionally being almost too witty and cryptic to follow, especially for an audience that is not English, but there IS something about the piece that is warm and right.

For starters both Sin&eacute;ad Cusack and Bill Paterson are spot on. Ms. Cusack manages to make her character, WPC Priest, display a reasonable skepticism even while she shows her growing affection for the childlike and distracted Oliver. Paterson's Mr. Baxter balances an affection for his quarries with mystery and menace right through, although the director's decision to briefly and abruptly turn Mr. Baxter into a bumbler who drops things and stumbles is quite odd coming as it does after 4 hours of competent menace.

The story of two middle aged cynics rediscovering a quiet and comfortable love after having giving up on the notion is attractive to middle aged romantics like me. There is much endearing and witty interplay between Oliver and Mrs. Priest and it is when they are quietly getting to know one an other or quoting from what will be to Americans very obscure writers, that we like them as a couple.

I mustn't forget the bit players who add enormously to the pleasure of the series. There are the self-described ""bimbo,"" the Scottish undertaker, the homeless man who might be making conversation about a Restoration playwright (and might not), Diane's father the ""monumental mason"", and the hotelier affectingly explaining that he lives at the edge of the Scapa Flow so he can pay homage to his father each night before he goes to bed, among others and all played by familiar British actors.

And finally there is the landscape of Scotland. Beautiful, old, and spare.",1386028800,3,2195,4.953804347826087
2196121,5,B0006U5UU4,"I have watched this mini-series over and over through recent years.  I love the witty dialogue and the crossword puzzle mystery.  I love the romance between Bates and Cusack.

2196126,2,B0006U5UU4,"We remember this series fondly-for its light touch of two persons who find themselves on a a journey to find themselves as they approach retirement.  They kindle a spark for the relationship which is both fun and touching.  However the video quality of the original production is poor-the pictures are of a quality that bespeak the VHS age (it was made in video equipment rather than film which shows it age)  that we have already forgotten in the age of HIDef.  That said it remains a interesting look at two people, both fine actors, with great lines, and the musical score of Old wally wally making it a landmark in our own lives.",1292716800,,633,4.575221238938053

Lighthearted mystery, appealing protagonists, lovely country, the same loving themes of jazz, just a very familiar feeling throughout--I was sure it was the product of the same writer, and indeed, it was written by Alan Plater. Great stuff!",1287446400,3,472,5.569444444444445
2196128,5,B0006U5UU4,"Though it's been twelve years since Oliver's Travels initially aired on PBS, it's one of those hard to categorize jewels never completely forgotten. It's shown up in conversations,  ""What was, you know, that PBS thing where the couple went around England looking for the crossword guy?""

This is it, and a joy it is!  Alan Bates is deightfully dotty as Oliver and Sinead Cusack (Mrs. Jeremy Irons) as WPC Diane Priest is utterly charming as the pair careen around the country in a yellow car, searching for clues to a murder.  Along the way, they visit Priest's stonemason father, geologist son and the depressing mining town being bulldozed that was Oliver's parents' home.  It's the opportunity for witty repartee, misty-eyed nostalgia, gorgeous scenery and some of the best bit parts in television history.

The mystery is secondary, and perhaps the clues are a bit too conveniently planted, but who cares?  There's not one weak episode, and indeed, the DVD set contains the first full two episodes which I don't believe PBS showed.  For a feel-good lighthearted few hours, this is just the ticket and a sure cure for midwinter blues.",1259625600,6,1137,4.947368421052632
2196129,5,B0006U5UU4,"When Oliver's Travels first aired on PBS I taped it and found myself watching it repeatedly. However, I noted that there were inconsistencies in the first episode, which I learned later was a truncated version of the first two episodes. The editing was so bad that some of the lines made no sense, because the context had been removed. The DVD version finally restored the series as it was originally aired in the UK.

Oliver's Travels is a masterpiece of writing, full of eccentric characters, loaded with social commentary and religious and literary allusions that alternate between serious and funny. British humor is often understated, but there are some laugh out loud moments as well. What especially struck me is how comfortable the actors seemed in their roles with one another. All in all a very entertaining story.",1243296000,10,824,4.971014492753623
2196130,4,B0006U5UU4,"""Oliver's Travels"" is a British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) television series, sort of a light British mystery/road picture/drama/ adventure/romantic comedy/thriller.  It was, interestingly enough, actually made by BBC Wales: an unusual provenance that, which possibly explains the plentiful, lovely Welsh scenery and the plentiful supporting actors, with yeasty little parts, and strong flavorful Welsh accents, not necessarily given cast credits that we see in the first episodes.  It might also explain, for all we know, the bounteous green highways and byways of Midlands-Northern English scenery, and Scottish scenery, that we see later on -- we even see Hadrian's Wall that separates England and Scotland, for goodness sake.  And all of the scenery populated by more outstanding supporting actors, enjoying their fully-written parts, and using their local accents to the fullest.

At any rate, the series, in five episodes, was initially broadcast on the BBC in 1995; it was broadcast on American Public Broadcasting System's Masterpiece Theatre in 1996, and reprised once.  Since then, apparently, viewers have been begging for it to be released on DVD.  It's now in a 2-volume boxed set, containing the five episodes, with a running time of approximately 245 minutes.  And secret subtitles - bless you, Acorn Media, for allowing us on this side of the pond to enjoy all those Welsh, Geordie, and Scottish accents to the fullest.  (The box doesn't advertise subtitles; but if you ask your TV for them, there they will be.)

She's suspended for some incautious sleuthing on a local murder mystery that comes too near top police brass, so they decide to throw in their lots together and travel cross-country to Scotland's Orkney Islands, in pursuit of ""Aristotle,"" and the miscreants in her mystery: the two quests seem to be growing tied together.  The witty script is by the award-winning Alan Plater (&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Beiderbecke-Affair/dp/B001HZ4K8A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Beiderbecke Affair</a>).

It's seldom enough we see a middle-aged romance, between actors who show wrinkles, though they are certainly attractive people; and it's welcome when we do.  (Though sorry, I must say, in one way this series does seem to belong to an earlier school of British filmmaking that reflected earlier British dentistry standards:  Bates' teeth are absolutely brown, and you'd never call Cusack's white.) Furthermore, this is a distinctly light, ""romantic"" mystery, and a road picture with lots and lots of whimsy, and witty banter: you'd best have a taste for that kind of thing to fully enjoy it.  There's non-stop chat in the car, and some of it can seem precious and pointless. Some American viewers may find the script overwritten, and feel that Bates tends to overact in it: a certain ""twee"" quality results.  Nevertheless, even an entertainment that tries too hard to be charming can be charming.",1241136000,4,4263,6.3477508650519034
2196131,5,B0006U5UU4,"When Oliver (Alan Bates), a popular college professor in Comparative Religion, and amateur crossword and anagram aficionado is ""made redundant"" and forced to take early retirement, he embarks on a roadtrip to the Orkney Islands, in a quest to locate the whereabouts of Aristotle. This is the pen name for his favorite crossword puzzle creator, who has mysteriously disappeared.

Along the way, Oliver convinces police constable Diane Priest (Sinead Cusack) to accompany him, and what ensues is a clever story, filled with witty and fast-paced banter, and peopled with a whole host of colorful characters. An especially excellent performance is turned in by Bill Paterson, who plays a sinister character who pursues them relentlessly along their journey.

A combination mystery, middle-age romance, comedy and travelogue, watching Oliver's Travel is a pleasant way to spend several hours. Originally aired as a PBS Mystery mini-series, this DVD set comes in 5 episodes, each approximately 50 minutes long.",1235520000,4,1004,5.470967741935484

Each party was themed to match the accompanying episode, with classic Jazz music, British food and great micro brewed English style ales.

Once upon a time there was a farmer who had a horse.  His neighbor admired the horse and offered him 10 pounds for it.  The farmer thought this was good value so he accepted the offer.  However, before they shook hands on the deal, he said to the neighbor:  ""I should warn you, this is a fine horse, but he has one serious weakness.  He likes to sit on eggs.""  The neighbor said yes, he would keep him away from eggs.  So the deal was struck.  The neighbor paid the money and took the horse away.

A week later the farmer heard loud cries coming from the river.  He went down to the river and there was his neighbor, on the horse, in the middle of the river.  ""He won't move,' said the neighbor, ""we've been here all morning.""  ""I'm very sorry, "" said the farmer.  ""I should warned you.  I told you that he likes to sit on eggs, but I forgot to tell you that he also likes to sit on fish.""",1203292800,3,1162,4.209090909090909

The main characters, Oliver, a redundant Professor of Comparative Religions, and Diane, a policewoman forced to take a leave of absence after asking sticky questions about her Superintendent's possible shady financial dealings (the late Alan Bates and Sinead Cusack play Oliver and Diane), are a perfectly matched couple who exchange witty banter as they travel through the scenic British landscape in search of a ""missing"" crossword puzzle compiler named Aristotle. Along the way they are shadowed by a sinister man, chased by villains in a helicopter, ultimately find love, and, yes, solve the puzzle. This is a refreshingly mature adult romantic comedy/mystery.

The script is witty and entertaining.  The acting is fine & the quirkiness of Alan Bates' character grows on you to where I, too, look for his other films.  I love a good mystery, but more than that, this is a very heart-warming journey of quest and family and relationships.  The scenery is wonderful & and music is a wonderful mix of classical and jazz.

2196142,5,B0006U5UU4,"You've likely never heard of Oliver's Travels.  You may not be able to ascertain if it's a movie or TV mini series.  Is it mystery or comedy?  English film makers or American or Scottish?  Recognize the male actor but just can't place him?  The local video store doesn't know what you're talking about?  How did you even stumble upon this?

Here are all the answers you need - Buy This Now, and Buy A Second Copy for A Loved One.

I'm a 40ish, straight, Hollywood blockbuster-lovin' American male and was told by a ditto male friend that he'd seen this great English (he thought) mystery series on PBS some ten years ago that was just one of those movies you stumble upon, later to believe it was seen ... or perhaps created ... just for you.  He wanted to recommend it, but had never seen evidence of it again.  A year later he sent me the DVD of Oliver's Travels - so excited to have found it - and insisted that my wife and I should watch it immediately.

We put it off for weeks because ... well ... it just didn't seem that it could be very good. All your questions were our questions - how could we even know if we were ever in the mood to watch it when we couldn't even tell what type of movie ... I mean TV ... show ... whatever ... it was?  But finally one boring evening we decided to try one episode just so that we could appease this friend who called regularly to see if we'd watched it.

WE called HIM several hours later - mourning that we'd finished the whole thing - addicts now - wanting to know how to get more.  Shortly after we sent copies to others and waited just as impatiently for them to watch.  Weeks later one finally phoned to say she was exhausted because once she and her husband saw the first episode they stayed up half the night finishing the others.

Why these reactions?  I'm a writer, and quite frankly I can't put this one into words.  Maybe it's a week's vacation by train alongside good friends through a bright and colorful countryside, when unexpectedly you find yourself on a mysterious mini quest that somehow you know means more to you than it really means at all.  It is such a relaxing trip that as each episode goes to credits you'll feel as if someone is trying to force you awake from a pleasant dream of your best childhood memories.  You'll hit play and go right back to sleep.  For a while.

Beautifully filmed country; the characters are fun, though simple, and very likable.  Not a strong plot, but just interesting enough to keep you coming back, and with some fun twists.  We even like the ""bad guys.""

But, alas, I can't shield you from the pain of when it ends.  Maybe it's better that the series only ran once.  It's a shame b/c I'd dearly love to see more episodes.  But some trips are only meant to be taken once - see the pictures of it again and again if you wish and there will be some enjoyment - but this trip was only meant to be REAL once in your life.

Take heart though - this holiday will stay with you - you just won't be able to put it into thoughts much less words ... as for all your questions and need to categorize, you won't care.  But know this - you will believe that life wouldn't have been as rich if you'd missed it.",1176681600,21,3200,4.232673267326732

Oliver has corresponded with Aristotle a few times before, but now he has decided to go meet his favorite crossword compiler in person.  Unfortunately, Oliver arrives at Aristotle's home only to find that it has been long since ruined by fire and abandoned.  Not to be daunted, Oliver inquires about Aristotle at the local police station and learns that Aristotle has left for the Orkneys (northern Scottish islands).  He also becomes involved with a policewoman named Diane Priest and a murder that the local police have been trying to solve.  It isn't long before Oliver and Diane realize that Aristotle's disappearance and the murder are connected and that the criminals are powerful people with influence in the police force.  Deciding that the answers are to be found in the Orkneys with Aristotle, Oliver and Diane set off on an exciting road trip filled with mystery, scandal, corruption, lots of word games and a bit of romance.  On their way, they meet a host of colorful characters and are pursued by a few sinister ones.  When they do  finally get some answers, they contain a couple of interesting surprises.  I enjoyed the movie because it has some good humor and offers a nice mini tour of the British Isles with a few fascinating tidbits on British history and folklore.  Watching it is a bit like taking a trip without leaving home.

There are a couple of warnings that I think I should include, though. I first saw this movie on PBS, but after I bought it, I learned that they had edited it slightly for content.  If I were to give the movie a rating, I would probably rate it R for swearing and sexually suggestive scenes.  I wouldn't recommend it for anyone younger than  high school age. On the plus side, for a  mystery movie, there is not much physical violence and no blood and gore.  You never actually see the bodies of the murder victims.  I think that I should also mention that some people may be a little offended at Oliver's attitudes toward religion.  Although he is not really anti-religion, he makes it clear that he does not take any form of religion seriously.  If that sort of thing bothers you, then you might not care for this movie.  I do not take Oliver and his opinions seriously, so I don't consider it a major issue, but I thought that it might be worth mentioning.  (After all, he was wrong about the helicopters.)",1151366400,4,2705,4.684322033898305

2196145,4,B0006U5UU4,"British television isn't afraid to delve into the romantic life of a man and a woman not in possession of rock hard abs, mid-riff baring clothing or those little tattoos that are always peeking up just over the pantline.  Witness 'As Time Goes By.'  Or, now, Alan Bates and Sinead Cusack in 'Oliver's Travels.'  This mini-series follows Alan Bates (a professor who has been told by the dean of the college where he teaches that he is now retired) on his quest to find the world's greatest living creator of crossword puzzles (the Bates character is a mad devotee of the things). -- When he reaches the crossword creator's house he stumbles upon a mystery, and consequently upon Sinead Cusack, a policewoman who journeys with Bates not only to solve the mystery but, ulitmately, to journey with Bates till death do they part.  Like most BBC mysteries, the couple doesn't investigate in dirty alleys or smelly bus stations.  Their quest takes them to the lake district and on to the Orkney Islands, an area as remote as it is photogenically beautiful.  There are castles and eccentrics and a great turn by Bill Paterson (of the equally charming 'Comfort and Joy').  One of the great pleasures of a BBC mystery is the travelogue that goes with it, and 'Oliver's Travels' doesn't disappoint. -- If there is one caveat, it is the relationship between Bates and Cusack.  The idea of their relationship is fine.  I have to admit, though, that the Bates character is a bit of an acquired taste, and while I didn't necessarily acquire the taste, I can only imagine that the lovely Sinead Cusack did.  I kept losing patience with his certain brand of eccentricity before she did, but then, she was the one in love with him.  'Oliver's Travels' delivers all the things many of us come to expect (and desire) from across the pond.  This isn't gritty crime drama ... it's mystery with a whimsical air, set against lush scenery.  It's dotty professors and handsome women using their wits to outsmart villains that are actually pretty smart.  And there's also that great castle.",1140825600,22,2063,4.758426966292135
2196146,5,B0006U5UU4,"Alan Bates in top form as a charming, eccentric ex-professor meets Sinead Cusack as a nearly-divorced policewoman with a mind of her own. Bates' character is addicted to puzzles of all kinds, and his search for the author of his favorite crosswords leads to an investigation of a high-level corporate conspiracy. The result is a quirky part thriller, part travelogue, part middle-aged love story, which is utterly British, literate, comic and engaging.

As Bates and Cusack travel the length of Britain from Wales to the Orkneys, they interact with characters from all strata of society, reveal their own roots and banter with each other about their encounters and their growing affection for one another. As soon as you relax into the pace of the travelers, the subtlety and brilliance of the acting comes into sharp focus. This is a warm and likable series that bears many viewings.",1138492800,8,884,5.01360544217687
