8018101,5,B0001Y4MQS,This is Sonny Chiba's best movie. It gives you inside view to the Ninja Arts!! Action packed!  This is a must have,1394841600,,114,4.181818181818182
8018102,5,B0001Y4MQS,"Another good post-Bruce Lee martial arts action film which is very good, and makes a good addition to my collection. It is interesting to see the Japanese style of martial arts movies, and I think that they are just as good action-wise!",1392163200,,236,4.642857142857143
8018103,1,B0001Y4MQS,"You can get all three of these movies in much better quality.

For The Executioner, there is a standalone:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Executioner/dp/B000A1INAS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Executioner</a>

For the UNCUT Bullet Train and a much better looking Golgo 13, there is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sonny-Chiba-Collection/dp/B000WC38PK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sonny Chiba Collection</a>, which is one of my favorite purchases.

What you have here are three dubbed, edited, unrestored non-anamorphic prints of good films that can be had elsewhere. Sure, you'll spend more getting those two aforementioned products, but the value will be much better.",1378598400,6,759,8.011904761904763
8018104,5,B0001Y4MQS,"Sonny Chiba never made a Godzilla film but he experiences the next best thing in a super endowed sugar momma with the biggest juggs that could smother Paul Bunyan! Its bad guys vs worse guys when a ninja (chiba), a molester, and an ex cop are rounded up to decimate a mafia gang. The ninja is in it for the money. The molester is in it for a secretary who promises ass but never delivers as he is impatiently waiting with a constant ""bulge"". The cop wants justice and is keeping an eye on the other two. Sonny Chiba is an animal out of control tearing a guy's rib bone out, bashing people 'til they scream, and dropping in on a bra busting sister and a brother stirring it up (Sonny experiences mountain climbing as he tries to get some milk from the source, but is interrupted from getting stretch marks around his mouth by the brother that's not done fighting yet). This movie is nasty, super bloody, and super goofy. All the karate fights are brutally great. Yasuaki Kurata shows up at the end with a great cameo and along with Chiba, leave a big bloody mess behind them. If you like movies that are over the deep end, don't miss it. I have both dvd versions. The non-anamorphic widescreen english dub from crash cinema would be the one recommended if a major fight scene hadn't been sliced up from the print being too grindhouse! The other one from Adness has flawless 16x9 video and audio except damn subtitles only.",1361232000,,1421,4.448275862068965
8018105,5,B0001Y4MQS,Awesome!! The Executioner reminds me of The Street Fighter trilogy but not as violent but it was almost there and this film was actually made before The Street Fighter Trilogy so you can say this is like a precursor to The Street Fighter Trilogy. This Film is awesome a classic Sonny Chiba film. I especially like it when body parts pop out of people or are ripped out. WATCH IT!!,1138579200,5,380,4.442857142857143
8018106,4,B0001Y4MQS,"Sonny Chiba, who became a major kung-fu star shortly after Bruce Lee's death, is one of the few martial artists to show the gritty aftermath of a kung-fu battle. In his most famous movie, ""The Street Fighter,"" he ripped out a man's throat and another man's testicles on screen, earning it the first (now defunct) ""X"" rating for violence. In this collection, we have three films from the hight of his popularity in the 1970s -""Golgo 13,"" ""The Bullet Train,"" and ""The Executioner.""
""Golgo 13"" is perhaps the weakest of the three films, although Chiba, playing the title assassin, is in fine form. The plot never makes much sense, but at least there are some good action scenes.
""The Bullet Train"" (later remade as ""Speed""!) is perhaps the best of the three movies, although Chiba is limited to the role of the train conductor and his screentime is limited. Still, there are some genuinely suspensful moments.
""The Executioner"" is the one that is most likely to please Sonny Chiba fans. It's a wacky and ridiculous movie, with some very graphic violence (a man's eye pops out early on), an insane plot, and some incredibly butt-ugly nudity. It's fun, fun, fun.
This set, titled ""Kill Chiba"" to capitalise on Chiba's role in ""Kill Bill,"" has the three films presented in 2.35:1 widescreen. The colours are washed out and the picture is extremely scratchy, but at least they're widescreen. The sound is strictly English dubbed, but that hardly matters. The biggest disappointment, though, is the lack of any extra features whatsoever. Could a poster gallery, a trailer, or even a biography and production notes been too much to ask for?",1091404800,15,1631,4.870503597122302
