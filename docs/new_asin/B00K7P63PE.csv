6404296,1,B00K7P63PE,"Not a believable plot line at all, the writer should have taken the extra 5 minutes and at least developed a logical introduction. ...cliche at best",1445558400,,148,4.730769230769231

6404299,5,B00K7P63PE,"Another in a long genre of prison movies which feature the star of the film as being moral upon all reproach. Not wrongfully convicted as he accepted a plea agreement offer in order to secure a short sentence. One would like to think this person would have been acquitted after a trial as he purely acted in self-defense. And, yes, wrongful convictions are too common here in the States also.",1445299200,3,392,4.614285714285714
6404300,2,B00K7P63PE,This is a clich fest with vanilla characters and wooden performances. There are so many of these wrong guy in prison movies. He goes to jail for a clear self defense situation so that would never happen in the states. Once he arrives in his Aussie cell more tropes and situations we've seen a million times before. If you want to watch better prison movie watch the Tom Selleck 1989 movie called A Wrong Man. Or for the mother of all great dude in prison movies check out the other 1989 classic called Lock Up with Sylvester Stallone.,1444867200,,534,4.459183673469388
6404301,5,B00K7P63PE,Great FIGHTING Australian movie. So good! If you like prison films you'll love this. Corruption and all....,1444694400,6,107,5.352941176470588
6404302,4,B00K7P63PE,"""Convict"" is the Australian version of a man wrongfully accused gone to prison and harassed, but fights back film. Ray (George Basha -also wrote/directed)  is convicted of manslaughter of a rich kid when it was clearly self defense. As always they can never get a good premise to put an innocent person in jail. He is also a war hero and uses his skills to survive, i.e. beat up guys 10 times his size...but he can never handle two of them. The warden is payed to make his life difficult.

This kind of film hasn't been done in at least a month, so it was so refreshing ;) Seriously, it held my interest even though it  lacked memorable tough guy sound bites and Pamela Grier. Worth a view if you are into the tough prison guy thing.

6404327,1,B00K7P63PE,"Absolute, worthless garbage.  Save yourself the headache and watch... well... just about any other movie ever made.  As if this movie wasn't ridiculous enough, they have to include the awkwardly unnecessary man on man rape scene that seems to be the hallmark of every poorly conceived prison movie.  If anyone out there thinks that their IQ is too high and wants to knock it down a couple dozen points, I'd recommend you try and sit through the first thirty minutes of this movie.

the military they call a soldier who wears a uniform like that a ""rag bag.""

6404335,5,B00K7P63PE,Hard to believe but I actually watched this movie twice within a week. While perhaps the reason for sending Ray to prison was less than convincing the plot within the prison walls was captivating with very decent acting. Very impressed with Officer William's role. Also the camera shots were excellent. Nothing for kids but a gripping movie worth watching multiple times.,1511481600,,371,5.098360655737705

6404360,3,B00K7P63PE,"It was oookaaay. It wasn't as bad as the 1 star reviews have made it out to be but it was far from as good as the 5 stars made it out to be. I see a lot of bashing on the acting but I don't think the acting was the problem (although the 18 year old kid is the worst actor of all time), it was the overall production. The story dragged on and on. It seemed to me that this could have been a better movie with a re-write and maybe a different director, upped the budget and might as well get a leading star and change about 30 minutes of the film into more action. I will admit I am impressed that this is the first prison movie I have seen without an insane amount of male nudity.",1493856000,,679,3.8226950354609928

One thing that annoyed me is that he is so upright, so moral he does not stand for seeking revenge  against his tormentors, even when implored to do so by the guard captain. (I'm not a snitch!). Aside from that little bit of bravo,his dealing with this harassment  made for dramatic narrative. and suspense to the final scene.",1491091200,,478,4.6

Advice: Watch the first 20 minutes to frame the story then skip to 1 hour 24 minutes. Don't get me wrong, its still slow as heck, but you can at least get it over quicker.

Don't get me wrong, it's an interesting movie. And the Australian accents are novel. However, Every.  Scene.  Goes.  On.  For.  A.  Really.  Really.  Long.  Time.",1488672000,,498,4.433333333333334

The Warden is on the take from the dead man's father to make Ray's life miserable.  In typical fashion of several other movies, two mid-level and one low level jailers are perversely happy to do just that.  Things get out if hand eventually and the low level guard wants out.  He gets out all right, but not in the way he might have wanted.
