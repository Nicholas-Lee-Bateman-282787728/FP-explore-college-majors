3895387,3,B002BVYBJW,"This is actually a very beautiful piece of artwork. If it wasn't Torchwood I would probably love it.  Having watched everything Torchwood from the start I was very dissapointed with it.  There are a ton of plot holes and a couple out of charachter parts though I won't say them because it would ruin the plot.  The story could have been great but for a 15 month wait I am discusted at all the mistakes.  Also, eventhough they have said that 4th season is ready to kick off depending how this one rates Children of Earth set out to destroy Torchwood and has done so very effectivly. Ianto fans won't watch a season 4 Jack fans have turned on him and Gwen fans are out of luck as well.  It is very dark so non Torchwood fans may have a hard time with it and Torchwood fans will be devistaited by the end.  If you choose to watch it good luck.  If you choose to buy it I would wait till it sells for shipping cost on ebay.",1247270400,15,919,4.129213483146067
3895388,5,B002BVYBJW,"Torchwood Season 3, ""Children of Earth"" is an adrenalin charged 5 episodes showing the truly darkest and sinister parts of our fellow man.

With as dark and deep a subject matter as is taken on with a deft hand, you find yourself mesmerized to the extent that you cannot look away and, instead, keep looking for more.

This is not your typical ""feel good"" season, but rather a mirror set-up by the unequivocal Russel T. Davies to our society in a sci-fi setting.

Bravo!

By the way, the ensemble cast was beyond excellent in their portrayal.",1247270400,8,542,4.614583333333333
3895389,4,B002BVYBJW,"First, let me comment that those who have posted so-called ""reviews"" need to stop. If you haven't actually watched this, then don't review it!

This is a continuation of the Torchwood series and, I have to add, the best of the bunch. I will not delve into the plot, as other reviewers have already done so.

The writing is Davies' best by far. Unlike previous Torchwood episodes, the focus remains on the story and does not go back to the tiring who's-sleeping-with-who-this-episode ""plot device."" I enjoy watching Torchwood, and I'm no prude, but I always thought those scenes were pointless and annoying and were made just because they could. I don't consider that adult, but rather juvenile. While Children of Earth does have a few scenes that delve into relationships, it does not derail too much from the overall story.

As other reviewers have stated, this series is much darker than the previous two. I found that a strength because it was harder to predict what would happen. We are mostly accustomed to TV shows where most things work out in the end and everything is resolved. Because of this, I found I could not guess what would happen and most of the twists shocked and shook me to the core.

The show is not without weakness, however. I gave it four out of five stars because, while the acting is top notch, there are a few scenes that are a bit awkward, or that didn't move me, when they were clearly meant to make the view feel that way.

Overall, Children of Earth is very different from previous series of Torchwood. It's very unsettling and probably isn't for those who don't like depressing things.",1247184000,9,1618,4.663157894736842
3895390,5,B002BVYBJW,"Russell T. Davies, freed from the restraints of the family-friendly brief of DOCTOR WHO, takes full control of TORCHWOOD and fulfills the spin-off series' more adult, tragic and even political agenda.

This is Davies creating a show with the safety wheels off. Where the previous two seasons often promised the characters would be pushed to their limits, this season really means it this time. A mysterious, seemingly unbeatable alien race makes contact with Earth by controlling and manipulating every child in the world, their demands as unfathomable as their threat to the human race, and the politicians are driven to both cover their own skins while committing a monstrous act in the name of the greater good. The question is whether Captain Jack Harkness and Torchwood are up to the challenge of averting a worldwide tragedy without losing their lives and their souls, and how much they're willing to sacrifice. Davies uses the medium of Science Fiction to explore issues of government corruption and cravenness, complicity and moral failure. This is adult Science Fiction drama, not the silly, adolescent teases of previous series of TORCHWOOD.

As some reviews have already noted, this 5-part miniseries changes all the rules of the show, raises the stakes and suspense to an almost unbearable degree, and by the end, nothing will ever be the same again. The changes to the show are tragic, permanent, and leaves the continuation of the series in doubt. However, it is also the angriest political drama the BBC has produced in years, the story openly states that governments are corrupt and untrustworthy, and practically encourages class warfare. This is on par with classic Old School British Leftist series such as EDGE OF DARKNESS, BOYS FROM THE BLACKSTUFF and STATE OF PLAY. It's attitude towards the government is consistent with what the British public currently feels about their government, and proves that Russell T. Davies has his finger firmly on the pulse of the nation.

This is the best political Science Fiction miniseries of recent years.  No US drama would dare push things this far.  It takes its influences from QUATERMASS, CHILDREN OF THE DAMNED, Lovecraft, and creates an angry indictment of government that took me by surprise.",1247184000,86,2258,5.125

3895392,1,B002BVYBJW,"While this is a well written story it is not a Torchwood story as fans have come to know over the previous two seasons.

It is incredibly almost oppressively dark, with no relief and the characters are all put into irredeemable positions whether it be due to death or their actions.

I personally will not be shelling out hard earned money on this DVD because I feel that as a fan who was drawn into the Torchwood mythos over series 1 and 2 that this was a kick in the teeth from the writers and producers.  No matter how well written something is, if you take what people come to watch and turn it around into something so completely out of character, then you might as well be watching another show.",1247184000,25,701,4.33587786259542

3895394,2,B002BVYBJW,"SPOILERS!!!! DO NOT READ IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED.

I've seen Torchwood: Children of Earth and while the 5-night miniseries that aired on the BBC (and later this month on BBC America) is well worth your time if you are a die-hard Torchwood fan, I think casual viewers will be turned off by the dark tone of this series.

Each one-hour episode ends with a plot twist (cliffhanger). It seems Captain Jack and Torchwood made a deal with some nasty aliens called the 456 in 1965 and that is now coming back to haunt him. The 456 are back and they are controlling the children of Earth. What do they want? They want the Earth to give up 10% of the total population of children on the planet or they will kill us all.

Enter Torchwood who tries to stop them, but with a gov't hit squad after Gwen, Rhys, Jack and Ianto, will the team will able to stop the alien threat, let alone survive themselves?

We also learn more about Jack's past and are given more insight into Jack and Ianto's relationship, as well as a welcome surprise for Gwen and Rhys.

But the question of who lives and who dies is answered by Day 4. And a lot of die-hard TW fans were not happy with the response. i.e. A major character dies.

So if you are a 'shipper in this universe, then the third season of Torchwood is not going to be pleasant for you. It's going to be painful, very painful. Which is why I suggest you don't buy the series on DVD. Rent it or download it first. See if you can deal with it, then if you truly love the plot, buy it.

So while I enjoyed the overall acting, directing and quality of the Children of Earth series, because of various plot points which to me were cliched, overdramatic and unnecessary - and given the misleading advertising hype that Russell T. Davies and company put out about the series in the months prior to it airing - I cannot give it more than 2 stars.",1247184000,16,1877,4.270422535211267

3895396,5,B002BVYBJW,"Torchwood is a great series! This description is from the BBC America Shop web site:

1965: Twelve children are gathered together on a deserted hilltop, before being surrounded by a harsh, bright light... and then they are gone!

Today: All over Earth, children stop moving. Stop playing. Stop laughing. Stop everything. Then, as one, they begin to speak with the same voice, announcing to the governments of the world the imminent arrival of a new alien threat. ""We Are Coming, We Are Coming...""

As the British Government closes ranks, it issues a death warrant against Captain Jack and Torchwood. Now forced to flee for their lives, it becomes clear to the Torchwood team that this isn't the aliens' first visit to Earth, and a terrible price is going to be paid for sins of the past...",1245196800,19,789,4.786764705882353
3895397,5,B002BVYBJW,"Doctor Who (during Eccleston's and Tennant's eras) was my favorite show. I enjoyed Torchwood's first two seasons as a fun, more adult continuation of that world.
I had no idea Davies and crew had the ability to pull off something like Children of Earth. It is some of the best storytelling in all of Doctor Who's universe. The reveal at the end when we are told what the children are used for was seriously disturbing -- in the BEST possible way. This was meant to be an epic miniseries with scope and range and it succeeded.

3895401,3,B002BVYBJW,"Season 3 was a major diversion from the stories of the first two seasons.  What it did was to connect up the political corruption which has created such things as ""Area 51"" in Nevada which had always been concluded by me to be nothing but a tourist gimmick on behalf of the Lost Wages Chamber of Commerce.  The postured explanation of it as an alien research station took on new life including the related Wholly Weird puppet play actor Ronny Raygun's felony religionist criminal scheme to transfer 77,000 TONS of high grade radioactive material to a nearby site at Yucca Mountain.  That Raygun and his successors have been radically abrogating Articles I, IV, V, XIII, and XIV of the US Constitution Amendments since 1980 also suggests alien influence in the former United States of America far beyond the felony religionist abrogations inflicted by the goofermint's puppeteering Wholly Roman Umpire.",1490745600,,901,5.033557046979865

Instead they had him running off into space (if i recall) and just left things unresolved with lots of death, destruction, and what looked like the end of Torchwood.  I think John Barrowman is an excellent actor who got a stinky exit in this series.",1465862400,,812,4.3533333333333335

3895470,5,B002BVYBJW,"""Children of Earth"" is an excellent addition to the Torchwood Saga. Like all of the Torchwood stories, the characters are rendered in such a believable fashion that we feel sadness when the characters feel sad; their losses are our losses. The story shows Earth brought to the brink of disaster, but at its heart, ""Children of Earth"" is about the love that exists between parent and child. No matter that the threat is an alien one; the solutions are centered around what it means to be human.

As with all the Torchwood stories, our heroes are supported by other brave souls who do not understand the full nature of the threat, but choose to help anyway. They accept the danger without any idea of how perilous the situation actually is. For a group of stories that deal with aliens at every turn, Torchwood is incredibly human!",1465776000,,829,4.678082191780822

I thought Mulder in X-Files was a bad character - the Torchwood members were horrifically worse than Mulder ever was to Fox).  Season 3 was refreshing, having rid the team of some cast, adding new cast and came into its own as thrilling with twists.

3895514,1,B002BVYBJW,"I love Doctor Who and the first 2 seasons of this show.  I was saddened by the finale in season 2.  It really should have ended there.

If you are in the mood to be angry, cry and feel depressed for hours, if not days, and don't care that the science fiction aspect is practically nil, then you might want to watch Children of Earth.  Personally, I would rather gauge out my eyes or watch Steel Magnolias because at least the actors in that movie are better and the storyline made sense.

*spoilers*

Here are the reasons why I am so disgusted that I gave this season negative stars and want to curse out the executive producer of this show:

1.  Killing innocent children. I am a mother and the depiction of the childrens' killings were indescribably AWFUL. While I understand this is fiction and killings occur in the story line, the killing of children was entirely UNEXPECTED given the tenor of the past seasons.
2.  Major personality changes to remaining Torchwood characters.
3.  This season felt like a complete overhaul from the previous ones.  I went into this season to be entertained with quirky, thoughtful science fiction episodes (as expected from what was previously delivered in seasons 1 and 2).  Children of Earth was SO different from what was expected I got whiplash.  It was DARK, ANGSTY,  and DEPRESSING - honestly, this resembles something written by some moody teenager out to shock people.

John Barrowman takes what was originally a guest spot on Dr Who series and turns it into a goldmine.  His performance is often over-the-top and in-your-face, but it's done so well you'll be glued.

Second off . . .
SPOILER ALERT!!!!!! DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU'RE OKAY WITH KNOWING WHAT WILL HAPPEN

That said, I want to start off by saying that I thoroughly enjoyed this series. It was an amazing series. I always thought that Torchwood would shine brighter if it strayed away from the Doctor Who format, and this is a proven example of that. Doctor Who can have individual episodes that hint at overarching plot lines, but still wrap themselves in the wonders of each specific conflict that the Doctor faces. Torchwood shines here because it doesn't have a Doctor. It shows the absolute helplessness of humanity as it stands without the Doctor against a threat that it simply cannot identify or analyze. The writing in this series is some of the best I have witnessed. Let us take a look at the conflict of the series . . .

Note first, however, that literally the entire series is shrouded in mystery, and the layers of mystery are slowly peeled away as the plot thickens. I must, though, explain it in its full detail to show just how amazing the writing really is. The first episode starts out with a flashback to an event in which children were sacrificed to an alien race identified merely as the 456, due to the frequency associated with them. Flash forward to present times when something strange is happening with the children (at this point, no one truly knows about the event in the past or much of anything about the 456), while Torchwood simultaneously is on the lookout for new members to recruit after the deaths of fan favorites Owen Harper and Toshiko Sato. The children start announcing mysterious messages that are later realized as the arrival of the 456. Strangely, one man was not fit to be sacrificed to the aliens so long ago because they needed children and he started puberty unusually early. So this man is the link between that event and the current one. Meanwhile, the government is hoping that such a situation of child sacrifice is behind them, but they still want no information of that event leaking out. Peter Capaldi's Mr. Furbisher decides to send out a kill order an all parties involved with the event, which includes Captain Jack Harkness (a.k.a. The Face of Boa).

This is just where it all starts, ladies and gentlemen. So in order to kill Harkness, they must eliminate all assets surrounding him, obviously leading to the conclusion of the decimation of Torchwood. In a lucky coincidental circumstance, Gwen, who had been told by the deranged man from the first group of children that she was pregnant, was checking herself in one of the scanners in the Torchwood facility. Captain Jack caught up with her and found out that there was a bomb inside his own belly. Ianto and Gwen escape, leaving Jack (and the pterodactyl . . . :'( . . . ) behind. The entire facility explodes. Gwen and Ianto are on the run and everyone they know is in danger. Gwen and Rhys manage to escape in the nick of time. Ianto manages as well.

Meanwhile, Jack is literally in pieces, but the shreds of his body are locked and secured in a military base where he painfully begins to reassemble himself. Because of his persistence, his cell is filled with concrete. Gwen and Ianto manage to break him out beautifully, and they all fled to Torchwood 1 where Ianto used to work. There, they steal all necessary supplies to get a secondary Torchwood up and running. From there, they utilize the help of a secretary working for Furbisher in order to spy on them. They use Torchwood contact lenses in order to record and listen to all activity going on with the 456, which has now arrived. Turns out, they used the human children as a sort of narcotic drug in order to get high, which is why they end up demanding 10% of the world's population of children. The government continues to cover up what is going on, and after a failed counter offensive by Torchwood (resulting in Ianto's death), they play to gather up all designated children to be given to the aliens.

Furbisher, who is merely a middleman, is requested to give his children up to help support the cover story that the aliens ended up betraying a trust rather than the government willingly giving the children away. Furbisher ends up killing his family and himself, knowing that the government would stop at nothing to ensure that his children be sent. Meanwhile, Captain Jack, who was responsible for the first group of children, is mourning everything about his life. He realizes that he has become a neutral necessity, a man who is willing to do horrible deeds to save humanity. Ultimately, he must sacrifice his grandson to send a constructive wave frequency back through the kids to the 456, which ends up eradicating the aliens, but also ends up killing his grandson.

Like I said, amazingly intricate writing, but I wanted more fighting sequences. This was the last of Ianto, who is one of the greater fighters and agents of Torchwood history. Seeing him die by poison didn't seem right at all. Don't get me wrong, it was a tear-jerker, but it wasn't justifiable. When Jack and Ianto storm in, I wanted them to be like Neo and Trinity. It just didn't seem like enough closure on Ianto, who meant so much to the storyline of Torchwood as a whole.",1405900800,,5281,4.636752136752137

3895576,5,B002BVYBJW,"I'm a huge Doctor Who fan and so gave quite a bit of latitude to my enjoyment of the various Torchwood seasons.  And John Barrowman has done a great job of fleshing out the character of Captain Jack over both shows.  That said, and now in retrospect, I see the first two seasons of Torchwood as rather uneven though not without highpoints and the fourth season of Miracle Day as too drawn out and ""American.""  It was season three, Children of Earth, where everything came together for me and in my opinion where Torchwood reached its potential and its zenith.  Brilliantly written, perfectly paced, purposeful and provocative and with really shining performances by all the actors involved.  The aliens are truly terrifying  and seemingly invincable and the ending as morally wrenching as anything you'll ever see on television.  It's a triumph for Barrowman and Russell T Davies.  And stealing the show up until his departure is an amazing Peter Capaldi (the new Doctor, by the way!) as a tortured bureaucrat at the mercy of a shameless Prime Minister.  This is the Torchwood, and by association Doctor Who, you want- confident, profound and in good hands.",1404345600,6,1157,4.892307692307693
3895577,5,B002BVYBJW,"I am a big science fiction fan and a Doctor Who Fan in particular. I like watching Children of the Earth all by itself every so often. It is that good. A complete show all by itself.

I like the first 2 Seasons of Torchwood and would have liked the show to go on. But I could see that some of the stories were a little weak. Some shows simply stop leaving the watchers hanging.

Not Torchwood. It ends with a mini series where most of the cast is killed and the Headquarters is destroyed. A five part mini series covering one day in each part. A solid story connecting the whole thing that is truly startling aimed at well - children. The survivors of Torchwood are settling into new lives. And the show is done.

I consider Miracle Day a whole new show that came years later.",1403827200,,776,4.22972972972973

3895579,5,B002BVYBJW,"This season is more cohesive and doesn't try to explore all the various routes to get attention like the previous seasons- namely sexuality- Maybe because they already tried it.
In any case, I liked it more than the previous episodes.
Still, I have to admit the acting in the UK is a lot better than the US. If Kevin Costner can get millions for his performance, these guys and gals should be earning significant figures. Even the supporting actors are great, especially the guy who played the orphan who escaped. I know I have seen him in other productions, but don't know his name- I should read the credits.",1402531200,,610,4.605504587155964
3895580,4,B002BVYBJW,"I wonder whose decision it was to infuse the Torchwood series with non-stop family-involved storyline. It was a bad decision, as few viewers are going to care all that much about the husbands, aunts, nephews, parents, daughters and lovers of the individual members of the gang. It's not so much that the family-characters are poorly drawn, although I think all agree that Gwen's hubby is a needless distraction. And the constant ""I must save my father,"" cliffhanger in Miracle Day ceased to be a cliffhanger and quickly became an excuse to go to the loo or get a coffee refill. I kept thinking about how these side-characters are dealt with in the Dr. Who series. Amy's hubby Rory and Rose's boyfriend are rather deftly incorporated into the main story, and that does not happen in the Torchwood series at all. The writers go all out convincing us that The End Is Near and Gwen and company are all that can save us, so it simply looks silly to have the Torchwood folk endangering the universe so grandad can enjoy another cup of tea. Sadly, I think it was a matter of filler, the need to stretch the episodes out a bit. The writers' energy would have been better spent creating more main-story-related content than devoting so much effort to minor characters and their dilemmas.",1401753600,,1278,4.709821428571429

3895640,5,B002BVYBJW,This series within Torchwood had a Doctor Who feel. I did not know what was going to happen and if they would be able to figure out what to do next. Children of Earth showcased the story more of who is in charge and the dangers of deals.,1389139200,,237,3.9583333333333335
3895641,5,B002BVYBJW,"Most of those who rated Season 3 of Torchwood poorly are Dr. Who fans.  I am not a Dr. Who fan.  I've not watched one episode of Dr. Who, nor will I ever ... campy, silly, ironic, adolescent sci fi / fantasy is not my thingie (nor are comic books, action figures or movies where special effects trump character and plot).

However, I thought I would give Torchwood a go, as I had run out of things to watch.  I kind of liked season one.  Some episodes i thought exceptional.  Then, accidentally, I skipped Season 2 and watched Season 3 next.  I was riveted ... totally engaged.  Wow.  Excellent story, lots of tension. pathos...the lot.  Went back to Season 2 and I have given it the series up as after 4 episodes I want to either kill Capt. Jack or the actor who plays him.

So, if, like me, the idea of Dr. Who is unappealing, try season 3 of Torchwood -- you may want to watch a bit of Season 1, tho, just to get the idea straight first.",1389052800,,940,4.166666666666667

3895648,1,B002BVYBJW,"Dr. Who, and Torchwood, to me have always been based on hope and believing in the fundamental goodness of every inch of every universe. In the most dire circumstances, both series reliably give those of us with tough lives the hope that no matter how tough things are we can figure out a way to solve the situation and maintain our integrity.

Bad enough Harkness murders his own grandson while his daughter watches her only child suffer and die. Worse, is that the writers put us in the position of watching it happen?! for what purpose? Bleakness? Shock value? ""Political commentary"" - even that is not clear. We are not allowed to sympathize with anything here.

For half a century, whether the stories were younger or more mature, these franchises have led their viewers into dark places. And we, the viewers have followed, because we TRUST the ""hero"" and goodness to prevail in the end. And we trust that if the writers ask for our sympathy in a character, that sympathy will be respected. I already know the there is darkness - I don't watch these series to be reminded of that! I watch them, going into the darkness, to be reminded of hope and light. The writers cornered me, and killed all sympathy - completely broke my trust in the creators of the show. I will never watch anything with the name Torchwood on it again.

3895653,5,B002BVYBJW,"Children Of Earth is like a little Torchwood mini-series. The premise is a bit demented but I could deal with it, I enjoyed it. Not so many special features on this set. I'm giving it 5 stars because it kept me entertained, the box is nice, and I thoroughly enjoyed Ianto, Gwen, and Rhys. I watched all of Torchwood in a few weeks so I may have a better opinion of it than people who watched it as it aired. I do understand their issues with it.
Here's where the spoilers come in so stop reading if you want to remain oblivious. This is the first set I began watching where I felt like I actually really liked Gwen. I never disliked her, it just took more time for me to appreciate her character. Ianto was still my favorite. Jack doesn't quite seem like the Jack I'd come to know in the first 2 seasons or in Doctor Who. But I overlooked this because Gwen and Ianto were still cool. I could deal with the demented premise and all of the ridiculousness. What bothers me is episode 4, Ianto dies. I went into Torchwood knowing Ianto, Tosh, and Owen, do not survive the series. When Tosh and Owen died it was sad but it made sense in the context of the story. You could deal with it, they died fighting. Ianto's death was unnecessary. It's like they threw it in there merely for shock value. And he dies because of a poisonous gas? Really?! It was sudden, uncalled for and ridiculous. Part of me didn't even want to watch the last episode. I watched anyway, I liked the ending, it was an appropriate series finale considering everything that happened.

Here's my take - if you like intensity, moral quandaries, suspense, and intense emotional moments and character development...proceed with this season. It does not disappoint. If you only like Torchwood for those campy silly moments reminiscent of Doctor Who, then this season may not be for you.

It seems a bit unfair for people to rate it badly just because it was different from other seasons and more intense than they wanted it to be. I don't think Torchwood was ever intended to be particularly lighthearted. It is clearly an adult show with adult themes and complexity. It certainly isn't a comedy, and it isn't a family show like Doctor Who. I felt like this season was more a coming into itself season for Torchwood, rather than a losing it's way as some reviewers suggested. This season added a lot more depth to the show; I was getting bored with it before.",1382400000,,927,4.6871165644171775

Torchwood in general is fun enough but I'm just not as enamored with it as I am Doctor Who.  As for ""Children of Earth"", I went back and found these to see Peter Capaldi in action.  He did a good job as Frobisher but it definitely doesn't give much insight into how he will play the Doctor, which is probably a good thing.

3895681,5,B002BVYBJW,I just started this series. It is as good or better than the other seasons. John Barrowman and Eve Myles are awesome. I cannot get enough Torchwood. Please bring it back again.,1376697600,,176,4.53125
3895682,5,B002BVYBJW,"In a strange, yet fitting move, Torchwood turn from an episodic, monster-of-the-week procedural, like its parent show, into a heavily-serialized miniseries. This move, showing many similarities to a similar move shown in Buffy the Vampire Slayer's own spin-off, Angel, works for the best, though, providing a masterpiece of television in Torchwood: Children of Earth.

After the unfortunate deaths of Toshiko Sato and Owen Harper, Torchwood Three was reduced to only three members, Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles), Ianto Jones (Gareth David-Lloyd), and Jack Harkness (John Barrowman). Eventually, they adapt and acclimate to their new situation and all is good again. However, one day, every child in the world stops motionless, and a new alien threat is coming to Earth. While Torchwood investigates this threat, a new assistant to Secretary of the Home Office, John Frobisher (Peter Capaldi), Lois Habiba (Cush Jumbo), ends up involved in the strange new turn of events more than she could ever have expected.

Children of Earth can only be described as a masterpiece of television storytelling. Reducing the episode count to five and turning itself into a miniseries was a brilliant decision. The narrative of the season is strong and engaging all the way through, helped by excellent themes, tight focus, and superb pacing, keeping everything tense and exciting all the way through. The mystery of who these aliens are is not only a thrilling one, but a scary one as well, and there is not a dull moment to be had in the search for answers as to who they are and what they want, answers which will come at a shock to many viewers. On top of that lies an excellent analysis of the extremes people will go to when threatened, as well as the hard decisions people have to make. Due to all of this, this series is an emotional ride from beginning to end, one that will break hearts as well as mend them. It may be some of the best television out there, but Children of Earth is definitely also some of the hardest to watch for that very reason, and viewers will go through the gamut of emotion watching it. Torchwood was always just as character focused as its parent show, Doctor Who, and Children of Earth is no different. Although the Torchwood team is smaller now, the ensemble cast of characters introduced here are all well-developed and interesting. The protagonists are full of likeable, strong characters, with Lois Habiba and Rhys Williams having some great growth over the course of the episodes, while the antagonists are all perfectly ""love-to-hate"", often showing their own depths and intricacies that cast a new light on their motivations and personalities. The story and characters are all complimented by a great cast of actors who play their parts with energy and emotion. All of the emotion here would not exist if it weren't for the great acting from the likes of Barrowman, Myles, David-Lloyd, Jumbo, Capaldi, and so many more.

The effects in this series of Torchwood may not be as high-end as others, where the aliens were more seen, but that only benefits it all. The mysteriousness of the alien threat here is enhanced by the little you see of them, a minimalistic move that makes the unknown threat that much scarier. There are definitely moments for effects, such as a major explosion early on or the arrival of the alien threat, but these are still kept to a minimum to ground the action and improve the unknown mysteriousness of the antagonists this time around. The soundtrack, however, is haunting and thrilling, providing the right moods at the right moments.

Torchwood: Children of Earth is, without a doubt, a shining example of television. It's intelligent, thematic, emotional, and all the right kinds of thrilling. Everything about Children of Earth is excellent, from the writing to the production to the acting. Not a single part of it really disappoints. Fans of the series have no need to worry about this change in direction (something that would be continued in Miracle Day). They only need to sit back and experience this ride.",1376179200,2,4064,4.911208151382824

3895691,3,B002BVYBJW,"I'm a pretty big sci-fi buff, and Torchwood definitely delivers on the story front.  The only reason I decided to give it three stars instead of four, was the odd interaction of sexuality that seems forced at times. It could just be a cultural difference between the US and the UK, but sometimes the character development appears out of nowhere from episode to episode, but only in the realm of sexuality.  For me, I felt that it interfered with the enjoyment of the sci-fi story enough that it actually took away from the quality of the show. This is not a critique on sexual orientation, it's a matter for me of personal preference about the importance of sexuality in a sci-fi series; being that it's best use, in my opinion, is an underlying tension and not an overt action. Aside from this, the show has decent enough CGI, often fairly original stories, and other elements due to the British production, that leant to having a fresh feel for the US sci-fi viewer.  Definitely worth the watching once you've worn down other faves in the sci-fi realm!",1373846400,,1054,4.655913978494624

3895706,5,B002BVYBJW,"The 3rd season of Torchwood was the most heartbreaking one yet.  Every episode was full of angst and excitement.  When Jack has to make some horrible choices you feel his pain.  Also, Gwen kicks ass in this season.  I loved it.",1365033600,,227,4.463414634146342
3895707,4,B002BVYBJW,I loved this miniseries of torchwood and I adore torchwood. It's just that the storyline here is disturbing for me. It affected my mood in a not so great way. But you can say that because it did this to me it was remarkably well done!,1364688000,,234,4.108695652173913
3895708,5,B002BVYBJW,"Torchwood Children of Earth was poorly reviewed compared to the previous seasons, and I was hesitant to continue watching the series after some of our friends had departed:(  But It seems that the show reinvented itself for this well crafted and gripping season!  Where the previous seasons consisted of mostly disjointed, self contained episodes, the continuity between those of this season was a welcome change.  It allowed for deeper character development of the main players and had a more human feel.  I could really empathize with the characters this season.  The trend started about half way through last season with Owen's reanimation and has developed rapidly.  Keep it up Torchwood!",1364256000,,692,5.245454545454545

3895717,5,B002BVYBJW,Great quality. Good sound and played fine in my blue ray player. Finally I got to see the entire show.,1361750400,,102,4.15
3895718,4,B002BVYBJW,"One of the things I have always enjoyed about British television series (both comedies and dramas) is that the stories are told in a clear arc, with very few exceptions.  There is a beginning, middle, and end, unlike American series, which go on and on episodically until ratings wane and they are canceled.  Sometimes the stories have happy endings, sometimes they are grim, and sometimes the ending is unclear, much like real life.

I enjoyed both the serial and episodic aspects of Torchwood, and felt this was a fitting end to the series, though it was sad to say good-bye to the characters and the ending was not exactly happily-ever-after.  I elected not to watch ""Miracle Day"" after reading the reviews.  (At least I didn't walk around moping for days, as I did after watching all three seasons of ""Ashes to Ashes""!)

Not recommended for children under 12 due to adult themes.  My tweens really enjoy ""The Sarah Jane Adventures"".",1361404800,,936,4.8125
3895719,5,B002BVYBJW,Great SF mystery/thriller. The end is totally unanticipated. In fact the whole series is great. Kudos to the BBC and the show's producer/director/actors.,1360454400,,153,5.695652173913044
3895720,5,B002BVYBJW,"But they tell a great story, and I really appreciated how this set us up for Torchwood: Miracle Day.  I saw the Miracle Day season before I saw seasons 1 and 2.  I understand them now, and now I like them even more.",1360454400,,215,3.9767441860465116
3895721,4,B002BVYBJW,"The Torchwood  team are at their full potential as are the writers/producers. This is a first rate finale that wrapped my attention around it, sputtered Britain's long held and cherished notions about class vrs. socialism as well as their commitment toward education, children's rights and top down government rule. It involved the cowed attitude toward my nation, the USA, and touted an attitude similar to that of an errant brother who has made a mistake that involves his younger brother who must take charge, which in this story boasts a take on an impatient and angry American General who bullies his way into taking charge and makes decisions that the synchophant prime minister of Britain is incapable of lest his brilliant career is sullied by making any brave and responsible choice in the matter..From the first the second in command is ordered to take full responsibility for the invasion by the ""we...are...here!"" aliens who've captured the minds of all the children in the world.
  Actually the take over of humanity's children by the aliens and their reason for wanting our ""brats"" in the first place is ridiculous. The burden on the second in command of Britain, Mr Frobisher- 'stiff upper lip and all'- slave to duty is the real story. There's a bit of hero worship typical of the Brits in his story, lots of character development and good acting by Mr. Frobisher (excuse spelling?) bolstered soundly by a 'good woman' and very believable portrayal by the actress who plays his faithful secretary. There's additional  nonsensical story line about Great Britain keeping secret a deal with the aliens way back years ago, and their apparently violating their agreement now a day all orchestrated by Captain Jack who now is helpless against them. Well to be fair Mr. Frobisher had the Torchwood facility blown apart and Captain Jack executed several times by a lush, whip snapping lady officer, again well played so it's believable, at least by myself anyway! Oh by the way there's a whole lot less guy smooching from Mr. Barrowman and his relationship with Ianto is consolidated by his sacrifice while meanwhile his brother in law queries over and over is Ianto 'queer?"" JEEZEPLEASE!! give me a break! And he is only for Jack etc.,etc.. Gwen and Ryse have held it together long enough to come with up her pregnancy, and she waddles through her parts in the same uninspired performance Eve Miles has always given from the first show. We are spared Barrowman's over acting in this one as Capt. Jack is supposedly powerless without his stolen collection of alien gizmoes, his facilities and greenlight from the govt so he spends most of the show sitting around moping. Even his gaspings back to life are low key and suck. I guess by now you are wondering if I just miss-typed that first part about my liking this series. Couldn't be farther from the truth, It's  just thoughts about the highlights that swim up to my forebrain is all. Go on watch all five shows, it's wonderful..",1359331200,,2989,4.864440078585462
3895722,5,B002BVYBJW,I chose to go with the HD format because it has a crisper quality. I was not disappointed in this purchase. I would highly recommend this product for clear and precise image quality to this beloved TV series.,1359331200,,208,4.5
3895723,3,B002BVYBJW,"Overall it wasn't too bad as a continuation mini-series. But with half the team killed off in the last season it was somewhat lacking in the familiar Torchwood family. This was more of a mini-series (like Miracle Day after) than part of the TV serial. It's still worth buying if you're a Torchwood fan, but just a little disappointing if compared to the first two series (seasons).",1358812800,,381,4.701492537313433
3895724,5,B002BVYBJW,"This was the last season, but really a ""miniseries"".  Fanastic story about Capt. Jack and sacrifice.  You may not really get much if you have not seen Torchwood before, but it will be entertaining.  An outstanding ending to a fantastic BBC Wales TV series.",1358380800,,256,4.7727272727272725

3895726,5,B002BVYBJW,"It's different.  Not in plot, necessarily... easy enough to follow and the characters (while somewhat complex) aren't hard to figure out.

But each Torchwood series is different in tone - the ensemble and their feelings and interactions toward each other evolve (or maybe mutate) between seasons.  So while you may have loved the first series, you can dislike the second, then like Children of Earth (3rd series) and dislike Miracle Day (4th.)  I have to say I loved the first series, ended up loving the second half of the second, was shocked by Children of Earth but have rewatched it again and again.  I'm currently working through Miracle Day and liking it.

Anyway, I don't think there is much midground - you'll either love or hate Children of Earth.",1355961600,,756,4.821705426356589
3895727,5,B002BVYBJW,"This was one powerful and epic piece of television. The storyline is excellent and entirely riveting from start to finish.
The 456 were the most interesting villains ever created for the series. They rank up their with the faerie folk from the first series. It'll definitely tear you up a little towards the end but its a good thing that this show concluded this way. There is a fourth series but it is entirely a different thing. So I do consider this third series the door closing on the series as the following series has such a foreign and disjointed feel. Still you should check it out if you want to make up your own mind.",1355702400,,628,4.422413793103448
3895728,5,B002BVYBJW,"This is, by a wide margin, my favorite season of Torchwood.  The darkness and emotion conveyed throughout this mini-series shows what a creative bunch of people they have, with solid acting performances that really make you care about the characters involved, even if you aren't fond of some of them.

Wonderfully imaginative plot that catches you doesn't let you go until the ride is over.  While it won't have the same impact if you haven't seen the two earlier seasons, it is possible to be viewed as a self-contained story.",1355270400,,527,4.833333333333333

Pertwee and Baker are still my favorites from the original series. The current doctor, the fool who acts like a 12 year old, needs lessons. The current incarnation could learn much from this final BBC produced season of Torchwood (Starz  picked it up for an additional season.) It's dark, moody, and not for kids. We see captain Jack's dangerous side, and what happens to those who are close to him. The Doctor's companions simply leave. In the earlier series, they often died. Much more believable, and this five episode series is just that. Believable. Politicians act exactly as we expect, and as they probably would act.

3895736,5,B002BVYBJW,"I am a late fan to Torchwood and began watching the series recently.  I watched Seasons 1 and 2 and liked them quite a bit.  Then I hit Season 3 and was utterly completely mesmerized and amazed.  Children of Earth is incredible.  Normally I am not a fan of emotionally dark or depressing plots as I have a difficult time shaking them off and I usually regret a decision to watch something that I'm reasonably certain will make me depressed or weepy.  Thus, I will never watch Marley and Me or Tuesdays with Morrie or any of those other horrible things that are designed to make you cry like a kid who got punched in the gut.  BUT, this series is well worth the emotional punch in the gut.

The story is a new enough twist on older themes to feel fresh and tightly woven.  There are the old moral dilemmas of: 1) do the ends justify the means; 2) what is the value of a single life; 3) is it okay to sacrifice some for the good of many; 4) just following orders; etc.  These are mixed in with other old issues such as class warfare, the grubby disgustingness of politics and what one becomes when one is more concerned about covering one's ass more than anything else.

The tension continues to build and build while cruising through entire ranges of emotion, and it's paced well to keep you hanging throughout the series as well as throughout each episode.  The story is full.  I think that's the best word to describe it.  There's so much packed into the series in terms of how it plays with your heart and mind.  Even after watching it, your head and heart will keep running through the story to go over this bit and that bit that you were unable to fully process while in the grip of watching it through.

The storyline starts off with a small mystery which increases in intensity from odd (huh why are these kids freezing?) to creepy (children should never do anything in unison because it's creepy but I admit this is a fear I've had since reading A Wrinkle in Time) to frightening (vague threats of a coming visit) to mad panic horror (dear god they're doing WHAT with the children?? Must rewind to make sure I actually saw what I think I saw) -- and that's just from viewing the aliens' actions.  The plot then turns to viewing the actions of humans to the situation and a whole new level of emotional turmoil develops from disapproving disgust to vomit-inducing repulsion.  To complete the emotional roller coaster, the story is sad throughout because there aren't any easy answers.

BUT, this is well worth viewing because you won't be able to get the images or plot out of your mind and it'll keep you turning round and round to think over things.  It's satisfying because it's an interesting story that's developed well visually and by the pace of the plot with enough substance and emotional tuning to make you feel full and satisfied but you're left still wanting more more more... More Torchwood, more Jack, more Gwen, more Rhys just more more more.  Please.",1348358400,,2972,4.499068901303538

Unlike earlier seasons, each episode is not a stand alone story resolved within the episode, but rather this is a mini-series, in which the story is resolved at the end of the series.  Love the Ianto Jones character in this series.  Captain Jack & Gwen are always wonderful.  The story line is haunting and well done.",1338768000,,376,4.7384615384615385
3895739,5,B002BVYBJW,"There's two ways of looking at this.  Season 3 of Torrchwood is only 5 episodes long.  Or, it's all one story, and it's a little long.  They could have done it in 3 or 4 episodes.  On the other hand, this gives a lot of time for character development, and gives the all the excellent actors (both in the main cast and all the guest stars) a chance to shine.  Well written, very clever, with a few unbelievable elements, but then nothing's perfect.

 A lot of terrible things happen in this story, but if you can handle it, it's worth watching (think ""Pan's Labyrinth."")  There are tiny amounts of humor dribbled through to counter-balance this slightly, but they're few and far between.  Strangely enough, I think anyone of any political persuasion could derive a message in favor of their position from this series, from the liberal ""we aren't doing enough for our children"" to the conservative ""big government is bad"" to the anarchist ""screw it, let's just get rid of the government.""

It grabs you in the first few minutes and does not let go.  Great script, and excellent performances by the Torchwood actors we knew from the two series. Plus, Peter Capaldi is excellent as the government bureaucrat at the center of the crisis.  The tension builds throughout, with an explosive finale.

3895742,5,B002BVYBJW,"Wow.  Just wow!

The first two seasons of Torchwood were good.  Very good, sometimes.  Well worth watching.

I tend to prefer a TV series that is really a series - a story that spans episodes, and only makes sense when you watch them in order.  The first two seasons had stories that could be played in any order, except that some earlier stories were picked up in later episodes, such as a girl who died in episode 1 to return later, and in character development.

Well, in Season 3, a.k.a. Children of Earth, the Torchwood writers got to stretch out and write a story that spans five episodes.  The story is far more complex, more dark, more amazing, and more exciting than anything of the first two seasons.  And that's saying something!

It's hard to say much about it without getting into spoilers.  Like many of the first two seasons, aliens are involved.  These aliens are a bit more demanding.  There are dark secrets of the past, for Jack, for the government.  The story gets darker, and darker, and darker.  Shocking!  By the middle of the final episode, I was really wondering how they would wind it all up.  But they did, and in a satisfying and reasonably natural fashion.

One important difference is that sex is really not much part of the story this time.  Considering how much it was part of the first two seasons, that's a real departure.  But the pace of this adventure is such that there really was not time for such things.  Except for the RESULTS of sex, I mean: Gwen is pregnant.  In the show, for sure, and I think very likely Eve Myles was in real life, explaining perhaps why the show is only five episodes long.

In my reviews of the past two seasons, I have given the series four stars, and said that while it is very good, I did not think it was destined to become my very favorite of TV shows.  Children of Earth is easily worth the five stars I give it: as good as the first two seasons are, this one blows them away!

It is not essential to see the first two seasons to see this series, but it would help for understanding the back story of the characters.",1330905600,,2088,4.375

It's hard to say much about it without getting into spoilers.  Like many of the first two seasons, aliens are involved.  These aliens are a bit more demanding.  There are dark secrets of the past, for Jack, for the government.  The story gets darker, and darker, and darker.  Shocking!  By the middle of the final episode, I was really wondering how they would wind it all up.  But they did, and in a satisfying and reasonably natural fashion.

One important difference is that sex is really not much part of the story this time.  Considering how much it was part of the first two seasons, that's a real departure.  But the pace of this adventure is such that there really was not time for such things.  Except for the RESULTS of sex, I mean: Gwen is pregnant (I don't think this is a spoiler, as it really does not affect the plot much).  In the show, for sure, and I think possible Eve Myles was in real life, explaining perhaps why the show is only five episodes long.

In my reviews of the past two seasons, I have given the series four stars, and said that while it is very good, I did not think it was destined to become my very favorite of TV shows.  Children of Earth is easily worth the five stars I give it: as good as the first two seasons are, this one blows them away!

It is not essential to see the first two seasons to see this series, but it would help for understanding the back story of the characters.",1330905600,,2160,4.358395989974937
3895745,4,B002BVYBJW,"This is a interesting story featuring Torchwood. It has three of the main characters of the series in it. Well four counting one characters Husband. I enjoyed this show and I disagree that this is a one star series. It's just different than torchwood used to be. And Miracle day is even more different but I liked that one too.  On blu ray this looks outstanding and the acting is first rate. Sure I like the old premise better but the story still is part of torchwood and we are stuck with it. I won't go into it other than to say it concerns aliens of course and bad government people. I read that this was another project that they adapted to torchwood. Although they should have just shot another season of tw instead. Still you take what you get with british tv often. Small seasons and often short runs. ALthough some shows over there lasted many years , the bill just ended after at 28 yars or so. I would say that if you can let go of the past series then you will find this at least interesting and the effects are top notch as well. However this is the most depressing Torchwood series  yet. There's little humor in this one and it never lets up in a overall doomed feeling. The blu ray looks fine though , it's high priced though for five episodes.",1328140800,,1259,4.30801687763713
3895746,5,B002BVYBJW,"I love Doctor Who. It's characters and plots are interesting, emotionally developed, and are just an overall masterpiece. But the one fault of Doctor Who is that it is inherently a children's program. Darker themes and plot points can only be grazed, leaving out some possibly fantastic material.

So when I heard about Torchwood, I was ecstatic. I tuned in to the first season to find it... Disappointing. It was simply Doctor Who, with all of the great characterization replaced with ridiculous ""darker"" material (an alien that consumes orgasmic energy? REALLY?). But it was a tie-in to one of my favorite shows, so I had to catch season 2, didn't I?

Which was better. Not much, but better. It got me intrigued in the characters enough for me to care when tragedy befell them. And now I was interested in watching season 3, to see if it improved further.

I wasn't prepared for Children of Earth.

This season goes into TRULY dark territory, never before explored in the Doctor Who canon. I would go so far as to say that isn't only the best season of Torchwood, but indeed the best story arc in the history of a show that's been running since the 1960s. The main conflict isn't the alien menace that is the 456. It is the human condition. It puts forth a choice for humanity that is beyond our current capability to decide. And people react accordingly, as real people would, trying to reason, and think their way out. When that fails, they try to rationalize the necessary decision, and people with completely understandable reasons and morals commit acts that can be seen as truly evil.

Fantastic acting, directing, and especially writing. As a long-time fanatic of Doctor Who, I highly recommend this season to any fan of the series with an eager mind to delve into darker territory. Into a story with real people making realistic decisions with real consequences.

If you go into this expecting a masterpiece, you will still be surprised by the quality. Dear lord, this is the greatest story arc in the history of that little blue box.",1325721600,,2044,4.727528089887641
3895747,5,B002BVYBJW,"I've always liked Captain Jack, ever since his debut on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who/dp/B003M5YHEA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who</a>, and the premise for this show seemed exciting enough. Yet it never seemed to catch fire. The earlier seasons were decent enough and were populated with terrific actors, but they never found a story that worked for them.

Then the show was booted to another channel, and given a reduced number of episodes. It was a real boot in the face to the show, and most programs would have crumpled. Instead, ""Torchwood"" turned lemons into the best damned lemonade you've ever tasted.

This season is good. It's damned good. It's funny, it's exciting, but above all, it's dark. Really dark. Like scary, depressing, haunts you for weeks after you've seen it dark.

The premise is that aliens known as the 456 (because of the frequency they use with which to communicate) have come to Earth. Or rather, come *back*. They've been here once before, we learn, and things did not go well then.

So now they're coming back, and they have demands. Demands which test the very moral fabric of our society. Giving in to these demands would turn us into monsters; NOT giving into these demands would turn us into corpses.

What to do?

Terrific, terrific drama. Every character hits his stride.

I simply can not recommend this enough. But I do warn you it's DARK with a capital D, a capital A, a capital R, and a capital K. And add some exclamation points at the end for good measure. As such, while they're nothing explicitly violent or sexual, it WILL affect you emotionally.

Sadly, after this season, the BBC partnered with the US to produce ""Torchwood: Miracle Day"", which, while better than most American television these days, fell far short of the mark of this terrific season.

Oh, in case you haven't seen the previous seasons and want to jump in with this season, here's all you need to know:

Torchwood: A quasi-secret organization&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/created-by-Queen-Victoria/dp/B003NQ5V0M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">created by Queen Victoria</a>&nbsp;to understand and combat extraterrestrial menaces.

Gwen Cooper: Our viewpoint character. Former police officer, brought into Torchwood. Married to Rhys.

Captain Jark Harkness: Former time-traveller from the future, but stuck in the present now. Head of Torchwood. For reasons that are hard to explain briefly, is immortal: he can be killed, but he always comes back to life. He's lived a long, long life, and has died many, many times. He is omni-sexual: he will flirt with, and have sex with, anything sentient: man, woman, Sontarran, whatever. However, right now, he's in a committed relationship with Ianto Jones.

Ianto Jones: Stolid, wry, dedicated. He's the backbone of Torchwood; the guy who makes all the little details come together. Suit and tie. Up until now, completely heterosexual, but Captain Jack has entranced him and now they're in a committed relationship: something that Ianto finds both wonderful and uncomfortable.

That's it. That's all you need to know coming into this amazing season. Don't miss it!",1320883200,4,3225,5.43687374749499
3895748,1,B002BVYBJW,"Children of the earth is a rather surprising and undeserving end to a great series that was much more adult friendly than the series it had spun off from. Torchwood is an anagram for ""doctor who"". However, unlike ""the doctor"" the main protagonist is a firm believer in achieving results through violence. This had provided a new dimension for both the writers and viewers and was very successful until the second season when all but 2 of the cast members were killed off.

I guess the character was becoming too popular and the writers just wanted to make everyone hate him so they came up with this story. Children of the earth has too many plot holes to count, the story is contrived and main twists can be seen from a mile away. It really was a very unfitting end to a great series. They should have just killed the series with season 2, it would have been much better if they had.

Those that have sat through season 4 (or the 2nd mini series after season 2) would agree that the series was better off dead with season 2.",1317081600,,1025,4.389473684210526
3895749,4,B002BVYBJW,"I had avoided this series for a long time because I had read on Amazon about how bad it was but I have to respectfully disagree.  I have always loved Doctor Who new and old but I never much cared for the first two seasons of Torchwood John Barrowman was great as Captain Jack and rest of the team was fine but I never got the sense that the show ever evolved beyond a ""Villain of the Week"" scenario.  Torchwood never fought anything that you felt could have a massive impact on the lives of the team.  I had to reevaluate this feeling in light of the season 2 finale but for the vast majority of two seasons the good guys always.

Now Children of Earth blew any preconceived notions I had right out of the water.  The idea of the team facing one threat for a period of time shorter then the length of a week works.  From the very beginning you have an idea that the team is in real danger and when you are expecting them all to make it out safe with the use of an appropriate established plot device that has appeared in the past it doesn't happen and there are casualties.  This is one of the reasons that I think many people had a hard time with this series but I think the knowledge that certain characters aren't immortal (except for Jack) adds to the impact.

So you have Drama on a Torchwood show that works and chemistry of the cast that fires on all cylinders and villains that are effective and pose a serious threat.  I cannot say enough good things about the 456 they are chilling and I would have liked there role to have been expanded.

I do have to say something negative and will try  as nonspecific as I can there are two people that were added to the show that serve as an easy exit.  We had know knowledge of these people previously and once we are aware of why the 456 came to earth and what they want the children for the fateof one character is a forgone conclusion.  I think it would have been more effective for this young character to have been introduced in the second season and inserted into the background.  It would have been a difficult proposition between fighting monsters and running Torchwood Jack doesn't have much of a home life but it would have been more effective emotionally then using the character in a Deus Ex. setup.

Overall-In spite of some flaws Torchwood finally hit its stride with this season or ""serise"" as our British cousins would say.  The way the British Government is protrayed is excellent first secure immunity for your own family and then use the military and police that you control to do the dirty work of an invading force.  Whatever else you can say about the series I think it was amazing that the human race was on its own this time no man in a magic blue box came to save the day.",1316390400,,2746,4.300970873786408

Wonderful writing and amazing acting that will keep you at the edge of your seat and wanting to watch them all in one go.

Tip #2: Have Kleenex ready! I thought the performances here were excellent, and this series tugs at your heartstrings, as well as keeps your heart thumping like a drum solo. Jack, Ianto, Rhys, and Gwen's characters show a range of emotions and actions (some of which are heartbreaking).

Tip #3: Some of this is disturbing to watch, and a good part of it involves children in peril. I would not recommend this for those under about 14 or 15. None of the scenes with the children are graphic, but might scare younger children.

Tip #4: There are a few graphic scenes, particularly involving Jack and his unique ""ability"", which were harrowing for this reviewer.  (good sci-fi does that, though)

3895757,1,B002BVYBJW,"Torchwood:  Children of Earth is one of the most vile excuses for TV drama in recent memory.  It was bad enough RTD killed off Owen and Tosh (which was a very moving episode of Series Two), but then he decides to change all of the characters personalities, and kill off a fan favorite, just as we were starting to learn a little more of his background.

The show's ""climax"" includes the murder of an innocent child, and if this is considered entertainment, then there is something really wrong with the world today.  I really can not tolerate it when harming a child is used for entertainment purposes.  I actually have no interest in Torchwood any longer due to the cold, mean spirited portrayal of the lead character, Jack.  His actions in the climax are supposed to show more of an inner conflict within the lead character, sending him further over the edge...yeah, whatever.  Could have been handled differently.

I won't even go into the demeaning way homosexuals are referred to, and the major plot holes.  The final two episodes were lazily written with the intent of shock value rather than an ingenious and creative resolution.

Did I fail to mention a father killing his entire family (2 daughters, his wife, then himself), which, come to find out, was for no reason...again, lazy writing for sake of a ""shock"".

I agree with another reviewer, I always believed that Movies and TV shows were a means of escaping the depressing reality of the real world for an hour or so...I guess I was wrong. Also, why care about any characters when they will be killed at the drop of a hat (at least the interesting ones).  This is now what is considered entertainment.

Torchwood:  Miracle Day is now showing on Starz, and I have no interest in seeing it.  Word of mouth says they have now included somewhat explicit sex scenes, and Jack going into a gay bar to ""hook-up"".  So much for never forgetting Ianto.  Again, lazy writing and using shock value to attract viewers.  RTD can be as demeaning to the die-hard fans as he wants, for me, the series ended with Series Two.  I can't even stand to watch the lead character (Jack) any longer...

As exciting and dark as the second season is the third is only more so. This show is not afraid to tarnish its heroes, to present badly broken people as the unlikely defenders of an oblivious human populace, these heroes are afraid, they hurt, they bleed, they make awful choices in the face of awful odds and while, in the end, they triumph they also -like most humans- suffer horribly for it.

3895763,5,B002BVYBJW,"Torchwood: Children of Earth, is the proof that Russell T. Davies, finally can write his own work and not be derivative.  True, Torchwood is technically a ""Spin-Off"" of ""Doctor Who""... but with this mini-series event, he has proven that he can write a story that can show the true human spirit with the minimum of ""gimmicks"".  True there was an ""Alien"" in this series.  There were characters that were introduced to us in ""Doctor Who"" and on the first two seasons of ""Torchwood"", but this moves away from the ""monster of the week"" sort of show that the first two seasons of ""Torchwood"" on BBC became (a poor attempt at an ""adult program for fans of Doctor Who"").  This instead was pure high quality adult science fiction, that shows the human failings, without having to use ""aliens and special effects"" for a ""crutch"".  We can see how our governments are all too ready to ""give in"" what is of most value, when we are put against ""overwhelming odds"".  We can see where sacrifice can be too high of a price, when it is something we most value.  Numbers are irrelevant, when it comes to what we hold most dear.  What price is too high to ""save our skins"" from what may be seen as ""total destruction"".  During World War I and World War II, especially, we saw how we had a choice to either allow a strong enemy overwhelm us... or we could fight and not surrender for the values that mean the most to us.

This again is not the ""monster of the week"".  It does not have some ""space alien"" from Galifrey, coming to save our poor defenseless human behinds because we are so weak that we can not do anything for ourselves.  We can see where our worst enemy at times is ourselves, and it takes the courage of the average human being to FIGHT FOR SURVIVAL.  Even if it means that we might lose everything.  In World War I and in World War II, our fathers gave EVERYTHING in order to give this world safety and peace, even if it meant their own lives.  In more recent moments of war, our brothers have given EVERYTHING to give this world some safety and peace in this world of terrorism, where we do not have a clearly defined enemy on a map.  If anything, the wars we see in our world today are more a fight against ""aliens"" than any wars we have had in the past.

Are we willing to give up our souls, just for the chance of having a few more days to breathe on this planet?  Or are we willing to fight the good fight, even if it means we can have a chance to lose anything.

I have read many reviews on this particular mini-series, and on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Torchwood-The-Complete-Original-UK-Series/dp/B0050UEVJ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Torchwood: The Complete Original UK Series</a>&nbsp;which includes this mini-series complain about it.  About its strong ""American Influences"" (and that of the new Starz US Version of Torchwood... ""Torchwood: Miracle Day"").  But those who complain must be the British who are trying to compare the ORIGINAL ""Doctor Who"" with the ""Russell T. Davies Doctor Who"" which is a very Welsh production and especially ""Torchwood"" while technically a ""spin-off"" of the ""Russell T. Davies Doctor Who"" (but not really a spin-off of the ORIGINAL ""Doctor Who"")... and realize that this is a very well made Welsh drama series, that is trying to still feed those who love the classic Science Fiction of someone of the quality of a C.S. Lewis, H.G. Welles, Ray Bradbury, or Issac Asimov... which are ""less monsters"" and more ""science"" in their ""fiction""... then you might be able to see the difference.

""Torchwood"" was never meant to be aimed at the ""Doctor Who"" demographic, for the ""very young to the very old"".  ""Torchwood"", deals with a lot more ""adult issues"" that are more typical of the previous work of Russell T. Davies.  If anything ""Doctor Who"" is the ONE SERIES that does not really fit in the resume of Russell T. Davies, who is mostly a writer and producer of adult orientated programing (not talking pornography here by any means, I am talking about adult issues including more ""regular violence"" than ""fantasy violence"", more ""sexuality"" than is normal for ""prime time programming"", things that would not ""float"" on Network Television in the United States).  On the BBC, much more profanity and sexuality is ""okay"" for a ""prime time audience"" (being allowed on the publicly paid for via television receiver license fees channels of the British Broadcasting Network, with minimal complaints on Ofcom in the UK which handles the FCC type complaints we have in the US).  Here in the US, such programming would not be allowed on ""Over the Air"" broadcasts during ""prime time"" due to the very ""Adult Nature"" of even Seasons 1 and 2 of ""Torchwood"" (and ""Doctor Who"" is still a ""Kiddie Show"" compared to ""Torchwood"" even under the control of Mr. Davies).

So if you have been a fan of the work of Russell T. Davies, between 1994 and 2004 (after he first started in television in ""children's programming"" moved into ""Adult Programming"" for that decade, then even with his ""coming out of the closet"" in such a BIG WAY (as his adult programming shows), being allowed by the BBC to take over their ""Gold Standard"" franchise of ""Doctor Who""... then you should have known what to expect.  He moved out of the ""day to day"" operations of ""Doctor Who"" because he wanted to go back into more ""Adult Orientated Drama"" (designed for a demographic of those who have graduated high school and beyond), which he has done with ""Torchwood"".  With this mini-series he finally fine tuned what he needed to do to create great adult science fiction (without needing a ""blue box"", a ""sonic screwdriver"", an ""alien of the week"", or even with an ""alien"" being the ""main star"").  Unlike ""Doctor Who"" who has a ""lead character"" in ""The Doctor"", ""Torchwood"" had always been an ensemble cast, that has made it such a strong drama.  It took a couple of years for it to fully ""break off"" from the ""crutch"" of ""Doctor Who""... but now it is becoming a great drama.

If you want to blame how ""bad"" this mini-series is, or praise how ""good"" this mini series is... you must lie it entirely at the FEET of Russell T. Davies.  After all he is the one who CREATED ""Torchwood"", and ""Torchwood: Children of Earth"" was ENTIRELY HIS STORY, and he shares the writing credits on the scripts for the mini-series, but the story is entirely his.  From the first word to the closing line.  So if you do not like how ""Torchwood"" had advanced, the blame goes squarely on its creator and main writer.  After all, it is a Welsh drama series created by a Welshman for an adult audience.",1310428800,3,6615,4.696969696969697

This makes sense, I guess, since I thought the first two seasons of Torchwood were ridiculous and generally awful. Lots of potential, but it was often squandered in favor of 'adult' themes that would only seem adult to teenagers. In other words, lots of sex and swearing for no other reason than that's apparently what the writers thought 'adult' meant.

That all changed with Children of Earth. The show has never had the focus and clarity that it shows here. Sure, the story does sag a bit in the middle, but overall it's such a massive improvement over what came before that you don't really notice. Captain Jack becomes an actual person, instead of an idea, and Gwen is rightfully moved front-and-center. The aliens are sufficiently creepy and unsettling, though in the end we're left wondering if they're any worse than the humans opposing them.

John Barrowman is just amazing.  I hadn't really seen him before except for clips of him in musicals in the West End, so seeing him on TV was different...but great.

I was shocked at the events that happened at the end of season two, but I never prepared myself for Children of Earth.  I thought at first is was just going to be the team trying to rebuild itself after what had happened.  COE is almost like a completely different series; I'm told that season three was basically a mini-series, not an actual season.  I am looking forward to seeing what they are planning for the fourth season.  All I know is that it's not going to be shown on BBC America (not at first anyway), but on STARZ instead.

3895767,5,B002BVYBJW,"I was never a 'Doctor Who' fan, but I stumbled across 'Torchwood' and enjoyed the series' darker, character-driven stories.  But the first two seasons (even with the catastrophic events of the end of season two) in no way prepared me for 'Children of Earth'.

This wasn't simply dark, this was jet black.  The world faces a crisis of biblical proportions and the characters of 'Torchwood' have to rise to the occasion despite failure, betrayal, and some of the most wrenching sacrifices in televised science fiction.  The losses are personal, and the costs of saving the human race from its own weakness (as great a threat as any alien war) are shattering.

Captain Jack is, as always, presented as the central figure here, but in the end it is the character of Gwen that gives the story its heart, and Eve Myles lends her portrayal a vivid intensity that carries each of these five episodes.  The other actors, including those playing newly introduced characters, do yeoman's work and make the entire series sing.

While I won't be providing a synopsis of the plot in this review, I will say that it was very refreshing to see a British story demonstrating how government and politics are inherently dangerous when very personal decisions become fodder for the state.  This may strike many viewers of 'Torchwood' as blasphemous, given the liberal tendencies of its viewership, but 'Children of Earth' is as positive a portrayal of conservative principles as I've seen come out of the BBC - ever.  Watching the families in Wales defend themselves and their children from the very people whose self-righteousness put them in danger in the first place was a moment to cheer.

I understand that a new ten episode series of 'Torchwood' will be airing this summer.  If it approaches the quality of 'Children of Earth', it will be some of the best television on the air.",1306540800,3,1864,4.848580441640379

After watching it, I can honestly say I loved it. Here's what you have to know going in. It's darker than the darkest shows you've seen in the first 2 seasons and it effectively kills the show. But what a way to go.

I thought about Children Of Earth for weeks after watching it, it's that powerful. There are some lapses in logic for sure, but that was always the case with Torchwood. Come on people, the second season opened with a fish driving a car, for God's sake!

All I can say is, if you enjoyed the darker episodes of the show and the emotional anguish the characters went through in them, I think you will like this.",1305676800,2,894,4.341317365269461

Some of the subplots are a bit gratuitous, but overall, it's a good premise. It doesn't have some of the ""cheesy"" Doctor Who elements that make the show difficult to take too seriously.

I saw ""Children of Earth"" on BBC America, and enjoyed it enough to watch again on Amazon. The overall premise is intriguing, and the momentum is sustained throughout the 5 episodes, even if some of the loose ends are resolved a bit too quickly . . .",1298505600,3,537,4.59375

At the vaguest, general level (which is really all I can do before the spoiler tag), it's what you've come to expect from Torchwood...but Torchwood will never be the same.

NON-SPECIFIC GENERAL AND VAGUE SPOILERS BELOW (no plot elements will be discussed, but still, if you want to see this series with no notions of how it turns out, avoid the following discussion...it will discuss the tone and ""mood"" of the series)

SERIOUSLY, TURN BACK NOW IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS AND WANT TO APPROACH IT FROM A PURELY FRESH PERSPECTIVE

Most of the one-star reviews seem to focus on the fact that they didn't like how this series ended. And yet, that's the beauty of it. The ending is dark and emotionally disturbing. You need only ask yourself, how often do you end up replaying happy endings in your mind for days on end? That's the point of it all...this series will make you question yourself, your values, your capacity for forgiveness. What makes a hero? What makes a monster? If you're prepared to grapple with these issues (even if no easy conclusion is available) then this may be for you.",1297382400,4,1266,4.719457013574661
3895775,1,B002BVYBJW,"I've been a fan of the first two seasons of Torchwood and was very excited for the third season.
After all the promises RTD and JB made in the press for series three I had high hopes for the 5-episodes mini-Torchwood.
--------------------SPOILERS----------------------------------

I've watched it live when it aired and although the first two episodes left something to be desired I still kept on watching because it was supposed to be my beloved Torchwood and maybe they could turn it around? Maybe the charactes could finally start acting like themeselves on day three? Maybe Jack could take back command from Gwen who all of a sudden kept calling all the shots?

Let's just say day three did not turn out any better than one and two, but still nothing could prepare me for what was still to come over the last two episodes.
RTD had already destroyed the Hub in Cardiff, got the SUV stolen and made Jack a background character in his own show and, on the last two days, he set out to kill my favorite character Ianto Jones, destroy Jack Harkness beyond repair and lift Gwen to everlasting Mary-Sue status.

And while after day four I cried for Ianto (which I haven't done in at least 10 years for any charcter on a tv show or in a movie) I still had hope they would somehow fix it, since it was the same Torchwood that just killed off Owen and Tosh five episodes earlier and had only 3 real regulars left. Day five though only showed RTD and the other writers kicking their already down fans some more.

Immediatley after series three I would have accepted any deus-ex-machina plot device to fix the Torchwood universe, just to get back to the happy days of series one and two, but unfortunatly when confronted with critisism RTD decided to make fun of people who didn't like the dark path CoE went down and called him out on his plot holes. Over weeks he insulted fans of the previous season and with all his statements and interviews helped me decide not to watch any other show he is involved in. Characters are just plot devices, he doesn't build them up so you enjoy the stories, but rather to make you suffer their death and call it great entertainment.

Even though series one and two may not have won any prizes for their believable storylines at least they were fun to watch over and over again. With CoE I regret viewing it once, it has destroyed a great show beyond repair for me.

If you liked Torchwood from season one and two, STAY AWAY from Children of Earth. It destroys everything you have been told about Torchwood and the Who-Universe for the sake of making you feel hollow and alone. If you are looking for a good science fiction show opt for Stargate, Farscape or Firefly, but don't spend your mony on this gore-fest with more holes than plot.",1296518400,10,2767,4.546184738955823

3895778,5,B002BVYBJW,"Just as Torchwood is itself a branch of the Dr. Who series the third season of Torchwood, (which is in reality a five night miniseries), is itself a branch of Torchwood called collectively ""Children of the Earth"". The silliness is dropped and what you have is no less than what the fourth series installment of Quatermass,(1972), should've been.

Nigel Kneale, who adapted George Orwell's 1984 for the radio in the early 1950s went to BBC television and created the character of Bernard Quatermass for three television series each of six one-hour installments. You may not know it, but these not only invented science fiction for British TV and film, but they are the source for much science fiction to come. You probably have seen one of the Hammer films made from these three series. Most famous is ""Quatermass and the Pit"" released in the United States as ""5 million years to Earth"".

More pertinent here is the 1984 theme of his second TV series called ""Quatermass II"", called ""Enemy From Space"" in the US. Here we have the theme of the government being taken over by an agenda at odds with the freedom and prosperity of the people that live under it. This is why consider ""Children of the Earth"" to be the suitable successor to the political and ethical questions coming out of the book 1984 as being thought through by the Socialist critique of the Quatermass universe.

There are several plot conceits that don't really work at all in the action surrounding the central core of the movie in London. One escape scene seen something like you would see in Mission impossible but it passes quickly. The acting level and the script of what goes on in the inner circles of London politics is like the very best of the socially aware movies of the 1970s, (""All the President's Men"") or British drama, (the John le Carr espionage adaptations like 'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"").

This is a film ALL Neo-Liberal Governments would rather you don't see.",1285718400,6,1950,4.760355029585799
3895779,1,B002BVYBJW,"I am new to the Torchwood series and have just recently watched all the episodes.  The first two seasons were incredible--great cast, witty writing, just enough camp to be fun.  I fell in love with the show, all the way up until they started killing off main characters in season 2.  Now, when you have a cast that is perfect together, I don't see why you would kill any of them off.  Think of what ""House"" would be if they just decided to have Cuddy and Wilson die.  Season 3 is completely different from the other 2 seasons, mainly in tone.  Season 3 is dark and the characters are nothing like you remember them from the past 2 seasons.  It feels like someone wrote a dark sci-fi drama and then just shoe horned the characters and settings from Torchwood into it.  I recommend watching the first 2 series (although don't watch series 2 through the end if you want to remember the cast all together) as the episodes are great.  Season 3 is not for you if you like the first 2 seasons.",1283817600,8,986,4.344262295081967
3895780,4,B002BVYBJW,"The more that I looked at Series 2 of ""Torchwood"", the more I had a suspicion...that Russell T. Davies and Julie Gardner weren't happy with the personnel mix that they had.  This isn't a put-down to Nakano Mori, Burn Gorman, and especially Gareth Lloyd-Davies...but in rewatching Series 2, I just suspected that the two showrunners weren't happy with something the way the story flowed in the second series--which led to the deaths of Owen Harper and Toshiko Sato at the end of Series Two, and the controversial ending of the Ianto Jones storyline in ""Children Of Earth"".
  Still, this is NOT a bad story; in many ways it is very consistent with the darker and more viseral tone--as I call it, ""The Broken Reflection of the Whoniverse""--that the series had maintained since its beginning.  It opens up a few surprises--with John Barrowman's Jack Harkness not just being a father, but a grandfather; but also a deal that Captain Jack brokered in the 1960s coming back to haunt him...and the planet.  The explanation of the 456, and what they want with 10% of the Earth's children...is harrowing.  Of course, the story gets complicated by Jack, Gwen Cooper and Ianto (As well as Rhys Williams, Gwen's husband) becoming outlaws to the British Home Office.  Our three main leads--Barrowman, Eve Myles, and Lloyd-Davies--are in fine form as the team working to save the planet in a situation where some within the British government seem more determined to appease rather than combat.  Which leaves an undermanned Torchwood to the fight...and certainly not an easy fight, given what the final victory over the 456 costs Harkness.
  Barrowman, Eve Myles, Lloyd-Davies and Kai Owen are all in a good place, with Owen giving Rhys Williams a little more life and the ability to think on his feet.  Lucy Cohu's Alice Carter--Harkness' daughter--and Bear McCausland--Jack's grandson--are interesting introductions...and given how the storyline played out--and the nature of the Whoniverse--we can't clearly say that the ending we saw WAS THE END...Liz May Brice's Agent Johnson was also an interesting introduction that might be recurring when ""Torchwood"" gets back on screen in 2011...
  But overall, the whole of this story--while being very good--still has the feel of Davies and Gardner reworking the team toward possibly becoming the home for people who have had dealings with The Doctor.  Which isn't necessarily a bad thing--Whovians are comfortable with Freema Agyeman's Martha Smith-Jones (If ""Law And Order:UK"" doesn't work out) and Noel Clarke's Mickey Smith...and Torchwood could use a secretarial-type...do I hear a vote for a certain loud and brassy redhead with some memory issues...like a Donna Noble?
  Time will tell where Russell and Julie will take Torchwood at the beginning of next year.  In the meantime, enjoy this rough and slightly dark ride.",1283299200,5,2857,5.14935064935065
3895781,5,B002BVYBJW,"Wow!  I just finished watching Children of Earth for the first time, and I loved it!  Now, I'm not the biggest Torchwood fan.  The first season was bumpy at best, but had some decent moments and good character development.  The second season was overall pretty bad and had some of the most insipid, ridiculous plots I've ever seen on a televised science fiction show (truly absurd, thinly premised, sometimes missing premise entirely...).  I almost -- almost -- gave up, but a friend convinced me that Children of Earth redeemed the mediocrity of the second season.

He was right!  The story telling is tight and fast, like a Jerry Brukheimer flick, and the handful of minor holes are 1) quite an improvement for this show and 2) easily ignored.  The ending is not as satisfying as it might have been, but one of the best qualities that Russell T. Davies brought to this show was his willingness to ""break a few eggs"" to tell a good story.  He did it here.  Job well, done.  I'm excited that a US adaptation/extension is in the works!",1282867200,6,1034,4.595628415300546
3895782,5,B002BVYBJW,"I'm a fan of Torchwood; all three seasons thus far have met and exceeded my expectations (with the token fluke episodes, of course). Children of Earth is one of the best miniseries I've seen in a while, and much better than a lot of full-season shows.

While I dislike the clunky-plastic grip plug that keeps the dvds in pace inside their packaging (mine a least has a bit of a deathgrip on the dvd - good for holding it in place during shipping, bad when you actually want to watch your movie), I wouldn't go so far as to say that they ruined the experience.

I will probably be watching this in a few days with some friends before I move. Here's hoping they like it as much as I do.

About the actual series:

Children of Earth is a pseudo-philosophical ""thriller"" (I don't even know if that's what it is, but it's something like that). The antagonist in the series is one of the best portrayals of non-human life I've seen, and the level of ambiguity that surrounds its origins, motives, and abilities is something of intrigue (at least to me).
Some parts are quite tragic, and others quite disturbing. Torchwood continues to play with the possibilities surrounding Jack, seeing as he is immortal (Jack's immortality is relevant to both the tragedy and disturbing elements).
While the philosophical content of the series is not uncharted territory, it is somewhat interesting to think about moral choices and such with the film as a base. Not going as far as to say that it's a philosophic dynamo, but it does raise some interesting questions.
Some of the series comes across as cheesy though, the BBC has yet to find a way to deliver their content without accompanying it with some (presumably) unintentional humor. One example that comes to mind: The ""splat"" sounds made by the alien. They are childish, and somewhat comedic.

As it is presented as ""Not Rated,"" I would say that this series is not for children, and neither are the other Torchwood series.",1282608000,4,1960,4.6695652173913045

3895785,5,B002BVYBJW,"I only recently made the decision to catch up on the new Doctor Who and its spin off Torchwood.  It has been quite an experience to say the least.  Neither show is particularly consistent, both of them having some really weak moments and some absolutely extraordinary ones.  Each show can at its worst be banal and more than a little dull.  Each can descend into boring chat.  But at their best they can both be amazing.  I was absolutely blown away by the two amazing Doctor Who episodes ""Blink"" and ""Midnight,"" which represents TV at its best.  And I was simply flabbergasted at how astonishing how exciting and fresh this show was.  And so dark!  The only good SF show I know that has gone as dark as Children of Earth is BSG. But there we were talking about an earthlike civilization, not earth itself.  The conceit of the governments of earth doing the things contained in this miniseries (which is essentially what it is) is a gut wrenching one.

If you have heard good things about this TV event (and if you love great TV just ignore the negative reviews here -- a huge number of church groups target this show because the lead character is gay, so a lot of those giving it negative reviews have an agenda) do yourself a favor and see it.  Now!  Don't bother to see Seasons One and Two.  They aren't necessary.  I'll give you here all you need to know.  Torchwood is a secret organization in Great Britain outside government control that was founded by Queen Victoria after she encountered the Doctor (as in Doctor Who).  Terrified of the presence of alien life in the universe, she wanted England to be prepared to fight back.  Contemporary Torchwood is headed by Captain Jack Harkness, who is a former 51st century Time Agent who (in events covered in an episode of Doctor Who -- Jack was briefly a traveling companion of the Doctor, and has appeared on the show several times as a guest star) has lost the ability to die.  Like Wolverine in the X-Men, he can heal from any wound, regardless of how extreme it is.  And that is really all you need to know.  Obviously, knowing the previous two seasons and Doctor Who would help, but it isn't necessary.  Just dive in!  But you will definitely want to go back and catch up on both shows.

I don't really want to go into details because I really think that Children of Earth should be seen with the viewer knowing as little as possible.  But I promise you that you will be astonished.

If you are homophobic, do yourself a favor and skip the show.  As I mentioned above, Captain Jack Harkness has relationships with men (and women).

When this series ended, the future of Torchwood was uncertain.  Although Children of Earth was a miniseries, some have counted it as technically being Season Three.  There had been no announcement for a Season Four.  But in the past couple of weeks it has been announced that Russell T. Davies (the creator of Torchwood and the man responsible for relaunching Doctor Who) had agreed to do a joint venture with Starz that will bring Captain Jack and Gwen back to protecting the world from alien invasions.  It isn't clear yet where it will be set (Torchwood was set previously in Cardiff because of a supposed time rift there, which made it a lure for alien activity, a feature I strongly suspect was borrowed from the Hellmouth in Sunnydale luring vampires and demons there on BUFFY).  There will be new cast members and a more international tone to the show.  But for me the great news is that this will not be the end of Torchwood.",1276732800,6,3523,4.530903328050713

3895787,5,B002BVYBJW,"Children of Earth is the third, and what appears to the final, season of Torchwood.  It consists of a five-part miniseries which details the return of a very strange alien species to Earth.  These aliens are known only as the 456, which is pronounced four, five, six.  This is apparently the frequency that they used for communication.  The 456 are one of the most ""alien"" of alien species portrayed in a TV series.  The three members of Torchwood who survived the end of the second season are pitted against not only these aliens, but portions of the government whom are trying to cover up the circumstances of the previous visit of the 456 to the Earth.  A great ending for the Torchwood series!",1275523200,3,697,4.626016260162602
3895788,5,B002BVYBJW,"""Torchwood"" has, through two series, been a show that never lived up to its enormous potential. They had a lot of great ideas, some fascinating characters and cool plots, but ultimately almost every episode came crashing down under its own weight. The series always felt like it was only ""Doctor Who"" with extra swears added in. It never felt like its own show and it never amounted to anything.

Then along came ""Children of Earth"".

This series of episodes tells the story of a group of aliens, known only as the 456, who show up and make a rather unpleasant demand of humanity. They communicate by making every child freeze in place and simultaneously recite ""We are coming. We are coming."" It's an unnerving effect. Torchwood in general, and Capt Jack in particular, are being hunted down by the government, which is itself scrambling to figure out how to deal with this situation. By the end of the story many things have changed, and no matter what happens henceforth, the series will never be the same again.

What a stunning accomplishment this is, especially since it was written by Russel T Davies, a man whose output on ""Doctor Who"" has been somewhat uneven, to put it mildly. He managed a couple really stunning episodes there (notably ""Midnight"" from the show's fourth series), but most of his stories were dragged down by a lack of focus, stupid sex and fart jokes and characters acting like idiots. He carried that over to ""Torchwood"" initially but has really managed to get past that here. He's someone whose writing I generally dislike, and while I really loved the writing with ""Children of Earth"", it also annoyed me greatly, because it shows what RTD is capable of when he tries.

Everything about this story works completely from start to finish. At no point did anything feel forced or done simply for effect. The characters are firing on all cylinders, the supporting cast (notably Peter Capaldi, in one of the best, most layered TV performances I've ever seen), are perfect with characters who are well-written and three dimensional, and, almost surprisingly, the series manages to convey a real sense of fear and dread as it goes on. I can only imagine how much it must've sucked to watch this over a course of three nights and have to wait 23 hours each night to find out what happened next. It makes waiting three months to see what happened to Picard at the end of ""The Best of Both Worlds"" seem like a walk in the park.

There is one minor problem, and that's not with the show, but with the Blu-ray release of it. There's no real extra features other than a bit of ""Torchwood: Declassified"", which is essentially the same as ""Doctor Who: Confidential"". It's a behind-the-scenes show and quite interesting, and I'm glad it's here. But I miss having things like commentaries, deleted scenes and the like. For a series that's been so good about packing DVDs and Blu-rays full of everything and the kitchen sink, that's a bit of a letdown.

It's also a very minor complaint. This is an amazing piece of work, and even if you've never seen ""Torchwood"" or ""Doctor Who"" I recommend picking it up. You likely won't be lost and you'll likely want to watch it with your eyes closed.",1274227200,9,3202,4.6886120996441285
3895789,3,B002BVYBJW,"""Torchwood"" is a series which has never fulfilled the promise of the ""adult science fiction drama"" originally expounded by creator Russell T. Davies.

It became apparent after it's premiere that Davies had eschewed thoughtful intelligent drama in favour of sub-par ""Doctor Who"" plots sensationalised with a patina of soap opera, gore and sexual polemicising. I watched the entire first series when it was originally broadcast with a growing sense of despair, caught some episodes of the second series and still saw nothing that caused me to revise my initial opinion of what was essentially a very moribund Joss Whedon imitation.

I was quite content to never set eyes on the series again until a few trusted sources recommended that I take a look at it's latest incarnation.

""Children Of Earth"" is frustrating because it shows us the promise of what the show could have been. The first two parts of this five part drama, yet again, sees RTD exhibit his Magpie tendencies as he serves up a story which sees the remainder of the team turn fugitive in the face of a government conspiracy and the appearance of a mysterious alien species known as ""The 456""; it really is ridiculous, badly written, nonsensical padding of the worst kind which owes a considerable debt to the likes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/24-Seasons-1-7/dp/B0027CSMWM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">24: Seasons 1-7</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quatermass-1979/dp/B0007TKNOM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quatermass (1979)</a>&nbsp;whilst exhibiting neither the excitement or intelligence of either of those shows. I must admit, I nearly switched off at this point.

However, parts three and four are where the series really shines.

In many ways, I found myself wishing that these portions of the show had actually been written as a stand-alone drama which examined how a contemporary sitting government would react to a 'first-contact' situation.

Unfortunately, RTD destroys the intelligence quotient of the drama just as quickly as he ramps it up by resorting to the usual sub-par Whedonesque gimmickry, soap opera and ham-fisted grandstanding. The ending is both deeply predictable and wholly unsatisfying and its all a bit too smugly self-satisfied and 'deus-ex-machina' for it's own good. That and everyone insists on doing a very silly scissor-hand style of run throughout the whole thing.

The first two series of ""Torchwood"" never lived up to their potential. ""Children Of Earth"" doesn't quite manage that either - but at times it comes damned close.",1272499200,4,3416,6.016460905349795

The entertaining and sometimes quite corny British series ""Torchwood"" takes a decidedly darker turn in this third season miniseries, known as ""Torchwood: Children of Earth"".

A bizarre alien race known only as 456 demands that humanity turn over millions of children to them. Apparently, human children emit a special chemical which the aliens use as a recreational drug! It also turns out that the British government have helped the aliens abduct children in the past. To stop the truth from leaking out, home office secretary John Frobisher sends out a hit squad to kill everyone who knows about the previous alien encounter, including Torchwood leader Jack Harkness. But, as avid ""Torchwood"" fans know, Captain Jack can't die. Various ingenious ways of getting rid of him fails, and he is soon back to take on both the 456 and the officials who betrayed him.

The governments of Britain, the United States and other nations turn out to be evil, spineless or both, and agree to turn over the children to the bizarre aliens. The military promptly rounds up undesirable kids from bad neighbourhoods. The operation ends only at the last possible moment, as the hit squad that wanted Captain Jack dead suddenly turns coat and starts co-operating with Torchwood instead. Jack then forces the 456 to withdraw by turning one of the aliens' own signals against them. Unfortunately, the victory comes at a terrible price. Several of the main characters end up dead, the Torchwood Institute is in shambles, and Jack Harkness leaves Earth. The whole thing cries out for a sequel. Indeed, a fourth season of ""Torchwood"" is said to be in preparation.

""Torchwood: Children of Earth"" is one of the better science fiction dramas I've seen. Every episode has its fair share of excitement, suspense and unexpected twists. The evil Frobisher becomes a tragic hero. The spotless hero Jack turns out to have a dark past. As already mentioned, the black ops people eventually decide to co-operate with the good guys. The revelation that the 456 need the children as a narcotic is suitably disgusting.

The only problem with ""Children of Earth"" is, ironically, that it's *too* good. It doesn't fit very well with the two previous seasons of ""Torchwood"", with their curious blend of entertainment, weird depressions and bisexuality. ""Children of Earth"" is too dark, too pessimistic and just too serious.  It's not clear how the series will develop from now on, but it will be difficult to go back to the good old days of Weewils, cannibals and giant mayflies from outer space! ""Torchwood"" started out as a ""Doctor Who"" spin off, but it seems to have ended up in a very different universe.

But perhaps that's how it should be. It will be interesting to see what the people behind this series will come up with next...",1271721600,6,2830,4.945263157894737
3895791,5,B002BVYBJW,"While I do agree with some of the more negative reviews on here, the fact remains I believe they are over reacting, particularly with the ratings. Children of Earth is very strongly written in a style that is unexpected from the fluffiness that we usually get from Russell T. Davies. That does not mean it is bad. The main conflict of the plot is rather unnerving in a creepy sort of way, mainly because it involves children and that makes a lot of people very uncomfortable very quickly. The characters are much more assertive of themselves and the show graphically looks better than it did in Series 1 and 2. This is much darker in tone, though, and pretty depressing by the end of it. Still, I really like the direction it went and in fact reminded me why I liked Torchwood so much to begin with. Doctor Who where the show comes from is targeted at being a family show, and I wanted something more adult. Children of Earth is a poignant and dramatic reminder that the show is definitely for adults.",1271289600,4,1001,4.475409836065574

3895793,5,B002BVYBJW,"... and I watch a LOT of TV.

I've loved Torchwood's light-hearted feel since the beginning, but definitely appreciated its darker turns, too, and felt that it was a little more for mature audiences than Doctor Who, which I also love.  This series is decidedly the darkest, and it was so excellent in so many ways.

First, the story:  ok, we've seen some stories like this.  But for me, a lot of the story is in the telling - I read ""A Christmas Carol"" every year at Christmas time.  I never get tired of it.  It's not that you've heard a story before that spoils it.  It's that you don't find anything new in it - that's when the story gets tired.  And the telling of this story is gorgeous - the 456 are a terrifying race of aliens, made moreso by the fact that you don't really see them.  All you see is the violence of their responses as they flail against the glass of the shadowy, mist-filled enclosure they reside in, spewing some sort of vile cr*p all over it.  Yikes.  There is some perfect Torchwood humor to be found, despite the anguish of losing two of their members only months earlier (Torchwood time); the banter between Ianto, Gwen and Captain Jack is light and charming, and some of the scenes are quite amusing, bt the over-arching story reaches into more pithy territory when following Frobisher, the government pawn who becomes the fall guy for the Ministry.  This poor guy has chump written all over him from the beginning, because he simply does not care what humiliation he must suffer in order to advance his career.  That's a bad plan, kids, in case you didn't realize it already.

The second part of the telling is the performance:  this is a tour de force for Eve Myles and John Barrowman.  They are as solid as any actors I have ever seen, and without their complete commitment to these characters, this kind of story wouldn't be possible.  Gareth Davies was always a bit stoic, so you don't expect him to be touching, and yet, here he is, and in such a lovely and unexpected way.  The man who played Frobisher was also tremendous, and I felt in the end, his story was so tragic and so frustrating... well, you just have to watch it.

The windup is a tension-filled roller coaster ride, as you try to figure out what the 456 want.  When you finally do, the mixture of horror and revulsion is hard to contain.  The final hour, the final minutes, are some of the most wrenching I have ever seen; I was actually squirming and wincing, turning my head so as not to see, it was just that hard to watch.

SPOILER ALERT:  This paragraph contains a mild spoiler, so if you don't want to know a little something about it, don't read it.  A few days after watching this, a friend of mine ran into John Barrowman at ComiCon.  He sent me a picture with the caption ""Eat your heart out,"" because he knows how I love Captain Jack.  When I saw the jaunty smile, I literally had tears in my eyes, I was just so glad to see him looking well - he did not look so well at the end of this episode.

All in all, though hard to watch in places, this was an amazing series.  I have not been able to bring myself watch all of it through on the Blu-Ray yet, though I have checked and find the quality so much nicer than when I watched it on the broadcast!  Dammit!  lol.  It is hard to watch, but oh my God, it is so good.",1269648000,5,3326,4.28892455858748
3895794,2,B002BVYBJW,"I loved Torchwood seasons 1 and 2. However after watching this, I'm not sure I will be able to watch Torchwood again.  Like many have said before the characters are not true to their prior selves.  I also was really sad to see yet another member of the team killed off.  Then there are all the horrible events that occur in this one series.  Being a parent, I especially hated the ending.  I believe they took it way too far.  Surely there could be a better ending!  In any case, I don't think I could take watching this again.  In the end its just too depressing.",1269561600,8,564,4.254716981132075
3895795,5,B002BVYBJW,"If you're not familiar with the Torchwood series, you really need to have seen some of the episodes leading up to this point in order to truly understand ""Children of Earth.""  The Torchwood show is a spin-off from the relaunched Doctor Who series, and while watching the Doctor Who series adds depth to Torchwood, it is not completely necessary.

This third season is only 5 episodes, but that seems to be about as long as it needs to be--the story arc is neatly contained, it seldom seems to drag, and it definitely ramps up the intensity with taut writing and shocking plot twists.  If you are coming to ""Children of Earth"" fresh off the end of Season Two, chances are you're still reeling from shock.  Our story opens with important main characters already dead, and the survivors are thrust into a taut invasion story that leaves everything--including the future of the human race--in doubt.  This wild ride may run fast, but it doesn't skim the surface:  at times it runs quite deep.  One of the recurring moral themes in ""Children of Earth"" is, ""What would you do to save the world?  How far is too far?""  You find yourself wondering if there are any surefire answers, and the writers do their best to change the game on you as Children of Earth goes along, each time putting the morality in a different light and making you wonder again.

I've just finished watching this DVD set and I have to say I was floored.  It was brilliantly written, but it's also hard to take, probably most of all because you can see the events that happen actually taking place if this were a true story.  You can definitely see people behaving the way that they do, and you find yourself a bit overwhelmed at human nature.  That said, nothing else is missing from this series:  we have good costumes, fascinating sets, camera work that takes color and light into dramatic effect, and of course special effects that border on theatrical.  Story and dialogue are well played, and the DVD mastery scales decently to larger resolutions:  not eye-popping when upscaled, but neither is it muddied and badly colored.

If you're new to Torchwood, you should try to watch Season Two first, particularly its last half and finale.  If you're a fan of Torchwood and haven't seen this installment yet, try to set aside a large block of time because you're going to have a hard time putting it down between episodes.",1269388800,5,2388,4.658711217183771
3895796,4,B002BVYBJW,"Torchwood started out very light, but quickly took on a more adult theme over the course of three seasons.
Overall, each season gets better and better. Any character can (and will die) through the stories. This is good as its keeps you guessing. Its not like a US show where every week the heroes solve the mystery and there is little reality in what can happen. This show is nothing like that and that is part of what makes it good.

Season One you see the characters, learn what they are doing and why, some of their backgrounds and how they became involved. Several tie-ins with the Doctor Who series. Full seasons/series.

Season Two continues the adventures and things start to change and get interesting along character development and you are pulled into the series further. Only down side, some of the adult themes just get old due to the numerous repetitions (Jack and his boyfriends mostly). The rest of it though makes up for it and keeps you coming back for more. Half a normal season/series number of episodes.

Season Three (Children of Earth): First off, when this first was advertised, it looked like a 5 day special launch to season three and looked like it was going to be a GREAT start. The let down here is the 5 episodes are season 3 in its entirety. The story is still very good, everything does change. It leaves a huge cliffhanger and rather upset you have to wait forever for Season 4 to be made. 5 episodes

BBC: PLEASE do a cranialanalectomy (removal of your collective heads from your ass) and stop screwing around with this series. Make full seasons, the demand is there, the viewers are there, stop acting like every season/series the show has to prove itself again and again. It already has for 3 seasons. Can we please have another FULL season/series?",1269302400,2,1783,4.632911392405063
3895797,5,B002BVYBJW,"They have come.  They were here before and they are here again.  And, as you can guess from the title of this season, they are coming for the children.  Kind of easy to see that coming.  But the rest was shocking, dark, and so twisted it made the aliens themselves look kind of simple and harmless.  You end up really hating most the humans when you finish the last of the five episodes.
Don't wish to give too much away because it is the surprises and twists that help make it so wonderful to watch.  Keep an eye out for Nicholas Briggs, the voice of just about every alien and monster you have come to hate.  And the best, or worse, part about it is how realistic it is.  What could a government do under such a threat?  What have they done?  Dun-dun-dun!  Best season out of all of them.  Really, better than some of the other sci-fi series I watch.  Just don't let the kiddies watch - kind of scary.",1269216000,3,903,4.2105263157894735
3895798,1,B002BVYBJW,"Please beware of unintentional Spoilers:

1. Remove the word ""Torchwood"" from the title of CoE and what you have is a small band of people who work in the same ""office building"" in Cardiff, Wales.  Their mission is to save the Earth from any alien threat.  In the beginning of the series, one lone, sad, sick alien invades.  (Incredibly, no other alien can be found.)  The ""office building"" and everything in it is utterly destroyed.  Now homeless, the group struggles to find unity (and equipment) to fight the Enemy and Save the Earth.  (Amusingly, one of the heroes has had his office building blown out from under him before.  I'm starting to think he just has really bad karma when it comes to structural integrity.)  SO, this Big Bad Sick-to-Its-Stomach Alien never once proves it can destroy more than a few hapless souls in yet another unlucky piece of architecture.  However, everyone is convinced (for some reason) that this shadowy, farty villain is actually a threat and the World Gummints agree to meet its demands.  Not very surprisingly, the Gummints are run by cruel, self-serving, vote-mongering, witless hypocrites.

So, what's new?

Before the end of the show, we witness child abuse, mass child enslavement, infanticide, discriminatory epithets as humour, adult dismemberment, Neo-Nazi Stormtrooper Look-a-likes rounding up frightened children and tearing them away from their equally frightened parents, a father's methodical murder of his wife and daughters and his subsequent suicide....And that's just Humanity!  Not to be outdone, the Alien brings us drug addiction, mass murder and asphyxiation.  Gosh, I'm sure I forgot something.

The final disposition of the Alien is so ghastly that I can't begin to describe it without spoiling the end.  Let's just say it involves the brutal and gory murder of a child while his mother screams in the background.

2.  Now add ""Torchwood"" back into the title.  I'm not sure why you would do this, though, because the show has nothing to do with Torchwood except very superficially.  The ensemble cast is the same.  The location is the same (well, okay, until most of it is destroyed in the very beginning and they relocate to London, UK.)  Um. Did I mention the ensemble cast is the same?  Yeah.  So, there's that.  Um.  Oh, yeah, the costumes are the same.

Mostly what you have is that nothing but the faces are the same.  The Superhero who was clever, diabolically handsome, timeless, sexy and funny--is a morose, moody and distant cypher who made a terrible, terrible mistake in the past and simply repeats it with even more soul-crushing results.  The Loyal Sidekick spends his time trying to figure out where he stands regarding his boss (a valid pursuit) and blundering into places he's far too smart to blunder--with even more soul-crushing results.  The Faithful Second-in-Command finds herself transformed into a Pregnant Ninja (no, really) and, finally, is the only one left standing.

So, before plonking down the sizable sum to buy this DVD consider that it's really not ""Torchwood"" at all and what it ~is~ is pretty damned depressing.

What saves my rating from the negative numbers (aside from the fact that I don't have that option here at Amazon) is the fact that the acting is fantastic.  The ensemble cast is so very good that I'm going to keep my eye out for other endeavours as their careers advance.  The veteran, Peter Capaldi, is divine and always, always worth the price of admission.",1268956800,20,3473,4.970486111111111
3895799,5,B002BVYBJW,"I'm not really a fan of Torchwood.  I absolutley love Doctor Who, and I loved Captain Jack's appearances on Doctor Who, but I always found Torchwood to be rather dumb and really silly with they way they tried to make it ""dark"" by having lots of sex & swearing.  It all seemed to be just trying too hard to be different from Doctor Who.

So I was shocked by how good ""Children of the Earth"" really is, not just for Torchwood, but for sci-fi/espinoage thrillers in general.  The first 3 episodes are classics of the paranoid action genre, with the stakes rising constantly and the ground falling out from under the characters over and over again.  The fact that the government see's Torchwood secret organization and raises them by an even more secret organization brings a great sense of unpredictability to the storytelling.

The main characters are many times more interesting here than they ever were in the first two seasons, and the new characters introduced are fun and fully developed.  Of particular note are a handful of mid-level government officials who find themselves with the fate of the world literally resting upon their shoulders because the elected officials don't want to take any responsibility.  These poor and misguided people go about their business, doing their jobs and keeping their heads down because they are paid to maintain the status quo and not question directives.  They are ordinary people doing terrible things because they are ""just following orders.""  The story brings an unexpected level of empathy for these functionaries who labor in obscurity doing mostly good things for most of their careers but suddenly find themselves being forced to chose between the career they've worked for most of their lives and what is, in almost any sense, the ""right"" thing to do.

When things settle into a less spy and more sci-fi atmosphere in the final two episodes the series manages to maintain the momentum and build things to an almost unbearable level of tension entering the climactic moments.  The final series of events is stunning, tragic and epic, putting ""Children of the Earth"" firmly into the realm of classic science fiction storytelling.

The only bad part is that I have no idea how they can manage to keep this level of quality going.  The series feels dangerous and fresh because of the constantly rising stakes and the feeling that things will not end well for anyone involved.",1264809600,4,2421,4.901960784313726

I liked Torchwood season 1 and 2.  Although I adore Doctor Who, I also really appreciate the edginess and darkness that often is Torchwood.  Much in the same vein as Buffy, but with a more adult edge.

That having been said, this mini series was awful.  The tone of Torchwood was severely skewed.  The setting was completely changed.  I'm sort of pissed about them killing off Ianto at the peak of his performance (after killing off Toshiko and Owen at the end of last season, mind you).  I'm also a little skeeved about destroying the hub.  But, I could live with all that.  My main problem is this series crossed the line between dark science fiction and horror movie.  It was severely disturbing, especially in the 3rd through 5th ""day"".  And, in the end, it is about Jack saving everyone while destroying himself.  Although he's a decent character, his character is primarily characterized by the dynamics of his team (which, I guess now, is not really a team anymore...)

Basically the plot revolves around a race of aliens who are interested in children so they can use them as mini drug labs (literally taking the chemicals the children produced and getting high off of them).  Oh, and they live as perpetual children hooked up to O2 masks surrounded by lethal chemicals with a gazed look on their faces- eternal life.  The world governments are willing to surrender as many children as will make the Aliens go away (really, do they think the Aliens aren't going to come back for more?).  Apparently some under qualified team has been handling this, and trying to kill off everyone else who could possibly help as a strategy.  I can take disturbing, in moderate doses.  This was way above and beyond, a sort of nauseating disturbing that you want to turn away from but can't.

In parts Torchwood was working to save the world with all of the interpersonal stuff that makes Torchwood good.  About midway through they split everyone up (or kill them).  The final solution is a last minute idea, which *happens* to involve killing Jack's grandson.  Dude- why completely change everything?  It doesn't make sense- they took what made the series good and basically diced it up and mixed in some politics and horror.  They made the series as improbable as possible, which works for Doctor Who because it's whacky, and worked for season 1 and 2 of Torchwood because, well, it never took itself too seriously.  It did NOT work for this mini series.

That's what Children of Earth is to me.

If you're not ready to be appalled at the absolutely realistic portrayal of how people in power deal with catastrophe and sell others out to save themselves, you might not be ready to watch this series.  And if you really love these characters, be prepared to have your heart broken multiple times.  But if you can deal with laughing, yelling at the screen and crying your eyes out (and all in one sitting because it's a story that's hard to put down in the middle), watch it, because almost all of you will do just that.

There ARE legitimate critiques of the choices RTD made, twists the plot could have taken but didn't, twists the plot did take and maybe shouldn't have.  Yes.  There is a LOT that can be talked about.  Personally, in this case, I only see that as a strength of the show.

I also see some people saying that the Torchwood characters weren't the right ones to take this particular story on, but I simply can't agree.  I think they were the perfect ones for this, the only ones, perhaps, capable of dealing with it.

Beginning decades earlier, a small group of children is bussed to a remote location in the hills.  Herded by soldiers to aliens, one of the children escapes.  Two facts are immediately suggested to Torchwood fans.  First, the fugitive child has escaped nothing, and will be shown holding out in the slimmest form of asylum.  Second, one of the uniformed men is our own Captain Jack Harkness - a bid for King and Country that will not be counted among his finest hours.

Years later, John Frobisher, a thoroughly British bureaucratic fixture of the Home Office, is called upon to shoulder an enormous burden - brokering an accord with the reappearing aliens.  The beings - who announce their arrival through the minds and mouths of children around the world - are known only as the ""4-5-6"".  Their motives not immediately publicized, it's difficult to avoid signs of nefarious intent.  (On arrival, the 4-5-6 ambassador occupies a gas-filled bubble, in which he occasionally lashes out like some angry parakeet.)  Eventually, 456 will deal to the world governments an especially painful and inescapable dilemma, a choice humanity dare not refuse.  Rather than involve Torchwood, the governments prefer to eliminate it, and the individual members, beginning with Captain Jack himself.

""tell the indestructible man that someone plans to murder him.""

Torchwood has always been a study in opposites, a pack of contradictions (fleshy characters, thin stories; great plot ideas, horrible realization; alternating between being genuinely adult and simply being childish and playing grown-up) and CoE is no exception.

(But we of the RottenReview love, so we'll start off w/the weaknesses of the story and finish on a high).

""Torchwood"" forces us to accept both a moral issue and a sci-fi plot, but not at the same time.  That is, our characters must face a horrible dilemma...but only until a sci-fi plot idea allows them an escape (admittedly a painful one - but still a smaller sacrifice than the one they had been facing anyway).  The ending feels forced and undermines the horrible fate that hung over the previous four episodes.  ""Torchwood"" always falls before the pay-off, and CoE is no exception.

WEY YOU MUST WATCH IT:  After three seasons of aliens, gunfire, death and same-sex lip-lock, ""Torchwood"" comes as close as ever to being a genuinely mature show.  Eschewing the frothy sexually-charged innuendo of the past seasons, we now get loss, pain and grim realization.  ""Torchwood"" has never looked less like ""Dr. Who"" spinoff than it does in CoE.  Best of all, CoE is populated by the series' most full-blooded characters: from Ianto's loutish brother (I'll never complain about Rhys again!!!), to the tragically Loyal Frobisher - and these aren't even the show's regulars.

3895809,4,B002BVYBJW,"Torchwood season 1 was great, but season two drifted and wandered without any direction, with writers creating situations (Owen's condition) that further episodes had to deal with in a very taxing and contrived manner.  It really seems like there is a struggle within the creative team as to whether Torchwood should be destroyed, and the team members killed off, or whether the show is too popular not to continue.

I'll buy one superhuman member in the team - since that is what Captain Jack has been from the (Dr. Who) beginning, but not more.
Children of Earth avoids much of the inconsistent quality of season two by covering a single adventure, in depth.  It also closes the book on Torchwood as we have come to know it, but leaves the possibilities of spin off series covering the surviving characters.

This season allowed viewers to see more about the personal lives and relationships of the team members - presenting a very believable same sex relationship (""I'm not attracted to men, just him"") as well as adding depth to the only romantic relationship in the modern Dr. Who universe that isn't interracial or same sex, by including Gwen's husband in the action.",1256515200,2,1173,4.85
3895810,2,B002BVYBJW,"Torchwood Children of Earth has a very British perspective and psyche. As such the government conspiracy and cover-up theme may be relevant to the British today (look at their government scandals) but has been done to death with the likes of X-Files and Millennium in the 1990s by the Americans. The premise of the show and the choices of the government are therefore not very credible to me, perhaps because I find it hard to believe that any government even the British government would stoop so low or surrender so easily to an alien menace, whose capacity for destruction was not even proven, but merely hinted at for most of the mini-series.

There was no demonstration of the viciousness of the ""456"" or the futility of resistance sufficient for me to agree that the government had no choice but to comply with the ""ransom"" demands. As such, they seem to capitulate too easily, and is perhaps a personal (or British) bias that their government is feckless, spineless, and not to be trusted.

Political commentary in entertainment can be very satisfying when done right, and done intelligently. When done badly, they are as welcomed (and as subtle) as evangelists at your door when you're about to sit down to dinner. Or a Michael Moore movie. But at least with a Michael Moore documentary, you know what you're buying.

As such, I'm very sorry but Children of Earth is a rather parochial morality tale that may not resonate with most people outside the British Isles, though the show may re-kindle some of the passion of die-hard X-philes.",1256342400,5,1545,4.8226415094339625

CoE took the tried and true writer's formula of making characters go through their worst to experience their best and warped it unpleasantly, sending the characters to the absolute darkest places they could possibly sink to. Even if that meant bending the character's established personalities far beyond the patterns viewers had grown familiar with.

The plots from day to day have a tendency to feel a little... recycled, as though borrowed from some campy 50's sci-fi serial, which is particularly detrimental in a series with so few episodes over such a short amount of time. Whereas Doctor Who has a delicious balance of wackily unbelievable and fascinatingly interesting, I feel that CoE has none of that.

3895822,5,B002BVYBJW,"Review of TORCHWOOD, the 3rd Season DVD (BBC/America)
By Dale Reynolds

TORCHWOOD, a BBC/Wales production, seen locally on BBC/America, just completed its third, and possibly last, season.  A spinoff from the wildly successful DOCTOR WHO, it's one of a glut of Brit Si-Fi series in which folk of today have to battle invasions of foreign species, which are knowingly, or unknowingly, bent on destroying the world as we know it.

The storyline has The Torchwood Institute based in Cardiff, Wales.  Founded by Queen Victoria, its job is to protect Earth from these (generally) criminal elements.  Its leader, Captain Jack Harkness, immortal and from the 51st Century, leads a team of experts who dodge death to find more creatures.  The first and second seasons were normal television, with a fine balance between action and intimacy, fun but not exceptional.  But as the writer of the revival 31 episodes of DOCTOR WHO and the originator of the seminal gay/lesbian series, QUEER AS FOLK, the prolific Russell T. Davies has written most of the scripts for TORCHWOOD.

The show is quirky, using the talents of some terrific British actors, but focusing mostly on Captain Jack.  The other stunning revelation of this show is that Cap'n Harkness -- in this century -- is emotionally attracted to men and as he is played by out-gay actor John Barrowman.  The gay Mr. Davies knows whereof he writes.  (Davies is also responsible for the six-episode Brit series, BOB & ROSE, in which a gayman falls for a single mature woman and the troubles they have with their friends and family accepting what they've built as a relationship)

The third season of TORCHWOOD, CHILDREN OF EARTH, was shortened to five one-hour episodes and, now out on DVD, is a must-rent/buy/see.  The prologue, set in 1965, has Captain Harkness leading a group of children to be delivered in the hands of aliens.  In 2008 they return, taking over the voices and bodies of all the children in the world, heralding their return, and demanding what no civilized country or parent would acquiesce to.  The fascination lies in how the British government and its weasely Prime Minister (Nicholas Farrell) work to fulfill the aliens' demands, so as not to be destroyed by them.  The political machinations are utterly fascinating as written and performed.

At the end of Season Two, the producers shook up its audience by killing off two of the supporting team.  In Season Three, they really let it hit the fan when they killed off another important team-member, letting loose an astonishing fusillade of invective from the show's supportive fans.  It's why I suspicion that there will be no fourth season, more's-the-pity.

The casting is superb:  Eve Myles as a team member, her love-interest Rhys (Kai Owen), Harkness' love-interest, Inato Jones (Gareth David-Lloyd), and the superlative Peter Capaldi as a bureaucrat in over his head, who gives a compelling performance.  But the standout is star Barrowman, known to American audiences for his musical-theatre work here.  The suspenseful and intimate direction has been split between Andy Goddard, Ashley Way, Colin Teague and Jonathan Fox Bassett.

Obviously, if one is not willing to accept the science-fiction/fantasy premise, it won't be worth your time.  And if your non-acceptance of homoerotic relationships is too prevalent, you will recoil, but for everyone else, this splendid five hours is an investment in absorption of thrills and sorrow; human emotions that define the word ""Art"".

Season two saw this super scooby gang lose two members and now another is gone with this 5 part mini-series horror event.  I am disappointed to see another cast member written out. It appears someone at the BBC wants the series to end. The story was very good, depressing, but good; and, as indicated, I like the cast.  As a fan of Torchwood, I am used to seeing that every story does not have a fairy tale happy ending and I am fine with that fact.  However, this one went too far in my opinion.  I certainly did not expect Captain Jack to make the horrific sacrafice he made, which was not his to make in the first place. He is not a God, maybe close to T fans, but... I am not sure I can look at this character the same ever again and not sure that I want to and that is a shame as I was so looking forward to this story.

3895832,1,B002BVYBJW,"I've noticed that most of the ""It was brilliant"" and ""Best thing I've ever seen"" reviews have been written by people who had never watched Torchwood.  If you were a Torchwood fan, if you liked the quirky little, character-driven drama we were gifted with during its first two seasons, Children of Earth is not for you.  It is plot-driven, remorseless, angst-filled, nihilistic and, in the end, utterly hopeless.  Unable to get his original stand alone drama produced by the BBC, Russell T Davies poorly retooled CoE to wedge the Torchwood team into the middle of his original story.  Stripping them of all the elements that make Torchwood unique, Davies then reduces the team to a supporting role in a political drama whose man protagonists - John Frobisher, Lois Habiba, Bridget Spears - are all civil servants.  If they had been called Tom, Dick, Harry and Jane, the ""resistance fighters"" in CoE would have worked as effective characters; as Captain Jack Harkness, Ianto Jones, Rhys William and Gwen Cooper, they fail miserably.

Without the unnecessarily added Torchwood element, Children of Earth would have been another in an endless series of science fiction dramas that that appear thrilling and exciting on the first go round, but fade quickly with each subsequent viewing.  The plot holes, inconsistencies, poor writing and dubious special effects (not the flat bed scanner used as ""alien"" technology on Day One) just don't hold up to scrutiny.

If you want to see the elements of Children of Earth done better, watch the original sources Russell T Davies ""borrowed"" his story line from:  Quartermass, Contact, The Fog and 24.

If you like good science fiction, avoid Children of Earth.  If you like Torchwood, pretend CoE ever existed.  It's your only hope, because with CoE, Torchwood is dead.",1251763200,23,1804,5.037037037037037
3895833,1,B002BVYBJW,"Torchwood began as an off-shoot of the Dr. Who series.  The character of Captain Jack Harkness was interesting enough that a series was built around him.  That series was not exactly the best-written in the world, but it had some interesting ideas in it worth exploring.  The second season was much better than the first, but ended sadly with the deaths of Toshiko Sato and Owen Harper.  It was hard on people who had been with the series from the beginning, but somewhat understandable in that the characters had reached a point where it would have been difficult for their roles to continue.  It hurt, but it was bearable.

Along comes the highly-touted Season 3.  My first question was Season 3 of what?  It wasn't season 3 of Torchwood, not the series I used to watch, at any rate.

If you are a fan of Torchwood, you probably won't enjoy this at all.  If you aren't, and can't be bothered with understanding basic physics, political climates, inconsistencies, and other things, you might enjoy it.  Maybe.  If you enjoy watching depressing dramas that leave no hope of anything behind.

I had to stop viewing this several times and force myself to come back to it because the vaunted ""realism"" of the series made no sense to me.  Anyone who knows anything about explosives, concrete, balance, shatter patterns, and many other things will have to suspend their disbelief off of the Empire State Building.  Anyone who is up on current political events will have to do likewise.  Anyone who finds sexual-preference perjoratives distasteful and disgusting would do well to avoid watching unless the sound is turned off.

For those who found it ""innovative"", I recommend watching the rest of the Who universe, plus several of the more popular science fiction or fantasy shows and movies where these ideas and plot devices were originally used.  This thing wasn't even above using rehashed ideas from itself.  Sacrifice of a child to save the world?  Did that in Season One.  Past choices threatening the world of the present?  Did that in Season One as well.  Making mistakes for what seem like good reasons at the time?  Watch Season Two.

If you enjoyed the characters of Torchwood, don't expect to find them here.  Instead there are a lot of people you never heard of and three people who look like the Torchwood characters.  They aren't.  These people behave like ineffectual puppets instead of the heroes they are.

So if you enjoyed Torchwood in the previous seasons, don't bother getting this.  It's not Torchwood.  It's not even close.",1251676800,35,2543,4.830626450116009
3895834,1,B002BVYBJW,"If Children of Earth is what Torchwood has always striven for, as has been implied by Russell T Davies, then I truly wish he had made this point clear to the creators of the first two series. If Torchwood had always been this completely dismal, and its character this incompetent and unlikable, I might never have wasted financial and emotional investments on this series.

But he didn't, and I fell in love with Torchwood: the humor, and the campy-ness, but above all else the characters. Torchwood has always been more ""adult"" than Doctor Who, but even at its darkest moments there was always hope: maybe it wasn't a belief in the fundamental goodness of humankind, but there was certainly belief in Captain Jack and the rest of the team. This was not the case in Children of Earth; by its end, I wanted Jack to leave, and to never come back.

It should be clear to anyone who has viewed the first two series that Children of Earth was not written for the Torchwood universe. The actions taken by all members of the team, but Jack in particular, cannot be justified given their previous characterizations. I was not surprised to hear from Davies that the story for Children of Earth was something he had lying around. The team felt like an afterthought, and every unlikely event, from the destruction of the hub to the stolen, somehow untraceable SUV to Jack's capture, felt entirely contrived, for the sole purpose of forcing them into this story.

The plot itself was interesting, if not original. Many of the new characters were played very well; Peter Capaldi deserves the highest accolades for his portrayal of Frobisher, who he somehow made sympathetic, without the character redeeming himself in any way. Still, I found the presence of Torchwood, or at least its unrecognizable incarnation, made it nearly impossible for me to appreciate whatever brilliance might reside in its political drama.

I would not recommend buying this DVD unless you are confident that you can watch it multiple times. I've seen it twice, and while it was slightly less upsetting the second time, I was left with no desire to watch it again. I also found that the series did not hold up to its second viewing, with plot holes and mischaracterizations becoming even more glaringly obvious. If Children of Earth has been your first exposure to Torchwood, I'd recommend putting your money towards the first two series. They're fun and funny, dark and sexy. More likely that not, their tone will never be recaptured; not by another television series, and certainly not by a fourth Torchwood series. I hope that someday Davies himself watches these first two series, and at least appreciates what he's destroyed.",1251676800,30,2694,4.862745098039215
3895835,2,B002BVYBJW,"As a long-time fan of Torchwood, I found this series highly disappointing, in spite of some superb performances from the cast.

I am disinclined to watch this again.",1251676800,12,387,4.938461538461539
3895836,1,B002BVYBJW,"This is not Torchwood. Torchwood 3 is a team captained by Jack Harkness who protect Cardiff from a rift in time and space. It is a science fiction show filled with neat gadgets and aliens and great relationships.

Children of Earth is a political drama with none of the above. TPTB took away the Hub and all their toys so they couldn't save themselves. They decided that the show was suddenly ""Jack's tragedy"". Poor Jack can't catch a break; they want to make him into the Doctor (who?). They destroyed his home, his life and his character in the name of adult drama. They took an established show with an established plot and established characters and changed the name of the game.

Of course people are upset. We liked our show, we liked our characters. We finally see Ianto step up and become Jack's equal, found out a bit about his background and then have it yanked out from under our feet. Then we are patted on the heads and told that we don't get to have an opinion. It feels like now that Russell T Davies is done with Dr. Who, he decided to redo Torchwood after he practically admitted he ignored it for two years.

I was so disappointed when I didn't receive it on the day of its release (amazon sent it to me 2 days later) that I almost called to complain.  When I got it, it was joyously my day off. I hurriedly unwrapped it and popped it in the player.  4 and a half hours later (give or take a few minutes) I was saying WTF??  Yup kids, to say I was disappointed is a MAJOR understatement.

The powers that be took my beloved Torchwood and turned it into BBC News story of the minute, with a horribly stupid alien, plot holes that you could fly a Boeing 747 through, an invincible and immune-to-harm Gwen and a bunch of government bully-boys (and girls) each trying to be more horrible than the last.  Then to add insult to injury, they topped that all off with the character assassination of Captain Jack Harkness...the reason I came to the show in the first place.

3895846,3,B002BVYBJW,"With only five episodes to work with for this mini-season of Torchwood, it's pretty much nonstop action and compelling story from the get-go. After the basic setup of Day 1, there is barely time to relax and draw in a breath, as the Torchwood team is busy evading a military force that seems bent on killing them, while trying to find out more information about the 456 and why they are connected to every child on the planet.

This was a very good, exciting story, but I personally think it would have been better if it were not Torchwood. Upon viewing the DVD after watching the episodes on BBC, I found a few too many plot holes, and some characters acting very out of character at times. Some things done just didn't seem consistent to how we had viewed the characters up through season 2. The idea was a good one, but it should have been done as a completely unrelated story...perhaps as an earlier Torchwood team's crisis instead of the Jack, Gwen, and Ianto team.

When all is said and done, this was well-written and action packed, but some bits of this puzzle just seemed a bit forced into place. I would have preferred if Russell T. Davies had just left the show on a longer hiatus, and just started a proper, 13 episode season in 2010.",1251417600,2,1246,4.4605263157894735

Jack, Gwen, Ianto and co spend four and a half episodes fighting a corrupt government, not aliens.  Interesting for a while but the PM is so machiavellian he was almost panto.  Miss Moneypenny deals to him in the end - kinda fun.

The alien threat I hear you ask - In the final quarter of an hour they have a very handy deus ex machina  brainwave ""What if we reverse the frequency and turn our children back on the aliens""  And why did they suddenly need a single child to act as a fatal conduit? - Jack's grandchild no less!  Oh, that's right - so we can have a teary eyed jack with another moral dilemma and more moody ""the curse, the curse, the curse of living forever/saving the world"" baggage.  I am well sick of that!  Doctor Who has the same disease.

The children as an alien drugs was clever for a moment but then why didn't they just give the aliens the technology to synthesize human hormones - something we have been able to do for some time (and the aliens apparently couldn't?).  Maybe the aliens just preferred zombie children as drug pets?

3895852,1,B002BVYBJW,"A few weeks before this season aired, I recommended this series to some co-workers of mine. I said it was a bit campy and not exactly note-perfect with regard to plot, dialogue, or acting, but tons of fun, with great characters and a romantic relationship between two lead characters that was as endearing as it was unique among sci-fi programming.

Then I saw Children of Earth and I revoked my recommendation.

This wasn't Torchwood; this was an overwrought mess of a social/political commentary, with cameos by the stars of Torchwood. What passes for plot in this story is entirely dependent on the utter stupidity of every single character in the story, not to mention requiring long-term fans to ignore the canon of both this series and the Who franchise as a whole, as well as actions by the Torchwood team that seem completely inconsistent with their characters as developed in the first two seasons.

I can only assume that the creators of this show felt that the series had deviated from its original purpose, and so they decided to dismantle the old show piece by piece. Hub? Gone. Rift? Not a mention. ""Torchwood is ready""? Hardly. Characters? Disposable.

The funny thing is (and by funny, I mean ""sad""), the only things they seemed to have kept from the previous series were all the weaknesses I mentioned before. The plot had all the structural integrity of Swiss cheese, the dialogue was all but painful at times, and the acting was as hit-or-miss as ever.

It's always sad to lose a favorite show, but my campy, quirky, immensely entertaining Torchwood died with season 2, and this new show is nothing I want any part of.",1250899200,24,1637,4.770318021201414

3895854,4,B002BVYBJW,"At its heart, Torchwood: CotE is a morality tale.  What happens when the mistakes of the past are revisited on the present?  Even if our motives at the time were well reasoned, those decisions can come back to haunt us.  What happens when you are given a choice that has no upside?  Even if our present motives are well intended, those decisions may have dire consequences.  CotE is a stark reminder that sometimes ""The road to hell is paved with good intentions.""

The acting here is top notch, the storytelling is taut, and the atmosphere of the story is decidedly dark.  Many of the characters inhabit a place of moral ambiguity, that will be disturbing for some and depressing for others.  Most of the characters sent to destroy Torchwood, have human frailties that reveal the dark side of their ""good intentions"".  You may not like them, but given similar circumstances, but you may be able to understand where they come from.  Does this excuse their behavior?  No, but it helps us understand what motivates them.  Unfortunately, it is these terrifying choices that are at the heart of the story.

If you liked Season's 1 and 2 of Torchwood, CotE has the same horror, in this case both psychological and visual horror.  Some will not enjoy CotE, because it is reluctant to give us the happy ending we all wish for.  Heroes sometimes make terrifying choices.  Their actions have consequences that are sometimes not easy to live with.  Sacrifices must be made.  This may ruin the ending for some b/c it doesn't end on an entirely happy note.

I will say that it is very, very dark.

3895864,2,B002BVYBJW,"In all honesty, I probably would have liked Children of Earth as a stand-alone mini series or even possibly as a pilot for a new show... but it simply didn't work with the established canon of Torchwood and Dr. Who.

Children of Earth (COE) had a lot of potential, but in the end fell short in too many ways.  It felt as though it was  a stand alone story that Davies had grafted Torchwood onto...  I think I probably would have liked this as a stand alone story, but the fact is it wasn't.  It was meant to be a Torchwood story but felt like a political drama (similar to 24) and Davies pushing every emotional button he could think of to increase the ratings and make people talk about him (and yes, I do mean him and not the series).  Even stellar performances (the reason I've given this 2 stars) by the regular cast (what's left of them) and guest Peter Capaldi couldn't save this mess.

To me it seemed like the writers were grafting Torchwood onto an already existing story.  As a result there are periods where the team acts very out of character (based on what had been established in the prior 2 seasons) to an unreasonable and unrealistic result.  The writing was sloppy and resulted in plot holes you could drive a truck through (I've posted a list in the comments section-- the list contains spoilers for all 3 seasons as well as seasons 1-4 of New Who).  There was a tremendous amount of foreshadowing (I could have told you what the climax of Day 5 would be on Day 1)... as well as what would be billed as ""motivation"" for Jack's action in the climax (the only real surprise for me was that the executive producers said that was there reason for the climax of Day 4).  In all honesty, this felt like 2 or possibly 3 episodes stretched over 5-- the result was at best awkward (really, we know they are in London how many exterior shots to you need?).

While this story was meant to be innovative, the fact is it really covered no new ground for Torchwood (other then the drive from Cardiff to London)-- it was predictable from Day 1 and the 4.8 days was resolved in the space of about 5 minutes.  Honestly, this didn't surprise me-- I've noticed in other shows that while Russell T Davies is good at build-up he rarely follows through with a truly satisfying ending (happy or not).  This is a dark, depressing series and is completely and utterly without hope.

Spoilers Below * Spoilers Below * Spoilers Below * Spoilers Below * Spoilers Below * Spoilers Below * Spoilers Below

The first few episodes were okay and fit within the ""Torchwood Universe"" - though many of the familiar and loved elements (the Hub, the pterodactyl, Cardiff) were quickly destroyed or left behind in favor of setting the main story in London.  Alot of my comments below are in reference to Russell T Davies as he is the one we hear talk the most and as he appears (from what I've read) to take the most credit for the story concept and execution.

There was no new ground covered-- Torchwood established in season 1 that Jack can be a bastard and was willing to sacrifice a child (Small Worlds) this is underlined by his giving the 12 children up in 1962.  Tosh and Owen were killed at the end of season 2 (Exit Wounds) to establish that Torchwood is dangerous (unless your immortal Captain Jack or Gwen Cooper)-- in the time in between, no new characters were brought in to round out the team, something that does not seem reasonable in light of the volume of work the Rift made in the first two seasons...  I had no desire to see Owen and Tosh simply replaced, but if Davies wants to keep killing off established characters he needs to take the time to establish new ones (and could someone please explain the concept of overkill and less is more to the man?).  Instead, it seems like he was just doing everything he could to break Jack and give him a reason run away (not that I blame Jack after COE) so he can show up in the upcoming Dr. Who specials (I highly doubt COE will receive even a passing mention in Dr Who-- it's meant to be kid friendly)...  and worse yet, avoid dealing with grief on screen (Jack left 6 months after the climax of COE... if he runs away and runs into the Doctor to travel a bit they can bring him back for season 4 of Torchwood and say... oh, it's been YEARS for him, he's already dealt with his grief and is all set to move on-- who can we have him hook up with while he moons over Gwen?).

The fact is Davies keeps missing the boat.  In Exit Wounds (Season 2) he killed off 2 main characters to prove Torchwood was dangerous and ""nobody's safe.""  They died, we had about 3 minutes of mourning in that episode and a passing reference in COE.  Torchwood keeps trying to bill itself as an adult drama--part of being an adult is grief.  It's unreasonable to believe everything would be dealt with so quickly.  In fact, I would argue that a much more powerful story would have been having Tosh die  and Owen survive...  Owen was finally starting to appreciate Tosh--and coming back to find her dead after she saved him in the power plant would have been awful and amazing and potentially a brilliant story (when I mentioned that idea to my sister she told me I was evil).  Even on a smaller scale-- after Cyberwomen... Ianto's actions were not mentioned in subsequent episodes (beyond a hand on the shoulder in Small Worlds) and there was no discussion or confrontation between Ianto-Jack and the rest of the team in the aftermath-- he simply came back to work; when Jack came back from the year that wasn't (Dr. Who Season 3) the entire year he spent being tortured was only mentioned in passing; Gwen's words at the end of Meat to the team and Jack's brooding over her at the end?  I can't believe that Tosh, Owen and Ianto didn't have something to say; and in Adrift (Season 2), the implication was that Ianto gave Gwen the GPS to lead her to Flat Holm-- Jack believed it, but that confrontation never happened on screen nor was it ever discussed in subsequent episodes-- the characters were right back to where they were as though it never happened.

In COE, Ianto's death as a motivation for Jack sacrificing his grandson makes no sense--in fact, I'd argue that the opposite is likely to be true (or that Jack would have at least attempted to fight it or tried to come up with another solution).  I don't like the idea of sacrificing children as a plot device (and Davies manages to do this twice in COE)... but the fact is I knew the first day that at least one of the kids (Stephen, Micha or David) wasn't making it past Day 5.  Torchwood has established that while Ianto is loyal to Jack, he will stand up to him--usually off screen-- and do what he thinks is right (Adrift).  Ianto standing up to Jack over sacrificing one of the kids and the aftermath of Jack doing it anyway would have been a much stronger story and one that would resonate for years.

Russell T Davies is similar to the Doctor in the fact that he doesn't like to deal with the aftermath... he likes to torture his characters, get a couple of minutes of grief out of them and get that shot where they are standing alone looking off into the distance and then end the episode.  I don't know if this is because Davies doesn't see the opportunity to tell brilliant stories in the aftermath or if he feels he's just not a good enough writer to manage them (personally, I think the first as I don't think his ego could handle the second).

I've also seen a lot of comparisons to Joss Whedon.  Davies isn't Whedon.  While Whedon may make decisions that I don't like they always promote the story and push things in new directions-- we wouldn't have had Dark! Willow without Tara's death in Buffy (in that case, it had to be someone very close-- likely Tara, Xander or Dawn to make those actions believable).  Willow's response was scary, heartbreaking and BELIEVABLE.  In the case of COE, Ianto's death didn't push the story in new directions-- in fact it made the direction it went in (Jack's sacrifice of Stephen) more unbelievable.  In the end it felt like an emotional punch that was meant to: 1) make the viewer realize this is a dangerous situation-- they call them red shirts in Star Trek [guess what-- the aliens were talking through the children... I think any parent was well aware of the danger]  2) distract the views from sloppy writing and huge plot holes.  Both reasons were a disservice to the character and the viewers.

I've read that Davies said the decision to kill Ianto off was his first decision in regards to COE-- to me this implies he was looking for an emotional punch that the story was written around... not coming up with a story that the death fit into.  Death is a part of life and has always been a huge theme in Torchwood.  That being said, if your planning to kill off a main character (and extremely popular one at that) it has to be well thought out and part of a strong, tight script (because, the fact is your going to end up with geeks like me who pick it apart and provide references to every plot hole).  While I had issues with Exit Wounds, overall it was a good story and one I still pop into the DVD player when I want a good cry...  As amazing as John Barrowman and Garath David-Lloyd were (and really, they were) in the death scene the effect was ruined by the poorly thought out lead-up and the fact that it was simply not part of a good or even well thought-out story.  I wouldn't even bother watching COE again for free much less spending the $14.50 for DVD (and this is coming from a woman who will and has spent $50 on a single season of Torchwood and $75 on a single season of Dr Who).

Speaking of which... I started looking at the cost of COE on Amazon a few weeks before the series aired in the UK, at that time I think the price was around $28... right before it aired in the UK it had dropped to about $25... since it's aired it's continued to drop and as I write this is only $14.49  (8/1/2009) -- my assumption was this was due to ""die-hards"" canceling pre-orders after seeing the series...  I did some math-- when I bought the first 2 series of Torchwood from Amazon they cost about $50 for each season (I think one was slightly less then $50 and one was slightly more).  This works out to about $3.45 per episode ($50/13 episodes).  COE works out to about $2.90 per episode ($14.49/5).  If anyone knows of another reason, please comment as I'm very curious.

On a more personal note, I want to say that I've found Davies comments since COE aired arrogant and offensive.  In particular, his comment that the ""controversy"" over Ianto's death was basically ""nine hysterical women"" and that people who are upset about Ianto's death and how it was handled should watch Supernatural.  I've included links to these stories in the comments section of this review.",1249603200,13,10813,4.425327951564077

Torchwood has always been dark, but there has always been light at the end of the tunnel.  In this one, they jump off the deep end and never look back.  If you want something less depressing, go visit a hospital suicide ward.  Seriously.

Another very serious problem I have with TW:CoE is the series of breaks from character that disrupted the suspension of disbelief.  There is one, in particular, where Jack makes a radical 180 in what he's doing, in a way that only a person who's never experienced war first-hand would.  Jack, having been through several major wars, would never have responded in the way they had him, making it (at least to me) glaringly obvious that the writers on this episode couldn't truly relate to the perspective of this character that had been developed over the prior several years.  The worst part is that they tied this in with the ""overwhelmingly-depressing"" theme; it almost looks like they stiltedly inserted these breaks with character purely so that they could shove the mood off the deep end.

Then there is the case of a rule that most of both the video game industry and the TV/movie industry have been aware of for a couple of decades now:  The entertainment comes first, not realism.  People usually engage in entertainment to get away from what they have to deal with every day in their lives.  Most people in our culture expect there to be some sort of uplifting / relief ending - not because it's realistic, but because it helps them to feel better.  You even see this in most movies that you would normally expect to be horribly depressing, like horror flicks and thrillers.  But nothing kills entertainment faster than an overload of realism, and TW:CoE is wallowing in realism up to its eyeballs.

The only redeeming point I found was the acting.  There were a number of phenomenal performances in this; it's just too bad TW:CoE itself wasn't put together well enough to support the actors in their roles.

3895866,4,B002BVYBJW,This is the best that Torchwood has to offer. I'm a big Doctor Who and Torchwood fan and I thought this was some of the best the new series has to give. The alien was just creepy. The situation was simple yet horrific. The solution both believable and unbelievable. The American networks would never allow some of things done in this show. I just loved ever episodes. I recommend it to anyone even if you don't like Torchwood.,1249516800,2,426,4.4743589743589745
3895867,1,B002BVYBJW,"A good story on it's own without the Torchwood characters, but ruined by dropping Torchwood into the mix.  It is obvious that this was a script Russell T. Davies had previously written perhaps to be a movie.  When the BBC decided they wanted Torchwood to be a 5 hour miniseries for the third series, Davies took this script and dropped the Torchwood team into it.  The result destroyed Torchwood.

The Torchwood team were the actors and the character names, but they were NOT the characters, with the exception of Gwen and Rhys.  I have to say that for the most part, Gwen and Rhys stayed true to their characters.  The relationship between Jack and Ianto was cold on Jack's part until the defining moment of the series (I won't give away a spoiler, but if you've seen it, you know what I mean).  And what was up with the homophobic remarks?  Ianto was called ""queer"", ""gayboy"" and a ""poofter"".  All of that was uncalled for and destroyed the non-judgmental quality of the previous two series.

The Torchwood team became helpless and unmotivated in this story, which was unlike them.  In addition, they did stupid things that they would be too smart to do - I mean Jack and Ianto shooting hand guns at what they would have known was impenetrable glass.  And handguns against an alien that could destroy the human race?  Please - it was stupid.

The destruction of the hub, an unnecessary death, what probably was an unnecessary murder if Torchwood had found a better solution, and Jack running away effectively ended the series.  I don't know how it can go on from here.  Of course new members could be recruited.  But then the audience gets to watch the new team discover Jack's secrets that we already know.  Yawn!

Davies seems obsessed with killing off characters - maybe because he can't on Doctor Who, so he uses Torchwood as his tool for that.  And Davies' attitude when criticized for this series is downright disgusting.  How dare he dismiss the fans that made him and made this series.  Telling us we should go read poetry if we can't understand drama, or to go watch Supernatural (not that I'm dissing that show - I like it, too).  Talk about biting the hand that feeds you!

I for one was thoroughly disgusted by eps 4 & 5 especially, but elements of the first three nights were ridiculous and just done to put Torchwood into some chases and gunfire.  I think the best thing the BBC could do is dismiss this as a one off, fire Davies' and put Steven Moffat in charge - he wrote some of the best and most intriguing episodes of both Torchwood and Doctor Who anyway.  And have a certain character step out of the shower in the 4th series premiere and Jack realize it was just a dream or a vision in the rift!",1249516800,15,2718,4.51844262295082
3895868,3,B002BVYBJW,"I enjoyed the first three episodes, but I felt it fell apart in the last two. In some of the ""making of"" videos, Russell T. Davies waxes about how the Torchwood universe is more realistic than the Dr. Who one (but both must be reconciled). Sorry, Mr. Davies, but you make the mistake of thinking that dystopian is more realistic than utopian. While I don't want to provide spoilers, I found the actions of both the government ministers (as a group) and the soldiers in the last two episodes to be so unrealistic that I found myself unable to completely enjoy the show. These episodes seemed just too contrived to make Gwen and Jack suffer. As a result, the final episode lacked an emotional punch for me. I'd like to see more Torchwood along the lines of the first season, and most of the second, but not more like this, please!",1249430400,6,828,4.490066225165563
3895869,5,B002BVYBJW,"I loved the new episodes.  I was a bit worried after reading so many terrible reviews from fans but found these episodes to be some of my favorite so far.  The series is dark but that is the point, it is not oriented towards a child audience like Doctor Who.  The deepening of the relationship between Jack and Ianto and the involvement of the characters' families brought a new, wonderful aspect to the development of the characters. And, once again, watching Gwen struggles to balance work and a personal life bring a bit of humanity to the show.  I won't offer anything to spoil the exciting but chilling surprises in this season, but safe to say if you've loved previous seasons of Torchwood you will not be disappointed.",1249430400,5,725,4.640625

I watch Doctor Who as well, but after watching this, the new Who episode just fell flat. I don't buy many dvds, as I don't really watch things more than once. But this whole series was just so amazing, I'm thinking of buying all three seasons. You can tell a lot of love went into this show. It was in your face and unapologetic. The best part, IMO, is that there was always a sacrifice when saving the day - things didn't magically work out in the end (*cough* Doctor Who *cough*).
Any plotholes people mentioned, IMO are minor. It works as a whole, and I can't think of anything to pick at.

This is not your average sci-fi. Even if you're not a sci-fi fan (I never liked Star Trek and haven't seen any Star Wars movies, but I do watch sci-fi that's more grounded on Earth), this is incredible storytelling and acting. See it!",1249257600,3,1104,4.064220183486238

3895872,2,B002BVYBJW,"I have to agree with many of the less-than-thrilled reviews.  As a fan of Torchwood, I found myself watching this series in a state of confusion.  It became almost immediately evident to me that Russell T. Davies had not exaggerated when he confessed that the idea for ""Children of Earth"" had been conceived outside of Torchwood and was only applied when they were given the mini-series framework to work in for Torchwood series three.  It felt as if the Torchwood concept had been shoehorned into a political thriller.  Taken on that front, as political drama, the series is rather gripping.  It never resorts to heavy-handedness.  The acting is gripping, the decisions are often no-win, and characters do not shy away from ugly choices - or from selfish ones.  I truly respected that.

But as a Torchwood story arc, it suffers considerably.  The classic Torchwood elements are completely absent( obvious aspects - Cardiff, the Rift, the Hub - and more subtle aspects - the expected balance between humor and sci-fi-based drama, Captain Jack's cheek, and a notable resistance to labeling characters based on sexuality).  The characters at Thames House got the lead; the Torchwood team was reduced to a supporting role.  With the team already reduced from five to three after the series two finale, then further diminished by the government-directed attack on their base and very lives, the writers of this series gave lie to the familiar statement from the series one and two opening credits:  ""The 21st Century is when everything changes, and Torchwood is ready.""  Torchwood was anything but ready, scrambling to regroup, confronting the alien threat with a poorly-developed plan.  It's no wonder that, by the end of ""Children of Earth,"" the Torchwood team is destroyed and the audience is left feeling hopeless.

As a long-term viewer, I was particularly confused by the way the series made a point of focusing on Ianto Jones' sexuality, labeling him repeatedly as ""queer"" or ""gayboy,"" even marking his face with a lambda-shaped wound.  That uncharacteristic behavior extends to the lines given to his character and his on-screen lover, Captain Jack Harkness.  The easy dynamic between the two of them from previous seasons is notably absent, replaced instead with a trite, angsty coming-out story that's been done to death.  A team once noted for ""snogging as the world is ending"" is now dissuaded by a tin of warm beans.  That the Ianto Jones character does not fare well in this series is just the icing on a rather disappointing cake.

I expected so much more than this.

DISC REVIEW:  Comparing the Blu-Ray to a friend's DVD copy, I was disappointed that there's not an appreciable improvement in quality between the two.  There's only one extra, the content of which is available for free on the series websites or iTunes, provided you don't mind slightly different editing.",1249171200,10,2883,5.023157894736842
3895873,1,B002BVYBJW,"I had never seen an episode of Torchwood before.  However I had heard about it and when I saw the ads for this new miniseries, I decided to check it out.  Never have I seen a more depressing, nihilistic, downbeat mess.  Now I realize that all sci-fi doesn't necessarily have to be upbeat, I've watched enough episodes of the X-Files to know that.  However, the least you should do is make some sense. This series was utterly idiotic and depressing, just for the sake of being depressing.  I will cut to the chase and if you do not want to know any plot points, stop reading here as I will be revealing the major plotline of the show.
I will jump forward to about the 3rd episode.  Some very nasty alien has contacted the British government that he wants to meet with them.  So they take a very secure government building, create a tank and fill it with the poisonous environment that he needs to breathe. (Sort of like the old Ambassidor Kosh on the great Babylon 5.)  He drops in and starts negotiating with a British bureaucrat while the P.M. and his stooges watch.  Turns out he wants 325,000 schoolchildren turned over to him.  It appears that he was here before in 1965 and the government handed over 12 schoolchildren in exchange for a flu vaccine.(It is never mentioned where they managed to get these kids, I guess the writer felt it wasn't important.)  The man who handed the kids over was Torchwood's Captain Jack.  Now it it 2009 and due to inflation I guess, the alien wants a lot more.  The British government blusters  briefly about fighting the aliens.  However all the alien has to do is seal off the government building and poison everyone there and the government caves right in.  (This is sure not ID4 or War of the Worlds.)  Now what has Torchwood been doing to prevent this.  They get a young civil servant to put on special contact lenses so that they can see and hear what is going on.  And Captain Jack and the other male member of the team charge in and confront the alien with a couple of .45s, only to be immediately poisoned.  This gives Captain Jack an opportunity to kiss his homosexual lover goodbye.
Now throughout this, the UN and the President of the U.S. are barely mentioned despite the fact that the aliens are demanding children from all over the world. (Apparently they use something the kids produce to feel good, basically, I guess, they get high on the kids.)  On the scene arrives a black American 3 star General who is even nastier and more ruthless than the British P.M., who he continuously just bosses around. (I guess American Lieutenant Generals outrank British Prime Ministers.) Maybe I'm just being nationalistic but I can't imagine any American President, other than perhaps the one we are currently stuck with, calmly giving in to the aliens and providing them with thousands of American schoolchildren.  But thats just me.
Anyway the roundup of children starts. Torchwood has a tape of the bureaucrats discussing the plot.  They make a half-hearted threat to put it on the Internet. However when they are threatened with arrest and told that it won't matter anyway, they decide to not bother posting it. (Perhaps thousands could be hiding their children and fighting back, thats why.  This show is unbelievably stupid.)  The main British diplomat is promised that his 2 daughters will not have to go.  Suddenly, for no reason, the P.M. changes his mind. (I guess 325,000 wasn't enough, they needed 2 more.)  The bureaucrat promptly goes home, shots his wife, 2 daughters and himself.  Very upbeat.
The army starts rounding up schoolchildren and only about a dozen tough guys fight back. (We hear in passing that others are fighting back, but we don't see it. Budgetary restraints, I guess.)  Gwen of Torchwood assists in helping her dead partner's sister and about a dozen kids flee the roundup, never does she make any attempt to grab a gun and just fight back.  Captain Jack, who has risen from the dead (his specialty,) is released from prison and in about an hour figures out that soundwaves from the children can be used to destroy the aliens. (Sounds a bit like Tim Burton's ""Mars Attacks."")  Of course, the Captain has to use and kill his own grandchild in the process of proving it. What a guy!
So the alien leaves in a hurry and, using the Torchwood contact lenses, some female bureaucrats film the P.M. plotting to blame it on the Americans (poor us.)  They basically tell him that they will be running things from now on (despite the fact they they were in on his plot to give away the 325,000 children from the beginning and did not object too much.)
And what of Torchwood?  Captain Jack leaves the earth in his spaceship and Gwen looks forward to having her baby. (I forgot to mention she was pregnant.)
As stated at the beginning, I found this to be utterly stupid and downbeat. I can't imagine who could have come up with such a jaundiced and utterly negative plot with so many idiotic plotholes that I have barely scratched the surface.  This was my first experience with Torchwood and it will undoubtedly be my last.",1249171200,14,5087,4.640625

This mini-series was: A) Marvelously done, and B) About the most gut-wrenching thing I've ever seen where you could still fathom there being another season after it. Not a happy story, and don't watch it expecting to come out of it happy. Despite this, it was wonderfully done. The acting was superb, the moral dilemmas tangible, and the protagonists actually had to make permanent and wrenching decision when faced with Hobson's choice. I'm impressed.

On that note though, while I liked the show, I've never felt strongly attached to Torchwood's characters. This story made me identify with them more than I ever have before, and I can see that a more devoted fan would be horrified at what the writers do to their much beloved characters.

Torchwood Children of Earth was my first view of the series...I loved it! But, I can see how it would have disappointed so many who may have loved the original series.  If you have not seen any Torchwood shows I would recommend Torchwood COE. It certainly has me wanting to see the entire series. Though I may stick to renting them since the price is a little steep for only 12 shows per season.  I've paid less for far more shows on a series DVD...

  Full disclosure -- I am a die-hard fan of Captain Jack and John Barrowman.

  I almost loved ""Children of Earth"" except for one breakdown in the plot.  Without giving away the story, when Jack and Ianto confront the 456 the plot is illogical.  The writers really goofed here in that the motivation and logic behind what Jack and Ianto do is totally unbelievable.  I wish I could explain this better, but if I did I would give away too much.

  I liked ""Children of Earth"" because the characters are complicated and perplexing.  Many of the characters are not what they seem and do things contrary to their natures.  We also get to see behind the curtain as the elite and powerful confront their own failures and an unexpected crisis.  We get to find out more about the fascinating and inimical Captain Jack.

I watched the entire mini-series in one sitting.  I was on the edge of my seat almost the whole time.  Most scenes were very suspenseful and it was very well acted.  Now on the downside, I found the whole story very disturbing and depressing.  In most all sci-fi series of yester-years, seriously harming children on screen was basically off-limits.  The adults did the dying, not the children.  Russell T. Davies is known for his ""shock"" scenes and he does not hold back in COE.  I enjoyed the show, but he basically destroyed Torchwood and made the Captain Jack we loved from Dr. Who and the 1st Season of Torchwood into a character that you lose all respect for.  I know I did.  Needless to say, the disturbing story-line and conclusion of the show made me depressed the whole day.

Having just viewed ""Torchwood: Children of Earth"" I believe this to be science fiction at its darkest and yet most meaningful.  In this 3rd series, Torchwood's hub has been destroyed, and its team has become the focus of a government man-hunt and conspiracy cover-up.  Driven underground the Torchwood team has been effectively neutralized, hampered in their ability to understand or help with an alien encounter that has its historical origins in 1965. SF connosieurs may criticize the alien ""456"" for seeming to be vague in their origins, nature and abilities, but in this series, from a literary standpoint - they need to be - because the story is less about them -- and more about us. To put it another way, when Queen Victoria would have established the Torchwood Institute in 1879 to defend the British Realm against non-human outsiders, it's hardly likely that she would have forseen Torchwood's earnest efforts coming under such virulent attack from within the government itself.  The decisions that Captain Jack must make are horrible, and viewers may well question if perhaps he'd had more time to analyze the olfactory elements of 456's presence, or the hormone variances between youth and adulthood - perhaps he may have come to a better --less reprehensible solution - than he resorted to at the series end.  We don't know -- and perhaps that's the point.  The men and women of the Manhattan Project were given limited time, and like Frobisher, they were likely under pressure believing that the bomb represented the only solution to the challenges of World War II.  Perhaps it was the only solution.  But here at the series end is Captain Jack Harkness, who is still trying to kick the dirt off his shoes even six months after the events of ""Children of Earth"".  Like him, we too now live in a forever changed world. YES!

Lots of melodramatic scenes over people you just can't care about. For some reason Gwen's husband complains about being cold all the time...

3895887,1,B002BVYBJW,"When watching this 5 part miniseries on BBC America this past week, I have to say that the first 3 Days out of 5 were intriguing, despite the plot holes and uncharacteristic stupidity.  (One thing that bugs me the most is when my beloved characters do stupid things or do things that they normally won't do.)  The concept was interesting, but then Day 4 came.  And what I knew to be Torchwood was stomped by a giant boot of an ego named Russell T. Davies.  From Day 4 onward, nothing made sense in the Torchwood universe.  The stupidity factor went through the roof.  I only watched Day 5 to see if all the crap was indeed a dream sequence or a cruel joke.  I was desperate to make some sense of the catastrophe that is Children of Earth.

Basically, what happened was Mr. Davies decided to destroy everything he built over two years in the series Torchwood.  The fans did not matter, the characters did not matter, a logical plot did not matter.  The political MESSAGE that Mr. Davies wanted to say was the only thing that mattered. As another reviewer has already mentioned, Mr. Davies doesn't care what his fans think.  In fact, he mocks them.

So if you are a fan of Torchwood, prepare to say your goodbyes to this great series.  If you are a Sci Fi fan, Children of Earth is like Alien 3, which we all pretend didn't happen.  If you are neither a Torchwood fan nor a Sci Fi fan, then I would liken Children of Earth to watching your house burn down with everything you love in it.",1248825600,13,1485,4.352727272727273

We saw very little of the Torchwood team, in favor of boardroom conferences and nicely executed explosions, interspersed with incredibly boring scenes with an alien the writers didn't bother to fully realize.  The characters carefully developed in the first two series were mere caricatures of themselves, with the total ineptness and passivity of Captain Jack Harkness being completely unforgivable.  The death of Ianto Jones, although brilliantly acted, had no plot significance and did not advance the storyline nearly as well as would his reaction to following events, and the storyline left me uncaring as to what would happen with the remaining elements of Torchwood.

3895889,2,B002BVYBJW,"Forgive this review if it has spoilers, but I'll tell you right now it doesn't matter, cause this mini-series is just not worth watching at all.

In general, I like the Torchwood series...(I like Doctor Who even more though.) But I'd like it a lot better, if Children of Earth was never made.
I seriously feel like RTD made this as an insult to the fans. And he destroys any chance the series had, for ever being good, in future episodes. I honestly cannot picture how the series can move on from this point. Logically it has to end here. (Unless there's some sort of alternate universe/time-line plot in future episodes.) There is just no way to piece things back together, after this.

He kills off a favorite character via a pointless death, traumatizes every character involved, and by the end of these episodes, turns everyone's favorite 51st century cool-hero, into a complete bastard. Seriously, considering how old Jack is, and how much he's seen in his life, his choices at the end of this batch of episodes, just doesn't make sense or add up at all. He acts without thinking of better alternatives, tosses aside the morality he's shown in the past, and becomes an immature monster! The plot is full of holes, and destroyed expectations... The story sets things up for greatness, and delivers a pile of garbage. I wish I had never watch it.
I can think of a million ways that Children of Earth could have been infinitely better! Even the easy-way-out solution of having a Doctor cameo moment, would have been good; In fact, they even set things up for That to happen, but then seemingly forget about that, and it's all downhill from there. -_-

The first 3 (maybe 4) episodes were good, exciting, and original, which is why I gave it 2 stars, instead of 1... But I would have been happier if it all ended there, even without finishing the plot. LOL

I cannot describe this as anything more than an insult to fans... No idea what RTD was thinking, but he's lost his touch, if nothing else.  Thank god he won't be writing for Doctor Who anymore. At least I hope nothing more than an occasional guest-written-episode.

If you like Torchwood, and if you think Captain Jack Harkness is awesome... AVOID this series AT ALL COST! You WILL be disappointed and depressed... Unless you are a total blind fan of RTD, regardless of what he does. -_-",1248825600,15,2346,4.627403846153846
3895890,4,B002BVYBJW,"This is a review of the DVD, rather than of the program (because other people have done that already better than I could have done).  I hoped to get the special extended ""Inside the Hub"" bits that were shown on BBC America every evening.  These were not repeated during the Sunday marathon.  The DVD has very limited extras -- unless they're hidden! -- and does not include material shown with the program.  I've only started watching the extra program that is included (""Torchwood Declassified"") and it is fun and interesting, but does not seem to be those ""Inside the Hub"" bitlets.

I would have liked having the hour-long program they did on Torchwood and the collection of bits as well as Torchwood Declassified.  For relative poverty of extra material I rate this DVD four, rather than five, stars.

Now, if it turns out that the bitlets actually are embedded somewhere, I will be very red-faced.",1248825600,4,901,4.774193548387097
3895891,2,B002BVYBJW,"** NO spoilers here, just comments **

Fortunately I watched this 'On Demand' where I was able to fast-forward through the constant repetitive drawn out 'suspense' sequences.  And there were many of them used to drag this 3 episode worthy story line out to 5 episodes.

The 'fun' is also missing.  Sure, not all of the season 1 & 2 episodes had fun saving the world, but since this season relies on only one story line you miss the fun.  And don't hope for action to replace it, clearly the BBC is having budget problems in this bad economy, false suspense replaces fun & action.

It is hard to believe that this was conceived as a 5-part story, but from what Russel T. Davies says, it appears that it was.  I really don't like using one storyline for an entire season.  Not everyone will like every story in a season, but there is always hope with the next episode in those cases.  Here, there is no hope.  If you don't like episode 1, you are guaranteed not to like episdoes 2 through 5.

This multi-part story doesn't even feel like the same show we saw in the first year!

Reports at Comic-Con 2009 this past July is that the BBC has not yet purchased more episodes for another year.  This can always change as this year goes by, but it does make you think.

However, should a 4th year be produced, you will need to see this mini-series to follow the continuing story arc.",1248825600,10,1376,4.366141732283465
3895892,5,B002BVYBJW,"NOTE: This review contains minor spoilers...you've been warned! Like many other ""Doctor Who"" fans, I've always found the spin-off ""Torchwood"" to be hit-and-miss. But with ""Children of Earth,"" the slate has been wiped clean. It's only 5 episodes, but every one hits the mark. The story of aliens returning to earth after an extended absence is nothing new, of course. But the beauty is in the execution. The site of children all over the world suddenly stopping in the their tracks, then becoming the mouthpiece for an invasion force is nothing less than chilling. But Children of Earth is so much more than that. The three surviving members of Torchwood all have their personal story arcs, fleshing out their characters like never before. While the aliens, dubbed the ""456"", attack humanity where it hurts (our children), each of the three main players examines his or her own family in ways that are often surprising. And while Torchwood has also been the most adult of the modern ""Who"" universe, it has never seemed more focused. Like the best science-fiction novels, the story touches on ideas that are far beyond the mundane. Government responsibility and even complicity, as well as individuals' rights, are a major theme. And Russell T. Davies' script isn't afraid to ask the big questions: Would you sacrifice your future to save the present? Are we doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past? Even with all its philosophic touchtones, Children of Earth is also an action-packed adventure. Production values are high; in fact, with maybe 30 or 40 minutes trimmed, it would have made an excellent big-screen movie. For fans of the show, it's a must-have (Gwen's realization that a certain well-traveled Time Lord is not going to swoop in and save the world is a fan-stroking high point). But even for casual viewers or people not familiar with the backstory, it's still first-class science-fiction.",1248739200,6,1903,5.006309148264984

I couldn't understand how the 4-5-6 were able to control all the children on earth to the extent that they were able to use them as ventriloquist dummies and talk all at the same time.  Was that ever explained?

And if they were able to do that much, why didn't they just make 10 percent of the children walk to wherever they were wanted, and spare the fuss at Thames House?

Hope this isn't too spoiler-y, but anyone who watched the first episode would know about all the children stopping their play and saying, ""We are Coming.""

I'd also like to know how Jack got little Steven to do what we did.  Yes, it's Greek tragedy or Biblical tragedy like Abraham and Isaac but were my eyes rolling when that plot unrolled!  And why did Alice wear that moronic grin throughout all her scenes even when awful things were happening to her?  People speak of the great acting on these British shows, but I'd call it spotty at best.

Until now and then...well, you know.  After polarizing any readers into camps...this much is clear.  This is a tough show to enjoy, especially if you've cared about these characters and these actors.  I think the production is quite good and the script uncompromising as all hell.  Barrowman is great as he usually is.  I think the true star here is Peter Capaldi as Frobisher.  What a tragic figure he is.  I was hooked and at the end, I stand up for it but I certainly see why Torchwood fans are pissed.  Joss killed major characters in Serenity (my two favorite ones, no less) and although I was pissed, it didn't change the fact that Serenity was a great movie.  As Firefly was a great series.  And as Torchwood was a great series.  I know it had ups and downs and if you want to think C of E was a down, fine.  It certainly was a downer.  But I think it was well done.  I am anxious to see what Series 4 will be like.  I'll try it.  Without Captain Jack...well, we'll see.  He might be back.

Although there are aliens, the story is about the decisions made by politicians/leaders when the aliens,456 make horrific demands. This is a study in socal values,ethics and leadership. It is quite disturbing, as it should be. It is thought-provoking; staying with you long after you see the final credits. Children of Earth is about the psychology of leadership and decision-making. This is hard-core social/political leadership commentary, worthy of intellectual discussion and debate.

I feel like I have a much better understanding of who they really are and what motivates them to cling to one another, and to keep others at arms length.

I don't plan on adding this piece of drivel to my Torchwood collection and if series four happens thanks to CoE I won't be adding that one either.

I just can say that this isn't the CoE I was told it would be by the writers and creators all year long and I am extremely disappointed in them and the third series of TW.

3895904,5,B002BVYBJW,"Love it or Hate it, Torchwood: Children of Earth was a slam-bang ending to a phenominal series. Torchwood explored alot of rough territory: Death, Sex, Sacrifice, Love, Loss, Lonliness and Sense of Purpose. This was done expertly by the combination of a great cast and screenplays. Children of Earth, the finale to the current series (I expect Torchwood to be back soon) is a story in the same calibre as some of the best Torchwood tales of the previous seasons.

Torchwood is not Doctor Who. People die. It centers around a bunch of dysfunctional people, normal humans, defending the Earth against alien invasions and sometimes human ""monsters"". The show worked because the ""heroes"" all had flaws, including the main character, Jack Harkness, who is immortal who cannot die but is at times surrounded by death. Gwen Cooper, the other main character in the show, is dragooned into Torchwood but manages to humanize the organization and Jack as well - forcing him to deal with people, especially Gwen, on a more intimate level. The other characters all have some flaw that gets them into trouble (Ianto - he loves Jack, but Jack's lovers don't fare well. The Doctor - he didn't take life too seriously until it was taken away from him. The computer specialist - always out-of-place until she was in the wrong place at the wrong time for the last time.)

**SOME SPOILERS**

Consequently, this 5 part series finale centers around the same themes, including some particularly disturbing ""human monsters"". When an very alien race called the 456 arrives on Earth demanding children, it at first looked like it was time for Torchwood to go into action, but instead chaos ensues and Jack is left to make some truly horrible choices.

People have angrily written reviews scorning the writers for all the deaths, but if you think about it, the end makes alot of sense. Jack lives because he can't be killed (he does dies 5 million years later - in Doctor Who) and Gwen lives because she controlled her flaws and has a support system in the form of her husband. The ending had me applauding, it could not have been better.

Although some reviewers complain about the choices the characters make in the course of the story, I feel that the story itself and the events therein were the catalysts for these changes in character.

If you prefer your SciFi a little less dark, then I agree that this is not for you.

Lo & behold, I found that she'd discovered the infamous Torchwood. I've heard of it but never actually watched any of the episodes, so I was only roughly familiar with the characters. Evidently there was quite a bit that I missed out on but overall I was easily able to keep up with everything.

The series starts off with all of the children of earth going immediately still and silent. Of course Jack & company get wrapped up in the whole thing & eventually get put on a hit list by the government. I can't really type anything else without giving away more of the plot, but needless to say it's a decent plot line.

I really enjoyed watching this show although I really do wish that I'd known more about the show beforehand. (Which by the estimates of some of the viewers, this handicap of mine may have been a bonus because evidently it has some plot holes & such in it.) It's still fun to watch, especially when it comes to noticing the differences between US tv & UK tv.

I won't give any spoilers but Russell T. Davies phoned in a recycled plot that had nothing to do with the Torchwood many of us loved.  He then forced shifts in the inherent nature of these characters that I simply can not buy under any circumstances.  Never, Never, would Jack have behaved that way.

I loved the character of Captain Jack in Doctor Who and I had huge expectations when it first came out, but was somewhat disappointed. It did seem to reach its stride mid-way through series one which, to me, seemed comic-booky and cheesy. Series two was a big improvement, with the writers fine-tuning the formula and the characters a bit.

That being said, Torchwood: Children of Earth, is exactly what I had hoped for from the very beginning: dark, intelligent, mature, engrossing, well-written, and fast-paced. And I'll just say it, this ain't your run-of-the-mill Doctor Who story, with the grand hero sweeping in to save the day, and I truly applaud Russell T. Davies and the other writers for being utterly fearless with this third series. The choices faced and made by the characters are anguishing and heartbreaking indeed. Yes, there are some plot holes and inconsistencies, but the overall story and events are a harrowing experience from start to finish, and I happen to think this is one of the best, most effective stories in Davies' re-imagined Whoniverse. It's smart, thrilling ... but also, it's emotionally exhausting. You'll need a bit of a lie-down when it's all over.

John Frobisher, who really is the central character in this story, is brilliantly portrayed by Peter Capaldi; he is a man whose entire life has been in civil service to his country, suddenly thrust front and center by a government who sees him only as a dispensable pawn ~ who happens to be very good at what he does. You may not warm up to him completely at first, but by the end you will be heartbroken over his character and the underhanded injustice that he has been served.

The other performances were just as good. John Barrowman as Captain Jack gives us a nuanced, somewhat tortured portrayal of Jack that we have not seen before. In the first series, he was sort of a happy-go-lucky caricature that couldn't quite break free of the child-geared, Doctor Who mold, but matured a lot in the second series. With this third series, we understand the weight of his years lived, learn a little bit more about him, and feel a certain sadness every time he comes back to life, realizing what a miserable existence he's been cursed with.

Eve Myles and Kai Owen are their usual, perky selves as Gwen and Rhys, with some much needed levity in an otherwise dire set of circumstances. Gareth David-Lloyd, as Ianto Jones, could be said to be the weakest of the bunch, but I found his performance to be rather touching and heartfelt, especially when he realizes just how little he truly knows Jack. And as far as his relationship with Jack, it's a shame we don't see more same-sex stories like this, because the same-sex-ness of it is completely transcended by their affection for one another.

The story itself is downright creepy, especially with the manipulation of the children by the aliens, known only as the 456 (not to mention what the 456 actually want the children for), and humanity's inability to do anything about it. The political thriller side of this story is well-crafted and believable, as we watch the powers that be pull the strings and begin making decisions for the whole of humanity in the face of an unbeatable threat, whilst attempting to finagle their own lily-livered survival at the same time. And for me, watching the political posturing of these people made me wonder what our governments would do in an actual situation like this. Kind of a scary thought.

The finale is one of the worst, most shocking I've ever seen ~ right up there with the finale of Blake's 7 back in the 80s ~ and yet, it is one of the very best, even though it is quite disturbing to watch. But Davies, whether you like him or not, and I know a lot of people don't, doesn't pull any punches here, he makes no apologies, and as a writer myself, I absolutely love and admire that. It takes guts and a certain arrogance to bring your own creation, beloved by many, crashing to its knees, and he chose not to take the easy, politically correct way out, but instead serves up an ending that people will either despise or be enthralled by, but which ultimately carries an unforgettable impact that will leave you breathless and in shock.

It concludes leaving the future of Torchwood unresolved and in limbo, but I think all of us Whovians know exactly where Captain Jack will end up next ;). Where it goes after that is anyone's guess. But if this is the end of the series altogether, well, what a way to go!

In closing, all I can say is: Bravo, Mr. Davies! THIS is the Torchwood I've been waiting for! So, tuck the kiddies in bed, grab your hankie and buckle up! 'Cause it's one helluva ride!",1248566400,39,4776,4.65717674970344

And a sorry, sticky end for Capt. Jack Harkness, who did not deserve this plunge into oblivion. I didn't care much for the 1st Season of Torchwood; I'm not convinced it was true to its premise. But anyone who had a love of these characters should certainly remove Children of Earth from the Torchwood Canon. As for Davies, better he left Earth looking for his destiny than Capt. Jack!",1248480000,17,591,4.737864077669903
3895916,5,B002BVYBJW,"Obviously this series has people divided. One of the things that British television does is have no fear about killing off characters (See MI-5 or Primeval) and do it with emotion and drama.
Anyone who has followed the adventures of Captain Jack Harkness and his Torchwood compatriots know some of the drama and tragedy that has affected these characters in past seasons. This short but powerful Season 3 opens with Jack, Ianto and Gwen still mourning the loss of their friends and quickly evolves into a superb science fiction tale involving all of the children on earth reacting in similar fashion which creates havoc and concern on the planet. From here, it involves politics, good and evil, high drama, alien invasion, deep sadness, stunning revelations into the background of Captain Jack that have profound impact on the storyline, moments of sheer terror and surprising turns of event. In this 5 hours, I found myself on the edge of my seat many times and also ended up with tears in my eyes more than once. It takes a while to figure out why the children are reacting the way they are, what the alien's intent is and it is not a pretty tale. But no one can deny the powerful writing and execution. So, if you are looking for easy solutions and typical happy endings, then you may want to avoid ""Torchwood:Children of Earth"". But if you want to watch one of the most compelling miniseries ever produced, then settle in, pay attention and be prepared to be shocked and captivated. Intelligent television at it's very best. Knowing just a bit about the background of the Torchwood gang is helpful but not necessary to appreciate this wonderful show. It's truly a stand alone series that will capture your total attention.",1248480000,11,1726,4.775919732441472

3895918,5,B002BVYBJW,"Fans of the series might be interested in continuing the dead-end of the ""alien-of-the-week"" format, but I must say that ""Children of Earth"" is exactly the type of television that I've wished to see in Torchwood for the last three years.  I think that the show's creator had a lot more in mind for the series, but it was evident in the first season that the series was going to suffer from poor writing and a contrived plotline.  Put together a dash of racy sexual tension and loads of action, it might be right for some, but I always felt that the series was lacking.  Don't get me wrong.  I enjoyed the first two seasons.  I think that the second season started to get things in better order, but the series had some rough writing and a plotline that was way too predictable.  It just began to bore me.

That is not the case with this miniseries.  The writing was fantastic, and the directing and acting was some of the best I've seen on TV for years now.  Maybe it was because they had 5 hours to work with.  Maybe it was because they finally dove into the character's backgrounds a bit more.  Maybe it was because they left each episode on cliffhangers that are probably considered to be suicide for a TV series.  They deviated from the norm in most all respects with this series.  If it's not the character's love relationships, or an anti-hero that you can't decide if you love or hate...  It's the way that they ended things and gave us closure to a series that might have been somewhat lacking if it continued in its previous direction.

Many die-hard fans may not like what happened with Children of Earth, but I feel that it just scratches the surface with what BBC might bring us with future stories of Captain Jack Harkness.  It may not be ""Torchwood"" in its typical format, but there is a heck of a lot that can be done with this franchise in the future.

I commend the staff for taking this series (as a whole) and particularly this 5-part season in directions that most TV creators are afraid to go.  It's refreshing that they still care about good drama (especially sci-fi) in an age where drama and sci-fi are ignored in favor of reality TV.  Thanks for bringing us this 5-part series.  Even if it's the last we see of Torchwood, I'll be pleased with the way the series went out with a bang.

Some will hate this 5-part series.  I thought that it was fantastic.",1248480000,7,2378,4.418390804597701
3895919,5,B002BVYBJW,"I found the reviews that said it didn't hold true to the characters in the first two season a bit odd.  They are very much the same characters and we are allowed to get even closer to them, especially Capt. Jack.  And comments that it was darker than the others weren't watching the same season 2 I was.

Each episode was tense and built on to the next.  The last episode was painful to watch with our heroes unable to move freely about to do their work, and the governments total lack of regard for the children of the world, but ultimately they do save the day.  I didn't find Jack's stand from day 4 to day 5 about the loss of life a contradiction, I think it had more to do with the few for the many and there wasn't any way to avoid that.  I think the end is more about why he was chosen 40 years ago and how much he has changed since then.  He may have made the same decision, but lost everything in the process.  And he did see is grandson, just not as often as he would like, so he did have a relationship with him.  On a side note, it was nice that they didn't kill, stab or shoot Rhys.

The acting was brilliant.  Peter Capaldi was especially touching presenting the politician who does what he has to until it breaks him.  And those conversations of the government agencies - can't you just see that really happening?

I can't wait for season 4 and hope that they add Lois Habiba and Johnson to the cast.",1248480000,7,1415,4.13919413919414
3895920,1,B002BVYBJW,"As many others have said this story is full of contrivances and characters who, though the same name, are not the characters that we've come to know and love in Dr. Who and Torchwood Seasons 1 and 2. Instead these characters become cruel and heartless by the end of the feature.

***Spoilers below***

The show even contradicts itself within the mini-series. Day 4 Jack states that it is wrong to sacrifice the one for the many, however by Day 5 he turns around and knowingly kills a child, and not only a child but his own grandson (apparently this makes it better because Jack feels it more, except day 2 establishes that Jack really doesn't know his grandson since his daughter told him to stay away). This is apparently deemed good entertainment and ""necessary"" by many who viewed the show, however in my opinion is neither necessary (given the nature of the Who universe) nor heroic.

The series early on presents at least two possible ways to save the kid: 1, there is an old man who is in contact with the aliens who could have volunteered; and 2, the kid is Jack's grandson. Among all the other contrivances the writers didn't think to contrive the kid having at least some of Jack's healing ability?? No, instead it's considered a ""sacrifice"" to murder the one child in order to save millions.

The whole idea was disgusting, particularly given the nature of the show and the show's own early statements that it's NOT OK to sacrifice anyone to these aliens who for some strange reason are using the children as drugs (And seriously, how did the aliens come up with the idea to try human kids as drugs?). HEROES, true heroes, do NOT kill the innocent, if anyone dies it is the hero in self sacrifice.

I won't be watching this again and won't even consider buying it. A horrible ending to a decent (if at times dark) show.",1248480000,20,1830,4.567073170731708
3895921,5,B002BVYBJW,"To start off, I am NOT a huge fan of the series Torchwood. To me the show has come off as an overly melodramatic and violent version of the X-Files. It's had some fun but never reached the height of it's predecessor Dr. Who. This season completely changed that.

For one thing the story is much vaster in scope than anything Torchwood or even Dr Who has tried before. The plot is simple enough: Aliens come to earth threatening the planets children, but this is no typical ""we must save the children!"" mish-mash. Everything is played to believability by showing us the back-door politics of the government and their reactions as well as our usual Heroes. This season does have it's usual melodramatic moments (again sometimes OVERLY melodramatic) but none of these scenes can get in the way of the powerful scenes that will stay with you long after the final episode.

None of this would be possible of course without the powerhouse performances by it's talented cast. Acting has never been Torchwood's strong suit, but season regulars John Barrowman, Eve Myles and Gareth David-Lloyd have never been better. Equally good is Liz May Brice (powerful and chilling as a government assassin), Paul Copley (compelling and believable as an alien abductee), and especially Peter Capaldi who adds conviction and vulnerability as a government stooge forced to make some hard choices.

This season isn't perfect and some of it will probably be lost on people who've never seen Torchwood, but for fans and casual viewers this season is a MUST on DVD.",1248480000,8,1539,4.888888888888889
3895922,1,B002BVYBJW,"Torchwood fans should view Children of Earth with caution.  It is dark beyond anything in the previous series; Russell Davies uses COE as a format for his political views and by the end, Davies and the BBC seem to have given up on a successful spin-off, effectively ending the franchise.
The darkness of COE is understandable, given the premise, however, it is unrelenting and Torchwood fans may find the excellent acting and writing not enough to overcome the final blows.
Davies use of COE to air his political views is another matter.  He presents a wrenching societal dilemma in a very convincing manner, but in doing so, takes Torchwood away from its primary and previously popular format.  True, there are references to this darker side, especially in Series 2, however, viewers should be warned that COE takes this into new and probably catastrophic realms.
I will add this warning to my comments: I have never been a fan of Dr. Who, however, Torchwood appeared to be different; a more adult approach, characters that had depth, and a believable premise.  Most important, it appeared sustainable, if the writers were willing to cut most of the Dr. Who ties and strike out on their own.  Alas, this does not appear to be possible, as the Dr. Who franchise seems to be the driving force at the BBC, spelling the end of a wonderful science fiction premise.
My conclusion is to recommend Torchwood Series 1 and 2 but advise fans to beware Children of Earth.",1248480000,20,1460,4.777777777777778
3895923,5,B002BVYBJW,"WOW! really sums up TORCHWOOD: CHILDREN OF EARTH.  Audiences around the world will be held spellbound by this dark and horrifying miniseries.  I watched most of the episodes back-to-back - straight through in one sitting.  TORCHWOOD: CHILDREN OF EARTH kept me on the edge of my seat with a fantastic story, a break-neck pace, and heart-pounding suspense and tension.

TORCHWOOD: CHILDREN OF EARTH does exactly what all truly excellent science fiction does; it makes us question what it means to be human; question our own actions, words, and deeds.  In TORCHWOOD: CHILDREN OF EARTH, brilliant writer Russell T. Davies asks and answers the question ""Do the needs of the many out weight the needs of the few, or the one?"" And the answer is shocking, gut-wrenching, and absolutely heart-breaking.

The premise of TORCHWOOD: CHILDREN OF EARTH is truly every parent's worst nightmare - completely unimaginable except in our most horrific dreams.  The politicians portrayed here are the true monsters of the story, not the aliens (although they are a pretty dodgy crowd, themselves.)  The ""scenarios"" batted about the political leaders are disgusting.  It shows how little faith they have in human beings and the world.

The British have never been afraid to kill off main characters, change the direction of a beloved series, or recast a leading roll.  In many cases, this philosophy can infuse a series with new vigor, new fans, and better plot lines.  TORCHWOOD: CHILDREN OF EARTH is no exception.  We have lost main characters before and most likely will do so in the future.  Dr. Who, Primeval, Hex, and many other successful British series have gone through similar transformations.

Finally, IMHO, Captain Jack fans have nothing to fear.  He has gone on intergalactic walk-about before, and he has always come back, once he has resolved what he needs to resolve.  This one may take more time...a lot more time... but I believe he will return.  Gwen will carry on until he is ready - that is what she does.  Maybe with the help of Lois Habiba, who would be a nice a very addition to the cast.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1248480000,6,2113,4.932011331444759

Torchwood has matured from a hit and miss first season to a whiz-bang second and now to five episodes of ""oh, no they di-in't!""
Really effective storytelling will get you between the ribs and this is no exception. The best sci-fi tales are, in the end, an exploration of that which resides within. It doesn't take you long to realize that as creepy as the alien presence may be, the star is the ferocious human drama that unfolds achingly. Children of Earth chooses instead to focus on the glaring fact that it is ultimately the choices we make when we face our challenges that reveal who we are. None of these characters are completely innocent or guilty, just awfully and painfully human, their flaws laid bare by fear. This is a beautifully crafted rollercoaster ride into our dark side, definitely worth viewing.
****Non-specific spoilerage ahead:
With an amazing script, Russell T. Davies bravely and skillfully explores the uncomfortable question: at what point does humanity sell its soul for the illusion of safety? Not an original concept, but considering the decisions some of our world leaders have made in the last 10 years, certainly a relevant one. In the age of child soldiers and human trafficking, who needs aliens anyway?
And how exactly does one kill a man who can't die? Bombs, bullets, suffocation and disease don't work, so Children of Earth offers a cruel solution to the puzzle, which can apply to mortal and immortal alike. Some fans may be disappointed by the creative decisions that were made, but occasionally good drama will reflect the stormy and indiscriminate nature of life.
I believe RTD made risky but good calls in the pursuit of something special and decidedly more substantial than a flighty sci-fi show. He succeeded fabulously.",1248393600,4,1808,4.97029702970297

Russell T. Davies took the easy way out with the pathetic, ridiculous Deus ex Machina ending. There's such a vast amount of brilliant sci-fi novels that have never been made into movies, why churn out mediocre crap like this?",1248393600,16,795,4.852941176470588

Hey, folks, people die and things change. Get over it. So what if changes were made from the earlier series? That's life. Do you really want to see the same retreaded sets, characters and plotlines week after week? A program needs to adapt and change or it gets stagnant and dies--like most US series. They are so afraid to change anything--apparently for fear of offending ""fans"" like the ones who complained here--that their programs quickly become boring and redundant.

Do you remember the ""Midnight"" episode of ""Doctor Who"" where everything you expected from The Doctor and his human interrelationships was turned upside down? I suspect that was the concept behind this incarnation of ""Torchwood"". The old Torchwood just doesn't work anymore.

And the real villains here, folks, are NOT the aliens. The most chilling scene in this series is of human beings sitting around a table and discussing how best to choose the ""least able"" (that is the poor and helpless) to sacrifice. No US tv show would ever have scene this creepy--and true.

I DO have some problems with the logic of Jack's characterization--like why was he so ""uncaring"" forty years earlier? He doesn't seem noticably different in other flashback scenes, and his braindead ""Just Say No"" ultimatum in Part Four is really weird--but overall this is one of the best things I have seen on television in a very, very long time.

Other UK series, like ""Primeval"" and ""MI-5"" have also tried hard to bring reality into their storytelling and yet ""fans"" who ought to be the ones to applaud inventiveness are the first to complain. Go figure.

But I have a question. Was the mini-series edited in the US? BBCAmerica has an annoying habit of doing this? How complete will the dvd be? Is it the US version or the UK version?

By the way, the reason I only gave this 4 stars is because I haven't seen Part Five yet and they could still screw it up. Let's hope not.",1248393600,6,2054,4.723463687150838

There was none of the fun in it there had been in my series. If it's dullness wasn't enough, it was also full of ridiculous plot holes. Whether Russell T.

3895929,2,B002BVYBJW,"Was this good television? That is the question I struggle with about this miniseries. It was gripping television for the first three hours. And it made me care about a few characters. Unfortunately, they were not the Torchwood team members. In fact, lack of anything truly Torchwood-like is what makes this show a bit of an affront to the fans. The real insult, however, is what becomes of the team, which is just recovering from last season's devastating finale.

I should admit here that I am not one of the Torchwood faithful. I did buy S1 and S2 and watch every episode on DVD, but, to me, it was a cheeky sort of wannabe X-files. The show had casting and creative faults and a very uneven tone from episode to episode, but it had heart. You could watch it over and over again and have a good time with each viewing. Children of Earth rips out that heart, shreds it and stomps it into a pulp.

I felt the pain of these losses even though I wasn't technically moved by my own devotion to the fallen. The fact that this script depends on characters being complete idiots and is laboring under a plot riddled with holes the size of the crater left near Cardiff Bay is another matter entirely. It is this second matter that leads me to ask...Is this good television or just manipulative melodrama?

This is an old-fashioned miniseries, with cliffhangers every night, multiple plot lines and quite a few characters who aren't who/what you think they are. It's scary, paranoid, exciting, violent, complicated, amusing and bone-chilling at various times, sometimes at the same time. And oh yeah, it's dark.

In fact, it's actually a remake of an old BBC miniseries called Quatermass:  no credit is given to the original author, despite the fact that the plot has clearly been lifted; new characters have been added and the Torchwood group awkwardly pasted in--but, if you've ever seen Quatermass, you know exactly what's going to happen.
In addition, if you objected to the mature depiction of homosexuality/bisexuality in Torchwood, then this new version of Torchwood will please you no end:  the gay stereotypes abound and homophobia rules.

No one who likes Torchwood for its mix of dark humor, action, and romance or its interesting characters would not be well served to watch Children of Earth. There is little humor or hope here once things are set in motion (past Day 3) and one of the primary romantic relationships of the series does not survive (which has apparently enraged many a Torchwood fan both in the USA and the UK). The action sequences are the finest yet, but largely seem to be covering major plot holes that make the series more difficult to enjoy on second viewing. It seems that Children of Earth was merely a way for its creator to be done with the series, but with its massive ratings success in the UK and an almost certain fourth season, many of the program's fans are left asking what is left of Torchwood to continue with.",1248048000,32,1116,4.422330097087379
3895937,5,B002BVYBJW,"No spoilers for the plot!

While there are many reasons why I want to hurt Russel T. Davies, Children of Earth is not one of them. The entire series was incredibly well-put together. I was on the edge of my seat through the whole thing. Yes, it is a lot darker than Torchwood has ever been before. No it's not the same Torchwood that we know and love. Something incredibly unexpected happened and the crew of Torchwood had to adjust. There's nothing far-fetched about that. I miss having all five of the team around, but I am eager to see what comes next. Don't think this is the end of Torchwood!",1247961600,9,597,4.378378378378378
3895938,1,B002BVYBJW,"CoE starts with an interesting premise. All the children of the earth stop. They become broadcast antennae for an alien race, the 456, who, we later find out are a menace from the past. Torchwood is hindered in their job of dealing with them by a massive government coverup. Ultimately, one man's heartwrenching sacrifice saves the human race.  That makes for decent television.  Nothing dramatic, but a nice way to kill a few hours.

Slap the name Torchwood on it, obliterate your main set, remove them from the city they were formed to protect, slaughter half your cast, leave your leader so gutted he has to flee the planet, keep the least likeable, utterly ordinary, mind-numbingly boring main character (not a bad actor, just written that way), and what have you got?

I don't know, but it isn't Torchwood Series Three.

If you're a Torchwood fan, you can only view Children of Earth as the series finale.  There is nowhere to go with what is left.

If you are new to Torchwood, Children of Earth might be a decent one-off, but the bits of backstory and character relationships they explore in days one through three will seem totally random and really not sufficient to explain certain events in days four and five.

If you feel you must see it, just rent it.",1247961600,25,1265,4.666666666666667
3895939,1,B002BVYBJW,"I've been a fan of Torchwood from it's first episode.  I enjoyed the first two seasons.  I knew from the very beginning of Children of Earth that while it might have some of the same actors as my beloved series playing characters dressed and named like ones I loved it wasn't the same.  There was none of the fun in it there had been in my series.  If it's dullness wasn't enough, it was also full of ridiculous plot holes.  Whether Russell T. Davies some time announces he intended it to be an alternate universe, that is certainly how it felt to me.  I hated it, but it did give me incentive to revisit my Torchwood.",1247875200,18,618,4.2844827586206895
3895940,1,B002BVYBJW,"Start by killing off two main characters in the 2nd season.  Then wait a really long time before you release any semblance of 3rd season.  Then, exterminate one more main character and alienate another.  What do you have left?  Eve Myles, just waiting for the Doctor to come along and whisk her away as his new companion.  Bye Bye Torchwood.

If this could be given less than one star, I'd certainly do it.  The story and acting were phenomenal until the end of the 4th hour.  Then the whole thing totally Jumped The Shark and went straight down the crapper.

What a terrible loss and a complete waste of time for everyone involved.",1247875200,31,632,4.522123893805309
3895941,5,B002BVYBJW,"Children of Earth is a fabulous piece of drama, one of the best to air on the BBC in a long time. I can easily say this puts previous seasons of Torchwood and all episodes of Doctor Who in its shadow.

Truly, it was excellent, which is why I've given it a five-star-rating.

Unfortunately it also left me heartbroken and I very much doubt that I'll be able to give any subsequent seasons the same level of emotional involvement. I was a massive fan of this show. I bought all the books and plays and toys and I attended the conventions and had my photo taken with the stars. All that is over now. Torchwood will be just another show.",1247875200,12,633,4.266666666666667
3895942,2,B002BVYBJW,"I've been a Torchwood fan since the first time I watched it. Sometimes it was great, sometimes it made me cringe, but all in all it delivered what it promised. It was funny, it was full of adventure and heroics, it was an hour of old fashion sci fi.
So, going to Torchwood 3. Besides the major plot holes in the whole story - why would they blow up the Hub instead of using it after killing the team? why kill the team at all, when they could be contain (meaning
Jack)? why nobody went after the strange man in Glasgow? why wasn't Martha called back from her honeymoon? why, being Torchwood what
it is, didn't have any more liasons in UNIT? why Jack being who he is, and how long he's been around, didn't have anyone else to call
besides Martha? and I could keep going - what bothered me the most was the character assasination. Ok, they were good characters
these ones in Torchwood 3, but they weren't the ones in the other two seasons. Lets focus on Jack and his stupid mistakes, I'll let the
others go. This was a man who fought two world wars, and hundreds of little ones, you want me to believe that he didn't have anymore guns or weapons or alien tecnology stashed somewhere in case everything went FUBAR? A man who had a laser up his bum in Dr Who first season suddenly
became senile and forgot about everything he've learned in his hundreds of years alive. And he kept going, making stupid mistake after stupid mistake just to keep the story going. The Jack from the other seasons
wouldn't have made half of them.
So, maybe, for some, this was good television. I grant the fact that if you don't think too much the pace sweeps you of your feet and makes your blood pump. The baddies are bad, the politicians are nasty,
the decisions are though, but all in all, it wasn't Torchwood.
People say that a show is allowed to change, sure, but this story wasn't exactly a change, this story was another thing altogether. This
story would have worked perfectly on its own, without the need of the Torchwood team to suffer for it. Any other set of characters
and it would  have been good to go. I'm only guessing that the producers wanted it done and they use the name of Torchwood to sell it. I know I wouldn't have watched it if it weren't for the fact that it was Torchwood: Children of Earth. If I'd known it was a political sci fi thriller with a dark twist, I wouldn't have even turned on my TV.",1247788800,24,2400,4.321507760532151
3895943,2,B002BVYBJW,"If you are a fan of Torchwood, Children of Earth may come as a shock. It's strength is that it is an interesting, action packed political/science fiction thriller. The ending is visually powerful .... and extraordinarily depressing. Unfortunately, the contrivances and leaps in logic that move the plot to the finish just do not hold up in repeating viewing.

I've seen this plotline before in the last series of Quatermass, and while the premise was reworked, it also seemed throughout as though the characters and Torchwood itself had been hammered to fit the plotline, resulting in a miniseries that would have been better as a stand-alone, without Torchwood. Unfortunately, the quirkiness and fun that was Torchwood has been sacrificed to make it more of a generic 'Spooks' type thriller, leaving it far, far darker and grimmer than the first two series.

And, it's time Russell T. Davies moved beyond the same old one-trick pony shock where the team is concerned. There are things that series writers can pull off once. After that these plot devices become not only redundant, but downright tiresome. I was engrossed in the story right up to the surprising cliffhanger of Day Three. After that, the inconsistencies and plot devices that were needed for the big finish became too strained for credibility, particularly for a longtime viewer who was familiar with the characters pre-Children of Earth.

I gave it two stars, and I wish I could have given it more for the acting which was excellent, particularly John Barrowman, Gareth David-Lloyd, Nicholas Farrell and Peter Capaldi. In truth, it was Frobisher's (Capaldi) story and the story of the government's response to an alien threat, more than it was Torchwood's, except for the last hour which anguishing and bleak.",1247788800,95,1776,5.075342465753424
3895944,1,B002BVYBJW,"This miniseries is downbeat, depressing, and so full of massive plotholes that I would not recommend it.  Very little thought seems to have gone toward the writing of this very un-Torchwood storyline, with characters killed off as nothing but a plot device for dramatic effect.  The only saving grace in this depressing mess are the phenomenal acting performances given by Gareth David-Lloyd as Ianto and John Barrowman as Captain Jack.  Save your money and buy seasons one and two instead.",1247788800,24,490,5.1
3895945,4,B002BVYBJW,"In 1965 the British government had a shadowy series of contacts with an advanced alien species known only as the '456' (four-five-six), named after the radio frequency they used. The results of that contact were classified, but involved twelve children being handed over to them for purposes unknown. Unbeknown to the government, one of those children escaped and has grown up haunted by his memories of that experience.

In 2010 all the children in the world simultaneously stop and announce, ""We are coming."" The governments of the world investigate, as do the members of Torchwood, an organisation based in Cardiff designed to investigate alien threats to Earth. However, when Torchwood comes close to exposing the secrets of forty-five years earlier, the government outlaws the group and tries to have them eliminated. Civil servant Mr. Frobisher is put on the front line by the Prime Minister as he has to negotiate with the aliens, who have indeed returned...

When Torchwood launched in 2006, it was billed as Doctor Who's more adult, darker cousin. Broadcast after 9pm on BBC-3, it was supposed to take the Whoniverse in a new and more interesting direction. Unfortunately, it appeared at the time that 'darker' and 'more adult' actually translated as 'some swearing' and 'everyone on the cast is gay (kind of)'. Season 1 of Torchwood is at times borderline unwatchable. Season 2 started moving in the right direction, with some better writing and some blatant-but-amusing fanservice (James 'Spike' Marsters from Buffy and Angel as another time agent who naturally cops off with Captain Jack), but it still wasn't fulfilling its mission statement.

With the third season, the BBC decided to try something different. With Doctor Who off the air for the year (four TV specials aside), they decided to not only promote Torchwood to primetime BBC-1 status, but to turn it into a five-hour mini-series airing across one week. With a level of serialisation unmatched by anything that Doctor Who has done since its return in 2005 and with producer Russell T. Davies able to exert more influence over the project (as his tenure on Who winds down and Steven Moffatt gears up to take over), it was hoped that the series would finally take off. Fans were sceptical, but intriguing trailers and a steady drip-feed of news items from the BBC convinced a lot of people to tune in and give the show the benefit of the doubt.

And, against all the odds, it worked. Torchwood: Children of the Earth, as it has been dubbed, has won more acclaim than anything else related to new Doctor Who since its return four years ago. It moves with a ferocious sense of purpose, more like 24 than anything else, and its long running time allows characters to be explored more thoroughly and the storyline to unfold more logically than in the regular 45-minute episodes. They also got in some experienced scriptwriters from shows like Spooks to help work on the structure and tone of the mini-series. It genuinely is now adult. Ianto and Jack's relationship is portrayed more naturally and in keeping with the story rather than for any sensationalist reasons. Mr Frobisher's arc is stunningly well-handled, with guest star Peter Capaldi (the angel Islington from Neverwhere, among many other fine roles) giving an astonishing and award-worthy performance above and beyond the call of duty.

The mini-series doesn't pull any punches. Whilst the conclusion to the story is a little contrived (featuring RTD's preferred resolution of characters talking technobabble and pounding intently on keyboards until some fancy CGI kicks in), it isn't without cost. This isn't a neat ending at all and leaves quite a few of the characters seriously mentally scarred for life. The tone is pretty bleak, with only a few rays of sunshine allowed to appear at the end.

It isn't all great. The music for new Who and Torchwood has always been jarringly out of place and too loud in the mix, and it's still the same in this series. There's also a lot of shots of the characters running around various corridors and streets which sometimes seem to have been dropped in to make up the running time, but this is actually much reduced from its normal prevalence in the regular episodes. The story also requires the British government (and many of the other world governments) to behave in a snivelling and cowardly manner which led me to ponder if the writers were trying to make some kind of political point. I like to think the human race is better than Children of Earth makes us out to be. But these problems are minor.

Torchwood: Children of Earth (****) is a shockingly good piece of British SF, easily the best thing to come out of the new Doctor Who since its return in 2005 and maybe the best slice of British TV SF since 1998's Ultraviolet. It is fast-paced, genuinely adult, asks hard questions and doesn't skimp on the answers and features some brilliant writing and acting.",1247616000,9,4941,4.90311004784689
3895946,5,B002BVYBJW,"This is a searing series, difficult and uncomfortable to watch, and first-rate in almost every way.  The core of the story asks a question humanity has grappled with since the dawn of the species, ""How do you make a decision when all the outcomes are bad?""  It's uncomfortable viewing, but the story, acting, and cinematography are well worth it.",1247443200,14,346,4.8474576271186445
3895947,5,B002BVYBJW,"For the first two series Torchwood was your standard solve the horrible situation of the week series but that all changed with series three. First and foremost, the bigggest difference is that there are only five episodes instead of the usual 12 but that is because all five episodes comprise one mini-series mega event where the BBC showed one episode each weeknight during a single week as opposed to one show a week. Those are the minor technical differences and here are the stylistic differences.

Previous incarnations of Torchwood were a mix of frivolity, political thriller, and science fiction while series three puts the political thriller aspect front and center with the jokes and scifi taking supporting roles. The tone is emotionally taut, psychologically upsetting, and decidedly dark--all perfect motifs for a show designed only for adults. If you are wanting a Dr. Who style trip into the imagination where you get a bit scared but return with a smile on your face this is not going to be to your liking at all because this time Torchwood takes us into a nightmare realm where many of the humans in charge seem more alien and threatening than the actual aliens, who are definitely scary themselves, and that insures you won't return from  this journey with a smile unless you're a sadistic freak. Does the darkness overwhelm the show? Not at all! As I said the political thriller aspect is front and center and its pacing almost feels like this is Torchwood 24, especially seeing how each episode represents one day of time so that by the end of this series only five days have passed for the Torchwood crew.

Should you buy Torchwood series 3? Well if you are more of a fan of Dr. Who and only watch Torchwood because it is a Who spin-off I'd wait and watch it as it airs to make sure it isn't too realistic to be enjoyable for you. If you prefer Torchwood over Dr. Who then definitely put your order in as you're not likely to be disappointed with the direction RTD has taken the show this time. Personally, this has been the best science fiction on the small or large screen this year (I haven't seen Moon yet so that could change) and keep in mind I am a huge Trekkie and adored the new Star Trek movie! That's right, a die hard Trekkie said Torchwood series 3 was better than Star Trek the Reboot. Granted, Trek had better blockbuster visuals and space battles but Torchwood, by far, told the better story. I also think the acting was better in Torchwood than Trek although there isn't as big as a distance between the two as there was in plot quality.",1247356800,190,2574,4.603485838779957

However, Children of Earth, the third series is shorter and more emotional. This series fixes what I did not like from the first two runs. It is better. It is remarkably better. I like how the emotional stakes and moral questioning are improved in this series.
I do not know if this run would make any sense at all without first viewing at least some of the earlier episodes. Although it might, central team that knows something no one else knows and can save the day is fairly straight forward. Jack might take some back ground knowledge, and his relationship to the mysterious Ianto might take some background knowledge. It might work.
