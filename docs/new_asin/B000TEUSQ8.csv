2896533,5,B000TEUSQ8,"I have always loved nature films since a kid so when I saw Planet Earth on Discovery channel I recorded them on our dvr. Well they don't stay there forever when your husband hits the delete button. So when I saw this set I was thrilled. I didn't realize how many episodes I missed. I can watch them over and over (My husband will watch them once). I show them when I have company over the house. Even though I didn't buy the HD set,(I don't have a HD DVD player) I have a HD tv and they still look incrediable. This is one DVD set every home should have.",1197417600,12,554,4.045454545454546
2896534,5,B000TEUSQ8,It is a very good price for the buy but beware IT IS NOT THE ONE YOU SAW AT THE DISCOVERY CHANNEL ! The images are the same but the music and narrator are different and it is my opinion that this combination makes it a little boring. I prefer the one from Discovery channel I think it is more exciting narrator and music.,1196640000,54,321,4.03125
2896535,5,B000TEUSQ8,"I watched many Planet Earth episodes on TV and when the combined series came out, I bought them in a heart beat.
Everytime I watched an episode, I felt an overwhelming sense of appreciation of this rich and spectacular place we live in and a strong conviction of helping to make sure that the beauty and the uniqueness of this place is preserved and cared for. The people who made these two series deserve the best credit for their high artistic standard, great technical execution and genuine communication of the facts.",1196208000,82,521,4.736263736263736
2896536,5,B000TEUSQ8,"the combination of planet earth and blue planet is excellent. diaries show how hard BBC team have struggled to shoot some of the rarest animals... hats off to them!!..
also its pathetic to know that all these rare animals moving towards extinction.
quality of video is excellent, but the dvds arrived bit late, may be because this was just the start of this combination dvds.",1195084800,10,375,4.7846153846153845
2896537,5,B000TEUSQ8,"These images are breathtaking in scope. Brilliant in execution.

The techniques used at the various remote locations belie a never before seen meeting of technology, global rarity, and the epitome of loving ones work. Even if you only see them aired digitally, you'll want to own and then share these movies with anyone able to benefit from a growing awareness of the unique and varied life on this planet.",1193616000,12,406,4.884057971014493
2896538,5,B000TEUSQ8,I have always been a big fan of planet earth seeing it on tv. Before finding this listing I had never heard of blue planet. But I was amazed by it as well as planet earth. Great buy :),1193270400,10,184,3.7435897435897436
2896539,5,B000TEUSQ8,I can watch this series over and over and still not get tired of it. Would really recommend it. Some of the shots are so stunning and it makes you appreciate the incredibly diverse world of animals and plants that we share our world with.,1446681600,,238,4.311111111111111

2896542,5,B000TEUSQ8,"I bought this as a gift for my nature-loving dad.  He has always enjoyed watching shows surrounding history and nature.  This is a great collection to have on hand and binge watch when you are craving a look into the world.  We found that there is a great range in subjects and they are wonderfully documented.  There was not too much ""gore"" of animals hunting which my mom was happy about so that she can enjoy the episodes as well.  Great purchase and highly recommend to anyone that enjoys this type of programming.  I have not been able to find anything else that can truly compete to the same scope and subject matter on any streaming service.",1442534400,,648,4.495726495726496

2896576,5,B000TEUSQ8,"This is by far the best nature documentary there is out there. They took the time (years) to get the footage of the animals no one else has ever filed. The followed them for days, weeks, months just to see what would happen, The footage is beautiful and breathtaking. The range of animals is wonderful. My daughter absolutely loved it. Planet Earth has 5 discs of animals from the plains, jungles, rain forests, savannas, from every continent. The Blue Planet has 5 discs of purely ocean footage. Deep sea, tidal ocean, northern seas, and everything in between.",1396656000,,561,4.793814432989691
2896577,5,B000TEUSQ8,Planet Earth has inspired me to live (that sounds corny) but it is truly fascinating to see the nature available to us. The visuals are phenomenal and awe-inspiring. LOVE IT!,1389052800,,174,4.833333333333333
2896578,5,B000TEUSQ8,"A must have for nature documentaries enthusiasts! It explores so much more than animals land or seas, but also the people in it. Hence, its called planet earth. Such an amazing series. Get the one narrated by David Attenborough. Anyone else fails compares to his narration.",1387670400,,273,4.956521739130435
2896579,5,B000TEUSQ8,"It is wonderful to be able to sit in the comfort of my home and learn so much about the planet that I live on.  I have a lot of respect for the photographers who have captured these amazing segments of things that I will never see other than through their eyes.
We lost part of the discs, but didn't want to not have the complete set in our home, so we bought a used set and have it available to watch when nothing is good on TV",1387065600,,428,3.8636363636363638
2896580,5,B000TEUSQ8,These videos are absolutely breathtaking and indispensable for training kids about the wonders of the world. Get your kids off Spongebob and onto these once in awhile. Well worth it.,1386806400,,182,5.1
2896581,5,B000TEUSQ8,This is one get great documentary set. I always look to buy the ones with David Attenborough narrating because he just tells a better story and his voice just goes so much better with the documentary than Oprah or Morgan Freeman. Me and my wife watched this over the course of a weekend and I have to say we were glued to the screen the entire time. The shots that are shown are amazing. This would make one great gift and I would not hesitate to buy again.,1381708800,,457,4.204545454545454

2896583,5,B000TEUSQ8,"This series will take the viewer to exquisite places on this planet you could never possibly get to see or learn about in a better way!!!  If you haven't seen it yet, you really owe it to yourself and your loved ones to purchase this and view it over and over again!  David Attenborough has a very rich voice which is very pleasant.  You just never get tired of it!",1371772800,,365,4.185714285714286

2896585,5,B000TEUSQ8,"This is a great series. Beautiful footage and for anybody concerned about the theory of evolution being crammed down your throat, when choosing a nature program, this one is only makes brief allusions to it, which is very refreshing.",1366243200,,233,5.0
2896586,5,B000TEUSQ8,I bought this series for a friend for Christmas and we watched a few episodes and I knew right then that I needed to purchase it for myself. I absolutely love this series! AMAZING!,1363824000,,180,4.323529411764706
2896587,5,B000TEUSQ8,"This was recommended to me by a friend, and i have to say, BBC Earth's series are quickly becoming a favorite. Currently own Africa, Frozen Planet, Planet Earth, and Blue Planet. Tried to watch another series about the Coral reefs, but it wasn't BBC Earth and definitely showed. Attenborough all the way!",1363392000,,304,4.865384615384615
2896588,5,B000TEUSQ8,My husband and I love to watch these.  It's hard to imagine how the photographers were able to get such amazing pictures!,1359504000,,121,4.5
2896589,5,B000TEUSQ8,My son has a degree in wildlife conservation and fisheries and asked for this set for his collection. The photography is amazing. As he also scuba dives seeing so much ocean life is so exciting for him. This makes one appreciate our planet so much more and encourages one to be more aware of our environemental footprint.,1359244800,,321,4.649122807017544
2896590,5,B000TEUSQ8,"I love these two series. I repeatedly watch them, and every time I am blown away at how wonderful they are.",1357776000,,107,4.142857142857143
2896591,5,B000TEUSQ8,"These are very well done series aired on PBS. Photography, music and narration all done with real class.  We have watched them numerous times and my kids have borrowed them to watch with their kids.",1355875200,,198,4.6571428571428575
2896592,5,B000TEUSQ8,"These are incredible videos.  They are almost a religious experience for me, not because I am an earth worshiper but I marvel at the acts of God which are only now being revealed.  These videos simply marvel at the natural world that is without many evolutionary or environmentalist quips.

The cinematography is a joy.  The gimbel mounted camera on a helicopter gets some shots that are very memorable.",1355788800,,403,4.882352941176471
2896593,5,B000TEUSQ8,"It's my personal belief that Blue Planet, and its like, should be required viewing for sixth or seventh grade students. If I had a child, s/he would be watching it earlier than that. I think it does a fantastic job showing the viewer where and how we fit into the world, and what our impact is and might become. Experiencing this series is humbling for those who are open to feeling that emotion; but may be considered propaganda to those who are not. Today's world could stand a dose of humility.",1344384000,,497,4.472527472527473
2896594,5,B000TEUSQ8,"Excellent programs.  How do they ever get these amazing shots?  Can watch over and over again.

Good narration with subtitle option available.  Good background music.  No issue at all with narration being to soft (mentioned in some reviews).  Will buy  a set to give to my nephew this X-mas.",1329696000,,291,4.816326530612245
2896595,4,B000TEUSQ8,"This magnificent collection of oceanography is a delight to the eyes and to the spirit.  The entire time I was watching it, I was worshiping our Creator.  At one point, I was so awestruck I asked Him out loud, ""How did you even THINK of this stuff?!""  Dazzling and limitless is the mind of our God.

The first part - ""the abyss"" - was the most intriguing to me, and I wish that they'd spent more time exploring the deeps.  Even the underwater mountain ranges and active volcanoes were so fascinating.  Some of the footage acquired of this animal life was so spectacular I really wondered how they even managed to capture it.

One of the few shortcomings of the documentary was that the narrator - while I think he mostly did an excellent job - spoke in such low, demure tones that at the end of sentences, I often had a hard time hearing his words.  More than once I had to back up the DVD to understand what he was saying.  But, this was a minor point.

****WARNING: SPOILER****There was one part of the documentary that actually I found disturbing: all the coverage of killer whales.  When they first showed these orcas trying to overtake and separate a gray whale calf from its mother, I was almost in tears (and I am not an animal-lover!).  Then, the very last scene of the documentary, which they ended with, was the killer whales coming in onto the beaches to kill baby sea lion pups.  What really bothered me was how, for reasons unknown, they drove the pups out to sea, not even to eat them, but rather to toy with them, tossing them up in the air and throwing them back and forth FOR 30 MINUTES until the poor creature was half-dead.  I was almost sick to my stomach. (This then brought to mind all the human deaths by these beasts, and I've really grown to dislike them!).  Now, when I see stuff about saving the Killer Whales, I think ""why?""  The rest of the animal kingdom would be glad for their extinction.",1325721600,,1920,4.396600566572238
2896596,5,B000TEUSQ8,"I got this for my boyfriend and it was the perfect gift. He loves it. There are so many discs and it is so interesting. The video is breathtaking, there are so many amazing shots from a great white shark jumping out of the ocean to going deep into unexplored caves.",1321574400,,265,4.215686274509804
2896597,5,B000TEUSQ8,"I love BBC's nature shows, and this is such a great combination! After having watched them all, I still like to put it on the tv to have something pretty to look at while I'm cleaning or whatever. It's also very good educational tv if you have older kids, but I wouldn't reccomend it for the little ones as it does show animals eating each other, sometimes pretty graphically.",1320105600,,376,4.463768115942029
2896598,5,B000TEUSQ8,"I can't believe I got this much high quality entertainment for such a reasonable price. Since  I am a painter specializing in interpretations of nature, this set provides hours of inspiration and shows me things I never knew existed. Just phenomenal photography.",1317254400,,262,5.238095238095238

2896602,5,B000TEUSQ8,I got this for my daughter who is college.  She basically wanted money for Christmas.  But when I got her this she watched most of it over break!  It is a home run gift!  Shipped promptly as well.,1294790400,,196,4.078947368421052
2896603,5,B000TEUSQ8,"Looks like this combo has DVD format. I can find Planet Earth series in blue ray, but not this Planet Earth + Blue Planet, nor could I find Blue Planet in Blue Ray format.

PS. Ordered it anyway on Dec 07 of 2010. I used 2 day shipping, but as of today (12/10/2010), the order will not be shipped until 12/22/2010. How can Amazon do this? We will be out for vacation from Dec19, nobody will be home to receive the item.",1291593600,,419,4.109756097560975

2896607,5,B000TEUSQ8,"I am amazed at the ability of the photographers to get some of the incredible scenes you'll see. For each program, their ""diaries"" section details some of the difficulties they had getting extremely rare shots, including access to places no one may ever be allowed to visit again and behavior of animals so endangered they many not make it to the halfway point of this century. I love these DVDs. There is so much information that you will get something new from every viewing. Yes, they have a strong save-the-environment message but I am completely on board with it.",1278460800,2,568,4.747474747474747
2896608,5,B000TEUSQ8,It's a great production.  You can just go on seeing episode after episode non-stop.,1275177600,,83,4.928571428571429

2896610,5,B000TEUSQ8,"As a kid my uncle used to send BBC1 airings of Wildlife which I absolutely loved and still do.  When I was home last I came across some 20/30 min promos of Blue Planet which I watched and each left me wanting more, my mum saw me watching one and said she would've liked the Blue Planet whereby she could watch the whole thing rather than just bits soooo for me that was her birthday present sorted!
I got this double set which was Blue Planet AND Planet Earth because it was a little cheaper than getting Blue Planet on its own.  Havent been disappointed - Mum said its one of the best pressies she ever got (even though I was alittle naughty and watched them before I sent it home  :-)!!)
As I remember there are 5 discs in each set with two or three 'episodes' on each disc with the fifth disc holding special features/bonus stuff.  What made it extra special (I think) was that after each episode there was a little documentary of how they made it.  Like with the Birds of Paradise they built huts at special locations and waited for days for 'action' and then when it happened there was a branch in the way - how they had to cope with that and how they followed a komodo dragon hunt (the dragons attacked a buffalo and then followed it for days waiting for it to die and the cameramen followed the dragons...)
Basically some really intriging, shocking, informative material that'll having you smiling and teary eyed at the same time.  A must for the collection of any wildlife fan.",1269734400,,1485,4.381818181818182
2896611,5,B000TEUSQ8,"I loved watching this series on TV, and I'm even happier that I can see it whenever I want. These DVDs are something that anyone can watch over and over again. I can't get over the videography; such amazing, awe-inspiring visuals. You don't even realize you're learning at the same time as being entertained and stunned. The quality of the these two series as a whole can be enjoyed on any size TV as well, unless you're lucky enough to experience it in HD. Highly recommended.",1269475200,,477,4.558139534883721
2896612,4,B000TEUSQ8,"Found the set to be informative but very redundant, at least to me. I viewed the DVD's on my seventy three inch Mistubishi DLP TV with a studio audio system for sound. I found that the audio was mediocre, some parts were soft then would blast out loudly and vice versa, I found myself turning the volume up to hear what the narrator what saying then to turn it down because the background sounds or soundtrack would become overwhelming. The video quality differed from each DVD and also from each episode down to the different chapters which was irritating. Some scenes would be absolutely beautiful and breathtaking, others would be heavily pixiled and not very well defined, poor quality for even a standard definition DVD. It was like they took clips from other shows and mixed them together with a few new clips and slapped them on a DVD. I also feel that the show was very redundant. I found myself ""skipping"" scenes because they were almost identical to scenes I just watched before. I enjoyed the experience overall but was somewhat disappointed because if they would have not have been so redundant they could have included a wider variety of all different animals. I feel that when it came to birds, dolphins, and whales that I was watching the same thing over and over again which becomes boring and hard to keep focused on. While very educational and well put together, something that retails for eighty dollars could have been put together and done alot better than what it is currently. A good starter collection I would say and a decent buy of no more than forty dollars (I paid thirty five for a new version from amazon). All in all a good set to own and am somewhat satisfied.",1269043200,4,1692,4.6245847176079735

2896616,5,B000TEUSQ8,"I grew up watching every nature show I could and, though I still enjoy them, I'd grown pretty jaded thinking nothing would ever really amaze me like it did when I was a kid.  These series (and the ""earth"" movie that is a collection of just a few stories from the Planet Earth series) have amazed me.  They are simply excellent in every way and I feel like a kid again watching them.",1265932800,,382,4.219178082191781

2896621,5,B000TEUSQ8,I purchased the DVD set as a Christmas gift for my husband who had mentioned he would enjoy owning the Blue Planet series. I am very glad I opted for the set that included both the Blue Planet and Planet Earth. The scenery and photography are spectacular and the narration is entertaining and educational. Our family and extended family have quickly grown to love watching the series. We get requests from the 5-year old and 70-year old members to watch the Planet DVDs versus a regular new-release movie. And you have the added bonus of not feeling guilty for sitting in front of the TV for an hour or two because everyone is learning! The DVD set was a great buy.,1263254400,,665,4.5041322314049586

2896623,5,B000TEUSQ8,"My wife gave this set for Christmas and I am watching on my 27"" iMac.  It is awesome.  Most of us have seen parts of this program on TV, so I don't need to sell you on the beauty of the series.  I was given the BBC version the narrator is David Attenborough, he is so good. This is one of the very few DVD's I believe is a ""collectable"".  I don't have HD but that should be even better.",1262995200,,386,3.7875

Although I have owned a copy for sometime, I learned that my sister-in-law was saving all the episodes on the DVR at her house and driving my brother nuts! She loves it, my family loves it, and I have yet to find someone who thinks otherwise. I also recommend other BBC DVDs such as their Natural History Collection.

2896628,5,B000TEUSQ8,I ordered Planet Earth & the Blue Planet on DVR.  It came in a timely manner and in perfect condition.  Unfortunately I can't say whether it works as it is a Christmas present but it looked in perfect condition in the box.  I read previous reviews that helped me as to what series to choose.,1261353600,,291,4.254545454545455
2896629,5,B000TEUSQ8,"25+ years ago video rental stores had a good ""documentaries"" sections, and my family and I wore out the VHS tapes from Nat Geo, Mutual of Omaha and others. That's the kind of stuff I'm used to.

I had seen some of these episodes on the Discovery Channel, so when I found them on Amazon, I pounced.  You see, I'm recreating my childhood for my children, now...

I can't say much that hasn't already been said, but I will tell you that I still watch these DVDs, and I have done so for several months.  Will it get old?  Maybe at some point it will, but I doubt it.

As far as my children go (8, 6 & 3 yrs old), they actually prefer the old Mutual of Omaha VHS tapes that I also have.  The tapes are more story-oriented than the Planet Earth segments.

As for me, these DVDs are my in-home escape. They are a naturalist's vacation in a box.  And, for me, the Attenborough versions are better than the Weaver ones. As an American, it is fascinating to hear the voice and perspective of a non-citizen describe the features, flora and fauna of my beloved country.

My only regret... I have neither a Blu-Ray player nor a high-def TV, so I bought the standard DVDs. I can only imagine what the high-def versions must be like...",1260403200,,1220,4.288209606986899
2896630,5,B000TEUSQ8,Now this is a great gift to friends.  Beautiful and full of facts.  The Photography is fantastic.  A must for people who don't know the waters of our Planet.  Maybe they will see why we need to save it.,1257206400,,202,4.102564102564102

2896632,4,B000TEUSQ8,"Very happy with the Planet Earth set.  Everything as expected: HD with bonus feature at the end of each episode.  However, rather disappointed with the Blue Planet series.  Did not realize that this is just a SD DVD.  Not only that, no subtitle.  Watching it on my 58-in plasma TV is worse than on my old 36-in SD TV.  This did not do justice to the amazing videography of the happenings in the ocean.  Overall, superb contents on both series, highly recommend.  But I skipped the 5th/last DVD of the Planet Earth set because it was just annoyingly preachy, more than my taste can tolerate.  I recommend purchasing these 2 sets separately and make sure that both are HD, which I plan to re-purchase the Blue Planet series.",1255564800,12,722,4.578125
2896633,5,B000TEUSQ8,I purchased these DVD's for my wife's birthday.  She is very happy with the clarity and closeness of the small species in the sea. The color is wonderful.,1254873600,,154,4.5

Very informative and able to keep the attention of young viewers as well as the interest of the adults. Definately recommend to anyone.",1252886400,,204,5.029411764705882
2896635,4,B000TEUSQ8,"We watches most of them and loved them.  My kids prefer them over Disney movies and want to watch them over and over.  They are 9 and 6 years old.
I watches some of the DVDs and really enjoyed.  I loved the fact that they show how they made it.  It just as fascinating as the rest of it.
Some of the things that could have been better is the sound.  Sometimes the background music is too loud compared with the narrator's voice.  We have to crank up the volume just to be able to hear the commentary, then music is just too dominating.  The narrator's voice should be louder than the music for nature shows I would think.  It's not a problem for all of them, just for some.
Another problem is with the deceptive description of the set.  That part is more of amazon's fault.  It doesn't have German.  I really wanted German besides English.  I was going to buy this set in Germany because the English would also be there, I really wanted German for my bilingual kids!  I contacted amazon about the wrong description.  They didn't change it, but sent me another box set.  I don't need 2 of the same sets!  I didn't ask for another set, and I didn't want the trouble of now printing the mailing labels and sending the stupid second set back.  So I will not try to help them make more accurate description.  I see they still didn't fix it.  Just so you, buyers, know:  there is no German.",1252713600,2,1384,4.27027027027027
2896636,5,B000TEUSQ8,This DVD set is amazing and for the price it can't be beat.  I never saw blue planet before this but I knew if it was anything like planet earth it would be great.  Open your eyes to what 2/3rds of the world is like that you have never seen.,1252627200,,241,3.8

Narrated by David Attenbourgh, he takes you to all parts of the world to see animals rare behavior hardly ever witnessed.

As far as Planet Earth goes, it is one of the greatest things I have every watched.  It really gives the viewer a sense of just how huge this planet really is and how little we know about much of it.  Blue Planet is the same way except focused on the Oceans.",1245628800,,353,4.132352941176471
2896641,5,B000TEUSQ8,"Both of these programs are absolutely wonderful to watch. The photography is sensational.

2896642,5,B000TEUSQ8,"This is probably the best purchase that I have made in my life. The movie is incredible. I admire the people who worked tirelessly in making this moving under such extreme conditions. They deserve an award that is better than OSCAR or whatever the commercial movies get. This is an awesome piece of, I would like to say, art.

The movies came home in a perfect condition and on time. Beware! You will have lots of sleepless nights once you buy these DVDs. They are addictive and you can stop watching them.",1243555200,,506,4.5

2896659,5,B000TEUSQ8,"Before watching this, I never truly appreciated nor did I understand how precious our world, nature, and all living things and creatures really are.

Granted, I have the Blu-Ray version of this epic adventure which explores every corner of our beautiful planet. From sweeping vistas, endless plains, the darkness of caves, to the depths of our seas, Planet Earth and the Blue Planet gives viewers unprecedented access to never before seen species of animals as well as remote and far away locations. The BBC Orchestra has engaged us yet again with a thematic score for each episode in both series. Even more astounding is the shootings which have been undertaken from the air, on land, and in the sea. The director has ensured that while the camera is not overly intrusive onto the animals and their habitat, there is a closeness which allows us to be mesmerized by watching them from afar. For the true experience, watching both of these series in Blu-Ray brings out the richness of color and clarity of how Planet Earth and the Blue Planet were truly intended to be seen.

The narration by David Attenborough is spot on with intelligent information which appropriately follows each scene. The BBC has created an epic masterpiece and I only wish that I could give both of these series 10 stars instead of just 5 stars.",1236038400,,1319,4.8061674008810575

2896663,5,B000TEUSQ8,"This DVD set of wild life on earth and sea is absolutely amazing. It is just incredible all the footage that they have manage to capture and compile for this documentary. After seeing it once, you will totally want to watch it again and again. My favorite disc of them all was the deep sea. They show you outstanding footage of the bottom of the sea with really weird looking sea creatures, you would think they are aliens because they are so weird looking. Overall, this set of DVD is worth owning and is great to play when you have family and friends come over.

The show is smart, well-narrated, and contains excellent footage. This particular edition also sports bonus features after every episode called ""Planet Earth Diaries"" or ""Blue Planet Diaries,"" giving you further insights into both the difficulties and joys of the camera operators' struggles to capture these amazing shots.

2896679,5,B000TEUSQ8,"I have always loved watching shows about nature and wildlife, and if you're the same way, this is a great set of DVD's to buy. The ""Planet Eart"" series covers a remarkably wide range of locations and species in 5 DVD's, and while they do show many of people's favorite species and ecosystems (e.g. lions, elephants), the series also looks into areas less researched in past documentaries, revealing some bizarre animals and their ecosystems (e.g. caves, deserts). With the ""Blue Planet"" series, you'll see more in-depth footage of sea life that you most-likely have never seen before (I was shocked by the technique Killer Whales used in their hunt).

(even our 7 year old who whines when we tell him we are going to watch planet earth, and not a re-run of ""family guy"" for the 20th time)

each segment has jaw dropping shots that make you wonder how in the world they were ever able to film that, and so far at the end of the first two episodes, there is a short segment of ""planet earth diaries"" that details the planning and effort that went into getting some of the shots.

one more thing to add, I have noticed several questions or comments about whether this series is narrated by david attenborough, or sigourney weaver. this package that we got from the bbc has david attenborough.

I would highly recommend this for anyone who has an interest in nature. it is so easy to develop tunnel vision and get caught up in the daily grind of commuting and working and doing household chores.  this reminds us of what an amazing and delicate planet we inhabit.",1215388800,6,1071,4.313432835820896

I've seen a lot of documentaries, and I've been a big fan of Attenborough for many years. This is one of the most memorable productions I've come across. The camera teams went to some extraordinary lengths to get this footage.

(-) Style is set on an epic global scale, encompassing and summarising the entire globe. Which is great if it's what you're after and is a good crowd pleaser. However if you're after more specific footage or are only interested in certain kinds of species, there are other documentaries that would be better tailored for it. Not to discount this one though, that's pretty much the only negative I could think of.

2896715,1,B000TEUSQ8,"I have only just opened my new copy of the BBCvideo ""The Blue Planet""/""Planet Earth"" collector's edition (or collector's set). I feel that I must report my dissatisfaction with the packaging, the discs, and surprisingly with the picture quality of the video itself.

The packaging of this ""Collector's Set"" is dull, as if the colour has been washed out from all of the pictures on the boxes.  Not really a problem.  But after looking at the discs (10 in total), seven of mine had scratches on the playing surface the first time I took them out of the box.  I have played disc one and disc five from ""Planet Earth"" and all video on both DVD's look to me as though they are bad rips of pirated movies.  The images are blurred, out of focus, and all the highlights are blown out. The affects varies somewhat from scene to scene but it is considerably aggravating to watch. Even the title page text at the start of each video is not crisp on the screen but has jagged edges instead.  I have just previewed disc one of ""Blue Planet"" and I must say that it too appears dull and out of focus albeit not to the same pitiful extent of ""Planet Earth"".

I recall these videos as crisp, bright, and completely engaging.  There must be something wrong with this copy. Could it be that I received the one bad copy in this run of production?  Or is this Collector's set of lower quality?  Am I supposed to go out and buy the Blu-ray version just to enjoy this series as it was intended?

I am more than a little suprised.  I hope other copies are better than mine.  BTW - Other videos appear as they should on my computer, an Apple Powerbook G4.  My video appears as it is encoded on the DVD.  These copies are flawed in my opinion.

I guess I need to look into an explanation, refund, or exchange.",1200355200,19,1783,4.341389728096677

2896718,5,B000TEUSQ8,"Our adult son gave us this set for Christmas. We watched a few discs together and we all loved it.

I have been a fan of David Attenborough's since his Life on Earth series in the 70's. His insight and enthusiasm for life and nature revealed is probably the inspiration for the approach this series takes.

The producers have used new high-end video technology to portray our world in ways that we simply cannot access through our earth bound senses: sophisticated gimbled remote controlled camera mounts on helicopters provide shots that are extremely steady and can zoom into closeup and follow action in a way only seen before in high-end motion pictures and commercials. Especially unique is the moving time lapse photography. To pan, tilt or track the visual evidence of a change of seasons or an environmental event like a flood and its consequences yields footage that gives the viewer an experience never to be forgotten.
The pacing is excellent too. There is breath between the words, not a relentless machine gun spray of information. That gives us time to reflect, compare, and feel how what we see affects us.
