2259463,4,B0008JGQN8,"IT WAS A CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR OUR AUNT WHO REALLY JUST WANTED ""ELMER GANTRY""...BUT SHE WATCHED ""BIRDMAN"" YESTERDAY AFTERNOON AND WAS AMAZED TO FIND IT REALLY ENJOYABLE!",1389571200,,166,5.185185185185185
2259464,5,B0008JGQN8,Energy of the performers draws one back for multiple viewings.  Both films are powerhouse winners that should be repeated once a month on TCM,1384387200,,141,4.875
2259465,5,B0008JGQN8,"I had never seen a Burt Lancaster movie before ordering this product.  I have to say that now I would pay to see all of his work.  I had only vaguely heard of Birdman of Alcatraz.  I knew there was a real man called the Birdman of Alcatraz.  This movie surprised me at his accomplishments.  He forms a bond with the sparrow and later on the canaries he keeps in solitary in Leavenworth Prison and even concocts a medicine to cure them of a popular illness.  I had no idea he made such strides in the field.  His character is extremely anti-social and violent in the beginning but his change into a more intelligent, gentle soul over time is very inspiring.  Lancaster delivers in this part which drew him an Oscar nomination.

And then there's Elmer Gantry.  I had heard about this movie years ago but never got around to watching it until now and I am glad.  I am older now and this film means more to me now than it would have years ago as a younger man.  Burt Lancaster shines every single second in this film about a salesman turned preacher.  he brings so much life to the part and is more convincing than just about any other actor I've ever seen.  The cinematography and musical performances are breath taking and Lancaster himself proves he had a remarkable singing voice.  While Lancaster may be gone, he sure seems alive in this movie.  If you have never seen a Lancaster movie, this is the ultimate introduction and even though there are no extras, the movies themselves are excellent.  And at this price, it is a steal!",1379462400,2,1531,4.4496402877697845
2259466,5,B0008JGQN8,"Made me go to see a revival meeting for myself back in 1968 after I saw it.  Burt Lancaster is/was a powerful actor.
It was very exciting.  What a physical presence.
  He was the Birdman of Alcatraz",1374969600,,198,4.27027027027027
2259467,5,B0008JGQN8,"I could have spent my money on anything and not get the great movies on this double feature. The new generation just cant get great movies like this. I don't know of any actors of this generation could carry off the acting ability of the actors in these movies. Thats why there hasn't been remakes of these two films. These movies are in the same class as casablanca,Gone with the wind and How the west was won. Dont wait till you cant get this film.......",1373932800,,456,4.376470588235295
2259468,4,B0008JGQN8,"I only watched Birdman of Alcatraz.  The transfer was pretty good.  Picture and sound excellent. Downside no subtitles, no bonus.
I received the dvd before the indicated time.  Although the casing was pierced in the back from shipping, the dvd seems to be in good condition so far.
Two excellent movies from a past legend, Burt Lancaster.
I wanted to purchase also Trapeze with Lancaster and Tony Curtis, but there are different versions (even Chinese ones) that still make me hesitate.
Thanks from your prompt service.

2259471,5,B0008JGQN8,"The only other review of this set is a ridiculous 1-star review, and a set featuring these two movies deserves a lot better. I won't review the movies, just the set itself. To put it as simple as possible, this is a bare-bones DVD in every sense. There are no extra features, no trailers, no subtitles or closed-captioning. This DVD has nothing except for the two movies, both of which look great in their correct widescreen pictures.

I don't want to make it sound like I'm being critical of the set, because I'm not. Not at all. Both Birdman of Alcatraz and Elmer Gantry are excellent movies.

11/25/2013 EDIT: At the time I posted this, the only other review was a 1-star review. That has since changed, obviously. Maybe you complainers should look at the dates the reviews were posted before jumping all over me for ""not being able to count.""",1321660800,9,846,4.596026490066225

2259482,5,B0008JGQN8,"I love THE BIRDMAN OF ALCATRAZ' resolute perseverance for truth, the main characters' quest for knowledge and the purpose of his existence. The acting is first-rate. I saw this film when it was first released and I have never forgotten it. It was somewhat devastating. John Frankenheimer's films have that effect on you. It is a good one and I liked it then and I still like it now. This film consists of great character studies and the eternal question of why was man put on this earth. For what purpose? It has stood the test of time. Burt Lancaster's performance was brilliant, very underplayed and yet very focused. I also liked Elmer Bernstein's sensitive and thought provoking score. It fit the concrete landscape juxtaposed by the wonderment of the freedom to fly like a bird and behold the beauty that is in this world. Elmer Bernstein's early scores were very sensitive and often overlooked. The power of ELMER GANTRY is Burt Lancaster's energetic and charismatic performance. He has a gift. Is he a true believer or not? Like all men he faults. He has a restless soul and he is equally destructive as he is inspiring. But ultimately it is his eternal optimism to find truth and love that perhaps overcomes all obstacles.",1421452800,,1230,4.752336448598131

Burt Lancaster is as convincing as ever in his portrayal of Robert Stroud. In the second movie, Elmer Gantry he really is Elmer Gantry! What a loss to the film industry was his passing, I guess a debt we all must pay.
