8211640,1,B000U02I50,"I teach a college/career Sunday School Class and purchased this DVD because it looked like a great tool for my class.  What a waste of money.  Just three people, sitting at a table discussing the Bible.  There's no discussion material and it's incredibly boring to watch.  Definitely not a tool for a Bible Study Class.  Vey disappointed.",1282262400,2,338,4.859649122807017
