2440192,5,B000BRM99W,"Anna Getty has created an amazingly beautiful DVD, both visually and musically.  She has a powerful message as a prenatal yoga teacher, which resonates deeply on all levels.  She gently teaches you how to connect with your body, baby, and spirit through guiding you through this wonderfully creative DVD prenatal yoga class.  This DVD inspires me to recommit to my yoga practice and replay the DVD over and over again to enjoy the benefits of what Anna and her prenatal yoga class has to offer.  This is by far th best prenatal yoga DVD I have ever come across, I promise, you will not be disappointed!",1147132800,,602,4.650943396226415
2440193,5,B000BRM99W,"Doing prenatal yoga while I was pregnant was essential for my peace of mind and physical comfort.  Anna's DVD has just the right type of exercises that help you stretch and feel good.  Also, I found the setting and the music to be both uplifting and relaxing!",1142380800,3,259,4.48936170212766
2440194,5,B000BRM99W,"The exercises flow gracefully and perfectly match the background music.  Anna fits alot into this 60 min DVD but there never is a feeling of being rushed.  I took a Prenatal yoga training in which Anna was an assistant, and knew from her in class presence that her DVD would be wonderful, and I was right.  I am not pregnant, but I have been doing this DVD for it's uplifting effect on me. I work with pregnant moms as a massage therapist and natural birth advocate and highly recommend this DVD to all my clients",1131667200,6,513,4.378947368421053
2440205,5,B000BRM99W,"I've been a yoga teacher for over 10 years and have a certification in prenatal yoga as well. While I don't need to be led through a yoga practice, sometimes it is a nice switch. I've really enjoyed this DVD. As other have mentioned, it is Kundalini Yoga. So, there is more of a focus on repetitive movement than on holding postures. However, Anna still allows time for stillness, reflection, and connection with your baby. It is gentle and easy enough for beginners, but I don't get bored by it. Since it is gentle, it is also well suited for all trimesters. During pregnancy, our bodies are already undergoing such huge changes. In my opinion, this is a great time to slow down and follow a more gentle practice.",1317772800,3,714,4.542635658914729
2440206,5,B000BRM99W,"My wife is very particular about yoga instructors, when they overly focus on fancy moves without giving good pointers on body placement and breathing she thinks they do as much harm as good.  That is not the case with this DVD, Anna is great and I actually got a good workout side by side with my expecting lady.",1296432000,,312,4.379310344827586
2440207,5,B000BRM99W,I am in my first trimester (11wks) and have many years of yoga experience including vigorous forms such as vinyasa flow and bikram. I actually really enjoyed and appreciated this gentle practice because in my first trimester I have been very nauseas and too much up/down or inversions just doesn't end well. This is a very gentle practice that just about anyone should be able to do. I think it would be particularly good for the third trimester. I also personally enjoyed the music and meditation sequences and felt calmer and more confident after the practice. I also own more vigorous videos such as the perfect pregnancy workout vol. 1 and vinyasa flow for pregnancy but think this video is a nice complement depending on what kind of practice you need on different days.,1290124800,,775,4.791044776119403
2440208,5,B000BRM99W,Very relaxing video that feels so good! This is a great video for when your in your 2nd -3rd trimester.,1289088000,,103,4.2
2440209,3,B000BRM99W,"I have health issues and wanted to try to get some yoga ""exercise"" during pregnancy as I have very low energy levels... I read all the great reviews on this yoga dvd and was excited to get it.  Its not bad by any means, but I never do yoga and when I've tried to do classes (even the easy ones) are hard to do at first.  This DVD is a bit too easy.  I think its good to do something, but wonder how much benefit this has as it is so easy.  I'm going to continue doing it, but don't have much hope that it will improve my exercise level or do what they say yoga should do for pregnancy.",1286841600,2,585,3.85
2440210,5,B000BRM99W,"I loved this yoga video.  After purchasing 3 different ones, it became the ""go to"" dvd for me when I had the time.  It seemed really easy at first, but as my pregnancy progressed, it really helped out.  It's also really calming.  The only tough part is finding a full hour to do the entire thing.",1286236800,,296,4.232142857142857
2440211,5,B000BRM99W,"This is a great prenatal yoga workout.  It's gentle yet gives you some good solid stretches.  There are times that her background music is too loud and you can't hear her voice, but I think it's only during a resting pose.  Also, she seems to rush the resting time at the end but you can just keep resting on your own.  Other than that, it's a great video.",1279497600,,356,4.1911764705882355
2440212,3,B000BRM99W,"OK so it was my first baby and I was just lookin into all kinds of prenatal workout routines. Well I think doing these prenatal yoga stuff was probably better than just sitting around and doing nothing, but I think just getting out and walking would've been a better alternative- get your blood circulation going and whatnot. The stretches do feel good though and other moves makes you feel somewhat healthy- like you did something good for your baby but just the every day movements -like walking- your baby will enjoy that just as much. There were some moves in there that was a little too straining so I didn't follow those.. and the meditation parts I just fast forwarded. You will have plenty of time to connect and bond with your baby AFTER the baby's born. All those meditations or focusing on your baby may make you feel like you're doing something but really the baby won't feel any different inside. I would rather just get some sleep. The music kinda got stuck in my head so that was bothersome.
Overall it's easy to follow through. The instructor (anna getty) doesn't 'talk' to you while doing the moves , the dvd is narrated by her. Will it help you 'stay in shape'? no. Best thing to do is walk alot, get plenty of rest, drink plenty of water, stretch, and eat modestly. That letting-go and eating whatever you want is BAD BAD BAD idea. Pregnancy is NOT an excuse to eat a triple bacon burger on a daily basis.
Would I use it for my second pregnancy? Probably. because I enjoy the stretches. But I would definitely fast forward the usual stuff and this time definitely do more walking exercises.",1270684800,,1609,4.5326460481099655
2440213,5,B000BRM99W,"I have absolutely enjoyed this dvd throughout my pregnancy, even now at 37 weeks :)
I would recommend it to everyone. It has helped me with the minor aches and pains of pregnancy, and given my energy and spirit a boost when I needed it.
High quality dvd, and the music is very soothing.",1265846400,2,286,4.314814814814815
2440214,5,B000BRM99W,"I initially didn't want to buy this because of the DVD title, but the user reviews convinced me. It totally helped with my sciatica in both pregnancies. This is Kundalini yoga for those yoga buffs out there. I highly recommend it, although I'm kind of disappointed they jacked up the price almost 300%. I got mine in 2008 for $12.99 on Amazon.",1253664000,,343,4.548387096774194
2440221,4,B000BRM99W,"I bought 4 prenatal work out DVDs to try.  This is my favorite yoga DVD.  Very fluid movements, not choppy like many other Yoga DVDs I have or have done.  It is soothing, easy to listen to and follow and provides a good overall stretch with some decent strength training.  Easy enough to get through if you are just begining.  Challenging enough if you work out regularly.  If you work out 3 or more times a week you may find this to not be challenging enough but still very good four your mind and soul.",1252281600,3,504,4.252631578947368
2440222,5,B000BRM99W,"I've been doing Yoga for 15 years.  I'm now in my 8th month of my pregnancy and this is by far the best yoga DVD.  I've tried a total of three and this one is a perfect balance.  It's interested because the evenings I do this yoga I sleep really really well, but the days I don't I have a lot of aches and pains that keep me up.

Not only has this DVD been great for me through the pregnancy but it's also really helped me destress so much so that I'm planning on bringing it with me to the hospital during labor.  The music and her calm voice I think will help me really center and find that peaceful place I come to while I'm practicing.",1248134400,,639,3.9609375
2440223,5,B000BRM99W,"This dvd is excellent - for me it is perfect for low-energy days, but still challenging.  The music is relaxing as is the narrative.

I am in my 3rd trimester and find it helps with swelling in my legs and tightness in my hips.  I would say this dvd is also appropriate for women who are beginners to yoga.",1241740800,,306,4.1525423728813555
2440224,5,B000BRM99W,"I had been doing various kundalini yoga DVDs by Ana Brett and Ravi Singh and loved them.  When I needed to switch to something designed for prenatal yoga, it was discouraging that there aren't many prenatal kundalini yoga DVDs.  I bought two - and this is by far my favorite.  My only complaint is that it is an hour long, and I wish there was an easy way to break it up (like the matrix option the Ana and Ravi DVDs have).  Overall though - I love it!",1236643200,,452,4.1022727272727275
2440225,5,B000BRM99W,"I used this DVD through my entire pregnancy and as a way to get back into exercise post-partum. I credit it with opening my joints, keeping my body stretched, and teaching me how to get to that place of focus that is oh-so-necessary during birth. I had an extremely long homebirth (and eventual hospital transfer) but I still managed to have a natural childbirth because of the focus and sheer strength I had gained from a regular yoga practice.",1230595200,,445,4.6455696202531644
2440226,5,B000BRM99W,"I have read some REALLY good reviews about this DVD series, so I am excited to order... but, I'm deffinately NOT going to order from here! What is up with the price of the DVD???????????????? I did just a little bit of research and found it for just 11.99 on one website, then 16.99 on another!!!! what is going on here??? there must be some mistake!",1224892800,,350,4.318181818181818
2440227,5,B000BRM99W,"I am currently 33 weeks along and have been using this DVD for the last two months or so. In the last couple of weeks, I have been using it every day. It is very relaxing and effective, and I have not suffered any lower back pain at all since using this dvd. I found the keep-up exercise very challenging at first, but it's become much easier and it really does help me focus on my breathing and relaxing through the challenge. Anna might not explain how every single posture is beneficial to the pregnant body but they are all postures that I have seen in either pregnancy books or in other DVDs that are meant to facilitate pregnancy and/or childbirth.",1219708800,,654,4.413223140495868
2440228,4,B000BRM99W,"i only used this video a fe wtimes whne i was pregnant because well i just was kind of lazy and tired alot after working, also being very overweight it was hard to get on the floor some days. but when i did watch it, it was very relaxing, especially the music. i was thinking of starting to use it again because i have a bad back and it would probably be at the right pace for me. Some things i couldn't do because i wasn't flexible enough and haven't done much yoga prior, but then i would just continue with my breathing instead.",1219276800,,531,4.115384615384615
2440229,5,B000BRM99W,"At 25 weeks pregnant (and 38 years old), I've really started feeling a lot of lower back pain and overall tension as I try to move through my day with this new body.  My doctor recommended trying prenatal yoga.  I checked out the Amazon reviews for several prenatal yoga DVDs and took note of this one, but it was temporarily out of stock (plus the cover looked a little goofy) so I tried the Yoga Journal offering.  Not having regularly done yoga before, I felt rather awkward and tense going through a lot of the the poses in that DVD.  Not exactly what I was aiming for!  So I ordered Anna Getty's DVD elsewhere and must say it did exactly what I was hoping:  It made me feel graceful, strong, energized and yet relaxed as well.  The movements didn't require me to make any modifications either as a yoga beginner or as someone nearly in the third trimester, which made me feel pretty capable and confident too.  I'm new to Kundalini yoga but I like the emphasis on movement vs. so many static poses.  Going through the full routine gave my muscles not only a nice stretch but also a chance to move in ways that felt really good.  A few things were tiring but Anna's good about reminding women to listen to their bodies and do only what feels right.  This is the DVD I'll be doing for the next three months!",1211500800,,1310,4.349794238683128
2440230,4,B000BRM99W,"I personally used this yoga dvd throughout my pregnancy with my fourth child.  As an older mother to be, I wanted to be able to be strong during the birth of my baby.  I found that this dvd gave me a different perspective than that of other prenatal dvd's.  I highly recommend this dvd for the use during your pregnancy!  I teach prenatal yoga myself, and this was a wonderful dvd for my own personal use.

2440231,5,B000BRM99W,"I am really enjoying this DVD.  I like doing it first thing in the morning.  It is calming for me and also a mood lifter.  I had no previous experience with yoga but had no difficulty doing this, although my muscles really feel some of the stretches and squats.  I am 4 months pregnant and plan to do this routine throughout my pregnancy.",1207612800,,338,4.317460317460317
2440232,5,B000BRM99W,"I purchased this DVD because I read the reviews and it is very good!  I also bought Prenatal Yoga With Shiva Rea, but liked this one 10 times more.  Don't waste your money, this is a very good purchase you won't regret.  Alot of the exercises in this DVD are the ones I am learning in my childbirth education class.  I recommend it greatly!!",1204848000,,341,4.28125
2440233,5,B000BRM99W,"I'm a prenatal yoga instructor, and this is the DVD I recommend to my students.  It is so beautifully done, and the exercises and stretches are just what the pregnant body needs.  A nice mix of Hatha and Kundalini Yoga, so there is something for everyone!!!

My other two favorites are Gurmukh's & Shiva Rea's DVDs.

Happy Pregnancy!!",1203465600,6,334,4.706896551724138
2440234,5,B000BRM99W,"I almost didn't even consider this DVD because the picture is so dated looking...I figured it was from the 70s/80s and wanted something with current production quality.  Actually, it's a modern DVD and the production is quite beautiful and soothing.  I didn't find it at all distracting or hokey as I thought it might be.  The voiceover is pleasant and doesn't get annoying the way some do.  The three women demonstrating the poses are all in varying stages of pregnancy (very fit pregnancies).  I'm out of shape and found a couple of exercises somewhat difficult (namely balancing on one opposite hand and knee with the other ones extended).  The poses move faster than I've experienced with other yoga DVDs, though I was able to keep up with them fairly easily.  My 6-year-old enjoyed it with me and declared it to be ""relaxing"" and ""fun"".  She particularly liked the ""light and spirit flowing right into her body"".  Seriously, her words, not mine.  All in all, I highly recommend it for a mostly gentle but still somewhat stimulating workout and short but relaxing meditations.",1203120000,21,1080,4.884615384615385
2440235,5,B000BRM99W,"This is a beautifully made DVD. It is a pleasure to listen to (Anna Getty's voice is relaxing and soothing, her words encouraging and comforting, and  the music is very cool), a pleasure to look at (the setting and the colors are beautiful), and a pleasure  to practice (Kundalini is easy for beginners and yet provides a challenging workout that I have been using even postnatally to get back into shape). Kundalini yoga is different than other types of yoga, such as Hatha, in that it is gentler, less about the precision of postures and more about breathing and energizing your body.  Other teachers to try: Gurmukh.  I love that this DVD is divided into different sections that you can play straight through, or have the option to select separately, so if you want to skip the meditation, you may do so, or if you would like to focus just on the sitting exercises, you are able to do that too.  This DVD was a life saver for me during my pregnancy (I think my baby loved all the swaying and rocking,  too) and it truly provided the best 50 minutes of the day.  My only regret is that I got it after the start of my third trimester.  It would have been wonderful to be able to practice it throughout the entire pregnancy.  I definitely plan on doing so for baby #2!",1203033600,2,1268,4.407725321888412
2440236,5,B000BRM99W,I have tried Shiva Rea and Crunch Yoga Mama and The Divine Mother prenatal yoga is by far better than the others. It's challenging in a good way but it is also relaxing. I look forward to using this DVD throughout my pregnancy. I highly recommend this workout.,1202947200,,260,4.4375
2440237,5,B000BRM99W,I bought this DVD because of the reviews so I thought I'd add one to the mix.  I am in the 11th week of my third pregnancy and am suffering from a great deal of upperback pain.  The only way I can walk by the end of the day is to do this yoga workout.  I did a lot of weight lifting before getting pregnant and love the keep-up exercise and the leg strengthening exercises.  I would highly recommend buying this DVD.,1193356800,,416,4.036585365853658
2440238,4,B000BRM99W,"I'm in my 7th month and have been using this DVD since my 3rd month. Its not advanced yoga. I'm not a yoga expert but I had done yoga before being pregnant and I like this DVD. The music is nice and so is the atmosphere. It is very soothing and relaxing and good for stretching. The cover of the DVD box is terrible, I think. The photo sucks! but the DVD content is good. I recommend it!",1192579200,3,387,3.9743589743589745
2440239,5,B000BRM99W,"The poses in this program can be done during all three trimesters without modification.  The three women in the video are each pregnant and at different phases of their pregnancies, which makes the poses easier to follow.  The program is appropriately challenging, and seems to hit the spots that need extra attention during pregnancy.  The DVD gets right into the heart of the workout without excessive introduction, which is important when you are doing the workout day after day.  Although the guided meditation at the end could be a bit longer, the program as a whole is well balanced and better than I expect from a DVD workout.",1191888000,,633,4.833333333333333
2440240,5,B000BRM99W,"Overall, this is not the most difficult yoga video I have done, but it is very relaxing.  It does a great job loosening up any stiffness I have been feeling.  Early in my pregnancy I experienced a lot of headaches, and since I have started using this video, I have hardly had any.  I am very pleased with that since I bought this video after reading another person's review who said that this video helped them with their headaches.  This video leaves me feeling rested, peaceful, and relaxed.",1189987200,,493,4.568181818181818

2440262,5,B000BRM99W,"I purchased both this DVD and the Shiva Rea Yoga DVD.  For the first week or two, I switched back and forth between the two, however I found that I liked this DVD with Anna Getty so much that I ended up using it from then on.  Although both of them were good, the one with Anna Getty was a bit more challenging (in a good way) and really stretched out my hips and back well.",1177718400,9,374,3.9078947368421053
2440263,5,B000BRM99W,"I am now in my second trimester, and I have been using this DVD from the start.  I definitely plan on using it throughout my pregnancy.

Initially I was put off by the DVD's title (sounded a little hokey to me) but the reviews were so good that I thought I'd give it a try.  It is very relaxing and all the stretches feel so good--especially the hip stretches.  I love the music too, it is really beautiful.  The opening exercise is the only part where Anna Getty chants and talks about white light, etc.  If you are not into the new age aspect of yoga you could skip this part but I found that it helped me get into a relaxed state.  I have been suffering with severe headaches and I find that when I do this DVD, by the end of it I feel so much better; it's amazing.

As another reviewer mentioned, I also don't like the ""keep up"" exercise where you move your arms up and down for 3 minutes.  One of my problems is very tight neck and shoulder muscles, so after all the stretching and relaxing, this exercise really hurts my muscles that were just starting to un-knot.  During those 3 minutes I do a different yoga stretch where I am stretching out my arm and back muscles more.  Others who do not have upper back/tension issues would be fine doing the keep up exercise.

I would definitely recommend this DVD to anyone who is looking to relax and stretch.  I do find the one girl's smirking and ""I'm about to laugh"" grin in the second half of the DVD (I think Simone?) annoying, but I have my eyes closed most of the time now and Anna Getty is excellent so I rarely notice her anymore.  Other than that the background and imagery are also beautiful.  All-in-all this DVD is a very beneficial part of my prenatal care that I really look forward to.",1174348800,,1750,4.260606060606061
2440264,4,B000BRM99W,"This DVD is not too challenging but provides great stretching and relaxation.  The only part I do not like is what she calls the ""keep up"" exercise to develop mental stamina.  I find it dangerous for me to do this because of my existing shoulder dysfunction.  It would be nice if another alternative exercise was presented for those who may be unable to use the shoulder in this way, but I suspect most people would not have a problem with it.",1170720000,,443,4.444444444444445

2440266,5,B000BRM99W,This was just what I was looking for.  I had done yoga prior to becoming pregnant and wanted to get back into it.  It's supposed to be one of the best exercises for pregnant women.  However I wanted to make sure that I had some guidance as far as which poses/postures were appropriate during pregnancy.  This video took care of all of that and really lets you decide for yourself how intense you want to make it.  It's also cool that the 3 instructors are also in varying stages of pregnancy (2nd & 3rd trimesters).  That certainly made me more comfortable.,1168387200,,557,4.465346534653466
2440267,5,B000BRM99W,"My nurse midwife recommended I do yoga.  This was my second pregnancy.  I used a yoga VHS some on my first, but this one was so much better!  It helped me feel better while I was pregnant: helped decrease back pain, neck pain, etc. and helped to de-stress.  I have a prolapsed uterus and this yoga helped ease the discomfort.  I used it 2-3 times per week in my 3rd trimester.  This dvd's true test came when labor hit.  I soon found that if I could use my mind to put myself in my comfy home in front of the tv with Anna Getty's dvd and soothing music with her relaxed encouraging voice saying ""picture openness, expansion and ease"" I could get through the contraction with ease.  My husband was amazed that I was not squeezing his hand off through my intense pain as I had done with the first birth.  It was a very enjoyable, easy labor and I thank this dvd.  When the contraction would start I had to close my eyes and request everyone to be quiet and I would sort of rotate my head back and forth and relax my whole body.  As the contraction's intensity increased, I would picture Anna Getty and hear the music and her voice.  After picturing ""openness, expansion, and ease"" I would stay relaxed and the cervix would effectively and efficiently dilate.  When the contraction ended, I would take a deep cleansing breath.  My beautiful baby was born two hours after my waters broke!

I intend to use this dvd some to get back into shape after baby.  Another thing I liked is the separation of the meditation, etc. on their own dvd tracks.  I am a Christian and I skipped these tracks.  I thank God for this new miracle, a healthy full-term baby, in my life!",1166313600,13,1659,4.366013071895424
2440268,5,B000BRM99W,"If it weren't for Anna Getty's The Divine Mother Prenatal Yoga Series DVD, I would be doing very little yoga (read this as: none...). I'm either very tired or very busy or very hungry; all good reasons to keep me from doing the yoga! But I come back to the DVD often because it is so beautifully shot, the pace and rhythm of the postures are a perfect combination of meditation and movement, and Anna's gentle, soothing voice reminds me to listen to my own rhythm, whether it be faster or slower.

Even though I am using an ""external"" tool to do my yoga practice, this DVD always leaves me centered, meditative, calm, and with so much more space inside of me. My circulation has improved and my back pain has disappeared. And the big baby inside of me just goes along for the entire ride. By the end of the DVD, I am so relaxed I hit the pause button during the lying down part, just to enjoy the moment of calm a bit longer.",1156291200,7,925,4.255681818181818

Most of my experience has been with Iyengar yoga, and I didn't realize that this was Kundalini yoga until I got the DVD. I've never practiced this kind before, so at first I was a little unsure that I was going to like it, and I remained skeptical until about halfway through my first run of this DVD. However, I really do like the gentle motions and the focus on breathing and meditation...I'm sure this practice will help me grow a relaxed baby and will also help me with labor. I also think that it's a fun DVD for the baby (all of the rocking and swaying must be very soothing for him or her). I plan to alternate using this DVD with ""Prenatal Yoga with Shiva Rea"" (a DVD I highly recommend). My main complaint about this DVD (and the Shiva Rea one) is that we don't see the postures in a ""mirror image"" and it can be a little confusing for people who are newer yoga practitioners. I also wish that Anna would be a little more informative about each posture (i.e., would let us know the benefits of each posture for us, for the baby, for labor). Otherwise, it's a nice DVD.",1148860800,30,1189,4.3125
8092102,5,B000BRM99W,"I got this in preparation for a fit pregnancy during my 2nd trimester. It gave me a relaxed and centered disposition and I believe it helped me a lot during labor. My choice of birthing method was all natural, no epidural.",1504569600,,222,4.439024390243903

8092104,5,B000BRM99W,"I haven't done the standing portion of the workout yet, but I loved the rest of it.  My back and legs have been feeling very stiff and sore.  I sit all day for work, and I don't get much stretching in.

This workout is fairly easy to do and I love the special attention it pays to connecting with your baby.  The rocking really helps with my lower back and hip pain.

So glad I bought this!",1395878400,,390,4.012987012987013
8092105,4,B000BRM99W,"I really enjoyed this video. It's very calming and gives you a really nice stretch. I liked that there was a focus on connecting with your baby. The only thing I didn't like was that it wasn't the best actual workout. I didn't use it as often as I would have liked because I chose to focus on true workouts that would elevate my heart rate. If you're looking for light, relaxing exercise, this is your video!",1376784000,,408,4.311688311688312

Maybe if you are a fit person before getting pregnant, it might be to easy for you...  But for me, I try to do it once in a while because I am 28 weeks pregnant already and this one tires me a little bit....
I also bought the ""yoga prenancy: pre and post natal workouts"" and I like it better, because it is a little bit easier than this one....",1355875200,,461,4.122222222222222
8092108,4,B000BRM99W,"This is a gentle flow, and particularly mindful for women who are further along in their pregnancies. This is not a series that will particularly challenge you as an exercise routine, so if you are looking for that you might pass on this video. However, it is very helpful for centering and flexibility. The poses are all appropriate for later stages when you are big and restricted somewhat in movement. The video setting is also very peaceful. I can't seem to find any prenatal yoga classes in my area, and I think this video is a nice substitute for occasional or moderate use.",1355184000,,580,4.640776699029126
8092109,5,B000BRM99W,"This is my favourite prenatal yoga video. I love it soo much I tracked it down and bought it for my second pregnancy, borrowed it from the library for my first one but too many people wanted it.
The music is amazing in this video, really helps to put you in a meditative state. Also the scenery in vid is more peaceful, it doesn't just look like they are in a studio.
The workout itself is challenging enough, I wouldn't recommend it for a yoga pro, but then again if you are a yoga pro then you probably don't need a prenatal yoga vid.
She does describe what most exercises and postures do for certain parts of your body as well. I found this kept me in shape with my first pregnancy providing you do it regularly enough.",1352592000,,722,4.239130434782608
8092110,4,B000BRM99W,"A friend recommended this to me but after looking at the cover I was skeptical. Seemed out dated and cheesy.

But after purchasing it and using it a few times I am pleased. I'm in the middle of my second trimester and am having a a lot of back pain (tight and strained muscles) and when I do these exercises (really they are more stretches) I actually sleep so much better and don't wake up with any pain.

The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five was becaus of the music. It kind of chants and gets stuck in my head afterwards, but I guess it's pretty calming. Small price to pay for relief of back pain though!

I really hate working out. I don't usually stick with exercise videos (and I have a few) but this one really has helped me and doesn't feel like exercising. It really is just stretching and easy poses to relax in. I recommend it!",1344816000,,855,4.201219512195122
8092111,4,B000BRM99W,"After a *literally* exhaustive search to find a yoga fitness tape that suited my abilities, I was really disappointed to find that most programs far exceeded my current physical abilities. I have Lupus and severe Rheumatoid Arthritis and have been dealing with a flare for several months in which pain and inflammation has restricted my movement so I needed a program that would gradually build flexibility and strength. After considerable searching, this program is the best I have found so far.

I can't get on the floor easily, well most days not at all, and a course of steroids which is supposed to help calm my immune system has resulted in a little extra padding around my waist which also makes it harder to move like I used to. My sister has sworn by yoga for years for the general health benefits and she has a great figure as a result as well. I asked her advice about which DVD to try and she suggested a routine designed for pregnancy because she knows that the routines would be gentle and easier for me to follow considering my health/physical challenges.

I knew very little about the different types of yoga and still only have a very general idea of the different kinds but this DVD is about Kundalini Yoga, a very restorative form of yoga with an emphasis on stretch. Aside from the very gentle poses I feel very calm and relaxed in part because I am not stressed out about not being able to do the program. It seems to have many poses that focus on the hips and back which are huge trouble spots that I need to tend to. I *love* that I can skip to the Standing routine which some DVDs make you fast forward through; this is just one click to get to the ""good stuff"". I am not always (well mostly) able to finish the entire session or all the poses - especially squats (yet) but I'm getting a better result and sticking with it longer than the other fitness/movement DVDs I own, one of which involves really great free-form fluid motion. Ms. Getty encourages you to find your inner strength - granted she's usually referring to what you'd need during labor and delivery :)

I'm trying the other sections from a seated position but this has proved little more challenging to get the poses right and likely I'll get more use out of these sections as my health and physical condition improves. I modify certain moves - for instance there is one part where she has you flap your arms for three minutes straight - I do a gentler version flapping slowly as if with resistance like under water. Other sections are easier for me to follow along with, like I can still use the Opening and Closing Meditations while either seated or laying down; there is a lot of focus on breathing in these sessions.

As other reviewers has mentioned, the cover may look a little old fashioned but the contents are thoroughly modern. The filming, location, narration, and music are not overly ""new age-y"" for my tastes. BTW, I've given birth to two children and had natural/drug free labors and I can tell by the guidance given in this DVD that if you practice this program that both the physical and meditative benefits of this DVD would be helpful during labor and delivery.

Pleased with this purchase and highly recommended.",1326412800,3,3222,4.567474048442906
