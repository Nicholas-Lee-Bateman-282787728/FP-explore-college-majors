7892118,4,6305608350,I'm not sure this is a review of the video as much as it is astonishment that Mark Ritter is staring in this type of film. Boy has he changed!! I thought he was striving to produce feature films or act in Indie films. So funny since it's somewhat out of character. But I guess I'm not surprised in hindsight.  He did have another side to him.,1376265600,,342,4.104477611940299

7892120,4,6305608350,"Lauren Hays is a reporter who decides to do a story on a male prostitute. She goes undercover to watch him have sex with his clients. She falls in love with him, feels guilty, and reveals her true identity to him. He gets mad because she betrayed him. And this isn't hypocritical at all. I mean sure, he has sex with married women for money, but you know, she lied to him. In an unintentionally hilarious scene, he tells her (using that breathy, distraught, hurt woman voice): ""Just get out!"". Then they make up. The end.

There are nine sex scenes. Seven are boy/girl, one is girl/girl, and one is boy/girl/girl. Lauren is in four of the scenes. She also has a strip scene. As always, Lauren is great as are most of the other women: Brande Roderick (Miss April 2000), Taime Hannum, Nancy O'Brien, and Tara Deffenderfer. Most of the sex scenes were very good, but none of them were real standouts. Also, I thought a few of them were a little too short, or I would have given this a higher rating.

Overall, I recommend it.",1096070400,3,1022,4.430851063829787
