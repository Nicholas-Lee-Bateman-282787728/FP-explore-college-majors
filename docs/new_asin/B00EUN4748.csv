5944816,4,B00EUN4748,"I like this K-drama because the characters are not typed casts and are not infallible.  They can be bad at times but can also be good, true to life.  The leading male character is handsome and leading lady is cute.  Loved it.",1391299200,,225,4.309523809523809
5944817,4,B00EUN4748,"This movie has superb casts. Their performances are spot on, most of the time. As the story progressed I found myself drawn into their drama, even though the drama can be over dramatic in some parts. In my opinion the writing needs some improvement. For example, the accident scene was too cruel to my taste, they could have re-shoot it or rewrite it. At some points a few characters were pushed to their breaking points and became too cruel. It was hard to watch. However, overall it is very good drama. I especially liked the way a few characters communicate their feeling via the blackboard at the bookstore. Some of the messages are very inspiring. The title really says it all about the main character. If you really love you have to be willing to give up everything. I like it enough that I'm going to buy this series",1391299200,,823,4.530201342281879
5944818,1,B00EUN4748,"This starts out crappy. Then it gets a little more interesting. Then it gets fairly good, then it starts avalanching at the speed of sound back into sheer crap.

ALL of the characters are unpleasant and annoying. NONE of them smile, are endearing, or caused me to give a crap what happened to them. I could not root for anybody. The female lead is nothing to leave home for, NEVER smiles, and is a constant ""Ninna-nonna-ninna-nnaa-ninnna"" party pooper stick-in-the-mud and an all-around jerk.

By episode 5 ALL of the characters become extreme exaggerations of their own characters, and ALL of them have commenced to whining, complaining, doing unpleasant things, and just beeing all around annoying.

There are SO MANY plot twists and subplots that they become a joke, as if written via algorithm looking for conflct and the pairing of opposites.

I watch A LOT of Korean film, but this is crap.

Miss it.

5944819,4,B00EUN4748,"SSH has been in a couple of dramas where his character dies...so watching this drama, the viewer spends a good part of their viewing time hoping he doesn't die off.  Once you forget that, there is the issue of the young female lead's sullen expression, the annoying actor playing her love interest and the dawning feeling that the second (& older female) lead is too likable & lovely to be a dastardly second lead.  Having waited out all those emotions, eventually, the viewer is rewarded by the sheer attractiveness of SSH.  His character has one judgment failure.  Beyond that, he is too perfect for words.  So I give up describing him and say I would watch this drama again, given his amount of screen time.  Sure he suffers too much, but he does it so handsomely!  SSH fans enjoy!",1379548800,,784,4.597122302158273

8609592,5,B00EUN4748,"Song Seung Hun and friend  are beautiful to look at. A very romantic film, tough guy with tender heartthe girl didn't inspire me in any way but it's just a story. South Korea certainly has great movies- all I watch these days. Recommend this. absolutely.",1426723200,,254,4.644444444444445
8609593,5,B00EUN4748,This was the first Korean drama that I had ever seen. I was first attracted to the lead actor--who I thought looked a lot like Bruce Lee.  I was captured by the first episode. I thought the acting and chemistry between Han Tae San and Mi Do was very believable--I am now a Hugh fan of both these actors and many of the other K-drama's and the songs in these series. I have seen many K-dramas but this is one of my top two choices.,1414022400,,430,4.0588235294117645
8609594,3,B00EUN4748,"Enjoyed it.  The main characters also were cast in ""East of Eden"" which I have been trying to find
to continue the story from Disc. 10, where Netflix ends it,  tho the story continues..  I was hoping ""When a Man loves/"" would be it under the  different title.  I love Korean dramas, especially favorite actresses and actors,  I
was not disappointed.",1411344000,,349,4.639344262295082
8609595,5,B00EUN4748,"The romantic tension in this film was very good but the lead actress could have been a little less ""wooden.""  I will buy just about anything I can find with Seung Hun Song.  He's a wonderful actor and a visual delight.",1397779200,,218,4.2926829268292686
8609596,4,B00EUN4748,"Very uneven. But...
1. I still don't understand pilates, but I now love it. Its almost a fetish on display. Very nice imo.
2. The Double Coma. Wow. Maybe I don't watch enough drama but I was impressed. New to me.
3. Crazy Guy. Its not that he intends bad things, its just that bad things happen when hes around. He even looks crazy.
4. Actress abuse. The lead actress is a GREAT ACTOR. The fact she can even talk while wearing those shoes is a trbute to her skill. As an aside, shame on those horrible kdrama producers, how could they subject such a cute girl to such horrible torture.
5. Wait, this isn't going where I thought. I cant give it away.
6. When s*** is boring or confusing I can just look at the awesome Korean women. +1 Internet.

Try to watch it on a service that has the broadcast 16:9. All the dvd stuff is 4:3 and looks dodgy imo.",1394409600,,848,4.170731707317073
8609597,5,B00EUN4748,"This is one of my favorites! I give this a five star for many reasons.  I love how we see the characters mature through the series.  You love them initially, then you hate them, and then you love them again.  The story was amazing. I don't want to spoil the ending but it really was worth the wait!",1393027200,,298,4.103448275862069
