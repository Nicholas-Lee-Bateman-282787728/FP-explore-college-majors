I love it. 11 great live songs plus 2 videos at the end. No glitzy stage show, no special effects, just a concentration on the music. The live versions of these songs are either not available anywhere else, or at least very hard to find on the flip side of some singles.
How many other bands, touring to support their debut CD, play 5 songs not even on the 1st CD? I think it's great that the band wants to give the fans more than what they are expecting. The video is 75 minutes long so there is a lot to enjoy here.
I understand that this video is becoming hard to find, so go out & get it NOW, while you still can!!",1000598400,2,690,3.9357142857142855
