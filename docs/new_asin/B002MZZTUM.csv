8374425,3,B002MZZTUM,"A vacationing Chicago gangster, named Lee Barwell (Noah Beery) is enjoying London England, when he witnesses a crime. Later, Barwell befriends a simple match-seller named Sam, who had been given a package to hold onto for a criminal. This is somehow connected to the aforementioned crime. Unfortunately, the crook shows up for his package and Sam winds up dead. Barwell investigates, having taken possession of the package. THE AVENGING HAND (1936) is a showcase for Beery, in an amiable role. He gets to sleuth about, acting more like Sherlock Holmes than any gangster. Can he uncover the killer's identity? Not a bad little movie, and at just over an hour in length, it's over before it could ever wear out its welcome!...",1512259200,,724,4.942622950819672
8374426,2,B002MZZTUM,Another Sinister Cinema flop. A very bad plot and the acting is only fair. This is not an interesting movie at all. The word is dull.,1431820800,,133,4.153846153846154
