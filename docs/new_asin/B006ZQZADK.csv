8507181,5,B006ZQZADK,"I have purchased several of the Stan Winston School of Character Arts dvds, and have yet to be disappointed. They are pricey, yes, but the amount of in depth information they provide is well worth the price. I have purchased several mold making tutorial dvds in the past and this one blows them all out of the water. Highly recommended!",1339027200,,336,4.616666666666666
