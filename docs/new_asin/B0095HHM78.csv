5263268,5,B0095HHM78,"David Mitchell is one of my absolute favorite writers, and Cloud Atlas is among my favorite novels. It was my top pick for 2004.  I've previously blogged about my unusual first encounter with Mr. Mitchell while he was touring for Cloud Atlas. (Google ""David Mitchell returns to San Francisco"" if you're curious.)  Good times!

Anyway, considering my love of the novel, you can imagine that I've been looking forward to the film with equal measures of anticipation and trepidation. You always want the film to do the source material justice, but it's rare that it actually happens. Especially when you're looking at a novel as complex as Cloud Atlas. It was said by many to be unfilmable, and if asked, I would have agreed.

And I would have been so very wrong. What Andy Wachowski, Lana Wachowski, and Tom Tykwer have achieved is nothing short of astounding. I'll cut to the chase and tell you that I LOVED this film. It will surely be my favorite of the year.

Have you read Cloud Atlas? The novel has a very unusual structure. Mitchell's an experimental writer. The novel is composed of six linked stories taking place in six different time periods and comprised of six different literary genres. Yeah, that's not too ambitious. The novel opens with the most distant story in the past, a 19th century adventure at sea. Halfway through, the story ends abruptly, mid-sentence. Next, we're at the home of a once-eminent European composer in the early 20th century. That, too, ends abruptly, and now we're embroiled in a mystery in early 1970's San Francisco. But halfway through the tale just stops and we're on to a high comedy set near the present day. After reading half of Timothy Cavendish's ghastly ordeal, we're suddenly in the science fiction world of a futuristic and dystopian Seoul--for half a story. And finally, we're in far-distant, post-apocalyptic Hawaii, in a tale written entirely in pigeon English. And at last, the story goes all the way through to the end, after which the second half of the Seoul story commences, followed by all the others in reverse order.

The film is... totally not like that. It's structured completely differently, with quick scenes from all six stories rapidly juxtaposed against each other. There is constant shifting. It's an amazing way to tell the tale(s), but it works. It more than works. It really drives home the novel's abstract themes of connectedness. After the film, one of the things my friends and I commented upon was the staggering job of editing this film. I can't imagine what went into it, but it was masterful.

What these three writer/directors--apparently with limited input from Mr. Mitchell--did with this screenplay is extraordinary. It is brilliant. Now, it's been eight years since I read the novel, so my memory of the details is not so fresh, but by my reckoning, the screenplay was remarkably true to Mitchell.  I recognized dialogue taken verbatim from the novel.  Yes, there were elisions, but they were minor. The composer's daughter was removed entirely. She's a character that stands out in my mind due to a memorable later cameo in Mitchell's Black Swan Green, but you know what? She was superfluous. The film didn't need her. I'm sure there were other minor changes, but nothing at all that made me cry foul. No, as I watched the film, memories of the novel came flooding back in the most wonderful way. These filmmakers did a magnificent job of realizing the world(s) that David Mitchell had created.

The film boasts an impressive a-list cast that includes Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, Doona Bae, Ben Whishaw, Susan Sarandon, Hugh Grant, and so many others. And you've never seen these actors like this. No one has. Go to IMDB and read the cast credits. They're all double, triple, quadruple, quintuple, and sextuple cast! You can't possibly catch or recognize all of their iterations. The actors change age, race, nationality, and gender across the roles. The makeup work is extraordinary, and if the film doesn't win the Oscar, there is simply no justice. Trying to spot Hugh Grant (mostly in smaller supporting roles) buried under old man or cannibal makeup is all kinds of fun, but this is far more than Hollywood stunt casting. The casting reflects the novel's themes. It gets the message across at times almost subliminally. It also gives these stars the opportunity to really flex their acting muscles.  Tom Hanks brings down the house in a brief comic turn as a thuggish author. When have we seen this actor play so many different colors in a single film? It reminds viewers of just how good he is. Oh yeah, that's what those Oscars were for. The same can be said of much of the cast. I strongly encourage you to stay for the credits--at least long enough to see the photos of the actors in their many roles flash by. You will be shocked by what you missed. THAT was Halle Berry? you'll find yourself thinking.

Oh, and look for author Mitchell in a cameo as a ""Union Spy."" I didn't catch him, but I'll be on the lookout next time. Because I plan to see this film many, many times. There's just too much to take in. I'd venture I'll catch something new every time I see this film in years to come. Even at the lengthy running time of 2:44, I was ready to walk right back into the theater and start over from the beginning. The film held me transfixed, and I can't wait to see it again. Not to mention, I've already got a wish list in my mind of DVD extras!

I don't generally write movie reviews, but Cloud Atlas has inspired me. The ideas, the themes, the imagery of David Mitchell's wonderful and ground-breaking novel have sprung to life. It is magical. I attended an advance screening with several members of my book group the other night, and there was equal enthusiasm from those who had read the novel, and those who hadn't. Among my group, there were six thumbs way up, and one lonely dissenter--but she can write her own review. Mine is an unqualified rave. Go. See. This. Film.",1351036800,798,6017,4.729961832061068

5263275,5,B0095HHM78,"Sometimes, to be truly original, a film has to take risks. In many ways, the divided opinions about the film version of Cloud Atlas demonstrate that this is a film not afraid of taking such risks. It has some of the most beautifully moving scenes that I've ever seen anywhere in a film, and the movie has the rare ability to stick with you long after you've seen it. I would have been interested in any one of these story lines on their own, but the cumulative impact of all of them tied together creates a whole that is even more powerful that its parts. Having read the book, I have to say that the movie is both more humane and hopeful for the potential of humanity to better itself and break free of its constant cycle of self-destructive behavior.

Tom Hanks does a great job playing many parts (comparable to Jim Carey in Unfortunate Events) but really starts to feel like a marathon after a couple of hours. This movie suffers from mostly disjointed storytelling. I get that is the purpose, but leaves too much open for personal interpretation, so much you're left wondering is it really just bad writing? I have a general disdain for movies with loose plots and no reveals ""because art!"" This movie does that, but to a level that isn't subtlety brilliant or meaningful in any focused, specific way. It's rather mundane / boring and lacking any specific message other than, political progressiveness is the answer to everything and the opposite of that is to blame for all bad things in history past, present and future. Whatever your opinions on that: Are you really that entertained by a movie that makes it the only goal? It did have some pretty great comic value in one of the story lines similar to Waking Ned Devine. I also enjoyed some of the emotional human interactions of people doing good the face of adversity. But, even those aspects where completely predictable and lacking any real creativity.",1514937600,,1347,4.7076271186440675
5263292,5,B0095HHM78,"I am unsure as to why some reviewers are confused about this film when its concept is obvious to the viewer who pays attention, or reads the blurb.

From IMDb: ""An exploration of how the actions of individual lives impact one another in the past, present, and future, as one soul is shaped from a killer into a hero, and an act of kindness ripples across centuries to inspire a revolution.""  No confusion here.

Even Amazon spelled it out for all to read.  ""Characters meet and reunite in different eras.""  Yep.  Still not confused.

Got it!

Anyhoo...

This is a great film worthy of repeat views!",1514764800,3,598,4.566037735849057

5263294,5,B0095HHM78,"Sonmi, what a fabulous film about truth, the progression of the soul through the Earth School and the nature of love eternal!

Those on the metaphysical path will most enjoy this film, but it offers a peek into what reincarnation would look like for the open-minded or undecided.  The unreality of the concept of time is dealt with intelligently, in line with the illusion of time all happening simultaneously, in an instantespecially when characters tap into key events of future selves. Especially when these characters find an anchor of peace there.

The film also handles the theme of bigotry well, not content to simply expose it but also to offer the truth of oneness.  The film may be even more relevant to 2017 than when it was released in 2012.

The acting is superb across the board. Visually its a feast. It bursts with creative touches, such as one of the languages of the future, the orchestral music, the makeup and the costumes. Im not a fan of violence, blood and gore, but Cloud Atlas stays within the bounds of that which serves the story and the message.  Action sequences satisfy the modern appetite for speed; again, they serve the story well.

I never care for cutting back and forth in time so much that the reader or viewer is left confused about much of whats going on in the first exposure.  While it makes a book or film more compelling (addictive), it doesnt serve the message.  As a consumer of books and movies, and as an author, I believe that message is paramount.  So, I prefer to serve the message over that which makes a work sell.  Thats my only complaint about Cloud Atlas. Otherwise it is superb.

Be good to yourself and watch this wonderful film!  Watch it twice!  Im about to do just that.",1514073600,8,1730,4.592833876221499

5263300,2,B0095HHM78,"What a stupid waste of time and talent.
Multiple histories across time, with several actors playing assorted roles in each scenario. End result: mean people are mean. Well, duh.

I suppose the actors enjoyed hanging out with each other, and it's RARE indeed that it includes Hugo Keating in drag in a role as a male nurse (but it's not a comedy).

However:
It doesn't MEAN anything, and it tells no story. Shouldn't it do one or the other? Either have a great message, OR be entertaining? The film does neither, and takes a long time to do it.",1510790400,,543,4.474747474747475
5263301,1,B0095HHM78,"An opus of cacophony. A smattering of good acting, bad acting, ho-hum ""action"", comic book philosophy and a great example of a waste of time.
It actually warns us about the trap of time, flash forwards and flash backs. And on the surface, that's fine. Yet when combined with the stated point of souls affecting one another across time, the effort is flimsy at best and may serve to entertain some minds that don't want to think past the tagline. Having the same actors portray different characters does not establish a solid connection between those characters; and it's insulting.  Oh, Tom Hanks has a scar here; Hugo Weaving is now Asian...  These are just different characters who look alike. There were faint instances of connection...hints at Deja Vu or characters saying they had some sort of instinct. But these were extremely few and fleeting. The only carry over for a few of them was the comet-birthmark, but while this connection was interesting it was largely ignored.  And if there were examples of one character affecting others across time, they were not obvious or focused, and could easily be chalked up to accidental.",1509926400,,1135,4.901041666666667

5263305,5,B0095HHM78,"There are so many great, detailed reviews here that i don't feel the need to go over the plot. The thing is, for me at least, there is a synergy to this movie that makes it greater than the sum of its many parts.

The reincarnation theme was already very familiar to me. Likewise, the recurring patterns of human behavior, both on the individual level, and in societies. But there is something more here, that I can't put into words.

When I step back, and look at it objectively, it is a fantastic feat of storytelling. There are six complete, coherent storylines being told here. Each is told in detail, from beginning to end. When you consider that the movie is just under three hours long, and realize that gives them just under 30 minutes for each story, you feel that you have watched more than that.",1508630400,3,806,4.476190476190476

I'm all for movies being unique, but not to the point that you watch nearly 3 hours of uniqueness only to be left with a huge question mark as to what the movie was about. I'm sure those that enjoyed this movie will dispute my statement. The fact is that there was little to no moral reasoning or statement to be made by this movie. I'm sure the book was fantastic. My wife and I watched the entire movie for the simple reason that we hoped that the ending would shed light onto the crazy back and forth between timelines and characters. But alas no such relief was to be found. What they gave was supposed to be a happy ending, yet both of us scratched our heads as to why in the world was this movie made at all. The acting was fine. You have some really talented actors and actresses in this film. They played multiple characters throughout time (reincarnation I guess), and the actors did fantastic making each character unique and somewhat memorable. But we kept asking what in the world was going on as the movie jumped from one storyline to another within seconds sometimes. There was little continuity, and again I'll emphasize, ""What was the point!!!"" Was it to fight for what you believe in, stand against 'The Man', to fight for what you believe in no matter what society tells you? This was so crossed over from one story to another and they really didn't work. The movie was a mess and I gave it one star because the actors did a good job.

For the types who expect a movie to be short and to the point and who aren't curious or interested in the topic of reincarnation, do not bother even watching it for free.

The film does follow the book, with its wide range of characters and time jumps, but the problem is, it never flows as easily and enjoyably as the the book. The filmmakers, I guess, found that it would be a lot less ploding and slow, than jumping all over the map and times.
The book has 6 solid stories, which began in the 1800's, up to 151 winter's past the fall and then back in time, where the book ends exactly where it all began. If no one has read the book, I suppose it would be like thrown into a blender and set to 'High'.

I would like to say that all scenarios are 'equal' in meaning, but to me they weren't. That will be left to the individual viewer to discern. interesting acting, mostly good, especially by Hanks. It is a bit slow and confusing in parts, so this won't be for everyone. I think it needed a good editor as not all stories were created ""equal"".

Saying it was more than a tad overdone is an understatement and some of the make-up effects are in questionable taste. I get that it was in the name of continuity and not meant for comedic effect however it's still a valid issue that a film that attempts to show how our souls ultimately transcend our differences & we should all sacrifice and strive for equality, manages to do such a poor job living up to its own message. It comes across as both hypocritical and condescending when there were so many squandered opportunities to showcase more diversity in the industry.

Everyone in it did a fine job but surely they didn't have to play all their characters many incarnations as well. If the plot was slightly simplified, the film could have still made it easy enough to follow the narrative while opening up more roles for other lesser-known actors as well. They had the celebrity big names already so surely it would have been feasible. At any rate, it would be way less controversial and distracting.

I do feel like there was an earnest but misguided attempt at something more and real potential for an entertaining movie but it all got lost in itself ironically. I have a feeling the novel is better as this kind of intricate plot lends itself well to that format.

For those of you that frequent doesthedogdie.com, it would get a crying dog rating so be warned! That part was totally unwarranted as far as the plot was concerned.",1495843200,,1450,4.65234375

You are constantly wondering which actor is playing which character. This is a story that proposes a future world that forces a new breed of female slave into disgusting servitude, producing a Messiah like female Spartacus if you will.

I expected to be awed and overwhelmed by the implications of how we are all interconnected through generations. As I was watching I could see the intention of the story, but I didn't feel moved by it. I suspect much of the beauty of the original book is lost in translation to the screenplay (I haven't read the book, but now I plan to). As with many book to movie adaptations, there are too many character intentions and nuances that don't translate well to the big screen, so the audience is left with a cursory understanding of the character's backgrounds and emotions that drive them.

At leas I don't think so, this is a love or hate movie, I loved it and I don't care. The movie was , emotional and just damn brilliant. Easily the best movie of the year.

How do I talk about this movie? how? I do not know how to, it's hard to describe it. It is something you have to see for yourself. It's basically about reincarnation and how what we do with our lives, affects the future and how everything is connected. It literally goes deep into the philosophy of human nature, if philosophy is your thing look no further. The Wachowskis and Tom Tykwer all did a phenomenal job on it.

The film is strange, quirky and yet beautiful, not to mention it was interesting seeing how the actors and actresses played all these multiple roles. It was also quite clever. The movie has action, romance and humor. It deals a lot about Karma, also explores on why we humans are the way we are, as I said, it goes into human nature.

I don't know how to write a helpful review on this movie, I also don not know how to describe it but it's stuck in my head and I can't stop thinking about it. The Matrix is my favorite movie of all time but Cloud Atlas I think is on par with it. It might be the best movie of the year for me, but also my favorite movie of all time.

But I have to give all the artists who worked on this film credit for trying. The talent, such as Tom Hanks, who played such diverse roles, was stunning. Halle Berry has turned into an incredible actress in these latter years. The casting was superb. I have not read the book, and nearly everyone I know who has was disappointed with the film. That is as it should be.  Film will never top human imagination which is rather spectacularly multi-dimensional in a more fluid living 'present moment' context. How can we ever capture the internal experience on film that we can barely describe in words within ourself?  I have personally been awakened to past lives in this life, and am conscious of the ""objective observer"" soul that ties it all together. I would not want to be tasked with writing about it, much less making a movie that represents my experience, so I have to admire any human attempt at it.  This movie was well done from the two dimensional standpoint of film, except of course, our bodies are never so similar from life to life. The only thing constant is the inhabiting soul.  To depict what really occurs would be even more confusing for our puny brains.",1483228800,6,1345,4.7844827586206895

5263550,5,B0095HHM78,"There are some movies that you want to watch without knowing too much about beforehand so that you don't ruin the effect, this is not one of those movies.  This is a great movie, excellently acted and with beautiful visuals, but if you don't know a little going into it you may end up turning it off after 30 minutes because you can't follow it.  And that would be a shame because you would be missing an amazing experience.  The movie consists of six separate stories that occur in the past, present and future.  The issue is that they are not shown chronologically, instead they are broken up and mixed together in a way that can be a bit disorienting if you are not prepared.  To confuse matters even more the same actors play different parts in each story, sometimes good-guys, sometimes bad-guys.  This is done so that you can see the overall arch of the themes and how the stories and lives are connected.  If it was recut to be in total chronological order it would loose so much.  Its the kind of movie that I will watch over and over and see something new in each time.  Some reviews have said that it diverges from the book too much, adding in gratuitous violence and hitting you over the head with ideas that should be subtle, well, I have not read the book so this is a pure review of the movie as it stands on its own.  Is it long? Yes.  Is it boring, as some have said?  Well, it takes some time to develop and that can be tough in an instant gratification world.  It is the kind of movie that was probably destined to bomb in the theaters but will be loved once it is overplayed on cable TV, as long as they don't edit it to death.  It does have some violent content and some sexual images that you should be aware of but it also has a lot of adventure, sci-fi, humor and something too many movies are missing, heart.  In a movie landscape dominated by sequels and remakes and reboots and tent-pole franchises, where too much original content is really bad, Cloud Atlas stands out as a shining light.  Give it a chance, give it more than 30 minutes, heck, watch it twice.",1479254400,,2086,4.31025641025641

5263553,5,B0095HHM78,"This is a rather difficult film to follow, but it is worth the effort because the film prompts viewers to think. We all know that what we do can effect others. The Bible, for example, tells how King David foolishly ordered that a census be taken of his nation, and as a result tens of thousands died. With all good intentions, pious intentions, he sought on another occasion to bring the ark of God to Jerusalem, but it resulted in the death of a man who had been among a family that protected the ark for twenty years. We know the truth that a stone thrown in the water creates waves that go far. We know also how the future can effect the past: a man who was overlooked as a writer in the past is recognized as a great writer in the future and vice versa. In this film the past effects the future and the future effects the past, and much more. While this is science fiction, it is very instructive, and as it is called in the film ""true true.""
It is also fun to watch several actors who have several different roles. Tom Hanks is radically different in each role he plays, and it is fun to watch him do what he does so well.",1479168000,2,1127,4.1506849315068495

Since the author of the book participated in the conversion to a movie, he was able to keep to a minimum egregious changes. Which I place a high value upon.

Since Cloud Atlas could easily have turned into a Twenty to Thirty hour Cable TV Series, which just as high production values, squeezing it into a Three Hour movie was a pretty spectacular challenge.

The Direction and Production are incredible, as is the acting.

It is sad that the crux around which the story is built (The Orison of Sonmi-451) had to be so altered, but the central premise of Unanimity vs Union remained amid the plot changes.

The Structure of the story between the book and the movie is also significantly altered, with the book being a serial stepping through the stories, one after the next until you reach ""Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'ythin' After"" (The Narrative crux of the book, but not the Plot Crux of he book), at which point you then complete all of the stories in a chronological order backwards. The movie interleaves the story by narrative element and event, with the reincarnated relationships taking precedence over chronological order.

Thew way that they interleaved the plot for the movie helped to hide the changed made to the movie from the book in such a way that the overall Narrative structure was preserved.

This movie is deeply profound and takes your full attention and patience to understand the underlying premise. I had to watch it more than once to fully appreciate the brilliant presentation and profound message.

5263763,5,B0095HHM78,"TL;DR - This is a very good science fiction, perhaps the best in many years.

I'm not sure Cloud Atlas is directly comparable to any other sci-fi movie, so it stands alone in a category of it's own. Tom Hanks delivers excellent acting in this movie, of note would be his superb use of language in two roles. Speaking of roles, the movie uses it's cast of actors in many roles through the many stories told. In some instances it's difficult to observe who is playing dress up for any given character, which is a good thing. It would be indicative that the movie is captivating your attention, and the costume & make-up artists were doing a proper job. I'd also like to call out actor Hugo Weaving for his excellent performance, of note is his menacing monologue & dialog, very much harking back to Agent Smith in The Matrix. Speaking of The Matrix, the Wachowski's handles the later (best) parts of Cloud Atlas, the more science-fiction'ism parts. You can see their signature in Neo Seoul & the island stories. All the stories interweave at some level apparent, and not so apparent. You may notice new things on subsequent views. So you definitely get more value watching thsi twice or more, and it's definitely a movie you would want to watch more than one anyhow.",1468800000,,1264,4.6177777777777775

It's visually stunning and the film shows what accomplished actors and make-up artists can achieve, but frankly it doesn't make much sense in narrative terms.

I love stories in which different threads are woven together to make a coherent whole, but that never happens in this movie.

The actors, intricate storyline, and the visuals of this movie are amazing, building an immense movie that I could watch over and over again. Renting from Amazon was the cheapest and easiest way for my friend and I to watch this movie on a lazy day. She loved the story to and if you appreciate long-standing greats like Tom Hanks, Hugh Grant, and Jim Broadbent, you are guaranteed to fall in love with Cloud Atlas.",1465257600,,513,4.354166666666667

5263854,5,B0095HHM78,"A lot of people don't care for this movie and I would like to start off by saying, ""I understand"". I hate when people try to act like you didn't like something because you didn't ""get"" it; I hate when people try to assign blame for such things. It's an odd movie with odd rhythms and some folks just won't like it.

But for those of us who connected with it, it's a nearly magical experience, weaving together six tales from different genres to try to say something about the human experience. I don't know if I would describe it as a deeply intellectual film, although its construction requires a level of intelligence rarely seen in film, but it is a deeply emotional one, which draws upon the commonality of different people, in different times, in different situations, all struggling toward remarkably similar goals.

I liken its construction to a symphony as it weaves familiar melodies and themes into otherwise dissimilar movements. Something light and airy being linked to something dark and bombastic through subtle and not so subtle musical cues. Although in this case, the six movements (stories) play out at the same time, cutting back and forth via similar characters, plot devices, or actions.

In one scene, an elderly Jim Broadbent contemplates knocking on his old flame's door (played by Susan Sarandon) and they cut to Sarandon opening a door in another time... Broadbent lacking the courage to knock on his door. We see various characters chased by villains (comedic and deadly) with the action liberally cutting between them, using the need to get away from one encounter to propel the other chase. Lovers fail to connect in one time, but find each other in another. All of these character's lives affecting one another by the faint ripples left behind. A snippet of a terrible movie based on Jim Broadbent's comic escape from an old folk's home inspiring an artificial human's quest for basic human rights.

And while the movie isn't subtle about the way its various stories influence one another, the links are rarely that important to the individual plots. Those other lives inspire and connect the characters across time, but never play too grandiose a part. The stories don't build to one conclusion that hinges on all that came before, but six individual conclusions which play to themes of love and obligation to one another.

But as is the case with just about all Wachowski productions, it is a flawed journey. Many find it too pretentious by half and the gender and racial swapping of the lead actors is sometimes distracting; but for those who are interested in a film experience like no other, I highly recommend this film. Although I do recommend that you don't try too hard to connect all the dots. The stories are simple enough and it's much more about the emotional journey than it is an intellectual exercise.",1464825600,,2847,4.837782340862423
5263855,1,B0095HHM78,WTH did I just watch?  I purchased this movie @ $12.99 specifically because I love Tom Hanks. I was very disappointed in the movie and had to force myself to sit through it.

As a fan of the book, I enjoyed seeing the stories take shape before my eyes. Multiple roles played by each main actor added interest. I also liked the contrasting genres (1970's BlaxploitationThriller, Futuristic Action-Adventure, British Caper Film, etc).

5263976,1,B0095HHM78,"When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I knew it was something I should probably stay away from.  I've been tricked before by movies like ""The Fountain"" and ""Slipstream"".  However, I wanted to give ""Cloud Atlas"" a chance because some of my favorite movies are a bit atypical.

There's a certain genre of movies out there, as far as I'm concerned.  It's a genre that's designed to be abstract.  If you can appreciate ""abstract"", then it's possible that you may value this movie.

I enjoy thought-provoking movies, which can sometimes be, a bit, abstract.  However, I really enjoy movies with solid plots, relateable themes and characters, and unique concepts.  For me, this would describe movies like ""Cube"", ""The Matrix"", ""The Thirteenth Floor"", ""The Butterfly Effect"" and ""Identity"".  I even like ""Donnie Darko"", which is a movie that one 5-star reviewer compared ""Cloud Atlas"" to.  I love to be drawn into a story to the point of forgetting that I'm even watching a movie.  But then there are abstract movies like ""Cloud Atlas"".  The trailer is eye-catching, which peaks my interest because I love movies that are unique.  But I've learned to be careful, since some are just too abstract for me to appreciate.  ""Cloud Atlas"" is one of those movies.

Because I've been burned before with ""The Fountain"" and ""Slipstream"", I knew that ""Cloud Atlas"" could fall into the abstract genre.  So I didn't pay to see it.  Instead, I checked it out from my local library.  Within the first half hour, I knew that it was a movie that I wasn't going to be able to appreciate, so I turned it off -- Unlike with ""The Fountain"" (which I saw in the theatre), and ""Slipstream"".

I used to wait for movies to get better, but with the abstract genre, you're likely making a mistake if you wait and watch the entire movie.  It was certainly a mistake with ""Slipstream"" and ""The Fountain"".  Abstract movies don't generally get better.  They're not always designed to be coherent.  You can often spot them when the good, theatrical reviews are vague, calling them ""Visual Masterpieces"", or ""A Stunning Experience"".

I'm writing this review for people like me.  Clearly, there are some who value abstract films, hence the five-star reviews.  If you're in that crowd (AKA you enjoyed ""The Fountain"" and ""Slipstream""), then you may value this movie.  ""Mr. Nobody"" also teeters on this genre (At least I could finish ""Mr. Nobody"").  But if you're not able to appreciate such films, then I would suggest staying away from this one.

Before deciding to write my review, I figured I'd read portions of the good reviews.  I was curious as to why someone would like this movie.  I'm glad I read some of a good review.

Apparently, this movie is based on a book, and that book is a bit disjointed -- similar to the movie.  This, at least, lets me know that the director had a vision in mind.

To each his own.  I just want to let you know that if you're wondering whether or not this falls into the ""abstract"" genre, it does.",1458086400,5,2999,4.669216061185469

This movie ranks #2 place as my most favorite movie of all time (Just after Moulin Rouge at #1). It's beautiful and compelling.

""Where / when are we now? oh yea, we're in .....""  But any initial confusion is SO worth it! I've watched it 3 times now and it's one of those movies where more and more unfolds each time you watch it. Not a fault of the movie, but rather a fault of my own brain unable to take in so many nuances and patterns all at once. Watch it! and watch it again and see more. It's a movie that keeps on giving.

5264035,5,B0095HHM78,"A film about reincarnation. A group of souls are reborn again and again into different time periods, some in the past, two in the future and one time period is the present. The actions they take in one life may have repercussions in the lives to follow. Each soul is portrayed by the same actor or actress in  each of their incarnations (making it easier to tell which soul is which character from life to life). Sometimes they are reborn as a different ethnicity, sometimes into the opposite sex. After the film ended and I thought about it, I found it fascinating to chart the progress of each soul throughout their various lives. One begins as a ruthless murderer who gets just a little less nasty with each incarnation and eventually becomes a good person in the end. One starts out loathsome and degenerates each time around the wheel. Some start out quite enlightened and never stray from that path. One character in a record shop can't figure out why he is so obsessed with an old piece of music, completely unaware that he actually composed it in an earlier life. One character says of another that he is so annoying that whenever he opens his mouth, all she want's to do is to throw him off his balcony. In his next incarnation, he so annoys another that he actually is thrown off his balcony. Freedom is a concept explored in each life and the film does take some thought to fully understand and appreciate. I gave it the though and I loved it.",1455753600,,1454,4.507575757575758

Impressive script based on a very complex novel, top notch cast with many stars like Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, Doona Bae, Ben Whishaw, Susan Sarandon, Hugh Grant, and others. Has pretty impressive CGI and realism in all time zones, even the far future.

Negative:
The tone of the movie is dark, sinister, hopeless despair for humanity. Between the lines it seems to whisper ""Mankind is doomed to slavery. For Ever. Rightly so. Because you are too weak."" Each string of the story -whether in the early 19th or the 22nd century- is full of violence, sex and crime. If you enjoy believing it is the deserved destiny of humanity to be slaves... and I don't buy this sort of tainted alibi ""happy end"".
This piece of mind programming is dangerous to mental health. Therefore: NO THANKS.

5264059,2,B0095HHM78,"a good idea was totally messed up here.
With a cast that is probably hard to surpass in its prominence.
And also the trailer of Cloud Atlas is most probably the BEST TRAILER ever.
Really! With this super-120% -film-ad-bait you just have to run to the box-office without ever hesitating.

For this trailer does its job perfectly. Luckily I had the DVD borrowed from the local library for free. Thus, I am just a lil angry about the successful trailer rip-off and wasted lifetime.

If the 7 layers of time somehow do connect with each other, then I can not see anything of it. The whole acts as 7 short films that have nothing to do with one another except identical imagery. Likewise I felt no sympathy for any of the individuals, which is also not quite a surprise if you deal with 7 different short stories...

When two such different directing-philosophies as Tykwer and the Wachowski bros. co-direct a film project, perhaps such a film, no matter how visually overwhelming it may be, ultimately must fail in the end, because multiple cooks often spoil the meal, don't they?

And if I must watch it at least 3-4 times to understand only one iota more in return, then I'm certainly out of here.

I thought it was quite bad, but would rate it probably like 2 stars, because of the brilliant visual composition of the scenes...since they are really fantastic.

The multiple plot lines weaving in and out of each other and the dialects make it difficult to follow; I had trouble following it. It has some moral and philosophical themes, such as oppression vs. kindness, karma and reincarnation. It's long, some parts gory and shocking, and it isn't fluffy entertainment. I would guess many people wouldn't like it much for these reasons and that it did poorly at the box office. I would not recommend it to everyone.

I'm sure that all the people that worked on this film found it a very fulfilling endeavor, resulting in a visually beautiful movie.  The multiple roles for actors were rich and challenging.

The good bit is that NONE of the attributes I just listed get in the way of the fun of following the somewhat confusing plot of this movie! The trick, dear viewer, is to sit back, relax, and let the confusion play itself out because it all really DOES resolve itself at the end. Halle Berry is a little bit out of her comfort zone in the multiple roles, but she carries it off like the pro she is.

Due to following multiple story lines from different times, it was very difficult to stay interested in the individual characters, as after a few scenes you would be taken to a very different place that was only connected by the same actors playing different roles.  Often times I was left not caring for who the character was, but for how this story fits into the greater timeline of events.  A few of the stories in the timeline felt very pivotal but other such as the sick lawyer and the composer one felt like they were not nearly as important and could have been left out to be their own individual stories.  Seeing the same actor play different roles was very strange as well, because you could see you they suited a role perfectly for one character but not very well at all for another character.  It was very predictable as well, lots of deus ex machina and triumphant heroes.  Overall lots creativity and interesting concepts but not very good execution.

Still, I'm giving it to my son for his 33rd birthday.  He's smart and I think he'll be able to follow it after maybe a couple of viewings, since he's not a big reader anymore.  I myself have watched it a half-dozen times and always discover something new each time!  It's fun to pick out the numerous characters each actor plays.

Back and forth from past to future with little to no explanation of its events.  The only redeeming value it has is a few good special effects.  It is cheap and that is for good reason.  Don't waste your money buying it.  If you can find it on netflix or another online outlet watch it there so you can skip through the movie in what will most likely be record time and you won't waste space on your dvd shelf.

This movie was marketed all wrong, released as a Thanksgiving crowd-pleaser. Cloud Atlas forces the viewer to pay attention and think, unlike most big budget explosion-fests.

Cloud Atlas explores some very heavy themes of lif and death, love and loss, hope and fate in some very engaging ways. Well produced and directed, I highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to sink their teeth into a very meaty film.",1443052800,,547,4.757894736842105

But after watching the movie it seems to me that this is less about reincarnation of souls and more about recurrence of archetypes (in the manner of Joseph Campbell). I plan to watch the movie a few more times, and it's convinced me to buy the book.

If nothing else, at this price it's worth buying and watching simply as a game to see if you can catch all the characters each actor plays.

This was an overly ambitious attempt at something, but exactly what is only ONE of the questions you're left pondering.  I was hoping for something thought-provoking, mentally and spiritually stimulating in a metaphysical sort of way.  I was interested in seeing how it might explore life from perhaps, a reincarnation, past, present, future, karma, whatever, point of view.

What it did manage to do is to leave me feeling, drained, confused and wishing I'd somehow known better than to spend hours watching it.  I had no idea it was going to be such a hodgepodge of characters and story lines all mixing and blending, overlapping and bumping into each other.  Considering that I like and respect the actors and the ""subject,"" I was determined to see it through.  Early in the film, I can't say when exactly, I started to get the feeling that I might not enjoy this movie; but I didn't want to believe it.

At some point, I became aware of the time, how long the movie is and how I just wanted it to end.  I remember sitting there, really focused, concentrating, trying damn hard to understand and follow it -- to no avail.  It was like, Are you getting it?  Are you getting it? Yeah, ok, I think so, yeah ... no, No.  LOL

So, when (thank God) it was finally over, I sat there for a minute, thinking, ""What the heck was that?""  Then, I tried to make sense of some aspects, tried to remember which of the several characters each actor played and what the connections were, etc.

My head was swimming with things like, why were the fabricants asian, where geographically were they, what was all that about  ""we're eating soap and soap is us,"" Why??  Was Halle's character, (the first one) from another planet originally, was the ""true-true"" a reference to God and I was more at a loss in trying to understand who, what, when, where regarding Ewing & Sixsmith (or whatever his name was).  What was the point of the music being composed or the letters, or maybe it was more about the composer and the writer.  Oh, who cares?  At the end of the day, I just didn't care.  This movie was just a hot mess!  Ridiculous.  I finally gave up trying to make it make sense and then I found myself laughing at the absurdity of it all.  That was a lot better.

While I'm not a fan of Tom Hanks or Halle Berry I don't blame the failure of this film on them, although at times both seem very out of place in this science fiction/fantasy tale that seems to never end.  Which brings me the main reason I'm writing a review at all given that there are plenty of reviews across the board for this film.  I am very disappointed in the majority of sci-fi, fantasy, and horror epics that the Hollywood machine grinds out, this being yet another one.  I know that there are so many variables that go into making a movie of quality that it's easy for one that attempts to reach a high status to fall flat.  In this case I'd blame continuity of the storytelling and miscasting of characters as 2 of the top reasons this falls into the flusher.  I'm genuinely happy and surprised when films like ""Live, Die, Repeat: Edge of Tomorrow"" turn out so much better than I would have expected.",1440374400,,996,4.380434782608695

Tom Hanks as always was wonderful, this time in many roles,  but I leave you with this one warning.. Cloud Atlas is not a film fot those seeking action and adventure - although that exists in spades. Cloud Atlas is a film that you need to watch in a quiet place with no distractions.  And probably watch more than once. At times it is voilent and at others, quite cerebral, but throughout... it tells a story that spans centuries and possibly foreshadows  some terrifying aspects of the future.

The story follows several characters in several different time periods, and explores themes of reincarnation, finding one's soulmate, and predation/prey in human nature.

The story told is that of a philosophical one. There is a lot of meaning that can be taken from this. This is a deep movie that will make you think. It has many fast paced parts that can get you excited and there are some slow parts. I would say this is a drama fantasy with twists. It is a little hard to see where the story is leading which is a good surprise. I hate movies that are too typical and you can easily guess the whole plot before it happens. Everything is wrapped up as the movie progresses. Some people may not understand the movie  but I personally think those are people that are unfamiliar with different ways of thinking. The movie touched me and contributed to my outlook on life. I think this is one of those movies that accurately brought the artists message to the audience. I like it when movies can fully express themselves without being changed into cookie cutter money producers. Movies are supposed to be a form of expression and art, not just money machines. Many people may not have heard of this movie which is a shame. I'd like to think of this as one of my hidden gems that I can introduce my friends to. If you are looking for a blow em up simple scifi flick then this may not be for you.

5264506,4,B0095HHM78,"Spoiler Alert - Some plot line references. I was impressed with this film for several reasons. I loved the concept of rebirth of a person in various timelines and seeing how the character flaws and strengths translate with each generation. I was also impressed with Tom Hanks and the extended cast's facility as recurring characters. The acting is so well done that it was easy to give up 'looking' for who was playing what role. The only drawbacks to the film I could imagine would be the jumping of timelines in seemingly chaotic order. You meet everyone in fractured ways and you have to hunt for the birthmark to identify which of the characters is now carrying the soul of the main character through the story. Perhaps that is inaccurate, because it seems as though the concept of the soul as a vehicle for intention and meaning is the main character regardless of what or who is portraying it at the moment. It reminded me of watching ""Memento"" where a story is revealed in reverse and in jagged slices until a whole is revealed at the end.  I love stories in which my brain has to follow labyrinthine passes, but if you have problems with such devices, this may not be the film for you.  The reason I didn't give this a five star is there is a portion of the film that has use of Pidgin English--a made up language. This portion was labored at best. I understood most of what was being said by the end of these segments, but I would be surprised if most people would grasp the language on the first go-around. Visually, however, the scenes tell the story, so the language becomes superfluous.",1432425600,,1599,4.529411764705882

5264510,5,B0095HHM78,"Science fiction films are getting better. As enjoyable as it is, even Star Trek makes for pretty lame SF: every alien species speaks perfect American English and yet Chekov never overcame is Russian (RAAASHun) accent.

There are only a half dozen or so films that really qualify as serious science fiction and I rank Cloud Atlas at number three, after 2001: A Space Odyssey and Blade Runner.

(In some ways the very best hard SF film ever made is Terminator because it is, like all good science fiction, completely self-consistent. So much so that a very proud and smug James Cameron had one of the characters make the point in the film. But I digress.)

Like 2001:A Space Odyssey, Cloud Atlas leaps from era to era. We follow slave colonies in the nineteenth century, a young composer in the early twentieth century, an investigative journalist in 1972, a publisher hounded by a murderer author in 2012, the executed leader of a slave revolt in 2144, and the  world her sacrifice made possible centuries later.

The stories feature the same actors (among others Halle Berry, Tom Hanks, and an unrecognizable Hugh Grant who finally shows the world he can play other characters besides romantic leads) reappearing in different roles across different times. The frame story, which is also the core story, starts with a sage old man who yarns a tale in a language we cannot recognize but cannot fail to understand, a kind of future English where people verb familiar nouns and they noun their doings. By the fire the old man tells the tale, and we jump in and out of his tale and of other tales he isn't yarning but that happened just the same.

By the end, every story is resolved to a satisfactory dramatic conclusion. Sometimes the ending is happy, sometimes sad, sometimes unfair and tragic. We are left perplexed and wondering ""What does this all mean?"" and there is no simple easy answer.

In so many ways, this film beats 2001 and Blade Runner hands down. It avoids the heavy, grand, almost religious overtones of humanity's destiny that fill Kubrick's work and instead offers introspective insights into what destiny awaits the film's characters, and by extension what destiny awaits you and me. And while Cloud Atlas doesn't make me feel as much empathy for any of its characters as I did for the dying Roy Batty in Blade Runner, it does make me look at more aspects of what it means to be human than does Blade Runner.

But I cannot claim to understand Cloud Atlas completely. I don't mean that it is confusing and I am not condemning the Wachowski Siblings of being unclear. Quite the opposite: Cloud Atlas offers so much that it requires repeated reflection to gain insights. You've got to think about it a lot, you've got to forget about it, and you need to come back to it to get everything that it says. You need to live with it to understand the yarn that an old man will spin around a campfire a few centuries from now.

5264511,2,B0095HHM78,"A few pro's, and then one overriding con:

1. Big-name actors of the highest quality.  Great acting and dramatic plots.

2. Multiple separate stories gives good variety. Sort of like a novel with six short stories about different peoples' lives - with flash backs and flash forwards.  Pace within the separate stories is excellent, highly engrossing.

3. Visual effects and scenery are wonderful.

4. Sci-fi type themes, which many like.

5. Arty, too. Art-film like flavor for much of it.

Con:

1. I was unprepared and had not read the book first, a mistake. The sequences made this movie incomprehensible to me. Multiple stories of different characters, fine, a common film device. Then, the characters are picked up at various times in their lives, also common enough.  The presentation among the separate stories was, however, in reverse order and confusing. I didn't get it, finding it jerky, disconnected. and impossible to follow. Chaotic.

2. If not for this too-cute jumbling up of the multiple stories, this would have been a wonderful film. Or if I had a program or road map of events, I could have followed the various stories. You may find the asynchronous feature intriguing and novel, if you can follow the sequences. I could not and found the film frustrating and confusing.",1431820800,,1291,4.9581395348837205

5264519,4,B0095HHM78,"Overall, I liked this movie.  It was enjoyable to watch.  Part of that is due to the great acting from superb actresses and actors.  I enjoyed the individual stories as if I were reading a book of short stories.  I enjoyed some of them more than others.

My problem with rating the overall movie is I would really like to rate each story separately... lol, even though, they do have some ... ... hmmm connections...  If you don't want spoilers, let me just say that I walked away from the movie at points while doing chores ... some of it didn't keep my interest that much, and I didn't feel I really missed much by doing so.  However, I was usually missing small parts of the stories I did not enjoy.  Some stories I would give 5 stars and some 2 stars. It's weird that although I may not have enjoyed each story separately, they did thread together somewhat, and I liked that. I am still struggling to see all the connections, so the movie has drawn me in enough for me to want to research these.

I keep debating back and forth on whether to give the whole of it 3 stars or 4 stars and have settled on 4 stars due to the great acting, nice special effects, messages, and some of the stories.  The movie did change from story to story a bit quickly which made it feel somewhat disjointed, but I was able to keep up with those changes, and overall, I found watching the movie to be very enjoyable.

The actors came in and out of each story playing different parts.  The movie alluded to ideas that upon meeting for the first time, characters felt they had known each other before, but none of this idea was really explored or expanded on.  Characters in the stories often move from darkness to light inside their own psyches or vice versa.

I've heard the movie diverges from the book.

I won't go into all the symbolism.  I had to look a lot of it up in order to understand it, so I don't think it serves a movie review.  To me, I should be able to get all I need from the movie.  If I have to look things up from the book, then the movie didn't do it's job of explaining very well.

BEWARE:  SPOILERS! LONG!

The Stories:

1849 - a historical narrative written in diary format
Ewing, an attorney from San Francisco heads to the Pacific Islands to meet with a plantation owner to get a contract signed for his father-in-law.  While there, he sees a slave beaten very severely with a whip.  Their eyes meet.  On the trip back, he becomes ill.  A doctor on board is treating him for his illness.  We find out the doctor wishes to fleece him of his belongings, so he is the one making Ewing sick instead of treating him.  Ewing gets sicker and sicker.  Meanwhile, the slave stowed away on the ship, and Ewing helps the slave.  In the end, the slave saves Ewing's life.  Ewing burns the contract with the plantation owner and becomes an abolitionist.

This was not my favorite story only because of the parts with the evil doctor on the ship.  It just didn't resonate with me.  This story felt very disjointed on its own without the disjointedness with the other stories.

I do like the ending of it though.  O.K. so I'm going to break my promise and expand on a quote in the movie by using the quote that I think was in the book:  "" ... only as you grasp your dying breath shall you understand, your life amounted to no more than one drop in a limitless ocean! Yet what is any ocean but a multitude of drops?

1936 - A story written in romance letters - Also not one of my favorite stories although I love the music in it
Robert Frobisher is a talented young composer with a bad reputation for getting into trouble and being a prostitute.  We meet him when he is in bed with his handsome lover Rufus Sixsmith.  He is forced to run for it by way of the window as people chasing him start knocking at the door.  Without any money, he sets off to work for a famous, aging composer Vyvyan Ayrs.  He puts the music in Ayrs head to paper and plays it.  Meanwhile, he has a romp with Ayrs younger wife Jocasta and works on his own symphony, The Cloud Atlas Sextet.  The symphony has been in his head (and comes from another story in the movie and weaves through the stories).  Ayrs hears it and thinks it's in his head and is his idea.  He tries to steal it.  Frobisher shoots him (but doesn't kill him).  Frobisher runs and hides in a dilapidated hotel and has a floor to himself.  During all this, he has written to his lover and recounted the happenings.  Sixsmith goes to find him and is at the hotel in the lobby when he hears the gunshot of Frobisher killing himself.

1973 - Grisham-like mystery, action movie - Not a huge favorite of mine either - really - they would blow up a plane so as cover this up and keep it quiet instead of killing the guy and destroying the evidence before he gets on a plane??? I don't think so...
Luisa Rey, a budding journalist daughter of a famous journalist father investigates wrong doings at an nuclear power plant.  She is to meet with an insider to give her evidence and finds him shot in his hotel room with the evidence gone.  She does find the the letters written by Frobisher, and she becomes enthralled by them.  She goes to the plant for an ""interview"" and meets Isaac Sachs.  They feel a deep connection as if they already know each other.  He gives her the evidence.  He then boards a plane which blows up in order to have him killed.  Another insider, Napier, was a friend of her father's in the war, and her father had saved his life.  He decides to help her.  They are chased; she gets away, but he is killed.  What she found out was that the oil companies were behind the cover up at the nuclear power plant, because they want the explosion(s) at the nuclear power plant to happen, thereby, securing the future of oil.  She exposes them.  During this one, she goes to a record shop to find the symphony, The Cloud Atlas Sextet.

This one just seemed so contrived and unimaginative to me.  I don't know.  It's been done to death really.  It was nothing new to make you think.  I do like some of the quotes, though.

My favorite is from Isaac Sachs:  ""Belief, like fear or love, is a force to be understood as we understand the theory of relativity, and principles of uncertainty. Phenomena that determine the course of our lives. Yesterday, my life was headed in one direction. Today, it is headed in another. Yesterday, I believe I would never have done what I did today. These forces that often remake time and space, they can shape and alter who we imagine ourselves to be, begin long before we are born, and continue after we perish. Our lives and our choices, like quantum trajectories, are understood moment to moment, at each point of intersection, each encounter, suggest a new potential direction.""

2012 - the Comedy
Timothy Cavendish is an aging publisher.  He publishes a trashy book written by the brutish, thuggish Dermot Hoggins.  They host a book party.  Dermot sees a critic who wrote a bad review of the book and throws the critic off the roof.  You see the critic go splat on the ground and blood fly.  Dermot goes to prison. The book becomes a best seller from the bad publicity and makes a lot of money. Cavendish presumably spends the money.  Dermot's thugs/friends come after Cavendish demanding the money.  Cavendish finds out he spent everything.  Cavendish asks his own wealthy brother for a loan.  You get the idea that his brother has had to bail him out of trouble more than a few times.  His brother finally agrees to help but tells him Cavendish must hide as it will take a few days to get the money.  He send Cavendish to what Cavendish thinks is a hotel.  Cavendish signs in only to wake up in the morning to find out he signed himself into a nursing home (English) that is more reminiscent of a mental institution.  He and several other ""residents"" plan and execute their escape.  They go to a Scottish bar.  Those in charge at the nursing home chase them to the bar.  The residents rile up the Scots in the bar who then fight the English and save the day.

This one was funny.  :)

2144 - sci-fi movie in the form of pre-execution testimony - this one was my favorite!
Somni-451 is a genetically engineered clone made to be a worker called a fabricant.  She was made to work in a fast food chain of the future.  She and others like her live at their place of employment.  They work, get one ""protein"" drink called ""soap"", go to bed in a cofin-like cubicle in a room of coffin-like cubicles, and get up and work, on and on.  They do not have any rights.  Only consumers are treated like real people.  She is there to serve the consumers. After so many years (12 I think), they are taken away to  go through ""exaltation"" which you believe is maybe that they are freed.  They are all excited when it is their turn to go through it.  Another worker there talks her into breaking some rules and thinking for herself a bit.  That worker ""loses"" it and kills a consumer and is then killed herself.

One night Somni-451 wakes up and comes upon a rebel killing her master.  He takes her away.  They go on the run, but she is captured, and he saves her again.  They fall in love.  He shows her that her people are not freed when they become 12, but they are killed and made into the food that her people are fed with.  The rebels barrier themselves in while she records a speech with some principle beliefs to be released to the masses on the on-world and off-world colonies in order to cause the downfall of the government and the corporation/government, consumer and slave way of life.  The police get in, kill her lover, and capture her again.  She is to be killed., but first, one of them wants to record her story.  After she gives it, you can tell he is changed.  She is then killed, but she becomes a force of change and her words and story go on long after her death.  Her story resonates through future stories.

""To be is to be percieved, and so to know thyself is only possible through the eyes of the other... The nature of our immortal lives is in the consequences of our words and deeds, that go and impressionate themselves throughout all time...
... Our lives are not our own. From womb to tomb, we're bound to others... Past and present... And by each crime and every kindness, we birth our future...""

2321 - Post Apocalyptic Story - I liked this one except the language made it difficult to understand what they were saying at times
Civilization is rather primitive and the language is some weird hybrid language.  We are introduced to Zachary, a goat herder from a village on an island.  Zachary is plagued by a voice in his head that is manifested by a devil-like figure called Old Georgie.  Old Georgie tells him to do bad things.  There is a ferocious tribe on the island too who ride horses and paint themselves up in frightening ways.  The ferocious tribe kills his father and brother in front of Zachary while he hides behind a rock as Old Georgie told him to do.

Zachary's people worship Somni from the story before as a God.  They have a book of the words of Somni.

There are another more advanced, futuristic people on the world there, the Prescients, who travel across the sea on hover boats or ships.  One of them, Meronym, visits.  She is trying to get to the top of a mountain, because the radiation on the world is making them sick.  They won't be able to go on much longer there.  Zachary and Zachary's people believe the devil lives on that mountain.  They don't go there.  She asks Zachary for help, and he refuses.  But when his daughter (I'm fairly sure it wasn't a son) falls ill, he says he will take Meronym where she wants to go if she heals his daughter.  She heals his daughter, so he goes with her to the top of the mountain, where they find bones of dead people in futuristic looking buildings.  You get the idea that these were Meronym's people.  They were off-worlders.  Meronym causes a satellite signal to go up to the sky to send her message asking for help (presumably from her people up there).

Meanwhile Zachary's village is attacked by the ferocious tribe and everyone is killed but his daugher.  Zachary and his daughter go off with Meronym to her people's ship.

That's the only amazing part The idea to load up more plots and subplots in a movie and jump around from timeline to timeline and see how each is related to the other. Basically, we are all connected one way or another and in this movie it encourages the idea of reincarnation which is a lovely idea, but it cannot be proven anymore then all religious versions of the afterlife. The acting for each plot/subplot is usually well executed with only a few weak parts, but The relation between some of the characters is unclear and since there are more plots/subplots, it is easier to become confused which is why I don't know what the big fuss is.

5264616,4,B0095HHM78,"This is a very strong adaption of a nearly unfilmable book, and an emotional high point for the work of the Wachowskis (with Tom Tykwer as co-director as well).  As a reader of the book, the scenery is nearly a perfect match with how I envisioned the book during my initial reading. This is what amazed me the most.

Needless to say, I was a little obsessed with comparing the book to the movie the first time I watched the movie.  As a fan of the book, the adaption is loyal, but being that there are six stories, they needed to be somewhat compressed.  One big difference between the two media is that instead of the ""bookended"" linear narratives of all six stories in the book, the directors chose to interweave the six separate storylines, all while editing seamlessly.

It makes little sense to get into detail about the plot in this review, but it must be said that all of the stories are loosely connected, and all tie together with the common themes of both the compassion and cruelty of humanity. The concept of reincarnation is also a prevalent underlying theme as well.

Overall, the movie captures the emotion of the book.  The imagery is great, the use of the same actors in multiple vignettes is bold and effective, and I was entertained. It is long, and might confuse a casual viewer, but a patient and intelligent viewer should really enjoy this work.

I have a feeling this one will be discussed among film enthusiasts for quite some time.  It flew under the radar when it was released, but it is a hidden gem (as is the book). This is a great movie.

You are told everything is connected, but the connection is not easily seen to many because of the constant jumping from one story to another.  The direction and editing in this film doomed it and it showed at the box office as a huge bomb grossing about 25% of the cost.  An ambitious effort but poorly put together.  At 172 minutes one might want to pass on this one.  Too long to stay muddled.  Each story may be fine in half's, but distorted in random chunks.",1426809600,,806,4.548611111111111

However, of you are looking for a long movie with any kind of message, this one is for you. This isn't really one movie, but several stories rolled up into a three hour synopsis of how the things we do, or don't do, affect the future in ways that are unbeknownst to us. I would recommend  watching the movie with the Closed Caption on, especially as the movie progresses. From all the comments I have previously seen, it is a movie that you might have to watch two or three times to really see how everything is linked. Interestingly, almost all of the actors and actresses play different roles, with makeup done so well you might not recognize them immediately. (Hugh Grant's makeup is totally awesome to the point he may not be recognized at all.)

The movie consists of 6 connected stories set in different time and place. The stories are artfully woven together. They make you laugh, cry, think, feel deeply touched and inspired. It is close to 3 hours long but does not have a dull moment. There are so many layers to the stories, so much wisdom, so much beauty, I simply loved it...and  this comes from someone who does not even believe in reincarnation.

The actors are fantastic.  My favorite stories are the Adam Ewing voyage and the Neo Seoul sci-fi story. The ending left me gasp in awe. Now I am starting to read the book.

Spoiler alert............

It is a genius move to let actors play different roles in different stories. However, this has consequences. A theme of the movie is ""By each crime and kindness we birth our future"", but what happens belies this claim. The kindness of Sixsmith's niece in 2012 birthed her future as a fabricant--a slave-- in 2144; the kindness of Chang and Ewing brought Adam's fate of being eaten in 2321; For all the good Chang and Rey and Ewing did, earth still descended into a dystopian in 2144 and an uninhabitable place in 2321.

5264683,5,B0095HHM78,"I'm not surprised to see the reviews and ratings for this film are all over the map.  My rating makes my opinion obvious, but there's a caveat.  I had read and loved the book.  Coming at the movie cold turkey is going to confuse many viewers, as the six interconnected stories weave their way through hundreds (thousands?) of years.  The first few minutes that tease us with quick clips from all six is bound to be particularly confusing for many.  I was glad that the evolved English of the story set in the most distant future is brought to the screen intact, but it can also be hard to follow whether you read the book or not.

Fans of the book should know that liberties are taken.  Most of these were simplifications that were probably essential to the cinematic transformation.  But some of the stories are also given far less sad, cynical endings.  I was fine with this.  You may not be.

Lastly, be sure to stay through the credits!  You may be surprised to see who played whom in this vast and now very uplifting tale of human hope and choices.",1424649600,,1053,4.427083333333333

You almost are forced to the point to where you have to watch it more than once to follow the sub-plots of each reincarnation of the main characters.  In my opinion I think they could have done a better job than switching timelines every 2 - 4 minutes.  One minute your beginning to understand this new character than all of a sudden that same person is back in the past again, in a different life, than another few minutes later they skip you all the way into the future to their new reincarnation.  Overly confusing when it does not have to be.

Still, the movie, overall is worth watching, especially if your interested in reincarnation and what the future could possibly hold for each and every one of us, regardless of belief.",1424476800,2,866,4.490445859872612

5264748,5,B0095HHM78,"Having initially failed to get all the way through on our first attempt, even after our first complete viewing I didn't think I had anywhere near enough of a grasp on the complexity of the story to give a meaningful review. So much concentration is required to keep track of the reincarnated characters through the six time periods (1849, 1936, 1973, 2012, 2144, 2321 representing, presumably, the six movements of Frobisher's Cloud Atlas Sextet) that a second viewing is essential to even begin to understand its subtle elegance. Watching the second time with sub-titles also definitely helped to make sense of Tom Hanks' post-apocalyptic patois mumbling and also the central Sonmi character's heavy accent.

A simple film this is not; it is no wonder it bombed in the States where the average woodlouse would give most of our cousins across the pond a run for intelligence and attention span, although I can understand why it didn't do well in UK cinemas either as the aforementioned complexity and nearly three hour running time would have made for an exhausting and baffling experience. Watching from the comfort of one's own sofa where you can rewind and pause to interpret, discuss, pour another glass of wine and go to the loo makes it more like sharing an engrossing book than watching a modern movie.

I'm still not sure what the central message is (if there is a single one at all). We see the same actors playing different characters in each of the periods so, yes, reincarnation is a central theme but I'm not sure I totally understand the karmic aspect - do the nearly universally unpleasant Hanks characters redeem themselves in the far future where he helps the Prescients contact the off-world colonies thereby saving Earth? Who knows? Interestingly, now I think of it, following Frobisher's tragic suicide his character is not reincarnated in a major role while the aptly named 1936 Sixsmith character has a central role in each subsequent period. Also, the comet birthmark is interesting; does it represent the path of reincarnation or is it just a mark of a significant character in each period? I've no idea.

I can't remember having seen such an ambitiously complex, interesting, thought provoking and downright mind-boggling film before. In these days of mindless whiz-bang special effects, it is lovely to see an enormous financial investment in producing such an obviously non-mass-market movie; wonderfully cast, lovely to look at and a thorough workout for the little grey cells. Splendid stuff and we will have to watch it loads more times. Perhaps, one day, possibly not in this lifetime, I'll understand it fully.",1421452800,2,2642,5.0136674259681095

5264751,5,B0095HHM78,"As I said in the headline, my intention is to write the most useful and concise review possible for people who have not seen this.

1) Cloud Atlas is a very detailed, brilliant book, with six simultaneous story-lines. You could not possibly fit all the content of the book into any three movies, much less one.

2) Cloud Atlas, the movie, is a rough, abridged version of that book that contains the essence of the 6 stories and some of the big ideas that connect them all.

Therefore: If you have read the book, you are going to see a pretty cool realization of book. It should at least be entertaining, as long as you don't expect the movie to ""nail"" everything. They leave out some scenes, simplify some things and add some story changes to make it work for the screen, but most of the time they capture the spirit of the book amazingly well. The acting is stellar.

If you have NOT read the book, you will probably find that this is not an ""easy"" movie - the multiplot structure is less gripping than a standard thriller. You have to pay attention to know what's going on. On the other hand, this movie delivers a deeper and ""smarter"" story experience if you are willing to slow down and not expect an edge-of-your-seat roller coaster.

My overall opinion is that Cloud Atlas works but it is not an audience grabbing film the way, say, ""The Matrix"" is. For those willing to invest a little time and attention you will enjoy it and get a lot out of it, for those who are looking for effortless entertainment quite honestly you might be bored at times.

5264817,3,B0095HHM78,"I received the DVD of this movie as a gift. The acting, cinematography and music were excellent. For those who just want to pass the time, this is an entertaining enough movie, and people who are knowledgeable about Buddhism and like the philosophy will also appreciate the film. There is nothing I could say here that could detract from the experience for those who are sold on it. But I think there is something to be said about the message of the fabricant Sonmi that is not apparent to every person who is drawn in by a struggle against oppression: she seems, at first glance, like a martyr for the cause of individualism, and yet she is anything but! She is actually spreading a collectivist message.

The movie is based on a book that I have not read, but it is easy enough to grasp that it is about reincarnation, and I was perfectly willing to suspend disbelief on that issue and see how the different lives of the same characters developed. It was a little hard to follow some of the jumbled plot twists, but that is not my chief complaint. My real problem was with the speech that the fabricant-turned-goddess named Sonmi had to deliver.

It is always moving to see someone struggle to individuate and find herself even though she was raised only to be of service to others. In this way, I identified with Sonmi's story, up to the point when I began to understand the message that she was delivering to the masses: ""To be is to be perceived, and so to know thyself is only possible through the eyes of the other.""

That is the social metaphysician's creed. It is the very opposite of individualism. To be is one thing. To be perceived is another. Many of us struggle against misperceptions by others about who or what we really are. We might even experience joy by being perceived  more nearly accurately by a special friend. But being perceived is not primary. Existing comes first. If we did not exist, there would be nothing to perceive. While psychological visibility is something to be desired, life is not an empty hall with only mirrors in it. Many exist who will never be perceived by anyone, and this does not take away from who they are.

Sonmi also says: ""Our lives are not our own. From womb to tomb, we're bound to others."" That is what she was taught, when she was brought up as a fabricant -- to serve others. But someone who wakes up from that kind of collectivist nightmare ought not to spew forth the same creed. If she really believed that, why on earth did she rebel? She had the perfect set-up in which she was bound to others from womb to tomb. She even got to eat others in her group when they died and was destined to be eaten by them.

Which brings me to the whole issue of cannibalism which is at the heart of the Buddhist move toward vegetarianism. Cannibalism means eating and subsisting on those in your own group. It is actually not possible as a self-sustaining ecology. But the trophic pyramid -is- self-sustaining, because it is built on eating others who are in a different group, and who feed on something else. The lowest life forms do the work of transforming sunlight into food, but they are less sentient than those who feed on them, and the more complex the animal, the more likely it is to feed on other life forms.

The Buddhist move is this: remove the categories. Conflate self and other. Make the eater identify with the one eaten. Make it seem as if all eating is cannibalism and pray for a time when life as we know it shall cease. Make no mistake about it: the ultimate goal is to end life -- which is after all filled with strife and divisions into different beings.

The ultimate paradox is this: if we are all one being, a solipsistic creature that has a schizophrenic need to break off into others in order to be perceived -- then being perceived by another being is actually impossible, because there is no one else.

I am an individual. My qualities and properties are not defined by others, but I enjoy living in a world where social interaction is possible. Respecting and revering others means paying attention to the facts about them that are there even when no one is looking. Existence is primary. Being perceived is sometimes nice. But in order for mutual perception to be meaningful, we have to be real to begin with, and others have to have separate identities from ourselves.

5264836,5,B0095HHM78,"I really loved this movie. The reviews I read about this movie are mostly mixed. While most of the reviews about this movie state that it is about reincarnation, personally I find that the reincarnation element is such a small part of the theme that it is hardly worth mentioning. For those who just can't get past the reincarnation element, look at it more like DNA being passed down from generation to generation.
To me this movie is about fighting oppression because in every 'age' it is shown to be so. Halle Berry's character put it best when she said that we keep making the same mistakes over and over again. While it is depressing that there is always those who decide to commit deplorable acts against others, there is hope in that there will always be those who will do what is right and stand against oppression in turn acting as a warning to the oppressors! That is what this movie is about! (Viva la revolucin)",1418774400,,923,4.532934131736527

5264853,3,B0095HHM78,"This is a very long film with many story lines, time periods, and characters to keep track of.  I think the film is well done.  I was interested in finding out what happened to each character the the various story lines and how they were going to bridge them all together which they did.  But, it still leaves you with a feeling of , what did I just see, because it is so heavy in concepts.  It's that heaviness becoming both a positive and negative because while I like movies that make you think, this one becomes downright confusing.  (I probably need to watch it again)

The acting is good.  Tom Hanks brilliantly maneuvered through his tons characters,

 As far as what I took away from it after the first watch, (probably need at least two to grasp all the stories and concepts) . I liked that the movie made these characters and likewise all of us, change the course of who we are and our path in life with little moments and decisions.  I did enjoy the taking though time periods and such. That being said I give this movie three stars. It is well done, no doubt. The acting is good,  Other than enjoying Tom Hanks' performance It just will never be a favorite movie of mine.

5264855,3,B0095HHM78,"Like six movies muscled into one, Cloud Atlas is a raw, dense, ambitious mash of tangled wires and blinking lights. Needless to say, the film must be seen more than once to fully comprehend, and even then it's a nut that demands a viewer's complete concentration to crack. It's a mosaic, stitching vastly different subjects, atmospheres, landscapes and circumstances into the same cloth with mixed results. Things are so breakneck that, even at three unusually long hours, I felt like I was missing large swaths of story, merely scratching the surface of what was actually going on. The editing is partly to blame for that, with its dizzying leaps across generations (which, in some instances, occur several times in a single scene), and the heavy makeup effects - employed to cast the same actors in several roles, genders, ages and nationalities - are often a major distraction. For a film as loaded as this one, even a momentary pause to identify a vaguely-familiar face can tangle the feet, leaving us helplessly adrift in a sea of themes and imagery. It alternates between stunning and baffling in the blink of an eye, an experience that's both confounding and mesmerizing to behold. Kudos to the filmmakers for daring to try something so thoroughly different from the norm. It's magical on the rare occasions it all comes together and works as a single, monumental behemoth, but is also plagued by a swarm of ticks and shortcomings. I wonder if the time and effort necessary to actually access its thematic riches might be a steeper cost than many viewers are willing to pay. A complicated picture, both to ingest and to rate. Today's score may be subject to change.",1418169600,,1672,4.870175438596491

This book reminds me of Willim Gibson's ""Neuromancer"" which took all the awards for science fiction in 1980.  It was again a difficult book for me as a foreigner to understand, but I really like his style and ended up reading it 10 times.  Mr. Mitchell can write in so many different styles and he writes very well in eac style. I also love his idea of connecting the stories by reincarnation of the same souls over millenia.

From a literary standpoint, this movie will make the average viewer really WORK to keep up, with appropriate rewards for having done so. It is intelligently constructed and does not look down on the intelligence of someone who watches because it uses many time shifts, role shifts and outcome variations to suggest that not just reincarnation may be in play, but that the universe itself takes liberties (or perhaps is just careless) about what happens to the sentience that attempts to comprehend what's going on.

But, rather than suggest we are just all part of some sort of intricately intertwined series of life opportunities, the viewer suspects that we are existentially separate from the system that plays with us--which is very Greek. We are heroic despite conflict driven and historically driven events.

What might be distracting to some viewers is the appropriation by the writers of difficult to comprehend linguistic variations to reinforce the alien nature of the lives in different locales and in different times.

I personally enjoyed the film and much admire the work of all the actors in the film who played variations upon a theme of the essences of their characters.

Spanning 500 years, it tells the tale of a handful of people and how their choices, missteps and triumphs shape their future lives. Cloud Atlas boasts a great cast, among whom are Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugh Grant, Jim Broadbent and Hugo Weaving. Hugh Grant finally gets the chance to bust his chops on a role meatier than the expected romantic comedy lead. And he does a fine job! As do the rest of the cast. The movie has a lot of action, for those who like swift movement, and has its share of violence.

I have found, and my friends agree, that the best way to get the most of it is to read the book AND see the movie. The book is brilliantly written in a very unique style and format, starting at the oldest story, moving through time to the future, then back again through time to end with the oldest story. The movie on the other hand, jumps from story to story, all six of them intercut to better illustrate the relationships between them. But once you understand the basic concepts of what the author and film makers are trying to say you can appreciate the audacity and scope of the story. Unfortunately, neither the book nor the film fully convey the depth of Cloud Atlas on their own, but in combination it's a wonderful and moving story with brilliant writing, acting, direction and music.

That being said - in less than twenty minutes my husband and I took a break, he asked what I though of it and my response was ""it's brilliant!""

Other reviewers have encapsulated my thoughts very well, so I can only add that it's a movie that I will watch again - and most likely again.  Story is complicated, yet simple. Cast is stellar. Special effects and makeup are incredible.

In the very beginning, I found it quite confusing because I was trying to keep track of each and every character. But soon, I just sat back and watched, without trying to make sense of everything. And before I knew it, it all came together. The acting is amazing and really gave each actor opportunities to be incredibly creative. It really doesn't fit a genre because there are so many time periods that overlap. I loved all the details in it, many of which I missed with the first viewing, but then were brought to my attention during the post movie interviews.

If you are looking for mindless entertaining, something light and easy, this is not for you. This movie is deeply philosophical, and requires you to let go as well as follow complex thoughts and ideas.

5265100,3,B0095HHM78,"This film certainly doesn't lack for ambition, with a grand classical score trying to hold the six frenetic narratives together, but ultimately it falls apart, because in the end it sells itself as some aborigine origin myth with an unrecognizable Tom Hanks as the storyteller.  Cloud Atlas owes itself to a composition written by a young gay musician, who finds himself hopelessly indebted to a master composer, seemingly with no way out and the only hope of getting his composition to print is by his gay lover, who transcends two stories in this very complicated yarn.

I got the sense that young Robert Forbisher was the heart and soul of this narrative, at least his was the most compelling story for me.  He's been bouncing around from one place to the next, until he lands a job as a music copywriter to the great Vivyan Ayers.  He thinks he has earned the respect and love of Ayers for his valuable servoce, only to find out that the cagey old composer has no time for him and is going to steal his precious composition away from him.  So, begins one of the many chases that propel this movie along.

I guess if it is the Wachowskis and Tom Tykwer this is what you should expect, but unfortunately these adrenalin-charged stories do nothing to reveal the transcendental nature of this film.  Instead we get a kind of Ralph Waldo Emerson on speed, as told to kids by Old 'Un Zachry (Hanks).  Sure, we get all these tell tale signs along the way like the comet birthmark the main characters all seem to bear on one part of their anatomy or another.  This is apparently some link to an extraterrestrial source, at least one assumes.

As a viewer you are forced to assume many things if you haven't read the book, which I had not, like what was the value of Adam Ewing's book that young Robert was never able to finish.  We saw the second volume propping up one of Vivyan's tables, but Robert failed to notice it.  Not that it mattered at that point, as he had to bid adieu on such short notice.

Ewing's tale starts the movie.  He is the son of a wealthy San Francisco trader, who has a plantation on some remote Polynesian island, Hawai'i one presumes.  The tale is set in 1849 and Ewing becomes appalled by the slavery on the islands, although Hawai'i didn't become a US territory until 1898.  One assumes the book had some value in its day, as Ewing, who managed to survive the voyage home thanks to a stowaway slave, would play a role in the abolition movement, but we never find out anything more about that.

Rather, we see how we are eternally bound to each other throughout the ages, as this movie fast forwards to a futuristic corporate fascist society set in Neo Seoul, conveniently enough in Korea, but you can take this as a heavy handed allusion to New Soul.  Only problem is that very few persons seem to have a soul in this world dominated by clones.  The same actor who played Ewing is now made to look Asian and leads the rebellion against the corporate fascist overlords, thanks to a female servant who had been his wife 500 years before.

The transcendental references seem to owe more to Carlos Castaneda than Emerson, and there is even a reference to Don Juan in the stylish 1970s era segment.  The use of the same actors across time is also not unique, but certainly taken to extreme lengths in this film, with heavy make-up partially covering over their identities.

Hugo Weaving seems to play the villain throughout, at one point made to look like Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over a Cuckoo's Nest in the highly amusing segment set in present-day England.  Jim Broadbent is wonderful as a publisher who tries to take advantage of the success of a book thanks to the pug-nose Irish author (a hilarious Tom Hanks) throwing a snobbish critic off a balcony.  Broadbent tries to seek refuge with his brother, who dupes him into checking into an assisted care house, lorded over by a tough nurse played by Weaving.

Time ultimately takes the form of a circle and we end up where we began on the Polynesian islands with Zachry helping an Offlander (Halle Berry) scale the highest peak, Mauno Loa one presumes, to find an answer to this vicious circle they find themselves entrapped in.  While the story definitely appeals to an older audience with its complex narrative, Cloud Atlas feels like it was aimed at young teenagers.  After the enormous success of the Matrix series, I guess the Wachowskis thought they might bring a more heady mix of action, romance and transcendentalism to a young audience.  Unfortunately, it left me cold.",1407024000,,4557,4.5995055624227446

5265123,5,B0095HHM78,"OK, First of all you must know a little something about this movie to even begin to get 10% retention and understanding of what you are experiencing. This Movie is an Experience, I could not believe it did not win for Best Picture in 2013 here in the US. I will not repeat great insight and reviews already written here. But I do want to give you some advise, I saw the movie at the Theater twice, I wanted to go a Third time, but I just didn't make it. I bought the Blu-ray from Amazon. It is a master piece and I feel quite confident in years to come it will be a cult classic when people start awakening and learning more about reincarnation, cause and effect. In essence Karma. The advise is this: eat, drink, use the restroom do all the stuff you need to do, turn off your phone, do not leave the room, do not take your eye's off the movie, do not pause it. Put it in your DVD player get comfortable and push Run Movie.
There maybe a time or two where you want to stop the movie, DO NOT take your eye's off one scene, or you will not find your way back. I had to watch this film twice at the Theater just to grasp a small part of its message or even understand in small part what I had just experienced.  I have only watched it once on DVD, I am sure I will find the right afternoon this late Summer or in the Winter to settle the house down and my mind to watch it again. There is more to take in here than your brain can sort, so watching it several times under the right conditions are highly suggested. If you want a challenge, if you want to learn about Love. This movie can help you. It is not for everybody, most people are not yet ready for this much information on the Soul. So read some of the reviews, buy it and watch it in it's entirety. I can assure you that it is more thought provoking than any movie you have ever seen.",1405814400,,1841,4.030054644808743

I'm not going to pretend that this is the easiest movie to watch. It's not mindless popcorn entertainment, it demands of the viewer that they pay real attention and experience a few frightening or gory things. But in return, it tells a remarkably rich and stimulating story of a complexity unparalleled in contemporary film, with acting performances that are breathtaking in their realism and humanity.

My best recommendation to you as the viewer is, DO NOT *TRY* TO UNDERSTAND THIS FILM. If you sit there watching and trying to fit everything together like a puzzle, you'll become so annoyed with doing that that you'll miss the wonder of the film. Instead, just watch and let the experience happen, and trust that understanding will come to you on its own without you having to actively work to figure it out. Seriously - if you try to understand it you probably won't, but if you don't try you probably will. Even then, you probably won't get it all at once, so if you sorta liked it but were sorta puzzled by it, try watching it a few more times and you'll find yourself seeing and understanding more.",1405036800,,1147,4.645320197044335

I somewhat found the ability to have the self-forced, cerebral stem hemorrhaging patience to watch this film for about two hours before I eventually gave up and screamed ""I JUST DON'T GET IT!!!"", and I darn near broke my DVD player removing this rented DVD from my disc player.

However, after watching the Hunger Games films I asked myself a simple question.  ""If I do reincarnate, is this the kind of future I want to reincarnate in?""

With that, I returned to Cloud Atlas, but this time I took a step back to see the characters differently.  Instead of focusing on their physical aspects, I saw them for how they are portrayed.  Souls evolving through multiple lifetimes and that's when the brilliance of this film shone through.

It's basically about karma and reincarnation.  It's about how souls travel through lifetimes that intertwine and affect each other throughout history.  About how the same dynamics and issues come up lifetime after lifetime, and how we must learn how to overcome them.  It's also about the concept of freedom and slavory (in it's many different forms), and how the soul can be trapped by limitations and various forms of exchange encroaching upon one's life, and how the spirit must try and rise above such limitations and help others rise above theirs.  As Somni says, ""With every act of cruelty, and every kindness, we birth our future.""  If you like stories and movies that make you THINK, you'll enjoy this one.  And as good as the movie is, the book is even better.

Through all these lives, Karma is played out, so that whatsoever one sewed in one life is reaped in another with the same people. This will become a classic over time as people get more comfortable with the idea of reincarnation, a concept that was accepted the world over until about 535 A.D. when the Roman Catholic Church put and end to the belief because they felt that they could control people better if they believed that they only had one life to live.",1402617600,14,1045,4.419689119170984

Multiple characters played by only a handful of actors give this film about the universal connection of people to each other a flair that blew me away. Every member of the cast is outstanding and I'll never understand why this was so ignored when awards were given out. Brilliant acting, editing, cinematography and special effects, as well as every other element to detail provided were, to me at least, a comprehensive and complete story about where man has been and where he's destined to go.

5265235,4,B0095HHM78,"In some respects - bringing David Mitchells five hundred page prize-winning book to the screen was always going to be a challenge  and the outcome  hotly debated. With six different stories interweaving while several culturally different lead characters overlap in different time frames and even parallel worlds (past, present and future)  the result was either going to enthral or irritate. And 2012's ""Cloud Atlas"" manages to pull off both with a great deal of aplomb.

Dont get me wrong  as an independent production with a budget in excess of $100 million (a huge amount for an Indie flick) - this is bravura filmmaking  hugely ambitious, daring, technically amazing - and mad as Mr. Loony McMad of the Clan Bonkers. I loved it  but others may feel that its just a load of arty-farty pretentious twaddle  and after watching its near 3 hours - be in need of a serious ""Call The Midwife"" bender just to get their real world bearings back.

Ok here goes. It begins in the Pacific Islands in 1849 (dont they all) where Adam Ewing (Jim Sturgess of ""Across The Universe"") is crossing a shale beach and meets the decidedly odd and slightly seedy Doctor Goose (one of six parts for a stunning Tom Hanks). This leads to a dinner discourse with a reverend and his wife (Hugh Grant and Susan Sarandon)  after which we see Ewing visiting their plantation in blistering heat and seeing first hand the lashing of Autua  a Moriori slave tied to a totem pole (David Gyasi). Ewing is overcome and faints. Waking up he finds himself being tended to by the jabbering Dr. Goose (whose noticed Ewing has a key around his neck to a chest of valuables). Ewing naively suspects nothing. Then on a ship at sea - the hideous and greedy Doctor Goose begins poisoning Ewing in earnest. Autua (who has stowed away on board) stops the final lethal dose and Ewing takes the dark man home with him to the USA  where he and his wife are involved in the movement to abolish slavery.

We flick forward now to Cambridge in England in 1936 where a young composer called Robert Frobisher  (Ben Whishaw  the new ""Q"" in Bond's ""Skyfall"") is desperately seeking 'fame and fortune'. Hes writing a musical masterpiece called ""The Cloud Atlas Sextet"" based on the chronicles of Adam Ewing. He has a birthmark on his back that looks like a comet and a gay lover in his bed  Rufus Sixsmith. But Frobisher wants that shiny 'fame' - so he goes to work in Edinburgh for a different kind of devil - the aging and arrogant composer Vyvyan Ayrs (Jim Broadbent of ""Any Human Heart""). Ayrs hasn't written anything of substance for decades because of illness but recognizes the young Frobishers stunning melody played on the piano one day - and as his employer  tries to claim the meisterwork as his own. Feeling dumped on by his employer and spurned by both his muse and his lover (a misconception on his part) - Robert climbs into an empty bathtub and puts a German Luger into his mouth

Now we are decades later in San Francisco in 1973  and Rufus Sixsmith (the lover of Robert Frobisher played in both scenes by James DArcy) is an old man - and now an eminent nuclear physicist. By chance he holds open a lift in an office building for a woman who has just left a drunken boor at a party (""The age of chivalry is not dead!""). Louise Rey is a beautiful and brave journalist who works for Spyglass Magazine (Halle Berry  again one of six parts) who thinks shes onto something about a billionaire oil company man called Lloyd Hooks (a sensationally good Hugh Grant  another one of six parts) and a nuclear power station. Hooks hires a hitman to take the journo out. And Louises car - along with a damning report from Sixsmith - are forced off a bridge. But shes not about to be put off by a little corporate drowningand eventually exposes the monster (who may return in later guises)

Then theres the society rebel Tilda in Neo Seoul in 2144 and Dermot the dog rough Irish author of ""Knuckle Sandwich"" in Londons 2012 who literally throws a critic off a balcony. And on it goes to a future world where Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugo Weaving and Susan Sarandon (and an unrecognizable Hugh Grant) live in a post apocalyptical environment of simplicity and spaceships that visit every now and then. Its over 100 winters after ""The Fall"" - an event that has wiped much of civilization  and now people speak a form of gobbledygook English - and cannibals on horses roam the earth with full-body tattoos and huge carving blades.

It ends off-world  sat under the stars by a campfire at night - an old man (Hanks) telling tales to enrapt children about all that went before  and how we are all connected - and must look out for each other if were to survive

Directed by Tom Tykwer and both of The Wachowski Brothers (""The Matrix"")  the visuals across all time frames are truly stupendous (even stretched to Full Screen aspect). Its a looker on the BLU RAY format and originals come with a natty shining card slipcase.

The BLU RAY special features are impressively indepth with loads of featurettes on the 'making of' with all the actors clearly enthused about the whole history-bending thing. Audio is DTS-HD Master Audio: English 5.1, Dolby Digital, Castilian Spanish 5.1, French 5.1, English 5.1 Audio Descriptive Service while Subtitles are in Castilian Spanish, English and French.

Perhaps because it opens with Hanks mumbling largely unrecognizable words (future English)  it annoys from the very start  but this is the kind of film that repeated viewing will show just how deep the narrative and adapted-script is. ""Ancestry howling at you"" Hanks character says. The breath of this thing is monumental  and at times threatens to overwhelm everything. And yet I felt it didnt. You are grasping to connect the dots on occasion for sure  but thats half the fun  and the actors get to go to places on a huge amount of differing levels.

In the end - is it all about slavery  about how evil simply changes faces and forms as time goes on - or about the connections that bind us all - is there a ""method in this tale of madness""?  This movie reminds me of Jaco Van Dormaels ingenious ""Mr. Nobody""  a multi-layered Sci-Fi storytelling extravaganza from 2009 thats just as wild and brave in its scope (and he got there first).

""Cloud Atlas"" is ambitious stuff - and as one of the extras tells us  its ""A Film Like No Other"". And I for one am glad of that",1400198400,2,6397,4.595950704225352

There were over 300 things to notice and enjoy, and those were just the ones I found.

5265270,1,B0095HHM78,"There are plenty here who laud and praise this ""Edsel"" of a movie crafted as :  'how to understand the transmigration of souls""..with endless depravity, murderous, larceny, lust, greed, revenge, brutal sadistic control of other human beings , that if you are ';stronger' you have the ""mother nature's all natural"" right to devour them, even literally devour them with your mouth. This ""The strong devour the weak' a  fundamental ""law of human existence""  is NOT natural..as in ""200 million years of evolution has deigned that this is all you get""..all limned out by what are actually washed up actors, soon to be forgotten.
And THIS for the  putative sophomoric reasoning that there is NO such thing as a righteous Creator who will exact mind numbingly harsh judgement on each and every ""perp""among you, and yes, you especially!...but of course, there is a just God who records every idle thought-so that upon your death, your 'sentence is read' to you, and even 'instant playback' of your sadistic cruelties. You then will be escorted to a place to sufffer the exact same cruelties you executed on the 'weak' the innocent', and the vulnerable in your short, dark, rapaciously selfish life.
In the 50's, we did not see on nightly news shootings, stabbings ( one young woman just last night on local news,...filmed sitting in court for having savagely stabbed her 'boyfriend' repeatedly , leaving blood splashed all over the house...for the poor victim's brother to find, and while interviewed on camera choked out great sobs of sheer horror, crying that  he'll never forget)...you see?.....or almost every single night an arrest of a pedophile who raped and murdered a young girl or youn boy.
So to produce a movie, spending hundreds of millions of dollars to play these scenes of vomit wretching horror, in scene after scene after scene....this is to ""help us  in some way""? This is ""genius""?  I suppose Satan and his army of human sacrifice cannibals could be called ""brilliant...& genius!""...too?
There is nothing whatsoever ""genius"" about such a fetid stinking bag of visual imagery , designed to make the viewing audience wretch their high carbon, sugary drinks and stimulants onto the already sticky floor of the theater.
 So the buddhists, (they tell us in other reviews) leave the theater/movie experience, glowing with satisfaction, that ""someone finally told it like it is""?.
Listen to me carefully...Yes, God's adversaries do indeed dominate this world. Each and everyone of us are given the opportunity to choose who we will serve.

This 'winnnowing"" to separate the wheat from the chaff, & separate  the putrid slimy offal, from those with souls like shining Gems...this is the reality. You will NOT be returned to this level of existence, ever again if you CHOOSE not to expose yourself to these kinds of human depravities and aberrations as your ""food for thought"", your primary amusement and entertainment. You must willfully and deliberately choose never to allow your mind to entertain any  thoughts, like the parade of scat droppings like this... and you must always very carefully screen your 'applicants' whom you choose as associates, friends, and partners for life. So how does one do this with any certainty?...you can play such a movie before them..and if they call it ""genius""...say goodby to them forever.
If they ""enjoy"" something like this, they are by definition dangerously depraved. Get them out of your house and  life NOW.

 It would be so lovely if we could somehow stop the sick and vile nostril stinging stench coming from Hollywood skanks from producing excrement like this...but alas...they are making gobs of money...which they then can use to rapaciously RAPE and  exploit the weak who stumble into their web of intrigue. They think like this because these films make them rich, therefore ""strong"" therefore they have a (false god ) given right to devour the innocent""...you the hapless, naive, woefuly ignorant purchaser of films...with names of actors you trust....the cruel hoax is on you.

The plot has been called dull and unoriginal. I do not entirely disagree. The concept of reincarnation has been revisited many times and so has the ""we are all linked together"". But what makes Cloud Atlas unique is how it delivers these concepts.

Ask yourself this question: Assuming for a moment that reincarnation is real (i.e. the continuation of one's individual life in one form or another), why would it be a good thing? Why would reincarnation be something to wish for?

It is because we view life, our Human Life as something enjoyable that we wish to continue experiencing.

And what makes it enjoyable?
The Human Experience. Other Humans. Other People. Acts of kindness towards one another. Loving someone else. Helping a friend.

This is the central message of this movie. Life is only worth having because we have each other. We are all connected not through some telepathy or whatever, but because we are all the same.

I can honestly say I haven't seen many I haven't liked. Directed by the Wachowski brothers (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matrix-Trilogy/dp/B001DJLD1M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matrix Trilogy)</a>, and a who's who of top name actors/actresses, I thought I was in for a treat. I can imagine many finding this film to be a breath of fresh air or a work of art. However, I struggled not to fall asleep before I began to mentally suffer. I watched 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes and I was asking myself what was going on. Nothing connected, all the different stories didn't make sense. It might if I had watched the whole film. Though I wasn't sitting for 3 hours until the ending for it make sense. What is the enjoyment of that? The time periods jump around all over the place and left me completely confused. I want to be grabbed by a film, something that says by the end of the film I'm going to be blown away. This film had none of that. This was made on a 100 million dollar budget? Tom Hanks wasn't even appealing. He was caked in makeup with a terrible accent in every scene. I'm surprised others found enjoyment in it. For some reason certain people think it's uber cool and so deep. And God forbid if you negatively review it. Definitely one of the worst movies I've seen all year and maybe of all time. The only other film I found just as overrated was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gravity/dp/B00HJ92QTI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gravity</a>.",1395014400,,2309,6.08282208588957

5265325,3,B0095HHM78,"It wasn't bad. It had drama, action, story, plot. It lacked a certain Je ne sais quois. It was really choppy, switched back and forth too much. It was anything but smooth. I'm all about in depth plots and complex themes but overall I think the actors were awesome, the action, scenery, and picture was great but the directing, and how the movie connects was lacking. I think with a few rewrites this could have been a big winner. The budgest was 100 million and you can tell it has a lot of beautiful pictures/scenery. It only made 30 million profit at 130 mil. I feel amazon's rating is absolutely dead on with a 3 and a half stars. It such a shame how many amazing movies turn out to be overall 3 1/2 stars when they could easily be 5 stars with just few few small changes, rewrites, or directing. I also am a little bias toward movies with happy endings and in a hero/historic sort of sense it was but I'm all about the hero riding off into the susnset with the girl on a horse sorta of ending :) thanks for reading.

5265330,5,B0095HHM78,I loved the book by David Mitchell and (at first) never thought this movie would touch it. I stand corrected.  The movie starts out like the book....kinda confusing..... but it quickly becomes coherent in its purpose.  It shows the lives of the characters repeating throughout time and circumstances....but also shows how love shines through.

5265344,5,B0095HHM78,"Lana Wachowski's CLOUD ATLAS (Germany/USA/Hong Kong/Singapore-2012) is one of the most baffling and yet compelling films I've ever seen. Not a single story, nor set in one time, the film shifts constantly and often quickly between the years 1849, 1936, 1973, 2012, 2144 and 2321 on ""the big island.""

This last is most confusng of all and most critical to understanding the purpose behind centuries of reincarnation. Some of the post-apocalyptic world's inhabitants are from the Dark Ages in dress. Their nemeses are a tribe of cannibalistic warriors. A woman described as an ""offlander"" Prescient arrives on a fusion-powered airship. She's searching for the Cloud Atlas satellite station and the ability that it holds to broadcast the truth to Earth colonies.

The 2144 story is set in Neo Seoul. It's about a genetically-engineered clone, a young lady living a regimented life as a waitress at a futuristic fast food restaurant. She's rescued from this drudgery by a resistance fighter who shows this girl what the real world looks like. She's awed by the revelation and freedom from her former slavish existence, but is shocked to learn that her fellow replicants are killed and used as food for others like them.

The 2012 story concerns a British book publisher who, through the trickery of a vengeful older brother, mistakenly commits himself to a home where he's abused by a sadistic head nurse.

In 1973 a young investigative reporter played by Halle Berry is targeted for assassination after she learns about an unsafe nuclear reactor.

The 1936 story is about a young man who becomes the musical transcriber for a world famous composer. (He had to leave his boyfriend to take this job.)

Events in 1849 concern a San Fran lawyer who's traveling on a three master. He befriends a stowaway slave that he'd previously witnessed being severely whipped. An on-board doctor who wants to steal the attorney's possessions is slowly poisoning him.

IMDb's description only sheds a bit of light on this (rated 7.6) constant shuffle of plots and ages:
""An exploration of how the actions of individual lives impact one another in the past, present and future, as one soul is shaped from a killer into a hero, and an act of kindness ripples across centuries to inspire a revolution.""
also
""Everything is connected: an 1849 diary of an ocean voyage across the Pacific; letters from a composer to his lover; a thriller about a murder at a nuclear power plant; a farce about a publisher in a nursing home; a rebellious clone in futuristic Korea; and the tale of a tribe living in post-apocalyptic Hawaii, far in the future.""

A huge cast includes Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugh Grant, Jim Broadbent, James D'Arcy and Susan Sarandon. Most actors appear in two or more of the stories, some in all six.

But such ""work"" is well rewarded. Cloud Atlas was brilliant. Lovingly photographed, painstakingly edited and directed. Each major actor played multiple roles and delivered outstanding performances as different characters whose lives intersect across about 500 years, from past to future.

The special F/X serve the story - there's nothing gratuitous. The cinematography was glorious, the acting spot on.

There are bonus features I've reserved to watch later. I'll also re-watch the Trailer. In time, I'll even read the book (described by some as ""unfilmable"" due to the plot's complexity). While no doubt certain characters were consolidated and scenes left out, I believe they made a brilliant movie. It won't be to everyone's taste - as I said, you must be willing to pay close attention. But while ""message"" films can feel preachy and overlong, Cloud Atlas was neither.

Most of the actors play 5 different characters and have crazy make up on so you don't even realize its them, also the best futuristic Korea I have ever seen. Pretty much all the love stories are sweet but very tragic. And perhaps my favorite part of the movie is the soundtrack, just a beautiful music score.

There is no gag reel/outtakes, no deleted scenes, no directors commentary. They don't even go be-hide the scenes showing the make-up dept, putting on any of the actors make-up, and their make-up was so amazing in the movie! What gives? Even the main menu of the DVD looked like a copy-n-past photo. *sad face* :(

Now with all the cons aside, the movie itself is a masterpiece. Anyone who believes in past-lives & karma, this is a must watch.

5265409,3,B0095HHM78,"The Wachowskis kicked butt in delivering this story to the screen from David Mitchell's source material. It is intense, ambitious, and visceral. The Wachoskis show: they have a practiced skill, they don't shy away from hard work or the pursuit of perfection and they have a deep respect and love for both film and literature. I will certainly be anxious to see their next work.

That said, I wanted to rate this story higher, but couldn't. Here's why.

1. I expected a tighter mesh of storylines rather than just a theme of eternal recurrence and a fluid timeline centered about a hint at nuclear Armageddon.
2. I'd hoped for a more intriguing plot, given all the wonderfully moving parts, but neither came.
3. The numerous story threads (all sometimes too familiar), no matter how exquisitely produced, were too numerous to allow the emotional investment that makes a good story great and memorable. Maybe this movie would have made a great miniseries, for more investment could have went into the plot of each thread, making it more unique, and the characters more dimensional, and thus the overall affect more appealing.

Here's what you get.
A technical marvel of amazing scenes that are a bit love story, action, mystery, musical, historical, dystopian and techno-thriller.

Unfortunately, none of these bits knows which bit is in charge.

Summary.
I will, and do, still root for the Wachowskis for they're brave and bold. I believe what they learned in making this movie, will ready them for great work ahead, and I will be anxiously watching.

The first time I saw it, I was ill-prepared for the magnitude of the film, having never read any of  David Mitchell's books. But I found myself thinking about the movie long after I had finished watching it. I was trying to figure it out and put all the many pieces together. This required a second viewing, where I found I was more able to enjoy the cinematic elements and not have to work so hard on the story-line. I even found myself writing down all the stories and putting them in the correct order. Then I tried figuring out who was who in all the different time lines.

This movie has been an acquired taste for me, but some of the best one's are. It combines philosophy, reincarnation, love, and sacrifice... it captures different aspects of the human spirit and puts them against each other in a jarring way but links them all with tiny little threads of memory. It is a very unique and creative movie that is not your average pop-corn drama. It will stay in your thoughts long after the popcorn is gone and throw you for a curve just when you think you've got it all figured out.

The good thing about the movie, in my opinion are the casting obviously and therefore the acting.  I also enjoyed the music, it was very pleasant.  The visual effects and the scenes were also very beautiful.  I a,Los enjoyed the message of the film.

I didn't like the editing.  Too much jumping back and forth between different times.  I have seen other films which tell a story in different times and they were a lot less messy.  I also found aspects of the story too unrealistic and therefore corny.

The photography is excellent, the editing superb, although it has taken a few viewings to reach that conclusion.  The story has enough depth that it has taken some concentration to grasp the depth presented.
The story follows a group of people through multiple lives in different ages into the far future from the 1840's to the 2144 era.  My initial confusion was that all the stories at first seem to run at the same time and it took some attention to realize the aim of the editing and the picture as a whole was exactly to show the connections to each era and characters through the ages.  I now feel the film was an excellent presentation, even though I have not read the book, and find it hard to believe that Warner Bros. shelled out the budget for a film that was probably more experimental than many people realize.  I am glad they did.  The actors took to the multiple characters you see in a way that makes you forget that they are the same through the many eras and makeup processes.

The Korean woman I never really bought into, although the revelation of what that society was doing was pretty gruesome.  Also interesting is the final fate of the characters.  Some live, some die, but we never really know which until the end of that sub story.  The nuthouse section had some pretty good comedy to it, but was not very believable.

How could anyone hope to capture the spirit of the book? But they did it, and brilliantly, too.

I think complaints about racism in this film are unfounded; yes, some white actors do play asian characters, but the asian actors also play white and latino characters, the black actors play asian, white, and pacific native characters; if it had ONLY been a case of white actors cast as other races I'd call it a case of whitewashing, but given the diverse cast and how people of all colors played people of other colors... I think it's a bit of a different case.

Problems: In the novel, in the Hawaiian section it's Meronym (halle berry's character) in that section who bears the Comet, not Zachary, and I think changing this for the film was in error as it sort of throws off the gender balance of the Comet bearers. I also felt disappointed by the lack of features on this DVD -- I really wanted to see some behind-the-scenes looks at how the makeup was done and what the actors did to get into their roles, but there really wasn't much in that regard.

I told myself it has an excellent reading, so it must be an exceptional movie. Maybe everything will come together at the end (like most other complex movies). I was very even more confused, unsatistied at the end of the movie and wondering if the 3 hrs was a total waste of time..

Some users' comments were helpful, but none exactly answers my questions. I think I understand that the movie is about how one's actions impact one another throughout the past, the present and the future. But I was trying to understand each story's plot better, and how the characters in one plot related to the characters in another plot (reincarnation, if any). What does the birthmark on the characters mean? In each plot, there's a person with the comet-like birthmark are they reincarnations of one another??

5265480,5,B0095HHM78,"Yes, there ARE movies that are better than the book, and this is one of them. The book felt like little more than a series of very well written stories connected by the literary gimmick of telling the first half of each story before going back and finishing them. The movie, by telling the stories simultaneously, having the same actors perform in each story, and drawing parallels between the stories through clever editing, really emphasizes the connections and the theme of life being cyclical and the possibilities of reincarnation.

There are quite a lot of changes to the stories themselves, and most of them are improvements, while some are merely to tighten the narrative so it doesn't run over 3 hours. Several outlandish sequences from the ""Luisa Rey"" story are thankfully dropped and the ""Sumni"" future story is simplified greatly and has some riveting action sequences added.

The complaints that the movie is hard to follow shock me. Just like with ""Inception"", it all seemed pretty straightforward to me. If you have ADD or refuse to devote your full attention, you WILL be confused, but otherwise just go with the flow. Use you brain - that's what it's there for.

This movie seemed mostly pointless.  It was also unnecessarily gory a few times, and I never appreciate that.

The interwoven storie lines and superb acting make this 3hr movie a very deep and insightful film with alot of different emotions playing in. Im still trying to wrap my head around its, amazing symbolism and deep philosophy in a story that can certanially grab your attention.  I have no idea why this film was not as wide spread in its acclaim. Almost everyone whose of the A list was in this film. I cant say enough about this movie. You have to watch this movie. It will take you places and make you think about things you never imagined. Its not for the restless, ADD type people though. Many of the story lines and scenes in the movie are very elaborate and drawn out and as the film progresses, its switches back and forth between motif's. It could be hard to follow or boring for people who don't like existentialism or extended dialoug. I loved it though. Our family watched this over the holidays and everyone was dearly facinated by this intreguing story. There is fighting and violence but its not the holywood shootem up style. Its way deeper than that, in a survival kind of theme. GO WATCH THIS FILM, ITS SO GREAT.",1389225600,,1203,4.493150684931507

5265521,4,B0095HHM78,"Science Fiction, history, futurism, nightmare, a CG EPIC that is on occasion painfully beautiful--all that, rolled up together. Part of the interest, of course, is trying to recognize the actors as they reincarnate, which they do as the story carries them through different roles, changing sexes, and into different historical periods, some past and some in a pair of frightening apocalyptic futures. I haven't read the book, and so was often confused, but was always intrigued, despite the length. Reactions to this episodic movie, where time periods and characters are constantly shifting, may vary; my husband said ""horse manure"", and couldn't believe that so much big budget money and time had been invested in the project, but I'm glad to have seen it at last. As noted above, the groundwork of Buddhism is here, most poignantly illuminated in Doona Bae's nuanced performance as the transcendent character, Sonmi-451.",1389052800,2,922,5.27891156462585
5265522,5,B0095HHM78,"I watched the first hour of this movie, then went to bed. All night it drifted in my dreams, getting mentally sorted out. Then I watched the rest in the morning and I have to say I think the break really helped me take it all in. For those of you who are having trouble figuring it out, treat it as a miniseries. Break it up into two or three segments, so you'll remember more from previous scenes by the end.

What I got from it was that, interwoven with various themes from various ages, like ""Women's Lib"", snake oil 'doctors', and how we treat old people, each character was there to stand up against some kind of moral crime.  Anti-slavery, gay rights, intellectual property rights, the right to be treated with basic decency, speaking up to ask for help, communicate an issue, save a life, or convince someone to change things for the better.  Even the characters who die accomplish something from their deaths, by influencing other people who then make choices later that save lives and change things.

I also like all the tiny details that went into making this story. Did you catch the reference to ""Soylent Green"" a supposedly throwaway line by the old publisher guy? It's a reference to an old sci-fi movie about a futuristic Earth where people are fed soylent green, made from humans. Just like Sonmi's people are fed ""Soap"", made from dead server clones.

In Cloud Atlas there's a sort of ""feeling out"" of what's going on in a lot of scenes, especially the Tom Hanks segment where he's speaking a sort of pidgin English. I found using the subtitles helped tremendously. Note that Hanks' form of English isn't the original Pidgin, as per his use of ""cog"" meaning ""to think/know/believe"", obviously based off the scientific word ""cognitive"".

That's a subtle clue that a character who appears so primitive is actually in our future, in case you missed the print that told you where and when the scene is taking place. And a deliberate oxymoron, meant to jolt us into realizing that this guy is using speech patterns based off of a much more technologically advanced society, a guy who probably has no idea that 'cog' used to be 'cognitive'. The world of expansive knowledge and emotional disconnection has narrowed down to one tiny village, full of magic, Karma, superstition, religion and fierce emotional bonds to other humans.

Visually breathtaking, with elaborate attention to detail from the utterly perfect makeup and costumes that gave each actor 6 roles that you won't even recognize them in, and sharp clear sweeping mountaintop views of Zachry's island, the cluttered Irish pub, the contrast between the bright Seoul laserlit city and the cramped, dirty underbelly, the forbidding castlelike English stone manor, the old-timey sailing ship with tiny bug-ridden cabins and the sweeping heights of ropes and sails, the decades of minutia in the old composer's studio...

I don't really think there's a spoiler but I didn't want to get popped if I accidentally understood any part of this movie and there-by said something spoiling about it.

If you were looking at reviews of this movie and you set the 'search' to hated it on IMDB you'd get a good dose of what I felt like most the time with the movie.  I am, however, giving it 3 stars assuming that rating is it's ok vs. 2, I didn't like it.  Because, despite my complaints, which are multitude, I didn't feel like it was a total waste of my time.

I obtained this movie to watch based on Tom Hanks and nothing else. That won't be happening again. I didn't watch it for ages though.  Seeing it sitting around yesterday (12-16-13) I looked at the IMDB blurb and thought, This might be interesting.  I didn't read any reviews.

I had the idea this was a time travel movie.  See Tom Hanks old, see Tom Hanks much younger in scenes close together... I don't think that assumption was a leap.  But that really isn't what's going on in this movie.  While trying to think what it is like, I remember that as a child my mother would buy me connect the dot books.  Connect the dots correctly....  Elephant!  Hooray!

This movie has dots galore. I wasn't connecting the dots, or if I was connecting the dots it was turning out to be a dream-catcher, not a movie. I did get that it was a series or parallel of stories and I was able to care about several of the stories as they hopped and skipped about, but it wasn't going to mold itself into the science fiction time travel movie I had been suspected in the beginning.

Maybe if I watched it a few times or if it had closed captions I would have liked it more.  I'm still pretty sure it was like movies that start in the middle, go to the end, and end with the beginning. But this movie was juggling several stories at once while doing that jumble the plot thing.  I think.  Probably why some people raved about the movie as genius.  I'll be calling BS on that one.

There was one part where I had a moment that I really enjoyed.  Others probably not.  It was where one of Hank's native characters was talking gibberish to an anthropologist (I think).  I think that because the advanced person slipped in and out of talking normal and talking gibberish when addressing Hank's character.  What sort of surprised me is I cogged the gibberish.  True, true.

I won't go so far as to say, Don't waste your time.  I've read some reviews now and some folks really like it.  I'm guessing if you like to put jigsaw puzzles together while knitting, this movie would add pleasantly to your entertainment time.  Or not.  Your mileage may vary.

5265595,4,B0095HHM78,"This major new film has an underlying theme that we're all bound together and true love never dies,taking place through 6 stories over a period of time from the 19th to the 24th centuries. Ideas of reincarnation, metempsychosis, repetition avoid the value systems of the monotheistic religions,giving it a sweep and freedom of manouevre. It uses the same group of actors (Hanks, Berry, Wishaw,Grant,Broadbent, Sturgess, Weaving, D'Arcy, Bae, Sarandon) to act the different characters in different times,different genres,different races,which can seem strange at times. You visited every story line in turn and went back to them in reverse order. Every story line is chopped up into a mosaic of storylines,so you zip between these different timelines and characters,which is confusing the 1st time you watch it,but it did work. Larger themes of liberation,tyranny,enslavement,crossing boundaries or conventions,self sacrifice,the communication of forbidden truths are woven into the shifting tapestry. Each of the 6 episodes is succeeded by a story which contains something of the preceeding story,whether it be a journal,music,letters or motif. Based on the Mitchell source novel,Cloud Atlas, and structured like a Russian doll or onion. The Wachowskis and Tyker use the syntax of crosscutting, montage, flashback and flashforward to interweave the multiple storylines in various genres. Narrative strands are cut up and reordered so they appear to be unfolding simultaneously across gulfs of space and time. This allows the precise structure of the novel to work on the big screen. The editing is immensely sophisticated.

By turns historical drama,dystopian SF,post-apocalyptic fable, nuclear thriller and knock-about-farce,it's like a multi-ethnic meal with many dishes from all round the world. One can admire the ambition,the risks taken,maybe only some parts succeed. It's one of the biggest independent films ever made(costing $100 million).I loved the moments of knockabout farce in the nightmarish modern-day publishing farce of Tim Cavendish(Broadbent),with Hugo Weaving as Nurse Noakes as light relief from him playing Old Georgie the demonic tempter to Old Zachry(Hanks) in the post-apocalyptic 24th century. There is a very New Age-y feel to the themes in the movie. Carlos Casteneda is mentioned in the 70s story,where Luisa Rey (Berry)wonders""why we keep making the same mistakes over and over"";or Frobisher's(Wishaw) `Cloud Atlas Sextet',where he says whole movements were written  ""imagining us meeting again and again in different times.""Hanks nerdy scientist tells Berry ""that when I opened a door a powerful dj vu ran through my bones.""Most care seemed to be given to the Tyker-directed 1930s narrative, with Ben Whishaw and Jim Broadbent at the top of their respective games as feckless young Cambridge drop-out Robert Frobisher anddyspeptic husk Vyvyan Ayrs, united by their talent for music, which in Frobisher's case is at a fertile peak leading to the composition of the Cloud Atlas Sextet that gives its name to the film. Also the Neo-Seoul , near-future dystopian political SF succeeds because of the excellent sets of a Blade Runner-like quality and the acting skills of Doona Bae and James Frobisher, which is moving. Tom Hanks has quitted himself well as theeveryman actor of modern cinema andI have never seen Halle Berry so good since Monster Ball.

This film should be watched for sheer entertainment value,some parts are better than others with the odd, idiosycratic false nose,teeth or wig standing out,but still for gutsiness,bravura,leaps taken,it's a remarkable spectacle for sweeping ambition and narrative boldness. Be warned to use subtitles for the 24th century patois episode.",1387238400,3,3719,5.567137809187279

5265613,4,B0095HHM78,"Cloud Atlas brings us tales of anger, betrayal, love, death and the moments that somehow become intertwined that none of us could ever have forseen coming.  With a vast cast playing various parts though out the entire film and somehowed linked to each and every one of them.  Based of the same novel we are given to a series of events that take place in various points in time on Earth.
  A young man is on a voage home in the year 1738 to conclude busniess for his father in law and to be his loving wife once more.  MEanwhile a stow away is trying to get the young man to help save him from slavery in the new lands. And a doctor that has dark designs on what the young man is traveling with.
  We are also introduced to a young man from England in the year 1933 leaving his gay lover to work with an elderly conductor in the hopes of one day becoming famous himself and the search for his own talent.  However will his lifestyle be his undoing as he works under the iron fist of a man who may already be washed up himself?
  A female jounrnalist discovers from 1972 a man she was trapped in the elvator with has been found dead and discovers that he may have information leading to a disater that could hurt hundreds of people.  In doing so she comes into the corsshairs of powerful people who want her dead and anyone else she's told of her discoveries.
  The year is 2012 and a washed up publisher has just witnessed his author kill a noted reviwer for the simple fact he didn't like the book.  With his author in jail and he reaping the rewards of a book that has become a best seller and the author's family demands a cut of the money he has earned.  With nowhere else to go he seeks help from his only family his brother and discovers that his brother has set him up to enact his own revenge against him for past deeds.
  In the year 3061 a fabricated human named Sungmi 451 is about to be excuted for her crimes against the goverment.  For her kind are never allowed to understand or even know of the outside world and that which normal humans live in day in and day out.  However after being freed by a strange man she learns that the world she wanted to know is far darker and far more dangeorus then she could ever imagine.
  Even farther still where recorded time no longer exists a man is struggling with his past demons as he tries to put behind what he failed to do.  And trying to help a woman from a colony of people who still the remantes of Earth's technology in a last bid chance to see if any of the colonies still exist and help them off the planet.  And in doing so the man begins to see that past mistakes can be changed by future ones.
  These tales while simple in thier description are truly complex by watching them.  From start to end we witness all these events and see how they  shape one another.  This is a very moving movie and one that has to be watched to understand the sheer scope of it all.  With no one actor standing out and each taking on secondary roles as the stories permit and truly something great to watch.",1386806400,3,3055,4.192109777015437

The movie was a bit long, but it basically needed to be for all it undertook.  I can't imagine how long the editing process must have been.

As for the cinimematography....All I can say is WOW!  One of the most visually beautiful film I've eveeer seen...and I've only seen it on my own TV.  I bet the big screen at the theatre was really stunning.

Cloud Atlas is six stories across an enormous period of time that are all interwoven.  Because the same actors appear in each segment it is easy to get caught up in trying to figure out which actors are playing which characters as the film moves from story to story (who knew that Hugh Grant could play a brute savage in war paint?) If you engage in tracking the actors then you will miss subtle points in the stories that are important.

I am now reading the novel and this is one of those cases where I really do wish I'd read the novel first before seeing the film as I think I would have better understood - or at least caught on a bit quicker - as to what was going on.

Entertaining, thoughtful and visually stunning.  I think this is a beautiful film and story that's going to get some negative votes simply because one has to THINK just a little bit.  This is not idle entertainment.  This film is waaaaaay better than the 3.5 star score shown here on Amazon - IF you don't mind a little thinking.

From my perspective, it deals with karma, reincarnation, the importance of the individual, the power an individual has to make change and, with perseverance, create the extraordinary.

5265698,5,B0095HHM78,"This is the most under rated and misunderstood movie of all time. It is complex, full of messages and themes that demand the viewers full attention for 3 hours. It is an emotional ride that builds to the end where all six stories come together. I've watched this movie more than 40 times now, and Cloud Atlas is my all time favorite. It is the only movie that I can watch more than once a year, and even though I've nearly memorized the dialog, it continues to tear me to shreds emotionally.

If you are a hard core Christian, you may find it less interesting as it definitely has a Buddhist take on the universe, although Buddhism is never mentioned. The extra's on the blue ray make it worth it.

Be forewarned, it has elements of slavery, a violent whipping, murder and attempted poisoning, gay love, cloning, prison, mass industrialized slaughter, cannibalism, suicide, and death, and yet is about none of those things. It is the journey of a single soul as it moves through six individual lives spanning 500 years. Life, Death, Rebirth.

""Our lives are not our own. From womb to tomb we are bound to others, past and present. And by each crime, and every kindness we birth our future.""  Sonmi 451

5265715,5,B0095HHM78,"Being a fan of the Wachowski siblings, I watched Cloud Atlas in the theater, knowing very little about it before.  I liked the movie, but DID find it a little hard to follow all the stories and the constant jumping between the stories and timelines.  But at the end I liked it even though I was not sure I fully understood it.  Watching it again on HBO-Go I was able to pick up the details that I was missing the first time around and the story made much more sense.

The movie has plenty of action throughout to keep it from becoming boring UNLESS you give up because you feel lost in the jumping sequences.  But if you pay attention, it will make mostly sense the first time around and complete sense the second.

Many good films with detailed scripts are not fully understood after a first viewing.  In fact I think REALLY good films often require additional viewings to catch all the details of the story (examples, The Matrix, Heat, LA Confidential, Inception, etc.).  When stories are more complex they are simply harder to follow and slight distractions while viewing can get you lost.  Yet these are my favorite films of all cause they are truly focused on telling the story, as opposed to many movies gutting story lines for the sake of CGI sequences.

I have now seen the movie about 6 times and now I am purchasing it.  Good story(s), overall good acting, excellent SFX when done.

Finally I would say that with exception of the stories being tied by the reincarnation aspect, they truly could be COMPLETELY separate stories....keeping that in mind might help you follow the stories in the movie.  I find some people get lost because they are busy trying to tie all the stories together TOO much.  Enjoy the stories individually as they come and go, jumping around, then you'll see how they are loosely tied together.

5265724,5,B0095HHM78,"I do understand why CLOUD ATLAS was not a blockbuster.  At over 170 minutes, it's a long movie to sit through.  And the movie is a tapestry of six story threads, all taking place in different locales, and in different historical eras.  The thread ""Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin' After"", taking place in a post-apocalyptic world in the year 2321, is particularly difficult to follow, as the story suggests English as we know it has been altered to an almost unrecognizable dialect.  Next in difficulty is the story ""An Orison of Somni~451"", taking place in a futuristic Seoul where a food-serving clone becomes the focal point of a revolution.  Based on the above, I understand why CLOUD ATLAS never found a huge audience.  I had to view this film three times to get an adequate feel for it, and now I am a total fan; once the extended DVD with its special features is released (and I'm hoping this will be the case), I will be adding CLOUD ATLAS to my DVD collection.

Extolling the theme that over time our lives are a mosaic that intertwine and affect other lives, CLOUD ATLAS is a moving, haunting film focused on the obscure musical composition 'Cloud Atlas Sextet'.  Including the two stories referenced above, other threads include a shipping voyage in the South Pacific in 1849; a dysfunctional musical collaboration in 1936; exposing corrupt big oil in 1973; and a delightful romp in (and from) a senior center in the UK in 2012.  Most of the cast appear in all, or some, of the separate threads, as different characters (obviously).  And what a cast:  Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent (the lead in ""The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish"", by far my favorite story), Hugo Weaving, Doona Bae, Susan Sarandon, and Hugh Grant, to name but a few.  You're guaranteed to get a kick out of Tom Hanks playing thuggish indie author Dermot Hoggins in the ""Cavendish"" thread, where he gets the ultimate revenge over a most disagreeable literary critic.  And throughout the six threads, the haunting musical score by Reinhold Heil, Johnny Klimek, and Tom Tyker only enhances the surreal film-viewing experience.  All six stories overlap to some extent--share a metaphysical commonality--making CLOUD ATLAS come together full circle.  No, this film is not for everyone; I'm just delighted it so appeals to me.

An ok future movie (fighting + copy of soilent green) with 5 more bad movies attached to it. Totally understood what they were trying to do after the first 30 minutes, but . . . Matrix it was not.

Typical Communist propaganda film by people who refuse to believe in GOD, but . . . evangelize the pagan ""hand me down soul"", you call it Karma, so by some miracle of Darwin, you get reincarnated in male and female bodies to carry out your love life that was rudely interrupted by you either killing yourself or getting murdered.

Then the obligatory deprecating treatment of slaves, with the honorable slave and all those bad white people. It would have been just as historically accurate to have white people play a slave or 2. The only whipping was black on black crime, how did that get in there?

And of course the newest movie ""requirement for funding"" the enlightened, creative, but slightly flawed, homosexual.

Pornographic scenes and lots of blood, lend nothing to the story. Then there was the supposed comic relief of violently throwing a guy off a building. White guy of course.

Corporations bad. Working bad. Consumerism bad. The perfect humans, Darwin's master race, is where everyone is of mixed race origin. In the future the only white people will be primitives speaking pigeon English. Except for the privileged few, like Tom Hanks who get carried away to a distant planet.

No politically correct topics left to cover. All that was missing was the hammer and sickle flag at the beginning. If you have some communist friends, send them this movie, it might make them see how ridiculous their religion is.

By watching the movie with a more discerning eye, I found an incredible story made even batter by the acting of Tom Hanks and Halle Berry. They are, individually, two of my favorite actors. Put them together in a movie of this depth, and magic happens.

I could sit here and try to explain the movie, but would end up rambling on forever because there is so much going on in the nuance and subtleties of the film, it cannot be easily described.

What I can say is, if you want a thought provoking experience rarely seen on the big screen, watch it again (if you've already seen it), with a more discerning eye. If you haven't seen it, pop some popcorn, pour yourself something to drink, turn off anything creating ambient noise, and clear your mind for an absolutely mind-bending story.",1382745600,6,1194,4.565420560747664

I strongly urge anyone who is considering purchasing and viewing Cloud Atlas to do themselves a favor: Go wash and clean the toilet.

5265771,5,B0095HHM78,"""Cloud Atlas"" is for me a meditation on the cyclic nature of relationships. The story spans centuries, depicting conflict and love between people played by the same actors, so that it seems as if the feelings are memes attached to certain faces which recur over the years. Or is it reincarnation of certain souls and their relationships which have to work themselves out over many lifetimes? Using the same actors as anchors helped make clearer the dynamics of the individual stories in a way that the book could not, which I liked. The second half of the movie brought the story to a cosmic conclusion that was not in the book (and at the end of the movie, unlike the middle in the book); I liked this while I was seeing it, but it is Hollywood-tidy, unlike the more complicated book.

I was so taken aback from the movie's divergence from that marvelous writing that still echoed in my soul. I didn't like the movie. So I put it aside and watched another month of sci-fi schlock...

The second time I watch the Wachoski (sp?) Siblings version of Cloud Atlas, I was moved. I laughed, I cried. It's a marvelous, nuanced movie, and a lot of care was taken to be faithful to the book...in the language of cinema. Which is different. And this time I got it and loved it.

Some people may get annoyed how the movie, often at a critical juncture, will jump to another character... but if you pay attention you are easily able to follow along.

To turn this marvellous, 500+ page novel into an almost 3 hour movie was indeed an ambitious project. There are some big names (Tom Hanks, Susan Sarandon, Hugo Weaving, Hugh Grant, Halle Berry) who take on up to six roles, requiring, obviously, lots of makeup. The format is necessarily different from the book, so that each of the six stories runs through the movie from start to finish. As with the book the different genres are represented. While there are some significant departures from the book, the spirit and feel of the book are adhered to. Jim Broadbent, Halle Berry and Doona Bae are quite outstanding in all their roles. While the makers of the film take quite a bit of cinematic licence with the plots and feel compelled to include romance and lots of whiz-bang action, some of the changes allow the film to make sense without the viewer having read the book.

It was hard to follow, hard to keep track of what is going on in each story, shockingly violent, toooooo long, and in the end--what was the point? I guess it is based on the idea of reincarnation and that we get another chance to learn and get it right, but keep making the same mistake over and over.

5265824,4,B0095HHM78,"There will be many distractions during Cloud Atlas which will ask you to stop watching the film and to give  attention to the things that need to be done. However I kept on watching the film, Cloud Atlas is a very long movie and I am not saying that it is a very riveting affair all the time but it is a very absorbing and and a beautiful affair to watch. What is amazing that a spare cast takes on multiple roles over many centuries and play these roles which such an amazing ease. Tom Hanks has almost 6 six roles unless I missed some during the film. Same goes for Hugo Weaving he plays six roles as well.
The movie spans from a slave ship in the early 1800's to a futuristic Seoul set in 2144 and about various individuals throughout time who are interconnected by a birthmark.
Cloud Atlas is based on David Mitchell's 2004 novel run at 2 hours and 52 minutes long and by no means an easy film to watch there is a lot of things that need to be digested and understood it you want to grasp the films lavish scale. However what struck out the most is the beauty of the film and its lush locations.
There are six stories beginning with the ""The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing,"" which takes place on a ship and a  friendship that develops between a lawyer (Jim Sturgess) and a  slave (David Gyasi). The second story is , ""Letters from Zedelghem,"" about a partnership between  a musician (Ben Whishaw) and a reclusive composer (Jim Broadbent) for whom he works as an amanuensis. ""Half-Lives: The First Luisa Rey Mystery"" is set in the 1970s about Luisa Rey (Halle Berry) a journalist who unravels a plot by an oil  executive (Hugh Grant) to allow a nuclear reactor to melt. The fourth tale is, ""The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish"" is about a British publisher (Jim Broadbent) who is banished by his brother to  a bizarre nursing home. . ""An Orison of Sonmi~451"" about genetically engineered  (Doona Bae) who  is used by revolutionaries to be the figurehead for their rebellion. The sixth and final story, ""Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin' After"" takes place in a time beyond the 22nd century when  tribesman (Tom Hanks) befriends a woman (Halle Berry) who belongs to a technologically advanced culture.
All these story are not presented in a cohesive manner yet there is a link that connects all of them. I had to think at many times about the link but it is not hard to discern it.
I said this before and I will plead viewers to see it on a Blu Ray because the scenes are breathtaking and deserve to be seen on this format.
This was a good movie with many talented actors playing many roles throughout the ages. Tom Hanks by the way is the most famous of them.
Cloud Atlas has been panned because of the length and story telling but while it may not be a bonafide classic, it is still a good film.  four stars 8/12/2013",1380412800,,2824,4.4238921001926785

A bunch of stories involving the same souls over and over again in some karmic mobius loop that seems disjointed and so full of loose ends that you could dedicate your entire life making Calder-like mobiles out of them just to entertain yourself. What rubbish! That is, until you realize the movie and its narratives are moving too fast across your perceptual apparati to take them all in one lone viewing.

I understood this having read some novels and seen some flicks that did this very thing, mostly in the surreal vein, that if you don't slow it down, or store some of it on your cognitive workbench first, enough for a second or third viewing, that its little gems of insight and wonder will be lost forever in your befuddlement, confusion and chaos. No wonder so many people hated this flick. It's not for everyone. But it is for those who know that patience sometimes pays off in spades, and taking your time to view this a second or third time, where you can stitch the time elements together and know that they DO make a whole, and then eventually savoring the way the stories intertwine in a clear,skillful and seamless fashion, past, present, future, present, future, past, future, present, past, etc.,no bumps, just smooth transition after transition, is just a marvellous way to do cinema and to present reality, or multiple realities, in one venue. I mean, I haven't even begun to talk about the multitude of metaphysical and spiritual themes like love and freedom, freedom and love together as the elixer for our own self-imposed enslavement and suffering, the ingredients changing our direction because the things and the soul forces we set up before us, or even in the future, time being no barrier here, are interminably linked to us and move us because we choose (karma) to be such a part of it. And the terrible cruelties that our technologies can create, much more fearsome in the future than in the past, precisely because of the maturity of our souls have not caught up with the technologies that use them, or use us as the case maybe. On and on.

Yea, one can go on and on about this. Just a damn good sci-fi movie that is not afraid to leap into the internal landscapes of what makes us human, like the best sci-fi of a Herbert or a LeGuin or a Zelanzy does.",1379894400,,2577,4.575757575757576

5265899,4,B0095HHM78,"For most, this movie will come across as a complex tale which seems to be in disarray. For others, it is a beautiful journey artfully shot with a riveting message of personal reflection. Say what?
What not everyone will realize is that this movie is actually capturing the past life regression of many souls. To appreciate that, understand that past life regression is about recognizing and overcoming the challenges our souls have consistently faced throughout our lives (yes plural if you believe your spirit has been here before). This movie, if the viewer is keen to recognize such a thread, details the challenges faced by each incarnation of the souls focused on throughout this movie - greed, cowardice, courage, bravery, slavery, death, love, loss and so on. In some lives, you win some, and in others, you lose some.
The movie isn't shot in disarray as much as it is showing you the similarity of a situation, or challenge a character faces throughout the ages. Ie: a character may make many mistakes and commit crimes against humanity/nature in one life (or two or three), while in another, they may actually do something valiant and different from what they had done before. Watch as Tom Hanks greedily goes after a little gem, like Gollum with his precious.
So whether you take this movie as a great story packed with an insightful message (thank you Wachowski's for picking such a poignant story to capture on film), or the artful tale of a book turned to film, or just a confusing bunch of clips sewn together with a great cast, you will be in for a wild ride of make-up mastery and some cool special effects.",1379462400,3,1623,4.738515901060071

I was wrong. The special effects are good, the actors do a good job, but what is missing is a constancy, a thread that binds the story together. The jumping around is distracting and even after an hour, you cannot really get into it. When a story is told, especially by the medium of film, we must be gripped by a character or an element that holds our interest and makes us want to pursue the telling from beginning to end. Alas, there are no gripping characters--only incomplete ones, in whom we don't have time to become interested because we've jumped somewhere else. Perhaps the filmmakers missed a great opportunity by not hiring Steve Kloves (he wrote most if not all of the Harry Potter films), who, through skillful manipulation of just a few critical elements made J K Rowling's stories work visually.

A movie is not a book and has entirely different structural requirements. While it's a bit easier to leaf back and forth between chapters to understand what's in a book, how many viewers would have the patience to keep re-running film segments in order to figure them out? Two hours into it, I still had trouble understanding where this film was going. I have not read the book, though I am now curious to do so. And by the way, I don't think a viewer is obliged to read the book in order to understand this particular film, or any other. As a fan of science fiction I badly wanted to love this movie, but unfortunately, despite the grand visuals and some nice acting, it fails where it counts most: holding the viewer's interest. I was hoping to learn this film was a future classic, but instead found a movie bomb for the ages.

5265949,4,B0095HHM78,"Love it or hate it Cloud Atlas pulls off what no other movie (as far as I can find) has dared attempt. It is essentially six different stories spread out over a 500 year period intertwined throughout the running of the film. These stories and the cast within them are each connected in two ways. The first being the principal players are apparently reincarnations of the same person in each story. The second being the actions done in an earlier story influence the lives of another era. It's all a fascinating concept, and on paper it sounds like it would be an amazing achievement. Sadly it falls short of the grandiose concept. Still the movie is fascinating. Do I love it? No. Do I hate it? No. Do I regret seeing it? No. Why? Read on.

I think the best way to get to the nuts and bolts of this film is to break up each individual story. While each of them are very different from each other a few things are common. First is the separate story in of itself if complete and aside from trivial details does not need the support of the other stories to stand on its own. Second is even though these are all complete stories with one exception they feel in way incomplete. Much more needed to be said and done in order for the stories to truly leave you satisfied on its own. I understand the limitations of squeezing six stories into three hours of running time, but it still is what it is. Another thing I found in common is every story has at one point or another has some really graphic violence. It doesn't matter if the theme of the story is dramatic of comedic or otherwise. Every one of them has a signature stamp of shocking violence on it. Now on to the stories, which I'll just denote by the time period.

1849

Adam Ewing (Jim Sturgess) is traveling the Pacific on business and on the way back befriends a runaway slave (David Gyasi). All the while he contracts a rare disease and is being administered by a physician along the way (Tom Hanks). It is a story about the virtues of loyalty and the complications of trust. Essentially just three sets with the first part being at a slave trade port, second being in a sailing ship, and a coda to tie off the loose ends at a Victorian home. The best parts are during the scenes on a large sailing ship, which all the virtues of the story come together. I think at least the first half of this story suffers the most by being broken up into parts throughout the film. More than any of the others I found myself having to do reach back into my memory in order to continue where this story left off. But by the time we get to the trip back the interweaving falls into place much better.

1936

A musician named Frobisher (Ben Whishaw) writes to his lover about his experience trying to reignite the talents of noted composer Vyvyan Ayrs (Jim Broadbent), while creating his own musical opus, The Cloud Atlas. This story is set in various cities around Great Britain and is a drama in every form.

There is an aire of self serving confidence in Frobisher as he volunteers himself into the lives of the Ayrs (including bedrooms) all the while still writing away to his paramour. As many dramas before are it is ultimately a sad story of loss and emotional complication as best laid plans end up taking a turn for the worst. This story serves as a good change of pace from the more action oriented stories, and still keeps you held in interest over where the story turns.

1973

Set in San Francisco budding journalist Luisa Rey (Halle Berry) uncovers a sinister secret involving a newly opened nuclear reactor. This story has all the suspense of a good conspiracy theory styled action film. I have to admit this story feels a bit more complete than most others, but not enough to say it's a finished work with no need for expansion. Definitely has that 70's movie feel to it.

Two standout performances aside from Berry come from two sides of the good/evil coin. Keith David absolutely owns his role as security chief, or more akin to this story the cavalry. I would see a whole movie based off this character. On the other end is  hitman Mr. Smoke (Hugo Weaving), who is completely amoral and so evil to the bone you can't help but want to be in the fight against him.

2012

Set in the UK this story, even though it starts off rather harsh, end up being the comedic twist Cloud Atlas desperately needed to lighten an otherwise heavy storyline. Cavendish (Jim Broadbent) is a publisher with the unfortunately distinction of having a homicidal client kill a critic of his book. Cavendish ends up going into hiding after a run in with his client's cohorts over ""royalties"" and gets double crossed by his brother (Hugh Grant), who traps him in a crooked retirement home.

The comedy gets a bit irky up until he joins a group of retirees in hatching a plan to escape. Then the story gets delightfully crazy and lighthearted; in contrast to it's beginning. Nice blend of the cast with a notable detail. I say notable because it's both entertaining and weird at the same time. Hugo Weaving plays sadistic Nurse Noakes, which is at first off-putting to see Hugo as a rather large and unappealing woman. As the story goes on I see the appeal of having such a caricature of a character. Of all the Cloud Atlas stories this is the one feels the most complete, and if you took this segment and made it into a half hour long short film it would stand on its own successfully. It also has the most fulfilling ending of all.

2144

It's Neo-Seoul and genetically engineered clones have become the new slave class. One clone, Sonmi~451 (Doona Bae) tells her story to an archivist (Hugo Weaving) of how she got liberated from her captor by a rebel commander (Jim Sturgess). The rebels then shows her the truth of her place and fate in society, and attempt to broadcast a manifesto spoken by Sonmi-451.

This is the action segment of Cloud Atlas (and also where the sexual situations of the movie reside) so it is the most visceral of all the stories. It feels a lot like The Matrix in many ways without actually straight out plagiarizing the Wachowskis' previous work. As it sits alone the action is great and the story stands out as the fate of an entire class of people are in the balance. Still since it is mostly an action piece it loses a lot of depth and development on the second half of the piece. As a sci-fi fan I do admit this was the segment I adhered to the most.

2321

The date is not noted on the movie (just that it's 106 years after ""the fall"") until the end credits. Apparently the revolution from the 2144 took hold, but it appears society as a whole collapsed by an apocalypse of otherwise. All we see in this story segment are two groups. One highly advanced (although it seems the technology is at about the same level as 2144) called the Prescients and one primitive group living in the valley. The advanced group sends an emissary (Halle Berry) to the valley people to get a guide into uncharted mountains to a communications station to send a message to the colonies outside Earth. The guide, Zachry (Tom Hanks) has to juggle his superstitions and fears over the deadly Kona tribe with trust in his Prescient friend. All the while he is tormented by Old Georgie (Hugo Weaving), who is either a hallucination or malevolent spirit bent on breaking Zachry's will.

As a standalone this is a story of vindication over fear and prejudice. In the whole this is the bookend for Cloud Atlas that kind of finishes the fate of all the souls who have jumped from era to era. As such it serves to finish the movie with a ray of hope. Again, this being a sci-fi genre piece it interested me. There is a good interpretation of the different cultures and how they know each other and learn to work together even though this story has a pretty depressing level to it.

So how do all of these stories connect to each other other than the same actors playing different incarnations? The other connection I mentioned is really just a footnote that hardly seems to affect the fate that it supposedly influences. A letter or manuscript from a previous story is read on the next one, but the reading doesn't really seem to cause any paradigm shift in the story. You have one character that actually is in two different stories, but again this detail is not significant in of itself. Then on the final 2321 story it hints at how important Sonmi~451's manifesto from 2144 was, but again it doesn't serve any significance other than why she is significant as a person. To me this is where Cloud Atlas fails. It has six different stories that are connected somewhat, but those connections don't go anywhere other than as an interesting footnote for those paying attention.

On the other hand I do find it interesting to see these various ""lives"" evolve through time. I think this is where the movie can get fascinating for those of you who like to analyze, theorize and philosophize over it. So I look at Tom Hanks' characters and see a slow move from a selfish and evil man in early incarnations, to somebody who wants to do what's right, but is afraid, to the final character to overcomes these selfish ways. Alternately I see the same in Hugo Weaving's character. He starts off as a man eager to get into the slave trade and pretty much sticks to being bad all the way up to his incarnation that experiences Sonmi's testimony and manifesto (I don't count his portrayal as Old Georgie as that was not a physical incarnation). This follows the philosophy of reincarnation where as the soul progresses through the many lifetimes the soul gets older and wiser depending on what decisions are made in the next lifetime. Some souls take longer than others to reach a certain level of enlightenment. In that little analogy, whether it was intended or not by the makers of the movie, makes Cloud Atlas all the more worth looking into.

The mechanics of the film itself are top notch. Cinematography, costumes, sets, script, acting, music score, special effects, practical effects and a whole slew of other details are done with precision and a high level of quality. Each era you are in you really feel like you are in that era. The future eras may have been trickier with 2144 being a bit too far on the fantastical side, but 2321 did feel very real even for a made up time period. Makeup is essentially very good with certain times you will have a hard time figuring out if that is really your favorite actor under it. Then again there are some moments of weakness makeup wise. Some ""old face"" look more like make up than being natural. The Neo-Seoul segment had some awkward looking faces of non-Asian actors made to look Asian, although I can imagine that being attributed to a future of mixed nationalities and genetic variances to make it not seem so strange. Basically all of the production values hit home and on that front Cloud Atlas is a resounding success.

The Blu-Ray looks great and the movie is encoded on a BD50 disk so there is very little risk of image compression from the three hour movie. The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround sound is well balanced. Aggressive in the action scenes but clean and clear in the more dialog heavy parts. This Blu-Ray/Combo says it comes with Ultraviolet Digital Copy, but that's a little misleading. Any time you see Ultraviolet that usually means you don't actually have the digital copy on disk, but you have an authorization code to download one from the web. A small detail, but I think it's worth pointing out. As for the extra features I can't help but feel underwhelmed. While the back packaging makes it sound like you are getting a plethora of documentaries what you are really getting is little snippets. They are call focus point featurettes and all of them run under ten minutes (but in HD). Here's the breakdown:

A Film Like No Other - This is a fluff piece. It's something akin to a promotional short that must have been floating around before the film was released. It mostly hosts interviews with cast and crew geared towards sounding like the making of the movie was a grandest undertaking of them all.

Everything is Connected - Some behind the scenes footage along with clips from the film and interviews all geared toward pointing out the connections the stories have with each other.

The Impossible Adaptation - Essentially a discussion with the directors and and author David Mitchell talking about the novel and what was done to adapt it into a novel.

The Essence of Acting - Various actors talking about the different roles they played and what it took to make the essential changes with each character. I would have enjoyed more time and depth on this featurette as it really delves into the meat of what this movie is about to me.

Spaceships, Slaves & Sextets - Discussions on mixing the six stories together into a single cohesive piece. It feels like already charted territory by now, but some new insights do come up now and then.

The Bold Science Fiction of Cloud Atlas - Another fluff piece that focuses on the sci-fi stories and the development of these worlds. Not exactly anything you couldn't figure out yourself after watching the film.

Eternal Recurrence: Love, Life, and Longing - Much like the previous featurette, only this one focuses on the romantic elements of the film. Again it feels like parroting what most viewers already find out while watching the film.

There is a fair amount of overlap in the information and footage between these featurettes, which makes feel even more cheated that they couldn't get separate content for ten minute documentaries on a three hour movie that's supposed to have taken four years to make. And there are no audio commentaries from cast and crew. No deleted scenes (is any exist). Not even movie trailers or image stills. As far as extras are concerned the package is underwhelming.

Cloud Atlas is definitely a movie I would recommend seeing, but I'm not by any means expecting you to love, or even like it afterwards. Still it's one of those films that no matter how you feel about it by the end is worth experiencing. For sci-fi fans I would have to call it required viewing for the same reasons. Love it or hate it this movie is a ground breaker. Should you buy it? Not until you see it first. This isn't one of those films you should jump headlong into a purchase without knowing what you're getting into. No amount of reviews you read will really tell you if you should buy it or not. Lord knows it's not worth buying for the extras. Rent it. Netflix it. Whatever. But try before your buy.",1378684800,2,14568,4.550591828942345

I think if I watched it again, I would be able to follow the story even better. The futuristic story of  Sonmi~451 and Hae-Joo Chang is my favorite.  It's such a powerful love story of two people from different worlds who come together to fuel a revolution. They find love and, in the end, sacrifice themselves for the cause.

5265973,3,B0095HHM78,"Having read the book, I couldn't stop comparing the movie to it, unfavorably. The book is subtle and fluid and mysterious. The movie hits you over the head with its themes. The movie becomes an anthology of stories whose connections are not central to the stories, and the transitions in mood between segments are jarring. I also thought that the sci-fi futuristic chase scenes, which were 90% special effects, were unnecessary and actually against the spirit of the novel. The same goes for some of the gratuitous violence.
Having said all this, I'd rather watch ""Cloud Atlas"" 10 times over than some of the super-hero movies than, say ""Man of Steel"" or some of the other super-hero movies out there. ""Cloud Atlas"" (the movie) does have excellent performances by actors playing multiple roles, an unusual central concept, and a mind-stretching arc through time that you do remember afterward.",1378339200,19,893,5.04054054054054

It helps that there are actors I know and love like Tom Hanks, Halle Berry and Hugh Grant, who are all superb. It also helped that it underscored my own personal belief that time is of our own making and that, really, all time is really now, this moment. So, in this movie, several eras are splayed out across a present timeline. Make sense? No? Well, that's my point...in some part of me, it really does make sense...the part of me that is not confined by words and descriptions, but just, somehow, knows.

But next time, cast Asian actors for Asian parts.  There are times when CGI is totally inappropriate.  Turning Caucasian men into Koreans with FX is off-putting, frankly.  Now then, the D.W. Griffith classic ""Intolerance"" (1916) also intercuts between multiple stories - four to be exact.  That masterpiece focused on tales that shared a common theme, but it also established the men and women that inhabited the worlds of each section.  In contrast, ""Cloud Atlas"" fails to do either of those things.  The viewer is plunged awkwardly into the different eras with little set up or context.

Each small story could become its own movie but is instead incorporated into the whole through minute connections throughout the narrative. Each scene transitions using an actor or element from the previous scene, and as you watch, the connectedness of each story becomes more apparent. Essentially, this story tells six stories at once while maintaining the suspense of each without sacrificing from the meaning of the whole. This genius for combining themes, characters, motifs, and episodes matches the kind of skills need in classical composing, which is why i believe the ""Cloud Atlas Sextet"" becomes the inspiration for the title.

She's searching for the Cloud Atlas satellite station and the ability that it holds to broadcast the truth to Earth colonies.

The 2144 story is set in Neo Seoul. It's about a genetically-engineered clone, a young lady living a regimented life as a waitress at a futuristic fast food restaurant. She's rescued from this drudgery by a resistance fighter who shows this girl what the real world looks like. She's awed by the revelation and freedom from her former slavish existence, but is shocked to learn that her fellow replicants are killed and used as food for others like them.

The 2012 story concerns a British book publisher who, through the trickery of a vengeful older brother, mistakenly commits himself to a home where he's abused by a sadistic head nurse.

In 1973 a young investigative reporter played by Halle Berry is targeted for assassination after she learns about an unsafe nuclear reactor.

The 1936 story is about a young man who becomes the musical transcriber for a world famous composer. (He had to leave his boyfriend to take this job.)

Events in 1849 concern a San Fran lawyer who's traveling on a three master. He befriends a stowaway slave that he'd previously witnessed being severely whipped. An on-board doctor who wants to steal the attorney's possessions is slowly poisoning him.

IMDb's description only sheds a bit of light on this (rated 7.6) constant shuffle of plots and ages:

Well, the first two are wrong, but the last is correct. Like butterfly effect, this movie takes you out of the normal 'think' and into an alternative think. Once you understand what you are watching and the progression of each character, you will most certainly enjoy the movie.

5266055,4,B0095HHM78,"Second review:
My review after having watched the film for the first time is given below. My review after having watched it a second time is given now. This time around I was definitely able to follow the stories better, athough there's still a lot of stuff I'm not getting. Some things I noticed: the scientist dies in the same way as his lover was killed decades earlier; many of the characters are reading books written by characters from previous ages, but they are missing the second half of the book until later when they are able to find the second half and understand the completion of the story which then enables them to complete their own life stories. The message of the film seems to be that reincarnation exists, that there are always certain elements (souls?) that are evil-doers, that there is an eternal battle between good people and the evil doers, and that a person's life story is not complete when he or she dies, it continues when they are reincarnated in the next life.

Looking at my first review, now I disagree with my first impression about Joseph Campbell - this second time around I'm not seeing him anywhere. ... The Bridge Across Forever is still apparent, perhaps it was one of the inspirations for the film.

It's going to take a third viewing to get more out of it!

FIRST REVIEW:
interesting. First impressions: Bridge Across Forever, Joseph Campbell, a bit of ""Canticle for Liebowitz"", the rise and fall of civilizations, the dark sides of human nature. At times inspiring, at other times disturbing. Those are my impressions having watched the movie once. I am basically still in the dark as to how the stories and characters relate to eachother except on the most apparent level. I think to figure this out will require multiple viewings and paying close attention to the dialogue, or maybe reading the book. There are many things that remain unexplained or inexplicable. Also there are many events and actions that are disjointed - I assume these become clear upon further analysis rather than shortcomings or flaws in the writing itself? Overall, an interesting view, it makes you think about the fundamental problems of human nature, about whether there is such a thing as soulmates. Reminds one of books like The Name of The Rose or Dictionary of the Khazars. Definitely homage was paid to movies like Bladerunner (the post-apocalyptic urban street scenes, for example) and there are parallels with the movie ""The Island"" where the androids are misled to believe they are going to a higher place when in fact they are being recycled.",1377561600,,2576,4.81038374717833
5266056,3,B0095HHM78,"The trailer looked a lot more interesting.  The seperate stories in the movie don't relate as much as I expected (barely at all), and a few events seem to be left hanging with no explanation.  Why is the song special?  What happened in the record store?  Why do Korean people in the future look american?  Are those asian girls clones or something?  What resulted from that whole rebellion shootout thing?  How did the world devolve back into a forest?  Are those people on the ship aliens or what?  Who thought it was a good idea to put the villains from Road Warrior in this movie?",1377561600,,583,4.476190476190476
5266057,5,B0095HHM78,"Behind the reincarnations and the compelling personal stories, there is a deeper moral perspective well worth pondering.  For every deed there is a consequence.",1377475200,,160,5.666666666666667
5266058,5,B0095HHM78,"I love all the bad raving reviews on here. This movie is simple. It's primary thrust is philosophical and nonduality is the primary celebrated philosophy, with many other philosophical and psychological points touched on. It's from the same directors as The Matrix but is not action driven. People think an intellectual movie ends with you going ""Aha! The wife did it! Never saw that coming! And Bruce Willis was a ghost the whole time! Whoa!"". Now I'm not knocking The Sixth Sense, it's one of my favorites, but movies like that are not ""intellectual"", they're just surprising and witty. But witty is not intellectual. This movie is for people who want a beautiful philosophical demonstration.

The philosophical viewpoint celebrated in the film is nonduality, which is a central point found among virtually all Eastern religions. (Cloud Atlas is doing much better outside the US than in, btw) The point of the movie is that you are, objectively, ontologically, everyone and everything, and that boundaries are subjective conventions. This is extremely hard for Americans to understand but I'd advise googling it. If you're turned off by me using words like this, you won't like this movie and are not an intellectual person. Even if you don't know what these words mean, but you're intrigued, you're quite possibly intellectually inclined and will probably like this movie.

Fans of The Fountain, The Matrix, American Beauty, ehhh.. I dunno.. Movies that you have to think about at least a little.. will like this.",1377388800,3,1516,5.0843373493975905

5266070,5,B0095HHM78,"It's  like some books that you are reading for understanding and you start asking questions that get answered as you continue to read.  Instead of focusing in on one timeline or narrow viewpoint, the movie causes one to put out multiple viewpoints simultaneously, irrespective of where they are on the timeline.  This is actually closer, imho, to how what some call ""all-that-is"" sees things as ""happenings"".  The movie tries to move one's viewpoint outside the universe of time, space, matter, energy, and see happenings as you would see them from that viewpoint.  Can you have it?  That's up to the viewer, and I respect that.

""Life"", or the games of life do not relate strung out in linear time:  They relate according to the nature of the game, its purposes, and I think that is a more natural order of viewing one's own existences.  Remember, god spoke (i.e., postulated) before anything came into existence.  It's as if he said, ""Hmmmm, I wonder how this would play out..."" and VOILA! a whole matrix of existences formed on the basis of that ""first postulate"".  All for his viewing pleasure.  :-))

So life is a web when one steps outside the universe and sees it from a god-self perspective.

For us ""Flatlanders"" it can be disorienting and uncomfortable to watch.  I'm glad I stuck with the movie to the wholeness of it.  Otherwise, it would have sucked eggs.",1377388800,,1368,4.757446808510639

It is a good story but it has one bad feature. The movie changes time settings so often and so fast that the story comes across as very choppy. It makes the theme of the movie hard to follow at times and it detracts from the actors performances and the story line itself.

I feel that the film had a much better potential but because of the choppiness it comes across as a poorly planned and edited film. I rated it as a 3 star item.

The performances of everyone involved with this move - from directing, to acting, to editing, to production design, to special effects, to music are all amazing.  Forget what you know about watching or telling a conventional story - and enjoy the way that multiple stories are told, intertwined, and contrasted here.

Although the film begins with a fractured and diffuse series of flashbacks and flash forwards, it is fascinating from the start. For the first hour, I was thinking, ""This movie is totally whack!"". Still, I could not look away. Each scene is enrapturing, disturbing, beautiful, emotional or all things at once.  By mid-film I could see the seemingly disparate elements of the story lines from each characters' lifetimes begin to merge into a story of good and evil, rupture and revolution, greed and kindness and above all, love.
The cast is as expansive and impeccable as is the film itself...and oh, the music, the cinematography, the make-up, the special effects! Oscar worthy performances abound.

Compared to the Matrix series, this movie is completely different, night and day different, which goes to show why the Wachowski's are two of the best directors/producers in Hollywood because of the diversity they show in this famous flick.  it offers a story, a certain way of thinking that still haunts me (in a good way) to this day.

5266188,4,B0095HHM78,"So... how blooming good was Cloud Atlas eh!

I mainly watched it because it was nearly three hours long and I was on a 24hr+ flight, but Cloud Atlas stood up as a lot more than a time filler. This is how sci-fi movies should be made! An epic romp through time with multiple stories interconnecting via reincarnation...

...AND Halle Berry jiggling about. Mmmarvellous!

Special mention has to go to Hugh Grant who for once isn't playing Hugh Grant (i.e. posh, foppish, bumbling Englishman). He actually makes for quite a passable bad-guy. Also, whilst we're on the subject of bad-guys; Hugo Weaving. He's good isn't he?! A really, really GOOD bad-guy! He has absolutely nailed the malevolent on-screen baddie. So much so that even as Elrond in LOTR (& despite knowing the story) I was still expecting the old double-cross.

Anywho, I digress, back to Cloud Atlas, where was I? Cracking plot... excellent cast... ah yes, MAKE-UP. Now, I have to say, one of the most enjoyable things for me about CA was trying to recognise which actors were which character in each incarnation. The make-up & prosthetics team have produced an absolute masterclass; changing the cast's appearance/gender/race in each sub-story, and making them recognisable (if you try really hard) yet still believable. Two of the best (spoiler alert) - Hugh Grant as the Kone Chief and Hugo Weaving as Nurse Noakes.

The fact that Cloud Atlas didn't get any Academy Award nominations was surprising, the fact that it didn't WIN Best Makup by a country mile was frankly criminal. I mean, Les Mis...? Really... ? I challenge anyone to watch the two movies and tell me that Les Mis did a better job.

It might have had something to do with Cloud Atlas bombing at the box-office, the Academy Awards do seem to favour commercial success over artistic integrity these days.

I have to say that if anyone was to blame for the box-office failure it would be the marketing team; I watched the trailers and adverts for Cloud Atlas, I'm a self confessed sci-fi fan (target audience!) and I still neither knew what the film was about nor had any great desire to go and watch it. But there lies the problem they had; how do you summarise the plot of a movie that is made up of so many interwoven stories, in a 3 minute trailer? Clearly, with great difficulty.

Still, I could bemoan the lack of awards or commercial success that Cloud Atlas suffered all day long but I think that would be doing it a disservice. Cloud Atlas is one of the most enjoyable movies in the genre of recent times. It brings together a host of Hollywood's finest in an expertly interwoven plot, excellent cinematography and some sphincter clenchingly good action sequences!

If you can find a written review with full spoilers that can be read in less than two minutes, you will have saved yourself some considerable agony by reading it and then passing this film by.

On the other hand, of course, if you are the sort of person who feels compelled to agree with those who feel that Carl Jung and Edgar Cayce were brilliant men of science out of a need for ""belonging"", then this movie is probably ripe for you.

It certainly kept me on the edge of my seat trying to understand the dialog.  By the end of the movie I had had an epiphany.  The language they were speaking has been used in another film: Airplane.

5266271,4,B0095HHM78,"Prior to watching Cloud Atlas, I knew absolutely nothing about the plot, context, or the original novel on which it is based. As you can imagine, I spent the first twenty minutes bewildered as to what was going on. As the film progressed and moments and characters began connecting however, I caught on. In my opinion, this is probably the most entertaining way to approach Cloud Atlas, so I'll keep my review spoiler-free for those that wish to do the same.

Taking on a novel of this magnitude was a bold undertaking, and directors Tykwer and the Wachowskis ought to be recognized for it. This film should have been an absolute trainwreck, but it miraculously dodges this territory. That alone is worth 3 stars in my book, and I think you'll agree after watching.

While I by no means loved Cloud Atlas, it is a very solid film. A medley of Hollywood genres (sci-fi, historical drama, sitcom, to name a few), it moves quickly between lofty sentimentality and fast-paced action, and thus avoids being excessively either. Again, Cloud Atlas could have easily veered into cringe-worthy campy-ness, but it doesn't to its credit.

Speedy transitions however cannot disguise its extensive run time (close to 3 hours, yikes), and there are definitely lulls in the film where this is particularly evident. The film is also led by a strong cast (big names include Tom Hanks, Hugo Weaving, and Halle Berry), who play an average of 5 characters each, one of the unique feats of Cloud Atlas (if this last part is confusing, watch the film and you'll know exactly what I mean). Doona Bae, a newcomer on the Western film scene, is particularly notable, and I was happy to discover she will be starring in the Wachowskis' upcoming release.

Past its varied offerings and genre-bending visuals, Cloud Atlas is a good film because it requires digestion. I finished the movie sort of dazed (again, it was long) and uncertain as to how I felt about it. Yet hours after it ended, I was still thinking about Cloud Atlas- the story, the characters, the ideas it propounds. I find I'm looking forward to re-watching it to catch things I missed on the first go. It is definitely not a film one watches and then immediately forgets, and it elicits a response from the viewer- good or bad. I believe that sort of impact is paramount to any truly influential film.

If you're looking for something to break the monotony of the blockbuster film circuit, I strongly recommend Cloud Atlas.",1375660800,2,2461,4.767605633802817

5266291,5,B0095HHM78,"I did not think it would be possible in my lifetime for a movie to surpass Apocalypse Now as my greatest movie of all time. Cloud Atlas does. Like a symphonic work of one of the great composers, the theme of Cloud Atlas is interwoven throughout the work with masterful skill and careful attention.

Indeed there will be those who don't get it. Ironically, in many respects, the folks who don't get it are a major theme of this movie. Hence, why Cloud Atlas is such a tremendous achivement, indeed a masterpiece.

At the time, and in its context, Apocalypse Now was also a ""bomb"". Upon further reflection, however, and more viewings, it became apparent to many that Apocalypse Now was a tremendous achievement in film.

Cloud Atlas suffers from the same tragic treatment by critics and those who refuse to allow an objective perspective on a movie. Upon subsequent review, an objective critic will most likely reflect differently upon this film, once they realize what Cloud Atlas has achieved.

Again, this movie now sits firmly at the top of my list of greatest movies of all time. To supplant Apocalypse Now for the top spot was not something I expected out of Cloud Atlas and I am so very pleasantly surprised.

Laugh-out-loud funny, touching, inspiring, and amazing, since the movie inspired and touched me so, I purchased it for my closest friends and family to relish.  This was a copy I gave as a gift.

It took me the first 20-30 minutes to really catch on to the characters and events in each time period.  I was so amazed by this movie that I HAD to learn more about the book and film!  I do wish that I had done so before watching the movie because that would have made it a bit easier for me to follow.

5266312,5,B0095HHM78,"If you are like me, this film came and went through theatrical release without the slightest notice.  Never even saw a preview or a promo.  Probably says more about me than it says about the film, since there are more than ten times the number of reviews I expected to see (ten TIMES, not ten more), so obviously this film is generating some well-deserved buzz.

I stumbled on this island of brilliance while wading through oceans of dreck on our local Redbox machine.  The title piqued my interest, as did the participation of two Wachowski siblings.  That was pretty much all I knew about it, so I'm about as close as you might find to a ""virgin"" viewer.

I pity (if not fear for) anyone who was not moved by the tremendous currents of humanity (as in, humaneness) coursing throughout the film.  Yes, the numerous plot lines can be a bit confusing, and the future-dialect of Hanks & Barry & Sarandon is difficult to follow (try turning on subtitles?).  I also thought Hugo Weaving as Hanks' ""demon"" conscience (for lack of a better descriptive term) was rather obtusely introduced and depicted in cringe-inducing fashion.  Perhaps this was precisely the point, and you certainly can't fault Weaving for throwing himself into the role with his trademark zeal.

Still, the ensemble cast is impressive for essentially the entire film, even though it can be a bit distracting (e.g., is that Jim Broadbent AGAIN?).  Honestly, the performances are tremendous -- I never once felt an actor or actress was out of their depth (although Doona Bae as an aging Latina sweatshop owner was too much of a reach -- and a waste of make-up!).  Jim Broadbent's escapades in trying to escape a prison-like retirement community had me in unexpected hysterics -- no mean feat.

The prevailing theme, explored in myriad ways, is the unfolding tension between two competing world-views:  one, a crude oversimplification of the Nietzschean saw that ""the weak are meat,"" which ""the strong do eat.""  The other, that love is eternal, and the consequences of our actions -- particularly those that are noble or selfless -- ripple into eternity.  The vagaries of human behavior are on full display here, from the most heinous and base to the most inspired and inspirational.

I never once felt bored or distracted through the entire 2 hours and 50 minutes, even though I was expecting something much shorter (I had it in my head that it was 1 hour 40 minutes long, for unknown reason).  Quite frankly, I didn't want it to end, or I wish they incorporated even more.

Edifying cinematic experiences like this are far too few, so I intend to savor Cloud Atlas through my memory -- and periodic future viewings -- for the rest of my life.  Bravo! Encore!",1375315200,,2723,4.777777777777778

I was under the impression that the characters in each story carried over from previous incarnations in new bodies, but I lost that in many cases.

Quite a lot of people seem to think that the story is too unwieldy and hard to follow, but for those who prefer more sophisticated story telling, that's not the case at all. Though I suppose if your standard fare is more along the lines of Fast and the Furious 72 or Twilight, then perhaps you SHOULD move on.

I would say that watching it twice is pretty much a must. The first time through, just follow the individual stories and the main characters' plots. The second time around is really the best time to dive into the subtle nuances and foreshadowing hidden in the story as a whole. Following that approach would really enlighten most of the people who seem to be otherwise stumped by the sheer scale of the undertaking.

Visually the movie is absolutely stunning and the acting is very strong 99% of the time (though there is one scene in particular where Tom Hanks' approach makes me shudder with horror, but it's a very short scene, so thank God for that...). Even the soundtrack is absolutely delightful and well worth a buy if you happen to go in for things like that.

All in all, this is a superb film and I honestly can't recall the last time I've been so in love and enthralled by a movie/book in the last decade. So don't believe the naysayers! Rent it from Redbox or Amazon and draw your own conclusions, if nothing else.",1375142400,3,1465,4.438661710037175

If you persist in watching it, it becomes easier but never as clear as each story could have been by itself, so all this trickery is a waste of time.  Looking closely you will see that they borrowed from many other movies including Soylent green.

One positive item is the ending credits where we see the cameos of the actors next to their names instead of an endless scroll of names of which we might know some and might not know others.

I understand that Hollywood now uses software to dream up plot lines that tend to make money. This film plays contrary to that concept with no less than 6 separate story lines and challenging the talented cast by making them preform in multiple character rolls that span centuries and even play different genders and ethnicities. If I recollect correctly I believe I counted Tom Hanks acting as six characters.

The cast does an outstanding job delivering depth and freshness to each character in each story line. And such a fantastic story! There are previous reviews stating that the film was too difficult to follow. It is indeed a complicated plot that is also time consuming at 172 minutes but it keeps you riveted and interested as one starts getting involved enough to note where the separate story lines cross and and the message, and it is an important message for our world too, starts becoming clear. Unlike the garbage that most film studios turn out today - there actually is something to be learned from this film. I won't ruin it for the reader of this review by revealing what that message is - watch the movie and find out for yourself.

Even though it has been rated ""R"" this film maybe appropriate for viewing by mature teens. There is some nudity and mature subject matter.

The movie keeps feeling as if its coming to a head, about to reveal something, about to transcend what's on the screen, then fails miserably...over and over and OVER, for THREE HOURS.  Hollywood finally comes up with a remotely interesting idea then tries too hard when it shouldn't and not hard enough when it should. It feels more like a bunch of guys on acid made some random stories then put them through a shredder and taped them back together with scotch tape.  There are only feeble, occassional attempts at making the stories parallel.  Art is like Zen, if you think you have it, you don't.

5266424,5,B0095HHM78,"I finally watched this film on DVD after it was released in the Spring. From the previews and trailers that I saw months prior, I was really looking forward to viewing this complex film. I'd have to say that this isn't your typical movie where you can go into it without any prior knowledge. This film is from a complex novel with six mini-stories all wrapped into one work. I will admit that I didn't read nor did I even know much about the novel but I am fascinated with the concept of reincarnation. And this movie covered that topic beautifully. I plan to purchase the DVD and watch it multiple times and my feeling is, I will learn and acquire more from it every time I see it again.

I will admit, I found myself confused in the beginning but I couldn't help but stay glued to the screen the entire duration of this nearly three hour film. It starts to pull together shortly thereafter and as another reviewer expressed, it's highly advisable to stick around for the ending so that you can see the actors's credits with short clips of the movie additionally displayed; showing their multiple different characters. They are, for the most part, unrecognizable in a couple of their roles. The wardrobe and makeup were both incredibly amazing.

Since this story has six subplots (technically seven with the brief prolouge and epilogue), I can see how this might turn quite a few people off. It gives the impression that there is no protagonist and therefore, no sense of perspective by a main character. Technically that would be correct to assert but after all; this movie is about reincarnation and how multiple lives are connected. And that topic is a complex one indeed. Creating a presentation of this nature is a huge feat but one that I think the writer/diretors of Cloud Atlas captured stunningly.

What I also loved about this movie was how it prompted the viewer to ponder and think of controversial topics; possibly challenging current day beliefs. For example, one that comes to mind is the idea that clones are nothing more than soul""less"" genetic material to be harvested and/or exploited for human use. In the case of Sonmi-451 (fabricant/clone) from Seoul, Korea in the year 2144 we see that her character not only had past lives, but she's also spiritually evolved and enlightened to the point that she's mistakenbly believed to be a Goddess by the inhabitants of the Big Island in a couple hundred year's time in the year 2321. Of course, it's just a fictional movie but I really thought it was amazing that a movie of this nature could make a viewer think and ask, ""What if that were true...?""

This movie kinda reminds me of Mulholland Drive (2001) only in the sense that it is quite complicated but you get more and more from the film after seeing it again and again.",1374710400,2,2790,4.653144016227181

SO, with that being said, i still loved the movie and enjoyed seeing the visual interpretation of a valuable and moving story that i think is relevant to every single one of us. i DO recommend the movie, especially if you're not a reader...i think you'll enjoy it immensely, either way. just remember to pay attention, it's one of those movies. :)",1374624000,,951,4.534883720930233

Cloud Atlas tells the stories of two couples, reincarnated through the ages, and how karma impacts everyone. The movie is told differently than the book, staggering the stories, but this works better for Hollywood; it was easier to maintain continuation of all the timelines.

The make up and costumes were fantastic. Each actor wore between five and seven different looks!

Someone mentioned using subtitles in certain parts: do. It'll be easier than having to rewind, or thinking that you got the idea, but...

5266508,5,B0095HHM78,"One of my alltime favourites, even when there are so much bad critics. But don't worry about it, the movie itself gives you the recipe, what to do with bad critics... (just a joke, i'm a peaceful person)

I saw this film above the clouds for the first time, and without a minute of a break for a second time. The special concept of this movie fascinates me so much. But be aware, it is nothing for everybody, you cannot lean back and focus on Coke and popcorn, definitely not. A view to the statistics here says all: there's not a lot between one and five stars, you will love it or hate it. Six different stories are mixed up in a fast cut, and they are connected in any ways, but not clearly evidently. Reincarnation is a theme what bindes the different stories together, although not in the way as you can follow one or another character in his/her direct karmic steps. There is much space left for your own imagination and way of thinking, and that is what i love. I feel that this movie want to activate your thinking about the things we don't know yet and it won't show you a definite message... So i also guess, that exactly this is the point, what confuses so many people.

There's no absolute need to read the novel, book and film are two completely different pair of shoes. I like both, and i'm happy, the film doesn't follow the novel 1:1 The book is written in a fix timeline from the oldest story to the newest, always ending abruptely in the middle, and goes back again after reaching the latest future. This works for the written version excellently, but it would not for the film, which is made as when the story would be thrown in a mixer. Makes it speedy and interesting, You're at every moment present in all the six different stories, and that's genious. All the actors play different roles, what confuses the karmic idea much more. They do not follow an exact karmic line. My favourite from the cast is Korean actress Doona Bae. That magical moment, when a tear appears out of her emotionless but emotional face, that moment alone is worth an Oscar. She's definitely predestined for roles as the slave replicant Sonmi 451. Not for the first time she play a role as this one. No need to loose words about all the other well known actors, they do a great job, sorry, they do a lot of great jobs here...

A negative point, the only one from my point of view, is the soundtrack. As far as there is with the 'Cloud Atlas Sextett' a 'composition of the century' a main theme in one of the stories, so there should be really a mindblowing soundtrack, but it is not. it's just an ordinary 0815 score. This is not a low budget project, so why does the director (Tykwer) co-write the music? He's not a composer. Following the plot i would recommend to engage two different ones of the great filmmusic composers from today. My imagination: Hans Zimmer and A.R. Rahman could really make it mindblowing...

One word about the DVD release: I am always frustrated about the international licence rules. I want to see this movie with the original score in english, and i want to have english subtitles as well, but here in switzerland it is impossible to get this. (at least not for now)

My recommendations: If you love complex stories, unorthodox ways of film making and Art Movies, it is a must, to see. If you prefer to relax and get entertained, so safe your time and money and let it be.

And finally, to confuse everybody: There is not just one fix theory about reincarnation, there are hundred of different meanings and theories about. The most provocative idea (not from me): There is just one soul, in the whole universe, and the time is not linear... 'Everybody in this world is the same person' (Buddhadasa Bhikkhu, 1952)

That is why we have so many questions about it, because the characters understand their lives to be real and urgent and they are unconcerned with explaining things to us in the usual ways that characters do but real people never do.

That made me enjoy the movie on a deeper level: it isn't about the facts of the case at hand, it is about underlying human struggle.

It's often times operatic and sweeping in nature, it contains several courageous and effective performances, and is as thoughtful a character drama as it is an adventurous space odyssey.

The story is developed from a book, and i stress again that the interviews are really precious as far as showing the amount of thought and the amount of work that went into the making of Cloud Atlas. The attention to details is paramount, it took the team several months to organize it, and i have to say the result is unique.
Stories that intersect throughout different centuries, with accomplished actors that play as many as six different characters each. I think especially Tom Hanks was brilliant, in one of his best performances to date.
The lesson is about freedom and karma if you will accept the concept even through a westerner's eye, not bound to a specific century nor skin color or social caste.

Note: Before you begin reading, I'd like to note that writing about this film was a bit of a nightmare for myself. I say this not to inspire sympathy, but to note what kind of film this and that I may need to watch it more than once (which I most certainly will!). Hopefully, I hope to those that read enjoy.

It's weird how things turn out and what people react to certain artworks. One man's masterpiece is another man's garbage. Another's favorite author is on another person's all time most hated author's list. One person worship a welcome franchise while another wishes to go up in flames. All works react differently to others, and sometimes, its fascinating to see how others react to it. Such is the case of Cloud Atlas.

Cloud Atlas came out during the Oscar season of 2012 to a very mixed reception. Based on the book of the same name by David Mitchell (who gets a nice little cameo near the end of the film!), the film sported currently sports a 67% on Rotten Tomatoes and while that usually implies a mixed to positive response, looking at the actual responses of critics was something else entirely. To illustrate; The late and great Roger Ebert remarked the film as being one of the most ambitious pictures ever made and even made a nice mention on his end of the year list. On the other, TIME magazine said the film was one of the worst, if not the worst, film of the year.

So where do I stand in the skies of Atlas? Well, from the first few minutes of the film, I knew I something in for something different. Atlas is a film that hits spans the emotional spectrum in a bunch of different ways; One moment, you'll be laughing at the absurdity of one segment of a man trying to pay the debts of a couple gangsters; The next, being enthralled by intense action and sociopolitical messages of a futuristic Korea ruled by ruthless capitalism and extremely bright scenery. It all paints the way for a sprawling, fantastical and massive story.

The film is has about 6 different stories going on at the same time, from decade to decade to century, etc. All of the film's stories are interconnected in someway, shape or form. One person's life is read in another decade while another's actions are seen as heroics and godly-like worship. Reincarnation is the name of the game and the film has a field day with this subject. The order of the segments is as follows (which is also lovingly introduced to the audience in an ordered manner) :

The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing: The story of a dying man (Jim Sturgess) traveling from New Zealand to the United States while dealing with a parasite that's killing him, his doctor (Tom Hanks) and a black stowaway (David Gyasi) he becomes buds with. This story is set in 1859.

Letters From Zedelghem: Robert Frobisher (Ben Whishaw), a bisexual composer, works with a aging musician (Jim Broadbent) to help him compose new music, which leads us to the film's musical motif, The Cloud Atlas Sextet. This story is set in 1931.

Half-Lives: The First Luisa Rey Mystery: Luisa Rey (Halle Berry) is a reporter for a small time magazine and soon finds her self in a corporate conspiracy that could cost her life. This story is set 1973.

The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish: A publisher (Jim Broadbent) finds himself dealing with psychotic gangsters and an oppressive retirement home in an attempt to pay off a couple of debts and reunite with the love of his life (Susan Sarandon). This story is 2012.

An Orison of Sonmi-451: A Brave New World meets Blade Runner story about a clone (Doona Bae) who works at a McDonald's-esque restaurant and becomes friends with a freedom fighter (Jim Sturgess). This story takes place in 2144.

Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin After: Set 106 years after to Sonmi-451 segment (and apparently after the end of the world), this one tells the tale of a native named Zachry (Tom Hanks) and his life with a tribe on the islands of Hawaii. He also meets a woman named Meronym (Halle Berry), a member from a sec of technologically advanced humans that observes the villagers from time to time.

If there was ever a word to describe Atlas, it would most certainly be ambitious. The sheer scale of the film and its cast brings to mind the great big blockbusters you'd see in the summer movie season, rather than an Oscar film. There's a wealth of things for the audience to experience here, even with its all over the place narrative. For an almost three hour film, the film moves by awfully quickly. There's almost never dull moment, with each segment constantly showing you something new and never slowing down.

However, as much as I like this bold perspective, it does come with some problems. At times, I would almost wish the film would abandon its way and just play the segments individually or at least playing them in massive chunks rather than what I see here. It can end up slightly ruining the moment of one part, in which I feel like I'm forced to switch from feeling tearful and weary to excited in a minute.

Acting wise, everyone in the film is giving their all and its surprising to see actors play people we would never expect to see them do in a million years. Would you ever expect Tom Hanks to play an unpleasant Cockney gangster or an evil, greedy doctor? Or Hugh Grant play a corrupt executive or a cannibal tribesman? Course not, but its frankly miraculous to see everyone doing something different. And this is where the film's makeup comes into play, transforming actors into entirely different people. While some of it can look pretty obvious (the segments in Korea have attracted some backlash due to some of the Caucasian actors made to look Asian), most of the time, I'd find myself baffled at who was what, especially when the end credits reveals who played who.

Outside of the makeup, the film itself is a technical and audio marvel, thanks to cinematographer John Toll (The Thin Red Line, Iron Man 3, The Last Samurai). The Korean segments in particular, are frankly astonishing to look at and the costume design is equally up to snuff. On the audio side of things, the magnificent score by director Tom Tykwer, Johnny Klimek and Reinhold Heil is something that sweeps the audience of its feet. The Cloud Atlas Sextet, the film's musical motif  shows in a bunch of different ways and I always find myself humming to its notes, inspiring a strange sense of hope and wonder.

At times, Atlas can feel saccharine and sentimental with its themes (both literal and figuratively) and yet...there's a genuine feel of magic to the whole affair. When you laugh or yelp a squeal of excitement, it feels as it is earned, not forced, despite my aforementioned problems with the segment placement. It's a movie that deserves to be watched more than once, examined and thought about. It's a film that can be and will be argued till the end of time of its merits, whether it'd be seen as a masterpiece or a disaster. And you know what?

I'm actually okay with that.

And to cap of this review, I leave you with this quote from the main character of the Timothy Cavendish story:

""While my extensive experience as an editor has ledd me to a disdain for flashbacks and flash forwards and all such tricksy gimmicks I believe that if you, dear Reader, can extend your patience for just a moment, you will find that there is a Method to this tale of Madness.""",1373932800,,7685,4.638704930095659
5266534,1,B0095HHM78,I can't believe Tom Hanks and Halle Berry starred in this movie. The knock-off part of the Matrix was terrible - even making up someone to look kind of like Keanu Reeves. The basic premise is reincarnation and it was presented very badly. The movie jumped around time frames but you still knew exactly what was going to happen - unfortunately. Do NOT waste your money on this thing.,1373932800,,382,4.550724637681159
5266535,5,B0095HHM78,"This movie was recommended by my son. I wonder, did it make him a convert to his mother's weird belief's!!?  It is an awesome movie!! But before seeing it, I recommend you do as I did, which was to go read about what the story is about, otherwise it could be confusing to try and keep up with the characters as they play different parts in different lives.  Yes, it is about reincarnation or rebirth and the evolution of the Soul in learning or not learning life's lessons. It is like watching 5 movies in one as they go back and forth from their past lives to way into the future. The acting is brilliant!! the scene's are awesome to watch!! Blending Old World time periods with their conflicts and practices with the Matrix future!! It is so damned exciting to watch, as I laughed in some of the comedy action stories (Howard, from the Summerwine British comedies does a brilliant funny part!!; and I thought he was dead, but there he was looking the same!)  and cried at the end as the truth unfolded within these people's lives of  the evolving of their very Souls, more than any movie I have EVER wept upon seeing!! Tom Hanks and Hallie Berry were absolutely brilliant. The best acting I have ever seen from Tom Hanks as it shows how he shows up in the past life's and future characters. Because I was not sure of my actors from these makeup and costume changes, I almost wish they would have show the various character portrayals at the beginning like they did at the end. I am still confused a little as to who was who and the story line, but the watching is so great who cares!! In fact it will make you want to read the book and watch the movie again. Oh yes, it is also a Mystery Story about a musical manuscript that turns up in the different time periods following the characters involvement with it. Is it going to be saved or destroyed. You have to watch the movie to find out!!

It is sad that we, the audience and fans of these actors don't get to actually talk to them and have a discussion about the movie!!! Without us as the audience they would not have the ability to put out their creative offering and it is too bad it is such a one sided friendship because we do identify with these people and wonder upon seeing a movie like this if their belief's and philosophies match our own. No, we don't get to be their friends and run in their circles and vicariously get to be important too, but we do get to experience their awesome creativity and wish we were in their inner circle!! They seem to be TASK companions Souls with each other, members of a very special club.
  This is a long movie, so get your munchies and go to the bathroom first because you are not going to want to put it on pause and leave it for a single moment!!! I hated to even see it end as it transported me out of constant world bad news and into another time and place.......HOW EXCITING!!

It's rich enough to reward multiple viewings, but I felt that I understood it after only one. It's paced more deliberately than many modern films, but never boring.

You will need to be well rested, (it's nearly 3 hours long) and you will need to bring a few things with you.  One is your brain.  Yes, Virginia, you will have to think to comprehend this movie.  You will need to pay attention, listen carefully and think.
As one reviewer suggested, bring a Buddhist with you to explain some of the metaphysical aspects of the film.  You don't have to be a Buddhist to get it, but you should be familiar with the ideas reincarnation and karma.  That said, the film is not austere in any sense of the word.  It is fast-paced, and by turns, moving, thrilling and mesmerizing.
Watching for the principal actors in each time-frame is entertaining in a ""Where's Waldo?"" kind of way.  The effects are sumptuous, the story is meaty, and the transitions are deft. ""What's not to like?"" you may ask.  It's simple.  If you want a movie laid out in one or two straight plot-lines, cookie-cutter characters, some jiggling boobs, and a few sight-gags and pratfalls thrown in for good measure, you had better go dig out an old ""Dukes of Hazzard"" VHS tape and crack open a Bud.

I began to see the different meanings. Then the next day I went back and used my roku to hit various scenes throughout the film because I
felt myself being called to take a second look. I didn't of course have enough time to sit and watch again and I used the roku remote to
hit through various scenes. It helped and I saw things that I had missed the night before as well as came away with a new understanding
which has made me want to run out and get the book.

This is a moving and touching film and it matters. It's a film for thinkers as well as doers. I think it's an underrated movie and is deserving

5266683,4,B0095HHM78,"This is not a normal film.  If anyone comes at it thinking they'll be given a clear, linear narrative will be sorely disappointed.  The seven stories don't even connect in a straightforward way, and it's up to the viewer to see the echoes through time.  The story makes ripples, not waves with each story skipping off each other and sometimes only ancillary or seemingly arbitrary details are the only obvious connections the viewer can make.  The way the movie whispers, not shouts, its grand plot makes it far more compelling than the simple narratives so common in big-budget films today.

The seven stories as told are compelling in their own right, and made largely so by an excellent ensemble cast and for the most part the cast slips easily between roles.  Practically every cast member plays more than one character, with certain actors having roles in all seven stories.  Although Hanks does seem to have to most fluid performance he never really outshines anyone else in the cast.

Great visual effects and a good score are usually givens in Wachowski films, and here they do not disappoint.  The Neo Seoul scenes are nothing original in sci-fi but they are very well fleshed out and rendered, even if some of the makeup used to make some western actors look Asian does look a bit forced.

5266737,5,B0095HHM78,"Cloud Atlas, which alternates between six different time periods at an increasing rate throughout the movie, is one of those things that you think can never work, but then you come to see that it does, magnificently. It goes through several phases. First the setting up of each scenario: in the 1840s on the high seas, in the 1930s in Europe, in the 1970s in California, present-day England, a couple centuries hence in ""Neo-Seoul"", and a in primitive setting (initially) far in the future. In the first phase you start out confused, don't see how there can be any relation between the scenarios, and brace for two and a half hours of disappointment. But then, slowly, themes repeat, and it starts to come together. We fully enter the new phase where the scenario shifts start to occur much more quickly, and they are clever: each scene dovetails into the next from another time with a similar situation, or word or phrase, or theme, or physical location. Then all six stories start to reach their climaxes, and the time-switching switches into high gear. Here there's a lot of Wachowski-trademarked intense violence (although no slow-fast motion martial arts, a la The Matrix (well, close, in Neo-Seoul (get it? Neo?))). And then the denouements reveal the overall theme, which I will not attempt to summarize, and it becomes crystal clear. And it's beautiful.

5266762,3,B0095HHM78,"Cloud Atlas is a good film that could have been a great film if it had not been so confusing and inconsistent. Allow me to elaborate further. The film did have MANY positive, appealing aspects to it, it was visually stunning, had many rich and interesting characters, both good and bad, as well as very strong spiritual themes such as reincarnation and the belief that there is a bond that connects us all. However, the fact that it kept switching back and forth, changing characters, style of dialogue, and even tone (some stories were more humorous or dramatic than others), it almost felt like I was watching six separate movies instead of one cohesive one. I understand that all of the stories are connected and feature the same actors/actresses so it's obviously meant to be just one film, the settings and tones, as previously mentioned, were so diverse and different that I still had trouble connecting them to the other stories. One story, the 19th century one, felt like a historical adventure film a la Pirates of the Caribbean, The story that takes place in the far future, with Tom Hanks and Halle Berry meeting up in a setting which oddly reminded me of Battlestar Galactica, seems like a Sci-Fi epic similar to Avatar or Star Wars and the story that takes place in modern times seems like something Guy Ritchie or Shane Meadows would direct. It was all very inconsistent and very unnecessary. However, I greatly did enjoy all of the actors playing such wildly different characters, especially Tom Hanks, who plays both very villainous and very heroic roles, demonstrating how he eventually redeems himself of his past sins and negative karma. I have heard this film described as a very ""Buddhist"" film and I certainly agree, many of the central themes of Buddhism such as karma, reincarnation, dharma, and samsara. I feel that there aren't enough films of this sort being made nowadays and I greatly enjoyed watching it. Cloud Atlas is no masterpiece, at least in my view, but neither is it pretentious or overwrought, it's just an enjoyable film which I'm glad I managed to watch in all it's roughly 3 hour running time.

5266765,5,B0095HHM78,"I held off on watching this movie in theaters because of very mixed review from movie critics, and a 55 average on Metacritic. I finally got a chance to see it on Blu-ray, and man I'm sorry I didn't go see it sooner.

This is hands down the best movie I've seen in years. Even at 3 hours running time, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen for a second. I can't remember the last time a movie had me fully engrossed on this level. The style of the film, having multiple stories across multiple timelines all tying into one another in various ways, directly and indirectly, is ambitious to say the least. The fact that it succeeds in remaining cohesive and interesting throughout is a feat in and of itself, but it goes one step further by telling stories that would all hold up on their own, with characters you genuinely grow to love.

I won't even attempt to give a plot synopsis, as that would take many paragraphs, but suffice it to say that the movie is about life, art, love, and fate, and how each life effects one another. It may sound corny when summed up into those four simple words, but the movie is so genuine in the presentation of it's message that it's hard not to be moved by it. The writers did a fantastic job crafting such a bold story.

The actors had quite a challenge making this movie. They all play multiple characters throughout the film, and each character they play is different. Wildly different. Each actor had to portray several characters with different personalities, different accents, different ages, races, and even genders. We often see actors play several characters across several movies, but they remain the same character within each movie. It was really impressive to see the same actor play many roles within the same movie and pull it off.

The special effects are top notch, and never look fake or cheesy. One thing I was surprised by was the amount of action in the movie. I didn't expect much action, and although it isn't on the level of a Michael Bay movie, there is certainly more than enough to satisfy fans of previous Wachowski movies like The Matrix. The movie is beautiful, with detailed sets and costumes, lots of CGI enhanced backgrounds, and gorgeous cinematography. Interestingly, because the focus of the movie is on the characters and not on the action, and the action is used sparingly, it brought more weight to the action when it happened. The stakes were higher because characters can and do die throughout the movie, and you're emotionally invested in them.

Now, good makeup and special effects do not a good movie make. Fortunately for Cloud Atlas, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. It is through the deft hands of the directors that everything comes together to make an unforgettable experience.

If you haven't seen this movie yet, watch it now. If you have a Blu-ray player, the stunning visuals demand HD viewing. Don't be dissuaded by the negative, jaded critics. Cloud Atlas is a masterpiece.",1372896000,5,2981,4.657794676806084
5266766,5,B0095HHM78,"Cloud Atlas is an incredible movie, but it does require patience and focus.  The beginning scenes are somewhat confusing, and it could be easy to get lost in the first half of the movie.  Six separate storylines spanning five centuries is ambitious, to say the least.

But it's well worth the challenge.  There is so much hidden intrigue, and the relationship between the stories multiplies the depth.  Each story is unique; they range from humorous to horrific and mundane to magical.  Again, the presence of so many interwoven tales will create problems for moviegoers more acclimated to high-budget action flicks and comedic farces.  Cloud Atlas has a complex plot that is more important than the special effects, but that's often the opposite of what the general public wants.

There's a fascinating synergy here between the different timelines that is unlike anything I can remember.  When I finished watching the movie the first time through, I was left with burning questions.  I wondered, ""What does it all mean?""  So I thought about it a while, then watched Cloud Atlas again.

I also very much enjoy Tom Hanks and Hallie Berrie as actors. I can't say that I enjoy all their movies but I have seen quite and I do like most of them. They made a good pairing playing both opposite and in tangent with each other.

If you're in the mood for a straightforward action thriller, it is not... thought it has some blood and gore at times.  Yes, this story is complex, but then that's the magic of it.  The movie's multiple time lines tie together some important universal concepts... love, predestination, freewill, religion, etc.  The characters all seem real, and depict recognizable events in history (thought they happen someplace else).  This is one of Tom Hanks' best work.  The level of stardom here is unbelievable.

I suppose this movie didn't get the attention it deserved because it asks a lot from the audience.  This a long movie, with many scenarios.  What surprised me is that the suspense at the beginning never gives up... it only builds.  The story unfolds like a rose, revealing more and more truths, but also showing the gruesome realities of the human condition.

This is not a story where the bad guys are rounded up and put in jail at the end.  Real life isn't usually like that.  What is shown is that the struggle, the fight, is important.

The cast is mainly a list and they all do wonderful jobs bringing believability to thier multiple roles in multiple situations. My only problem is the climax scenes where things become slightly jumpy. Though the directors of the Matrix movies loom large over this tale given thier past record. This is one of thier better movies. It not overly preach in plot, and despite the multiple stories seemingly being disjointed from one another, the plot eventually focuses on a singular theme between each tail.

My only reason I think it will be misunderstood is because most expectations will center around the directors' past movies. Most of which are anime and comic adaptations. But this film is really much like thier first movies before much of that. More in the thinking genre with strong character visuals and layered ploting.

What we liked was at the end where the stories kinda came together and the message of being true to yourself came out. It was very well done visually but we feel it would have worked better had they finished one segment then went on to the next one rather than jumping back and forth.

I frankly lost interest though it did seem to get better as it went along; my partner enjoyed it more and teared up during some scenes. The visuals were one of the high points of the movie however there was too much violence and some of it cheap shots. It seems like action took the place of thinking for the writer of the story.

First - we are all connected with each other - not only in our present time,
but ever since the long, long ago past times and centuries, as well as in
coming future times.
Second - already during the long ago past, we created the pathways for our
present lives and the surroundings/circumstances we are living in, and we
keep creating the parameters for our future to come.
Third - Death is but a transition from one incarnation to the next.

These are the basic ideas which keep unfolding through the lives of six
protagonists who live in different times. Different people, different ways
of live - but still they are connected with each other through their acts
and decisions, by which they keep influencing not only their very own life
and people in it, but also the lives of others still to come in future centuries.
Decisions, several people made in the 19th century, for instance, and how
these decisions kept influencing future lives 300 years later and even
further on to future individuals.

In a time, where the last natural ressources of our planet are being
exploited for greed of profit; in a time, where the wealthy industrial
nations are making even more profit on the backs of the poor Third-
World-Countries' populations, up to such highly perverted stockmarket-poker
with shares on basic foods -
in such times as these, isn't it high time to ask ourselves, whether we
might have a responsibility in what is happening here?
Are we really thinking that we will get away with it when we die, and
leave this ""legacy"" that we created to our future generations to clean up?
What if these `future generations' will be nobody else than us - in a new
body though, even possibly holding a different sex or ethnic background -
but the problems, the circumstances, we will be facing then, we did create
ourselves centuries ago already - the small-scale ones as well as the
big-scale ones.

Fourth idea: Change thinking. Trespass boundaries and dare act against
conventions - even then, when it's uncomfortable; when the majority or the
holders of power don't like it.

I was delighted to find an intricate set of six stories woven together so that the story lines flowed coherently. It takes incredible skill to have pulled off the ambition that Cloud Atlas represents.

Cloud Atlas is thoroughly entertaining throughout, in drama, adventure, with comedy bits sprinkled in.

This is a movie that merits repeated viewing, as there are so many details in this rich tapestry. The repeated, rather astonishing logical interlocking of sequential segments in the storytelling can only begin to be appreciated upon a second viewing.

We watched with captions on the first time, which is practically a necessity to catch all the dialogue, though most of it is clear enough.

While ultimately this is a message film, that reveals itself overtly only in the end, and wraps up the movie intelligently.

This movie requires close attention. Reviews that complain about the film being boring, or not being able to follow the film, are by people who need to stick to short-attention-span theater (bang-bang action and pratfall humor).

Having watched the film six times now, it has become easy to appreciate that Cloud Atlas is the greatest movie ever made, in effortless storytelling of a complexity never attempted in film before, and in effectively conveying a life-affirming philosophy while being an action/adventure film of the highest magnitude.

If you are interested in film as culture as well as entertainment, this is a rewarding must-see.",1372291200,2,1545,5.107142857142857
5266899,4,B0095HHM78,"because of negative reviews I saw when film initially came out, I didn't expect to like it.  I don't remember the reviews, only that most of the ones I read weren't enthusiastic.  I'm happy to say I liked it much more than I thought I would. Film is ambitious, speaks to the underdogs amongst us, and is highly romantic in a pro-humanity way.  The theme of repeated lives apparently is limited to humans, no other animals/life forms are shown as getting multiple bites at the apple.  Think I would have been more likely to accept the story's reincarnation theme if it included additional life forms.  Limiting reincarnation to people made the story seem like species propaganda.

Humans are top dog on earth, we eat just about whatever we want, and then create fictional worlds where we create additional lives to do the same.  Not even in our imaginings do we include reincarnation for animals we consider inferior/subordinate/different from us/less than us.  We're a very species-centric animal, no matter how good, kind and sweet some of us may want to be.  Not a hater of my species, just saying.

Two weak points in my opinion were, why did the young man commit suicide.  I know things were going badly for him and that he was being blackmailed, but I guess I didn't find the story proved well enough why he felt suicide was his only option; his suicide made no sense to me.  Another thing, why was the young freed female slave the only one who the resistance felt could lead the revolt.  I think the story didn't explain loudly enough what she brought to the table.  The rebels spent considerable time and effort freeing and protecting her, and the story didn't explain why her, exactly.  Other than what I've pointed, thought film was pretty good, I laughed, I cried.  Rate 3 and 3/4 stars rounded up to 4, as Amazon doesn't allow for fractions.  Checked it out from the library but would definitely buy it if I had the funds.  Well done filmmaking team.

P.S. I'd buy this film, despite the flaws that in my opinion it has, because I'm a middle age women, experienced viewing film stories, and none are perfect. The film I've ever seen that got closest to perfection was Lucas's Star Wars, a New Hope.

It is rare that artist can cross over from one medium to another and capture the true essence of the work ...in tact...unmolested... Clearly, for me anyway, the theme of reincarnation and life after death rang true..for true-true..loud and clear...as did elements of Buddahism. I got that from the characters from the Big ISLE,tribalism, post-apocalyptic, as well as the slavery overtones. This movie, Lincoln, and Django Unchained seemed all to dwell in bondage and I wonder if the theme of bondage spans the obvious type of bondage but alludes to bondage of the mind as well...

I knew this was woven too well and had to be based on a novel or something similar and sure enough that was the case (a novel of the same title by David Mitchell). It even ran out of funding at one point but all the people were so enthusiastic they took cuts and pressed on from what the Wiki claims.

I liked how actors and actresses played several roles (male and female of varying ages) and some of them I didn't recognize until the end credits rolled. The star-studded cast included: Tom Hanks, Hugo Weaving, Halle Berry, Hugh Grant, James D'Arcy, Jim Broadbent and a host of others.

Hugo Weaving plays the pessimistic voice that ""It will never work"" just as Elrond to his daughter in LORD OF THE RINGS. I found that quite amusing.

Tom Hanks plays a villain in one of the story angles which was a nice change and nothing I have ever seen him do as he's always the ""good guy"".

Reincarnation themes and spirituality connecting humanity's souls are prevalent.

I agree with film critic Roger Ebert that this was quite an ambitious film. It took me by surprise quite nicely. The Golden Globes nominated it for Best Original Score and the Academy Awards nominated it for Best Visual Effects.

The budget was a bit over $100M and it cleared a bit over $130M at the Box Office. Casual viewers may have to struggle with the film before ""getting it"" and appreciating its nuances.

SOUND/MUSIC: A minus to A; CINEMATOGRAPHY/CGI: A minus; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: A minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus; SCI FI FOCUSES/THEMES: B to B plus; OVERALL GRADE: B plus to A minus; WHEN WATCHED: end of June 2013 (will be watching a second time before I return the DVD).",1372118400,,1806,4.6750788643533125

Maybe it was the difficulty in picking just the right elements to put on the screen from an epic spanning 500 years... Maybe it was the actors who just seemed to be walking through their parts. Maybe it was the constant jumping around from one scene to another with very little continuity between them.

I literally counted down the days till Cloud Atlas was available on DVD but after watching the first five minutes of the movie I found myself dis-interested and going onto the Amazon website to sell back the DVD. I watched the entire movie but I should have purchased the $3.99 instant video versus wasting money purchasing the DVD (Note: I purchased the DVD because I thought the movie was going to be ""deep"" or ""exciting"" and I may need to rewind scenes but that did not happen...).

PROS: 1) Tom Hanks and Halle Berry are GREAT actors in general and I liked the versatility of the actors within the various time periods 2) Interesting overall theme of karma, past lives, we're all connected, etc. 3) A few good scenes in the movie.

CONS: 1) Most of the good scenes were already reflected in the movie trailer 2) The movie was way too long (should have been two hours instead of three hours) 3) Too much switching back and forth between time periods, which was a bit confusing and disconnected 4) the overall theme of the movie was not clearly communicated in the movie 5) the movie needed more action scenes considering it was a 3 hour movie 6) The movie would have been more successful if it was edited to a Rated PG-13 movie instead of the current Rated R with unnecessary cursing, nudity, sex scenes, etc.",1371686400,5,1351,4.551440329218107

It also examines how a god figure is created. This is a movie that will promote discussion and debate.  Aside from the high concept themes, ""Cloud Atlas"" has something for everyone: romance, mystery, comedy, and even some good sci-fi action. Note that the film has an R rating, and contains some disturbing scenes.

As most of the lead actors played multiple roles in this movie, some of the makeup effects were less believable than others, and some seemed gratuitous, but the story of ""Cloud Atlas"" held my interest from start to finish.

Clocking in at just under three hours, this movie shifts between stories and timelines more than any film I've ever seen - the result could have been a mess - they did a great job making the whole experience cohesive and satisfying at the conclusion - there wasn't one boring moment.

The lives of many generations of the same pair of souls interact through hundreds of years of reincarnations to culminate in an important event far into the future.

Actors play multiple roles and in some cases you won't realize it until they show the credits at the end.

""Our lives are not our own. From birth to grave we are bound to others, and with each crime and every kindness, we birth our future"" - the recurring quote and theme throughout.

Very good and although a tad bit slow at times, it is nonetheless intelligent enough to keep your attention to the very end.

5267074,5,B0095HHM78,"At the time of this writing, Cloud Atlas has garnered provoked nearly 900 reviews here on Amazon - there's very little I can add that hasn't been said before. The reviews run the gamut from 1 star to 5 stars. As you've seen, I'm in the 5 star category - not a film ""classic"" but rather a film that deserves to be seen; and must be seen.

I stayed away from Cloud Atlas for a long time, fearing Matrix 3 version 2.0. And while there are definitely some Matrix-y things in one particular story thread (some of the costumes, hairstyles, visuals, ""Neo-Seoul"" etc.) there was only one meaningful and important connection between The Matrix trilogy and this film: the visionary skill of Lana and Andy Wachowski who, along with Tom Twkyer, have created a visual feast for the eyes and a thought provoking movie for the soul.

This is a hauntingly beautiful film - there are images that linger long in the mind, and return over and over again. Yes, at some point most people will cease to care about the much touted  inter-connections and relationships between characters and situations.  I think that is a good thing. At some point, just fully immerse yourself in the flow of this brilliantly edited film and follow it to its illuminating and emotional core. I don't think you'll be disappointed.

As many have said, the cast is superb - with far too many performances worth singling out.

Just wanted to get one more 5-star review into the mix. I think this film should have gotten a lot more attention than it did upon its release.",1371686400,2,1526,4.591911764705882

As for story, it is a refreshing theme of several spirits (personalities) that basically have had multiple reincarnations thru multiple centuries.  For instance, you get to see Tom Hanks' character from pre-historic times all the way to the 21st or 22nd century (I forget the actual date).

Its a different and rare storyline that really should be viewed instead of read about.  It is a must-have for movie collectors in my opinion...and should have been chosen as Picture of the Year along with Life of Pi.",1371600000,,666,5.064220183486238
5267091,2,B0095HHM78,"This is the kind of film I would have enjoyed in my mid to late teens as it offers a gateway to some powerful messages wrapped in un-orthodox story telling and cool looking visuals, but honestly for people to elevate this movie to some sort of breathtaking experience of philosophical and spiritual significance is really surprising. either we have lost perspective or people just aren't willing or capable of delving into more abstract or complex subject matter. the more I think about this film and the sensation it left lingering in my brain the more I want to compare it to a lush Disney movie for adults.

there are just too many cooky moments of ridiculousness and characters all over the place for me to take this film seriously. the car chase scene with Halle Berry's reporter character, the genetically engineered lady's cheesy love scene, all the forced make up on the actors to link these characters together. I cannot even imagine what it all looked like BEFORE hitting the editing room. this makes me want to read the book because the foundation and creativity for these stories is clearly artful, and kudos for trying so hard to bring them all to life. hollywood can and does make big fancy but thought provoking and intelligent films. Inception comes to mind or even something whimsical like Stranger than Fiction and I Heart Huckabees. movies like Cloud Atlas get lost in themselves and to me, I cannot say I was moved to any spiritual or humanistic realm. as for Buddhism, maybe if you teach a high school level English course and want to dissect various themes this would be great fare for that. as a thinking and emotionally attuned adult this was not so great.",1371600000,,1680,4.733788395904437
5267092,5,B0095HHM78,"As the title noted, and recognizing that 2.5 hours is roughly 8 times the focused attention span of humans, I really think the trio of directors, cast and crew did a rather outstanding job of pulling together the novel's complex of six story lines, without losing sight of the books underlying purpose to suggest a rather disastrous ultimate outcome from the past several hundred years' unbridled economic, technological and political trends.

I do have a few minor complaints regarding comparison with the book, specifically (1) I thought the resolution on another planet, which was at most implied in the book, yet ended the movie, was useful for video closure, but not necessary from a narrative perspective; (2) I realize that the Sonmi 451 narrative line was shortened, but I really think they made the chase scenes a bit extreme - admittedly, chase scenes in novels are not as useful as they are in movies, and (3) they left out a large part of the book's middle chase scene with the Kona after Zachry & Meronym (it was the middle, because the Zachry/Meronym chapter was number six of 11 - the book being written like a suite).

I thought the Cavendish story line was very well done, as were most of the others.

I do, however, recommend that everyone read the book. It is, without doubt, one of the best and most interesting that this international literature major ever read.",1371600000,2,1383,4.7782426778242675

This movie is very much the same but this is where any similarity ends. The difference I believe that lent to the overall cohesiveness was a message running just below the surface which prevented it from appearing to be chopped here and inserted there.

Many complained about not understanding what was being said and admittedly, I suffered this same dilemma at first. After listening for a short while I was able to understand what was being spoken and surprisingly, portions even sounded Creole. Once I ""adjusted"" my ears, so to speak, I had no problem following what was being relayed.  My suggestion is to step back and relax. Do not (but do) get caught up in the kaleidoscope of characters, the cinematography, and timelines.  This is a film that must be viewed more with your heart than with your mind and eyes. It's the caring and the connections people can experience with one another without having to know the ""why"".  What brought it together and tied this film ""together"" in a neat package was this underlying theme that ran throughout its entirety and was touchingly defined by Somni during her interview. If there ever was a time to say I was wowed, it's now.

This movie is quite frankly, one of the finest expeditions into cinematography I have had the pleasure of experiencing. The depth and versatility of the cast was phenomenal and the script was even more so. Cloud Atlas will not appeal to some but it sure touched my heart and for the entire length of the film I was not bored one iota.

The pacing of the film works on so many levels and I find it fascinating how six such fundamentally different stories (historical drama, tragedy, suspense thriller, comedy, sci-fi, and post apocalyptic adventure) are interwoven and connected to evoke and develop the recurring themes.  The cast is uniformly outstanding - several could have been nominated for Oscars in both leading and supporting roles in the same movie!

Loved how the movie jumped between the past, present and future with intertwining plot lines and overarching stories and how the same actors appeared in multiple roles and as various races and nationalities.  Kind of reminded me of The Matrix, which was funny because Hugo Weaving, played multiple villains in this movie.

Very impressed with how this film covers such big topics as slavery, women's rights, homophobia, etc., without being overly preachy.

Favorite line: ""What is an ocean but a multitude of drops?"" Beautiful!

P.S.  Not seeing any problem with the fact that several White actors played roles as Asians, or that Doona Bae played the role of a White Southerner.  People not being fixed to time or race is the whole point of this movie.",1371340800,2,824,4.801418439716312

I will say that I was not familiar with the novel prior to watching this movie so I cant judge whether the movie did the book justice.  I was intrigued with the theme of the film with its mixture of lives interwoven in the fabric of time.  After watching this movie for 3 hours, (Yes it is a long one), I will say that the movie has a very complex storyline and I could see why theatergoers had a difficult time with it.  I think I gained a better understanding watching comfortably at home trying to grasp the concepts in this than I would have been at the theater.  Cloud Atlas reminds me quite a bit of Crash or Traffic in its theme of inter-relatedness.

I will say that I was impressed at the multiple roles that Hanks, Berry and others played throughout the movie.  The makeup was so outstanding at times that I didn't recognize who they were until the end credits played.  I thought some of the stories within the movie played better than others and were more entertaining at times to the extent that some of these could have been movies on there own.

The movie was done well however, I think could have been weaved together a bit more smoothly for people like me that aren't familiar with the book.  This movie is very complex and can be difficult to follow at times especially if you aren't familiar with the backstory.  I also thought Crash especially did a bit better job with the type of concept that Cloud Atlas does.  That doesn't mean I didn't enjoy Cloud Atlas.  After the movie finished, it provided great conversation on what the movie said to you and even though the movie had some flaws, I found it to be enjoyable and entertaining 3 and half star movie.",1371340800,5,1904,4.421203438395415

5267230,5,B0095HHM78,"This movie is so much more than a sci-fi love story as the critics have so termed it. So many topics are tackled in the book, the misconception that humanity progresses steadily towards greater good and that technology will lead to prosperity for all. There are some interesting Foucaultian ideas of power and agency and how power can arise in the most unexpected places, not only in the hands of the powerful.

There is a scene in the book which is lacking from the movie where Sonmi and Hae Joo take refuge in an ancient Buddhist Monastery in the country side, it is a beautiful moment of clarity where Sonmi gets a breath of fresh air from the hell that endless hunger and consumption and human predacity has created in corporotocracy. themes of action and consequences are strong through out this book/movie. It makes one think on how the choices we make impact those around us and our future.

I see the 4 Dhamma (Dharma) summaries as taught by the historical Buddha in the Nikayas/Agamas resonate throughout this book:

1. Upanyati loko,
The world is swept away.

Addhuvo.
It does not endure.

2. Ato loko,
The world offers no shelter.

Anabhissaro.
There is no one in charge.

3. Assako loko,
The world has nothing of its own.

Sabba pahya gamanya.
One has to pass on
leaving everything behind.

4. no loko,
The world is insufficient,

Atitto,
insatiable,

Tah dso.
a slave to craving.

If this movie has sparked an interest in Buddhism for you I recommend ""In The Buddha's Words"" by Bhikkhu Bodhi. Its an excellent place to start to understand what the historical Buddha taught.

It is really an excellent and unusual film with beautiful cinematography, great CGI, especially in the future time frames, and a very moving message.

I guess that only older souls, if you will, would appreciate the vision embedded in the movie. That is probably the design of the Universe.

Many of us spend our life time focusing only on our physical aspect of existence, without realizing our bodies are simply shells for our souls/spirits to act in this giant stage of life, and to acquire the knowledge, self-knowledge, and experience. We are all connected in the sense that we each are single drop of water in the vast ocean yet we together are the ocean.

If we can all live our life, which is just one chapter of a never-ending play, with the perspective penetrating far back to the past and forward into the future, then maybe we will extend more kindness to our fellow droplets during the trying times, and maybe we will manifest more courage when we confront the seemingly all-powerful dark forces, knowing we are as powerful as we conceive of we are.",1371340800,2,1036,4.619565217391305
5267236,4,B0095HHM78,"We saw this movie in theaters and loved it.  I love it more than the book.
I gave the dvd copy to my mom, she was engrossed.  The disk played well.

My husband and I watched the Blu-ray copy today.  The sound did not play properly at first.
Hubby dug into the settings in the menu of the disk and discovered that the English version of this on the Blu-ray was set up only as Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound.

The French and Spanish versions on the disk offered Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound OR Stereo, so when we chose Stereo French it played and sounded great!

He was able to use the menu settings on our Blu-ray player to tell that machine to down-mix the Dolby 5.1 input to play properly through our speakers.  I'm lucky I have a tech-savy, patient guy to figure this out, because I would have been frustrated and baffled.

Anyways, once he figured out the sound work-around, all was well.  I do recommend this movie very very highly!  You will be amazed when you watch the credits and see how the same actors played so many roles with outstanding makeup, wig, and costume variations.

8536145,4,B0095HHM78,"In 1849, American lawyer Adam Ewing thinks hes being treated for an intestinal worm, but hes actually being poisoned by his doctor so that the latter can steal his riches. In 1936, English composer Robert Frobisher helps Vyvyan Ayers write a piano piece called The Cloud Atlas. In 1973, journalist Luisa Rey hopes to uncover a plot involving corrupt nuclear energy advocates. In 2012, Scottish publisher Tim Cavendish is committed to a retirement home and subjected to abuse during his stay. In 2144, South Korea has become a dystopian autocracy that robotic waitress Somni must find individuality in. In post-apocalyptic Hawaii, a tribal society struggles for survival when they're constantly attacked by cannibalistic barbarians. Every one of these separate stories comes together to create themes of reincarnation and juxtaposition. The trick to watching this movie is finding that common thread.

As much as I loved the creative way in which these stories were connected, it does lend itself to confusing storytelling at times. While forcing an audience to think deeply is what all good movies should aspire to do, sometimes piecing together those puzzles right in the middle of viewing can take away from the overall experience. Perhaps this movie was always meant to be watched multiple times. All you have to do is consider the directors and what their legacies bring to the table. The Wachowskis are champions of Gnosticism, which makes the themes of interconnection and reincarnation that much more apparent. But at the same time, I can see how the chaos and confusion might force a watcher to turn away. I stayed throughout the whole thing and enjoyed it to pieces, so this is only a minor complaint on my part.

One of my favorite mini-stories in this movie is the dystopian tale in South Korea. With our current politics all across the globe, themes of dystopia are more important now than they ever were. Through Somnis individuality and sacrifices, we as an audience are taught to question everything around us and never submit to brainwashing no matter how much violence is piled on against us. Our minds are the last safe haven we have when it comes to being ourselves. When we lose that, we lose everything. Id rather live dangerously and be myself than live safely and be a clone. Or to put it in the words of a famous metal band from the 2000s, I choose death before dishonor. Id rather die than live down on my knees. Is it any wonder that Somni was worshiped so much in the Hawaiian apocalypse story?

The other favorite story of mine was Tim Cavendishs nursing home fiasco. Tim can be described as an eccentric old man with more creativity in one of his farts than most people have in their whole bodies. Thats why its important for him to escape that dreadful nursing home so that he can become the imaginative author he was always meant to be. Of all the characters in this movie, Tim is easily my favorite to root for. Hes foul-mouthed, hes delightfully Scottish, and hes not afraid to express himself despite the conformist nature of his environment. In many ways, the nursing home is a lot like dystopian South Korea, and no, thats not hyperbole. If Tim can stand up to that oppressive place, whos to say others cant learn something from his individuality?

The lessons in individuality and the craftily connected timeline are what make Cloud Atlas a modern day classic. Its not perfect and probably does need to be watched more than once, but its still enjoyable and itll still blow your mind. Another notch in the Wachowskis belts, another excellent decision when they partnered with the legendary Tom Tykwer. Just like the timeline of events, the stars aligned perfectly to bring the audience a movie they can love. How does a passing grade sound to everybody?",1530403200,,3790,4.844135802469136
