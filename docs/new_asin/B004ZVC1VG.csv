8450458,5,B004ZVC1VG,"One of the best period murder mystery detective series I've ever seen. The attention to detail to realistically portray life in Victorian England, I've never seen better. The slow pace of the story matches the slow pace of life in these times, but it never ceases to be intriguing. You really appreciate how difficult it was to solve crimes before the days of fingerprints, blood analysis and DNA. How differently people interacted is well portrayed by the actors. I loved it, brilliant.",1500249600,,487,4.951219512195122
8450459,4,B004ZVC1VG,"The first disc is based on the Kate Summerscale book of the same name and the additional discs expand upon the character of the detective.  I loved the book but I don't think the disc based on the book was long enough to create the same effect. However, I do like where they are going with the Mr. Whicher character and hope they produce more episodes in the future.  Also, Mr. Whicher is played by Paddy Considine, who does a great job. Peter Capaldi is only on the first disc. BTW, the disc arrived safely and sooner than expected.",1469318400,,533,4.373737373737374

8450463,5,B004ZVC1VG,"A gripping true story. Mr Whicher was the inspiration for the detective in Wilkie Collins' The Moonstone, the first English detective novel. Having said that, if you're interested in seeing this, Amazon's UK site sells it for $13, including shipping. The sellers on this Amazon site are betting you don't know that and are willing to spend over twice that price.",1365724800,11,362,4.950819672131147
8450464,3,B004ZVC1VG,"The reviews here seem mixed, so I want to chime in and say READ THE BOOK.  It is a fantastic book, well-researched and really delves into the start of detective work as a career (Mr Whicher was one of the first ever detectives), motivations and crime, and life in Victorian England.  It is not my usual sort of book (I usually read fiction) but I was given it as a gift and I just loved it!  Highly recommend.

8450465,3,B004ZVC1VG,"The Suspicions of Mr Whicher is at best a sedate country house murder mystery. However at times, I am inclined to describe the pace of the mystery much like a slow burning candle over a 1 hour and 40 minutes. Thomas Godfrey in his 1990 compendium of English Country House Murders defines an English Country House Murder as following these rules:

1. Set in a English Country House - Road Hill House now Langham House
2.  Involving a crime - murder of a child
3. The crime is puzzling - motive is not understood
4. The murderer is not obvious - owing to lack of motive
5. Deduction of murderer requires a high level of reasoning ability - Wicher is brought in from Scotland Yard

The television like movie straddles a documentary and mystery ticking all these rules in the form of Kate Summerscale's well known novel of a real murder mystery set in Victorian Wiltshire England, the Road Hill House murder of 1860.  In this murder a 3 year old, Saville Kent is abducted from a cot and murdered gruesomely in the outhouse. The shadowy father a country gent is ideally cast as Peter Capaldi and is really not a country gent but an inspector of factories. Paddy Considine plays Inspector Whicher impeccably in the same vein as Peter Falk's portrayal of Detective Columbo just in a different time and place. On at least one occasion the camera follows the inspector out of the courtroom to reveal an emotionless Considine as he and camera boards the horse and cart highlighting the period setting of the movie and meticulous detailing required by such a period piece.
The murder was a cause clbre as up until this hideous crime murderers were assumed to roam the city streets not country houses. The movie relays the outrage by covering the backdrop of the story to include question time in the House of Commons and the home secretary intervention by assigning a detective from Scotland Yard to take over the investigation from the local constabulary.
Considine is no Poirot although he supports a bowler hat. This is a good thing and stays true to the film as a one off period piece not just trying to grab viewers cheaply as mimicking a Poirot crime story.",1356480000,3,2152,4.640419947506562
8450466,4,B004ZVC1VG,"Probably, you shouldn't be surprised when a small child's brutal murder is depressing, but I wasn't quite ready for how profoundly sad this story would be. In case you're expecting your usual murder mystery, beware - despite the costumes, this one feels extremely real and very disturbing.  The cast, featuring Peter Capaldi, adds to the realism with stunning performances. Well done.",1346803200,2,384,5.295081967213115
