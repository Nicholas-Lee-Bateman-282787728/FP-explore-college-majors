8425459,5,B004DK5E8G,"As with all of Barbara Stanwyck film's worth buying. One of her early movies with all the charm of young Missy being a girl with her feet firmly planted on the ground but wanting the man of her dreams to come along. Barbara plays against Gene Raymond, her man in this sweet movie with oodles of chemistry. She is meltingly lovely as usual as Shelby Barrett, and I am firmly on her side right from her first appearance. You might of guessed that I am a fan of this fascinating lady, then saying that I am not blind to the worst of the scripts she has been forced to endured in her long career. Woman in Red is little known but not one of those later less than perfect movies she appeared in.",1447200000,,690,4.195488721804511
8425460,5,B004DK5E8G,"Stanwyck never disappoints.  So many young actresses of her generation over act and  are a chore to watch. Stanwyck was the highest quality in her day, and always gave a realistic portrayal of what ever character she was given. I can only imagine it must have been a joy to work with her.
 Was there anything this woman couldn't do? I seriously doubt it. It makes one want to weep to think of the poor quality we have of actresses these days, with a few exceptions (Halle Berry, Glenn Close, to name a few).
Many of these actresses today call themselves stars, but  they are seriously lacking when you compare them to a true  STAR, like Barbara Stanwyck. She shines!",1407456000,3,666,4.516666666666667
8425461,5,B004DK5E8G,Barbara Stanwyck is one of those rare cretures that just cannot seem to be decribed in just a few words.  She embodies what a comsumate actress and artist are and yet never won an Acedemy Award (nominated four times).  She did get an honorary Oscar in 1982 for her body of work.  Stanwyck will always be a true Hollywood legend.  It is wonderful that this great film is now on DVD and can be enjoyed for generations to come.  Miss Stanwyck...you will live on forever through your work!!!,1375660800,5,487,4.488636363636363
8425462,4,B004DK5E8G,"No Star packed more wallop, more projected strength of character, and beauty, than did the young Miss Stanwyck, as she was billed in her early thirties films. She grew to be one of the brightest of Hollywood's females in her later years, but it was in her younger period that every necessary element for highly dynamic performances showed in her every appearance. This 1935 trifle, without her, would have been just another talented young woman marries aristocratic but poor young man film, were nearly any other young actress to have taken the role. Though the plot creaks, the big scene pure melodrama, she makes a small picture big.
Gene Raymond is his usual unremarkable but serviceable self, the other featured players are at about the same level of skill and presence, with Arthur Treacher, the exception, as an amusing bore in his brief supporting role; but, Genevieve Tobin, shines as The Other Woman. Her hard edged, cynical presence, strikes sparks in every scene and, as a vis-a-vis to Stanwyck, helps make both all the better.
That this is quite well worth the hour it takes to view it, is almost entirely due to the work of these two strong women.",1346889600,11,1160,4.805
