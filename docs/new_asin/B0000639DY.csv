1689137,5,B0000639DY,"Each of Steed's ladies made their own mark.  But Really!  Mother really takes the cake! Honor Blackman's Kathy Gale, set the pace. Sleek sassy women, who were as smart as they were sexy. They held their own in a man's world and didn't need someone to take care of them. Blackman and Rigg were two very positive role models in a time when most women were victims, wives or secretaries on telly at the time. Blackman made less of an impact in US, because they were generally shown as a Summer Replacement, to keep people from seeing reruns. Since they were run on ABC, tried to be recognized as a big-boy network the old Black and White Gales were not widely scene.

Rigg came along and made Emma Peel a character that will go down in the hall of fame. She is as popular today, if not more so. So when she left--to do as Blackman did -- go on to be a Bond girl, Steed had to have another partner. Enter Tara King. She gorgeous full figure Canadian with eyes to do for. They tried to play on her more feminine side (and with horrid fashions). Seriously, the clothes designers for Tara needs shooting. For the most part, they couldn't design more dumpy look clothes. They stuffed her in a series of wigs - some very bad - so point one, she was fighting an uphill battle. Also, the scripts were not as sharp. Even so Tara is charming and a pleasure to watch.

Invasion of the Earthman

Killer

7958951,5,B0000639DY,"I watched the Avengers many times when it used to be free and before the recession put a price on nearly everything.  The colors are as beautiful as any I've seen and the color schemes in the homes are fabulous.  The English used more vivid colors in their homes and their landscapes were out of this world.  The cars are really great, especially the interiors of the more expensive models with lots of chrome and real wood.  I hope they haven't become ugly, stiff & hard riding boxes like ours are now.  Steed is a really great looking guy, reminiscent of the days when people took pride in their appearance.  The female lead, Thorson, is as great looking as can be and much more believable than the old Emma Peel.  Emma Peel could send big, heavy men flying through the air with a flick of her hand, as phony as phony could be.  Thorson made her fights look believeable.  Besides being gorgeous, she was big enough to make her fights look believable.  It is sad that she only had a two year run with the Avengers.  In todays entertainment where the biggest actors are the biggest, foulest mouthed slobs, the older programs are indeed refreshing",1352764800,2,1146,4.541463414634146
7958952,3,B0000639DY,"I LIKED THIS SET VERY MUCH, BUT WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT A FEW OF MY FAVORITES WEREN'T INCLUDED. WHY NOT HAVE A ""COMPLETE TARA KING MEGASET"", LIKE THE ONE FOR EMMA PEEL? I TRUST THIS WOULD COST CONSIDERABLY LESS THAN THE ABSURD $200+ PRICETAG FOR EMMA PEEL.

AND WHILE I'M ON THE SUBJECT, WHY NOT FEATURE MORE EMMA PEEL AT REASONABLE PRICES AND MUCH, MUCH LESS OF THOSE HONOR BLACKMAN ATROCITIES.",1267142400,3,393,4.614285714285714
7958953,5,B0000639DY,"Prior to 1967, ""The Avengers"" was yielded in black-and-white. Going to color was a definite improvement; however in 1968 there were three additional significant changes:

1. Mrs. Peel (Diana Rigg) was traded out for Steed's new partner, Tara King (Linda Thorson).

2. The producers asserted that the 1968 episodes were more [paraphrasing] ""believable"" -- in fact, just the opposite is true. The '68 episodes are more bizarre than ever, but still very good.

3. There is more involvement by Steed's boss, ""Mother"" (a wheelchair-bound chubby guy who shows up in very strange places to discuss Steed's progress on respective cases).

This DVD package, (2 DVDs, individually cased and further packaged in an attractive cardboard box, this ""Set No. 3"" color-coded GREEN), is the third of FIVE sets for the 1968 episodes. The marketing of ""The Avengers"" can be quite confusing so I wanted to get that information out up front. This is also the BEST way to buy the DVDs (by the ""set"" rather than by the ""volume"") for any season, from 1963 through 1968.

Patrick Macnee shrewdly plays John Steed, England's gentleman undercover agent. Linda Thorson is one of several of a line of Steed's voluptuous sidekicks. In the U.S., most of us didn't even know about Honor Blackman and Macnee's other (earlier) partners until years later when these episodes finally emerged on VHS tape. Diana Rigg can probably claim about 60% of the credit for the vast number of U.S. audience members who were glued to their TVs when ""The Avengers"" finally hit here. The other 40% (not forgetting Macnee's fine performances) had to do with the presentation of this excellent series.

Starting in 1965, with Rigg, the filmscore was notably updated and played more prominently throughout the story, enhancing the action and suspense. Also, the action itself was boosted. There was never a dull moment with Steed and Mrs. Peel. And these episodes were all FUN -- one embraced a sense that Macnee and Rigg were having a great time in making these films. Now that I've seen episodes from ""The Avengers'"" earlier years, ('63 and '64), I can see that they dragged quite a bit during that earlier era and were much more soap opera-ish. The fun continued throughout the final year, 1968, even though Linda Thorson was simply never quite as dynamic or as sexy as Diana Rigg. The '68 filmscore and title scenes at the beginning and the conclusion of each episode were spiffed up a bit too.

Each of these 52-minute episodes is futuristic (at least for the period) and on the cutting edge of excellent television productions. I know of no series, ""The Original Star Trek Series"" excepted, which has remained as timeless as ""The Avengers"". You'll encounter, in the 1968 episodes, every nemesis ranging from Eastern spies posing as murderous British Army officers to equally murderous hotel desk clerks.

In the 1968 Set No. 3 (which includes Vols. 5 and 6), we're talking about six very enjoyable, action-packed, color episodes:

Volume 5:

""The Interrogators"" - Agents are called in for crash courses in interrogation - but their contacts are disappearing. Christopher Lee (of Hammer Horror Films fame) guest stars in this fine entry.

""The Rotters"" - A murder spree hits the timber industry and it is up to Steed and Tara to nail down the unlikely villains.

""Invasion of the Earthmen"" -- Following the death of a fellow agent, Steed and Tara uncover a plot to conquer space and come face to face with their worst fears.

Volume 6:

""Killer"" - Dead agents are piling up in a graveyard so Steed works with the Lady Diana Forbes-Blakeney to expose the secret at the heart of the murder spree (Tara goes off on vacation).

""The Morning After"" - When Steed and a comical traitorous agent wake up to a plot to detonate a nuclear bomb in an English village, the former enemies work together to prevent a catastrophe. Tara pretty much sleeps through this one.

""The Curious Case of the Countless Clues"" - Pursuing a band of callous criminals, Steed suddenly finds the tables turned when the killers target Tara.

The storylines of the various ""The Avengers"" episodes seem absurd to varying degrees as we view them today - but 1968 continued to escalate the absurdity beyond the previous years' entries. This did not diminish my enthusiasm for the ""The Avengers"" because the overall series always manifested a ""Batman"" (TV series) tongue-and-cheekness about it. I mention this only to prepare viewers for this actuality.

The casting in all episodes is spot-on, punctuated with the very best sets and scenic locations. And Linda Thorson's astounding beauty (tenoned with her great figure!) really accentuates the `60s look in her mod attire.

I'll be reviewing all of the 1968 sets, (as I mentioned earlier, there are five in all, with 2 ""volumes"" per set), so be on the watch for my comments regarding the other sets at their appropriate sites on Amazon. In the meantime, while not exactly as marvelous as the 1967 episodes, this particular set still garners my highest recommendation!",1222128000,8,5034,4.922077922077922
