RACKET SQUAD came in on the heels of the legendary DRAGNET.
REED HADLEY is the star of this series and portrays Captain Braddock, head of a special squad of officers who help out victims of swindlers and fast money handlers.
The situations in this show comes from authentic police files and records.
I have all 5 in this series. Alpha Video is great and on some of these shows have the original PHILIP MORRIS cigarette commercials which is great!
Any fan of 1950's crime dramas will definitely enjoy this wonderful show!
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1246838400,2,550,4.861702127659575
