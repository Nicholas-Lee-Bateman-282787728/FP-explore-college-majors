7473334,5,B016JB0JWC,"hahahahah.  Great movie.  I've watched it over a dozen times and really wish the story line would continue in another movie.  I'm not a big fan of television series because of the commercials and time slot issues, but if they made another movie, I would buy it.

I really cannot say much about the movie without spoiling it but the brevity of the character's interactions with the world were surprising and enjoyable.  The LOL moments were consistent through the whole movie and the female lead reacted in a believable way.  When he remarked, ""I thought you were leaving,"" and she replied, ""I NEEDED A MINUTE!""  hahaha.  Good stuff.",1500422400,,632,4.787037037037037

7473353,5,B016JB0JWC,"I loved this movie.....very dark but hilarious, both at the same time. A perfect role for Henry Rollins. A must see ...especially for Rollins fans. If you like to see bad guys get whats coming to them, you will love this. Henry Rollins stars as Jack..a quiet loner and reluctant hero and much more. I won't give away the secret of his true identity....you will have to buy it to find that out...i guarantee you that you won't be sorry.",1488326400,,435,4.45
7473354,3,B016JB0JWC,Not great and a bit confusing. The daughter seemed awkwardly cast and even Steven Ogg couldn't save the film. Entertaining I suppose butnot something I would watch again.,1485907200,,170,5.107142857142857
7473355,5,B016JB0JWC,"It can be very hard to get the right balance for a likable super hero. You need him to be somehow able to stand up to amazing odds and thrill with magnificent feats of daring. At the same time, they have to be relatable. They have to have some way that they could lose, so that the fighting means something. Henry Rollinss character, Jack, strikes that balance perfectly in the new film He Never Died. (Thats right, there are new films out that are not Episode VII.) This movie is dark and gritty, but once again, it has a great sense of balance. There are likable characters that make you happy to see them and concerned about their situation. It feels like early Quentin Tarantino with a supernatural twist.

Now before I go on, I will get into information that is revealed in the trailer, but seems like a spoiler to me. Ill say, if you like cool guys, being awesome, and over-the-top characters with over-the-top violence played with a respect that brings inevitability to the whole thing, then you should just stop here and check out this film.

If you want more information (and there is a lot of research to say that spoilers do not take away enjoyment, but who knows) I will go on with actual analysis of the film. Jack lives alone in a crappy apartment. He sleeps a lot, but is haunted by sounds of terror. He finds refuge in a local church by playing a very focused game of Bingo. With healing powers, a likably gruff exterior and smarts that seem to trap him in his own thoughts, he is a beautiful blend of Old Man Wolverine, and Sheldon Cooper from The Big Bang Theory.

He is tangentially involved with illegal activities, but its more that he keeps to himself. So he doesnt care what anyone else is doing, and he doesnt pay attention to his associates. As layers are stripped away, you we learn about his life and powers. Currently, the thing that most looks like a relationship in his life is his ordering from the same diner waitress, who has an obvious tenderness for him. His last actual relationship was 19 years ago, and he has just found out that he has a daughter.

He_Never_Died_regarding_Henry[1]

Finding quickly that you cannot really hurt a man who can regenerate, the bad guys quickly move to kidnapping. Jack can easily destroy the enemy, but his struggle is against caring. He goes to the diner daily, and he refuses to see the kind woman who cares for him. He goes to a church daily and plays a game thats value is that he can ignore those around him.

So whats going on with Jack? He is actually Cain, the Biblical son of Adam and Eve, who killed his brother Able. Cain was cursed by God to wander but given a mark that would not allow others to kill him, but visit the assailants evil back on him seven times over. The way this plays out in the movie version of the character is that he is this worlds only true vampire. Not only will nothing kill him, but he is willing to eat anyone who threatens him.

This is the kind of story I love. The situations are super weird and the characters are hyper cartoony, but there is a true humanity to the entire thing that makes you like everyone. The film quickly makes you invested, and you want to see things work out for Jack, his daughter and his waitress.

he-never-died-8[1]

There is a fabulous sequence when Jack has fallen off the wagon and is eating people again. He walks angrily through town dealing with his hunger. He runs into, of all things, the kindness of humanity. People who check on him, apologize for bumping into him and return money he dropped. At this point you are learning that he only retaliates, but that knowledge comes when you fear that oh no, this guy is going to get it! But that is oddly resolved into a sadness for the character, whose thirst for blood and violence causes him to simply be disappointed by the kindness of others not giving him the chance to attack.

This is one of those movies that keeps giving you a lot of weird imagery and situations up front, and 1421036_211521212364900_1238380599_o[1]then it takes away curtains that explain the world. You journey along as the woman gets to know Jack and Jack gets to know himself.

Now I would like to warn you again. Im going to another level of spoilers here:

The natural flow of this film, with its inviting characters and exiting weirdness and violence, brings you through to the final confrontation. Its one of those great endings that makes you realize that you and Jack had it all wrong.

The fight was not against an evil man. The fight was against his he-never-died-rollins[1]baser nature. The nature of Cain. If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must rule over it. (God to Cain in Genesis 4:7).

This line is not in the movie, but it is the theme of the film. Jack/Cain has lived thousands of lifetimes, abstaining from violence for his own good and then giving into his own bloodlust for the comfort of his own desires. As he looks down at the broken body of a man who deserves to die, he must confront himself, he must confront God and he must choose his desire for blood or to do what is right.

This was a fun movie. The acting was spot on, and the writing was smart. It felt and looked cool at all times. But despite being very bloody and grimy, dark and brooding, it did not take the easy ways out of nihilism or preachy optimism. Its not bullied into spelling everything out for you, but doesnt hand you the egotistical film student what do you think happened ending either. It gives you enough to put all the story points together into a satisfying cohesion that feels encouraging and rises out of the abyss by the end.",1485302400,,5720,4.439466158245948

This appears to fall into the category of ""religious comic book films"", although whether it ever was a comic book is unknown to me.
It is most similar, however, to the execrable /Dredd/: it basically tells about one incident in an endless series of incidents, which is of no particular importance and certainly of no significance.
Perhaps that's part of the problem: it falls into a genre I don't particularly like.",1473724800,,562,4.744897959183674

I liked the comedic actions of Rollins character, Jack.  It is sort of a dry and dark humor but I got it.  It was pretty awesome.  Booboo Stewart is very good in his role as well as Jordan Todosey and Kate Greenhouse.  I think we will be seeing more of these young ladies.  At least we should anyway.

The personality of this character is mostly fleshed out in the brooding silence of Jack and the most excellent script that supported Rollins' psychic interpretation.  The guy's believable, and that's rare.  Plenty of muscling and killing.  Grim humor that works more than I'm willing to admit.  Viewed this film for free at Netflix, but it's worth a $6.99 rental here at Amazon. 2nd viewing was less fresh and some issues bothered, but the film's still got impact.  The writing, this time, wasn't as good and the acting was more easily seen as the core of the entertainment offered.  The titillation of the super power was still there as a running gag kinda mystery. I won't want to watch this again until about 2018, June-ish.

7473437,4,B016JB0JWC,"I struggle to truly call this horror, rather this feels more like a violent drama featuring a supernatural character.  It lacks any substantial plot or character developmentyet I really enjoyed it!

Written and directed by Jason Krawczyk, this snarky little film delivers Henry Rollins (Feast, Bad Boys 2) exactly as he should be--immortal, gruff and unable to feel pain or emotions.  Rollins plays Jack, a no nonsense man of few words, simple means, and a solid respect for privacy.  He keeps to himself and leaves his simplistically unfestive apartment for little more than church bingo, his favorite diner or to meet a hospital intern (Booboo Stewart; X-Men: Days of Future Past) for an illegal exchange of sorts.

Somehow Jack crosses paths with some screw-up criminals who find out the hard way that Jack is not the man to cross.  And when you cross him, his temper is short and consequences are grave.

A nice slow throat rip, a dash of cannibalism and a few well-handled punches to the face add a unique flavor to this very dark comedy which presents itself surprisingly like an off-Broadway play in terms of atmosphere and delivery.

Jack is like an occasionally kind sociopath trying to (quite successfully) fend off any vestige of human emotion that may well up inside him while likewise staving back a strange macabre compulsion from a deep and distant, perhaps Biblical past.  At one point Jack rather audibly removes a bullet from his head--it was a pleasure!

Nothing Oscar-worthy, but I really enjoyed Rollins' depiction of Jack--rendered stolid from centuries of monotonous life.  He has strong aversions to conversation, he answers questions literally and concisely, and does a good job revealing as little as possible about himself.  But I suppose if I had what appear angel wing excision scars, I'd be keeping more than a few secrets myself.  That said, his interactions--few as they may be and always forced upon him--are amusingly awkward.

Despite the deliberate lack of a plot that matters or any form of proper character development, this remains a pretty cool movie.  Highly recommended to indie horror fans, indie movie fans in general or anyone who likes Henry Rollins for any reason.",1462838400,,2211,5.019178082191781

7473455,3,B016JB0JWC,"I really enjoy listening to Henry Rollins speak, he is a very knowledgeable and entertaining speaker. Ive enjoyed his acting in previous movies, and Sons of Anarchy. So I was really looking forward to this movie.

Im happy that I didn't pay a rental fee to see it. Its not the worst movie Ive ever seen (that would be Alexs Apartment), but it has to be in my top ten of worst films. It wasn't the actors that made the film not to my taste, but the story line. There was so much potential to the story, but so much time was wasted watching Henrys character, Jack, lie on his bed, that it didn't have time to live up to its potential.

Jack was depressed, and didn't want to go on living, but he cant die, so thats why he tried to sleep all the time. Okay, I completely understand that, but cutting down on the number of times we see him sleeping, would have allowed more time for story development.

It was about halfway through the movie before we even learn that he has a daughter, and thats when the action finally starts to pick up. We still see him barely going about his day, but watching him play bingo with his daughter, or interacting more with the waitress, had an endearing feel that added a bit more depth to this movie.

The reveal as to why Jack is the way he is, was very interesting, and I wish they would have focused more on that story line. And the scenes with the violence and gore were done well. I didn't feel as if any of them were unnecessary, and I was really amused by the shower scene.

If you like Henry Rollins, you may want to give it a watch, but otherwise, I would say that you should find something else to watch.",1461888000,,1645,4.20952380952381

7473471,5,B016JB0JWC,"I almost missed this film. The poster and stills from the film do not do it justice.

This movie is billed as a dark comedy, however while a number of moments were quite funny, I found it to be a more serious affair. Very character-based, with Henry Rollins doing a fantastic job showing the most minute increments of character development, which is enormously consistent with his character.

Without saying too much---and believe me, you definitely do NOT want to read a spoiler!---Rollins plays a mysterious loner whose only mild pleasures in life are eating at a diner and playing Bingo. In addition to the diner, he has other, less savory appetites that he tries to control with varying degrees of success.

His life is upended when he receives a call from an old lover telling asking him to look for their missing daughter. At first, it seems as though he is completely indifferent to his daughter's well-being, but gradually, he establishes a rudimentary interpersonal connection with her.

He's also forming a connection with a waitress at the diner at which he eats. She clearly has a crush on him, but again he doesn't seem interested.  She's not deterred.

This was a wonderful gem of a film, and I'm so glad I took the time to see it. Like I said, it looked awful from the poster and photos, but man, what a great film. It's one-of-a-kind, something to be treasured.

From what I hear, Rollins is in talks to make a mini series continuation of the story. I have mixed feelings about that. Television is not my favorite medium, and I fear what they may do to this character. However, it's also exciting to hear that more may be coming!",1460851200,,1645,4.651724137931034

7473474,3,B016JB0JWC,"He Never Died is like a quirky, half-formed, horror short story brought to life.  Henry Rollins is excellent, but the movie only hints at facts about his character.  And the violence is rarely choreographed well.  It even gets a bit silly.  The hired goons are comedic relief, like the thieves in Home Alone.  I expected a darker, more serious take on the character.  Especially considering who he really is.  I won't spoil it.  The wings might give you a hint, but not a good one.  Yes, he is Biblical.  No, he is not a fallen angel.

The story was a simple one.  Not that interesting, really.  The most interesting part of the movie--and why I watched till the very end--was Henry's character.  I wanted to know everything about him, about his experiences throughout time, about the mysterious strangers who appear to watch him.  Unfortunately, the film fails to explain anything.  And it ends on such a lame scene that I felt cheated.

Here we have great acting, a great character idea, and very little writing skill.  He Never Died should have been as epic as Dracula--who is mentioned in the film, by the way (Wallachia)--yet it lumbers along with no great aspirations.

We need a remake with Henry Rollins as the same legendary guy, only finding himself in a more epic saga.  After all, this legend is the hero (or villain) of many wars, according to this movie's audio hints.  He should be tasked with handling something much more difficult than rescuing a girl from a D list criminal.

3 stars for Rollins.  Without his performance, maybe 2 stars.",1460505600,2,1555,4.698884758364312

7473478,4,B016JB0JWC,"This on netflix right now, so if you're reading this and thinking about renting it, save your money at the moment, skip my review and watch it for yourself.

If you're reading this and it's no longer on netflix, let's discuss this flick.

""He Never Died"" is a somewhat disjointed tale about a man, out of time, that does a lot of strange things and bears a lot of strange scars and behaviors that are never /really/ fully explained, though they're given some basic substance in the big reveal at the end. Mostly, it's a lot of you enjoying Rollins' interestingly autistic acting throughout the film, which is not his best work, and trying to make sense of all the violence.

There is no doubt the film is entertaining, somewhat, but it's also confusing, and leaves a lot of questions. Now... in order for me to address what I think went on here, I will have to discuss some of the movies important reveals and happenings. There are spoilers below.

The big reveal that ""Jack"" is actually Cain, pulls some things together but only if you're familiar with Enochian and Kabbalic theology. Cain is asserted to be ""an angel"", in his own words ""the last, or only, I don't know"". Some of the works in older Jewish religious books describe fallen angels as cannibals, violent, and capable of incredible amounts of carnage, as well as confused, solemn, withdrawn, yet forever in love with and jealous of humanity. So as Jack craves flesh, the theological assertion would be it is because he, as an angel, requires the life energy of normal/mortal humans to sustain his mortal frame. Honestly, this angle has been played before in fiction, White Wolf publishing (werewolf, vampire, mage, etc) has always been one of my favorite pure fiction reading obsessions due to the fact that their writers are wonderful about digging up actual lore and weaving it into something that is palatable and acceptable to someone who can suspend their belief and let their creativity take the reigns.

In their ""Demon: The Fallen"" books, they actually cover A LOT of Kabbalic material in regards to Angels, both fallen and in grace. All the way to the fact that if you look into the real biblical descriptions of angels, their true forms would be nothing short of monstrous to humans and that is why they adopt the soft faced visages we all know so well. The Christian and Jewish religions are built on incredibly violent bases. This is something that, if you know going in, makes the movie not so insane. I mean, they provide you with the not so subtle inferences Jack is an angel by the way the cover is handled, and the massive scars on his back that look like wings were ripped off of him.

His detachment to human beings, seeing them as largely nothing but tools to achieve his goals, is also explained by this. He may look like us, he may speak our language, he may act like us at times, but he is not one of us, and is forever damned. They also never make much of an attempt to explain the older gentleman who constantly appears wherever Jack is. My wife assumed he was his conscience at first, then thought maybe he was God. It's clear he is the devil, but that throws all of the movie's material out of whack, given that biblically speaking, Lucifer was not concerned with policing his army of fallen, and cares very little for the morality God projected outward. His characterization being that as God's first creation, Lucifer was so close to being a mirror of God itself, he didn't just disagree with God did, he moved against its wishes without hesitation.

I digress.

That is the messiest part really. Jack being a creature damned to eternal semi-immortal sustainment, forever chained to the human beings he essentially wronged by committing the first actual act of murder, as a food source no less, is poetic. When there are no people left to eat, he will rot away with the rest of existence; a realization that I felt like was subtly granted to Jack throughout the film, causing a large part of his ""distance"".

Anyways, there aren't many final lines/speeches like the one Rollins delivers at the end of the film; ""I want you to know, that after I kill you, I'm going to eat you, I don't know why, it's just the way it's always been, but you should know how I'm going to defile you after death."" It's powerful, and right up there with the ""It's the wallet that says"" speech Sam Jackson gives in pulp fiction, when it comes to content, not delivery.

7473506,5,B016JB0JWC,"There are hundred-million-dollar movies created routinely, relying on bloated budgets and special effects, that are imminently forgettable.....and then there are low-budget gems like this that rely on the talent of the screenwriter, director, and actors to create a strong and lasting impression on the viewer. I consider this to be the best black comedy-horror movie I have seen since Freeway, and am willing to bet that it achieves cult movie status, if not a spin-off series.

Other reviewers have discussed the plot details, but my focus is on the cleverly written script and the creation of a thoroughly unique lead character, whose deadpan delivery and bizarre personality actually make it possible to develop a strong, empathetic connection with a violent, murderous cannibal. Jack says very little, but when he does speak, generally in verbal ""shorthand"", it's always to the point (literally) and evocative of shudders, laughter, or a strange combination of both. He has very few redeeming virtues, other than a strong sense of right and wrong that somehow includes munching on severed fingers and wreaking havoc on those who cross him, yet through it all, you really come to care about him and his plight. This is not an easy task for a screenwriter, director, and actor.....and testimony to the skill of all involved.

In conclusion, some (if not most) recent movies tend to rely upon CGI, over-exposed ""actors"", huge production costs, and minimal plot or character development to rake in a profit at the box office. Like the Wizard in Oz, they put on a flamboyant show....but there is literally nothing behind the curtain. He Never Died is just the opposite. The ultra-low-key protagonist is deceptively drab, until, from time to time we get a glimpse behind the curtain.....and experience that which no amount of visual flash or mountains of money can convey.",1459296000,,1871,5.131147540983607

7473510,3,B016JB0JWC,I think the main actor is pretty good kind of weird and off the wall. I am not sure if this is suppose to be a a dash of comedy or what.

It does keep your attention to follow the events and learn the true identity of a person most will remember from the Old Testament. Won't spoil who he is but it does show he has compassion even though he was condemned to walk the earth forever for his previous misdeed. Movie starts out kind of slow and not building too much on the protagonist but eventually starts to pick up speed and will stay mostly on track until the ending. Not any side stories so the story his not left open anywhere which is good for this movie. Having Amazon Prime allows me to see movies that were never main streamed and some are decent enough that they could have been shown on the big screen.  This is a sleeper that if you look past the budget and a couple of (short lived characters) not so good actors the director did a good job of  pulling the train out of the station slow then picking up speed further down the track.",1459209600,,975,4.293478260869565

My personal pet peeve is with movies about aliens who always act as if they are just humans in alien suits. (This movie is not about an alien, quite ...)

So I really appreciate a performance that clearly expresses that a character does not share normal emotions and does not act from normal motivations. And the movie doesn't start out with an explanatory backstory. It just lets the viewer experience Henry Rollins' character as the people around him do, albeit we get to see everything. Gradually things fall into clearer focus.

But even the ending where the character tries to explain himself doesn't actually explain everything ...

Really great speculative fiction, whether it's classified as science fiction or fantasy, poses interesting questions but doesn't smugly make arbitrary pronouncements about ultimate Truth.

This movie may seem a little vague because it doesn't pretend to know the Answers ...

How would you feel if you could never die? How long would it take for you to go crazy? And how long would you actually *stay* crazy?

This movie is certainly not for everybody.  Heck, I'm still wondering if it's for me and I love weird movies and, under normal circumstances, can tolerate Rollins.

By an hour you learn that low life mafia has an issue with him.  He can take an ice pick in the back and a bullet in the forehead at close range.

Some scenes need to be shot around and I really wanted a pay-off (diner fight scene?) but I get it. That stuff costs a ton of money. So they did a good job of shooting around that one and I recognized that and it got my thumbs-up!

Rollins plays some older guy that is grumpy and alone. It is apparent he likes it that way sometimes. His ""daughter shows up, there's some mod stuff, he kind of falls for a waitress. Stuff happens and we get a big reveal about what he actually is. It works out good and is a good story. Nothing too unique but better than most of the stories on film out there.

7473633,3,B016JB0JWC,"Henry Rollins casted as Jack, the oldest man in the world, going as far back as the Bible.  Was he a fallen angel, a vampire perhaps, with cannibal tendencies?  Did he know God?  Rollins dry humor keeps your attention throughout because his character doesn't realize it's being humorous.  Jack seems to have plodded through history in an indifferent way, disgusted and bored with life.  At some point he had mob involvement and their abduction of his unknown daughter sends him on a rampage.  Of course he can't be killed in conventional ways or at all.  This is a dark horror comedy with story, but I think more of Jacks past should have been revealed.  All is we get is some audio from Jacks thoughts of his troubled past, that obviously pisses him off.  The overall cast and acting exceeds the typical horror flick.  The blood and gore is mostly focused on Jack, some of it hilarious.  Give this one a try!",1456358400,,909,4.583850931677019

It is a character driven movie, and that character is Jack, as played by the hulking Henry Rollins. Jack kicks butt but he is no hero in the ordinary sense, or in any sense at all. There is substantial gore in this movie, so beware. With an anticlimactic ending, and some very awkward dialogue, this movie has a pace all its own. We liked it a lot, and laughed along with the not laughing and unsmiling Jack. What is intense pain for the rest of us serves as mere annoyance for Jack, and from this derives much of the dark humor this flick has to offer.",1455926400,,701,4.2781954887218046

Henry Rollins plays the part to perfection, and I really just don't get why it just wasn't released in theaters.

There wasn't any explanation as to why/how the story/character got to this point.  What was different 19 years ago that got this ball rolling?  There is gore, but no more than you find in any 'horror' movie.  After I watched it, I did some searching and it seems this producer/directer is known for dark comedy, but I just became more confused and irritated.  The only amusing part was the main characters reaction when he was interacting with others.  And who's the old guy only Jack can see?  Death?  Reaper?  Satan?  I had no clue.

What was that, by the way? Henry Rollins definitely does a great job portraying someone who is socially inept, somewhat oddly cute, and definitely scary as hell once you realize that he has no compunctions about killing you because you're quite literally nothing to him.

Its really hard to describe, especially keeping it spoiler free. Lets just say this is a enjoyable, slightly absurd movie that satisfies your inner urge for mindless violence. Its not one to watch if you're expecting a deep plot or answers to lifes questions, nor does it have tons of action in it. It is unsettling and has the perfect amount of blood, guts, and gore with some scenes thatll just make you squirm and go Aww, man, thats just

Overall, its worth the rental, and definitely re-watchable. It has a slight biblical tinge, but not enough to be off-putting to the Christian-inclined, at least no more so than the oddball movie Dogma (which I still remember somewhat fondly, even as I profess absolutely no desire to ever watch it again.

It is an indie film, so the remaining cast is mediocre, especially the bad guys.  Although Jack is a real bad guy (or something).  He just happens to be the hero in this movie, but he does like to snack on human flesh and blood.

The worst part of the movie, and it is what lost a star on it, is the mediocrity of the directing.  It just seemed the entire time like it could have been so much more and had much more impact.  Jack is a dark character like Batman, but this movie did not have the budget batman did.

The movie was clearly written for Rollins and he lived into it. If you know much about Rollins this movie is probably a much closer depiction of Rollins the introvert than anything he has done.

The story revolves around Jack, a man who cannot die, who has been around since the bible. He is a man who understands the past because he's lived all of it but is unsettled when he is confronted by a history he didn't know existed, a daughter. You'd expect him to wax sentimental, to do deep soul searching, he does no such thing. He tries to continue his existence with her in his space and is very logical and methodical when she is kidnapped for a crime he didn't commit  or did he?

The awkwardness of interacting with other humans is balanced only by the ruthless and precise violence that he meads out not as justice but simply as part of life. And if you are a fan of violence you'll get your fair share.

And Cannibalism.

Rollins does a fine job in his first starring role as Cain, the One Who Introduced Murder to Earth. He's been at it a long, long time, finds it supremely boring, and wants to get away from it but just can't. The people who find themselves having to get a rise out of him sooner or later regret doing so.

7473833,5,B016JB0JWC,"This movie starts slow but ramps up as Jack slowly gets drawn out of the tightly controlled world that he has created for himself: bingo three times a week; dinner at the diner every day; sleeping a lot, etc.

Jack is tightly-wrapped. He disdains human interaction and speaks in monosyllables. Then he gets a call from a woman out of his past, who wants him to make sure that his daughter - surprise! - gets home safely. This turn of events begins to drag him out his self-contained world. Also, his ""dealer"" - blood supplier - has problems with the local mob, who keep trying to take their issues with the dealer up with Jack.

We see that Jack is incredibly strong and apparently impervious to physical injury, and the start of the movie begins with two vertical scars appearing on Jack's back, but his character is essentially a cypher. Jack clearly has more going on than being a burn-out....and then he starts talking about all the jobs he's held, and it seems that he has a picture of himself as a World War I doughboy. Plus, he has a disturbing habit of eating people's body parts.

I liked the movie.  Henry Rollins (""Jack"") played his role with low energy and earnestness, which makes for an understated humor, until he decides to respond to the efforts to involve him in living. Moreover, by the end, and particularly at the end, when we get answers to the questions that have been posed during the movie, Rollins does a nice job of showing a desperation from a man who doesn't understand the rules he has been forced to play by.",1453507200,6,1539,4.525179856115108

7473840,5,B016JB0JWC,"One of only three movies I finished watching and then immediately watched again to see an entirely different movie. (The other two were The Sixth Sense and The Usual Suspects). This movie stands apart from the other two in that it doesn't have a twist ending; you just come to understand that your assumptions about Jack are all wrong by the end of the movie, and you want to watch it all over again to see it in this new light. An man cursed thousands of years ago with immortality (from the trailer, so not a spoiler: ""How old ARE you?!?"" ""I have no idea. But I'm in the Bible if that means anything..."") starts out bored with his unendable life to the point of abject depression, and he bumbles through the movie utterly clueless about the affairs of mortals surrounding him. By the end of the movie you realize he is *completely* clued in, and his aloof and dismissive behavior are by his own choice and for his own reasons.

A bit of comedy thriller/crime action cleverly conceals what is ultimately a very deeply intellectual movie. Popcorn enthusiasts may find the ending anticlimactic as the big surprise at the end comes as no surprise at all. On the other hand, people who enjoy movies that make you think may find the many unresolved issues delightfully rewarding as the unanswered questions can largely be put together by the viewer after the movie is over--and that's what will make you rewatch the movie just to see Henry Rollins give a perfectly ambiguous performance successfully presenting the first- and second-time viewers with a delightful and satisfying--yet completely different--depiction of both the bumbling and eternally jaded immortal.

7473862,4,B016JB0JWC,"As a theologian I have to give a nod to the uniqueness of this film in how it pulled a concept from the bible and built a clever plot around it. As a synopsis... Jack who is in effect the very person of Cain from the bible who commits the first murder... actually never died and the story revolves around this fact and the nature of his character after being on the earth since shortly after the Garden of Eden was abandoned. His recently identified daughter who is a bit of a rebel that wants to get to know him... enters his life and begins to impress upon him. At the same time he has attracted the attention of a waitress (unbeknownst to him) who obviously is interested in him. These two situations are designed to humanize him at the same time as he is being drawn into a showdown with a local mafia syndicate and the true nature of his character is coming out. The movie has a slow, gritty, raw flavor to it and does not try to grab you with fast paced action or stylistic fight scenes. The few scenes of conflict are stark and bold and bloody and this parallels the whole thrust of the movie which is meant to portray someone that feels he has to kill in an almost animalistic way but is tired of it all. The essence of this is revealed in the end and the movie has an interesting way of reconciling itself. I would have liked to have seen some flashbacks to his past to help you understand where he had been and how he had become like he was but the movie still has other ways of doing this... not the least of which is the continual 'noise' that appears to be in his head. They allude to him having had wings in the advertisement picture but all that we are shown are scars on his back as if he used to have them... which does not make sense biblicaly (if that matters). You also do not get much information on why he has a strange 'nosferatu' thing going on... which adds to the creepiness of his character but leaves you wondering why. Rated R for much blood and gore as well as more f-bombs than the French Airforce... ""He Never Dies"" is entertaining. The story line is basic and the acting will garner no awards but I gave it 4 stars because there were some interesting plot turns and character engagement as well as a general rhythm that was consistent from start to finish.",1452902400,,2289,4.252293577981652

It's a hard film to categorize though, and it probably won't be the film that you expect going in, but that doesn't mean it's any less enjoyable. Quite the opposite. I think going in with zero info was actually beneficial to us. Sometimes dark and brutal, sometimes funny, and sometimes with some horror elements thrown in, the entire thing is anchored by Rollins solid performance of a man who just wants to be left alone, yet because of who he is, is constantly caught in the middle of situations that will test his humanity, or lack thereof. A great film to watch with a crowd, which is how I watched it. Everyone enjoyed it for different reasons.

Essentially he lives as plainly as possible to keep his demons at bay. He clearly has a dark side and the fact that he can't die just adds to his overall proclivity for dealing out death and destruction. The movie is pushed forward by his character ""Jack"" having a 19 year old alcoholic daughter whom Jack never wanted. She gets in trouble one night and slowly ingratiates herself in to his life. This causes Jack to slide back into his old murderous habits in order to save her. The movie has no real resolution it just ends without Jack being able to make any meaningful changes in his life.

It's a basic revenge/rescue plot (John Wick, Taken) only with instead of being a trained assassin he's a mythic immortal being.  The movie itself had a mild Ghost Dog vibe.  Even the biblical Caine as the first vampire is a rip-off from Vampire the masquerade role-playing games (a very popular game that's influenced a lot of the vampire horror genre).  Rollins wasn't really able to lend his patent intensity to the role because the character was so deadpan, and Rollins isn't a good enough actor to pull it off and engage you at the same time.

All in all it's an okay movie.  The only thing special about it is that Rollins is the lead.

The underlying comedy of the movie is what made if for me. I laughed at quite a few points in the movie, with the deadpan way that Rollins delivered his line.

The hints at the backstory they give, give the movie just enough of a kick to make it intriguing.

The violence is not over the top, and Rollins against does a good job in those scenes.

7473965,4,B016JB0JWC,"As a big fan of Henry Rollins, I was really excited to finally see him in a starring role. This movie does not disappoint. If you watch the trailer you get the gist of the movie (immortal cannibal, discovers he has daughter, has to rescue her) and the movie doesn't really deviate or surprise on that front. But, knowing what you're in for really allows you to just enjoy all the subtle (and not so subtle things) in the movie.
Rollins performance as Jack is great. His flat, monotone delivery perfectly captures a person who is world weary and no longer interested in anything. It seems like it would get tiring or boring over the course of a movie but the situations and character reactions to his deadpan, ultra straight forward dialogue keeps it moving.
The only downside is the movie drags a bit (maybe could have been 10-15 minutes shorter) and while the audio and background sound play an important role in Jack's inner turmoil, it's often too loud and too distracting.
Overall, a really great movie.",1451433600,3,1007,4.662921348314606

I don't think this will break any records but I was fully engaged and curious about the old man that only Jack and his daughter could see.  I was a little confused about the cannibalism but it was all Silence of the Lambs...more like a snack here and there.  Instead of flashbacks you get some artifacts and you get to listen to the roar of memories Cain tries to suppress as mankind's first murderer.  It's a bit broken with a lot of unanswered questions so perhaps this is a pilot as another reviewer suggested.

He eats at the same diner everyday where Cara (Kate Greenhouse) has taken a shine to him. He discovers he has a daughter, but takes little interest in her (Jordan Todosey).

The movie does not follow your standard plot and character development nor is the ending what I expected but that is a good thing.  Jack is a man convicted for all eternity and as such how he interacts in the world is very skewed.  If you wonder what immortality could mean to you then Jack is one possible outcome.  The acting is very good and the story moved well.  The slow moments were needed and fit, it gives you time to think.  In the end I was entertained and spent much time thinking about the story.

7474075,5,B016JB0JWC,"This movie is exceptional in every way.

The movie was clearly written for Rollins and he lived into it. If you know much about Rollins this movie is probably a much closer depiction of Rollins the introvert than anything he has done.

The story revolves around Jack, a man who cannot die, who has been around since the bible. He is a man who understands the past because he's lived all of it but is unsettled when he is confronted by a history he didn't know existed, a daughter. You'd expect him to wax sentimental, to do deep soul searching, he does no such thing. He tries to continue his existence with her in his space and is very logical and methodical when she is kidnapped for a crime he didn't commit ... or did he?

The awkwardness of interacting with other humans is balanced only by the ruthless and precise violence that he meads out not as justice but simply as part of life. And if you are a fan of violence you'll get your fair share.

And Cannibalism.

This is not a story of redemption, you won't feel settled and happy at the end but it will turn out the only way it can and the only way it ever has in Jack's life.

I rented this because I was curious how good it would be and immediately bought it because of how good it was. Definitely worth watching if you are a fan of Rollins or this style of movie.",1450742400,32,1325,4.217391304347826

Favorite part is when he lets the waitress's boyfriend punch him square in his face and he litterally doesnt flinch but immediatly squirts a mouthfull of blood onto him.... like wtf, that was awsome i guess",1517875200,,383,4.485714285714286
