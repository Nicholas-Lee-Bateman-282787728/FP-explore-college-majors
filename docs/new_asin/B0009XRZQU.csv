2334560,5,B0009XRZQU,"Usually I don't like horror films but when I got to see this movie i really liked how it played off of the reality tv phenomenon.  I loved the fact that no one could figure out if it was just a production stunt to get ratings or if they were in real danger.

2334561,5,B0009XRZQU,"This flick doesn't take itself seriously which is why I enjoyed it so much. Great one liners, T&A, and overacting ""reality"" at it's finest. Not so much a horror flick for me, but more horribly entertaining. Don't sleep on this one folks. It's definitely worth a rental.",1128729600,,269,4.74468085106383
2334562,4,B0009XRZQU,"Sex, Drugs, TV and Murder; what more does the teen audience need or want?  ""Reality Kills"" is directed by Rafael Zelinsky; the same director that has created ""Screwballs,"" ""Poltergiest: The Legacy,"" Hangman's Curse,"" and ""National Lampoon's Last Resort."" The movie stars Courtney Peldon, Nate Dushku (the brother of actress Eliza Dushku), Natalie Cigliuti, Julie Ann Emery, Timonthy Lee DePriest, Kristen Miller, Khalil Kain, and Sticky Fingaz.  The movie is a different approach from your typical horror movies since it is reality television based and not doesn't involve alot of gruesome killings.  It is about 7 people of different backgrounds and life styles coming together to live in a house 50 miles away from civilization as a part of a reality show with a $100,000 grand prize to whomever can last the longest. The movie is a different approach from your typical horror movies since it is reality television based and not doesn't involve alot of gruesome killings.  They have no communication with the outside world, making this story both a blend of ""Big Brother"" and ""The Real World"" with suspense/horror.  Each character of the movie brings its own uniqueness and style. The stars of ""Reality Kills"" are being pressured from the camera people to bring more excitement and activity into their lives to get audiences hooked to want to watch their television show, so when the cast finds the dead body of one of their camera men, they start to believe that its either part of the show to get them to freak out and get the ratings they so desperately want, or if someone is trying to eliminate the cast one by one to reach the grand prize, which in turn starts getting the cast to turn on one around and not trust what the other has to stay.",1128556800,,1749,4.816666666666666
2334563,5,B0009XRZQU,"The movie ""Reality Kills,"" directed by Rafael Zelinsky, takes a different approach to your typical horror movies out there. It is a blend of both the reality show ""Big Brother""  and a suspenseful movie. The movie is based on a reality television show that places seven strangers from different life styles to live together in a secluded farm house that is 50 miles away from civilization, cutting their communication with the outside world, with a grand prize of $100,000 to the winner of the show.  The setting has an urban legend surrounding it, which half the cast is doubtful to believe or want to believe in, but when the bodies of one of their camera men is found in the shed, it makes the cast question everything that is taking place and to not trust the people around them. The producers of the show had been pressuring the cast to bring more excitement into the show to bring in the a high audience and rating, which makes the cast wonder if everything taking place is all an hoax or actual reality.",1128556800,2,1009,4.569060773480663
8069610,1,B0009XRZQU,"I saw the bad reviews but it was cheap and I thought ""what the heck."" I watched about 15 minutes and ejected it. If anyone wants my copy they can have it. A bunch of loud obnoxious punks yelling around and hamming for the camera without a script. Get's old pretty quick.",1473897600,,270,4.211538461538462

8069612,1,B0009XRZQU,"Dont believe the ""5 Star"" reviews below.  They were obviously written by people who are marketing this total piece of garbage.  Completely unoriginal low budget disaster that ""borrows"" from Scream, Friday the 13th and others.  Not only that, but they already did a Haloween sequel that had the exact same premise (Real World-like reality show where everyone gets killed).  Terrible acting, cheesy video technique, no chemistry among the actors and the typical stereotypes, i.e. bimbo, goth kid and tough black guy.  Do not waste your time with this trash.",1247011200,6,555,5.191011235955056
8069613,3,B0009XRZQU,"Firstly, there seems to be a reviewing controversy. I have reviewed many other horror movies, especially B/C/D rate horror movies. That said, Reality Kills isn't the best horror movie I've ever seen, but it's certainly not the worst (That would be a tie between Zombie Nation and Date Movie).

Reality Kills is a send up of reality television, most notably MTV's Real Life. Seven strangers with very distinct personalities are forced to live together in a remote house. The characters in the movie are exaggerations of the `types' that usually end up on Real Life - The Good Girl who may not be so good, the misunderstood African American male, a character based on Puck from Real Life 4 (this alone is worth buying the movie), the bi-sexual girl, the Goth.... Etc. After a set-up of everyone's personalities the murders begin. The deaths aren't the most spectacular in any small time horror movie, so go into the film with that in mind.

Who the killer is comes as a surprise, and the plot flows along well. I think if you go into the movie with the idea it's not the most brilliant horror cinema, but it is a brilliant send up of MTV's Real World with an I Know What You Did Last Summer/Scream feel, then you shouldn't be disappointed.

Recommended for people in the mood for a fun, easy B grade horror movie.",1173484800,7,1311,4.594017094017094
8069614,5,B0009XRZQU,"""Reality Kills"" is one of those new and different movies that takes you by surprise and proves to be one of your all-time favorites! When I saw this movie I just couldn't get enough.  The whole reality tv thing was great! I especially loved how the accusations turned from the old caretaker to each of the cast members.  Instead of sticking together, they all turn on each other and have to rely on themselves to survive.  With not just $100,000 on the line, the cast gives reality a whole new meaning. ""Reality Kills"" is a great release and gives its audience thrill and thrill.",1129852800,,579,4.548076923076923
8069615,5,B0009XRZQU,"Anyone up for seeing an awesome horror movie? This new dvd release by Rafael Zelinsky will not let you down! I saw it at my friends house and went out that very same day to get my own copy! This movie is so awesome! Sure, I didn't recognize any of the actors, but they did a good job! This movie has it all, sex, drugs and murder.  It takes place on some random farm in the middle of who knows where and all of the reality tv show members compete for a grand prize.  But when one of the camera men is murdered, everyone's suspicions are heightened.  The movie has some amazing shots and each cast member is forced to rely on their own primitive instincts, buy this movie, it is so awesome!",1129852800,,689,4.165413533834586

8069617,5,B0009XRZQU,"Finally, a horror film that really gets me.  After the release of several ""horror"" films this past summer I thought I was going to die of boredom.  ""Reality Kills"" is a refreshing look at movie-making. Zelinsky did an amazing job of getting a great cast in order to make this movie.  Though none of them are A-List actors, each brought this story to life.  When the reality tv show cast finds the camera man in the barn I thought for sure that the rest of the plot would just drag, but surprisingly I found the movie to be entertaining taking a different approach to the horror film genre.  Check it out, ""Reality Kills"" cleverly combines both realms of reality and fiction to produce a visionary film.",1129852800,,702,4.5396825396825395
8069618,5,B0009XRZQU,"Though it originally was filmed in 2002, ""Reality Kills'"" dvd release has been an explosion.  With a great director behind the film and unique plot, no one can get enough!  Rafael Zelinsky who also directed ""Poltergeist"" made sure the eerie and horrific images in the movie were brought through in both a realistic and convincing way.  Based on a reality tv show, ""Reality Kills"" takes seven strangers all competing for $100,000.  Despite the enticement of being on tv, this reality show is set on a deserted farm in the middle of nowhere with a creepy caretaker.  When the cameraman is found dead in the barn, each cast member becomes a suspect.  Starring Natila Ciguliutti from ""All My Children"", Nate Dushku from ""Antitrust"", Courtney Peldon of ""Boston Public"" and Khalil Kain from ""Girlfriends,"" the film combines the concept fo Big Brother with Wes Craven. ""Reality Kills"" is sure to leave you speechless.",1129852800,,910,4.993377483443709
