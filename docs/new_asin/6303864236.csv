7853613,5,6303864236,"This product was perfect - still in its original packaging!  Hard to find something like this 10 years after VHS became extinct.  Now, if only this program and other Peanuts specials/movies can come out on DVD, I would be in heaven!",1350777600,,232,4.634146341463414
7853614,5,6303864236,"A short anthology of short Peanuts sketches,this video has some of the most hilerious moments they ever made. One involves Peppermint Patty making two very serious mistakes. First she takes Snoopy's advice on private school and ends up jumping hurdles at the Ace Obedience School. When she realizes the double cross she turns her furry on World War 2,a neighbor cat who she thinks is Snoopy in a cat suit,and she herself gets torn to bits while the real Snoopy saves the day. Also of note is when one of Linus finds himself with a former love on a fieldtrip,name of Truffles and ends up on a roof while Truffles and Sally fight over his attention. And Snoopy,again comes to the rescue.",1116374400,6,685,4.622950819672131
7853615,5,6303864236,"I would rank this video #1 in my growing collection. I couldn't stop laughing at the many short, well-orchestrated scenes of all the gang winding up in some sort of dilemma. My favorite was an angry Peppermint Patty attacking World War 2, the cat next door, thinking it was Snoopy dressed in disguise. Snoopy, of course, jumps in to save Peppermint Patty and the two of them end up sitting on top of Snoopy's house, survivors of the fight, scruffled and war-torn, yet laughing at how she tried to pull the ""fake cat suit off"" the cat. It was hilarious! And, as usual, the cat ends up slashing Snoopy's house to shreds. Every scene in this video was well-connected to the next and extremely funny. The introduction by Charles M. Schulz was very memorable to me. Have been a true Peanuts fan since age 14 and now 4 decades later the intensity is even greater.",972604800,26,857,4.535483870967742
7853616,5,6303864236,"This cartoon starts with a live introduction from Charles Schulz.  This is the 1st time a Peanuts special had ever had more than 1 story.  It would inspire The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show, which marked the 1st time the Peanuts gang had their own regular show and the simmilar special It's an Adventure, Charlie Brown.
In this 45 minute special, Charlie Brown tries to fly his kite (while getting himself and everybody else tangled up!).  Peppermint Patty attends Ace Obedience School as recommended by Snoopy (only to find out too late it's a dog's school!).  Sally goes through the normal trials and tribulations of school life.  Lucy punishes Schroeder for liking his piano more than her (one of the funniest moments!).  Linus gets stuck on top of a barn during a school field trip!  Finally, Charlie Brown winds up in the hospital and gets an outside vigil from Peppermint Patty and Marcy and a guilt-laden promise from Lucy (I'm not giving away what it is, but I can guarantee hilarious results!).",970790400,4,1003,4.796511627906977
7853617,5,6303864236,"The pacing and feel of this Peanuts special is different than the other prime time specials, but it still works wonderfully. Some of the rapid-fire, short episodes provide some of the best laughs. Among the many  chuckle-aloud moments, the ones involving Sally in the classroom are the  best (watch for the facial expression after she ""def[ies] anyone in  this classroom to draw a good cow's leg!"" That never fails to crack us  up). Great for kids and parents alike, this 1980 special still seems fresh  and contemporary (save for one Bjorn Borg reference that may leave  youngsters wondering). Buy and enjoy!",954374400,10,609,4.98019801980198
