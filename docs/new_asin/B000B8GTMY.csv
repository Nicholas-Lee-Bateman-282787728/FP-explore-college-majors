8083632,4,B000B8GTMY,"unless or until congress and the supreme court amend the constitution, this cd will not be obsolite. good for adults to review their history and great for students as an extra study aid.",1395705600,,186,4.666666666666667
8083633,5,B000B8GTMY,"I am teaching my 5th grade daughter about the Constitution (since it is in the news all the time) and can't tell you how happy I am with the series.  It goes over why the ammendments were added to the Constitution as well as what they are.  There were many things in there that I didn't know.  They also talk about landmark decisions by the Supreme Court.

A lot of the series went over my daughters head, but I would stop and explain what they just talked about.  This would be great for junior high or high school as well as adults.  It drives me crazy that history and government classes were so boring in school, dvd's like this one would have made it more interesting and easier to learn!!  My daughter loved it and was happy we watched it, she said she learned a lot.

One note, this series is in 8 parts (1/2 hour each) and is perfect for 1 part each day.",1296086400,9,862,4.181818181818182
8083634,5,B000B8GTMY,"As a high school/ middle school librarian that watches a lot of AV resources, I would recommend it for purchase as it has several important court cases which hardly any materials are available on these cases. Since it was 2005 it mentioned the Patriot Act after 911. From a historical point of view I thought it did a very good job on the constitution from the founding fathers to all of the amendments and why they were needed. It's focus was the United States Constitution.",1285545600,12,475,4.6
8083635,5,B000B8GTMY,This series is a wonderful and patriotic telling of the founding of this nation. Every American should be required to know these important historical foundations. This series is enlightening and very enjoyable.,1225238400,7,210,5.59375
8083636,1,B000B8GTMY,"I was expecting a really engrossing video series for the money...BOY WAS I DUPED! It is terribly boring and kids can not be expected to watch more than 10-20 minutes of it. It can be used as small snipets on some issues, but on the whole, a terrible disappointment for the price.",1215734400,5,279,4.384615384615385
